“You never call because you’re Tony Stark and like to pretend that no one cares about you,” Sharon scoffed. “I let it happen because I have my own problems to deal with. Besides, Pepper checks in with me at least once a month and Rhodey and I have a standing breakfast date every three weeks.”
Steve looked down at his shoes, wringing his hands at the thought of SHIELD, of all the people they had lost over the years, to threats Steve had been created to respond to. Lives lost at the hands of fate, hands Steve should have been able to crush.
“All of it. The hero gig, the aliens, and the monsters, and the robots. Just like with Howard and Peggy, we couldn’t have a real relationship because my life is always going to be intertwined with the worst things that happen in our world.”
When Tony turns around, Steve is looking straight at him, his intense baby blues questioning Tony’s actions, but stays quiet as Tony continues moving around the jet.
“You’ve always done everything you could,” Steve blurted out, not being able to stand the haunted look in Tony’s face. “Hydra has always been my responsibility, Tony. All the things that happened… It’s on me, not you or any of the others.”
“I’m so sorry, Sharon. I still can’t believe it,” Tony said softly to Sharon.
Before he knew it, they were hugging, hard. He didn’t know who had reached for who, but they had met in the middle, the moment undeniable and instinctual. And for the first time since he had heard Peggy was gone forever, Steve wept.
——————————————-
Steve sat in the pew, watching as Sharon spoke quietly to what he assumed were members of her and Peggy’s family, feeling like he was intruding upon the life of someone he was holding onto too hard. Peggy had lived most of her life without him, maybe he shouldn’t be taking up as much space now that she was gone.
“Swimming and s’mores? Peggy must have wiped your memory, cuz.” Tony said, shaking his head. “We spent most of the time doing martial arts! Aunt Peggy was livid that I kept getting kidnapped and was determined that I learn to defend myself with more than explosions. I learned all my best moves from Peg.”
Tony laughed, genuinely this time. “Rogers, you’ve got to start putting things together faster.”Steve looked at him confused as Tony turned to Sharon with his trademark snark and asked, “What, no welcome for me?”
“Tony… I never hated you.”
“She didn’t tell me a lot,” Tony sighs. “Now, I wish I had pushed her more, but Peggy was very intentional with what she brought home to us kids. She knew I was getting enough adult stress from my father, so I think she wanted to make my time with her as carefree as possible.”
That statement did its job, making Steve look up at him in surprise, almost looking hurt.
The look on Tony’s face was one he knew well. It’s the face he saw in the mirror every morning, the one that said the weight of the world was on your shoulders and you failed to shoulder the burden.
“He was terrible. Abusive. An alcoholic. Pressured me at every turn. But Aunt Peggy was amazing,” Tony said. “I don’t know how she made the time to remember my birthdays and celebrate my successes, but I think she felt responsible for me, just like she had felt responsible for my father. After Howard died, she intervened where she could, but I wasn’t the easiest of charges either. She handled my father’s funeral and stepped out of the way when it was clear Obadiah wanted to raise me in his image. I wasn’t exactly welcoming to her, but she tried, even with having her own children.”
Steve looked down at his feet again, once again wondering how the serum had been able to perfect so many other things about him, but had left him a monumental screw up when it came to the people in his life. Sometimes he truly wondered if it was God, or whatever greater being existed, cursing him because they had tried to play with nature one too many times.
“If we’re going to make this day about Peggy, then there’s no reason to stay here, Capsicle. I’ve got a full Peggy day planned out, don’t worry,” Tony reassured the super soldier with a pat on the shoulder. “But believe me, the best way to reminisce about Peggy is in the good ole’ US of A.”
“I thought the same thing when Jarvis started telling me about their adventures. Apparently, Peggy’s skills weren’t being used as the only woman agent at the SSR after the war, so my father would have her do side work for him when he was being targeted or having issues with theft of his tech. Jarvis, as frail and proper as he was, was supposedly Aunt Peg’s backup, but unless her backup needed to be really good at polishing silver or tying Windsor knots, I’m still unconvinced that he was particularly effective.”
“I assumed Peggy would have dumped Stark as soon as the war was over,” Steve said, leaning back to stare at the ceiling. “From what you’ve told me about him later in life, he wasn’t exactly pleasant.”
“I was joking,” Sharon rolled her eyes. “Aunt Peggy knew that I wanted to be a spy, but that my parents were never going to go for such a thing. Those two weeks were basically boot camp, especially after your skinny ass went to MIT. You weren’t there to hold me back anymore.”“And you wonder why I never call,” Tony said, pretending to be affronted.
Tony took a minute to process that, leaning towards the nearest window and trying to find the words to respond. He blinked rapidly, trying to dispel the tears that he couldn’t seem to keep at bay today.
At that, Steve couldn’t help the tears that appeared in his eyes and he couldn’t really bring himself to care. For the first time, he didn’t really feel like Tony was judging him or trying to read him, he was just speaking honestly.
“Hey, Steve. Thanks for coming.” Steve looked up to see Sharon smiling softly at him from the aisle.
“Rogers, look at me.”
“This Peggy trip I’m taking you on today.. I hope it clears up some of this doubt you have hanging over you. I should have done it a long time ago, probably right after you came out of the ice, but I didn’t know if it would be welcome. Back then, I was way too worried about if you hated me or not,” Tony said laughing shortly.
Tony jogs up the ramp of the quinjet waiting for them at the end of a short runway and starts hitting controls at lightning speed, powering up the jet and entering coordinates for their trip.
_____________
Now, it was Steve’s turn to squeeze Tony’s hand, this time in pure reflex and disbelief.
“For the record, I care about you too,” Tony said. “And, I’m glad your life is as chaotic as it is.”
Steve stumbled over his words, trying to explain what he meant.
“Sit down and buckle up, Cap. We’ve got a few hours to kill before we get to our destination.”
Glancing up, he stopped short, as his eyes tried to process the presence of an unexpected person, honestly the last person he expected, sitting in the last pew of the church.
Steve hesitates, looking out the window at the London fog, and finally capitulates. Sitting in a seat and buckling in as Tony begins the process of getting the quinjet in the air.
“A fact that did not escape me even as a child, Anthony.” Sharon said, rolling her eyes.
“Actually, Tony, I think I’m just going to stick around England for awhile. Visit some places Peggy used to tell me about. I can handle getting back stateside by myself.”
Tony sighed and called out, “Hey, Grandpa.”
“Yes.”
“One day, one day you’re going to see in yourself what Aunt Peggy sees in you. What my father sees in you,” Tony said softly, clearing his throat and glancing away uncomfortably. “What I see in you.”
Tony scoffed, “Yeah, right. You totally hated me when all the Loki shit went down. ‘Put on the suit, let’s go a few rounds.’ You must have selective memory.”
Tony’s always busy. He can’t just… talk to Steve. Or anyone for that matter. If he’s in the kitchen, he’s typing away on his phone. If he’s in the jet or in a car, he’s working from a pad. If he’s at home, he’s working on something with FRIDAY, always.
“Fury let you, the number one pain in his ass, go through classified SHIELD files just because you missed Peggy?” Steve asks disbelievingly.
“Hmmm,” Tony hums, “Do you want to know?”
“I mean, obviously I didn’t know you,” Steve stuttered painfully. “But it felt like I did. Your father and I weren’t very close, so I didn’t feel like I had a place in your life as your father’s friend or anything, but for better or worse, you do remind me of him. Even just by simply sharing his last name, it was something familiar to me for the first time since I thawed out. But then… our relationship was complicated by all this shit.”
“Um, almost nothing,” Steve admits, sadly. “I know the basics, like about her starting SHIELD and whatnot, but with her so out of it these last few months, I didn’t want to distress her with a litany of questions. And I certainly felt odd asking her family members when they were so obviously already in mourning.”
Steve laughed out loud, thinking about the Jarvis he knew, the faceless, proper English A.I. being fast friends with Peggy, and couldn’t help but think their sarcasm might have been well-matched.
Steve heard a rustle and a sigh, and in the periphery of his vision saw Tony unbuckle his seatbelt and move to sit right next to Steve. Steve stifled a gasp and tried not to pull away as Tony gently covered his linked hands with his own and squeezed lightly.
“Oh, please. You know she always gave me a pass for everything,” Tony said, standing up and approaching Sharon with his arms outstretched.
Turning to Tony, she smiles and says softly, “You know why I can’t do that. We’ve already discussed this.”
“Actually, I have an eidetic memory and I know for a fact that I never hated you, I swear, Tony,” Steve said softly. “I never could. No matter what. I was… so confused when I got out of the ice. I didn’t trust Fury completely, but he was the only one who wasn’t terrified or blown away by me. And then you came along, and you were someone I knew.”
Steve waved his hands around, presumably at the quinjet, but Tony knew he meant more than that.
“Why are you here, Tony? Funerals, even for former spies, don’t really seem like your thing.”
——————————————————-
“What do you know about Peggy’s life after you went under? After the war?”
He’s sure that if he were to ask FRIDAY or JARVIS to come up with footage of all the time he’s spent just watching Tony work, they could collectively come up with hundreds of hours of footage, from the workshop, from the jets, from their communal living spaces. But Tony never notices, so Steve doesn’t bother looking away. He just stares, watching Tony probably solving global warming from his phone, no matter where they are or what they’re doing.
Snapping out of his reverie, Tony watched Cap as he walked down the aisle looking forlorn and couldn’t help but resent him a bit. What did he know? He had known Aunt Peg for a handful of months before he had gone into the ice. Tony was missing the steady, loving presence of his aunt, not a specter of the past.
Seeing her old, with children and grandchildren, had tilted Steve’s axis. She was alive, but they didn’t know each other anymore. She didn’t even know herself anymore.
Sharon snorted, but leaned her head against Tony’s shoulder, “I don’t remember that at all, but we did spend a lot of time together as children, until Tony became too cool and busy for swimming and s’mores.”
Sharon rolls her eyes. “Don’t worry, Steve. I won’t be doing that.”
Tony’s breath caught for a second as he tried to process that statement, as he tried to process being put in the same category as Peggy.
Tony interrupted, “You wanted us to have a real relationship?”
Steve can’t stop himself from gasping a bit at that abrupt pronouncement and tries to play it off as a cough, when both of them turn to look at him.
“Tony, I don’t have a lot of people in my life. Regardless of what our relationship looks like day to day, you’re one of the most important people in the world to me. I care what you think and I care about you.”
Tony watched Steve from the back pew. He had planned on joining the family at the front, but when he had seen Steve’s oh so recognizable shoulders sitting near Sharon and her family, he had slipped unseen into a pew in the back of the crowded church. Sharon was going to be mad, but he didn’t feel like sitting that close to the captain right now.
“I love you. But I love my job. We agreed on this years ago, Anthony,” Sharon says sadly. “You have your dream, I have yours.”
“I would love to,” Steve responds, straightening up and directing his attention to Stark.
“Aunt Peg?” was all Steve managed to get out, surprised at the billionaire’s familiarity with both Peggy and Sharon.
“You forget your own history, Cap. My father and Aunt Peg were friends even before you arrived on the scene, remember? Founding members of S.H.I.E.L.D? Long-time mourners of the great Steven Grant Rogers? They always had each other’s backs, even when my father was auditioning for asshole of the century. Aunt Peg almost made him bearable,” Tony said wistfully.
“Of course.” Steve said. “Tony, this is Sharon, Peggy’s niece. Sharon, this is Tony Stark.”
Steve starts at that question from the previously absorbed Tony, looking up to finding the man looking at him inquisitively.
Tony, sensing Steve’s train of thought, his hand rubbing up and down Sharon’s upper arm comfortingly, said “Sharon and I used to spend two weeks with Aunt Peggy every year. She was obscenely busy keeping the world safe, but she always made time for us. I spent those two weeks terrorizing Sharon here because she was so much younger than me. And she idolized me.”
Nevertheless, he was going to see Cap in a minute, whether he liked it or not.
“Y’all really need to just go down to City Hall and make it official already. Invite me, maybe I’ll show up for James,” Sharon says, laughing.
“Alright. Let’s go, Cap.”
“What else?” Steve asks wistfully.
Steve twists his hands together and coughs, looking down at his shoes. The serum won’t let him just zone out and ignore how much time has passed, so he’s embarrassingly aware that it’s been an hour of watching Tony do his thing and he really needs to stop.
Tony moved his hands to Steve’s broad shoulders, squaring up to Steve finally.
Steve can’t believe she’s really gone.
Aunt Peg had been the only bright spot in his memories of his father. Always ready for a quip to Howard’s often cruel sarcasm and a censure to his more abusive tendencies towards Tony, Aunt Peg had been one of the few people who could actually stand up to Howard and survive. Howard had made Tony resent Cap, but Aunt Peg had made Tony respect him. Howard’s behavior stood in stark opposition to the Howard Aunt Peggy had known as a friend. She had been ready with a hug and a story throughout Tony’s childhood, thrilling tales of her, Howard’s, and Jarvis’s exploits, nostalgic remembrances of her Steve Rogers, and his favorites, her struggle to be a powerhouse in a field that would always condescend to her gender.
Tony blinked a couple of times, making sure it wasn't a dream. When Steve wouldn't budge, it seemed to be the reality.
Tony had JARVIS open up a list of Disney Pixar movies and picked up Peter in his arms to level them both. All of the Pixar movies were now just a tap away, posters all lined up to be chosen from. Peter was so starstruck by the screens that he didn't answer to any of Tony's or Steve's questions about his preference.
"Huh? Oh! Yeah. Yeah, I was just checking in on Pete."
After Steve's continuous guarantee to everything Tony had offered, the man was totally lost. Steve didn't object to anything.
Peter beamed awfully bright. "Really?!"
"We'll see." Steve said, lowering down the third finger.
Tony looked at his tie and saw that he had worn the orange one with little blue spots. "Why, thank you, good sir."
Tony grinned. "Is that so? Dum-E!"
"Now who's rambling?" Ton smirked, granting him with a blushing Steve who shut his mouth. "You think I'm cute?" The blush grew darker. "I mean I would've gone for handsome but cute works too if that's what you think."
Next time Tony gets an idea, he'll just chuck it out in the wind and yell 'fuck it'. That's what he would do. Definitely.
Tony got two cups and filled them up with steaming black liquid, adding sugar accordingly. Sipping from his cup, he exhaled deeply. "Love this stuff."
Steve hid his own grin behind the cup of coffee as he drank some.
"You can have as many scoops you want, as long as you father allows it." Tony said.
Steve brought his arms around Tony's waist and buried his face in Tony's chest. Tony held him close and tight. He let him cry out again.
This time JARVIS was told to give him names of only blond parents. The list, this time, was still long but shorter than the previous one, so that was a plus. The cutie was to be here somewhere.
Now with Steve gone and a sleepy toddler cuddling his side as the movie neared it's end, he tried to reach the checklist he made in his mind with every instruction Steve had given. Soon the credits rolled and Tony told JARVIS to cut the projection.
Peter laughed loudly at the compliments he was receiving and threw the ball away, as far away as he could, which was only a few feet away from where they were standing. He then proceeded by running after it and grabbing the ball before running back to his dad, giggling excitedly.
"Thanks, JARVIS. You're the best."
"Fresh food, darling. Fresh food." Already pulling his phone out, Tony spoke. "Chinese okay?"
Tony sighed heavily. "I thought... You seemed so tense... Since you got here. I didn't know why. I didn't know what to think of. And my fucked up brain led me to think that you wanted out. I'm sorry. I ruined tonight, I'm sorry. But I was so scared. I don't- I don't wanna lose you. You're the best thing that's happened to me in forever, I don't wanna lose that."
"You didn't wake me up, Steve. Don't worry. Just... Woke up and saw him gone so... I don't know."
"No, darling, you look absolutely amazing. Don't worry about that."
Tony had dropped Steve and Peter off in front of their apartment. The neighborhood wasn't great, old apartment buildings bordering the street. Steve had firmly held Peter's sleeping body in his arms as he thanked Tony for the evening.
"It might've been brought to my attention a time or two."
"Pinky promise." The toddler raised his tiny pinky finger. Steve wrapped his larger one around it and raised the hand to kiss it.
Tony chuckled. "Your dad will kill me if I do, buddy. How about you just play with Dum-E for now."
"And now so do I." Tony squeezed his hand, reassuringly.
"I'm up. See?" Peter used his fingers to open his eyes as much as he could. Tony moved his hands away and rubbed the side of his face.
Tony blinked a coupled of times. "Who are?"
Not yet.
Tony nodded. "Have you eaten today?" Steve met Tony's eyes and looked away. Tony sighed. "That just won't do. We're ordering Chinese."
Tony let out a deep, a very deep, breath and leaned his forehead to rest on Steve's.
"Sorry! Sorry!"
When Steve came back, he had a little frown on his face while rubbing his forehead. Tony saw him coming in and saw the state he was in across the room. He questioned with a hand gesture and Steve hesitated before gesturing him over. Tony glanced at Peter, who was lost to the world, so engrossed in the explosions in the movie to even notice Tony slipping away.
"See you later." Tony waved him away.
"No. No, it's... It's fine. I don't... mind."
"We were here for the weekend. It's not like it's a lot of stuff. Just stuff I thought we might need."
"Tony." Steve's soft, soothing voice brought him out of his breathing pattern. "Sweetheart." Steve's hand came to run knuckles slowly across his cheek. Then the hand settled to cup his cheek, delicately but firm at the same time. Like Tony was a fragile petal, not wanting to tear it but also wanting to hold it between the fingers, not wanting it to get blown away.
They played around the pool some more until Peter started to grow tired and Steve decided it was time for the boy's nap. He got Peter out of the pool and dried him off, having him change into some clothes. "I don't wanna sleep alone."
"Send it to voice mail. I'm busy." Tony said not taking his eyes off the digits on the hologram.
"Then what is it? 'Cause I sure as hell can't see what it is."
"Yes, it is matching. Good eye, Peter." Tony encouraged. To which Peter gave a cute little giggle and looked at his dad.
Tony made sure to have asked for Steve's number when asking for a second date. Steve seemed eager enough to accept, that built up Tony's confidence in the matter even more firmly. If Steve really wanted this like it seemed so, then everything in the world was just spectacular. Tony had decided to not have any seconds thoughts this next time around.
Tony raised a brow. "Probably..."
Steve rolled his eyes, went closer to Tony and kissed his lips. He then kissed Peter's head. "You like it, honey?"
"What do you think I was gonna do?" Tony asked scandalized.
"It is true, Ms Potts. But a discussion about a shrine was also held."
Peter waved his hand at Dum-E. "Bye, Dum-E." The bot rolled his claw at the kid and Tony patted his surface.
Steve finally met Tony's gaze, hurt all over his face. He didn't say anything.
"None."
"I'm appalled that you don't trust me." Tony said in his dramatic, hurt voice.
"Thanks." Steve looked at Peter with so much tender love in his eyes. Tony could've sworn he was a goner right there and then.
He ran his fingers through Steve's hair, settling them down a bit. "Were you planning on spending the whole day like that?"
"Do I not even get a good-morning-kiss?"
"It really gets to ya, doesn't it?" Tony ruffled his hair.
"You are better than JARVIS!" Peter spoke.
Tony sat down where he was standing. "J, is it hot in here? Or am I sweating a lot?"
"We're at Tony's mason! For the get stay!" Peter exclaimed, excitedly, not knowing he made no sense at all. Steve looked at Tony, questioning.
"Uh, it's alright, kid. Your dad is right. I was just unlucky enough to have to wear this here." He made a point not to look at Steven, who from close enough was even hotter, if that was possible to begin with. Evidently, it was, as hard as it was to believe so.
"I suppose." Steve nodded. "And yeah, I do. Park's close to the apartment." Steve shrugged. "Do you often have business meetings here?" Now the guy had a hint of smirk on his face.
"Oh, so you know too?" Steve turned to give Peter a playful angry look. The boy laughed and forgot about Steve the very next second as he paid attention to Dino in his hand. Steve sat straight and stared at the road ahead and the surroundings, trying to figure out where they were headed.
"What's raisin?" Peter asked.
"But why? What did I do to let you believe that? I just don't... I don't understand." Steve looked so lost, Tony wanted to punch himself.
"This isn't a manhunt. This is... this is something else. Not a manhunt." The doors opened and he stepped into his lab. "Manhunt makes it sound so vicious. Jesus. Lockdown, J."
. He hoped to god there wasn't going to be any pain but he also found himself agreeing with the voice. This beautiful, beautiful man was worth it all and more. Much, much more.
"Can we?" This time his hopeful eyes targeted Tony, who was pretty sure by now that this face was a Rogers-family weapon. He had seen Steve make it once or twice, or maybe five times, so far. And the genius happened to be completely helpless against it, whether it was the father or the son who made it.
"With him?" Peter nodded. "I suppose you can."
"Daddy, Tony's using big words again." Peter whined.
"God, help me. I need a drink. Or five."
The kid shook his head no and Tony grabbed his hand. "Well no need to worry. You get to pick whatever looks good, alright?"
Tony and Steve got the bags out and carried them inside, Steve following Tony, Peter in his arms. Peter was given two of his toys to carry, which he proudly did. Once they got everything inside, Steve looked around the place.
As he had expected, after a few minutes he heard the door slide open and heard heels approaching.
When they parted, Tony bit his own lip before asking, "I wanted to ask you. I have been meaning to ask for a while but I never knew when was the right time."
Soon enough Peter had decided that he wanted a scoop of chocolate chip cookie dough because he loved cookie dough and a scoop of cotton candy because that was blue, his favorite color. Steve tried to hold back his sound of disapproval at the amount of sugar the kid was going to intake just so Peter could enjoy one night.
"I'm gonna crush you."
"And I think it's stupid to order in when you can make breakfast yourself. You wouldn't wanna deprive Peter of some pancakes, would you?"
"He sure loves Mr Incredible." Tony commented, bringing Peter to the sofa, settling him down between both of them. "Pause, JARVIS."
He got out the car and straightened his jacket. A mantra of
"I'll keep that in mind." Tony said, softly smiling. Steve looked away before he blushed again and looked at Peter, running his fingers through the child's hair.
Tony narrowed his eyes at her, mumbling something about SpongeBob and My Little Pony not belonging in the same category but kept it to himself. Pepper didn't quite catch the reason behind Tony's statement but didn't push it. "Happy has a sandwich for you in the car. You can eat on the way there. We're already late. Now come on."
, the best thing. A thing Tony would categorize as something he was not worthy of or completely undeserving of.
The movie started and Steve eased into Tony's space, Tony had no problem with that. No problem at all. Except for the fact that his anxiety was tensing him up.
Tony cupped the side of Steve's face and joined their mouths together. Tony wasn't sure if he had ever felt like this before, but he was certainly feeling sparks in his stomach. He felt Steve grab the back of his head, bringing him closer. Steve kissed so tenderly, he could feel the passion and still felt like glass, like Steve was scared of breaking him.
"No." Steve leaned in, bringing their lips closer. Tony put away the rest of the distance and kissed the man. Their faces all wet, lips slipping, but it was wonderful.
"You have a yacht." Steve deadpanned.
Anyway, this needed to be buried.
Steve glared at Peter all the while Tony just smirked. "Or are you just trying to hurt my feelings here?"
He rubbed his forearms, trying fruitlessly to calm himself down.
Peter had a determined and possessive look on his face. "Yes, he is. Daddy is never wrong."
"I didn't really look into much other than his name, I swear. And it wouldn't have happened if you'd have just let me talk to him at the daycare."
"You got it." Happy gave him a thumbs up.
"I am worse." She said, getting them both into the elevator. "Penthouse, JARVIS."
"Yeah, I saw that. And it's been driving me insane. So why don't you please just tell me and get it over with and save me from my misery. Please."
"Still a three year old." Steve nodded, humoring Tony.
"He's a boy?" Tony raised his brow at the question but decided to nod, not wanting to give anything away. "We can be friends?"
"You ready to sleep some more, kiddo?" Tony asked.
"Jesus Christ, Pepper. This is the worst idea you've had in, like, ever."
Steve made sure the boy was comfortably tucked in and safe from rolling over and onto the floor. When he came back outside, Tony was resting his chin on his folded arm, resting it on the floor.
Everything was
"No, sit tight."
"Just me." Tony whispered.
"No! I don't want to!" Tony wanted to drown. "Do you?"
Tony smiled warmly, propping himself up onto his elbow to see Steve clearly, his other hand never leaving Steve's hair and the other man never moving his head from Tony's stomach.
"I am nice. Daddy says I'm nice." Peter argued.
He guided Steve out of the restaurant and walked to the car waiting for them right outside. He opened the door for Steve, ushering him in, climbing in behind him. The car started and Steve took out his phone, tapping the screen repeatedly.
"I don't have Dino with me." Peter muttered.
Steve seemed taken aback. "I think last night was very telling." He tried to laugh it off.
"Sure! Yeah. Yeah, sure. Sounds good. Sounds- yeah." Since when did Tony become a stuttering pool of sweat. Oh yeah, the man had also started sweating.
"Oh..." Steve dipped his face down but Tony wasn't going to have any of that. He brought a finger under Steve's chin and tilted it back up to meet those beautiful baby blues. "Sweetheart, it's not a problem. We can do this any way you want, whatever you want. And you don't even have to either if you're that nervous-"
"Well, aren't you a charmer?"
"Tony?"
Steve nodded. "Just you." He joined their lips together and kissed the other man, deeply, as if trying to show what he felt right through the kiss.
"Huh. Sounds cute."
Steve smirked, the bastard, and turned to flip the pancake on the pan. "They're coming along just fine. Can you get the plates out?"
Peter shrieked and hid behind Tony's legs. "The table moved!"
"You got in long enough to have worn three dresses?" Steve asked, amused.
"You need some juice, buddy?"
"How- Peter?"
"It's just... I'm nothing special." Steve's voice was shy and hesitant. He also kept it low so Peter won't hear. "I'm a single father who doesn't have much to offer."
"What was her name?" Tony asked, hushed.
Steve stood up and walked to Tony. "You remember how we play the movie, buddy?"
"Do you know what a beauty pageant is?" Another head shake. "It's a competition where you have to dress up and stuff, in dresses. And then the judges decide who is the prettiest, basically."
"Worth it." Tony joined their lips together and poking his tongue out to lick Steve's lips. Steve let out a breath and opened his mouth, pressing his lips further into Tony's.
, Tony was going to lose it. In a goddamn park.
"I love you too." Peter kissed Steve's cheek.
"Hi!" Peter waved a hand at him, which made him drop the ball and roll away from him. "No!" He got up and ran the few steps to get to the ball, picking it up with the help of both the hands, turning to face his dad with a large toothy smile. "I got it."
An update every week.
Baking was a nightmare with both Peter and Tony. But Steve wouldn't wish to share moments like these with anyone else.
"Asleep. Like he should be so yeah, he's okay." Steve smiled warmly.
"Well, I'm not you."
"I don't need much other than a good person. Which, I have concluded, you are. And you have yet to prove me otherwise. But I'm pretty sure you won't. If Peter is anything to go by, you're practically a saint."
"I really hate you right now. I do not deserve to be teased like this."
"Yes, Tony, It's ice cream," Steve was chuckling. "You know they're wrong about you."
Tony looked at Steve and pointed at Peter, asking if he can pick him up. He did so once getting a nod of approval from Steve.
"Yeah... I uh..." Steve looked down, frowning, the prominent indent between his eye brows formed. "No, actually, I uh... I got a call from work. And they uh... Need to me to fill for a coworker."
"Yes!" Tony brought Peter to the couch and put him on it, immediately tickling the little kid. Peter, like his father, was sometimes very stubborn and just would not give up. But Peter, also like his father, had a huge weakness. And that happened to be him being ticklish.
"And I can only assume this is Peter?" Tony looked at the kid, who nodded enthusiastically. Real cute.
"It's plenty shrewd. The most shrewd. I have yet to meet someone shrewder than me."
"Whatever you want. Go crazy."
What he didn't expect was to get a whiplash when he was exiting the daycare.
"How is it taking advantage when I'm offering?"
"He's too young to be a rebel anyway. He'll catch up. Give him time." Tony said, purposefully with a mouthful this time.
"I'll save it later."
Steve's eyes grew bigger, shaking his head. "I wasn't reluctant. I wanted to come, I did-"
"And why not? I'm hungry."
"Cute kid."
When he reached them, Peter looked up to his dad from his position. "Are we really gonna live with Tony now, daddy?" His eyes shining bright with hope and excitement.
"Sure. Why not? We get along just fine."
Though Peter, being a toddler and sleepy, being a very sleepy toddler, didn't manage to grasp much of what Tony was saying and fell asleep less than half way through the demanded story. But Tony didn't stop there. He continued the story telling till he reached the end of how he was thrown out of the place, his friend following him while laughing his ass off.
Tony gulped and shook his head to bring himself on earth, enough to reply. "Uh- yes. Yeah, yes. Yes. Okay." He was painfully aware of how fast he was nodding.
Pepper had to step in, again, and make Tony choose one. Firmly stating that if Steve agreed to every option he had been given, maybe food wasn't why Steve was doing this. It was reassuring that Steve was thinking that way but Tony really didn't want to screw this up.
"That's great. And yourself?"
"What's a business partner?" Yup, Tony was reminded that kids are known to be very curious little things.
"Neither would Disney World."
"Yes. Please." His voice had sounded uneven. But thankfully, he needn't speak the rest of the ride home.
"Very easily."
"I want you." Steve became quiet. "If you'll let me have you. I know you saw me at the daycare the other day-"
Tony didn't think it was wise to beat around the bush now. The aliens would have to wait. He thought he could hold himself together but it was harder than he had anticipated. "Are you gonna break up with me?"
Tony took a picture of Peter sleeping soundly almost on top of him and sent it to Steve.
"Certainly does a bit, sir."
Steve seemed to be on edge the whole time they were together that day. It had barely been an hour since he had arrived. Tony had wanted to ask but Steve would then ask something unrelated, completely changing the subject. So he thought a movie would help, though it hadn't been helpful at all. Tony didn't know what was going on.
"Whatever you want. You wanna play it?" Peter nodded enthusiastically. Then Tony grabbed his chubby hand and brought it closer to the respected poster. "Now touch it like this."
"And I never thought I'd ever find someone who would love me for who I am, looking beyond my money and name. I thought it wasn't something for me. That even if I did meet somebody, I'd never be sure of their intentions. But with you," He stroke Steve's hair from the crown of his head. "With you, I don't think I've ever had even a second worth of doubt. Ever. I just know. You make me know."
"Please."
Steve let out a huge sigh. He was probably holding it since he stopped talking, Tony would've guessed. "That's... thank you, Tony. I'm glad you understand. That's... that's a relief, to be honest."
Peter was changed into a pair of underwear while the two adults changed into the swimming trunks Tony had packed. The man came prepared. Steve also found sunblock. He covered the kid with it, then Tony, and then himself, because he felt like the only adult since Tony complained in the process. Steve double and then triple checked the floaties before having Peter put them on and then checked once more.
The orphanage had a daycare center a few buildings away that Tony helped funding, under the wraps. The daycare was cheap, for parents who couldn't afford much, had double jobs to pay the bills, single parents not having anywhere to leave their child for a few hours of the day while they busted blood and sweat together to make ends meet.
"Sure. Where's my kiss?" Steve gladly gave him one and went for Peter. Tony did as told, thankfully Steve had already chosen the pan for this so Tony wasn't left to ask JARVIS which pan is suitable for the pancake cooking. Tony was shit at cooking, for the lack of better terms. All the years in and out of science laboratories made him know how to deal with burners and matches. After that, he was as clueless as a one year old.
"Uh, yeah. He probably would, if we remind him of it. But he's curious about anything and everything so..."
"I know it's not that."
Steve chuckled,
"Maybe someday."
No clue.
"Yeah, I'd like that. Again, thank you, Tony."
"You came." Steve sounded so surprised and yet so relieved that Tony was already kicking himself in the back for even thinking of cancelling.
Tony kept mumbling but followed the orders given to him anyway.
How was that supposed to help?!
They will walk away soon. Do something, Tony.
The two Rogers followed Tony around as he guided them through the three floors and the deck, showing all the bedrooms, bathrooms, the kitchen, the pool, the room with the pool table, the small private cinema, the lake near the backyard. Everything. Steve looked overwhelmed, while Peter just oh-ed and ah-ed at things or didn't care at all.
"It didn't. Now you're just wrongfully accusing."
"People usually don't. They think it's Bucky, but it was usually him pulling me out of the aftermath. That's his only part in this. He's like a protective big brother."
"How about pasta?"
"Fuck you, Rogers."
Tony felt like a teenage girl, thinking about Steve in such a manner. But he couldn't help it. Steve deserved to be cherished. In only two meetings, Tony had decided that Steve was a great guy. And he was the best of god's creations.
"Alright, buddy. I've got you, okay? Ready for the water?"
"If it takes a minute more than an hour, you're fired."
Steve laughed and ruffled his hair. "He is, isn't he? Why don't we help him unpack?"
"Wanna go to him now?" Peter nodded and was about to run to elevator's directions when Tony picked him up. "Na uh uh uh. Don't you have something to say to Dum-E?"
Soon enough he was back at the tower and still had not found the guy.
Tony came back with two bowls of pop corn, one smaller than the other and drinks for all three. Steve saw him coming and went to him to help with the stuff. He took the bigger bowl and both of their drinks to the recliner while Tony stuck the straw into Peter's juice box. Tony gave Peter the smaller bowl and his juice and settled next to Steve on the couch and Steve draped his arm around his shoulder and kissed his temple.
"Not a problem, I'm full of them. You want the book we read earlier or something new?"
One more thing about Tony was that he was a pile of insecurity walking around in thousand dollar suits. Blame his father for that, if you will. You wouldn't be wrong to. Years of degradation and taunts and rejections and insults thrown at his way when, if you'd ask Tony, a tennis ball would've been just fine. So now, years after the old man's demise, Tony was still waiting for his father to be proven right, yet once again.
Tony chuckled, patting his back. "No biggie, big guy. Peter's a good kid."
"Hey, no. No apologies." Steve didn't say anything. "She sounds like lovely lady."
"Why are you teasing Tony, daddy?" Oh, bless the innocence.
"I'll go get the pop corn. Do you need something to drink?" Tony said when he heard the ding.
"It is everything for Peter. It is everything for him and he loves them very much and I can't do that for him. So don't you say that it's nothing."
Steve was quiet for a couple of seconds. "Um, I was wondering... well, I wanted to confirm actually. About the date. Um... I have to make sure that Peter's uncle is free to, y'know, look after him. And so it wouldn't mess with your planning. 'Cause, like, I don't really have a, y'know, a sitter and it'll be a problem for me and-"
"You being suave." Steve said, then regret washed over his face as his eye widened. "I mean, you are. Definitely. But you ramble a lot. Not that that's a bad thing, it's actually kinda cute. I mean, it's not a bad thing-"
"Yeah, just a sec." Steve said, stopping the recording and putting his phone away.
So here they were, sitting across each other, Steve looking exceptionally handsome in his suit, that he kept saying was making him feel out of place. Tony had called beforehand and told Steve to wear a suit. He didn't disclose the location though.
Before that day, Steve had never once mentioned Peter's mother. Never. Not even a clue of her. Tony was under the delusion that there might've been an ugly divorce. But now seeing Steve's condition, he realized even thinking about her had caused Steve immense pain. He wasn't sure if Peter knew about his mother, but he wasn't going to ask or judge any of that.
Tony sighed deeply. "You are absolutely, without a doubt, the most breathtaking view I have ever come across."
"I can't say I'm sorry." The smug smile of Steve's face made Tony kiss him once more. When they pulled apart, Steve asked, "You were going somewhere, I believe?"
"I have a gym installed in the tower, y'know?"
"What's he doing in there?" Tony rushed back into his room, heading for the bathroom door.
Steve had sat on bench not far from Peter and Tony followed. "You okay there?"
A blush swept over Steve's face and Tony considered that a victory. "He's actually a really close friend."
"Tony, I know. That's my point. You can buy him everything that I can't and it kills me."
"What's a hi-fun?"
"See! Even you're not prepared for today. It's a sign."
Yet here he was. A child so comfortably relying on him, resting peacefully on him. And he did not mind it one bit. He looked down at Peter, who had his eyes closed, and gently kissed his forehead. The microwave started beeping and he pressed to the button to take out the bottle.
"Great as always, Mr Stark. What can I get you today?"
He smiled at first which then turned into a frown and gave JARVIS more instructions. The list had loads of names and he didn't have time for all of them.
"If you help, I'll kiss you all you want."
"No. I mean, words, Steve. Words. Do you know what you mean to me in words? Actual words. From me."
"Sure."
"You wanna shake hands?" Tony shook hands with the bot to show how it would be if Peter wanted to do it too. Peter brought his chubby hand forward and Dum-E grabbed it in his claw and moved it gently up and then down. Peter shrieked in excitement. When Dum-E released his hand, Peter wiggled his legs which, Tony had learned by now, meant to put him down. When he did so, Peter ran the few steps they were away from Dum-E's body.
Steve shook his head. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
It wasn't like he had volunteered... Okay, maybe he did. But he had no other choice.
"Are too."
The dinner went by swiftly. After the discussion, that Tony was glad and extremely proud to have won, Steve slowly became more and more relaxed. Tony was patting himself on the back every time Steve laughed, smiled, showed his appreciation for the taste of whatever he had tried. Had Tony fucked up his little speech, Steve might not be enjoying himself. Hell, Steve might've just walked out and went straight home. Might 've went on a full rant to Bucky about how much of an asshole Tony was. And after hearing some things about Bucky, Tony didn't think he would've liked that conversation with Bucky if the man decided to show up on Tony's doorstep demanding answers, had it been limited to a conversation.
"I knew her since we were kids. We played together. We grew together." Tony didn't dare interrupt with a question no matter how ever many were circling his head. "At the time, she was the best thing ever for me. I loved her. She was my best friend. Me, her, Bucky. We were a team. And then..." Steve stopped to sniff and rub his nose. Taking in a shaking breath, he continued.
Tony smiled at Steve.
"My assistant."
Steve didn't jump in like Tony, he just lowered his legs in and slid in the water. "Boohoo! No fun." Tony complained.
"Lab, JARVIS." He said, entering the elevator. The doors closed.
They were a family together.
"I was never able to take care of a kid. She had a good enough job to do so. She told me I didn't have any responsibilities towards Peter, that I didn't have to worry about him, since she knew well enough that I could barely keep my own stomach full at the time and I didn't want a kid. But I was also the one she said would look after Peter after she..." He sighed heavily. "Made sense. I was the biological father. So I got two jobs, rented an apartment with a friendlier neighborhood, Bucky helped a lot, he really did. We both just tried to make ends meet.
"Oh, thank god." Tony kissed Steve. It was indeed a beautiful night, just as beautiful as the glowing sky.
Steve nodded, eye flooding again but not a drop fell. "She was. She really was." His voice so thick. "She was brilliant too. Very confident. Knew her worth. Helped me a lot through my weak childhood, when I was skinny and small."
He rushed out of the room and looked around. "JARVIS, C'mon, buddy. Tell me I didn't lose the kid."
"Yes, you can. Only if you're nice."
"No! You can't eat that!"
"Just because you can give me all of this, doesn't mean you should every time. It's not right. I can't give you all this back, and you- you know it."
And another thing. To the public, Tony Stark was a billionaire. He was a playboy. He was heartless. He was worthless. People would imagine him to be just like his previous self. To hell with whatever Tony had done to better himself, those acts didn't matter, they didn't hold much weight. And one of Tony's countless flaws (ask him and he'll tell you they're countless) was his massive insecurity. It was colossal.
Steve was sat back on the sofa, clearly really pleased with the view. He had a smile on his face that was radiating with affection.
"He just ate." Steve, being the only adult in the house, stated.
Tony jumped into the pool making Peter squeal in delight and clap his hands. When Tony surfaced, shaking his head and pushing the wet hair back, he asked, "Ready, kiddo?"
He entered the park and looked around. Nothing caught his attention. He kept walking, keeping his pace steady and his eyes wandering everywhere his line of vision could reach.
"I think it would be more than okay." Steve whispered, already moving in.
So here Tony had Peter in the elevator going down while Steve was at work, his prideful self rather working his ass off than to take Tony's money. Tony had decided not to push it.
"Well, aren't you a charmer?" Steve smirked. He kept his cool despite the blush all over his face, Tony will give him credit for that. Tony loved to do that, make Steve blush, it was an incredible site, and he usually got flustered. Seeing him keep it together was worth a praise. "I see you've met Peter's leg's acquaintance."
"Where did you get him?" Peter asked, now touching the cold, metal body.
"Whatever." Tony grumbled, crossing his arms. He slumped back on his seat, looking out of the window, not wanting to look at Pepper to make a point. He also was sort of mourning the loss of the blond beauty he had just missed. At least he knew where to find him if he ever wanted to meet him. Which he did.
"No. No, no, no, no. Do not put this all on me. This is completely your fault. And you let him, JARVIS?"
"Steve, breathe, okay? I think I've got this. J, you've recorded that, right?"
"C'mon, Peps. Don't drag him into it. First Happy, and now J? Quit bringing the kids into our fights."
Steve came out of the bathroom, walking fast, but stopped just like Peter did. "What're you doing on the floor?" They both had the exact same confused expression on their faces, it was adorable.
"I picked it out myself!" Oh, Peter just loved encouragement.
He didn't recognize his own voice. But that was not his concern. What he focused on was Steve's immediate change of expressions. Crestfallen to hopeful.
Get into action, Tony! Say something.
Tony stopped to look at Steve.
"No, you don't." Steve interjected.
Peter was put to bed and Tony grabbed Steve's hand and lead him to the library. He pulled him to the large glass door to the terrace outside.
"I have a yacht." Tony nodded.
Tony sprung straight. His eyes open wide. He had to thank JARVIS later for knowing Tony's priorities. Maybe an upgrade was due. Maybe.
"It is." Steve nodded, holding Tony's wrists while his hands still held his face. "It's mesmerising to watch it work. Never seen anything as brilliant."
It was discovered earlier on that Tony clearly felt something strong for Steve and it only grew the more he spent time with the guy. He was willingly looking after the guy's kid, for god's sake. Tony Stark did not just offer people to look after their kids. Sure, he'd pay someone to do it, but never himself.
Steve didn't say anything, just cried his eyes out. It took a while for him to calm down, when he had bawled every drop of water out of his body, he slumped onto Tony, his own body completely out of power.
"Oh. It's okay, we can reschedule-"
Tony reached across to hold Steve's hand. "You never lost this one, darling."
Tony was feeling like he was in the seventh heaven last night, it was absolutely amazing. Just like he had always expected. Surely, Steve hadn't let him down. But come to think of it, had Steve even let him down there, he didn't think he'd have minded. Steve radiated that positive energy that Tony desperately had needed all his life, and now that he had it he was not going to let anything take it away from him without a fight.
When they reached Steve's apartment, Steve turned to Tony. "I had a great time, Tony. And I wanted to apologize for being a bit too... stuck up. I didn't mean to, it's just happened and I was overwhelmed-"
"You're sorry?" Peter nodded."And I'm better than JARVIS?" Peter nodded, giggling. "No, no , no. Say it out loud. Let JARVIS hear. I want him to hear."
"I said I would, didn't I?"
Steve smiled at him, eyes were still sad, but Tony could see he appreciated Tony lightening up the mood. Surely he was incapable of it himself. "Rain check?"
"A mess."
He saw the file change before him and a new list appeared.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Tony, I..." Steve sighed in relief. "Thank you, you have no idea how big of a pressure you just raised off me. I- thank you." He pulled Tony into a tight hug.
"You know, a 'thank you' wouldn't pull something." Pepper called behind him.
He still sounded unsure but Tony didn't give time to back out and ordered his own. Cindy scooped their ice creams into cones, as per Peter's hopeful wishes.
Peter copied to his best toddler-like abilities, which were good enough, and the list disappeared, making Peter jerk back and cling to Tony in shock. A second later, the screen faded in with the Walt Disney logo appeared followed by the Pixar logo.
"Thanks for teaching my son to eat healthy." Steve said in a monotone, putting back the jar, taking out the baking powder.
"Tony, what's wrong?" Pepper asked upon reaching him.
"Wow!" Peter smiled widely. "Can you make a rocket ship too? Like in my book?"
"We really need to work on your bigger words." Steve commented.
"Not that bad? You stalked him? You pulled out his personal information. That's violation of privacy, Tony." Yeah, Pepper was disappointed.
He groaned loudly, his voice echoing in his workshop. "J, why can't I just chill for a minute?"
"Why? H-how? Did I seemed distant? I didn't mean it, I swear. I don't want to break up, Tony. I swear."
"Yeah, just about." Tony looked at him and saw Steve roll his eyes at his answer, approaching them.
Tony grinned widely, like a Cheshire cat. "Yes, you did and you can't take it back. Ha!"
Tony did have to get his work done but he also didn't want to stop listening to Steve talk. But he knew better. They both said their goodbyes and Tony remained sat on his chair.
"Peter..."
"That's the plan." Tony said easily. Steve's smile grew wider, his eye's warmer. "You hungry?"
Pepper's amused expression made Tony almost drop the act. But who was he kidding? Pepper knew him front, back, left and right. There was no hiding.
"Daddy!"
Yes. Yes. With the intensity of a thousand burning and dying stars. "Yes."
"Zip the sass, buddy. I get it."
"It's great to see you too, Steve." Tony smiled warmly and Steve mirrored it.
"Nope!" Peter exclaimed from his child seat in the back.
He brushed his fingers over Steve's blond hair. Then ran the tips of his fingers across the side of his forehead, then the cheekbone, and down the cheek. The skin was really soft under his own. He pulled his hand back and got comfortable. He then reached his hand to tangle with Steve's hair, unable to stop brushing through those soft strands.
"Steve-"
"I am your other way, sweetheart. You shouldn't worry. Peter's safe with me."
"I see you, baby." Steve said, swimming nearer.
"Why is his name dummy?"
"Does he know the recipe?" Tony asked Peter, jokingly. When Peter nodded, Tony gasped turning to Steve, dramatically. Steve just rolled his eyes and kicked Tony under the table. Tony retaliated the move and Steve smiled at him, grabbing his free hand in his. He squeezed it and Tony brought it up to kiss Steve's. Peter raised his hand up to Steve demanding a kiss from his father too, not liking how he wasn't one of the recipient.
"I don't know, you tell me. You're all... stiff."
Better to rip the bandage off.
"I don't know what you're talking about." Steve snorted at that. "Let's go to the kitchen, I'm hungry."
Steve looked at his boys again, a smile finally breaking onto his face, full toothy and all. "You guys are something else."
"You'll know soon enough, buddy." Tony repeated for twentieth time. Since when did he get so patient?
"Yeah, you are. I'm glad."
He picked Peter up and brought him to the kitchen, the bottle from his bag in his hand. He got the milk from the fridge and somehow managed to open the bottle and pour milk in it while Peter had slumped his head on top of his shoulder, seeming completely out of power of his own. He closed the bottle and put it the microwave.
"Please play, JARVIS!" Peter exclaimed again and JARVIS complied.
"If you're not down within fifteen minutes, I'm coming in there and dragging you by the ear to the orphan house without a care of whatever you have on. I bet it would look great on the front page of everything that exists."
"Uh...cookie dough."
"You're statistics are wrong, dear. I mean I've been called sexy, but they haven't seen you."
Tony instantly brought his hand to Steve's hair and started gently stroking the strand, having Steve let out a soft, quiet hum. Steve sighed deeply, looking at the stars.
Steve looked at Peter and Peter exclaimed, "Movie!"
He swallowed.
Tony didn't know what to say, he just kept his hand going through Steve's hair, as if to make him aware of his presence.
"She's not your boss, I am." Tony interjected, betrayed. "You're stealing my kids now?" Tony accused Pepper.
fine. Not at all. Tony hadn't loved someone in so long, hadn't loved someone who didn't turn out to stab him in the back. He had no experience loving someone who actually reciprocated the feeling. Not his parents, not his godfather, not a friend, not even a romantic partner. There was an irrational-bordering-rational fear that clinged to his every breath that if he loved someone, that would give them the power to hurt him. And he had been hurt uncountable times. And that's saying something, Tony is all about math. He knew how to damn well count.
Tony opened the door for Steve. "Sorry, I don't have a child seat."
"Yeah. Of course. Sorry about the call."
got this.
"And leave my kid unprotected while in a car with you and your oh-so shrewd mind?"
"So you're gonna try any of these?" Tony said after nodding.
"Pep, it's not that bad-"
He was thinking of doing the next date the typical, traditional style. A classy dinner to impress. He just wasn't sure if Steve would like that, though. So far, all that he had concluded of Steve was that he was extremely uncomfortable and edgy when surrounded by riches. That would potentially become a problem considering Tony is one of the foremost names of the richest people on the planet but he'll come around to handle that with Steve. Or if they do start getting serious, they will, of course, have a talk.
"He cut my heart open, Steve. With no remorse. I think that deserves a visit from the tickle monster."
"Tony?" Great. Now Steve's concerned.
Eventually, when Tony had guided Peter's hand and slid it across the projection, the toddler let out a squeal of delight and clapped his hands excitedly, proceeding to repeat the action himself this time.
Pepper looked at Tony and shook her head. "Just because you have the means-"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up. Steve, I'm not trying to make you feel inferior-"
"Throw?" Peter had come to them and requested Tony.
"I'll be in the lab. So don't disturb me." Tony said, leaving the car and already making his way to the elevator.
Steve, on the other hand, hadn't been as appreciative of the gesture. He had smiled for the boy, ruffled his hair, told him he can play with it when he's home and Peter, being the most rule-abiding three year old in town, had agreed. Though there was a tiny frown on his face which was soon enough removed when he went to the sand box.
"That's right! It's a fancy boat. You intelligent little boy!" Tony praised, knowing very well that he himself had taught him that.
On instinct, Tony's mind rushed to an image of Pepper but that was ridiculous. Pepper was not responsible for his personal calls. Then Tony's oh-so-genius and sharp mind, as professed by Rolling Stone, Forbes, Time, GQ, and so, so many more, came to remember his old buddy, JARVIS.
"Why him specifically then? Why not any one else?" Now Pepper was just having fun looking at Tony's face as he tried to calculate a response.
Tony grabbed Steve's hand. "I know. But you weren't comfortable, not at first. But I'm glad that you managed to stay and I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. I know I did. A lot. And... I wouldn't mind another go at it either. If you're up for it." He squeezed the hand gently.
Peter stopped walking and fisted his hand on his sides, looking at Tony, a large angry pout on his face. Trying to be intimidating, Tony assumed. The man held his hands up in surrender. "Alright, buddy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, though, you're daddy is always right. So you should always listen to him, okay?" Tony raised a finger at him.
“Hey, hey woah buddy. Calm down kiddo. I’m okay bud. I promise. I’m not hurt. I’m okay.” Tony said.
“You okay buddy?” Tony asked as he felt his son wince.
All three heads snapped at the sound of Steve’s voice and they looked at their papa. Peter paused the movie and looked over to Steve. Damian got up off of the sofa and ran towards Steve. Steve bent down to pick Damian up which let out a squeal from him.
“You sure?” Sam said.
This idea was given by SxrgentBxrnes. Thank you for this idea. Really loved it and enjoyed writing it and I hope you like the way it turned out.
Tony made his over to his son’s side before combing a hand through his hair.
Liam opened them up and smiled at what was written. He smiled at the sweet messages and how beautifully it was decorated.
Steve hummed and grabbed the medicine that Bruce had given them, opening it up and taking out a teaspoon and giving it to Damian. Damian swallowed the medicine before cuddling back into Tony’s chest being mindful of his nose.
They all smiled back and shouted one last “happy birthday” and Peter knew that this was indeed the best birthday ever.
“Boss.” Jarvis said.
Damian squealed and giggled as Liam tickled his cheeks with kisses
“Look bub. I promise you that it’s not gonna hurt that much alright. All you’re going to feel is a little pinch and then it’ll be over before you know it yeah.” Steve said.
“Yeah pops. I’m okay. It’s just a bit too tight.” Liam said with a smile.
A couple of minutes later one of the older boys headed his way and he sighed.
Steve gave Bruce a weak smile and Bruce returned one back.
“Well hello Stark. Don’t you like your surprise?” The kidnapper said.
—————
Liam looked up at Steve and bit his lip nervously, not knowing how to tell his parents about what had happened.
“Thank you.” Peter croaked out as he took the pills and downed them.
“I’ll go.” Liam said stepping up and facing doctor.
So for this prompt the stories will be centered around the superfamily but what I have done is I’ve added two more characters to the family who were also adopted by Steve and Tony. Even though it is centered around them, you can add other MCU characters to the prompt if you would like but they won’t be the main center of focus.
“Thanks guys. This looks amazing.” Peter said.
“O-okay.” Damian whimpered.
“Hey kiddo. You ready?” Tony said.
“Thanks dad, thanks pops.” Peter said.
“I can give him some fever reducers if you want me to.” Ms. Lee said.
“Oh come on guys, I’m only injured. It’s not my birthday or anything.” Liam said as he laughed.
The cafeteria went silent and he could feel all eyes on him before everyone started to laugh. He bit his lip from crying out and quickly got up.
He walked down to the kitchen to see if his husband needed any help. He made his way to where Steve was, looped his arms around his waist and pressed a kiss to his neck.
“Woah kiddo, it’s just me.” Steve said as he steadied his son so he wouldn’t fall off.
“Of course pops. I’ll keep an eye on him while you guys get everything ready.” Liam said.
Steve clenched his jaw tightly before growling. What did this sicko want to do with his son?
“Good morning. Need any help?” He asked as he put his chin on Steve’s shoulder as he watched him cook.
“Are you sure bud? You know I’m here if you ever wanna talk about anything.” Steve assured him.
“I-I know but aren’t you like disappointed in me? I let you guys down and now it’s like-,” Liam started before getting cut off.
“While we don’t mind it, you need to get your rest so your ankle can heal. How about you guys finish your snack and you rest while Peter and Damian get started on their homework. And then when you wake up, we’ll watch a movie and have dinner. Sounds good?” Tony said.
“Let’s start with checking your height and weight. Just stand on this scale as straight as possible. Good.” Dr. Richards said.
His thoughts were interrupted when he heard a knock on his door.
“No so will you just fuck off.” Damian retorted back.
Tony growled under his breath and said, “I swear to god I will find you and I will kill you.”
“What’s wrong babe? You gotta tell me, tell us, please sweetheart.” Steve said.
“Dada, I be good.” Damian said.
“Hey, hey buddy listen. I promise you that dad’s fine yeah. He’s absolutely fine. He’s okay. Nothing’s wrong bud. Dad’s fine.” Steve said.
“I mean I wouldn’t mind. We got three more chefs in the house.” Tony said laughing along as well.
“My son would never start a fight. He’s not like that.” Mrs. Green said.
“Why can’t you understand that no means NO?” He shot back at her.
“It’s okay dad. Just breathe. 1 2 in 3 4 out.” Liam said.
“Wow Dami. Thank kiddo. This is amazing. Where’d you learn to draw like this bud?” Steve asked.
“You can tell us if she did kiddo. We’ll take care of it.” Tony spoke.
“Dami, is that really what he said?” Steve asked.
They waved back and stayed there until Tony’s flight took off before getting in the car and driving home. Peter fell asleep in the car before they arrived. When they did, Steve scooped his son in his arms, walked up the stairs to his room and set him down in his bed. He was glad that they had eaten before going to the airport since it was so late when they got back. Steve changed his clothes before climbing into bed next to his son and falling asleep.
Liam nodded his head and let the doctor wrap the cuff around his upper arm. Liam felt the pressure of the cuff tighten and he winced a bit. Wow did that hurt.
Peter felt his stomach turn at the smell and took a deep breath to calm himself down. He grabbed 2 pancakes and put them on his plate. He ate slowly and when he had enough he stopped eating and pushed his plate away.
“Clothes off, get on the bed and spread your legs for us sweetheart.” Steve said.
To make this as easy as possible here’s what you need to give me for your prompt:
“Hello sir, is everything okay? Did Peter do something?” Tony asked.
Tony’s jaw clenched. What? What in the fucking world? Who tells a 11 year old to man up and take a hit? Oh hell no. Tony was not going to let this slide. He got up, took his son’s hand and walked into the principal’s office and sat down in the chair, keeping Damian on the other side of him.
Steve nodded at that, his anger flaring up even more. He was going to make that girl pay for doing this to his baby boy. Nobody got away with hurting his boys. “Does it…does it hurt kiddo? Do you want uncle Bruce to make sure you’re okay?”
“Woah, that’s huge.” Bucky said as they all stared at the board with wide eyes.
“Hey Pete.” Ned said.
“Bye dad, bye pops.” They both shouted.
“I’m bored. What else can we do?” Peter said.
“Yes sir.” The class said in unison.
“Pete kiddo it’s just going to last for a couple of seconds bud. All Dr. Richards going to do is swab your arm with antiseptic, put the needle in, take it out and then put a bandage over it and the feeling will be gone in a couple of hours, just like dad said.” Steve explained.
“Hey bub, you need something?” Peter asked crouching down.
Steve groaned softly and opened his eyes, trying to adjust to the light. He looked around the room to see where he was. He could move freely. His hands and legs weren’t strapped to the table. Was he, was he not there anymore, he thought in his head. He looked over to his side to see his husband and son sitting next to him. He tried to sit up but his back hurt really bad that he let out a loud “oh fuck” which startled Tony and Peter out of their slumber.
“That’s a brilliant idea Rhodey Bear. You’re level of genius is amazing.” Tony said.
“You just suck at it Li.” He said.
When both of them got to where they were, the first thing Steve noticed was Liam’s bandaged hand. He sat down next to his son with Damian on his lap.
“Steve you okay?” Bucky asked.
Steve and Tony felt their blood boil at the thought of someone making their son feel that way. Who the hell did this guy think he was calling their son names and telling him that he was a piece of trash? And the nerve of him to cheat on Peter and then tell him this, oh hell no.
“Okay sweetheart, that’s okay. I’ll put the rest in the fridge and you can eat it later if you’re hungry. Sound good?” Steve added.
He let out a sigh and made his way to the locker room to change. He quietly made his way to his locker and began to change his clothes, hoping and praying that none of the older kids saw or paid attention to him.
When Liam didn’t get a reply, he frowned. That’s weird. Dad always replied no matter how busy he is.
They all burst into a fit of laughter and continued playing the game.
Liam nodded his head and pressed himself closer to his papa. Steve tightened his arms around his son and they stayed like that for a bit. He pulled away and gave his papa a smile. Despite the worry, Steve smiled back at his son and ruffled his hair.
Tony twisted the door knob and they entered Liam’s room. Their son was laying down on his bed with his back turned towards the door, snuggled under the blankets. Making their way to his bed, they both sat down.
Damian pouted but snuggled into Liam’s chest. Liam chuckled at his little brother’s behavior and ran a hand through his hair. Peter was about to speak up but was cut off when their dad entered the room.
Peter scooted over on the bed so he could make room for his papa. Steve lifted the blankets and climbed in, putting it over the both of them. Peter snuggled into Steve’s chest and let out a content sigh. Steve kissed Peter on his head, wrapping his arm around his son and ran his hand through his hair. Soon Peter fell asleep in the comfort of his papa’s arms and a couple days later he was feeling better and being his usual self.
“Steve I’ll be there in 30 minutes. Hey bud,  I’m okay yeah. I’m perfectly fine, I promise. I’m coming home okay kiddo. I’ll be home before you know it.” Tony said.
“Thanks.” Liam mumbled as he took it and put it on his hand, letting out a sigh as the coolness dimmed down the burning.
Steve just rolled his eyes but it warmed his heart to know just how much his friends and family cared about him. Tony examined Steve’s facial expression before speaking up. “Steve if it’s really hurting you badly then you know you can tell us right. No one’s gonna judge you babe. You can tell us. We’re all here for you”, Tony said as he squeezed Steve’s hand in his.
Steve chuckled at his son’s excitement and went to go put his shoes on. He grabbed two water bottles from the fridge and waited for Liam to get back. Once Liam came back down, Steve handed him a water bottle and Liam thanked him. They headed out the door and began to start on their run.
“D-dad can you c-come p-pick me up?” Peter sobbed out.
“Water, please.” Peter said.
“Thanks guys, these are beautiful.” Liam said hugging both of them.
By now everyone had made their way over to where Tony was at. When they saw what was happening their blood boiled as well to see the bruises and cuts that littered all over Steve’s skin.
“Wait, there’s a bigger monopoly board?” Clint asked confused.
This chapter turned out to be way longer than I expected but oh well.
Peter let out a choked sob as he tried to speak. His bottom lip trembled while he tried to calm to himself down.
“Ned, I’m gonna need your help to carry him to the nurses office. Someone else call the nurse and say that Mr. Jones is bringing in a student who has just fainted.” Mr. Jones said.
“Great, just remember I’m here to answer any questions.” He said one last time.
Liam did as he was told, repeating the actions for a couple more minutes.
“Yeah Tones, over here.” Bruce yelled from where he was doing some calculations.
—————
After the couple of minutes Peter ran to his dads and said that he needed to use the restroom.
“Ewww, it’s the loser.” Matt said when he rounded the corner and spotted Damian.
Peter grinned back and they started to clean up the kitchen. Liam watched his brothers work together and smiled. Peter and Damian cleaned the kitchen and once they were done they headed towards the common area to watch a movie and enjoy their pizza until their parents came back.
Liam and Peter both looked up when they heard their little brother come in. Damian stopped and looked at was going on, his tiny face scrunching up in confusion. Both brothers held back a smile at how cute the look on Damian’s face was.
“Alright good afternoon class. I’m gonna let today be a free day and let you do whatever you would like. Just don’t fight and play fair. Got it.” The coach said.
It took Tony 10 minutes to drop Damian off at school. Damian got out the car, said goodbye to his dad and made his way inside the school. He walked his way to his classroom and sat down. Soon other students filled the class and the teacher began her lesson. The classes went by quite fast and then it was lunch time. Damian made his way to the cafeteria with his classmates and got in line for lunch. He grabbed his tray and made his way to a table away from most of his classmates. He knew most of them didn’t like him and thought that he was spoiled just because his parents were well known and rich. He was told often times that he was lying and a pathetic excuse and that no one could love him for who he was. It hurt, of course it did, but Damian was used to the jabs. That’s all he ever heard when he was with his biological parents, but that didn’t mean it hurt less then it already did. He was used to everyone picking on him, getting away with it and calling him an attention seeker.
“Daddy, daddy, daddy, oh god.” Peter moaned and arched his back as he felt the vibrating sensation travel all throughout his body.
“Hey kiddo, I’m just gonna wrap this around your arm and the heat will help with the soreness alright?” Steve said.
Peter knocked on his parents door and waited for them to answer. Steve and Tony were inside their room when they heard a knock on their door. They both looked at each other in confusion wondering who could be at their door at such a late hour. Tony got up and went to open the door and was surprised to see his son standing their, looking flushed.
“Can you come here real quick.”
Tony placed the crockpot of pasta in the middle of the table while Steve and Peter went to get the water jug and glasses. They began digging in and Liam tried his best to keep the food down and the nauseous feeling at bay. Once he felt that he couldn’t eat anymore, he put his fork down and pushed the plate away, grabbing his water and drinking it.
Peter never understood how his papa was able to tell when he was upset. He just always knew it somehow and it still fascinated him till this day.
“Scan complete Captain. Young sir has a fracture which would require a cast. I have already alerted Dr. Banner about the situation and he’ll be waiting for your arrival.” Jarvis said.
Tony chuckled at his oldest son’s behavior and said, “sure but then there won’t be any hot water left when you go take a shower.”
“Hey bubba.” Liam said planting kisses on his cheek.
Steve got them home in less then 10 minutes. When they arrived Steve carried Peter up to their room while Tony went to get Bruce. He found Bruce in their lab working on an experiment.
“I said to stop.” Liam grit out, yanking her hand away and standing up.
——————
Bruce, Thor, Clint, Sam, Bucky, Rhodey and Peter all entered the common floor and Peter ran to his dad’s side.
“I-its okay.” Liam replied.
“He was for a couple of minutes until he fell asleep again on the way home. He has a fever and said that his head and throat were hurting.” Tony informed Bruce.
‘Here we go again.’ Damian thought in his head.
They broke apart when they heard Peter entering the room again to walking his way to Steve’s side and handing him the stuffed bear that he brought. Steve wiped his face and took the bear in his hands.
Now that surprised both Tony and Steve. They never thought that their youngest son would voluntarily ask to get checked by the doctor but nonetheless they were happy to see that he was being so brave.
“No matter what.” Tony repeated, squeezing Steve’s hand in his.
“Tony, it’s important.” Steve said in that voice.
“Alright, alright. Let’s call him yeah.” Steve said as he tried reassuring his son. Peter nodded his head quickly and clung tighter onto Steve.
“Liam, stop, stop, stop!” Damian said as he laughed and wiggled.
Peter didn’t hear what Mr. Jones had said and the teacher frowned and called his name again.
“Hey, what’s wrong love?” He looped his arms around Steve and hugged him.
“He came home a couple of minutes ago from his girlfriend’s house, hugged me and I could feel him trembling. I asked him if something was wrong but he didn’t say anything. Also his smile didn’t reach his eyes and I’m really worried.” Steve told him.
Ned smiled back sheepishly before saying, “uh oops. Force of habit.”
Steve looked Tony in his eyes and nodded his head. “I’m okay, it’s really not that bad. It’s helping, I promise. Just gonna take some time.”
They burst out in laughter again and continued playing. Everything was going well until the lights went out and it was pitch dark.
Liam made his way to the dining table when he heard a squeal of his name.
The needle went away and he felt a bandage being pressed over the spot.
“Alright, who wants to go first?” He asked.
Steve gave Peter a gentle smile and helped him stand up. He flushed the toilet and then helped Peter to the sink so that he could brush his teeth.
“GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM MY HUSBAND YOU MOTHERFUCKER!” Tony yelled as he flew across the room and slammed the piece of shit to the side. He quickly turned off the shock machine before putting up his faceplate and taking off the armored gloves. Everyone else had found where they were by now and they strolled over to the person keeping him away.
“I decided to make sausages and hash browns for breakfast and I saw this recipe for strawberry French toast that looked really delicious and easy to make so I was going to try that. Wanna help?” Liam said.
Steve and Tony froze at what their son had just told them. Anger coursed through them. What the fuck? What in the actual fuck?
“A bit better.” Peter said with a cough.
“Nothing papa.” Damian giggled.
“LiLi hurt?” Damian said looking at his oldest brother with a sad face.
“Oh yeah and then I’ll be the tallest one in the family.” Liam said with a cheesy grin.
“N-no. My uh, my uh, my p-pussy is w-wet daddy.” Peter stuttered out.
“Dad’s right kiddo. He’s not worth it if this is how he’s going to treat you. Not only did he cheat on you but he also verbally insulted you and that is not okay at all. If he loved you kiddo then he wouldn’t have done that. You deserve better buddy and trust me, you’ll find someone when the time comes.” Steve said giving Peter a smile.
“Bud whatever he said is not true that all. What he called you, is not true at all. You’re an amazing person with a golden heart and if he can’t see that, then he is not the right one for you bud. He was way out of line and he has no right to call you any of those words and I want you to know that none of it is true. You’re loved buddy and you’ll find the right one at the right time.” Tony said.
“Bye kiddo, enjoy your date.” Tony said as Peter got out the car.
“Listen. We’re not mad at you. We’re not upset with you. You haven’t disappointed us nor have you let us down. And it’s okay if you didn’t get in. It’s not the end of the world bud. You have numerous other colleges that you can get into and we’ll still be proud of you.” Steve said.
“It wasn’t that bad when I woke up this morning so I didn’t think it was necessary to tell you.” Peter said as he looked down at his hands.
It was another special day in the Stark-Rogers household. It was Peter’s 15th birthday and they were all excited for this day. Peter woke up that morning with a big smile on his face, got ready and made his way downstairs. As soon as he got down he was bombarded with happy birthdays.
“I’m gonna go get the burn relief cream. Hopefully it’ll help a bit more than the ice.” Peter said.
“Hey buddy. You wanna tell me what happened?” Tony asked his son as gently as possible.
“Hey, it’s alright. You can tell us kiddo.” Steve said as he continued to rub Peter’s back.
“Yes coach.” The class said at once.
Peter snorted and said, “thanks Ned.”
“Yeah bud. Just a normal check up.” Tony said .
Liam groaned at what his dad said and threw the blankets off of him as he sat up on his bed.
Steve and Tony had decided that they would send Peter out with Liam while they rest of them set up and get the decorations ready. Liam offered to take Damian as well so that his parents could work without having to worry about watching his baby brother.
“Are you alright?” Mr. Jones asked.
“But don’t worry. We’ll always be here to protect you no matter what.” Steve said.
“I’ll miss you.” Steve mumbled against his lips.
“Of course baby. You are a good boy and you’ll be good for your brothers yeah?” Tony said, pressing a kiss to his head.
“Yeah dad, don’t worry. I will. Bye now.” Peter said.
“But papa, it’s gonna hurt. I don’t want it to hurt.” Damian said.
“Hey, Pete. I’m going to be a bit late. There’s been a bit of a situation with my family that I’m needed for at the moment so I won’t be there until 7:45. I hope that’s okay?”
“We made you something.” Peter said handing him both of the cards.
“No, no Peter didn’t do anything. The thing is Mr. Stark Rogers, is that your son Peter passed out during my class.” he said.
“No me.” Damian said laughing.
“Morning sunshine.” Tony said in a cheerful voice.
“One second, I’ll be right back.” Peter yelled. Peter ran to his room and went to go grab his favorite stuffed animal that he had ever since he was little.
“Oh my god. Pops, this is, this is amazing. Oh my god. I love it. Thank you guys. All of this stuff is incredible.” Liam said.
They all nodded their heads and then walked their way towards the elevator. Once it got up to their floor, Tony carried Liam towards the couch while Steve grabbed his crutches and sat him down in a comfortable position. Liam was grateful for that action. He wasn’t sure if he could walk at the moment.
Peter looked down to see that it was all over and he let out a sigh of relief.
Once Steve and Tony finished tidying up the kitchen, they made some hot chocolate and then made their way to the living room to see all three of their kids spread out on the floor while they colored. They smiled at the scene and sat down on the couch, handing out the mugs. Once everyone had their cup, Steve and Tony snuggled into the couch as they watched the show playing. While Liam colored he felt a shiver go through his body and he took a breath. It didn’t go unnoticed by his parents.
After Peter was tucked in for bed, Tony had wrapped his arms around Steve's neck and kissed the man furiously. Steve kissed back with just as much passion, pushing Tony's back onto the wall of the corridor.
Tony closed his mouth and nodded. "Great. Great. Ice cream it is. Thank god, you love ice cream. Who doesn't love ice cream? Not loving ice cream should be a deal breaker everywhere. Worldwide. Don't you think? I mean it's ice cream-"
"Well, glad to know at least one of you has a brain."
"Doesn't my face look like a tragedy. Oh, Peps, please don't make me go." Tony begged. Pepper seemed pretty unfazed.
Tony sighed deeply, rubbing his face. He should've just listened to the voice.
The claw nudged at Tony's arm, wanting appreciation. "Yeah, yeah, I brought you a friend. Be nice."
He turned his face and sure enough there was Steve, looking as angelic as ever.
Tony shook himself into senses. Enough senses to comprehend Happy's words and find the right ones to answer with.
Correction: she was a terrible friend.
"No. Into the car with you."
"Well I'm glad you had someone like that."
"You know I like to take my time."
"You didn't tell me you were coming." Steve sniffed. His voice was rough and deep, his nose and cheeks red, his eyes swollen and his hair a mess. Oh god.
"Yes, Tony. It's not like I'm a virgin, y'know." Steve joked.
"We're... What? We're what?"
Their eyes met again and if Tony had said this before he will say it again, he could and would drown in those mesmerising eyes. Any day, any moment.
Okay, maybe not.
"Pepponi." He pointed at his plate and smiled widely at Tony.
The door closed and Tony started tapping his fingers, trying to calm himself down. "Tell Happy to bring the car around too, would ya, buddy."
"Yeah. No one comes here unless I get them here. And that means only me and Pepper have ever been here. She claimed she needed time away from me because I was too much. Can you believe her? Ridiculous. Anyway, so I need my buddy here."
"Then no hundred scoops."
Steve let out a huff. "Yes, Tony, I know who you are and I've told you I'm not taking advantage of you."
"Do you have any?"
"Hey." Steve might've done it on purpose or this was just in his default settings but he pouted those sinful lips of his, offended. Tony had to refrain from cooing.
"She had never wanted a husband but always wanted a child. So she asked- she asked me if I could donate. For it. She was my best friend, always was. So I did." Oh. "Then she had the baby. The most beautiful baby ever. But she..." Steve choked out a sob. "She got so weak afterwards. So... so weak. Like we were losing her, like she was fading away."
Okay, so a misjudgment could easily be made about him. He loved the kids. Absolutely loved them. They were adorable and so, so lovely. Definitely didn't deserve to be in some orphanage. But Tony was determined to do what he could.
There was no doubt that Steve hadn't recognized him. Tony was willing to bet that Steve knew who he was, and if that was true, probabilities of which reached the sky, he was well aware of his public image. No matter how hard his PR team tried, the damage done by him during his younger days had left a permanent and bitter profile.
Tony walked him to the elevator, not before telling Peter where he was going and ordering JARVIS to tell him immediately if Peter needed anything or seemed the least bit of distressed.
"Sorry." Peter came to him and offered his hand to Tony, palm up. Tony smiled softly and took the hand and shook it lightly.
"You're the best thing to ever happen to me too."
Steve smiled, licked his lips. "Maybe a specific brunette with huge lovely brown eyes could."
Tony put a hand on Peter's head, to keep him close. "That's not a table, dear. You know what a robot it?"
Tony had admitted to not being world's best cook and came clean with having to order in. Steve didn't seem to have any problem with that and Peter had puckered up his face while deciding whether he needed to eat noodles or pizza. When pizza was deemed to be food of choice, the two adults didn't object.
He laid next to him when Peter pushed the empty bottle away, Tony took it and placed it on the nightstand. "Would you like a story, dear?"
He pressed a quick kiss on Tony's nose, catching Tony off guard. "Until next time." Steve winked, the smirk on his face clearly indicating his pleasure of making Tony flustered.
"It's nothing." Smart guy that he was, Steve saw right through his bullshit. Tony squeezed his hand. "I mean it, honey. It's nothing. Everything's fine."
Tony lead him to corner where they were supposed to go. "How do you know he's right if you never know the answer yourself?"
"Please." Peter finished.
"I believe you have upset young Peter, sir." The AI spoke.
"Oh, the kids were fine. The kids were fine, J. Did you happen to get the new list prepared?"
The next day, Peter demanded they bake a cake because he wanted one. Steve always did have a sweet tooth, and Tony wouldn't ever say no to cake. They got the ingredients out, laying them all on the counter.
Tony watched as the child toddled his way to him and raised the blue ball up at Tony. "Matching."
It's not like Tony didn't want to go, he was an orphan kid once too. Not as young as the kids at the house but still an orphan kid.
"Do you know how to swim?"
Steve looked at their faces, two out of three people he loved the most in the world. His son and boyfriend. He looked the mansion, then at the two again and then around them. Tony was biting his lip.
"Not a problem. Between the two of us, I'm pretty sure he'll be satisfied enough."
"Can we get ice cream now? Please?" Eager little kid. Tony didn't mind. In fact, it reminded him of himself when he was young.
"If I may ask, sir, what's this about?"
"Of course, sir." He repeated.
Steve nodded and they pulled out things they wanted in theirs. Tony got the bread out and placed it on the table with all the other ingredients. They made the sandwiches, exchanging a few jokes and few kisses. A lot of kisses.
"Well maybe you need reprogramming."
"Peter!" Steven berated.
, of people. Never has it beaten this fast or this unevenly. It should not be doing so, but here we were.
The curiosity slowly faded away from Peter's face and he nodded. Tony smiled, pleased with himself.
Tony nodded. "A very trustworthy source, if you ask me. But you're a guest, Steve. You're not making breakfast." He moved to go to the bathroom.
"G'morning." Tony mimicked, afraid to break the tender atmosphere.
"Okay, one scoop of that. And the next one, Steve?"
"How long, JARVIS?"
"You do?" Steve had sounded so hopeful, it broke Tony inside.
Tony ruffled his hair, chuckling softly. "Of course, you do. I know you do. But you better keep it up."
"You know, I'm not as credulous as you think."
"I- okay, Tony." Steve didn't sound so assured but Tony decided to let this slide. He had to remind himself, this was the beginning of whatever they had or will ever have. He cannot put all of himself out there on a platter for Steve only to later discover that there's nothing else left of the man.
"Sweetheart," Tony cupped his face. "You're a mess-"
"I think I am hilarious."
Steve turned to look at Peter, his face super close to his son's, respecting his wish to keep this discussion private. "Why don't you tell him yourself?"
It was all over. It was all over. It was too soon.
"Of course. Does he know what today is?" Steve sadly shook his head. "It's okay. He's three. On his own time." Steve didn't look like he agreed but he nodded anyway. "You need someone to be with you when you go to the cemetery?"
Pepper sighed heavily, rubbing her forehead.
Steve released his bottom lip from between his teeth. "Well, what if you realize that you can't get much from me?"
Some voice inside him told him was he was doing was wrong but that was a voice he rarely listened to.
"I'm sorry about that, Steve. I wanted to treat you. And I know how you feel, believe me, I hate pity. But this isn't that. I really wanted to do this for you."
Tony kept his eyes on Steve's, not wanting to say something wrong and suddenly ruining Steve's mood. He tried to breathe in, a deep one, to calm himself. Then did it again. Then again.
Tony kept sitting, breathing in relief. Now their deal was solid again, as was their business relation. Things whits men demand to emend business relationships, ugh. Tony would never do this outdoors again, no matter who says what. Outdoors were loud, and had people. And bugs. And weird smells.
Steve chuckled, in delight, much to Tony's appeal, and nodded. "Isn't that one a little too old?" He raised a brow.
Steve shrugged, getting some eggs for himself. "I wouldn't mind giving some."
"I'm great. How are you? Not gonna walk away today, are you?"
"I...uh, I think we should be heading back." Steve said picking Peter off the ground and into his arms. Tony saw the muscles there flex. Those were some massive arms. Tony had to resist the temptation of running his fingers across the skin. It looked so soft.
"No excuses, Tony. You wanted to go so bad that you invaded his privacy. Maybe this will be sort of like a punishment. You know you'd deserve it if it was one."
It was the blond guy, Steven, a fact that he should definitely not know, who looked down at the toddler. "Are you gonna finish it all?"
The sheets were all wrapped around him, like a cocoon. He blinked open his eyes, everything hazy. He closed them and felt around the bed but found nothing but sheets and pillows. He frowned and opened up his eyes again. The bed wasn't as warm has he had wanted.
"It's alright, baby, it's alright."
"Daddy met him?" Peter asked, peeking out. Tony nodded. Peter hesitantly, yet very bravely, turned his face to see the bot.
Tony told Steve about how he had Pepper and JARVIS to thank for everything he was today. About how Pepper was much more than an assistant, made sure to mention Pepper's preferable term 'babysitter'. That had made Steve laugh. He told that he was never close to his parents, but he had always had a butler while growing up. And once after his death, Tony felt the loss of a parent that he didn't feel when his actual parents passed. That was when he made an AI and had given him the name JARVIS, his butler's namesake. Steve had smiled sadly at that.
Steve looked at him, mouth finding words to say. "Tony, this is-"
But he didn't say it. Not yet. Insecurity was a very close and old friend of his. Always tugging at his sleeve, always a step ahead of his guts, always looming at every corner of his brain. He could not risk what he had with Steve by saying that word.
"That can be arranged as well." Tony smiled, pulling Steve close and joined their lips.
. Accompanied by a kissy face and a thumbs up emoji.
"Me too." This was pleasant. Tony was proud he wasn't making a fool of himself. He didn't need that. In order to charm sweet Steve here, he would have to bring his A-game to the table.
"Of course, we can. I've got a car waiting just outside to take us there. You ready?"
Tony handed his card when the bill came in, without looking at it, and making sure Steve didn't get a glimpse of it either. While they waited for the card to return, he tried to steer the other man's attention. And he successfully did because Steve's nervousness faded again.
"Thank you." He said, before taking a sip of his drink and putting it back in the cup holder because of course there was cup holder.
Steve kissed him and pulled back, walking inside with a pleased grin on his face as he left Tony completely stupefied.
Steve swallowed loudly and slowly got up and sat next to Tony.
"Peter! We don't say things like that to people. Apologize." He turned to Tony, with an apologetic look of his own. "I'm sorry about him-" His expressions turned into recognition. "Uh, sorry." He nudged Peter.
While Steve, bless him, look even more bewildered. "What? No, no rocket ships. Sorry, Petey, but no." He added when Peter became sad.
Pepper looked at Tony, deciding whether to believe him or not.
"I did?" Steve nodded. "Good, good. You do. You absolutely do."
I hope you liked it.
"Good morning." Steve whispered.
"Then what are you waiting for?" Tony asked. Steve raised an eyebrow and cannonballed into the pool. Tony let our a surprised laugh and turned around in the pool. Steve quickly swam to Tony underwater and emerged from underneath, wrapping his arm around Tony's waist. Tony did the same with the other's neck.
"You do?"
Steve's face slowly broke and tears poured out of his eyes, lowering head to hold it in his hands. Tony didn't waste time in coming closer and wrapping his arms around Steve's trembling body as his boyfriend wept. He brought Steve's head to rest his shoulder. He rubbed Steve's back, pressed kisses on Steve's head.
When the evening passed with Peter loving his new friend and Tony happy to watch from the side, only occasionally having to step in. It was interrupted when JARVIS spoke. "Sir, Mr Rogers has arrived and is on his way to your floor."
"I did say if your father allowed."
When Peter nodded, they started discussing what they wanted and what they could get that wouldn't be unacceptable by a three year old. Peter ran off to play with his toys that had found their permanent place now in Tony's home when Tony told JARVIS to call in for the orders. Steve had miraculously agreed on ordering from two different places so Peter's demands could be met without them having to comprise, or maybe he was too tired to disagree.
Steve didn't respond, just picked Tony up from under his legs, having the smaller man wrap his legs around his waist. Tony pulled back for a moment. "Will never understand how you can pick me up."
, and Steve had nodded but had Tony promise not to do that anymore. Tony, being the businessman that he was, somehow led Steve to agree that unless something caught his eye and he felt like the specific thing should belong to no one but Steve or Peter, he would not buy it.
He frowned. There should be something there, right? There should be something-
Steve had questioned about how Tony could've possibly made an AI, at such a young age no less, something that seemed like it came right out of those sci-if movies Bucky's always watching. When Tony went into the explanation, that he had simplified for general people, Steve would interrupt with questions. He seemed genuinely interested, which boosted up Tony's enthusiasm.
"Good bot. Now go to your charging station."
Tony shook his head, a soft and loving smile on his face. He leaned down to give his lips another kiss. "No thank you's." He kissed him again. "None."
"You are forgiven. Bed. Quick."
Steve bit down on his lower lip, an act Tony wouldn't mind doing himself. In fact, he would be quite eager. He blinked before smiling warmly. "Alright then. See you then, Tony. If you're not busy."
"What're you gonna do?"
Tony's heart sank. "Why are you sorry?"
"Of course." Tony tried covering up his shock at being asked. If he wasn't ever able to do so with his own father, he wasn't going to let the kid down.
"You... You will?" He sounded incredulous.
Steve was going to break up with him. He was sure. Oh god, Steve had been so good for him. He had made him such a better person, even in the limited time they had spent together. Steve had made him want to be a better man, the best man. Steve was good for him. The very thought of losing him frightened him to death.
"Pepper?" Steve frowned in confusion.
Tony looked at him, breath caught within his closed mouth, not blinking. "Why would anything be wrong?"
Tony turned and saw Steve sitting on the edge of the bed, a small but clearly exaggerated pout on his face. "That is playing dirty," Tony pointed an accusing finger at him but founding himself walking back to the bed to Steve. "That's unfair. It's bad enough that your eyes are irresistible, you just have to abuse my weakness even more, don't you? Really unfair, Rogers. Quite ignoble of you."
"Well, I'm here now." Tony gestured to his own body, head to toe, making Steve chuckle and nod.
"I thought I'd surprise you. Turns out you surprised me. What's wrong? What happened?"
Peter nodded enthusiastically. "I met a robot! Tony has a robot! And we played all day. And Tony made him. His name is Dum-E. With a hi-fun."
"I don't have any place for Peter to stay, Tony! Bucky had to go DC for his job and I don't have a sitter-"
"Would you, I mean, we live quite away, and sometimes don't even get to see each other for a few days. So, would it be okay... I mean, if it's alright with you, and you can of course ask Peter, of course, but... Like, if you wanna- if you want to, maybe, you could... Maybe move in. With me? If you wanna. There's a lot of space and Peter loves to be around and I like having you guys there. So, if you wanna... It's okay if you don't want to but-"
Pepper would never let him back off. And he now no longer could quietly do so without having someone cross their arms at him and shake their head disappointed.
Tony rested his head back on the wall, breathing steadily. Steve hadn't moved in about ten minutes. He wanted to move and see if the guy was asleep or not but he didn't want move and ruin the peace Steve had finally found.
Every single time the man was asked, the answer was always a welcoming and a sweet, sweet affirmation.
He had to clear his throat first. "Yeah. Fine." He managed a smile. Years of training for the tabloids coming in handy once again. Steve seemed to not buy it though but didn't say anything either and leaned back towards Tony, facing the screen.
Tony would've never thought he would ever have anything close to a family. He had never had a good relationship with his parents, never had any friends in school as he was brilliant enough to skip years, that meant him being the youngest in his class, no one wanting to be with the 'kid'. He would say his childhood butler Jarvis was as close to a parent figure he ever had, he would confidently say that his love for him was never questionable, even if he was technically being paid to be around Tony. He had Pepper, but the same case was there, the payment every month, reminding him that the people around him weren't around for free.
The tall, blond, and handsome had a toddler in his arms who was saying something that obviously was the best thing the guy had ever heard if his concentration and reactions were anything to go by.
"Yeah." Tony sighed. "I know you're tired-"
Steve had seemed tense the whole hour he was there. Now with him in the kitchen, Tony had time to collect himself. All he could think about was if he had fucked up somewhere along the way, wouldn't be the first time he'd done it. He tried thinking hard, it just didn't seem to help. Oh, where did he go wrong?
you are tired so we don't have to go out tonight. We'll order in. Sound good?" Steve struggled to do so but nodded eventually. Tony turned to Peter. "You hungry?"
"Vanilla."
"Good." He declared.
Steve closed his eyes, laid his arm on Tony's lap. "Sure."
Tony didn't think much of Steve's statement at first, but then lying on his bed that night, while reminiscing the evening, a thought crawled into his mind. What if Steve was cautious about it because he felt inferior? What if Tony's assurance had not been enough to change that track of thoughts? Sure enough, Tony was never someone to back down. And he will not now either. He still hadn't asked Steve about what he did for a living. He'll get around to it. They still had a second date the coming Saturday.
Peter nodded. "Uncle Bucky told me."
"Petey, lets just sleep without one now. It's-." Steve spoke, a bit of the timid exterior escaping him.
"Yes, I am. I'm a big boy." He claimed.
"Is daddy right, though?" Tony tried hiding his smirk.
Silence.
Steve smiled shyly and,
"Oh." There's that surprised voice again. "Peter's... Peter's good. Thank you. He's great. He's playing with his uncle right now." Tony could practically feel his body be hit with the warm affection Steve used while speaking that last sentence. It was good that Steve had that, a caring brother and an adorable, lovely child. Tony didn't know much else about his family but so far this seemed like something that was immensely dear to Steve. Which Tony was all in favor for.
"I think I said something about ordering in." Tony walked directly to the coffeemaker and started to the brew the well-needed morning coffee.
Tony bend down to pick Peter up in his arms and the toddler wrapped his arms around Tony's neck and hid his face in the hollow. "Now, come on. Don't be like that, Petey. Dum-E is really friendly. He won't do anything to hurt you." Tony said, rubbing Peter's back. "I'm not gonna leave you alone with him, y'know? I thought you would like him. Your daddy thought so too."
"I'm glad." Tony grinned, kissing him once more. "I'm so glad." He kissed him again. "So very glad." He kissed him again. Steve pulled him closer, wrapping his arms around him.
"Of course, you will. You take care of yourself and Peter, okay?"
"Yes. Please." His eyes glued to the screen.
"Be good, okay?" Peter nodded, and Steve grabbed his head and kissed it twice. "I love you."
"He'll learn in his time. Don't worry about it. Didn't I just say he's the smartest one here?" Tony defended, kindly. Steve gave Tony a small grin.
Peter was an ardent soul. Always jumping, always running, always full of life. And expressive. Very expressive. Whenever he saw Peter, he would remember himself as a child his age, having glimpses from here and there. Never would he ever remember his parents being there in those memories. He tried to tell himself that human memories can be flawed, but who was he kidding?
Tony nodded, moving to the trunk, opening it. "Mhmm. We're on a getaway. We wanted to surprise you and Peter was such a good boy keeping it a secret that I might just make him that rocket ship he asked for."
"Nap."
An update every week. xx
But this? This was tough.
"Tony, no. You're not gonna do what I think you're gonna do."
Tony looked at Steve who bit his lip and then gave in. "Whatever you want, honey. Maybe Tony can help you choose."
"It's alright. I'll build you a toy rocket ship. You have one of those?" Peter shook his head, face still supporting a pitiful frown. "Well, I'll make you one. One that can fly and has lights and can even play music and it'll be of any color you want and-"
"Can't believe you both are ganging up on me."
Tony rubbed Peter's back, kissed the side of his head. "Good job, bud." He assured gleefully. He turned to Steve. "We're at my mansion for a get away."
Peter opened his arms for a hug and Steve pulled him in tightly, thank god the kid's hands were wiped clean earlier or else his boss wouldn't shut up about wearing stained clothes to work. The jackass.
Steve turned to Tony with a smile that was half bashful and half proud. "Thank you."
He met Pepper in the kitchen. He wasn't really keen on greeting her since she was apparently at war against him and his irregular sleeping schedule, so he just made a beeline towards the coffee maker, pleased to see a new batch already made and ready for him. Caffeine was the love of his life, he could confidently claim.
They were still only one date in. This was barely a start.
"JARVIS is here too?" Steve asked.
The domestic environment was so overwhelming yet comforting. Tony rarely ever got to have breakfast with people as a family. He cherished every single second of it. The way Steve would cut Peter's pancake for him, having to wipe the syrup dripping down the kid's mouth, the smiles passed along. Tony would trade everything he had to have mornings like this everyday.
for sure what he had always thought of, ever since getting together with Steve, the world could collapse around them but if Steve needed him for anything, Tony would always be present with his best abilities to provide for the man whatever he required.
There on his closet door handle hung his outfit for the date. Pissed as he was about Pepper not taking his side, he could still appreciate the woman's sense of clothing. She picked out a casual blue T-shirt with dark gray jeans. She did not forget his signature jacket. He paired it all up with his blue sunglasses, another one of his signature looks. He pulled on his shoes and looked himself in the mirror, while styling his hair. His hair is not a tragedy, Pepper. And never will Steve think so.
“I’ll be the judge of that.” Bruce said walking over to the bed Steve was in.
“Kiddo, it’s just gonna be a pinch. And then afterwards when you’re done, we can all go for ice cream. How does that sound?” Tony said.
“Alright, but you gotta be quiet okay, or else you’re gonna ruin the surprise.” Liam said.
“We’re playing a game uncle Bucky. Wanna play?” Liam asked.
Laughs erupted through the air as they raced against each other. Sometimes Steve would end up taking the lead while other times Liam would. They continued their run as they still had a bit to go before they were going to run back home. It was at one moment when Liam wasn’t looking ahead and paying attention because his eyes were focused on something else, that he ended up tripping and falling. His foot collided with the rock, ended up twisting and he cried out at the pain, falling down to the ground. Steve stopped quickly when he heard the noise and turned around to see what had happened. He saw Liam on the ground and ran his way over to him.
It was that time of the year when Liam, Peter and Damian were all due for their yearly check ups. Tony had scheduled an appointment with their own personal doctor ahead of time so they wouldn’t have had to wait for hours. So when Monday afternoon rolled around, Steve and Tony both picked there kids up from school and headed towards the doctors office.
Steve sighed and let it go. Damn those puppy dog eyes. He and Liam both got to their feet and started their run back home. Liam did his best to not let his pain show and Steve decided to run a bit slower so that he wouldn’t leave Liam behind. His son was so stubborn at times.
Steve then turned to the nurse and asked, “can we take him home?”
Tony let out a choked sob and buried his face into Steve’s chest. Steve tightened his hold on Tony, running a hand up and down his back while also running his other one through Tony’s hair. He rocked them gently as their children watched them with worried eyes.
Liam bit his lip to keep himself from crying again. He shook his head fast and brought the blankets even further upwards. He didn’t want to talk about it. He didn’t want to think about that at all.
“Yeah babe, what Peter said. You’re not there anymore. You’re with us babe. Please wake up.” Tony said before taking Steve by the shoulders and shaking him.
“No sir.” Liam said.
“I want all of you to back the fuck away from my family right this second. I want all pictures deleted from your damn cameras and phones and I want you gone in the next 30 seconds.” Steve said, staring at them with a fierce look in his eyes.
Damian’s eyes widened as he saw and heard how his classmates put the blame on him. What did he do to deserve this kind of treatment and why was everyone so against him?
And that’s how Peter spent the rest of his day. They played loads of games there was music, food and cake. Everyone was having a good time. Peter was glad that his whole family was here. He was glad to see his friends as well and that he was spending this moment with them. When it was finally time to cut the cake, everyone gathered around to sing happy birthday and Peter once again was reminded of how he had the best people in his life. As the party neared to an end, they played the last games that came in mind. After that game ended, it was time to open presents and Peter was so shocked at the amount of presents that he got, that he really couldn’t believe it.
Damian nodded his head slightly but didn’t meet his dad’s eyes. Tony eyed his son carefully and then asked the next question.
“Oh man that was perfect.” Joseph, the boy sitting next to Carson said.
Peter and Damian nodded and made their way to their rooms, grabbing their presents and making their way towards their parents room behind their oldest brother. Peter opened the door as quietly as possible and peeked inside to see if his parents were awake and found that they were still asleep. Damian ran inside and climbed on top of the bed, sitting on Tony’s stomach.
“Bye babe, stay safe please. Love you.” Steve said as he pecked his husband’s cheek and the corner of his mouth.
“I promise you that you haven’t disappointed us, we’re not mad at you and we aren’t upset with you at all. We love you buddy and you gotta understand that this isn’t the end. You have so many options opened for you and like we said, we’ll be happy and proud of you wherever you get accepted into to.” Steve said.
Liam woke up early this morning as it was a special occasion in their household. It was their parents marriage anniversary and all three of them wanted to do something special for the two people who gave them love, care and a home when they were abandoned by their biological families. Liam made his way to the bathroom and freshened up before making his way to Damian’s room. He opened the door to see that his baby brother was already up, sitting up in his bed and rubbing his eyes.
“Oops, sowwy.” Damian replied.
“I am too. I feel offended. How could you Pete?” Steve said, fake wiping a tear.
“No, I’m good. Thanks pops.” Peter said as he got up and checked to make sure he had everything while he waited for his dad.
“Right this way.” Lia replied.
Liam shook his head again. “She…she didn’t get any further because I-I ended up kicking her so she would g-get off me.”
Both parents chuckled at their oldest son’s behavior. Sometimes they wondered what they did to deserve such wonderful kids in their life.
“That sounds like a good idea. What do you think bud?” Steve asked as he continued rubbing circles on his son’s back.
They all burst out in laughter. Tony wiped his eyes and chuckled. Maybe they did love him just as much as he loved them. Maybe he wasn’t as much of a burden as he thought he was to them. Atleast he knew he was loved by the people that he loved the most and that they weren’t afraid to show him how much they loved him.
He was so close to staying put in his lab, maybe create a new element, just to have an excuse to not go. It wasn't helping that Pepper kept pestering him about it. She claimed it as giving his word and thus it would be odious of him to turn back now. Curse her. Like Tony wasn't kicking himself for showing interest in the first place and now planning on not going.
"How about something light?"
"I'm Tony, by the way." He brought his hand up for a shake, putting on a charming smile that he had perfected over the years.
"You wanna tell JARVIS to play, buddy?"
Tony shook himself and got into action. He decided to take a stroll and if he didn't find Steve and Peter, he'll just go back. At least then he'll be able to say that he did go, he just wasn't able to find them and had no means of contact without his conscience beating him down. Perfect. Absolutely perfect.
"Let's move you!" Tony said before moving Peter across the surface, much to Peter's glee.
Only one chapter to go now.
"Steve." Tony wasn't going to let him divert away from the question. "Why are you crying?"
"That's good, huh?" Tony said and sat next to Steve on the two-seater recliners. "JARVIS, get the pop corn ready. So which one will it be, bud? JARVIS, show the kid movies to pick from." A list of movies came on the screen. "Pick away, kid."
"But, Pep, my watch!"
He scrammed out of bed and looked around the room. Where would a toddler go when he was left unattended? He then slapped himself. Where
With the microwave warming up the milk, Tony reclined himself on the counter, slowly moving his hand across the back of Peter's head. It felt so weird to do so. It felt weird to take care of someone else's kid and not feel weird. He wasn't forced into doing it, he wasn't held at gun point. He was doing it out of his free will. That was what boggled his mind so much. Yes, Steve had a lot to do with it, his feelings for Steve had almost everything to do with it. He was pretty alarmed about how much of an impact Steve had on him.
"Well..."
"He loves chocolate chip."
"You're the one to talk." Steve spoke between kisses.
The pink was back on Steve's face, and, dear god, what a look it was.
"I can't believe how much is above us and yet we fail to see it." Steve said after a while.
A hologram slide came in front of him and he started working. He didn't know why but he needed to find more about that man. He was too intrusive, with the best of heart, mind you, to just sit back and wonder. Not one of his best qualities but he couldn't help it.
Steve shook his head. "No. I was being difficult. It's just... this place is kinda..."
"Can I play?"
Peter nodded, looking around. "There's no one here." He brought his arms up in a questioning shrug.
Tony was left flabbergasted. "Steve, not to sound self-centered but you know who I am, right?"
"No, it's not okay. I tried to tell them but they wouldn't listen. And no one else is available for them either so-"
Saturday came sooner than Tony anticipated. He would be wrong if he said he wasn't dreading it. He was ecstatic, but his nerves were fighting to get the best of him every second of the days that brought him closer to the weekend.
The view was spectacular. A large open land, trees and grass and the open sky. Steve gasped looking at the sky, the sparkling stars all scattered up there like pixie dust. It was so magical yet so real.
"I need coffee." Tony said, going for the coffeemaker.
Peter jutted his jaw up, in a total Rogers way, and said, "I am your number one buddy." It wasn't a question, he stated it. Tony did not get a say in this as far as Peter was concerned. And Tony wasn't going to argue with the kid.
"Daddy, I'm hungry. Can we buy something today?"
"Daddy, can I have two scoops?" Peter said holding out three fingers.
"And for Peter?"
"Well, I'll... I'll see you next week then?" Steve had sounded so nervous and so damn afraid of rejection that Tony had
Tony would guess the kid was no older than three. Four, tops.
"Milk. Right."
"Adorable kid."
"Adorable."
The story seemed to calm Steve back to the way he regularly was. Tony's lull voice was the only sound in the room, apart from Steve's soft giggles in response to the story. The story was more for Steve than for Peter, if Tony was honest. And he was really proud of the outcome; the toddler asleep soundly and his father calm. Mission accomplished for him.
"Sir, Mr Rogers came back. He is currently assisting young Peter."
Surprisingly, Steven asked at the same time. "Here?" He quickly looked embarrassed to have asked that. But if Tony was to be questioned about it, the blush running all over Steven's pale face was immensely adorable.
Steve chuckled. "The, uh, nameless uncle. His name is Bucky."
"Tony." Steve interrupted, making Tony stop mid sentence, mouth open like fish. "Sure. Ice cream sounds great. We love ice cream."
Steve looked up at Tony who was now sitting beside him. "Hey." Steve leaned in to kiss his boyfriend on the lips. "He wasn't much trouble, was he?"
"Not when it's kicking you awake."
"Well... Like I said. Weakness. And you are shamelessly exploiting it."
"Of course, he is! You can't say no to free food, can you, Steve?"
"What?" All the color from Steve's face drained.
They walked to where Peter was sat on the ground, a few steps away from where they were themselves, much to Tony's relief. He expected Steve to be a responsible dad, and he wasn't keen on turning their date into a child search for the poor little kid. There was something about neglectful parents that ticked him off in all the places, it just hit way too close to home.
Tony stayed silent.
Good thing Steve had already given him a key. He walked in and was about to call for Steve when he found the guy on the kitchen floor, back to the wall.
"Dum-E." Peter mimicked. Dum-E raised his claw to 'shake hands'.
Tony discovered that Steve had moved after his mother had passed away nine years ago. About how Bucky was one of his only support in life. About how Steve and Bucky had been inseparable since childhood. He found it hard to believe when Steve had said he was a bony, little weakling when he was younger and how he would always be on the other side of the punch in every fight he'd ever been in. Which was a lot.
"I suppose you're gonna have to prove that to me." Steven smiled at the child who had a determined look on his face that was mixed with the excitement of getting a treat. He paid for the pretzel when the kid spoke. This time he directed his question to Tony, of all beings on planet earth. Tony realized he was still staring.
"You know, you shouldn't buy Peter such expensive gifts, Tony."
"No, it's okay. I'll... uh we'll talk later, huh?"
Steve seemed to be calculating his next move when Peter tugged his arm. "Are we not getting ice cream, daddy?" His voice was so shy and scared of rejection, it was painful to hear. Tony wanted to give the kid every bit of everything he needed and wanted.
Him and Steve had gotten closer since that first dinner date. They met a few more times, sometimes Peter would join them. Steve had expressed his relief concerning Peter's transparent and undemanding amiability towards Tony.
Tony typed to JARVIS on his phone to have two of everything Steve loved from his favorite Chinese place delivered to Steve's address. So Steve will be well fed and comforted and cuddled up by the time the day ends.
Saturday seemed to work out well for Steve that now Tony was sat in front of him in a restaurant, after questions after questions determined to find the best cuisine to Steve's liking.
Steve bit his bottom lip, eyes never leaving Tony's. "I wanted to have sex."
Soon, Steve fell asleep as well, out like a light. Tony knew staring at an unconscious body was considered creepy but he didn't care. Before that he hadn't noticed how stressed Steve actually was. How his normal composure was always tense. Now, having seen the man asleep, he realized this was how he looked like when he wasn't thinking of the issues and problems and responsibilities he had that were burdening his shoulders.
"What an ungodly hour. Are you sleepy?" He asked Peter, who nodded, his head resting on Tony's shoulder. "Alright." Tony picked him up and headed for the bed. "What about you, big guy?"
"Of course, sir." Came JARVIS' voice.
"Um..." Steve looked torn and his hand went to touch his front pocket and it suddenly hit Tony. Steve was a single parent, he gathered, from the lack of the mentioning of Peter's other parent from either of the two. He probably wasn't well off considering him having to send Peter to that daycare. Steve was probably worried about the bill for the treats that hadn't even arrived yet through out the ride. Maybe that's why he was so silent. Tony had to make it right.
"I am hurt. I'm truly hurt, Pepper. First, you disrupt my beauty sleep and now you attack me with such words. I am hurt."
"Hi. Tony. Hi. I thought you weren't coming."
Peter helped with what he could, mostly just helped in keeping Tony busy while Steve did all the cooking. The two played with some of Peter's packed toys, kept Steve company in the kitchen.
Peter slowly climbed onto Tony's lap from Steve's and hesitantly pecked Tony's cheek and climbed down and ran to his previous position on the bean bag. "I guess that's all I get."
(See the end of the chapter for
He pulled out his phone as he made for a different exit than where Steve was headed. He typed in for JARVIS to remind him next Saturday about this and to keep his schedule clear.
"Yeah, that's gonna be a problem. Will you try to be a good kid and try to sleep without it tonight? We have your blankie in the bag, you can cuddle that to sleep." Steve kept stroking his curly hair.
"Yes, you are."
"Uh, I think i left my uh... watch in the men's room." He surreptitiously covered the watch he was oh-so evidently wearing. "I'll be a moment." He held a finger up to Pepper and almost turned to walk the other way when Pepper grabbed his arm.
"I thought you wanted to."
Knowing the name made it a bit weirder. Steven. Steve. The guy looked like a Steven. He looked like a Steve. He wasn't sure which one he went by.
"Of course, sir."
"Sorry! Sorry!" Peter managed to scream out, between his loud chortles. Tony ceased his torture and saw the baby completely red and coming down from his laughing fit, collecting his breaths.
Steve didn't need any payment. None. In fact the guy hated having Tony spend even a dime on him. And there was Peter. The boy was the purest. Never having any clue what Tony's name meant to the whole world, never caring how rich or poor Tony was, never expecting anything from Tony other than his presence and attention.
"Of course. I'm glad. I wanted you too."
Steve looked at Tony to see the other guy already looking at him. Their eyes met and one and the only thing they both were sure about in the entire world was about each other. They could see the love the other had for them, they could feel it radiating off them.
