“Never for you guys. Claire and Kaia coming?”
There wasn’t much of a queue today and Dean was quickly being served. A glance out of the corner of his eye confirmed that the barista was back, his hair as messy as ever. Dean took a deep breath before turning to face the coffee machine.
Dean looked up to see Cas looking at him, that small, soft smile still on his face. The corners of his eyes were crinkled.
To Dean's grief-addled mind, taking on the business had felt like the right thing to do but now, four years on, he felt as if he were stuck in the same wheelhouse.
Before he could say anything to catch the guy’s attention the door leading out onto the street opened and a large flock of middle-aged women entered the shop, each with shopping bags in their hands, the victorious remains of a successful Christmas shopping spree. Dean was forced to take a step back as the swarmed towards the counter. He glanced over at the barista but realised his chance was gone and instead turned to find a table tucked away at the back and hide.
They finished off the pizza in comfortable silence. With Jack no longer sitting between them they both seemed to gravitate to the middle of the couch until their shoulders were brushing with every move. They watched as Jack started pulling things out of the boxes and stacking them in piles that must have made sense to him, although Dean couldn’t discern any sort of pattern.
“I’m glad you enjoyed it, Dean.” Dean could feel his cheeks warming. “I thought it was perfect festive snack.”
“I can probably get you a replacement relatively cheap,” Ash said as Dean re-entered the office. “I know a guy,” he shrugged when Dean raised an eyebrow.
It was a twitter notification about the upcoming Dr Sexy M.D. episode and after reading it and liking it he put his phone away. Or rather, that’s he should have done.
Dean waved to him as Ellen hailed him over to the bar. Sam took this as his chance and escaped from Jo and Charlie with Eileen. Dean watched with a smile as Sam led her over to Bobby and introduced the two. Bobby shook her hand, and Eileen said something to him in a low voice that Dean couldn’t make out. Whatever it was seemed to amuse Bobby. Dean didn’t miss the look of approval Bobby shot at Sam when Eileen looked away, and Dean took a sip of beer while he watched.
“How did you…” Cas’s voice trailed off and Dean took a deep breath.
“I organized it long-distance. I’ve only just moved to the area,” the man explained.
“I’m sure you’re not that bad,” Dean started but trailed off as Cas raised an eyebrow.
Dean could feel his face flushing and he glanced up to see Cas’s gaze fixed firmly on him.
Oh sure, Dean thought, now he interrupts. Jack’s sudden arrival did clear Dean’s mind enough that he realized he’d been sitting there smiling like an idiot at Cas, and he quickly finished his coffee to hide his embarrassment.
“Are you sure?”
“This is so good, Dean,” Cas said earnestly.
“A good idea after all?” Cas asked, a small almost cheeky smile on his face, and Dean, his mouth too full to respond immediately, rolled his eyes.
“Castiel.” Cas was now frowning.
It came as a surprise when the long-awaited knock did come. Dean looked up, confused, until he caught sight of a clock. Somehow two hours had passed, and Cas was right on time while Dean was halfway through relabeling his spice rack. A second knock roused Dean from his shock as Sam came out of his bedroom, his arms loaded with textbooks. He took one look at Dean and rolled his eyes.
“Oh well,” she said instead of pointing out any further how childish he’d been. This was why Charlie was his favourite, Dean thought. Sam would have continued to make Dean regret his actions and twist it until Dean felt guilty and obliged to apologize. Charlie just moved on.
“Do you need a hand?”
“Does he know the truth?” Dean asked quietly. He was almost reluctant to break Cas’s stride, but he couldn’t help himself when he thought of the little boy across the hall.
They wandered back to the apartment building as Cas mentioned to Dean how different Sioux Falls was to Chicago.
“What’s done is done,” was all she said and then scooped up the last bot of egg on her plate.
He rushed into the foyer and past the front desk where Bess was tapping away at the computer while fielding calls. She passed him a pink post-it note as he rushed by with a wave. Her daughter Gertie was playing with a stuffed wolf behind the desk, and she waved up at him brightly. Dean barely managed to wave to her before he’d reached his office and he threw his bag behind the desk. He glanced down at the note and groaned as he read that Donna had called in sick. Without her they were left with only three mechanics, and any thoughts Dean had entertained about an easy day went out the window.
Later that night, as Dean lay in bed texting Cas goodnight, he thought what he’d tweeted wasn’t a lie. It truly had been the best Christmas he’d had in a very long time. Easily the best Christmas, he thought, his lips still tingling hours later from Cas’s kisses. Even if the goat was still standing.
“Alright then,” Balthazar said loudly, and Dean, startled, turned to see him grinning once more. “Now that you’re in safe hands, Cassie, I believe I better run.” He waved over his shoulder as he turned away and left the shop.
for hosting Pinefest which I have had a lot of fun doing.
“What is it?” Dean asked just as his own phone chirped with a new notification. They all turned to look at it. Dorothy was still smirking and Charlie’s eyes were watering slightly. Dean lunged forward, his breakfast forgotten in favour of unlocking his phone only to see beewatcher had mentioned him in another post.
“You okay, man?” Sam asked and Dean seconded his concern as he got a better look at Cas. He was pale and while his hair was dishevelled and he’d clearly been in bed all night, the shadowsunder his eyes spoke of a restless night.
‘Why didn’t you get a sofa?’
His coffee arrived quickly, a smiley face drawn on the napkin which he laughed at before focusing on his phone. He scrolled through, disappointed when he didn’t see a message from beewatcher. He clicked on their profile but there had been nothing since they’d sent Dean their last song.
“Don’t,” he said.
He waved goodbye to Jo before he left and headed home with a pile of paperwork that was going to keep him up far later than he’d planned.
“What?” he asked, his mind still half on his phone until the scent of something burning registered. “Shit!”
It may have been the slight disturbance of Dean talking or the sound of his father’s voice, but it was at that moment Jack sat up, rubbing at his eyes before he caught sight of Cas.
17 Dec
“Gross, Dean,” Sam complained as he claimed his pizza box and grabbed one of the chairs next to Maggie. Despite liking pepperoni, she seemed determined to back Sam up in his devotion to the disgusting pizza. Dean could only shake his head at them while waving the uneaten half of his pizza slice in her direction. She rolled her eyes and pointedly took a slice of veggie pizza.
‘So, is that the fruit?’ Dean asked, nodding towards the bag in Cas’s arms and Cas’s heart sank as Dean’s smile slipped away, once more gearing up for a fight. Instead of answering Cas’s gaze dropped to the ascot once more. Dean’s earlier fiddling had loosened it enough that his throat was exposed, the knot tugged to the side now and Cas’s mouth suddenly felt too dry.
Thankfully, Sam was unaware of what had occurred. His brother had been so wrapped up in preparing for the return of classes for his second year of law school and his shifts at a local bar that he hadn’t even noticed that they had new neighbors. Which was good. Dean wouldn’t have to put up with Sam’s crusade of neighborly gestures nor the bitch faces his brother would send him when Dean begged off those same neighborly gestures. It was bad enough that he had to put up with Charlie’s teasing when he’d explained the situation to her. He definitely didn’t need his moose of a brother chiming in.
“Nothing,” Sam said, raising his hands in surrender. “I was just wondering when you were going to tell me we had new neighbors.”
“You have nothing to be sorry for,” the man said firmly. “I should apologize. I didn’t mean to make such a mess.”
“Hey kiddo,” he said, looking down at the beaming boy. His blonde hair was a mess but his smile was blinding as he looked up at Dean.
“Perfect,” Dean said and watched as Castiel turned away to place their order. The other man had shedded his outer layer and was now in a faded shirt that looked like it would be soft to the touch. It was stretched tight across Castiel’s broad shoulders and Dean found his gaze caught until he felt small fingers tap his hand. He looked down to see Jack had appeared beside him and was gazing up at him.
“If you’re sure,” he started but didn’t get much further as Castiel cut in.
“I…I always liked baking.” The words felt like they were caught in his throat and for a moment he regretted speaking. A handful of seconds later he heard a rattle of a plate and then a warm weight fell on his shoulder. He looked up to find Cas staring at him, his blue eyes dark and knowing as though, somehow, he understood Dean’s reluctance to put into words what had lived for so long inside of him. He had never brought himself to explain even to Sam the truth of his time away. Returning home had meant shelving it, to help Sam, to help the business and Bobby, and if Dean sometimes lay in his empty bed at night wishing for a different life, then that was his burden and his alone. But now, with Cas watching him so earnestly in the dark, the words seem to rise from his chest, waiting for him to open his mouth before spilling into the air between them.
“I am.” He said it firmly, as though there was no room for doubt. Dean felt rather warm all of a sudden but couldn’t stop his smile from growing as Castiel dialed the number of the local pizza shop. “Pepperoni alright?”
Instead of waiting around he decided to make himself a full breakfast complete with crispy bacon before he dived into housework. While waiting for his second pot of coffee to finish he put a load of washing on, humming Metallica under his breath. He poured himself another mug and began scrubbing down the kitchen just as Sam woke up. He cast Dean a questioning look but didn’t ask as he left the apartment for his morning run. By the time he was back Dean had moved onto vacuuming the whole apartment. When he was done, he returned to the kitchen and found Sam drinking a disgusting green smoothie, the remnants of which could be found in the blender laying on the bench.
Jody hummed. “Pretty sure she’s not the only one,” she said. Dean looked away until Jody put her hand on Dean’s arm.
“About what?” he asked. He could tell that she didn’t buy it, but instead of pushing she rolled her eyes and dragged him over to the television.
Once they were settled under the blankets, Dean twisted onto his side and reached out to catch Cas’s hand in his once more. He could just make out Cas’s face in the dark and he could no longer resist, not with Cas so close and warm and inviting. Dean shuffled forward so he could lean in to kiss him but his aim was off and he caught the corner of Cas’s lips instead and Cas laughed, his chest shaking and his lips pulled upward and Dean could feel Cas’s smile against his cheek.
Dean’s stomach sank for some reason as he read the lyrics. He was glad it was a cheerful song for the first time in a while but something about it unsettled him. He reread the lyrics and grimaced when he thought of beewatcher under the mistletoe. He’d enjoyed their online banter and receiving his song lyrics had become a highlight of his day recently and the thought that he was the only one reading this banter as flirting was upsetting. But then again, beewatcher hadn’t been the only one Dean had been flirting with recently.
“No one called you by a nickname? Not your parents or friends?”
“Dean?”
“Yeah, I should be by for coffee,” he said, and Cas smiled and nodded at him. “Now, I better head back to the garage.”
“I’m guessing Kelly explained things to you,” Cas finally said, and Dean snorted.
It was his eyes that caught Dean’s attention most though. They were a shocking blue unlike any shade Dean had ever seen before. His eyes were narrowed with concern as he approached. It was only then that Dean realized the man was talking to him and he quickly refocused.
‘We can’t continue like this here,’ he said and Dean finally glanced at the two separate chairs in the room and winced as he realised what Cas meant.
“What?”
Jack shuffled over so Dean could sit down next to him and he did, feeling a twinge of regret that Jack was in the middle. Ignoring that, he picked up the remote as Cas started handing out their dinner. Jack took his container of wontons with glee while Dean immediately fished out a mushroom dumpling. He would never admit it to Sam, but the mushroom ones were actually his favorites. He knew if his brother ever found out he would have to deal with Sam repaying him for all the comments Dean had ever made about his rabbit food diet. Cas, on the other hand, had looked eager to try them when Dean had sheepishly mentioned them.
“Dean,” he began, his low voice soothing Dean’s nerves. “I have to admit to being confused. You haven’t spoken to me for weeks, and then tonight you —”
Friday arrived in a whirl of nerves and anticipation. Dean had spent Thursday night baking snacks in advance for Cas, trying to bury his anxiety under a pile of sugary confections. By the time he was done he had a delicious looking apple pie to share with Cas as well a plate full of lemon meringue cupcakes.
“Alright Jack, let’s make some pancakes.”
“I’ve never been good at baking or cooking,” Cas admitted. Dean let himself look over at him, and Cas shrugged with a small, rather self-deprecating smile twisting his lips. Dean wanted to smooth it away but forced himself to be still. “I’m not very good at following instructions.”
“I came out when I was eighteen, much to the horror of my family. Only my brother stood by me. Despite their disgust they mostly chose to ignore the topic, and as I left for college only a couple of months later, it didn’t cause as many problems as I had feared it would. They were distant during my college years, but when I announced that I intended to help Kelly raise her child they were horrified. My mother demanded that I either marry her or cut ties with her rather than bringing any sort of shame to the family. She and my father swore that neither Jack nor Kelly would ever be welcome in their home. When I refused to renounce my ties, they disowned me. I haven’t heard from them since.”
“Yes,” Jack cheered, tugging on Cas’s hand now as he beamed up at Dean. “Can we go back to the park?”
Dean grimaced and turned back to the kitchen counter which he began cleaning, again. Thankfully Sam seemed to take mercy on Dean and left to have a shower without any further comments. Charlie slowed her celebrations and leaned against the counter to watch Dean work in silence. Unfortunately, this meant that Dean’s thoughts had the freedom to roam, and he soon found himself thinking of Cas. His stomach twisted itself into knots. Charlie and Sam’s prodding hadn’t helped either. He knew he had been obvious, but to have the confirmation that the people around him had noticed was humiliating. He couldn’t understand why they kept pushing it,either. It wasn’t as if Dean could do anything, and their comments were only serving to make Dean feel guiltier and more confused by the second.
Jack insisted on trying to play a mini basketball game, which he consistently lost at until Cas shepherded him and his teary eyes over to an air hockey table. Dean pretended to play badly as Cas held Jack up so the young boy could aim properly until he tired of winning.
“Around eleven,” Sam spoke up and Dean almost jumped having forgotten his brother was there.
“Anna had to run out and do some Christmas shopping so I’m taking over.”
“All yours, sweetheart,” she said, lifting up the countertop for him. He ducked behind the bar and into the back after dodging past Jo. The kitchen was empty, so he was unimpeded on his way to the fridge.
“Uh huh.” She eyed him for a moment before she shrugged. “You can tell me about it tomorrow after I kick your ass.”
“You don’t have to Dean.”
“Why did you come back?” Cas asked quietly. His grip on Dean’s shoulder hadn’t lessened, and Dean leaned into it now, being careful not to disturb Jack.
“Back again, Dean?” she asked, and he smiled at her.
Cas still seemed confused, though Jack looked willing to accept that as an answer. Dean hit play and leaned back into the couch.
“Have a good afternoon guys,” Alex called after them as they left. “Oh, and Dean?” Dean winced and looked back to see the teenager waving her phone at him with a shit-eating grin on her face. “Jody says hi.”
“Is that…” Sam eyed the omelet on Dean’s plate warily.
“Kelly had Jack when we were in college. Jack’s actual father wasn’t in the picture, and Kelly and I already lived together, so I decided to help her out,” he explained quietly. “I share no relation to Jack but I have always considered him my own. It was Kelly’s decision to teach Jack to call me dad.”
Dean felt his lips twitch and he leant back in his seat and finished off his sandwich while watching people walk past the café, shopping bags in gloved hands.
The final Monday before Christmas was hectic and despite knowing Cas wouldn’t be at the café, Dean needed to get away from the garage. He struggled through the bitterly cold streets that were full of last-minute shoppers before he finally reached the café. Inside was busy but Dean navigated his way through the throng expertly and waited in the queue, humming along with the Christmas music playing on the radio.
Dean looked down, his cheeks heating up at how earnest Cas sounded. “Thanks,” he said quietly, looking up in time to see Cas smile. After a moment of silence Dean decided to take another risk. “I know you said you weren’t seeing family today, but did you have any other plans?”
The words were out of his mouth before Dean could stop them. He fought against the urge to shut his eyes as the three pairs of eyes looked at him, including Duma who looked away from the coffee machine.
As it was, Dean managed to avoid Cas until Thursday morning. He had just left his apartment when Cas came out of his own apartment sans Jack and immediately smiled at Dean. It was only small but it felt as though all the air had been sucked out of the hallway as Dean scrambled for something to say.
“Breakfast, dumbass,” he said instead. “Most important meal of the day. Especially on your birthday.”
“He was upset?”
It’s what sober Dean would have done. But this was tipsy, almost-drunk Dean who was far more reckless than sober Dean.
Dean turned, a smile still on his face and Cas stared at him. He couldn’t remember seeing Dean smile so much but ever since Cas had come back from the Empty it seemed as if a smile was never too far away. It made a nice change and made Cas all the more determined to keep it there for as long as possible.
He captioned the photo and sent it off with a grin. He glanced up, already nodding when he noticed a tanned hand reaching down for his empty plate. He was expecting the waitress from earlier and instead was greeted by a man not much older than himself. He was wearing an apron with the café’s logo printed on it amongst numerous stains Dean recognised as coffee grinds. He was tall, probably around Dean’s height, with broad shoulders and dark, messy hair. But it was his eyes that caught Dean’s attention. A startlingly bright blue that left Dean staring at him dumbly for a long moment before he stuttered out a thank you. Blue eyes smiled at him, a small, quiet affair that lit up his whole face.
“Open it and find out.”
“I’ve been thinking of you,” he repeated, and Dean knew his cheeks must be on fire but he couldn’t feel it through the shock. “Since we parted on Friday. I enjoyed spending the evening with you.”
“Hello, Dean,” he said, his voice washing over Dean and leaving him warm despite the cold air.
“Are you sure about letting Jack watch this? There is some fighting in it,” Dean asked in a low voice, and Cas frowned slightly.
Dean quickly saved the photo before flicking over to his messages. He replied to Charlie first, confirming his availability for tomorrow nights Star Wars event. He then clicked on Sam’s name and, having ignored his brothers demand for Dean to return his Harry Potter book, Dean quickly attached the photo and began compiling a brief message.
“It’s not that bad.”
3 Dec
“Night, sweetheart,” he managed to get out before he fell asleep, Cas’s hand still on the bed by his thigh.
Cas guided him off the footpath then and Dean found himself standing in front of an old brick apartment building. It looked to only have four floors and, as Cas had said earlier, an electronic front door. Once they were inside Cas called out quietly.
“Goodnight, Dean,” he said softly as he opened the door.
Dean could feel his cheeks begin to heat and, in an attempt to divert attention from it, he waved Cas and Jack into the apartment. Jack immediately bounded over to the couch while Cas waited for Dean to close the door.
“Those are weeds, Jack. They’re not nice flowers,” he tried to explain, but the boy stubbornly shook his head.
“Stay close,” Cas warned before Jack slipped off to a ball game next to the air hockey table that he was determined to win. He turned back to Dean who waved his air hockey goalie at him in a silent challenge. Cas smiled and waved at Dean to start, which left Dean biting back a smirk. He’d spent hours in this arcade first as a kid with Sam and then later when he’d come home with Charlie. And air hockey? This was a game he was awesome at.
“Yeah.”
“I’m fine, Dean. How are you?”
Dean’s mind supplied.
Something else?
Dean nodded around a lump in his throat and smiled.
Dean made a noise in the back of his throat and covered his face with his hands. His wedding ring burned on his skin. He imagined screaming at himself, all those years ago, these exact words.
"I'm so sorry, Cas."
"Cas," Dean started carefully. Cas watched him with full, expectant eyes.
And then something in the air changed very suddenly and very drastically. Dean caught his breath. Cas’s head snapped back toward Dean so suddenly that he staggered back. His skin felt too tight, all of a sudden. His tux felt too stiff. His mouth went dry as Cas opened his mouth and venom leaked out.
“Good,” he said, his lips turning up into a small smile. “I didn’t want to ruin our night.”
“Sorry, I need to just…” he trailed off awkwardly and gestured in Charlie’s direction. Without another word he left, striding away into the crowd of friends and family, a heavy weight resting in his stomach. He ducked away from Charlie and looped back around to the bar where he finished off his beer and started on the second that had been meant for Cas. He glanced back over to see Cas reach Kelly’s side. He looked around, frowning in confusion as he passed her a drink before he bent down to pass a juice to Jack. Dean kept his head low, and eventually Cas gave up. With a disappointed look on his face, Cas followed Kelly and Jack to a nearby table, and Dean resolved to stay away for the rest of the night.
“Cas, what are you talking about – what I deserve? – it’s not like you’re, like, broken, or bad luck, or whatever – just, maybe I could see you, maybe we could just hang out –”
“A celestial being—like an angel?”
So many chances. So many opportunities for three other words. Dean breathed in through his nose for six seconds and out through his mouth for eight – a trick that his psychologist showed him to get through panic attacks. Cas’s shoulders were tense, his jaw tight, eyes full of emotion that he refused to show in any other way. Dean’s heart broke.
Cas's face crumpled. Dean held his face tighter, pressed his body closer, screamed
Heat rose to Dean’s face.
He sat in the front seat next to Dean - an odd and rare occurrence, but since his powers began failing, Cas often found himself feeling carsick. Sam graciously and quietly, with only the slightest hint of pity, slid into the backseat more and more often in the hopes that sitting in the passenger seat could quell some of his nausea. He knew that Cas hated feeling sick. Just another small but monumental reminder that Castiel was no longer as magnificent as he used to be. Cas never said as much, but, well.
“It’s okay, Charlie,” he said as he put the pie away for later.
“Is this about that dumb straw goat?”
“Dean!”
It had been an excruciatingly long day. Dean’s entire body seemed to be aching, including his head. He was already running late, and the thought that he had to figure out dinner and look over the day’s records before turning in left his head throbbing worse than before.
“You what?” Dean asked.
“Nothing. I just — I gotta go.” Dean got to his feet and almost knocked the barista over in his hurry to get out of the café. He threw the door open and stumbled back into the cold, the door shutting loudly behind him. He shoved his hands into his pockets and began walking back to the garage. Despite the cold he could still feel his cheeks burning.
“I’ll be back later,” he said quietly. Dean knew he shouldn’t have been listening, but he found himself unable to look away as Cas adjusted Jack’s jacket and hugged him. “Be good for Dean and Sam,” he said, brushing a kiss against Jack’s forehead before he pushed himself upright. He rummaged in his trench coat’s pocket for a moment before pulling out a scrap piece of paper. Sam passed him a pen and Cas scrawled something down on it before passing the paper and pen back to Sam.
“A position at the college library,” Castiel explained, and Dean looked over at the bookcases that were surrounded by a veritable mountain of boxes filled with books.
“Thanks,” Sam scowled down at the phone. He only looked away when Jack waved a piece of paper in his direction. “What’s this?”
“Anna Karenina. Took me months,” Dean said happily as he took another slice of pizza.
“I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable,” he said, his words cold and stiff and Dean scrambled for something to say, something to fix this as Cas turned away.
look in his eyes that generally meant Dean would find his hand glued to a beer bottle. “And I’m sure it’ll help you and Jack, too.”
“And who is this?” the other man cast Dean a sly look which caused Cassie to roll his eyes.
Cassie — or Cas, Dean really needed to ask — quickly ducked out the back. Dean lingered awkwardly, no longer knowing what to do. He checked his phone and saw he only had fifteen minutes of his break left.
“Dude,” was all she could say while staring at Cas.
“What’s he look like?” he asked as he head ed for the stairs.
“How about we leave the decorating until tomorrow?” Cas asked but Jack didn’t relinquish his grip on the frame.
"Thank you for helping,” he said, a toothy smile lighting up his face. “Daddy’s not upset anymore.”
He looked down at the weeds growing alongside the pavement and sighed.
“What’re you doin?” he mumbled and Cas smiled at him. Dean’s stomach suddenly didn’t feel as if it were in the right place but he was too tired to think too hard about how his organs were jumping around inside of him.
“I know,” he said. He hesitated before continuing when he saw what looked like hope in Cas’s eyes. “But if you want some help, I can come with.”
“What?” he snapped, before glancing around for Jack. He found the boy by the couch where he was carefully putting down his backpack.
“Hey guys,” Sam called out, and there was a general answer as Maggie waved. “This is Cas, our new neighbor.” Cas nodded at the room, his “hello” deep and gravelly as always. Dean swallowed, his throat suddenly tight and he looked down at the games spread out across the floor. Everyone called out greetings and Sam began introducing Cas to the others as Benny headed to the kitchen with the pile of pizza boxes.
“Tomorrow then,” Cas said with a nod.
“Hello,” he said and
“I think he must have great taste.”
“My brother calls me Cassie sometimes to be annoying, which is his primary character trait, but other than him no.”
Cas paused and stared at Dean for a moment before nodding, as if in agreement. “Will we see you tomorrow?”
“Oh, yeah,” Dean huffed out a laugh. “Technically this was the first one but there are three prequels.”
“Hey kiddo, long time no see,” she said pointedly. He passed her a beer which she accepted. Alex eyed the drinks selection but both Dean and Jody stared her down.
It was absurdly early when Dean finally rolled out of bed, but he found himself unwilling to lay there any longer, especially if he were to be tormented with those dreams. He needed time to get his head on straight before he was forced to spend the day with Cas. Cas was taken, attached to someone with whom he had a child. It would be monstrous of Dean to even think of breaking that up.
“I thought you were married,” Dean blurted out and Cas froze.
Dean was staring at him, his cheeks flushed and his eyes wide and Cas felt as if his lungs were demanding breath. Instead he licked his lips, his mouth still dry and he watched as Dean’s gaze flicked down to stare at his mouth. He could still feel the soft ascot under his fingers though he’d lowered his hand and now they twitched, as he fought against reaching up and grabbing hold of it again.
“I don’t know how late I’ll be. It’s all very last minute but the library said they’d had their usual staff call in sick and decided to put me on earlier than planned.”
“That’s all good, man. You wanna beer?”
“He’s three. I’ve had him for two years now. He was my friend, Kelly’s, but she moved overseas for work and couldn’t take him with her.”
“Han Solo?” Cas asked, and Dean turned to stare at him.
Cas looked up, his head tilted to the side in confusion before he shook his head.
He stumbled into the shower, hoping it would wake him up, and when that failed he poured himself a mug of extra strong coffee. The sun was barely peeking over the horizon when he looked out the window and he groaned. He still had hours before Cas and Jack would arrive and he didn’t know how he was going to keep himself busy until then.
“Not as good as mine,” he responded without thinking. It was only when Cas looked at him curiously that Dean realized what he’d said.
century literature.”
It was almost 1:30 when he saw a familiar figure around the corner, and he shut off the engine. He pushed open his door and felt his heart lurch when he saw Cas look up. He was wearing a thick blue scarf that seemed to make his eyes even more intense than usual. Dean waited by the café door and he smiled helplessly when Cas reached him, a travel mug in his hand.
“I bow before you, Your Highness,” he said, bowing to her, and Charlie grinned.
While sitting down with his mediocre coffee, Dean pulled out his phone and compiled a tweet to beewatcher.
Despite this victory, the night still ended with Charlie reigning supreme, as always.
“Hey Cas,” he greeted cheerfully, and Dean’s head snapped up. Cas was standing in the doorway looking tired but pleased and his expression softened further when he caught sight of Jack and Dean on the couch.
By the end of the day Dean was actually feeling good and not immediately cursing the garage upon leaving it, which was definitely rare.
The weekend and seemed to drag and Dean had been left trapped in his apartment with the weather turning colder and wilder. The wind alone had convinced Dean that his couch was a better place to be than anywhere outdoors, no matter what Sam had said. But even Dr Sexy M.D. hadn’t been enough to keep him distracted. In fact, the sexy doctor had been mostly background noise as Dean had alternated between staring at his twitter notifications and attempting to brainstorm presents for his friends and brother.
A few minutes later Anna dropped his coffee off at his table along with a plate of cinnamon cookies and a wink and Dean sat back to enjoy it. The rush died down and he watched as Duma entered the café and shooed Cas away from the coffee machine. He headed out into the kitchen and, a few minutes later, returned without his apron and his lunch in hand. He glanced around and when he spotted Dean still sitting there, Dean pushed out the chair opposite him in clear invitation.
“Uh, a little. Don’t really get much time to read,” he admitted before shoving the pizza in. He could feel his cheeks heating up at the admission which was ridiculous. It wasn’t as if he’d admitted to wearing lingerie or anything embarrassing like that. Enjoying reading a book was hardly a call for being ashamed.
“To go or have here?” Anna asked, punching in his request as she spoke.
He glanced back at the counter, however, when he’d reached the door. Luck was on his side. Or at least a little. The waiter had re-emerged without his apron on and a sandwich in one hand. In his other hand was his phone which he was frowning down at and so he didn’t see the half wave which Dean abandoned upon realising the waiter wasn’t going to look up. His cheeks were feeling rather hot when Dean turned away and shoved the door open.
“About what happened last night…” Dean’s voice trailed off as he stared at Cas’s bed, a mess to prove that Cas had indeed being tossing and turning. The blanket had been thrown back across the bed and Dean stared at it long enough for Cas to frown at him and lift a hand slowly before lowering it again and instead calling to Dean.
“Hello!” he called to a woman walking her dog. She smiled down at Jack but continued without saying anything. For a moment Dean worried that this would upset the boy but found that he was mistaken. Instead, Jack chose to run towards a patch of weeds that were growing along the sidewalk and start picking their flowers.
“Yeah, Cas,” he said and Cas’s own smile grew. They sat there for a long moment before Cas cleared his throat and stood up to push the blankets further down the bed. He gestured for Dean to climb in and he followed him before turning out the bedside lamp.
Suddenly a hand caught his arm and spun him around. Dean’s head snapped up only to see the barista standing in front of him. Dean froze, staring at the other man who held up his hand.
“Oh?”
Sam had sent him another message that consisted only of the middle finger emoji. He ignored his brother and instead opened twitter to pass the time and decided to glance at the Gavle Goat page and see how many more people were counting down to a potential bonfire. 700 more likes had appeared over the afternoon and a quick scroll through the comments revealed mostly what he expected. What he hadn’t expected was someone complaining about all the fire comments.
“Just the usual, chief,” was all he said, and Dean frowned but Benny refused to say anything else. Dean decided to let it go but kept an eye on Benny for the rest of the day. Missouri’s car was finished by lunchtime, during which Dean scarfed down a sandwich and went over the afternoon’s projects with Bess while Gertie drew him a picture of his car.
“Oh,” he said. A moment passed and Dean realised he needed to take the phone from the barista. He lunged forward and snatched it away, overcompensating for his initial hesitation. “Ah, thanks.” He whirled around and took off down the street, only just stopping himself from breaking into a sprint.
“Around midday. I need to make this and ice it, and Sam’s just headed off for a run so we need to wait for sasquatch.”
“It’s no problem.” Any annoyance Dean had felt over the cluttered hallway vanished in the face of the man’s sincere regret. “Ah, I hadn’t realized someone was moving in.”
“G’night, Cas,” he mumbled as sleep began to wash over him. He heard Cas murmur his own goodnight and he smiled before slipping under.
“I think I understand now,” Cas said with a small smile. Dean tried to distract himself by focusing on the game at hand and hit the puck hard down the table, watching gleefully as it slid past Cas’s hand and into the goal. He danced on the spot for a moment, the way he did when he played against Charlie, before remembering that it was definitely not Charlie currently watching him. He looked over in time to see Cas biting back a smile and he felt his cheeks heat up.
He carried the mugs over and handed one over to Cas, trying hard not to let their fingers brush. Cas’s gaze was electric enough without needing to add physical contact, Dean thought. It was only then that Dean had a minor crisis over where he should sit. Next to Cas on the couch seemed too close. He wasn’t sure he’d be able to control himself long enough to get through this talk, but Cas took the matter out of Dean’s hands. He raised an eyebrow at Dean and scooted over further to the end of the couch, a clear invitation. Dean felt his resolve, which had already been shaky at best, dissolve on the spot. He half fell onto the couch, wincing as hot tea splashed onto his hand, but he shook it off and turned to look at Cas.
Jack’s bright, young voice cut through the din of the Roadhouse, and Dean turned around as a pair of arms wrapped around his legs.
“Ah, no,” he said quietly.
And attached to the post, as was customary, was a full audio clip of Michael Bublé’s ‘Cold December Night’.
“Uh, Sam this is Cas and Jack - they moved in across the hall last week. Cas, this is my brother Sam.” Dean introduced them quickly before turning back to the stovetop to turn it on and avoid meeting anyone’s gaze. He could hear Sam greeting Cas, but he forced himself to focus on heating up the pan and measuring out the perfect amount of batter for a pancake. It was only when he heard Sam calling his name that Dean dared to look over again.
Instead, he met Cas’s gaze, intending to tell him no, it was alright, there was no need for Cas to babysit him for a day. And what the hell was Sam thinking? He could be quiet for the time Sam needed without having to involve Cas.
“Hey guys, looking good in here,” he said as he came into the kitchen for a glass of water and eyed the cake in the oven. Dean grimaced at the sight of his sweaty brother which Sam chose to ignore as Charlie pounced.
“I mean, I watched it when I was his age,” Dean said with a shrug. That seemed to settle whatever concerns Cas may have had, because he gestured for Dean to lead the way. “I wasn’t sure what you wanted to eat. I have a dessert made but nothing for dinner yet.”
“Hey Cas,” Dean said just as Jack caught sight of him and lit up.
“Yeah, uh, so did I, Cas,” Dean admitted. He knew Cas was smiling at him, but he could barely bring himself to meet his eye. The feeling of Cas’s hand resting on his shoulder still burned.
To his relief, Jo decided not to push and returned back to the bar and Ash, maybe taking pity on him, decided to spill more on Andy. By the time Dean had finished his dinner, he’d agreed to at least meet with Andy and see if he seemed reliable.
“So the little man had to stay home?” Dean said as he turned away. The diner door swung open again behind him as he grabbed hold of a beer and twisted the cap off.
“Right,” he said, the sudden change in conversation throwing him and he had no idea where to go from here. He looked down at their hands and realised that for Cas to go to bed Dean would have to let go. For something that he hadn’t been doing for long at all, he found the idea of letting go almost unbearable.
No. No he really wasn’t.
“Hello Sam. Dean.” He smiled at Dean, who smiled back before he could stop himself.
Dean looked up startled and saw her wink at him before she turned away to clear another table. Dean glanced back over at the barista before turning to his lunch. His phone was laying next to his plate and for a moment Dean felt conflicted.
7 Dec
His bad mood followed him throughout the day, no matter how he tried to push it down. No one said anything at work, though Bess did watch him warily, and even Gordon kept his mouth shut during the day. Sam picked up on it when Dean came home that night, much to Dean’s regret. His head was pounding, a headache born from his constant internal flow of criticisms at himself, and he had no tolerance for any of Sam’s prodding.
“But you’re not.”
“Goodnight Dean,” Cas said finally and Dean watched helplessly as Cas vanished into his bedroom, the door closing firmly behind him. Dean stood there for another minute and stared at the door before he turned, picked up his bag and headed for his own room.
“Do you need to go?”
“Bad dreams, maybe?” Sam asked, lowering his voice even further and Dean looked around at him. Ever since Cas had fallen his nights had been far from peaceful. While he managed a few hours of sleep a night, about four nights a week he’d wake abruptly due to bad dreams and be unable to go back to sleep. At first he’d refused to discuss what it was he saw in those dreams but after a particularly bad night Dean had found him in the kitchen and slowly Cas had caved and told him a little of what he’d dreamt. A tense, halting conversation where Cas sat on the edge of his seat later and slowly Dean had put together an idea; a thousand dead, familiar bodies and a blank mind.
“All the more reason to get to work,” he said pointedly, and Gordon shrugged before turning to the old station wagon that he was working on. Dean jerked his head to the side to where Missouri Moseley’s car was waiting for him, and Benny followed, still clearly fuming.
By six thirty he had confirmed Dean’s worst fears but had at least managed to get the computer started long enough for Dean to print out the day’s reports and the schedule for the rest of the week.
Without saying anything, Dean grabbed hold of Cas’s bag for him and Cas looked around at him, his eyes wide and more awake than they had looked all day. Dean attempted to smile at him but could tell it looked as awkward as it felt by the frown and look of concern that crossed Cas’s face. Dean huffed out a quiet “come on” before turning away and following Sam, who had already left the garage and the ensuing awkwardness. He could hear Cas following him through the bunker and though none of them had said anything it was obvious they were all heading for their bedrooms and calling it a night.
There were a couple of Sam’s friends from college, including Maggie and a short, tired-looking boy named Kevin who had sassed Dean back when Dean had questioned his age. Benny and Ash were chatting with Donna who was, as usual, bright and bubbly, as Bobby rolled into the pub to much cheering.
“Dean?” Cas whispered, and it took all of Dean’s willpower to not just lean down and keep kissing him.
That night Dean hesitated, his finger hovering over the twitter notification. After the phone’s screen going dark four times he shook his head and forced himself to press down. As soon as he read what the post said he laughed and fell back on his bed.
“No. Not yet. But I will. It’s just a matter of time.”
But he's drowning.
The months before the wedding passed all too quickly. Though Dean adamantly argued against getting married in a church, Lisa insisted, and with the help of her mother and sisters, she won. Dean begged her to keep the guest list small, feeling embarrassed and nervous about standing up in front of all those people, but Lisa was a popular woman, and the list grew longer and longer. Lisa bought a simple champagne-colored dress that she wore well. Dean asked Ben to be his best man and tried not to picture his brother when the kid lit up and agreed enthusiastically.
, weren’t we?”
A significant pause, and then:
It didn't matter that Dean didn't know where, exactly, "home" was. It didn't matter that he didn't know one goddamn thing about the rules up here. Rules didn't matter, not anymore, not with Cas looking at him like that.
doesn’t mean
But Sam and Dean? They were too tired.
“You called me creepy many times.”
Dean laughed, slightly hysterical, and shut his eyes against the brilliance of Cas's eyes. He felt Cas's breath hitch and knew that the angel must be crying too. What a couple of saps.
“Dean.” Ben’s voice was sturdy. A raft for Dean to cling to in the stormy waves. He lowered his hands and blinked back angry tears.
“It really would have been something, wouldn’t it?” He asked, voice soft. Dean didn't open his eyes. Cas said weird shit all the time, cryptic and mysterious.
“Getting married,” Dean answered hoarsely. He corrected himself. “Married, I guess, as of a few hours ago. Lisa finally made a decent woman out of me.” He paused. “You didn’t know that? I thought you always knew these things.”
Dean suddenly, absurdly thought.
The next day, Dean asked Lisa to marry him. She said yes, with a smile on her face and tears in her eyes, and Dean loved her so much, he really did. They set the date for March; six months away. Dean wanted it to happen sooner rather than later.
“Can or will?” Dean felt a surge of familiar anger. “Come on, Cas, I want you here. I swear, I do.”
“What – why?” Stupid question. Maybe Dean just wanted to hear Cas talk more.
It was probably the alcohol.
"Yeah. We did."
"I'll always love you. But when I think about us
Ben was shocked and angry when Dean told him about leaving Cas in the burning house after he found out about Cas’ betrayal. He scoffed when Dean told him about leaving Cas in the hospital after Emmanuel died and Cas was reborn.
it was. He always was too honest for his own good. The lines on his face were as readable as the words in a book.
“Don’t you
“It’s all right, Dean, I know what you’re going to say.”
“Of course. When I was human. And all those times I was so weak. But I’ve never lost my grace like this before. This…transition, it’s awful. I’m forgetting things. I’m sick all the time. My body – my soul – is trying to figure out what it is. Where it belongs.”
“I still do, of course," Cas continued thoughtfully. "And I always will. For many reasons, some of which you would never know or understand. After all, I held your soul in my hands. I pieced you together with greater care than I have done anything else in thousands of years. That in itself is a love immeasurable."
that he was lonely and fucking
“It’s all right, Dean,” Cas said. “It was just a moment of weakness. Everything is better now.”
Dean stilled.
“Not like that. I mean that it takes some angels longer to fall. And after they fall, they’re as good as dead. And I hear that it feels just like dying, when you finally lose your wings. When it’s really over.”
Dean began to spend more and more nights sitting on the hood of the Impala, looking at the stars.
“You do, huh?”
An icy silence, and then:
“Loss – what loss? I’m not gone, Cas, I’m right here! Cas, I swear, come back, we can make this work,” Dean pleaded wildly, and suddenly, horrifyingly, sickeningly thought to himself,
“What are you doing?” Dean asked. It was almost small talk, if Dean ignored how much he desperately wanted to be wherever Cas was.
“I’ll try,” Dean said. He tightened his grip on Cas. “I would have invited you, I just—I wasn’t sure how we were, after our last—you know, when we talked last.”
Falling in love. That's what it was.
"I love you."
. Don’t you
“Hey, buddy,” Dean whispered, his stomach in knots.
And Cas - Cas did the same, and then some.
“Do you think—is there any possible chance, even a small one, that we could still…”
Isn't that what this whole tragedy is about?
“Don’t,” Cas growled. “Don’t you
Cas shook his head firmly and moved away from Dean.
Because he could.
Though he’s not really a kid, is he? He’s an adult, young and naïve and full of so much talent and potential. An adult capable of meeting his stepfather’s eye and wringing out the truth so that the words dripped like cold tears on the dark oak kitchen table between them.
Fuck.
“I remember,” Dean smiled.
"C'mon, Cas, have a little faith in me," Dean laughed wetly. Cas smiled nervously.
Dean nodded. He knew all about how it was possible to share a heaven with someone, and he had no doubt that his heaven would be with Sammy. He briefly wondered if Cas would want to be with him in heaven. Cas, who’d lived thousands and thousands of years before Dean ever made the slightest appearance. Dean wondered if Cas could die, even. He was still an angel, after all. Less so. His grace was fading fast, but he was still something. And Dean wondered if he’d have the privilege of sharing heaven with that something.
“He – it was – it was always complicated, the relationship between an angel and a human – can I just tell the story?” Dean demanded again, chest tight around his rapidly beating heart.
Cas was the one who started it.
“Did you tell her? About…well…all of it?”
Dean found himself nodding, breathing shallowly, willing himself not to cry. The wind whistled just outside. The first time Dean called him
"I'm sorry it had to end that way for you."
"You did, too, Cas."
He didn't have to.
“I’m beginning to settle down myself, I suppose,” Cas said, and Dean felt a very familiar yet terrifying tug in his heart as he pictured himself settling down with Cas, whatever that meant. He ignored the pull.
Dean drew a shaky breath and forced himself to open his eyes. He leaned back enough for Cas to see his face. His serious face. Cas watched him with glassy, overflowing eyes, and it made Dean's stomach hurt, because he never wanted to see Cas cry again, not ever. Dean stroked Cas's cheek with his thumb to clear away the tears.
They made plans for Cas to come to the diner that Dean and Lisa would meet at. All he needed to do was touch her shoulder and she’d have everything. An accidental brush of a stranger, and Dean would have a brand-new life.
“Cas was a celestial being.”
“I don’t think so, Dean.”
Dean could barely talk over the lump in his throat. He’d long forgiven both himself and Cas for what happened all those years ago. It was a complicated time, to put it simply. Sam, without a soul, hurting and confused. Dean, stupidly pining for someone who wasn’t there—someone who stabbed him in the back. (Although he still refused to call it pining.) And then Kevin came along, and the boys were swept up once again in something so much bigger than themselves, and it was so much easier to be mad at Cas. It was so much easier to leave him.
That night, Dean dreamt of Cas in the kitchen.
“I know your soul like I know the ground beneath my feet, Dean. I’m the one who put it back together, if you remember.”
“I…Cas…” Dean put up his hands, ready to make a joke, ready to laugh it off with some easy –
“Cas, please, I –”
speak to me about what I
“And when you say ‘hell,’ you mean—”
Dean tried to forget.
“Do you…dwell on it a lot?” Dean murmured. They were so close. This was
He kissed Cas slow and thoughtful. He kissed Cas gentle and thorough. He kissed Cas careful and full of promise.
“You should get back to your wife,” Cas said. Silence stretched between them. Dean got one more chance, just one more, to look at the angel before he was gone.
“What if I still hate you, though, at the end of this story?” Ben asked, and the kid was sad, Dean could tell. Dean nodded, looking down at his folded hands. It was the most father-son like conversation they’d ever had—just the two of them, talking man to man, at the kitchen table in a dark house at 2:00 in the morning.
"I'm so sorry that no one ever said that to you, Cas. All those years of existence. And ain't nobody said it to you. Most of all, me. God knows I wanted to. And you deserved to hear it."
"Cas," Dean started, but stopped when his voice shattered around the world. It didn't matter. Cas kept talking. When Dean snuck a look at the angel, he saw that Cas's eyes were brimming.
Dean wondered.
It was Cas who started it, because of
“I don’t know, man. That doesn’t sound like me.”
“Yeah, me and him are hard to explain. He’s hard to explain.”
“Okay.” Dean swallowed. “Castiel was an angel of the Lord.”
Dean immediately hated himself for thinking these things. He had no reason to. Not one. But he wanted so badly to be with Cas right now—touch him, see him smile, see him tilt his stupid head—erase thoughts of Jessica—
“I ain’t too good with feelings. And it’s hard to put it into words,” Dean finally said.
, you change your mind and invite me back into your life? Well, I am telling you right now, Dean, I cannot do it. I spent the last two years mourning the loss of Dean Winchester. I
“No, I know, I know. But if you hadn’t convinced him, he never would have done it. And like he said – he was basically getting in trouble because he liked you too much.” Now it was Ben’s turn to blush. “I’m not condoning any of your bullshit – I just – it was so obvious from the very start. How could you guys fuck it up so bad? It could have been so different.”
“No. My name is Castiel. Baz insists on calling me that inane nickname. Everyone else calls me Cas.”
“Dad died,” Dean said shortly. “Heart attack. I was a couple months shy of graduating. Sam tried to convince me to stay, but he was in his senior year of high school and the business needed someone. Bobby used to help Dad run it, but he had an accident a few years back that left him a paraplegic, so he couldn’t run it. So, I came back. Wasted four years of my life digging myself into debt without getting anything out of it and still got stuck with the garage.”
The cake was soon done and Dean left it to cool on the counter as he finally dared to look into the bags Charlie had brought with her. Sam soon joined them and together the three of them decided what decorations they would use. Dean took great pleasure in ganging up on Sam as he and Charlie vetoed his boring suggestions and proceeded to pull out shimmering streamers and cheesy balloons much to Sam’s horror.
Dean stepped up to the counter which was surprisingly empty. In fact, he realised looking around, the coffee shop was relatively empty. Cas moved forward and greeted Dean at the counter.
“Well, in that case—and I get it if you say no, but did you want to come to dinner tonight? My brother and his girlfriend are hosting dinner and a couple of our friends are going. There’s plenty of room for you.”
“You don’t know me that well to be making that kind of comment,” Dean pointed out. He was shocked when, a second later, Cas pulled out the chair next to him and sat down, staring at him intently.
Dean shot her a look, which she laughed at before moving over to the bar. Dean bit back a curse and instead glared at Charlie, figuring it must have been her that blabbed to Stevie.
He was reluctant to turn back to face her out of fear that Charlie would pick up where she’d left off, but, to his extreme gratitude, Sam chose that moment to return from his morning run.
“No problem,” she said in a bright voice. “Enjoy, though I’m sure you’ll
The problem still remained that a bunch of people coming over to his apartment was bound to catch Cas’s attention, and the clear lack of an invitation was going to send the guy a definite message. And yeah, okay, Dean had decided to avoid the guy but this seemed a bit too pointed. The thought of Cas being potentially hurt from being deliberately excluded caused Dean’s chest to ache and he glared down at his burger as if it was at fault for Dean’s feelings.
Scowling once more, Dean set to work cleaning the kitchen again. He upended every drawer and cupboard, cleaned them all out and reorganized the few cookbooks he had, first in alphabetical order by title, then by authors name, then by colors. He finally settled on height order before turning around and washing every baking utensil they owned.
“Don’t worry, I still love you.”
“All good, man. I better be going, then,” he said. He was sure Cas seemed disappointed at this statement, but Dean knew if he stayed any longer, any fondness Bobby held for Dean may not be enough to excuse him for his lateness.
Dean thought it over all the way to the Roadhouse, but it was only after he’d ordered a round from Jo as well as a bacon cheeseburger that he decided to broach the subject again.
“I wasn’t 100% sure until you mentioned you were a mechanic,” he shrugged, smiling sheepishly. “When did you figure it out?”
“Yes,” Dean said, ducking his head to avoid her gaze. He could feel her stare all the way down the street until they reached the bakery. “She’s annoying but mostly harmless,” he explained to Cas who looked mildly alarmed at the sudden censure directed at him.
“Thanks Ellen,” Dean called over to her as Charlie began unloading bags onto one of the tables. “Mind if I put the cake in the back?”
“Don’t you dare,” Sam warned, just a second too late as the cushion left Dean’s hand and sailed across the room and into Sam’s face.
“I should head home, too,” Cas said, glancing over at the now empty living room. “Patience will want to get home before it’s too late.”
“It’s okay,” Castiel — no, Cas — cut in. “I just wasn’t expecting it. No one’s ever called me that before.”
An hour later they’d finally persuaded Jack to leave the playground after chasing after him and an embarrassing minute where Dean attempted to go after him on the play equipment itself. He managed to free himself from the tunnel while Sam almost collapsed from laughing too hard. The bright side of this was Jack appeared to have finally worn himself out and Sam actually carried him back to the apartment.
Dean’s breath caught as Cas moved closer, his grip on Dean’s hands tightening until their knees were pressed together on the couch. He wanted to respond, but his tongue felt like it was too large for his mouth and the words wouldn’t come. The look in Cas’s eyes had effectively stolen his voice, and his words, gentle and sincere, left his heart pounding.
“You’re welcome,” spoke a familiarly rough voice. Dean looked up to see the barista standing there, smiling at him with a plate in his hand. “Do you like cinnamon by any chance?”
A dry laugh caught his attention, and he looked up to see Cas’s eyes crinkle in a wide, breathless smile.
By the time Dean was ready to leave the coffee shop any panic he may have been feeling had vanished. Michael Bublé had taken over from Elton and Dean hummed along a little to a song he didn’t recognise about falling in love in December. He hesitated for a moment before he picked up his mug and plate and went up to the counter. The barista was by himself now and appeared to be cleaning out the thermometer rather than actually making anything.
Cas eventually broke the silence, his eyes flicking up to where the speakers were filling the air with Christmas songs.
“Yes. I’ve never seen it before.”
“I’ll see you tomorrow,” the woman said, and Sam quickly looked back down at her and smiled.
Throughout the day he kept looking over at the clock, convinced an hour must have passed, surely, only to see it had barely been twenty minutes since he’d last checked. He ate alone in his office, a sudden wave of guilt leaving him unable to face anyone's company. Instead, he toyed with his phone and the idea of calling Cas and cancelling. Every time the thought crossed his mind, he remembered the look of disappointment on Cas’s face when he thought Dean hadn’t wanted to watch the movie with him. The way he’d asked if Dean was uncomfortable with spending time with him, as though nobody had ever hung out with Cas just because they wanted to.
Dean loved watching Ben’s mind (and mouth) work. He never thought without speaking those ideas aloud, running away with hypotheses and theories a mile a minute, so that Dean could hardly ever keep up with him. Dean watched Ben’s freckled nose crinkle as he sniffed, chilly in the cold autumn air drifting through the open kitchen window. He remembered watching Ben graduate college and thinking of Sammy. He thought of Sammy a lot, the more Ben grew up.
"All right."
And sometimes he dreamed about Cas in a way that he vowed, from the moment he awoke, sweaty and breathless, to never think about again. He pushed those thoughts so far away that he wasn’t sure they ever even happened. He’d gotten good at that.
“That’s good,” Dean smiled. “I don’t want you to hate him.”
Could it really have been that easy this whole time?
“Good.”
“I’m starting to not hate this guy as much,” Ben said, leaning back in his chair and crossing his arms. The digital clock above the oven read 2:00. Dean was never going to get to sleep tonight.
Cas narrowed his eyes suspiciously. Dean didn’t blame him. But c’mon – just a few more minutes of talking, a few more minutes of Dean-and-Cas, before the questions started.
“In thousands of years, I'd never fallen in love. I thought I was going mad. And then I finally realized...
Dean silently pleads.
“Yes.” Cas didn’t meet Dean’s eyes. “Is this what you’d like me to do for you and Lisa?”
Dean’s throat was tight.
“He…fought heaven. Like, all of heaven. For you.”
He tried to ignore it. No one called him except Dan and Lisa and maybe work, but it was Dean’s day off, and they respected that there. Demons had never respected Dean’s time off.
Hours later, back in his own apartment, Dean finally replied.
who has created some truly incredible art for this fic.
“Shut up, Sam,” Dean hissed. He made the mistake of looking up and caught sight of Sam’s smug smile which caused his mood to sour even further. Deciding it was high time to change the subject he removed the pancake from the pan and called out for Jack.
Despite the sudden shock of the cold air his smile didn’t slip as he thought back to the waiter. Even his frown had been cute. Which was ridiculous. The man hadn’t even spoken and Dean had barely managed to string two words together. It should not have left him feeling as giddy as it had but there was no denying the good mood that kept Dean going all afternoon through the bitter chill that the garage heaters couldn’t quite combat.
Charlie’s apartment was full with Dean, Charlie, her girlfriend Dorothy, and their friends Tessa, Jo and Kevin all squeezed into the small lounge room. Kevin had recently turned 21 and they had decided that a drinking game was the way to go. Three hours later and they were all well on their way to being drunk with Kevin, who had such a low tolerance to alcohol as to be non-existent, already completely smashed.
“Hey, no Cas.” Dean looked up and saw the disappointed look on Cas’s face and rushed to reassure him. “I’d love to watch the movie with you.”
“Doesn’t seem to be willing in my case.”
Dean stared at him, and the silence slowly grew between them. He was scared of asking more, scared that the tentative hope that was growing amongst his ribs would be crushed.
“I guess, a few friends, people from school—”
“Hey, the birthday boy finally decided to rise.”
They were silent for a long moment as Charlie watched Dean crack the eggs into the bowl and beat them with his handheld mixer and Dean refused to look up. He felt jittery, as though he’d been caught breaking one of his dad’s rules.
“I mean,” Dean scrambled to say something but Cas cut in.
“We’d better keep going,” he said quickly. Thankfully, Cas didn’t say anything as Jack continued to lead them to the park. Instead, he looked around at the neighborhood with interest even when the nosy-neighborhood watch lady stood up from her front porch bench and glared at them.
Jack started fidgeting not too long after that, and Sam quickly suggested a walk over to the nearby bakery. It was technically too early for lunch, but Jack’s face lit up and he rushed over to the door which led Dean little choice but to follow.
“C’mere,” he whispered. That was all the encouragement Cas needed, and Dean soon found himself with an armful of Cas. He wrapped his arm around Dean’s waist and tangled their legs together. Dean felt flushed as his body heated at every point of contact between them. He turned and met Cas’s sleepy gaze and, without thinking too closely on it, he leaned in and pressed his lips to Cas’s forehead.
The next day went smoother than Dean was expecting. Donna was back at work, and Dean didn’t even bother to stop himself from hugging her. Ash’s friend Andy rocked up during Dean’s lunch break and explained how his contact was actually his old workplace that owed him. Dean finally caved when he glanced at the pile of papers that covered Bess’s desk, and Andy agreed to swing by later that week to install it.
“What?” he gasped, his eyes watering slightly. Cas had stopped and was looking at him in concern as he placed his hand on Dean’s shoulder.
“I’d like that,” was all he said, but Dean’s stomach flipped at the uncharacteristically shy expression on Cas’s face.
“You know that’s bad for your heart, right?” Sam asked, and Dean scoffed.
He forced himself across the hallway and into his dark apartment. Sam was still out at a study group and so there was no one to judge Dean for falling back against his apartment door like the jilted lover in the rom-com movies that Dean definitely never watched. He shut his eyes, exhaustion washing over him once more and he let his head fall back.
“Right in with the hard questions, then.”
“Are you sure? I don’t want to burden you if you already had plans for your day.”
“I’d love to, Dean.”
Dean frowned. “You good?”
“I can’t come with, Cassie. I’ve got work,” he said, and Cas’s shoulders dropped.
“It was good,” Cas answered for Dean with a smile. “We had a lot of fun.”
“Did you get cheese?” he demanded, and Castiel smiled as he picked the energetic boy up in his arms. Jack’s arms immediately locked around Castiel’s neck.
Right on cue there came a knock on the door and Dean rushed out of his room to answer it.
The bag of fruit slipped from his grasp once again to fall to the floor, spilling out and scattering once more. But Cas wasn’t paying them any attention. The soft material of the ascot was tangled in Cas’s fingers and pulled tight against Dean’s throat as Cas tugged him closer and Dean moaned. Their lips were pressed together and Dean’s hands had grabbed hold of Cas, one sliding around Cas’s waist to pull him against Dean’s chest and the other slid up his back until his fingers sank into Cas’s hair. Dean moaned again and pulled away briefly only to tilt his head and kiss Cas again, deeper and harder than before and Cas could only hold on as Dean tried to pull him closer despite the fact their bodies were already pressing against one another.
“You see, Dean’s got the day off tomorrow and I know he’ll spend the whole day cleaning the apartment, but I need the apartment for at least a few hours for a study group. You mind getting him out of my hair for a while?” Dean could have throttled his brother if Jack wasn’t watching the events with big curious eyes. He wouldn’t traumatize the kid like that. But once Cas and Jack were gone then all bets would be off, Dean promised himself.
“It’s nothing,” he insisted.
It must have been a couple of hours later when he was jostled by someone moving his feet which pulled him sharply out of his oddly blurred dreams, something warm and soft beneath his fingers and a blur of blue that was painfully familiar. He jerked to the side, away from whoever was looming by the side of his bed, his hands immediately searching for his gun but he stilled when Cas’s voice broke the silence.
“Who’s that?” Dean asked, a slight feeling of trepidation uncurling in his chest.
Their bio gave nothing more away. It simply stated that CBee was a coffee addicted grad student who was doing a book count for the year. Because of course they were.
“No way,” he said. Sam frowned at him but Dean looked over at Cas. “If you’re gonna watch them you’re gonna do it right. You can come over here and watch the first one Friday night. If that fits,” he tacked on when he realized how demanding he’d sounded. There was a small voice in the back of his head asking him what the hell he was doing but Dean shoved it down. He was, after all, only trying to help Cas expand his pop culture knowledge. He was righting a wrong and that was all. There was nothing to read into with this, he thought desperately.
“Patience?”
6 Dec
, he thought as his mind went blank. The man, possibly the Jack whose box was now in Dean’s arms, looked to be about Dean’s age. He was only an inch or so shorter than him with broad shoulders and dark hair which was standing up in all directions as though he had been caught in a storm.
“Now, why does that sound vaguely ominous?”
“We better listen to the leader,” Cas said dryly to Dean as they left the apartment.
“You’re probably right,” he sighed, and Cas smiled at him sympathetically. Cas sat up and they sorted themselves out, buttoning up shirts and flattening down their hair. Each time they caught one another's eye they smiled reflexively until Dean’s cheeks ached. It was ridiculous, he thought. They were acting like teenagers, but Dean couldn’t deny the way his stomach fluttered every time he saw Cas’s swollen lips curve upward.
The café itself was half full despite Dean having arrived at the tail end of the lunch rush. He quickly joined the queue and then pulled out his phone. Amongst a calendar reminder, a message from Charlie about their upcoming Star Wars night and a message from Sam, there it was. He grinned before stepping forward to place his order.
“I could come help.”
He didn’t check his phone again until much later that night when he saw beewatcher had finally posted his song of the day.
He grabbed a beer and, just before the door swung shut again, he grabbed a second one and headed back to where Cas was sitting. Cas looked up at him, his blue eyes wide with concern, and Dean held out the second beer without a word. Cas took it with a silent nod, which Dean returned as Cas pushed the pizza box towards him.
The remaining glow of their afternoon was fading from Dean’s mind leaving him feeling cold and sick. The apartment building came into view and Dean managed to avoid another conversation with Cas as Jack roused himself enough to ask Cas about dinner, which led to Jack rambling about mac and cheese until he drifted off again.
They worked in silence as they slowly swept the whole building. Dean was starting to worry that the cat may actually have slipped out onto the street and judging by the way Cas’s shoulders slumped, he suspected Cas was fearing the same. They went up that stairs to the next floor and Cas let out a startled noise. He took off down the hallway and Dean quickly followed. He rounded the corner in time to see Cas dropping to his knees. A small tabby cat trotted over to him and started purring when Cas started patting him. The noise it was producing was much louder than Dean had thought a cat it’s size could. He slowly approached them, smiling when he saw the cat leap into Cas’s arms. Cas slowly stood, cradling the cat against his chest. The cat looked rather smug, Dean thought.
By the time his coffee was delivered to his table, Dean had worked himself up into something resembling panic. He wasn’t actually panicking, Dean assured himself. That would be ridiculous. He was just concerned about trying to navigate the table and chairs and various shopping bags when he was rushing from the shop after, inevitably, humiliating himself in front of the barista. Again. As such, he didn’t look up at the waitress when his coffee was put down in front of him, only muttering a quick thank you.
“It’s crap, Dean,” Bobby said sharply, and Dean couldn’t stop himself from smiling. “So, go on. But you better get back on time today.”
His fears were confirmed as he reached the door, the cheerful sign on the door announcing the café was shut and wishing everyone a wonderful holiday. Cas had called out to him, probably to let him know as well as to calm him down but Dean had just run out. And with Christmas tomorrow, Dean didn’t doubt that beewatcher would stop with his songs. If Dean was being honest, he had been surprised that he’d received one last night. Relieved but surprised all the same.
As it was, he was very grateful when the doorbell rang, announcing the arrival of their dinner. He leapt to his feet and rushed out the door while calling over his shoulder that he would be back shortly. Cas had also gotten to his feet, but before he could say anything Dean had shut the door and was off down the hall.
Dean couldn’t take it any longer. He couldn’t think clearly, and no words were coming to mind now, so he did the only thing he could think of. Using the grip he had on Cas’s hands he tugged him forward until he could feel Cas’s warm breath on his lips. He paused, watching Cas’s eyes as they suddenly grew wide before he leaned in further and, finally, kissed him.
“Excuse me. I kicked your ass last week,” Dean argued.
“The decent coffee I promised,” he said holding it out. Dean took it and under Cas’s watchful eye, took a sip.
“Hello,” Cas said, and Eileen smiled at him before she shifted her bag up a bit higher onto her shoulder.
They emerged ten minutes later with their purchases in brown paper bags and coffees in Dean and Cas’s hands. They made their way to the park, and Jack immediately made a bee line for the slide while Cas and Dean settled in to watch from the bench. It was quiet between them for a long moment until Dean opened one of the paper bags and bit into a chocolate eclair that he’d almost foregone. He hummed in appreciation.
“So is Cas coming?” Charlie asked and just like that, Dean’s peace was shattered. He tensed and shot her a look. A sense of foreboding crept over him when he caught sight of the badly concealed look of interest on her face.
He was just opening his own door when Cas spoke up from his doorway, his voice low but carrying, shaking slightly as his nerves were broadcasted for Dean to hear clearly.
, he thought to himself.
“Dean, guess what?” Jack asked, and Dean smiled down at him.
“Yes. I’m a grad student at LU,” he explained. Dean’s heart seemed to be getting louder. “I’m studying 20
“Uh huh.” Dean looked away from Cas and glanced outside where the morning sun was steadily shining down upon the walkway. “Yeah, and I’d like to see you, too.”
“I’m sure,” Sam said low enough that Dean only just caught it. “It was good to see you Cas,” he said more loudly, and Cas nodded towards him as Sam went back into the apartment.
“Yeah, get this one home,” he nodded to Gertie, who was looking rather tired and cranky. One look at her daughter dissuaded Bess from arguing any further and she left the office as Dean thumbed open his phone and scrolled until he reached Dr. Badass. Ash picked up after a few rings and, after Dean promised him a round of PBR, agreed to come and check it out.
“You little sneak,” he accused, and Cas’s smirk morphed into a full-fledged smile. Dean ignored the sudden twist in his stomach as he quickly tried to salvage his pride by smacking the puck down the table towards Cas. He realized very quickly that yes, Cas had been playing him and by the time the buzzer went off he had only managed to gain one other goal as opposed to Cas’s six.
“It was no problem,” was all he said, and Cas smiled at him.
Attached to the post was a clip of the talent show from Mean Girls which Dean could only stare at blankly for a long moment. He was distantly aware of Charlie giggling next to him but he was too busy trying to figure out what beewatcher was getting at. Was this a poor attempt at mocking him?
He quickly clicked on his notification and waited impatiently for twitter to load. When it did his mood dropped from confusion to irritation.
Dean’s stomach roiled, and he felt as though he would be sick at the gratitude on her face. Not even a two minutes ago he’d been lusting over her husband and now she was thanking him for looking after him.
The next day Dean found he couldn’t bring himself to go to the coffee shop despite his promise to Cas and instead chose to suffer through the awful garage coffee pot brew. Instead he spent his lunch break in a creaky chair in the staff room scrolling through twitter, smiling only when he saw beewatcher’s latest song. As soon as he read the lyrics his smile fell, and he frowned down at his phone.
“Ah, right, thanks,” he muttered. He looked down at the beers again and then looked around the bar. Cas was finishing up with Ellen and was turning back to them, and Dean made his decision. He should have made this decision weeks ago.
“What did you think?”
“Yes. When the others left, he was upset. Like how I get when I’m really sleepy. He’s not upset now.”
“I didn’t plan on living here either,” Cas said so softly that Dean almost missed it at first. He looked over to see Cas who was now looking down at Jack. It might have been Dean’s imagination, but he thought Cas looked sad as he looked at the boy.
“You left this behind.”
“A job offer,” the man explained, a small twist to his lips as if he knew exactly what Dean had been thinking. His eyes crinkled at the corners and his already handsome face almost seemed to light up in his amusement. Dean felt his own mouth twist upward into a sheepish smile. It was then that Dean realized he still didn’t know his new neighbor’s name.
“And you moved here why?” Stevie asked. Jo snorted into her beer.
, Dean hadn’t misremembered how deep his voice had been. “I — oh. Hello Dean.”
As he entered the garage, his coffee already half-gone, Dean felt his phone buzz. He managed to pull it out of his pocket after a moment of fumbling and he felt a grin tug at his lips when he saw what it was.
Dean wrapped up work and rushed out of the garage as quickly as he could. Bess had waved at him with a rather startled look on her face but he trusted her to lock up after herself. Once he’d reached his apartment he found a note from Sam on the kitchen bench, instructing him to have fun and not to bother about waiting up. Apparently, he was staying the night at a friend’s house. Dean smirked as he thought of the brunette Sam had been studying with last weekend before the realization that he and Cas would be here alone without an impending interrupting moose on the horizon hit him. His stomach swooped at the thought.
“Weird in what way?” Cas frowned at him and Dean huffed out a humourless laugh.
“Yeah. You may want to start on bay four. Ms. Moseley’s car needs a bit of work.”
“Are you alright?”
“Dude, turn the old folk tunes down,” Charlie complained as she pushed her way into the apartment.
“What’s a Han Solo?” Cas asked. He lengthened out Han Solo’s name as though he was testing out how it felt on his tongue.
“I thought… last night…” Cas trailed off and Dean froze, casting his mind back as best as hecould. It was fuzzy at best, exhaustion smothering everything he could remember until it all slipped away into darkness. He could remember collapsing after a brief shower and he vaguely remembered something about mice. Everything after that became a blur though he had an odd feeling that something soft and warm had touched him.
“You’ll see,” he promised Cas.
“Chicago, huh?” he asked, gesturing with a slice of pizza towards Castiel’s shirt when he looked confused. Dean fought back a laugh when Castiel actually looked down at his shirt and squinted at the logo.
“We don’t mind,” he said, his voice louder than he’d intended, and Cas turned around quickly.
“Aren’t you?” he asked and he took a step backwards, towards his room where his bed was still visible through the doorway, without letting go of Dean’s hand.
What was also ridiculous was how embarrassed Dean still was over the events at the coffee shop. He’d decided that he’d go back for a coffee today and apologize for acting like an idiot to the stupidly hot barista and then leave. Then he could get over himself and actually eat lunch without making what was probably stupid cow eyes at the man.
"Fuck, Cas."
“Yes, though," Dean said quietly. Cas looked up from his lap. His eyes swam. "I...felt that way, too.”
They kissed until it turned hungry and messy and breathless and sexy and embarrassing - until they both had to pull away, red in the face and stifling wide, toothy smiles. Dean laughed brokenly and wound his arms back around Cas's neck. He felt so light when Cas tucked his face into his shoulder that Dean thought he might float away. It was heaven, after all, and he was in the arms of an angel. If he closed his eyes and concentrated, he swore he could feel Cas's wings tucked around the two of them.
Dean couldn’t ruin Ben, too.
“You’re—Dean, are you -?”
Dean did everything normal.
“No. You don’t deserve that. I’ll be okay. I always am.”
“What do you mean, other?” Dean felt sick and dizzy for the second time that night. “Cas, are you – ”
"I couldn't love you on earth the way you deserved," Dean said when they pulled away. "Not the way I should've. Not the way I wanted to."
“We had our chance, Dean.” Cas closed his eyes. Dean’s throat became pinhole tight. “Don’t make me dwell on that fact any more than I already do.”
Dean’s hands shook as he pulled the phone away from his ear. His knees stung from kneeling on the cold grey pavement.
He never told Lisa about his dreams of Cas. He never even mentioned the angel’s name. She knew nothing of his existence – his monumental existence, greater than anything Dean could ever hope or wish or dream. For reasons Dean couldn’t – wouldn’t – admit, Cas was off-limits in Dean’s new life. He had his chance. They both did.
“Did you feel—would you have reciprocated—”
“But, hey.” Dean’s voice was nearly inaudible. “We really were
Well, shit. Maybe Dean should be giving the kid more credit.
Nearing midnight on a cool Thursday in October, Dean, Cas, and Sam had pulled into an overnight diner. Dean was still drenched in blood - a gift from a nest of vamps - and Cas was in a particularly vulnerable state that day, so Sam was the one to head into the restaurant to order and wait for their meals. He knew their preferences like he knew his own; Sam didn't have to speak one tired word as he slipped out of the car and into the crisp air. The sound of wind through dead leaves filled the car briefly as Sam opened the door and then closed it. Dean rested his head against the window and closed his eyes to the soft sounds of Cas's melodic breathing. How did he make every noise sound like music? Dean imagined that Cas was watching the leaves swirl into patterns on the ground. He liked shit like that. Finding beauty, or whatever, in the normal things.
He didn’t know any other life.
“No – I’m not, like, mad or anything! I mean, I get it, Cas. You were going through some shit. I wish I—I wish I coulda helped more, you know?”
“Oh, buddy, please tell me you’re not gonna raise him from the dead, too,” Dean said, and he smiled, glancing at Cas. Cas’ lips turned up slightly.
“I’ll do it. I’ll restore her memories, if you like.”
The first responders told Dean that Sam died instantly; he may not have even woken up. For all he knew, he fell asleep, and that was that. There was no pain. Maybe it was the most painless moment of that boy’s life. Dean identified his brother’s body on a sunny September morning and collapsed onto the cold, sterile hospital floor, weeping like he never had before. He was tired of holding it all in. Why not cry, right here, right now, in front of all these doctors and nurses? Hell, Sammy would probably be proud of him.
“Isn’t every deal with a demon a ‘bad deal?’” Ben scoffed, and Dean nearly laughed. “And, wait – he got you out of hell, but made you dig yourself out of the ground? Seems petty.”
you like that,' then you’ll be upset that you wasted all that time feeling that way. If the answer’s yes…if the answer is yes...then that’ll be worse, won’t it? Knowing that we both felt like that, and we missed out on something that would've been--that could’ve—” Dean couldn’t make it through before his throat closed entirely around a quiet cry. He swallowed hard and shook his head against another tear. Cas took a rickety breath beside him and Dean could tell that the angel was having just as hard of a time calming himself down.
(these boys don't know how to communicate to save their lives)
Could it really have been that easy?
He had sex with Lisa regularly and fell asleep beside her warm and solid body, wrinkled and rounded in places, just like Dean’s. She was just as beautiful and wonderful and fiery as he remembered. They talked easily and fought about mundane things like loading the dishwasher and picking up Dean’s muddy shoes from the front door.
It was Cas who started it.
And Cas, he fucking
Cas patiently explained what Dean already knew he was asking.
“He was,” Dean said. “He always was. That’s…that’s what Cas did. Tried to help.”
“I do.”
“I thought you said you were on your way out. Almost human, the last time we talked.”
“Normal,” Cas finished, and Dean laughed nervously. It wasn’t normal, though, was it? Normal was demons and survival and Cas. Cas, who was in Dean’s life so consistently that Dean had the wonderful, stupid privilege of taking him for granted.
“Yeah, I hear that,” Dean muttered, but before Cas could question him, continued. “I’m still sorry, though. I should’ve called.”
"Hm?" Dean hummed, arms folded across his chest, warm and safe in the driver's seat.
, got to rest.
It happened the next October, just a little over a year after Sam’s funeral. Dean had just gotten home from late night drinks with Dan, and as he made his way up the front path to his house, his pocket buzzed.
