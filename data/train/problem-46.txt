John full-out laughed in happiness. "And you didn't think to try and let me know? Didn't you know that I've been looking for some sign that you're--well--In There since the hospital? Never mind, you probably didn't understand why it was important."  John's admonishing words couldn't hide his obvious pleasure at the new circumstances. Had Sherlock known John's awareness of this would have such an impact, he would have notified the man sooner. The detective cocked his head, or tried to. What actually happened was certainly more akin to twitching it to one side before being overtaken by an impressive wave of exhaustion. The heart monitor started beeping again, and Sherlock felt John's hand on the side of his face. His doctor had silenced the monitor for the second time in as many minutes before sliding back into bed with the detective.
“Wait, excuse me? What game?”
The young woman smiled shyly. “Fifth.”
John looked at the strings of numbers and frowned. “See what?”
Anthea still didn’t look up, but her expression changed slightly and, when she spoke, her voice was softer than usual. “Because he’s being blocked. Mr. Holmes was handling some negotiations abroad when half the diplomatic issues he’s been keeping an eye all blew up at once, all unexpectedly. There didn’t seem to be any connection between the cases, except that he was involved. So, he deduced that it all must be some way of trying to distract him from something else. After checking on a number of other possibilities, he had me try to locate Sherlock on the CCTV. I, of course, found the footage you saw before. But it’s all my employer can do, at the moment, to keep half the political stage from imploding. There simply isn’t time to look into a missing person, whoever that person might be.”
John sat on the edge of the bed they shared, looking down at Sherlock. Aside from the heart monitor, one could almost believe that he’d simply caught his detective in a rare moment of sleep. John grinned to himself—like that would ever happen. The only times Sherlock slept were when he and John were together. This was quite possibly because, without John’s regular patterns of eating and sleeping to remind him, Sherlock simply forgot that bodies need maintenance. Two months ago, when they’d been on a train home from an out-of-town case (“The Misplaced Mare,” in John’s blog), the doctor had been forced to verbally inform the mad detective that he was tired and should sleep. Sherlock had argued, but John had made the case that the violin and experiments were at the flat and the train didn’t have internet, so sleeping now would not be any more boring than whatever else he could be doing. Sherlock had looked pleased, then proud, and told John that he’d made an excellent point. The detective then proceeded to wrap himself slightly tighter in his coat before falling asleep almost immediately, looking like a delicately balanced statue as he bobbed with the motion of the train. At the time, John had wanted to move to the seat beside his detective, to hold him and keep him steady while he slept, but the doctor had held himself back. The last thing he wanted to do was alienate the most important person in his world. John desperately wished that the change in the nature of their relationship had occurred sooner, that he might have had such a memory to visit now.
So, he waited. That was boring, but the detective entertained himself by observing things about the room. There was nothing new to observe, of course, but that made it slightly more challenging.
It really wasn’t as amusing a thought as it seemed, and the detective knew that he was becoming rather desperate. But he wouldn’t try to rush, couldn’t afford to make a mistake and let Moriarty, or whatever henchman he had watching his monitors, see what Sherlock was up to. How many criminals had panicked under the pressure of doing virtually nothing, and been summarily caught? Sherlock knew John wouldn’t agree with the comparison, but that couldn’t be helped. Capture was capture, and deception was deception, and he’d be a fool to ignore the very mistakes he exploited on the other side of this equation. Moriarty would have more trouble trying to keep this spider in check.
“And . . . we’re two of those people?”
Sherlock gave John a look that could kill. Well, he still couldn’t open his eyes, so the effects were somewhat lessened, but it was still a look that could do some serious damage.
“What’s bothering you?”
“In your position as his doctor, you will be privy to certain medical records. I would like you to relay these records to me. Nothing delicate, of course.”
“Do you have any idea where he went?” John pressed.
But he hadn’t gone more than a few meters before the consulting detective heard running footsteps coming down the hall towards him. Sherlock readied himself for a confrontation. He might be weaponless, and not in top physical form at the moment, but the running figure was probably unaware of his presence, and that counted for something. He analyzed the sound of steps down the hallway. Male, small, controlled pace. Probably trained to run for long periods of time, like an athlete or a soldier . . . Wait!
“And the shapes? How many?”
They still felt like they were on fire, more so because he’d had to brace the straightjacket’s cloth against his middle while working at it. And Sherlock didn’t entirely trust that he wouldn’t lose consciousness if he were to aggravate them more by bending down.
John spluttered for a minute, the sight before him as terrifying as it was incongruous. Why was Moriarty strapped to a bomb? Well, probably because he wanted to be, considering the way he was grinning.
Then, Mycroft walked in.
“That,” said Sherlock, indicating the older man, “Is Elihu Stubbingwicke, eccentric medical researcher and the founder of Biopharm Limited. Two years ago he died, and left the business to his son, Kenneth,” Sherlock pointed to the younger man in the picture. “And with the change in management, Biopharm doubled in worth overnight.” The consulting detective sat back and looked at John, having apparently made his point.
Though hopefully he wouldn't have to for much longer. The detective knew his pain meds had been reduced again before John even told him, and movement was getting easier. Now, Sherlock could move his fingers almost without effort, and he'd even managed to work his jaw a few hours previously. John had noticed the movement, as his head had been resting by Sherlock's shoulder at the time, but the doctor's excited intake of breath had been drowned out by the frantic beeping of the heart monitor. John had silenced it, but admonished his flatmate with an angry "Don't DO that!" before softening a bit.
“I know,” responded John, sagging a little against the table.
At that point, Sherlock had been tempted to try pushing closer to his doctor, but he didn't want to set the heart monitor off again and he really was very tired. But when John took his wrist, as he always did before allowing himself to fall asleep, Sherlock determinedly pressed his fingers against John's pulsepoint.
“How do we even know he’s missing?” asked Anderson, jumping on the bandwagon with altogether too much enthusiasm. “This would probably be his idea of some sort of joke!”
John’s gaze was steady. “Not useless, no. And I’m grateful. But it hasn’t been enough. And quite frankly, hospitals are dangerous. All the workers can be accounted for at any hour of the day, theoretically, but there are too many people, too many possible weapons, and too many variables. Too many chances for something to go wrong.” John started scanning the hall behind through the half-open door, already on guard for the man in the bed.
As he and Sherlock climbed the steps to Basement 2, John asked, “Why were you down here, anyway?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I’m perfectly capable of such a menial task as taking care of—Wait, Molly’s off? Why?”
The detective was capable of picking any lock with his tools, and a fair few without them, but escaping handcuffs without the use of either of his hands was proving slightly more difficult.
John put his two arms around his detective. “You’ve got no idea how well you’ve been doing. Most people would’ve given up by now, or gone out of their heads entirely. But you’re still here, and you’re still you. Amazing.”
After a long moment, Sherlock gave in with a frustrated sound.
“No, the intestines in his hair were because he took my phone away. Exploding IVs are just because he’s annoying.”
John stood firm. “Everyone keeps saying that this case is unprecedented, which means there is no expert to consult. All they’ll be doing here is supportive care, which any general practitioner knows how to do. I’ll borrow what I need from Sarah or from here. But I’m not trusting Sherlock’s safety to anyone else. Not now.”
“I haven’t the faintest idea what you’re talking about,” Sherlock replied honestly, if with his usual derision.
“Yes, and to . . . well, someone else.”
“You don’t want to go in there, that guy’s crazy. You won’t be getting assigned an IP like that for a while yet, so don’t worry about it.”
Wilkes sighed and, in a hissed whisper, asked “Can’t you deal with it? We’re nearly as low on non-drowsy IPs as we are on doctors, so we can’t exactly get rid of him. Especially not in the middle of a round.”
At that, the detective gave a little amused huff. John grinned in response as he washed his hands. He knew Sherlock couldn’t see him, but the doctor was confident that his detective knew he was smiling anyway.
Dr. Watson had mostly finished by the time the ambulance finally found them, of course, and the doctors in the hospital decided that he’d done too good a job to justify operating a second time. No one in that hospital, or any other, probably, had dealt with a case even remotely similar to this, but the detective was stable and appeared to be doing well. Lestrade wished he could say the same for Dr. Watson.
“John?” Lestrade was getting mildly concerned at this point.
It would have to be something sarcastic and cutting, otherwise the doctor would be racked by unnecessary guilt. But if he were to do anything outright cruel, John would see it as anger at his own inaction and would feel guilty at that, too. So, the usual manner then. John would be frustrated, would say something emotional, Sherlock would counter with a rational reason why John had no reason to feel guilty, John would sigh and stomp about, and everything would be back to normal by dinnertime. A dinner Sherlock would eat, as there probably wouldn’t be a case on and the lethargy of early starvation was rather distracting.
At that, the Detective Inspector’s face softened a bit, and John remembered who it was that took on the brilliant addict in the first place.
John nodded. Basement 3: Morgue. To be expected, he supposed.
“Mycroft is otherwise engaged, so he sent me.”
John grabbed the device in question from an endtable and turned it on, gritting his teeth at the delay, while Mrs. Hudson and DI Lestrade attempted to acquaint themselves with their new companion. The landlady’s offer of tea was met with a mild “Thanks,” and so Mrs. Hudson set about to find a clean mug, chatting all the while about not actually being John and Sherlock’s housekeeper, while Lestrade tried in vain to catch the young executive assistant’s eye.
Just then, his pager went off. John sat for a long moment, as if he could avoid the inevitable choice by refusing to acknowledge the passage of time. But he knew he couldn’t, and the adrenaline in his blood reminded him that every second spent doing nothing was a second he was helping no one at all. What sort of person was he, to be so selfish?
“Of course not! Look at the way they’ve been varying sizes and membrane thickness. And a program to make the organs x-ray opaque? There’s no way those things are even supposed to store a liquid, never mind one that has to interact with fluids in the body. Biopharm is looking for new ways to store something, but it isn’t drugs.”
Sherlock was thankfully unconscious, secured to a perfectly clean metal operating table that looked quite out of place in the abandoned factory the group in question had been using for its base. Monitors beeped and the floor was littered with animal bones and spent sutures, and three young people in full surgical attire were crowded against the wall behind the whole arrangement, eyes darting as they made futile attempts to hide their bloody gloves.
“Yes! But not for storing drugs!”
“I rather think that’s up to him, not you.” John quirked his lips uncomfortably.
The doctor shook his head and took Sherlock’s pulse for the third time in the last minute. Although both Mycroft and Lestrade had taken precautions, John had taken up the mantle of Sherlock’s last line of defense. To that end, he had moved as many of the necessities of life as possible to the bedroom he now shared with Sherlock (so that he’d be present in case of an emergency), started keeping his gun within arm’s length at all times, and even, when he could think of no other measures to take, had closed all the curtains against hypothetical snipers. Perhaps it was paranoia, but this was Moriarty they were talking about.
The detective shifted his position slightly, testing how much he could move in each direction. He also wiggled his fingers, bringing blood flow back to them as a way to gauge exactly what position he was in, but even before they started to swell and ache with feeling Sherlock deduced that what was holding him to the chair was, in fact, a straightjacket. It was obvious really; when one was tied with traditional bonds, one could expect significant chafing against the skin while struggling. In this case, attempts to move were met with more widespread pressure and an aching in his shoulder muscles consistent with having his arms pulled around his front and behind his back. Therefore, straightjacket. Doubtless, there were some extra straps holding the device to the back of the chair, although he didn’t doubt he’d be able to unfasten them when the time came.
It had been nearly twenty-four hours since John had gotten Mycroft’s text, thirty-two since his flatmate had been hit by a cab and summarily abducted, and although their progress since then had been significant they weren’t yet at the point where John could take to the streets looking for his mad friend.
“Okay, here’s what we know. This morning, at seven-fifteen, Sherlock was here, at 221B Baker Street. He arrived at the mortuary of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital at ten, according to lab employee Molly Hooper, and left with some spare body parts by one pm. But by eight this evening, he wasn’t home yet, and there are no new body parts in the apartment.”
The doctor looked up as the heart monitor started to beep a bit faster. "I know, it's cold. I tried warming the bottle up a bit, but if I'd waited too long you'd have fallen asleep again and you might not have woken up until morning. Tomorrow, I'll plan further ahead."
They stayed like that for hours, until it was almost certainly too dark for John to read. And yet he stayed, well into the night, loath to leave Sherlock alone when his mind had so obviously turned against him. But finally, when the doctor was almost certain his detective had fallen into sleep, John carefully levered himself out from under the detective’s legs and stood. This was followed by a soft groan, as he stretched after so long in one position, and then an even softer one, as his semi-comatose detective apparently noticed his absence.
“You don’t look well at all. A meal would probably help, but your Dr. Watson is still being far too persistent for my tastes.
“You’re probably wondering when I’ll see fit to feed you. I won’t, not until Phase Three. Best hope that’s soon.” Moriarty gave a mocking wave, and slammed the door, submerging Sherlock in darkness yet again.
“Well, it’s not stolen yet. I’m on it though. Although if I’m too out of it, you may have to steal the thing yourself. It’s not hard, just pickpocket Wilkes next time he comes down here showing off to someone.”
“Third: If, after you were shot, you had been given the choice to stay in Afghanistan or return to England early with a full military pension instead of your new contract, would you have returned?
And the doctor wasn’t entirely positive, but he thought he saw a confused, but pleased expression cross the face of his enigmatic patient.
Even still, the sudden light burned through his eyelids, leaving a negative image of the flamboyant madman who was already speaking.
“Tell them ‘no,’ Dr. Watson.” Mrs. Hudson had entered without his noticing, and was standing at his elbow with empathy in her eyes.
John shook his head. He was in a place of perfect tunnel vision now, seeing nothing but the problem at hand and thinking nothing but how to fix it. He turned to the girl one last time, nodding to himself.
The first time John met Anthea, he’d attempted to flirt with her. And why wouldn’t he? He was single, and she was, well, unbelievably beautiful. But right now, with the gorgeous young woman asleep on his sofa, for god’s sake, John couldn’t spare her a thought. He smiled to himself. Sherlock didn’t eat when he was on a case, perhaps John didn’t flirt in that scenario. Or perhaps it was just that this particular case, this particular missing person, was too important.
“How many of your people can you have here within the hour?”
Blinking away what wasn’t quite a tear, Sherlock pulled his blogger close, emphasizing his point as he replied, speaking into John’s hair, “No, my heart is perfectly safe.”
For all that John’s patient didn’t seem to care about his own wellbeing, the doctor was beginning to notice subtle signs that he was aware of the ticking clock on his health. The detective had taken to making lists of what he had to find out in order to deduce the identity of Biopharm’s shadow leader. John had offered to help, to do some of the legwork (seriously, didn’t Sherlock think that he was capable of counting the number of technicians working between 4 and 6 pm on weekdays?) but the detective was adamant. The only thing he’d asked John to do so far had been to log onto Biopharm’s patient records software for him. The doctor was slightly frustrated with his less-than-glamorous role in their endeavor, but he had a feeling his job would be becoming a lot more difficult as the weeks went on.
“Pentagrams, mostly. Thirteen in all, though you can’t see all of them because of the blood. I tried to clamp off everything, but it just wouldn’t . . . it’s only my second year!”
And the crackle of a speaker being turned on again.”
Sherlock had effectively weakened the stitching of the straightjacket to a point where the seam would pop free at relatively little force (handy—he didn’t know how much force he could muster at the moment), and now he was working on the handcuffs at his ankles.
Sherlock gave a put-upon sigh and shrugged off the shock blanket. He seemed to have forgotten about the juice.
“Don’t lie to me!” Moriarty’s voice was growing more hysterical. “On their own—they couldn’t have—those useless—You! Get Holmes, he’ll answer our questions later, whether he wants to or not!” There was another crackle, and the speaker was off.
I realized that no matter how many times I tell myself I am going to pick this back up, there's a good chance I won't. So instead, I'm just going to tell you what happens.
“No one spends that long contemplating an empty box, and there are a finite number of things you would try to hide. Considering your military service, a gun wasn’t much of a leap.” Sherlock still had his eyes closed, the world apparently too boring to bear at the moment.
John bristled. “How do you know—never mind. It doesn’t matter, and I shouldn’t be here.”  He gripped the aluminium cane by his side and moved to rise. He’d never have been so insubordinate in the army, but this was not the army. Hell, he didn’t even know it was legal for the army to subcontract out soldiers who hadn’t finished their tours.
The detective looked confused. “I’ll give you proper instructions when the time comes. All you’ll need to do to be an effective assistant is to carry them out.”
Wilkes put an entirely unwanted hand on John’s arm. “So, you don’t want to do implantation support. So fine! Most of our doctors don’t do that anyway. Stamford in there, he just does supportive care—keeping the IPs as healthy as possible until their surgeries, when the synthetic organs are removed and they go back to the outside. You can even do the surgeries if you’d like.”
“Soon enough for you?” asked the voice, with an inordinate amount of glee. Honestly, thought Sherlock. Moriarty takes such pride in being unpredictable, but it will be possible to predict his actions soon enough just by choosing the least rational option available in a given circumstance.
John started towards the door, curious, when Sebastian Wilkes stopped him.
“Why are you here?” demanded John, one hand curled around his gun.
Lestrade paused, then seemed to decide that it was alright and nodded for the girl to approach. Most of her face was hidden by a surgical mask, but her eyes were terrified. She started bawling right away.
Sherlock nodded enthusiastically. “Or to know which one was actually killed! I suspect one of the two surviving brothers may have taken the actual murdered party’s place.”
“You can leave the facilities to work out the particulars tomorrow, Captain, but until the paperwork goes through I must ask you to remain here. Corporate espionage, you know. It’s everywhere. To that end, I must ask you to compile a list of personal acquaintances with whom you’ll likely be communicating. There’s a chance someone will come up subversive, but it’s a very small one. Still, better safe than sorry. Best of luck, Doctor.”  And with that, he left the room.
John didn’t mind the blanket. He didn’t need it, but the doctor reasoned that if he calmly accepted the blanket, perhaps Sherlock would be a bit less morose about drinking the bottle of pineapple-banana smoothie one of the secret service agents had happened to have on her. And although John completely believed his flatmate when he said the drink was vile, it also had enough salts and sugars to make Sherlock stop shaking.
The doctor put the pamphlet in his pocket and got off the tube at the stop closest to Biopharm, struggling a bit with the box under one arm and his cane in the other hand. People on the stairs did their best to make way for him, but it still took a lot of jostling and shoving to get out of the busy underground and onto the busy street. Looking at his watch, John noted that he had a few more hours of freedom before he had to be back under the facility roof. He briefly considered finding a place for lunch before scrapping the idea; toting a box around searching for food didn’t seem very enjoyable, and quite honestly John was looking forward to getting back to his dubiously-chosen workplace, if only for the incredibly unusual man within. His Partner In Crime, as it were. Or maybe Partner In Crime Prevention. At any rate, it was certainly an exciting business, and in spite of himself John found himself enjoying it.
The doctor got down on his knees and held Sherlock’s face while he shone a pen light in the taller man’s eyes. “How you escaped a concussion is beyond me.”
The detective made a slightly more exaggerated twitch of one shoulder. Feigning muscular spasms wasn’t too difficult, as lack of food, water, and sleep, in addition to nicotine patches, had left Sherlock in a questionable physical state as it was. If John could see him, Sherlock knew he’d have that brow-wrinkled concerned look right about now. Chances are he had it anyway, wherever he was. John was a very loyal person, and could not be comfortable if he knew his friend was in any sort of danger.
“Do we have the travel drive?”
Which was good, of course, but it all reminded John that there was nothing proactive to be done for his flatmate. Tissue would repair, stitches would dissolve, and inflammation would go down, all with time. And until then, sit on the bed with an eye on the door and your gun in your hand.
That wouldn’t be hard, of course, as said escape plan didn’t have much of a structure yet anyway.
“Oh, I didn’t want us to be interrupted,” said Moriarty, responding to John’s thoughts instead of his words. “Unless you don’t do what I say. In which case, I’ll be sure there are lots of innocent little bystanders to get blown to pieces by this,” he indicated his explosive vest. “By the way, isn’t it gorgeous? Black is really my color.”
"I hope you don't rest in piece Father." I whisper as Molly walks in. I speak up so Molly can hear. "I'm going to take a sample to check." "Sherlock who is he?" "My Father." "Then why do you need to take a sample?" "Because he died once before." Walk past Molly, who is staring at me in disbelief, and head to the lab.
Was Delilah next?
It was a year later when Mrs. Holmes called them front and center, which meant stand up straight and face the front door. They knew an important guest was coming, most likely a man but they weren't ready for the news they received after her showed up. "I'm Delilah, I'm 14. This is Mycroft he is 16 and this is William, preferably Sherlock he is 11." Delilah introduced them to the stranger, getting back into line. "I am Jim Holmes." Sherlock avoided eye contact while Mycroft stared Jim down, so Delilah could put in her deductions.
This chapter includes thoughts of suicide, murder, self-harm and rape.. This chapter reflects on the past on my version of the Holmes family. It is an important chapter so please try to read but if you can't I understand.
She's delusional, just like me.
I run as fast as I can.
"Well I'll be damned." Delilah said, looking at the man, she was taller than now.
"Sherlock thats 65 minutes away!"
"You should've looked at that message." The voice says behind me. Then something touches my back and clicks.
"Okay so this is Sherlock's room. It shouldn't be to hard to find again, it's the only door in the house thats painted gold."
John has to be stuck here.
"Done what?" The sudden voice of Sherlock made me jump.
"L-lets get to know each other better." I respond to his question. "Oh okay."
"Dinner."
"Sherlock this house is- oh fuck!" John said walking up to us with Mycroft.
"Look what the cat dragged in." Donovan said. "I dont have time for this, LESTRADE!"
"You should introduce me to this college of yours, what did you say his name was?" "Sherlock, Sherlock Holmes."
I cant move.
"No you're not." She mumbles
"1 minute Sherlock, tick-tock!" Jim yells.
When I stepped into the room it was like I was transported into a 16 year olds world. Shelock laughs as if he knows what I'm thinking, "I left when I was 16."
"Wow well um... Sherlock hasn't always been a Sociopath. I guess in a way it's my fault." John looks with confusion. "Let me tell you a story."
"Holy shit." Mycroft says looking the man straight in the eyes.
Hes on the other side.
"Delilah, father wants you." Sherlock walks in
"Its John!" I take a breath stupid breathing. "Jim Moriarty took him, well he didn't actually take him, he hired someone to." "Who? Why?" "Jim Moriarty haven't you been listening?!" "Yes but why?" "Me."
Years Later
"1 minute Sherlock, tick-tock!"
"Who's next?"
"Jim."
"I'm sorry."
"Lets make a deal."
"Who are you?"
"You know whats funny? I can't get drunk, it doesn't work on me. I dont go crazy, dont get mad not even sad. Interesting."
Mycroft tapped my shoulder, taking me out of my thoughts. "The hospital." "Oh, are you an assistant?" She asks, rudely. "Um, no ma'am I'm a doctor." "Oh!" she smiles, "Why didn't you introduce yourself as Doctor Watson?" "Um, well I don't really know." "Mummy, John here was in the military." Delilah states. "Was?" "I was honorably discharged."
But I dont move.
"Sher (A/N for any confusion Sher is pronounced sure, not cher) will you pass me the salt?" Delilah asks. "Here you go De."
Mycroft
"Look, I know you don't understand your feelings yet." Mycroft says. "Invite him to dinner tomorrow." I say. "I guess. He keeps telling me how he is excited for us to spend Christmas together." Sher says, at a boy! "Shall we head home brother dear?" "Yeah, I guess it would be safe to go home now." "I'm sure John is still awake, maybe you can talk to him, or play the violin." "Stay safe De." Sherlock says grabbing my arm, taking off the rag putting a bandage over it. "Yeah, haha. Why to open up old wounds right?" I laugh bitterly. Mycroft and I head home in silence but when we get there we have to set up the table, decorations, the tree and presents. "It's going to be a long night." I whisper. "Why do mummy and father always have us do it, we have maids for a reason?" Mycroft asks, of course it's a rhetorical question, but I answer anyways. "To make us better, because we are horrible children." Mocking my own father's words. "Let's get going then, shall we?" Mycroft states.
John and I ended up falling asleep on the couch after a hot make out session and a cuddle. The only reason why I am awake is because my phone rang.
John?
"Sherlock, will you please pass the salt." "I would be delighted to." He makes sure to avoid reaching over food. "Thank you, dear." "You're welcome, Delilah."
"This is my mother's grave, my birth mother. Father was having an affair, stupid. John," he looks away from the grave and faces me, "When you look at me and my siblings stand next to each other, we don't look alike. That woman is only Mycroft's mother."
Going home early. Don't wait up. -J.W.
All three children of course tried taking their lives multiple times. There is this one particular time I want to tell you about..... Mycroft was 18, Delilah was 15, and Sherlock was 13. Sherlock figured 11 o'clock is a better time than ever to jump off the roof, of their huge, home. He opened the front door, to take the ladder the painter left, when he saw that all too familiar face, "Are your brother and sister home?" Sherlock gulps holding the door open for him.
Delilah had two wonderful friends, Dan and Phil. Soon after the first year of high school died in a car accident. Nobody was there to help her grieve as she was the only one in The Holmes family to be cursed with feelings.
Right?
"John, John. Wake up." "Mmmm." "Your going to miss your shift at the hospital." John jumped up and fell off the couch. I busted out laughing, "Thank you, John. That is the first time I have laughed in years." "Jesus Christ Sherlock!" I get up and get dressed, about to grab my jacket when John asks, "Where are you going?" "Oh, Molly has a body for me."  "Together then?" John holds out his hand, I take it. "Together."
After The Date
"Sherlock never tells me of his past." John blurts suddenly.
I'm sitting in the bath, the tub is steaming. I have candles around, scented of course. I just get into my Mind Palace when Mycroft barges in. "Sister, dearest. I do have reason to believe Sherlock is in love." I basically jump out of the bathtub grabbing a towel. "What?" I said in astonishment. Ah bugger, feelings..... "I do believe you heard me the first time according..." "Yeah, yeah." I cut him off. The dinner bell rang, mummy shaking it ever so violently so everyone would hear it. "We finish this conversation later, Mike." He cringes when he hears me call him Mike, he absolutely hates it.
Doors open
Sherlock is holding is face.
"Get in the car."
"Oh."
I don't want to make him uncomfortable. I've never thought about that before.
"Sherlock, find John!"
"That would be because even though we are rich and livin large. We didn't get anything without work and a beating." He looks at me with pity. "Don't pity us though, if we didn't have that we wouldn't have proved them wrong. Mycroft basically is the Government, Sherlock the worlds only Consulting Detective and Delilah the Military brat that believes in The Supernatural."
One morning Mrs. Holmes, Sherlock, and Mycroft found themselves awaken by Delilah's laugh. This laugh wasn't one you'd give if someone told a joke, it was a laugh of pure hatred, almost revengeful. Sherlock walked out only to discover Delilah standing over a pool of blood, holding a note in her hand. Sherlock stood there horrified, whose blood was it? He thought to himself. Mycroft walk out soon after. Delilah still laughing as if she'd gone insane. "What is all this racket!?" Mrs. Holmes yelled, cranky from being woken from her slumber. Sherlock still mortified not looking at who was sitting in the puddle of blood, looked at Mycroft who was.... Smiling? Sherlock questioned why his mummy looked terrified, why Delilah was laughing and Mycroft was smiling. Sherlock decided he would look at who it was. As soon as he peeked around the corner he heard Delilah whisper to Mycroft, "Le trou du cul est finalement morte." They knew Sherlock couldn't speak French. "Don't you dare call your father an asshole." Mrs. Holmes screamed. "Wh-what did she say?" Came the timid voice of a 10 year old Sherlock. "William I highly...." Mrs. Holmes tried to say before she was interrupted by Delilah, "I said the asshole is finally dead." Delilah said this in a hushed voice as to not freak out Sherlock more than he already was. "I'll call the police." Mycroft said walking away.
"Oh?"
After that night Jim was gone, the beatings continued but less. The children learned their lesson. But dinner was awkward, timing was strict. Mycroft was no longer a child but of course as family tradition holds it, the oldest cannot move out, he/she must take the property and pass it along to their children.  When Sherlock turned 16 he left, an 18 year old Delilah stayed with Mycroft and his parents as he could use "help" around the property. Meaning he needed his best friend. Sherlock moved to a little apartment or flat. 221 B Baker Street was his new home, but he couldn't pay for it himself. This leads us to today......
"Killing my father?"
"Oh come on! Delilah you've got to stop looking in the mirror all the time! You aren't even that pretty!" Mrs. Holmes yelled at her 8 year old daughter. "Why do you even care? Your brothers don't, they take it and leave it." A 10 year old Mycroft walks in, "For goodness sake mother, do you have to be rude to the youngest child." "Do not defend her Mycroft, she is a girl." Mr. Holmes says walking in.
I call him.
Delilah's Past Narrator.
I'm awoken to the smell of eggs and Sherlock cursing. He knows he can't cook, why try? I walk down the stairs, when suddenly the night before comes flooding back. Was this his way of asking me? No, no it can't be, it's Sherlock. He would straight up ask me, right? Suddenly I realize where I am, standing in the door frame of the kitchen. "What's this?" I ask, scaring Sherlock. "I um... well I was trying to.... Umm.... Make breakfast...." Sherlock says blushing.
"Father, I have no idea what you are implying." "Sherlock, this man. You cannot ever bring him back." "But father, John is my friend." "You don't have friends." Slap. He slapped me! "I'm sorry father, but this time I do." Slap. He did it again. "It wasn't my idea!" I yell suddenly. I didn't mean to, Delilah was my sister. I didn't mean to hurt her.
"When I was 15 our father was murdered, or thats what they thought. Anyways I saw who did it. I was in the kitchen getting a glass of water when I heard a crash and Fathee scream. I went to go check it out, a body was on the floor and Fathed was jumping out the window. Another man was there too, he winked at me and jumped also. But John, the body looked exactly like Father. That's why when De was laughing and everyone was freaking out, I was calm. But one year later that man knocked on the door. Jim. I could never face him."
“Fine! I escaped because if I hadn’t, you’d have started limping again! Is that the answer you were looking for?”  The detective tried to bring his knees up to his chin, but was prevented from doing so by his broken ribs and had to settle for folding his arms petulantly instead.
Sherlock slowly opened his eyes, unobtrusively taking in as much as he could while he had use of the light pouring in from the open door. He spared only a cursory glance at Moriarty, who was flouncing about the room in spite of his usual suit. He’d already had ample opportunity to analyze the consulting criminal’s mannerisms during past encounters, so now there were more useful observations to be made. For example, observations regarding the box above the door. It was, in fact, a camera, although the LED that signaled whether it was on had been painted over. Clever, thought Sherlock. I never know whether I’m being observed, so I’m forced to act as though constantly under surveillance. He wasn’t surprised at this precaution. In fact, if he’d been able to see such an obvious indicator as a power button’s light, he’d have never trusted that it wasn’t a ruse.
The doctor clumsily attempted to push his hands away. “S’fine, Sherlock. S’all fine.”
The doctor stood up to retrieve the shampoo, and in a stroke of inspiration grabbed his own towel from its hook. He pushed the towel under the water and tucked it behind Sherlock’s head, propping it up, before proceeding to lather the shampoo into the detective’s dark hair. It was hopelessly tangled, as one would expect after so many days of neglect, but John didn’t mind taking a bit more time. As the doctor alternated using shampoo, and conditioner, and more shampoo, and another conditioner, he fancied himself not just rubbing the bath products into his detective’s scalp, but paying some sort of homage to the brain underneath. That amazing, extraordinary, self-destructive brain that drove so many away but called to John like a beacon. The exact heart of what made his Sherlock so special, and so entirely his.
Mrs. Hudson continued. “Well, if there’s nothing extra gory about here, then Sherlock mustn’t have gotten home after the mortuary. So he must have gone somewhere else. That Molly girl was very helpful, and maybe someone else around the hospital saw something. Though we should probably wait for morning to ask them, it is getting awfully late.”
“A good concept, but one that will take time. Or, a lot of people.” He turned to DI Lestrade. “Can you put some cars on that? Canvassing the area between here and St. Bart’s to see if anyone noticed something?”
Sherlock looked at him, puzzled, so John felt compelled to continue.
“The game. Well, I suppose you would call it a mission. Annoying governmental assignment to investigate internal workings of Biopharm Limited. They know something is going on here, but not what or why. That’s why I’m here. Personal physician was in on it, but bailed. Would’ve taken months to get an agent in, build a backstory and whatnot, but now you’re here, and you’re the real thing. You are obviously willing to help me, so no need for any more convincing, even. Four months is a long time for a job, but not unheard of and you clearly don’t have anywhere else to be. It’s so ideal, I’d ask if you were planted if you weren’t so obviously honest, Doctor.
She looked at him pityingly. “Well, you’d better get used to it. That’s just about normal for him.”  She went to leave, but John stopped her.
“So, what are they looking to store then?”
Then, dimly, Sherlock was aware of something on his feet. Or rather, under them. John had lifted Sherlock’s legs, seated himself on the couch (probably with a book, by the sound of it), and replaced said legs on his lap.
As John went to return the light to his pocket, Sherlock cut in, voice swaying along with the rest of him.
“Didn’t get it from here,” Sherlock droned from his position, draped over the couch. It seemed that even with his eyes closed he could tell what John was looking at, and thinking.
Moriarty let out a strangled exclamation of rage. Then, he composed his features. “Fine. If you won’t play nice, I’ll just have to change the rules.” He flounced out, a disturbing spring in his step.
“Hello. Sorry if I woke you—is Sherlock there?”
John pressed his fingers a bit harder to Sherlock’s pulsepoint. He looked absolutely helpless. But John would keep him safe, would protect him no matter what happened.
John thought that a case was more likely, as no one else would be in the mortuary after six and Sherlock had lost privileges to be there alone after his experiments with “exploding casket syndrome.” So, he got out his cell phone and pushed the speed dial for Detective Inspector Lestrade.
John looked to where the syringe was drawing blood from Ms. Hooper’s arm. The skin there was pockmarked from where it had been done before, scars upon scars. And he saw other telltale signs of repeated trauma: IV marks on the back of her hand, shaved patches on her scalp, and odd lines and raised sections in her hospital gown that spoke of multiple surgery scars. In the old days, this woman would have been diagnosed with Munchausen’s Syndrome and given psychological help. Today, she was a model volunteer.
Anderson pouted. “But what if I find drugs?”
John looked up, sharply. “Well in hand, as in the usual surveillance but more so? That hasn’t exactly been effective to this point.”
“Done,” responded John, without taking even a moment to consider.
Just then, a scream rang out from one of the doors on the hallway, and a nasally-voiced man in a nurse’s uniform came flying out into the hall, where he made a beeline for Wilkes. A second look at the man showed John that he was sopping wet.
“What?” asked John, almost positive it was an offer he would not accept.
“Why did you need me alone?”  Sherlock enunciated to the ceiling.
She smiled at John, sadly, and patted his arm. “I’ll just call in for you, then.” Mrs. Hudson reached for John’s pager.
“Sherlock, she does have a family. And things she does outside of work.”
Even if the detective had been clairvoyant, he probably wouldn’t have heard John’s plea. Just staying conscious had become enough of a battle to effectively keep Sherlock distracted, although he could dimly appreciate that at least he wasn’t bored. His headache had increased to skull-splitting proportions, and he felt slightly dizzy. It was impossible to say how long he’d been in the little room, although it seemed an eternity. Still, as far as escape was concerned, progress had been made.
The text message was all it took to lodge a stone firmly back in the pit of John’s stomach. It read:
Lestrade had gone home a few hours ago, promising to be back in the morning. Mrs. Hudson and Anthea, too, were both asleep, the former in her flat and the latter on John’s couch.
“You’ve seen me type.”
“You’re saying all that?”  It wasn’t really a question, but John answered it anyway.
He found the man and took the note he’d surreptitiously passed to him. John’s first instinct was to read the note immediately, but he fought it. If Moriarty had caused the CCTV to go offline, John could be fairly certain he was being watched. And, thought John as he heard a police siren in the distance, if he could cause such an increase to violent crime, I can be sure I have a target on my back. But such thoughts were hardly helpful. All John could do was get back to Baker Street as quickly as he could, and trust the gun in his belt if anything went wrong. The doctor was usually hesitant to use his illegal handgun, hesitant to even bring it out in public, but these were not the usual circumstances. As he rounded the corner and opened the door to 221B, he just hoped he wouldn’t be too late.
After a stunned silence, John blinked several times and stood up, once again taking control of the situation.
It would be one thing if the shaking was random, Sherlock thought to himself, but it happens to a far greater extent when I proactively try to move. Moriarty will certainly notice the discrepancy, and will inevitably use more secure precautions if he gets any indicator that I’m trying to escape.
John jumped, holding the box closer to his chest. “How did you—”
“No.”  John stopped her. “I’ll call.” He was shaking, but determined as he silenced the pager and typed the number on his cell phone. John would be haunted, but he could deal with that later. There were more important things to think of at the moment.
"Delilah, help your mother do the damned dishes." Mr. Holmes yells at her once again. "She never actually does them, it's all me." Delilah mumbled under her breath. "What did you say to me?" "I mean come on I'm 13!" Her sudden outburst got everyone in the Holmes house to become curious. The two boys sticking their heads out of the bedrooms, mother dropping a plate. Noticing everyone listening and watching. Delilah sunk down realizing her mistake. "I will deal with you later." Mr. Holmes growled. The children all winced knowing what was going to happen to her when everyone was trying to sleep.
"We have one hour!" I yell in frustration, I can't think straight!
"Sherlock you have 24 hours to find John, then I shoot him."
"What is so wrong about being gay?" I asked after getting the 'You are not gay' speech. "Oh shit!" Delilah yelled running down the stairs. She ran towards the door, opening it.
5:20 in the morning
"Hello Molly." "Hello." "Jim, Jim Moriarty." I shake her hand. "How would you like to go on a date?" "I would like that very much."
"What's your name sweetheart?" A man ask in a thick British accent, breaking my thought. I turn and face him.
"JOHN!"
Nobody said a word. Nobody even looked up.
"Lestrade!"
"Come on John, I'll show you his room." "He's doing it again." "Yes, well he has done it for as long as I can remember."
Sherlock
Did he seriously make them repeat that like they were children? Why are they so scared of him? He's just one man.
"Sherlock?" "Yes, Molly?" "I would like you to meet my boyfriend, Jim." I quickly look up from my microscope, hitting my head. The name reminding me of horrible times. I walk in the opposite direction not even looking. "Is this Sherlock?" Asked the fimilar voice, I drop my tray and turn slowly. Holding is hand Jim said, "Jim Moriarty, nice to meet you." I quickly turn away. Molly not noticing cheers and says, "I'll let you boys chat." She walks out.
"Earlier your sister called you William twice." I state. "Oh yes, well my middle name is Sherlock. William Sherlock Holmes. What about you? Is it Johnathan or just John?" "Just John." "Oh." "Sherlock I have to tell you-mph."
Nobody knew why Mrs. Holmes hated the children, maybe she blamed them for the death of her husband. Everyone knew the young 13 year old girl did it, she was more than capable.
"John for your soul."
"I didn't do anything for 5 years but when I moved out I went back to Jim. They told you about Jim?" John shakes his head yes, so I continue. "I needed money so I worked for him for 3 years. I stopped because he told me that I was doing so well, stealing for him, that I was bumped into second command. But in order to do so I had to-"
JOHN!
I woke up to the sound of really, really loud music. At first I thought it was Sherlock but he was still sleeping. It's 5:00 in the morning, why would be up this early? Then I hear her belt out lyrics along with the music.
2 months 3 weeks 4 days 5 hours 25 minutes 57 seconds.
"Hello, De." Sherlock says as she sits across from me. She just nods.
"And we certainly do not talk about feelings!" Mr. Holmes yells standing up.
I open the door to a very pissed John.
I start to laugh, hard. I take a swig.
I drop my phone.
"I win!" Jim says coming out of the shadows, his eyes flickering black.
A grave.
"Did Mr. Holmes think I liked Delilah?"
When the dishes were done, Delilah wishing there was more. Ran into Sherlock's room trying to hide. She was close to him. He quietly but quickly told her to get out, knowing he too would be beaten to a pulp, if his father found out she was hiding in his room. "Delilah!" The scary voice of Mr. Holmes boomed. Mycroft began to shake, Sherlock began to worry and Delilah began to cry. She silently stepped out of Sherlock's room. *Gulp* "Come take a seat while we 'chat'" He said calmly, she obeyed, shivering. They sat there for 15 minutes waiting for the rest of the house to be sleeping. Mycroft was drifting almost there, when her screams filled the house. Sherlock was awake playing with hi action figures. But not Mrs. Holmes she was fast asleep never woken. For she was far to use to this. "We named you Delilah so you would be gentile as a flower, but you not." One slap to the face. "You are a girl, you do house work!" One belt whip to the butt. "You're not even attractive!" A black eye. He grabbed her by the hair dragging her past Sherlock and Mycroft's rooms, where they were looking under the door, to her room. By that time she learned to take it, never saying anything back. As he threw her into her room he muttered, "Vous hostie de merde." She landed on the floor.
"Alright, Delilah if you'll join me in the kitchen so dinner can get finished up. Mycroft set the table, you too John. If you want to eat here, you help out. And Sherlock join your father in the study for a chat." The three of them cringe when Mrs. Holmes mentions a chat in the study.
Delilah
Mummy raised an eyebrow at me, "Delilah, dear, is John the man you and Mycroft were talking about?" I purposely start coughing, quickly excused myself and ran up the stairs slamming my bedroom door. As soon as the door slammed snow fell pass the window. In one swift move I was looking out the window.
Delilah swears she can find away to bring him back, its why we haven't put him in a grave yet.
"Not one for small talk are we?"
Sitting in a bar is all I do now. Going to Sherlocks twice a week, feeding him. Its not like he eats anyways. Lost in thought we both are. It doesn't even phase Mycroft. Nothing ever does.
Narrator
"What happened to 23 hours!" I spit blood. "22 hours and 15 minutes is how long you have to live, nobody said I couldn't have a little fun.
I open the front door, it's a little after midnight, when I pause hearing voices coming from upstairs. "Sherlock, you're.... in love." A woman says. I felt a shiver go down my spine, with who? Me? Don't be silly John, you're too average. I was thinking when suddenly Sherlock said in wonder, "In love?" He paused. I thought they had heard me as I was walking slowly up the stairs to hear them better. "With John?" "Of course with John, you of all people shouldn't be so blind." A voice said, I recognized this one....... Mycroft! "What am I supposed to do, De?" Sherlock practically begged the girl for an explanation. "You do what everyone else does, tell him or wait for him to tell you." De responds. "You think....? He loves me too?" Tired of standing there I acted as if I was drunk staggering by going straight to my room. They all mumble at the same time, "We know you're not drunk." I laugh to myself of course they do. I go back up to my room closing the door, only to have it open again. "Hello, John my names Delilah." The woman said walking in. Delilah was beautiful I mean damn. She had silk brown straight hair, died purple at the ends. She was wearing semi-formal clothing. Her skin was so pale but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. Why was she with Mycroft and Sherlock? Was she Mycroft's girlfriend? "John?" Her voice stopped me from thinking. I had only just realized I was staring at her. "Um- sorry what did you-"She cut me off. "I said, how are you doing this fine evening?" Is she flirting with me? She laughs, "Quite the opposite, I was sent in as William's wing-man." "What-"I pause only to realize I was thinking out loud.
Its a gun
In the heart.
After we were all set up Mycroft starting explaining which fork was for what and why there was 2 different types of spoons.
*Ding*
And I didn't even move a muscle.
The inside of the house was beautiful! It was decorated with everything Christmas, it had a fire place, a giant tree, and lights everywhere. It was like it was out of movie, it was perfect, too perfect.
Then it hit me. I'm going to be sharing a bed with Sherlock Holmes.
*Knock, Knock*
"Sherlock is why I'm here."
Don't continue that story or I will do something you won't like -J.H.
"Delilah et toi?"
We each sat down. Me and Sherlock next to each other across from Mycroft. Mr. Holmes at the head of the table and Mrs. Holmes at the other end. Delilah is yet to show. "Ah, not to worry Mr. Watson Delilah will be here any minute." Mr. Holmes voice booms. Maids and waiters served us Christmas dinner.
"I don't know. I didn't really go in there looking for a particular type of person. He was friendly enough, if that's the right word for it. A bit like you in some ways. Intense. Smiled a lot."
It was absolutely the right thing to say; Mrs. Holmes' face lit up with a giant beam. "Oh, you are sweet. He's lucky to have you too, John. Heavens knows where he'd be if he didn't have you."
Before Sherlock had a chance to bite back, a retort already freshly curled on his tongue, a loud crunching noise signalling the opening of the garden door interrupted them both and bathed them in a flood of light, Greg's well-built silhouette blocking out any view of anything behind him.
Mycroft took a step back, closing his eyes for a moment. “Which certainly doesn’t help.”
John stared unabashedly at him, mouth still hanging open. “Of course it was. Extraordinary. It was... quite extraordinary.”
Harry thought for a moment.
Perhaps
Five minutes on:
Throwing the covers from his legs, Greg groaned loudly as he forced himself to sit up. His mouth felt as it were full of sand. Tasted a bit rank too. Whatever had been in that curry had not sat well with him, that much was obvious – his stomach had been churning since he'd left Lauren's flat, the burning acidity that came with heartburn tingling in the back of his throat and keeping him awake. He'd ignored it as best as he could but it was getting ridiculous now. He had to have a drink of water, or anything cold – maybe milk. Just something to soothe it a little.
. Leave no stone unturned."
He trailed off, his eyes flickering from one to the other as he saw the lack of space between them, the way that Sherlock was looking at John regardless of Greg's uninvited entrance, the shock and irritation on John's face; his mouth opened in a small 'o' shape, his eyes widening ever so slightly as he focused his expression towards John.
"Not that." Sherlock entered the room in time to see John pulling a pack of beef chunks from one of the bags, head shaking and eyes focused on the items he was unloading. "Are they actually seeing one another? I know they've been shagging but is it an exclusive sort of thing?"
John frowned. "As normal?"
better. They reach out and actually
"Mm."
"Whereas you didn't seem phased
This time it sunk in to his mind, the sound. He slowly shifted his body until he could glance over his shoulder; groaning at the black screen, he forced himself to twist until his arm could reach the mousepad, skating his finger over it until the screen began to light up. There, sitting on his taskbar, was a little orange flashing window, something he'd never seen before. He turned properly, frowning, pulling the office chair closer to the bed and moving his face closer to the screen.
He shuffled down the stairs as silently as he could manage, avoiding the fourth creaky step and grasping the banister so tightly his knuckles went white. He eventually managed to reach the bottom with a careful hop over the creaky floorboard at the bottom and began to step carefully down the hallway and towards the kitchen -
“Absolutely.” Sherlock’s Adam’s apple quivered as he swallowed.
"Shut up," Greg ordered again. "And from there we kind of just started noticing things. He would bring you up in conversation. And then when whenever I mentioned you he'd kind of leap on it, start talking about something or other that you'd said. Nothing major, not like a love-sick puppy or anything but just mentioning it in that monotonous way he has when he's talking about science or parties being shit or whatever. It wasn't the content or the tone that was weird, it was just the fact that he actually seemed to
"Yes."
"That's totally a yes," Harry confirmed, "which makes my brother officially as gay as a vicar. Mum's gonna blow her nut."
John looked at him for a moment before a bark of laughter left his lips, his feet kicking sand in Sherlock's general direction. "Fuck off."
"The question, John. The one you asked me. But ask it as if you were asking yourself."
The question took John by surprise; his head twitched, eyes narrowed. "Don't be stupid. I told, you I don't have -"
Bleh.
, I'm saying very obviously that you just perfectly described yourself to me. You have to know that that's
It could have been for any number of reasons. He probably wasn't the only one who noticed the subtle changes in the dark-haired genius's body language or the palpable tension which filled the huge room from the very first time that bow met instrument, the premier note looping its way across the space between bodies and swirling through the endless heat of bodies until it reached the delicate whorl of an ear, hundreds of ears, the very vibrations of the sound coursing their way through heated veins and down to the epicentre of a place within John's self that he could not quite put a name to. He was sure he couldn't be alone in seeing the lucid, languid movement of Sherlock's arms as he dragged the horsehair across synthetic strings, the muscles in his hands rising and falling with their constant dynamism – in his prime position in front of the raised performance area John was almost achingly aware of the grace in which his friend teased the violin, his eyes tracing the fluidity in Sherlock's sway and the flutter of precise, demanding fingers against the solid neck of the instrument almost as if it were an absolute necessity not to miss a single moment of the genius and his ingenuity.
John was taking a few steps forward - soft steps, always soft, John didn’t know how soft he was but Sherlock did. For an ex-solider, he had always surprised Sherlock with quite how soft he was.
A fist curled deep inside Sherlock's pocket, preparing to use it.
"But I appreciate your... candour."
keep me in the dark."
"I know, but Lauren, she was desperate and I didn't think anything
Sherlock was already reaching towards the bowl, jaw still tense as he dipped the flannel into the water and wrung it out with his large hands; he turned back and did not look up at John as he lifted his hands and pushed the material of the ruined shirt aside to reveal the brown mess of dried blood on his skin. There was a moment where Sherlock seemed to hesitate, his eyes fixated on the large bloom of colour but just as John separated his lips to speak, the flannel was lifted and placed directly on the centre of the stain - a low breath escaped John's open lips at the feel of the warmth, his eyes closing instinctively. The flannel was still for just a second more, long enough for the both of them to feel the change of atmosphere pressing down against them and – just like in the restaurant earlier – forcing a distance and a closeness that was so unfamilar to them that for a moment it was almost as if the oxygen in the room had drained along with any hint of normalcy.
"Thank you...?"
"That wasn't part of the deal either."
Greg grinned, but this time it was smaller, kinder. He extended his hand out to John. "Good luck, all right? And, y'know... I'm your mate too. If you need to chat, text me. Or call me. Whatever."
John tensed. She'd never admitted the 'a' word before. "Harry, are you okay?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes, I'm... I'm here," John said with a slightly bigger smile than the one he'd offered Molly, trying as subtly as he could to slide out from underneath Mike's arm, "and it looks as if everyone is pretty much already sloshed. Did you save anything for me?"
wasn't right.
John had nodded, a small smile forming on his lips at the memory of their getting-to-know-you day. "Yeah, a little bit. He told me he used to pretend to be the captain of a pirate ship with his faithful first mate, Redheard the Hairy."
Sherlock held himself completely unaccountable for his actions; just as John proclaiming him not to have a romantic bone in his body was like a challenge laid out on a plate, this reference to the fear/enjoyment argument was simply too tempting, impossible to ignore. He had stepped lithely from his chair within two seconds, found himself standing in front of John within four and, within six, had his hands placed firmly upon John's legs and was leaning down with his nose brushing like a whisper against John's as he watched, up close, John's eyes snap open and focus like a shot upon his own.
John's muscles coiled, irritation tripping into anger. "So... you're pissed off at me for drinking? Is that what this is about?"
John let the silence linger for a few moments more before he gave up on it. "Was there anything else you needed to say? You
he thought to himself wryly,
"Huh." The man was clearly considering this. "Well if you don't mind, Shezza, I'm gonna have to have a little look myself. Can't risk it, you know. Lotta enemies."
Eventually John forced himself to say something. "I can probably do this part myself, Sherlock."
The voice became slightly bored, a butterflies-in-the-stomach condescending familiarity so shocking to John's already frozen form that he couldn't even bring himself to turn and face the newest addition to the room: "Considering I pay the entirety of the rent and you invited all of your friends into our house for a party I most definitely didn't agree to, yes, I think that you can afford to pay me back every penny."
"All right gang, we're going to just assume that this counts, all right?
Well. At least that answered his question.
find the words, and not for the first time with Sherlock he found himself remembering Wanda's notion that sometimes it was better to say nothing at all.
"I believe that my charming brother is insinuating that you are the reason your sister prefers the fairer sex," Mycroft said from beside his parents, glancing down the line to give a small smirk at the shortest man in the row, "or something to that effect, certainly."
Sherlock was walking towards the Observatory now – why? "If you were going to use violence you would have already done so by now."
"Jeeeesus... all right, don't kill me, fucking hell... right. Right. I'll go with what Mummy John said -" He looked a John, big grin on his face – John began to advance on him, forcing him to take a few more steps backwards, almost tripping over his own feet, " - shit, all right, I meant that I'll throw the party tomorrow. We can just get food in and cook something tonight, quiet night in."
was happening between them.
"So there was more to it than just responsibility. You… cared about what happened to me."
John shifted uncomfortably in his position on the bed. Maybe it was the dark of the room, the feeling that he'd spent hours with this stranger today merely from reading comments on course material or simply because the man was so spot-on with every assumption he made... he wasn't sure. Whatever it was, though, had made what William had ascertained just a little too... close.
on fire for an
"Relationship is a bit of an odd -"
that had reached out and grabbed the front of Sherlock's damp shirt,
"So, if you'll have me..." Sherlock's hesitation was palpable, his lips mouthing words before he spoke them as if making sure they were the right ones; John found he was suddenly able to lip-read, or in the very least he knew which words would come before they arrived in the space between them. "If you'll forgive me... I would like to resume our friendship and do with it what we can in the rubble of destruction that I have left behind."
A frown flickered onto his brow, creasing his forehead. "By... not being a total and utter failure?"
you."
But that was irrelevant. It was all to become irrelevant.
John's expression was flat, his tone even more so. “I'm not struggling with the workload. The workload is bearable.”
Nina said nothing, simply waited. It was effective. She was very good. The respect grew.
Wanda and Tim both laughed, the former pink-cheeked and clearly in high spirits. "Well, we'll just have to take you into the village and see what we can rustle up for you."
"Oh," Sherlock said, moderate interest flashing over his face, "I like that card. I hope I get that card."
The sharp jaw tilted up, eyes flashing as Sherlock looked down at him, arrogance positively
The tone of Sherlock's voice was almost overwhelmingly similar; John found himself gripping his wine glass a little tighter as he recognised it from just under a week ago, the same timbre and gentleness that he had heard as he had received his own apology from the curly-haired genius. He fought the urge to look at him, powerful as it was.
Sherlock was now entirely facing Mycroft. “You... what? What are you doing? Why are you being like this?” To Mycroft's amusement, Sherlock looked a genuine mix between horrified and disgusted; the expression alone was almost good enough a reason to force his way through this conversation. “You don't want to hear it. You don't even want to be here, that much is obvious, and trying to involve yourself in something you don't even want to acknowledge exists is possibly the most ridiculous waste of time you could endeavour to follow through. So I ask again: why are you doing this?”
Sherlock eyed the man for a moment. "Have you been to a doctor yet?"
more up my sleeve."
"Not to mention him dragging himself to your college accommodation whilst probably suffering from rather severe exhaustion," Mycroft intercepted, raising an eyebrow in John's direction. "It's all rather... interesting. I confess of course that before seeing him in your room, your bed specifically -" John cringed but said nothing, unsure if Sherlock still wanted him to go along with the insinuation that they were more than friends, " - I was very much under the impression that you were a dangerous addition to his life, that it would end up with one or both of you being...
“I’ll wake you up when he gets here,” John reassured him, gesturing towards his pillow. “Go on and lie down, you look about ready to pass out. Get some rest.”
And there it was. John Watson, apologising. John Watson apologising for something which wasn't his fault. John Watson repeating himself, repeating himself as if he were still a teenager apologising to his mother for something he wasn't responsible for. John Watson taking the blame. John Watson finding fault within himself, internalising it, making mistakes that weren't his a part of himself – only this time he wasn't made of stone. He wasn't protected by the barriers and walls that he had built up before. Some of them were still remaining, battered and bruised but still there, yet the last few months at university, the last few weeks at the cottage, the whole fucking experience of Sherlock Holmes had broken him down to such a point that he couldn't
Sherlock responded by raising an eyebrow.
Nodding absently to himself, the detective, satisfied that his John was in no immediate danger, took in the rubble of their flat. A minor whirlwind of deductions later, he turned back to the dazed soldier. “Who?”
“Who’s she? She can’t just order us around!”
“Stop looking at me that way, Dr. Watson,” chided Mrs. Hudson gently. “I’ve already told you, I’m not leaving.” She stood up to pour everyone some more tea.
John gave Sherlock a look as if he were the dull one, and then, breaking into a small smile, the doctor gave the detective’s chest a pointed look and said, “Not burned.”
Two hours later, Sherlock still wasn’t home and John was getting concerned. It wasn’t that it was so unusual for a capable, reasonably responsible adult to come home late now and then, and it wasn’t that Sherlock Holmes was in the habit of keeping his flatmate posted about his comings and goings. It was just that there was nowhere John could think of where Sherlock would be at this hour. It wasn’t like he had a girlfriend, or a boyfriend, or even a platonic friend to go out with in the evenings, and there was nothing in the way of entertainment outside their apartment that the detective found any less dull than sprawling over the couch and blasting holes in the opposite wall. No, if Sherlock was doing anything at all, it was related to either a case or an experiment.
Sherlock said nothing, allowing his glare to say it all. Mycroft smirked.
to the end of every sentence they say. For example... I am rather fucked right now...
from?"
A voice came out of the headset. "Cover the microphone all you like, boys, I can still hear you muttering away."
Sherlock stared at him. "Help you." It wasn't a question. "As in -"
"Mm." Sherlock curled his legs up underneath him and pushed himself into a standing position, graceful and lithe as ever. "Greg should be home soon, we can decide what to do about dinner when he gets here."
Sherlock's thumb pressed hard against the thrumming pulse, reading, analysing. "Tell me why."
He was trembling, much the same as he had been just a few days before whilst talking to the same man; his hands were shaking as he pulled them away from the keyboard and laced his fingers together, forcing them to stay steady, though this did nothing to alleviate the odd shaky sensation in his abdomen and the little quivers running up and down his legs. This time, however, frustration wasn't the cause. He recognised the unwelcome emotion as vulnerability, or perhaps it was closer to simply the physical reaction than the actual emotion – either way, he knew from the way his mind now buzzed and his limbs shivered that it had most likely be the sheer effort of revealing something like that to someone after months of keeping things so close to his chest, heavily protected. It wasn't as if it was something deeply personal, in fact it was almost laughable that this was his reaction, such a severe one as it was...
that doesn't understand."
"When she forced me to help her with the table linens. She was asking me about us."
John narrowed his eyes at the screen, cursing his fingers. He didn't want to thank the man for
Turning to look out of the window at the fields rushing by, he felt the now-familiar stab of apprehension at what he was headed towards. He knew, without a doubt, that he and Sherlock had made the right decision not to have his best friend accompany him to his parent's house but over the past few weeks he'd found himself far more comfortable in the company of the Holmes family than he had in the longest time; it helped that it had been a whirlwind, that much was true, but the fact that he had felt more at home at that cottage in Goring than he ever had done in his own hometown... well, now it just felt wrong to be so far from it, far from that growing 'normality'. Equally, of course, he missed university. He missed Well Place, he missed the domesticity of spending the evenings cooking or lazing about with takeaway, he missed waking up to a cup of tea on the coffee table next to him and Sherlock sitting in his armchair doing god knows what on his laptop.
Sherlock grimaced as he leaned back and stretched a long leg out to get a firm stance onto the next rock. "We didn't exactly spend much time climbing on rocks when we were children, Mycroft and I. We spent most of our time playing instruments or reading books. Or... well. I played on my own sometimes."
"Play your cards right and I'll swear a whole lot more."
“Sherlock.” Mycroft’s voice was uncharacteristically gentle, eyes less judgemental than they had been before. “You are falling apart.”
in comparison."
"At some point you're going to have to deal with it, John, and I would rather – for your sake – that you deal with it whilst you're still standing."
Sherlock sighed, looking at her with deep consternation. "I was

possible – they were certainly doing it at that moment, full-intensity and in such a way that the room no longer felt safe. Truths were being told and honesty was the name of the game, and there was no escaping it. Not even a day in and already the shit was hitting the fan.
Silence; the tap was still running.
"So much to look forward to," John groaned, placing his palms flat on the table and pushing himself into a standing position; Greg laughed, Sherlock allowing a small smile after a characteristic eye-roll, Mycroft still apparently pretending that he wasn't there as he continued to sip on his wine. "I'm going to get another round in. Another cider, Sherlock? Greg? Lager? It's on me, in celebration and all that."
does, but clearly there's something there that you don't have with anyone else right now."
The man leaned over.
"Look at me."
, just help me. Please."
Greg grunted. "I dunno. You're good at handling him. That takes
John raised his hand, stopping her in her tracks. “No. No. Let's steer clear of that last thing, all right? I know I've told you some things about my aforementioned 'psychological well-being', but I don't want to discuss it. If we're going to have this conversation, we avoid referencing any of that entirely. Agreed?”
flooded his synapses, shutting down all of the parts of himself which he needed in order to focus on the matter at hand: ah, adrenaline, yes, such a wonderful rush to his system and yet entirely unhelpful – the opposite, and the fact that he was at least able to understand that was a mercy considering he was suddenly so hideously furious at this man who would have been far better placed on the other side of the earth from John Watson that he was quite unbalanced from sheer
"Sherlock?"
“True.”
Mycroft finally glanced up, a smirk on his lips. "Perhaps John can help Sherlock butter the toast. Four hands are better than two, after all."
"Hi Mum," he offered with as much warmth as he could, reaching out and patting her forearm, "I can see you weren't expecting me this early."
"Sherlock I...." "Don't say anything John."
Sherlock bloody Holmes was kissing me!
"Where are we going Sherlock?" "I want to show you something." We arrive at a cemetery, marked "The Holmes." I say out loud. He nods opening the gate leading me somewhere.
"I didn't of course but yes."
Bang!
How come I am now?
I shoot the wall, what could they possibly want to talk to me about? Suddenly Ms. Hudson says, "Oh dear, that's my bloody wall Sherlock." "I'll pay for it and the many damages that will happen again." Delilah said from behind the fragile old woman. "Sherlock, you've got guests." Ms. Hudson says smiling and walking away. "What do you want?" I growl. "You and John....." Mycroft begins sitting down. "How do you feel around him?" Delilah interrupts, oh mummy wouldn't like that. "Confused, wanting to hold him every second, longing, I believe what they call butterflies are in my stomach...." I stop midsentence as Mycroft and De look at each other. "What is it? I whisper looking to my older sister. Her lips slightly part before she says something, clearly thinking how to put, so I would understand. She was the only one of us three that had feelings, yet she always said they were a disadvantage, although she is the smartest one of us, whether Mycroft likes to admit it or not. I'm lost in thought when De slowly says, "Sherlock, you're....." She paused as if she was upset to say it, "in love."
I did, but I love him.
"Oh shit!"
Sherlock
"What's all this racket!?" Father yelled comming into view. "Please tell me Sherlock and the young man can leave."
We walk farther through the cemetery hundreds of Holmes are buried here. But we stop in front of another grave and its marked:
Till Mummy said, "Sorry dear, I'm afraid Sherlock and John must stay."  Father mumbling about snow walked away. "Sherlock, you and John can stay in your old room." Mummy states walking away.
"Sherlock, how?" "I disappeared for a while. But I came back because I couldn't stay away from someone so dear to me." "Who?" I ask. He was silent till suddenly he screamed, "Bloody Retcon!" I jumped back in shock.
You can follow me on
He hits me with a bat.
Sherlock
Delilah
"Lets not make it easy."
"Hmmm. Fine deal."
"Anyways, John, I'll get to the point. I am Sherlock's older sister. Now this is the first time I have seen my brother happy in 20 years." "Sherlock's only 23." "My point exactly. Anyways, John you make him happy and you and I both know Sherlock does not show emotion often, or even has a sense of emotion. Just between me and you I don't even know if he is human." She laughs. She doesn't seem like a Holmes. "I'm not really getting to the point am I?" She laughs again. Why does she show emotion and they don't? She stands up to turn on the light so she can look me in the eye. "Well, he really likes you and Mycroft and I think he is in love, but we're not sure." She says quickly I almost didn't understand her. "Okay, okay. I'm sorry, let me talk slower, ha-ha a 25 year should get this nervous around something like this." I notice she is scratching her arms as she talks. "I just, I don't know what to do right he's my little brother and everything." Her arm starts to bleed. "You're bleeding!" I cut her off. She looks down at her arms, "Oh that, ha-ha. That's nothing, but I really must be going." She says walking out of my room, when she closes my door and walks down the stairs, I hear Mycroft yell, "Jesus Christ Delilah!" "I'm sorry!" she squealed. I could hear the tears in her voice. One minute she was laughing about it and now she is crying. What was she hiding from me? I lied in bed listening to their conversation for hours almost about to fall asleep when I hear something interesting. "Yeah, I guess it would be safe to go home now." Mycroft said. "I'm sure John is awake still, maybe talk to him or play the violin." Delilah says "Stay safe okay De." "Yeah, haha. Way to open old wound right?" she laughs but I can tell it's not a joke. The door slams, Sherlock begins playing the violin. I'm drifting to sleep when I suddenly recognize the song he is playing. 'We Wish You a Merry Christmas'. The last thing on my mind was: tomorrow is Christmas.
All they did was try and try. They wanted to get on their father's good side but that only made their father hate them even more. Its almost as if The Holmes didn't want children. The kids often found themselves wondering: Why did they have kids if they didn't want them? You'd think with Mr. Holmes beating them and swearing in different languages, the neighbors would call the police. But they never did. Everybody was scared of The Holmes.
And I can't stop till the whole world knows my name. Cause I was only born inside my dreams. Until you die  for me. As long as there is a light my shadows over you. Cause Im the opposite of amnesia.
"Do you know what Sherlock did for those 10 years?" "No, John only Sherlock knows."
Sherlock
"I don't understand how Sherlock cannot invite John!" Delilah shouted. "Young lady if you do not keep your tone down!" Who I am assuming is Mr. Holmes yelled. Delilah shut right up after that. Sherlock shut the door loudly. "Me and John are here!" He yelled. Everyone arguing in the other room came out to meet me. "John." Mycroft said shaking my hand. "Nice to see you again." Delilah says. She kisses me on each cheek, as her father scoffs. "So you're John." Mr. Holmes says. Mycroft coughs behind him. I shake his hand nodding yes. Mrs. Holmes looks at me as if I am a disappointment, maybe this was a bad idea.....
Delilah, not even startled says, "Going off into Sherlock land, palace, or whatever you call it."
"He has 23 hours to find you if he is even a second late I kill you."
He shot John.
"Now!" I yell bitterly
Was he hurt?
The children were in Mycroft's room sitting on the floor in a triangular shape, while Delilah spoke. "He obviously isn't part of our family. He is lying about his name. He is gay. He is young, not much older than you Mycroft, 20, or 22?" She wasn't finished when Jim busted through the door. "You!" He pointed at Sherlock, "with me, now!" Sherlock got up with pleading eyes. As soon as the door closed. "And is into little boys...." Delilah whispered. Mycroft looked at the clock and sure enough it was 11pm Mrs. Holmes was fast asleep. They both silently got up following the path that lead to Jim's room. Stopping by the door and listening. Sure enough, Sherlock was crying, trying to scream. Delilah not wanting to see Jim naked had no idea what to do. Mummy wouldn't believe them and if Mycroft ran in he would rape him too. Mycroft and Delilah looked at each other then slowly walked away. Delilah went to play the piano, knowing it would calm everyone down just a tad, Mycroft went to play the violin. (A/N the song above.) They played it all through the night, until the sun started to rise and Mrs. Holmes walked into the living room annoyed.
How is no one awake? I walk out of Sherlock's room and knock on the black door. "Oh, John." She very noticeably pulls her shirt so it is covering the shorts she is wearing. "I didn't think it would be you. Haha, um did I wake you?" "Um, yes." "Oh, I'm terribly sorry. It's just they sleep like bears in the winter and this is the only time I can listen to music like this." "Its okay." I laugh, " You're a good singer." "Thanks."
After father got up and left mummy told us to sit here and continue eating. John looked mortified as he slowly ate his food. When we were all finished, mummy told Mycroft to show John around the house.
"Ta, ta!" Jim walks out.
Delilah
"Did you like my present?"
They're all going to prison.
Congratulations brother -M.H.
I pull out my phone and text Sherlock. Which is something I never really have done after getting off work before but I feel like I should this time.
"Oh hell no!"
I clear my throat. "I had to kill someone, being 20 and needing money I almost did. But curiosity got the better of me. I asked 'When did you start killing people?' You know what they said, 'Every single person you have stolen something from dies' I quit. Unlike others Jim didn't kill me, he let me go. He thought I was going to crawl back, but I didn't. I got my dream job and found you."
"Lets not make it easy!" I pause trying to pin point Jims location.
As soon as we were back at the flat I said, "Alright I'll tell you."
"58 minutes." I mumble. I throw some papers around till one catches my eye. "I got it! 587 Aero street!"
I run to the police station. On my way there I see John dropped is phone. Never a good sign.
(See the end of the chapter for
I don't realize I'm laughing until I receive a stern look from father and mummy asks me what's so funny. "Ask Mike." I chuckle. Receiving another stern look, "Sorry father." I mumble. Mycroft smirks, "Mummy, I do have reason to believe Sherlock is in love." "With a male or female?" Father asks. Mycroft simply bows his head. "That is quite enough dinner tonight." Father gets up and walks away. "Right now we'll be going to our room." Mummy replies disappointed in, not father, but my brothers and I.
"If you need anything my room is two doors down. Its the black one, and Mycrofts is the blue one. Although I don't recommend bothering him. Umm... oh! We're not allowed out of the rooms past 11 unless told to by Mummy or Father or working." I look over to the clock. "But it's 11:05 right now." "Oh shit! Goodnight, sorry I didn't have time to grab you a spare mattress!" Delilah yelled running out the door. "Oof! Aw! Fuck, Mycroft!" I'm assuming she bumped into Mycroft and now the two are arguing.
