The movement of Dean's hand stilled and it took several beats until he whispered in reply, "We will."
"Sure," the kid said, not even hesitating over the choice to leave the lantern behind with Dean. Those angel senses of his were still weird to witness after having spent the last day in the conviction that Jack was human now.
Sam exhaled, set down the mug, left his fingers pressed against the edge of the table. "But, Dean, this is God we're talking about. And he just snapped away humanity with nothing but a thought! Everyone..."
"An angel," Dean echoed flatly and a humorless chuckle broke free from his lips that stopped abruptly when he saw the seriousness on Castiel's face. "Why would an angel... just
Dean released a quiet sigh into the darkness of the room and spent a long while staring at nothing before his eyes finally closed again and his breathing evened out. Castiel waited a little longer to ensure that Dean's sleep was sufficiently deep before he reached out with his grace.
When he finally made it to the top of the canyon, he hoisted that battered body that wasn't his over the edge. Then he just lay on his back, too exhausted to move, and drew in deep, heaving breaths.
Jack finally lost his fight against gravity and stumbled to his knees near the brothers, the movement another sharp tear at his insides. Something trickled out of his nostrils and down over his lips. Breathing was hard, finding his voice impossible. He reached out and touched Dean's arm as the hunter started spreading the silvery powder over the symbols that were already finished.
In the face of the rising volume of Dean's emotions, Castiel actively resisted the urge to point out that even in his weakened state, he'd be able to process a multitude of information at once because that was how angels were designed, and that he'd
The black veins redoubled their effort to stifle the light in Balthazar's angelic form, and Castiel groaned in tension, balled their hands into fists. Even just sending memories Dean's way proved almost too much, but he conjured the image of a boy wearing a ridiculous red and white outfit, looking up at him with trust in his eyes the moment Castiel stabbed him. Dean wasn't quite fast enough to conceal his shock about this revelation, and Castiel felt it weaken the connection, make him lose ground in his fight against the essence of the Empty.
Rowena and Sam finally noticed they were no longer alone and looked up sharply when Jack and Dean stepped out of the shadow from the other half of Rowena's luxurious chamber. Jack felt uncomfortable having interrupted an important topic like this, especially when Sam's eyes widened at the sight of him.
"Hey, don't you dare! I'm still eating that!" The words had not been directed at Jack, but at an empty spot somewhere near the kitchen table.
It was awkward returning to the kitchen and sitting down at the table with Jack, but the boy had either learned a very good poker face by now, or he truly wasn't fazed by anything that had happened because the way he had grown up, crazy was just a regular day. Sam cleared his throat and Dean unceremoniously placed a plate of fresh fruits and a glass of milk in front of him before returning to his own bowl of cereal.
The circling had brought them nearer to the door. So close, they were so close. Sam tightened his grip on the scalpel.
Sam and Rowena rushed towards the door while the demons struggled to get back to their feet. With the witch just one step behind him, Sam bolted out into the hallway, but skidded to a stop when he heard her hiss in pain. The torturer had taken hold of her arm, his fingers digging roughly into flesh as she was pulled back over the door sill and into the room. A blade was pressed against her throat, one of the tools that had fallen to the ground just before.
He focused back on the inside of the car, just in time to hear Dean mutter "NUTS!" in reaction to the soft clangor of lines appearing on the windshield after a particularly large hailstone had collided with it. Hearing this word pronounced with such force would have been nothing less than absurd in the company of the other Winchesters. No matter how similar these doppelgangers looked, Castiel was all too aware of the multitude of differences between them and the friends he'd come to value above all else. Them and Jack.
She took that as the peace offering it was and actually smiled, though it was a tired, lost thing. Sam felt too worn out to smile back. Voices sounded somewhere behind them, high up in the palace, yelling something that was too far away to understand. But it sufficed to bring them back to the present. In unspoken agreement, they abandoned the cage and continued on their path through skeletons and rocks, towards the outline of distant cliffs touched by lightning.
He who had room in his heart to love angels more than God ever had, enough so that he would risk his own life for an angel and a nephilim, beings that weren't even the same species as him. The Righteous Man who kept fighting when everyone else had already laid down their arms. He who now held the faith of the whole world on his shoulders, able to perceive the true face of angels. This was Castiel's legacy. An apology in actual words had been outside Naomi's reach, but she would pick up his beacon and carry it to the edge of time itself, up to Earth's very last second.
Dean shrugged. "You're still you. Powers are overrated. Choices are what matters, and that you're still here to make them, Jack. That matters, too. You're part of the team that will fix this whole mess. And I know you wanted to help in that fight, I do. But the best ways to help don't end with you dead, you know?"
Something kicked Sam's shin in return, tearing his gaze away from the empty chair and back to his brother. Dean wore a lighthearted grin on the outside, but there was something very different beyond that—this new, quiet intensity burning behind his eyes that Sam still didn't know what to think of. Unshakable in his own right now, somehow.
Knowing the difference he'd made touched him in a way he hadn't expected. He felt a lump forming in his throat and blinked several times, gently pressing her hand.
to be a prisoner of the cycle that suffering begets suffering, but I thought I could break that cycle now." She finally met his gaze, her eyes shimmering in forlorn intensity. "If redemption exists, if evil truly can be redeemed, then so can Hell, aye? And if it can't, that means..."
The chasm seemed to have stabilized by now, no more earth breaking away. Stepping closer to the edge, he felt a buzz all around him coming from the gap they had torn into reality, hovering directly above the wide abyss.
"It stopped us from driving right into the middle of this freak storm," Dean said, his eyes fixed on the road. Castiel saw his jaw clench in an achingly familiar display of barely suppressed stress. Dean's words made him wish he could claim even this shred of usefulness for himself, but the truth was, he'd had no idea about the thunderstorm. It had been nothing but a coincidence that he'd prevented the brothers from driving straight into its core. Perhaps he made a better banshee than he did an angel. Heaven knew he'd never been any good at that.
, he felt as he watched a flash of light burn the life out of someone he had just stabbed in the back.
That rhythm was quieted now, as her gaze followed the lines of Sam's face, her own grief mirrored in the shadows under his eyes. Something in her chest constricted. When everything had come crumbling down around them as the direct result of her last reckless decision, he was the one who had borne the brunt of that blow, crushed almost beyond recognition under the debris. She'd never meant for that to happen. Least of all to him, out of everyone.
Castiel was shoved aside roughly, felt the demonic presence seize control and steer them into the spot that had absorbed the rocks, just as a numbing onslaught of visual and acoustic stimuli broke out nearby.
with a frequency far too high to risk anything here. First impressions especially had a tendency to blow up into his face, and he couldn't afford to lose this chance.
The lumps of ice falling from the sky grew in size and Jack tried his best to shield his head with his jacket. They crested the incline, and there, just on the other side, the cabin's wooden roof came into view. Jack's heart beat faster as he and Roderick lurched down the slope side by side.
If only he could manage to forget himself, to forget every pivotal point in his life that had led down the road to who he was now, this torturous cycle might come to an end. There would be nothing left of him to torment with regret over regret, with one bad decision cascading into a landslide of destruction. He craved oblivion. Perhaps that was the essence of the Empty.
He saw additional demons stream into the room and tried to push his blade into the stomach of the one holding him down, only to have a violent shove against his arm fling the weapon away. The telltale sound of ethereal flickering told him Sam had been more successful, but the newly arrived demons cut Sam off from him. With his arm now pinned down, he struggled and kicked aimlessly. Then a sudden thud hurled the demon away from him, lifting the weight from his chest and letting him breathe again.
. Erased. Along with every other friend who had still been left at that point. He couldn't, he just couldn't—
"Just—just give me a moment, okay?" Sam pleaded, inhaling a few steadying breaths. "The last thing I remember is us, in Hell, surrounded by demons. Where
"Well, for one thing, I've run into a bit of a problematic situation, here. Caught between a rock and a hard place, so to speak." Oddly, the voice chuckled at that. "You see, I'm—ah, injured. But I think we can be of assistance to each other."
that was loud in his ears. Jack waited, tensely, for the final impact, but the sounds only got muffled the further the rock descended until silence blanketed him once more.
"Show me how to heal you," was what left his mouth instead. He didn't even know where that had come from, and he only realized that he really meant it—in every possible connotation—once the words were already spoken. The dark bruise on her cheek was unacceptable, something he couldn't just leave like it was, something he had to
certainly wasn't something he'd expected to hear, least of all from an actual angel. Something warm unfolded in their body and Dean failed to stop another smile from running over their face, sensing Sam's squint without even seeing it. He couldn't help it, he was starting to like this angel—what had he said his name was? Castiel?
"I did not give you permission to touch me like that," Rowena told the empty spot where the demon had been. A bruise was beginning to form on her cheek, her hair stuck out every which way and the grin tugging at her bloodied lip gave an unhinged quality to all of it. Sam stared at the angel blade in her hand.
"Screw you, all of you! You hear me?" Sam yelled over the noise and threw his head back in bitter laughter, even as a gash appeared across his cheek.
The newly awakened were still too unfocused to reply, but he had been able to sense their presence, knew with certainty he was no longer the sole recipient of messages sent into the web of angelic telepathy. And then he finally received words that weren't his own, sent to him directly as a personal prayer.
"Get. Out. Of. Him," Jack pressed out between clenched teeth, with the side of his face pushed against the ground. He spit out a leaf that had somehow ended up sticking to his lips and suddenly noticed lines on the floor near his nose, no longer concealed by the cover of leaves. Lines he himself had drawn not long ago. The X carved into the tree's bark confirmed that this was indeed the spot of Jack's devil's trap, no longer functional now that its borders were smeared from the fight.
"How long is this going to hold them?" Jack asked and regretted speaking instantly because he was afraid his voice had betrayed him, strained against his pain. The last thing anyone needed right now was to worry about him. He tried to support his weight against the table surreptitiously.
Dean's words from last night echoed in his head. But how was he supposed to know what the right choice was?
"The damage a bomb of that magnitude could do would be considerable," Rowena mused. "Quite possibly enough to threaten the structural integrity of whatever plane of existence it exploded in."
be feeling. They were too heavy to bear for any single person, so he kept them locked away in a box, untouched, with the echo of his own wails of grief still loud in his ears.
Dean threw his legs over the side of the bed, put on his shoes and exited the room through the broken door. Sheltered by the overhang of the roof, he rubbed over the bridge of his nose and stared quietly into the rainfall that replaced the earlier hailstorm and pattered clamorously against the roof and the parked cars.
"I'm...," he said, then stopped when he realized what a miserable croaking sound had just escaped his mouth instead of an actual word. He cleared his throat before trying again. "I'm fine." He opened his eyes to give her a look that he
If Dean caused a repeat of that fight now, nobody would be there to intervene this time, to bridge that gap between them. Not Dad, not anyone. They were alone in this new world, just him and Sam. And he'd broken the promise to never let things get as bad again, to make decisions as a team. What he'd done stood in defiance of the volatile balance they'd worked on for
from a few months ago and thought I had lost the ability to continue what I had started. But whenever I get over myself and stop doubting and start writing, the words start flowing out of me (even the characters do stuff on their own! My initial plan was to start the whole thing with passage into the Empty at a later point, but of course Dean refused to wait even a moment longer and pushed Rowena into the research). That's what being a prophet must feel like, huh?
Sam snorted softly at that and leaned his head back against the wall. They spent a moment in silence and his eyes shut again on their own accord. "I just... just need a minute," he murmured, each word a sting in his sore throat.
There was the sudden noise of Dean's cereal bowl scraping over the table behind Dean, and Jack was hastily leaning over to catch it in time before it could fall over the edge. Dean's gaze darkened in something that Sam had come to recognize as fake outrage while pointing into the room.
"He had a croissant once," the voice said. Jack understood enough about sarcasm by now to realize this was probably it. But what would have been a snide remark under different circumstances actually sounded... warm, somehow. As if the person on the other end was smiling. "Jack, how old are you?"
Silence claimed the motel room, broken only by the noises of the thunderstorm outside. Quite contrary to his words, Dean lay on his back with eyes wide open, toying with the bracelet once more. Castiel wondered if Dean's thoughts were as loud as his own, if they were what was keeping him awake. With a tinge of guilt, he realized they'd never really spared much consideration for the fate of these two men who had been forced to leave their entire universe behind.
"Us, resisting—it may be the only thing that's keeping this world spinning right now," Sam stated tiredly, searching out Rowena's eyes, then added with a sigh, "What's left of it, at least."
In one well-aimed motion, he flung the scalpel towards the leg of Rowena's captor. The sharpened edge buried itself deep into the demon's skin and, either in pain or in surprise, he flinched and lost his grip on the weapon he had used to threaten Rowena.
With a deep sigh, he averted his gaze from the chasm and spotted the abandoned backpacks that had miraculously survived the cataclysm, placed just far enough away to be unaffected. He grabbed one at random, strapped it on his back, and reached out with his senses to follow the stream of one of the leylines.
"Sam." Dean said only this one word, but managed to imbue it with so much meaning that Sam was finally spurred into action, dropping his backpack next to theirs and stepping right up to Jack.
"We don't have to eat either," Roderick continued. "Then again, demons usually have no intention of returning their vessel to its original owner and couldn't care less if the meatsuit lives or dies."
"Because," she said, finally letting her hand touch his cheek instead of hovering. "It turns out I have excellent taste after all."
Whatever Jack was thinking about any of this, he was guarding it carefully and just nodded. Dean steered him into the circle with a gentle pull at his arm. The probably last three people on Earth left through a rift made of fire and light.
Jack detached the lantern from the wall and lit the way into a country house that smelled of the wood planks it was built with and the white flowers on a side table near the entrance. Homey. Welcoming. Deceptively safe. Flipping the light switches on and off in the hallway—or any other room—had no effect whatsoever. Judging by the temperature inside, the heaters weren't working either. Ever since humanity had disappeared, Dean had been wondering how long things like electricity would keep working. Now he had the answer: apparently not very long.
He was floating inside his own mind. For once, not drowning under the weight of it all, but floating on top of it. Unsure how much time had passed, he barely registered that Rowena must have stopped talking quite a while ago.
He heard the huff of Jack's chuckle, and the silence was comfortable now as they continued. After a time, he felt the entirety of Sam's weight on his shoulder when Jack let go and rushed ahead. "We're almost there. There are stairs, be careful."
The mental attacks continued, each demon's touch slightly different, but all of them tried to gain control and got repelled in the same manner. The warding tattoo on his chest warmed up. Frustration was almost a tangible thing in the misty air around him when the separate smoke forms in the cloud began to turn against each other in their fight for dominance.
"It's good to have you back, Sam," Jack said, placing the bowl back to its initial position like nothing out of the ordinary had occurred with it.
Rowena cut off his string of doubts with a gentle hand against the side of his face. "Sam, this is a good thing. Normal isn't what is needed right now. Here's to being extraordinary. Together."
Both of them moved their blades at the same time in the attempt of a lethal stab, but once more metal hit only metal instead of flesh. Jack was faster in pulling back his arm for a surprise attack aimed lower than before, but Roderick used the battle-hardened strength of Dean's body—broken though it was—to knock both of them off their feet instead.
"Christ, Jack. I—" Dean rubbed over the bridge of his nose, closed his eyes, breathed out. "I once told him he was dead to me.
Jack had been sitting on the backseat in silence the whole way, but now he finally spoke, "We'll find something."
feel vulnerable for a banshee to latch onto it, if the circumstances are right," Dean said, his voice carefully factual. "Might be enough that any other person would feel it in the same situation."
The smile forming on their face didn't belong to either of them alone. Castiel had never appreciated this version of Dean more than in the moment he simply chose a direction at random, grabbing Sam's arm to pull him around the thorny bushes, both hunters yelling the name of Castiel's son at the top of their lungs without ever having seen the nephilim for more than a few disoriented seconds during their arrival in this universe.
Only now realizing that his fingers had been digging into the wooden surface of the table, Jack let go with a shaky exhale. He felt completely unable to form any words, but Roderick didn't seem to mind, carrying on with his monologue as if nothing was amiss.
Not even bothering to hide his eye roll this time, Castiel complied and repeated the call, with the same effect.
The angel didn't show any reaction to his reassurance, growing weaker by the second. Dean had to get through to him. There was no time for self-doubt, no time for hesitance.
Dean narrowed his eyes in concentration, trying to figure out the exact meaning of this string of words. The moment he caught himself tilting his head slightly, a shiver of recognition ran over his skin. Shit. This was so far beyond... how had he never known? How had he never seen this? And why was everyone who was far more qualified for this conversation either unconscious or outright not here?
The demon's body near his own tensed up, then went very still. Jack thought Roderick would extricate himself, but after two more heartbeats, Jack felt hands on his back.
to repent for so many things, so many angels she had wronged. Those who'd still found enough sanity and goodness in themselves, even after all this time, to question cruelty, those who deserved least of all to be punished.
And then Sam smiled. An honest-to-God, genuine smile of the kind he'd thought he'd lost forever. It should have been impossible.
"No!" Jack pressed out past a lump in his throat, shaking his head in denial even as his legs kept running.
for encouraging me through the insanity that was this chapter, and everyone who has left such breathtakingly kind comments after my previous chapters! You're all amazing!
"I wish I knew," Sam replied, risking a glance at Dean who seemed to have caught himself again and was looking back at the board with them. Dean shrugged. The pebble's movements became erratic, leaving the board entirely, and Sam could only assume that interacting with the material world so often in such a short time was taking its toll on Rowena.
Sam was fighting a doomed battle against the memory of utter despair, watching Dean slowly drift away from life in a hospital bed. How completely powerless Sam had felt then, more so with every minute that had ticked by without being able to
listen to me," Castiel spoke hurriedly. "I'm not what you think. I'm an ally, a—a friend. I don't serve God, not anymore. God is a threat, to the world, to all of us. And the other Dean is—" Castiel balled his fists helplessly. "He's in danger. I need your help to save him. I'll answer all of your questions to the best of my ability." His voice grew rough in undisguised vulnerability. "But
Dean was the only one unaffected by the smiting, at least physically. Still lying on the floor and pressing a hand against the side of his neck, he glanced back and forth between Castiel and the pile of corpses, dazed. When Castiel had covered all but the last few steps of distance between them, he slowed down to a measured walk and approached the hunter. He lowered the hand he'd used to channel the smiting and extended it to help Dean up from the floor.
Sam hesitated at the end of the passage, glancing back at the last torch they had passed. It was tempting to bring it, but without much cover to hide behind, it would glow like a beacon, visible at great distance for anyone attempting to chase them. He sighed and left the light behind to follow Rowena out into the drizzle of rain that fell from an unnatural sky. It kept the stone beneath their feet glinting in perpetual wetness.
"Try leading my hand?" he offered again. "That worked for Dean back then, and it should be less problematic than full-out possession, right?"
"Oh, for... not this again, Samuel!" Dean exclaimed and Castiel could feel Dean's annoyance flare up in their shared mind while Dean dried his face with his sleeve, then fastened his own seatbelt and reached for his phone to connect it with the car.
Jack's steps over a wooden floor were audible, then there was the sound of a match being lit. Seeing the small flame was an enormous relief. Hell, seeing
The gates swung open to reveal the throne room, now tinged in red from the window above that marked the change of rulership over Hell. Rowena stood the moment her eyes fell on them, the haste in her movement betraying her, even though her face gave nothing away. She watched Dean enter in silence, then Sam, then Jack, her gaze lingering on the open gate as if she was expecting someone else to follow.
"Us," Dean said, stepping up right next to Sam again. "Killing each other in some sort of shitty, dramatic showdown. Me killing Sam, Sam killing me, both of us killing each other, he's tried it all. Put the guns into our hands, but couldn't get us to pull the triggers."
Without electricity, the room's interior was lit only by the apocalyptic gloom coming from the sole window, and by the occasional flash of lightning. Hammering sounds against the roof were a continuous reminder of the hailstorm raging outside. The wooden exit door sported a hole in its middle and didn't sit quite right in its hinges any longer, but it was still able to keep out the brunt of the cold and grant the room a semblance of safety. Sam perched on one of the beds, massaging his temples, while Dean paced the dark room.
the energy of the other realm, so close. His other half, the one he'd thought lost. He could only hope that enough of it remained for the transition.
Sam had found his footing just as fast as she had, but she could see how weakened he was in the way he was swaying until one of his hands met the cave wall for support. In what had to be the most obvious sign of her decreasing sanity as of yet, she positioned herself in front of Sam, squaring her shoulders. She was already dead. No longer a powerful witch, just the dead daughter of a tanner in a torn dress without shoes, with madness in her eyes and only a single thing left to lose in the world. Her gaze glued to the cave entrance, she felt Sam's hand on her upper arm, resisted the attempt to get pulled back towards the wall. From the corner of her eye, she saw him step right up next to her.
"I was gravely mistaken," she said and let that wide-eyed wonderment roam over his face. "You aren't a Student, you never were."
The slap-bang transition into absolute silence was even more jarring than the noise of a world falling apart had been. His head was reeling with it. Last night had been dark, but
The 'alive' part of that sentence had Sam frown in confusion. Said witch stood rigidly upright, chin lifted in defiance, but he could see beyond that by now. He sensed the spark of desperation behind the tense set of her shoulders, behind the way her brows were drawn together. Then her lips twitched. And that was the exact moment he realized she was
As more lines of the disputed song blared from the car's speakers, Sam slapped Dean's hand on the steering wheel, only to receive a slap to the back of his hand in return.
As if this, of all the things they'd shared, had grown too intense for her, she suddenly let go of his hand and got to her feet, talking more to herself than to Sam, "If I can't direct the flow of magic myself, an elemental conduit will facilitate channeling the natural forces."
That sentence turned the warmth in their body into a heat that was searing in its urgency to follow the direction of the prayer. If
Spontaneous combustion seemed like a valid course of action in the knowledge that Castiel had ruined his best chance to save Dean.
"Like hell I will," Sam countered, and felt in full control of his voice again for the first time since his breakdown.
He turned their body to face the small lump of mineral that looked incredibly out of place on the black floor. That got Dean's full attention and their mouth opened in astonishment just the moment a second rock came flying. Castiel memorized the angle it had taken.
Lifting his shoulders to brace himself against the cold, he surveyed their surroundings, Dean and Jack stepping up to his left and right. He could see nothing but fields, pastures, a few scattered trees, the distant treeline of a forest, and an empty road. The momentum from before, when they had still been packing their supplies, had left him.
It took Jack a moment to realize that the motionless pile of Dean was no longer asleep and was, in fact, looking directly at him.
"I had my own reasons to research this. You see, it is a topic of grave impact on realmatic theory and it could forever revolutionize the outdated Almanach of the Arcane on portal transit."
Chuck suddenly held his head, a pained noise escaping him as his eyes flashed blue, then black, then blue again. "Shut
Hearing his own name this way was never going to be not creepy. Jesus. He wasn't even going to try sorting through whatever this word string had been. With a last touch of warmth to his chest, the orange light faded into nothing, leaving Dean's world thoroughly shaken to its core. He had no words, absolutely none, to describe what had just happened when Jack quietly said his name.
was an angel banishing sigil, even if slightly modified. Sigils don't usually kill their targets, Jack. I'd know, tried them more than once. Angels always tend to stick their celestial noses where they don't belong."
It wasn't exactly a new experience for Jack not to grasp every nuance of the things being said in his presence. Sometimes he'd felt like he understood only half of the things Dean uttered. Right now, though, he was growing frustrated because the awareness that he was required to
. Of a regular stupid injury. The few of us who are left, we need each other, we have to protect each other. We can't—please, I can't—I can't lose anyone else. He's my son and I can't lose him. I'm—I'm in the middle of nowhere and I'm all alone and there's nothing I can do to save him. But you can. I need your help,
something, that he was the one who had to fix it all, still burned insistently somewhere in the back of his mind.
"Together," he repeated and huffed out a laugh, utterly incredulous over the next words forming on his tongue. "We have a throne to reclaim and a world to save."
"What the...," Chuck muttered and stumbled backwards. He looked around himself in clear confusion, but seemed unable to detect Jack's presence in any way.
Jack swallowed and gave Roderick a thin smile in thanks that he acknowledged with an eyeroll, but Jack could swear he'd also seen a smile there before the demon averted his face. The hand remained on his arm after that, pulling him onwards over an upwards slope in the terrain.
A white fog appeared that gave a faraway quality to everything Dean said, like a wall separating them.
"I saw something in a dream, all right?" was what finally left his lips, a careful half-truth instead of more lies.
More by accident than anything else, his eyes found the notepad next to the candle, saw the writing that hadn't been there when he'd fallen asleep. The content of the note made him sputter, coughing out the liquid in his surprise. Choking on air he didn't need, he stared at the words, read them again and again until something inside of him
"All right, I will," Jack swore solemnly, watching as Roderick unpacked the bag's contents, placing them on the table one by one. After a moment spent in silence, Jack said with a glance at the rations, "You're the only demon I know. Do demons eat? Do they get tired?"
do hugs now," Jack reasoned, remembering the way every single embrace in his life had made him feel, easing whatever burden he was carrying at the time by just that small bit that made all the difference. With a twinge of sympathy, he imagined how terrible it would have been not to be allowed even this small comfort in a world that was far too confusing and cruel.
The sizzling returned and the humanoid outline sharpened, taking the familiar shape of Rowena. "You have something much better than notes, dear," she said before vanishing in a series of flickers.
He barely had any strength left, and even the most basic interactions with the physical world without a vessel took their toll on him. But he had to try. Focusing on the car's audio system once more, he combed through the data until he found what he was looking for. The speakers came back to life for a sequence of only two words, taken from separate songs with entirely different singers.
Rowena smirked at her own words, once more bringing her fingers to his lips and following their contour from one corner of his mouth to the other in a tingling curve. His body heeded her silent call, smiling when what he actually thought was that he was losing his mind. There was no way... they couldn't possibly...
"It all went wrong. I couldn't fix anything and Death sent me to explode in the Empty instead. I made it all
"I so would! Remember when I returned your guitar to the store because you wouldn't let me do my reports in peace? You didn't believe me I would do that either."
How was it possible, then, that Cas had found true happiness at the end of the world, while humanity was fizzling out around them like candles? While it seemed that every force in existence was trying to end them? Nothing made sense anymore. The world had lost the thread of coherence that had been so hard for him to piece together in the three years of his life.
Both parties began circling each other in a wide arc, keeping a careful distance between them. If Rowena could get the demons to move a little more, they might be able to make a run for the door. Sam swallowed, trying his hardest not to let anyone see the beads of sweat settling on his forehead or the restrained urgency behind his movements.
He gasped, his first deep breath in minutes, taken more in surprise than anything else. Eyes were focused intensely on his. "
His next words were laced with the pain he had carried for so long. "Tee-bee-beh-peh ee moh-fah-fah-ess."
to him in a matter of a few years than his celestial body had for eons. He suspected the company he'd been with had a large part to play in that.
sleep. Roderick probably needed it, as did Dean, broken as his body was. Jack hadn't meant to fall asleep, though, not knowing how much time remained for any of them, for the world as a whole.
He turned to meet Dean's gaze. Words were unnecessary in mutual recognition of the storm they saw raging behind each other's eyes. Jack loosely held out both of his hands at his sides, let the energy stream around the tips of his fingers, and nodded at a question that was never asked.
He felt a tremor, a disturbance that reached to the core of his angelic being. And it had nothing to do with the emotions stirred up by the confrontation with his regrets from the past. Their human body felt it, too, tension in every muscle, small hairs straightening up in repeated danger signals all over skin.
"Sam?" she asked, her voice soft again in that way that was so unlike her. It sounded smaller than the person she was.
He pressed a hand to his forehead in a sudden dizziness. Rowena's grip on his arm tightened, steadying him as she led him into the opening to a shallow cave. He stumbled over to the far wall. As soon as he reached it, his knees just gave in and he sank down, leaning his back against the rock and closing his eyes.
Advancing with care, his grace probed further into the other celestial being until he met the slightest sign of resistance, at which he halted immediately. He didn't mean to intrude, merely to lend strength in what he knew to be a hopeless pit that was nearly impossible to escape without assistance. "Moh-oh-oh-ah-hoh eh-see-ah-sah-kah-hoh."
To Hell with the habit of giving a damn about the opinion of people he hated, who hated him in turn.
He wasn't convinced he deserved to be led out of this darkness, but the gentle warmth around him was insistent. It built a fortress around his identity, prevented him from losing himself again. It reminded him there was a reason to remember. Everything culminated in a single thought, an idea, a truth so unlike all of his regrets.
Sam. The expression on your face was the last thing I saw on Earth, and I didn't let go of it even in the afterlife. I clung to it when they started the torture, and I clung to it when I made a deal to get out of the torture chambers. Your tears were what I saw when I decided to break that deal and seize the throne myself."
She'd be amused by that, if the world wasn't falling apart. If not God's own hand would bring about the killing blow, then the moment Heaven could no longer contain the billions upon billions of souls certainly would. And yet, here she was at the end of times, unable to prevent any of it. She'd been left to rot in a cell specifically constructed to feed its energy barriers with the grace of its inhabitant, leaving the angel inside weakened. They
"That is a definite plus in my book. We'd be going the wrong way now if you couldn't." The following silence was hard to read without seeing the kid's face, so Dean prodded, "Does it really matter what you are?"
"I... hope you can understand me better than I you. Uhm... vessels, yeah. I heard they're out of fashion now. So, can you still heal Jack without a vessel?"
The sluggishness of his mind was something he certainly wasn't used to and the dull ache in his borrowed bones wasn't exactly a pleasant welcome back to consciousness either. Still, all of that was no excuse for how long it took him to realize there was no breathing other than his own inside the room.
As had to be expected, the black tendrils appeared and tried to reclaim what they had stolen, cut into Balthazar right alongside the strand of Castiel's grace that was hovering near the fringe of the body of violet light. What he hadn't expected was the way his grace was suddenly no longer rejected. His friend of past times grasped for it, clung to it as the tendrils sent violent shivers through his being.
"Yeah, we clearly have no taste," he teased, pressing her hand while dipping a finger of his other hand into the water held by the shoe.
He also grabbed the pillows and blankets from the double bed, and a third blanket from one of the other rooms, before returning downstairs. Jack had apparently finished his work with the salt lines and was back in the living room, staring into the flames. He turned at the noise of Dean pushing the mattress in front of the fireplace and tilted his head at the sight.
she yelled with a hand movement towards the tide of demons swarming them, and he could tell from the look on her face that she had known in advance the spell wouldn't have any effect. Her eyes met his and her lips formed
this, the common ground he shared with the humans he loved. The immediate experience of sensory input. Breathing that was his own. Hands that could touch. And most importantly, a voice that could be heard. Everything that made him compatible with human existence.
Following a vague feeling, Castiel was suddenly convinced of the utmost importance of that strange expression Dean had used. He searched his memories for where he had heard the term 'man bun' before.
His declaration was met with nothing but silence. Time seemed to slow down to a crawl as he waited tensely for any kind of reaction. Because he had lost any objectivity in the matter and didn't want to ruin his plan by stepping out of his hiding place prematurely, he forced himself to count to twenty in his head. When still nothing happened, he left the cover of the trees. The icy wind blew against the tears on his face and his body shivered. The field was empty.
Suddenly, impossibly, a touch of warmth grazed him amidst it all. He heard something, a word, a powerful word, reaching him through a connection that could not be. As fast as it had appeared, it was gone again, leaving him only with the vague impression of a feeling that was different, that didn't belong in this place, that made him stronger. The blurry image of a different face came with it.
Despite their earlier conversation and the embrace, Jack couldn't help the nagging feeling of doubt if maybe this had been a mistake. Dean turned and gave him a tired, thin smile, though, so it couldn't have been all wrong.
Sam watched in disbelief as Rowena, armed with nothing but an angel blade, stepped in front of him—the embodiment of something pure and fierce she'd only ever shown him glimpses of before. Gasping in the sudden spread of a helpless affection throughout his body, he pushed himself off the wall. The need to touch what she'd become was overwhelming, and he reached out to place one of his hands on her arm.
The flames expired, the barrier broke, Jack collapsed against him without any warning, and Dean's mind switched into survival mode to keep him from losing it right there and then. He picked up Jack and held his slumped form upright with one arm, then grabbed Sam's shoulder with his free hand. The opened rift at his back was like a warm breeze running over his skin.
"Jack, I'll get the fire going. Can you check if there's any salt in the kitchen and lay down a line at the door and windows?"
. But we know he destroyed all the other universes after getting his stupid showdown at noon there, so..."
Who happened to be Jack's father, which Crowley couldn't so much as consider without a shudder of utter contempt.
"Feel the molecules the water consists of, the small parts that make up the whole. Feel them around you. Feel them inside of you."
Dean wasn't sure what Sam had seen on his face, but his brother shied away the slightest bit, taken aback by whatever he had found.
, but Dean didn't even wait for it to fully arrive at its destination before following up with another question, growing urgency in his voice. "Are we on a ley line right here?"
The others seemed to share the sentiment, throwing a last glance back to the living room that had kept them warm through the night. By now, the fire had burnt out and the room was shrouded in shade by the sparse light that fell in through the shutters. Then Dean opened the front door and they were greeted by an icy breeze. Sam pulled his jacket's zip a little higher and followed Dean out into the cold. Jack closed the door behind them.
The smoke floated over to Jack, engulfing him. The pain he expected failed to appear. Where the smoke touched him, Jack's skin and even his clothing and backpack became transparent until all he could see when he glanced down was the ground beneath him. Before a clear thought could form in his head, sounds tore through the veil of silence and the squirrel changed its course once more, darting away from him.
"If there's anything I've learned," he murmured against the top of her head. "It's that evil and good are an illusion. You're no more evil than I am. I was prophesied to lead Hell's armies and bring nothing but destruction. I've seen no less than three supposed Antichrists—one of those
A jolt went through his true form when he let himself believe that this Dean had heard his thoughts, had replied to them as naturally as the other Dean had when they'd shared not only a body, but a connection that went beyond the physical. He was mistaken, of course, because this reply hadn't been directed at him.
Dean's frown deepened and he tilted his head in obvious confusion. His hand emerged from his jacket holding a dagger, but he let it sink to his side uselessly. "I—you—
Castiel permitted the flow of his true form into a condensed pillar of light, rising high up into the sky. And then he was pulled into this human body made of flesh and bone, too narrow in its confinement and yet a perfect fit. He held out a hand far enough to feel the rain against their skin, wondering where in this downpour to begin looking for the other Dean.
For good measure, he released another scream and looked down at his chest where his clothing had been ripped in multiple places. Widening one of the rips to reveal the unblemished skin around his tattoo was easy enough. The icy wind was a caress, a balm drifting over the red scratches all over his chest. His fingers closed around the angel blade he was carrying.
Dean threw a fleeting dark look his brother's way before sliding the car around so that he could continue in forward gear. The crack of thunder behind them was
The silence that followed was fraught with things neither of them wanted to shape into words. It became stifling in a way that made him desperate for something, anything, to break it, but his mind suddenly consisted of molasses that nipped every attempt to do so in the bud. It was Dean who finally dispersed it, opting not to comment on what he had seen.
The demon narrowed Dean's eyes, but whatever he'd seen on Jack's face must have had an effect, because Roderick's expression morphed into something that was more open. One corner of his mouth twitched and he gave Jack a short, wordless nod a moment later. Now if only Jack could get rid of his own doubts this easily.
"That... would be a rather extreme way of doing it." She smiled. "There's no telling of the possible consequences. It would be risky, foolhardy even. Only a truly desperate person would attempt such a thing." Her smile widened.
it, could see that the spark had sprung over into Sam's eyes. And Jack—Jack was giving him that look of blind trust that shouldn't even be there anymore, that should have been wiped away in a wave of fury, but survived by sheer stubbornness. Like them. Madness, it must have been madness that made the corners of Dean's mouth twitch in something resembling a smile when all three of them should be beaten down beyond recovery. "And his writing
Entirely focused on the chance that Dean's sleep posed, Castiel was caught by surprise when Sam suddenly sat up in the other bed. The stealthiness of his movements was unexpected and Castiel wondered briefly if there was reason for worry as Sam sneaked over to Dean's bed and slid his hand into the pocket of Dean's jacket. With reflexes that only a life full of danger could bring, Dean caught Sam's wrist.
The questions sent a shiver of recognition through Castiel's body and he had to close his eyes for a moment to quiet the loudness of his emotions.
Something ran over the back of Sam's hand and his lower arm at these words, not quite a touch, more like the shadow of one. It made the small hairs on his skin stand up, but he couldn't find it in him to be creeped out, far too relieved about the knowledge that Rowena wasn't currently being tortured in Hell. Thinking about her was complicated, had been so for a while. He still remembered the gut punch feeling of her death all too well, had never truly been able to shake it off despite her assurances that death had been the best thing to ever happen to her.
No, that would have been hopeless, doomed even before the words could have left the lips of her vessel that was now lost. Just as Castiel himself was. They'd all been able to feel it, when another of their dwindling numbers was torn away forever. It shouldn't have ended like this.
Jack was racing back through the field the way he had come, towards the spot where he had last seen Sam. He stopped, turned around in a full circle. There was no sign of life, not in the field, not anywhere else.
impressed. Much too late now for an actually decent finale, of course. But eh, I'll take what I can get."
There, the angel had done it again. Dean hadn't seen that answer coming, self-deprecating in its honesty, and even—sarcastic? Could angels
tangible and so hard to come by that some might call it a myth, something that only happened in the fairy tales of old. It was something that no amount of power could ever ensure, not truly. It was something no riches could buy. And she'd been offered it freely, by a man who was smart enough to know better. He hadn't been supposed to
the ones he held so dear. They knew next to nothing about each other, but any version of Dean was worth saving. That name was the only thought in his mind as he phased his celestial body from the Veil into the physical realm, spreading his wings far enough to cover the entire parking lot.
The same almost-touch he had sensed during breakfast ran over his fingers and the pen shook in his grip, only to get flung aside a moment after.
Jack prayed, one last thing he wanted to say before it was all over, one more person he had to make amends to.
A palm returned to his face, followed by a second one, framing his head on both sides. Some fierce blinking enabled him to finally discern the features above him. Even though he'd known who he would see, the pained look in her eyes took him by surprise, right before his vision swam again. Whatever had been torn loose inside of him, he couldn't wrestle it back down, felt like it held his throat and chest in a steel clutch.
"Rowena?" he asked, raising his hands helplessly. "I'm not... sure what you're trying to say." At that, a pebble flew high enough to hit him straight against the forehead. Sam blinked. There wasn't enough force behind it to actually hurt and his skin felt unharmed, but the way Dean was now snorting next to him was enough to make Sam huff out an annoyed breath. "Seriously?" he asked both the open air and his brother.
Sam hesitated, pushed his hair out of his face and huffed out a short laugh that didn't sound happy at all. "Dean, I have no idea what I'm doing."
"He saved me," he said quietly, staring down at the floor. It was as if someone else was speaking, not him. "Billie was coming after us, so he summoned the Empty. To save me. It took her... and it took him." His eyes were helplessly drawn back to the spot on the wall where the blackness had appeared. "He's gone."
As Rowena concentrated on the fading devil's trap, Jack gave up on standing without support and leaned his full weight back against the table, squinting against the pain, wishing he hadn't tossed the chair aside earlier. The spell brought no visible change, the flames still declining steadily. "It's not working, it's the wrong domain! Hell's energy never strengthens. And this spell was never meant to withstand interference like this!"
"Cas, what is this? Why is this impression of a mammal listening in on us? How are you wearing the Michael Sword, in here?"
Dean sighed and swallowed, keeping his eyes on the road. He didn't want to admit it, but he knew Castiel was right. Dean's grip on the steering wheel tightened. He formed and discarded multiple sentences in his head, unable to choose how to even begin explaining all of this to Sam, especially now that he'd already lied.
She seemed slightly taken aback at that request. "You must be joking, Sam. If you truly want your initiation into life magic of the highest tier
Sam's eyes rolled back in his head and Dean, still kneeling near Jack, did his best to stop the fall as his brother's body went limp.
Fallen twigs crunched under his feet as he ran through the forest in no particular direction other than away. Away from that place that had brought him so much pain on three separate occasions in such quick succession that he'd barely had enough time to process even one of them.
"JACK!" he yelled, his voice trembling in the awareness that he might be too late to stop Jack. Whatever his son was planning, it hadn't sounded good.
"You believe in prophecy, but I don't," he told her, and waited for the second demon to step out into the corridor to arrest him. Sam's muscles tensed in preparation for what he was about to do. "I believe in choice." Her eyes widened, came back alive.
The gray day had more in common with the last remnants of light before nightfall than with early afternoon, so Sam did a double-take at his wristwatch. A shudder ran through him at the realization that it really wasn't his watch that was malfunctioning, but the sky.
"I see," Jack said distractedly, his gaze focused on the sky where he could watch the distance to the light cone shrink with every step he took. He felt nervous over meeting face-to-face with this stranger, despite—or maybe because of—that feeling of familiarity he couldn't place at all. Logically it made no sense, was dangerous even. He had to remember that.
Castiel brought the car to an abrupt stop, opened the seatbelt with shaking fingers and pushed the car door open roughly. With little regard to anything other than the pull of the direction the prayer had come from, he ran, leaving the road behind and crossing the line of trees that marked the border of the forest.
"Is this my grandfather?" Jack asked in dawning horror. God had already taken everything he possibly could from their family. If he was here now, it would be with a finality that had Jack tightening his grip on Dean's arm.
with this third life of his, after he'd found his ultimate goal just as stale as the rest of it all?
Castiel was utterly mystified by this absurd string of words, and how to react to it, when a flimsy rill of warmth crept from Dean towards him, nudged him in a way that was unsure, hesitant. When he welcomed it, they both breathed freely again, inhaled in unison with a weight lifted from their chest that he hadn't been aware of. His thoughts cleared.
Dean didn't comment on this latest addition, but without any walls to hide anything, the resentment that name procured in him was out in the open. However, it was nothing in comparison to his reaction to the very last name that Castiel called out.
Each shuddering breath a tremendous effort, he cleared a small area of ground behind the tree, pushed the leaves aside with movements wild enough to be a minor outlet for all the pent-up emotions he had no idea what to do with. He had been sorely mistaken in thinking everything he had gone through in the three years of his life would have taught him how to deal.
"Yeah, uh, thanks for that," Dean said, stowing the Anti-Vampire Device in his jacket. He winced when the movement pulled at the broken skin of the joint between his shoulder and neck.
The thought that the Winchesters weren't with him now, that they might not ever be together like that again, sent an icy shiver over his skin. He didn't even have a lighter. All he could find in his pack was a small box with roughened sides and the depiction of a flame at the top.
Dean seemed just as stunned as Castiel by those words that had formed in their mind, sticking out like a flower on scorched soil. They stood in silence, breathing heavily. One of them swallowed, Castiel didn't know who. Then he received a shove, his grace once more cut off from Dean's soul, effectively stopping the feedback loop.
Jack frowned, trying to make out in vain who the speaker was. He couldn't actually see anything, but he could sense the aura of power emanating from the hallway. Not the strongest he had ever felt, especially not given recent encounters with his blood relatives, but tangible nonetheless.
"I was... slowly dying after Lucifer cut out my grace." That caused something dark to flash over Roderick's face and the demon's posture changed until he was propped up halfway over the table. A muscle in his jaw twitched. "And then the Empty invaded Heaven to claim me, but Cas took my place instead."
The last thing he was expecting was the genuine smile that was slowly spreading over the witch's face.
If the human concept of karma was something she believed in, she'd call it karmic that she had to go through everything she had done to others. She'd sent so many angels to these cells, she'd erased so many rebellious thoughts. Now the holes in her own memory left behind by a drill were still bothering her with questions she'd probably never get answers for, and being locked in here was doing its fair share in tearing apart what little sanity she had managed to preserve over the millennia. And maybe that was the core of the issue. Maybe all of them had just lived too damned long to still be sane.
Despite everything, he couldn't find it in him to regret his decision. He deemed himself a decent enough judge of character. If he hadn't been convinced of the angel's complete honesty, the unbridled
A single TV screen was hissing at the entrance to one of the shops, showing nothing but static. Jack didn't say anything and crouched down at the sidewalk to examine two bags that had fallen, leaving their contents in a haphazard display all over the concrete. He picked up a colorful pinwheel and spun it idly between his fingers. Dean stepped closer with a frown, but froze the moment his eyes fell onto a poster in the window behind Jack, advertising
He stepped into the box and a cloud of light rose all around him. It was silvery-white, like the moon had always been before the night had grown so much darker than it should be. Jack suspected his grandaunt had something to do with that. Then the light swallowed him whole.
So far I have seven chapters in total, more or less finished. If all goes well, I'll post one new chapter per day for the next four days. Any additional chapters after that have to be written first.
Rubbing a hand down his face, Dean sighed. Of all the things Castiel had observed so far, this was the moment that made him
Sam frowned at that, actually seeming to consider the thought like the nerd that he was before asking, "How did Crowley ever do it?"
"Once my soul crossed the threshold to Hell after being separated from my body, it abandoned any ties to Earth it still had. The portal magic is built upon those ties, woven around them. The only way out of Hell for an unbound soul is through an open Hellgate."
"I wish I could. I was as careful as possible given the circumstances, but I had never done this before! I always much preferred the thought of staying in my own shape."
Suddenly, the rain became uncomfortable to the point of hurt. He frowned, noticing how what fell from the sky was now much harder than raindrops were supposed to be. Hail. He'd never been outside in a hailstorm before, had barely ever noticed it in the safety of the bunker. The thought of home was an ache that matched the way the tiny chunks of ice met his skin.
"Ah, you know, I was just minding my own business when I came across abandoned luggage. First come, first served, finders keepers and all that. Et voilà, inside of that bag was this brilliant device that tends to come in pairs of two."
Nobody said anything after that for several long seconds. Jack grabbed one of Sam's sleeves in a show of support, felt the muscles in Sam's arm tense under his grip, and saw Sam's chest rise in a deep inhale before his voice cut through the silence that had fallen over them.
A rock came flying out of the oily scar in the air above the chasm and landed directly in front of Chuck's feet. Chuck frowned and picked it up.
"So, why was he alone? This can't be good," he said with a frown at the door. The universe must have agreed with him, because that was when Hell's alarm sounded, a deep, pervasive roar akin to a massive warhorn.
"I bet you never thought you'd say that to anyone." She smiled and breathed out warmly against his skin. "Sam, I didn't tell you this to make you feel guilty. I told you because I wanted you to see the power you hold, even now."
Sam soldiered on, his voice growing thinner with every word. Then he must have seen it as the exercise in futility that it was, and stopped. The disembodied demons were entirely unaffected anyway, not slowing down their pursuit in the slightest. While Sam had been the faster one of them before, merely dragging Jack in his weakened state along, Jack now found himself outrunning Sam by far. He fully intended to repay the favor, to be the driving force that could pull both of them, but Sam suddenly let go of his arm.
Seeing the trapped demons rampage against their confines without so much as a single noise was a strange experience in Jack's already hazy state. He had a second of advance warning, the hairs on his skin standing up, before a blast of pure rage shook the ground another time, originating from the hallway. The fiery lines of the devil's trap flickered, but remained intact. For now.
Sam discovered a working set of walkie-talkies and offered one of the two devices to his brother with a shrug. "Not as good as working phones, but better than nothing, right?"
Blunt and loud and oblivious, the demons passed her hiding place and she waited for what would have been several heartbeats if she actually still had a heart or a body. Those projections of bodies they all wore here were another thing that intrigued her about Hell, and perhaps one she was in a unique position to explore in depth. She slipped out of the shadows and backtracked the way the demons had come from, through a corridor in the quivering light of torches, lined by old-fashioned wooden doors on both sides.
Speaking of crazy, a few months ago, around the time I was writing chapter 10, I randomly discovered something on the internet that made my skin crawl, but that I hadn't shared with a lot of people so far for fear of how crazy it would make me sound--but we're beyond that now, I guess:
back into life, engulfing the whole group as one. Jack exchanged a glance with Dean, both of them standing to either side of Sam and decidedly leaving their hands on Sam's jacket. Following an intuition, Jack whispered the spell together with Sam the next time, his eyes still on Dean.
in Hell he'd watch her sacrifice herself another time. He tried to pull her back, but she resisted, so he did the only thing he could and positioned himself at her side, encouraged by how
"Eh, there's no reason to worry about Dean. All we need is a little healing and he'll be fine. Winchesters are like weeds. Can't get rid of them, no matter how hard you try."
Castiel supposed being seen as an ally of whatever kind was a step up. However, all of this was still going much too slowly. He didn't even want to imagine what his father was doing to Dean in this exact moment. It became increasingly hard for him to stay calm, to stop what remained of his grace from flaring in an uncontrollable burst.
my name, merely an older one. Friends call me Crowley. Enemies, too. Sometimes those lines are blurry."
"Rowena." Sam touched her arm with one hand, wincing slightly at the pain the movement caused at his wounds now that the adrenaline of their escape was ebbing away. "It's all right. All of this, it was a long time ago. You've changed. I've changed. It's not like—I mean, it's not like any of this stuff still
Castiel touched two of his fingers to Dean's neck and a glow far gentler than during the smiting emerged from his palm. Bloodstains disappeared and skin mended under his cautious attention. The action stirred awake so many memories that Castiel felt his throat constrict in worry over the Dean who
Stuffing everything into the backpacks posed a bit of a challenge, especially with the blankets, but they managed a more or less equal split of their supplies. While they got dressed in their newly acquired warm outdoor clothing in the hallway, Sam became aware of a certain tension he felt, a sense of finality in leaving this peaceful farm house behind as a last waystop before a trip into the unknown.
"That sounds useful," Castiel stated carefully, not quite sure how to proceed from here. No matter how often he'd been convinced to have finally mastered human interactions, he still received
"Seems we got some time on our hands," Roderick stated with a nod towards the noisy impacts of hail on the roof. He turned off the flashlight and leaned back in his chair, folding his hands loosely in his lap. "So, what's your deal, cub?"
If he was too human for that now, maybe he could meet his mother in Heaven again. Perhaps Sam and Dean's souls had somehow found their way there, too.
The smile had found its way back to their face and their heartbeat had accelerated again in their shared excitement, but this time Castiel didn't attempt to calm it. He didn't waste any more time and let their mind slip into the telepathic web that Dean had so aptly dubbed angel radio, sending out a universal call to all of his siblings. When he was greeted by nothing but silence, he tried not to let too much of his disappointment seep through to Dean.
Holding his brother's gaze, he shoved the rest of the cereal from his hand into his mouth, crunching between his teeth, then washed it all down with the glass of milk. Dean's eyes crinkled.
"Don't make me regret this," he finally spoke into the cold and Castiel could have wept, if he had a body to do so.
"Why is it that I always end up with the mad ones?" she asked, but it was with that twitch of her mouth that indicated she was joking. Her eyes sent warmth his way.
for reading the first half of this in advance to let me know if the characters sound right (and for other helpful suggestions).
. The next few icy projectiles from the sky resulted in a miserable creaking from the windshield. It wouldn't last much longer. "Jackets!" Dean yelled and opened his seatbelt. He awkwardly disentangled his arms from his sleeves in the narrow space of his seat to pull his jacket halfway over his head from behind.
A laugh bubbled out of Jack's throat, completely at odds with his inner turmoil. Roderick didn't try to hide his half-smile this time.
that small rest of grace inside of him. It was uncurling, reaching, searching. The knowledge alone that he was walking directly along the border to the realm that held Castiel prisoner sufficed to set his whole being on fire, his own grace yearning for that familiar touch of Castiel's grace, with all its warmth and safety. Home.
Sam felt his heart sink. He knew, beyond all doubt, that this was the exact moment that was kicking loose the first small rocks of a landslide he'd be utterly powerless to stop.
Dean turned around instantly, and his face mirrored the untroubled smile Jack was wearing. That threw Sam more off balance than even the Enochian had. The last coherent memory he had was of being besieged in Hell by a horde of demons, after having lost almost everyone they had ever cared about. Nothing was making any
. By the time he realized he had sent that word, it was too late already. The colors pulsated, the white glow in their center fluctuating in intensity.
"I mean, it's hard to tell for sure," Sam said with a helpless lift of his shoulders. "But after the... I tried to call every single contact in my phone and it went straight to voicemail every time."
"It wasn't... it wasn't stupid," Jack said, hating the way his voice sounded, all choked-up and rough. "He did it to save me." Jack swallowed down the lump in his throat, but somehow that made his eyes spill over. Hastily wiping his sleeve over his face, Jack took a deep breath and finally dared to meet Roderick's eyes again. The demon sat there in silence with an unreadable look on his face, no longer leaning back. Nobody said anything until Jack found his voice again.
"Lock the door and close the window shutters while you're at it," Dean called after him without waiting for a reply. There was a box of long matches on the sill of the fireplace and a neat pile of wood next to it. He threw in some logs and kindling, and found a stack of old newspapers nearby in the dim light of the lantern. The lurid, huge print of hateful political headlines on the front page made him huff, wondering if it would have changed a thing for those people had they known they'd all be gone by now.
"Gosh darnit," Dean muttered into the darkness and sat up straight in his bed. He lingered there motionlessly and every moment that passed was unbearable torment to Castiel.
Jack had never mentioned this before. Sam was unsure about the implications, but he could basically feel the sudden tension radiating off of Dean as he asked, "Loud how?"
He shoved the box open with a jolt of his finger and Jack wished he had thought to try that. The demon took out a stick, flicked it over the side of the box and then lifted the small flame in an exaggerated arc. "Ta-da, there's your re-enactment of humanity's first grand discovery."
A guttural scream cut through the silence, loud enough to be heard even through the closed door. And there
She never got to hear whatever his reply may have been, because that was the moment a blood-curdling, high-pitched screech rose somewhere outside the cave, drowning out the thunder. She hastily pushed herself away from Sam and to her feet, reaching for the only weapon she had left now that her magic had ceased—the angel blade that had come to her in their time of need. It was questionable how much use it would be, but it was possible that a weapon of divinity was exactly what was needed.
Just thinking about that day was hard for Jack, seemed to encumber him with an impossible weight on his shoulders.
Rowena suddenly seemed very interested in the carpet beneath the table. Despite having spent time with the witch on multiple occasions before, Jack had rarely met a person who confused him more.
Holy fucking shit, what was he even doing here? What was this? Angels weren't like... this wasn't... this wasn't real.
After a quick exchange of glances to ensure Rowena had seen him, he entered the room. She slipped in only seconds later and quietly closed the door behind them. With their backs pressed against the wood planks the door consisted of, both of them inhaled deeply, trying to catch their breath.
mean that. Before you made the walkie-talkie ring, I was all alone. God, he didn't just make all squirrels disappear. It's all animals. All—" Jack swallowed. "All humans. Even creatures like werewolves."
"I was turned into a bomb strong enough to take out my grandfather and my grandaunt, but I didn't—" He trailed off.
Dean relaxed. "Dude. I didn't know you'd freak out like this or I would've—Just, okay. We all made it out of Hell, but you and Jack passed out on me for a while. Rowena told me you'd wake up on your own, but she had to leave because you had ectoplasm all over your face. You're welcome for getting rid of that and for carrying your heavy ass all the way over here, by the way."
Dean turned around and Castiel's heartbeat, entirely unaffected by the sprint, sped up. He noticed the off-kilter way Dean held his head, the limp in his leg and the wrong angle of his arm. His grace reached out, tingled in the tips of their fingers to heal, to mend, to
Jack looked down to the backpack at his feet. After only a moment of rummaging, he found the first-aid kit from the barn. This pack was Dean's then. He swallowed before pressing the 'TALK' button.
Dean openly shared his perspective of Lucifer stabbing Castiel through the heart, and they almost sank to their knees under the weight of it. Castiel caught their balance and gasped at the intensity of the vision.
Dean wasn't sure he'd ever get used to the way this arrangement worked, feeling the angel's worry as if it was his own until Castiel must have put a stop to it, hidden it somehow.
He was severely weakened, but he found comfort in the thoughts so close to him that they were almost indistinguishable from his own. His presence was a muddled chaos, still half lost in the depths of despair that had claimed him for an unknowable amount of time. It was hard to leave behind the dark emotions that had chained him to this place, especially knowing that every single image he had seen wasn't just a nightmarish phantom summoned to torment him. They were all memories, sad fragments of truth, each vision depicting an injustice he had actually committed, real persons he had wronged.
"And round and round it goes," Roderick sighed. "Jack, let me tell you, from someone who knows firsthand, that Winchester-patented road of self-sacrifice doesn't lead anywhere good. You
The moment Chuck reached his hiding spot, Jack thought this was how it would end. No saving the world. No last hope.
know he's still in here? Not truly what anyone would call alive, mind you, but not quite dead either. I'm what's holding him together right now, and I have every intention to keep it that way until he no longer needs me to. I tend to pay my debts."
The prospect of forever seemed impossible to endure. He longed to forget. To merge with the blackness. To stop being.
Unable to focus on the treeline coming ever closer in front of him, Jack looked back towards Sam another time, saw the hunter stop and turn to face the approaching demons head-on.
Dexterous beyond what his human side could do alone, he sneaked outside, gently pulling the door closed behind himself to keep the cold out of the cabin. Then he ran. It felt good to release that pent-up energy, heeding the call to action by dashing through the nightly forest. With the cold air in his lungs and the dried leaves rustling under his shoes, drops of rain falling into his face, he no longer felt lost. He felt
Dean turned to look at his brother who was sitting upright on his bed. Before, the motel room had been too dark to see much. Now, however, he could make out every detail of the way Sam's eyebrows lifted, the two deep wrinkles the movement left on his forehead.
not by any definition that followed common logic. Certainly, she could still feel pain in a realm that was constructed around the sensation, meant to accommodate it in all shapes and varieties, even reinforcing it in comparison to the way it felt on Earth. But the pain on her cheek had barely even registered, a mere background noise to concerns far more pressing. She'd endured so much worse in the past. Healing her hadn't been
And then his mind received an image, an impression of colors in stark contrast to the smothering darkness. A deep azure blue with streaks of white and black and gold running through it, with an ethereal, white glow radiating from its core. The sight was breath-taking in a way that wiped him clear of any thought. A glimpse of three pairs of wings flashed through his head, all lightning and shadow, an afterimage indented into his mind.
"Dude," Dean said, not even trying to hide his amusement while sidestepping a pebble that was now aimed his way.
Sam caught up with them and came to a stop in a whirl of dried leaves at their side, casting a small cone of light onto the ground with a flashlight he held in his hand. Castiel turned to give the other hunter a desperate look.
Instead of completing any of these sentences, Dean also set down his pack and looked around hastily, returning with a long stick held in his hand. Sam and Jack watched in silence as Dean started writing into the dirt with the end of the stick, and it took only the letters
In his true form, Castiel loomed far higher than anything else nearby, but he'd been centering his entire concentration on the car's occupants until the moment something crashed against the roof. Again. And again. Both brothers gasped in surprise, but Dean didn't slow down in their race down the road. Castiel broadened his focus beyond the vehicle's metal shell and saw that chunks of solid ice were raining down from the tenebrous threat of the sky.
Spots of black appeared in Jack's vision and he desperately sucked in air, trying to make sense of the voices around him.
With the torturer's attention fully on himself, Sam evaded backwards, away from Rowena and further into the room. His arm smarted and he felt a fresh well of blood run over it from the strain he had put on the wound. It coated his hand and made his grip on his pathetic candle holder slippery.
"The lack of books is appalling," he agreed in the same quiet manner, latching onto the distraction from his own thoughts. The shadow of a smile ghosted over the witch's face at the joke. It was dispelled as quickly as it had appeared when heavy steps sounded in the hallway outside, followed by the rattling of doorknobs. The look they exchanged in reaction to that sound had shed any trace of levity.
know. But of course the message hadn't been directed at him, and Sam apparently didn't share his confusion. "But I think I may be sleep-deprived. We're not going back out there in this weather anyway, so we might as well get some rest while we're here."
"Samuel fell unconscious the moment I possessed him." Sam lifted his hands quickly. "Don't worry, it's only temporary. He will recover on his own."
Suddenly the open landscape with its lack of direction felt just as suffocating as the barn had. He breathed in to speak, but before he could voice his doubts to Dean, he felt something small hit his leg and looked down with a frown, just in time to watch another pebble from the driveway fly towards his shin, seemingly on its own accord.
The demon didn't reply in words, but the part of his essence closest to Castiel's withdrew the slightest bit, leaving just enough room for his grace to wiggle through and reach Dean's soul in the mere shadow of a touch.
An angel in a vessel with long, red hair, backlit by a blinding light as she saved him in combat. A churning sensation in his chest he'd never experienced before when he watched her kiss Dean. The debilitating guilt that hurt too much to even look at her as she got arrested by two angels. This name took Dean slightly longer to call, though it certainly couldn't be for lack of recognition.
This conversation had no words, but still contained the world between the three of them. Sam's frown eased, eyebrows lifting, his head tilting in a barely-there motion. The corners of Jack's mouth twitched. Dean cleared his throat, guiding Jack towards Rowena's and Sam's table with a gentle touch.
"Right," he said, looking straight at her in a way that made her think her thoughts weren't soundproof in the slightest. "I'm sure it is."
The sight of panic slowly growing on the hunter's face should have worried Jack more than it did. But somehow he felt detached from everything but the searing pain under his fingers.
Sam knelt in pretense surrender. His eyes met Rowena's and found no hope in them, no trace of her regular self-assurance.
him like this, not the way he had been in the dungeon with traces of dried tears all over his face, holding him and Jack like the world depended on it. Not the way he suddenly was with Jack in general. He could have considered a Shapeshifter, or some sort of divine trick, but deep down he felt this was truly
"I'm not—" Dean's words were cut off as a flash of lightning put his face into sharp relief. His eyes narrowed in the direction it had come from and Castiel noticed minuscule movements in Dean's jaw muscles, indicating that he was counting. The thunderclap was to be expected, but when it happened after just a few seconds, it was so permeant that it made the hunter flinch. Even Castiel in his true form was surprised by the intensity of the noise.
He suddenly became aware of Rowena's chanting behind them and dared to turn around for a second to see symbols glowing on her outstretched palms that hadn't been there before, the orange light beneath barely restrained by her skin, urging to break free. Her voice grew from a quietly muttered verse on repetition into a burst of a crescendo that illuminated the room in an eruption of light.
she said with an unhinged smile. "I do because nobody has ever done that before. I do because it meant you actually
"And to think that I'd actually started to enjoy your company! I'll tell you a secret, cub. I would have
Dean shrugged, still standing on the sill of the opened door and plastering a smile on his face. "What can I say? End of the world, and all that."
"If I didn't know any better, I'd think Feathers actually had some fun for once in his life. But I do, in fact, know better."
"Who would have thought that the only two people to escape a collapsing universe might defy statistics, huh?" Dean asked, sitting down on the room's second bed with a small huff. "Listen, it's hard to judge with the, uh, you know." Dean made a swirling motion through the air with one hand, as if that explained anything at all when Castiel, in fact, did
screwed up. "You won't," Jack blurted out in full conviction before he even knew what he was saying, frowned and then covered his own nerves with a thin smile as Sam's gaze snapped over to him. Something in Sam's eyes softened.
These words darkened the sky. The low rumble of thunder was everywhere. Clouds coalesced into an even thicker veil until a single strike of lightning descended from the darkness at their core, setting a tree on fire in some distance.
help? There was nobody left but demons, angels, and Winchesters, who were apparently out of commission. Where would someone like Jack turn to for help? With the Earth as barren as a wasteland, that left only two possibilities—Heaven or Hell. Bloody brilliant. That meant facing either a God who seemed to have developed a hate for all things living or...
After following the ley line's pull for a while, he knew he had reached its epicenter when the energy whirring around him seemed to amplify everything he was feeling close to the point of bursting. He didn't have to look down to verify that this was the right spot, field plants flattened in a bigger circle where bodies had been laying on the ground last night.
information. The chewing gum was orange-flavored, the toy figure stemmed from the cereal box in the bunker's kitchen, and the writing on the paper was Sam's notes on the portal spell he had used to bring them back. Dean rubbed his hands through the wetness on his face with an exhale akin to bitter laughter at how useless all of it was.
Without spending much thought on the matter, Sam continued onwards, but was brought to an abrupt stop when the slippery ground proved to be incompatible with Rowena's high heels. Despite everything he'd been through in the last few hours, or maybe because of it, his heightened instincts as a hunter kicked in. He managed to hold out an arm in time to stabilize her, but that didn't prevent her huff of annoyance.
Roderick exhaled audibly. "I was afraid you'd say that. Wish that it could have been an attempt at percussion music instead."
He couldn't bear to hear the sound Jack made, couldn't meet Sam's gaze. Nothing was right, nothing was like it should be. He was hollow, empty.
It was true in every sense. They were really all that was left now, in an era that seemed to be placed beyond time, after the world had already ended. Just two people, stripped of all the things they had ever cared about, rediscovering what they were made of when everything else was gone.
"He will do even worse things to us if we let the Vessel escape," one of the demons said, the one who hadn't been torturing him before, and hesitated. Two pairs of eyes flashed black. The touch of a hand against his arm was the unspoken signal Sam had been waiting for. He threw the entire side table at their enemies and a variety of metal instruments clattered to the ground, a cacophony in the blanket of threatening silence that had fallen over the room.
If only the Empty hadn't consumed as much of Castiel's power, he might have been able to hold an actual conversation with Dean via song lyrics. But as it was, the focused effort for just those two words had already weakened him considerably. He was in urgent need of a vessel to strengthen him, to give his essence a chance to regenerate, if he wanted to remain on Earth. And he had to. The other Dean needed him to.
that was, unsure if he was in the condition to handle any more bad news right now. The walls of the passage dropped away, a sign that they were truly leaving behind the structured part of Hell. A vista of rock plains unfolded in front of them, shrouded in darkness save for the occasional lightning strikes. No more torches to light their way.
Trying to sort his thoughts was much harder now that there weren't any enemies to fight. They couldn't stay here, the cold would get to them sooner rather than later. This place left them entirely open and defenseless. And most importantly, Jack needed help, fast. He shook Sam by his shoulders, but was met with the same impenetrable silence as before. Taking stock of his options, he reached for the pocket of his jacket, but then remembered that the jacket was now wrapped around Jack, the weak protection it offered more symbolic than it was of actual use. Moving carefully, he put Sam down near the kid.
, cub!" he whispered, more quietly than the last time he'd said these words, yet more intense, reinforced by something deep and ancient that he thought had withered and died a long time ago. His fingers closed around the thin paper, cradling it like it was something precious. And then he burst out of the door, hiding the note in the inner pocket of his jacket to keep it safe from the rain.
The cutting sound of hail hammering against the roof had stopped, replaced by the much gentler pattering of rain. Jack was laying on something soft under his back, nothing at all like the chairs they'd been sitting on last he remembered. Something even softer was covering him, and as he let the tips of his fingers glide over it, he realized it was the blanket from the bottom of his backpack.
The irony in it all was not lost on her. The way she'd thought of her son as weak for holding up his loyalty like a flag of defiance to her, to Hell, to everyone. And here she was, following directly in his path. And for what? For some sort of cosmic joke meant to show her there was
Dean reached out again and just barely got hold of a part of Sam's jacket, his movements impeded by Jack's weight in his other arm. Sam's outstretched fingers grazed Rowena's hand the moment the first demons arrived at her position.
Another smile crossed over the witch's face, but Jack seemed entirely unaffected by it, the urgency in his voice only hinting at the feelings Sam knew the boy must be hiding underneath.
Jack's heart hammered as he pressed the big, round button labeled 'TALK' in the middle of the device. His throat closed up and he couldn't force out a single word. Completely helpless, he stared at a display with numbers that had no meaning to him. The tears he'd been unable to cry before chose this moment of all times to emerge, so he ended up transmitting nothing but a sob before he let go of the button. All Jack heard in the quiet of the forest was his own labored breathing and the wilted leaves dancing around his feet in a breeze. And then a voice sounded out of the speaker.
The light buried itself deep into his chest and he heard screaming, probably his own. He was strongly reminded of his time in hell, of a red-hot poker digging into his skin, but he tried to cling to the thought that this would save Jack. Clenching his jaw, he brought his body back under control just enough to reach out and touch Jack's chest with one hand.
"You remind me of someone, an old... frenemy of mine. Wonder what happened to him. However, we were speaking of fathers. Where's yours?"
Yet, nothing had been even remotely like this. The brick wall behind him and the concrete floor beneath him were sending a chill through his clothes, but the brunt of the cold seemed to come from within him. Loss had left a tear inside his chest he didn't know how to deal with, stinging, twisting. Making it hard to think, to breathe. Making him forget what warmth even felt like.
Dean began to move over to the next car in the lot and Castiel sped up their steps until they were running again.
Castiel realized Dean had been uncharacteristically quiet during this whole exchange, but now he was there, a familiar touch to his grace.
right now, without letting it last another second. He raised Sam's blade and aimed it straight at Dean's throat with a quick thrust forward. The resounding chink of metal against metal wasn't something he'd been prepared for. Roderick deflected his blow with a sidewards sweep of Dean's blade, taken out of Dean's jacket pocket in one fluent move.
Jack chewed on the inside of his lip, staring at the way the candlelight reflected in the remaining liquid in Roderick's glass. The tempest outside rose to new heights and the deafening crack of lightning striking something nearby made Jack wince. He hugged himself protectively, rubbing over his upper arms. His eyes moved back to the demon's, looking so much like Dean's but at the same time nothing like his at all.
The other two must have heard his gasp and followed his gaze because they all started talking at once.
Raindrops began to fall, the soft whispers of their impact reflected from the wilted leaves all around them. Jack took a deep breath to calm his nerves, trying to return into that state of heightened senses that most reliably seemed to work in extreme situations. Feeling utterly useless was, apparently, not extreme enough to qualify.
, his mind supplied, a desperately fond memory. His eyes fell on the empty fourth chair. Cas should be here with them. The one angel whose mannerisms were nothing if not endearing—not at all what Sam had ever pictured an angel to be like—but whose ideals actually came pretty damn close to what Sam had always imagined.
right as the ground crumbled away beneath his feet. Thick lumps of soil and uprooted plants plunged into the abyss below.
It may have been the fact that he just couldn't get himself to pierce Dean's throat, even in death. Or the way Roderick was now looking at him with eyes that were green again—calculating, yes, but also surprised in a way that only earth-shattering revelations caused. Several seconds ticked by where neither of them moved, both of them just staring at each other.
This time, Jack wouldn't be caught off guard. Falling still and even going so far as to hold his breath, he concentrated on his surroundings. The rustling of leaves suddenly seemed much louder than before and he was pretty sure he'd again tapped into what remained of his angelic side. The resounding bang of the second shot rippled through the forest and he gained a rather exact sense of direction and distance from it.
It was disorienting, being unable to see his own body as he made his way through the underbrush. Even if his arms had been visible though, he simply didn't care enough to protect himself from the branches that snapped back at him and bit into his face. The contact of old tears with bloody scratches burned on his skin.
"Not the trusting kind, are we now, Jack? Ov — ah, bugger this. I know when my efforts are wasted. You've never used a walkie-talkie before in your life, have you?"
"Dean!" Jack called out and Dean ducked down, evading a blow that hit a bookshelf instead of his head. The whole thing came crashing down, burying the hunter beneath a hail of books and wood planks. Before any conscious decision could even run through Jack's mind, he had already positioned himself between the mound of books and the invaders.
"Sam...," she said, her voice stifled by tears, and her hands icy in his. "I thought—I thought my magic could protect me from ever getting hurt again. But now I lost that, too. I don't even know who I am anymore."
Rowena stood at an angle that let her watch both the rift and the failing devil's trap. Her eyes were wide, with an expression he had never seen on her before, not even when she had flung herself into an abyss in a final grand gesture of self-sacrifice.
"One wrong move," the torturer said and scratched the blade along Rowena's throat to create a thin, superficial trickle of blood. "And I'll cut her throat right through! She might be dead, but she can still feel pain." He grinned. "She will know agony."
Of course. That much at least made more sense now. "I can't say I'm surprised it took her far less time to figure out how to move solid objects than any other spirit we've ever encountered," Sam mused. "She'll probably be able to manifest from the Veil soon."
But first, Dean had to get them out of this mess, and that required nothing less than a miracle. He shuddered, sucking in the cold air and kneeling up straighter at a sudden thought. Maybe he had been looking for a miracle in the wrong places. This was a long shot, he knew. One that had the potential of making everything so much worse, to bring Chuck down on them right then and there. He had to believe that survival instinct would win over blind devotion.
Cold fingers groped around the leather straps on his arms, but he was completely helpless against the sobs that shook him.
"It's here," Jack cut in, then felt bad about having interrupted Sam like that. Why did his timing always have to feel so off, so much clumsier than others when they interacted? He couldn't help it, couldn't fight the urge to finally do something now that they were so close. In an attempt to soften his abruptness, he added more words, "Right where I'm standing."
Stories had always been living in my mind, but I had never dared actually releasing any of the words from my mind to (virtual) paper for fear of failure. Yes, that's stupid, but it's still how it was. I had
"I... guess." Jack let the walkie-talkie sink down to take a look around. Daylight was waning quickly on this November afternoon. The perpetual cover of clouds seemed to grow thicker by the minute, immersing the whole world in an aura of threat. By Jack's estimation, he didn't have to walk much farther to reach the origin of the gunshots. He squinted when a cone of light appeared in between the trees a small distance away.
Sam's head began to hurt just trying to combine what was happening into a complete picture that made sense, and he touched his forehead with his empty hand, taking a step backwards. That was when Dean finally noticed the weapon he was holding.
On a shelf near the exit, he spotted the tattered lump of cloth that was his stolen jacket and snatched it up. He let go of Rowena and was still in the process of draping the garment over his blood-smeared torso when the door was shoved open right in front of them.
Jack gasped and sat up straighter, looking directly into the face that had ended his life once before in a burst of light and agony. Chuck's eyes flashed black. God held out his arm and black smoke rose from his skin as he turned his wrist with a gentle wiggle of fingers.
One hand on the backrest, Sam turned around in his seat to look back through the rear windscreen. He swallowed, silently staring at the atmospheric disturbance. His pupils constricted when the car was illuminated by multiple branches of lightning that forked and probably split a tree somewhere behind them, judging by the frequency of noise Castiel perceived.
He threw a desperate glance at Jack's unmoving form. His face was lifeless and pale in the orange glow and Dean was pretty sure the color on his lips wasn't looking quite right anymore, though it would have been easier to tell in a more neutral hue of light. If they were going to save the kid, they had to do it now.
"Still think we should have waited it out in the car?" Dean questioned, turning around to face his brother, hand closing fully around the bracelet. Castiel was sure he heard the slightest tremble in the hunter's voice, but Dean showed no other reaction to his message. This inability to communicate was infuriating.
With today being the 6-month-anniversary of the confession scene, I had the feeling the time had come to finally post this, after I had only dared to share this with a handful of people before. (You have no idea how mortified I was the first time I showed parts of this story to anyone for the very first time.) Many thanks go out to the first three people who have read (parts of) this, two of which will likely never see these notes: the three Bs — my boyfriend, my best friend, and my beta!
"I know." He tightened the embrace, understanding all too well the need to prove one's worth. "I know. But damn, never do that again." With a final pat on Jack's shoulder, he stood and helped Jack to his feet. "You good? Anything still hurting?"
"Will you finally let me open these things now?" she asked, letting her hands drop from his face, back to the straps holding him down.
He really couldn't be blamed for the fact that it took him a while to notice there was something seriously wrong with those angels, that this wasn't how it was supposed to be. They were contorted, merged together in a grotesque way, as if they had just taken one too many rounds in a blender. And that frigging
Just a few years ago, she would have laughed at anyone who dared insinuate she'd be this far gone. That she'd ever be all-in again, no backup plan, no discussion. The past version of herself had been so sure that choosing herself as her one and only confidant was the only option. All kinds of decisions had come so easily after that. It had been a good life, full of possibility and surprise, where everything could change on a whim.
Sam blinked at the incongruously domestic sight in front of him. Dean and Jack were sitting at a kitchen table in what could only be described as a relaxed posture, with Jack smiling in between two spoonfuls of some cereal from a bowl in front of him. Still unable to trust the peaceful scene, Sam didn't stow his weapon, just let it sink down to his side as he asked into the room, "Dean?"
He pulled it out of his jacket pocket and held it up for the demons to see. The noise around him died down, turning into the silence in the eye of a storm.
The man was unexpectedly quiet and Jack used the time to take several other steadying breaths. He had to get himself back under control, didn't want a repeat of the shivering from before. When the voice finally spoke again, focusing on it helped.
He scanned the room frantically for any sign of the others and was about to call Dean's name when he heard voices coming from an adjacent room. Something crunched under the soles of his shoes as he stood and Sam looked down. That something turned out to be small glass shards from a framed picture that had fallen off the wall. Not a nightmare then. It was hard to tell, sometimes.
Jack's heart hammered at the sight of his grandfather standing right where he himself had been just moments before. Frozen in terror, it took him several seconds to realize that he hadn't been noticed yet. Chuck was facing the other way, distracted by the rift in reality and locked in an argument with... himself. Eyes glued to the scene, Jack quietly retreated backwards until he was able to crouch down behind a shrub, whatever good that would do him in evading detection by God.
Jack actually looked relieved to hear this, while Dean rolled his eyes, though he didn't quite manage to hide his smile as he muttered, " 'Course you did."
"Hell if I know!" Dean grinned slightly at his own lame pun, waiting for Sam's reaction and relieved to see the mixture of exasperation and fondness on his face. Anything, anything other than that haunted look from the dungeon.
than any other angel had ever been. He really should be here with them now, in this final war. Sam still had no idea how an angel, of all things, had become their best friend. But he had, and Sam missed him, missed that aura of calm he somehow projected, fitting into a slot in their family Sam hadn't known existed until Cas had joined it.
"A girl has to know how to use what she's got to get by," she stated with mock-gravity, sharing a glance with him that made him feel like the spark from her eyes was springing over to his own, energizing him. "And she has to make good on her threats, lest she might not be taken seriously in the future."
That was all it took for a silent understanding to pass between them and they ran as one through a lifeless forest, towards the voice in the distance that mirrored Castiel's desperation in its call for Jack. It grew closer quickly and the familiarity of its sound sent a wave of heat through their body, made Castiel pant for air he didn't need.
Jack ran until he could feel that gentle pull again, tingling in the tips of his fingers. When everything had been confusing and overwhelming before, suddenly it was clear. He followed the pull further into the night, no longer trying to resist it by going the opposite way.
There was no telling how long he'd lost sentience when a veritable flood of warmth crashed into him, surrounded him, pulled him back up. Somewhere at the brim of awareness, he registered an incessant stream of thoughts that weren't his own.
"Rowena?" Sam asked with the urgency of a sudden insight and nodded to where Dean was standing. "What if we don't
He couldn't breathe, had to fight off a ripple of panic at the thought that there wasn't enough air in this place. Dark, everything was so fucking dark. He should have been lost, but something drenched him in an impossible certainty about where to go, carried him forward like an invisible compass.
He really hadn't thought it was possible for anyone to score higher in the department of lousy parents than himself, but Jack could certainly claim that prize. If he had turned to his skunk of a father for help, Lucifer would make short work of the kid. Crowley would be damned if he let that happen.
a clear vision in my head after 15x18 on how it would continue in the last two episodes. There were just so many strands of plot and development for a multitude of characters that had been brought up over the last two seasons, and the way I saw it in my head, all of those strands were running into each other in a way that made too much
Apparently, the pang of guilt that always struck Castiel during this particular memory was pervasive enough to reach Dean as well. He trailed off.
He'd have given anything in that moment to be reunited with at least one loved one, to feel the safety and comfort of an embrace.
He could feel her sobs against his chest, so he let his hands run up and down her back and buried his face into her hair, his eyes falling closed against the weight of their shared pain.
The moment the bedding was in place, he sank down, wrapped one of the blankets closely around himself, and could only just muster the strength to murmur, "G'night, Jack," as the kid settled down at the other side of the large mattress with the remaining pillow and blanket Dean had brought.
"I'm..." Jack looked down at his hands. "I'm not one of these assets." He splayed his fingers, then closed them into fists. "I lost my powers... again."
Dean and Sam exchanged a look and Jack was starting to think there was something obvious he was missing. Something big. He had no idea what exactly that might be, though, or how to even begin asking about it.
but that one fleeting moment of hope had taught him true despair, crushing what little resolve he'd managed to accumulate for the world's sake. His fingers had been only a hair's breadth away from grabbing Dean before he fell. Such a small distance, so inconsequential in almost any other situation. And yet, this time it had changed
"Uh—yeah. They're—actually pretty good. Thanks." Jack smiled, making the white lie worth it. Sam smiled back and finished his pear. "Listen, I'll go take a quick shower, then we can figure out what to do next."
"Dean," Rowena said more softly than she had ever spoken to him and placed Sam's hand on his shoulder. "You could have left me behind, but neither of you did. Thank you."
"We all made it, Jack. It's all right, Rowena said Sam will wake on his own. Just need to find a safe spot to bunk for the night."
"Guess that's a no then," Sam said with a sigh while picking the pen back up from the dirt road. He dusted it off and stored it in the backpack again together with the notepad.
The crease on Roderick's forehead deepened and he gave Jack another one of those wordless stares. Those, too, were something Jack had gotten used to by now. They probably meant Roderick's emotions got as loud as Jack's sometimes did. It made him feel a certain kinship to the demon.
absorb with wings that were made of nearly the same. The lightning bolt struck him, connected with the tip of one wing and ran further inwards from there. A sensation of searing heat threatened to consume him. It
Dean seemed to wait for him to say something else, searching his face. When Jack made no attempt to continue the conversation, Dean sighed and stood. Jack expected him to leave, to join Sam and Rowena at the other side of the room, and was surprised when Dean instead crossed the distance and sat down at the foot of the bed.
"Figured you could use a little more help in locating me, with the day being so appropriately dark and gloomy for an apocalypse."
Dean picked up on it, chuckled at his own joke, soundless in the Empty but shaking their chest in the shared joy that flowed between them. Energized in ways that were foreign to him, Castiel's true voice felt reinforced when he called this time, shaping the name of his past friend in growing expectation. His voice merged with Dean's prayers, forming a beacon of hope in a place that was the antithesis to the same.
Torn out of his own considerations like this, Castiel's thoughts were messy and unfocused, and he had no chance to adjust them given the instantaneous nature of their connection.
"Pray tell, lads, what is it that God desires so badly, the thing that he got in every universe but this one?"
