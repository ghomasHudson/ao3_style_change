It was a simple thing, him leading the group.  After the near death experience they all seemed to trust him more, he still hadn’t told them his name, but that didn’t seem to matter.  His suggestions were all logical, and only Dwight ever really conferred with him on any ideas.  It was nice, surprisingly.  The same day he told them his name, was the same day he found a cool new leather jacket.  Everyday he felt further and further from the soft crybaby of a pussy he’d become as a family man, which led him closer and closer to a life only barely adjacent to the one he’d lived as a hunter.  No connections, no emotions, just a rude, crass, and bossy son of a bitch.  The cool black leather and decorative silver zippers seemed to say just that.
“What’s up with the ducks?”  Dean glanced up, from his book, confused for a mere second before understanding passed over him.  Then he shrugged.
How Castiel ended up on the island.
“Dean!  DEAN! This isn’t funny anymore!  We’re adults!”  That made Dean laugh as he vaulted over the couch to head Sam off.  They were opposite of eachother, only the coffee table in between them, waiting to see who would head in any direction first.

as Cas effortlessly drops the trenchcoat from his form, then the suit jacket and sets them down neatly off to the side.
“Good luck brother.  And be careful.”  Then she was gone, and Castiel was alone.  His shirt catches the breeze and flaps around. He looked up to the sun and could hear birds calling in the distance.  There was no denying the beauty in his father’s creation.  He’d be lying if he said he wasn’t surprised to find it here, though.  In the cage of the infamous beast.  He supposed it would be easier to not question things if you were stuck somewhere that didn’t look like a cage.
“Yes, they’re all idjits.  But they’re our idjits.”  He told her softly.
“Thank you, Mary.”  And then he pulled her in for another hug.  He had to move, had to do something or he would be getting an ear full from Mary later.  So he stood, albeit stiffly, and walked over next to the two.  Cas pulled back from Mary and looked up at John.  John just clapped him on the shoulder once and then gave it a squeeze.
He knew that whole theatre bullshit did this kind of stuff.  The Dean of
“Stay the fuck back or you’re next!”  He shouted at them and gave a final swing to the skull of the misogynistic, abusive piece of shit.  His eyeball popped out and rolled slightly away from the mess that once could have been called a head.  “I know that was a little startling.”  Negan addressed the group without facing them, their utter silence was enough to know they were listening.  “Truth is I probably got a little carried away.  But it couldn’t be helped.”  He turned to them slightly, looking over his shoulder, the fire still crackled away casting ominous shadows on him.  “You scared?  Scared of me?  Scared of
“So what is it?  This plan.  You’ve got five minutes before I’m stripping.”  Dean told Charlie who aptly shuddered.
And I plan to honor those pre-existing face claims to an extent.  Certain characters from Lost will need to eliminated entirely in order for the characters from supernatural to be able to intertwine.  (I'm mainly looking at Richard for this.  Sorry Richard.)
“Yeah, I just couldn’t get words out.  And Cas was always watching me so carefully, he saw me blush despite the lowlight, I know it.  I stumbled to form words, so I just gave up and then pulled it out of my pocket and held it out for him to see.  I didn’t watch his face at first, ‘cause I was too nervous.  But after a moment he asked if it was for him.  I somehow grumbled out a yes, so he grabbed it really carefully to look at it.”  Dean remembered the reverant look on Cas’ face as he examined the bracelet as if it were something precious and priceless.  How he’d achingly waited for Cas to say something,
“Don’t thank me just yet.  We’ll have to convince everyone else.”  Dean told her.  Charlie nodded and grimaced down at her clothes.
“Yes, but they wouldn’t tell me.  They wanted you to hear it when you woke up.”  John said sounding annoyed which made Mary laugh, but it quickly dissolved into a frown.
“The best.”
Sam, you have to be
“So Sam, how’s Jess?  Any grandchildren coming soon?”  Mary asked and Sam laughed.
“He only promised to stop using TINY ducks.  Man, you’re an idiot.” Dean couldn’t stop laughing, Sam’s facial expressions were priceless and he just couldn’t wait to recount this all to Cas and laugh about it all over again.  This was gonna go down in history. The bathroom door slammed signaling Sam’s departure, but Sam could still hear the final bits of Dean’s laughter in his wake.
“You don’t have to tell me about telling Cas, but it might be a better place than wherever your brain is heading now.”  Charlie piped up and Dean wanted to curse at her, but knew better.  She knew him too well.  His whole rule about not commiserating with these people, stewing in his misery, always wavered around her.  Charlie was right, thinking about the good moments with Cas always made him feel a bit bitter, even if it stirred up that ache inside of him.  Charlie wanted him to share the weight with her.
“Cause he does.”  Cas doesn’t respond and gets in the car.
in there at first.  But
more bozos fell from the floor above into the rotunda.
“You know why I’m here, you took something from me.”  Dean levels the cosmic being with a fury of his own.
to indicate he knew what it meant.  He’d never even made Cas one of the bracelets before.  Sure, Cas had tried to teach him but Dean always gave up, it was Cas’ thing, not his.  “Eventually he’d looked up at me like he was about to cry, which freaked me out for a moment till he just said he was so proud of me.”
?  How do you expect us to watch you murder one of our own, and then turn around and fall in line behind you?!”  Asked a man from the crowd who attempted to glare Negan down, Negan just smirked.
“I spent a whole year thinking you might be dead and that you’d never know that I love you.”  Cas told him, Dean looked at him in awe as his green eyes watered over and he started crying too.
sandbox boys.”  He looks between the two, still defensively standing a few feet away from the board and not budging. “Come now, you’re so busy wanting to get back you don’t even realize what you’re missing.”
“Yeah, not my best moment.”  Dean admitted, very aware of how Cas’ body was pressed up against his in the bed they were now sharing.
with you.  You’re it for me, sweetheart.”  Dean told him, shaking a bit at the confession and watching as tears spilled over Cas’ eyes, surrounding the blue in water that broke Dean’s heart a bit just remembering exactly how much he loved Cas.
“Cas, buddy?  You got your ears on?”  Dean called into the darkness, turning away from the empty.  He wasn’t about to say what he had to say while looking at Meg’s face.  “I’m here for you.  Because you’re mine.  In some weird ancient heavenly laws.  All I have to do is say…” Here Dean took in a harsh breath and let it out in preparation.  “Castiel, Angel of the Lord, I reciprocate your soul claim, and claim you back.  You are mine as I have always been yours.”  Then quieter, under his breath. “In more ways than you realized.”  The static returned, louder than last time.  It built up and then hushed.  It didn’t drop off like last time.  Dean felt his lungs burn from holding his breath, though he didn’t even realize he had been.
One, giant yellow duck, was stuck inside the toilet seat protruding up at him with it’s bright happy face.  The thing was bigger than a cat. Bigger than two cats. Sam couldn’t even believe the sheer size of the thing and wondered where the
“I waited for you that night.  I was so shocked by what you’d said and you’d left this…”  Cas trailed off holding up his hand to look at it, spinning it on his finger with pinky and middle finger.  “I put it on a bit after you left, then I cried cause I felt like such a dumbass for not realizing what idiots we both were.  I think I curled up on your bed and fell asleep.  Woke up to Sam shouting and the foot of water in the cabin.  The rest was a bit of a blur.  Mainly I regretted letting you walk away.  This entire past year I would sit and think about how you would still be here if I hadn’t frozen.”  Dean let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding.  “It is my biggest regret.  Letting you walk out of that cabin without knowing how I felt.”  Cas sounded so beaten up about that, like the last year had actually been five long ones, and Dean could certainly relate.  “It’s been a year, I’d understand if you had moved on or-”  Dean pulled Cas into his arms for a hug, crushing into himself and feeling Cas melt so easily.
“Well, these ones could be dangerous.  They’re hunters after all. They’ll probably be able to figure out who we are and what can kill us.  I’ll have to give them advantages all the other humans never would have thought to ask for. You know how this works, I can’t be duplicitous with them.”  Erata hums in thought.
Or this is where we part ways.”
“Not the way you’re thinking I-” He stopped himself, toed his shoes off then gestured to the rest of the house.  “When were the boys getting here?  If we have time I’ll tell you most of it now, and you can ask questions when I’m done.”  Mary nodded at him.
“It’s Pancreatic Cancer.  Stage 3.  I’ve already scheduled myself to get any treatment I can, but it’s one of the deadliest cancers there is.  So I need you all to be good for me, don’t get weepy on me until after I’m gone if this is it.  I need you all to promise me that.”  The room was dead silent, John sniffled lightly trying to stop himself from crying more.  He’d known the other shoe would come, he just didn’t think it would smack him upside the face with something so… human. Dean had a single tear track going down his face and he was holding Castiel’s hand so fiercely it must have hurt.
“They are quite adorable.”  Cas admits, and Dean smiles at them over his computer.
It was during Charlie’s first stay since Cas had fallen that the topic of the ducks was brought up again.  During the past two months things had evolved… dramatically. What had started out as a simple
“Nothing.”  Charlie said far too quickly.
“Capisco.
“Jack is very succinct.” Cas smiles a bit.  “He said I barely had enough grace in me for the Empty to stake its claim.  And when you came and claimed me as yours, that was it.  The transition was done.”
She protected me.  She placed me in a bubble where nothing got to me.  She made me stronger, helped me survive.”  He held the bat strong above his head.  “
It was all for naught though when, just a week later, Cas noticed how poofy Sam’s hair was first thing in the morning.  Poor Sam spluttered cereal and milk everywhere when Cas asked.

“You’re exaggerating Sam.”

After she called the boys the day was a flurry of how many different ways the hospital could poke, prod, and scan him to make sure he was fine.  His brain was all back online and functioning.  He was diagnosed with mild amnesia, with the prognosis that he would start to fill in the gaps eventually.  All his physical parts were present and working, if anything he was a bit weak from sleeping for a year.  He’d need to hit the gym or something to start building back up what he’d had before he’d gone to hell, left there, and somehow woke up in this strange yet wonderful place.  Well… he hoped it was wonderful.  He’d have to do research, extensively.  Call Bobby, and dredge up other old contacts.  Go as deep as he possibly could to really figure this out. If it was safe here he wanted to know now, and not with his pants around his ankles in a public restroom.
“Bobby!”  John smiled, didn’t even care about being chastised.
“H-He asked me to do it.”  Cas told him, the knife was in his left hand, his right still wrapped around Dean’s shoulder.  His eldest son breathed softly in his husband’s arms, his face having a sick greyish sheen from the blood loss.
“Cas, I cannot have a conversation and watch you undress at the same time.”  Cas smirked at Dean, a heat simmering there that Dean recognized and certainly didn’t help with the whole conversation thing.  “What things?”  Dean says with admirable focus.
It's a shame really.
Sam snatched up his phone and quickly typed out a quick message to Cas.  Not bothering to go and find him in the bunker.
“I love you.”  Dean whispered to him and pulled back to see his eyes, feeling his own were distinctly damp.  Cas’s hand went to his cheek and wiped away the evidence, his own slightly watery.
“He’s awake?”  One asked in shock.
In hindsight, Sam should have seen this coming.  Should have known that Cas wouldn’t have been as adorable and naive as he was when they first met him.  That he wouldn’t always be the stoic Angel of the Lord with a penchant for popping Dean’s space bubble, making very long eye contact (Also with Dean), and never quite grasping the more indirect phrases and movements of human expression.  But Castiel, the billions of years old Ex-Angel, was no idiot. And Sam really should have seen all of this coming sooner.
This was exactly why he had been nervous.  This is what drove him to ask about the damn jacket before he could stop himself.
“You saved my life.  Not to mention I have you back, plus Mom and Sam,
?”  Dean asks incredulously.
“This stuff is really important Cas.  The internet is a basic utility. Just like electricity and running water.  You’ve got to know how to navigate it with ease.” Sam placates, trying to get the stubborn man to open his brand new laptop for the fifth time that week.  Dean looks on in mild amusement from the other end of the library table, and decides to chime in anyway.
“It’s so good to see you, Dad.”  Sam told him as he pulled away, then Dean came next.  He was more gentle than Sam, slightly more in control of his limbs than the tall and awkward Sam.  It seemed without years of training in fighting, Sam had turned into the clumsy nerd he’d shown traits of as a child.  Dean in comparison was steady.  He had that same lightness for the most part. His eyes had the same worried shine that his mother’s did.  But mainly he looked sure of himself. Confident in a way that wasn’t cocky or boasting.  Seeing his sons this way made him ache for the boys he’d left behind.  The one’s he’d done so wrong who were probably still fighting the good fight a world away.
“You should go east, try to reach Mt. Weather.”  Cas suggested but John just scoffed.
That wasn’t something they stayed.  Not for any legnth of time.  Never actually
It was a perfect day in late September, all the trees were changing into beautiful flowers.  All their friends were there.  Bobby was grilling, Ellen was supervising, her husband was who knows where.  His parents, Mary’s parents, even Castiel’s father.  Mary prepared a speech, with the help of Gabriel, which actually turned out to be more like stand up and then openly invited people to roast her.  Everyone was rolling with laughter well into the evening when they started telling old stories as they sat around a bonfire.  Eventually things quieted down and everyone left, leaving just John and Mary snuggled close unwilling to let go.
Though when he made that promise he always pictured himself being first to go, it would have been a nice change.  But he didn’t get nice, that wasn’t the way things went for him.
”  At this point Dean has started laughing so much that Sam couldn’t do anything but puff out a frustrated breath and wait for Dean to chill out.  Finally Dean had calmed enough to listen, his cheeks were pink and his green eyes were still glinting with mirth. “Where does he even get these ideas, Dean?”  Dean just shrugged and thought back to the past few days.
“Blondie, don’t you think we woulda noticed Garth driving over there?”  Victor said as he kicked one in the leg and plunged his weapon into its skull.
“Dad, this is Castiel. My… boyfriend.”  Dean reached over and grabbed the guys hand but if the words had been enough the gesture was overkill.  Mary’s hand hooked into his belt from the back to keep him in place, the message was blatantly clear.  His son had just came out to him as a damn queer by bringing a man into the house with him and she wanted him to be kind.  His brain was boiling at the wrongness.
In his moment of distraction a bozo came up on his left flank, Dean only had the warning of Charlie’s eyes widening slightly, he turned just in time to see someone from the other camp with short and curly blonde hair pounce on the thing and take it down.  Dean took out the one coming behind her then turned to help her up.
“Why did you keep my jacket after the levithan?”
“No, no more fighting.  If we can help it.”  Dean looked down in shame a bit, thinking of the fight he’d had with Cas only a few months ago that had driven him from the bunker.  He felt Cas’s thumb caressing his and looked back to see Cas looking around in confusion.
“But mom, she had to go away sometimes.  She was in business with her father and some cousins.  So when she was away she would threaten dad to shape up, and he did during the day but… at night-”  Dean let out a breath of air.  Charlie squeezed his hand and Dean let his arm slip down from over his eyes.  “He never hit us.  Never laid a hand on us, other than spanking a bit when we were really young.  But he wasn’t himself when he would drink.  Like half of him just slipped sideways out his ear.”  Dean tried not to shudder at the mental picture in his head, but kept talking by sheer will of not letting it drown him.  “He would walk a bit funny.  His one eye would go all squinty, I once asked him why and he said cause it hurt.  That was one of the first signs.  Sometimes he would just get caught staring off into space.  Other times you’d catch this smell off him and you’d be sure he’d wet himself.”  Dean swallowed feeling his eyes prick with the beginnings of tears.
“Yeah!  And if we capture the Queen’s left knight we want Sam.”  Cas agrees with this as well.
So he kicked in the door, sending the thing that was once his wife flying back onto the bed.  He went in and kneeled on it’s chest and pressed a hand to it’s forehead.  The teeth snapped dangerously, animalistic noises coming out of its throat.  He watched a tear drop down onto her face as she struggled beneath him.  Three and a half years of peace and happiness, only for it to come to this.  He slid the knife into her brain through her ear, hearing the sickening squelch and all it once she went still again.  His chest was burning, apparently he had stopped breathing.  As the air rushed back into his lungs the pain of it all flooded his system.  John moved mechanically, adjusting his wife’s body  to a proper position on the bed.  Carefully he tucked her in and with her eyes shut again he could pretend for only a moment that she was still sleeping.  He left the room.
Dean had felt himself falling a long time ago.  It was like looking down into the cage when they had opened up that fathomless void almost a decade ago.
“Yeah, but it took me like 10 tries to get it just right.  Even when I had something passable it was never as neat as Cas’ were.”  Dean shook his head remembering how many times his dumb fingers kept getting in the way, how many times he’d pinched them when tying a knot.  “So Cas, of course, didn’t ask why I’d summoned him to our old hang out.  I mean, we were 20 at that point.  We didn’t go up there super often anymore.  But like I said, he didn’t press it.  We just hung out and talked and argued and what not till it was well past midnight.  The lanterns were burning low, both of us were getting sleepy when  he finally asked if there was a reason why I’d left him a note instead of just texting him, or even just telling him.  I nearly clammed up, but I was determined if I was gonna tell someone it

“John!”  Mary admonished him, but he also just shrugged.
“Son?”
For now the plan was very slowly and carefully pressing forward, fortifying, then pressing forward again. Section by section,  bit by bit making sure they were good on three sides before moving more into danger.  It was going well, Dean was calling out directions,  Bobby and Ellen on either side making sure the rest of the team was paying attention.  Charlie was directing Dean, Jo was covering her while Victor watched Dean.  They made their way out of the old train station and up the first set of escalators, the goal today was to make it into the rotunda and block off the offshoots from it, while also fortifying the stores immediately there.  (Charlie was particularly excited about Barnes and Noble, Jo was creeped out by the idea of the aquarium which also gave Dean the creeps.  They would not be tackling that today either.  Victor just wanted to know if the subway would still have that familiar bread smell.)
“Yes.”  Jack tells them and gestures slightly.  “No one’s endings are written.  Free will with no strings.  Before or after death.”  Dean and Cas share another look, with Dean smirking slightly.  “Course, there were always a few things that were completely out of Chuck’s control.”  Jack tells them with a knowing look between the two of them that makes Cas blush and Dean cough out a laugh.
So, how are you guys feeling? Ready for more?  I know I'm really excited to write out this next part.  It's got me hanging on the edge of my seat and I'm the one writing it.  I've finished ironing out all of the literary components today, just need to figure out order of appearance and flow.
Here's for all the Walking Dead fun in this chapter.  For reference, the 2013 NYCC TWD panel took place the day before the premiere of season 4 for TWD.  I had fun rewatching this panel, and if any of you are also fans and feel like indulging, you can find it really easily on youtube.
the Rainbow Bridge.  I’ve got a whole task force being set up now devoted to tracking down the lost souls of pets.  Apparently Chuck didn’t find them important.”
“You can’t run forever.”  He hears Cas tell him as his eyes slip over to the hunk of metal next to his Baby.  Then his eyes slide back to Cas.
.  For some reason that memory had been permanently kaboshed from his noggin.  The whole spell was so much more complicated, and subsequently more powerful, because of this.  The energy from Hell leaking out onto Earth fueling the energy that would open the portal to the Empty.  Dean poised a knife to his shoulder over his jacket, the last place Cas had touched him and marked him.  He held a bowl with his other hand just below that and scraped lightly.  A few red flakes drifted into the bowl, then Dean walked forward, kneeling carefully and brought the same knife across his left palm, letting the blood run into the same bowl.  A breath passed through his lips as he raised the bowl to combine with the larger one.  As he does this he speaks, his voice clear and strong, determination powering him through his desperation.  He thinks of only one thing as he recites the words, even if he doesn’t know what they mean, each word is endowed with the same meaning.
“Dean?”  Says a voice that comes from the fuzzy shape above him that has shaggy brown hair.  A voice that echoes at him in his dreams and nightmares.
“If you wanna know more I’ll tell you.  I can remember all of it like I actually lived it.”
“What’s the deal, Doc?”  Dean asked, slightly slurring his words.  John shook his head though Dean couldn’t see it, and Cas leaned in to kiss his forehead, more tears leaking from the man’s bright blue eyes.  Dean must have taken the silence as an answer, because the next moment he moved on.  “I figure it’s not great.  Also, what the hell is that noise?”  John swallowed thickly.
“Don’t forget the

. After a moment Jack pulls away from the hug and Dean steps back into Cas’ space at his side.  Cas gives a little look of raised eyebrows as if to question his breach of personal space.  Dean ignores him.  “Not that we don’t appreciate the visit, Jack.  Cause we do.  Just feels like you need something.”  Jack nods at them.
“Yeah, course buddy.”  Dean clapped him on the shoulder, and guided him further into the bunker and slid his arm around his shoulders.  “But you gotta let me know, what the next stage of this plan is? You gonna take it any further?”
The slowly rotating duck mocked him, knowing his threats were empty.
“According to you and the boys it’s pretty ‘Badass’ but it’s a little dark for me.  The whole underground thing.”  Mary shrugs, John considered that but just shook his head.  He could worry about the human details later.
His time had come.
“We didn’t have much money growing up without dad to bring in the bacon.  I worked young, enlisted, came back, and met you. We fell in love, I started working as a mechanic, and married you.  Then we had Dean. There was a bit of a rough spot in the middle. Then we had Sam.”  Here John swallowed thickly, barely ready to say what came next.  “When Sammy was six months old a yellow eyed demon came to visit him.  You tried to stop him, so he killed you and lit the house on fire.  Everything burned, but the boys and I got out safe.”  His eyes went away from her, over the back of the couch towards the stairs.  He remembered how he woke on this very couch to the sound of his wife screaming.  How he had thrust baby Sam into Dean’s arms.  Mary didn’t say anything, just scooted in closer to him, curling up against his chest, tucking her head under his chin.  His arms came up around her and squeezed so tight his muscles started to ache almost instantly.  His voice choked on the next words.  “I lost myself Mary.  Losing you, the house, everything.  I was a single father and a widower overnight. Plus it was some… monster that took you from me.  I was confused and angry.  I wanted to avenge you.  I devoted my life to it, got lost in it.”  He sighed. “I know it sounds crazy, but that’s how it went.  I became a hunter, I went after all the things that went bump in the night just so I could eventually find my way to the thing that took you from us.”  Mary was so quiet, but her hand on his chest was busy, it went up to his neck and rubbed it gently.  She used that hold and pulled gently to sit up slightly.
“You won’t ever be able to leave this island, Castiel.”  His insides twist slightly at this but he still feels sure of his position.
“Well I’m just saying, the refugee camp wouldn’t have set it up!”  Jo snarked back, words seemingly armed to spite Victor while informing everyone else.
“He knows who I am, and who he is.  But he’s unclear about where he is, and he doesn’t remember the accident.”  The doctor hummed in thought.
some real humans?  Interacted with them?  Began to understand? Gadreel was sentenced to a cell for the rest of his existence for his insolence and disobedience.  That’s how the position opened up for Castiel.  (Course by the time the other angels noticed it was thousands of years later. Oops.)
“Guys, not now.”  Dean snapped, not in the mood to deal with them bickering.
“Quackers.”  He deadpanned.  Then Dean couldn’t hold back anymore. He was laughing so hard his cheeks ached from smiling.  Dean seriously hoped the rest of his life was spent this way. Always one-upping his own happiness.  Cas wasn’t surprised when Dean kissed him. It felt like an extension of all this happiness, like there was no better way to celebrate it.
“We want our memories.  Completely with no tampering no matter where you decide to zap us.  Even if we lose the game. Capiche?”
“It’s a surprisingly fitting name, considering he’s in prison.”  Castiel said like it was the most blasé thing.  Dean choked slightly.
“Jerk.”
“Oh wow that’s… some serious timing you have there.”  Charlie said and Dean huffed out a bitter laugh.
The boys tried to distract them, chattering about the news.  Things were going a bit crazy on the coasts.  Some new drug was making people act like rabid dogs.  Dean just brushed it off, but Sam was more concerned especially when towards the end of October reports were coming in from Houston of the same thing.  John really didn’t give a fuck, all his attention was on Mary’s few waking hours, which were fewer and farther between.  It drained him, all the background chatter, but he appreciated what they were trying to do.
about a boy.  Both of our sons are starting families.  You should be proud of them.”  John sighed and leaned his forehead against his wife’s.  Despite the weirdness of this universe, the peace was like a balm to his soul.  Even the mild discomfort of his son dating (And soon to be engaged to) another man, was nothing compared to the life he’d led them through the first time around.  He had never believed in second chances before he came here, but he was thankful everyday.  Somedays he even wondered if in this place he’d be able to die of old age, peacefully in his bed.  It was a fool’s dream before, hunter’s never got that old.  But now…
“Dean, where are Sam and Charlie?”  Cas turns to him alarmed, grabbing his arm and cutting off the rant mid procession.  Dean looks utterly baffled for a moment, several moments making Cas worry. Coy coughs slightly and Dean is hit with a sudden realization.
A cry of pain sounded from the front of the house and it turned into a scream.  John jolted into action, grabbing a shovel off the ground and he ran to the front of the house.  Cas was in the back seat of the impala, three zombies surrounded the car… and one had his leg.  Cas cried out again, trying to kick the thing off of him, John swung at the other two clawing at the classic car, smacking their skulls open with a sickening crack.  On the second one the handle splintered, so John broke it over his knee as he came and shoved the fractured handle up through the chin and into the head of the undead woman making a chew toy out of Cas’ leg.  It was over in a few moments.
“Smashing open the front is gonna leave us open to more dead from outside the mall!”  Charlie told him, which Dean already knew.
“I can’t think of any drug that would let you get turned into swiss cheese and you still kept going.”  She said in the most confused voice and put her tools back in her bag.  “See you a little after noon.”  That was weird thing number two of the day.
“What’s up pops?  Need something?”  In the background there was a vague beeping sound.  “I’m at the store right now, so I can grab you guys dinner if you want.”
in line or I’ll crawl up that pee hole of yours, get really deep inside so I can get a message to those Big Balls without anything getting lost in translation.  And I’ll say… Big Balls, I know you think you’re the King Shit of Fuck Mountain and you’re not accustomed to taking shit from anyone but things are
“Barely anything good.  Sometimes we went to a baseball game, or he would tie up a swing at the creek.  Sometimes there would be weeks where he was fine, and he loved mom.  That was one thing he never did wrong, even when he was deep in a bender.  He always came home.”  Dean let his arm drape across his eyes and felt Charlie squeeze him reassuringly.  “It was the PTSD.  Dad was in ‘Nam.  It messed him up so bad, but it didn’t hit him till after the house fire.  We lived in motels for a few weeks, the four of us.  Sam was just a baby, so he doesn’t remember.  We barely slept.  Dad kept waking up screaming, so then he started drinking just so he could sleep.  At first we were relieved, but then he didn’t stop.  He lost his job, mom had to go back to work, she was brilliant.  Dad was falling apart and she never wavered, she was always there for us.”  Dean swallowed thickly, thinking about his mom was always a sure way to make him weepy.  But this was
“Come on, Dad!  I want a turn too.”  Dean whined, coming closer to his father who swiftly turned away and towards the window.
“You know that really should have been our first clue.”  Dean intones and scrubs a hand down his face.  “I know I always
“Wait, are you saying you want Cas to be the new Death?”  Dean’s concern was evident in his voice.  He was tired of messing around with the fabric of the universe, he just wanted to be done with it all.  Maybe he’d just half to admit that that could never happen.
“That was a good day, wasn’t it?”
“Well, thanks for believing in me at least.  Now go get ungross then come find me so we can plan.”  Charlie smiled evilly, as if they were planning a prank war and not the biggest move their group would ever do.  Dean shook his head at her antics as he headed into the bathroom.  They didn’t have running water, but he could still rinse off in the tub with a bucket of water and some soap.  It was February now, almost March.  If they moved fast they could get to the Mall when the bozos were still slow.
“But Dean, I don’t want to go on a date right now.”  Dean made a snorting sound as Sam burst out laughing.
“Idjits.  The lot of ya-”  John chose that moment to pass Lucy to Bobby, which softened the gruff old man’s tone.  “Except you, little one.  I’m still undecided on you.  Could be the smartest Winchester yet.”  It was always in these moments that John found himself reaching for Mary, he reached for her a lot as is, but these moments when his heart filled his chest to the fullest point he just needed her, so they could share it.  But this time she gave him a look then swiftly darted her eyes between their two sons.  He nodded his head acquiescing and stepping towards Sam.
“Then you should tell them.
“You used to call Lucifer...
“Shut up idiot, what if Dad is sleeping?  He’s still in recovery y’know.”  There were some scuffling noises.
“My dwindling power levels.  I thought that was obvious.  I thought it was just me and all these years I had spent away from heaven.  But that was never it, it’s because you can’t actually have both.  So all this time my...soul,”  Cas said the word with a bit of awe. “Was draining my grace.”
“We find who we can, then we start moving.  Find a place we can fortify.  Hope the entire world doesn’t go to shit.”
“I wish I could have met him.”  Charlie said wistfully, he heard a shuffling noise as she turned to look at him so Dean tilted his head to look at her.  “Would we have gotten along?”  Dean couldn’t help but smile a bit at the thought.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I loved Sammy.  Being his big brother was one of the best things in my life.  But Cas… that was different.  We used to swing into this creek.  Daring each other to go higher and higher before we would jump off.  When Dad first hung it up, he called Cas a coward.  We were only seven at the time, so the drop to the water seemed so far.  But Cas was stubborn, even in the face of John Winchester.  I always envied him for that.  He was better at standing up to my asshole of a father than I was.”  Dean smiled a bit and looked down, his hands itching for a bottle or a glass, something to dull the ache that flared up.  He shook his head a bit to clear his thoughts, then looked back up into the fire.
“We were gonna have to block off the main doors with cement anyway.  As is, we need more time in here or we’re gonna get seriously fucked over. “  Dean told her which made Charlie grimace and nod.  She sent Jo over to the doors to direct the truck boys through.  Even though Garth aimed the vehicle carefully, there would still be a problem.  The digger they had found downstairs had brought out to knock down the cement vehicle stoppers, and with that destroyed Garth plowed through.
“Maybe not the best dinner time conversation, right Cas?”  Dean asked him and Cas’ eyes widened when we looked at Dean, as if just realizing what he’d been talking about.
“That’s why I built the box.”  Dean tells him then pulls his hand off his face by the wrist.
John let his heart ache, let the pain course through him because he was still alive, he needed to feel it.  Cas looked more disheveled than ever, his shirt still bloodstained from yesterday, his wild dark hair stuck up at odd ends with different smudges of dirt or blood.  Yesterday hadn’t been easy on either of them, in fact it wouldn’t be easy ever again, but Cas looked worse than that even.  As if his light had gone out.  John put a hand on his shoulder.
“Genius.”  Charlie breathed out, clearly impressed.  “So you were up there when you told him?”  Dean nodded and continued.
“You guys are the worst.”  Then he shut the door on them and went to his own room, a small smile shaping his lips.  Not bothering to wonder when or
he asking? He started flipping the Impala keys on his finger, spinning them around and then pocketing them.  He shrugged.
The ins and outs and go betweens that it took him to get here weren’t what mattered.  The state of the rest of the world, hell, the rest of the
“I’ll stick with Sam thanks.”  Jess laughed and checked her foam bullet supply, barely stepping out of the way as Dean and Sam ran for their lives with their mother hot on their heels.  “But if this is the secret to looking as good as Mary when I’m her age, I’ll take it.”  That made both John and Cas laugh as they all walked out more calmly together.  Which turned out to be a bad decision as the other three had teamed up to ambush them as soon as they stepped out the sliding glass door into the backyard.
“No.”  Dean said firmly, his voice dropping into a threatening gravel.  Cassie continued, voice pitched soft but frantic, as if she’d thought about this for a while and just never dared to say it.
When he had pictured his future, or his ideal relationship, or anything like that it had always been with Cas by his side.  Always within reach.  Even now in this apocalyptic wasteland, 7 months since the flood that had taken the two most important people away from him, it was hard to imagine any type of future.  He continued on, because doing anything else would be a disservice to their memory and their love for him.  Even when it felt like some days he was just existing, he’d push himself forward, reminding himself to live.  They’d talked about it, back in the early days of the apocalypse, the what ifs in case they lost each other.  Sam had told him to find someone to protect, so he’d found a group.  Cas had told him to let people in, had hammered it into him really.
It happened again and again, he would meet people, get to know them, he lost them.  They’re all weak and useless which made him more and more angry.  He stopped introducing himself to them, he didn’t see the point.  All they ever did was die anyway.  He told the last girl as much when she admitted she’d been bitten, and he left her.  He could do this alone if he had to, none of these people meant anything anyway.  He stopped trying to find people, and one day as he’s cooking a rabbit he shot over his campfire when he heard a noise that was too careful to be an undead bastard.
“But, I gotta ask Cas… where did you find that big of a plastic duck that looks like a King?”  Dean glanced at Cas and the mischievous look in his eye makes him laugh. This was a ridiculous conversation, Cas laughed too, loud and long.  Dean finally understood why Cas was messing with the ducks. He was honestly surprised he didn’t get it sooner.
“Twenty five years I’ve loved you, thinking that one year could erase that is crazy, Cas.”  Dean said into Castiel’s ear and felt Cas squeeze onto him even more tightly as he burrowed his face into Dean’s neck.  When he pulled back Dean put a hand to his face, feeling the stubble and smooth skin under his fingertips, the way his own heart soared when Cas leaned into the touch.  “Especially since I’ve spent my entire queer awakening being
universe never would have fallen victim to that whole agenda.  “Cas, why don’t you help me set the table so the other two can talk?”
“I’m right here, John.  Been here the whole time.  I love you too.”  She leaned in and he eagerly melded his face to hers, still crying like a damn baby as their lips met.  His hands went to her hair, he could smell her and taste her again.  It was better than heaven or hell, this was real.  The woman he loved, alive again and in front of him.  When she pulled back he could see the smile on her face, he could see the lines of aging he didn’t remember since they never got to grow old together.  He loved them just the same but yearned for the years he had missed.  He got lost staring into her face, those beautiful blue eyes.  So kind and loving. “Do you remember what happened?”  She sat back on the bed, giving him some space.  Once upon a time she had known him so well, known how easily he’d gotten lost in her.  Regarding what she said though…
Sam heard a crash in the bathroom and jumped up from his perch in the library to investigate.  His hand went to his gun, unholstering it and flipping off the safety, years of instincts flying to the forefront of his mind.  He got to the bathroom quickly and nudged the partially open door with his elbow. He raised his gun partway, but then lowered it when he realised  it was just Dean. Rolling on the floor of the bathroom. And laughing.
“Sh-, Uh… Shower sounds good?”  Dean manages to get out and internally groans.  God, who the fuck is he?  Some shy little teenager with stomach butterflies? It’s horrible and embarrassing.
They still watched Titanic though.  And Dean totally didn't cry.
“Just some ambitious dumbasses trying for a better life.”  Victor answered, which made Dean breathe a little easier.  Their causal yelled conversation was almost comedic, too bad it couldn’t last.  Twenty or so people managed to make the work easier after they’d all jumped the blockade, but the bozos just kept coming.  Dean’s group kept working to clear a path for Garth, they needed a good path so the truck was still operable, and Garth was almost done blocking off the right side.  As the blocks were placed, more people took up space behind them with spears to poke at the bozos gathering on the other side.
“What now?” He asked, Cas just shook his head and passed Dean the phone.  Dean burst out laughing again as he scrolled down the conversation. But then pouted slightly at the end.  “So no more ducks?”
?”  His fury knew no bounds at that point.  “Whatever you guys were doing it stops
“Ah, ah. Shit.”  Dean said in between laughs. “I’m bleeding.”  Sam turned back to him and sure enough, the big idiot must have smacked his elbow when he fell over.  Sam went to the closet to pull out the band-aid box… where upon ANOTHER large yellow duck fell off one of the shelves inside and hit the floor with a smack.  Dean laugher began another verse behind Sam, while Sam huffed out an angry breath and threw the box of band-aids at Dean. Which Dean
“Yeah, sure is.”  He tilted his head to consider.
“The one that was 145 years long?”  Mary said with a slight smirk, John smirked too and laughed lightly.
“This is good.  Safety in numbers.  We can really do some damage… maybe go back and clean out that hotel or find a better place… Whatever.”  He was distracted by one of the newcomers, a young girl with short hair shivering even next to the fire.  These days he might be a total shit mouth, but he still knew how to be chivalrous.  The jacket slid off his shoulders easily.  “You cold?  Take this.  I’ll go find you a blanket.”  The girl jumped away from him, loooking startled and afraid to meet his eyes.  “Easy girl, I don’t bite.”  He told her as he set the jacket onto her shoulders, but she didn’t relax.
“Actually, Mom, we named her after you.”  Mary turned surprised eyes on Sam.  “I mean, we didn’t want to name her Mary, that would have been too confusing.  But Jess liked your middle name, and so did I.  We figured Lucy would be the perfect nickname for her.”  Sam turned a sweet smile towards his father where his little girl laid in her grandfather’s arms.  Mary came around and hugged her very tired son, who was now a father.
he was.  That this was his true destiny, despite what any of his superiors might think.  He could feel it deep in his grace.  Still he could understand their hesitation.
“I know I won’t.  You’re my girl, that’s it for me.”  He kissed her hair softly.

to one another.  If you win I’ll release you from my control with Sam and Charlie, both unharmed.  But if I win, the game starts over. Do I make myself clear?” Coy finishes by leaning into the chess table, placing his palms face down on the glowing surface.
“What are you suggesting then?”
“Well let’s hope they’re friendly.  Now stop yapping you idjits and concentrate!”  Bobby scolded from where he was back by the escalators to the aquarium, still poking out the dead as they climbed up.   His admonishment was well timed too as a shattering sounded from above and many
“Well, we’ll need to run quite a few tests, just to make sure you’re alright.  But if all goes well you might be able to go home tomorrow.”  John grumbled slightly at that, wanting out of that bed sooner than the next day.  He needed to figure out what exactly was going on.  “I’m Dr. Vhlakavos by the way.  Very happy to finally meet you, Mr. Winchester.”  With that the doctor nodded and corralled all the other staff out of the room leaving just him and Mary.  Silence settled over them.  Something Mary had said caught his attention.  She’d mentioned Sam and Dean.  So they were here in this strange place too.  Doing what though?  Were there even monsters in this universe?  Maybe no demons, but what about vampires?  Werewolves?  Ghosts?  His brow furrowed.
“Don’t try to get up John.”  But she smiled at him, her eyes shining with tears.  He’d never seen her cry, she’d always been stronger than him.  Her grip on his shoulder was grounding so he moved his other hand to cover hers.  He wanted as much of her as he could get.  He smiled stupidly at her, he could feel it on his face.
Dean carefully cleared his throat and then shut the door to the Impala, the sound of it echoing in the bunker garage.  “So… what happened to the jacket?”  He fiddled with the handle slightly only letting his eyes glance up to Cas momentarily where he stood observing the Ma’lak box.  At the sound of Dean’s voice Cas turned, his head tilting slightly.
“Then why not just pick a girl?  Wouldn’t that be easier?”  Dean sighed and glared at his father, finding some steel in his spine apparently.
“Makes sense.”  Garth chimed in with a nod from where he was stoking the fire.  Billie sat back in the corner, wrapped in a blanket, seemingly staring off into space and ignoring them.  The rest of the group had picked other rooms in the house, half the reason they’d stayed was the amount of fireplaces throughout the mansion.  That way they didn’t have to spend every night in a cold huddle on the floor, they could actually spread out.  “Can’t be a big brother all the time.”  Garth continued.
“A what?” It said almost with a growl.  Dean chuckles under his breath.
“That wouldn’t be far off.”  Cas admits. “However, I’m really not sure how this would play into it.”  Cas says pointing at the chess table and stepping towards it to examine it closely.
.”  Negan let that sink in for a moment, letting the lie marinate like the truth of a good steak which he wouldn’t be having anytime soon.  “I wasn’t scared.  I wasn’t sad.  I wasn’t angry… well…
“What about when you told Cas?  I’m assuming you told him first.”  Charlie got out finally, sending Dean reeling back to the time when he wasn’t sure he was ever gonna tell anyone.  At the time it felt like the end of his world, the horrible irony was that it
“Just smash through the front!”  Dean called out to the guys, and Garth took off leading that team back down into the train station to coordinate.
“Over the moon.  Maybe further?”  Dean answers, opening his eyes to find Cas smiling fondly at him.
“What I wanted.  It’s. My. Sand. Box.”  Coy says as if he’s lecturing small children.  “Have I made myself clear enough now? I didn’t want you to remember him... and so you didn’t!  I wanted you to focus on the important things, but no! I guess you always have to give the ass a carrot to keep it moving, mustn't you?”  He clucks his tongue at them. “You need to figure out what’s
“I want you to cover us up and get out of here, go find other people.  Whatever crazy other life you lived in that coma made you stronger than the rest of us, you need to go help others or at least try.”  John nodded, he didn’t know what else to say.  He hadn’t really said goodbye to his wife or his son’s.  But he would try.
“I love you.  Forever and Always.”  Mary chuckled wetly against his neck.
shoe.  “Fuck.”  She started moving toward him, and despite the danger he was rooted to the spot.  His hunter’s instincts were backfiring even though he knew the thing moving on the bed was no longer his wife it was still a horrifying site.  She started to turn and roll but her legs were caught in the sheets, more tears dripped down his face as he pulled out his pistol, he knew where this was going.
“What’s the situation with the tumour?”  Jess asked, coming up to sit on the bed next to Mary while Lucy slept quietly in her car seat, no idea of the family turmoil around her.  “I am a nurse after all, I’ll make sure you get the best.”  Mary reached out to grab her hand and squeezed it.
Once they broke out onto the main floor, the smells of rotting flesh and fish were overpowering.  A few people had to break from formation as they lost the contents of their stomach.  The bozos were overwhelming.  They hadn’t made too much noise, but that didn’t seem to matter because the bozos were making enough noise to summon more of them.  Then the open flow plan was causing lots of crashing noises as the bozos in the upper levels fell over the railings and obliterated themselves on the bottom floor.  For the most part that killed them, but the ones falling from only one floor above often survived enough to cause issues.  It turned to chaos quickly.  They needed to get their truck with the cement blocker into the mall, but there wasn’t a way to do it without making a fuck ton of noise.
She was cool to the touch.  His heart jolted painfully as his fingers went to her neck praying to any deity out there.  No one was listening, he glanced up at the once bouncing green line to find only a flat stagnant thing.  He pressed a hand to her cheek, checking again as if there was some mistake and her head rolled listlessly onto the pillow.
“Well… not actually gone.  Just a powered down, simpering little human.  He’ll never fuck with us again.”  Dean told Cas who nodded gravely in approving acknowledgement.  “Jack leveled up.  Big boss now so he evened things out.  We’re real proud of him.”  Dean tells the last part to Jack who smiles just slightly. Cas gives Jack a little half smile and then pulls him into a hug.  Dean feels his heart squeeze in his chest again, just looking at his
“Yes.  I know it’s gonna sound crazy, but I wanna tell you all about it when we get… home.”  His throat choked up on the end, eyes watering.  He hadn’t had one of those in so long.  Not since the fateful night that consumed everything he once was.
“No point.  I’ll learn their names if they live more than a few days.”  Despite his attitude he appreciated being brought in by these people, they didn’t need to do this, but they accepted him and his bad attitude easily.  At this point everyone just assumed we all had a fuck ton of baggage.  Together with this new group they found a hotel, and even though he hadn’t wanted to he’d started to remember their names, it had been a few weeks by that point and his guard had started to drop again which was incredibly stupid.
“No.  You should tell me.”  She said and reached out to grab his hand, not any sort of move on him, just one friend supporting another.  Dean squeezed her hand back.
“Uhh, Sammy.  Cas taught him how to make them, but Sam didn’t think he could get away with making me another rainbow one.  So for my 21st birthday he made this.”  Dean remembered his little brother’s firm and determined look on his face, when he made Dean promise to try to find happiness and stop worrying about what everyone else thought.  Sam had always been wise beyond his years, knew Dean had been struggling so much at the time.
“Meg?”  The Demon sits in a simple black throne of shifting goo, looking very
Mary didn’t wake up till the next day in the hospital, it had been more than 24 hours and John’s nerves were frayed.  The boys had been for visiting hours and he’d sent them both home, all of them were a mess without Mary as a buffer.  When she came to she was groggy, not coherent really except for one thing.
“You’re sure about this, Cas?”  John asked, looking in his eyes for what may be the last time and squeezing his shoulder.  Cas held his gaze and nodded back, it was mid afternoon now, the air was slightly warmer than it had been that morning when they dug the graves.
It was early morning in the Winchester household. Dean and Cas were kissing in the kitchen, where warm light filtered through the window, content in each others’ arms.

by Anonymous. It's one of my favorite SPN fics, a long, epic, canon-compliant Dean/Cas s4/5 fic that is so good it feels like it happened between the bits of the show you saw, going through the character arcs of both Dean & Cas in such an *amazing* way that you just keep being surprised by what happens, even as it sticks to canon events. The Cas character development and the writing for him is spot on, the vibe of the whole piece, the interspersed dreams about hell Dean has and the way he's like, wanting to go back there most of the time and just waiting around for it, Cas wanting to save him [emotionally] but being unable to? There weren't a lot of Sam moments but those, too, were *awesome,* and the ending of the fic is *utterly brilliant.* (Despite being written years ago, it manages to eerily line up with where the show took their characters, too...)
Alastair clicked his tongue. “Now now, grasshopper, don’t get uppity on me.” He reached up and before Dean could do more than brace himself he could feel his ear being twisted. He let out a breath between his teeth and glowered ahead into the darkness, his steps faltering for only a moment. Alastair let go, and then they were back to that downward climb.
Noise.
On the banks of the river grew thorny rose brambles. They crawled up the rusted spikes holding disembodied heads, picked more or less clean by scavengers, the flowers sucking up the blood from the newest ones that soaked into the loam. Dean kicked one of the spikes with his boot while he waited for Alastair to haggle their fee across the river on one of those rickety boats, with a figure who seemed to think “mouldering grey robes” was the height of fashion. The severed head swayed a little, and the jawbone on the half-rotted thing fell a little lower. Dean kicked the spike again.
between his teeth.
Dean nodded. “Right,” he said, not convinced. “So what’s this new spell?”
There was a pause. “Which one?” Jack asked.
Dean nods nobly. He knows what he has to do. Himself. Thankfully, despite his anger towards Jake, Cas’s television program has him in the zone.
“…Okay,” Dean said. “Oh, uh, while you’re at it,” he picked up a book from the table. “Return this to her, would you?”
"Sorry, sweetheart," Dean murmured. "No can do. I don't exactly wanna end my life as an angel condom."
Dean looked at the wall. “I don’t know,” he said tiredly. “I just… all day today I was walking around, finding this damn fruit everywhere,” he gestured at the fruit bowl, “and all I could think when I saw those vacant spaces—the, the chair, the spare room—was how
"I need a ride."
“How fast you talking?”
“Well, no—maybe. Management is terrible; the work is repetitive, I don’t feel like we’re having any good impact on this town, I don’t know what anything I sign is for… I could be authorizing things I don’t agree with. I could be signing off on forest logging operations for all I know! Are you aware how harmful that is to wildlife?”
"Not that kind of ride," Meg said, with an insincere smile. "We're going deep, Nanghait, deep into the Pit. We're gonna follow an angel."
He proceeds diligently, saving the day through the power of jerking off.
“I didn’t know you were having a friend over,” said Cas.
Cas smiles. Jake watches from the Empty, enjoying his own private R-rated film, and recording it with a hand-cam. (It gets lonely in the Empty.) When Cas notices, he turns his head. “Thank you for your help, friend,” he says, before snapping his fingers. The tv turns off, leaving them in privacy.
She didn't know the whole Plan, of course; even Azazel hadn't told her that, and no one after him had given her the time of day. Still. She knew more than the average demon. She knew it had something to do with Dean Winchester. Dean Winchester who'd gone missing right around when the angels attacked.

"Doesn't all of Hell smell like sulphur?" Dean said, following; he walked and climbed as close to the walls as he could, reminding himself not to look down. "How did it get

Cas crinkled his brow. “That doesn’t seem good.”
“Yes,” says Cas. “But first, I need Sam to leave the room.”
Uriel looked at him curiously. “Oh
“I remember,” Cas said.
If something had gone wrong with the Apocalypse, she was going to kill Dean. But she'd have to find him first.
Each world had its own rules. On Earth it was easy. You fight, you get hurt, you die. You need food and rest, you grow up, you change; everything was in constant flux for the beings on it, but the world stayed pretty solid and dependable.
He went inside.
The teeth-rattling noise of the brightness was louder, now. She could barely hear the soul screaming under her hand, and she was just stabbing mechanically at this point,
“Well, he’s a demon,” Cas says, as though this is obvious. Jake’s eyes flick black, as he and Cas carry on with the R-rated activities.
“Yes,” Cas said seriously, missing the irony. “She asked me to meet her at the gazebo in the park.”

“What do you think they’re doing up there?” Dean asked.
It was bad, that much was obvious. Alastair was an old and powerful demon, the High Inquisitor himself. He didn’t run.
“Get in,” the ferryman said dourly.
“Mm, maybe something a bit saucy,” Dean said.
… it let go of her skull and she blinked, sight coming back to her. Blood was weeping from her eyes and nose, her mouth crusted with vomit.
“Oh he’s making contact all right,” says Sam.
“Battleship,” Dean said, skeptically.
“I’m fine, Dean,” Cas assured him.

“The portal’s closed, Cas, I’m stuck here,” Dean said.

“If you think I’m ever gonna work for you, you have another thing coming—”
"Covering my tracks," Dean said, almost kindly. "No hard feelings, it's just the luck of the draw."
When they were aboard, he punted from the edge, long pole casting them into the current.
Belphagor nodded in surprised approval, sunglasses still firmly in place.

Cas walked quickly away from his house, walking purposefully toward the park. The shiny gazebo was sitting in the middle of nice paths and a bed of yellow and pink flowers, and Anna was leaning against the side of the rail and looking into the distance. She turned her head when he arrived, her red hair shining in the sunlight.
“Right,” Cas said, still staring down. “For my family.”
“Well,” Ben said, “Uriel informed us otherwise. He told us how Castiel murdered Zachariah at dinner, then blackmailed Uriel to hold his silence.”
“That’s why I noticed him,” Jack explained. “I met him a few days ago when I was taking myself for a walk. It turns out that he lives in the neighborhood. And now we’re—what was it?” He turned to the other kid.
Cas put two fingers to Dean’s forehead, as Dean stared back into his eyes. “We’ll go somewhere nice,” Dean said. “Somewhere happy. I promise.”
Alastair said nothing.
Inside, Cas says, “Right now Jake and I are generating a large amount of cosmic energy. If we complete the circle with someone from the human plane, we should be able to penetrate the Empty and escape.”
“Remember what I told you? When humans really want something—”
“They’re not talking about it,” Anna said.
They turned and looked at the awkward sway-hopping of a gruff-looking, scarred man nearby who looked like he’d learned everything he knew about dancing from fighting vampires.
His dreams were fragmented things, always filled with blood and the rending of flesh. The only difference was, sometimes it was a nightmare, and sometimes it wasn't.
Alastair smirked at him. "It's not exactly a prime vacation spot, you mean."
Rowena smiled at him primly. “I came because your brother called me. I heard your angel got himself killed and you were having some trouble getting him back?”
“Yeah?” Dean said, skeptically. “And you’re gonna help us why?”
“Dean,” Cas said, looking intensely at Dean. “Don’t get yourself in trouble too.”
“So, how’d it go?” Dean asked.
Dean shrugged helplessly. “I don’t know. Food?”
friends,” Dean said, in a hushed voice that wasn’t actually that hushed. “So uh…” he gestured at them. “Quite a resemblance you got goin’ there, huh?”
“You may have a point,” Cas admitted.
“We’re not married, Dean,” says Cas, exasperated. “And anyway, this is more important than that. I need your help to get out of the Empty.”
it’s His,” Lilith said, tossing her hair. “But I’m talking about the reward.”
. How she was looking forward to a bath, even in the public halls outside the torture chambers: brown, sludgy water that was always ice cold, chipped porcelain tubs with streaks across it that had never scrubbed off. She had a fur robe she'd stolen from a visiting general who'd taken her for another mindless grunt and didn't look twice as she shoveled shit inside the stables. The caravan with its piles of warded trunks, easy enough to open with the right spells and bartered trinkets and a good amount of luck—she'd tossed her astralagoi and found it holding. (It had still been a risky move; if the general had caught her before he'd moved on she could've been thrown back on the rack, or worse. But it had paid off.) Just a few more hours and she'd be out of here…
Cas looked away from Dean, finally, to smile tiredly at Jack. “Yeah.”
“Whatever you want is good with me,” Dean said, and Alastair scoffed.
When Alastair finally called a halt Dean didn't actually process it for a moment, just realized he wasn't moving anymore and the scream in his joints and the soles of his feet protested, as though complaining about the sudden lack of abuse. Jolted out of his pleasant numbness. They were on the edge of a canyon, striated, striking out to either side and opening vastly beneath him, below the shadeless sky. For a moment, absurdly, he wondered how they'd managed to walk all the way out of Hell and to the Grand Canyon without him noticing. Then he saw the sluggish ooze of lava crackling past underneath and realized—right. It only looked like the Grand Canyon. If the Grand Canyon was filled with lava, that is.
yes? You really want to?”
“Dean!” Sam shouted, running into the map room. Dean was sitting there with Miracle. They were communing.
His nipples were pebbled in the cold air, gooseflesh rising on his skin. He worked his hands into his jeans, shimmying them off his hips, teasingly, inch by inch, until they caught at his knees. There was a flash of approval from Alastair, then, so he let them stay, holding his legs together even as he tried to widen his stance; dipped his hand low over the straining fabric of his boxers and palmed himself roughly. Again, again; letting it fall only when Alastair stepped forward as though unable to stay back a moment longer. Dean freed his cock from the fabric, leaking at the slit, and rolled his hand around it, pumping smooth strokes. "Like this? You like it?"
“Watch it, man!” snapped the janitor.

Alastair sighed, sticking his hands in his pockets. “Is there anything you want from the lower city before we go?”
He climbed over deadfalls and small ravines. He scaled trees strong enough to hold his weight, and looked out over the tall, endless forest. He walked closer to the salt tang, until the dry ground made way to brackish puddles smelling of a rotting sea, standing in still pools around the trees, a bare waterland that came up to Dean's knees before he finally turned back.
He and Cas had used to watch movies in here, when Cas was staying. Once a week or sometimes more, they would just forget about whatever shit was going down and let the stories take them somewhere better, safer… Dean reached for a bottle and noticed as he did that there was a DVD case sitting on the TV stand. Sam rarely came in here, and he wouldn’t’ve left a movie out. Dean walked closer, shining his flashlight on the plastic.
“Nasty that,” he said.
“So has
“If I want to figure out what their ‘breakthrough initiative’ is,” Cas said, doing air-quotes around the term, “I’m going to have to get on the inside.”
“What? Who said, what’s going on?” Dean asked, suddenly paying attention to how odd Cas’ tone sounded.

“Belphagor and I are the only kids in town,” Jack explained, shrugging. “It wasn’t enough to justify the tax dollars.”
"Oh, I like it. Give me more."
Before he knows it, Cas is slowly materializing in front of him, pulling away from the Empty, coming closer by the second. When he’s fully corporeal, Dean’s eyes well with tears. “Man, it’s really you.”
“Yes, mistress.” He scuttled aside, leaving the room, the floor-to-ceiling doors swinging shut with a
“Since the Empty won’t let Cas out, we’re going to open a door and send you boys
Dean collapsed onto the bench next to Cas, who looked over at him.
Jack turned the radio on as he went back to chopping vegetables, and a country song drifted over the airwaves through the peaceful town of Arcadia.
“Dude, do you have to watch that when I’m right here?” asks Sam.
“What was that about?” Balthazar asked in a whisper, once he had gone.
Cas smiled. “Jack has a friend. Isn’t that nice?”

She screamed.
A suicide tree. He didn't think there were any this far out.
“I hate my job.”
“To hell with this, I’m pulling you out,” Dean said. He dashed out of the salt line. Despite the fact that he could barely see Cas’ face, he could still make out his expression. That familiar, loving, sad expression that seemed to say ‘this is useless, let it rest now.’

Dean awoke to the shimmer of heat-lightning beyond the cave entrance and a far-off rumble pounding in his bones. Alastair was asleep; with a little stealth and gritting his teeth against muscles that had seized in the cold night, Dean managed to stand quietly, holding himself up with one hand, and hobble closer to the entrance, looking out. The storm, in its immensity, filled the slice of air he could see between the canyon walls, bursts of light and staggering, crackling arms of blue-white energy across the deep. There was no rain, not here in the dry lands but a fullness in the air that hadn't been before, a warm, wild rush. It drew him forward. Curiosity. But there was a hush between the bursts of distant thunder that seemed to rest somewhere in his throat, like clear water; and a hum against the sand. Dean had edged out of the cave without realizing it, head tilted toward the sky, and then he was climbing back up the canyon wall.

“It’s fighting back,” Rowena said.
“All right hotshot, you’ve won the game, you don’t have to look so smug about it.”
[These are technically end notes, to read after the chapter, and may contain spoilers. Unfortunately, my end note was apparently too long, so I had to split it & put some of it here instead.]
“Yes and No.”  Jack answered and started to pace away from them slightly. “Let me explain.”  As he continued he walked back toward them and gestured around like a teacher.  “I did a lot of research about this, about the world.  About everything and how it used to be run.  I want it to be able to run like it should.  Without me having to intervene, but also I want it to be inclusive.  So I’ve met and talked with what’s left of the old God’s.  And I’ll be going to the Empty to potentially redeem a few of the others.”  Jack paused and smiled at Dean.  “Kali was a big help in convincing them all.  She apparently still appreciates you saving her life during the first apocalypse.  Anyway, humans are varied.  For the most part they’re good.  But they believe in so many different and beautiful things.  I want them to have those things.”  Dean stares at Jack confused but Cas seems to understand, he’s smiling at Jack.
“Go ahead, Cas”  Mary said with a smile, and gently squeezed her husbands thigh as she sat down next to him.  Cas also sat, nearest to them on the other couch.
“Oh I’m sorry Doctor Headshrink.  And you got your degree from where?  The College of Any Online Information you could digest in a week-long obsession?”  Dean snarked back at her and Charlie laughed easily.
“Of course.”  Then he nods at Dean.  Dean nods back, looks to the duck, then back at Cas and shrugs.
“If he finds us, he’ll
“Lawrence, I’d hope.”  Mary smiled at that.
“I’m gonna say it again more slowly, you took something from me and he doesn’t belong to you.  Your deal is
He took the same care he had with Mary but he couldn’t bring himself to look at her again.  Minutes or hours passed, it was hard to tell in that haze of pain, but eventually he went back down the stairs and found Castiel in the same position.  At the sound of John’s feet he sat up and John sat across from him.
.  He mouthed to her still face, unable to speak anymore.  He tried to get back on track, he needed to call the nurse, her parents, his boys...
“Yes, I do.  I need to ask something of Cas.”  Jack tells them and a door appears behind him.  It’s black and ominous, but they all know where it leads.  Jack turns around and walks through the door without looking back to see if they’re following.  Dean and Cas share a look of confusion before moving forward after their son.  And if Dean grabs Cas’s hand again, then that’s nobody’s business but theirs.
“Yes, it is Dean.  I find it very cheery.  Humans have such an endearing way of making simple things so… happy.”
Castiel looks at the basket in ponderance, then a smile breaks out on his face and he thrusts his hand into the plastic bag from which he had just procured the hair washing bottles.  Gripped between two fingers he pulls out a small yellow thing and places it in the basket. Then he smiles proudly at it and steps away.
”  Dean couldn’t hold himself back, he rushed forward, clutched Cas’s face in his hands and put their foreheads together.  “It worked.  You’re here.”
On the last week of October, in the middle of making a pot of coffee at 7am his phone rang loudly in the empty kitchen.  Mary hadn’t woken up for a few days and the nurse was due in half an hour.  He couldn’t fathom who would be calling him this early.  The caller I.D. showed Bobby Singer, so he pressed the answer button.
“I’d say frustrated.”  Cas said, dropping their hands, standing up, and coming to sit on the edge of Dean’s bed so they were even closer.  “Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine you yelling that at me.”  Cas sighed and bumped shoulders with Dean, smiling shyly.
“I thought that was my life.  My dad ran out when I was young, mom raised me until she’d fulfilled her duties.  I think I reminded her too much of him, so she ran off to Maine to open her B&B… While I’m going through will you tell me what’s similar and what’s different just so I can start to get a grip on what I’m supposed to know?”  Mary nodded and smiled slightly.
“How long was I out for?”  John asked which made Mary’s smile falter.  She looked away and squeezed his hand tighter.  She let out a breath like pressurized steam.
“She had died.  In 1983.  Killed by one of those monsters.”  Suddenly John looked up at Bobby carefully, one of his hands was braced on the desk and sure enough on his ring finger sat a gold band.  “So was Karen.  It’s what brought us together in the beginning.”  Bobby whistled at that, looking down at his ring finger.
“He is dating someone, but it’s a more… recent development.”  Mary cleared her throat slightly and looked away.  “I’m sure Dean will tell you about that though.  In time.  Oh!  I should call them, I’m the worst mother ever.”  John chuckled at her frantic moment, finding even her familiar forgetfulness endearing.
“That is unlike Sam.”  Cas said in a puzzled tone as he pulled on his jacket while Dean slipped on his shoes and headed to the garage.
“Mary?”  He asked with a choking voice and tears falling down his face.  Purgatory be damned, this was heaven as far as he was concerned.  Anywhere he was with her was heaven.  He felt more tears tracking down his face.  “Mary.”  He tried to lean forward, he wanted to grab her face.  Feel the smooth skin, kiss those lips, hug her against him.  She was faster than him though, a firm hand pressed on his shoulder keeping him back.
“Yes sir.  I’m on it.”
“Your mother.”  John said quietly, Cas scrubbed a hand over his face and closed his eyes.  “Or what was.  It’s not her anymore.”  Dean turned his gaze to his father, sad eyes head droping into the back of the couch.
“You may begin.”  Cas tells him and Coy flashes a brilliant smile as he reaches for his first white pawn, a small soldier man with a shield, on the far right side of the board.  He shifts him two spaces up.
“Okay you’re getting payback for that one, kid!”  Dean tossed his laptop to the side and jumped up to pursue Charlie who was squealing with laughter from down the bunker corridor.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Love you, boy.  Thank you.”  John hung up after that, not sure if he could talk anymore without blubbing.  Mary’s face was still so peaceful and beautiful, he wished she were awake to offer him comfort and calm him down like she always did.
“It’s not just that, Mr. Winchester.  They’re saying out in L.A. there was a guy who took tons of bullets and didn’t stop.  Just kept coming until they finally got him in the head.”  Now John had to admit
“Are you okay with it?”  He asks, knowing how difficult Cas’s transition to being human had gone last time.  Cas nodded and gave a small smile.
“What?  I said I’d changed my mind.”  Dean told him as he kneels on the ground to give the dog plenty of scritches and nuzzled into his neck.  The crowd around them slowly settles down and just as people start asking about what actually happened Eileen, bless her soul, intervenes.
“I want a funeral.  But I want it before I’m gone.  After I’m gone I don’t care what you do, but I want this.”  John gave a weak smile, nodded, and set to work planning.  “But let’s call it a Death Party.”  She said with a mischievous smirk.  He texted two people he trusted to get this done right, Jess and Cas.  Then he texted Cas to contact the one person he knew could keep them all laughing through the tears, Cas’ brother Gabriel who had strangely grown on him over the past year.
The man on the left side of the room says in confused anger.
Lucille Evelyn Winchester was born on December 17th, 2009, with ten tiny perfect fingers and ten tiny perfect toes.  A new sense of warmth blossomed in John’s chest when he held the little girl for the first time.  She had Jess’ blonde hair and Sam’s hazel eyes.  She looked at you like she could read your mind.
“Don’t start singing Shania now you corny idiot.”  She pulled back and he wiped her tears away and pressed gentle kisses all over her face.  “I love you, John.  More than life itself.  Thank you for taking care of me.”
By the time he was done the sun was casting a dim orange glow into the backyard.  He dejectedly decided to stay in the house one more night, but it was difficult.  The quiet of it screamed at him.  He moved the impala into the garage and messed with the engine just enough so no one would take her, she wasn’t practical moving forward in these uncertain times, but maybe one day he could come back for her.  He buried the keys in an old jewelry box at the head of his son’s grave, and he put the Zepp tape back into the box in the back seat.  Sometime during the afternoon’s events the power had quit, so John packed what he could of the non perishables, and a few things that would last for at least the next few days of the produce, into the truck.  The road ahead of him was long and he didn’t sleep much on that final night in his home.
“Yeah, yeah.”  John said and heard the other line click.  That was the first weird thing that day.  The next was the nurse, who was normally perfectly on time being ten minutes late.
“This is the real world now, John.  No more monsters that go bump in the night, besides horrible humans.  I’m alive, our sons are safe, your dad never ran off.  Though we are getting older now.  Can’t help that much.”
“How did we get here?”  Dean asks him, stepping closer to Castiel.  Cas shakes his head and shrugs.
.  He could tell her, he’d told her practically everything by this point, so he could give her this too.  Share the weight a bit and maybe it would be a bit less heavy.
“He means, we’re gonna go get you all the necessities.”  Sam clarified, coming up beside him and pulling on his coat.  “Can’t wear the same suit and tie everyday anymore.” Sam smiled at him comfortingly and the ex-angel returned the sentiment.  They opened the doors to the impala just as Dean was revving the engine.
“Answer the damn question freak!”  Dean yells and Coy holds up his hands in defense.
“Thank you Dean.  I will make the arrangements.”  Dean and Sam both give him puzzled looks.
Or he could tell her the truth… But that just didn’t seem possible.  He would sound crazy.  Talking about a life lived without her.  Seeking vengeance for her, raising the boys on the road… and as a side effect, being a shit father.  He sighed and she raised her eyebrows at him.  John might tell her one day but for now.
couldn’t stand to be separated from your angel.  Pathetic.”
“He never had a song called Thriller, what are you going on about?”  John took a moment to let that information sink in and wondered how he had missed that before.
“Humans!  See, this is why I never wanted to keep your lot.  You just have these heaps and heaps of… audacity.  What makes you think you can invalidate my deal?  I could use another good laugh before going back to sleep.”  The Empty leaned forward slightly, as if waiting for the punchline to some great joke.  How could Dean, this simple human, have some unknown power over the Empty?  But Dean had come prepared, not with weapons, or spells, or sneaky plans, but with facts of ancient rituals.  Things that might not have held much gusto between two humans, but because Cas
“Yes Ma'am.”  The boys responded in unison as they rounded the corner. They both froze as he stared at them over the back of the couch.  John stood up slowly, still unsure of his leg strength.
Mary didn’t respond, but he hadn’t expected her to.  Still he picked up her limp hand and held it in his, bringing it up to his lips for a quick kiss.
“Happy Anniversary.”  Dean said in the most sardonic tone he could manage.
“Amazon.”  Cas finally replied, then they laughed some more.  An hour later they stopped for burgers, both feeling that they had never been this content in their whole lives.
“I don’t wanna leave you, John.  I know I should want to stay to see Lucy grow up, or to see Dean and Cas have kids, but I wanna be selfish.  I don’t want to leave you.”  John sighed, his breathing hitched.
By the time noon had rolled around and passed, he knew something was seriously going wonky.  His entire body was tingling like there was something in the air though he mainly sat next to Mary reading quietly so he could hear if she woke up.  At 2:30 he received a call from Sam that made his stomach drop.
“I could approximate.  May maybe? Of 2007.”  Mary nodded, no longer shocked or weirded out, or anything John might have guessed.  Just accepting.
.  He’d wasted his whole life for this one thing, and his son had been the one to end it all.  To end the cycle.  He’d put his hand on Dean’s shoulder, looked over and gave Sam a small nod.  It was over.  He felt himself losing connection with the material plane, expecting his soul to finally move on to whatever came next.  But something felt off.  He glitched out of existence like a ghost, gold sparking around him.  It felt fast and slow.  There was nothing to see, feel, hear, smell, or taste.  He was nothingness hurtling towards the unknown.  Or he was completely frozen for the rest of eternity.
“Were we good?”
The air smells like static electricity at first, the hairs on his arms all standing at attention.  Dean holds his breath, afraid to open his eyes only to realize that he never closed them.  Blackness settles around him like a shroud, pressing, heavy, and feeling so sleepy.  Something is whispering at the back of his mind, pressing into his consciousness, it’s time to sleep.  A sensation both comforting and threatening with it’s command.  Obviously that’s not going to happen, he came here with one singular purpose in mind, and he’s not leaving or falling asleep until he gets that.
John felt himself losing connection with the world around him.  Everyone was staring at him, at
“Anyway, your mom sounds like she reacted exactly how I expected her too after all the stories you’ve told me about her.  She really loved you.”  Charlie says kindly and nudges Dean with her elbow.  “What about your dad?”  Dean sighed, knowing this was Charlie cashing in a chip to something Dean avoided as part of their friend therapy relying on mutual vulnerability.  John Winchester was a ghost Dean liked imagining only in his past.
“Do you ever…”  Cassie started hesitantly and looked up at him, biting her lip.  She let out a puff of air.  “Dean, you survived.  Do you ever think-”

“Anima et anima, tenet vinculum profunde increduli omnes sentimus. Dividimus muros eius et convertam ligat omnes aditus aperietur. Quod præceptum est ei.”  The air holds tight with crackling energy just before it snaps.  A crack echoes around Dean as a purple glowing streak appears before him.  It’s perfectly straight and seems to vibrate his eyeballs just looking at it, even though it’s holding perfectly still.  Like a strip club neon light, suspended by nothing. It held all the hope and dread that had been broiling in Dean’s gut since… well just since.  He stands up, pulls his shoulders back, he won’t go quietly into this dark void.
“That was reckless.”
“Is that something you learned in your Monster Dreams?”
“Uh… Guys?”  Jo called to Dean and Charlie, pointing toward the blockade out of the rotunda and into the amusement park.  “We didn’t set that up, right?”  She asked then pulled back to hack into the skull of another bozo approaching her.
of all things fascinate you Cas?”  Dean chirps in, and a blue gaze raises to meet him.  A sad rumination crosses his face for a moment before it flits away.
“What the hell Dean!  You scared the shit outta me!”  Sam complained, tucking his gun back in his waistband.  Dean didn’t answer. He was making this dry wheezing sound in between actual laughs and his face was bright red.  Dean opened his eyes to take in Sam’s aghast face and only laughed harder, water leaking out of his eyes. Sam grew annoyed.  “Dude, what is it!” Dean released one of his hands from holding his stomach to point in the corner where the toilet was. Sam turned and there… was the most ridiculous and annoying sight.
“I missed you.  I missed this beautiful face.  God, do I love you Mary.”  She laughed a little at him, and put her hand on his face.  He leaned into it, then turned and kissed her palm.  She rubbed her thumb under his eye, soothing away the tear tracks.

“Because you’re the best fighter, and the smartest one about tactical advantage.”  Charlie said with an eye roll like it was totally obvious.  “Both Bobby and Ellen trust you with their lives.  Hell Dean, this entire camp does.  Your opinion means something.”  Dean wanted to scoff at that but he couldn’t, as much as he liked being trusted he couldn’t help the part of him that said everyone was making a giant mistake about that.  He hadn’t been able to keep his brother or best friend safe, and who was this group by comparison?
“You mean to tell me, that I can find something I desire on this website and have it sent to our home by
“My family includes all of you… so if the shoe fits.”  Cas gave another shrug with a pointed look at Bobby.  Everyone burst out laughing again at the shocked look on Bobby’s face, Dean especially coming over to kiss his husband’s cheek.
“I hope you know how proud of you I am. Cause I am… proud of you.”  John’s eyes shifted to Dean, who was listening carefully.  “Both of you.”  He put a hand on each of their shoulders and watched in awe as each of his sons, both now men through and through, smiled with an inner pride that he had just given them.  Then they met each other's eyes and something much more frightening passed between them.
“How could I forget!  He used my favorite… lotion as the raft for Jack and Rose duck.  It got so much water in it, I couldn’t use it anymore!”
“Dean, you’ll have to bring Ca-”  Mary started but Dean flushed and interrupted her.
“Uhh… I know how to fix a car.  But all this paperwork and stuff?  I had no idea we even ran a business together.  I’m guessing we’re partners?”  Bobby nodded, and John let out a low whistle. “We disagreed on a lot of things in my dream, mainly my parenting style.  I used to dump the boys off on you, then run off to fight some evil fucker.  It’s hard to imagine us working together well enough to own a business honestly.”  Bobby laughed, a grumbly sort of sarcastic thing at that.
Dean raised an eyebrow at him. “Careful,” he laughed, “you’re gonna get yourself arrested if you go on like that.”
Alastair looked at her, nonplussed. “M-hm. Let me guess. Something a little cold. More souls to torture…” he sighed with the barest hint of a smile.
It was darker here than it had been in the canyon or on the plains. Around and to every side stood tall trees with their branches reaching upward; but the entire forest was soundless. When Dean pressed a hand to the nearest tree he realized it was dead wood, and had been for some time. Every tree was leafless; and Hell's continual chill felt sharper. The air was thick with the tang of salt, and it made Dean jumpy. "Is this a forest or an ocean?" he muttered.
Cas thought for a moment. “You could hang out with me. We could play Battleship.”
“I think he’s ours,” said Dean, looking down at the child.
with a was-ness that seemed to warn Dean not to get too comfortable.
“Oh my god,” says Sam.
“Yeah,” said Sam. “I uh… I prayed to Jack,” he said, not meeting Dean’s eyes.

It was a pretty boring pastime.
“God, Cas, I’m glad you called. Something’s wrong—”
“Yes,” Cas said, “and the questions about what Uriel’s up to. It has Anna and I so worried we almost bugged his office yesterday,” he admitted.
“Don’t be such a drama queen, Dean. I’m not leaving you. Get up and get dressed.”
“Dean, are you okay?” he asked.
"Yeah, no."
“You know,” Balthazar said, breaking the silence. “What you were saying earlier, I guess it makes sense. I mean, this job kinda sucks for all of us. But it does make a living. An’ I mean—you’re doing it for your family, right? Guess I can respect that.”
WHERE IS DEAN WINCHESTER'S SOUL
! I’m impressed!”
Cas snapped his fingers, and the lights went out.
“You know me,” Cas said, kissing Dean on the cheek, “I’m always careful. Well…” he amended, looking a little guilty.
“That,” Cas said, “and, if my information is true,” he added quietly, “he has ties to a political up-and-comer. For all we know he has the station under his thumb.”
“I can’t,” Dean said.
Right, Dean realized. This was a human party, full of people who were trigger-happy around angels at best. Cas might be able to join in, but why would he feel welcome?
Dean leaned back, shrugged uneasily. “I’m not—that. Just a blunt little instrument. I don’t fit here, you
“It is,” says Cas. “Thank you Dean.”
“Aww,” Lilith said. “It’s a right love story between you too,” she said cheerily, clapping her hands together. “It’s sickening.”

Nothing. Alastair had reached away. Dean bit his lip. "Come on, come on, come on…"
Dean regarded Cas. “Yeah,” he said at last. “But I—I don’t know what to do about it… I just wish it weren’t so quiet around here. I wish we had more time together to build something.” He shrugged, “I don’t know, maybe start a family or—”
Of course, the truth was, this was only appearances. It wasn’t the nonexistent body he was aiming for, but the soul. Still, when the swarm of fire-ants started to spill over the side, crawling closer and closer to her feet, he was pretty proud of the picture. If she tried very hard, pulling herself up by her core, she could free her feet from their brush against the floor, so that they couldn’t touch her; and she knew it, too. The strain of sweat broke out over her forehead and collarbone, traced the roundness of her breasts, the backs of her knees. Her wrists, holding most of her weight, were bruised purple and the metal around them cut deep into her arms as she tried to hold herself up. Droplets of blood collecting at the razor-sharp edges. Her jaw was clenched, her gaze still burning into his own. “Kill you,” she muttered, quietly. “I will… I promise…”
“It doesn’t matter. You think these guys know how to dance either?”
Cas found himself smiling. “Yes.”
“This should do it,” Anna said, looking at her handiwork and putting the phone back in its cradle. “If they say anything in this room, I should be able to hear it.”
He left it there, floating on the scummy water. Dark leaves limp and lifeless. Softly floating, a dead thing in a dead land.
Dean shrugged. “Sam we aren’t plumbers and we ran out of all our money yesterday, when we got gas for Baby, remember? We’ll just have to man up and deal with it.”

“Dean…”
Dean stared right back into Cas’ eyes. When at last they kissed, the world around them shimmered, fading and brightening as the world around them turned to color. When they parted, Dean watched Cas’ warm eyes open, dark lashes revealing deep, oceanic blue. “So are you,” he whispered.
She thought about Heaven. It was a territory like any other. When they won, when they tore down the pearly gates and stormed inside, they could snatch paradise from those cloud-hopping pansies.
Cas shrugged. “They don’t seem to care how unlikely it sounds. All that seems to matter is that they heard it from Uriel.”
Sam sat back beside the angel, hand still holding Dean’s own, and Dean crawled in with them, until they were pressed up as close as they could be on the seat, swinging the door closed after them.
Her lapdog-of-the-day cowered forward, eyes downcast. “Yes, mistress?”
“Yeah, nice,” says Dean, glowering.
In the hall, Uriel was talking to someone. “No one suspects anything,” he said smoothly.
“If you touch him, I’ll tear you limb from limb,” Alastair said boredly.
Cas stared at it, his pen poised above the dotted line. The words bored into him. How can I sign this, he thought.
And every so often, leaning against the scoured wood, Dean fell asleep.
“Huh,” Jack said. “I never thought about that.”
, when his vacuum hit something under a chair. He turned it off and crouched on the floor, peered under the chair to see what the problem was.
“I can’t
But without Dean. Fuck it all.
Dean just knew what Chuck was going to say. “Sorry boys, it’s too late…” and he’d leave them on this empty planet with a long, slow death from starvation; this world, the last world in the universe, burnt out. Back into The Darkness it came from.
Dean stared at them. Then at Cas. Then back at the officers. “
“Not so fast,” it said, with a giggle, and slit his throat.
Cas thought for a moment. “Look, maybe this… isn’t a bad thing, Dean. I mean, haven’t you ever dreamed of starting a family together?”
It was a Sunday morning. Dean was making pancakes, and the family was just finishing up breakfast when the doorbell rang.
“Not particularly enjoyable,” Cas said. “It’s still weighing on me.”
Dean tugged him out into the group and Cas followed, looking doubtful but interested. As the music played, Dean stepped forward, pulled Cas’ arm up and around him, and laughed when Cas just stood there, staring at him in confusion. “Dude, to dance you have to actually move.”
Sam reached into his jacket, pulled out a knife, and Dean nodded, taking a blade from the holster at his ankle. The air was warm and still; safe. He grinned. His own blade pressed to Sam’s chest and feeling an answering coldness against his shirt. “On three?”
, she reminded herself, but she couldn't. Something about the voice compelled her to look up.
“I have to,” Cas said.
The sapling perked up. Their leaves fluffed, their stem quivered. "Would you? Friend, thank you, thank you, I'll put in a good word for you upstairs when I get there, I'll tell everyone what you did—"
A chill went through her then, and she held the angel blade closer to her, staring at the afterimage the burning one had left in its wake.
"It seemed to fit," Dean said with a shrug. Their dance had slowed a bit, and Dean pressed a soft, flirtatious kiss to the corner of Alastair's mouth. "We planning on just dancing, or what?"
“What’s so special about him?” Dean asked. “Just ‘cause he’s some big businessman—”
Dean rolled into a sitting position, reached around for his clothes and sighed, realizing he’d have to get out of bed to find them. But he was dressed soon enough and without any fuss. “Where are we going?”
, just that he did. As though he were playing Marco Polo with the universe, searching for echoes, for the precise feel of Castiel. And then he stumbled over something, and his eyes flew open.
“You mean the one you won’t be around for?”
Dean knew when the seraph was close because of the brightness through the trees, casting the ghost forest in a false-dawn. The black shadows of the trees were long and sharp-edged, and the sigils in the circular palisade flared to glowing life.
“Are you
“Don’t,” Dean snapped. He slammed the door open, marching out of the dungeon. He hated the sight of that place—he never wanted to set foot in there again.
“So,” Dean said, “lemme get this straight. You asked our friend, who’s an operator, to spy on your boss’s phone calls?”
“Then I guess we’re back to square one.” Today, square one was a box with a twist lid. He set it by her feet, watching her look toward it in curiosity, apprehension.
“I’m gonna be late for work,” Cas said at last, pulling away.
“Belphagor’s a bad influence!” he announced.
that!”
“I know I said that,” Alastair replied shortly.
The slowly spinning disc of the platform beneath her that hovered between the endless crisscrossed rows of meathooks came to a rest, and Dean looked toward the edge, standing to attention as Alastair stepped out of a glowing, door-edged outline which faded away behind him again. Alastair looked over the scene cursorily. “Feeling a bit hands-off today?”
. Dean wasn’t afraid. The idiot.
“Well of
Nanghait sighed heavily and eyed the altar as though itching to rake his claws through it. "What do you want."
Dean stared at Cas helplessly. This wasn’t supposed to happen. They were ordinary people. They hadn’t done anything wrong. And now here they were in jail, and the police had no intention of letting them go, Dean thought, staring down at his handcuffed wrists.
"It's got good acoustics, though," Alastair said. He started singing a jazzy song: "those cool and limpid green eyes—" he looked into Dean's as he sang, "a pool wherein my love lies. So deep that in my searching for happiness I fear… that they will ever haunt me, all through my life they'll taunt me. But will they ever want me?" He held out one hand and dragged Dean into a dance, their shoes slipping and sliding on the metal ground. Every sound rang out from the mountainside, echoing back to Dean with clear and magnified precision, without the overlapping distortion that he would have expected. "Careful, son," Alastair warned. "You don't want to slip."
Dean rushed through the kitchen where Jack was putting two pieces of bread on a plate with a sad-looking slice of cheese in between them. It was an invention of his that he’d informed his fathers was called the Cheese on Toast sandwich, despite Cas’ argument that bread was not toast unless you toasted it.
"O-kay," Dean said. "So. You tried to start the Apocalypse and then chickened out."
“Just stand in the right place when I tell you to. The incantation should handle the rest.”
Dean felt his steps falter for a moment. Like a flash, the memory of a soft weight in his hands. Trusting brown eyes looking up at him from a small face. He'd bounced the kid up and down, up and down.
Then he discovered the bunkers’ toilets were broken. All of them.
The grapefruit didn’t answer.
Cas looked shifty for a minute.
That's what she was thinking of when she made her newest altar; a few hearts, some priceless cursed objects; her own blood shaped into a swooping Z. She'd made a smaller pendant in the same shape and filled it with her blood too, it hung around her neck, a way to take the altar with her on her travels. "Demon of darkness, of abandonment and peril, patron of all who can never return home, I summon you now."
"I know," Dean said. "I know, I know you do. I'm yours."
“Dean—” Cas said, urgently, “it’s not going to work. The Empty is pulling me back—we made a deal. It’s not going to let go.”
Zachariah, pale and lifeless, floating like a piece of driftwood to the shore.
But something was different this time.
“No,” Dean said. “You didn’t tell me about this.”
“Oh, no doubt about it,” Alastair said bitterly. “Now go.”
“How is two guys having sex comforting?” asks Sam.
Sam did some laundry. He made breakfast. It was a very fine morning.
“So do you,” says Cas. “Do you want some help with that?”
, he thought.
"Yeah, for obvious reasons," Dean said, crossing his arms. He felt afraid of moving, like if he stepped wrong he'd get stuck inside the pull of a salt barrier and become another standing thing that couldn't escape, like these skeleton trees.
Dean smiled, and god it hurt; it hurt and he could feel the tears gathering at his eyes, but he smiled. “Fuck yes.” And somehow Sam was smiling too, and then Cas, looking deeply at both of them, nodded in agreement.
He signed.
Dean heard a voice loudly say, “enough chitchat, is he coming, or not?”
“I’ll kill Sam, he’ll kill me, we’ll kill each other,” Dean said, as cocky as he could manage, “but you gotta bring them back. The people, the birds… and Cas. You gotta bring Cas back.”
•I imagine that Dean's thinking about Star Trek (specifically The Wrath of Khan) at the line "How do you like that no-win scenario?"
There was no time like the present. Uriel and everyone else was out of the office, since it was the weekend. Cas and Anna walked to Sandover, and when they got there, Cas got his key from his pocket, turning it in the lock. “Okay,” he said. “We’re in.”
Uriel looked away from the device, scanning the room and every face in it. Cas swallowed hard, hoping he did not look suspicious. In fact, he was the only one in the entire room who
*was that a typo?*
"Well, He's real." Alastair looked down. "I was setting up the break-out. Me and Lilith, we have contact with a couple angels. You really think they could get down to Hell
When Cas walked into the kitchen Dean was leaning against the counter, drinking a fresh cup of coffee.
Uriel laughed wryly. “Is the Essential Venue for Integrated Labefaction understaffed?”
“On suspicion of murder.”
Dean sputtered, before shooting back a mocking, singsong “
Once, Dean dreamed of the angel.
) "9 I looked, and there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one beside each cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like gleaming beryl. 10 And as for their appearance, the four looked alike, something like a wheel within a wheel. 11 When they moved, they moved in any of the four directions without veering as they moved; but in whatever direction the front wheel faced, the others followed without veering as they moved. 12 Their entire body, their rims, their spokes, their wings, and the wheels—the wheels of the four of them—were full of eyes all around. 13 As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing "the wheelwork." 14 Each one had four faces: the first face was that of the cherub, the second face was that of a human being, the third that of a lion, and the fourth that of an eagle. ... 21 Each had four faces, each four wings, and underneath their wings something like human hands."
“What?” Dean exclaimed. “He choked on a burger!”
"Try what? I'm already dancing," Dean grumbled, just for show. Alastair didn't press. For a moment, their steps rang out, one after another as though in single file, before Dean picked up the song. "Well, green eyes with their soft lights, your eyes that promise sweet nights, bring to my soul a longing, a thirst for love… infernal." he grinned. "In dreams I seem to hold you, to find you and enfold you, our lips meet and our hearts, too, with a thrill so eternal."
“Dean, I promise, you’re not in trouble,” Alastair said, and Dean let out a shaking breath.
The angels want to win, we want to win; well, to do that you need a war. Just so happens we've got one. It's called Revelation."
Hell’s a piece of shit.” His off-handed tone was belied by the way his gaze kept being dragged to the window. The green, bright aspect of his soul, not entirely corrupted yet, rose in his eyes, reflected the glow of the distant light. Even from this remove, Alastair noticed the trace of awe that couldn’t be buried, in response to
been a while since we’ve had time to ourselves,” he admitted.
Rowena looked surprised for a moment, but then nodded. “Well, you are a talented witch. It might at least give Dean another minute or two.”
“Still,” said Cas, shrugging, “it would be much easier if he were older.”
One arm pressed against the back of his neck so Dean couldn’t move, Alastair scraped the other down his back. Red furrows. Every so often, a hint of nails deep enough to cut the skin. The breathy exhale it gathered him. The murmurs of pleasepleaseyesjustlikethat. “You’re mine, little girl. You’re never gonna forget that are you.”
"Don't," they pleaded. "Don't. Please, I'll help you, I'll do anything—please—I thought you were my friend—"
,” he said. “To insinuate such a thing. And here you seemed like such a stand-up fellow.”
Bela looked away, but not fast enough. A deep blue eye the size of a truck latched onto her, stared into her with a prickle of force, like a spike; it became hard to breathe. She curled into herself.
• the idea of the suicide tree comes from Dante's Inferno,
“What’s wrong?” Dean asked.
“But the blood…” Cas insisted.
This place was no ghost forest. It didn't hold any haunted spirits because it had never been living to start with. It just was, it was and
. As Cas moved Battleship to the kitchen so he and his husband could continue to play without inconveniencing the children, Dean raised an eyebrow at the screen, where actors were being bombarded by bored-looking frogs that hit them awkwardly, as if being tossed by a camera crew taking shots at the leads.
(Ezekiel
He sat up, the covers pooling about his waist, and Dean whined at the loss of contact as he pulled his hand away, giving him a glare. Dean half-sat, pulled at his hand, trying to get Alastair to touch him again. “What are you getting out of bed for? I thought you said you had all day.”

Yeah, okay, there were a lot of angels in Hell right now, Meg knew that; but they were fighting in the torture chambers. From what she'd heard it had turned into a rout—seemed they hadn't found what they were looking for and then their leader had ditched on them.
“No,” Cas said. And then again, louder; like repeating it would make anything different, like he was creating a new word out of anguish. “
"It's not exactly—" Dean hit a rock with his shoe and it went bouncing, skittering down to its sad pebble death. He leaned closer to the canyon wall, both hands against it with a white-knuckled grip. "It's not exactly a good hiding place, even with spellwork, I gotta say."
“Dean, calm down—”
They pressed home.
“Here, just follow my lead,” Dean explained. “If I turn you in this direction, you’ll follow that, see?”
“Dean,” Cas said, “please come.”
Alastair glanced back at him steadily. Dean fell silent, shocked. “You are.” He glanced over his shoulder again, in the direction the angels had been coming from. “You really think they’ll make it back here?”
"I hoped I wouldn't have to use it quite yet," Alastair said as he stepped over the threshold. The sigils, Dean noticed, were glowing an eerie blue, reacting to the nearing presence of the angel; and there were more than there had been before; a few were still fresh. They tingled like novocaine when he stepped into their scope. Alastair held out a hand, and Dean took it—and then, with a pop of displaced air, they were being rocketed through a sieve, smushed flat and opened back up again. Dean didn't know whether it reminded him more of apparition from Harry Potter (yeah, he'd read the books, just to see what all the fuss was about—but no one, dead or alive, could pry
“Hmm,” Dean said. “Okay, noted.” They walked over to the bed. “Lucky for us, any pizza you make will be hot,” Dean said.
Dean hadn’t really gotten it, but it had been nice to know Cas liked the movie too, that it had meant something to him.

by kayliemalinza. It's an utterly *brilliant* Dean/Alastair oneshot that also happens to be the most convincing character study of Dean in hell I've ever read, as to how Dean exactly would've stood out so much in his methods of torture that even in season 15 demons were still talking about it.

that was now just purpose, whittled down to a fine, sharp point. Seemed like he got nasty when he couldn’t play with his toys anymore.
“A chance for what?” Jack asked.
“Yeah, well,
Dean glowered at him halfheartedly. “What am I supposed to do then?” he said.
Dean looked at him. “Why not?”
For a moment, Chuck just stared at them. Harsh, unyielding, like a vast desert. There was nothing in his eyes, not a bit, and it almost surprised him. ‘Cause he could remember when the entity was different. Still a dick, yeah, but there had been
Alastair stood up, paced over to the cave's entrance and looked out into the deep sky. "But I didn't account for how much I wanted to keep you. You've gotta understand, I don't give a shit about Earth, I never have. But I hate Lilith. All of a sudden, it just didn't seem worth it."
, he’d said,
JUSTICE URGED ON MY HIGH ARTIFICER;
And the scene glitched, leaving no evidence of concerning miracles. Instead, Dean and Cas had made it off the couch. “I really need to go,” Cas said, as they parted from a kiss.
, Alastair thought.
“I’m just saying, if you consider his perspective… I’m not saying you
“Sick days,” Cas reminded him seriously. “I’m not sick.”
He spent himself with a shudder, and pulled out from his protege’s raw, twitching hole. Pulled up Dean’s pants and did the zip while Dean was still shuddering, bent over the sill. The trickle of his come, sliding down Dean’s thighs mixing with blood. Tonight, he didn’t want anything else but that.
“Yeah, like killing each other is already so easy,” Sam said; there was terror, and something like a deep resignation; still, he put his solid weight behind Dean until there they were, all three of them, facing the unfaceable, together. “You’re a sadist; an evil, spineless coward. Just like Lucifer.”
“What the—?” Dean said. He made a face as he fished around gingerly to grab what had scraped his palm, lifting it from the sink. “A freaking pineapple?” Dean stared at it. “Now that’s just wrong,” he said. He shook the suds from his hands, went to the kitchen counter where he’d moved the fruit bowl, and stuck the fruit in it with purpose. Then he looked at the three chairs set to one side, collapsing into one of them and putting his head in his hands. “Is this what it’s gonna be like,” Dean said, looking around the kitchen helplessly. He wasn’t sure what he meant by that. Being alone? Staying in the house all day, just waiting until Cas came back from wherever he’d gone off to—work. Somehow Dean always ended up being the one waiting for Cas, didn’t he? Wondering if this time Cas wouldn’t return.
“Grab me another baby, would you? I’m parched.”
Dean wasn’t supposed to wonder. It wasn’t his job. Still, as they walked down the steps in total blackness, steps so steep you could barely get a foot onto it, so steep that with a push he’d go tumbling down to the bottom—not that Alastair would push him. Probably. Well, he found himself wondering about a lot of things. Free time in Hell—there was nothing worse. Dean waited for his eyes to adjust to the darkness, but the darkness remained so complete that there was nothing to be seen. It was cold, with still air that smelled of stone and the slime-green river. His hands, where they pressed against the wall on either side, were burning, almost numbed. There was an ache in his calves to add to the pain between his legs. He kept going. Alastair hadn’t yet said to stop.
Cas shrugged. “They have a pleasing combination of molecules.”
The conspirators looked around surreptitiously, even though they were alone. Then they hurried out of the room, and spent the next forty minutes re-locking the door.

Cas sighed. “You’re my one phone call,” he explained.
“A chance with him for what?” Jack asked.
•What angels look like:
Dean sighed and grabbed it, then left the room, papaya in one hand, grapefruit in the other, and went downstairs to put the fruit into its bowl.
WHERE IS HE
"You're assuming right. There was a reason I let you climb all the way up here before following you. I put a few more spells in place."
No, Cas couldn’t think like that. Besides, last time Dean had shown up right next to him, it made sense that the same thing would happen again. At least, that’s what he kept telling himself as the minutes ticked by, still with no sight of Dean or his adversary.
Dean sighed. “It’s open,” he called, turning his back to the door. Just because he had to face the situation didn’t mean he had to literally
The following months only saw the brothers getting closer, the only rocky moments when Sam tried to insist on Dean opening up about why he couldn’t tell Dad where he was even though he had finally returned Sam’s call and inquired more about Dean.
“Just give me another minute,” Sam said. “Just… if this is a stupid prank I want to just pretend for one more minute.”
"What?" Cas spluttered. "We're not dating!" He could feel his face heating up.
Dean felt Cas shrug his shoulders. “Why couldn’t it be?”
“Then leave!” Dean shouted. “See if I care.”
“Yeah, yeah, I’ll clean it up. Now be quiet, Andy is talking about how she smacked that sexist buttface Troy.”
Dean let their chatter blend into that of the other volunteers and police as he stared into the woods. They looked so peaceful, so beautiful. Dean could hardly believe that they held such a horrible, dark, and ominous secret between their sun-kissed leaves.
“I never meant to imply that you were,” Cas told him, placing a gentle hand atop Dean’s.
“Fine,” Cas huffed. “But only because you already have one thing to make up to me tonight. I wouldn’t want you to think that you can start doubling up make up sex nights.”
Castiel glared at him.
“So, prom, huh?” Cas asked, much later that night, cuddled with Dean on his bed.
“I didn’t try to blind you,” Cas said, shrinking in on himself. “I told you, I—‘
“Because, I mean, I get it. I don’t want to hunt anymore either, but dad has never tried to get me to go back. I mean, yeah, I have to deal with the disappointment and occasional yelling over stupid shit, but he only calls in like once every three months.”
Dean’s jaw dropped, but he quickly recovered with a resounding, “Hell yes!”
“It’s okay,” Cas said quickly, probably suspecting another panic attack was coming. “You don’t have to talk about it.”
Dean cleared his throat uncomfortably. “Maybe.”
“Don’t you think you’ll get tired of all of these firsts?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean said. “I’ll look over the applications, okay? But if I don’t like anyone, then I’m not hiring them.”
like that? Sam was too mortified to think about it.)
“Dean,” Cas answered, panic flashing across his face before he steeled himself and turned around. “Hello. Happy Valentine’s Day.” He tried for a smile, but it felt too forced so he let it drop.
, he wanted to repeat again but thought it might come off a little too offensive. Dean didn’t know what to think.  Was star really so much weirder than alien? He debated for a moment before deciding that, honestly, it kind of was.
“Uh, talking?” Dean said like it was obvious. “We are friends, you know.”
“I wouldn’t be so sure about that, Cas,” Dean told him. “You don’t know my dad like I do.”
“I’m not an idiot, Cas,” Dean said.
She looked down at her hands. “Must’ve dropped it,” she said and then her face drained of color. “Shit!”
“Stop it, both of you. This is not helping the situation at hand.” He stared both of them down in turn until they both relented. Then he turned to Dean and sank down onto the bed next to him. “Will you be alright if I go downstairs?”
“I’m not asking you to be,” Cas assured him. “I just… Wasn’t sure if I was a secret or not.”
“Dean—“
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean said, breaking away from Cas to walk into the house. “At least you got out of doing the dishes for a while.”
“Like I was a Monster Hunter and lots of other crazy shit okay.”  The boys blinked at him, and as expected Dean cracked first.  Laughing loudly and leaning back on the couch.
“Something tells me that is a seriously abridged version of events.”  That made John chuckle darkly.
she had even put the things there, or bought the ottoman to hide them in.
“You’re supposed to let the person who made it for you tie it on, and you can’t take it off until it falls off.”  Dean tells her, a free finger going to his own wrist and tracing it lightly.
died.  Weak people.
Charlie could often get more out of him than just nerdy things.  He would tell her about the parts of him and his past that still ripped him open, and she would tell him hers.  It was a trade in vulnerability, so that they both always had ammunition they would never use.  Charlie was like a little sister to him, and her girlfriend Jo.  Though where Charlie was all bubbly smarts, Jo was all deadly information.  They were a perfect pair.  But Jo was a little harsher with her caring towards Dean, she got that from her mother, and by association neither were included in the super secret Dean and Charlie talks.
“A bit of both.”  Coy admits, shifting his face slightly closer to hers, hot breath mixing between them.  With a concerted effort Erata pulls away off Coy’s lap and onto the free space next to him.
“Alright fine, you idjit.  Call me if you do though.”
“And I think I will keep the deodorizer in my room, so that I may put it on before I get dressed.”
.  I intend to close that loophole and keep you here permanently.”  The Empty steepled its fingers together, watching Dean like he would make a good meal, Dean swallowed thickly.
“Why would you say that?”  Dean looks up at Cas over the roof of the Impala and just shrugs.
It was a quick chase that ended with Charlie getting a serious nougie on the couch in the media room.
“You read my mind.” So together they made their way, John plopped on the couch first then pulled Mary in his lap sideways.  She squeaked a little surprised at the action but then just laughed.
Face up, stance ready, kill these fucking bozos.  He can feel the strain of his arms, all the repeated motions of stabbing, slicing, yanking, kicking, are starting to take a toll on his muscles.  The adrenaline is starting to ebb the longer this goes, his limbs going shaky.  He isn’t surprised when his next swing goes wide and cuts into the bozos shoulder, just disappointed.  Especially when the thing’s shoulder gushes, the skin and muscle slides in a gross wet sound as the thing frees itself and topples Dean to the ground.  He cries out as his leg hits bad and he knows at the least he’s just sprained it.  He’s got his hands pressed into the things chest as its teeth in a lipless mouth snap in his face.  Disgusting smells and textures all around him, the bozo’s entire weight pressing him down and not allowing him to get leverage.  He has no idea where his blade is but he can hear Charlie calling out to him, he turns his face to the side still holding back the disgusting thing as he tries to spot his weapon.
In Hell, you get hurt, you die, you wake up again. You stop changing, but you can change the world around you, if you’re inventive enough, putting up little illusions. In Purgatory, you fight, you get hurt, you die (maybe)… but if you don’t die, you find yourself back at full health again. You don’t eat, you don’t sleep, and the world just keeps on changing around the central points: the rivers, certain mountainous slopes. In Heaven there’s the road. Every place has its center, its ways of getting around. Sometimes you just had to point yourself in the right direction.
The power of the voice shook her, and Bela dropped her knife, scrambling backward and almost falling off the spinning platform under the soul. She looked, with nauseous interest, at the dappled gleam of her blade growing smaller and smaller a speck as it fell into the endless well, and her hands grabbed on the grating of the platform for purchase.

Good riddance to the kid anyway. He'd never see him again. It didn't matter.

“Call me again if you ever want to come back,” the ferryman said, as Dean and Alastair climbed out into shallow water and waded toward land. “If you’re out of money,” he added, “I’ll always take a sweet soul like you as payment,” he said, and winked at Dean. Then he pushed off again, and was soon punting his way through the water again, pulled along quick as a silver fish.
“You don’t have to worry about that,” Cas said, with a mischievous little grin. “I’ll top your pizza.”
, did you?” Chuck said disaffectedly, with a little shrug.
“You know how many souls people sell you when you work in telemarketing?” Jake says. “It’s a lot.”
“Hey—” she said. Winchester turned to look back.
“He’s a good protege,” Alastair admitted, after a moment. He paused. “The best.”
They were going to grab him, raise him, use him like a cheap whore and kill him. Maybe his soul would go to Heaven, too, cleansed of every impurity like he was nothing but a sword to temper by fire.
“Yeah,” Dean said. Hardly a word, so quiet, but there. “Yeah, Cas.” And something in Cas’s eyes seemed to light, and for a moment, even he smiled, and Dean felt the tears that had been building up break free, quiet, unattended to, like they were nothing.
It was billions of years from the beginning, but the humans deemed this year to be 1879.  On the far horizon to his west he could see a ship with three masts, white sails catching and billowing in the breeze, clearly passing the island just outside the barrier.  The electricity in the air dials up a notch and Castiel watches in awe as clouds begin to form.  The storm will bring the ship to the island.  This will be Castiel’s first assignment.  He will not intervene if the ship crashes, he will only intervene if the Morningstar tries to tempt one of the mortal souls.
“Oh what, you can’t remember all the rest of us ‘cause of that amnesia but you had a special clause put in for cars and grumpy old men?”  Some whiney teenage kid said as he tossed an oil stained rag over his shoulder.  John rolled his eyes at him.
“So good to see you again, Cas.”  He heard her say to the other boy.  He knew her, if she liked him she’d give him a hug, a quick glance back towards the kitchen confirmed this.  John plopped on the couch out of sight of the kitchen trying to calm down his roiling thoughts.  He wanted to be outraged, but he knew Mary would kill him if he scared their guest.  No matter what he thought of this whole situation, he needed to act like a man and not a coward.  But fucking god, his own son?
to be Cas.  He’d understand.  Course I was worried about all the biphobia crap, but I knew Cas could never be like that to me.”  Dean shook his head at his past self, even worrying about stuff like this.  Cas was the most understanding, kind, and wonderful person he’d ever met.
Guess some of them were past saving. He couldn’t undo it and he didn’t want to, that fucker had deserved every bit of it.  Thoughts of it all cemented in his brain as he wrapped the barbed wire tightly around the baseball bat.  This was him now.  He was making this choice.  He was leaving John Winchester behind him, that wouldn’t serve him again.  Not like he’d ever be able to stop thinking about his sons, or Mary, or the rest of his family… but no one else would ever get to know them.  They wouldn’t get to know him.  He rose a new man, a stronger one who turned back to the group and addressed them again.
, right?  So shouldn’t we try to treat
“That a crossbow?”
“She has a point.”  Charlie said to Dean from where she stood just behind him.
“Yeah, yeah course.”  Dean agreed, rubbing the back of his neck.  “I just-”  Dean sighed and Cas looked up to meet his eyes.  He raised a palm to Cas’s face, rubbed his thumb across his cheek bone.  Cas let out a shaky breath and closed his eyes, bringing his own hand up to cover Dean’s.  After a moment he pulled Dean’s hand into his own and twined their hands together by his side.

“We promise, mom.”  Sam told her, first to speak in the room as Jessica nodded beside him.
“You see, Cas.  He did this funny little thing.  Years ago he rescued me from Hell.  But in order to do that he had to stake a claim on my soul.  Something about the only way to bust through the nine rings with everything that still makes me
“I did try to tell you.”  Cas murmurs to Dean.
“You shouldn’t be here, Dean.”  Cas was gripping his shoulders, hands sliding up to his neck, thumbing the collar of his shirt.
“I suppose because… when I had my powers everything was so… instant.  I wanted to be in Paris and,” He snaps his fingers, “I was there. We needed something for a spell, and I was the ‘errand boy’.  I could even manifest things out of thin air if need be.” Here Cas’ gaze drifts to the side, but the brothers wait quietly for him to continue.  They watch him search to gather the right words to explain how he feels. He does this every time he wants to conceptualize just what it’s like to be
“I swear Mary, it’s not just me falling apart without you, it’s the whole damn world.”
“Hmm?” Dean could hear the scuff of his shoes as Cas walked back up into his space, but Dean couldn’t turn around.  He was suddenly very aware of the fact that Sam had left the garage a while ago now and he was still out here with Cas.  Very aware of the fact that Sam had heard him earlier when he told Cas over the phone that
“Can’t get rid of me that fast, sunshine.”  And he flashed Cas a smile, Cas just sighed at his husband.
.  Sure enough his feet had started to move of their own accord, towards the freedom of the rest of the bunker where Sam was.  Where he would be safe from these questioning feelings and what if’s that made his chest feel like combusting from pain and… something else.  Not something pleasant though, perhaps Cas was right.  He was afraid.  Dean’s shoulders slumped and his head went with them.   He doesn’t hear Cas move, he can see his shoes out of the corner of his eye, he just stands still except his hands clenching and unclenching, waiting.  So Dean turns back to him, raises his head, and he takes a step closer.
“Dad! Dad-... Jess is… Lucy.. She-”  He was hysterical and the line was filled with static.
Dean let the memory draw him in, their old group had set up camp in a set of cabin’s that were once part of a campground in the Mississippi river valley.  Dean had been growing closer with quite a few other camp members, trying to build up their overall strength, developing plans.  Cas had been going out on supply runs with Sam, and every night it felt like they were just missing each other.  But to Cas, he’d thought Dean was starting a new relationship with someone else.  Which led to Cas confronting him in Dean’s cabin, where Cas told him off for not being around much, and that Dean had never been a person to drop his friends for a relationship in the past.  Dean for his part had been appalled, defiant even, unable to respond with anything but sarcastic remarks until the truth seemed to explode out of him.
“Hmph.  Well, that’s enough of that fantasy shit.  This is the real world now John, so tell me.  Do you remember anything about how to do your
“A bunker?”  John asked incredulously.
“I.. left it at the nursing home.  With the stethoscope.  They weren’t mine.”  Then Cas squinted his eyes just a bit and took a few steps closer to Dean.  “Why do you ask?”  The deep gravel of his voice unnerved Dean.  Why
so it was easy to be around them.  Their PDA was very mild, they never kissed in front of him and only occasionally touched or held hands.  A small part of him did recognize how good Castiel was for Dean, but he wouldn’t ever admit that to his son.  His wife could tell though, he’d grown soft.  And all it took was a damn year.
“Well, obviously you’re gonna stay here, Cas.”
“Like
“Well, your dad never ran off.  He and Millie still adore you, and their two grandsons.  Millie does run a B&B, though it’s this crazy bunker thing outside of Lebanon.  Henry helps her, but mainly just likes to read his books and keep the library and all the research he’s done organized.”
“I think we should go live there!”  She squeaked out.  Dean stopped dead in his tracks and turned back to look at her.
“Oh at least.”  Dean tells him, then they’re just staring at each other like total idiots, Dean smiling and Cas smirking back at him keeping them in a feedback loop of happiness.  Dean squeezes their hands again which draws his gaze back to the silver ring he gave Cas the last night they were together.  Dean’s thumb fiddles with it lightly so that Cas also looks down, the memory running through both of their minds.  “I was so angry that night.”  Dean shook his head and looked away.
known.  You’d even give Sam and Cas a run for their money.”  Dean told her honestly and heard Charlie giggle just a bit.
“Yeah sure Cas.  But just… let’s not tell Sammy, kay?”  Just like that, all thought of ducks in the bathroom were replaced.  They hid in Dean’s room to watch the movie so Sam couldn’t stumble upon them.
.  We have guns too but we don’t aim them at the living, trust me on
He wished he could just kill the hope too, that way he would be able to live without the ghosts of his family always hanging over him.  Dean especially grieved the life he could have had with Cas had he not been such a coward for most of his life.  His thumb rubbed at his empty ring finger, his fingers trying to twist the jewelry that wasn’t there.
“You mean the one where Freddy Krueger’s hand like… comes out of the drain?”
“Yeah, Mary?”  Answered the blonde ponytail woman with the thick accent.
“Why do you think that?”  Cas turns to Dean and tilts his head slightly. Dean blushes and fidgets for a moment before admitting.
.  He tells himself, letting out a breath slowly he meets Cas eyes.  “What you want, Cas.”  Dean’s eyebrows squeeze together as he searches Cas’s eyes.  He has to get this out here, now.  “You can have it.  Always could have.  I just didn’t think you… were able to… feel-... like this.”  Dean gestures between the two of them, his heart thundering loudly in his chest.  Cas is watching him carefully, he tilts his head but Dean sees humour in his eyes.
“So you gave him the bracelet?  Bet you didn’t even say a word.”  Charlie prompted, but he could hear the smile in her voice.  Dean huffed out a laugh.
“Ugh you’re so gross, but thank you thank you thank you!  You’re my favorite person ever!  And don’t tell my girlfriend I said that.”  Dean patted her back and smiled at her.
“What?”  He said with enough incredulity to let Charlie know he thought she’d lost her mind.
“Potential amnesia sounds like, or perhaps just shock, it could still come to you later.  If that’s the worst side effect after a year long coma, then you’re a very lucky man John Winchester.”  The doctor told him, gesturing for her clipboard which a nurse passed her.
“That’s just one incident though.”  The young girl just shrugged.
Calls the man from the right side of the room.  They both turn around and look at each other.
.  You lost someone close to you?”  He took a moment to breathe in and clench his fists which served to stave off whatever part of him wanted to drown at his own harsh words.  He couldn’t give a fuck anymore.  It didn’t
“What are you saying exactly?”  Negan said in a low threatening tone.
“You’ll pull through this Mary.  That’s why we named our daughter after you, you’re the strongest woman I’ve ever met.”  Jess leaned in then and Mary hugged her back easily.  Next to them John’s heart was breaking, he could feel the old him creeping out of hiding where he’d carefully tucked him away.  He didn’t want to be jaded, or vengeful.  Not like he could physically fight the cancer anyway.  He wanted to be the best man possible for his wife up until the day she died.  That was what he had promised himself once he realized he got to have
“Let’s try to stay that way, yeah?”  He told her and she smiled back, jumping easily into the action again.
things about the internet.  You know, the things that don’t just involve working.  Things like
“Are we… in the barn we first met in?”  Cas asked and Dean smirked.
accepting about Dean’s career choice.”  John couldn’t argue that.  If this had been his original universe and Dean had told him he was going to school for
Dean and Castiel were married that November, surrounded by friends and family.  Castiel’s father showed even.  He was a squirrelly man named Chuck who was just as erratic as Cas had made him sound, mostly just muttering to himself about future plotlines, it was okay since he kept to himself.  His mother didn’t approve of his status in a queer relationship, nor did most of his siblings (And seriously there were seven on them).  But two did show, Gabriel and Anna.  Anna was exceptionally pleasant and well mannered… Gabriel, or Gabe as he prefered to be called, was not.  He had so much energy in such a small frame, said sexual innuendos every other sentence, and was the self described life of the party.
“If nothing else there would be potentially a lot of supplies we don’t find much of elsewhere.  Plus that place has a bunch of mini golf and arcades?  We could use some fun in the apocalypse.  Clearing it out will be hard.  It will take everyone and we’ll have to be super careful, methodically approaching each section, being super thorough.  We’ll want maps, a few more people, like Victor, in on this.  Some heavy load trucks, cement blockers, so-”  Charlie jumped and hugged him despite the filth, squeaking happily.
“Yes Dean?”
“Yeah, I’m gonna need to think about that one.”
“That’s Dean!”  Mary told her, smiling even as she took down another one.  Just then the roar of dead got even louder as a wandering mob of them encroached on the exterior doors just as Garth cleared them with the last cement barrier so Dean never heard her response, just heard the short brown haired woman yelling.
“Hi.”  Dean croaks out, lifting a hand to touch his cheek, he can feel the liquid in his eyes that’s more than enough proof he’s crying.  The man he loves here with him right now, the only thing he could’ve wanted.  Makes sense he only gets what he wants in life as he’s dying.
“Look at this Big Balled motherfucker right here.  I like that, that’s useful, so here’s what I’d say, Big Balls.  Fall
“Ha ha Dad.  We get it, you had some freaky ass dreams.  But
.  It was
“Call me John.”  He managed to gruff out and they shook hands.  He needed a moment.  “I’ll be in the living room, call me when it’s ready.”  With that said he totally didn’t sulk out of the room at all.  Mary gave him a concerned look, but quickly turned her attention to their guest.
“It was worth it.”  Dean says, staring hard into Cas’s eyes.  Trying to say all the things he couldn’t possibly have fit in those words.  Willing him to know everything he wanted to tell him before he could even get the words out.  Cas lets out a puff of air.
Crazy thing about him and Castiel, the angel of the lord, was they’d met twice.  Well, Cas had met him twice.  The years and years Dean had spent in hell, he remembered all of it even now, but he didn’t remember when Cas
“Yeah.”  Cas answers confused as he goes to pat his jacket.  He checks every pocket before letting the small amount of distress sink in.  “My blade is gone.” Dean looks at him wide eyed, giving the jacket a once over to be sure.
Feel free to toss any crazy conspiracy theories or ideas my way!  This fic is gonna be an interesting blend of AU and Canon elements.  You'll just have to figure out how it all ties in later!  Thanks for reading.
“Not more people going crazy about this stupid drug.”  Just said as he rubbed a hand down his face.
“Stubborn woman.  You know I love that about you.”  He could hear her sigh and roll her eyes.
“I’m not.”  Dean responds, sitting up so he can be level with Cas where they both still sit on the ground.
“Speak for yourself, Winchester.  I know plenty about psychology.”  Charlie told him indignantly and Dean just scoffed.
Sure, in the next year he would meet Cassie, who was fun and pretty.  Dean had really liked her, he was willing to try with her, the whole relationship thing that was never his style, and the honesty thing.  But it wasn’t ever love, because no matter how hard he tried to get away from it, he always just pictured Cas.  He was much better suited to the one night stand lifestyle.  Pretending was easy if it lasted only for the night, but longer than that made him feel guilty.  Any relationship he would enter into for longer than a night felt disingenuous.  It wasn’t fair to the other person that Dean couldn’t give his whole self, no one deserved to be lead on like that.
“Dean,” Cas said. “I’m sorry. You don’t have to—“
Cas let a second blade slide into his left hand. “You bet your fuckin’ ass I am.”
The last word was roared out and the creature lifted its foot for one final stomp, but Dean was ready this time. Pushing past the pain in his chest, Dean rolled the second he felt the foot leave his back. He swung his machete up at the same time and managed to slice the top of the adversary’s foot clean off.
“That was not trying,” Cas replied. “All you two did was act like children having a hissy fit before you kicked him out.”
Sam left the remainder of his breakfast on the table to go and find the sweater Cas had claimed was on the table in the war room. He didn’t manage to catch the wink that Dean sent Cas’ way, or the little smirk that lifted the corner of Cas’ mouth.
“I know,” Cas said, stroking a thumb along his cheekbone. He leaned in and placed a gentle kiss on his lips.
“You can go ahead,” Sam told her.
“Jeez, nosy, it’s none of your business.”
“Fine,” Sam shouted, throwing his hands up in the air. “Disappear for another five years, see if I come and look for you this time!”
“You are a moron. And you’re only half forgiven so don’t push your luck.” Cas walked brusquely past Dean. “Now let’s go. Charlie is making steak and I’m hungry.”
Cas lifted a hand up and snapped. The forest below burst into flames.
Mary tried for two hours to coax Sam out of the bathroom before she was successful.
It became a thing. They never talked about it in person, but their notes to each other had definitely become… flirtatious.
“He’s smart,” Cas said, “just incredibly reckless.”
He shook his head in reply.
Cas turned to look at him with a warm smile.
Dean glared at Cas who looked back completely unruffled. It was a little unfair how Cas had mastered the ability to look calm during their fights. Dean hated it.
“Yeah,” Dean breathed out. “Yeah. We can go sit?”
“Uh,” Dean looked over at everyone else, laying back on their towels and chatting. Charlie was throwing chips at Jo, who retaliated with pretzels. Sam and Ruby had taken their towels a little further away and were talking in hushed tones with each other. Meg and Hannah were talking about something, but Meg kept looking over at them every few minutes. “Maybe we can go somewhere else?”
After a truly mortifying classroom experience with Professor Barnes where she taught Dean and Cas to build up walls around their thoughts (she was one for teasing, and being a psychic, knew exactly how to embarrass the most effectively), Cas’ birthday arrived. And with plenty of fanfare, thanks to Dean.
“Drop the head,” Cas told him. “Beheading only stuns him. If you want to kill it, you have to stab it in the heart.”
Cas leaned forward, and Dean managed to follow suit. This was it, it was really going to happen, he was going to
Cas shot up in bed. The heart monitor was beeping wildly and he could hear Gabriel shouting his name over and over again, though he could barely hear it over a ringing in his ears.
“Thank you so much, Principal Mills,” she said, her voice muffled through the door. “Castiel and I truly appreciate it.”
“Aw, someone’s grumpy this morning,” Dean cooed, sliding into a seat next to him. “You want me to make you some breakfast?”
“Uh, sorry, Gabe. Kinda gotta take Cas’ side now,” Dean told him, lifting their clasped hands as if to prove his point.
“And the teenagers did go missing right after Sam and his friends saw the monster,” Charlie said. “And the last place anyone saw them was the woods.”
“You’re late,” Cas said, hurrying over and pulling Dean to his feet.
“Better than sounding like I just crawled out of the primordial ooze.”
“Shut up, Jo,” Dean said, punching her in the arm.
Bobby just shook his head. “I should’ve tried harder.”
Dean turned his attention to his muffin, taking a huge bite of it before turning to see that Cas had already drunk half of his coffee.
Cas gave a contented little sigh and began eating. Only after he had finished half of his plate did he notice that Dean was just sitting next to him.
His fins helped him glide easily through the water towards where he could see the orange yellow glow of the reflection of the fire on the surface. His first breath of air had him spluttering and choking on a mouth full of water. It seemed that the moment his forehead hit fresh air his gills stopped working and his lungs had kicked back in. He kept coughing as he swam towards the shore and the dozen or so yards the shallow beach would provide as an arena for his fight. Thankfully his fins and flipper like feet hadn’t disappeared so he made it to shore in record time.
“I promised Charlie you’d bring her the leftovers tomorrow.”
Cas actually let out an ear splitting roar at that, and when Sam looked over he saw that Cas’ fingers had extended into wicked looking claws and his torso was literally erupting in scales that drew up to his neck. The sight gave Sam pause and a moment’s indecision, but he pushed the doubt aside quickly.
“Oh yeah, talk nerdy to me, baby.” Dean raised his eyebrows lasciviously.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Same time next week?”
Cas furrowed his brow and cocked his head to the side. “Who said that?”
“Fine,” Cas acquiesced and finally allowed Dean to get up.
“Sammy, please.” Dean’s voice cracked.
“Yes,” Cas finally admitted. “But I promise, I wasn’t trying to be creepy. I…” He glowed nearly as bright as he did when Dean first met him. He mumbled the next part, but Dean still managed to catch every word. “I just thought you were handsome and wanted to see you better.”
“Cas,” Dean said, caution in his voice.
“Great,” Cas said with one last smile and sauntered over to where the rest of the actors were taking their place on set.
“It wasn’t guys from the high shool, Dean,” he said, and Dean could tell he was gritting his teeth even though his back was turned.
“That is why I’m asking.”
would not have agreed on this one.”
Cas turned narrowed eyes on Sam who was scrabbling at the hand around his neck. “Apologies,” he said and dropped him down to the ground.
over a word. He was definitely correct in his previous assertion of pathetic.
Dean’s eyes narrowed and then snapped open. “Sam, you little—“
“I just—I don’t want to go anymore. I don’t feel good anymore.” He hid his head in his knees. “Just go without me.”
“No,” Sam said, coming to stand next to Dean. “You’ve kept me out of this long enough. I’m not going to stand by and watch dad try to ruin your life again.”
“Why are you running?”
“Dean asked me to help him out,” Bobby told him. “And damn, I’d never heard the boy sounding so happy about life. I wasn’t about to mess with that. If he wanted his privacy I was damn well going to give it to him.” He paused to take another swig of beer. “Besides, he was the only one picking up a phone to give me a call every now and then. I didn’t hear from you until you came lookin’ for him.”
“Sam, please,” Cas implored, voice shaking. “The bond doesn’t invalidate Dean’s will.”
Silence fell between them for a few minutes, long enough for Dean to think it was safe to go to sleep.
“I don’t even want to know what he’d ask for in return,” Dean told him. “It’s alright, really, Cas. I can get past an awkward silence. It’s not like I’m not used to them.”
“Well, what do you want to know about it?” Dean pushed his chair back from his desk and kicked his feet up onto it. He was in a pretty chipper mood since he got to spend all morning under the hood of a car instead of holed up doing paperwork.
They remained holed up in Dean and Cas’ room for the next thirty minutes before Bobby finally opened the door and announced that John had left.
Twenty minutes came and went with no sign of John Winchester. And then another twenty.
Dean curled up on his bed, a tiny ball in the upper right corner. Ever since the djinn he’d been unable to reclaim his whole bed, no matter how hard he tried. He’d purposely make himself lie down in the middle, but within minutes he would drift to his side. Mornings always found him reaching out for a figure that was never there, had never been there.
“Which star do you think my mom is looking out of?”
, it was the dance.
“What?”
With a frown on his face, Dean tried finding something to dislike about Bobby’s plan, but it didn’t work. Instead of acknowledging it, however, he merely continued to allow himself to be led to the school.
“I’m sorry,” Sam said again.
Cas sprung up from the ground and saw the original adversary standing there, arms still raised from where they had beat into Castiel’s back. He looked to the other form still roaring, but had finally managed to remove the sword from its shoulder. It was now stalking over towards Castiel.
“You know,” Dean said, as they got to the door. “That’s not a bad idea.”
“Yeah, but you like me anyway,” he grinned.
Sam shrugged and continued staring out the window.
Sam snorted. He had had enough time by now to get used to Dean being married, and the thought of them being ‘friends’ after how many times he’s seen their casual kisses turn into full blown make out sessions was pretty ridiculous.
Dean still saw spots even after the light had dimmed to almost nothing.
John sighed and turned his attention to wrapping his arm tightly. “I know,” he said softly. “I’m trying to make up for the things I’ve done.”
“Dean, you like Lord of the Rings,” Charlie told him.
“I’m not trying to be the bad guy here,” John told him and Dean couldn’t keep in his snort. “I’m just trying to look out for you. I don’t think you understand just how bad this situation is, Dean. You should be killing that thing, not fucking it.”
But that just got Dean chuckling. “Who would have thought that all cops would be such clichés.”
“Well, it’s not school either,” Dean told him. “Interrogate us on Monday. Come on, Cas.” He walked over and began leading the way out the door.
Cas came up behind Dean and wrapped both arms around his waist. He pressed a kiss to the back of his neck. "Morning," he hummed, and then departed for his cup of coffee.
Once they were both standing, Cas snaked an arm around Dean's hips and rested his face against his shoulder, and they walked like that, like Cas needed physical help getting back to his room.
“They must have come out last night,” Cas explains. “It takes a great deal of effort to keep them hidden and sometimes, when I lose control, they appear.”
Cas moaned again and reluctantly stood, stretching his arms over his head while he sighed. Dean definitely did not stare at the strip of skin that exposed itself between Cas's shirt and jeans.
Dean hadn't heard him come in and jumped at the sound of his voice, but smiled at his brother and turned back to slicing strawberries. "Morning, Sammy. I was thinking about crepes today, what do ya think?"
Dean can hear the click of Cas’s throat as he swallows. He raises a hand, pointing to the knob of his left cheekbone.
“Come on, come on. One more picture,” Cas begs, pulling out of Dean’s grasp and positioning himself on the chair. He couldn't wipe that smile off his face if he tried, and it looks like he isn’t putting in any effort at all to push it away.
"Shut up and watch the freaking movie with me, then, genius."
“And I was
While Dean thoroughly preferred angel Castiel, he was coming to like the human version of his friend. Still blissfully unaware and naïve, Cas was even more fun when he had to participate in people activities like eating, drinking, and sleeping. What was better was Cas when he went slightly too long without doing any of those things and becoming grumpy.
“Oh.” Dean looks down at the lipstick, caught somewhere between disappointment and relief, wondering if it would be better or worse if these kisses were meant for Cas’s lips instead of the rest of his face. Would it even be right of him to take Cas up on this offer when he already fantasizes about putting kisses all over Cas’s skin? Would it be wrong for their first kisses to be over some project? “I don’t know how I feel about this, Cas.”
Eventually, they part. Not to gasp for breath, but to rest their foreheads together; to align their hearts. Between them, Dean can smell Cas’s toothpaste and taste the lipstick.
Before Dean could question himself anymore, he pushed forward and closed the distance between them. They kissed each other slowly, lazily, happily, while the two of them wrapped themselves together, cupping cheeks and palming hips and pulling closer and closer.
“Yeah, well ‘sorry’ isn’t going to turn back time,” Dean said. “He made us, I could see it in his eyes. Now we have to move and just—
“No!” Cas exclaimed. “No, of course not. I just wasn’t sure.”
“They wouldn’t argue over that. Their colors are going to be blue and green, they’re both total saps.”
"No, I'm not! You're being the butthead, butthead!"
“What a nerd,” Dean told her as he placed Cas’ coffee in front of him.
“Uh,” Dean rubbed the back of his neck as Sam slid onto the bench next to him with a knowing smirk on his face.
“That’s not flirting,” Cas said. “That’s stating a fact. I do enjoy your company.”
“Nope,” Cas agreed. “We’re the perfect amount of cute.”
thing?” Dean said. “If I wanted you to know why, I’d fucking tell you why.”
“Well then, a dance was a great idea for our first date, wasn’t it?” Cas’ smile was wide and gummy, his eyes bright with mirth.
"That's it," Dean said, and then launched himself at his boyfriend.
“Whoa, whoa, Sam,” Jess said, grabbing his shoulder and forcing him around to face her. “You can’t blame yourself for something like that. You were just a kid—“
Sam smacked his hands over his eyes, continuing his horrified screaming of, “Oh god! My eyes!”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean said, hoisting their bag onto his shoulder. “Be back by dinner, alright?”
Dean bit the inside of his lip to keep anything from spilling out and then took the only available seat next to Cas.
“I feel like I’m missing something,” Sam said, looking back and forth from Dean and Cas. “I mean, Cas’ idea sounds pretty good to me. He knows tons of lore. He probably could help dad.”
Cas reached a hand out in an attempt to comfort, but Dean brushed him off.
“I am sorry, Cas,” Dean said somberly. “I didn’t mean it.”
Dean groaned. “Can we not talk about this tonight? Or ever? It’ll go away on its own. Trust me.”
“Pondering your existence or staring at his ass?”
After the pizza, Dean and Cas spent a while playing some of the games set up along the back wall. Dean managed to knock over a pyramid of bottles on his first try, grinning with pride as he handed Cas the cheap teddy bear he’d won for his efforts. Cas accepted it with a blushing smile, handed over a dollar to their P.E. teacher for his own try and did the same. Dean mumbled a blushing thanks as Cas gave him his own teddy bear.
“I don’t know,” Cas replied. “But Mrs. Winchester is going to be disappointed that we failed to get Sam out of his room.”
“Sam’s gone!”
He would take the special phone privileges as a positive, even though Dean was sure Bobby would have done it for any kid in need. Not that any other kid would be in need; he was sure the rest of the students would be coming equipped with their own personal cell phones. But he agreed to the secrecy to set Bobby’s mind at ease.
Charlie scoffed. “You didn’t tell me. I took one look at you after Cas’ voice dropped and just
“Yeah, yeah,” Charlie said, waving him away. “I’m a big softie. Now get out, I need to seduce my girlfriend.”
.” He ran his hand through his hair a couple of times, making it stand up on end. “What am I supposed to do, Cas?” Dean looked over to him like he was lost, eyes wide and shining with tears. So much like the first time they met.
“That’s… one word for it,” Sam replied, trying to keep his voice even.
Cas, who was relaxing next to Dean with what looked like no care in the world, simply replied, “Your brother assured me that he would be able to come without your father.”
detailed description of why you thought that would be a good idea.”
“I—“ Cas stopped and cleared his throat. “Are you lying to me? Dean looks angry that you’re over here.”
“She always came into Gabe’s shop with another girl. And I once caught them kissing out back near the dumpsters. It was pretty gross.”
Sam sighed. “I know, I know. Just don’t be a creep, alright?”
Cas shrugged Dean’s hand off. “You’re being dramatic again,” he told him and stepped off the path.
Sam crossed his arms and planted his feet in the dying grass.
,” Jo complained.
“We will, my love,” Cas said. “We will.”
“Dammit, Sam,” John said, throwing the gauze he was wrapping around his arm into the sink. “I’m telling you that thing ain’t human.”
