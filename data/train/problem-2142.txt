“I’ll let you know what we find out,” Lestrade told them. As it was, he hadn’t had any good reason to call Sherlock on the case, aside from the obvious, the one his team would surely comment on the moment they entered the room (and it was high time he got them in besides, but he wanted Sherlock and John gone first).
“One can only see well with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eyes.”
“Who are they?” Sherlock asked.
“Where are you going?” asked Mrs. Hudson.
“Nothing just something,” Sherlock repeated. “That covers pretty much everything then, doesn’t it?”
Sherlock, with his innate sense of direction, knew exactly where they were. “This way,” he said, though he didn’t start walking until he was sure John would walk with him. He was sorry to see that John showed some reluctance. But maybe that was only because they were going back the way they’d come, closer to the crime scene? “It spooked you,” remarked Sherlock, and this time the look John gave him was something akin to exasperation.
“How many of them are there?” John asked.
“What’s that from?” John asked.
John’s jaw fell open. “I haven’t! I’m not! I—”
Sherlock gave another obedient nod and the nurse left.
“And the dogs?” he went on, eyeing the pack.
“I told you to stay back at the hotel,” said Sherlock, but he paused long enough for John to catch up to him.
“John.”
angry, and he might be for a while, but that doesn’t mean he’s not also happy to see you. It’s just—it’s going to be mixed up inside him for a while.”
“Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade.”
, Sherlock thought spitefully, taking care not to slam the drawer in frustration.
“Sherlock, stop!”
Sherlock darted a look in the direction of the men Demetria had teased and was forced to agree with her assessment. “Thank you,” he murmured.
“You met him then too?” Lestrade asked him.
“It would take too long! You don’t ride?” When John only shook his head, Elyse said, “Climb up behind me; I’ll manage Morningstar.”
“I came here often enough,” John retorted. “Because I thought it was the closest I would ever get to you again in this lifetime. So don’t tell me what it does or doesn’t mean.”
“Found it with the body,” John told him. He started walking, quickly, almost as if he wished to shake his companion loose.
“She was there at the time.” Mycroft leaned his weight against a counter and took another hesitant sip of his tea.
Sherlock felt as if ice were forming around his internal organs. “What are you talking about, Irene?”
Sherlock spared him a glance. “In the absence of other evidence, there’s only one person to ask.”
“John,” Sarah said after a moment, “what happened to him?”
The expression Sarah flashed at him as she passed on the way to John’s room bordered on loathing, though it was the ounce of pity in it that irritated Sherlock most. Striving to ignore it, he asked Lestrade, “What do we need to talk about?”
Gerrie was on the landing. “How is he?”
But Moriarty shook his head.
“Not that I’m aware of, but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t have a reason she considers to be valid.” They made the landing for the second floor, and Sherlock pointed to one side. “That’s the long gallery there.”
Lestrade cleared his throat. “Right, so . . . We should move on to what happened with you then, Doctor.”
The man stood, wrote some more, then said, “I’d like you to try to eat something before your next dose. Can you do that for me?”
With a huff of impatience, Sherlock abandoned that line of inquiry, though he was determined he would get answers for it sooner or later. “When was this?”
“Still, a doctor,” Irene sighed. “Good with his hands, I bet. Why didn’t you have him fix that cut on your forehead?”
here.”
Jeremy raised his eyebrows and looked again at John.
Irene took it with a frown. “Aren’t you coming?”
“What about your parents? Your brother? Old boyfriends?”
“Then I should be grateful you were there.” He paused. “If nothing happened, why were you so reluctant to tell me?”
John’s eyes were closing. “So tired,” he murmured. “Take me home.”
John swallowed his retort, folded his arms and leaned against the nearest wall. Why had he bothered to come? Sherlock had it sorted, didn’t need his help. And yet here he was, extraneous and underfoot.
“Harry will be out at the end of next week,” Mrs. Watson continued. “And we were that sorry to hear Eoin wouldn’t be attending—”
“The flat.”
Lestrade moved fast, but not fast enough to stop Sherlock from breaking Charles’s nose with the butt of the gun.
“Wait, how are Markham and Lumley a bell?” asked John.
Christopher only shrugged.
“Not at—? Now look here—”
“Visit your mum, maybe?” John suggested.
“Does Sherlock know you’re here?”
working. And I’ve been here from the minute I heard, and where was he? He didn’t even bring you flowers!”
Sarah sighed. “I did, finally. She said you were sick.”
After a sleepless night at Corring Hall, and a day spent making circles in their library while trying to keep up some semblance of polite chit-chat until it was time to get dressed and return to Weald House, John now stood in the drawing room, charged with nervous energy derived from the knowledge that Sherlock was somewhere nearby, and that it was almost time to see him. Harry had abandoned John the minute they’d stepped through the door (a night and day of his company being as much as she was willing to bear), and John had sent his parents away because they’d only made him more nervous. But now here was Irene, smiling and strangely calm, as if she had nothing to prove by having this whole affair go off smoothly.
And for the first time ever, John witnessed Mycroft at a complete loss. Though if any person on the planet could test the limits of a gentleman’s patience and good manners, John supposed it would be Irene. “It’s . . .” Mycroft began, but that was as far as he managed to get; he turned his frown on the bear, seeming to blame it for his inability to produce a suitable response.
“Come on, then,” his sister prodded. “Every second must feel like an eternity out there.” When John continued to hesitate, Harry asked, “You having second thoughts, Johnny?”
They locked eyes.
Tamzen heaved a sigh and looked again at Sherlock. “There he is. Feel better now?” Then she called, “Back here, Jonah!”
“Sherlock,” said Lestrade, and the detective turned, “you’re certain Whitcombe came back for John?”
John had half convinced himself to go check when he heard the door open. Sherlock was home early then. Had he brought Irene with him? He listened but there was no telltale chatter, and he didn’t think Irene could be quiet for very long.
“Uh . . . I just need my stuff from the bath. Are you sure it’s okay?” he asked as Sherlock turned around again.
“How is it you’re always running into him when you visit, and I live there and never see him?” Sherlock asked.
“You said you weren’t,” Sherlock challenged.
But John had already come to the same conclusion. The weight and feel of the piece was too familiar for him to believe there could be another so identical to the one he was used to.
“He asked after you this afternoon,” said Sherlock.
“Nice, aren’t they?” asked Mrs. Grossman. “That one is Mr.—Dr. Watson,” she hastily amended, “and the other one is . . .” Mrs. Grossman turned from the paintings to the visitor and back again. “You didn’t say you were a relation?”
The question now was whether Moriarty was behind these heists and whether Sherlock was walking into a trap.
Unsure whether he should say anything, Sherlock looked to Irene; if anyone could coach him on social complexities, she could. But her lips were firmly pressed together as she tried to keep from laughing. He frowned at her; he didn’t find any of it particularly funny. But Irene’s eyes continued to sparkle with amusement as she gave her head a tiny shake, a gesture Sherlock took to mean he should keep his mouth shut.
Now John sighed and rolled onto his back, which Sherlock counted as progress at least. “What do you want?”
Eoin?” Irene asked, startling the two men who seemed to have forgotten she was there.
Sherlock didn’t answer, instead making straight for the pile of post John had left beside his computer. He had only just begun flipping through it when there came a knock at the door. “Must be, if he’s been watching the flat to see when I get home.” He waited a moment to see if John would come back to answer it, was more than a little annoyed when he didn’t, and resigned himself to opening the door on his own.
John gave a little shrug. “Fine with me.”
The crowd around them got louder; Demetria had mounted the stage at the far end of the room. Suddenly Sherlock felt overheated. He leaned over to Irene. “Need some air.”
“I don’t have any . . .” But his avoidance of his cell phone was clearly only making Lestrade curious. “Maybe I should just check . . .” John scooped up the phone and glanced at the messages, trying to keep his face passive. He might have been successful with Lestrade, but Sherlock emerged from his shower freshly dressed and immediately asked, “What’s wrong now?” And without waiting for an answer, he swiped John’s phone from his hand and scrolled through the messages, typed a quick response, and handed the phone back. “There. That should take care of it.”
“No, just oblivious. As usual.” She’d stood to leave, their break finished. “But it has a happy ending anyway.”
“I could hardly believe it when I ran into Irene,” said Christopher. “She hasn’t been over in ages. Want something from the minibar?”
“As if I haven’t seen that before!” said Sarah, quickly adding, “In patients, I mean. Not you in particular.”
But Sherlock only began to speak more rapidly. “Their daughter has suffered a serious sports injury. Neck, I would say. And—”
“It works to
Sherlock only stared, unwilling to help the inspector come to the inevitable terminus of this line of inquiry.
THE WRITE-UP IN the guidebook read:
“I think you know what I mean, Eoin,” said John, trying to be gentle, though now that the decision was made, he felt impatience beginning to surface inside him.
John resolved not to care and started for the butler’s pantry. He’d take all the keys if need be and try every one of them until he found the one that would free his car.
After wandering for a bit, they’d ended up in a Thai restaurant, and although John had been all for waiting, Irene had finally ordered them both something to eat. John had never seen someone so small eat so much so quickly.
With a growl of frustration, John reached across the bed for the phone.
“No accelerants that we can find,” Lestrade went on after a pause. “But it started in the middle of the floor, so doesn’t seem likely to be the wiring, either.”
“We stay in,” said Sherlock. He wasn’t surprised that Moriarty was aware of his and John’s habits; the villain had made it clear in the past he kept tabs on them. Even now, Sherlock found his gaze drawn to the windows of their flat, and Moriarty laughed.
“No.”
They lapsed into silence, but it was of the companionable sort, the kind that came with hard-won victories and well-earned fatigue. In fact, they were very close to falling asleep where they sat except Sherlock’s side protested when he began to slump. “Christ,” he hissed, “when does the medicine kick in?”
Well, it’d be faster than the gut injury.
“Open your eyes and look at me, Sherlock.”
“I told you, I only just looked it up, so it’s fresh in my mind.”
Or did he?
“Fingernail polish,” said Sherlock, dropping to the hardwood. “And black shoe polish, too; whoever she is, she was wearing dress shoes.”
Sherlock was going to hate waking up in a hospital, and what was worse, in a hospital gown. Ah, God, they couldn’t keep on like this. A collection of scars indeed.
“You should learn to walk first,” Sherlock advised.
Sherlock’s visage darkened further. “Don’t call me that. Seriously, it’s rude to continue calling someone by a name they don’t like.”
Maybe if he ignored her, she would go away? Like one of those animals—what were they called?—that played dead . . .
“Mr. Markham? Your assistant is here,” the young man announced.
Sherlock rose. “I should go.”
The mobile phones rang, and Sherlock ignored them. The phones chimed to alert them of voicemails and text messages, and Sherlock ignored them. Mrs. Hudson left the post beside the door each afternoon, and Sherlock ignored it.
benefit, not mine! None of what you do is for me! At best my wellbeing is a byproduct of your fascination with whatever mystery you’re solving at the time!”
Gerrie walked them well away from the library door and said, “I know you’re lying.”
Irene and—
“Huh,” John said now. “There it is.”
And after a few minutes, he did.
And John had no guidelines for this situation. He was at a loss. And so he stood there rather inanely while Sherlock typed and searched and gathered information, seemingly oblivious to John’s turmoil. It was as if Sherlock had already forgotten what he’d said. Or maybe it had been a simple observation on his part, void of consequence.
“No, what happened, exactly?”
Sherlock shook his head.
, Sherlock reminded himself. He set the photo aside and went for the gun.
John glanced again at Sherlock, who hadn’t moved, and suddenly felt as if putting additional space between them wouldn’t be a bad thing. So he walked to the far end of the kitchen and took a seat. Glancing out the window, he saw something that gave him pause. “There’s a pond.”
“Yes.”
“And he could have come to me. He could even have defended me, stopped his brother from pressing charges. But he didn’t. Because—and you must know it as well as I do—Sherlock Holmes doesn’t put himself out for anyone.”
Moriarty pushed himself away from the door, slipped his hands into his pockets and sauntered into the flat. “I got a letter like that recently. And then I realized I could kill two martlets with one stone.”
Sherlock threw John a look that very clearly said,
“You know everything you need to know.”
“It’s the middle of the day! Won’t he wait until tonight?”
He sighed and fished it from his pocket, showed her the image that had been sent as a text message from an unknown number. “What do you see?”
John opened the envelope and read the short note.
“Irene. Adler. Didn’t we do this?”
Irene’s brilliant green eyes flew across the bed to John’s sister. “Oh! No, just a friend. Irene,” she said, holding out her hand.  “Flew in last night from New York when it sounded  like . . . Well, but he’s better, so that’s all that matters.”
John didn’t understand. “Kensington?”
John was formulating an appropriately snippy retort when Mrs. Hudson appeared in the doorway. “You’re up!” she crowed.
John felt his throat tighten. He tossed the phone across the bed, not wanting to break it but not wanting to look at it either.
Outside, sirens sounded.
“The east lawn?” Sherlock considered. There were noteworthy advantages, primarily how much his mother would love the idea, and how much Mycroft would hate it. “It could work.” He watched John take up his bag and added, “Though after all this, I’m sure you’ll want to stay home for the honeymoon.”
Inky... that’s how Sherlock had described the scent of the Alpha his brother had chosen for him, the Alpha he’d rejected.
For all that, John was still beautiful. When Sherlock went through into the psychiatrist's office for their appointment, he found John standing in the sunlight. His hair shone orange and silver, and his whole form was backlit with a bright halo. He stepped forward to greet Sherlock, something akin to welcome on his expressive face, and Sherlock couldn't help but smile with the simple joy of being with John.
“I hate you.” John murmured.
John turned back towards the path of wooden boards. “Is that Mycroft?!”
“Not with another person... but I’ve experimented...”
I’d thought a lot about it while Sherlock was away, what it meant about me that I enjoyed dominating him sexually so very much... I’d come to the conclusion that at essence it was about taking care of him. He wanted to submit – isn’t that what he’d been doing with Officer Vaachaspati and the other men? Performing acts of submission? Perhaps it satisfied him on the same deep level that taking control satisfied me, but he needed someone who would never take advantage of that desire, someone who would always put his safety and his satiety first. Someone who adored him.
Mycroft sighed deeply, his lips against Lestrade’s temple. “Greg.”
For all that, Dad had to know where she was at all times, where she'd gone, who she'd been talking to, what they said. He didn't like her to have friends over at the house and he
8. Me. I had grown a full beard and wore a pair of black frame glasses to disguise myself. The glasses had promptly broken on the cement floor in solitary. I bound the two halves together as well as I could with thread pulled from my coat.
“Not yet, Mycroft. I’m not ready for rehab yet.”
“No. Stay with me for a while.”
“John, you are without a doubt, the best thing to ever happen to my brother. You have been astonishingly patient with him – his moods, his ‘death,’ his prolonged absence... I can only ask you to be patient a bit longer.”
And did he have a choice?
“It’ll be faster and easier if I do. By the way, don’t pack your mobile; we’ll pick up new ones later.”
“It’s not as if he were brutalizing me, John.”
“You’re so busy seeing everything he isn’t, you don’t see him for what he is,” John said. “He’s amazing, in case you hadn’t noticed. And no, he doesn’t work for the Home Office, and he doesn’t play the piano, and his personal skills are, well, practically nil, but if you’d quit trying to make him into someone he isn’t, you might be pleasantly surprised.”
John tensed, waiting to see in what form the rejection would come.
Moriarty banged the cane loudly against the floor. “Look at me! You’ve ruined everything! And your brother, clawing away at my life’s work!” Moriarty gritted his teeth, as if biting down on his temper. “Oh, I promised if you kept getting in my way, I would burn the heart out of you, and I. Will. Do. It!”
“What are you thinking about?” Sherlock asked, pulling John from his reverie.
Sherlock hesitated but didn’t answer.
“You know me better than that,” Sherlock said. “I never take evidence just from the surface.”
“To the hospital!”
And as Sherlock began to fall, John broke free of his stasis. He took Sherlock’s right arm and helped Mycroft ease Sherlock down.
“Tea mostly,” said Sherlock.
“Breakfast?” John suggested hopefully. His stomach was making him keenly aware he hadn’t had dinner the night before.
Sherlock waited, but John seemed disinclined to finish his sentence. So Sherlock asked, “Who’s Fiver?”
“Yes, well, that’s not a conversation I intend to have.” Sherlock threw off the remainder of the bedspread, and John was relieved to see his trousers, if wrinkled, were still intact.
John mistook my assessing gaze for worry and scowled. I climbed into the cab ahead of him trying to hide my flush of passion.
I went looking for him. I checked the study thinking he could be giving Sir Afan's will a close read, but it was empty. I wandered through the first floor – I found the library, a room three times the size of the study that easily accommodated a bar, a billiards table AND a full-sized adult, taxidermy elephant without giving up its airy spaciousness.
If I’d never met John this would be easier. If I’d never met John, the sex would be nothing to me – a much needed distraction. If I’d never met John, drugs would be a temptation, but not so very fraught with sentiment. If I’d never met John... I couldn’t bring myself to think about it any longer, let alone wish it...
John stepped out of the shower – and Sherlock was there, holding out a towel. He had been waiting with silent patience for John to emerge. John took the proffered towel and smiled at his friend.
Should he pretend it was John? Sherlock didn’t want to. He didn’t want to desecrate his feelings for John this way. But John would want him to do it if it made this any less horrible. Would it? Would it help to think of the grabby hands bruising his flesh as John’s? Sherlock’s entire being revolted at the idea.
“Of course!” I insisted, though I barely knew what I was saying. My insides buzzed.
Someone grabbed my shoulder and I reacted – bringing my knife around to defend myself against this new enemy. But it was a kid, a British soldier. One of my own troops.
Shane slowly started to feel warmer. His shivering ceased and he drank the juice they gave him. But the better he felt, the more he dreaded what was to come – an awful hospital waiting room or worse, a chair in John’s room where he would watch his lover lay unconscious…
The thought made him sick. John didn't want to be anything like his dad.
“Help me get him up to bed.” I said. “Are there hot water bottles? Hot soup?”
“You think he’s watching us.” John asked softly.
She didn’t make it sound like seeing her younger son was in any way a pleasure.
“Not your fault.” Sherlock told him stoutly. “I didn’t even feel it until now. I have an ointment.”
“Oh bloody hell.” Moran swore. He went to John and jerked his jeans up to his waist and buttoned them roughly. John looked furious, but kept quiet. However, when Moran grabbed his wrist and started to bend down to carry John over his shoulder he tried to pull away.
That was disappointing – I’d hoped we’d have the evening together. I rubbed my calf against his and fondled his thigh. Sherlock’s words trailed off. He looked so sweetly flustered, I almost laughed.
What was Sherlock's next move? Follow the hunter – he had to find out more about him. But Sherlock ached to talk to John, he was SO CLOSE. He tried to put out of his mind what he and that boyfriend might be doing together. Sherlock had started this day so bright and optimistic – now his stomach was a knot of dread and he was having trouble keeping his sentiments in check.
"Oh yes, of course." Sherlock slurred. "I don't have John because I'm inconsiderate and arrogant. Stupid." He felt compelled to explain himself. Knowing it was the effect of the drug didn't stop the compulsion. "Because I didn't understand ... I was afraid... I left him... lied to him... I don't deserve him..."
"My legs hurt, my feet, that's a good sign." John was clearly trying to gain control of his distress. "I don't know how long he left me like that. If it was too long... the flesh will die and they'll have to amputate...oh god…"
“I’m sorry.”
John isn’t gay. He’s had a string of girlfriends in the time I’ve known him and shown no sexual interest in men – I would know, I watched for it relentlessly, even following him to see if perhaps he indulged in a bit of cottaging. Many ‘straight’ men do. Unlimited, free, no-strings sex on demand is a powerful motivator even to those who prefer women.
Sholto nodded. “How many?”
“A helicopter is on the way. If you could trouble yourselves to climb up to the roof.”
Shane reluctantly let Sherlock propel him to the door – John could hear Sherlock saying something in Shane's ear. Good. Let him run interference for once. John had done it enough for him.
"What do you do?" The words were soft but it was a desperate cry, a plea.
Moran had stood up, effectively joining us. “Seb.” I handed him his whiskey. “This is Ravi.” Officer Vaachaspati’s eyes travelled the length of Moran’s frame and he smirked with appreciation. His hand felt hot on my back.
Nazer stroked my matted hair. “Course I did, pet.” He was apt to be affectionate when we were alone.
I waved him away.
“If I’m accepted.”
"Yes."
He lay down intending to nap, but found himself mapping the route to the heroin dealer he'd subconsciously noticed three days ago...
“Yes.” Did he really doubt me? “Of course! As long as you want me, I’ll come back. Why wouldn’t I come back?”
He was right. It showed how impaired I was that I hadn't realised it myself. I was turning into an idiot!
“Afghanistan. Three tours. Almost three. I didn’t quite make it to the end.”
My mouth hung open like a fish gasping for oxygen as I tried to process his words. I had not expected this, I was shocked, completely shocked... yet I didn't feel surprised. I felt... I didn't know how I felt! Of course I loved him – he was my closest friend. Sherlock had saved me from the ennui that had started to kill me...
“Please, Harry... you don’t have to stay the whole six weeks – just one more week. Then you can check yourself out. But I need you to do this for me.”
"I recall. Cocaine was your remedy for boredom."
“Who’s this then?!” John demanded before he thought better of it.
"So he didn't disapprove of your sister inheriting?"
**I’ll text when I get there**
"No – he's not in his room?"
Sherlock smiled. “It’s an automaton.” He told me. “With waxwork head and hands. I had a cast made whilst I was in rehab. Mycroft commissioned an artist from Toussads make it. It’s set to look out the window every fifteen minutes.”
“I also wanted to return this.” Mycroft indicated a rucksack at his feet. “The police recovered it, everything is accounted for, I assure you, Mr. Watson.”
Moran’s smile faded. “It was his Ricky.” He protested.
“No.” John said.
“I’m fine.” I insisted. Anxiety rose up like a wave, blanketing me with its chill. “I feel fine.”
He texted John. **I'm at the front door**
“Is Sherlock ok, Mycroft!? Tell me!”
I'd talk it over with John in the morning. That never failed to shake something loose.
“And I him.”
“What legal matters?” Sherlock blurted. John’s fists were clenched tightly, his body stiff with stress, but Sherlock had to know.
It was laughable compared to the Duchess! Or any of the other fine families who’d expressed interest in her son. She never should have agreed to the Moriarty compromise!
The gown dropped to the floor – Sherlock was unselfconscious of his nakedness, simply noting the bruises blooming on his chest, the raw cuts on his hip, but it also exposed another barrier to a fast getaway. A catheter.
We’d fled the building with the villains in hot pursuit, ducking down alleys and pelting through a park. After what seemed like forever, John had taken me by the arm, pulled me around a blind corner and into an alley behind a pub.
"Just let me alone." John snapped, pulling away from Shane's touch. "In fact, get out. Both of you, I'm tired. I want to sleep."
"Right." John said. "As soon as you eat your bacon."
"I heard something about your grandfather."
“Not hungry.” Sherlock murmured, his bow poised.
Other Alphas – and even larger Betas – gave them lots of room, stepping off the sidewalk, not looking directly at Sherlock, keeping their hands where John could see them. Everyone knew that newly bonded Alphas were touchy. It was common courtesy, drilled into children from their earliest years, that you kept your eyes and your distance from a newly bonded pair. No one needed to poke that bear. If you did, whatever happened was your own fault. The law was not on your side.
Victor seemed to deflate. “I do. I really don’t know what I’m doing here now. Without him.”
I stroked his forehead. "Sshhh... it's ok..."
"Oh." He was going to see her. He was exhausted and in pain and he was going to go see her anyway. The curry tasted like wet cardboard all of a sudden.
“Yep.” Lestrade grinned. Surreptitiously he brushed his knuckles against Mycroft’s hand, letting their fingers tangle. He heard Mycroft’s breath hitch.
“Where?”
The horror was reflected on the elder brother’s face. “Guess some kids will always be embarrassed by dad.” Lestrade murmured, amused.
Angus was right, John reflected, he needed to stop whingeing. He needed to stop feeling sorry for himself. But it was difficult... he'd lost a hand. A HAND! Sometimes he he just wanted to scream at people – scream at Sherlock and Shane and Angus and anyone else listening to just leave him alone. Leave him alone to wallow in self-pity ...and indulge in angry tantrums ...and sit and watch the world go on without him because John didn't matter anymore! He couldn't contribute anything! He'd never be a soldier or a surgeon again. He could sit in a clinic and take temperatures and dispense pills – that's all his medical degree was good for now. He supposed he could shoot, but hand-to-hand he would be useless, a liability.
It was the smuggler.
“Oh, Shane…” John murmured.
Shane jogged to the end of the block - the neighborhood was dark and quiet. He wondered if he should start banging on doors, get someone to call an ambulance. Then he caught sight of a woman walking towards him. "Hello, ma'am?” Shane jogged towards her, waving an arm. “My friend is hurt. May I borrow your mobile to call an ambulance? Or could you call an ambulance? Please?" He tried to be as calm and non-threatening as possible, he didn't want this woman to fear him.
"You can put your arms around me." John said.
I stared trying to comprehend him. “John? John’s not here.”
"Nothing – just the ...I haven't played in a while." Sherlock changed the subject. "Your leg is bothering you."
“Mary.” It was John, his voice soft. “You really did all that for me? Re-made yourself?”
"Can't you tell me what you suspect?"
“Well... what do we know about him? He was army... maybe someone he served with has seen or heard from him?” I warmed to this idea. “And there are any number of bases – and barracks! – in and around London. I could make some enquiries...”
Sherlock was laughing now. They stood close – too close. They were of a height, so when Vaachaspati leaned in to whisper in Sherlock's ear, it was graceful. Sherlock put his hand on the man's bicep... and rubbed his arm as they talked and laughed. Vaachaspati took the cigarette from his own lips and held it to Sherlock's, his fingers against Sherlock's mouth. He held it until Sherlock had taken a deep drag, then returned it to his own mouth.
“But it was all a set up. Charles Magnussen was there, lying in wait, and Eugénie ... and they knew who I was!”
Moran stared back for a long, tense moment. Then he nodded. “Nige, give them a ride…”
"Oh" He eyed me, his vulnerability painfully apparent. "What does that mean?"
Then Sherlock pulled away. He abruptly pushed John off his lap and stood up. “I’m sorry, John… I can’t do this. I can’t be distracted right now!” Sherlock cried out, a touch of desperation in his voice, and stalked off to his bedroom.
“You lured him out.”
, it’s... more …manipulative.”
When they finally got there, when they were up the three flights of stairs and Sherlock had picked the lock on the door – John’s keys were in the rucksack he had abandoned on the street – they stood inside and held each other for several minutes.
John applied a generous amount of lube to his cock and lined it up with Sherlock’s arsehole.
But he smiled faintly at Mary and spoke to her with animation...
There were four bodies on the ground now – the two the stocky woman had taken out, the City Boy John had punched, and the doorman. The doorman grabbed the next Alpha, a tall woman with a graceful bun, and pulled her to the ground as well. The man behind her started kicking them both and the man behind him shoved them all towards John.
John was in there somewhere. His John. He had to go to him.
John was breathing shallowly, his eyes glazed over with the pleasure of Shane's hot tightness pressing in on him, that increased as Shane lifted up and began to ride John's cock, fucking himself on it aggressively. This wasn't a position they used often – Shane usually wanted John on top of him, said he liked the weight, liked the way it felt to have John fuck him that way. Their coupling was athletic and energetic.
He’s asking permission to look at me, Sherlock realised, simultaneously thrilled and offended. John felt his ambivalence, clearly, and shared it.
“How did I do?” He asked. “I usually get something wrong.”
“Mycroft!”
Mycroft scoffed. “Little chance of that.”
“What should I write next?”
I edged back into the stairwell. "They're watching." I said. "HE'S watching."
Sherlock returns to London and to John.
Sherlock watched silently, trying to hide the tremors in his hands. What had happened to him?
I felt him shaking – it was different than the shivering. I looked at him in concern. “Are you… crying?” I asked, seeing tears on his face.
They had both gotten birth control jabs, John noting the responsibility shouldn’t lay entirely on Sherlock’s shoulders – not to mention that Omega birth control was notoriously fallible. He’d even bought some Alpha condoms – Sherlock had scoffed and hidden them in the skull. Not that he need bother, they’d be forgotten as soon as his heat began in earnest.
Sherlock waited until the nurses moved the woman away and peered into the room. A middle aged man lay peacefully on the bed – he could be asleep except for his pallor and the stillness of his chest, it didn't rise and fall with the regular breath of sleep. Sherlock picked up his chart. Simon Fraser had had pleurisy caused by pneumonia. He'd been treated with antibiotics and ibuprofen. He was indeed on the mend. Or had been.
"But you changed his mind." Sherlock said. "He was your lover."
"Him? Or her?"
John, in his ignorance, tried to comfort me. He held me close and stroked my head. He made soothing noises and dropped chaste kisses on my brow.
"But how? HOW!?" I demanded. "I have to get rid of it! Otherwise how do I go home? How do I go back?"
“No... no – well, not PLANNING on it.”
“He did – he was brilliant at it. I’m perfect for you, John – Jim remade me into the perfect partner for you. When we kissed, I know you felt it too.”
John bristled instinctively at Mycroft taking an aggressive stance, Sherlock’s fear that his brother would take him from John fueling his inborn hostility.
“Could you...”
I climbed onto him, lining our cock up. “John... I want you to fuck me." I told him. “I need to feel you.” I needed the closeness, needed to be joined to him completely.
John's shoulder and hand began to cramp. He wasn't certain how long he'd been performing CPR – long enough to have lost count of the cycles. He was tiring – this was so much harder without two hands, two arms. He concentrated on pressing hard enough on Sherlock's chest...
“That’s pretty flimsy.”
"Because heroin is HELPING you with your 'personal thing?' Seriously, Sherlock, is it helping at all?"
Happy New Year, one and all!
"Sherlock, you do understand..."
"Yep?"
Or maybe he could... Lestrade called on his own reserves of strength and good-nature, building it up, projecting it...
“Mycroft was trying to do right by you, you ungrateful brat!”
He was losing it, all his control.
John scoffed. "No. He had almost no idea what he was doing. He was a virgin, you know."
"Erm... two men tried to stick up a pub - I was there with my cousin. John subdued one of the men. Moran helped my cousin with the other bloke. I remember the green coat. It was so... unusual."
Mary paused, searching for the right words. “Fun.” She said. “He was tremendous fun. He had adventures... he loved games – he played them all the time... that’s how we met, he got me involved in a game he was playing. I think if I‘d met him any other way, I would have told him to naff off. But I was completely charmed.”
"Why?"
Sherlock struggled to feel his own body. He found his pulse with frigid fingers, it was sluggish. He raged – his body was shutting down... dying... John was dying... oh god, that hurt worse than the sharp, drilling pain in his shoulder...
“Tell them...” John gripped the copper’s arm. “Tell them Sherlock’s in the basement, there’s an office. You need to secure files and computers.”
John shrugged. "That sort of 'help' hasn't been ... possible..."
"He was going to send me away!" The boy snarled. "I couldn't let him do that!"
Sherlock
“It didn’t end well?” I ventured.
Sherlock set the letter carefully on the table. "It's yours, you can do with it what you will." He sat still, looking at John, willing him to speak, or shout, or hit him, or DO SOMETHING. Anything. But John was silent, his eyes shadowed.
For once, he didn’t protest. I went to work on his beautiful cock. It had been so long since I’d had cock in my mouth – let alone John’s – I wanted it to last. I edged him, bringing him right up to the brink then pulling back, slowing down, then taking him to the brink again. John allowed it, sensing maybe, how much I needed this. I sucked him until my jaw throbbed, until my throat was quite raw, and my neck began to ache. When I finally brought him off, John clutched my shoulders and cried out my name. I carefully preserved and filed every nuance – the exact pitch of John’s voice, the texture of his emission, the way his hip felt under my hand. I would have this memory, bright and clear, to sustain me through the months to come.
He WAS afraid. The numb covered it. The heroin eradicated it. The pain lived within it.  Sherlock was afraid.
"Moriarty?! What does he have to do with anything?" I'd caught him off guard.
“You can do it, lad!” He encouraged. “Just... hook your leg over...”
“Sherlock doesn’t really have anyone else.” John told Angus. “He’s… challenging. Most people don’t take to him. That’s all it is.”
She stumbled and John, lightning fast, caught her, one hand on her elbow, the other her waist.
“You’ll want this.” He said, hefting his own. He opened the door and cold rain gusted into the hall. I pulled my hood up and fastened it under my chin. We started out.
"A little."
“No, no. Not necessary. Thanks.” The Alpha turned away with a self-satisfied look that John wanted to beat off his face.
Mycroft opened his mouth as if to reply, thought better of it, nodded once and proceeded down the stairs.
Inside hospital I heard Mycroft’s imperious voice. I stifled a sob – I hadn’t thought to hear him again. His orders and directives sounded like childhood... like home ... I steeled myself for his scrutiny, knowing I’d see my failure in his eyes. It didn’t matter – much. As long as he didn’t tell John, it didn’t matter.
He moved down the couch and began rubbing one of John’s feet briskly, dismayed by how cold and white it was. “He needs fluids.” Sherlock addressed Moran as he approached. “Tea, juice – juice would be perfect.”
It wasn't five minutes before there was a knock on the door. It was Ianto with a bottle of paracetamol and a glass of water. "I'll bring dinner soon." He told me as he handed over the medication. I thanked him.
Sorry this one took so long! I'm working on another, it should come more quickly than this.
"You have?"
“She will be, I think. I’m headed there this evening. My father is with her now.”
Mycroft shoved at Lestrade’s trousers. “Get these off.”
"He's the one that... " Gereth took a breath, puffed himself up with bravado. "I don't know why he's still here. No one wants him here."
The Alpha laughed – a shocking noise after their intense conversation. Sherlock found himself smiling along with the shorter man. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d smiled
“Dr. Watson?”
As he kissed Sherlock's face and encouraged him to cum, John thought about what a responsibility it was, this brilliant man's love. What a trust he had been given. It didn't frighten him now, or make him feel resentful, it felt right. Sherlock's proposal made complete sense now. Maybe later it wouldn't, it might confuse and anger him again. But in this moment, John understood. And he agreed.
I sighed. “Fine. When?” Today, I thought! Face-to-face I could question him at length. He had to tell me something!
It had happened so fast. Yesterday morning Lestrade had gone to work as usual. The uniforms had been talking about some weird calls — an unusually high number of assaults and attacks on coppers when they tried to intervene. By noon, it was clear that something was very wrong — the attacks, by people of every class and profession, had increased exponentially and the ranks of uniformed police began to thin.
“I know I’m being ridiculous.” John had admitted. “But after being kidnapped and threatened by an insane person – who
Sherlock stared at her. He didn’t know her at all, he realised. His mother was a stranger to him.
“No, of course I’m not.” Sherlock felt his Alpha’s relief, but John showed no sign of it. He still stood assertively between Sherlock and his brother.
"God, I love you! I bloody love you, Sherlock." John whispered. "And I... I WANT you! It's not decent how much I want you. Your skin, your mouth... I want to kiss you... touch you... your back arched, your beautiful arse pushing back, desperate for my cock... the way you want me, like there's nothing you've ever wanted more..."
John moaned appreciatively. He pulled back again and this time slid in more easily to the root. He began to fuck more steadily, pulling all the way out occasionally to let Sherlock take a gasping breath. Sherlock fisted his own prick as John began fucking his mouth in earnest, and his other hand crept into John's crack to finger the tight bud he found there. His own hole throbbed with want.
I opened my mouth to speak… but I didn’t know what to say. I had nothing to say to Mycroft. I couldn’t look away from John. I wanted to go to him, but his expression kept me rooted to the spot.
"I'm happy you're feeling better." I said. Sherlock scowled. "You have your microscope out, you're looking at slides..."
"You still think someone switched out Dad's will?" Gereth asked. "Who? Why?"
The hall was longer and larger than our entire flat. There was a stairwell at the far end and large oak doors on both walls. The fine Persian carpet on the floor showed minimal signs of wear and the grandfather clock was pristine.
“Mummy…” Mycroft attempted to interject.
Sherlock was furious – at himself as much as at Mycroft. He should have known his brother would use his trust fund as a wedge between he and John. He’d used it to try to control Sherlock for years.
I called her.
Lestrade had noticed Mycroft looking at him appraisingly before. The first time he hadn’t been certain — it was
Only the guards had guns. But they wouldn’t come into Vinokourov’s territory. Not for me.
“How about after a few more of these?” I hefted my empty glass and signaled the bartender.
You know I'm not good with these sorts of things – love and everything that goes with it. But it appears I have no choice in the matter. I love you. I said that already. Sorry. You are wonderful and amazing and I can't function without you. If you want sex, I can give that to you – I've been studying videos online and I feel confident I can perform adequately.
“Yes. And a friend. And... like a brother to me – he looked out for me the way you do for your sister. Like Sherlock’s brother...” She trailed off.
“Granddad?”
“But... that’s not right. I HAD to take care of Moriarty’s people... but now...”
"Leave it, Bruno - there will be plenty of time for blame after we get John back."
John arranged himself carefully in the single bed, making sure his stump had enough room. He matched his breath to Sherlock's and closed his eyes, trying to fall asleep .
"You ruin EVERYTHING!" I shouted at Mycroft, aware that I'd never sounded more like a fourteen year old than right then.
"And Lestrade is just Lestrade."
"So... what? You're searching for redemption?"
Another chapter soon!
"That's not all we did."
It took about an hour to make my calls. When I emerged, it was lunchtime and the four cleaners (who did not live in) were eating at the long table in the former servant's hall.
"You have no idea what you're talking about."
“Good.” I thought about the timing, I didn’t want to shoot up too soon. “When are they coming?”
Lestrade swore. He retrieved the gun and shoved it in one of his own pockets. Then he helped Sherlock sit, dragging him to the van and propping him there amongst the blood and bodies. The copper commenced to search the Alphas, finding phones and eventually keys.
“Jesus, it’s weird, you smelling like that.” Lestrade said. “Where are we going?”
John heard movement in the room. He started back to bed, thinking Sherlock had finally returned. And came face to face with Nurse Measing. She looked pale and foreboding in the dim hospital room, her rosy cheeks and curvy figure erased in the gloom.
We found seats on the train and collapsed into them. John put his arms around me and drew me close and we slept like that all the way to London.
"You mean the OTHER man stalking John?" Shane asked pointedly.
"I can't..." John had trailed off.
John brushed my too-short fringe back from my face. "I think we have to set that aside for now. Until we're certain you're completely healed physically."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Heroin. Obviously.” My stomach cramped again and I couldn’t stifle a moan. “I want to die.”
Sherlock put John to bed and shed his own kit expediently. He climbed in – John appreciated that he'd stripped all the way this time, he liked the feeling of Sherlock's pale skin against his own. John was still slightly damp, his hair making a bit of a spot on the pillow.
I’d turned on the telly earlier. The news was on and I listened with half an ear. Sherlock began to knead the muscles of my neck and shoulders and I melted under his strong hands.
“I have it here.” She said, going to the desk. She unlocked a drawer and lifted out a folio of papers. She laid it open on the desk. “This is the will that Owen – Owen Hughes, the estate’s lawyer – had. He swears it's the one my father gave it to him.”
That stopped his edgy fidgeting. He turned into me, melting helplessly in my arms. I kissed him soundly – in this, at least, he was like the Sherlock I knew. The full lips, the taste of him, the sweep of his tongue – all that was unchanged. I savoured it for long moments, putting all my love and care for him into my kisses.
"A friend you were in love with."
Sherlock felt an anvil fall off his chest, an anvil he hadn't even known was there. His arms tightened around John's sturdy form and his lips found John's neck. The way he smelled – it was heady, it was a drug. It was the best drug. Heroin had nothing on this. Sherlock felt John shudder gently into sleep. He almost cried with the joy of it.
. You’ve all met someone like that? Someone you wanted to stay far away from as soon as you smelled him?”
“Good.” Sherlock said. “You would be foolish not to be afraid of her. When I heard she had taken you in, I was afraid for you.”
No message from John either.
"Mm." Sherlock remembered the disastrous first meeting with the prosthetist – it had pushed an already depressed John over the edge into utter despair.
John sighed. “Come to bed.” He said with a hint of resignation. “We can talk again in the morning.”
Sherlock sipped his and sighed. “I miss everything about London.” He gazed at me over the rim of his mug. “I want to come home. I want to be with you, John. The time I lived with you, it was the happiest of my life. All of it.”
Lestrade nodded. “Some, like Molly, are back at home – their families had been out of their minds with worry. But the bulk of them were sold by their Alpha guardian to a corporation that seems to be one of Moriarty’s fronts. A care agency is looking for permanent homes for them, but it’s difficult. Happily, we’ve found a good interim solution.”
John chooses not to choose.
"Shane blamed me for the same reason I blamed myself – if I hadn't dragged you into my investigations, if I'd stayed away...."
The security door buzzed, and Sherlock entered the building. He walked up to the topmost floor and knocked.
It was a strange thing and I had to admit I did not like it. But it would serve its purpose, I thought, quite well. In the meantime, I shoved it into a corner and covered it with one of Mrs. Hudson's clean linens - I didn't want to frighten her with it. I stowed the crate and packings neatly in the mud room.
I washed my hair quickly and rinsed it for a long time. I hated the scent of prison shampoo. Nazer’s pillow stank of it. I longed to bury my face in a pillow that smelled of John...
However, if it's going to ruin your life to realise that sometimes a top will bottom – on a whim or to help care for his traumatised boyfriend – then you should skip this chapter. Actually, just skip the rest of the story. If you don't like the tea, don't drink it.
Sherlock laughed feeling John’s amusement through the link. That was the best thing, how his Omega had relaxed and opened over the last few days, allowing John’s laid back good humour to influence his less happy moods. Sherlock was less anxious and more confident with every hour that passed.
As far as the stages of grief were concerned, I was stuck firmly between denial and anger with a large helping of depression capping it off. I still wasn’t sleeping much and food... food tasted like cardboard and sat like wet cement in my stomach. I needed a job, but I was incapable of focusing long enough to find one, let alone to do it.
“Yeah. The Laddie Ten. Not the oldest, but one of their best.”
"Mm." John took another swallow of beer. It was his favorite kind. "Isn't this what we did on our first date? Sit on your couch drinking beer?"
He had gone home with Shane and the two mild-mannered, regular blokes had left a trail of clothes to the bedroom where John had bent Shane over the bed and fucked him just the way Shane liked it.
“Jim groomed you for John.” I said before John could say anything.
"Shane...?"
Abruptly there was a knock on the door.
She left me alone and I heard her talking softly with someone else.
“I’ll take you home.” Greg said. I let him.
“He thinks you’re dead, brother mine, and apparently, he was quite attached to you. How do you expect him to look?”
It couldn't be worse. If John were the surgeon, he'd have already scheduled the surgery to take the hand. Not that John would EVER perform surgery again.
“Mother said you were one of her students.” Molly said.
Disagreeing with Dad was talkbalk. Standing up for yourself was talkback. If Dad had had enough beer, talkback got you slapped.
“Omegas get a shit deal. I’d probably drink too if I were an Omega.”
however misguided his actions. Was this scheme of Mummy's – to throw a soiree to introduce the 'respectable' Alphas to the rescued Omegas – misguided? He didn't know. Many of the Omegas had expressed a desire to bond in the abstract. Perhaps this was the best way to give them the opportunity. But he was deeply distrustful of his mother's motivations... and Mycroft... he was embracing the scheme wholeheartedly, vetting the young Alphas himself, putting them through rigorous checks... but he had approved of Moriarty. Had he learned enough from that experience to be trusted?
“Where did you get a cigarette?!” I asked striding towards him.
“Ngh.” Mycroft was pleasingly vocal. It surprised Lestrade. He hoped he was a screamer in bed — that was always good for the old ego. Lestrade redoubled his efforts scraping his thumbnail over the erect nipple, enjoying how Mycroft arched into his touch.
“Exactly!” Bill crowed. “Walk like you got a big’un in yer pirates!
“I wrote it before I knew ….” Sherlock couldn’t bring himself to acknowledge John’s boyfriend aloud.
John really did have to free himself, and quickly. This man – Moriarty, his name was Moriarty – his motivations could only be nefarious. John couldn’t help but panic a little, feeling the loathsome, nauseating touch in his hair again.
“Ok, time to stand up.” John said, supporting him once again. It took a moment, but eventually Sherlock was standing, an arm over John’s shoulders keeping him upright. He was very conscious of John’s arm around his waist.
Sherlock tapped his foot impatiently.
"No, no, never mind." I swallowed the paracetamol and sipped some of the tea. It had been sweetened the way I liked it.
Victor finally found us. "Gereth!" He cried and knelt by the boy, cradling him in his arms. I saw no harm in it – they wouldn’t see each other again. I could see that Victor was resigned to his fate. He loved the boy – and I believe he had loved me – but he knew it was wrong.
He couldn’t even kill himself without hands to open the bottle of pills or pick up a razor to open a vein, or pick up a gun…
Sherlock’s face changed immediately – keen interest replacing amusement.
Sherlock pulled away from me. This time I let him. “I’ve been undercover, infiltrating one of Moriarty’s cells – one of the biggest.” He said. “I had to... I needed to be accepted by the other men... trusted...“
“Are you saying that you were smarter than he was?” The words were bland, but Sherlock saw Moran’s outrage plainly in the slight tightening of his jaw.
“Alfred?” The Omega boldly stepped up to John. “She’s almost conscious.” John observed. Can you hold onto her again?”
“I want to bond with you.” Sherlock said. “Please.”
"Give me your arse." John growled.
He tightened his fist around my cock as he stroked. "Oh yeah. Let me suck you, Sherlock. I need to taste you."
“I’ve wanted to do this for so long.” Sherlock said softly. “I tried to imagine what it would feel like to touch you this way.”
"Mycroft...."
Sherlock shot him a sharp look. “I’m unwashed and sticky and I have a big cock stuck up my arse.” He retorted. John smiled at the rush of fondness Sherlock sent through their bond with the words.
John groaned. “It’s disgusting to think that thing is still there... is it? Still there?”
Sherlock, to his credit, got the door closed in an instant — mostly closed. There were arms caught between it and the door jamb, arms with snapping teeth right behind them, pushing the door open again.
!” John groaned. He grasped the waistband of Sherlock’s pyjama pants and yanked them down, lifted Sherlock’s legs and pulled them off entirely. He took advantage of Sherlock having his legs in the air, pressing them down onto Sherlock’s chest and letting his erection bump at his Omega’s slick opening.
Despite its size the flat was close and warm. I felt sweat prickling under my arms.
“We’ll see how it affects you this time. The dose is pretty low.” Sherlock said, examining John’s chart.
He endeavored to empty his mind of all the tumult the meeting with John had caused him. He tried to focus only on the man watching John.
“You do not eat. You do not smile. You do not take an interest in your fellows. You do not bother with sports or hobbies. You look tired as if you do not sleep.” She enumerated. “I’d want to do a little blood work first, of course.”
“You asked
I had never loved a man, never expected to – not like this. Could I? Did I already?
"Mariah, I'm not interested."
“Moriarty delegates. He wouldn’t get his hands dirty like this. We need to check out that boat.”
“Mary!” John exclaimed. “What are you doing?!”
“You don’t know...”
“The same.”
"What is the point?"
“Sherlock, please.” He said, shaking her hand.
I didn’t think about Mary again. She truly was out of sight, out of mind. Until a week later when she called.
“When is that last time you ate?” He asked — the younger man hadn’t eaten anything at Baker Street.
My sister stared at me, the words slowly penetrating her truculence. “This has something to do with Sherlock.” She observed.
Sherlock was still up...
"Does she know you're back?" Shane asked. "I didn't say anything."
“It’ll fade – they both will. In about five minutes it’ll be just noticeable enough.”
Sherlock didn’t answer. Which either meant he was somewhere without a signal, or he got my text and simply wasn’t deigning to answer.
He was right. “I’m just so tired.” I said.
“I think I can smell her from here.” John cracked.
Sherlock was still transmitting tension as he fiddled with the cube of bottled water. He was nude, his slim form effortlessly elegant. His dark hair and pale skin made a striking contrast, highlighted here and there with a rosy pink – on his nipples, his cheeks, his arse and the head of his cock. John got up and went to him, folding his Omega in his arms. The younger man melted into him, pressing himself almost helplessly to John’s chest.
It was strangely quiet in the emergency ward, dim and seemingly abandoned. John looked for Sherlock's examination room – it was one of the curtained enclosures granting privacy to a cot and equipment cupboard. John wandered freely down the corridors, peering behind curtains until he found the familiar figure lying prone on a cot.
Sherlock knew he didn't deserve a second chance, but he had let himself believe that John would give him one anyway. He had to adjust his expectations before talking with John. And he needed to rewrite the letter.
"A beer would be great, yeah." He said. "It's been non-stop today. I don't think I sat down once."
John... I don’t doubt your commitment to... to us. But it’s just biology – it’s instinctual for you to want to protect and care for a pretty woman, especially one in danger...”
“I don’t begrudge you.” Sherlock’s voice was even, unemotional.
(See the end of the chapter for
“He’s nobody, John. Mycroft pays him to keep tabs on me.”
An open laptop lay at his feet in the pool of fluids.
“Lestrade!”
“I’m afraid that deduction is notoriously unreliable where sentiment is concerned.” He said ruefully.
Then he met Sarah Sawyer. John was serious that time. But they broke up as well. On the sixty-ninth day. Then Jeanette. All ended disastrously
After a truly embarrassing stare that lasted for almost a minute, he got up, and dragged me along by my coat collar. I was stumbling on the outstretched legs of the people at the cinema, but John looked so angry so I dared not make a sound.
Each day you grew wearier,
No, loneliness
So, he would like laughter around him, therefore I could not cry in front of him. I did not want to make his burden heavier. I didn’t want him to think that he had broken my heart. I patted his gravestone, just as how I patted his shoulders when we solved a crime together in the past. In the best of times.
(Sherlock)
And my deduction was never wrong, the two were indeed going for a film, and I, disguised as some ordinary passer-by, also bought a ticket and got seated right next to John.
“I got the idea that this sort of thing,” John made a hand gesture in the air between the two, “was not your area.”
And we can try if texting is possible under certain circumstances.
“Or what?”
Judging by your good mood, you should be having another round now, shouldn’t you?
When we arrived at Scotland Yard, Lestrade was indeed, waiting. Upon seeing him, Sherlock immediately grabbed my hand and kissed it. Lestrade was shocked. Well, news hasn’t spread as fast as I had expected. At least Lestrade was still left in the dark about our relationships. But soon enough he seemed to understand, Sherlock was really protective and was always eager to show to everyone that I was his boyfriend, or more like a pet, actually. Erm, I don’t mind that, really.
With a thud he fell,
“Sherlock?” Mycroft shook my shoulder. “Are you listening?”
I never meant anything to him.
But a voice in his head begged to differ. “You were interested at first, but he told you he wouldn’t love anyone, male or female. You were hurt. You tried to lift his mask, but he locked you out. So you fool yourself that you love Greg. But you don’t.”
. Sherlock had to be bored of him. Sherlock had to hate him. Sherlock had to leave before that dreadful day came when John would do something dreadful.
Holy sh… I. Don’t. Need. To. Know. THAT!
Sherlock still did not give up. John charged towards the icy walls and banged his head against it. Blood instantly dripped from his forehead, along his cheeks, leaving trails of reddish lines on his face.
“Captain? Captain Watson? There is a ship to our south, about 250 miles away. It’s sailing towards us!” The petrified Lieutenant rushed to John.
A cruel-looking armed man who had been tailing behind the criminal suddenly walked out, holding a blood-dripping whip. He readied himself about ten feet in front of John and was about to whip him, when Moriarty held out a hand and stopped him. “We’ve just recruited a new man, haven’t we? Sherlock, it’s your go now.” He handed the whip to Sherlock.
Holmes’s razor sharp gaze went up and down Greg, with the tiniest smirk on his face. John observed Holmes’s appearance. He’s much taller than me, he thought sadly. But that big fat nose, tiny eyes? He looked like a rat. Greg wouldn’t seriously pick him over me, would he?
“And suddenly the work doesn’t seem to matter as much. You have got a new hobby. However, you know, as a
I had been contacting the woman for a few times, and got regular updates on John’s life. He hadn’t changed much, still my cute doctor and my cute blogger.
Sherlock looked at me like a puppy discovered doing naughty things by its master, wagging its tail and begging for forgiveness. His eyes soften and was red and swollen. He was trying to speak, but he just gulped those words down.
During Greg’s busy visits to his neighbors for news of Mycroft, John always followed and was enthusiastic, or so it would seem. “I’m more than happy to help you, my friend, to find your lifelong happiness.” He always said to Greg, who, sadly, didn’t seem to be as close to John as before.
What’s in his mind all the time? Moriarty wondered. He wanted to peel his prisoner’s scalp open and take a good look at the amazing world underneath.
At university, John dated a girl called Anne. It went well at first, they dated out, hugged, and kissed like normal couples. Their relationship had been going on for over two months, but on the sixty-ninth day since they met, they broke up. Because John had fallen in love with another girl. John didn’t know how it happened, he was walking down the streets to the laundry when he saw a teenage girl, very beautiful and everything. Her name was Teresa. He stopped for a chat. She flirted. He was tempted. And on the sixty-ninth day, Anne found out. She was so sad and so disappointed. John was so sorry. But it was too late.
And now he wanted me to be dead. He asked me to kill myself. I thought this was the least thing that I could do for him. I couldn’t help him with his worries, his injuries, his pain, so at least I could take my own life and cause him no further trouble.
Lines of sweat rolled down along Sherlock’s face. He must act, now, as Moriarty was sure not kidding. Sooner or later, he would take his revenge for the sake of the sufferings of Sebastian Moran.
John quickly grabbed his telescope. Not good, he said to himself. He saw the Jolly Roger flying on the ship. Pirates.
Laughing, the man in the Westwood suit fished a key out from his pocket and knelt down to unlock the chains from John’s wrists and ankles. The metal, still damp from blood, old and fresh, fell onto the floor with a loud bang.
late?” John said. He was so very tired.
But the name belongs to a dead man.
(See the end of the chapter for
Anyway THIS IS IMPORTANT: Listen, I don't reli know how Moriarty could survive and be alive after the Reichenbach's fall, and dont ask me why he isnt dead. I HAVE NO IDEA.
I was breathing hard, and I did not want to make a huge fuss at the cinema, but I was so angry, so angry.
Shaking his head Moriarty looked amused. “Look at you, kitten. So defenseless, weak and foolish. No, I won’t lock you up, Sherlock, that’s not fun. Beating people is boring, except when I use it as a bait to lure you out. We’re in for something exciting!”

Greg’s phone.
They are at their little Baker Street flat. Sherlock is shuffling around, looking for something anxiously. John watches him, amused.
Sherlock had tried talking to John, but was returned a blank face, or even, a face with hints of sadness.
“Says I.” A figure was standing by the doorframe. The frame was blocking the light and I couldn’t see clearly the man’s face. He stepped into the light, and… it was him. It was John.
John busies himself with tidying the house, trying to forget what has happened.

At the mention of his name, Sherlock lifted his head up. “Haven’t you just passed out?” John asked confused.
John was really anxious. He started to understand the whole thing. So the
Moriarty took a revolver from his back pocket and aimed it at John. But he said, “Oh I should have known better…” and aimed it at Sherlock instead. “Put the gun down.”
Greg became a police officer, and John became a doctor. Both were not wealthy men, so they shared a flat. A week later, a man in an expensive-looking suit called on.
He had absolutely no idea where he’d sail.
“Oh, brought your date with you, haven’t you, Sherlock?” Angelo welcomed them warmly.
say John is a psychopath. He deserves much more than that.
“Yes I did. I was watching you, because I worried that you would do unwise things. Like this. Without me, you’d probably be dead by now.”
But one in particular,
What was
After a while, Mary came out from the room with a smile. I half-expected her to tell me what she had been doing inside. But well, she didn’t.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock woke up, feeling the cold. He licked his lips and tasted the copper taste of blood. His brain was skimming through a list of explanations on why his lips were bleeding, and the word "John" just shot out. Damn, Sherlock thought. He shot open his eyes and realized that he was in some kind of chamber.
Three days and he hadn’t scream. How many more days until Sherlock was driven mad? It was a major disruption to Moriarty’s plan. All the delicate works, the tools, the melodrama, was just his experiment to see how much Sherlock could bear. This
Said you could take it no more.
Yet, the sweet, blissful numbness that follows.
I couldn't breathe.
John is the best man I have ever known. Despite his fairly average intelligence.
I realized that the only person who could answer my questions was Mycroft. For Christ’s sake I hated to consult him, but I guessed I had no other options now, did I?
Five days later, they went out to investigate on a case. Still uneasy about the curse, John asked Lestrade to come with them.
John did not take it immediately, as he allowed himself some time to think. But Moriarty was impatient, and he picked a knife from the table and stabbed Sherlock on his back. A pained muffled scream came out from his mouth.
He was sitting on the deck, watching the waves hitting his ship again and again. The sea was vast, blue, and miraculous. He stared, hoping that the sea could soothe his troubled heart.
“Beep beep!” Went my alarm. “Eleven o’ clock, time to wake Sherlock.” The words blinked on my phone screen. In these two years, I had not changed anything. Not even the hundreds of alarms that I set up just for my annoying flat mate.
I picked up my phone and called him.
Alright, alright. Don’t bother explaining. I won’t get it either way.
I chuckled at this madness. “Look, John. I am so sorry to have caused you so much trouble, and it’s okay if you don’t want to see me anymore, I…”
Good evening. I see quite a party going on here. –MH
PS: Sherlock is getting really nervous. He had been googling the ceremony procedures all day. He urges me to practice with him every day, and I have to practice waltz with him too. Please, guys, help me calm him down. He is making me anxious too.
He waited for the young man to stop and to talk to him. But before he could even introduce himself, his whole life story was being read out by a stranger, who claimed to know everything about John just by how he was standing. This Sherlock was unbelievably rude, just like a child. And he certainly did not possess normal social skills, John thought disapprovingly.
After dinner… it’s going to be a wild night. -MH
I may write another chapter of pure fluff to end this. Please let me know what you think in the comments and tell me if you want a fluff chapter (I've got a feeling no one will comment bleh)
, Doctor Watson.”
Of course Sherlock isn’t asleep yet, he thinks to himself. Of course Sherlock has heard his screams. Of course Sherlock will give him weird looks tomorrow, John thinks miserably.
I knelt on the pavement,
Mycroft Holmes walked John to his flat. He was weak, but he was fine.
Oh yes, John! What happened to him? Although I didn’t like to admit, I did feel a little guilty for leaving him alone. I felt close towards him. He didn’t call me a freak. And I still remembered how his eyes widened, and his jaw dropped, when I first showed off my deduction skills to him. “Wow, amazing!” He said, with a voice very curious indeed. I quite appreciate his exclamation. That’s why I consider him a very good partner. He was so, plain and normal, average IQ, cute.

New chapter coming : D
“Then we certainly have to thank him.”
“Well… I’ll be at Scotland Yard to sort out a case. Will be back for dinner. Bye.” With that Sherlock leaves. Five minutes later he is fully dressed and leaves the flat.
Finally he let go of me. “What the hell was happening?” I asked.
In the past few months I had never had the courage to visit the places which Sherlock and I often went together. And that meant a hell lot of places, the library, the train station, millions of restaurants, etc. But now with Mary, I felt refreshed. I was a new man. She transformed me from a poor grieving man to a cheerful lad, determined to get my life right.
It had always been a wonderful sight, seeing a genius break under his heels. The fascinating feeling of crushing that soul, shattering those dreams, it had been Moriarty’s dream come true. And Sherlock, had been the most challenging opponent.
Sherlock was tired of the sea. The sea was deep and hard to understand. Day by day, he felt as if the ocean engulfed his lonely soul bit by bit.
They arrived at the river bank. Across the waters was that abandoned factory that Moriarty used. John took a deep breath. He could do this. He could go to hell again. He could do this for Sherlock.
Impatiently, Sherlock pulled the gag out of his mouth. "For god's sake, let him talk!"
John woke up with a pounding headache. He felt someone tenderly stroking his cheek. Startled, he shot up, only to find an equally startled Sherlock by his side.
They returned to 221B after a case. This case was a really hard one. Sherlock had not eaten or slept for three days. He didn’t even change his clothes before he fell asleep on the sofa. John wasn’t particularly tired, so he decided to sit and watch the telly.
He was furious when the pirates boarded his ship and ruined it. He knew, today this battle would certainly be lost, but at least he wanted to die gloriously. He pulled his sword from his sheath.
His trench coat was soaked red, and he was lying unconscious. I rushed towards him, yelling, crying, and I felt very bad. I was so mean when I said those words to him. I was so mean to leave him in that cinema hall.
Just once can you be helpful
Sherlock put down his cigarette and stood up. “Go away, Mycroft. You’re not helping.”
What was I? A toy? I am not a thing that you play with on your palms.
I stumbled and stood up on my feet, feeling so dizzy with guilt, and I felt weak. I ran towards those men like a drunk, shouting and wailing, but I was immersed in unbearable sadness that I fainted.
. Mental applause to you, John Watson! He thought to himself, sadly.
“The bastard confronted me, I tried to fight him, and we were kind of a draw, but then Geoff came and shot him dead. We called an ambulance and they got you here in the hospital. Luckily, there’s no serious injury on your body. You slept for a few days and everything is mainly healed inside you.”
When your brother knew everything about everyone in the world, he might be useful at times.
“Okay. But first, dinner?”
John tensed up and pressed the gun tip on Moriarty’s head. “Release him, or I will kill you.” John said in his soldier voice, calm and low.
He scanned the room, jotting down every detail he could see, and his gaze stopped at the sight of John. Weak and crumbling, barely standing on his stick. His heart suddenly ached. He had to get John out. It was a dangerous situation.
” Sherlock said between kisses. “Let me in, love me…” Sherlock’s fingers in John’s hair. “For the rest of your life.” Sherlock’s hands on John’s hips. “Don’t ever lock me out again.”
Sometimes I really wonder how you can still type, John…
“I’m… I’m a mess, Sherlock. A failure. There’s so much you don’t know about me.”
An hour later, Sherlock puts his phone down. He stares at John. They look at each other for a while before Sherlock says, “You cut.”
“And maybe I don’t too.” John said softly. Then he left the flat without another word.
Another day had passed and John was still expressionless.
when doing
, he needed someone
That’s not a question. It’s a statement. So John just nods. There’s no point denying. The great detective probably already sees through his mind.
“Kneel.”
Before the great day of revelation, I would like to have some fun.
him, secretly. But one day when we were dealing with a really dangerous criminal, Professor Moriarty, we were, unfortunately, captured by him. He tortured us and eventually put us into some brain-washing machine. I could no longer remember who I was, where I had been, what I was doing, etc. All the things I’ve just told you, were the facts I collected and organized from others’ recounts.”
Normal people, the idiots, would scream their heads off in thirty minutes. Moriarty tapped his feet. But Sherlock, three days and he was still as strong as the metal chest itself. It was dawning on him that he had definitely underestimated Sherlock. He’s got minds of steel.
“Atta boy! Atta boy!” Moriarty walked in, clapping his hands. “Finally! I’ve been waiting for this moment for so long.”
(John)
How you flinched as they pointed their fingers at you,
What the f…
For the first time in forever, I felt truly happy.
Oh! I couldn’t breathe whenever my thoughts were drawn to him. I could not bear to think of our happy memories. That was why I moved out of Baker Street. I could not live at where he had lived with me. Every tile, every brick, reminded me of him.
John sighed. “Sherlock? You know that you can actually say
John nodded briskly. “Thanks.” He mumbled.
Mycroft seemed embarrassed and he backed out from the room. “See, you do have friends. In fact, you have someone much more than friends with you. Ask him, Sherlock, ask him what he feels now, and why he came to my office every day to apologize and wailed loudly about how sorry he was to have hurt you.” Mycroft said playfully.
