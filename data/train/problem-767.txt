Holmes rolled over dramatically, tossing an arm over his eyes and groaning as if he were the loneliest man on earth. John swallowed down his pang of remorse and stood up in a tiff.
Eventually John’s father found out what he was doing and threatened him under no uncertain terms. He would cease his behaviour or he would be cast from their home. John found himself laughing bitterly at his father’s reproach. Once being an outcast would have terrified him. Once being forced to rely on his less-than-capable self for survival had been impossible. Now it was ridiculous to assume that he needed
Then he had me kneel for him and suck him off while he fucked my face. I was so proud when we were through because I’d managed to relax my throat enough to let him thoroughly take me. He was so wrecked after he came that he just sank down and I had to break position and pull him in to straddle my thighs. He wrapped his arms around me so tightly and laid his head on my chest. I stayed that way long after my feet had fallen asleep, just holding him and breathing in his scent. My erection wilted and I can’t recall but I think I went without that night. Whichever it was, just holding him against me was so perfect and beautiful that my throat feels tight just thinking of it. I miss my lord.
there for. Nothing on upstairs, that’s for sure. He’s basically a glorified cabin boy. No one takes his orders, and he’s long since stopped giving them out and just walks around being an arse.”
Lestrade locked the wheel and put his hand out, “What on earth? Why? You’re stranded somewhere than the bottle is more valuable than the letter that will probably never get anywhere. He could have put rainwater in here! Or better yet, fermented fruit!”
John scrambled into them and was about to bolt out of the room when Holmes grabbed his arm and tugged him back.
“No one. We’ve been out for a year. Those interested in men have paired off. Those uninterested won’t touch you. Those uninterested but needy enough to let you touch them will make you pay for it later once they decide that you’re to blame for their indiscretions.”
,” He sounded out, removing his clearly adopted accent, “This ship runs on a two section dogged watch. That means I cook all day and all night. Two big meals and a pot of something always on hand. You log
Holmes rolled him gently on to his side and pulled the laces on his trousers, freeing his aching cock. He let John collapse back on his front and then spread his legs and kneeled between them.
John let out roar as he spilled down Sherlock’s throat, shaking in pleasure as his knees gave out. Sherlock let him sink to the deck and before the doctor was fully recovered from his own mind blowing orgasm the tip of his captain’s hard cock was sliding past his lax lips. John recalled himself and began to suck hungrily, savoring the taste of the precome on the tip and taking Sherlock all the way back into his throat. He choked on him and slid back off. Every ridge and vein was a joy to have caressing his lips and cheeks. He opened his eyes and stared up at Sherlock’s wrecked expression in adoration as to beg for the man’s seed.
“Come along, John,” Holmes soothed, putting a hand around his waist that John was too tired to shrug off.
“I started feeling weak and tired a few months into the voyage. It’s my first time at sea so I just thought it was still seasickness, but everyone else had their sea legs by then.”
John stared at his sack with the single blue chip in it, aware of how many red debt chips it had held earlier. The thought that if he worked hard for the rest of the day hit him and he wondered if he could get his own blanket by the end of the day, and perhaps even a hammock- each cost five pay chips, and the blankets were quality. Except that he was so tired, his limbs weighing twice their normal amount. He wanted to curl up and sleep again. He wanted to
“In and out of consciousness,” Sherlock replied fiddling with the ring on his finger, “From what I’ve read from his journal he was travelling with little water or food and even less sleep. He’s suffering from heat exhaustion, dehydration, starvation, lack of sleep, and several pulled muscles. He nearly worked himself to death to get back to us quickly. He writes here that he feared I would become a monster.”
The man opened the latch and tossed the token back inside while John fumed and despaired. Then he marched off and rang the bell. The next watch was on and in the rush of turnover John was unobserved. He hesitated a moment and then snatched the chip back up again. He headed down to the mess with his chip tight in his hand and dropped it in the sack hanging beneath the slate with his name marked on it. Then he did a double take. His debt was gone. All of the red chips were missing from his bag and the notes that were beneath his name on the slate- reasons and exceptions- had been erased. It couldn’t be a mistake. No one would dare mess with anyone’s chart; a notice was painted above detailing the floggings they’d receive. A mistake? The slate was clearly marked with a ‘+’ but there was no reason listed unless…
“I want you in my bed, yes. I also want you in this sofa, when we’ll cuddle together while watching telly. I want you in my kitchen, looking all prim and proper while I’ll prepare breakfast and pour you a cup of whatever you drink in the morning. I want you by my side on the street, whether you’ll let me hold your hand or not, it’s not important and…”
Even Sherlock’s smile didn’t take the sting out of her words. Joan turned her head away, trying to conceal the embarrassed flush across her face.
“Oh, fuck off, Greg!” Sally answered, glaring daggers first at the other sergeant, then at Sherlock. “I know you’re the Freak’s number one fan…”
And when, at the end of the day, he was sore all over, wincing in pain every time he took a step forward, John couldn’t be bothered complaining. It was a good kind of pain, bringing with it weariness which distracted him from his memories of Sherlock scattered all over the flat. He was sleeping better at any rate, his nightmares being reduced to mere shadows, not powerful enough to wake him up. He still endured bouts of depression and loneliness, but the idea of making a fresh start – even if finding a flat adequate for his needs with his modest means was quite difficult – helped him getting over it.
Inviting herself upstairs with a cup of tea, a carrot cake, glancing at him in a way she certainly considered as stealthy but which didn’t fool him in the least. Ready to pounce on the tiniest clue indicating he wanted to confide to her.
Something so very rare, so very well-guarded that it has taken him months of living together to finally glimpse it.
“Getting in touch with his Pompousness,” Greg replied in a flat voice, doing his best not to give his nerves away. “Trying to see if this mission was truly important. You never know, I might need Sherlock’s input for one of my cases…”
Sherlock took a deep breath, her vulnerability so obviously revealed in her gaze it almost hurt Joan to see it.
Sherlock didn’t waste time, cupping John’s arse in his hands, squeezing his flesh, kissing and licking with a fervour which fuelled even more John’s arousal.
It was only a whisper but John grinned, especially when he could feel Sherlock’s hand stroking once again his hard member at a much slower pace.
It stood to reason to believe that whoever has taken pains to contact him in this way would use the mailbox again. John strode along until he reached the gate of the Islington Community Garden. It was closed at this hour, but of course it didn’t stop him. Earlier today he has spotted a place where some metal bars in the railings enclosing the garden were deprived of their metal spikes – under repair, he heard. After glancing over his shoulder to be sure no one was around, John climbed over them, finding an unexpected and welcome foothold on one of the lower branches of a rhododendron. He jumped off, keeping still as the minutes ticked by. When he was reasonably sure that he was alone – at least in this part of the garden – he started walking towards his goal, a little hideout perfectly located just in front of the mailboxes.
A resolve he has made a thousand times, only to break it as soon as he caught sight of John’s fair head.
He has barely reached the fresh food aisle, feigning to be interested in the special offer on lettuce – “Buy two, get the third free!” – when he felt something cold and hard being shoved into his hand. He instinctively started to turn round to face whoever was standing behind him when a rough voice said “Don’t! He’s waiting for you over there.”
What was even worse was the fact that instead of throwing a fit – with all the dignity he would usually have used, of course – and punishing bloody Gregory’s cheekiness, he has covered him up, taking care that the detective did not catch a cold, before sitting on this sofa and watching over Gregory as a dragon would have done with his treasure.
He knew however he has not imagined the chemistry between Sherlock and him. And above everything – this connection, this feeling of understanding someone and being understood.
And as if this word wasn’t clear enough, he caught again Sherlock’s fingers in his, gently squeezing them; Sherlock couldn’t help letting out a small gasp when he felt John’s thumb lightly stroking the back of his hand. John’s blue gaze turned indigo as he stared at Sherlock’s mouth. The detective felt his heartbeat swiftly increasing.
“What do you mean, there’s only one room left?” John asked with what he hoped was a winning smile, although he doubted it could somehow change the whole situation, which was quickly looking more and more like an impending disaster.
He instinctively reached out, putting his hand on Mycroft’s, who startled a bit before relaxing and turning his hand palm upwards, eliciting a shiver from Greg.
Angelo’s was your typical Italian restaurant – red and white gingham curtains on windows, a lit candle on each table and soft, romantic music broadcasted by the speakers well hidden among the artificial plants. Even the owner, a middle-aged, dark-haired man who greeted them both with a bright smile, a white apron tied around his rotund stomach, seemed to be taken straight from
Something completely mad, something which he believed only happened in those chick movies. You know it’s expected, This obligatory moment where the heroine looks at the man of her dreams in the eye, both of them remaining lost in the gaze of each other, and you just know they’re going to end up all lovey-dovey.
He grabbed the front of Sherlock’s shirt, drawing him closer until there was no space left between them. He stood on his toes, whispering in his date’s ear “Now
He pulled his phone free from his pocket, intending to Google the blue flower next to the camellia, when his eyes were drawn to the tree in front of him.
Where to begin? Maybe with the yew berry identified by Mrs Hudson? And if, John thought, the whole gift has been carved into yew?
The rest of the sentence got lost as Sherlock, without so much as a goodbye, started to walk off in the other direction.
Another gift, then. He wanted to scream with frustration. Which kind of sick fuck was playing hide-and-seek with him? To which end?
“Very true, Johnny. However, if you’d allow me to give you a piece of my mind…” He leaned in, making sure not to be overheard. “Before you go looking out for this kid… sort yourself out, okay? I’d hate to see both of you getting hurt.”
At this point, John realised he was well and truly on his way to being smitten with his unexpected date.
While making love to John’s neck and ear, licking him, branding him as his, Sherlock’s left hand has crept leisurely downwards, rubbing through the thick fabric of John’s woollen jumper his collarbone, his nipples before drawing insistent circles on his stomach. John has instinctively tried to pull in the soft padding on his belly before calling himself an idiot. Who was he trying to impress? It was Sherlock, who knew him like the back of his hand, not some one-night conquest! He let go of everything, garbled sounds echoing in his half-open mouth while waves after waves of pleasure were crashing into him, running over on another until John was nothing else than a total wreck, trembling under Sherlock’s touch.
His brother never rang off – not when he had the opportunity to spar over the phone with him, an exercise both of them would never admit that they still found enjoyable.
“Don’t tell me you haven’t noticed it? For sure it isn’t quite as impressive as some older specimens, but…”
“I fell in love with you, that’s what happened. You’re my friend, my partner, my confidante. My caretaker, if Mycroft is to be believed…”
and Sherlock shivered, instinctively snuggling up in his coat. At this hour, nobody else was out in the streets and the dreary weather was an efficient deterrent for any nosy-body who might have disturbed the discussion which was looming on the horizon for both of them.
He startled, blushing when he realised he has once again lost the thread. It happened more and more often these days, putting a strain on his already scarce social interactions. John knew he should pay more attention to these blank periods, when everything and everyone seemed to dissolve before his very eyes, leaving only memories which were as cherished as they were hurtful to him. However, as for a lot of things in his life, he really couldn’t muster enough energy to care about it.
The endless admiration, the devotion, the loyalty, the desire, lust and love so entwined in his soul he couldn’t resist anymore. Especially when he could feel in Sherlock’s throat, vibrating against his hand, these little, incoherent moans, slipping out of Sherlock’s mouth every time each of them was pulling back to take a breath before delving once again.
“I knew you could be convinced,” Irene said, laughing at his impatience. “Fine, old man. If I catch our man first, you’ll leave your coat and your suit in your flat and let your inner drag queen come to play. And if you are very very good…”
He would leave all of this behind and wouldn’t it be for the best, he thought, trying to ignore the pain spreading across his chest at this very thought.
Numbness cast its spell on him, shielding him from any new attack his mind could plan, and a relieved sigh slipped through Sherlock’s parted lips. He remained like this, lying still on the floor as if he didn’t have strength any more, as if his whole being has been beaten black and blue, for hours, until night has truly fallen.
“I’m afraid not, Sherlock,” Mycroft sighed, “Their pleas are useless without the object of your madness, and I’m afraid he refused to remain here to testify on your behalf.”
“Laziness,” Sherlock replied, “Captain Sal filled me in quite some time ago. A few months ago he started to…”
was getting done and they were listing to port! Molly, AKA First Mate Hooper, was blowing shrilly on her whistle and trying to get everyone to pay attention. Greg joined her by shouting at them and even tried to tug on a few ropes himself before damage was done to the ship. He wasn’t successful and then he heard a loud shout ring up above the rest with a familiar deep voice behind it.
Then he stepped over him and collapsed into the bed… to read. John closed his eyes and fell into an exhausted sleep despite the flickering lantern, but he woke up before the next bell shaking with cold. The cabin was dark, his eyes barely able to discern anything, but warmth was evident when he pulled himself upright by the edge of the Admiral’s bed and felt the ambient warmth from the occupant.
. John packed up what little he owned, collected an inheritance/fee from his father despite the man’s protests, and left with a sack full of his possessions and a firm stance. He walked into an unclaimed portion of the woods, chopped down a few trees with a borrowed axe, and began to build.
“Key to the… you’re as bad as the pirates! People will die!” John tried to shout, but his voice was cracking and only gibberish came out. The man seemed to understand him anyway and smiled wickedly.
John worked his way down, keeping a hand on his hostage. When he got to the kitchens he slipped into them and snatched up all the cooking oil he could find. He took it out saturated the kitchen and hall floor with it, dumping lamp oil on top of it until the room reeked of it. The next step was to empty some stolen gunpowder into a pile in the centre of the hallway. He headed for the doorway and pulled out his gun, took aim, and fired a shot into the powder. Sparks flew and the entire first floor of the lighthouse lit up like a kiln. John shoved Mary out the door first, tugging out her gag and using her as a shield. She screamed and the men outside pulled their guns up to avoid shooting the gravid woman. John continued to plow through them, shouting instructions about putting out the fire as he used the confusion to distract them from his true purpose. With a naked woman in the lead, and what looked like a rich one following after shouting about a fire, John wasn’t surprised that no one took notice of the fact he was a man. They were all scrambling to pry their eyes off of Mary’s tits and refocus them putting out the blaze. Something in the kitchen took that moment to explode and John chuckled as everyone was completely redirected to dealing with the problem at hand.
John lifted each arm one at a time with a gentle caress to the bottom, undid the knot at the front by wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s torso, and slid the chemise over his head. His curls bounced back into place, beautiful as always. Sherlock’s underskirt was knotted so tightly that he had to work it a few times before it finally came free, and then the soft fabric pooled at his feat. John let out a low groan as Sherlock’s pale bottom was shown to him at last. This part of him that never reached the burning sun was almost white and John couldn’t stop himself from dropping to his knees and pressing a kiss to each shapely cheek. When he stood again to move around he found his lover hard for him once more.
“You won’t be getting back home for a year, maybe more. I cut off people in debt once their debt bag becomes full. I’m sure you’d rather not go for eleven or more months without food, blankets, a hammock, and a key to the privy?”
The next strike drew a strangled cry from him and he gave up restraining himself and began to roll his hips in a desperate bid to find friction. He managed to brush his cock up against his own awkwardly placed legs every once in a while to keep himself from going completely insane as the blows continued to rain down on his buttocks, thighs, and back. The flogger was the sort meant to be used for humiliation more than damage, but the leather was still likely to break the skin what with he amount of strikes. He could feel something trickling down the back of his thigh, but he wasn’t sure if it was blood or sweat. He’d never been so grateful for an awkwardly timed erection as he was at that moment.
“We will,” John promised him, “We will build new ships. Better. Recrew them. Bring the new king such an offering that he will bow to
They intend to assassinate the king, but not by actually killing him. They plan to destroy his reputation until the people revolt, but they’ll be doing it by using him as a pawn. They’ve already begun. Apparently they had him sign the plans to build a well in an impoverished town. The well plans were poorly constructed and the well has since become fouled by refuse and poisoned half the town!
“There’s evidence against you, dear brother. It was out in full long before you ever pulled into Tortuga. I even attempted to send them a warning, but it apparently didn’t get through. Your crew- or rather your former crew- turned you in, claiming madness had fallen over you and driven you to such behaviour. They begged me to stop you.”
Victor and Lestrade carefully manoeuvred John into the gig and sat down to row while Sherlock joined them and pulled John’s head into his lap, “John? John? Darling, answer me. Master is here, my pet. Speak to me, John. John?”
“Bless you, you’re trying to protect him,” Sherlock lowered his weapon and gave the man an amused smile, “Yes, John Watson.”
“We’re approaching our prey,” Holmes explained, “Keep a good grip on that rope or something else solid. When we strike the ship it will feel like
and need food in between bells you prepare for it and get an extra bit of bread and cheese or fruit before hand. Got it?”
and I add chips to your debt bag at the end of the day or take out pay chips if you have em. I’m one of only a few people allowed to touch your bag, and don’t you forget it!”
Sherlock sighed. He knew he has been completely obvious, that John’s friends have since a few weeks – since the infamous incident of the Drink Spilled Over John’s Shirt – cottoned on Sherlock’s crush, smirking at him as soon as he set foot in the Honeybee before nudging John, winking at him and whispering in his ear how Sherlock was still looking at him.
Joan drew back a little, shivering with delight when she felt Sherlock helping her removing the shirt. Letting it fall to the ground.
John didn’t want to pry, really, but on the other hand, he couldn’t be satisfied with this kind of answer.
“Damn you to hell, Sherlock, you and your assumptions! Am I only to serve when needed, then? Do you have somewhere a special list of situations which might be far too much for poor little me, according to which you judge it would be better to keep me in the dark and leave me here, fretting about what might happen to you?”
“What do you mean, ‘you need my help’? Dear Lord, John, don’t tell me it’s one of those “you better rush to the rescue” kind of calls! I’m not your permanent “bail me out of jail” card, I have better things to…”
“Certainly. To sum it up, he claimed to have found this so far unknown portrait and to have put inside the box. He also said that if you (he glanced at Mrs Dubusson) didn’t manage to open it at the latest on December 31
There was a sudden shuffle of footsteps on the other side of the door against which John was leaning and during a brief moment, he hoped that his mad genius of a lover would finally come to his senses and open the locked door.
“I didn’t think you could turn out to be even more attractive than I thought, but obviously I was wrong,” John said with a roguish smile.
“I’ve told you – that’s for you to discover. By the way, did you enjoy the gifts? Those were the last ones, you know. After that you’re on your own.”
Goodness, he has nearly forgotten Greg’s self-appointed task to come to Mycroft and try to talk him into letting Sherlock and John come back to London. He swallowed hard as he decided to call the DI. If only it could mean he didn’t have to share a single bed with Sherlock tonight…
“Keep your voice down, brother,” he sharply retorted, “I do not fancy becoming deaf in one ear because of you…”
He was already walking towards her when he stopped “Wait!” He turned to John. “Mate, you’re going to be left alone for the next rotation, then!”
He nipped this protest in the bud, tracing with his tongue the seam of Sherlock’s plushy, made-for-kissing-him lips before opening his mouth and licking his way into Sherlock’s mouth. Had he been not so engrossed in his companion, John would have been a bit ashamed by the way he was pressing himself against Sherlock, his hands instinctively seeking bare skin, slipping under the untucked shirt.
“You really don’t have to apologize,” John whispered, suddenly choked by emotion. He couldn’t help but recognize in Hussein’s voice, vibrant with enthusiasm, the same unadulterated passion which has shone in Sherlock’s eyes until his fall.
As if he has sensed the turn Greg’s thoughts were taking, Mycroft glanced up at him, taking the time to dab his mouth with his napkin.
His eyes blinking at the harsh glow of neon lights, John gasped when he saw Sherlock just in front of him.
Greg ducked his head, truly pleased with himself. Not every day you got to wake up in front of the man pulling the strings and convince him to say.
On a more serious note, I'll be away for a few days, so no update until next week. But don't worry, I promise I'll come back to this story as soon as possible :)
You were the only one and you enjoyed this, savouring each deduction, each discovery like you would sip at a fine wine.
Sherlock put his large hands on his hips, stroking his back, his thighs before inserting one finger into John.
Mrs Dubusson shot him a slight smile, the corners of her mouth quivering a little bit. Behind the tightly controlled mask she has put on, he could sense a powerful emotion welling up in her.
“And getting an addiction to sugar in the process?” Sherlock drily commented. “Thanks but no thanks!”
It makes John want – want to come closer to his friend, reducing the distance between them until it was fading into non-existence; want to put a supporting hand on Sherlock’s back whenever he was retreating within oneself, growing tired of the outside world and his sometimes very limited capacity for tolerance and acceptance; want to tell him “You’re not alone, I’m here with you, we’re in this together.”
He hasn’t considered the fact that by doing so, he has been as blind as the poor fools he loved to make a mock of.
And this whisper sounded like a final confirmation the man he has admired, helped and fallen in love with was alive.
He gave up midway, his mind buzzing with such obscure terms he was quite sure half his teachers at St Bart’s would have been lost as well.
He has now a full memory of kisses - from the soft, tender ones on his forehead to the voracious, greedy embraces which make his heart pound furiously in his chest. Those moments where they were clinging to each other, hands desperately seeking bare skin, slipping under clothes... He shivered.
She ran a nervous hand through her dark hair, biting her lip and smearing lipstick on her front teeth. The sight sent a flash of arousal straight down Irene’s spine.
Why not, after all? Every day you see hearts breaking, friendships crumbling, supposed “mates” betraying one another. You observe the cracks in the
A sharp sound echoing in his heart, as he mourned his stillborn hope of being able to acknowledge his true self, of leaving the closet.
“I’m sorry, John. Mycroft already knew none of my cases was interesting enough to call Sherlock back from… whatever he’s doing now. He saw right through my bluff.”
Nearly the end - I've still got one chapter, because I can't resist torturing Sherlock a little bit more :)
“Kicked to the curb like a bloody dog... Didn’t even give me an honest answer… Should have kissed you then, nothing to lose!”
In a swift second, Sherlock’s face changed, turning from melancholic to animated, an unexpected joy suffusing his features. It wasn’t the expression he usually wore when he solved a case, though. It was something purer, even more enthralling than John has ever seen on his face.
However, he had no time to rekindle the fragile flame of hope. If the young stranger he has encountered in the garden could be trusted, if Lestrade’s gut feeling was correct, then Sherlock was in danger.
It seemed the game was still afoot and in that case, it was better for him to pretend he wasn’t aware of it.
“We currently have 50 plots, which have all been granted at the moment. Actually, I think Emma has received the next to last.”
He quickly undressed before bending down to pull on John’s jeans and let them slide down on the floor, removing his socks in the process.
An instinct which was born of many evenings spent together in the comfortable cocoon of Baker Street, teasing each other, watching crap TV together. The same instinct which has snapped Joan out of her apathy when she has met Sherlock at Bart’s, pushing her to accept to meet her later at 221b.
“I honestly think he’s perfectly able to have concocted such a scheme, just for the pleasure to watch me fail once again. But I can’t be sure, Serge has managed to hurt me so many times before, making me look like a fool. Since I’ve received this box, it’s… eating away at me. To think that I might have an undiscovered piece of art within my reach and to see it being reduced to ashes…”
He reached out without thinking, his fingers grasping as carefully as he could Mycroft’s waistcoat – it was so soft, Greg happily mused, that illusion was so perfect! – and pulling it closer.
Looking for it on Sherlock’s face, when he called John his “conductor of light”, when they laughed together over Indian takeaway at 2 a.m or when Sherlock was deliberately riling up Lestrade’s officers just to make John turn his head away, smothering a grin.
You would think that, with their experience – the company was after all one of the leaders in their market – they would have opted for some originality. Or at least a modicum of good taste.
He can hear him breathing hard, as if he has run all the way from the cold gates of Death til Baker Street’s safe haven. He’s getting closer, John realizes with a start.
. While on three year voyages. To tropical islands and cold regions. How is no one ever sick or injured?”
“No. Not necessary. I manipulated the captain and first mate. By the time we hit our first payload they were entirely obedient to me. They still are.”
“They’ll be respected and treated well,” Sherlock nodded, and then raised his voice to the people on the shore, “Ladies, gentlemen, and variations thereupon! We will be taking our leave of you this day and wish you well. Since you have so kindly given John over to us we will give you the gift of continued life and no thievery. What say you?!”
“Which was that?” John asked, “Another piercing? A necklace? You have a fine neck, it should be adorned.”
. All that was left was to silence Mary and get out quickly and easily. He decided to get a bit of revenge on her so he stripped her of her clothes, tied, and gagged her. Then he donned the dress from the closet that had made him think such naughty thoughts. It didn’t tie in the back, but it was enough to make him look like a woman with a bit of scarf tied over his head.
Captain Sal strode into the room with two men behind her. John had informed the duty watchman of their situation while he’d been topside and these men were here to collect the body. John stood and faced them, giving them a polite nod and holding out his hand to the captain.
“No,” Sherlock replied, disgusted at him for asking for so much, “You may sleep on my floor. This cabin is warm and dry. That rug there will serve you for the night. I suggest you make due. Take this slip to the galley and get yourself a free meal. Make sure you don’t upset the cook.”
John was still weak and he had literally no possessions to his name. Whatever the crew of the pirate ship he’d been on had taken from him- that wasn’t on the ocean floor- the crew from
Mycroft paled and then poured the water into his hand to study it. He could see nothing wrong, but he offered it to a nearby goat just in case. He then went about watering and brushing down their horses. He shuddered in horror when the goat dropped dead with an agonized bleat. Sherlock said nothing as Mycroft disposed of the supplies they’d brought with them. At least the little beast wasn’t going to gloat.
Then Sherlock spoke, ‘Oh, look at you. So perfect. So beautiful. I can’t ruin this. You must stay just how you are until it dries. Then I will have Cap’n Sal in here. He’ll use his superior skills with paints to capture this moment forever. Do you need anything, my pet? Water?’
“I was wrong about you,” Holmes purred, “You aren’t a doctor because your father was, you’re a doctor because pain
“No. I don’t share my duties. Not unless I’m sick, and there are seven people ahead of you hoping for me to fall ill so ‘no’ is your answer.”
, but at great loss to the other side. John recalled a veiled accusation Dimmock had made while he was in too much pain to ask questions.
Anyway, I’m trapped here and the ponce won’t let me go. I’ve gotten desperate enough to offer to give him the buggering he so sorely needs, but apparently he’s not into sodomy. The prick.
Damn him to hell, fucking Mycroft! I made it to the harbour and found the boat I stole from Heinason. Since I’m already familiar with it and have rigged it to sail alone I decided to re-steal it. It looked like my things were still on it, but he’d left everything on board except for food and water! Just empty fucking barrels and crates! I’ve only got what’s on my hip! To top it off they nearly caught me as I was casting off and I’ve been sodding shot. I can’t take the time to stop anywhere. I’m going to have to make due without food. I’ll sift the water to get the salt out but I’m no chemist like Sherlock and I don’t have his kit even if I was. Hopefully I’ll be alive when I get there.
the ones going down and you’ll be tossed to the deck. Try not to wrench your shoulder and treat anyone who is hurt too badly to fight right away. If they can walk they’ll head straight to sickbay. I’ve told them you won’t harm them the way the last surgeon did. Do
Sherlock groaned on his way down from the horse, and then staggered over to the trough and splashed water across his face before leaning down to swallow the water greedily.
“Oh, I know. I’ve read all your cute journal entries,” Sherlock replied, “Mycroft delivered them to me, and he even managed to smuggle aboard a gift that I’m
ring later, stringing them on a simple chain and putting it around his neck. That was when he saw the shaving kit. He made quick use of it and then stored it in with the rest of his belongings. Sherlock might like a clean shaven face from time to time. He dragged Mary back out after checking to make sure the coast was clear.
new plan for me. He restrained my arms and left me face down. Then he brought something cold and sharp to the back of my neck and slowly dragged it down my spine. My breath caught. It was a
AN: I have NO idea if I'm going to write more of this. Maybe. Feel free to make suggestions? Valrae, my beloved muse, I am eager to hear from you as always.
Silence. They all looked confused, disgusted, frightened, and offended. Sherlock shrugged and gestured for John to rise.
Holmes pushed the blanket down suddenly and John had a shock for a moment as he caught the sight of another man’s hard cock for the first time in his life. The purple head stared up at him for a moment before spurting across Holmes’ chest and stomach. John gaped at the sight and then shifted away as shame flushed through him. He
John opened his mouth to continue the argument, but a glance out at those gathered showed unforgiving and even hostile faces directed at him. Not only were they looking forward to a bigger haul without him taking his cut, but also he was an outsider who had insulted their system and they were
“Run drills to keep them in shape,” Sherlock replied, “We’ll be having them practice taking over each other’s ships.”
“I like my town,” He sang with a wicked grin on his face, “With a little drop of poison. Nobody knows, they’re lined up to go insane. I’m all alone, I smoke my friends down to ash and soot, but I feel much cleaner after it rains. And he left in the fall, that’s his picture on the wall, he always had that little drop of
Cap’n Donovan gave him an approving look and Holmes considered this for a moment and then nodded acceptance, “Well, it works for religion. Very well. One hundred five lashings for Dr. Watson.”
Now that I’ve started reliving my life with my Master I’m drowning in thoughts of him. I can relive our first moments together time and again, but they aren’t nearly as sweet as the moments in the dark thereafter. Sherlock and I didn’t always share a shift, so I would often slip into his cabin when I knew he was restless and unable to sleep during the times I had no patients. I would walk in and find my lover fatigued but unable to let sleep claim him. He wouldn’t speak at times like this. It was as if his emotions stole his deep, smooth voice right out of his satiny mouth. This did not mean that he was any less the one in control. I still ebbed to his flow, he ever the moon and I the ocean he stared down at. I could spend ages worshiping him and not have enough.
. He recalled the food he’d stashed and sat down at a table to munch on it while considering his plight. If he could get more pay chips he’d be able to avoid the Admiral again, but he was still recovering and the mopping he’d done had worn him out. It was warmer during the day so he considered just sleeping in the corner until nightfall and then trying to find work then. That sounded the most intelligent, so he headed to the corner where a faded set of rugs had been thrown down as a sign of mercy for those doomed to sleep on the floor. John pressed himself into a corner and dropped off almost instantly.
The ship rowed on and Sherlock continued to whisper to him over and again, coaxing water down his throat and massaging his hands hopefully. They carried him into Sherlock’s cabin where he stripped his lover and rubbed him down with oil. He continued to drip water into his mouth. Donovan returned eventually with the contents of the caravel he’d stolen. Some treasure, a dress, and a book that John had been journaling in.
Sal dipped the image in ink and stamped his back to create the perfect outline. Xe began to meticulously- and
Mycroft looked positively gobsmacked, and in other circumstances it would have been a delightful look on his face. In this instance it was just mildly amusing, seeing as how Sherlock was locked in a damp, chilly prison cell in London on his way to the gallows. Mycroft, his plump and
“Fight?!” John scrambled up, grabbed the straps, and secured his patient before rushing out the door.
The boat swayed and John shifted across the deck, finding his sea legs after months ashore. He lifted his head and breathed in the ocean, eyes shut to the bright sun that warmed his face. He spread his arms and let out a slow breath before shifting to strip off his shirt. His shoes were next. His britches last. He stood in a bit of undergarment wrap and waited a moment, watching as Sherlock studied him from where he’d been watching John sing and cavort across the deck with the crew. The sport was done. The song over. The men and women climbing the rigging as they readied the sales. John was ready to purge himself of his past life and his lover was headed towards him to burn the past from his body.
with their worldly possessions. Though he lost the right to his hammock months ago, I allow them back for burial.”
A few days later John left the sickbay, and headed to the mess next to it. The mess was also where all the non-com’s slept, half of it devoted to hung hammock’s full of sleeping men while the other side held tables for eating and socializing. Sailors, John had discovered, could sleep through anything except the ship’s bell. John found out quickly that each man had their own trunk which they stashed their hammock- and anything else not on their person- in at night and locked. If one fell behind in their debts they could trade their hammock for a few days worth of meals and then curl up with a friend on the same shift or barter to use the hammock of a friend on a different shift, otherwise he was left to sleep on the floor of the mess. The hammock was apparently the first item to trade for necessities, closely followed by shoes, combs, blankets, any money they might have won or brought, and personal items. They
“Hello,” John smirked, holding up his bloodied blade and drawing his sword for good measure, “And that was with my left hand. Care to try my right?”
John’s footsteps grew dimmer and Sherlock sat in silence, breathing in the scent of blood in the air. He moved a foot and something warm and slick slid it across the floor. He wiggled his toes in it and recognized the substance as blood- copious amounts of blood.
” Sherlock shouted after Anderson, but he was out of earshot so he turned to Greg with a frown, “I’m
Yet I have made a grievous error. Some days ago- I’ve lost count, which is why I’ve started this journal- I abandoned my Lord, Admiral, and beloved in order to finish my pursuit of Mary Of the Lemon Scent, only to find that she was Mary the Unfaithful. I would have forgiven that, but she could not forgive me my own indiscretions. I regret it not at all. Though I am sorry for the loss of my childhood friend, she was quite right in her assumptions. I could never have loved her wholly. It would have been a lie. My love wears dark curls not white. He stands tall, not crushed beneath a corset. He has a firm spear rather than a soft… whatever the hell women have. I have a working knowledge of them but no interest. That is midwife territory.
To John’s absolute devastation Sherlock knelt before him, slipped the fabric from around his waist, and swallowed him down. John’s head fell back and he choked on his breathe as the man’s tongue slid beneath his foreskin to tease the sensitive head. John was reduced to broken cries and pleas for permission. Sherlock continued to suck him, occasionally gripping his shaft as a mercy when he felt that John was too close. He worked him until John’s legs shook and he could focus on nothing but the feel of tongue, lips, and teeth. He’d lost control of his hands and was gripping Sherlock’s curls in both hands. The man allowed it, but only because he was as hungry for John as the doctor was for his captain.
Sherlock signalled and a cannon fired into brine, splashing those on the shore while Sherlock laughed at the flying sand and water. The messenger was a young man who nearly fell in his haste to flee towards the woods. Sherlock meandered back and forth on the dock, ignoring attempts to engage him in conversation as he balanced on the very last board on the edge. Their arguments were pointless. John was his goal and endgame.
Sherlock sighed as he shifted out of his Mind Palace and surveyed the room around him. John was whittling in a corner to pass the time, his sickbay empty of patients for the moment. Sherlock was stretched out after having pleaded a headache in order to get the attention of his erstwhile cabin boy and soon-to-be-lover. The man had made him willow bark tea, rubbed his temples, and left him to ‘sleep it off’. He was gorgeous just sitting there in the corner pretending to be
“Admiral,” John stated, his voice strong enough to carry to the sympathetic masses, “This man is dehydrated and suffering from malnutrition. A punishment that breaks the skin would kill him.”
There were a few shouts of encouragement from below him so John pried his eyes open to see people looking at him with newfound respect.
Then he dropped into routine. John once again took over the main aspects of his father’s business. While he’d been away his brother had pulled a sort of Prodigal Son and returned with money to help the father John had abandoned in his quest for Mary. Now John was the shamed one and he found he cared less and less about their impression of him. He kept working hard to keep people healthy and when a few pleaded that they couldn’t pay he helped them in secret. His methods got out and a young woman approached him in church with a whisper of irregularity in her cycle. John knew nothing of abortion, but he knew of others who did and contacted them for her. They were ready to charge her the woman’s entire dowry. John paid them what little he had for a rough lesson and returned to her with that knowledge and a warning that she might not survive. She lived and in gratitude offered to marry John. This was not the first woman to recognize his disinterest in the female form, but John couldn’t tie himself to her. He didn’t want to live more of a lie than he already had. He sent her away with a fond smile and a fresh start. More came. Most lived. John perfected the method and found ways to help the women prevent it based on the stories Donovan had told him.
“Nah, she thinks she’s a man! Literally believes it! She dresses her lower half like a man and the upper like a woman. Some say she’s got a willy, and I think it’s true. You should see the way her cabin boy walks after they’ve been going at it.”
They rode on without halting, working the horses up to a froth, for a solid two hours. When they reached the cabin with a twinkling lantern in the window Mycroft slowed them down to a trot until he reined them in. He leaned down and rapped on the door with his riding crop, directing the horse to the side with the barest pressure on his knees. Lestrade stepped out of the cabin and gave them both a cautious glance.
“Doctor Watson is a stranger here,” Sherlock stated in a stage voice, “Unfamiliar with our ways and having never volunteered himself for this voyage. He’s a doctor and therefore valuable to us, but he’s offered to take the punishment of this idiot here which could very well result in his death. Therefore I have the difficult decision between lenience and severity. You will decide. The flog or the whip? We’ll vote for whip first since it’s my favourite. Who wants him whipped?”
the reason Sherlock’s gone mad! Apparently he gets to decide that because he’s spent an unusually enormous amount of time with his nose deep inside the King’s arsecrack.
,” John replied, adopting a haughty air and striding in before stretching himself out on the rug in front of Holmes’ bed, “The goose you plucked for my bed must have been made of feathers himself!”
He was dressed in a deep purple justacorps with lavish decoration, the frills of his shirt peaking out at the sleeves. His caravate countered that by being more practical while still appearing posh. He wore tight breeches with no stockings and his feet were bare. Around his waist a tooled leather belt held his sword and a horn. His hair was unfashionably loose and wild, his pale eyes flashing as he stared down at John.
John hesitated only for a moment. He knew the cold wasn’t as profound as it felt, but his body needed to
Holmes shifted onto his side and curled up, looking small and vulnerable with the blanket tight against himself. John drew closer out of curiosity.
I’m being held hostage at an enormous castle with servants, fantastic food, more wine than a healthy man should consume, and three maids who keep offering me sex.
“No,” Holmes laughed, “I wish it had been something as vicious as mutiny. No, they were all amused by the genius child captain and alternated between placating me and obeying me. It was the former I took offense to and decided I must put to an end. One particular sailor had a son my age. He doted on me, petted my hair, and offered me candy whenever he managed to get some from a port. It disgusted me. One day he did it in front of several crewmen and they
for liking hitting them. I had to make sure I didn’t look for excuses to do it. Now I don’t have to worry about any of that anymore.”
John closed his eyes. He was fully aware that it was unlikely he’d survive the night, when a sound like thunder jolted him awake again. It was followed by the sound of splintering wood, but it took John a moment to realize that, yes, the boat
His beautiful prism eyes fell shut and Sherlock’s cock pulsed in John’s mouth. He swallowed down his salty release as the man shuddered and moaned above him. John thrilled as his hair was pulled and his airways blocked. Sherlock pulled free and gripped his cock to jerk a few drops free. He smeared them across John’s lips as he posed with his mouth open in supplication.
“I see,” Sherlock frowned, “Then we’ll be trying to lock me up in a ward for the rest of my life? I won’t have it.”
“Unless,” He continued, “You all decide to mutiny. Then you’ll be hung for mutiny regardless of the order you refused to follow.”
The man motioned to John to follow, giving his name as Dimmock, and John shakily staggered down the narrow steps and into the mess. It was set up identically to
“Because I didn’t take a beating from him just so you could have him disposed of on another ship!” John snapped.
“That,” Sherlock chortled, “May be the best thing you’ve suggested yet. You know… bringing the king scientific advances… John, as a conductor of light-“
been pirates, but the crew insisted they not be killed) had been spared but the men had all been put to death and their belongings confiscated. A salvageable boat was waiting for the next tide to sail, manned only by women and children. Lestrade had wept openly when one woman had screamed abuse at them, accusing them of being everything from murderers to sirens. She held a limp bundle in her arms that Lestrade had avoided looking at. Sherlock had laughed and told them they should have heeded the warnings. Lestrade had puked over the side and Donovan had simply stared in obvious loathing.
The doctor moved around him, studying the dedication to detail that came with Captain Sherlock Holmes. He wore the full outfit sans the stockings on his feet. The corset went from just above his pecks down to his waist, pinching him only a bit at the waist. John started at the bottom laces and worked them up to the halfway point where the next knot lay. He let the ribbons flow through his fingers before starting on the next. Finally it was easy to slip it off of Sherlock’s body and lay it on his desk. Beneath the corset was a chemise and underskirt of soft cotton. John let out a slow breath at the thought of such soft fabrics touching his strong lover’s skin.
“You moved filth around on the deck and wasted soap,” Holmes stated firmly, “All watch hands topside for a punishment.”
,” The man grinned, “I’m Lestrade, captain for practical purposes, but nobody calls me that. Can you speak?”
Sherlock led the way down to sickbay while John grumbled about his abused body. The withered young man who had refused to work until he ran into serious debt and was then too
“Sherlock,” Lestrade’s voice is soft as if he’s at a funeral. Well it might be. They’d been picking off the larger vessels all day. Women (those not pirates) and children (some of whom
Then he turns things around on me. He tells me that I’m not allowed to get off without his permission. ‘You’re mine and it’s time to prove it,’ he says. Then he unwinds some rope so he has a real thin bit of it. He wraps the string around my bits like a sort of harness for a horse with my cockstand as the head. It went around my waist, under my bollocks, and then looped around the base of my willy where he tied it in a bow. It was very loose. ‘I’ve made it so if you get an erection it will bother you, but not cut off your blood flow,’ he tells me, ‘this will help remind you that I and only I am allowed to bring you to orgasm. You will wear this always. Wash with it. Only when I remove it can you climax.’
another red chip, and headed downstairs as quickly as he could. He didn’t want to miss the cook and end up going hungry. Surprisingly enough the cook gave him a proud look and nodded firmly. Then he gave him extra chunks of bread and dry cheese that John eagerly pocketed with a warm smile and a soft thank you.
“Yes he would. He’d try to steal from a fruit stand or some such and be beaten to death in an alley. At least here he gets a proper funeral.”
“Take care, my Admiral,” She spoke softly, “You are nearing the edge of the world. Soon you will fall, and I fear the current will take us with you.”
him would be able to see exactly what he was doing. Especially when he snuck a hand down between his thighs and stroked John’s bollocks and cock. He let out a startled shout and rocked into his hand as he pumped him back to full hardness and then stroked his backside a moment. The caress to his inflamed skin was like a balm.
my touch again?” Holmes asked, apparently deep in melancholy, “You were happy enough to press to my warmth all night and the last two, but once you’re through with me…”
Holmes paused a moment to take in his response and then laughed until he could barely breathe while John blushed and tried not to laugh as well.
They stood in silence, looking at each other. John let his eyes travel all over Sherlock, staring long and hard at him, absorbing every new detail, from the shaved-off unruly mop of curls, leaving only an inch or so of dark hair half-concealed under a black cap to the shadow of an old bruise on Sherlock’s cheekbone to his pallid, gaunt look. He saw that Sherlock was slightly fidgeting under his scrutiny, no doubt wondering how to analyse this reaction.
John instantly slapped his hand over his mouth, successfully stifling the laugh bubbling in his throat in spite of the circumstances. He doubted Sherlock would appreciate or that he was even able to see the humour in that situation. However, he would never forget that day, as he set his eyes on his completely inebriated lover, who was watching Greg with a dopey smile. His glazed eyes had lit up at John’s sight.
She flicked the switch on, gasping when the bruise on Sherlock’s right cheekbone was revealed to its full extent.
A man who has left you behind for unknown reasons, who has deigned to give you a clue only after several months of silence?
Sherlock remained motionless for a few seconds, during which John quietly and definitely agonized over what he has done. Suddenly he reached out, wrapping his fingers gently around John’s wrist, stroking his skin.
“Hello there! You must be John!” a tall, slim, dark-skinned man put his phone back in his pocket and greeted with a warm smile. John felt himself smiling back.
And every time I don’t turn you down, every time I smile when I’m reminded of a case we investigated together, your eyes shine just a little bit brighter.
“Sherlock is neither stuffy nor pompous,” he retorted before rolling his eyes at himself. Seriously, what was wrong with him?
“What? Is that all? No more taunts? Have you already exhausted every threat your boring little mind might have come up with? I’m
John observed during a few seconds a fond smile creasing Mycroft’s lips before it was stamped out again.
Life for John would have been very dire indeed, if Sherlock hasn’t unexpectedly channelled his anger at having been fooled by the DI into vigorous bouts of angry sex.
You refused to look at him when he came back at the flat, reeking of sex, a silly grin plastered on his mouth.
He has nearly made this blunder, right after the first time Dave, Helen and the other members of his little group have noticed the man’s obvious ogling.
They stumbled in their room, whispering very loud “Shhhhh!” and stealing kisses when they thought the other wasn’t expecting them – a completely silly game. John was feeling giddy with excitement, happiness fizzing in his whole body like bubbles of champagne. He was so sure Sherlock and him, entwined as they were right now, have discovered somehow the way of negating gravity and floating high above the ground he was honestly surprised when he tripped against an unseen bump underneath the hotel’s carpet.
I’m sure you do. You can’t have forgotten the first time our gazes met in the St Bart’s lab. Sometimes, I can still hear Mike’s babbling on about the “good old days” while I was pretending to listen to him, dark thoughts running in my head.
They stood there looking at each other, each of them resolute in not giving in, until Greg suddenly broke the silence, laughing a bit helplessly.
Walking back up Baker Street, he came to the only logical conclusion – the “gift”, if he can describe it like this, was intended for him. Someone has slipped it inside the mailbox, perfectly aware of the fact that sooner or later, John will find it.
John felt warmth spreading across his whole being, his skin tingling with need, with the unstoppable desire to touch the man he has fallen for a long time ago. He didn’t even realize he has knelt down before Sherlock until he had to raise his hand to put a gentle finger under Sherlock’s chin.
Once they returned in the main room, the other woman has scanned the crowd with an inquisitive look, frowning when she noticed Sherlock and the fair-haired man with him weren’t there.
He cried until the water of his bath definitely lost its warmth; until all what could come out of his mouth was dry hiccups.
They drank in silence, a comfortable comradeship which gave John the opportunity to have a closer look at his friend.
They sneered, they taunted and mocked, never stopping before Harry finally snapped, running away from home. She came back after two days, promising never to do it again, but it was too late – Johnny saw it in her eyes.
A knock at the front door startled him. For a brief, completely crazy moment, the thought that Sherlock was here, waiting for him invaded his mind but his hopes were dashed when a voice arose on the other side.
“You’re not playing fair, Captain,” Sherlock murmured. He drew back a little, just enough to elicit a whine from John’s throat. He buried his fingers in John’s hair while his free hand found his companion’s waist.
“When that art historian claimed that the Mona Lisa portrait was based on Da Vinci’s male lover,” Sherlock interrupted her, ignoring John’s not so discreet splutter of surprise beside him. “I remember reading your brother’s answer to his allegations in a newspaper. It was vitriolic, to say the least.”
And thus, came the annoyance, destroying any pity he might have felt for the poor bastard, because, really couldn’t he take a hint? How many times must John ignore him? For God’s sake, the man was really testing his patience – even more so when John had to remind himself not to give in and simply
“Don’t worry, bro,” Harry told him, eyes glinting with fake amusement, “I can perfectly pretend I don’t know you if we ever met in the local Tesco.”
, Mycroft answered to his own mind, absentmindedly padding along to the kitchen and pouring himself a glass of water. He drank it right away, the cool liquid soothing his parched throat.
It was on the tip of his tongue to volley back something hurtful, something insulting at this man who was judging him without knowing him, lashing out at him in anger and fear. But the words got stuck in his throat and all he could say was
“Nope,” Greg simply replied, stressing the “p”. “You don’t get to… interrogate me, you bloody, cheeky, toffee-nosed bastard…”
Mycroft let out a soft “tsk” at this and bending over, snatched the slip of paper. He wondered what it was – some invoice the good doctor was unable to pay? A letter to his sister? Or something else?
“Oh, is he?” the illusion countered, observing Greg’s advance with an anxious eye. He didn’t go away though.
He barely heard and felt Sherlock pulling his zipper down, gasping when Sherlock’s hand finally found his prize.
John screwed up his eyes. It was a small plastic vial without any label on it. Thanks to the lamplight, he could glimpse some oily residue stuck at the bottom.
I was so turned on by his words that I throbbed for nearly an hour, even while working on deck to clean things up just to keep busy. I was starting to wonder if it
where he was ordered to examine every single person while Holmes made rounds of the ships. He had to truncate his exam- sticking to asking about symptoms and glancing them over- with such a high volume of patients in line, especially since Holmes seemed to have no need of sleep. They were well into the early dawn hours when he finished examining the last patient and John was fit to drop. When told to swing over to
Apparently the next item on the agenda is to tear down a perfectly good bridge and build a shite one that will fall apart. Probably while a supply wagon is crossing over it since it’s right outside a market. I didn’t catch the name of the town. They were laughing too hard.
. He wasn’t the sort of bloke who was turned on by a glimpse of ankle or a coy smile. So I fetched a bit of rope, put it around my neck like a collar and leash, and walked up to him where he was giving poor Trevor a talking to. I simply waited until his hand went out in a gesture and tossed the rope across his wrist. He froze. He just stared at the rope swinging as it lay across his arm like a frightened snake. ‘You have the helm,’ he says to no one in particular. Then he grabs the leash and tugs me down towards our cabin. We didn’t make it there. He pinned me up against the wall, tugged both our trousers and hose down, and rubbed himself off against my hip. Turns out he needed to get off
John was getting steadily worse due to a wound on his shoulder, which was infected and they had no way to properly care for him. It had happened somewhere around the time of the missing papers in his journal according to how far along it was. They needed a doctor and urgently, but returning to land meant arrest. To top that off, they had to decide
“Follow my finger,” John ordered, and watched the eyes effortlessly track his digit, “Any blurriness? Burning? Absent spots?”
gotten off at the last port, but he chose not to. I will not reward laziness and poor judgment with a portion of our haul!”
“I can’t make heads nor tails of it,” Donovan told him, handing the book over, “It’s gibberish. There was no food and the water pot was long empty.”
John stiffened in horror as Holmes gave him a predatory look and reached towards John’s still throbbing member. He scrambled backwards so quickly that he toppled out of the bed and landed hard on the rug. A dip of the ship added to his momentum and he rolled across the floor and slammed into the man’s desk chair, winding himself terribly. Holmes’ laughter followed him as he stumbled out of the cabin, gasping in humiliation and pain.
The last step was the one Lestrade had talked him into. Using yellow and black paint he covered the well with four Yellow Jacks. All around the well in a circle he wrote a warning.
John blinked a few times and took in the faces of the people around him. Where they had been calling for his whipping they were now looking at him with horror and pity. Apparently being Sherlock Holmes’ cabin boy was worse than being beaten with a bullwhip.
John woke up pressed against the warmth of another body, his dreams supplying Mary’s still undressed figure until he recognized the scent and came fully awake to find himself wrapped in Holmes’ arms. For a moment fear went through him, but a quick assessment of his body noted only the usual aches and pains that came with being awake for ungodly long and working horrifically hard. There was no stickiness or soreness around his… area. John slowly shifted the arm from around his waist, slid his legs free of the tangle of limbs, and then promptly lost his balance and toppled to the floor of the cabin. Naked.
traded weapons. They would die with their weapons still on their person. John felt sick again when all of this was explained to him shortly before being transferred to
“I’m getting rid of the chip system. Everyone is a bit flustered about that bit actually,” Sherlock added, looking around in confusion, “I thought they
During these times of restless silence I would have to guess at his needs. I made the mistake once of thinking sex was the solution. He took one look at my hand groping his crotch like a halfpenny whore and threw me out on my arse. Foolish man that I am to think another man could only be soothed by climax! Am I not a doctor? Do I not know that there are other things a man craves from a woman? Or in this case a man?
“H-how,” John drew back again, trying to get a grasp on his mind, “How do I know I can trust you to stop? To not go too far and…”
John’s sobs slowed and then stopped. He finally registered that he was lying on a cot with his head in Holmes’ lap, petting his hair and crooning to him. He was covered in his own spunk and so was the hand that thankfully was
‘Of course,’ Sherlock smiled, giving me a positively evil grin, ‘What did you think that was? A blade?’
“Fall?!” Sherlock laughed at her, “I’ve already fallen! Look how I’ve grown wings and flown free! My ignorant brother with his fat riches can’t hold me back now!”
,” Holmes replied softly as John sat down on the edge of his bed with fear curling in his stomach, “I was too young for it, but I was too smart, too stubborn, too curious to keep at home. Mycroft- my brother- had sent me away the year before when he caught me cutting up animals in the back yard and I quickly took over the ship.”
Sherlock continued to ignore him and mentally marked him as ‘oblivious to being dismissed and/or ignored’.
“It’s okay,” Holmes purred, stroking his hair, “That’s normal. You’re having mood swings from the stimulus. It will even out. You’ve made me
John sat still on the bed, a corner of the blanket covering his privates, as he tried to decide how to react to that story. He’d killed a man in cold blood, a man who had done him no harm, all to make the crew take him more seriously? Yet he was barely a man when he’d done so, and he appeared to feel guilty at the very least.
John tugged his arm free, missing the look of dismay on Holmes’ face, and staggered to the sickbay to collapse into the cot next to his smelly and snoring patient. He’d have to remember to give the fellow a bath the next day if at all possible. His sleep was dreamless, his body lax, but he woke stiff and anxious and it took him a moment to understand why.
get out. And stumble right into a nest of plotting assassins in true John Watson fashion. I spent the time sketching their faces and writing down any names I overheard. Their plot seems pretty convoluted but above is what I understood.
John had been backed into a corner during her speech and he swallowed hard as she stared down at him with fierce eyes and a look of revulsion on her face as if he’d put a bad taste in her mouth. She said the word
Mycroft was pale and drawn as he sat staring at the packet of papers in front of him. He’d found them lining the fancy dress that his brother had returned with, puffing it out like a Primadonna’s gown. Inside of it was a detailed account of things that would alter the course of the very Empire itself. He could deal with this all in silence, which would allow Mycroft to save face, but turning it in would mean Sherlock’s freedom.
John glanced aside at Sherlock who merely raised an eyebrow at him as if to ask why he would question her story.
The men gathered behind the leaders made various sounds of fear and shock, several took steps back, and the four town leaders took on expressions varying from consternation to horror. The consternation came from the priest.
I’ve had a hell of a time getting free of the city. I managed to get a riverboat ride up the Thames in exchange for some labour. Once I make it to the harbour I’ll steal a boat and head for Tortuga at top speed.
“Good day,” Mycroft stated, squinting one eye and hoping his lack of makeup was enough of a disguise, “Sargeant McCain reporting. I’m here for the prisoner… er…”
Holmes sighed and rolled his eyes dramatically, “Fine. I’m hanging your debt bag tonight. I’ll give you a pass on today since you were unconscious for most of it and unaware of the resources you were using up. Tomorrow morning everything you use will count against you, everything you contribute will count for you. That includes information, by the way.”
He propped his foot up on the rails and grasped John’s arm to tug him over his knee. He instinctively fought until Sherlock growled angrily and then he went with it, falling over his knee where Sherlock brought his hand down over his already ravaged bottom five times. John howled shamelessly, voicing his pain at high volume unlike his stubborn silence the night before. When he righted himself he had tears in his eyes that he quickly blinked away.
Sherlock smiled heatedly and wrapped his arms around John’s torso, pulling his naked body close to his own.
Then the crash. Then the ship. Then Sherlock holding him through the night. Then the feel of another man’s cock in his hand and the
Two more splashes and John was alone in a boat slowly drifting out to sea. John quickly adjusted the rigging and took off at a faster pace, abandoning his attempts to use Mary as cover. He saw one of the men swimming up to her boat and turned back to the rising sun, intending on using the glare for cover. She was behind him now in more ways than one.
who were so in debt they were sleeping on the floor, and when he questioned them it was apparently due to injuries received during an attack six months earlier. They were well recovered and confident they could earn themselves back into the black.
Sherlock smirked, “These three vessels are the pride of Her Majesty The Queen. We take in more bounty than any other ship. You saw the metal hull? I designed it myself. They can’t be sunk. They’re floating
The man chuckled, “You’ll have hard luck with that. We’re all fit as fiddles. I suggest you take up a few chores to keep yerself fed.”
I am a sodomite, and a privateer, and a doctor, and a killer. I am cold and unfeeling. I am warm and passionate. I am many things that my father would faint at hearing today. I can only now begin to contemplate the life that I have led and envision my future.
His first attempt at shelter ended as laughably as his father’s attempts to keep him and he slept in the rain that night with his possessions carefully wrapped in leaves beneath a cache to protect them from moisture. John learned from his mistakes. He rebuilt and this time his work was good. It would need filling by winter, but it kept out the rain and he was able to line the floor with rushes until he collected enough river stones and sand to make a proper floor. John’s work continued in that shelter and eventually one of the women he cared for simply remained on. She lived in a corner of his home in a hammock she made herself and gave him no trouble and a bit of coin. It was a while before John caught on that he was her pimp, but by then it was simply amusing to him. Others moved in and John cared for their bodies and collected what they could spare him. When times were good he celebrated with a nice meal for all of them. It was almost domestic, in an illicit and shocking way. He had more patients than his father and wasn’t the least bit shocked- or indiscrete- when the village Reverend brought his daughter in for John’s ‘special’ services. He sat her down once she had recovered and taught her how to avoid needing his help again and sent her on her way with tea and a turtle shell. He made his own girls special sleaves out of sheep intestines that they swore by, but those were difficult to make so he reserved them for those who paid him for their upkeep. His home was crowded but for a man who had shared a boat with many it was hardly uncomfortable, even when the ladies synced up an took their frustrations out on him. John shamelessly whipped one who dared to slap him in a strop, but other than that there was general happiness in his home. Relief. A lack of judgement or abuse.
“Goodness, no!” Sherlock laughed, “The healing time, and in the sun, no, no, no, no. Instead I must ask that we be joined by our dearest Cap’n Sal.”
John was tossed over the railing, the back of his shirt yanked over his head and tucked beneath his chin and his hands lashed to the rails as his face stared down at the crew. Their faces had changed from angry to shocked and confused. They literally had no idea why he would do something like this for a stranger.
“Bread, cheese, some dried meat. Sometimes stew with vegetables, but not often. I don’ like the green stuff.”
Mycroft has broken me. I’m disgusted by this fact, but it’s the honest truth. Sherlock’s (former) shipmates have turned on him and reported that he’s going on a murdering spree. He’s given me the option to step in and confess to serious crimes, including forcing Sherlock to act this way. It will save him but condemn me. I’m going to be burned at the stake. When I made the promise I’m ashamed to say I wept, but as I write this I’m resolved and have made peace with the situation. I’ve never had anything beautiful in my life before that was truly mine, it only makes sense that I die that way as well. At least I was his for a time.
“A dog I had as a child. No, he wasn’t a good dog,” The man stated without John asking, “He shat on the floor on an hourly basis. Most flatulent creature I’ve ever encountered. I adored him. Our fleet runs on an unusual pay scale. You will work to get food and warmth or you won’t get food or warmth. So far you’re in debt.”
John scrambled eagerly from the be and fled to Sherlock, kneeling on the floor at his feet. He lifted the dress and dove for the garter first, but Sherlock scolded him.
Then his ears stopped ringing and he heard them. All around him men were drowning. John’s instincts as a doctor kicked in and he grabbed frantically at a hand through the bars, but the owner was no longer attached to it. He released it and gagged miserably before scrambling to the middle of his drenched cell. His ceiling was partially gone, but all that did was save him from sinking faster. He was still going under with his wreckage, whether it was long after it had sunk and he had drowned on the surface or this instant. John sat there on the wall of his wooden and metal tomb and waited for death with as stoic a face as he could manage.

Holmes’ head shot up and he narrowed his eyes at John, “I’d mind whatever word you were about to spit out. I’m not as courteous as Sal is when defending my person against slander. I’ll also remind you my touch was quite welcome not long ago.”
