Rowena told him that it would only take a few minutes for Dean to be able to be with child. He also will have a kind of hormonal heat for a day or two a month, making it easier to catch. Castiel will make a great use of this. He will have Dean pregnant twice a year. Every day for eternity filled with Castiel's babies.
He is still asleep, calmly breathing as Castiel feeds him his cock. His mouth relaxed and his jaw slack, it takes barely any effort for the seraph to slide the entirety of his member in Dean’s mouth and throat.
Anyhow, he is here not only to feed but to start courting Dean Winchester, sadly the man is not ready to talk to him yet, Castiel can feel it. It is a great thing that he can do wonders without using his mouth.
Castiel bites him hard on the neck at the same time that he starts ramming at his prostate.
He rather not talk about this kind of magic in front of the children, but he is sure that Rowena will understand what he is talking about.
One of the reasons why Dean is such a great prospect for Castiel is that the angel will need less feeding and less variety. If he had Dean he would be satisfied again, he would stop looking for pets if the hunter asked him to.
With a low grunt Castiel comments. “He is very responsive, even without aiming for his prostate, he quickly subdues and accepts the Alpha breeding him.”
"It does not matter that you aren't gay, Dean. Just stay with me." Cas groans in his ear. He looks... hot. Half flushed with bright blue hooded eyes that almost glow with his weird powers. Tanned skin with big arms and strong legs. Dean feels so fucking gay right now. "I can give you anything you want. A family, a good life. Anything and everything that you may want or need. You just need to ask for it."
Renee looks healthy and content. That’s great, last week she was barely able to leave the bed. Castiel was extremely worried and terrified, not every woman is able to carry his children to term, and she seemed so tired. He feeds them wing oil, a spec of grace, vitamins, and heals them, still, some women can’t handle this kind of pregnancy.
It is not a surprise per se that Dean is great with children, Castiel is aware that he raised his little brother since he was a baby. Forced to become a parent at the age of four, he was just a kid who had lost everything. If only Castiel had made it in time to save Mary.
He likes this house, is at least twice as big as the house that he grew up in, and it has a pool and a big garage for baby. One of the few things that he likes about Castiel is that he listens to his mom. She wanted a big new house and she got a big new house. She wants flowers and she gets flowers. She wants space or attention and she gets that. John never did anything that Mary asked of him.
Some of the tension leaves Dean’s body as Castiel explains to him. Castiel gets rid of Dean's come-covered jacket and cleans both of them with his powers. He will get the maid to dry clean the jacket later. The angel lays Dean and himself on the couch. With Dean resting over him, holding him tight and covered with a cashmere blanket.
The fact that Dean just came doesn’t stop Castiel, he still has at least two more hours to enjoy himself. If he still has time tonight to feed again from Dean he will take it. He is so good, able to take Castiel's dick without resting for a full night. He isn’t ready to come again, but there are other activities.
He already has pictures and formal portraits of the Nephilim, but it was taken a year and six months ago, some of the children were not born yet. Maybe on Anna's birthday, he will hire a professional photographer to take a picture of the whole family, including Dean. A happy family. Finally complete.
“Please call me John, doc. How much money are we talking about? Crowley said he would pay Mary’s medical bills and would let us visit the kid from time to time.”
It's good that cleaning him, won't need much of the power that Castiel just gained. It’s even better that he can heal some sore muscles but leave all the bites, bruises, and soreness of their lovemaking. He wants Dean to feel him, wondering how all of these love marks came to his skin. Maybe he will vaguely remember and will touch himself thinking of Castiel.
"Eat." He hands Dean a fork. "How rude of me to forget greeting you. Good morning, Dean. I didn't know what you wanted, so I brought a little of everything. There's scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, fruit, waffles, yogurt, milk, and juice. I helped the maid with some of the cooking so you could try something made by me."
"Jizz, Cas. Don't you think that you have enough already? "
He lowers his eyes. “No sir.”
Castiel fled to save her but he was taken back to heaven, unable to do anything to save the poor woman.
“I’m sorry, Castiel.” She whimpers. “I missed you.”
It takes an impressive amount of willpower to restrain himself from rolling his eyes. He knows that would not be welcomed by Dean and it will not help this situation in any way, but Dean is so stubborn.
“Did he eat and was kept well hydrated? Some Omegas do something akin of a hunger strike if they’re not allowed to be knotted.”
Castiel is holding and watching him. The dude is like a weird cat, taking what he wants and watching him; one time he slept with a chick that had a cat, the fluffy little fucked watched him the entire night, this feels like that. The hunter can feel his gaze even with his eyes closed. Slowly, he opens his eyes and wiggles himself to rest on his side. Now he is comfy and can see Castiel.
It is understandable that Dean does not fully comprehend how much they help him, how much he needs them. He adores being a father, as long as he can be there for them, and can provide for whatever they may need or want, he will keep having children.
When the baby was born Amelia named her Claire and Castiel decided that he would have as much Nephilim as possible. All of them would be bright miracles like Claire. He was starting to feel like himself again.
It takes him another ten minutes to decide what to wear – he settles for soft grey slacks and a dark blue polo shirt that, according to his brother,
Cas’s head sank even lower between his drawn up shoulders and Dean felt bad for even asking him. Yes, Cas had wanted to know, but Dean knew these issues made him uncomfortable and he wasn’t well versed in these questions either. It was just that Cas was the only one that would discuss his question without shutting him down by naming an ancient scholar and be done with it.
Everything is calm and soundless.
blue eyes, his rescuer was stunning.
Not that Dean is in much of a state himself. His jacket is gone and Cas has attempted to, quite literally, claw Dean's shirt off as well.
The quiet moments, the closeness, and the ability to
He walked away with a scar, a living horse, and a wolf pelt that now lay in a chest in the corner of the room.
His Tiger.
Neither Winchester moves.
“The area is secure.” The gravel of his voice boomed through the expanse of the Hall.
Liquid gold sunlight poured into the Grand Hall, reflecting the day’s beginning across smooth floors.
He was also faintly amused at Dean’s stuttering and obvious staring.
“We are so lucky to have you, Dean. We would have died off so long ago without you.”
“No.”
He sat with Samandriel as his sentry and waited, feeling the anger and wrath snake it's way up the temple steps.
It said. Below the words, a drawing of a field and house on fire, with a family standing outside of it. Behind the home was a cloud with two green wax dots. The next page showed the same field and house, but restored with crops growing from the previously burnt ground, and another cloud.
He gestured to the glass in question laying at their feet to the right, the grass shining where the liquid had been spilled.
Instead he searches for clues telling them where they might be.
Eventually Sam will find his brother, the man with prayers written on his very soul, and Castiel, the angel with a love fierce enough to erase the darkest of memories, curled together sleeping peacefully.
Dean was starting to worry that he wouldn’t be able to find one.
Dean says nothing, not even when his blood drips onto the pavement under their feet.
Panic wells up inside him and he hauls the body closer towards him, laying the angel’s head in his lap.
“I do have lemonade.”
Sam watches a million things happen in the space of a heartbeat. The event unfolds beautifully like butterfly wings and tragically like the breaking of precious glass.
Finally, he can't take it anymore.
He was feeling unexpectedly generous that evening.
Castiel wore it proudly.
The Darkness is long gone, her body disintegrating the moment she died, leaving nothing but a plume of arid black smoke to waft away in her wake.
One would think that making love with a God would mean surrendering to their might, but not with the two of them. Instead, he surrendered to Castiel’s touch, his kiss, warm and soft against his lips.
This one had a name in the bottom corner.
Faintly, he could hear the song call out,
"It doesn't look that bad." He said when Cas suggested it.
“Are you all right?”
Dean was babbling and he knew he was babbling, but he was helpless to stop under the weight of Castiel’s strangely intense gaze. Castiel waved his offer off and bent to pick up the glass.
There was one thing, though, he appreciated more than all combined.
“I remember this family. Last summer, when the storms were so angry, lightning struck a tree in one of the people’s fields. I could feel their prayers for help, and I aided them. I stopped the fires and pulled the mother from the house. I sent them food and made sure their crops flourished after.”
“I believe that is lapis lazuli that’s been smoothed down to a pendant.” Castiel commented beside him.
Even then, as his fingers brushed the small mole above his nipple, Castiel, warrior of a God, blushed deeply.
He knew what Castiel was looking for, and he also knew he wouldn’t find it. Every morning, Castiel scanned the immediate area for threats and, every morning, he found none, barring the rogue bird or goat.
“T-There was also this.” He stammered, holding out a small parcel. He could tell the boy hadn’t been with them long, still fresh and green and timid.
He squeezes his eyes closed and, God help him, he begins to pray.
Instead, he landed in a pair of solid and warm arms.
He summoned Balthazar, one of Castiel’s most trusted, silently and stood stone still when the man came charging in, half dressed and sword drawn.
Dean can't find it in him to care, though. He's got a hundred shirts just like this one, but only this one moment with Castiel.
He hands his brother the keys and climbs in the back as well, once again cradling the angel’s head in his lap.
From himself.
Sam will just have to steal another box of tissues from the bathroom for now.
It's a scrabble of hands and lips from then on. They're on the same page, down to the exact word, and it's glorious.
Even though he’d taken Castiel in and made him his
When that does nothing he curses, screaming and shouting at the sky above him.
It was going to be one of
Dean.
"Only beauty, and a few drops of rain." Castiel responds, almost automatically. It seems to hit them that he spoke the words aloud and Cas winces a bit.
“Send the meats to the army, let them eat well. The gold and jewels, to the church. The rest, disperse as you see fit.”
His fingers found Castiel’s cheekbone, still slightly discolored from a recent incident during training. Castiel leaned into the touch, and pressed kisses into his fingertips.
The pain is soon forgotten, though.
"Is there something on my face?" He asks, trying to bring a lightness to the sudden change in tone.
Chapped lips brush velvety soft against his own.
Sam suspects it's on up there.
Dean doesn't stop when they're inside to say anything, just trudges forward on legs that don't want to carry him any further. He doesn't stop until he's collapsed on the floor in front of a bed that's only been used a handful of times, one that smells faintly of thunderstorms and ethereal peace. He doesn't wipe away the wet tracks on his dirty cheeks before succumbing to sleep.
“Let’s go to bed.”
Time seems to become abstract as they wait, fifteen minutes feeling like entire lifetimes.
Castiel stuck his hand out in greeting, a small smile playing on his lips. Dean dusted the sawdust off his hands and gripped his hand firmly.
This was the epitome of their relationship.
He savored the sound of it rolling off Castiel’s tongue. He liked his human name, much more so than his other, but he liked it even more when it came from his lover’s mouth.
Now, he looks down at their waterlogged finding, and laughs a little more.
Both of them knew and Sam wasn't ignorant.
AC/DC played through one of the speakers inside the house and floated out into the backyard while he worked. He had one-third of the platform put up and was absently bobbing his head along to Angus’s guitar solo in Thunderstruck when it happened.
Then there were the others, most darker and angrier, that lined his chest and back, earned from battle with more evil things than wolves.
They end up in nothing more than a feverish rut like a couple of teenagers, but it's more than perfect. With the rain pounding down from above, music, and something closer to life than Dean's ever felt, they find themselves and each other.
He begs, and pleads,
They are far from whole but they are healing. More apologies will come over time and more fights but eventually everything will settle.
Then, a bubble of laughter climbs it's way out of his throat, and he's in hysterics.
Then another and another.
A small smirk was the only answer he received before Castiel was striding away from him to offer a hand to the men.
Castiel grabbed the man by a fistful of hair and yanked his head back.
His brother is alive, sitting a few feet from him. A trail of blood trickles from his nose and mouth, traveling down his neck and staining the collar of his already ruined shirt.
Pain means it is no longer a dream, right?
"De-"
His Protector.
It isn't until after the angel's body crumples that either of them can function. Dean catches his head before it can crack on the floor and cradles it as if it's the most precious thing in the world to him.
He appreciated his lands, quiet and secluded from the rest, and his people, so generous and hard-working. Their gifts, although unnecessary, still pleased him. They left foods from their harvest, trinkets, and jewels, things of semblance to them. He treasured each, and, in return, granted them peace and prosperity. He shielded them from the atrocities of war and famine, and loved them as his own.
They were jeweled in many places, lined with glittering gems, sapphires, and emeralds.
Without a thought he surges forward, gripping the tattered edges of the angel’s beloved trench coat, ignoring the screaming agony that radiates through his hand.
Not that he wasn’t typically generous, he just felt that the day’s offerings would be better appreciated elsewhere.
He could feel a storm forming above them, an unintentional reaction, an unholy personification of their lust and love. When the drops fell, he felt them all.
He led Castiel back to their bed and made him lay. Gently, he pressed a hand on the wound, cooing when Castiel grunted in pain. Beneath the crimson stickiness, he felt the flesh warm, nearly to a fever pitch.
“Gee, Cas. You could at least buy me a drink first.”
It’s only a dream.
When Castiel doesn't respond, he swings his gaze over to him, and finds the former angel staring, in a sort of awed bewilderment. He stares at him through wet eyelashes. He stares for so long, that Dean begins to worry that something may be wrong. A small flush creeps up his neck and he can't seem to look away from the blue gaze that's enveloped him.
The pair share a drink in memory of their fallen before the younger ambles away, presumably to attempt to sleep.
Glass cuts deep into his palm, ripping through skin, muscle, and sinew. Exquisite pain fires through his entire arm, making him cry out.
He doesn't say anything when the sleeves on Dean's shirts become longer or when the circles under his eyes become darker until they're mistaken for bruises.
He dismissed them one by one starting from the left corner of the yard. That one was too small, that one too big, that one too much too weak to support added weight.
Castiel knew how to take his time with him, how to draw out every sigh and moan, exactly as if he was conducting a war assault. Precise, measured, and careful, and always purposeful. He did nothing halfway, and for sure didn’t when it came to this.
“No worries, it’s perfectly intact. See?” He held up the object for Dean to see and confirm that it was still intact.
It's not really quiet, it's very much the opposite. There's a monster clawing down the door, windows and furniture rattling at the force of its blows, but Sam's mind has blocked that all out.
Castiel.
“Dean… thank you.”
“Someone went through a lot of trouble, or got very lucky, to get that here. It is a rare stone to be found in our part of the world. A great love and devotion was sent with it, no doubt.”
Now he lay facing his lover, taking his time to trace the scars that he wore, like the one under his eye. When he was a boy, a wolf attacked his horse in the night. Upon hearing its wails, Castiel rushed to save it, armed with a few sharp sticks and a handful of rocks.
In the end, nothing but quiet chaos remains.
The names and faces of those they had lost haunt him, but none more than the angel they’d lost that day.
He rushed to Castiel’s side as soon as they were alone. The wound cut across his abdomen and bled heavily enough to worry him.
"As beautiful as the moment I saw your soul in Hell." Castiel confirms. He looks as if he wants to say more but Dean doesn't push.
“Later, then?”
The two had something that no one else ever would, not in existence, but chose to overlook it, ignore it, push it to the side with a plethora of "Not now Sam"'s and "I'm not sure what you mean"'s.
One of them.
Dean huffed out a laugh and turned to look at his boyfriend.
Sure, he could fix it where they could dive straight in, and had before, but there was something so deliciously wondrous about opening to Castiel’s fingers. Those fingers knew all the perfect places to make him writhe and they always did just that.
He ripped the hood from their head and pressed the deadly sharp edge of his blade against the man’s throat.
He helped him out of his cuirass and gently wiped the blood from Castiel’s face and hands.
He’d closed his eyes on the way down in a wince, and cracked one open and found himself looking at blue eyes.
“Hello, Dean.
Contentment like he’d never felt before washed over him as he relaxed into Cas’s hold.
It's so quiet in his head, Sam can hear the precise moment his brother's heart shatters.
He knew the moment he'd shook the angel's hand for the very first time.
Ever since, neither Heaven nor Hell could stop him from trying to get his best friend back.
Satisfied with the area's safety, he turned and strode towards him. The simple grace of his lope brought warmth to his heart. Castiel did nothing without purpose, not even walking.
“Thank you, Samandriel. Please help the others deliver to the church now.” Castiel ordered, his eyes a little softer then.
His brother's suffering becomes his own and he's reminded of the pitch black darkness he once suffered in after losing Jess.
“You needed rest.”
"Really?" His voice is small and fragile when he speaks. He almost doesn't want to know the answer.
“Oh, thank you. I’m sorry about your glass, though. I can replace it if it broke on the way down or anything like that.”
Wet streaks cover both of their faces.
He didn’t answer, instead took Castiel by the hand and led them to their bed.
He cleared his throat and tried to fight the blush staining his cheeks.
“As wonderful as your proposal is, they’re already here.”
Dean is caught, shivering and unsure of what to say, but filled with a strange warmth at the words.
That's where the angel finds them.
Like a pin drop or an explosion, everything goes deathly quiet while Sam watches anguish and terror fill his brother's eyes.
Sam watches as another million things happen at once.
“Good, good. I’ll, uh, get out of your hair now.” Dean said awkwardly, turning to head back to his respective yard and hide forever.
It begins to rain.
He reached for Castiel when he drew near, running a light finger across one of the many brass adornments he wore, feathering the bare skin beneath. Castiel told his men they were war medals, and some of them were, but the others… they were more personal.
With a startled yelp, he fell back and over the edge of the fence and braced himself for impact.
The angel's skin feels like it's been lit on fire so the two move him to the cluster of shower stalls hidden within the bunker. They don't bother with removing any of their clothes, instead flipping on the taps to every faucet they can reach and soaking all three of them with the icy spray.
Eventually, one drink becomes one bottle, one bottle becomes two.
The cheap plastic bag from the corner store threatens to rip as they sprint for the Impala. Rain pelts them both harder with every step and he beats himself for parking so far away.
No offerings came, for the men knew it was to be a day of silence, and he was grateful. Together they watched the sky fade until dark, then they retired for the evening.
He gives up the fight for skin after he manages to wrangle off Cas's trench coat and has torn most of the buttons of his poor shirt.
“Not a problem. I was actually coming out to offer you a glass of lemonade since you have been working so hard, but I’m afraid it was discarded when I ran to catch you.”
A sturdy oak stood at the perfect height in the far right corner of the yard, just barely overlooking the neighbor’s fence. The base of the tree and most of the limbs were still on his property so he wasn’t concerned about building something that overhung it just a tad.
There’s blood in his mouth and dirt buried in his skin. His body aches but he doesn’t feel it, not really. It resides in the back of his mind, floating absently on the edge of his focus.
Almighty, impenetrable, Castiel.
In that moment, Castiel stood angry and wounded, naked and unabashedly powerful. Furiosity billowed from his very core and his once soldier trembled under him.
Sobs choke him as he rocks back and forth, whispering for the angel, his angel, to come back one last time. Apologies and promises spill from him in pained whispers, falling on ears that can no longer hear him.
“They seem to be having plenty of fun on their own and the sun won’t go down for another few hours…” Cas mumbled against the side of his neck, peppering suggestive kisses across the skin there.
Twin giggles emanated across the backyard as Mary and Cas’s daughter, Claire, romped and stomped around in the finished treehouse.
Dean really laughed at that and kissed Cas soundly.
He gathered him up in his arms and held him tightly. That's where they remained until dawn broke and another day began.
They kept each other safe and warm throughout the night, and when dawn broke again and sunlight poured into their Hall, he clasped the brass chains back together again.
Everything is brilliant and loud.
Sam knows he dreams of the angel, mumbling the name in his sleep with a voice filled with so much pain it hurts Sam, too.
“Seems like it always is.” He quipped back lightly.
He stepped back to grab his hammer, but there was no more platform to stand on.
“They needed help, so I did.”
Together they carry the body to the Impala, gently draping it across the backseat.
When they were both finished and spent, they lay again facing each other, letting the night air cool the sweat gathered on them.
He checked the time on his watch and counted the hours until he had to go pick up Mary.
A child’s messy handwriting covered it and it made him smile.
Dean stopped short and turned back to look at Castiel, who was staring down at the glass in his hands, twisting it absently. A faint blush was creeping up his neck, coloring his tan skin a lovely shade of pink.
With the jingle of each being released, Castiel’s eyes grew darker, hungrier, and when the final fell from its place, they melted into each other.
Turns out they aren't far from the place they call home, a few hours walk. So he waits outside until the carnage is over with then points them in the direction of home.
“It’s beautiful.”
“The men would not take them, merely send them back to you. They are loyal to a fault, you know.”
Dean slides around to the driver's side door, throwing it open and falling inside. Castiel tumbles through the passenger side as well and there's a moment of rain soaked silence.
Castiel grunted in response and rolled his eyes. He knew that Castiel took his safety very seriously, but he still couldn't help tease him a bit.
Now he watches as Dean tears apart the abandoned store they were dropped in. Glass cuts his brother's hands and blood pours from them just like the festering agony inside his beautifully broken soul.
The man took Lucius, who screamed atrocities at them, without question and did as asked.
They are, once again and as always, in a life or death situation, surrounded with very few chances of surviving. At another time in his life he would have panicked but by now, he's used to it.
Sam knew every time one, or both, came back.
The moment Lucifer had touched him, it had all clicked. He should have known from the way he’d walked, talked, and, hell, even dressed that the angel he’d come know and undoubtedly love was not the same.
The realization throws him into anguish’s grip again, and the bottle he’s been holding shatters in his hold.
Sam has watched one thing happen over the course of nearly a decade.
His lips meet the angel’s with shocking tenderness, granted his fervor.
From the moment Dean came back from Hell with horrors clawing at the back of his mind and a brand on his shoulder. He knew something, someone other than Hell itself had changed him.
“Oh, yes. What a fool I am,
Then, he gathered Castiel in his lap and they stayed.
He’s content to wait but the skin under his fingertips is cold, and it shakes something inside of him.
“There’s still lemonade inside if you’re thirsty.” Castiel called from behind him.
It was one of his favorite pastimes.
A full body shudder rolled off Castiel at the words.
He doesn't even think when he launches himself across the car, pinning Cas against the cold window behind him.
“I, uh, yes. Yes, I’m okay. Thank you Mister…?”
Castiel was most always found by his side, ever vigilant, when not training himself or his men. The army was merely precaution, but Castiel never swayed from training them to be the very best, an image of himself reflected in his men.
It was made of thick paper and had a bit of weight to it and was tied with a piece of brown yarn. He pulled the delicate bow holding it together apart and pushed the page open.
Never would he have thought that someone could get this close to him, to have his trust so completely, to let go; yet, here he was liquefying under Castiel’s prowess.
The man, Lucius, snickered from where he kneeled.
It was in these times Castiel looked like a true God, more so than he ever could, powerful and electrifying. The only other time was in battle, when he let himself be consumed by rage and ferocity. His eyes, normally so ethereally bright, turned dark and the ink that covered him came alive with every roll of his hips.
Known as Prostátis Tígri to the people, to his army, but he knew him by his true, gifted name.
He's watched a man from earth fall in love with a being made of stardust and he couldn't be happier.
He took it and thanked the boy softly, trying to sound as reassuring and gentle as possible. He had no wish to hurt people, never did, but he supposed being in the presence of a God would be intimidating.
Now the man in question’s eyes stare, unseeing, up at the sky. He can’t bare to look at the dulled remains of a color so beautiful, so he gently closes Castiel’s eyelids, for the time being.
Shining blue eyes mert bloodshot green ones when they break apart.
Red rimmed eyes meet his and the fight is gone.
Samandriel nodded and hurried away, and he examined the parcel in his hands.
Blasphemous.
One of the younger men approached him meekly, and he could feel Castiel’s eyes snap to attention of them both. He remained a few feet away but did not take his eyes off of the young man.
. It brought him so much joy that he could nearly weep over it. With Castiel, he didn’t have to be profound and godly, he could be as close to normal and human as he could get. No judgement to be found, just… love.
Then, he spotted it.
He recalled them each to himself while fiddling with the cool brass that still lay across him, and Castiel laid there and let him.
He sat them both up and drew Castiel closer to him, reaching for the clasps of his brass links, and, one by one, he released them.
Valiant, courageous, Castiel.
A dark laugh rose from Castiel, “You think I’m just going to kill you straight away? No, you disgusting leech, I have plans for you. It’s time I make a point to my men.”
Very rarely does the occasion arise where he’s not subjected to a horror filled nightmare, but this time chose to be different.
That was so long ago, enough that the scar had faded into nothing more than a silver line, stretching from his eyebrow to the bridge of his nose.
He was a different creature then.
"You are going to leave right now, both of you. You are going to because I said so.
nights.
Over the next week he laid out everything he needed and began construction.
He can hear the water roaring from the shower heads around them. He can hear his brother's tearful and hysterically joyous laughter as well as the low rumble of apologies emanating from the angel between them.
Now they fell together into it, wrapped tightly in one another.
The Devil’s words ring out in his head.
Go on, get it over with. We all know the price of treason.”
Each draped across him from shoulder to hip, and each were placed in a very specific order. The ones that hung  on the outside were, indeed, war decorations; while, the ones closest to his heart were gifts.
Dean’s heart had done a funny little flip when Mary had asked. The quiet hope hiding in her voice and the way her big green eyes had shone when she’d made the request was more than likely what sealed the deal.
He could be
“Perfect.”
Castiel had been bashful when he’d given him the first. He’d considered it almost blasphemous for a God to gift his protector such beautiful things.
Castiel stands in front of him, seemingly full of life, but inexplicably sad. The angel reaches for him, tracing soft, warm fingers down the length of his face.
Sweet spice mingles with his own whiskey addled taste.
It's so loud and clear he can hear the mending of all the hearts and souls in the room.
All that remains is the shell of whom he’d inhabited.
Dean trailed off.
It made his heart hurt a little to see them fear him, even though he knew it was for the best. He just wanted them to see him as something less… terrifying.
“What if I sent them away today, dispersed the gifts amongst your men, and kept you in our bed all day?”
Being called a 'pretty face' wasn't anything new, most of the time it was thrown at him like an insult, but being called beautiful... that was something else entirely.
His brother becomes a shell, a shell that prays so hard that Sam can taste it in the air. Dean prays until the words are etched into his bones, seared into his skin. He prays until it infects everything he does, until he stops and sits and does nothing but pray. Sometimes it is silent, his eyes being the only thing that gives him away, others he screams to the skies.
Nestled inside was something blue, nearly the size of Dean’s palm, and smooth like a stone.
Tears, scalding hot and unbidden, begin to trail down his cheeks, dripping off his chin and onto the angel in his lap’s head. He clutches to Castiel’s face, and tries to shake the life back into him, name falling from his lips in stuttered sobs.
With the heat, it mended and healed, and within seconds blood was all that left behind.
Such a beautifully strange name, fitting for such a beautifully strange man.
He kneeled to him immediately, “You summoned.”
That was what Sam had never understood.
Beautifully broken, Castiel.
He felt Castiel’s hand slide under their pillows and grab the blade hidden there. Within an instant, the both of them were up and fighting.
There was plenty of time for a drink with an attractive man.
Before Castiel came to him, he would lavish men and women as soon as they touched the sheets, then send them on their way with tales to tell.
He let out a soft sound, almost akin to a cry, when Castiel slid his oiled cock into him, only to be immediately soothed.
He doesn't even fully register the dizzying sensation of being transported somewhere else, somewhere safe. Sam just watches as his brother screams the angel's name into empty air, furious heartbreak filling the space before them.
He let Mary play at a friend’s house each afternoon so there wasn’t any chance that she could get hurt on a loose nail and he didn’t have to keep a close eye on her.
His human name.
He eventually screams himself hoarse.
That and he would do absolutely anything for his little girl.
He watches and says nothing. There's nothing to say.
Lucifer had tsked at him, using the voice he’d come to know so well.
“Take him and chain him at the foot of the temple. Strip him of his clothes and leave him in the rain. He will await his punishment there.” He commanded quietly.
“Mr. Novak, but please, call me Castiel.”
Fires flicker and dance around the three bodies, washing warmth over the blood soaked remnants of those who stood for free will.
The dirt under him starts to become sticky and cold, and soon his brother is pulling on his shoulder, trying to pry him away. He turns to shout at him as well, but stops.
He set the pace, slow and easy, a smooth ascension to ecstasy.
!” Lucius spat, “What will your men think when I tell them what you do at night? When you’re supposed to be protecting their God. Instead, you spend your time beneath him!”
He held it up to the light and examined it curiously.
“Lucius. You stupid fool.”
Eventually, blue eyes blink open slowly, staring at the two of them as if they'd disappear if he looked away.
It had blossomed and flourished before his eyes but was left neglected countless times in favor of... of what?
He catches Dean in the hallway, grabbing him by the shoulder and not one of his arms. Dean struggles for a moment, he always does, but sags into Sam's hold after a few seconds. He collapses into Sam's arms, nearly taking both of them to floor, and eventually that's where they land. Dean breaks and Sam can feel the tidal wave of emotion flow over them both.
With that day, Castiel donned his war cuirass, reserved for rare occasions, and doled out his punishment as promised.
He also added another gift, this time, not a chain. Instead a leather cord with a shining blue pendant hanging from it.
So, instead of trying to hurry things along and cut straight to the action, he relaxed further into the touch and let himself really enjoy their time together. He relished the warmth of hands and lips on him, everywhere, teasing and coaxing.
He uses his wing oil, the one that his body produces for his wings. It’s the perfect lubricant for Castiel’s pets, not only does it last a lot more than common man made lubricants, also the smell lasts days on humans, he loves smelling himself on his pets.
It was unnecessary dramatic, and difficult to get her to hand him the newborn, he saw it in her eyes, she would hurt the hatchling if he made the wrong thing. She tried to fly into the night, but Castiel always keeps an eye on all of his offspring. It almost broke Castiel’s heart to take the baby away and erase her memory.
Sam Winchester was saved and free of demon blood. He will never be an abomination and the family was unbound to their destiny. But in the brief battle that unfolded, the demon had mortally wounded Mary Winchester.
"It's a comfy bed."
He looks so good, for a second Castiel almost forgets to feed, enraptures at the show unfolding beneath him. He is as exquisite as always.
Bella is chatting with Kelly, she has not even bothered to check on the twins today, or any time since they were born for that matter. It is certainly strange to see a mother that is not interested in making sure that her offspring is alright, however, she knows that Castiel is the being more trustworthy on earth, still, it is odd. They have a deal, he destroyed her contract and saved her soul from the eternal damnation that she was destined to have, and she got pregnant with Castiel.
It only takes him two more hours for Dean to catch and get pregnant with Castiel's baby.
“Is that good?”
“Hi, Cassie. Thank you so much for inviting us to Claire’s birthday party. It’s lovely BTW, just as every party that you put together,” she gives him a gift for Claire. “From Matt and I.”
He lets go of the baby and turns to see Castiel, holding on, and hugging him back.
Dean gasps. Opening his eyes. "You're an angel."
He isn’t sure if it’s the taste, or the feeling of his divine origin, but it’s also addictive for most humans. Like an aphrodisiac or an unharmful drug. His oil makes them pliant and desperate for him, not that he needs it; his last twenty years on earth have made him an exceptional lover.
The second and the most important reason why Castiel adores Saturdays is that he and the Nephilim always host a brunch or a tea party was everybody dresses up, and he is able to catch up with his offspring the first day of the weekend on the lush garden.
Kelly Kline is another thing entirely, she is special, smart, and nurturing, but her extremely conservative upbringing was her undoing when she met Castiel. She developed an obsessive infatuation with Castiel right away; somehow she got the idea that they were meant to stay together as a family, they had to get married and be together, she insisted that her baby would save the world and he would bring humanity to its next level where God would come back and bring rapture to everyone. Perhaps pregnancy was too much on her mind, but Castiel does not think so, there is something really wrong with her.
Castiel does not like to undress when he feeds, it takes too much time, and it is just unnecessary, so he tends to just unzip his trousers, and for special occasions, he removes his coat and suit jacket. Today he is going to be fully nude, Dean’s comfort is the most important thing and skin on skin contact seems to be the best option.
It should not bother Castiel. Dean is not his, and yet, he feels offended that the young man went to find a warm body so soon after their coupling. He is definitely not jealous, he does not get jealous. People long for him to notice them; some of his forgotten pets mourn his loss when he leaves them, even if Castiel erases their memories, those people still yearn for his touch.
He makes him feel almost as good as it felt to be connected to heaven, it is like having the raw energy of creation that only the divine can provide directed to him one last time. Just like all those years ago before he fell.
All the noise from the children chatting and screaming wakes the rest of the Nephilim.
“Bullshit. You were giving me something, you were using four weird powers to… to…”
He had just lost Amelia, and Jack was the first baby that was not hers. With Kelly, Castiel quickly learned that not all women would be like the first woman that helped him. He had to keep the bondmaids near him, but away from the children and the idea of a family.
“They need a second guardian.” Complains Castiel while checking his phone in his office. He is supposed to go to Japan this Monday to heal an old woman and the agency just told him that they don’t have a babysitter for him, he cannot keep going like this. “All of these new nannies cannot be good for their development. Since Mildred passed away I have been unable to find a permanent babysitter for them. They need a permanent figure who will help me with raising them.”
"Of course it is pretty, angel." She half smiles at the baby, but does not get closer or tries to touch her. She has never tried to carry or play with the kids. "You know that I adore attending parties, but this is not what I usually..."
This time, he takes Dean on the side of the bed. Standing next to it, he takes Dean and folds him in half, filling him, and roughly slamming into him. A long whine leaves the young man’s mouth as Castiel envelops him, grunting next to his ears. The bed moves with his powerful thrusts, and Dean moans into the air, leaking again.
Dean fucks into Castiel and the angel keeps bouncing on the hunter, moaning on his ear. Dean grunts at the sensation. He wants this, God helps him. He wants this.
Apparently now Dean is content with his recognition of the room, as he sits high-strung on the arm of the couch. Looking at Castiel, not even blinking. For a second he sees fear, then is gone, replaced with raw anger.
They talked once, they have been together on bed for three nights and Castiel feels like tomorrow will be the first time they see each other. It is surreal, the sensation feels like flying, not on earth, but on heaven, like it was before when he had everything.
He escaped to earth and closed the gates of heaven and hell forever.
If he ignores his longing for Dean the only thing that is missing from this event is Amelia. She was never his partner, they were not in love, but she took care of the children. He only wishes that Amelia could be here to see Claire and her other two biological siblings today. Claire is so happy and all grown up, she has changed so much since she lost her mother, even Castiel. He wonders if she remembers Amelia.
When Castiel leaves Deans' mouth, he whimpers at the lost, already addicted not only to the oil but to being Castiel’s toy. He blinks his eyes open, disoriented and desperate for Castiel as he blindly reaches for him, any part that he can get his hands on. It is a breathtaking sight, the young man with rosy cheeks, begging to be fucked on the bed, not even wide awake and still asking for him.
He wants to avoid paying full price for the Omega, but he will do whatever to keep him.
Dean smiles. "You could buy a school bus."
He has never been married and doesn't have any children. He seems to be perfect for Mary, he has no addictions or problems with authority or exes; he is smart, rich, and really hot.
Well, that is not fair, Castiel knows what brought his attention to Dean in the first place. He is a caretaker, a loyal man that protects everyone he cares about in such a strong way. Dean is the brightest star on this junkyard of useless scrap that is the earth; he is clever, kind, great with children, humble, and oh so good in bed, Castiel is so smitten that he is sure he could go and listen to Dean talk about his strange interest while still thinking he is adorable.
“Why did you close the door?” He asks gruffly.
Renee falls to the edge and finally comes.
The angel doesn't look exactly pleased with his manners, yet doesn't comment anything on it.
He eats his half of the pizza on the kitchen bar, half-naked, and goes to lay down in the tv room. He is in his swimming trunks, but he never got them wet so Mary won't get mad at him for ruining the couch. He tries sitting, but he is way too sore right now for that, so he settles on laying back on his stomach watching Doctor sexy. Maybe he likes the doctor because he likes Cas or maybe is the other way around. Who knows? It doesn't matter. He has better things to do, like oggling the doctor.
No beta, so any mistakes are my own. English is not my first language, if anything doesn't make sense, please let me know.
The night is almost gone, the sun minutes away from raising, and Castiel has to go. With a sigh and the sound of wings, Castiel is gone.
Half frozen, Dean slowly looks down to himself and confirms Castiel’s comment. This can’t be happening. Castiel is handsome, he supposes, strong, tall, dominant, and secure of himself. But Dean is not into all of that. He is not into Stockholm syndrome or all that kinky shit.  Castiel must have done something to him. It’s the only explanation, he is not attracted to that little shit. He isn’t into men or monsters. He isn’t.
He took a breath and looked down at his hand. Fine lines still marked the places were the riding crop had landed when he had miscounted the day’s earnings.
Can‘t.
The world is about to end.
His thoughts are swimming in circles, like sharks ready to attack each other.
Her voice is shrill. “J– Justin?”
“If you’re not in the water in ten seconds, I’ll come out and get you,” Dean threatened.
Cas turned. He had spread his arms wide and dug his fingers into the soil. His breath came hard and fast. Long lashes fanned out from his closed lids, still adorned by tiny water drops that twinkled like gems in the sunlight. He reminded Dean of the ancient martyrs in the engravings of their most precious books. Cas’ face was a mask of pain and bliss and Dean’s body trembled with a sudden need to wipe that mask away to see what was underneath, what Cas was hiding from him.
Cas worries his bottom lip between his teeth. He didn’t know. “My brother booked for me. He must have thought it’s hilarious.”
“You made me realize that I’m gay.”
“I wish I could,” Dean murmurs, so low that Castiel can’t be sure he’s meant to hear it.
“I wouldn’t call his attempt to get you out of your lonely shell mischievous, but whatever. He told Sam you needed to meet someone, Sam told Gabriel that I’m single and voila, a set-up was planned.” Dean drinks the last sips of his coffee. “Can’t say that I really thought it through though. Must have been quite the shock for you to see me in the parking lot.”
taste like chocolate and his lips are still a little cold from the dessert. Cas is melting against Dean, holds on to his back while Dean plunders his mouth with the same vigor and the same small sounds of pleasure as before, like Cas is something delicious, something to be devoured. The world around him spins while Dean kisses and kisses him, and Cas feels a bubble of laughter rising in his chest, pure happiness coursing through his body. They part with a smack.
They take a moment to breathe and look their fill, foreheads pressed together. Dean’s cock is thicker and heavier than Cas’, pointing straight at Cas’ stomach and weeping small drops of precome that are washed away as soon as they appear.
“Please, call me Castiel. I’m glad you chose our firm and I’m looking forward to working with you.” The handshake ends, and Cas feels like he’s just run a mile. He barely stops himself from wiping his hand on his pants, sure it will be sweaty. “If you’ll excuse me, I have a lot of work to catch up on.”
“Yeah, no shit, you surprised me with that move.”
Gabe claps his hands as if he’s trying to get the attention of a bunch of four-year-olds.
Dean nods. “He… is very different from his version in our world. Is he on our side?”
The air is thick like jelly when he gets his bearings. Dean’s soft cock is nestled against his nose and Cas has a good view of his testicles. His cheek sticks to the skin of Dean’s thigh, most likely glued together by a mix of sweat and come. Dean is lying half on his back, arms splayed out, one hand still between Cas’ legs.
On a cold morning in February, Zachariah addressed a new topic. A house full of adolescent boys led to one problem in particular.
Cas is weirdly offended by that. He’s of half a mind to correct Dean, but what would he say? You’re wrong, I would very much like to have sex with you? With a start he realizes he would. And he wonders if it had been Dean’s plan to get a reaction out of him. Pleasant warmth spreads through his stomach as he watches Dean get ready for the night. He is gorgeous, all lean muscle and natural grace, freckled skin and those panties, good lord, Cas didn’t know he had a thing for that, but it seems like he does, he really does.
The line creeps forward, and Cas goes through at least five circles of hell. The barista prepares coffees with graceful efficiency, a smile and a few kind words for every customer. He’s older now, but the years did not diminish his appeal. Laugh lines surround his stunning green eyes, his shoulders are wider and his middle a little bit softer than in Cas’ memory. He’s still the most gorgeous man Cas has ever seen.
Murmurs whisper through the troop of tired fighters when a figure shuffles its way to a spot just outside the loose circle. Castiel's wings are stretched out to balance where his bound feet can't. Dean watches as Castiel lowers himself gracefully unto the ground, face pointed away from the humans as if he’s scanning for enemies.
Dean can’t help neither the huff of laughter nor the sudden pang of loss at hearing it.
“No, Cas. But I heard you from a mile away. As an angel, you’ve got to be able to be moresneaky than that.”
Cas sighs wistfully and looks up to watch the party unfold around him, without him. Gabe and Sam are dancing really close to some sappy 80s ballad, grinding against each other with flushed faces and dark eyes. Cas wishes them well, but the part of him that’s prone to self-pity seems to be amplified by the booze and the cavity-inducing slow-dance, and he’s got to look away from the couple when his eyes start to burn.
Dean sighs. The memories are enough to make him chub up. He runs his palm up his thigh to squeeze his dick through the thin fabric of his shorts. Cas won’t mind, and it’s his own fault Dean’s getting restless. Dean’s cock fattens under his palm, tents the fabric as he keeps up his lazy strokes. He sets down his glass. Closes his eyes. Enjoys the slow built of arousal.
(unbeta'd, sorry)
“No. And I don’t think you’d find anything on him. He’s… he’s done nothing wrong.”
“That means I can kiss you now?”
“Most women do not even do this on purpose. It’s the curse of Eve. The chaste ones cast down their gaze when men are around. The jaded ones, the witches and adulteresses, on the other hand ...”
Cas sits back and steeples his fingers over his stomach. “Yes, Bradbury. Well done.”
When all is said and done, he sleeps for a day and a half. Sam works his way through a pile of laundry that reaches up to his armpits, before he gathers the nerve to make the call.
Dean kept his promise. He is down by the bar to meet up with his friend Charlie, and Cas wonders if he will spend the night alone after all and Dean will find shelter in this Charlie’s room. He doesn’t like the fierce stab of jealousy that thought causes. Dean is not his type, he’s loud and sassy and thinks his charms will get him whatever he wants. Cas’ thoughts shouldn’t keep drifting back to the sight of Dean’s broad back or the way the corners of his eyes crinkle when he laughs.
They’ve watched a silly movie yesterday, and since then, Cas is obsessed with the idea to surprise Dean. Dean acts all grumpy when Cas starts a new attempt, - after all, his life taught him there’s not much to like about surprises, - but deep inside, he thinks Cas is adorable. So he indulges Cas and explains – again – how it works.
Dean parts their lips with a wet sound, but keeps his hands on Cas, holds him in place.
Cas is met with silence. When he looks up from his papers, Winchester just cocks a brow. Cas wants nothing more than to swipe that smirk off his face.
“Yeah, she’s a looker, ain’t she?” Dean smiles. “Wonder if she’s interested in a little roll in the hay.”
“Yes sir, of course. The problem is, the… uhm… Ladies won’t talk to me about the goings-on, and the patrons are mostly too drunk to be of help.”
“Without food or water, you’ll make it a few more days I guess. Enough time to ponder your decision to follow me here, and every step that led to this ending. When I’m strong enough to conquer our world, I’ll make sure to let your brother know you didn’t even die in a fight, all alone and like the pathetic loser you are. And then I’ll kill him, slowly.” He winks and walks out of the room, wriggling his fingers goodbye over his shoulder, ignoring the insults Dean hurls at him at the top of his lungs.
“My husband? He’s alive and perfectly healthy, agent. You must be mistaken. Can I offer you a drink?”
Cas’ mouth is a thin line, and he looks as if he’s about to lecture Dean on his own freaking sexuality. Dean can’t –
They towel off in silence. Cas‘ mind is sluggish from the mind-blowing orgasm he just had, but after a while, the whole journey that led them here comes back to him. There’s a still a lot to talk about, but the mere fact that Dean is here and by his side feels like a miracle, so Cas just basks in it while he can.
“Gotta go. I’ll leave you two love-birds to it.” He walks out of the room with a spring in his step, winking at Dean as he passes him. “I don’t know what you did to him and I don’t wanna spoil the big surprise, Dean-o, but he,” Lucifer licks his lips again, “tastes almost as rotten with nasty human emotions as your pal on the other side.”
“Lucky bastard,” Cas agrees.
The cold floor sent icy tendrils up from his knees into his thighs. All the blood had left his feet – he hadn’t felt them in half an hour. His interlaced fingers hurt from being held up for so long and his shoulders burned. Still, Dean didn’t move.
He cards his fingers through his hair and tugs until it hurts.
The next day, Dean started his research. He wanted to know everything there was to know about sin and how to defeat it.
“God made men in his image and created women to serve and please them. They were given the gift of reproduction, which is to be used solely for this purpose. Every other kind of encounter is sodomy and an act against nature.”
Me at the beginning of s13: Oh damn, I was too slow, now I can't go on with my s12 coda fic:-(
“Cas, you’re almost fully human now. Might as well enjoy the perks of your life as a mud monkey.” Dean winks for good measure which only leads to an intensified version of the scowl.
Dean wants to be with him, and that’s all that matter right this moment. They’ll figure the rest out – together.
Castiel squinted at him. He looked like a bird contemplating the meaning of life. Dean smiled, waiting for the penny to drop. Cas kept squinting.
“That’s right, and thank dad for that. It would only be a nuisance in my line of work. But it has come to my attention that a few of my brethren have had the questionable pleasure to grow one, for lack of a better term. For instance, when they lost their grace. Or died and came back from the dead. My father, you see, has a wicked sense of humor.”
“You’re quite old.” His voice rumbled accusingly.
“Whatever for?”
No touching.
“Yeah, there’s a few people who would agree with that.”
Dean gulped down the last drops of broth, wiped his hand and held it out to the newcomer. “Dean.”
“Well, uhm,” Dean starts, not sure how to handle this moment. In the end he opts for a murmured
“Dude. Do you even know my brother? He gets excited when I tell him that I tried a new cereal brand. He once compiled a binder about the pros and cons of porridge. If he gets even a whiff of a hint that I’m seeing someone, I would have a file as thick as my arm about that person on my desk two hours later.” He snorts again. “You were in the room, Cas. There’s no way I would have let him interrogate me over the phone while the person in question is in the room.”
With that, Lucifer rises to his feet and wipes his hand on his slacks. “Just something to think about while you watch him die,” he points to Cas. “I’ll leave you to it.”
Gabe grins at Sam. “I don’t know about you, but I for one believe them. From what I hear, it’s a miracle they got their head out of their asses, and I don’t even want to know why my brother came in here with a post-coital glow and your brother’s wearing clothes that are definitely not his own. Our job here is done. How about we leave these lovebirds to it, big guy?”
He knew the bathroom door was thin. He heard Dean in the shower yesterday, so he really shouldn’t be surprised. But when he hears the first low moan wafting over, it’s still a shock. Against his will he calms is breathing and tries to hear more. There’s a faint wet rhythmic sound between the low moans. Cas feels a blush creep up his neck, he should be embarrassed of himself, but his body doesn’t mind. His cock hardens again while he listens to Dean jerking off in the other room, and his brain has no problem at all providing him with visuals.
“I scouted the brothel, sir.”
“You have no idea how many times I was so close to calling you. Charlie nagged me constantly.” Dean stares at him, wide-eyed, as if he’s the only one at fault here. Cas messed up in equal measure.
“So tell me about your side. You still have cars?” Danny seems to have enough of the silence. Or maybe he’s feeling Dean needs a distraction. Dean takes it, grateful to untangle his thoughts from the nightmares and the grief.
Dean sags back against the wall.
It’s strange to leave the Sunset Plaza, which feels like an alternative reality to Cas by now, a place where he doesn’t have to be the person he was his entire life. When he arrives at the restaurant, Dean is already waiting next to the entrance. Cas almost doesn’t recognize him in the well-fitted grey linen suit. It’s unfair that Dean can look even more gorgeous, he thinks. A man that looks breathtaking in a bathrobe shouldn’t be allowed to wear a suit like that.
When Dean convulses and spills hot down his throat, he swallows greedily, and the pulses fill his mouth, drip out of the corner of his lips, and still Dean’s cock jerks and spits out more. Cas takes it all. All the while, he fucks into their combined palms, the sounds of Dean’s climax fresh in his ears, his taste filling his mouth even when his softening cock slips free. Cas lets his head fall on Dean’s thigh as he chases after his own release.
“No,” Castiel… Cas interrupted him. “I like it.”
“It’s Justin actually, although I can’t remember us being on a first name basis. You look pale, Agent. I’m sure a strong martini will help. Darling?”
“I’m very much interested in finding out,” he tells Dean, which isn’t so much a pick-up-line as the truth. It seems to do the trick for Dean though as if Cas had told him that yes, he wants to find out what Cas’ dick would look like between Dean’s lips. Dean clears his throat and stands, closing his jacket carefully over his crotch. Cas smiles. If being prosaically honest is what gets Dean going, he can do that, in fact, it’s one of his very few talents.
Cas’s throat aches but he wouldn’t stop for the world. Dean’s whole body is trembling when he swallows again and again. Dean still jacks him in a loose fist, and it’s not enough, Cas is so close already, and he reaches over to close his own hand around Dean’s while he sucks and swallows and revels in feeling Dean reaching that perfect crest, feeling his body tensing. He’s hyper aware of the moment just before Dean falls, stills the movements of his mouth and his hand because he doesn’t want to miss any part of it.
The silence, though, is complete, as if he‘s under water and the pressure clogging his ears, his brain, is absolute.
“Cas, I-,“ Dean shrugs. “I don’t know what to tell you, man. Ever since you plucked me from hell, there’s been a, I dunno, a special bond between us.” Goddammit, this shouldn’t be so hard, he tells himself, but he feels like a schoolboy confessing his feelings to a crush instead of a grown man talking to a celestial being he’s been through literal hell with. “I guess, if you’d want to call it that, from an outside perspective, it could be interpreted as …”
“Take care, kiddo,” Dean says, Charlie sticks out her tongue at him before she vanishes.
He runs a hand down his face to clear his thoughts.
On their way back, Dean stopped the carriage in the middle of an empty stretch of road and hopped down, grinning at Cas before he ducked into the bushes.
“Come on, Cas,” Dean pants in a rough voice, as if he’s the one being taken to the brink expertly and merciless, not Cas, “come for me.”
They both stay silent after that. Cas finishes his coffee, too. The clock in his kitchen ticks on as if this is an ordinary morning and Cas’ life isn’t in the process of being turned upside down. Hope rises hesitantly in his chest.
Dean laughs tonelessly but turns his head to look Cas over. His smile is slow and wistful.
an answer, it’s not a satisfying one. While Dean has reasons, even if they are stupid, that make him want to help Castiel, the angel doesn’t carry that kind of baggage. To this Castiel, Dean’s just another human, short-lived, nothing more than a blink in his existence. He’s got no reason at all to put his own life on the line for Dean.
Cas berates himself for getting his hopes up, for falling for Dean so soon. After years of being alone, and yes, he has to admit, being lonely, he was stupid enough to lose his heart to the first handsome man that came along and made him feel wanted.
Dean follows Garth through the grey world. Where he came from the weather would count as a sandstorm and Dean coughs and works hard to keep the fine kernels out his eyes. Garth doesn’t seem to mind. He trudges on and Dean is glad he leads the way. Dean would be lost in seconds without him.
Mary touches his cheek and smiles a little. “What are you doing here?”
Usually, the pipes in the bunker clank and creak. Usually, there‘s the electric whir beneath all sounds, a invisible current that keeps the bunker going. He knows it must be there. Turns his head to listen.
Cas bundles up his ruined dress shirt and leaves the bathroom. Dean stands next to the bed, still stark naked and so beautiful it hurts. The morning light kisses his skin and makes it glow from within, freckles dusting his shoulders and arms. The sun will coax out more over the next days, Cas is sure of that. Cas looks at him, greedy to take this image with him, commit the curve of Dean’s back, the swell of his ass, his heavy sex, his bowed legs to memory. He blinks against the threatening tears.
it, because they‘ve got work to do.
“District attorney,” she smiles and sips her drink. Her expression is warm, but her eyes sparkle when she turns back to Sam and picks up the thread of their conversation. One night out, and a beautiful lady shows interest, and then his Bigfoot of a brother has to snatch her. Dean pouts, but his heart isn’t in it. If he were a person who looks closely at their emotions, he’d have to admit that his heart hasn’t been in it for quite a while.
Cas gripped Dean’s hips and Dean could pinpoint the exact moment when his last control snapped. Cas buried his face in Dean’s neck and pushed into the tight heat between Dean’s legs hard and fast. Dean’s own cock ground against Cas’ stomach, painting it with precome. He moved to meet Cas’ thrusts. The way the tip of Cas’ erection slid over his perineum ripped a broken moan from his lungs, the sensation foreign and intimate and indescribably
Dean doesn’t meet his eyes. His teeth are showing, almost feral, when he spits out, “You know nothing about me.”
“Great,” Dean says, grinning, before he turns to the clerk to sort out the details. Cas is numb with fatigue when he follows Dean through the lobby, into the elevator, down the hallway in silence.
His heart beats with the rhythm of Cas’ steps,
Dean holds out his hands to the side. “Like what you see?”
“Dean!” She hugs him tightly and Dean stops wiping his face to hug her back. He gives himself a moment to just sink into her embrace, but when the emotions well up, he takes a step back and clears his throat. He has to remember they haven’t got time for this.
“Oh. Uhm, yes, I did. Sorry. It’s just that Cas-ti-el is so formal and I thought… I think Cas suits you better, but I’ll…”
His first thrust is tentative. The head of his cock glides over Dean’s tongue slow and soft like velvet. Dean moans when Cas bumps against his throat and breathes deep through his nose. Cas holds his head carefully and pushes in again. His gaze is glued to Dean’s face – flushed cheeks, slick lips, blazing green eyes that meet his own in what almost looks like a challenge.
“Look, man, I promise I’ll be a perfect gentleman. There’s no need to panic like that. I’ll be out this evening and will get out of your hair first thing in the moment.” His face turns soft with empathy, and Cas wants to scream (
I guess there'll be two more chapters after this (in which we will get back to the sexy times and get a few more answers), hope you stick around!
And stops.
“I understand that matters have been handled differently in the past, but now I am in charge to restore order to this town and I happen to take this task seriously. So I wanted to give you a fair warning: If you or your men are found trading stolen goods, or witnessed to be associated with any other acts of privacy, I will personally make sure you will hang.”
“I can hear you, you know?”, Dean rumbles, indignant, but is ignored.
Dean, with his hands bound and unable to posture sitting on the ground, does the next best thing and spits on Lucifer’s blank black shoes.
“Please,” Dean whimpered, and Cas, finally, opened his eyes. Blue, darkened by lust, captured Dean’s gaze and held it. Dean had waited so long to have that focus on him, he had dreamed about Cas’ stare and the power it held. Now he wondered if he would drown in it, if Cas would just take away everything he was and replace it with this all-consuming want.
They stumble into Cas‘ room still giddy with happiness. Cas is not sure what they’re laughing about between the messy kisses, but he doesn’t find it in him to care. When the door closes behind them, Dean is already fumbling with Cas’ shirt with one hand while shoving his jacket off with the other.
“I’m sorry, I don’t understand.”
Dean wriggles in his arms, and their lower bodies brush. It’s the gasp at feeling each other hard and straining that breaks the kiss apart.
As it turns out, it’s the heavenly smell of bacon and the sight of Dean, stretching up to get plates from a cabinet, showing off a slim strip of skin and the embroidered waistband of what
“Oh, is he awake? Should we tell him then? That you let yourself be captured to save him? Cas, you’ve always been way too soft for your own good. Those animals, they’re not worth our time. And that one, he’s certainly not worth your loyalty, trust me. I had really hoped in this world, you’d be a little less stupid.”
They swam rounds without talking much. From the corner of his eyes, Dean admired Cas’ exact movements and the way his skin moved over his muscles. He had never seen him undressed and was surprised to find him so well built.
“Romantic,” he croaks and doesn’t meet Cas’ eye.
Cas rakes a hand through his hair and closes his eyes. He contemplates fleeing through the backdoor but decides against it. Might as well face whatever’s waiting for him in the kitchen.
Winchester shrugs as if he’s bored by the question. “These parts of the world, when you own and command a ship, you’re a captain. Easy as that.” He grins. White teeth shimmer in the half-light of Cas’ office. “Don’t need no king to tell me who I am.”
“Dean, my men will be delivering yesterday’s offerings very soon. I need my composure for then.”
“You know, now that you mention it, I am pretty parched and lemonade does sound awfully nice.”
The words come from a fallen angel's mouth, one he considers a friend, a brother.
In front of him, Castiel still stands, frantic worry etched into his features.
That's it, that's all it takes.
Each scar held a story within it, and he knew them all.
Castiel grinned at him wolfishly.
They make it home by dawn, pink-oranges bleeding into the sky and driving away the purple-blacks and a new day is born for them.
There's a few cans of chicken soup, (no noodles because Sam's picky), some cold medicine, and a heating pad for his plagued brother, and some road snacks, even though they weren't going far.
He absorbed the words quietly, and felt Castiel’s sincerity. He knew it was true, but he did it because he had the power to, and it was right. The people shouldn’t have to suffer for him.
