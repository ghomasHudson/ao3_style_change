"That would be my doing- Don't worry, he hasn't been strangled!-" A little more to myself than to Molly I add: "-Atleast not by a crazy person in an ally"
She stays silent, the poor thing, no doubt too embarrassed to say anything else. Sherlock takes the initiative to bid her goodbye and within a few minutes, we are back in the cab, but with Rosie gurgling happily in my lap.
I've improved a lot in my writing and I've decided to re-develop this work, mostly just fixing minor spelling errors and such. The plot will still be the same, just of better quality and a bit more depth!
"Do you mean 'what happened' as in what caused my body to nearly shut down, or 'what happened as in what caused me to overdose ?" I ask, letting a tone of sarcasm and irritation slip it's way, seemlessly, into the conversation.
For some inexplicable reason, we had both gotten slightly intoxicated by countless glasses of red wine. It was just enough for the two of us to become giddy and slightly rough and touchy.
”You do know that you could always come and stay with me if you are in need ” Sherlock says in a matter-of-factly sort of way.
He strides into the living room with the same arrogancy as usual. He has his umbrella in one hand and todays paper in another.
Molly welcomes us at the door with Rosie in her arms. She eyes us up and down and her gaze locks at Sherlock. The trail of bruises marking the skin on his neck, going ever downward, toward the collar of his shirt.
I long with all my being for Sherlock to come home and lie down next to me, draping his long arms around me like he did before.
I didn't want to write anything else except this quote from the last episode of season 4. I think it leaves just enough room for the imagination. I might continue it when/if there's a season 5. All one can do is hope.
"Anyway, Rosie has been lovely, as happy as ever! Um..." She sighs "I can't remember... Oh! She's eaten all the fruit puree, so you might want to get some more if you haven't got any at home!"
He stands up and strides toward the door. "Oh, and put on some trousers. I don't believe you'll end up doing much
The London morning is crisp, wiping away any remains of sleepiness in my brain. There is already a considerable amount of people outside, but, I quickly remind myself that it makes sense since it’s Tuesday.
"I know what you two could become. Because I know who you really are; A junkie who solves crimes to get high and the doctor who never came home from the war."
The top of his shirt is slightly unbuttoned and his neck and collarbones are exposed. I have to fight the urge to walk over to him and unbutton the rest.
But I don’t have a case. I never did, I just wanted to see him. I had to see him. The guilt caused by what happened to Mary has been haunting me, and he seems like the only thing to help me out of the trench of self-hatred. It's egotistical, I know, but when cocaine doesn't even do the trick anymore, there's only so much one can do.
The only thing in my field of vision is a mop of black curls above me and Sherlock's firm chest. Instead of getting up, like I should do, to go and pick up Rosie, I slip back into bed and snuggle close to him. I bury my nose in his hair and inhale deeply. His scent fills my nose, electrifying me. His muscles start to move and I hear a low grunt from his chest.
By now it's around 3 o'clock. I put on one of Sherlock's old t-shirts and climb into his bed. The sheets smell just like he does, and they're cold.
"One word, Sherlock, one more word, and I swear to you, you will not need morphine." His voice cracks, and he puts a hand over his eyes, pulling at the skin of his eyebrows.
"Worse. He's a violently inclined mess-" He stops talking and gestures toward the door. I can hear Sherlock's bassy voice, accompanied by two other's, most likely Mycrofts men, from downstairs.
It takes me by surprise, and instead of my muscles slowly awakening and my eyes getting used to the bright morning, I bolt upright and am at once awake.
Closing my eyes, I sink my head below the surface. The idea of the migraine that was starting to form fades away. It feels like I'm in mourning.
As we make our way across the crowded street towards the restaurant I can feel John’s arm brushing ever so slightly against my arm with each step. Every touch burns through the fabric of my coat.
He sits up and swings his legs over the side of the bed. I throw my arms around his shoulders and bite his neck playfully. Sherlock turns around with a mischevous look on his face. I smile and, in one swift motion, I pick him up. He let's out a noise of confusion. He looks like a blushing bride, arms wrapped around my neck and legs swung over my arm.
”Oh, okay.” John looks down at the teacup, before bringing his gaze up and dragging his hands through his hair. I quickly deduce his body language. It translates into… disappointment? Why is he dissapointed?
Uncontrollable waves of complete and utter sorrow wash over me. I let them, sinking into the all too familiar feeling. My body feels weaker than ever before and I let myself slide to the floor.
My limbs are as heavy as led but even so I reach out and attempt to take ahold of his hand. John must have noticed this, for only a moment after I feel his warm skin against mine. Even though my body feels cold, far too cold, my hand is warm from John's touch, and then so am I.
Sherlock never celebrated valentine’s day. That was, of course, before John. Before he had discovered that his love for the doctor was indeed mutual, he suddenly couldn’t stop himself from giving in to all the clichés of a relationship. He frequently bought John flowers, just because he wanted to. He would cook him breakfast in bed. He took him to the movies. Whatever Sherlock could imagine in his brilliant mind, he would execute it.
“Actually, you are. Quite frequently. About me. I’m not just a great fuck,” he mimicked Sherlock’s tone and drew circles with his finger. “I’m much more than that.”
Thank you all for your lovely comments and feedback, it means so much to me (no I'm not crying I swear) ahhhhh
He stepped into the room and vaguely heard Sherlock follow him in and close the door behind them. He stood silently, waiting for John to speak.
I will be telling you the context of other characters as they are introduced in later chapters. And don’t worry, Mystrade fans - there will be some of that later ;)
He took one step towards the door when suddenly he was being grabbed and pushed against a pillar in the room. Sherlock’s face was mere millimetres away from his; his breath hot upon his cheek. “Close your eyes,” he whispered, and John obliged. “I want to kiss you.”
John placed his hands on Sherlocks and carefully removed them from his sleeves. He brought his hands down in front of him and held them, giving them a quick squeeze. “Okay. I’ll stay.”

Sherlock opened one eye in response and John had to stifle a laugh. He looked like a child who was just offered dessert if he ate his vegetables. “Whatever I want?” Sherlock’s tone was teasing and devilish, accompanied by a toothy grin.
Sherlock hummed lowly in his throat and nodded. “Yes,” he agreed, “I do believe you are correct, Captain.” He almost seemed disappointed.
Entering the room, he paused and couldn’t help but smile at the man in his bed. Sprawled out on the sheets clad in nothing but a pair of red boxers, hair mused with sleep, John was now laying on Sherlock’s pillow; a soft smile dancing on his lips.
John beamed at the praise. This was one of many card party events he had attended as an excuse to spend an afternoon with the King. He didn’t care for the card games, God no, he simply needed a reason to be amongst Sherlock’s intimate casual company in his private chateaux instead of the monstrously upper-class palace events where John was almost always required to be stood at attention. He enjoyed the little down time he could get, especially when the King was involved.
“No,” Sherlock breathed, gripping John’s clothes, keeping him close. “No.” He wanted to preserve this moment so badly, this little slice of time where the cool air blew through the windows against their skin and the birds sang. He wished he could explore John’s body and inspect every last inch of him, learn him; memorise him. That way, he’d know what to miss when he was gone. His grip tightened on John. He was hauntingly, heartbreakingly beautiful. It made his head hurt.
“I’d need a Swedish oven, if I’m going to stay here, Sherlock. Can’t cook on those ghastly things,” he pointed towards the kitchen. “Think that’s possible?”
Surprise update! Another short one, but still just as sweet. Next chapter should be a little longer, as a lot will be happening. Thank you all so much for your lovely comments, too! <3
It was at first almost as if he hadn’t wanted to kiss him. The resistance. The fear. His mouth was hard on Sherlock’s, unyielding; then he put both arms around him and pulled him flush against his chest. Finally, their lips softened, and Sherlock’s eyes fluttered shut. They could feel the rapid beating of their hearts against each other. John wound his hands into his hair, those dark, unruly curls, as he’d wanted to do since the first moment they met. His hair curled around his fingers just as he had dreamt. Sherlock’s heart was hammering, and there was a rushing sound in his ears, like beating wings. They broke apart and pressed their foreheads together, gasping for air.
Sherlock gripped the letter with a fierce sense of confusion. He had thrown himself at the Captain not just three weeks ago, and now he was being cold and detached and entirely uninterested.
.” A tiny smirk rose upon his lips and he returned his gaze to their surroundings. The emphasis on the word
He slouched in his chair and looked toward the fireplace, remembering their previous meeting where they sat together and just… talked. An activity that, before John, would have bored Sherlock to tears. But this man somehow fascinated the King, and he found himself never wanting to be away from his company. He pouted, closed his eyes, and escaped the loud room to his quiet thoughts.
He finally pressed his finger into Sherlock, pressing his knuckles against his arse, enjoying the pleasant sounds that escaped Sherlock’s lips. Not so cocky now, John thought. He continued for a few moments before adding a second finger, then a third, watching the way Sherlock’s body writhed beneath him in a silent beg for more.
“Yes, the H refers to my middle name,” he chuckled. He noted the way the King’s eyebrow once again quirked up, as in encouraging him to continue. John shook his head. “Oh, no. I’ll leave that one for Your Highness to figure out.”
“I know, Sherlock,” John breathed, reaching beneath them to grip Sherlocks cock and pull, pleasuring the wriggling man beneath him. He placed a kiss to Sherlock’s shoulder. “I’ve got you.”
They walked across the room and sat themselves in two armchairs. The chairs faced one another but were angled slightly towards a grand fireplace. John admired the room, being sure to sit straight and professional. He allowed his gaze to drift over to the man opposite him, who was, in contrast, slouched in his chair. His hands were together, pressed under his chin. His long legs were outstretched and crossed at the ankles. He looked up at Sherlock and met his eyes. The King’s eyebrow arched at him, and a smirk played upon his lips.
Sherlock’s hands once again found their place on John and he raised his head to press his lips against the man above him. His tongue teased entry and John complied, running his fingers through Sherlock’s curls and down his chest into the bundle of hair below his navel.
Sherlock brought his face back to look at John, his eyes examining him closely, almost searching for an answer. “John
“John,” Sherlock breathed, suddenly unsure where to place his gaze. “Thank you, I… I apologise for my foolishness.”
He had to admit, it did look lovely. The dark room lit up by small candle flames, almost leading a path to the bedroom.
Mycroft rubbed his palm over his face, sighing. “It’s probably a misunderstanding, little brother. Why don’t you just write to him?”
The gentleman smiled genuinely at him. He had approached John in the palace courtyard to introduce himself as Christoph Willibald Gluck - the King’s music teacher. This had captured John’s attention and he found his thoughts drifting to Sherlock’s nimble fingers stroking a mystery instrument.
In the beginning of Axel and Antoinette's correspondence, there's proof that she has replied, but none of her letters were recovered. So, I have to improvise with Sherlock's responses, if that makes sense. Later on though, I will use her actual letters.
“Sherlock Holmes, the romantic. I should put this in my blog,” John teased, and then attempted (but failed) to stifle a giggle at Sherlock’s face. The detective was scowling at him in an attempt to appear threatening, but all John could see was the man he loved, his face still laden with sleep, evident by the crease lines from his pillow. He smiled and reached out, twirling one of Sherlock’s messy curls around his finger. “Thank you.”
John laughed. He actually laughed at the response. How childish! So much for “King of France”, John thought.
“You’re not ordinary, John. Or boring,” Sherlock whispered, his hands still attempting to pull John back to him, desperately missing the contact. “Come back. Don’t stop.”
He waved his hand in John’s direction, dismissing whatever he was about to say. “Don’t worry, John. Forget… Forget about this. It was a bad idea. I shouldn’t have brought you here.”
Two weeks. Two weeks since John had left, promising he would return. Sherlock felt as though he were going insane, staring at the palace walls with pouted lips as if he were a teenager.
Before Sherlock could respond with another smug comeback, John pulled his cock out through the slit in his boxers and pushed himself into Sherlock’s heat. He watched Sherlock’s mouth fall open and his fingers clutch the pillow beneath him, before a filthy moan escaped his throat.
Standing in front of the palace entrance, he recalled some news he had heard a few years prior. It was a few days after the death of King Louis XV, actually. The new King, now in a position of power, had exiled his wife’s lover to please the royal family.
Fun fact - 99% of the diary/letter extracts I'll be using (especially those from John) are actually real and true (except for the obvious few words changed here and there to make it match the characters).
Hello!! So, so sorry for the late update. I've been an absolute mess and my mental health is in shambles right now (lol!). I've been trying to write this chapter since the last upload and I've only just been able to sit and do it. Thank you all so much for your patience with this chapter, and I really hope it makes up for the wait. More to come! I promise! <3
The Captain stood and regained his composure. He would respond, of course he would. But they weren’t anything, were they? The King had his life with the Queen. He had a child on the way. And John would not intrude.
John stirred slightly and fluttered his eyes open, halfway, and looked up at the taller man. A few seconds passed before John finally pulled himself up and rested on his elbows. “Is that breakfast?”
P.S.S. Is there any particular format you guys would like to see? My thoughts are to use a diary entry or exert from a letter to start a chapter, and then expand upon it within the story - up until the letters between the two begin. There is a lot of story to cover before that happens, though.
, he scolded himself. This visit would be purely professional. And, if at all possible, he would avoid the King, simply make himself known to the palace, and leave as soon as he could.
? The man had kissed him, for gods sake, and it had felt real. John had felt truly wanted for the first time in his life. And now this? The utter idiot. He can’t be
Before he knew it, the King’s presence was required elsewhere in the palace. John’s smile - which he hadn't realised he'd had the entire day - dropped at word of the Queen requesting time alone with Sherlock, but the man opposite him only smiled sadly. “Come and see me again, won’t you? Stay a while.”
John rose to take the letter. “Thank you. Back to work,” John ordered with a smile, and sat down in his chair. It wasn’t until he turned the letter over that he felt the air leave his lungs, forcing him to suck in a deep breath. He straightened his posture and gripped the letter tight, fingertips beginning to turn white from the pressure. Something inside him knew exactly who this letter was from.
Sherlock hummed a quiet response, his cupid-bow lips once again turning into a small display of happiness.
Please enjoy this chapter! It's a little short, but I left it on a juicy little cliffhanger so you can all look forward to what's coming (literally coming)
Moriarty is Molly’s lover (I know, I’m playing a little off the “Jim from IT” scene, but hey ho) who is based off Madame du Barry - factually, she was actually Louis XV's mistress, but for the purposes of the story, I wanted Molly to have some happiness herself.
The Captain could have laughed at the man’s childish expression and sudden interest. “I am a Lord of the Realm, Sir. And a military man. I am usually in my military dress, but I understand that these visits are of a less formal nature, are they not?”
Snapping back to reality, Sherlock felt the familiar pool of heat gathering in his stomach, and he reached out to still John’s hand. John understood and, within seconds, was flipping Sherlock onto his stomach and pulling lube out from the dresser beside their bed.
As quiet as possible, Sherlock prepared toast and jam with their usual cup of tea. Placing their plates onto a tray, he tiptoed his way back into his bedroom. Their bedroom, Sherlock reminded himself. This was all still so new to him.
Sherlock simply blinked, blue-green eyes boring into John’s, searching for his words. “John, I... I know we haven’t said it yet, But I... I want you to know that I... My feelings for you are...”
John continued, following the candles down the hallway. “What am I going to find in here?” He quizzed, “it better not be some sort of science experiment”.
Molly rolls her eyes. “Of course not! It’s time for us to do the seance!” she explains, as if it’s obvious knowledge—though it was more likely plotted sometime in the past few minutes over a bottle of wine.
The world around John blurs. He runs after Moriarty with every ounce of strength he has left. And he thinks he may hear Sherlock is calling his name from behind him, but he’s too far away to be heard. Besides, John’s heart is thunderous in his ears, and the helicopters and sirens quickly grow louder and closer.
everyone to know. Everyone in the whole damn universe. I would scream it from the rooftops if I could."
Sherlock is ejected from his Mind Palace. “Come in.” His voice his hoarse; he wonders how long John’s been waiting. There’s really no way of knowing. It could have been hours.
As a medical student, he is well-acquainted with the human body—but his knowledge of William’s body is deeper still. He can draw out his pleasure for hours, or he can bring him to overwhelming ecstasy in the time it takes to finish a cigarette.
Sarah has always been tough as nails, going out of her way to appear alright in any given scenario. He’s 90% certain she’s downplaying the severity of her injury, but he’s also 200% certain that there’s no way he’ll change her mind.
Unless John does the touching first. The words cross his mind, unbidden, as the two men raise their drinks.
"Oh. Hm. Well. I was certainly talking about it this morning, and fairly sure that I was speaking out loud. When you failed to respond, I assumed you simply had no objections." He takes another step towards John. They’re so close that their knees would be touching, if only John’s legs weren’t so short.
Something in John’s expression shifts at that very moment; his smile fades, his jaw becomes tight, and he suddenly seems very, very interested in leaving. He nods towards the florist. “Thank you,” he says. “We’ll be in touch.”
John starts the tiniest bit at her assumption, though it’s not exactly an uncommon one. “Oh, no,” he says, offering her his arm. "Sherlock’s not my—”
Making his way to the El Cortez on foot, John tries to wrap his head around all that’s happening. In just a couple of hours, he’ll be looking at Sherlock. He thinks of his eyes—green, blue, and gold. He can’t help but wonder: will they be harsh with anger when he arrives, or will they soften at the sight of him?
Their bodies have been entwined countless times before, but this time, it’s different. They don't speak of not knowing when they will see each other again; but they don't need to. It’s spoken in the way that they drink one another in, wrapped up together like blankets.
Because it’s true, and he’s always known it to be: In reality, love brings pain. And where there's pain, there must be something to dull it.
His heart sinks to his stomach. But then something catches his eye: a rose bush planted off to the side of the deck. A bee lands there; on one flower, and then on the next, drinking its nectar and buzzing on.
“What do you think, eh?” Stamford waggles his eyebrows over his spectacles as he gestures towards the women at the booth. “Their names are Marci and Elizabeth. Met them at the pool table. Told ‘em it was my birthday, and they asked if they could join us.”
He tries to work it out—why William had to leave his life so abruptly. He goes through a million scenarios in his head, and comes up with nothing.
“Didn’t we?!” Sherlock interjects, freezing mid-pace and planting his feet directly in front of John's chair. "Wait. We didn't?"
“Absolutely.” Sherlock takes his hand and kisses the tips of his fingers. “Oh, and by the way, I’ve just solved the Clarendon murder case.”
“Alright, love.” John finally takes Sherlock’s hand, pulls it in, and places a kiss on the back of it.
“No. Sherlock, listen to me.” John grazes Sherlock's cheekbones with his fingers. “This isn’t how it ends.”
William sighs with a deep dejection, leaning forward again to bury his face into John’s abdomen. “Actually, I’m the one who should apologize."
“He’s pretty clever, isn’t he?” Gabriela grins and gives him a playful push on the shoulder. “I can see why you like him.”
"—and I accidentally dropped a few pieces, and a goose darted up towards us out of nowhere? And it scared you so badly that you rolled onto the ground in a fetal position, covering your entire body with your coat?"
He slumps down in his seat and takes a sip of his Old Fashioned. Shit, it’s good. Really, really good.
As he begins to speak, John feels the gravity of Sherlock pulling him closer, and he doesn’t try fighting it. “Kissing is like… it’s like when you’re drowning, and the other person is your air. Kissing is like solving a puzzle after searching centuries for the final piece. Kissing is like a bridge of energy shared between two people, where time stops and all you can feel is the beating of the other person’s heart.”
The door cracks open and John peeks in. "Yeah, hi. Sherlock, I, erm, look—“ He trails off mid sentence, gaping at Sherlock, who is sprawled across his bed, fully clothed and ready for sex.
He pulls himself up to a seated position in his bed. “Somehow, you look even lovelier than you did when you left this morning," he says. He knows it's the last time he'll get to say so, though it's far from the last time it will be true.
The landing, and Molly Hooper. And Molly’s bungee cord, and Molly’s net, and the harness that Molly engineered. A harness that’s small enough to be hidden beneath one layer of clothing, yet strong enough to hold two men dropping from the second highest building in the Western Hemisphere.
None of that mattered, though, because for one day, he’d gather around the table with his sister and his mum and gorge on ham and Christmas pudding and movies. For one day, he got to pretend his family was happy.
Her name is Heather, and she’s a year his senior, and she has light hair and freckled skin and lip gloss that tastes like orange sherbet.
Sherlock tiptoes to the bed, draws the blankets, and slips in next to John, quieter than a mouse. John doesn't stir. Sherlock sets his head back onto the pillow, closes his eyes, and settles into the comforting ritual of counting John's breaths.
The man’s brow furrows, his nostrils flaring, and John wants to punch that big, stupid nose right off of his face.
The streets are covered in fog, and the sky is blanketed with clouds, and there isn't a celestial body in sight. Other than John's, obviously.
"Hey.” Anderson's voice carries over from the opposite corner of the room; again, something Sherlock does not care to catalogue,
Mary stands a few yards away, still—and the wooden columns of the deck partially cover her view. It’s completely possible, John realises, for her to be fooled; he’s just got to keep her from coming closer.
Sherlock knows he’s being utterly ridiculous, but he’s too wound up at the moment to conceal his reasons. "You and I missed our evening routine, where we ask one another questions and talk about things...and I just wanted to be sure that after last night, nothing has...changed. Between us."
They kiss until they fall asleep. And if it’s the last time, neither of them acknowledge it. They kiss without desperation or longing. They kiss sweetly and slowly. They kiss as though they’ve kissed a million and a half times. It’s entirely possible that they have.
Sherlock's breathing becomes deep and regular; it seems he's drifting off a bit. Even so, he continues to shiver, emitting low moans, clinging to John's fingers as if they're tethering him to Earth.
Molly tells them to settle down as she places her hands atop the planchette—or the ghosts will get angry. But ghosts don’t get angry. Because ghosts don’t exist. And Molly seems to be the only one who’s angry.
John's fingertips make their way to the most sensitive place on Sherlock's head—the place where his hair meets his neck. He rubs slow circles with his thumb and forefinger there before gliding back over his scalp in a light scratching motion.
Molly, who is lying down a few inches away, turns over on her side to face him. “Do you know you’re saying these things out loud, Sherlock?” she asks sweetly.
Gingerly, John tucks his hand beneath Sherlock’s chin, tilting it upwards so their eyes meet. “I don’t need you to.”
A breeze passes. John hears Sherlock’s footsteps behind him—he would recognise the sound of them anywhere.
John drifts his fingers aimlessly over his scalp. “Good. I hope that I can continue to surprise you for a very long time.”
It’s well past midnight—the witching hour. Molly has just placed two dozen unlit candles on the floor with no explanation. She begins to sprinkle generous portions of an especially pungent liquid over them.
Their kiss to comes to an end eventually—at the edge of Mount Kilimanjaro, where a white-eyed bird is singing its first song. The morning light is fast approaching; a forest of clouds surrounds them, spiraling blue and purple and pink, and the entire world is at their feet.
John’s head and heart and limbs and every organ in his body work in unison, begging him to say the words. Sherlock watches him, as well—expression gentle and fierce at once. He's got a way of doing that; of peering through your skin and bones and seeing right into your soul.
William’s face lights up and he clasps his hands together. “Yes! I remember you now. You’re the small, angry voyeur who likes to yell.”
The bookshelves look like something that belong in a dusty old library: the books are leather bound and dated with worn spines and yellowing pages. John finds William’s collection both fascinating and endearing: from Aesop's fables to Shakespeare to philosophy and mythology. Art, music, history, poetry, biographies. And because they’re William's, John takes the time to read the title of every last one.
John rolls onto the bed beside him, sighing happily. “Congrats, Sherlock. Your solution truly did work.”
"Skull," Sherlock answers promptly. "Or maybe violin. Although skull would probably survive the fire. So. Violin."
Sherlock is overcome by a surge of feelings so powerful that he's got no hope of quelling them. An acute combination of relief, affection and desire. An urgent need to kiss John, to be close to him physically, mentally, emotionally. And he feels so much more than that. John's got the uncanny ability to make him feel things he's never felt. Things he hasn’t got the words for.
None of that, however, compares to the craving he has for the taste of William. He wonders if the rest of him tastes as sweet as his mouth does.
"Tomorrow's forecast is partly cloudly in the morning, actually," Sherlock says with a cheeky grin. "It will be clear in the afternoon and evening. There's no rain in the forecast."
John nestles his cheek against Sherlock's cool one. Sherlock's skin is so soft that it nearly causes him to shiver.
John’s eyes go wide with shock, and Marci’s expression grows horrified. Scowling, she rises from the table. "John! Say something!”
"Bees in the countryside," John muses. "That sounds wonderful." His head becomes filled with lovely images of the two of them growing old together in Sussex. Sprawled out over blankets in the green grass; having nighttime picnics while staring at the stars. Sherlock, head of thick white curls, talking about the seasonal behaviours of the honeybee.
Marci. The one who stormed out of The Strand after William viciously insulted her, and John simply stood there and allowed it to happen.
John smiles as he closes the distance between their lips. And as they kiss, right in front of Baker Street, holding one another in the pouring rain, John finally understands what it all means:
of heartbeats. Fingertips skimming down arms and over collarbones, trickling down hemlines and waistbands and lifelines until fingers finally entwine.
"Fucking hell! Sherlock!" Moriarty claps his hands together, filled with excitement. "Do you suppose Mary Morstan
"Good morning," John greets her. “You can call me John.” He tilts head slightly. “This is Sherlock."
And though Sherlock never believed in fairytales, he and John get their happy ending—at the end of their fall, the landing is what saves them.
"Everyone needs a break once in a while. Even myself. Besides, if you didn’t save my life, I would never be able to take a case again. So being there to help you recover was a priority."
John inhales and exhales deeply. “But perhaps the results could be different this time. With me. I mean, if the past few weeks were a test run, we already know how well it works.”
John is shaking with laughter as he turns towards the nightstand. "To be fair, I don’t know what I was expecting," he mumbles to himself.
”Look, Molly,” John says. “I’ve been trapped in a snowstorm with you for all of five minutes, but I can tell that you’ve got so much to offer. You’re beautiful, intelligent, witty, and fun to be around. And although the people you may fall in love with aren’t always a choice, the people you let into your life can be. So I do hope you’ll soon invite someone in who loves you completely for who you are, and who loves all of those wonderful things about you.” His eyes flit back to William. “And someone who won’t drive you to the point of insanity, or to the bus stop in a snowstorm at midnight.”
“It’s pretty wild,” Marci says with disbelief. “All of those things, connected so you could find us? And it actually worked? Someone definitely had a hand in it. The question is: who?”
Especially when her loud, obnoxious text alert rings out from his pocket and fills the entire room, moaning even more loudly than
"Up," he urges, patting him softly. John raises his hips so Sherlock can remove the rest of his clothing, and before he's even settled back in to his chair, Sherlock's got his long fingers wrapped around him. And within seconds, he's got his fingers around his own cock—gorgeous and more erect than John's ever seen it—encasing both of their lengths at once.
“He’s not far," she says quietly. "He’s staying at a house in a small city just beyond the military base.”
“Goodnight,” Sherlock says with a giddy sort of smile, unable to contain the excitement of the case bubbling in his chest. “Thank you for walking me home. And thank you for tonight. It was fantastic, as always. Another perfect ending to another wonderful year.”
“It’s possible someone posted the photo of her on that day as a way of leading you to the library for the next clue,” Gabriela says.
“Oh.” Molly reaches for her phone. “John, the Instagram account you follow with my name on it isn’t actually mine. I don’t even own a cat,” she laughs. “Some of the photos were taken by me—years ago. Like the one at the MIT library.”
“John," she says. "As I said in the message. It’s extremely important you don’t share this information with anyone. If you did, it would mean I could no longer help you."
John lets go of him, taking a few confident strides towards the edge. He takes in a huge breath, and he lets it all out. "Did you hear that, everyone?!" he yells. "I am in love with Sherlock Holmes! Sherlock Holmes and John Watson are in love! It's true! And it's amazing! And fantastic! And sensational!"
“And yet—“ John's eyes flicker with something raw—something unrecognisable. He raises his brows, biting his bottom lip softly.
“John.” He squeezes John’s hand. “Why don’t you get a closer look at it, so you can explain how correct I am?”
Brook holds up a hand. “Understood,” he says, his tone kind but firm. “But it’s not something we can entertain, and that’s all that needs to be said.”
It's half eleven; an hour past the time someone usually comes to help John out of his wheelchair and into his bed.
Sherlock finally looks up at him; his green and blue and gold eyes wide and angelic. There is an indescribable wisdom within them, pulling John in as if they possess their own gravity. It would be jarring if he didn’t, somehow, still appear so innocent.
Sherlock seems to have fallen back into the pattern of avoiding John’s gaze. “Probably for the best. I believe I had a bit too much wine.” He senses John sliding the tips of his fingers over his thumb—a habit he displays when he feels a lack of control.
As he stands, the alcohol overtakes him—he feels warm and peaceful and carefree. And best of all, his heart has almost stopped aching.
He picks up his phone to check the time. It’s half past eleven; much later than usual. He must have slept very deeply.
Though young, Brook was well-known in the field of forensics, and the constant opportunity for investigating cases alongside him became intoxicating.
He tries to drown it out by closing his eyes and envisioning himself and Sherlock living out the same fantasy. Sherlock, rubbing his hard, wet cock against John’s, sliding up John’s sweaty, slick body until he’s straddling his face. Sherlock, fucking John’s mouth, forcing him to bring him to orgasm as John is tied to the bed, whimpering for more.
He’s drowning in John and never wants to be rescued. Overcome with a surge of passion, he slides his tongue back into John's opening as he pushes a second finger in.
John spits out his tea. The distance it spews from his mouth is actually quite impressive; a droplet even lands on the arm of Sherlock’s chair.
Molly and Irene both arrive within the hour, and are met with grateful, eager embraces. Sherlock thanks Irene first—wrapping his arms around her, kissing the top of her head and not letting go for a long time.
As a fake husband, Sherlock's presence isn't questioned by the medical staff. He's regularly briefed on John's condition (a concussion, bone fractures, internal bleeding—spine and skull intact), and he's allowed to stay after all other visitors must leave. This is good, because after surgery, John sleeps for far longer than Sherlock finds convenient.
“I hope that I’m not required to do those things,” he states. “Because I think John looks ravishing in everything he wears, and I love his cooking, and when he texts me, I can’t wait to text him back. Should I suggest that he smile more?”
William slides his palms to the small of John's back, and John circles his arms over his shoulders, raising one leg to wrap around his waist. William moves his hands to the back of John’s thighs, pulling up his other leg and lifting him to sit on top of the bar. He pushes his hips into him, spreading his knees apart—and they breathe heavily together, sweeping their fingers over each other’s arms and tongues over each other’s lips.
It's the best evening Sherlock's had in a long time. With every breath of laughter, every word that comes from John's mouth, he feels a rush of affection.
John’s eyes settle on her shimmering pink lips, and he briefly wonders what would happen if he were to kiss her.
John presses a delicate kiss to Sherlock's collar bone. "I'm here. You didn’t lose me. And you won't lose me. I promise."
The man sets the water onto the table, his eyelids fluttering wearily. “If you believe that Sherlock Holmes is in love with you, you are incredibly foolish. Holmes cares only about his mind. All emotion is abhorrent to him. He referred to it as a grit in a sensitive instrument. A—”
John grins at him—that same sweet, bright, melting-in-the-rain grin from earlier. "That would be nice." He pauses. "Nicely convincing. To the others. Is what I meant to say."
"Oh, for god's sake, why?" Sherlock doesn't think he can handle another moment of John's pensive silence.
“But no kissing,” Sherlock adds, laying his head onto the pillow. “And no holding hands. And definitely do
Sherlock’s eyes fall, and he takes a moment before responding. John braces himself for a difficult answer.
Gabriela smiles at him, wide-eyed, before leaning across Sarah to ruffle his hair. “You know, John," she says, "...you’re even more handsome than I remember.”
Sherlock bobs his head, eyes going a bit blank as he appears to reflect on his and Molly’s interactions. "Alright." He looks back at John. "Anyone else?”
John finally climbs out of his bed, gains his balance, and uses both legs to walk steadily to his wardrobe. He takes out his robe, puts it on, and walks to the door. He takes a deep breath, turns the doorknob, and hopes for the best.
John is thirty-eight, and leaning against a large dumpster in a small London alleyway when he learns that Sherlock Holmes is thirty-four and has never been kissed.
Sherlock looks at the glass, then to the bottle, and then to John. Then he looks to his phone, to the floor, back to his glass, then to John’s form-fitting trousers, and finally, back to the bottle.
“It would be cruel; kissing someone who has a romantic attachment to me, when I don’t feel the same way.”
John thinks he’s misheard, but when he looks up at him, he sees that he's still wearing the same guilt-ridden, distraught expression.
“Gab.” He crosses his arms behind his shoulders, resting his head there like a pillow. “Did Irene tell you what happened? To Sherlock? About his past?”
Another pained groan from Sherlock. “That’s him. Absolutely. It’s one of the gimmicks he uses to lure people in; the supremely corrupt police department in Vegas are so indebted to him that they allow it.”
John freezes mid-sentence, bewildered by the interjection. "I hadn't really considered that you'd be into that, but—"
Sherlock releases his firm grip on John's hair (when did that happen?) and moves clumsily towards his own waist. He touches himself, just like John wants him to. Just as he has many times before. But this time, John is in him and beneath him and around him, and there are words of love between them, and nothing on earth has ever felt like this. The throbbing sensation tugging at his waist, the unrelenting goosebumps forming on his skin. The feeling that his heart is going to come flying out of his mouth and launch itself into the sky.
Sherlock does everything in his power to compose himself as he silently turns to leave. On the way out of the building, he drops his books, hails a cab, and sends a text to Lestrade:
Sherlock opens his eyes to find himself inside a Cathedral with ceilings as high as the cosmos. He sits alone among endless aisles of velvet pews, surrounded by religious artifacts on every side; the room is dark but for the Victorian sconces that line stained glass windows.
William dips his forefinger slowly into the bottle, not breaking away from John's grip. John brings his hand back to his mouth, and William moans as John flicks his tongue over his fingertips.
And Molly is devoted to annoying him. “I’m so happy for you and John," she says. "I'll bet it was so romantic! Was there a kiss?”
"You know, Sherlock....I-" His voice is soft and careful, as if he knows he won't be able to take the words back.
"Oh!" Moriarty inhales. "That’s my cue to leave. But try not to miss me too much—I will see you both again very soon. Toodles!"
Sherlock’s breath catches as John drives his body into his. He goes tense, buries his fingernails into John's shoulders until they prick his skin. John skillfully guides him, and with a shivering exhalation, Sherlock seats himself fully into his lap. Nothing separates them now; they share bodies and breaths and mouths and heartbeats.
John wishes that his stomach would quit doing somersaults. “I don't think I'll ever be ready," he says. "But that's not going to stop me."
Moriarty tilts his head, curiously regarding Sherlock—and for the tiniest of moments, Sherlock believes he may detect a speck of humanity in his eyes. He seizes the opportunity.
"Google it, love.” She peers up at him and rises from her chair; she’s at least a foot shorter than he, yet quite intimidating when she wants to be. “But first…tell me more about last night with John! Please?"
"I could take care of you while you're here,” Sherlock explains. “Bring you food and water when you need them. Pass your phone to you when you're bored, or the television changer, or the newspaper. I could even talk to you about things you find interesting. And if you fall asleep while engaging in those activities, I could ensure that you're adequately covered in blankets. And if you're not, I could bring you more, so you don't get too cold."
William is sprawled back over the arm of a large velvet sofa, wearing nothing but a white sheet crumpled over his chest. John is kneeling, his head buried between William’s spread-open legs, and William has one hand at the back of his head, coaxing him.
“All of my memories were of you.” He chuckles, shaking his head with disbelief. “Almost forty years on earth, and you were all I could think of.” His smile fades a bit. “That’s when I realised that you
She didn’t cut you, then? She sounded like she was about to—“ he makes a slicing gesture across his throat with his finger.
John can hear his blood singing. He bucks into Sherlock one final time, the low roar of his climax rumbling under his skin until at last, it erupts like thunder. And just as it begins, Sherlock takes his face in his hands, pulling him downward for a messy kiss; his hands still sticky from his own release. It’s the most powerful orgasm John has ever experienced; throbbing so fiercely it sends tiny spasms down his thighs and up his lower abdomen. He doesn’t know how long it goes on for; but as soon as he feels he’s wrung himself dry, Sherlock’s light gasps of pleasure seem to drag it further on.
On Tuesday, while sharing his bed with John, Sherlock is introduced to the most pointless game in the universe. If one could actually call it a game. Games are supposed to be fun. This is not.
"Well, yes. Obviously." Sherlock digs his fingers into the sofa to fight the urge to touch it. "Not bad. Just. Different."
It’s as though he’s ventured into a 1920s speakeasy—dimly lit with red and white lights, the faint smell of whisky, leather, and cigars. People at dark wooden tables sip overpriced cocktails as jazz music plays from a piano in the corner. He takes a seat at the bar, and that’s when he sees her:
Sweet murmurs of affection, spurred by longing, lodge in their throats, captured by one another’s mouths. They cling desperately to every part of each other they can reach, as if they’re discovering the curves of their bodies for the first time. They can’t contain the heat of their passion; of all the yearning of the past and all the yearning that they know will come. They kiss until their lips are bruised; dragging their tongues over bare skin for relief, but leaving tiny welts and bruises there as well. They rock together, lips returning to each other as the curves of their bones bury into soft skin.
fault that Sherlock has apparently fallen in love with him. And in saving Sherlock’s life time and time again, he has placed a value on it that wasn't there before. A value that Sherlock never expected to have. And Sherlock doesn't know what this means, except that he's got to be very careful about the choices he makes. He was wary about the potential damage of sentimental attachments before—and none of them were John, his John. So now he must be vigilant.
He claws and digs at them until his fingertips are numb and his nails are bleeding, but he still can’t get past the final layer.
Before Gabriela can protest, Mary stands up from the sofa, taking a step towards him and holding out a hand. “John. May I see your phone?” she asks.
They manage to keep their hands and lips mostly to themselves until they stumble into the storage room; wherein the lip assault commences. John takes Sherlock forcefully by the coat collar and crashes their mouths together. Dizzy and punch-drunk, they fumble at one another's clothing, all panting breaths and heated kisses.
“Sometimes.” Sherlock continues toying with the stem, plucking seeds from it. “Sometimes not. It really just depends.”
His memory of Sherlock approaching him on the pavement after the incident, begging him to say something—anything. That was real. He remembers how very important it was to let Sherlock know that he was okay. And that was the truth. He was in pain, but still breathing, and he could still feel all of his limbs, and he could also still feel that he loved Sherlock. (Real, too, though he didn’t say it out loud.)
Sherlock brings his hand to his mouth; he can still taste John on his lips. "Ermmmmm..." he answers weakly.
“I do,” Sherlock responds. “And believe me—those words, coming from your mouth, are poetry. I love you.”
"You most certainly are!" John has given up the fight; peals of laughter echo through the room. "Do you remember that time we were walking through Regents Park? And we’d just had lunch, and I was carrying some leftover chips—"
Out in the main room, Sherlock is seated in his regular chair, fully dressed. He’s typing on his laptop, so focused that he doesn’t hear John approaching.
His prayers are immediately answered when Gabriela returns. She hands John a glass, squeezes in next to Sarah, and sets her hand on top of Sarah’s leg.
since John has had any form of intimate physical release, and the flat is buzzing loudly with echoes of his bisexual frustration. And it makes no difference if Sherlock retreats to his Mind Palace, or John retreats to his bedroom; it’s a dark cloud, taking up so much space, so permeating that it rattles every one of Sherlock's (many, many) brain cells.
Because once John has fallen asleep, Sherlock opens his eyes. He runs his gaze over John's soft, form-fitting cotton undershirt. Most of the time, John dresses like a man twice his age, but at bedtime, he wears tight cotton tee shirts. Sherlock likes to think that he's the only one allowed to see John like this.
John kisses William with his entire soul, and William doesn’t hesitate, kissing him back with a soul that’s every bit as heated.
“Call off your network.” She rattles him impatiently. “Or I will bury this blade into parts that will make you beg for the sweet release of death.”
John stands, frozen, just a few meters away. He always thought, when this moment came, he’d know what to do. But all he can do is watch.
John walks into the building and checks Molly’s photo: she’s in front of a bookshelf labeled QED72. After finding the location on the directory, he hurriedly makes his way towards the room. When he arrives, however, there’s not a person in sight.
Sherlock pulls away to look down at him. “You kissed me on the mouth during your first night here. And I would like for you to do it again."
The pure joy on is face is something Sherlock has rarely seen; it's irresistible and achingly beautiful, even in the darkness.
John awakens the next morning to the smells and sounds of Gabriela and Sarah making breakfast in the kitchen. His stomach rumbles, but more than anything, he needs to go home, and he needs time alone.
Sherlock bursts into a state of wake, drenched in sweat and gasping for air. He digs his fingers into anything nearby that will root him in place: a disheveled pile of blankets on one side, and on the other side—John.
Sherlock's stomach tightens with John's response; he wants to address the apparent embarrassment, but he suddenly remembers that his shirt is unbuttoned. He scrabbles his fingers over the lapels in an effort to reclaim his decency, if such a thing can be reclaimed. "Erm," he mumbles. "I wouldn't go as far as to say we're idiots."
John's probably seen this door dozens of times, but never really thought twice of it. It seems normal enough; if anything, it likely leads to a broom closet or storage area.
"Then, I would take you into my hands," Sherlock murmurs, his confidence surging with his desire. "...and I would use my hands to slowly take you apart. And I would use my mouth to pleasure you more deeply than you've ever been pleasured before. And I would bring you to orgasm so explosively that you would forget to breathe, and your heart monitor would think that you've flatlined."
It was easy to let himself feel things and do things before John came home. When they were only pretend married. It was safe. And if it ended badly, he could simply blame the game. But real life is real. There's no end date, no quit button until the day you die. No rehearsals. Just a permanent record.
“John, erm… darling...dearest.” Sherlock turns back to John just as stiffly, extending his hand towards him in the same manner. “I’ll be back in just a bit.”
Sherlock clenches his fists, pressing them onto the counter top. "I've overlooked a series of clues so obvious that they may as well have been tattooed on my arm. And while people die, you refuse to get involved because you think I've got something to prove to myself." He leans onto his hands, hanging his head. "Brook, I can't do this alone. I'm asking you, sincerely, to stop trying to teach me and to have some humanity."
fit...in those earrings...which I got you...and which I also definitely noticed that you are wearing. I think...that you should continue to wear them...later...at your flat...while we have sex. Love, Anderson. Aaaaaaaaaaaand send!" Smiling with smug satisfaction, he winds his finger back and pokes the screen of his phone enthusiastically.
Whichever force is at work, it soon grows tired of making pointless board loops. Veering downwards, it points to a single word on the board:
“Oh!” Molly picks up her scalpel. “I need details. How did he tell you? Were there flowers? Is he a good kisser?“
John smiles, wraps his arms around her shoulders and thanks her again. He hugs her for nearly a full minute. It’s fine—he’s got a minute to spare.
“It’s a great honour to be working with you, Doctor Brook,” Sherlock says. “I have been closely following your publications on forensics for years.”
"Oh." Even after all this time, Sherlock seems genuinely surprised whenever John praises him for his cleverness. “You’re welcome.”
Sherlock doesn’t sleep that night. At eight in the morning, he sits for his exam, which he passes with flying colours. Immediately afterwards, he returns to Brook’s laboratory, his pulse racing wildly— both for the lab results, and for the fear that Brook might turn him away.
The kiss is wet and deep and heated, and they breathe into it heavily as Gabriela's hands roam beneath the hem of Sarah’s skirt.
John forces a smile, though he actually feels quite nauseous. He searches for someone—anyone—to take their order who isn’t William. But no such luck. So he inhales a breath of determination and walks right to the bar where William stands. The man’s gorgeous eyes flit to him and quickly away. He combs his gorgeous fingers through his gorgeous hair and turns, darting to the opposite end of the bar. He doesn’t give John a word or a second glance.
"Because…” Sherlock lowers his head, remembering a scripture that once sat in a frame atop his grandmother's desk. “Because he is the one my soul loves.”
"Indeed." Sherlock pushes a few wet curls back from his forehead, his gaze luminous, even in the darkness. He shivers, and John notices that he's still standing partially in the rain.
“I’m not. But until I’ve got proof, I’ll go to the ends of the earth to find him.” John’s surge of passion surprises even himself, but as he settles into the words, he appreciates their truth.
“Every moment that I’m not with you,” Sherlock continues, “...I am reminded of you. Every laugh is your laugh; every smile, your smile. Every taste of my own lips brings memories of them on yours. Blue-grey mountaintops may be the look that you’ve given me in a candlelit room. In the evening, a golden sunset may turn into the many flecks of gold in your irises. Or a rosy sunrise—the colour of your skin, flushed, as it is now. John, you have left a powerful imprint on me.”
He begins to stroll across the grass towards the deck where Sherlock stands. Sherlock braces himself.
If they keep kissing like this, John fears he’ll be lost in his desire—that the craving for his friend's taste will become carnal. So he attempts to end the kiss, but Sherlock bites his bottom lip softly to hang on. John laughs, sweeps his tongue over his mouth once more, and Sherlock finally releases him.
"Perhaps you’ll eventually learn that your charisma can’t solve all of your problems. But right now, to be quite honest, I’m tempted to shove this plate of cake in your face. And if it weren’t Mike’s birthday, I probably would. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got to wash the cocktail off my shirt.”
It could be anything—with John, it could be anything. Here, inside another perfect moment, they kiss one another in the chilly autumn rain—faces slick, clothing drenched, cheeks aching with happiness.
“You love me,” Sherlock states. Though his  voice is timid, the words feel like sweet honey on his tongue.
Mary sets her hand over his. “I’m happy to.” She turns to John. “John, could you excuse us for a moment? I’ve got some business to discuss with Sherlock. The limousine is waiting for you.”
Mycroft peers at his younger brother meaningfully. "I'm afraid I have no power over that, especially as you insisted Mister Watson accompany you."
Sherlock takes John by the wrists, pinning his hands to the headboard and tethering him to the bed. He moves their bare hips until their lengths are parallel, sways and frots against him between panting breaths. Digs his fingers into the hair on John's scalp, takes his cock against his own so greedily it aches.
He was in the middle of examining some plans when the young man approached him, arm outstretched, offering an enveloped letter.
“Fuck, Sherlock...” John managed between thrusts, “those noises should be illegal. Especially from you.”
In light of protecting the King, John had suggested that he organise his living quarters in the Tuileries, so that it would also be possible for them to see each other again in private. The Queen, however, had made it clear that she did not wish to leave Paris, despite John’s opinion that she had made a mistake in allowing herself to be taken there. Molly was, to John, the most irresolute character, and persuading her of the need to take action was more than difficult; no escape plan for her and the King had been discussed, despite it being of massive importance. John had attempted to solve this by writing to George Washington.
HUGE thanks to everyone who was patient enough to wait for me to update. For those of you who didn't see my authors note previously (I've deleted the chapter now), I was so caught up with full time work AND university assignments that were due very close together. But, here I am, I'm back and here to stay!! This story will be completed if it is the last thing I do!
Sherlock beamed and blushed, and John once again reminded himself to praise this man more often. “I’ve not heard that one before. Is it new?”
"I left the ball shortly after, but not before catching the mysterious gentleman glance over his shoulder at me before retreating. I find myself remembering it now. His icy blue eyes, somehow mixed with a splash of green. Dark, unruly curls placed on the top of his head. He was like something out of my wildest dreams."
At this, Sherlock appeared in the doorway and smiled. “I put candles and rose petals around the flat. I thought that was fairly obvious.”
Suddenly, the detectives pants were pulled down and left clinging to his thighs. Sherlock practically squealed at the unexpected cool liquid that now covered his backside, and John laughed, gently pressing a finger to Sherlock’s entrance. “You’re wrong, you know.”
Sherlock simply continued to make such sounds, cataloguing the way John’s grip on his backside tightened and his nails pressed into his flesh. He began to push back into John, meeting each thrust with eager movements, once again reaching his end.
John resumed his dominance, although he was amused by the man beneath him. “Yes. Don’t change the subject. What am I, Sherlock?”
He blinked back into reality to find himself face-to-face with Sherlock who was stood in the doorway with an amused look on his face. The violin was no longer playing. John realised, only then, that he was still standing with his arm raised in the air.
“Oh.” John removed his hand from his face and took a closer look at one of the candles. “Why are they in glass?”
“They’re less of a hazard that way,” Sherlock replied, watching John’s every move. “I didn’t want to burn the flat down, so…”
Sherlock hummed and rose from his chair, finding it a little too difficult to remove his eyes from John. “Learned to at a young age. The gentleman you met at the last party has been teaching me recently… Not that I need it.” He picked up his violin, letting his eyes roam over the sleek wood.
Sherlock’s wife (arranged marriage, remember!!!) in this story is Molly Hooper, based off Louis-Auguste (later King Louis XVI)
“Thank you,” he managed; the tips of his ears turning pink. “That kind of praise is… immense, coming from you, Your Majesty.”
the important military matters, he was treated to dinner and dances attended by other officers and their wives. Now that he had gotten some personal downtime, he made the (
He had been searching for almost a week and had finally found hypoallergenic candles with subtle scents - nothing that would drive John’s nose wild. They were neutral in colour - perfect for John, too, as he hated the ridiculous colours or patterns they’d cover them in - and were in small glass containers. That way, Sherlock thought, the flame would be protected. John would have to really try hard to find something to complain about this time. He bought a few more items before leaving the store.
Opening the door, all John could do was gasp. Okay, this is romantic, he thought. The subtle flickering light filled the room with a dull orange and red glow, accented by the rose petals scattered on the ground and on the bed. “Sherlock…” His voice trailed off. It was beautiful.
, he thought. He gulped. The mans appearance hadn’t changed a bit. His cheekbones stood proud on his beautifully sculpted face-
John swallowed. “You look well,” he struggled, suddenly finding himself thoroughly humiliated by the encounter. He tried to look anywhere except at the man in front of him, but failed. The King leaned forward and tilted his head slightly to the right. John watched as his eyes drifted across
“You’re... John,” Sherlock began, but continued when John only raised an eyebrow at him. “My best friend. Wonderful. You’re a soldier - a doctor. A good man. A great fuck. A war hero. A survivor. My blogger. Not boring. Not ordinary. Mine.”
, he decided, and ran a palm over the light stubble beginning to form on his chin. He wondered about what this meant. Were the King and Queen intimate now? Had they been intimate the entire time?
At the sound of the Captain’s voice, Sherlock stood up so quickly he almost stumbled over before opening his eyes - perhaps he should have done those in reverse order.
If he was going to speak to Sherlock in such a derogatory matter, so be it. He too had a duty to the country, and if correspondence with John regarding military matters was an aspect of this, then he supposed he had no other choice.
Without taking his eyes off John, Sherlock simply waved a dismissal at the voice. “Yes. We’ll be right out.” He blinked. “Will you be joining us, John Watson?”
Finally, though, John had managed to sneak the King and Queen away and into a safe place - for now. Shackled to a wife who remained inert while her enemies butchered loyal servants of the crown in public, Sherlock of course sought solace in John.
There is still a LOT more to cover, but these first two chapters are going to give an insight into the backstory of Sherlock and John in this setting and hopefully lead us up to when they finally meet and the romance begins.
Sherlock sucked in a breath and he averted his eyes from John, locking them onto the ground. He couldn’t allow this to happen. This was a terrible idea. Why had he invited John to his private quarters? What sort of message was that supposed to send?
I tweaked the first and second chapters a little last night, adding a new diary entry. If you haven't seen it yet, please go back and read those first. Enjoy!
Over the past week, John had busied himself with his work. He was a Captain, first and foremost, and he felt he needed to remind himself that he had a duty: to himself and to this country. Tensions were becoming heightened between the civilians and the royal family - something he was yet to understand - his presence needed now more than ever.
Mycroft is based off William Pitt - then British Prime Minister (not until 1778, though) (because of course, Mycroft has to be the British government, or he isn’t Mycroft)
Sherlock knew he wanted to incorporate candles into this valentine’s day surprise, so he set himself the gruelling task of finding candles that John would like.
John rose to take the letter. “Thank you. Back to work,” John ordered with a smile, and sat down in his chair. It wasn’t until he turned the letter over that he felt the air leave his lungs, forcing him to suck in a deep breath. He straightened his posture and gripped the letter tight, fingertips beginning to turn white from the pressure. Something inside him knew exactly who this letter was from.
Hi all! Thanks again for your patience. The next few chapters (not entirely sure how many yet) are going to be in the form of letters. Remember, these letters are the REAL letters sent between Fersen and Antoinette, and that's why I just adore the authenticity of it all. The snarky remarks, the little hints of "I really want to talk to you and see you again but I need to remain professional"... It's just all so perfect and angsty in the same way. I hope you guys can pick up on it with how I've placed them in the story. Hope it all makes sense.
at John’s form. The soldier smirked and leaned forward in his chair to wave a hand in front of him. “Hello? My eyes are up here!”
John had promised. “Just a few days”. Given Sherlock his word. But a week had passed. So, why hadn’t he returned?
The card game seemed to pass by quickly, and soon everybody was expressing their goodbyes with pleasant curtseys and bows. John straightened his jacket and rose from his seat. He turned to face Sherlock, who had also vacated his own seat.
There was the faint sound of the violin falling to the ground beside them. Sherlock didn’t reply; his eyes flicked down to John’s lips and then back to his eyes. And then it happened.
Sherlock’s hands were pressed together, perched under his chin. He was slouched in his chair - as usual - and it appeared he hadn’t heard John. He was too busy literally
Sherlock was now being cradled in John’s arms, preventing his - rather ungraceful - fall. The man holding him blushed and removed his hands from the King’s hips. He smiled at Sherlock.
They stood for a moment, just watching each other, waiting. Sherlock’s eyes flicked down to John’s feet and back, and John shivered a little under his gaze.
It was common knowledge, unfortunately, that by this point in time the King was very much disliked by the public. The French Revolution had begun the year prior, in 1789, and John had been tasked with seeing to the personal protection of the Royals.
John sucked in a breath and almost choked on his drink, leaning forward to capture any escaping liquid from his mouth, mustering all of his strength to appear entirely normal and unaffected by what Sherlock had just said. Meanwhile, Sherlock simply grinned at him, innocence flooding his expression. “What?”
The two men continued to converse until late afternoon. They discussed their lives over the past few years that they had not seen one another. It wasn’t until they found themselves only amongst the company of two or three others that John had realised the other members of the family had not greeted him. Not that he minded, of course. He found himself to be pleasantly relaxed in the King’s presence - not something he had experienced before - and no longer felt embarrassed by his wandering eyes. Sherlock’s eyes were travellers themselves, it seemed, as he had noticed them taking several journeys across John’s body throughout the afternoon.
John nodded, mid-sip of his fruity alcoholic beverage and hummed. “Yes, I am. I hold the position of
, he told himself. The captain had, once again, found himself in Normandy to see a large army camp that was training under the command of the Duke of Broglie. Besides
“Sherlock-“ John began, turning to find him, only to bump into him. Sherlock was stood directly behind John, and reached out to steady him.
It wasn’t long before Sherlock heard the door open and close, accompanied by the familiar jangle of keys as they were hooked up. John’s footfalls came closer until he noticed they stopped suddenly.
At that, Sherlock’s eyes snapped up to meet Johns and he fought hard to hide the blush rising on his cheeks. “Yes, that was me.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at John and took the tray from between them. He found himself stunned, however, unable to finish his action, instead sat perfectly still holding the empty plates. He opened his mouth to speak, but shut it again, powerless to speak.
A little stunned, and very aroused, John unfolded his arms and sighed. “You,” he began, leaning back down over Sherlocks bare torso, “are a force of nature.”
“I’m not,” John replied, “you’re just… very romantic.” He angled himself upwards to place a soft kiss on Sherlock’s lips, the taller man placing his hand behind John’s head to hold him there for a few seconds before releasing him, instantly missing the warmth of John’s touch.
John suddenly felt rather flustered at the authority of the King looking down at him. “No… Not at all, Your Maj-”
John resisted, pulling away to sit back on Sherlock’s thighs. Sherlock whined and squirmed, his hard cock now uncomfortably pressing against his boxer shorts. “What am I then?” John folded his arms across his chest, enjoying the view of a powerless Sherlock riddled with lust.
Now alone in his quarters, he opened a drawer in his desk to retrieve some paper and ink. He sat in the chair and brushed a palm over the surface of the paper. He took a deep breath and exhaled slowly.
John nodded at the friendly gentleman and handed over his jacket. Approaching the main drawing room, he heard many voices. He wasn’t the only one coming to visit the family, apparently.
Maybe Mycroft was right. He should be able to find John’s address somewhere, right? He had to do something. It had simply been too long. He walked over to his brother, a fake grin plastered on his face. “Thank you,
John only smirked. He sat up and patted the empty spot beside him: an invitation for Sherlock to sit. He obliged, placing the tray in front of John, taking his own mug of tea and sipping from it.
Sherlock’s audience had been requested by a family of some sort of importance. He sat in the throne - or, slouched, rather - barely listening to what was being said. He was lost in his thoughts… Thoughts about John. They had met, they had kissed (twice!) and Sherlock had offered him a place to stay in the palace. He said he would come back. John had promised. “Just a few days”. Given Sherlock his word. So, why didn’t he return?
, finally meeting John’s eyes with his own. He noted how his irises were swallowed up by his dark pupils, his breath heavy, mouth hanging slightly open. His body was tense.
The two men spent the next few moments in a comfortable silence whilst enjoying their breakfast together. John couldn’t help but feel his heart swell at the thought of Sherlock doing something like this for him. He felt like the luckiest man on earth, to be witness to the side of Sherlock nobody else saw. The side that held his heart on his sleeve and gave everything he had to give. The side that held nothing back, was caring, was tentative; observant. He smiled up at the curly-headed man.
The next few years passed tediously yet quickly. The Captain maintained his professional position and continued to correspond with the King and Queen in regards to military affairs. Their moments together were never mentioned in writing again, but that did not mean either man had forgotten the intimacy.
Sherlock carefully placed a soft kiss to Johns forehead, - cataloguing the way his skin crinkled and his lips curled upward at the chaste touch - and de-tangled himself, careful not to wake the man beside him.
The Captain almost buckled under the King’s touch. He chuckled. “No, Sherlock,” he shivered under his gaze, “it’s not Henry. Good guess, though.”
Also -- any words or phrases with a line through them means that they would have written it in their diary and then scribbled through it, almost as if trying to hide it or feeling embarrassed by what they wrote.
I will be doing my best to match the dates to the correct timeline as the events happened (this fic is taking a LOT of research, but I hope it will be worth it. If you guys spot anything wrong or out of place, let me know, and I can correct it)
John’s voice, barely a whisper, was enough to push Sherlock over the edge. He felt his entire body tense around John as his climax ripped through him.
Collapsing onto the bed together, the hot, sweaty men shared a look which dissolved into a quiet giggle.
Sherlock threw his head back against his pillow and growled a low guttural sound that tumbled through every fibre of Johns being. He returned his lips to Sherlock, this time against his jaw, his cheekbones, his neck, his collarbones - anywhere John could reach. His hand found Sherlock’s member and gripped as he bit down onto Sherlock’s shoulder.
I am still figuring out a format for this story. I have an archive of sorts of diary entries by Axel von Fersen (John Watson) and I'm not sure whether to start each chapter with an entry, like this one, and then tell the story of what is behind each diary entry. I think I may do it like that for a little while, to get the story going, and then switch it up a bit. It will obviously change when they begin writing letters to each other, but until then, I feel like this is the way to go forward. Let me know what you guys think!
He hadn’t seen the family since his Grand Tour. Hell, he wasn’t even sure he wanted to. Since then, the King had died and had been replaced by Archduke William Sherlock Scott Holmes, the alluring gentleman he had met that night at the ball. Would the King even recognise him?
Seconds later, John’s followed, as he felt him pull out and come over Sherlock’s trembling back with a groan that was explicit enough to ruin anyone.
Sometimes, he’d feel guilt about that. He’d catch her glancing over at him, an expression on her face he couldn’t quite define, but he thought it looked something akin to regret, or remorse.
He lined every surface with candles and walked around the room lighting them one by one. They guided a pathway to the bedroom - that was an accident, but a happy one, for sure - and he decided to litter some rose petals he had bought across the carpet, following the candles lead.
John took the key and turned it in his palm, feeling a little confused. He eyed Sherlock, searching for some kind of answer, but found nothing. He turned to the door, unlocked it and stepped through.
John ignored him and caught his breath. “These are casual events, though. What possible reason could I have for wearing it?”
Sherlock thought perhaps he was being a little too eager, too anxious. What classed as a few days anyway? Two? Ten? Why hadn’t John been clearer? The King stirred in his chair.
Sherlock watched as John looked over his shoulder. He waved at the Captain, and continued to watch him until he was no longer visible behind the obnoxiously large hedgerows. “Farewell, Captain.”
The taller man almost melted with relief and he smiled, the corners of his mouth almost reaching his ears. “Anything.”
Sherlock looked at John for a second before resuming his slouched position in his chair. “You don’t wear those clothes often, do you?”
Sherlock removed his hand and both men instantly missed the contact. John cleared his throat and stood up straight. He motioned toward the courtyard. “Shall we?”
This valentine’s day, however, Sherlock faced a challenge. It was their first and he knew how much John despised candles, evident from the faces he’d pull or the amount of times he’d roll his eyes when he noticed Sherlock’s newest purchase of scented candles.
His eyes flicked to her stomach. They had announced a few days prior that she was pregnant with his child, and due very soon. Only they knew, though, that the child wasn’t his. It was her lover’s. They were yet to consummate their marriage - something that they both knew was never to happen. Not that the public had any business in knowing that. They could think whatever they liked.
John attempted to break away from Sherlock. Why did he kiss him? He could have the King executed for that. And himself, no doubt. He stepped backwards but stopped at the sensation of fingers gripping his sleeves.
Sherlock woke to the familiar tingling feeling he felt in his fingertips - the result of John’s body pressing its weight into the crook of his arm. John’s arm was slung over Sherlock’s torso; his leg thrown over his thigh. Every morning they would wake like this, tangled together somehow.
“Thank you,” John finally muttered, eyeing the room before finding a chair to plop down onto. Sherlock followed, choosing the chair opposite. John swore he could see Sherlock’s eyes devouring him. He fidgeted, slightly uncomfortable, fixing the golden sash across his chest. “I thought I could hear music earlier?”
He returned home and found he had less than an hour to prepare the flat for Johns return. John had been away for a few nights with Harry, reconciling their lost relationship, or something like that. Sherlock had been too preoccupied admiring John’s eyes to have heard the specifics.
John simply nodded - words weren’t a possibility just yet - and he quickly grabbed a towel from the floor to wipe Sherlock’s back before pulling him in for a cuddle.
“It sets off my allergies, is what it does Sherlock. Plus, it’s a complete waste of oxygen. You’re setting small fires around the flat. That’s a safety hazard. You realise that, right?”
He had seen Sherlock a small number of times since the day they had kissed, always sharing a knowing look. It wasn’t until the dangers of the revolution began, though, that John suddenly felt regret for all the years lost between them. He had been holding onto that grudge - the child - and it appeared he just couldn’t ignore the fact. Lord knows he tried.
His eyes darted to the bed once more, and he noticed a gift. John picked up the box and removed the bow, anxious to see what it was. Inside, illuminated by the candlelight, was a single polaroid photograph of John and Sherlock. He recognised it - it was after they solved their first case together. He turned the photo over, it was dated, and scrawled in Sherlock’s handwriting was “This was the day I became yours. I want you to have this.”
Sherlock hummed and slightly leaned into John’s touch, his scowl now softening, and pointed to John’s food. “Enough chatter. Your toast will be cold soon.”
Sherlock waited anxiously in his chateaux, surrounded by guests he couldn’t care less about. Every time somebody walked through the entrance, he sat up, hoping to see the one visitor he actually cared about. But, much to his dismay, every person who arrived was even more dull than the last.
Mrs Hudson is going to play the part of the governess, Countess von Brandeis who raised Marie Antoinette and her two siblings (I actually think Marie had like, 10 siblings, but for the purposes of this story, it will only be two!)
There were military matters that the King needed to know, anyway. He would write to him about those, instead.
John smiled. Ever the detective. He turned the note, and there it was, scrawled in Sherlock’s handwriting.
Sherlock watched as John retrieved his jacket and gave one final nod in parting. At the sound of the palace doors closing, the King sighed and dropped his head into his palms. Sherlock felt something for this man, he knew that much to be true. He considered himself an intelligent man, and had certainly noticed signs of attraction (even arousal, at times) in the Captain’s face, voice and body language. He understood, of course, the repercussions that came with such… amorous exchanges. But they were safe, weren’t they? Sherlock doubted anybody else in the room had picked up on his feelings, as they were far too engrossed in dull conversations with other people present. The Queen had not been there today to meet John, what with her current situation and all. He rose from his chair and paused for a moment before heading up the staircase to attend to his wife. He would do his best not to overthink his friendship with the Captain.
P.S. Your guys' comments have been great. Feedback always gets me on my toes and working on the next chapter. I'm so excited and glad that you guys are enjoying it!
The breathy whisper practically sent John’s body into shock. Sherlock’s mouth had almost brushed against John’s ear; his hand resting upon his shoulder, holding him still.
Sherlock smirked and raised the violin to his chin. From the first note drawn, John felt it was different from anything he had ever heard. The tune began simply, so simply, but eloquent as a human voice, speaking to him, beckoning him gently as the song unwound, spiralling upward, and somehow the tension in the room grew with each note drawn. Sherlock’s eyes remained closed as he swayed side-to-side gently, his fingers flying over the strings, spilling forth surely more notes than were possible from a single man and a violin. For one mad moment, John truly believed there were more of them - there had to have been - an entire orchestra of violins somehow spilling out of just one. It was poetry and seduction and light and shadow. John found it impossible to breathe, yet that was all he was doing, breathing, quite heavily. The music itself had become as palpable as a presence in that room as another person would have been, and its presence was something out of a myth.
The excitement drained from Sherlock’s face. He shoved his key back into his pocket, began pacing around the room whilst mumbling something about
John slammed the letter onto his desk. “Clueless bastard,” he whispered, now rubbing a palm over his tired face. The King - Sherlock - wrote this letter as if he himself wasn’t aware of his own wife’s pregnancy. He was having a child with the Queen of France and appeared entirely blasé about the entire thing. Does he not realise how this had affected
