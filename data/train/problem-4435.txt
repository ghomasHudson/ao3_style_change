“Yeah.” She’s wearing the full gear—mittens, earmuffs, a scarf, the whole lot. She slumps over the cafeteria table. “This is how I’ve been sleeping.”
To put it simply, Dean wallows. They hardly feel like doing anything and instead thinks about all the possible things that could have happened, and what could potentially happen. Something’s off about the air too, and it just worsens Dean’s mood.
“Look, I’m sorry,” says Summer. “But I’ve been growing stronger because of that thing,” they say as they point at the suffocating air, “so I need to be here for longer.”
“Horrible.” Castiel shakily pokes at the top of the porridge with his spoon. The bowl warms his hand. He blows the steam off the porridge, and takes a small bite. It’s bland, and barely has any other purpose than to be a mush in his mouth. He spills droplets as he spoons in more bites, and Sam huffs a laugh at his distaste.
Dean finds him on the roof. Everything is painted gold as the sun sets over the horizon. He hears Dean stop behind him, and he looks over to see him basked under the setting sun.
“Yeah.” Cas grimaces. “It’s not as bad as if I was fully harpy, but my wings still need to molt at least once per year. It can get rather grotesque. The process can be…” Cas clears his throat. “Jarring. You remember when you first found out about me?”
“Yes,” Castiel replies, as sincerely as he can. He pulls Dean in to close what little gap they had between them for another kiss, and Dean wraps his arms around Castiel to hold on. He holds on, and he doesn’t let go.
The ends of his fingers tingle. His heart beats against his ears, but it’s not all he hears. He settles his hand against the door. He pushes. The door creaks open.
Dean winces. “I know that,” he says slowly, “but it’s like he feels guilty about whatever it is, or something. He keeps shitting himself every time I walk into the room he’s in.”
Dean sighs towards the ceiling, and tries the doorknob. No use. “At least come to the store with me.”
Dean makes Castiel sit down with a cold glass of water to sip on while he readies the sandwiches in the kitchen. Castiel watches as the condensation forms on the outside of the glass. Dean has the windows open and Castiel can hear the trees rustling under the apartment in the wind. It’s a quiet mid-afternoon and something smells savoury and delicious as sounds of plates clank out of the kitchen.
He feels Cas’s eyes follow him as he disappears into the kitchen and into the cupboard where their can of hot chocolate mix is. Where their
Castiel stumbles out of his seat, and staggers. The world overturns for a moment, and he grabs onto the chair for support. He gags, but nothing comes out.
“But the victims’ wounds, they were…” Castiel tries to remember what they looked like, what their names were, what he thought might’ve caused it. He stands up, ignoring Dean’s calls after him, and walks to the war room where he left the photos.
Anywho. None of that’s Dean’s business, so Dean doesn’t let the thought linger for too long. It’s not like he doesn’t have other things to be doing right now, anyway.
Even if they were never at the same place for too long, Winter knew when Spring was close by and always eagerly waited for them. Spring always knew that Winter would be waiting for them upon their arrival, and this gave them enough strength to count down to the days when they will meet again. You may have experienced the days when they
There’s a knock on the door and Cas is right there, a bag already slung over his bag. “Dean,” he says, and how many times has Dean explained about talking to people when they’re on the phone, “I’m leaving now, but don’t forget about tonight.”
Cas bristles in his seat, and Dean thinks he’s about to go get another mug full of the stuff, but he just heads to the washroom. Which is good, since Dean hasn’t thought that far ahead about how else he’s going to keep this stuff away from Cas, if possible.
Sam laughs at whatever expression Castiel wears, and claps him on the shoulder one more time before he makes his leave. What a strange thing to be thanked for. He looks back to Dean slouching on his seat, waving a good night at his brother, and maybe Castiel understands after all.
The campus tour guide says something about the particular building they’re staring at and explains the history behind it. Castiel is interested in a detached sort of way, but most of the guide’s words flow over him.
Castiel opens his mouth to refute, but his words are stuck in his throat when he sees the hard set of Dean’s mouth. Something about this is familiar. There’s a faint taste of blood at the back of his throat.
Then everything was cold for quite a while. Not for as long as it was hot, but still cold enough that people nowadays dub it ‘the Ice Age’. There were actually a few of those in between then and now, but when people say ‘the Ice Age’, they usually refer it to that one particularly long period that was featured in a popular animated movie franchise once. This is the time period that’s being described now, and this was around the time when the concept of Winter was born, though they existed for much, much longer than that.
Once again Castiel feels… upset. He didn’t choose to come here. He didn’t choose to stand in this unfamiliar apartment with a stranger who knows nothing about him, and he just wants to go back home.
There’s a knock on the door, and Castiel feels justified enough to be wary of visitors to his room at this point.
“Sure,” Dean replies. He’d been kinda hoping they could hang out for a little bit and the hot chocolate his bribe. “Got a bunch of stuff to do, too.”
It isn’t a big deal. Dean doesn’t seem to think so anyway, as he whistles while he gets the key out. Castiel stares at it all the same, the nagging feeling of missing something apparent now more than ever. That graffiti. That colour. He’s definitely seen it somewhere before. Something in his mind fills up but refuses to tip over, and the smell gets stronger, that
The guy had seemed… well, Dean wouldn’t say friendly, exactly, but he had seemed decent enough. I’d-be-down-with-living-with-you-for-the-next-year-or-so decent. He should’ve known the moment he introduced himself as ‘Castiel’ because really, what human parent with a right mind names their kid anything remotely like ‘Castiel’?
Dean only realizes he’s missed his stop after the bus starts driving again and miserably walks back home.
fucking piece of shit that comes up in our lives. Why, ‘cause you didn’t trust me? ‘Cause you didn’t trust
“Aw, are you crying Winchester?” Jo laughs and ruffles his hair, making confetti rain. Dean laughs and swats her hand away. “Don’t cry! Don’t cry!” they chant and Dean laughs some more as he quickly wipes his tears away, these
He stops. He looks behind him. The door is still there, but it’s not his room. Hasn’t he walked more than a few steps since?
Dean comes home, high in spirit after a LARPing session gone excellent to his favour. He’s pretty sure he and Charlie can take on Jo the next time they meet, once and for all. Which is seriously awesome, because this campaign’s lasted far longer than any of them had expected, and it’s about time they put an end to this long battle.
“I don’t know.” Castiel inclines his head. There’s something very freeing about being able to say so without feeling guilt. “But… I think that’s alright. And I hope that it’ll be with you.”
The bunker is eerily quiet without either Dean or Sam. Castiel can hear every rustle in his clothes as he moves through the bunker, the light buzzing over him, the sound of water running through a drain somewhere, and all of his thoughts. He dismisses them all in favour of sitting down with the photos of the victims laid out before him, studying them for any sort of clues he might’ve missed the first time. All of the victims’ ghastly sunken eyes stare back at him.
Dean flushes. He knows it’s just Cas not understanding what a date is exactly for, but somehow it weirds him out in a weird way. “Intentions matter,” he explains. “There’s gotta be feelings behind those actions. Like you said, uh, Valentine’s is a celebration of romance. And first dates can end up with a kiss, and—other things.”
“Yes, Google and Wikipedia are always helpful. I’m starting to wonder if it would be more effective for me to just go back home and read Wikipedia articles to learn about humanity instead of spending thousands of human money just to learn these—” Cas sets his glare back to his textbook, “—
wanted. There are still bigger things at stake. There are always bigger things at stake than Castiel’s want for Dean Winchester.
“Dean,” Castiel whispers. His voice cracks. There’s a needle in his arm and a familiar pain above it.
Charlie smiles knowingly and Dean lets out a frustrated grunt. “Look, I’m just worried, alright? What if he’s dealing with something by himself and he’s not telling me about it?”
“Hey,” Dean says gently, and Castiel glances at him sideways. “It’s fine, man. Screwing up is a perk of being human.”
Plus, seeing how much it freaked Cas out, he also obviously thinks the very idea is as ridiculous as how ridiculous Dean thinks it is. So. There.
And he was sure, as they kissed again, that the universe had nothing to do with it at all, but it’d been just them all along.
“Oh,” Cas says quietly, when Dean shifts. “Did I wake you? I didn’t want you to get hot chocolate all over yourself.”
”. Weird. Maybe he didn’t find it as interesting? Well, a hit-and-a-miss was bound to happen sooner or later.
He heaves a deep breath, drenched in sweat. There’s faint familiar pain on his right arm—a ghost of what was once there. His entire body is otherwise numb from the lack of movement, and his brain rolls in place like he’s been turned upside down for too long. He twitches a finger, and taps it against the bed experimentally. He flexes his hand. He’s here.
Dean laughs. This was a mistake. “The trench coat is a look I never thought would be for you, but hey, maybe next year, you should be Constantine,” he says, and regrets it immediately. He, Dean Winchester, trademark Bisexual, does not have the strength to see Cas in a Constantine outfit.
“Everything I tried, I’ve failed and only made worse,” Castiel continues. “And now, I don’t have my powers.”
“I’m saying you’ll be happier this way,” Dean corrects gently. “All of us. That’s what you want, right?”
Cas forgot his cowboy hat back at Charlie’s place, and he’s loosened the red scarf around his neck a long time ago. He has it tied onto his belt where he rests one of his hand as they walk back. “It was… enjoyable,” he replies with a nod.
Castiel frowns upon seeing it, and looks up to soak up the sight of the blue morning sky for the last time.
Castiel sinks into the green, green pools of Dean’s eyes. He cares about Dean and Sam. He cares about Dean. He cares so fucking much that it’s burned him from inside out, and he’s still willing. Always willing. Whatever they ask of him, he’ll do. He’ll risk his life for them, but Heaven knows, he knows, the boundaries of his own selfishness.
“With… this.” There’s a sour taste at the back of his throat. “I’m starting to learn that the nature of my intention really doesn’t matter in the big scheme of things.”
It’s a nice day outside. It’d be a shame to be stuck in the house all day and be unable to appreciate it.
Cas shrugs, and runs tired fingers through his hair. His wings are droopy on the floor as he slumps further into the chair. The fact that he can wax all that poetic crap about today is even more of a reason why it’s weird that Cas hasn’t enthused to him about Valentine’s day like he has with all the other holidays.
by Rush. As soon as he plugged the number in, the electric piano and the beats of the drum and the guitar filled the room along with Dean’s heart, and Dean was just glad that they decided to do this whole ordeal while Sam was out.
Castiel jolts awake. His heart pounds in his chest as he stares up at the white ceiling. He takes a deep breath, letting the air circulate his lungs that expand, and deflate as he exhales.
him. He was just fumbling through life in what must’ve been this weird foreign environment, and he must’ve…
of germs,” Dean continues. “And every time you go to the toilet and touch anything in there—which, by the way, did you seriously wear gloves to the bathroom?”
Castiel breaks into a run, footsteps after him. No matter how long he runs, the corridor is endless. He takes in little gasps, not enough to soothe his burning human lungs. His heartbeat drums in his ears, and his stomach lurches, but he doesn’t dare stop. He needs to get out. Dean was here for him. He needs to leave.
Cas smiles, and continues making popcorn over the stove because he’s a dork who doesn’t own a microwave. He’s still in his own work clothes, his white button-up rolled up to his forearms. “Do share.”
“Scootch over,” he says, careful to not spill the popcorn. Cas does as asked, but there’s not much more room to move on his tiny ass sofa, so squished together they’ll be. Like every movie night.
“Whoa, Cas, wait,” Dean squeaks, and clears his throat. “Listen, I won’t tell anybody or anything, alright? So don’t sweat over it. I really am sorry for uh, intruding like that,” he says. “It won’t happen again. I promise.”
It’s hard to accept it. A part of him wants to agree with Sam, let it all be someone else’s fault, but he’s so used to thinking it’s all his fault that it’s hard to accept anything else as the truth. Yet he looks up at Sam now, full of sincerity and believing in everything he speaks of, and he can’t deny him that.
For now, it’s a sad, cloudy day that drizzles snow and rain all day. Dean and Cas hold each other until their time to depart comes too soon, and as Dean departs for the Southern Hemisphere a day later to pay Australia a visit, they can’t shake off the feeling that the worst is yet to come.
Dean scoops the rest of his vanilla ice cream on top of his crepe, and licks up every last bite with enthusiasm that Castiel can’t quite replicate, even though they’re eating the same food. Castiel likes it well enough.
“You’ve been human your entire life,” Castiel says. “I’ve been human for less than a year. I don’t even know what I am anymore.”
Cas is laser-focused onto the TV as he goes through Netflix, and Dean sees the moment he finds an episode from
When Castiel fails to answer, Dean presses his lips together into a thin, displeased line. “You’re letting this get to your head too much.”
—Cas arguing with a short, blonde guy. “—don’t need all this,” Cas continues, gesturing at the bottles and bottles of deep red liquid that now fills up the entire kitchen counter space. Cas glances at Dean, and sets his eyes firmly back on the man standing in front of him.
Castiel inclines his head to meet Dean’s eyes, the man who has so much love to offer that his words drip with its overflow. They’re barely a breath away.
“I don’t know, but I got lost because of it,” Cas says miserably. “It was always around but there’s never been this much of it before. Not to this extent. Haven’t you noticed?”
Cas then makes a hilarious motion of brushing his hand up and down his arms almost like he’s dusting himself off.
Cas blinks, like this is the last thing he expected to hear. He’s still for a while, maybe in shock or something, and takes a deep breath after seemingly working things out in his head.
Sam raises his eyebrows, but doesn’t push him. “Okay,” he shrugs. “Just make sure to come back inside soon, alright?”
Duh. Dean knows that. He’s just not sure why Cas sounds all barb-wired about it. Sure it’s not headline news that Cas gets offended at unexpected things, but not like… this.
him because this is top secret that can’t be leaked because it’ll put the rest of Cas’s family in danger? It’s not like Cas knows Dean that well—they’ve known each other during the last half of the summer and the first few weeks of school, at most.
Hannah is the last to enter through the gate. Before she does, she hesitates. She turns back one last time before she releases her vessel.
Cas shrugs but pure pride still shines through his smile. “Jesse and Cesar helped immensely. They kept it in their fridge for me.”
“If you’d asked, if I knew that’s all you wanted, I—” Dean is confident but still so terrified, and Castiel thinks he understands exactly what he’s feeling. “I could’ve given you that this entire time.”
Castiel frowns upon seeing it, and looks up to soak up the sight of the blue morning sky. He looks around the salvage yard. He needs to work on his case, but it’s nice out here. He wants to go back home. His case with the hybrid. The hybrid.
have a midterm tomorrow and he’d be in a bit of a tight spot, but he might just have enough time management skills in him yet to work with whatever time he has left after costume shopping. “Unless you want to try to find something for yourself…?”
A sharp pain pierces his head, and Castiel topples. If he doesn’t focus, the pain isn’t there. As soon as he notices it, it’s impossible to ignore. “This case wasn’t our thing.”
Dean liked how their name sounded coming from Spring. They always liked how Spring said any of their names, but this one they chose for themselves and so they were
“It was gone by the time I found it. Maybe it was a protection sigil of some sort, though I’m not sure why Bobby would try to clean it up if it was.”
“What? What’s going on?” they ask, and Dean just about punches them right then and there. Only Cas holding them back stops them.
Dean attends Groundhog day. And yeah, okay, maybe Dean’s grasping at straws at this point but they have to do
After a minute of conflict, he goes for it. “That’s nothing to be ashamed of.” Dean rubs the back of his neck. God, this is so awkward, but he needs to power this through. “Sure I’ll admit that it’s not my thing personally, but y’know. Everyone’s different in their own ways, y’know? I don’t judge.”
Cas is flexing his shoulders when Dean looks back at him, the wings gone. Wait, what just happened? He looks behind Cas to see if he’s been fucking with him after all, but there are no fake set of wings lying on the floor, nor are there any feathers poking out from under the couch.
with bumpy ice, and the sides almost like thick icicles that are seen on tree trunks during winter. Jesus Christ. Dean adds a mental note to pick up some insulation film for their own apartment, although that might be overdoing it this year.
“If this is forced, it could cost you your life,” the man says instead, so calmly that Dean thinks he’s misheard him for a second. “I won’t risk that. Not even for you.”
Cas’s wings twitch in place like he’s trying to hold them very still just like how he holds himself right now as he stares at Dean with disbelief. His face grows more and more crimson until the tips of his ears are bright red.
He takes quiet notice of the bandage around his right upper arm. Underneath it is the wound he got from one of the angels that were sent out to hunt him down. Just after the Fall. Just after Hael.
“No. It’ll meld into the car once we finish.” Castiel pauses before he starts the spell. “Is that alright?”
It’s an uneasy feeling that starts from the stomach and grows up to their chest to bloom in their throat and chokes them. Dean realizes that they hated being lonely and they hate it even more now that they know what it’s like to be in Cas’s company. For centuries they had never broken their promise to each other and now one day, Cas just…
Given context, Castiel finds all of their previous conversations forced under a new light. Castiel thought he was being a hindrance, but he was only making Dean feel unhelpful. Unwanted. They are certainly a pair.
The bunker is absolutely silent, almost as if there are only two of them and this room the entire world as Castiel confesses his sins. His head is bowed as Muriel evaluates him.
Cas isn’t human. Dude acts like grocery stores are the best thing to have happened since the dawn of time, he can’t talk to customer services for shit, he loves weird soap operas for god’s sake, and… and…
He closes his eyes again. From somewhere within the depth of this place, there comes a ticking sound not unlike a clock. He counts as the gears turn.
Dean thinks about all those times mom took him and Sam out for trick-or-treating, going to haunted houses, handing candy out on nights he didn’t feel like going out, carving pumpkins, et cetera. He tells him about the time Sam tripped over his cape when he went as king Arthur one year. “He decided to go as a street magician the year after, and dumbass did the exact same thing with his cape. Don’t think he’s worn one with a cape since.”
So. What is his roommate, exactly? Is Cas part of x-men? Or, or—what else can have wings? Birds? Angels? Is Cas an angel? A bird? A plane? No, it’s Superman?
The professor enters the room and Charlie leans over before the actual lecture begins to ask, “Anything you wanna do for your birthday?”
Any other day, Dean wouldn’t have stopped whistling to look at him so bluntly. But something about this man—maybe it’s the long tan coat that Dean sees from the corner of his eyes, or the blue of the guy’s tie that Dean swears he’s seen somewhere before—keeps Dean from going into his car.
His chest rises and falls. He tries to form a word, but finds his mouth too dry. He tries to swallow, only to cough violently from his throat closing up.
He thinks about how Cas sighed. He thinks about the way his wings puffed up, the way Cas’s face fell when Dean told him not to show his wings when he was around.
Castiel swallows down the words. “I want to help you in some way. I thought taking on this case would be what you’d have wanted.”
“No,” she replies and Dean starts to laugh, but she only grows more grim. “I also wear ski pants on top of one of those fuzzy pajama bottoms and these super thick socks that I can’t fit into my boots. Also two sweaters
Dean shoots out a thumbs-up emoticon as a response. He looks back at his reports, and bites back a sigh. Better finish this before next week.
After, they all cram into Charlie’s two couches with a box of pizza and a bowl of chocolate bars in front of them, and argue on whether to watch
“I found,” Castiel tries again, but he can’t grasp at something that doesn’t quite click into place. A chill goes up his spine, and goosebumps form along his arms. His right arm hurts faintly. He frowns down at the victim’s photo. How did he find this case? The man in the photograph looks familiar.
It’s enough. Metatron blinks, and sits forward as if that’ll give him more perspective into the room that he’s watching through a camera. Castiel straightens his posture, and looks at Metatron without wavering.
Dean smiles along and they move on from that conversation easily, exchanging some more small talks before going separate ways. Dean walks to the bus stops.
“Hello.” Castiel sits down, and looks around the balcony. This exact spot, this exact place—something about all of this is familiar, and it’s the strangest feeling. Almost like he’s lived this moment before. There’s a waitress walking up to them, and she looks familiar, too. He shares this observation with Dean, who says it’s probably déjà vu.
Their bus comes then, and they lug their groceries to their seats. “So, yeah,” Dean continues. “It’s mostly going around in costume getting chocolate from your neighbours and carving out pumpkins when you’re a kid.”
we have to work together to keep me up there! Now I’m all over the place and my ice caps are melting and do you have any idea just how long it took me to make those—”
“It’s alright,” Cas says quickly as if he understands how painfully embarrassing it is to misunderstand one’s cultural aspect and make a fool out of himself. Oh, wait. Ha. “You didn’t know what you were saying.”
There it is again. It’s odd to be given a choice when he was never given one before. It was always… one extreme or the other, both of which usually put himself and others in danger. Now that he has a semblance of peace, he has no idea what to do with it.
Maybe Dean should get some shut-eyes instead of coffee. He’s been driving for too long and it’s getting to him.
“Oh. Um. No. I’m not actually phoenix. We’re just… called that since we’re more receptive to heat than other harpies and usually live in deserts.”
Another day, he wakes up from an afternoon nap to Sam’s distressed yelp, and runs towards it without a second thought.
“It’s fine.” Cas darts forward and takes the mug. He sips it there and then and smiles. “It’s great. Thank you, Dean.”
“Sure it is.” Dean shrugs. “We screw up, and we learn. That thing about old dog never learning new tricks is bullshit. You just gotta stop beating yourself up first, you know?”
Cas beams in front of him, candlelight dancing in his eyes. “I believe it’s customary to make a wish.” He holds the cake up.
Dean straightens, like he isn’t sure what to do with the response, but soon his easy grin is thrown back on his face. “Alright,” he says. “Just know I’m around if you need me.”
Dean quells down his disappointment. He knows it’s all a coincidence that just happened to overlap but he’s been looking forward to tonight of all nights. It’s hard to fight against that feeling being destroyed. “Guess I’m heading home too, then.”
Silently, Cas thinks about how terrible of a year it was and how, looking at the rate of which the suffocation grows, this probably won’t be the only time this happens. Cas can only hope that it won’t happen again so severely.
This… whatever it is that they have together has always been comfortable. No, comfortable isn’t the word. They’re used to this, this dance of back and forth, what could be but never will be, and neither have tried to change it from what it is... until now.
Cas nods. “Seeing that I need more... space when I molt, I wanted to do it in the living room so I wanted to know when you’d be home.”
Dean holds one of the photos in his hand. He plays with a corner of it, lost in thought as he stares at the face of the victim. “Hey, Cas?”
There’s a polite knock on the door, which is odd in itself given that Dean and Sam are both out, so Castiel warily gets up to see who it is.
Castiel doesn’t feel it—not as intensely as Dean can—but he can relate. “Yes.” He notes Dean’s flushed cheeks from the cold.
“Let me check with Cas first,” Dean says already taking his phone out. “He’s got a thing going on, so.”
They eventually find something online to help Bobby. Bobby isn’t in a good mood by the time everything is over. One of his kitchen walls is gone, but Castiel knows better than to ask for an explanation. Dean and Sam offer to take Bobby’s books into the bunker, and suddenly they’re left with piles and piles of lore books, and plenty of rooms for them.
The idea is to create a force field around the bunker to keep out anything that has ill intentions towards the residents. Infused with an angel’s grace—
Dean’s hand rests on top of Castiel’s on the drive back home, his grace held in his other. He knows, without a doubt, that he’s made the right choice.
Dean’s stare burns the side of his face, but Castiel fixes his eyes on the sun, nearly blinding him with its full glory.
Dean tugs at Cas’s coat, but it’s too late. Cas wanders to the nearest produce display, and walks along the display with intent, like he’s at a museum exhibition or something. Cas’s learned a lot since his first year living with Dean, but sometimes, especially times like this, is when Dean is most reminded that his roommate isn’t as human as he appears to be. Well, genetically speaking anyway, that he lives with a half-human, half-phoenix breed harpy person. A Half, Cas called himself the first time when Dean found out, said that it was one of the generic terms for ‘things like him’, but, well, Dean thinks Cas is just as much a human as much as he’s the phoenix breed harpy thing. Cas is Cas. Nothing more to it, really.
Castiel pauses. He looks back up at the sky. He could stay like this the whole day, he thinks, basking in the warm sunlight and trying to find an end to that blueness.
“It’s for Halloween,” he gestures towards the HALLOWEEN section behind them. Cas stares back blankly. “Gonna go on a limb here and assume you don’t know what Halloween is.”
Cas gives a noncommittal grunt, and sips something out of a mug. Dean wrinkles his nose as he gets a waft of the smell, strong enough to float all the way back to where Dean’s standing. He peeks over, and yep, it’s the same red stuff that’s been on their kitchen counter for weeks.
“Yes,” Castiel replies. It isn’t a lie. It isn’t the whole truth. It doesn’t matter. “What about you?”
“Dean,” Castiel says, and when Dean looks up, he sneaks in a kiss. It’s nothing more than a quick pressing of lips together, but it’s enough to melt the look away. “Help me draw the sigils?”
“How is it?” Dean asks, wiping some sauce off his lips. “I tried a new recipe for this one and I think it turned out pretty good, right?”
“You chose this,” Dean repeats dryly. “Every time, it was you. Everything I did, I did it for you.” When Castiel doesn’t answer, it shrugs. “I’m playing the part, Castiel. You should do the same if you want us to keep up this charade.”
“Look,” Dean finally says, and shuffles closer. Their knees almost touch. “You’re gonna go nuts if you continue on like this. Me, I always focus on the good stuff.” He gestures at the brightly lit kitchen, at Sam, at Castiel. “Focus on what you’re here for.”
The warmth seeps into his clothes, and Castiel closes his eyes for just a moment. Something that’s been tightly coiled around in his chest loosens.
He sips at it gratefully, and makes his way to the kitchen where the smell of breakfast waits for him. Dean is there, something sizzling on the stove in front of him as he greets him with a smile.
“Jesse and Cesar both came down with the flu,” Charlie says as she leads Dean away from the door. “Jo’s working so she couldn’t come tonight anyway and Ash forgot there’s a project due so he’s working on that.”
“It’s… intense.” Castiel chews thoroughly, but he finds that the taste has no distinctive characteristics of its own. It’s exactly like how Castiel imagined it would taste. “It’s sweet.”
“Why did you take on this case?” Dean asks, not taking his eyes off the photo. “You could be doing literally anything else right now.”
Cas has really bright blue eyes. Dean never thought of himself as having a type before, but lately, he’s been developing a slight bias. “Sure.”
Now some lady is rubbing her stomach while she stares at herself in the mirror, then stares at some dude in her phone contacts. She tells herself that she can’t. It quickly cuts to a man and a woman talking about yet
Castiel watches his sister at work while Dean gulps down the rest of his beer. She quietly makes sure to establish the man and the bartender together. She leaves without a single glance back at him. Maybe she didn’t notice him, or if she did, chose to ignore him and went about her ways. He’s not sure which idea he prefers.
Dean is in the Northern Hemisphere, whistling themselves a tune with wind through tree branches. They’re in a good mood; Cas is almost here and they can feel it in the air. They hope to get a longer glimpse of Cas this year since they were dragged away faster than they’d expected last year. Maybe this time, they might even stay around a bit longer to hang out properly.
“Yeah,” Dean replies. “None of his group members did their work so they had to, like, cram everything in one night.”
“We’ve done this before,” Castiel gasps. “There was a time when I—when you—it didn’t go like this! I—”
“Cas,” comes Dean’s voice, along with Dean’s hand that grabs at Castiel’s. Dean squeezes. That gets Castiel’s attention. “Buddy, stay with me.”
Dean squeeze their arms tighter around Cas. “I—missed you too. What happened?” Dean frown at the suffocating air that surrounds Cas and tries to swat it away but it doesn’t do much. Dean shakes their hand in disgust at how it clings, and jumps in surprise when this creates a snowstorm they hadn’t meant to create. “The hell is this?”
Castiel grabs him by the shoulder now and turns him around to make him look at him, just like how Dean taught him to do all those years ago. “Don’t,” Castiel says, and Dean’s unmasked surprise meets him. “Don’t hide from me. Please.”
Castiel talks to Muriel. Dean is in the room with them, even though he doesn’t need to be. His presence alone gives Castiel enough courage to stay in the room long enough to relay his interest in joining her cause.
Cas raised an eyebrow with a Look and Dean fidgeted with the wrench in hand, avoiding his piercing all-too-knowing eyes.
Dean comes back from his last class for the day, and pauses at the foyer when he smells the unmistakably fruity sweet smell that fills the entire house. Also mixed in the air is the tangy scent of alcohol.
Cas looks up from his cup of coffee and gives such a radiant smile that it has Dean’s breath catch in his throat. “Someone won with a generous donation of fifty dollars. I just received their proof of donation email.”
Castiel fails to see what this has anything to do with the current conversation, but he humours him and nods.
“My wish wasn’t to change you,” Castiel says quickly, and Dean halts in whatever he was about to say. “It was to stay exactly as we are.”
Some of the people in the tour group must be parents with their children who are soon to attend this institution. The people who look more Castiel’s age flip over their pamphlets while they look around their surroundings, excitement written on their faces as they dream about the life they’ll have here. The tour guide says something that Castiel can’t understand entirely but the rest of the group laughs. In a way, it’s almost bitterness that makes him laugh along—he didn’t fit in at home either, but at least he knew what was going on from the years of being there.
“I know. I’m sorry,” Cas says, muffled against Dean’s neck as they lay a small tired kiss there. “I didn’t mean to be. I missed you.”
Dean tentatively looks at Castiel, and Castiel gives him a tight quirk of his lips. He’s alright, he wants to say. They both know it’d be a lie, so he doesn’t.
He rolls over in his bed, and checks his phone. 3:34AM. He rolls it in his hand, the weight of it comforting and
“Hi, I’m Dean,” Dean says with a tight smile, and both Cas and Balthazar turn to him with a blink, like they hadn’t expected the human to butt in. Being a distraction aside, Dean half-expected it from this dick, but he didn’t think Cas would be so riled up enough to forget about him completely.
“Hilarious.” Dean gives a small smile, but it’s more forced, the ease between them gone again. He drops Castiel’s wrists. “Anyway, I should really call Sam. Let him know I’m home.”
Castiel wants to deny her, but he moves aside. She looks around the room. There are blankets and dirty clothes strewn across the floor, and empty plates and mugs piled up on top of his drawer and desk. The TV, paused on a video about how soap is made, is the only source of dull light in the dark room.
They play a few rounds of Munchkin. Everybody backstabs everyone to not let anyone else win and Victor pulls one under everyone by coming out on top in the end while Cas and Charlie are too busy competing against each other for the win. It’s fun, it’s
“Dean did that,” Sam offers as an explanation. At Castiel’s questioning eyebrow, Sam rubs the back of his neck. “We… didn’t know how contagious the djinn’s drug was, but Dean kept arguing we should dive into your head, and, well… You know.”
. His eyes light up, his mind already melding into one with Sir Attenborough, and glances over at Dean for approval. Dean knows that look.
It’s almost like he’s been waiting to be asked, since Cas goes on and on about all these things about Halloween during their entire way back home, and over dinner. They eat the jack-o-lantern shaped cookies for dessert, and Cas’s smile matches the one on the cookie he holds. He supposes it’ll technically be Cas’s first proper Halloween, so it’d be a shame if Dean’s not a cool roommate who doesn’t care about whether Cas spends his first proper Halloween in a proper Halloween way or not.
that look. It’s the same damn look every time, with his eyes wide enough for his blue iris to be showered with light and practically making them sparkle while the rest of his face grows comically stiff. It’s not a look one could miss easily once they know what they’re looking for.
“There was sauce,” Castiel reasons calmly. He’s not sure why—it’s not any different than any other evenings they’ve spent together, yet his heart beats so fast now as he watches Dean’s face flush a deep bright red.
“Dude, it’s apple pie crepe. Not as good as actual pie, sure, but it’s practically the same thing. Why wouldn’t it be good?” Dean takes a big bite of his own and lets out an appreciative moan. “Fuck, so good.”
Dean had noticed, the offness of the air, but they were occupied with Cas’s disappearance that they hadn’t care to investigate it further. “Well, whatever it is, it better fuck off and not do that again.”
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean continues. “And funny thing is, until they decided to call it pomelo, they mostly referred to grapefruits as the forbidden fruit or some shit. They couldn’t wrap their little heads around the fact that just because grapefruits have qualities from both oranges and pomelos, it couldn’t be anything other than an orange or a pomelo, depending on who you asked at the time. It was only years after being called a pomelo that grapefruit got sorted as its own thing—as a grapefruit. See where I’m coming from? Yeah?” He makes a juggling gesture, and Cas’s frown deepens.
Castiel grits his teeth, his good mood from the café deflating. He doesn’t wish to fight, especially when he just met Dean again after so long—but he hates it when Dean’s like this.
They play a game of Catan where they don’t miraculously kill each other after, probably because Cas wins. Everybody else calls it a beginner’s luck, but Dean knows better. So doe Charlie apparently, because she tries to scout him into playing for the next time they start a new DnD campaign.
“Stay.” Dean opens his arms, silently gesturing at Castiel to come forward. Castiel’s body prickles. “Stay here.”
Cas’s other hand that isn’t holding the door tightly, twitches slightly. He looks at Dean like he’s trying to bore a hole into his forehead with his stare alone, and he steps out from behind the door. The door clicks shut gently, and Castiel stands there in front of Dean, his arms dangling by his sides.
“Hey,” Dean starts, because he’s gotta start somewhere. Cas is still holding onto the door like a wall between himself and Dean, and given the way Dean acted when he actually found out, he doesn’t blame him. “Can we… Can we talk? I promise it’s nothing bad,” he adds quickly.
“Sure. I’d rather be working on a case than doing Sam’s nerdy crap, anyway. C’mon, walk me through it.”
“Castiel,” it whispers. It takes a step forward. Castiel pushes again, and the door gives a little. “Don’t you dare. Don’t you
“Yeah, and what’s up with that? You’re an angel, man. Aren’t you supposed to, I don’t know, know all of God’s creatures by default or something?”
Dean leans off the kitchen doorway and walks closer to Cas. He doesn’t know where this courage to accept this is coming from but it’s strong enough to cover up any fears he might have and the next thing he knows, he’s standing right there in front of him. His blue eyes reflect their white kitchen light and he’s beautiful. It dawns on him as quietly as a sunrise breaking through the midst of the night with all these unnamed feelings suddenly summarized into one word. It dawns on him that he’s realized that he’s really, truly in love with Cas while he stood here and watched him wrap cold leftover pizza. Typical.
Dean takes a moment to wipe the caramel sauce off his lips. “So. Any new breakthroughs on your case?”
Castiel blinks. He turns around to find Dean standing at the door, his voice still raspy from sleep. Dean yawns.
He’s so relieved, he almost feels delirious. The weight of Dean’s arm against his shoulder is grounding. It’s incredible that Dean cares so much, that Dean cares so much about
“What about Thursday?” Cas continues and another new hope that maybe Cas is asking to hang out with him on his birthday rises slightly. “When will you be home?”
“Cas, I didn’t want to mention this, but I…” Dean sighs. “I’m looking out for you, okay? I just don’t think you’re suited for this.”
Dean bites his tongue again, and fixes his eyes back onto his meal, poking at it with the flipper. Should he say something else? It feels like he should, but he doesn’t want to overstep his boundaries,
Dean internally shakes his head at himself. He’s pried enough. Probably meeting up with his relatives for molting tips or something harpy-related again.
Cas actually arrives earlier the next year and Dean couldn’t be happier, even though it’s still technically supposed to be Dean’s time. But Cas only shakes their head sadly.
“You’ve changed,” Dean says icily. Castiel’s heart sinks at the tone of his voice. Dean’s eyes are hard and ferocious. “This case—it changed you.”
Well, there’s no rush figuring that out. It’s not like Cas is going anywhere for a while anyway, not until he’s graduated which won’t be for years (and Dean’s not thinking about what Cas is going to do after that, not now when Dean’s so comfortable snuggled up against him like this).
Castiel doesn’t know what a ‘crock pot’ is but he does know pork. His stomach growls and he thinks back to the empty motel room. “Yes.”
“Hmm.” Dean studies the blank spreadsheet more thoroughly and when he realizes what Cas wrote as his username, his heart skips a beat. “‘caswinchester’?”
Cas has both of their mugs in his hands. They must’ve made a sound when Cas accidentally clanked them together or something. Cas smells nice, like the earth after it rains, except that makes no sense because nobody smells that way, as far as Dean knows anyway.
“Jeez, thanks for the vote of confidence.” Dean rolled out from underneath the car and wiped down the wrench he was holding. “We don’t really
“It’s very good,” Castiel says through his mouth full of food, swallowing down the bite along with the lump that’s formed in his chest. “I’d like to speak with your landlord once we’re done with lunch, if that’s alright with you.”
Dean grits their teeth and stomps forward, helpless to do anything about the situation except to hope that humans will smarten up. Surely they see that this is harming them as much as it’s harming Dean and Cas.
There’s tension here, and whatever it is that Castiel did wrong this time, he wants to make it right. He lied in the bed the rest of the afternoon and thought about it, but this is the only thing he could come up with. “Dean, I’m sorry for making you uncomfortable before.”
Dean’s counting on all of these factors when he asks Cas as casually as he can possibly manage, “Hey, so if you don’t have any plans, you wanna come to Charlie’s Halloween party Saturday night?”
Dean sets the mug down, his face as red as the alcohol. “I learned in genetics the other day, that, um, you know, grapefruits are a cross between oranges and pomelos. So I came home and looked this stuff up, ‘cause I thought, that’s pretty cool. I didn’t know that, y’know?” he shrugs. “And apparently, back when they first found grapefruits, people couldn’t decide on whether it was more of an orange or a pomelo. They argued all the time about which one grapefruit should be called as, right, and they actually decided that it’s a pomelo, and yeah, it tastes and looks more like a pomelo than an orange, but a grapefruit is
Just then, he hears the unmistakable sound of the key unlocking the door and Dean is wide awake again. Cas quietly closes the door behind him with a click and his coat shuffles as he takes his shoes off.
By the time Dean’s contemplating on whether dumping all those bottles in the kitchen down the drain is crossing a line or not, Cas slumps back into the couch. He doesn’t ask for the mug back, so Dean just takes a helpless sip out of it to have something to do. Dr. Phil’s voice and dramatic music fills the room.
and they don’t know that Cas isn’t some socially inept roommate who’s overly attached to Dean but an actually different species altogether, and that he’s still somewhat hesitant when it comes to joining the rest of humanity, so he needs at least one human he knows to be there for emotional support. Understandably.
Dean’s thumb absently rubs Castiel’s knuckles. He’s using his own arm as a pillow, folded under his head. “We’re better together, Cas.”
He nods. He knows what he’s here for. Right now, there’s nowhere else he’d rather be. “I understand.”
Castiel doesn’t take his eyes off the photo. It’s not possible that the subject of the photo has disappeared—but that’s exactly what seemed to have happened. This man, he was—
Summer shrugs helplessly. They yawn and shines an extra ray of sunshine down on Australia, giving a few tourists some nasty sunburns. “Well, Spring better be there next year,” says Summer. “I’ve been overworking lately already. I don’t want to cover for them on top of everything else.”
“Are you… I mean.” Dean licks his lips. He hopes it’s not too out of line to ask, because c’mon, he’s gotta have
Within the sweet, clean scents of apples and crepes and coffee, there’s the faint smell akin to sewage again, the same wet rotting smell that’s been following him around. It must be drifting into the café from the streets. Dean doesn’t notice the smell. He looks content. The petals of the zinnias are too bright under the warm sunlight.
“Should I…” Dean experimentally digs his fingers upwards into Cas’s right wing, watching with fascination as his fingers disappear into the feathers. Cas stiffens for a split second before he relaxes with a big breath. “You okay?”
Castiel pauses. It isn’t what he expects to hear. He lets out a huff to deflate himself. “Dean, you don’t mean that.”
Is he disappointed that he can’t spend his birthday with Cas? Yeah. But he also knows how much Cas hates waking up in the morning and yet he still found a way to work around it just to cook his dumb roommate some birthday pancakes. Just the fact that he put that much effort into this means… everything.
Dean reaches up and touches the side of the cup with his finger. He can feel the warmth seeping through the paper cup. “What the fuck,” he announces. “What are you, a fucking dragon? Jesus.”
What Dean says next isn’t something he expects. “Do you remember what the djinn said to me? Before it knocked you out?”
“I know about it. Sort of.” They move up the check-out line. “It’s when the boundaries between realms thin, and humans wear masks to blend in and prevent being killed.”
“Evidence points to one, but the way the victim was killed points to another,” Castiel murmurs. “I’m guessing that it’s a new hybrid of two kinds of monsters. An amalgam.”
Dean scoops up the atmosphere in their palms and studies it. The humans are right—it’s littered with carbon dioxide, even more so than before the friendly meteor came to visit the Earth. Dean shakes their hand off in disgust. This causes another snowstorm that Dean doesn’t mean to make, and so late into the year, too. Dean’s frown deepens.
Castiel rubs at his right arm, trying to rub away the dull pain that’s developed. The fog that was occupying his brain clears like it was never there. “We were here for her.”
Castiel finds the documents just as he left them, and shows Dean all of the photographs. Dean looks through with a concentrated frown, pausing at every photo to study them before he moves onto the next one. Castiel studies them again, looking for details he might’ve missed the first time. Only the victims’ blank eyes stare back at him, open and honest.
This gets Cas going, shrugging on a coat with a pout as he walks out of his room, and tugs on his mittens that Sam had gotten him last Christmas. And, well, the exam’s not exactly a lie—but Cas doesn’t need to know that Dean’s been studying his ass off for the past few weeks, and that he’s more or less ready for the next wave of exams coming up starting tomorrow.
“We literally hunt monsters, Cas," Dean says, more firmly than he means for it to sound. “We make sure people don’t
Dean Winchester regards the woman standing in his living room, and concludes that it’s been a long day. “Roommate,” Dean corrects, slinging his bag off onto the floor.
The world teeters on an edge, and it tilts, and tilts, and spins Castiel around until he can’t think anymore. Castiel needs this case to hang onto.
Castiel closes his eyes. The words sink like stones into the otherwise calm surface of a lake. “How do you deal with it?”
The next time Castiel wakes up, it’s quieter. He groggily opens his eyes, and lets out a deep breath.
The sweet, artificial smell of apples entices him. The petals of the zinnias sway in the wind. “Yes.”
“There you go again, with the grand scheme, yada yada.” Dean grins delightfully at Castiel’s disapproving frown. “Your choice always makes a difference, Cas.”
The broken desks, almost as if someone toppled over it. The shattered chair, thrown around during a fight.
.” He can’t grasp at the edges of his mind, and it overwhelms but refuses to tip, refuses to let him reason with Dean, that photo, that man, that pain in his arm. It shouldn’t be something he needs to say outright, because he
Dean’s lips are a tight line, and Castiel studies his face to make sure that he heard him correctly. The only indication that anything happened at all is the way Dean’s hand falters a little in action, slowing down as he focuses on receiving Castiel’s answer. Castiel swallows around the lump that’s formed in his throat.
Oh, right. Dean forgot about that part where he’s actually gotta decide on what he wants from Cas. He shrugs while he gets out the frying pan. “Hell, you could just give me a hug and call it a day.”
“How?” Cas makes a point to snag a brownie off of the plate. “If we’re going by all the criteria you listed on what’s required for a date, we’ve been on a date every day.”
“No,” Cas says slowly, like an old computer rebooting itself after it blue-screened. “A baby harpy would have their wings groomed by their parents, or close friends would help each other with hard-to-reach places. No,” he repeats, “there’s a platonic aspect to it. It’s circumstantial.”
“…talked to me,” the man’s voice says from around the corner of the gas station. “No, he didn’t recognize me. The spell’s not supposed to wear off until he—” He pauses, probably to listen to the person on the other end of the phone call. “I’m not trying to force anything,” he continues, his back suddenly tense and angry. “
He feels like the biggest pervert in the world, walking in on something like that. Stupid, fuck, he should’ve just stayed on campus or something. Why did he come back home? Fuck.
“I would’ve cooked something else,” Cas says as he joins Dean on the couch, their shoulders knocking against each other, “but I didn’t want to push my luck after the cake and pancakes this morning.”
he? He could barely patch things up when he had all the powers in the world. If he fucks up as a human, how could he ever amend for his mistakes?
She shows him the pictures she took of her windows this morning, which are completely frozen over—not with frost, but
fortune,” she explains in-between wheezes. Dean, Sam, and Eileen are almost roaring from laughing too much as well, and Castiel frowns at them. He doesn’t get what’s so funny. “Well, you
Castiel isn’t prepared for the anger, but it’s something he knows. “You had your hands full with Sam,” he snaps.
They’re at Cas’s place today, stuffed together into his tiny sofa while Dean wiggles around for more butt room.
“What’s for dinner?” Cas demands sleepily. Dean huffs, and tells him it’s mac n’ cheese. “Stovetop or from the oven?”
The case is a standard salt-and-burn, but Castiel’s breakthrough during their research becomes crucial to finding the remains. They stare down at the burning corpse in the pit they’ve created, and Dean thumps him on his back.
“Oh.” Dean’s shoulders sag with relief and he laughs, more genuine this time. “Then why’d you make it so weird when I offered, dude?”
Dean thinks about lying but they’re past that point and it’s too early in the morning for him to think of any real good excuse for his comment. “Uh. Yeah.” He resolutely focuses on poking at the eggs in the pan. “You said it was for a good cause.”
“Yes.” Castiel takes another sip of the coffee. Just as strong and familiar as the first. “How are you?”
Castiel looks down at the paintbrush he holds, dripping yellow paint from its tip. He looks up to find bright yellow graffiti freshly painted on the side of Bobby Singer’s house. It’s even more stark against the blue morning sky, so bright that it’s almost unreadable. So bright is the morning sun that he’s blinded by it all.
For a split second, Dean thinks he’s going to stir it or something, but Cas sips out of the straw before he could get a word in. What.
“I.” Castiel gathers his scrambled thoughts back together. His heart beats faster than normal. “I thought I’d work on my case.”
Dean hasn’t moved, and Castiel realizes it’s because he’s done redressing his wound. He hasn’t let go of Castiel’s arm—his hand’s slid down from where the wound is, and now lightly holds one of his wrists. His eyes roam over the white clean bandages that protect the healing wound underneath, and he’s very, very still.
“No, that’s not it,” he continues, fixing his eyes to the wall in front of him. “I don’t care that I’m a Half. At least.. I don’t think I do.”
They haven’t talked since Dean asked him about the gates to Heaven. Castiel assesses Dean to check if he has any wounds from his trip, and finds Dean watching him in the same way. Castiel averts his eyes.
It’s why Castiel finds himself in the library a few minute later, mindlessly flipping through the books for a way to repurpose himself when he hears footsteps against the marble floor. The owner of it reveals himself to be Dean, who slowly rounds the corner with a small inquisitive frown settled between his brows. He’s wearing clothes Castiel's never seen him in before. He gingerly touches the doorframe, which Castiel finds a bit odd. Dean carefully maneuvers across the war room and into the library, his eyes roaming the area like it’s about to fall apart on him at any moment.
“it’s a holiday to celebrate love shared between people involved in a romantic relationship,” Cas says, looking straight at Dean. Geez.
“I don’t really know how harpies party either,” Cas helpfully points out. “Except maybe the occasional family gatherings.”
And suddenly, staring at Dean’s earnest eyes, Castiel realizes. Or maybe, he’s known all along, and he’s just tired of the pretense. It’s always been about more than the case.
“The public transport system is an abomination,” Castiel replies without taking his eyes off the room’s window looking out the field. Somewhere beyond there is where he used to live with his family.
Cas stopped beside him and nudged one of his legs with a foot. “If you wanted it so much, why didn’t you buy it?”
And there’s always Cas’s birthday (he’s gotta ask about that later) that they can spend together, and there’s always next year for birthdays. That’s how birthdays work so it’s not like he won’t have another chance to spend his birthday with Cas ever again.
“Dean, the case is an excuse,” Castiel blurts, and retracts his arm. He doesn’t mean to be honest. But they’re in his dream. “I wanted to prove to you that I’m still useful, even if I’m…” Maybe this is the only place where he can be as honest as the truth. “I just needed a reason to stay.”
“Yes.” Cas shuffles his wings before he puts them away in the blink of an eye. Dean still can’t get used to the transition. Cas’s face is still red so Dean’s not the only one feeling the temperature. “I have a—I remembered that I have a thing to work on, so.”
“Yeah.” Dean swallows thickly, and bobs his head once. He starts his sigil on the driver’s door. “Of course it’s fine.”
Castiel looks down at the page he was reading, and rubs his eyes. He knew exactly what it was talking about just now, but now the moment he tries to focus on the words, they jump around the pages. “I’m dreaming.”
“What the fuck?” Dean circles around Cas with fear gripping their heart. Cas looks so, so tired. “Cas?”
“Are you serious?” Dean asks with a glare, and Cas turns around to see what the commotion’s about. “They
theories, but before they can even scratch the surface of Castiel’s thoughts on the next installment, Kevin leaves to help someone out with something, too.
He’s about to turn around and start on his cookie dough (now that he’s thought about it too much he’s craving some) when he jumps from a loud ass
An amused quirk settles on Cas’s lips. “It’s akin to taking a bath and I doubt you’d want to be around for that.”
“Oh, Dean,” Cas turns around casually. His wings are poking out from underneath the dark brown trench coat, relaxed as Cas stretches his arms to the side. “What do you think?”
Dean’s finger twitches against Castiel’s wrist. He doesn’t let go. He’s still frowning, and Castiel wants to wipe it away somehow. Dean licks his lips. “Okay—well, the angels falling, that’s not on you either, man. You thought you were doing the best thing for your family.”
Cas walks out from between Jo and Ash with a huge grin and a wobbly looking birthday cake that’s definitely homemade with icing on top that reads
“Nothing,” Sam replies. He’s by the laundry machine with a confused flush across his face. “I found a bunch of rocks in our laundry, and it almost took out the glass at the front.”
He stumbles when he gets to how Metatron cut out his grace and banished him to Earth along with everyone else, and still Muriel says nothing. He confesses to Hael’s death, and how she tried to take him as a vessel.
“I… Don’t worry about it, Cas,” Dean says, and claps him on his shoulders. Dean makes a sound that’s between a laugh and a huff, trying to defuse the situation. “I wasn’t upset or anything.”
He misses his kin. It’s different from how things used to be—when things used to be more simple, and more direct. If she had spoken more than a few words at him, the acknowledgement and the reminder of his position might’ve suffocated him. He’s not reminiscing—not with how things turned out to be—but he wonders about the what-ifs. Always with the what-ifs.
Dean’s still holding onto the photo. Castiel wants to snatch it out of his hands. “This case, it’s getting to you bad.”
“Cas—” A strong hand grasps his shoulder. Castiel sinks further into the soft warm sheets, the pungent smell of the djinn’s hideout far behind him. “Hey. Hey.”
Dean drives by an old battered barn, and he turns to his passenger seat to snark about it only to catch himself at the last second. The passenger seat remains empty, but he can’t shake off the feeling that someone should be sitting there beside him, fond smiles and clasped hands and whispered confessions thrown carelessly into the wind.
“Oh. Shit.” Dean forgives her for stealing one of his chicken pieces, if only out of pity. “That sucks, man. Did you tell the landlord?”
And that’s that. The moment is mostly chalked up as some weird shit Cas can do, like a cool party trick some dude did at some party months ago.
Cas offers an awkward smile in return and suddenly the living room is more stuffy than ever, a thin layer of
“Someone made the sigil-work you and Sam use,” Castiel points out. “Or did you think they appeared from thin air?” He starts on the left wall of the bunker while Dean covers the right.
Now that he’s strong enough to stand, Castiel goes for long walks. The trees that were once full of green leaves have changed colours while Castiel was captured. He finds a trail not too far from the bunker, surrounded by reds and yellows and greens, and a small stream running throughout. He sometimes comes back to the bunker with his pockets stuffed full of acorns and rocks that he likes. He likes to think that they ground him to this world: tethers that keep him anchored to reality. There’s always something new that he doesn’t already know about.
“That’s—different,” Dean grits. “Uh, what else? Since it’s Valentine’s, people give chocolates to each other—”
Someone—pretty sure Charlie—hooks an arm behind his shoulder and they all link arms save for Cas holding the cake, and they start swaying back and forth. “
Cas laughs about something happening on TV, and curls up on the couch snugly. It’s a Wednesday night, but it feels like a weekend somehow. Dean yawns, and dozes off few times until he finds himself blinking awake with his head against Cas’s shoulder.
“What?” Dean checks his phone to find Charlie’s many sent messages about where he was at. “What’s happening?”
Hannah gives a small laugh, but soon turns solemn. “I understand what it feels like to not be able to go back home. It’s the only reason why he did all this in the first place, and… if we keep him locked in there, who knows what he’ll do.”
“I’m an angel. I don’t need to eat,” Castiel replies automatically. His stomach growls. Sam raises his eyebrows.
Dean waits for a moment, and narrows his eyes, but he doesn’t say anything else. Dean leans back in his chair. The taste of grace crackles at the back of Castiel’s throat. Forks clank on plates all around them, and their waitress takes their plates.
Hope rises to his throat, so much that he almost chokes on it. “Nope. Why? Did you want to do something?”
“Yeah?” Dean says as nonchalantly as possible, his body betraying him all the while by sitting up straighter and giving him his full attention away from the TV. Damn it, it’s not like he’s
Dean whisks away a spontaneous thought that a hug from Cas would be priceless because that’s probably the corniest shit he can say right now. “Yeah, I know.”
Dean repeats this in his head, but nope, he still literally didn’t answer anything. “So—what, you can,” he wiggles his fingers in front of his mouth, “breathe out fire or something?”
“Good to be back,” Castiel murmurs. He wants to get up, but finds that he can’t move. His body is a limp mass that weighs him down. He’s cold. He’s hot. He’s all of those things. “Am I dying?”
“Out of everyone I’ve met, you…” Cas’s mouth hangs open slightly, and they search for the right words. “I wanted you to know, but I was never going to act out on it. I was scared that you’d…”
“Wait,” Cas says quickly, and Dean wants to just bury himself into the concrete wall because why won’t he just let him off the hook? “Um.”
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Sam says slowly. “Why don’t you use the shower? It’s still a few hours before Dean’s here.”
Summer does a very rude human gesture because, as we all know, Summer is always at Hawai’i at all times of the year. It’s an inside joke.
“Oh.” Castiel hesitantly puts his own arms around Sam’s huge body. It isn’t as if he could still crush this man if he’s not careful. “Right.”
Dean pours everything he has into the hug. He buries his face into Cas’s neck with his eyes squeezed shut and his body rises with a breath, slumping against Cas as he breathes out. There are arms looping around Dean’s waist and Dean wants to melt into Cas until they’re conjoined like this forever.
The field of gold stretches beyond the horizon, and a silhouette of a bird flies across the golden sky. He used to feel so much more grand, so much more than everything around him, so much like he was part of the sky that stretches before him. Capable of so much more.
Dean lets out a huff in disbelief. “I should be the one asking you that.” He looks around the room, inviting Castiel to do the same. “So this is what you dream about? Being in the bunker…” Dean drops his gaze to the desk where books are scattered all over. “Reading?”
“Sam doesn’t know about this place yet. Actually, you’re the first person in here so hey, welcome to the uh… the Cave. Dean Cave? I still have to work on the name.”
“I’m sorry that you had to go through that,” Cas says, like it’s his fault that he has weird cousins.
They put down a slice of pizza and a bottle of beer in front of him out of courtesy. He doesn’t eat the pizza, but he takes mindful sips of his beer to show that he appreciates the sentiment. Mostly, Castiel sits back and watches the brothers as they laugh over a joke he doesn’t understand.
“I suppose it’s good that we have the distinction, in a way. I’m not a full harpy. It’s… not who I am, Dean. But I’m not a full human, and that’s not who I am, either.” Cas sinks a little more into the couch. “But they always make Half sound so…”
, and if he’s ever had to pick a moment to relive over and over again for the rest of his life, he’s pretty sure this night is one of them.
Dean doesn’t say it to be malicious. There’s real worry underneath the tease, but it only works to emphasize Castiel’s cowardice. “I thought you went with Sam to talk to Crowley. Where is Sam?”
“Yeah.” Dean stares at where Cas was just standing. The smell of pancakes still lingers in the house.
“Can I talk to you for a sec?” Dean glances at Castiel with a tight smile. Castiel’s lungs freeze completely. “Now?” he adds through gritted teeth.
He’s still not really sure if what he did is right, since Cas tenses up in all kinds of way, and goes off. “I know it must be hard for you to understand, and I don’t blame you for it, and if you want me to leave, I will. I just ask you to not—”
It isn’t how Castiel imagined it. Nothing about Dean is how Castiel imagines, and maybe that’s why the djinn failed so spectacularly to capture him in his dreams. Even in his dreams, he was just a mirage, and here, now, Dean is a solid weight around him as they kiss.
The hallway goes on for forever in the dark. He comes across a door, but it’s not his room. He squeezes the doorknob and tries the door, but it’s firmly locked. He continues onward. Has this place always been so endless?
“The angels,” Castiel continues, unable to look up from the ground. “If I had just listened to you, maybe they wouldn’t have—”
“They tried to have me heal you, but the poison’s grip on you was too strong. At first I thought it was odd that it had such an amplified effect, especially since the djinn was already dead.” She pointedly looks around the room. “But maybe you were the one who was refusing to wake up.”
(Though this may seem like they’re moving a bit too fast by human standards, they were fortunately not humans at all so neither saw a problem with this proposition.)
Like Charlie said, it’s his damn life. He’s an adult. Dean’s sure he can take care of himself. Life happens. Things move on. Maybe Cas is just… moving on from him as one of his closer friend and onto other people.
“You know, to celebrate Dean coming back from his hunt.” Sam raises his eyebrows. “You didn’t forget, did you?”
There’s a clattering sound that inches closer, and Castiel looks behind him. He doesn’t have much time. He needs to remember. The sound gets closer. He needs to hurry. The smell overwhelms, so much that he gags—
“How did you do this?” he asks instead. “I don’t… I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t know their ways. Sometimes I think we’re not even speaking the same language.”
Sam’s grin widens, and Castiel finds himself rising from the ratty old couch. Bobby glances up from underneath his cap, but he doesn’t say anything too unkind. Out of habit, Castiel reaches out for Sam, stretches his wings, and takes flight.
Castiel feels Dean tense beside him, but neither Dean or Sam try to do anything to stop him. He has a choice, and that alone is enough.
And the way he says it, the indisputability of something heavy and knowing and significant layered underneath it, wipes all the other questions Dean’s had on the tip of his tongue. Dean studies this man in front of him with his familiar blue eyes and his dishevelled auburn hair and his ugly-ass trench coat, and asks, “Who are you?”
“I know everything you know, Castiel.” It walks with ease, confidence in its stride. “I know what you’re guilty of, and I know that you think you deserve to die for it.”
Dean clutches the mug in his hand. He almost wishes these harpies were here with them, if only to give them a piece of his mind.
Dean gives their best shit-eating grin at Summer, delighted that Cas is just as eager to be here with them as they are. Cas’s grip on Dean tightens a little and Dean’s grin widens. Upon seeing this, Summer sighs and rolls their eyes.
Dean belatedly realizes that he’s trembling, not from talking to the man, but from seeing him walk away.
Cas pauses in his act of putting bread into the toaster. Dean internally kicks himself and cracks some eggs without meeting Cas’s eyes. He gives a quick glance over to Cas, who’s giving him the most charged stare he’s ever seen.
And show up she does, with no keys nor people. “There you are,” she pants, her hair a wild flurry. “Answer your texts for once.”
So, they get along. Awesome. Most roommates Dean’s had before were pretty cool, but some of them weren’t, and he’s heard horror stories about terrible roommates before, so he’s glad that Cas didn’t turn out to be a complete dickwad.
Dean says. “Yeah. No, that’s not gonna cut it. Not this time. So you can take your little apology and you can cram it up your ass.”
Dean’s face falls. He sighs quietly, and turns off the stove to face him fully. “Cas, I just want to spend some time with you.”
humans,” Castiel replies. His heart is at his throat, steadily beating louder and louder. “I caused this, Dean. I should—”
“Cas, I already told you. It was humans,” Dean says, blocking Castiel from moving any further. “The perps were caught by the locals. It was all over the news this morning. It’s none of our business now.”
It’s nice, the hug. Cas hooks his chin over Dean’s shoulder and squeezes with his arms looped over Dean’s arms, encasing him into his embrace. Hesitantly, Dean raises what he can of his arms and squeezes back with Cas snug against his chest, and Cas gives a small content sigh.
Cas stares at him, and he huffs at his face (rude). The corner of his lips quirk up slightly. “Alright.”
The room up for lease is big enough—not enough for his full wingspan that he’s planning on letting out eventually once he has the privacy of his own space, but enough that he’ll at least be able to stretch out the joints from time to time. It’s definitely a big improvement from the rooms he’s seen so far, but settling for this room would really mean that he’s no longer…
Dean blinks. Well, that was a response. “A massage. For your wings.” Dean shifts his weight on his feet, slightly unnerved by Cas’s sudden upped intensity. “I feel bad, y’know? My fault you couldn’t stretch them out.”
There’s a rattle in the kitchen, and Castiel jumps at the sound. Sam walks out from the kitchen, looking just as surprised as Castiel feels, and immense relief settles in his bones at Sam's presence.
Cas makes a pitying sound. Everyone knows how fond Summer is of the ocean’s wonderful coral reefs. “What happened?”
Overwhelmed, Dean buries his face into Cas’s shoulder, not caring who sees him or what they’ll say after. Right now, all he wants to focus on is the way Cas softly lets out a, “Dean?” and bury his face further into Cas’s warmth. He knows it’s so damn selfish of him for being so relieved at finding out that Cas finds him as important and significant as Dean does with him, but he doesn’t let the guilt stop his relief from taking over the rest of his body.
There is a door at the end of the corridor, and Castiel runs, runs, runs as hard as his legs will carry him. The door leads to the bunker’s main room, and Castiel reaches the metal stairs to the exit with the steps rattling under his feet. He reaches the top, and his head spins and his lungs feel like they’re collapsing, but he doesn’t stop.
For another few weeks, Dean waits with abated breaths. They try to make it snow to have something to do with their hands and it turns into a drizzle halfway down to the ground. Dean stares at the drizzle and tries again, but it’s too warm for snow. It turns into a drizzle again.
So Dean digs into the pancakes albeit still a bit bemused that this is all happening, and Cas is right there with him, smiling and eating chocolate chip pancakes with a dollop of syrup and it’s just… yeah. It’s nice.
“Um.” Dean catches Castiel’s wrist in his hands, and Castiel pauses. Dean pulls him back onto the chair, and Castiel follows.
The man gets out of his truck, with his ugly as fuck trench coat that Dean’s always told him to change out of, and his dishevelled hair that Dean loves running his fingers through, and his endless blue eyes that Dean couldn’t possibly live without anymore, and as Dean grins and gives a simple wave, the man’s worried face clear up with his bright familiar grin.
Castiel nods and follows his way back to his room, the smell trailing after him like an afterthought. He slips in under his blankets, and Castiel avoids putting weight on his right arm as he lays back down, back into his dreams.
Cas’s jaw clenches like he wants to say something, but his shoulders slump in defeat. “Have a safe flight back.”
These humans name the suffocation ‘greenhouse gas effect’ and dub the incident as a result of ‘global warming’ and then this changes to ‘climate change’. Dean frowns in confusion because they already know about greenhouse gases—carbon dioxide and stuff—but like Cas had said, those stuff have always been around. It’s never caused them a problem before, and Cas certainly never had trouble making their way through it until now.
Sam’s expression falls. He runs his fingers through his hair, his eyes directed at the ceiling. “Cas, I couldn’t close the gate of Hell.”
Dean wistfully looked back at the beautiful figure of a jukebox displayed at the front of the store, searing her image into his eyes for just a little longer before he hurried to catch up with them.
They stand there, with Dean observing the universe and Castiel observing Dean. Dean shifts on his feet slightly. Dean has these moments as well—the quiet ones where no words are needed, so unusual but not unwelcome from the Dean who’s usually so brash, so loud, so active and sure. Either way, he fills up the world with his presence.
“Every time, Castiel. I told you. You chose to be here with me. Because it’s easier, isn’t it? In here,” it gestures at the bunker, “with them. With Dean and Sam. But it’s okay,” it says. “We can start over again. You’ll have peace. It’s what you want.”
“Kin,” Dean echoes. “Huh. So you’re not… by yourself, sort of deal. So wait, do your parents know about this? Are your parents also harpies?”
Cas nods, and Dean watches him retreat back into his room. He makes himself a cup of hot chocolate with a little bit of the instant coffee mix they have, and sit back down in front of his desk himself.
Castiel looks back at the abyss one last time. He turns the unlocked handle, and pushes the door. It opens with a creak.
Finally, Dean calls out a, “Hey,” and the man’s eyes widen at being directly addressed. Even with their distance apart, Dean can see all the blues of the sky trapped in the man’s eyes. The man tentatively takes his hands out of his coat pockets.
The taste of blood remains in his mouth. The offer itself is enough to cover up any bitterness he might feel for not being offered a place to help out on their case. He’s busy with his own, he reminds himself. Castiel nods with a smile. His lips hurts continuously, the sting amplifying after every pulse of pain. Like a heartbeat. “Alright.”
“I didn—the point is, you have to stop blaming yourself for something you didn’t even mean to do, and let us
“On a run, that freak.” Dean rolls his eyes. “He’s always going on about having to stay healthy and shit. So hey,” Dean says, flipping a pancake. “Sam and I looked into your case while you were in dreamland.”
They watch the rest of the documentary like that, and maybe even holds hands by the end of it, Cas’s stove-made popcorn long forgotten. Dean sighs in contentment.
It’s a quiet night. There’s not much noise in the bunker, save for the occasional whirrs and clicks of the machines and spells working behind the walls to keep this place safe. He studies the details of some of the spells that are visible to his eyes, aware that his hand is slipping off the bottle and his eyelids are heavily drooping down when he’s startled by a gentle tap on his shoulder.
Dean’s taut shoulders don’t relax, and Castiel feels prickles along his skin as he goes back to hiding in his room.
“Well, I am now.” Dean shakes his head, and grabs Castiel’s arm. “Anyway, let’s get out of here. This place is giving me the creeps.”
Dean’s mind immediately jumps to the person Cas was texting a few days ago. Cas still hasn’t mentioned anything about them, so maybe they’re not friends enough for Cas to mention in the first place. A classmate, maybe? A textbook seller?
All of their attentions focuses on Castiel. He scrunches his pants in his fist under the tale as he meets Dean’s stare. “The angels. They need help, and I can’t sit it out forever. I should be the one out there, not you.”
Castiel relaxes. It was by pure chance that Castiel and the people sheltering him were attacked by the djinn, but he still feels responsible for it somehow. He’s only thankful that he didn’t repay their kindness with death. “I’m glad they’re alright.”
he’s completely fine Cas, why wouldn’t he be, and the next thing he knows, he’s in his room closing the door behind him.
Is he honestly getting the Talk from Cas’s family member? It’d be a bit more daunting if it didn’t literally have anything to do with him at all. But, he supposes not all of them are dicks to Cas if she cares about him this much. “You don’t want to see Cas before you go?”
Dean wakes up a little freaked out later that night, his hands clutching the sheets while he blinks up at the dark ceiling.
The bar feels as familiar to Castiel as the café had been, with a burly bartender in a baseball cap who nods at them upon their entry. He sets two bottles at the end of the bar for them.
Castiel glances up at Charlie, who silently urges him to keep Metatron occupied while she reverse-tracks his signal. He looks at the smug face staring back at him from beyond the glow of the screen, at the horror-stricken look on Dean’s face, at all the rest of the angels looking politely not interested, and thinks about just how much he wants to punch Metatron in the face.
a Ravenclaw.” “Don’t judge a girl by her house, Dean.”) and has had a lot to say to Dean in private on his choice of costume for Cas (“I just
“Cas,” Dean says, suddenly gripped with fear that this might be the last time they ever see Cas. “Be careful out there, alright?”
“I—I wished for the angels to have never fallen. I lived here with you and Sam. We… archived Bobby’s books, and we solved cases together.” Castiel watches as Dean’s anger dissipates, replaced by something else he can’t identify. Castiel feels naked in a way he’s never felt before, vulnerable as he lays out his fantasies to the man he wants them from. He won’t look away from Dean. “But it became clear soon enough that neither of us stay the same, do we? It was an impossible wish in the end, and the djinn could never keep up. I just…”
“Yes,” Cas replies. “But I don’t have a costume, and I don’t think we have time to find something for me.”
? Really?” Dean asks, plopping down beside Cas, since he figures it’s a polite thing to interact with your roommate at least once during your lease together.
Dean smiles. “We should do this more often,” he says. “Meeting up. Grabbing dinner together like this. Almost forgot what you even looked like.”
When they pull into the road that leads to the bunker, Castiel already feels tension oozing out of his shoulders. The warm orange light beckons him, the bunker’s familiar door scribbled with unreadable old and new graffiti. There’s one he doesn’t recognize at all, splatters of yellow stark in contrast to the dark of the night.
“This is why I died, Castiel?” she asks. “What you sacrificed my life for? So you can enjoy paradise in your head?”
“Shit, man.” Dean turns around fully to face him, actually worried now. “Did you get something to eat?”
“This is the start of your downfall, Metatron,” Castiel echoes. He raises his chin and looks down at him, thinking of the white room and being helpless as Metatron tore his grace out. Not anymore. “I hope you live it to the fullest.”
Castiel is sitting down, but he’s suddenly falling, falling, falling into an endless hole. He looks from Dean and Sam. They both stare down at him in his chair.
Cas doesn’t budge from where he is, and Dean awkwardly eyes the wall to Cas’s side. This is more awkward than the time Dean accidentally walked in on Sam that one ti—ugh, definitely did
Cas cranes his neck with a wince and look, Dean feels bad. He really does. So he offers the only thing he can think of. “D’you want a massage?”
“No, Dean,” Cas replies, and this guy’s eyes are completely dead. Yeah, dude needs a break. “I would never leave, at least until the lease we signed together for this apartment is up.”
The man’s tensed shoulders drop, and his insistent eyes no longer reflect sunlight as they look away from Dean’s eyes. And for some reason, Dean hates that.
“So,” Dean prompts on their way back, both of them stuffed full of pizza and popcorn and chocolate, “how was it? Your first human party?”
Castiel blinks and refocuses his sight to find Dean worryingly looking at him. The man has green eyes, just like the forest Castiel saw on his way to this city. Lush and full of life.
“What?” Castiel is too surprised to keep it out of his voice, his anger momentarily forgotten. “No, of course not. Both of you’ve been a great help.”
There’s a small dent in the glass, and Sam holds one of the rocks up. Castiel recognizes it instantly. “I’m sorry, Sam. I must’ve forgotten it.”
Castiel tries to remember. There’s a faint taste of blood, there’s the faintly pungent smell, there’s the pain in his right arm. “I don’t know.”
“Why are you being suck a dick about this?” Sam asks with anger of his own, which is something Castiel doesn’t expect. “No, seriously, Cas. Is our help not good enough for you or something?”
“Don’t try to be funny about this,” Dean says miserably. “You’re—” Suddenly they’re choked up, and they want to personally strangle every person who made this possible. “You’re fading.”
“I do,” Castiel replies. The case that he thought was the work of a hybrid. He doesn’t know how to put it all together. He can’t remember a single detail about it. The wound on his arm hurts. “But I want to stay out here a bit longer.”
Dean rolls their eyes and slowly makes their way back up North. They’re starting to get worried now. Cas had never gone flat-out
Castiel wants to grab him by the shoulder and force him to turn around, but he doesn’t do that. “Dean, look at me.” Dean turns towards him again, but still frowns down at the floor. “Dean.”
“I don’t mean to accuse,” she adds gently, quickly. She clears her throat. “I’ve heard a lot of things about the Winchesters, but I don’t think they’re necessarily bad people.”
When they finish breakfast, Castiel slips into the library. They never throw out a case file, so it must be here somewhere. Castiel scouts the area, and the pungent smell follows him. Dean and Sam’s laughter echoes from somewhere in the bunker, and Castiel wrinkles his nose. He takes a deep breath to focus back on the task at hand.
“Our group project.” Cas pauses and leans closer to Dean, so Dean follows. He whispers, “I lied about molting.”
A muscle in Dean’s jaw twitches, and his entire body gears away as he sucks in a shuddering breath. He lets it out as a ground-splitting sigh.
“Why the hell’s the window open?” Dean groans into Cas’s shoulder. He feels Cas glance over to their living room window and gives a shrug. “It’s going to get all cold in here.”
He slowly lifts his head off the table. He blinks sleep out of his eyes, and dumbly stare at the spectacle before him.
Dean starts to clean up the mess that was once their dinner. Castiel helps, not pausing to linger his thoughts on the accidental brushes of their hands when they both reach for the bottles of beers.
The only other role Castiel has in this story is to keep Hannah from going power-crazy like he did once, but that isn’t something he needs to worry about. She’s more humble than he used to be, and he soon sees Metatron locked up behind heavenly bars.
Dean nodded, his lips so much drier than it was moments ago as he queued up the song. For a while they stood side by side with their shoulders snug against each other, letting the music wash over them.
“Yes,” Cas replies quietly. “Like it’s dirty. Like my entire existence is a bane to theirs, as if I chose to exist this way.”
“Dean,” Castiel replies with exasperation. Dean’s stubbornness is like trying to chip at an immovable wall.
“But you found me,” Castiel offers. Dean shakes his head. “Dean, I’d really be dead if it wasn’t for you.”
Castiel glances over the empty photo on the desk. A fire, a tin of beans, kind words telling him to try counting sheep. “The homeless man in the photo. He was the one who gave me food.”
Castiel thought about what he wanted to say to Dean on his way over. He practiced the words in what little time he had and rearranged them and practiced them again so that he wouldn’t do what he’s doing right now. Now that he’s here, he doesn’t know what to say. An apology, for what he doesn’t exactly understand yet. A clarification maybe, for something he didn’t understand until minutes ago. A confession if necessary, for something he understands too clearly now.
Dean’s voice tickles his ear, and an unkempt buzz settles in his stomach. The touch burns through the thickness of his coat, and Castiel inclines his head to meet Dean’s eyes, green and endless like the universe. Just as he remembers them. “Hello, Dean.”
“You honestly think this is your first time to… ‘wake up’?” It shakes its head. “We both know you’re too smart for that, don’t we? And yet, here you are. Still with me.”
“I was cleaning.” Castiel holds up a boot polishing brush, which he’s repurposed when he couldn't find anything to scrub with.
hot— but Dean’s starting to really get the hang of this. Cas seems like he’s responding better too, with the way his back arcs slightly and the way he lets out a sigh every once in a while as his wings shudder under Dean’s touch. Cas’s wings flutter out of Dean’s grasp then, standing up abruptly and almost leaving Dean with a handful of feathers.
Dean caresses Cas’s cheeks, and Cas’s blue, blue eyes flutter open. There are so many good things about being incorporeal entities, one of which is that they will always have each other for as long as the Earth keeps orbiting. The comfort in knowing this is what they’ve lived with for their entire existence, but suddenly this is being stripped away from them and it’s not pleasant to learn that things aren’t as they should be.
Dean listens intently with his mouth slightly open. He shuts it with a vigorous shake of his head. “That’s not—Cas, we’ll talk about this. Alright? We will. For now, we gotta go.” Dean grabs him by the shoulders. His hands are warm and firm. “Cas, you’re
Cas is warm, so Dean opts to stay with his head resting against his shoulder, and his arm almost touching Cas’s. He thinks he mumbles something about what sort of scarf Cas would like, and falls back asleep.
Dean opens his mouth, and closes it again. “Cas, you—” Dean presses his lips together, his knuckles almost white from clenching his fists so tightly. He licks his lips.
Cas thinks about it. His face contorts in an interesting way as he thinks, his eyes screwing up as his eyebrows move up and down and his mouth pursed into a thin line. “No. Not always.”
It’s then that Cas shuffles out of his room stretching and takes a moment to blink at Charlie in split second confusion before his smile breaks through. “Hello, Charlie.”
It’s not something he deserves. He knows. It may not be something he’ll ever receive. He knows that, too. The simple human things that aren’t simple at all, not to him, not to them. Dean had wanted to save him, but what good would he be without his grace, with what he is now?
“What?” Cas answers, and sips at the hot chocolate again. Not even through a stirring stick. Through a straw. He scrunches his face up. “This is very sweet.” Cas frowns, this time probably from the look on Dean’s face. “Did I do something wrong?”
“I mean…” Dean scratches the back of his neck. “I’m not saying that you shouldn’t, but maybe one day… you might…”
“The auction is based entirely around creating stories and art for people who consume existing media and literature.” Cas pauses. “Supernatural being one of them.”
He swears he can almost taste Cas’s name at the tip of his tongue just before he hears footsteps escaping the living room.
“I’m sorry,” Dean says quietly. It feels fragile and Castiel holds his breath. “Cas, I should’ve looked for you sooner.”
“Dude, I didn’t get to sleep until two o’clock.” Dean doesn’t mention how freaked out he got every time he tried to gently grab it and it kept fluttering away. He didn’t want to hurt the little guy, that’s all. “I wish I could’ve grabbed a picture for you, but I didn’t wanna freak it out with the flash. I think it might’ve been a sphinx moth?”
Sam runs his fingers through his hair. He sends a wary glance behind him, almost like he’s expecting Dean to walk into the room at any moment.
“Did the Earth stop spinning or something?” Dean checks. She’s still orbiting the Sun and rotating at the same time as usual. She hasn’t tilted a few degrees overnight—there’s another 245,000 years to go, give or take, before she’s had enough of the angle she’s currently at and tries out a different angle. Dean’s bad mood worsens.
Castiel’s voice is calm when he speaks. “No, it’s alright. Thank you, Dean.” He doesn’t look at him in the eyes. Just in case it shows. Just in case.
Castiel stares at Dean, his tongue suddenly too numb to form words. His lips are dry. The room feels cold. “It’s what you would’ve done,” he answers.
Despite the universal rule to always go forward in relation to the concept of time, Winter stepped back two steps to Spring, and asked, “Stay with me.”
“Mostly just Wikipedia,” Cas admits. He puts a feeble-looking corn in the bag, and Dean internally winces. Oh well, he’ll learn one day. “It was still interesting to read about. Did you know that some think trick-or-treating originates from the practice of giving out soul cakes for children and the poor during Halloween and Christmas?”
Sam steps out from the door. “Oh, hey,” Sam says, a confused frown on his brows. “What are you doing out here? Come in.”
After Dean takes his hand and shakes it firmly, he ushers him inside. It’s a nice clean place—there’s a small kitchen which is divided from the living room by a wall, and a balcony. There’s what can be called a hallway down the living room and two rooms facing each other at the end of the hallway.
Summer nods. “She’s gone sour because of it. She’s at her limit, you know. All the plants are, too.”
After that’s the clean-up, and then back home. Charlie seriously invites Cas to come to their nerd club the next time he’s around, and he thanks her for the invite. Dean watches the exchange as Charlie hugs Cas, and he tears up a little, but that’s really dumb so he’s going to pretend it didn’t happen.
He blinks up those big blue eyes of his at Dean and licks his lips. “Dean.” He rubs his chin and glances back down at the screen. Still blank.
Dean grimaces at the sip of his burnt as fuck coffee while he walks out of the highway rest stop. Out of all coffees he’s had on the road, this has got to be the worst one yet. Still, something about the clear sky today makes sure to keep Dean’s mood light.
It’s all it takes for all of Dean’s anger to crumble down. He looks like he wants to run away, so Castiel grips onto his shoulder tightly.
He’s not sure what to take from that, gauging from his conversation with Balthazar, and besides, with how dad used to be, Dean’s always been… reluctant to take up drinking as a regular hobby himself.
Maybe it’s his exasperation that Dean finds familiarity in, and suddenly makes everything slow down as they breathe together with their chests almost pressed together, but not touching. For a second, Dean is about to open up and Castiel sees it, and he waits, patiently, patiently.
Well, alright then. Maybe the dude’s out. About time too, since Dean’s rarely seen him interact with anyone outside of, well, Dean.
“I’ll treat you guys tomorrow. I promise.” Charlie holds up a hand to Dean’s protest. “Dean, you’re already providing us so much. It’s the least I can do.”
Cas kisses them, as gentle as the morning mist that comes and goes, as lightly as a bird’s song before the sun rises over the horizon. They knock their foreheads together and breathe, away from all the thoughts that make them miserable for a moment.
Dean nods and squeezes his eyes shut. He blows all the candles in one go as they all cheer and someone turns the lights back on. There’s a table of finger foods in their living room with a place in the middle for cake and pizza, and everybody settles down and grabs a piece while they wait for Charlie and Jesse to set up the game of the night.
“No, it definitely got hotter,” says Jo. She fans herself, her own face slightly red. Oh. Temperature-wise, they mean. Duh. “It went from 0 to 100 real quick all of a sudden.”
“You just said that this case wasn’t our thing.” Castiel grips his temples with his eyes shut. There’s a sharp pain that dulls almost immediately.
A headache bids him a good morning. Castiel buries his face further into the pillow with a groan, but he does find a cup of coffee by his nightstand. It’s strong and familiar, as always.
“It’s been forever, Cas!” Dean pats his back with a carefree grin, all teeth and the sides of his eyes crinkled. His smile is infectious, and Castiel smiles back. It really has been far too long.
Castiel frowns and shakes his head. That’s different. “Sam, the harm that Crowley and Abaddon does isn’t your fault.”
Dean dials back down, almost physically leaning away from him. The tension in Dan’s shoulders loosens a little as he listens.
He doesn’t. Dean waits for Castiel to say something, and Castiel finds nothing to say. He can only meet Dean’s eyes, and hold them there as he thinks of nothing else. His mind isn’t occupied by the rest of the world, by the need to repent, by the case he should be working on.
Cas flashed a brief smile and he slipped away out of the garage, every step he took against the concrete floor simultaneous with Dean’s heartbeat.
Castiel snaps back to attention, and finds Dean with an inquisitive look. “No.” There’s no way Dean knows what he’s been thinking about, but Castiel’s face burns. “There was an angel after me.”
Castiel finds this strange. Though he might be new to this community, even he knows this isn’t something that happens normally. “Are you sure?”
Bobby clears his throat, and Castiel looks his way. Bobby wrinkles his nose in distaste. “You telling me there’s a brand new mutant creature none of us know about out there somewhere?”
“Cas.” Dean doesn’t shift from his seat but he feels like he’s on the edge of it. “You know I’m here for you if you want to talk about anything.”
They’re just about done with their groceries, and Dean is making sure they got everything they need, when Cas decides to stop in front of a mechanical ghoul doll that says
“Well, who knows whether I could actually set that thing up to work? I could be pouring money down the drain for nothing.”
“I know,” Anna says quietly and it’s somehow relieving to hear that he isn’t the only one. “I get it. It’s scary. Trust me, I get it. But hey,” she says brightly, “if I can do it, then so can you. I’m here for you. Okay?”
“Dude, you need to relax,” Dean says. He brushes his finger over Castiel’s shoulder, and the slight touch is enough to send a jolt down his spine. “I know that downtime can feel weird, but it’s something you’re gonna have to get used to.”
Sam blinks. Next thing Castiel knows, Sam is pulling him into a hug, and he stands in his arms stiffly. He’s not opposed to it, but just like with Charlie, he’s not sure what to do.
If he had to hide who he was from the rest of the world just to survive, what would he want to hear?
She then jumps out the balcony, and just watching the act gives his stomach a swoop. He rushes outside to watch her flap her giant wings (even bigger than Cas’s) as she soars through the sky.
Castiel looks at its outstretched hand. It has Dean’s eyes, Dean’s voice, but Castiel wonders how he thought it was Dean at all. It copies his face and his mannerism, but nothing can imitate the way Dean warps Castiel’s entire world to focus on him.
Cas beams and Dean resists going right back to burying his face into Cas’s warmth, opting to smile back instead. Everyone else at the party is conversing among themselves and giving them no attention, or so it seems. Dean’s sure he’ll get an earful about it from Charlie later but right now he’s too happy to care.
Well, that explains the furious texting the past few days, he supposes. Why’s the guy so jumpy over a group project, anyway?
It’s been something he’s planned ever since he heard about Hannah’s mission to get his grace back. Making sure to be very careful not to breathe it in, Castiel opens the vial and pours his grace into the bowl with the rest of the ingredients. It puffs up in a cloud of smoke and swirls into the mixture, shimmering slightly before it mixes in completely. Dean physically winces.
Ah. The example is sound, and he’s reminded of his walks in the woods that he doesn’t need, but takes for himself anyway. “I understand.”
Not mentioning what happened before leaves a bitter taste in Castiel’s mouth, but he’s sure he’ll be fine with it in due time. Just like Dean seems to be.
Castiel hasn’t done anything useful since he’s gotten here. They both know the answer to this socially courteous question. “No. What is it?”
Anyway, he’s just glad they got that talk over with. “Alright, good talk,” Dean says, and by knee-jerk instinct he pats Cas on the arm, and definitely doesn’t run to his room.
Silence meets him, and Dean rattles on the doorknob since that usually annoys the hell out of Cas. “C’mon, you selfish prickly asshole! You can’t drink all the hot chocolate and not tell me
Dean shrugs. “About half an hour on foot on a good day. If the bus decides to show up at the stop in front of the apartment, it’s about ten minutes.”
Cas shoots him a confused look, but doesn’t comment further as they sit together and watch some blonde dude stand around looking anxious. The camera cuts to a dark haired dude in a blue shirt. Dean’s pretty sure they’re a
Dean’s not able to find the time to set aside to think over a proper, home-made costume this year despite Halloween fast approaching, bombarded with midterms and projects right beforehand (and isn’t
Dean glares up, and Castiel holds his angry gaze. He takes every emotion Dean’s willing to give him. “Dean, I can’t know why you’re upset if you don’t talk to me.”
“Cas?” Dean calls carefully, because he knows by now to assume it always involves Cas whenever unexpected shit happens around here. He hopes Cas is actually around, and this isn’t another one of his relatives. Anna he can stand, everyone else related to Cas, he’d rather not.
Dean’s smile slips, and along with it, Castiel’s good mood. The room feels constricting all of a sudden.
Castiel wraps his arms tighter around Dean. More than anything, he wants to be as close to Dean as he can.
For the first time since the conversation’s started, she’s uncomfortable. “Don’t be mistaken. I would’ve done it for any human,” she mutters. “You’re responsible for all the chaos out there. Healing you itself could be a statement in this war, and I'm not...”
going on dates with someone could end up with them married. Usually it’s a casual thing though, to get to know each other better before doing all that—marriage couple crap.”
“Um.” Dean lets go with a slide of his hand. Castiel regrets wearing only a t-shirt. Dean’s touch on his skin burns. “How’s your wound?”
, so he’s got it all set up and put on pause while he waits for Cas on the sofa. Cas is taking a while, so Dean turns around to call for him, only to find him just standing there, staring at him and his paused screen.
They stand in their dark hallway, only illuminated by the light from Cas’s room, and they smile at each other while holding hands like idiots. Dean gently lets his hands go, and clenches his fists against the warmth from Cas’s hands that quickly escape his palms. He clears his throat, and pats him on his shoulder. “Dude, it’s like, four. Go to bed.”
Castiel tries not to feel guilty about Dean’s momentary discomfort from his naturally higher body temperature and steps away from him. “How far is this place from campus?”
They’re not on the table. They’re not anywhere his eyes land on. Dean has followed after him, his pancakes forgotten.
He sees the light pouring out from the edges of Cas’s door, and knocks firmly. There’s silence from the other side of the door, but it’s so pointed that Dean can physically feel Cas staring at the door in disbelief. He holds his breath, and he doesn’t even know what he’s going to say, fuck, but… But…
He mumbles a greeting to Bobby who's sitting at his desk with the usual piles and piles of books on top, and sinks into the sofa himself. The fireplace is going even though it’s warm inside and out, and Castiel belatedly realizes how cold he is compared to the rest of the room. He shivers a little, and huddles closer to the fire with his own case file in hand.
“I’m just…” He’s high-strung but has no way to deflate, almost vibrating with energy meant to be spent.
Dean stares. And stares. He doesn’t see any strings or anything that somehow attach the black feathery wings to Cas’s bare shoulder blades. They actually look like they’re…
It shouldn’t be awkward to bring it up, but it definitely feels awkward. “Do you know what Valentine’s is for?” Dean asks.
Castiel doesn’t lead the angels back as Metatron expects. He leaves that to Hannah, who infiltrates Heaven under the guise of betraying Castiel while he plays the bait as the false leader to draw Metatron out.
Sam installs a TV in his room in case he gets bored lying around in bed all day. Sam calls it his room like it’s no big deal, like they’ve always had a place ready for him. Castiel tries to not read too much into it.
“I swear it’s not usually this hot in here,” Dean says. “I haven’t been out all day but it must be really hot out today.”
if you want to have someone over or something,” Dean says. “You don’t have to lie about it to me. This is your home, too.”
The wait for the bus is the worst—Dean admits that even as a full human he’s dreading the cold as the wind pierces through their layers of clothes, not cold enough for all the precipitation to be snow but cold enough that there’s a bit of snow in the mix. Cas looks like he’s about to give up on his personal learning-about-humanity mission of his if it means not having to stand in the freezing rain-snow for ten minutes. With Cas’s naturally higher body temperature, Dean swears he sees few water droplets sizzle off of his face. He thinks maybe Cas should get a scarf, to cover up his bare cheeks against the cold.
He stands in front of a mirror in the bathroom, still clutching onto the only outfit he owns. Without his clothes on, he almost doesn’t recognize himself. He’s forlorn and foreign under critical eyes, and he wants to jump out of his skin. He quickly puts on his suit, his blue tie, his trench coat. He sighs in relief when the clothes settle neatly against his too naked skin.
Too small? “Stretch what?” he asks only for the sake of saying something at this point, though he regrets the words the instant they’re out.
“I remember when you first discovered it. Folk tale is true, by the way. You learned it from the goats.”
He’s thinking about which colour would suit Cas best when they arrive at the store. Dean would rather go straight to the hot chocolate aisle, but Cas’s face light up as soon as they walk into the store. Go figures; this place is like a field trip for him.
“Okay. Sam’s found me and him a case, so I’m gonna go ahead with that. But, uh…” Dean smiles sheepishly. “What do you say we grab lunch later, huh? That café you thought I’d like, with the apple pie crepes.”
Poking out from between the many books in the shelves is a document file. Its edges are crinkled, almost as if someone hastily shoved it in there in fear of it being found. Castiel checks behind him to make sure Dean or Sam hasn’t come into the room, and opens it with a shaky breath.
“I could ask you the same thing,” Sam replies, and he hands Castiel a cup of coffee that smells divine to Castiel’s tired body. Castiel gratefully takes it, latches onto it like a life-line, and takes a sip with a content sigh. “Are you working on something?”
just to spare him all the trouble, but he’s really not sure if a blind eye is what Cas needs, or something else. Maybe nobody’s told him that there’s nothing wrong with feather kink, hey.
And before Dean can say anything else, the man is gone with only the sound of the doorbell left behind.
Hannah cocks her head to the side with a frown. She touches the center of her chest. “Caroline’s felt something similar for her husband, I think.”
“Oh, c’mon.” Sam nudges him with his foot, and Castiel frowns down at Sam’s leg. Sam shoots him a grin. “I know this is important, but it’s good to let your brain rest for a while. Maybe this sort of thing is exactly what you need to get it going again.”
“Well.” Dean’s eyes flicker up and down, and his lips quirk up into a smile. “It doesn’t matter. He was wrong, so.”
Dean looks at Castiel, and then looks into the sky. The sun’s almost completely gone, the night chill quickly settling in. They still keep each other warm. “I got caught once, you know.”
Dean can’t help but let out a content sigh. The otherwise frosty living room soon thaws, and Dean loosens his grip on the blanket he was clutching at.
He registers a low murmur that’s Sam’s voice, and a bloom of conversation that follows after. There’s a small tingling in his chest as he walks towards the scene, as familiar as the kitchen he finds. It’s empty. He frowns. He thought he heard—
Castiel stares at Sam, so much taller than how he remembers him. He towers over him easily. He’s human now. He can only see as far as his eyes allow him. “It’s a nice day outside,” he offers.
“Yeah, I could smell your stink from my room,” Dean quips. Castiel sends him an unappreciative glare, Dean clears his throat, and it’s almost back to the way they used to be. “How’re you feeling?”
Just to show him just how invested he is in this, and because he did genuinely enjoy it, Dean checks his watch, and says, “Wanna hit the next episode?”
Dean shakes himself out of that train of thought. He’s gotta get going with the rest of the day. “Anyway, catch ya later, smellyass.”
Cas would probably like anything he gives him. Probably. He likes having things that are his own, to really call it
Dean’s reply is instantaneous. “Yeah, man, ‘course. I should’ve known better—I mean, I’m just glad you’re not hurt—”
There’s an uncomfortable tension in the air now, and one that Dean’s obviously not attuned to since he has no idea what the fuck they’re
He carefully removes the blanket that he’s managed to wrap around himself, caging him into the bed. His toes curl up against the cold floor, and he almost dives right back into his warm bed. His heart won’t calm down. Whatever it is that woke him up, he wants to know.
Winter stopped emotionally investing in living things that could die after that, and waited for something else to come along. Even if they were an eternal being, making snowflakes all day for thousands of years got old eventually.
“Yeah. Hey, Cas?” There are splinters of the bunker in Dean’s arms. “What’d you dream about, anyway?”
Dean’s not sure what to say to that, probably because he’s only ever been raised as a human. He fumbles around with how to properly respond, but Cas is thankfully not done talking.
Castiel stares at the door the cupid walked out of. He registers the bartender laughing about something the man said. They look happy. He wonders just how much of that can be truly called theirs now.
Later that night, Dean sees a spider weaving a web in the corner of his apartment, and usually he’d just squish them, but sue him, he’s grown a soft spot for them all, so he lets it climb onto a piece of paper and frees it outside.
It’s good that he waited until after Cas is done pouring hot water into his mug, because he’s staring at him like Dean just asked him to marry him.
(Sure, he probably could’ve asked Cas about his exact reason for doing it, but he didn’t want to come across as an insensitive jerk after being a dick)
Dean is smiling fondly at him, and Castiel hesitates to ask about what’s been on his mind ever since he saw Dean. Right now, it feels like a good moment to bring it up. “Dean.”
“But it isn’t here,” Castiel continues, his voice strong and steady in the tune of his heart. “And it isn’t with you.”
Dean takes a second to try to figure out if that was a joke or not. He decides to address the more pressing matter at hand. “How have you
He suddenly feels so weary, like he’s been running for forever. There’s so many unspoken rules about the ebbs and flows of human emotions, and everything seems to weigh him down at once. It’s overwhelming. It’s unbearable. He wants to sink into Dean’s touch, climb into his smiles and live there forever, and tell him. He wants to tell him.
There are only a few creatures that can conjure up such a huge world based on his wishes. He thought the case had involved a hybrid. “How many times have you rebuilt this world?” Castiel asks.
“When we talked before, when I asked you if you saw,” Cas says slowly, carefully, his voice firmer with each word, “we
desperate for Cas’s attention. He’s a grown-ass man with grown-ass responsibilities and having one friend not pay attention to him for one week shouldn’t get to him like this so much. “What’s up?”
Cas blinks back from the TV, his eyes eerily unfocused even as he stares in Dean’s general direction. He shrugs, and takes another sip.
“I’ve been coming and going for a little while until… you know.” He doesn’t want to know. “Until everything ends.” He doesn’t want to care. “Can I come in?”
Castiel walks her back to the war room, where the rest of the angels are waiting for Hannah before they head back out to their headquarters. She doesn’t say anything on their way back, but she speaks up at the last moment before she leaves. “You already made your choice long ago, haven't you?”
He blinks up at the ceiling to concentrate on what might have woken him, but he doesn’t see or hear anything in the otherwise silent bunker. It’s still dark.
Thank god. Thank god it was just Cas being his socially awkward self and not Dean having crossed a line. “Well, hey, offer’s still on the table if you want.”
Dean clenches his jaw. “Does it matter? I’ve given you everything you asked for, every single time. Why do you obsess over things that mean so
Cas is always into… different stuff, unexpected stuff compared to other people, but Dean’s gotta admit, he’s hooked. Apparently ants bury their dead, and hey, who knew? Definitely not him.
Dean nods wordlessly and kisses Cas more fervently, speaking their desperation with it, and Cas reciprocates with equal eagerness.
Spring cocked their head thoughtfully. Even personifications of a concept had thoughts, sometimes. “How about ‘Castiel’?”
Dean’s brain betrays him and his thoughts immediately jump from that realization to Cas, sitting right across from him and looking ready to burn his textbook to the ground.
Halloween is actually on a Saturday this year, which means midterms until the Friday if profs are nice, and midterms on the following Monday if profs are dicks. Thankfully, the former is the case for everyone he knows (except himself, who has a midterm
Dean pats his shoulders reassuringly, and beams at him. “Whatever you want, Cas. Anything to make you happy.”
“Um.” Cas blinks rapidly. His tongue quickly pokes out to lick his lips. “No. Just.” He coughs. “You don’t understand what you’re offering to do.”
There’s a buzz in his ears, and it’s like someone’s stuffed him full of cotton. There’s a sort of numbness that Castiel can’t repel, but he tries to smile so it would match the one Dean now wears. He tries to accept the confidence behind every word Dean speaks.
To be exact, it was still colder compared to the current times when all the temperature on Earth was averaged out, but it was hotter at some places than others. And anyway, nobody complained about the hotness of Earth since it was expected and mostly everyone agreed that it was a good temperature to be at. It was like this for a long, long time until one small meteor came to visit Earth.
So he just… doesn’t open any of them. He’s not sure he trusts Balthazar enough to drink anything he’s made, anyway. When Dean tells Cas this, he laughs and says that if he had to pick one thing to trust Balthazar for, it would be his brewing skills.
Dean squints and observes Cas’s sudden change in behaviour but he can’t find any of the demeanour from before. Dean shrugs. “Okay.”
“I won’t let you sit here and think that this is all your fault somehow.” Castiel itches to pull Dean in towards him, but he doesn’t. “Dean, it isn’t.”
onto him. There’s—no end to his wings as a separate thing. They just. Stop being his wings and starts being his back.
“Alright,” Dean says with a grin and gives him one last reassuring pat on the shoulder. “Anyway, I got a morning class tomorrow so I’m hitting the hay. Great party, man.”
He listens to the quietness of the bunker and focuses on his heart as it calms back down into a steady rhythm. He takes another deep breath with his back arching and slumps back onto the bed with a sigh.
Castiel wants to say yes. It’s a knee-jerk reaction, to want such a thing. Of course he wants to stay.
Dean rubbed his cheek with a sigh only to remember the grease on his hands and grimaced at the tart sticky pull on his face. He had half a mind to joke ‘now look what you’ve done’ but he didn’t say that. He shrugged. Under the buzz of the brightly lit garage lights, there were no secrets he could hide. “It’s just what I’m used to, I guess.”
“What?” Dean looks at where Castiel points to, and shrugs. “Sure. You probably didn’t notice before.”
“Balthazar, please,” Cas replies sharply, and Dean raises an eyebrow at the name. Definitely another relative, then. “I appreciate your thought, but I don’t—”
Dean blinks with a smile. “You’re selling?” he repeats. “Dude, if you’re selling anything from here, don’t let Sam find out.”
It’s still a Thursday night and everyone present at the party occasionally try to be responsible students so they all take off around eleven after helping Dean and Cas clean the place up, leaving Dean with many, many hugs. When he locks up and turns away from the door, Cas is standing there in front of him holding a pizza box with leftover pizza and a smile, his wings draped behind him all loose and relaxed.
Dean radiates warmth, and Castiel’s breath hitches at the way he feels Dean’s breath on his lips. His stomach tightens, and he’s so dizzy he’s glad Dean’s holding onto him. There’s almost a challenge in Dean’s eyes, a question, as if Castiel would deny what Dean is offering him.
fault that Castiel chose to be with the people he loves. Castiel would joke that yes, he supposes it technically is, since Dean’s the one who is so wonderful and so incredible that Castiel ended up loving him so very much, but he can’t quite bring himself to say so while looking at the utterly stricken look of guilt clouding Dean’s beautiful face.
Sam blinks. “Do you even hear yourself? We’re saying this isn’t your fault. You couldn’t have possibly known what Metatron was planning.”
Dean sighs, and stalks towards him. Realizing what he’s trying to do, Castiel rips away from the touch, away from Dean’s embrace. The warmth leaves him as quickly as it arrived. “Dean,
He tugs at the tie a bit. He doesn’t remember how loose he used to have it, but he thinks it feels tighter. Castiel heads out the door, loosening the tie around his neck.
Castiel rolls his eyes, and Dean restates, “It’s okay. You know I dig it,” with a wink and a grin. He doesn’t see the rush of heat that runs through Castiel’s chest, and he pretends to be annoyed with him instead, focusing back on the sigils.
Muriel sits at the foot of his bed, and studies him. “I didn’t believe it when I first saw you, you know,” she says carefully. Everyone has been so very careful with him lately, and Castiel wants to kick her out and shut the door against the rest of the world again. “To think that one of our kind was captured by a djinn of all things, and was… inconvenienced by it.”
Sort of weird how Dean knew for sure that his gesture wouldn’t have gone unappreciated, that they’ll always be welcomed. Cas isn’t even wholly human, but how many people in his life can he say that about?
Pleased, Cas smiles. Maybe Dean imagines it, but the heat radiating from Cas becomes a little more intense for a second before it flares back down into a steady source of warmth.
Sometime later in the future, Castiel comes home one night and smells a very familiar smell. He slings his backpack off his shoulders and walks to the kitchen to find Dean nibbling on a piece of pulled pork out of his crock pot.
“Good nap?” Dean asks, looking up from his phone. Cas nods, still somewhat out of it, and joins him on the couch. The heat from his body radiates towards Dean soon enough, and it’s such a perfect amount of toasty that Dean’s about to break out the marshmallows and the graham crackers. Dude’s like a walking heater.
This in itself is frustrating. He doesn’t want to fight with Dean. Why is it that every time Castiel wants to care about someone, it becomes like… this?
Dean kisses him, and Castiel responds with his own, and to love and be loved in return, to be so sure of something so good is incredible. They stay like that for a while, just until Castiel is a bit more calm, just until the cramp Dean gets in his arm from Castiel leaning against him is gone, just until they need to go back to dealing with responsibilities.
There’s another woman in the kitchen, and Castiel glances back between her and Charlie with a smile. “And you, too. I—”
“Well.” She looks around, for who he doesn’t know. “We just… figured that you’d be coming back with us after this. Back to Heaven. That’s why you’re doing this, isn’t it?”
While Summer takes a very brief temporary break away from Northern Hemisphere, Cas turns proper attention back to Dean. “Where were we?” Cas says, but Dean stops them.
“Isn’t there anything you want?” Dean continues. His Adam’s apple bobs slightly as he talks in a low voice, drawing Castiel’s eyes to it. “There’s got to be
Dean sort of… kneads his fingers into Cas’s wings by moving up against the feathers like Cas told him to, until he reaches between Cas’s shoulder blades and gently presses a few times. Cas groans into the touch and yep, okay, he must’ve done something right. Dean grows more confident as he kneads back down each wing, doing his best to not hurt Cas’s joints by mistake and Cas’s feathers become more lax.
Dean and Sam sit down in their respective seats, and Castiel hesitates on where he should be for far too long. Dean notices, because he must notice, and pats the seat beside him to direct him. Castiel is glad for it.
Cas’s face goes through a roulette of emotions that briefly settles on what feels like anger, then into a scowl. His wings are tightly wound against him as are his shoulders, but he doesn’t say anything else. His wings flutter restlessly once in a while in the otherwise silence. He’s a little scary like this.
They walk the rest of the way back, mostly with Dean filling Cas in on everything he knows about Marvel and DC. It’s almost two by the time they’re home, and Halloween is officially over as they retire to their rooms. Dean is changing into his pajamas trying not to think too much about how he did on his midterms when there’s a knock on the door.
“Consider all you want,” Bobby says, “but we gotta get this ball rolling sooner than later. This ain’t no laughing matter.”
Dean turns away from Castiel, and leaves the kitchen to take the rest of the call. Dean’s cup of coffee still sits in front of Castiel, steam rising from the white mug. Castiel taps his own mug in his hand and takes a sip of his coffee again, only to wince at the sudden foreign taste. A taste that must’ve been present this whole time, but something he hadn’t noticed until now. He looks down at the swirling black liquid in his cup. Nothing’s changed, but there’s no mistaking the faint metallic taste at the back of his throat. It wasn’t Dean that he’d told about the coffee berries before. It was—
Dean, for one, doesn’t seem to know where to exactly look as soon as their eyes meet. While Dean is fumbling, Sam leans against the table, blocking whatever papers they were looking at. “Hey, Cas. What’re you doing up?”
Cas moves on with his pizza box to the kitchen to put their leftovers away and Dean stands in place, his heart beating unusually fast after that tidbit. There’s still a sort of anticipation in the air that leaves a small tickle inside Dean’s chest.
Dean nudges his shoulder, and Castiel looks away. He blinks. “Hey,” Dean says quietly. “Ready to go back?”
grow a mullet in the future—that’s really up to you.” More snickering from where Dean sits. Castiel glares—half from not understanding why they’re all laughing at him and half because
He finds himself wandering over on youtube to find his own resources to devour on inbetween the work reports he’s gotta write, and he ends up watching insect-related videos until three in the morning, sucked into interesting facts about different types of insects he didn’t even know existed until now. He grabs a shoddy phone photo of a velvet worm on his computer screen, since that guy’s got its little feet around Dean’s heart since the movie night, and sends it to Cas with the caption “
“Uh.” Dean rubs his forehead. Nothing in his life has ever prepared him for this. “What happened to your…”
Castiel slips out of the lull of sleep, and into consciousness. He can hear Sam outside in the hallway, closing the door behind him to go on his morning jog. There are no windows here, but he knows that it must be a crisp, sunny day today. He can feel the slight chill in the air, and it’s pleasant against his warm skin where the rest of his body is buried underneath their blanket.
And when Spring arrived, Winter fell in love completely and unequivocally. Spring was beautiful, with fresh greens and gentle rainfalls and flower buds that swayed in the cool afternoon breeze, ready to burst with honey. Spring arrived gently but firmly, quietly but brilliantly, ready to wake everyone up from their deep slumber.
“Um, okay, I’m gonna, just, yeah, go,” Dean says, and holds up his dinner like a shield between them as he walks out of the kitchen before Cas stops him again.
And that’s a good thing. That’s a healthy good thing that Cas has got going on. He’s just not sure why he feels so shitty about it.
Castiel shakes his head again. He can’t lead them into what’s sure to be their deaths—not again. “You’re better off without me.”
He doesn’t. He doesn’t know what he expected out of this case, but it’s not this anticlimactic ending where he feels even more lost than when he began.
“That’s a human name,” said Spring one year. They were sweeping through the South Pole to arrive at the North Pole, with Dean ahead and Spring following suit as usual.
“For you to lead them back to Heaven. They want no part in this war, either. They just want to go back home.”
Dean pats down the disappointment. It would’ve been nice to have Cas with him on his birthday. “How much time do you need?”
Misunderstanding his lack of reply as not recognizing what Dean’s talking about, he continues, “It said that you—” Dean huffs, unable to meet Castiel’s eyes like he usually does. “And hey, I get it. But if you couldn’t stand me to the point of—changing me entirely—you should’ve said so from the get-go.”
He’s whistling no particular tune with his shitty cup of coffee sitting on top of his car, and he’s about to get in and drive away when he notices, from the corner of his eyes, someone watching him.
Castiel stares at the door. He doesn’t know how long he stays like that, but eventually, he curls back into his bed and sleeps.
Dean knew it was Cas that was walking towards him while he himself was under the Impala, giving her a good ol’ tune up. Dude really had to get better looking shoes than those fugly expensive pair of Blundstones.
Dean sets down a bun with some sort of shredded pork that’s been seasoned with red sauce and topped with cheese. “Dig in while it’s hot,” he says.
Cas gave him another Look and this time, Dean couldn’t help but laugh. “Yeah, alright. Whatever, dude. I was a fool.”
Sam murmurs a good night, but Castiel is too busy staring at the plates of pizza laid out on the table. It’s hard to believe they were having a peaceful dinner just a few minutes ago.
“What? Uh, no. I also live here. I’m the one who posted the ad.” Dean points at the other room facing the one they’re currently  in. He eyes Castiel and licks his lips. “Is that a… problem?”
The man—the harpy, probably—sighs with a shrug. “Can’t believe I’m being treated like this,” he says woefully. “I traveled thousands of miles lugging these heavy things to share some of my best brew with you, and yet—”
“But I was… I was so sure,” Castiel says faintly. He frowns down at his hands. It’s only been a few days, but it feels like it’s been forever. He can’t remember any details about the case, no matter how hard he tries. “It couldn’t have been a mistake.”
“Um.” It’s with a prickle of guilt that he recalls a vague conversation of someone telling him about that in the past. How could he have forgotten about Dean’s return? “No, of course not.”
He almost wants to ask what Cas exactly takes him for—some skeevy roommate that goes around telling everyone about private things like that—but bites his tongue. Dude’s probably still embarrassed that Dean walked in on him like that, and he supposes it’s not exactly something you’d share to the rest of the class, no matter how much you actually trust them as a person. Well, it’s none of Dean’s business, anyway.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says. The smile on his face falters a little, but it doesn’t disappear completely. “You busy?”
Jo joins them after work as Charlie’s promised and soon enough everyone’s piled up in the living room being warmed to their very core. Charlie dozes off a few times and Jo pokes her awake just long enough to have her finish her essay. Dean makes quesadillas and passes plates of it around, smacking Jo’s hand away from grabbing the plate near her.
He’s useless, in his dreams and in reality. He hasn’t learned. For years he thought he could fix it all if he just did something right, and all he’s done is cause more harm. There must be hundreds, no, thousands of others like her out there because of him.
“I don’t…” need to shower either, Castiel almost says, but even he smells the rank that he’s built up over the past few days, wafting just under his nose. “Good idea.”
At the lack of an answer, Dean looks down with a sigh, and looks back up with firm eyes. Dean reaches out, and squeezes Castiel’s hands. “Listen, Cas,” he says. “You’d be the most useful for me if you’re happy. Okay?”
—” Dean flails towards Cas’s direction, “—is what you meant? I thought you were talking in some weird metaphor—”
Castiel shoots him a levelled look, and Dean coughs out a laugh. “Yeah, okay. Pot calling the kettle black, et cetera. But seriously.” Dean nudges him with his shoulder. “You think I’m not terrified of the same shit?”
loud and clear. “Uh, okay.” Dean glances over Cas’s shoulder onto his desk. His notes are laid out but the cap on his pen is still on. “Keeping busy?”
“Oh, you can…” Dean clears his throat. “That’s pretty cool. I mean, I guess that makes sense since I never really
Castiel finds that he can’t really answer. He doesn’t know if it’s morning or night right now. “What do you want?” he repeats.
“Yeah, but…” Dean swallows the strange lump that’s formed around his throat during Cas’s little pow-wow. “Alright, fine. Just… don’t share any overtly specific details, I guess.”
Castiel bristles in his seat, because he’s right. Dean sniffles, and rubs his cheek while he thinks about what to say. Castiel waits.
it’s harpy stuff. It’s always harpy stuff whenever Cas acts weird. Instead, he thinks about the group project. If Cas wasn’t at a group project, where was he?
“To help, yeah. I know. Drop the bullshit act,” Dean snaps, and Castiel blinks in surprise. “That’s the farthest thing you want.”
He manages to find the time to stop by the dollar store and scout for deco. None of the blatantly corny looking shit, but still authentic enough that Dean’s willing to put it in their house. It’s not much; just some Halloween stickers that goes on the windows, those pumpkin necklaces that light up he figures they can hang on things, spider webs and little plastic spiders, and one bigger spider doll.
The rest of the weekend goes by relatively event-free and Charlie and Jo are more than happy to go back to their house after their heater is fixed. Though the apartment feels much bigger after those two leave even though they only stayed for two nights, Dean’s also secretly a little bit relieved to have his and Cas’s space back. He especially feels worse when, as soon as Charlie and Jo walk out the front door, Cas lets out a mile long groan and his wings shudder out full-force, twitchy from having been crammed in without an opportunity to stretch them.
Castiel feels exhaustion cloaking him then, and he follows Dean’s lead, wondering if he’s imagined the abrupt ending of that conversation. He watches Dean for anything that seems out of place, but Dean is only happy to show Castiel which room he should use and making sure Castiel is comfortable before he retires to his own room for the night.
doesn’t know anything about the dynamic between him and Cas. They’re not like that. They’re friends. They’re roommates. Dean is Cas’s Jiminy Cricket, if he had to put it roughly. Nobody talks about Pinocchio hitting it up with the cricket, though, do they? Same difference, and there’s nothing more or less to it.
Dean frowns because yeah, he’s sure. He remembers seeing the course title and number written on Cas’s binder with a sharpie and everything. “Huh.”
, and Cas looks so—far away, that Dean just reaches out, and grabs his hands, and squeezes. Cas’s eyes fly to Dean, and Dean tries on a reassuring smile. Hey, he ain’t going nowhere just yet.
The easy atmosphere around the table suddenly grows stale, and the laughter dies down as Charlie realizes the gravity of what she said in front of Castiel. Her eyes dart between him and the Winchesters, and shrinks a little. Dean plays with the label on his beer bottle, and Charlie takes a bite out of her pizza for something to do. Eileen has an eyebrow raised, but doesn’t comment further.
The previous owner sure had some good taste and Dean recognized a number of songs. He picked whatever first song he was familiar with, which happened to be
He remembers the choking feeling of isolation. The pressure to be extra careful, from the way he talked, to his choice of words, to how he completely refrained from physical contact with people who weren’t girls throughout the rest of high school, just in case people found out one day and the false accusations landed at him.
the Castiel I heard so much about!” Charlie smiles wide and big, and her short red hair adds to the effect of her flame-like enthusiasm. “It’s so nice to finally meet you!”
He knows that. Dean was the one to teach him it all those years ago, again and again. And it was through these years that he’s also learned that there are right and wrong choices, and Castiel has never been the one to make the right ones. Not when it mattered.
Castiel looks at Sam’s computer screen again, and back to Dean. He’s lightheaded like he just stepped out of a shower even though he’s nowhere near the washroom, the warm orange lights of the bunker that welcomed him now intrusive and blinding. “No.”
Cas raises his eyebrows, stares down at the plate of brownies on the coffee table that Dean’s baked earlier today, and back up at Dean.
He lands them just outside of the bunker. He could’ve delivered them inside, but he wants to feel sunlight against his skin before they go back in.
“Great.” Sam regards Castiel, and his pile of documents, and hums. “You wanna join me? Take a break from all this?”
big of a deal for Cas to look so pleased that Dean remembered that Cas doesn’t like eating chicken (“Is it like… borderline cannibalism for you guys?” “Not so much cannibalism as it feels… wrong for me to eat. Would you ever eat a monkey?”). His face is warm as he hands him his plate and he still doesn’t cool back down when he’s sitting in his spot with his own plate.
faded away. For all he’d done for it, Dean hoped that the universe was ready to grant him one more thing. “Hey, Cas?”
Dean nudges his shoulder, and Castiel blinks up at him. When did Dean stand up? “Hey,” Dean says quietly. “Ready to go back?”
He hears a group of whispering voices to his right, far away enough that he can’t make out any words, but close enough that he recognizes some of the voices.
And then, it’s gone. Dean deflates as all the fight bleeds out of him, and he deflates and deflates until his shoulders sag and the fire in his eyes dulls, and disappointment sours in Castiel’s stomach.
Cas stares at him with his bright blue eyes and his widened smile. Their knees are still touching from when Dean bumped them together.
It’s so easy to fall into bed with Dean, and so easy to lie there and watch Dean as they breathe together. Castiel is almost afraid to reach out and touch the side of Dean’s eyes that crinkle when he smiles softly like he’s doing right now, afraid that this is just another dream that’s been improved from his previous ones, but he knows it can’t be a dream when Dean kisses him again and again, so gently like Dean can’t believe this either and he’s checking to make sure every second they’re apart. Castiel’s eyes flutter shut, and he sighs into them, his heart so full that he’s overwhelmed and the only way to express it is to kiss Dean again. Dean takes it gladly, and it’s so much, it’s so
Few days later, Dean comes home earlier than usual. His last class for the day is cancelled for reasons he can’t remember now, and Dean’s a happy guy since that means he can show Cas how to bake peanut butter chocolate chucks cookies the Winchester way earlier than he’d promised to.
“Jo says she’ll head here as soon as she’s done work,” Charlie says. “God, do you know how nice it is to feel my toes again?”
“But I’ll give him his old job back after a few years, I think,” she says thoughtfully one night, when they’re discussing what to do with Bartholomew and Malachi.
Dean lets out a small chuckle that has Castiel look back at him. “I hear you. What’re you studying?”
Castiel studies the freckles peppered across Dean’s face that are visible by the bar’s low lighting, and he knows that it’s the same now. He glances away from Dean’s lips, and focuses back on his bottle of beer.
“—and Jack won. So when he died and was refused by heaven for his sinful life, Satan gave him a coal burning with hellfire, and Jack carved out a turnip to keep it lit. He wanders with his lantern ever since.”
“I know,” Cas replies methodically. “Valentine’s day, also called Saint Valentine’s day or Feast of the Saint Valentine.”
And what little hope he had left sinks down to the soles of his feet, so much that he could stomp them out completely right there and then. “It’s cool. What are you doing anyway?”
“Me too.” Cas beams, standing there with his cup of coffee in hand, his hair still ruffled from unconsciously running his hands through it while he looked over his notes. Dean wants to reach over and flick at the strands that are standing up. “Thank you, Dean.”
Castiel is tired. He wants to go back to watching How It’s Made videos—they’ve been effective at tuning out… everything. He doesn’t want to stand here in the only place he has left, being scrutinized by another he’s hurt and being reminded of his mistakes. He just wants everything to go back to the way it was.
“Yeah, sure man. Let me know if you ever want another massage,” he says to Cas’s retreating back, who gives him a thumbs up without turning back and goes straight to his room.
Cas nods. “Group project,” he says, and the epic eyeroll speaks for itself well enough that Dean doesn’t think to be suspicious about it.
Cas turns the TV off, and Dean cooks them a late dinner. Cas helps with the dishes after, and Dean heat themselves two cups of hot chocolate to sip at.
Normally, Dean would be more careful. Normally. He doesn’t know exactly what compels him to go up to the man and confront him with a, “Hey.”
Cas smiles, which is just about the hardest thing for Dean to endure right now. “I won’t have these out, of course,” he says, his wings fluttering a little. “But this is nice.”
And suddenly, the illusion is lost, and Castiel is projected back to the reality of the situation. Here he is avoiding his responsibilities when he should be out there working to get things right. He sits up straighter, humbled by the line of thought.
Balthazar, Rachel, Hester. Samandriel. Anna. Countless others who were killed during the war against Raphael. Some names that he hasn’t spoken out loud in years.
A faint outline of a mangled halo surrounds her. He remembers her. “You don’t get to have this,” she spits. Everything around them stops. He remembers her. “You will repent for your sins.”
“I’ve never been to a party,” Cas mumbles. “I never had the occasion, and I wouldn’t know what to do.”
But for some reason, Cas was just as persistent to see this argument to the end this time around. “Dean, you don’t need to hold yourself back on every thing you want.”
Dean’s eyes flicker over him for something to pinpoint. Maybe something to prove him wrong. When he doesn’t find anything, he lets go with a breath, and fixes his eyes back on the road.
Dean leans against the doorframe with his arms crossed, and inclines his head. He looks at Castiel with hooded eyes. “Do you want me to stay for the night?”
Castiel looks down at his hands, undoubtedly holding the white plastic bag. He doesn’t need to look inside to identify the dark red mass in it. He looks up and sees Naomi in the distance, her eyes filled with tears of regret as she begs for him to reconsider.
“I should really figure everything out before I do,” Castiel says, even if his heart is already set on the decision. He
“Not that I’m saying otherwise,” Cas interjects, “but if we’re not going by harpy customs, and we’re apparently not going by human customs according to you, then what are we going by?”
Castiel closes his eyes. He’s not sure if he’s ready to talk about it, but he’s not sure if he’ll ever be ready. If it gives Dean any consolation, it may as well be now.
In a way, Dean was sure it didn’t even matter if the jukebox was gone or not. Well, maybe it did, but Dean felt… light. Like he could achieve anything he put his mind to. It was the most free he’d felt in years and the whole drive over to the store, Dean only hoped to god that he wasn’t too late in making this choice.
