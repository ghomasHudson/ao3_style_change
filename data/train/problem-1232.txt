“Your medical records.” Sherlock replied seemingly distracted, though he was keeping half an eye on his friend as he skimmed the pages.
Trigger Warning: Descriptions of gore/blood.
Liquid morphine was only available outside the traditional clinical settings for palliative care, to ease pain at the end of life. Cancer nurses carried it to administer it as needed, however carers and family members were often taught how to medicate the patients due to a lack of resources to fully cover the demand. John used this information to surmise that he’d been kidnapped by someone who had cared for the terminally ill recently, either professionally or personally.
“Are they still alive? Your parents?” Sherlock asked finally, snapping John out of his thoughts.
“John, are you dressed yet?” Sherlock knocked on John’s door lightly, not getting an answer and not really expecting to. The doctor would have had no choice but to put on the Steed suit as his other one was currently hidden under the seat cushions of the couch. Being forced into a corner like this would have put John in a foul mood so Sherlock was planning to fuss over him until he cheered up.
“I don’t need to blog the cases, as you said, I write them up for my own pleasure and that’s enough, that’s fine. It’s all fine. Fine.” The doctor’s voice was becoming quieter and quieter and he folded in on himself as he spoke, putting pressure on his still very tender ribs and torso. John heard a rustle of cloth and suddenly there were gentle hands on his shoulders, coaxing him to uncurl and lay back.
Ever since being forcibly confronted with his friend’s mortality twice in the same day, Sherlock had been a bit overprotective, or completely suffocating if John was asked for his opinion on the matter. It was heart-warming really, if a little annoying at times. It was nice to know that someone cared but it had been two weeks now, John hoped his flatmate would calm down and stop mothering him soon.
was the only person allowed to drug John.
“Thank you, Sally, I appreciate it.” The ex-soldier replied sincerely as he stood back up and took his kit from her. “Right, where’s the body?” The Detective Sergeant led the way with a smile and John found himself grateful they’d managed to get past the initially god-awful tension and awkwardness the first few times their paths crossed at crime scenes after Sherlock’s name was cleared.
“It’s actually a relief to see that you’re still such a terrible liar.” Sherlock was right behind him, close enough to prevent John from escaping across the kitchen and through the sliding doors into the living room. “I suppose it shouldn’t be surprising that you’ve developed such mental techniques to compensate for that fact... Talk to me, John, tell me what happened.”
“…I don’t believe you.” John’s reply made Mycroft frown in affront. “Don’t be offended, we both know that you can and have lied to my face before. It makes it a little hard to take your words at face value. Thanks for the lift.” The doctor unclipped his seatbelt and opened the door.
“There wasn’t any shock, it was like my brain went ‘Oh right, ok then.’ I sent Harry a text, put my phone in my pocket and started walking to Tesco’s again when it hit me.” Despite the bandages, John gripped his mug tightly with both hands as he turned his face away from his friend, he was flushed.
The pair of them arrived first at the block of flats where they decided to split up, Greg went inside the building to try and gain entry from the front while Sherlock went around the back and up the fire escape. The detective ran up to the third floor, thanking his lucky stars when he saw a half opened window. He quietly pulled it out fully and climbed in to the flat.
John was reading the news on his phone while sitting on a bench in Regents Park. He would have much preferred to be doing this inside where it was warmer but he was waiting out a certain annoying Consulting Detective. Today was the tailor’s appointment that Sherlock had refused to cancel and that John had refused to attend.
“Explain.” Never had so much been said in so little words. Sherlock took a deep breath, knowing that whatever he said next was likely to be decisive in whether John ever forgave him. Sherlock clasped his hands behind his back to centre himself as he paced slowly at a respectful distance from the doctor.
“Yes, we were hoping you could help us with some information?” Lestrade pulled out his notebook and opened it. “You said that the deceased was an instructor here? What exactly did he do?”
“It’s not pathetic to have a conscience, you’re a good lad who has been through a lot. Think about your brother now then, Morgan! He wouldn’t want you to do this! If you kill yourself then who will protect him?” Greg’s body was tightly wound, ready to spring forwards, given even half a chance.
Behind him and to the left, was Doctor John Watson in formal clothes but standing at parade rest, with a tearfully happy Mrs Hudson holding tightly on to his right arm. Sherlock smiled to himself, it was so good to see them again, even just on screen.
“Did you know Madison Teller well?” The doctor asked as he fell into step besides the businessman, he’d been visibly shocked when they had broken the news to him but not much else.
“Fair enough. I’ll go back to examining it’s molecular structure so I can identify it if I come across it at a crime scene.” Sherlock took the tub and headed for his microscope in the kitchen. “Not often I have experiments I can eat after.” John smiled to himself as he listened to the detective’s musings, grabbing the paper to read.
“Yes, I thought so.” Sherlock didn’t want to loom over his friend so he sank to the floor in front of him, crossing his legs and resting his hands on his knees. He willed his fingers to stop twitching with the urge to remove the gun from John’s grasp.
6.	Possibility of unrequited feelings.
The room was currently in use by a class who were learning defence techniques. The cadets were paired up and sparring with one another while an officer walked through the room, correcting some and praising others. There was an atmosphere of camaraderie, the scent of sweat and the sounds of skin hitting skin mixed in with playful banter.
“Don’t worry, it’s not loaded.” The doctor had spotted him and tilted the gun to show that the slot for the magazine was empty, the detective let out a breath of relief.
A little later and the pair of them were in a small treatment room, John had his jumper and shirt off and the doctor was drawing a grid on his back before she started to apply the different allergens. As Sherlock’s eyes fell on to his friend’s scarred left shoulder, he recalled the first time that John had let him see and examine it.
The next afternoon, Sherlock was in the kitchen doing an experiment when his phone buzzed with a message from John, his flatmate had been called in by the Met for Medical Examiner duties. As the body was of an elderly lady in a care home, the likelihood of it being anything interesting was virtually nil so the detective had opted to stay behind rather than tag along.
“Morning, what’s that you’ve got there?” The doctor asked as he retrieved two clean cups and set the water on to boil.
“How are you feeling right now?” The detective asked as he untied the rubber tubing, watching as John flexed his hand experimentally to restore blood flow, test how it felt and his range of motion. He gave an incredulous little laugh at the question.
“Si vis amari, ama.” Sherlock eventually replied softly, “Love if you want to be loved. It’s Latin. You should find someone you are willing to do that for first, the rest will surely follow.” The detective gave Sally a small reassuring smile, which she returned for a brief second before Greg announced that the photographers were finally done.
The doctor sat him down on a stool in the kitchen and excused himself to get the first aid kit and his phone. Sherlock thanked him profusely, the act dropping as soon as he was alone. He began combing the room, looking for anything that would confirm that Chen was their serial killer.
John didn’t dare turn around, he just stared at the wood in front of his nose, painfully aware of the sound of his own breathing as he tried not to panic.
“Hello there, I’m Dr Fennel.” An older woman with a full head of silver hair walked into the room and closed the door behind her, she was carrying a clipboard and checked it before speaking again. “I have a Sherlock Holmes down as Dr Watson’s next of kin, is that one of you gentleman?” The detective was so surprised at discovering John had put his name down as his emergency contact that he forgot how to speak and just raised a hand instead.
“Even better, you can make something like this for me as an apology when you next destroy something of mine.” The doctor had already made a decent dent in the food on his plate, pleased to see that Sherlock had an appetite too for once. “Wish you’d have warned me beforehand, I’d have made more of an effort to not look like…” He waved a vague hand towards himself, searching for the correct phrase.
“Oh really, John? Then please tell me one of these great many secrets you’ve managed to keep from a man of my obvious intelligence and observational skills.” Sherlock replied in a prickly tone that made John hang his head with a sigh, before he spotted something out the corner of his eye and an idea came to him.
:: Magnesium silicate. Ascorbic acid. Potassium bitartrate. – SH ::
“O-oh, I see. Apologies.” The detective cleared his throat and looked away from Lestrade. “It
“Yeah, that’s not going to happen.” John said shortly before looking back over his shoulder, “Thanks for the escorts today, Greg, call me when you next have a day off and we’ll go for a pint. Mrs Hudson, I’m probably going to have a nap now so don’t disturb me unless something’s on fire or someone’s dy…”
Sherlock sighed as he checked the last room in the unlet office building. This one was a bust too, evidence of their smugglers using it was nowhere to be found, not even for storage from the looks of it. He hoped John was having better luck in the building he was checking, they needed to find which of the structures that the gang was using as their base of operations and soon.
Greg Lestrade kicked in the door of the address that John had sent him earlier, realising only after the fact that it had been left unlocked. He had a couple of uniformed officers with him and they swept the house, looking for the cellar. They found a man tied up on the floor of the basement. They sniggered when they saw the improvised headgear. Lestrade got the man into handcuffs and pulled him to his feet, starting to read him his rights.
“Who knew? Mycroft, presumably, but was anyone else in on it?” John asked him, managing to get the words out around the lump in his throat. There was a paradoxical wave of understanding that passed over the doctor’s face at realising that the elder Holmes wasn’t as cold and unfeeling as he’d thought, the lack of visible grief making sense finally.
“No! NO! She’s crashing! Bring me the cart! Now!” The doctor cried out as he began CPR, doing chest compressions while a nurse performed rescue breaths after each cycle. Another nurse charged the paddles of the defibrillator, shouting a warning before shocking the woman. “No response, continue CPR and charge again.” John stated as he resumed chest compressions. Two more shocks and he shook his head reluctantly.
“It’s some sort of wire, there’s flecks of metal in her neck where it cut into the skin. The killer used what was to hand, shoelaces to bind her to the chair after he overpowered her and her own scarf to silence her. My money is on a coat hanger, a wire coat hanger.” Sherlock had been looking at Ms Barratt’s neck with his pocket magnifier before turning his attention to her right forearm. “There’s more Braille here, care to translate it for us, John?”
“Ok, ok, I’ll stay back. Don’t do anything rash, Mr Bartley, Callahan is not worth killing yourself over.” He glanced to his right when Greg came into his peripheral vision. “We know what he did to you, Morgan, to you and who knows how many other young men like you. You’ve brought his crimes out into the light.”
Since then, Donovan hadn’t said a single word about Sherlock and John Watson managed to slot into place alongside the officers of The Metropolitan Police. His skills and professionalism plus his affable nature were such that he was now known as the ‘Doc’ or simply ‘Doc’. Greg had told John over a pint that a nickname pretty much meant he was officially one of their own.
It was another hour and a half before John Watson arrived back at 221 Baker Street. He was starving but he had barely anything in his flat so it looked like he was ordering in tonight.
Mycroft Holmes was sitting in his offices at the Diogenes Club, the hour was very late but his door was opened without warning and he gave the intruder an exasperated look.
“That’s absolutely fantastic, John! I’ll make sure you don’t regret it, I promise you! Oh, this is going to be great, I’ve missed having you around so much! We need to make up for lost time! Le-” Sherlock’s brain was firing wildly with plans now he had his companion back.
“None of the staff could remember who came to meet this guy, didn’t hear anything unusual and CCTV isn’t good for business in a place like this.” Greg scratched the back of his neck in puzzlement as Sherlock moved to the head of the bed, John walked around the other side. The detective took out his pocket magnifier as he leaned down to examine the man’s face
“Not as well as Arnold seeing as he was under my direct supervision and she was in PR. I’m saddened by what’s happened but I wouldn’t have put my relationship with Madison any higher than work acquaintances.” Mr Manning answered as they finally got to his office. He let the three of them in and locked the door behind them.
“Are you hurt anywhere else?” Sherlock asked softly as he traced the edges of the injury with gentle fingers. John slipped off his jacket wordlessly and rolled up his left sleeve to show another smaller bruise on his elbow. “You could have broken your leg… or your neck.”
“That was an impressive explosion, thank heavens for your good reflexes. Compared to that, my ex-partner definitely overreacted.”
As Sherlock came back to the present, he was pleased to notice that the scar tissue had lost its lurid red/purple shading for the most part in the few years since that conversation. It would never fade completely, of course, but John became less self-conscious of it as time passed.
. The former soldier gasped and let go of his flatmate like he’d been burnt. There was a tense moment where neither of them dared to breathe.
“I will trust you. I’m not sure why, all things considered it seems like a terrible idea. But I will, you brilliant git. You’d better make sure to keep this promise.” John’s stance finally relaxed so Sherlock let go of him. “We should also text each other the address we are investigating when we separate on cases, when we arrive and when we leave.”
“Unimportant! Don’t worry about it, though we should order in if we want something for dinner tonight. Thai?” He asked, pulling out his phone already to dial as John gave him an agreeing nod.
“Ravenous, actually. That smells amazing, I had no idea that you could cook.” John pulled out a chair and sat down, normally if anyone was making a meal it was John. He wasn’t a natural chef, but the army had taught him enough to make a few really filling dishes, he rotated through them and practice had perfected his execution.
“It wasn’t really your idea, John. Don’t blame yourself, that’s exactly how they operate.” Sherlock’s tone was pleading with him. The doctor turned around finally; the detective hadn’t moved from where he’d left him and there was an almost agonised look on his face.
“I thought you were dead… you hit the ground
“The man who killed Callahan committed suicide right in front of me.” Sherlock finally said as he picked up the cup, his grey eyes were fixated on John’s face. The doctor had been the subject of the detective’s intense focus before but this was something different, an apprehensive anticipation gripped him.
The three of them walked off the hospital grounds where a black sedan was waiting. It felt ridiculous to be taking a car for a journey that only took twenty minutes on foot but these weren’t normal circumstances. Sherlock saw his friend and brother into the car safely and John sank into the soft leather seat, closing his eyes.
It looked like Sherlock had assumed
“Come on, let me wrap that up for you so you can eat it at home.” John grabbed Sherlock’s sandwich and folded a couple of serviettes around it while the detective settled the bill. The pair of them jumped in a cab back to Baker Street, heading up into their flat. “So, do you want me to look through the papers to see if there’s anything interesting or do you want the afternoon off now?”
“You alright over there?” There was a smirk in Sherlock’s voice that told John that the detective knew exactly what he was doing. He felt a flush of embarrassment and humiliation creeping up his face and a surge of anger made him straighten his spine on instinct.
“Now my client, Dr Watson, wishes to address you all.” There was a quiet muttering of those present which told Sherlock that John speaking directly to the press was a rare occurrence.
“Don’t read me like that, Sherlock, that’s not fair! But I know there’s no use in lying to you, so yeah, I’ve wanted you for longer than I care to admit. I never intended to tell you, I know how strongly you feel about sentiment and I didn’t want to ruin what we already have.” John picked up his glass and gulped it down in one to soothe his drying mouth, dearly wishing that it
“I’m so sorry, I just heard, are you ok?” John blurted out, able to use his natural empathy to his advantage. The woman blinked at him confused, the doctor couldn’t help noticing that she was an attractive woman. She had long auburn hair, curves in the right places and an air of independence and self assurance. She reminded him of Sarah actually, his former colleague.
“Even without Callahan’s murder, something would have happened to bring this out, another grooming case perhaps, it was just a matter of time… you know how I know?” Sherlock spoke in a soft and soothing tone. John started to tremble harder, he clenched his hands into fists as he shook his head. “Because someone recently told me that even if you can put your emotions aside, you have to make time for them when the coast is clear.” John let out a watery surprised laugh followed by a hiccough at having his own words used against him.
They left the hotel, Sherlock texting Molly about the case with a list of questions for her when she performed the autopsy. Greg brought his car around, the detective getting in the front passenger seat. He played with his phone for a moment before sending a message to John.
“Across the street, denim jacket and green rucksack, that’s our guy!” The doctor hissed in a whisper, trying not to alert Falcon that they were on to him. However, it seemed their thief was hyperaware with nervous energy. He locked eyes with the detective when he glanced over, taking off down an alley with both of them on his heels. John pulled his phone out and called Mycroft on the run.
“Thanks, Phil, if I wasn’t awake before then I am now.” John blinked the last few tears away and took in the room properly for the first time. The living room look like a tip exploded. Empty vodka bottles, beer cans, pizza boxes and cigarette butts littered the room. Whatever colour the carpet used to be, it was now a mottled brown with stains and threadbare patches.
:: Yes, thanks for asking. I’m sorry I ducked out so quickly. – JW ::
Sherlock thought as he heard the front door open and sat up, straightening out the rumples in his suit jacket. When John came down the stairs wearing the dark blue uniform of an emergency A&E doctor, he jumped slightly when he spotted his visitor but he recovered quickly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m sorry but I don’t, however I’ve not been stationed here for very long. When a class graduates then there usually is a group photo on the day of their passing out parade, if this man is a former trainee then he might be in one of those pictures.” The Major stood up from his desk, pushing his chair back. “If you both follow me, I’ll show you where we hang those photos for posterity.” The three of them left the office and walked a short way to a large assembly hall.
“Thank you for agreeing to see me at this difficult time.” Sherlock sat down in a chair by the couch, taking in the man’s appearance.
“I suppose the final question that remains for me to answer is this…” Sherlock’s grey eyes stole over to his closed bedroom door as he voiced his thoughts out loud, a small smile coming to his lips. “Is the fear of rejection a good enough reason not to even try?”
He pushed one hand into the curls at the back of the detective’s neck, the other gripping his bicep to steady himself. Once Sherlock had got over his initial surprise, he returned the kiss, deepening it as he wrapped his arms low around the doctor’s waist. John let a little sigh of pleasure escape at feeling Sherlock’s tongue slide against his own, he felt like the very air around them should be crackling with the raw energy between them.
“Oh please, John, I was able to tell The Woman’s measurements at a glance, and I’ve been so much more up close and personal with
John was jolted out of his thoughts by the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs. He watched in silence as his door opened to reveal Sherlock holding on to the Steed garment bag. At spotting the doctor’s rather heated scowl, Sherlock wisely said nothing, hanging it from the hook on the back of the door before retreating back to the relative safety of the kitchen.
“I packed up a bag with everything I’d need and bought the knife on the way, hiding it up my sleeve. I went into that hotel room, played my part until I had Harvey where I wanted him and stabbed him. But once I’d started, I couldn’t stop… even though I knew he was already dead, it was like a dam had burst inside me. I just wanted to rip him apart with my bare hands. I… I frightened myself.” Bartley sniffled before shaking his head with an angry growl, frustrated with his reactions.
If I was one to title my chapters, this one would be called 'How To Woo Your Watson.'
:: Likely. Now how do we prove it? Meet you at the top of the cliffs. – SH ::
“Thank you for the helpful information, let’s go to his place, John. I should be able to work out where he’ll try fencing it next if I see his flat.” Sherlock turned up his collar and was about to leave when the man called to them again.
:: Sorry. I had a bad allergic reaction earlier and he got a little rattled, but I’m ok now. – JW ::
John looked after him for a second before noticing Sherlock taking advantage of the lack of police supervision. He leaned into the locker and sniffed at the coat hanger before approaching the body, kneeling down to sniff Ms Barrett’s wrists. The detective had a contemplative look on his face as he quickly checked something on his phone.
“Euphemisms? Ah, well, when they want to talk about something sensitive, I guess?” The DI got up from the floor too, still holding the laptop. “Like sex, a lot of people use metaphors when they are out in public because it’s more polite and you don’t know who is listening.”
“Bullshit…” John’s curse surprised both the brothers, making them look down at him in shock but the former soldier met their gazes steadily. “I’ve never heard anything so idiotic in my whole life and I’ve heard plenty of stupid things. I am a man who cares, cares a lot if we’re all honest here. Yet in a crisis situation like last night, I am able to work effectively and efficiently. I can push my body past its limits, going without food, water and rest far longer than under normal circumstances. Wouldn’t you agree?”
“Don’t say sorry to him, you’ll only make him even more smug and insufferable. It’s not like he has any feelings you can hurt.” Sherlock grumbled as he took a sip of his drink and grimaced, he hadn’t put enough sugar in it, opting to dunk a custard creme in it instead.
“Speaking of my unusual skill set, I sometimes wonder if I’m in balance.” John broke the quiet with what he’d been musing on, at seeing the detective’s questioning look, he elaborated. “Whether I’ve saved more lives than I’ve taken or vice versa.”
“Do we have to? I’ve only just got the splint off from the last time we spoke.” John looked at the detective expectantly, but at getting no response, he sighed heavily. “Fine. Just let me put these away and get a shower, I’ve got eight hours of hospital ick on me. Make a cup of tea if you want to be helpful.” The doctor walked into the kitchen and quickly unpacked his bags before heading into his room to grab a change of clothes before going into the bathroom.
“Korea was next, both North and South. That was a fraught time, trying to stay unnoticed by both the cells and the government at the same time was nerve wracking. I don’t think I got a decent night’s sleep for a month and a half. Thankfully it didn’t take long to unpick that one so I travelled into China next.” The detective waved his free hand in illustration while John was beginning to understand the sheer scale of work needed to accomplish this mission, it was a relentless and unforgiving time.
“Ok, I am willing to concede that there are some professions where empathy has its place in strengthening an individual’s will to do better… but I still stand by my original point, the simple fact of one person caring for another is not enough to save lives.” The older brother looked positively aggrieved at the fact he’d had to give some ground on this debate.
“This shop is a lot smaller than Allatel’s galas, you go speak to Alice and ask her if there’s a certain donor that does a lot for the RNIB and is passionate about the cause. I’m going to get in contact with some suppliers of pancuronium bromide, see if there’s been some unusual activity lately.”
“You’re right! Well done! This was taken four years ago, so if we look at the records for that year we should end up with a name. Hey, lad, could you take us back to the Major?” Greg turned to their escort who nodded politely and led the two of them away.
The apartment smelt like cigarette smoke and cheap alcohol, he crept through the kitchen quietly. The bedroom door was ajar and through it he saw a black haired man sitting on the end of the bed. He was holding something in his hand and Sherlock could hear the sound of quiet sobbing.
“Shut your god damn mouth, Sherlock!” John’s tone demanded compliance, a relic of his army days. John stood up and glared at Sherlock. “You have no business being angry with me for struggling to cope. You can get mad at Moriarty for trying to destroy you or yourself for leaving me behind but don’t you dare shout at me for grieving hard… that was my ‘role’ remember?” The doctor snatched the bottle of pills from Sherlock, intending to put them in his bag so he could get them recycled safely the next time he went to work at the hospital.
“You’re right. I can’t force myself to feel something I don’t and it’s not as if I don’t have a reason for being the way I am, I shouldn’t berate myself for it.” The doctor gave Sherlock a small smile which was returned with a larger one. “I’m sorry about the shopping and the glass.” Sherlock waved him off with a dismissive hand.
When John awoke next, he knew he was in the hospital before he even opened his eyes. He could smell the ammonia and there was a rhythmic beeping of a heart monitor nearby. The doctor finally prised his eyes open and took in his surroundings. He was surprised to see he was in a private room rather than on a ward. Across from him, there were three figures seated in a line, giving him their undivided attention. Evidently, they had been waiting for him to regain consciousness.
“Define strenuous.” Sherlock asked as he immediately pulled John into his side with an arm around his shoulders, pressing a kiss to the skin behind John’s ear. “Because I’m not intending to let a minor foot injury get in the way of my plans for you today.”
John couldn’t speak anymore due to his tongue swelling so he pulled his phone out of his pocket and pressed it into Sherlock’s hands. The detective stood up and called for an ambulance, managing to explain the situation to the operator even though his voice betrayed his alarm.
It hadn’t been long after that that the detective had had to admit his feelings to himself, if no one else. He loved John Watson, his best friend, colleague, flatmate and blogger. However, the little experience he had had of relationships from his student days had made him believe that it wasn’t worth acting on his attraction. It became nothing more than a background fact in his life, like that he played the violin very well or despised idiotic people.
“Much better! Come here and take a look at yourself.” Sherlock grabbed John and pulled him to his side and turned him towards the mirror. “Loosen up, you’re ruining the look of the suit with your shoulders all bunched up like that!” The detective stood behind his lover and rubbed his neck and shoulders to try and relax him.
“John, I’m not going to leave you again, you have to believe me.” The detective stared at his blogger with an earnest gaze, wishing he knew how to erase the doubts from his friend’s mind. He watched as the doctor gave him a small watery smile, letting go of his arms.
“Why didn’t you tell me that you were allergic to coconuts?!” He hissed accusingly as John opened the bag and dug through it, finding an auto-injector of epinephrine. He uncapped it and pressed it into the meat of his thigh and held it there for several seconds. The ex-soldier’s breathing was becoming more laboured and Sherlock got down on his knees in front of the chair. “What do I do? Tell me what to do!”
Everyone had an opinion, of course. Mrs Hudson just said that John would come around in his own time. Lestrade told him to be persistent, sincere and not to emotionally manipulate John. Molly suggested that he should try and see it from John’s point of view. Mycroft had offered to engineer some life-or-death peril in order to force the ex-soldier to realise that Sherlock being back was more important than hurt pride.
“Thank you for the lift, Captain.” Sherlock practically purred when the kiss broke. “I might have to fall down hills more often if it means I have an excuse to be carried by my incredibly strong army doctor again.” He felt the vibration of John’s chuckle from where he was nuzzling at his throat.
“I wanted to see if your coconut allergy had been spotted before and you’d just forgotten about it and also whether you had any others. No on both counts.” The detective answered as the kettle popped. John headed back to it and prepared the tea, bringing the mugs into the living room and sitting on his chair. “I have spotted something that’s quite intriguing though, apart from routine vaccinations there’s no entries for you during your childhood up until your mid-teens.”
“What makes you think I’m being anything other than entirely sincere right now?” There was confusion and a little hurt in Sherlock’s voice. It was enough to make the doctor feel instantly guilty but he resisted the urge to turn and face his flatmate, not until he knew what Sherlock’s game was; an experiment? Something for a case? A misguided attempt at pulling a prank?
“Yes, your insistence that you’d seen Wolverine’s skeleton in one of the storage freezers did make Lestrade’s taking of your witness statement quite amusing.” Sherlock glanced pointedly at the laptop next to his friend on the bed. “You could type up and blog some of our latest cases if you’re that bored, should pass the time.”
“So, there was an ulterior motive behind the dinner after all? You’re a devious man, Sherlock, I’ll need to be careful that you don’t lead me astray.” The doctor had no idea why he came out with that blatantly suggestive comment, it’s not as if there was actual alcohol in his drink that he could blame. Part of him was intrigued with his friend’s playfulness and wanted to see how far they would take this. However, the atmosphere broke when Sherlock snorted with laughter.
John jogged out of the supermarket and jumped into a waiting taxi sitting in the rank and gave the driver the address that had been sent to him. John settled himself back in his seat and looked out the window as the streets of London passed by. He rubbed the back of his neck and stretched out his bad shoulder to try and remove some of the ache. The former soldier was often tired and sore nowadays with his two jobs, but he didn’t mind really, he preferred to be busy and felt useful again.
John was eating breakfast at the kitchen table when Sherlock emerged from his bedroom. The detective picked up the fresh cup of tea that the doctor had made for him and took a long inhale.
“Mr Price, one of the things that the coroner will be trying to determine is whether or not Ms Walters’ fall was an accident or not. Seeing as you’ve known her for so long, can you tell me if she ever appeared depressed, anxious or even just unusually pensive?”
He closed the kit and left the bathroom to put it back in his rucksack, but Sherlock followed him.
It had taken a few days of hacking/lurking around the right areas of the internet but it had paid off. There was a shipment of human organs hitting the docks in three days’ time, listed on the manifest as imported Parma ham. The cargo would be packed on to a small refrigerated truck, and according to their information, brought to this industrial estate to be dissipated quickly to the backstreet clinics for individual buyers. The time between arrival and departure would be less than ninety minutes.
Mr Holmes the younger didn’t quite fill out the suit the way he used to. Mycroft knew that home comforts like a good meal and warm bed were often missing from Sherlock’s recent life, never mind the finer things like music, relaxation and conversation. Still, the job was done very well and his little brother was finally back on British soil.
The doctor grit his teeth as his head span, swallowing a wave of nausea. He’d been drugged with something that rapidly rendered him unconscious. From his symptoms he figured it was probably an opiate of some sort. The fact he was injected didn’t guarantee the drug was in liquid form as it could have been tablets crushed in saline but it was more likely than not. That narrowed down the options to heroin, cocaine and morphine. John’s guess was the latter, simply because of the lack of a racing heartbeat he’d have expected from the other two.
“Don’t be silly, John, you can use the one upstairs now!” Mrs Hudson told him as though it was the most logical thing in the world. The former soldier froze momentarily and his eyes darted to Sherlock before returning to her.
Sherlock walked into the bedroom of Madison Teller, a 38 year old public relations executive for a large telecoms firm. The body had been found by her husband when he returned home from a three day semi-professional golf tournament being held in Birmingham. According to Lestrade, cause of death wasn’t immediately apparent, both eyes had been removed and there were some strange markings on her left forearm made with an unknown tool. So, he’d called in the world’s only consulting detective and his assistant.
2.	Caring is not an advantage; it hinders clear thinking.
“Is there any particular reason that you’ve decided to make fun of me?” John kept his eyes forward and his voice even, the light touches on his shoulder stilled instantly but Sherlock didn’t withdraw his arm or move to widen the space between them.
“The basement flat? But that was riddled with damp, John’s shoulder always hurts more in the cold. It was clearly a terrible idea, why didn’t you stop him, Mycroft? I asked you to look after him for me.” He fixed his older brother with a glare that only deepened when he received a chuckle in response.
According to his LinkedIn profile, Dr Li Jie Chen was a veritable pillar of the community, a second generation migrant. Twenty five years of experience at the cutting edge of modern surgery under some of the biggest names in the medical world. Self-evidently not blind but the activity on his profile indicated a dedication to causes that support and help the blind.
“Mr Price is without doubt her lover and was the father of her child. After speaking with him, I can believe that he did love Holly. She could have been pressing him to admit the affair and he killed her in a moment of madness.” Sherlock mused before he drew away, growling sharply because John had dabbed his face with antiseptic. “Careful! That stings!”
Just as Sherlock tried to creep closer unnoticed, Lestrade started pounding on the door, making Bartley look up sharply. He spotted the intruder and scrambled backwards on the bed until he was up against the wall.
“Can you get what you suspect set this off in a clean plastic bag for me? Then wash your hands thoroughly, face as well if you’ve been eating it too.” The detective jumped to his feet to do as he was told.
“Friends don’t make friends feel stupid, humiliated or useless or used or alone. I could forgive you anything, and I often did, but that doesn’t mean it didn’t still sting.” John wrapped his arms around his torso, wincing when his hand throbbed as he hugged himself tightly.
“Yes, he knew. Molly also assisted with a suitable corpse and the death certificate.”
“I wasn’t flirting, I was distracting her, like you asked me to.” John picked up a small tube to apply a thin layer of cream over the graze. “But keep pushing, see where it gets you.” Despite the increasing heat in his words, his hands remained gentle.
“Hello there, I’m here to speak to Jonathan Price, it’s regarding the death of an employee of his, Holly Walters?” Ever since the failed bluff with Dr Chen, Sherlock was much more careful about possibly introducing an alias until he had some idea whether he’d been recognised or not.
“That’s good then, looks like they’ve strapped me up well so my rib should heal without causing another puncture if I take it easy.” John looked down at his chest under the papery hospital gown to see his torso covered with thick bandages and medical tape. He looked up at his flatmate’s face again and braced himself. “Go on then, let me have it before you burst something.”
“Dr Watson! I could use a hand here.” A nurse called for him, she was with a man who had a dislocated elbow among other injuries. “Mr Coulter has had a sedative already; we just need to put the elbow back in now.” John nodded and gently took the patient by the wrist.
“You’re the first person to offer a helping hand to anyone, you forgive everything and always give people the benefit of the doubt, no matter what. But you never give yourself the credit you rightly deserve, and I can tell from the look on your face that you genuinely don’t see how wonderful you are. I’m making it my personal mission to point this out to you as often as I can until you believe it and then carry on doing so anyway.” Sherlock gently stroked a loose strand of hair out of John’s face, before cupping his cheek and using his thumb to caress it affectionately.
The detective nearly groaned out loud, messy love entanglements like this were tedious at best, but seeing as they were already investigating, they might as well see it through.
“Not even password protected. He clearly never lets anyone come into this flat, otherwise he’d have some sort of security in place.” Sherlock commented as Greg opened and closed the wardrobe, not finding anything interesting in there. It was mostly fatigues, formal dress uniforms and some casual clothes. “Harvey Callahan’s web bookmarks, we’ll start with the top one. He’s a member of ACAS – the Aged Cheese Appreciation Society. He logs on every day and spends a lot of time on their forums, so it seems.”
“No, actually. Maybe the killer took it with them to destroy it?” Greg replied as an officer knocked on the door and handed over some papers to the Inspector. “Got Callahan’s address here and some background information. Looks like he was a 2nd Lieutenant now, rather than Lieutenant.” Sherlock’s head popped up instantly from the other side of the bed.
“I know you are capable of looking after yourself but if you get fed up with them then text Mycroft the names and he’ll sort out a restraining order or something. He has his lawyers on the lookout for any libellous statements about us and is seeing to their retraction if they find anything.” Sherlock never much cared what people said about him, not then and not now, but he wouldn’t have anyone smearing John’s good name.
There was no way his parents could afford to send him to university so he worked hard to earn a full scholarship to study medicine at St Barts. It came with a bursary for living expenses but it didn’t cover much more than rent, so again, he worked part time around his studies but his marks suffered for it. That’s when he saw an advertisement by the British Army, they offered him a generous stipend to complete his degree as long as he enlisted with them for a minimum of six years.
“I wouldn’t run anywhere in this; I’m hardly daring to breathe right now. And most people can’t tell the difference between one fabric and another by sight alone. I know I can’t.” John turned and shrugged helplessly in the face of Sherlock’s stunned and slightly disgruntled expression. “If I wear this to the dinner, I’m going to be as stiff as a board and your parents will think I’m an idiot because I’ll be too uncomfortable to be myself.”
Feeling calmer, if not completely removed from the situation, he grabbed his phone and called for an ambulance. He put the operator on speakerphone and described John’s injuries to her, moving to hold his head completely steady. John began to come around, groaning in pain and trying to sit up.
“I came up with a plan. I texted Harvey, turns out he hadn’t changed his phone number, arrogant bastard. I told him I missed him, that I wanted to see him again, laid out in explicit detail exactly what I wanted him to do to me. He was wary to start with but eventually his lust won out and he agreed to meet me.” Morgan’s lip curled up in disdain, it seemed he’d picked up a thing or two about how to manipulate someone from Callahan, then used that skill against him.
“Some people are just too sensitive these days.” Sherlock replied dryly as John’s phone rang again, he sighed deeply and answered it this time.
“Tell me, has anyone
Sherlock frowned at that thought, that couldn’t be right. He didn’t realise Chen would recognise him until he saw that newspaper, so there was no way John could have known this trip was anymore risky than any other time they’ve split up on a case.
“His lips are swollen, interesting... John, wha-” Sherlock glanced over and stopped short. His friend and colleague had gone as white as a sheet, a sheen of sweat breaking out over his forehead. “John, you’ve ceased breathing. What on Earth is wrong?” The doctor snapped out of his trance and reeled backwards away from the bed until he hit the wall.
Discussion of Past Suicidal Ideation.
“There was a large connection between Moriarty’s network and the former Yugoslav states. I’m sure you noticed that theme during the bomb debacle. I got set up in Bosnia initially and started nosing around carefully. There were at least three cells in this area and we wanted to take them all down without alerting the others. The first two went smoothly. The third… did not.” Sherlock’s body language started to close off and his eyes darkened.
“Moriarty slipped up, and for a moment I thought I wouldn’t have to fall back on my plan. He could call off the snipers, I would have done whatever was necessary to force him to make that order. So, he killed himself, knowing I had to do the same to save you.” The detective looked up at that point, John was trembling from head to foot, digging his fingertips into his upper arms so hard that he was going to leave bruises.
had John?
“Why are
“I suppose there’s no way to really change an ingrained view of the value of money, but tell me, is there
“It’s likely the accident itself wasn’t fatal though she was probably knocked unconscious. Judging from the puddle of vomit the body is lying face down in, Ms Alcorn was sick at some point and either choked on or aspirated the liquid making asphyxiation the preliminary cause of death.” John got the temperature probe out of his kit.
John took the cosy off the teapot and poured himself a cup, deciding to drink it black because he needed the caffeine. He was on call again for the Met today starting at nine and he needed to stay sharp.
“Why didn’t you just kill Arnold Teller and the shop girl, Alice? Why go for Madison and Ms Barrett, Dr Chen?” The detective knew that vigilante types loved the chance to expound on the righteousness of their cause and Chen was no different.
“Sometimes the accent and slang come out if I’ve had a bit too much to drink. No one could understand me when I came down to study medicine at Barts so I worked hard to lose my accent. Speaking clearly can mean the difference between life and death sometimes as a doctor, and as a soldier too actually now that I think about it.” John was blushing a little at all the attention he was getting, he glanced to Sherlock and caught his eyes to try and assess his partner’s mood.
“Yes, yes it has. I still think what you did to me, Mrs Hudson and Greg was wrong but I accept that you thought the ends justified the means. I don’t agree, but that’s ok, friends can disagree on things and still be friends. Or if it needs spelling out any clearer, I don’t need to agree with you to forgive you.” John had barely finished speaking before Sherlock had grabbed him by both shoulders, squeezing them tightly with joy and relief.
“Christ, Sherlock, are you ever gonna learn not to go after suspects on your own?” John grumbled as he knelt down and untied his friend before shuffling on his knees so he could check the detective’s head wound. “Damn good job I followed you, got to Chen’s place in time to see him putting you in his car. Tracked him to here then called in Greg to help me. He manned the lights and the tannoy to cover me sneaking up.” The Inspector had just joined them and was currently reading the suspect his rights, giving the detective a cheeky salute.
“What about Lestrade? He was bound to get a lot of heat for allowing me to help on all those cases. You promised to do what you could for him.” The slight twitch of Sherlock’s eyebrow was a tell of his, betraying his anxiety. Greg Lestrade had been very good to him, even when Sherlock just showered him with constant abuse.
Then the next steps were to isolate the target socially, making them dependant on the abuser. Some showered their victims with gifts to build up the feeling that they were owed something. Others created an environment similar to a siege mentality, fostering a feeling of Us vs. Them to turn the groomed against concerned family members and friends.
“Uh, sorry about that. I don’t kn- um, I mean… it’s nothing, forget it.” John cleared his throat, averting his gaze for a moment before forcing his face back into a neutral expression and looking to the detective again. “Anyway, carry on. What did Callahan do?” Sherlock placed his tea back down on the table in a deliberate manner and steepled his fingers.
“Then clearly you’ve never been suicidal before.” There was a gasp from Sherlock but John missed the look on his face because he had flopped on to his back so he could stare up at the morning sky. “You have my therapy records, Mycroft, would you like to tell the class who I put down as my next of kin when I registered with Ella after I was first discharged?”
“Does the fact you’re here mean there was more to that gas explosion than meets the eye?” As he addressed Mycroft, the doctor’s voice cracked. It was raw from speaking so much for hours on end. John opened the bottle and took a long swig.
“Fat chance. That first six months when I was suspended was the worst of my life, nothing to do except think about what I would have done differently and wondering if it would have led to another outcome… and I knew that you must have had it ten times harder than I did. I just wish I could have been there for you more.” As a condition of his suspension and his provisional reinstatement, Lestrade had been forbidden from contacting John directly. John put a hand on the DI’s shoulder and gave it a squeeze as they left the hospital.
Sherlock scowled out the passenger window as the obvious conclusion came to him.
“Bit not good, Sherlock.” His friend huffed and muttered under his breath. The paramedics arrived and started working on John, but Sherlock kept his position up by the doctor’s head while they hooked him up to a heart monitor, oximeter and put an IV in.
“Had a good nap?” The detective’s baritone snapped John out of his stunned trance. “Hope you’re hungry, have a seat, this only needs a minute more.” Sherlock turned back to the hob, using a pair of cooking tongs to move the meat, noodles and vegetables around, flicking his wrist to toss it about.
the reason you refuse to blog cases?” The detective normally jumped down the throat of anyone who stated the obvious like that.
“I’m sorry, I honestly thought it was just a broken rib, which I’ve had many times before. I didn’t want to worry you and get you worked up about something that would heal up on its own without needing any specific treatment.” John at least had the decency to look contrite, he knew collapsing and passing out in the middle of the street would have panicked all concerned.
“On a serious note, mate, don’t lie if you get hurt, it’s not worth it. Glad you’re alright and I’ll see you soon!” Lestrade gave them all a warm smile and a wave before leaving the room, still giggling away to himself. Mycroft stood up from his chair, pocketing his Blackberry and retrieving his umbrella from the seat next to him.
“It’s an official photograph, he’d have to be formal. I have no doubt there’s others from that day where he’s grinning like a maniac and causing havoc.” Sherlock commented as he passed the magnifier over the face of his friend, the tan he associated with the army doctor had yet to materialise and there was a lack of frown lines on his forehead.
“I’d say that it’s highly likely that Callahan knew his killer. They’d arranged to meet here for a sexual liaison; the victim books the room under an assumed name. Let’s the killer in, they start kissing and caressing each other judging by his lips and the fact that Harvey’s shirt is undone. They get on the bed, the killer on top which is when they pulled out the knife and carried out the attack. Have you found his phone anywhere?” Sherlock got down to his knees carefully and looked under the bed for any evidence.
“Not really. Lucky shot though, he threw a box of tissues at me first, I’d just ducked that and he punched me.” Sherlock was sulking, he didn’t like being bested at anything.
“Right, it’s not far to the cabin from here, thankfully. We’ll ice that ankle down as soon as we get in.” John sounded a little out of breath once they got back to the path. He used his right arm to grab Sherlock’s left wrist and held it against the detective’s knee. This way he only needed one hand to keep a grip on to his charge, the other free in case of emergencies.
“Venus… then Earth, Ma- AH!” Mr Coulter cried out in pain but his elbow was back in the socket and he wouldn’t remember this once the medication wore off. John smiled as the nurse gave him a grateful pat on his forearm, about to say something when a patient with a severe head injury started fitting in another bay, pulling his attention away again.
“That doesn’t take us much farther than we were yesterday really, nothing of note came up in the stomach contents and Callahan was remarkably healthy for a man in his early fifties.” Sherlock put his phone back in his pocket as they drove up to the gates of Sandhurst. The Detective Inspector showed his badge to the guard and explained that they were expected for a meeting with Major Deakins.
“Are you trying to insult me? Softness, along with caring and sentiment have never been things that you’ve held in high esteem.” Sherlock’s mind was clicking away, his older brother was always working to an agenda of some kind.
“I have a better idea. Care to join me?”
“Are you alright, John?” Sherlock asked worriedly as he came to his side.
The detective was a person who threw himself wholeheartedly into every aspect in his life and his relationship was no different. Now he knew what it was like to hold John in his arms while he slept, he wondered how on Earth he’d ever survived this long without it? The physical side of their new dynamics hadn’t progressed much past hugs and some pretty intense make out sessions, mostly because of John’s still mending body but also partly due to the fact there was no rush, they had the time to explore and learn each other.
“Well, either you were the absolute paragon of health…” Sherlock put the papers down and steepled his fingers together as he spoke. “…or more likely, you were never taken to the doctors, regardless of whether you were sick or not.” The detective could tell he’d got it right when John sank back into his chair with a deep sigh of resignation, sipping at his tea for a moment before he spoke again.
“JOHN!” That shout was followed by the sound of someone stampeding down the stairs like a herd of demonic cows. Sherlock swept into the sitting room with his eyes flashing wildly and absolutely livid, the dramatic effect not lessened any by the lack of his signature coat. He had something in his hand and he held it up for inspection. “What on Earth is this?!”
Nowadays John was generally a lot better at accepting help from his flatmate (and a select couple of others too) but it wasn’t always that way. In the first year of their association, he would stubbornly insist he could take care of anything and everything himself, even when the opposite was readily apparent.
Sherlock thought for a moment as he watched his friend nursing his cooling tea before continuing.
“Have the media been bothering you anymore?” Sherlock started lamely, watching as blue eyes flashed at him in warning, knowing that wasn’t the reason for this conversation. But the doctor answered it politely nonetheless.
“No, we write those to an overhead account. Everything that we get in goes to the charity. As you can see the only debits are from the bank account, cash and cheque deposits and the only credits are to the Profit & Loss.” Mr Manning lent forward and ran his finger down the screen.
“Yes, but don’t forget that we know that someone went into that hotel wearing one set of clothes and left wearing different ones. I recommend getting some CCTV footage of the busier streets in that area and watching for such a person around our time of death.” The detective replied as he gave the room one last look, to see if he’d missed anything.
At a loss of what else to do, Sherlock decided to check out the bathroom attached to the room. He stopped in the doorway as he took in the surroundings. The killer had obviously cleaned themself up before they left the crime scene. What was notable about this was the difference in atmosphere from the bedroom.
When Sherlock jumped and faked his death, he’d left John a sizeable inheritance but the doctor hadn’t wanted it. He tried to make Mycroft take it back and when he wouldn’t, John just opened another account and moved the money into it and refused to touch it, living off his locum wages and the small amount in savings that he had.
but his knee had healed and he was sleeping much better.
John found the front door and opened it up but as soon as he set one foot outside, he was grabbed and thrown up against the brickwork. A forearm was pressed hard against his throat, the cold muzzle of a gun against his temple and angry grey eyes staring at him.
what I was trying to show you!” The doctor deflated when he noted the continued lack of comprehension from the detective. “What I want from you, Sherlock, is for you to actually understand what you put me through and why it was wrong… and I’m scared that I’m asking for the impossible because you Just. Don’t. Get it.” John scrubbed at his face with his hand in frustration before he spoke again.
“…Yes, you did, you were always going on about how you’re ‘not gay’ whenever anyone implied that there was something more than platonic friendship between us.” The detective’s baritone held a note of curiosity, he’d evidently registered John’s odd behaviour but didn’t yet understand the reason for it.
“I’m going to have a hot shower and then put some of my lidocaine plasters on, you said you’d call work for me?” John asked his flatmate who nodded at him. “I’ll leave my phone with you, if Lestrade rings then tell him what happened with the idiot kidnapper so he can press charges.” The doctor walked into the bathroom before he realised he didn’t have any clothes to change into and he really didn’t want to go up another flight of stairs to his room.
“You may not know this, but I survived Afghanistan. I’ve been shot, beaten up, kidnapped, stabbed.” John’s voice jumped to another speaker, on the right and behind them now. “Got thrown in the Thames once too… I even survived my best friend’s suicide.” Sherlock flinched a little at that statement as John’s voice was routed from a speaker on the other side of the room.
“The pair of us both tried to get their attention in different ways. Harry went to extremes to try and provoke a reaction, bunking off school, shoplifting, drinking, drugs, you get the idea. When she came out, I initially thought she’d done it for the shock factor, not that it worked anyway. They accepted it without a problem, Harry actually looked disappointed rather than relieved.” John put his empty mug down and picked up his Union Jack pillow instead, needing to hold on to something.
“Mycroft.” If the civil servant was surprised at being addressed, he hid it well. It was probably the elder Holmes that had pulled some strings to get him a private room.
“You’ve called an ambulance?” Lestrade asked under his breath, Sherlock gave a curt nod. “John? John, can you tell me where it hurts? Can you feel your legs?” The former soldier was bleeding from the back of his head, plus his left knee was at a slightly unnatural angle and he had several cuts from the glass. Of course, that was only what could be seen on the surface.
.” The detective wiped the moisture from his eyes and glanced over his shoulder to see if anyone had noticed, however no one was paying any attention to them.
When Sherlock picked up the mobile, he was pleased to note it wasn’t one with a thumb print lock. It was a four digit-pin so he tried Holly’s date of birth, which was incorrect. A quick check on Facebook and he put in Mr Price’s but again, incorrect. Sherlock chewed on his lip before a final idea came to him, he checked her LinkedIn page to see when she first started working for Price and entered in that date. He smiled in satisfaction as the phone unlocked.
“How absurd! Why did you think I’d get worked up?” Sherlock retorted in the indignant tone he used whenever he felt someone was implying that he had feelings like everyone else whose surnames weren’t ‘Holmes’. Lestrade made a noise that sounded suspiciously like a snort of amusement but he covered it with a cough and hid his mouth behind his hand.
“Really? I would have thought that would be the natural inference from how ‘hands on’ I can be in various other parts of my life.” Sherlock spoke directly into John’s ear, purposefully lowering the pitch of his voice. “Now, doctor, I believe the correct treatment for an injury such as this is to alternate cold then warmth, so I’m sure you’ll agree that a hot bath is an excellent idea… Medically supervised, of course.” He felt justifiably smug when it took John two swallows before he could answer.
“John.” Lestrade answered as he drained the remainder of his drink before folding his arms across his chest, a move that signalled his sour mood.
“You remember you told me about times when it feels like you have a million different thoughts in your head all at once? You can’t think straight because it’s just too noisy in there?” His flatmate glanced up at the detective who nodded. “Well I feel like that too sometimes. When it’s too quiet outside my head and too loud inside it… I get overwhelmed.”
Throwing back the covers, John got up carefully, reaching for his robe and pulling it back on. As annoying as his lingering rib injuries were, he knew he was lucky that he was even walking just ten days after falling three storeys on to concrete, albeit with a crutch. He wasn’t religious by nature, not really, but he couldn’t help thinking that someone had been watching over him that day.
“I do indeed, fair is fair. We can go as soon as we’ve tracked down the tablet. I knew you played the clarinet but I had no idea about the flute.” Sherlock still had a small smile on his lips as he gave the broker a brief nod of acknowledgement as the pair of them left the shop.
Sherlock thought as he watched his brother out of the corner of his eye.
4.	John: Full of sentiment. Strong. Not defective in any way.
“We’re drafting a statement for them that we’ll release later and then they shouldn’t have any reason to hang around after that.” Sherlock waved his phone to indicate how he was conversing with his brother. John muttered something under his breath as he rubbed at his tender shoulder.
“Well it was very kind of you to say, but you know I don’t mind being in the background. I don’t do what I do for recognition, the press giving you all the credit doesn’t bother me in the slightest.” John scanned his eyes down the dishes and gave his order to the waitress when she arrived.
Trigger Warning: Descriptions of gore/blood.
“I’m going up to my room, any time you want to stop being childish and return my suit, then drop it in to me.” John grabbed his laptop and disappeared up the stairs. He sat on his bed and checked his watch; he’d need to grab a shower in a couple of hours if he wanted to be ready in time. It felt like he was playing a massive game of chicken with his lover and he was fully anticipating a mad rush to get ready when someone cracked at the last minute. He was determined that it wouldn’t be him.
Trigger Warnings: Reference to Mistreatment Whilst Captured.
“John? Are you alright?” Sherlock called through the open sliding doors that led to the kitchen. When John turned towards him, the detective gasped in shock and rushed over. “Your face, John! Your eyelids and lips are swelling up. Can you breathe ok? I think you are having an anaphylactic reaction to something; you need to sit down.”
John glanced around and saw a couple of dark fibres on the floor.
“Then why are you playing with your violin?” The doctor asked, at getting a questioning look from his lover, he elaborated. “Generally, you only poke at the strings like that when you’ve got something on your mind that doesn’t have anything to do with cases or The Work.” The detective smiled at that demonstration of John paying attention to his habits.
“If you’re hungry, John, then don’t let me stop you. I’ll just be here, searching for evidence.” Sherlock spoke in a condescending tone with a wave of his arm as he went back to looking around.
“Don’t move, yo- John? John! Thank God, it’s you!” Sherlock immediately let go of the stunned doctor as he hastily repocketed the firearm. “Your supervisor called me because you didn’t show up to work. I spoke to Mycroft and he checked the CCTV for me. He saw you being taken and tracked you to this house. I came to rescue you… but apparently you had it all in hand.” Those deducing eyes were combing all over his friend, telling the story of his brief captivity.
“Very impressive.” The detective spoke automatically, yet another thing he hadn’t known about his blogger.
Trigger Warnings:
A few days later found John sitting at the desk with his laptop, he was catching up on his emails and moderating the comments on the blog. He heard the front door close and Sherlock’s footsteps on the stairs, the detective had given him the cold shoulder after John had got back from hiding in the park before the issue was dropped again for a while.
Later that night found Sherlock lying on the couch in his thinking pose, he was mulling over one of his favourite topics: the fascinating entity that is Doctor John Watson. ‘Take care of yourself because no one else is going to.’ With the knowledge the detective now had about the way his blogger was brought up, the fact he lived by that statement was more than understandable.
“So, he should be alright, then?” The DI asked, a grin breaking out over his face when Dr Fennel nodded in confirmation. “Oh, that’s brilliant news! I know he’s not walking out of here anytime soon but still… everyone in the precinct will be happy to hear that.” Lestrade clapped Sherlock on the shoulder, knocking him out of the relieved fog that he’d slipped in to.
“And God help me, it felt good! It didn’t feel like vengeance… it felt like justice.” Dr Chen looked down at his hands in a moment of shame. “It was a high I’d never felt before… and I knew I had to do it again. I’ve been telling Cecilia for years that Alice has been taking donations but she always dismissed me because no stock was missing. She didn’t understand, didn’t
“You absolute… bastard! You watched me cry at your graveside and
“Sherlock Holmes! I would never have figured you for being such a pleasure seeker.” John was attempting to sound scandalised but the effect was promptly undermined by the way he groaned when the detective nibbled lightly on his earlobe.
“I see, no, it’s not creepy. Don’t worry. Thank you for coming.” Mrs Price’s face had fallen into a gentle smile, she glanced over her shoulder towards the living room. “Jonathan is just with someone now but I’ll be sure to tell him you dropped by, Mr -?” Whatever the doctor was about to say was interrupted by crashing and a shout.
“Alexa Harris, aged 25, lived here with her fiancé, Patrick Underwood. Neighbour called the police at hearing a loud row, not unusual, but the screaming afterwards was. Uniformed officers looked in the front window and saw her lying on the floor and forced entry.” The pair of them walked in sync, having done this routine a number of times in the last six months, they’d got it down to a fine art.
John sighed and put his phone back in his pocket, money was always a trouble spot between Sherlock and himself, even before they started dating. The doctor had a fiercely independent streak, he’d watched his parents work full time to make ends meet and bring up two kids in a socially deprived area of Edinburgh. He’d learnt the value of money at a young age, getting a part time job in his teens while he was still at school.
John thought as he got up and headed into his kitchen, he picked up the whiskey bottle as he passed and put it in the fridge before leaning down to open the freezer and take an ice pack. He’d just sat back down on the couch when his phone rang.
“There’s too much blood to really get much information from the body. The wounds are concentrated around the chest, chances are the lungs were punctured very quickly which would have prevented Callahan from screaming for help. Molly should be able to tell us just how many of these were actually inflicted post-mortem.” The detective frowned as he carefully turned over one of the victim’s hands, checking for defensive wounds.
“Forgiveness and trust are two separate things, Sherlock! You forgive someone when you aren’t angry with them anymore. Trust isn’t about anger.” John got up from his chair, looking afraid that the detective was going to wake up the whole street with his livid stomping. He grabbed Sherlock by his arms, just above the elbows to stop him.
Sherlock’s mind finished John’s sentence for him. The detective leaned forward, placing his hand over John’s, the one that wasn’t holding the gun. He squeezed it, trying to convey to him that Sherlock didn’t think feeling overwhelmed was being pathetic, that he’d never think that of him.
Sherlock shuffled so he was sitting beside his friend, putting an arm around his shoulders and pulling him to lean against his chest. It seemed that John didn’t want him to say anything, he just needed his presence. That, Sherlock could do. If John Watson needed him there, there he would be.
John was sitting on the couch watching the telly. He’d made himself get back up after a seven hour sleep, not wanting to mess up his body clock too much. The doctor was still knackered and all the muscles in his body ached. His eyes had drifted closed for the hundredth time when he heard the front door and footsteps on the stairs. Sherlock swept into the room, eyes darting around until they found John and stared at him.
Descriptions/Reference to Past Grooming/Sexual Abuse.
He slapped himself sharply across the face, taking his terror and shoving it into a hastily erected broom cupboard marked ‘LATER’ in his Mind Palace and locking it tightly.
But the dreaded moment never came, John was relieved and could only assume that either: 1. Sherlock knew and was content to ignore it in favour of maintaining their friendship or 2. The man who abhors sentiment and avoids relationships couldn’t spot a crush the size of the London Eye even if it lived with him and made him tea on a regular basis.
“Right, let me put you down next to the couch and see if there’s an ice pack or something in the freezer.” The doctor got into the living room and gently knelt down to put the detective back on his feet. He made sure his partner had his balance before straightening back up.
Mrs Hudson let go of John’s arm and Sherlock saw his friend straighten his spine and march to the microphone before giving those in front of him a long hard look.
Once he’d had some tea and scones, the doctor grabbed his medical bag and set about bandaging his left hand. He put some padding over his bruised knuckles before using medical tape to strap and support it.
“He claims to have an alibi, we’ll need to check that out.” John had waved down a passing taxi and bundled them in.
They got back to their flat, John feeling every single one of the seventeen steps on their stairs go through him like a lightning strike. Sherlock hovered protectively, managing to distract Mrs Hudson by asking for some tea and snacks in half an hour. She groused about the fact she wasn’t their housekeeper but everyone knew there’d be a tray ready on time.
Chen got down on his haunches in front of his captive.
The former soldier took advantage of the fact his legs hadn’t been bound to stand and investigate a little further. He saw a flight of stairs leading to a door, he imagined it was probably locked, not that he had hands to try the door handle at any rate. There was no natural light so John was trying to be careful in his movements, however as he walked the perimeter of the cellar, a leg of the chair caught on a tarpaulin over some boxes and kicked up a cloud of dust.
He made a show of running across the road and up to the house in a panic, furiously pounding on the door with tears in his eyes as he looked around in fear. When the door was pulled open angrily, he launched straight in to his act.
Some hours later and Sherlock was checking his appearance in the full-length mirror he kept in his room. John had yet to come back downstairs, except to have a shower an hour or so ago. The car that Mycroft had arranged for them would be here in half an hour and Sherlock needed time to co-ordinate John’s accessories for him. The detective was hoping to convince his partner to wear the Sekonda watch he’d bought for him; it would go marvellously with the colour of the suit.
Sometime later found the pair of them walking through the streets visiting places where their courier could unload the tablet he’d stolen. They were heading for a ‘CashConverters’ type place when John grabbed Sherlock’s wrist and squeezed it tightly.
” Mycroft watched as the detective’s eyes slowly widened as he came to a realisation.
It was finally here. The day that John was supposed to be meeting Mr and Mrs Holmes for dinner. The suit issue had come up a couple more times in the intervening period but without a final resolution, they were at an utter impasse. John had expected Sherlock to mention it again over breakfast, and the fact that he hadn’t had made the doctor suspicious.
“Really? That’s a reduction in rank, right there. Makes you wonder what he did to deserve a demotion.” The detective got back to his feet. “And as for the phone, if our killer just wanted to destroy it, they’d have done that and left it in the bathroom. No, they’ve taken it for another reason. Well, I think I’ve got everything I can from here. Let’s go check out Callahan’s place.”
“You can’t guilt me, sir, I’ve lived with guilt and shame for so long now that I’ve forgotten what it was like before. I’ve done what I can for him. Eric will be fine, he’s stronger than me.” Bartley took a shaking breath as a fresh wave of tears flooded his eyes before an alarming sense of calm washed over his face.
“I was a good man once, Mr Holmes, a good doctor, a good husband… a good father. But I’m starting to believe that being ‘good’ in this world of ours is nothing but stupidity.” Dr Chen looked down at his prisoner again. “I just wanted to make my daughter’s life as easy as possible, that’s all.” Sherlock met Chen’s gaze with a hard look and a huff.
His salary from his Army days mostly accumulated in his account while he was overseas, he didn’t really have much of a chance for discretionary spending in an active warzone. That all changed once he was shot and medivacced back to the UK. It didn’t take long for his savings to be depleted and his Army Pension was a pittance due to the short tenure of his service.
“Sherlock, where’s my grey suit?” John asked in a clipped tone as he came down the stairs, having searched every nook and cranny on the third floor for it. The detective was sitting at the kitchen table looking through his microscope and pointedly ignoring him. John sighed and headed into their shared bedroom to look in there. He was more careful in his search because Sherlock had some sort of clothes filing system that he didn’t like being messed up.
“Why now?” Sherlock’s mind was whirling with plans to try and get that bottle out of the man’s hand. He needed to distract him and keep him talking for as long as possible. “You said it yourself, it’s been four years. What happened that made you take action now?” The police backup and the paramedics had arrived, standing behind the pair of them and watching the stand off. Morgan straightened his spine and met Sherlock’s eyes defiantly, a movement that reminded the detective strongly of John.
“Does the fact our suspect carried her here rule out someone who is blind?” Greg asked as he jotted down everything the Consulting Detective said in his notepad.
“John? I’ve taken the liberty of bringing you some clothes and your dressing gown. They are just outside the door, let me know if you require my assistance with placing your plasters.” Sherlock’s voice floated through and John couldn’t help but smile to himself.
“I’ve been thinking about the inheritance money.” John spoke in a low voice when the kiss broke, Sherlock beginning to unknot the tie he was wearing. “It’s been sitting there for over two years doing nothing so I think I’m going to donate most of it to charities that work towards eradicating poverty.” Once again, the detective found himself astounded at the compassion his lover had for his fellow man and an idea came to him.
“And if that isn’t winning at something, then I don’t know what is, quite frankly.” John was breathing a little heavily as he quickly handcuffed their suspect’s hands behind his back. He then used his belt to lash his legs together before pulling a walkie talkie out from his jacket. “Alright, put the main lights on, Greg, I’ve got him.” A moment later and the whole factory floor was lit up.
have a chance to lay one finger on him.” Bartley snarled out those words as he moved the bottle closer to his lips when Lestrade attempted to take a step forward, making the DI fall back.
