"I might not be human but my problem is so very much." the devil added gravely. He even sounded annoyed which came as a curve ball to Sherlock.
"Would you mind if I tried my hand on writing them up? I don't have anything to do either way and it might give me something to occupy my time with because I think I've watched all of reality TV twice now." John smiled openly. It wasn't hard to feel content and happy around Sherlock, he found.
“You were already interesting when you stumbled into my flat. I mean you were drunk beyond believe but although you obviously knew who was standing in front of you, you went into attack rather than defence mode”, Sherlock’s voice was a bit hesitant, recalling how they had first met. “You felt like you had done nothing wrong so you stood up for that. Most people just shy away when pushed accordingly, giving up their point of view to avoid confrontation. You didn’t. It’s rare and unusual and I think those things are fascinating. I tried figuring out why you did what you did during the term break. There are only so many times you can turn over a single encounter that’s why I needed new data. I make a point of now spending too much time near the rest of the students but in order to get my data I obviously had to.”
"No, they just checked you over and found one or two more issues than just the bullet that ripped through your thigh muscle." John pointed out. Luckily, there were cabs waiting in front of the hospital. Sherlock likely wouldn't rest until he was back in the flat.
"Like I said, I can do all the work behind the scenes, but I won't be able to physically apprehend him. I need Lestrade's help not because I am too lazy but because I physically can't move enough before he will be an even bigger pain in the arse for you."
"I just expected there to be… more" Sherlock shrugged and turned around. He just sold his soul to that man, so he was allowed a bit of complaining.
"Food is boring" Sherlock groaned, plucking up one sheet and scrawling a few more notes on it. The groundworks of this case would be how daemon deals could be abused. To figure out that part, he first needed to find out under which parameters and rules they actually ran. John keeping the information like a trade secret didn't help him at all. He had the prime source, the devil, sitting right under his nose but still he was confined to better guesswork. Sherlock was frustrated and the thumbs hadn't been nearly as interesting as initially promised.
Before he could sink too deep into the question and insecurities there was a short, loud knock echoing from the door. Obviously, his time was up. John swallowed hard and went to open the door.
“Nope”, John grinned and pulled Sherlock close enough so the other couldn’t move, “We can sort that out in a minute or I can, on my own.”
"In what world is that the logical course of action?" John huffed "Not only is it uncaring but also completely idiotic. I'm not giving up the chance to definitely catch him for perhaps catching him earlier. If there is one thing I'm good at it's waiting. I've been doing that for eons."
"Well, it did cause quite the stir." the devil nodded, "The thing is: Daemons usually don't ask for reasons. Souls are quite valuable and obviously there is a quota to meet otherwise you couldn't run this organisation. This just means that when someone wants to sell his soul, you can bet on them coming running and doing whatever you want no questions asked."
"And obviously you couldn't let him do that. He's too evil for you or what is it?" Sherlock's preferred method of defence was to attack and while it could get potentially dangerous, it might also get enough of a rise out of the other to reveal bypassed information.
“I told you, I would take you apart”, John breathed and nipped at the plush bottom lip right in front of his face, “And I’m going to do exactly that now.”
Just when the pale eyes were flicking up and down his body, John was somewhat awoken from his stiffness. “Sorry, is there something wrong with my clothes?” he cleared his throat and stepped back as far as his door would allow, trying to get a bit of distance between himself and the other.
Sherlock hummed. It really all seemed to boil down to 'You've brought this on yourself'. Having at least a few more information made the mess which was currently penetrating his life a bit more tangible, a bit more sortable. There still were too many elements of the supernatural involved for Sherlock taste but he could slowly find workable angles.
"As long as it doesn't come out of Mrs. Hudson's oven and has at least a cup of sugar in it, I'm assuming" John grinned. Although most surprises about how Sherlock lived were firmly in the category of biohazardous and 'I'm surprised you didn't manage to come downstairs quicker than your 13 years', others were more innocent. For example John had found out that Sherlock had a ridiculous sweet tooth and while he would pick at most foods, anything sweet would be eaten without complaint.
"I'm pretending, I didn't hear that" John hummed, gently tapping his fingers against the soft upholstering of the arms, "Since you didn't feel like briefing me beforehand, I assume you either haven't thought of a cover story or where childish enough to not tell me out of spite."
John was leaning slightly against his door, as he pushed the key in and clicked the lock open. He was just about to leave the hallway.
Sherlock felt himself be pulled forward by an invisible force until he, against his will, found himself in the other armchair. His jaw was set tightly. He knew the contract in and out, he hadn’t made a mistake. So what did the other want? The problem was that Sherlock couldn’t deduce the devil. The devil wasn’t a person, even if he appeared to be one, and therefore none of his methods worked. It put Sherlock down on the same level as ordinary humans, having to rely on verbally given information and their correctness. To a certain degree that experience was annoying, stressful and utterly anxiety inducing.
“Yes”, John moaned and tightened his hands involuntarily on Sherlock’s hips in an effort to not start mindlessly thrusting into the heat which enveloped his cock. “You are so beautiful. So beautiful Sherlock, you have no idea.” The doctor wanted to weep tears of joy. It was so different to the night before and yet it all seemed so similar. Sherlock’s scent and body were so near and his Alpha senses were running wild.
John paused briefly, turning himself more squarely towards Sherlock. "Because I don't actually take anything that isn't given willingly and", he gently cupped Sherlock's chin to press a soft kiss to Sherlock's bottom lip, "I wouldn't have been able to coerce you into anything for days now, even if I had wanted to."
"No" John chuckled "You can eat as much shellfish as you want and have as many children out of wedlock as you can care for. Even if you murder without feeling a shred of guilt that won't be something we can get you for. Doesn't mean we haven't developed something like moral over time, too it's just a very individual thing and therefore can't be held against humans."
John pulled Sherlock gently along, up the stairs and into his own room. The dressing gown was not concealing a lot, the expensive fabric falling loosely and more importantly openly around Sherlock’s form.
"You'd have a nice piece of jewellery that would pose a few minor inconveniences for a lot of daemons but I could simply take it off." John smiled.
"Ah, yes. Well" the devil fixed him with an intense glare, "You have to know that we really tried everything else. You are not the first person I sought out. We have our methods and usually they work quite well, or at least they help us to get rid of minor inconveniences."
"What a hateful bunch" Sherlock grumbled as he limped out of the hospital doors. It hurt but he definitely wasn't about to accept help. Not after he had worked hours on convincing the doctors to let him go. They hadn't been concerned much with the wound itself since it hadn't pierced any important arteries. His blood loss and subsequent blackout were more of a concern to them and after stitching up his leg, they had wanted to keep him in for observation. At the time, he had been too weak to put up much of a fight so he stayed the night. As soon as he had woken the next morning, he was hell bend on getting out of there. Hospitals weren't his favourite place especially when doctors were trying to unearth more and more information.
“Stay”, John hummed, “I won’t be responsible for any accidents that happen to you while your body is jello.”
“How old are you?”, he asked, swallowing. There had been talks in certain circles that with the wealth he had gathered, John ought to look for an Omega but he never really considered it. The idea of buying another human being and binding someone blood young to himself simply felt wrong. He hadn’t given the talks more thought until now. Of course his family had been all for it, generally being all in for showing off how successful their son had gotten. “If this is really what I think it is, I will have to get angry.”, he muttered. With soft eyes he looked at the Omega and held out a cashmere blanket, “Here, the thing you’re wearing can’t be warm. I see if I can find your clothes, there must be some here. Calm down a bit and when you think you can talk, come to the lounge. The bath is through that door. Please do what you need to feel better. I’m leaving you here, trusting you can take care of yourself.”
"What then is good and bad? Since religion seems to be out of the equation, I'm not quite sure how one should live." Sherlock asked concerned. He already knew that he would probably face a myriad of charges.
“I’ll need this bit of information confirmed” Sherlock nearly purred, rubbing his cheek against the inside of John’s thigh.
"But there is still a system of punishment in place, so I can't quite believe you are totally innocent here" Sherlock interjected.
"Well, thanks to your superb policing skills, there actually is" Sherlock snarled back, quickly sweeping his look once across her body, "And do tell Anderson to give his wife my regards when she returns from her trip." He used Sally's surprise to pull himself out of her grip and continue on towards his initial destination. Of course the possibility had been there but Sherlock had hoped that he wouldn't have to face her right the first time he brought John along. Somehow, it felt important how John perceived him in his chosen work space and that wasn't a road he wanted to explore deeper.
"Oh, what's up with you two then?" Mrs. Hudson asked when she opened the door of her flat. Peaking at the trouble in her hallway.
"Hm" John hummed, letting his hand wander further towards the nape of Sherlock's neck, twirling a few strands of curly hair around his finger, "As far as I can remember, you've always been very open to my suggestions. Well at least until you decided something was incredibly useless that is."
John grinned, “I don’t know but you seem to be enthusiastic enough about following me and for me to stay sane with this arrangement I need to talk to you because I feel controlled.”
From experience he knew that he wouldn’t have any problems to come from anal stimulation alone during his heat. It was all just a question of finding the right angle and hitting his prostate with the proper amount of force. Suddenly he wasn’t just mechanically trying to fulfil a need, his mind ran wild imagining John beneath him. Their heated bodies slapping together where Sherlock was grinding down on the other’s lap. Sherlock let out breathy little moans, the fantasy just that bit too much for him but his mind didn’t give him a rest. He continued imagining John lying beneath him gripping his waist tight and pulling him down hard onto his cock. Or perhaps he was sitting, pressing the other against his chest. Sherlock gasped, liking that fantasy best. He would be able to nuzzle right into the place on the other’s neck where the smell was the strongest. He bit his lip, knowing his fantasies were a bit not good but couldn’t shake how good they made him feel. The heat and pressure was steadily growing inside him and he nearly screamed as his orgasm washed over him, his hole clamping down on the fake knot at the base of the toy. He shuddered and let himself drop face forward into the pillows, breath still erratic. His thoughts before he fell into a short nap all circled around in confusion. No Alpha had ever made an appearance in his fantasies. Never had he actually felt like wanting to exchange his solitude against a real human seeing him through the heat. With his face again buried in now a mixed smell of sex, his own pheromones and the underlying tone of John he drifted off. He was in trouble, in deep trouble.
In the end he just put on some pyjamas he found in the case and wrapped the blanket back around himself tightly. None of the clothes had been anything he had actually already worn. Everything was so new it could have had the tag still on. Sherlock hated it. It was just another reminder how utterly over his old life was. With cautious steps he went along the hallway, through a kitchen and stood in the large sliding door leading towards the lounge. The Alpha was sitting with his back to him in an old armchair, mug in hand.
He was still high from the chase. That crime had been a particularly stimulating one. A victim in a locked room within a locked room mystery. It had entertained him for a whole week until he had figured out what happened. After that, finding the culprit had been the work of a mere day. Still, the conclusion to such a wonderful distraction always left Sherlock swimming in endorphins. Lestrade had let him go since he figured he wouldn’t have any success with getting a statement from the consulting detective, even if he chained him to a chair.
"I knew you'd be concerned about that part" the devil smirked and shook his head. Sherlock’s soul disappeared from his hand as easily as it had been summoned. "Believe me, I'm desperate enough to let you write up the conditions. Just keep in mind that I still don't need to accept them. So be reasonable if you want your soul back." A piece of parchment, the same kind the initial contract had been written on, appeared. The devil handed it to Sherlock who took it with caution.
"It's not funny, don't ask how many people are actually surprised when they find out about it. It's a butt load of work." John grumbled but smirked, too.
"What do you propose then?" Sherlock asked and turned towards Lestrade, "Your hoard of imbeciles will just blunder all over town and alert him that we're on his tracks. I can't use that."
In the end Sherlock didn’t even know what did it, just that he was stifling a scream in John’s shoulder and clinging to the other as his body spiralled out of control. Shortly he feared he would black out from the intense sensation but he was grounded firmly into reality by the presence of a warm body against his. It took a few gulping deep breaths before he even attempted to get up out of his crumpled position but he was held down.
In a way, time seemed to stop for Sherlock when John's lips were back on his. Previously, it had all seemed rather innocent. This time there was intent for more behind every touch. The bedroom became like a little bubble they inhabited which had no connection to the world outside. It made it surprisingly easy for Sherlock to let go of the last restrains he had still been holding on to. He had always assumed that he wasn't a very feeling person but John was currently proving him wrong. Sherlock felt every touch on his skin and it spread like wildfire through his veins. He was sure that he was losing his mind but the sensory overload his body was sending to his brain was apparently exactly what he had been needing. Never in his wildest dreams had he assumed that this was something he could want, could enjoy. He felt John's hands wander lower, scratching slightly over the skin of his abdomen before they pushed away the waistband of his trousers. It was probably about then that his brain signed out completely, letting him fall deeper into the sensation flooding his nervous system. His vision went white and while he perceived his head was thrown back, neck arched upwards, he didn't remember moving out of the kiss. One hand was still holding on to John's hair while the other was gripping the sheets on his bed. His body was caught in a rush of hormones out of his control. His voice acted on its own accord and Sherlock felt like he was getting lost in it all until he heard soft words speak next to his ear.
Sherlock sat on the couch, face in his hands. He was desperate. More than anything he needed to know about the reasons for these crimes and he feared all the work of the past two hours had been tainted by his anger. It had started with finding John missing and it seemed like he could not shake it off. John had been good to him although there was no primal reason for it. He was playing along, as if he was just another human. Sherlock had to admit, the devil fitted too well into his life as if unintentionally he had always left the space empty. Sherlock was sure he was going mad. He had needed to close himself off but he had failed. Suddenly, here he was, rendered completely useless by a simple argument. Objectively, he was in the right. Subjectively, he felt like rolling up into a ball and shutting out the rest of the world.
in your books”, Sherlock graciously reminded him of his poor choice of words earlier “So, I ask again John Watson: How did you like it?”
"Hardly. She just confirmed a theory I had built after looking back through the other four files. They were all people with either monetary problems or people who were extremely naive when it came to investment opportunities." Sherlock shrugged, continuing to look through the pockets of the victim's clothes for any clue they might have on them, "She's in her early thirties. Make of clothes suggests someone who cares about their appearance, every item is by a high-end brand. Age of clothes suggests, she isn't someone with that much money to spare on a regular basis. The coat is nearly two years old and the shoes are from last season, probably bought in a warehouse sale. Her hair looks nice enough but is kept in a practical style which can be maintained by anyone. Therefore eliminating the need for an expensive hairstylist every eight weeks. Still, she looks decent enough. She colour coordinates her outfit with the jewellery she wears. This points towards someone wanting to appear professional. The train ticket in her pocket suggests, she came into the city yesterday around late afternoon. No case with her means she has her clothes in a hotel room. She probably owns a small business and has lately fallen on hard times. Someone made her an offering which she couldn't refuse. She was too practical to question a deal which would give her a financial cushion, I mean look at her nails. She came to the city and was set up in a hotel room by our culprit. Then she either got a welcome drink with the drug in it or went to a meeting where she would undoubtedly have had at least a glass of water. Humans are surprisingly easy to drug via the things they eat or drink. No one really bothers to look too closely or question a slightly off taste too deeply. Then… oh look at this." Sherlock abruptly stopped his lightning quick explanations to grin and pull out a business card from one of the coat pockets. It was white, thick cardstock with an embossed black print on it. There weren't a lot of information on it, just a telephone number on the one side and an address on the other.
“Everything you’ve just said is completely bullshit. I mean: Who am I to tell you whether you should inform yourself about sex and how? But it’s not about assuming what someone would do or worse doing something you don’t feel comfortable doing. Sex is something you work out together on the go.” John explained seriously.
"Please, don't be so obtuse." Sherlock sighed "You know it is vital to this case that I know as much as possible. The problem is that so far you, as the most trusted source of information, have given me nothing. I can't help but think, you actually don't want me to succeed with this case."
Sherlock was moaning and arching his back, pushing his body into the contact. “Please”, he breathed, reaching out with one hand to grip John’s shoulders, the other was fisted tightly into the bedding.
There weren't many options left. In all honesty, Sherlock could only think of one and that was probably stupid - stupid and very silly. Still, if you are dying, there is not much you have to loose. Sherlock squared his shoulders and spoke to the emptiness in his flat. "Hey, let's talk about that deal again."
Sherlock leaned back slightly to get a clear line of sight towards John and shot him a look of 'Why did you tell him that? Now we're not getting out of a lecture.' John just shrugged with what hopefully counted as an apologetic facial expression. How should he have known that Sherlock hadn't told the DI what had transpired. Although in hindsight, why would Sherlock tell the DI when he had gone off to do something he had been explicitly forbidden to do?
With a flourish the other took of his coat and tossed it over the back of a chair, toeing off his shoes. “But he would’ve never managed to aim well enough to hit one of us. Besides, I’m not even sure if the thing wouldn’t have backfired spectacularly. You know antique weapons are not the most reliable sort.”
"Perhaps not in a direct cause and effect way but there are some basic rules." John pointed out, leaning against the counter while he waited for the water to boil. The few minutes it took to ready tea felt like an eternity, even if they got him a bit of time to put his words in order. It wasn't as if he didn't want to desperately help Sherlock at the moment, it just wasn't possible.
“Stop teasing now”, Sherlock demanded, crawling forward towards the edge of the bed and extending his arm to tug John closer on his belt loops. “I complied, now it’s your turn”, nimble fingers were pushing John’s jeans down, taking his pants right along and there was nothing he could or wanted to do about it.
“I just got us something nice to look at.”; Anna grinned cheekily. “Sarah, really it’s all fine. There is just one rule: You can only look, not touch.” Anna had gotten quite serious. “Dominic would be fine with whatever you decided to do since he trusts you. But I made the deal with the hottie and that was the ground rule.”
Sarah had quite a few things on her mind when they had finally found a place to eat. Their lunch in front of them, the words came bubbling out of her mouth.
John took a deep breath. Okay, so much for processing the incidents of the evening in peace. He must be absolutely mad. Dazed John walked into his flat and looked around. He couldn’t imagine Sherlock, weird name but it seemed oddly fitting, in these surroundings. John looked down his own body and contemplated the other’s words. Shower. Well, if someone who was bloody gorgeous wanted to come to give you a private dance show, you could also make an effort to not reek like an entire club.
It felt awkward to say nothing and just stand there in his open door. Therefore he called out the first thing which came to his mind, “I don’t even know your name.”
"You know if anyone finds out what I'm doing here to clean up their mess, I never get my authority back in working condition." John chuckled and brewed tea. Although he really didn't need sustenance, he had found out that tea was something he actually enjoyed. Even if it was just to pass the time of which he had way too much at night, since it wasn't acceptable to be out every night. Mrs. Hudson really had a keen eye and ear.
"Mhm" Sherlock affirmed, having closed his eyes at the soothing feeling of John's fingertips across his head. If the other continued, he might even be coerced into telling the whole story.
"Perhaps not directly but you withhold information" Sherlock pointed out "You tell me you want to hire me for a case. I take it. You tell me it has to do with daemon deals gone awry. I'm curious. I want to know about daemon deals. You tell me to go off and find information on my own. I want to know if the information I got was correct. You say, you cannot tell me. Seeing a pattern emerge? You let me go on a wild goose chase, knowing full-well that those are not human parameters and the case I took claimed to be just human. You are dangerously close to breaking the deal, I am not. Therefore, tell me what I need to know!"
Sherlock paused for a moment. He wasn't sure if he had heard correctly. In all the time he had helped out the Yard, no one had actually called any of it brilliant. They happily took whatever information he found for them, but praise was usually not part of the equation. It was new to not be directly insulted for his reasoning. Although John was the devil and they just had had a major disagreement, Sherlock couldn't help but feel a small warm feeling spreading in his chest. For once he welcomed it, caring very little about consequences.
"You identified a possible suspect and didn't think to tell me about it?" Lestrade asked, obviously feeling slightly betrayed.
“If you must, grip the chair.” Sherlock said, his voice translating exactly how serious he was about the rules. John simply nodded, wanting to give an acknowledgement, and clasped his hands together.
Sherlock huffed but thought of another question he could trade in for a kiss. The game didn't seem as silly anymore. He was surprised at how quickly his feelings had turned.
“Hey, everything fine? Just don’t listen to him” John smiled and reached out to put a hand comforting on the kid’s shoulder “Just go, you never actually have to stay and listen to someone insulting you. Walk away and that’s that.”
"So sure, of yourself that you only need a day?" John grinned but gently pulled Sherlock to his feet. He couldn’t help to find the other’s fighting spirit endearing.
John gave Sherlock a piercing death stare and growled "How about we don't test my patience in that way."
“Sherlock”, John groaned and tried to press the other away, “You’re not man of your senses anymore. Don’t make me do something you’ll regret when you have a clear mind again.” The doctor was still quite a bit stronger and so managed to wrestle Sherlock back onto the bed.
Their impromptu meeting was the last time John saw Sherlock for a few days. It got some comments from Molly and Toby but John didn’t care about them. He had made his point clear and apparently Sherlock had listened. Against everything he had thought, John found himself strangely missing the silent presence of the other. His ego would probably not survive him admitting that he had felt a bit special while the attention of the mysterious youth had been centred on him.  There had been something weirdly satisfying in commanding the presence of someone that was fought over on the whole campus. It irritated John to no avail because that wasn’t at all like him. Why did he want to have Sherlock behaving so unlike himself? Sure the other was quite beautiful. John had had enough one on one meetings to draw that conclusion for himself, thank you very much. Nevertheless there were plenty other beautiful people, too. People who didn’t seem to make a living out of being an arse and breaking into other students rooms. But it seemed as if John’s head was fixed on one particular dark mop of curls and those ridiculously pouty lips. He sighed and pushed the door to his room open, nearly dropping the stack of books in his arm.
Sherlock was pressing his body even further into the wall, a few sobs bubbling up in his throat without him wanting them to. He could only see the Alpha as the threat to him that he was. His pheromones must have drenched the air by now and it would only be a matter of time until the instincts would take over and he couldn’t do anything about it. Never had he felt so utterly helpless and scared.
Sherlock looked up at John and back at the corpse, biting his lip. John probably could help; the problem was that Sherlock had no idea how to explain to the DI where the miraculous discovery came from without using 'The devil checked for me' as an excuse. "Yes, might jog my memory" he mumbled and left Lestrade standing with his crew and corpse. Upstairs he pulled John behind the flat door, closing it.
A few sips of tea calmed Sherlock’s nerves enough for him to start speaking, trying to find answers to all the questions the Alpha, no John, had asked. “I usually don’t need painkillers, cramps are never that bad but I would be grateful if I got birth control. I mean just to be sure.” He didn’t want to anger the other with his request so it was spoken very timidly. “Of course, no problem if you feel that is what you need.”, John nodded and Sherlock breathed relieved. “I don’t need much otherwise. A door I can lock would be good but I don’t want to cause inconvenience for you, so I can take the guestroom.”
John paused for a moment and observed Sherlock. It was heart-breaking to see the genius absolutely crestfallen. Finally, John decided to act. He might not be able to alleviate Sherlock's pain or rush his recovery, but he could amend contracts. After all he was the devil. He made the rules, he could change them. With a swift motion he conjured up their initial contract. That thing had started a wild ride and John had to smile slightly.
“Of course you don’t”, John sighed and stood up, taking his cup with him, “You know where I live and apparently you know how to get in, too. If you are willing to actually tell me why you do all of this then you can come around but I don’t need you wasting my time even more than you are already doing.” He squeezed Sherlock’s shoulder once before he left the coffee shop.
"Couldn't you as the devil of all, have waved your hands about and visited him. I'm sure you have your ways."
"Is he now?" Sherlock asked a lot more interested and focussed on what John was saying than the background noise of the new clues whirling around in his head. "What exactly have his deals been for?"
"Well then" John hummed and carefully cradled Sherlock, reasoning this would be quicker than trying to let him hobble through the flat.
“I have no problem with that” Sherlock smirked, running his hand along John’s jawline to the back of his head to pull him closer, “I might even be glad you did.”
The look of confusion slowly took over that of utter defeat and while it wasn't the best it was already better John decided.
"Let me check for you" John hummed "And we'll concern ourselves with the why later." He gently stroked his thumb across Sherlock's cheek, marvelling at Sherlock's ability to completely get stuck into a case. "Wait a moment, will you?" John said and was gone.
“Oh god”, Sherlock whined, his face screwed up with pleasure. His eyes were firmly closed and moth was hanging slightly agape.
Sherlock gnawed at his bottom lip. It was true. The reports glossed over quite a few parts where it was obvious the DI hadn't quite caught what he had been rambling on about.
Sherlock rolled his eyes "I'm living very comfortably here in this flat and so far it's all working out fine without having to deal with a lot of private clients. There are just a few idiots who somehow find out about what I do. Are you behind that?"
“Then why are you wasting your time breathing down my neck?” attack had always been John’s defence of choice. It had already gotten him the one or other blue eye but in the end that didn’t matter in the grand scheme of things. To his amusement there was no answer so he turned around grinning at the other student who was standing just inches from him with a slightly confused look. “Well, that was fun, wasn’t it? It seems like you are not used to people finding your threats everything but threatening. If you basked enough in my presence, I’d like you to leave now because some of us actually are here to study and not go around playing mafia”, he continued to organise books and notes, trying his best to ignore that he still had another person standing in the middle of his room.
“What do you want? I clearly remember giving a condition as to under which circumstances you were allowed to break into my room again”, John hoped his voice was calm and collected. So exactly the two things he wasn’t feeling at the moment. “I would still have no problem throwing you out of the window”, perhaps a little threat would mask over any feelings he didn’t want to show and the fact that the other was currently on his bed in a way John might or might not have dreamed about during the last days.
The fumbling words had John looking up from where he was sitting on his armchair, taking in the whole form of the young Omega currently standing in his sitting room. The clothing was looking professional but the clean edges of the crisp suit still weren’t able to hide just how young Sherlock was. John cleared his throat, “So what are you going to do now? I mean where are you planning to go?”
"My brain is working just fine, thank you." Sherlock huffed, "God, this will be awful. I'll be chained to the flat."
As soon as he woke up Sherlock knew something was off. Normally he was fully alert the moment his conscience returned to his body after sleep. The fog he had to fight through now told him that his sleep hadn’t been voluntarily but drug induced. A dabble or two with narcotics in line with an experiment let him asses that the amount used had been quite liberal. Someone had needed him out cold for a longer amount of time. Spreading his fingers and stretching his legs let the young boy stop immediately and shoot upright. The feeling of the sheets was wrong, the quality of the mattress, too. When he thought about it the smell surrounding him wasn’t right either. There was an underlying hint of Alpha spreading throughout the room.
John smiled softly, "Is that a problem? Can't we just slowly go on and see what might come and deal with it when it arrives? Because I don't know what's happening either." He dared to pull Sherlock into a gentle hug again, reassured that none of his powers were running lose.
“Oh god”, Sherlock mumbled, his head falling back against the bed, arching his throat into the touch of the blonde’s lips.
Sherlock tried every trick and method he had picked up over the years to figure out if this wasn't just some nutter who had gained access to his flat.
John just sighed, “I need a cup of tea. I’m exhausted and the wet weather is really rather uncomfortable. Do you want one too or are you going to disappear into your room again? What are you even doing there the whole time?”
So there would be a dancer. Well, John could appreciate a good body so he did not think he would have a problem with the show program. Okay, a woman might have been nicer for him, but this was Sarah’s night and if the guy wasn’t totally incompetent, he would also enjoy it.
“Sherlock, I’m going to…” John wanted to warn the other but Sherlock just pushed deeper, swallowing a few times and John couldn’t hold on anymore. He came open-mouthed with a silent cry, his hand in Sherlock’s neck momentarily tightening.
"It's about that?" John asked incredulously. It seemed way too simple to solve their problem. Obviously, you'd be mad when you only got a specific time frame instead of 'however long you may live' but that was how it went. Sherlock couldn't have been spending the past seven years eating and sleeping just the bare minimum, only to maximise his time for work, could he? "Well, if it gets you eating, I swear that any time you spend eating on this case will be added on top of your 13 years should you fail to solve it. Otherwise, it shouldn't bother you because the limit won't be in place anymore." Yes, Sherlock would probably find a way to abuse the system but John didn't care at the moment. However long this would take, it would only add a maximum of a few days and he really could suffer that. It still took a moment for Sherlock to react, standing there in the middle of the living room, frustration still clearly emanating from his body.
“God, you really are a beauty”, John said, his eyes hungrily taking in the sight. The pale skin was adorned with a pink flush, the dark curls in complete disarray, Sherlock’s lips shiny from their kisses and there was the pretty cock curving upwards, making John’s mouth water.
When he pushed the door open he had expected about everything but what was presenting itself to his eyes. There was the frame of a young Omega curled up in one of the corners, trembling ferociously and tears of panic streaking his cheeks. John stood in the doorframe shocked until the doctor in him kicked into gear.
"I wasn't suggesting having them 'blunder all over town' " Lestrade shook his head, "I need to open a formal case first and foremost. After I do that I can feed in the information you uncovered. Clearly, the point we will have to be involved is taking him down. That needs to be a planned operation with all the required documents and legal background in place. You cannot do this on your own."
In the end, there was no need to read over it again, as he couldn't change anything even if he found a mistake. With a deep breath Sherlock set his own signature underneath the document first. He could practically hear his brother chiding him for how idiotic he was being. With an iron grip on his mind, he pushed down the thoughts. After all, he had already done the stupid thing seven years earlier. Now, he was only trying to get himself out of the corner he had backed himself into. Not even Mycroft could be disapproving of that much initiative.
Since that little trip had brought him nowhere nearer to discovering what his flatmate was up to in his spare time, John was constricted to fantasising which was neither satisfying nor a thing he wanted to do for too long because it always ended in some fantasy of Sherlock exercising some weird sex practices alone in his bedroom and that was a direction John forcefully did not try to think. Especially, since he had witnessed with his own eyes that the detective was not at all completely above the carnal pleasures. That case had been something John very distinctly did not write or think about. That case was lost somewhere in the depths of his drawer never to see the light of day on his blog. He did not think about how Sherlock’s body had been pressed against their suspect. Or how he had kissed as if his life depended on it. Or even how the whole scene had be one of the most erotic John had seen although both parties had still been fully clothed. No, he definitely wouldn’t think about it. Just like he didn’t think about the jealousy that had welled up when he unsuspectingly stepped into the room. That was all something that he desperately tried to forget.
“That’s an unusual name.”, the doctor smiled warmly, “I guess you didn’t know this was about to happen, did you?”
"You know I could have helped you before" John pointed out as he plucked up the pile Sherlock had referred to. He actually had wondered what he was still doing, sitting around for an hour without Sherlock saying a single word, somewhat feeling superfluous and ignored. That had been something new.
"Sherlock, I can't really tell you that" John sighed, rubbing his hand over his forehead "And it shouldn't even be relevant."
"You think I should have just left you to bleed out on the pavement while I, most likely unsuccessful, go chasing after Moriarty?"
"Just know that whatever you do, falls directly back on him." Lestrade said and then quickly made himself busy somewhere else on the crime scene.
"What would private business do for me?" Sherlock wrinkled his nose. The few clients he got already felt like too many. They just came with deliberately pedestrian problems to waste his time.
"I have no idea what you're talking about" Sherlock said, handing the driver some money before he strode towards the front door. He needed to get into the flat, he needed his wall, his sounding board. There were too many information and possible strings crowding his head. By now, it was well past the point of him being able to organise it all inside his mind palace.
John tried on what he hoped was a friendly smile and side stepped the police officer with clear intend, "Thank you for the warning." He just wanted to follow where Sherlock had disappeared to when he thought of the other's final words. John turned around once more, looking at Sally, "By the way: Adultery is a sin. I would be careful if I were in your shoes." Oh, how he wanted to let just a bit of his true nature shimmer through but he caught himself. This matter was too important to be potentially spoiled by a little shock factor.
"I don't know. Earn you money. I heard that a lot of humans are after that, seems really popular." John raised an eyebrow and smirked.
"How do I know you're not making me do this with you devil voodoo?" Sherlock asked, voice low. Now that he had spoken the thought, the worry about the possibility settled uncomfortable in the pit of his stomach.
.” a certain degree of mirth tinged the comment. John needed to blink a few times, making sure he had just got that correctly.
"It's a law of Physics not really a 'keep your hands off because I'm wearing my holy pair of underpants' moment."
“I think, I’ve just about caught up but are you sure, Mr. Holmes?” John breathed, his lips now inches from Sherlock’s, “Wouldn’t you rather observe from afar first?” He simply couldn’t hold back that small quip.
“I don’t know.”, Sherlock drawled, his tongue not quite wanting to cooperate again at this stage. He felt oddly content, the doctor’s body a strong and warm foundation to cling to. Everything he had feared during that first day currently wasn’t that scary anymore. He didn’t want to think about it at the moment but just pressed his body closer to the other’s, trying to make words superfluous.
"And demanding" John huffed, feeling Sherlock's long fingers tighten their grip in his hair. There would be a lot of self-control to be exerted by him tonight and John already felt the edges of his persona going fuzzy. Sherlock was like a vortex, pulling him in further and further the closer he got.
“I can end you”, Sherlock was suddenly standing right behind John and just clenching his teeth kept the blond from swirling around and bodily throwing the other person out of whatever opening he could find, “It’s so easy. Just a few favours called in and you won’t be able to do a single thing anymore.”
"Shut up" Sherlock banged his fists on the table and strode over to the living room, leaving John startled at the kitchen table. The detective really was a marvel. First, he had the audacity to summon the devil for a simple crossroad deal. Then he effectively managed to trap him in a human body with the most boring backstory possible. Now, he even started screaming at him, apparently sparing no thought for the being he actually had invited into his flat.
"Okay, you've got drug abuse, thieving, disregarding the lord, desecrating a church for an experiment, I don't even want to know how you managed that", John was playfully using his fingers to count the sins he was aware of from the top of his head, "breaking with your family and that little fact with your sexuality. I'm sure I forgot something."
The devil chuckled, "Like I told you: I have a case and the last time we met you sold your soul to solve cases. It's only logical I would come here, isn't it?"
"Okay" Sherlock nodded after a while, feeling like he really wanted to move away from being the centre of their conversation "This means your job is to talk to everyone who dies? That sounds highly improbable."
John needed a moment to digest Sherlock's words. Then he needed another moment to reign himself in and only let his voice go grave. He still could not afford to do any worse, he needed to stay in control. ”You don't deserve to solve this case."
Sherlock caught those words, using them like a lifeline to struggle his way back to taking in what was happing. He could slowly disentangle the sources of information and it stopped overwhelming him. His mind was still fogged over but he felt his body again, felt John's firm grip and felt the moment his orgasm hit him with intensity. There was nothing he could compare it to, the rush of endorphins through his body was second to none experience. His body tensed and released and shook him for a few seconds which stretched out like hours, leaving him boneless. There was nothing left in him to give and a deep calm washed over him. He didn't enjoy sleep but it was coming for him fast. He tried to remember something, something still left to do but couldn't hold on to his consciousness.
"Is she always like that?" John asked, looking back puzzled at the door he had just closed. Apparently, the encounter had managed to impress him more than Sherlock initially calculated.
No chance of answering with more than a low hum for John but he freed one hand to push it behind Sherlock’s balls into his perineum. The sudden jolt of having his prostate firmly massaged from the outside made Sherlock first thrust up in surprise and then almost immediately crash over the edge. The hot liquid spilled over John’s tongue down his throat. It still wasn’t John’s favourite, all weird consistency and bitter after taste, but he mostly swallowed to avoid mess and sometimes to enjoy the look on his lovers face.
Sherlock positively whined at the loss of contact and the receding potent smell of Alpha. The parts of his skin that had shortly come into contact with John’s hand still felt like flames were licking at them. His body was burning up from the inside out. The knowledge of lying in an Alpha’s bed just made him gasp and grind down even more. Hastily he pulled off what little clothes he was wearing and squirmed against the soft feeling of cotton sheets along the length of his body. His head turned back into the pillow of its own accord, eyes fluttering close at the heavy smell he encountered. So far he had spent his heats in the confines of his room where it all just smelled like himself. Nothing like this, where every breath he took just seemed to settle the ache deeper and harder within him.
"Or what? Like you said: I'm your only shot at solving your problem. I don't think you'll dispose of me quite that unthinkingly." Sherlock smiled smugly. He was in charge. It didn't matter that the other was the devil. There were things apparently only Sherlock could do and he decided to revel in the feeling of having those tight reigns on John.
"Just means, they are drugged for the deals themselves. Probably come to the inner city on some form of mock business. Either, they are set up in a hotel room where the drug is administered or go to a meeting. Then the deal is made and when they wake up, the effects having worn off, they don't remember a thing. The pretend reason is then dropped immediately or they get some kind of temporary reimbursement."
“Yes, of course you’re not”, John rolled his eyes and started to turn away, “Still if you want to do some actual research instead of just observing, I’m getting myself a coffee now. I thought you were so fond of first-hand information. At least that’s what you are advocating relentlessly on your website.”
“Hey, are you still with me?”, John grinned as he waved a hand in front of Sherlock’s face, pulling him out of his staring, “Does it sound like something you could live with?” There wasn’t more than a hesitant nod from the Omega but immediately a bright smiled spread across John’s face. “Great, then we can set you up upstairs first and after that we see about what you’d like to do with your life. No pressure but I’d rather want to have you build something on your own. I don’t believe for a second you’d be a good housewife.” Sherlock blushed badly at that commentary but settled in more comfortably in the armchair. He breathed deeply. Yes, the start hadn’t been ideal but he could live here, he thought. The flat was warm and homey. There were no sharp, clean edges and nothing spoke of an interior designer other than the Alpha himself. Sherlock felt like the flat gave him a safe place, cocooning him in warmth and the knowledge that bad things would stay outside.
“While I’m glad you are not disinclined by my body, there are rather a few organisational things to discuss.” Sherlock chuckled, clearly amused.
"Any more information available already?" Sherlock asked, trying to get his brain back on track for the case again. Not having John trail behind him, threw him off more than it should have. He had been working alone for years and after all the other was the devil.
While he was running errands for Sherlock, John had been caught up in his mind just mechanically buying everything that was on his list and a few things he just thought might be handy to have. When his practice had taken up shape the topic of an Omega had been broached by his mother numerous times. For a moment he had even thought that he could do it, get a young Omega just to have them out of the traditional claws, perhaps fund them an education and let them get a life they wanted. But he had scraped that thought just as quickly as it had come. They would still be bonded to him against their will and never have the freedom to find someone their own age to love and cherish. With that the topic had been closed for him but how the young man who was currently in his flat showed, his mother had just been waiting for an opportune moment to push the whole dilemma back on him. He really needed to find out more about the circumstances of the deal. That all could wait until after he had made sure that Sherlock was as comfortable as possible. He might not have wanted an Omega but now that he had the frightened boy at home, he would care for him. His medical self wouldn’t let anything else be good enough.
“Johnny” Molly squeaked suddenly, clamping one hand over her mouth as if talking too loud was now outlawed “And you didn’t tell me?! Where did you meet him? How was he? How is it to look into his eyes?”
"Should we try out my powers of conviction then?" John offered, pulling Sherlock in closer so that their faces were again just centimetres apart.
"Don't you recognise that it would be advantageous for me to know more in this instance?" Sherlock asked incredulously. "Besides, how do you know that they haven’t also tricked one of your henchmen into giving them details? Apparently they has them under better control than you."
“Do keep up. I spend the week researching every possible thing there is about sex and then decided based on probability what you’d most like wanted to do or expected of one of your partners. Since your last male on male encounter lies far back in your past and you’ve made a point of only dating women for the past two decades of your life, I expect you’d like to ‘top’.”, Sherlock fired off, “Which means I as well took the necessary precautions and consistently prepared myself. I have to say I don’t particularly like it, but I don’t care. If this is how it’s going to work, I have no problem. Although, I don’t trust these internet forums an awful lot, they do say that either way nothing compares to ‘the real ting’. Whatever that means.”
The devil snapped his fingers and held out his hand. A pale, ghostly thing appeared in the palm of it. It didn't take on a solid shape or form, it just seemed to be without definition.
"You're the devil, I'm sure you can do something so scary everyone will fall back in line easily." Sherlock waved away his concern. It was a ridiculous mess but here he was in his flat and the devil was preparing him tea. It normalised their situation to the extend where Sherlock didn't know if he was comfortable with it. After all, they still had an askew power differential going on.
"Which one?" Sherlock asked, proceeding to cut through the optic nerve of the dead mouse on the kitchen table.
"It's not like I have an almighty being in my flat who could get rid of this." Sherlock huffed, pointing at his leg in annoyance.
“Sherlock, come on sit up.”, John coaxed, knowing that the boy would have to be manipulated into any position by now. “You just need to take one small pill and a bit of water.” It took him two tries to get the lithe body upright and the birth control down the other’s throat. “Good job”, he hummed and just in time realised the other was squirming closer, “No, not going to happen, boy.”
There was nothing for it. Sherlock had to get through the night, hopefully allowing his body enough rest to start his new case in the morning. For the first time his explicit goal wasn't to catch a criminal but to get his soul back.
“You really are as terrible as they all say, in some aspects, aren’t you?” John sighed, he was too bloody tired for this game, “I did something someone else should have done long ago, preferably your parents. I don’t care if you are an uncivilised arsehole unless you let it out on others. So you know where the door is, go and be a nuisance somewhere else.” John gestured towards the door with one hand and turned around to unpack a few of his books.  There were about a million things he needed to do and he wasn’t inclined to waste anymore brain power on the lanky student than absolutely necessary to get him outside.
Sherlock sat in the darkness of his flat for the rest of the night.  He would live but he had sold his soul for it. A cold shiver ran down his spine. He never wanted to die less.
"You know I can't do that." John sighed and went to make tea. At least that way they would have to discuss this topic long distance and John wouldn't need to be faced with Sherlock in pain. Seeing Sherlock flinch with every move, had put quite a considerable dent in John's reserve.
"Okay, I'll give you everything you need for opening the case without overlooking a victim. Well, at least without overlooking one I know about. Once you have it figured out to a point where you would need results of investigative work, we can talk through it again. I don't think you can do anything wrong with investigating the murders on their own because I doubt you will get close enough to him for it to matter. Perhaps that is even a good bit of decoy." Sherlock hummed, thrumming his fingers together in front of his chin "But when we're ready to catch him, you have to promise that I do it. I have to catch him."
"Because you feel guilty about it." John pointed out "I can't say why, perhaps it's a social indoctrination but you still feel like it. If you stop feeling guilty about it, it will disappear from the list. Life is about learning and mostly learning to let go. Most old people are marvellous at it. It usually is a joy to work with someone who feels like they have had a good turn alive."
"How do you mean that?" John asked suddenly very interested, he really wanted to get to one of Sherlock's closely guarded theories.
"Because it's spacious and I won't limit access to the wall." Sherlock rolled his eyes and held out another scrap, "Background four, victim two, theory 3" John took it without question, climbed on the couch and pinned the piece near the second victim's picture. Then he returned to hunting down that string.
“Why would I want to do that? I mean have a coffee”, Sherlock asked when he had shaken himself out of his surprise.
"Plenty but it's not really my choice. It's a family business, so to speak, and you just have to go along." John chuckled just noticing how preposterous it all sounded when spoken aloud.
In the end, Sherlock grudgedly took one slice of toast from the plate and began chewing it. John counted it as a success.
A small smile hushed over Sherlock's lips. That was all he needed. Time was still something he could bargain for but he had his way in. "I'll see you then, detective." He smirked and turned around ready to leave the office.
"Or he simply didn't do more than ask around which isn't normally something we worry about because then we wouldn't be able to do anything but follow up on all those people." John shrugged.
"You're right. Whatever has been declared or perceived as holy in whatever religion or cult humans have come up with can be used against a daemon." John said, searching for a way to explain his dilemma more clearly, "It's the firm belief in the items powers that robs us of ours. They are still somewhat effective when used by someone who doesn't believe in them but I could still do enough harm to those."
“Sherlock, really”, John closed his eyes for a moment to stay on top of himself, “I can control myself to a certain extend.”
John perked up at that announcement. What could Anna possibly have planned that needed the future husband to allow it to happen? After all this wasn’t a usual stag night with skimpy dancers, or was it really the direction they wanted to go in? Were there even good male dancers? John just assumed it would have to be a male stripper because Sarah did not seem the type for liking women, too.
"What?" John asked, inserting himself into the conversation, "Sherlock's organising case notes on your serial killer."
His restlessness seemed to have shown a bit. The devil collected himself a bit and in an attempt to probably intimidate Sherlock, he said, "It is a matter of great importance. I hope you are aware of that at all times."
“Yes, but this should’ve been a relaxing walk through the city, Sherlock. I did not plan on running for my life when I left the house"
"Don't be daft. This was Moriarty and I would only order body parts, not the whole thing, and obviously they would have to be properly refrigerated." Sherlock shrugged.
"Oh, now you're telling me there are also boundaries to life as a daemon you never thought to mention before? My, my how can I even trust a thing you say?" Sherlock put his hands under his chin, gently thrumming his fingertips together. He had the devil all worked up, now he just needed to figure out what would happen if he crossed the line.
"Yes, yes your little minions have made that point clear time and time again. It's my soul against whatever I ask for." Sherlock waved his hand dismissively at the devil. His mind was still racing with the data it just had been fed. It was interesting, oh so interesting. Why wasn't the devil like anything one ever heard of or even anything close to his daemons. Sherlock knew it wasn't important now but he couldn't help wondering. He only heard the other speak as background noise.
"Mrs. Hudson this is… John Watson", Sherlock introduced the devil, stepping a bit to the side to give her a better view, "He will be sharing the flat with me for his stay in London." He had pointedly ignored the glare received when saying the name 'John Watson'. What had struck Sherlock about the devil from the beginning were his utterly ordinary looks. It was all so plain and normal that he needed a boring, everyday name to suit the exterior. 'John' had almost immediately popped into Sherlock's mind and after trying it out a few times it felt right on his tongue. He would be living with John and solving a case for him. Yes, that sounded a lot less ominous than: My flatmate the devil.
"This whole thing" Lestrade waved his hand about the room, "I can't just have the two of you running around and then expect us to just be able to take him into custody."
"You got that from looking at her for not even a minute?" John asked surprised. Within the year, they had been dealing with this problem, they hadn't gotten past the point of 'Somehow manipulated to sell their souls for someone else’s gain and then don't remember it’.
"To find out what people feel guilty about? Sure" John smirked "Hoping to figure out why that man was chosen then?"
“Come on, give me a bit more to work with” Sherlock grinned, his hand suddenly pressing against John’s hard cock under the layers of clothes. John moaned loudly and threw his head back. “There we are”, Sherlock growled triumphantly, pulling a string of moans from John as he continued to massage the other’s cock. “God, I could keep you here forever and you wouldn’t do a thing”
For a while there was no sounds except their heavy breathing. They were still seated on the kitchen chair and slowly John felt his legs growing numb from being pressed against the hard wood by Sherlock’s weight. But as reality kicked in again, John feared one move would destroy everything and he wasn’t ready for that yet. So, he banished the discomfort from his mind until Sherlock broke the silence.
The Omega hid his face in John’s neck, the touch amplifying his arousal but with his nose so close to the doctor’s alpha smell, the action wasn’t doing much to bring him down again. Instead he greedily let his system be flooded with the other’s pheromones, voice reduced a mewling whimper as a hand wrapped completely around his cock. Never would he have imagined the feeling being so glorious. He was sitting on John’s lap and he knew that by now he must have soaked his trousers but he couldn’t care because every time he seemed to get a grip on at least the edge of a thought, John worked some clever mischief and he fell down the hole again.
“Please, don’t leave me again.”, Sherlock whined, not only was his heat coming on stronger now that the Alpha’s smell was so near but he also got desperate. It was obvious that his plan wasn’t working and he knew that if John left the room now, he wouldn’t get another chance. “Please, not after last night. Don’t make me go through this alone again.”
"You still imagine it being a place? It's not..., it's not a second planet existing apart from yours. Hell is not a place you go to, sit in a room and then leave. It's everywhere. I'm usually everywhere."
"Really, that's what you're going for? I never had to prove to anyone that I actually am who I am. This world is just getting stranger and stranger" the man grumbled annoyed but more to himself, "Well, if it means I can get back quicker. Here you go. Hell, I feel like a circus clown."
"I believe that should cover the cost of your question nicely" John whispered, gently ending the kiss to speak. "I used to be the main deal maker but humans quickly filled up my realm and I do hate eternal house guests who don't work. I simply delegated tasks and with the growing population it was for the better. Over time it simply grew bigger and bigger so that like any good CEO I suddenly found myself with a lot of free time. I don't make deals anymore because I simply don't have to. Whenever I come to earth it's because I got bored or because there is trouble like at the moment."
"I chose the case and you tell me whatever you remember?" John suggested with a soft smile. He really was interested in what Sherlock had been doing the past years. After all, he had risked a few snooping looks now and then, always telling himself that is was just to make sure Sherlock kept to the contract. It really had been because he had been stumped by the other's directness. In all his time, people rarely intrigued him but Sherlock had drawn him in without even trying. At first, John hadn't even noticed he was working towards having Sherlock open up more and more. Now, he really enjoyed the closeness between them, although it left a slight bittersweet taste. After all, he was the devil, this was just doomed.
"What are you doing here?" Sherlock looked up at the Inspector, making it clear that he hadn't been expecting company.
The landlady sighed "These cases will be the death of him at some point. Either he'll stress out so much that he'll drop dead or one of those criminals will get him."
"I only do what they ask for" Sherlock hummed and brushed past Lestrade into the flat. It practically screamed 'up to rent' at him. Nothing had been left out which made the dead body in the middle of the living room a little more strange. Usually, he had at least some clues from the environment to go off of. This was again just the corpse. Slowly, it was getting annoying. Couldn't their culprit take at least one misstep? He hadn't even answered to Sherlock's text after the last one. By now, Sherlock was fed up with finding out who did this. Perhaps he just needed to take a different approaches on this one.
Sherlock just shot him an annoyed look. He was poutier than usual because he didn't like to be lectured. Yes, it had been dangerous, but he also had a lot on the line which he couldn't tell Lestrade.
"Bedroom and I'll show you?" Sherlock teased John by wriggling a bit in his lap but before he could quite comprehend what was happening, John had already pulled him up and they were half way to the bed. The last thought Sherlock had before they hit the bed and his brain went blissfully offline for a while was that he should make it is new hobby to get rid of everything he felt guilty about because hell wasn't a place for him. It seemed to repetitive. He would probably get bored by his punishment.
"That and future ones. It would be illogical to sell my soul for the solution to one crime. Like I said, I want my normal life expectancy back", Sherlock said clearly. He was rocking back and forth on his feet now. He wasn't used to having to justify himself in front of anyone.
"Oi, freak. What are you doing here? There is not a case I'm aware of." Sally Donovan caught Sherlock by the arm just as he wanted to brush past her, on a direct line towards Lestrade's office.
“Mrs. Hudson, you of all people should know it’s never save.” Sherlock reminded her, striding up the stairs to his flat. “I would really appreciate tea.”
“Great so you are telling me that for no good reason at all you broke into my room?” John rubbed his hand over his eyes, this was definitely too much for the day he had had. Why couldn’t these things wait until he had a day that didn’t leave him exhausted to the bones?
“Just the birth control and then come back.”, Sherlock hummed already moving to stand and get out of his clothes. He was determined not to spend this heat alone, too. Their meeting definitely hadn’t been the most favourable but over the past two months the doctor had shown more interest and affection than anyone else in Sherlock’s life. He was sure that there didn’t exist any other person he could stand to live with. He wanted John. Just the thought of having to use inadequate dildos again, made him clench his yaw. He had made his mind up, he wanted everything. Now he just had to overpower the strong morals the doctor cherished.
Sally looked him up and down, as if he was sizing John up and judging his words on possible truth, "Well, a word of warning then: Keep away from him."
Perhaps the poor state of his mental faculties could be made responsible for not having noticed Sherlock moving closer. John felt like one moment the other had stood a safe distance away and with the snap of a finger, he was looming over him, both hands pressed against the back of the chair. For a moment John actually stopped breathing. When Sherlock pushed himself off smoothly for a ridiculously sexy and fast turn which lead to some kind of move that brought him quite near the ground and up again, showing off that plush arse just a bit too clearly, John actually gripped the seat of the chair. He realized how hard the ‘no touching’ rule would be to honour, especially since Sherlock didn’t seem to be in a hurry to move away. More than that, John actually had to swallow hard when another dip in the tempo of the music occurred and Sherlock apparently threw all caution to the wind, starting to writhe hard on John’s lap.
John looked at him with a disbelieving smile "Did you just make a joke? Oh god, you really just tried to make a joke." John couldn't help but giggle a bit. Sherlock was funny, yes but mostly without him trying to be. Usually, the absurdness of the circumstances or a comment he made were the baseline to any humorous situation. John was sure this was the first deliberate attempt Sherlock had made in a long time. "Come on, I need a little more detail. I'm sure you can run me through your process again."
“Sherlock”, John’s voice was a bit sterner which made the younger boy fall silent immediately and the doctor stroked a hand over the other’s leg soothingly, “It’s fine. You’ve been brilliant. Not everyone is as observant as you are.” There was a small grumbled coming from the bundle of dark haired Omega which John only answered with a smirk, “Come on. What would they have you for if they solved everything themselves? Someone has to give you a chance to show of your genius.”
"Who of us was useless enough to pump himself full of drugs?" John was aware that his blows were getting low. This case though had cost him too much time and too many nerves already.
“Well, by the looks of it, apparently yes.” John shrugged, suddenly remembering his only meeting with the student, “Why are they behaving as if he had leprosy? He won’t kill you if you come near.”
John chuckled and shook his head. It was a very far flung idea but since he put Sherlock on the case, the other had taken the strands and weaved them to a coherent whole further than anyone. It had taken him a week to get closer to an answer than anyone before. John looked at how animated Sherlock spoke to the DI and wondered if it was always like this. Sherlock swooping in like an unearthly hero and using the most minimalists clues to solve whatever problem you put in front of him. John was glad that all these years back, he had taken the call. It had just been to get out a bit and have a laugh. Turned out he met someone with an incredibly rare talent and the determination to stand up to him. Perhaps this case wouldn't just be annoying. Seeing Sherlock work might be the most fun he had had in eons. Now he wanted to see if the little vermin who had been bugging him would have just as much fun. He was the devil, he was allowed to be petty and vengeful.
Keeping his steps even, John went to his bedroom door and tried the handle. It was locked. He starred at it confused, he never locked any of the doors inside his flat. The key was lying unsuspiciously next to the door and the doctor quickly turned it in the lock.
John laughed softly, "You are way too serious about your work. I'm sure your blog would be a lot more popular if you told them more as stories."
John grinned in between bites of food “You want to catch the baddies then? How ambitious, never thought of you as the crime fighting sort”
Sherlock shook himself back out of his frozen state and put the sugar in his tea. His mother had always said his teeth would rot because of all the sugar he needed. The thought about his mother made him flinch momentarily before he pushed it down and headed back to the lounge. With a swift observation he decided to take the black leather armchair across from the Alpha. There wouldn’t be much space to pin him down on like on the couch and the way to the window was shorter. Carefully he folded his legs underneath himself, settling in with his mug of tea steaming and warming his hands.
“Well, then go for the Mister himself, he seems interested enough” Toby nodded his head slightly into the direction where the dark figure had sprawled on a chair, taking up a whole group table with books and note sheets. Not only the distributed possessions but also the well-fitting air of ennui and danger surrounding him played into his cards. No one seemed to dare to get closer.
"No, don't say that." Mrs. Hudson gently punched his side "He was half-dead before you moved in. He's still a bit of a mess but he's getting there, believe me."
"You have the once in a lifetime opportunity to get into the good books" John answered, lightly crossing his arms in front of his chest to emulate a more comfortable pose for a human.
“It wasn’t even close to this” John growled, his fingers battling with the closures to Sherlock’s trousers. It might look good but it was ridiculously complicated to get it out of the way.
John chuckled, burring both of his hands in the luscious, dark curls. It was really quite hard for him to hold back. He had fallen head over heels for the enigmatic character that was the young Omega. His thoughts might have been a bit obvious on his face as Sherlock gently cleared his throat, making the doctor look down. The big eyes which were staring back at him made him realise his mistake and he already wanted to pull his hands from the other’s head to give him the possibility of escape but a shy, “No, I like it.”, let him continue.
Sherlock rolled his eyes again but leaned over to press his lips a bit more forcefully to John's. This time he couldn't escape quickly because John was prepared and caught him, lengthening the kiss quite a considerable bit more than Sherlock had planned on. He found that he didn't mind.
"Too late, you signed the contract and you know what will happen if you back out." Sherlock felt the mad glimmer in his eyes. This fight just showed how desperate the devil was. Sherlock had just spectacularly lost every little piece of decorum and he was still alive. He had the upper hand. It wasn't fun at the moment but he had the devil in a corner. He should never have gotten so attached to having the devil there as a companion instead of a boss. He needed to solve this case and he need to do it his way. The stakes were too high.
John couldn't say that he wasn't impressed. He had stood there in the office of a high ranking police officer, very much the unknown intruder. For all it was worth he had been the centre of attention for 20 seconds at most. Sherlock really seemed to have a heavy hand in the success of this unit. Although that couldn't be the only reason the DI was so lenient with the other. John sensed that even if Sherlock insulted his way through his life, he had unwillingly and maybe unknowingly found a friend in what should be his boss. It was somewhat sweet and John wondered how long it would take until Sherlock got the files. There was no doubt he would get them and just that little security made John be optimistic about this endeavour.
"I'll see if we find him, go and check on Mrs. Hudson. That poor lady must have had the fright of her life" Lestrade decided and pushed Sherlock into the direction of Mrs. Hudson's flat, although the other was clearly starting to protest, "Sherlock, get out of my way. You had your time, now play at the side line for a moment. I'll tell you when I know more."
John shrugged “I accidently climbed through the window into his flat because I miscounted and thought it was Mike’s. Nothing big, it was the middle of the night and he was handling some dangerous acid in his pyjamas.”
"Nothing of interest, yet." Sherlock said and looked at Lestrade "Male victim, late forties, office worker I would wager a guess at insurance company, dead for at least a few hours already. Mrs. Hudson found him as he fell through our front door."
“It better be bloody good because otherwise I will give you a thorough kick in the arse on your way out. No scratch that I’m going to do that either way” he huffed and leaned against his desk, arms crossed in front of his chest, “Go on tell me your reason and then get out of my life”
"Wow" the devil looked at him with something akin to wonder in his gaze, "You really are good at this, aren't you?"
"Don't patronise me" John sighed and put the kettle on. Somehow he had filled that particular spot in Sherlock's life, making tea constantly. If anyone got wind of that, he would have to work really hard to get his reputation back up to speed. "Have you had any breakfast?"
“God, you are beautiful”, the doctor smiled and tugged Sherlock back into a kiss. His hands were rooted firmly to Sherlock’s waist. Their lips fitted together perfectly, John’s face angled slightly upwards to make up the height difference between them. Sherlock moaned into John’s mouth, pressing closer to the other’s body.
"Prove it", Sherlock quickly stepped back and threw a hard, calculating gaze at the other, "I'm not telling you anything until you prove who you are."
"What exactly?" John asked, having sat down in one of the armchairs well away from the DI after finishing the bandage around Sherlock's leg.
Sherlock looked him straight in the eyes, “I’ve been dancing for years. Everyone is dull and predictable. Within half a minute there is nothing new about them. Yet here you are. You should have been so ordinary, so easy to please.”
Before John could react with anything more than a surprised expression, the other had turned around and was walking towards his own door.
"I don't know, perhaps he thinks you're greedy for some reason" John chuckled "Although he really shouldn't be the one complaining, he's already running more than half of London's underground criminals."
"I can't fulfil the contract" Sherlock said crestfallen. He couldn't see a way out of his situation. Of course, he had done and would do all the needed work to catch Moriarty but he wouldn't be able to do so himself. He was effectively bound to sitting down and watch others do the work.
Sherlock had devilish, no pun intended, fun in creating a cover story. He knew that he needed to make it as believable as possible in order for no one to suspect what was really going on. Explaining the real nature of his new 'friend' wasn't something he was keen on doing and he suspected the sentiment was shared by the devil. Plus, he finally wanted another name referring to the other than 'the devil'. It made his thoughts always a lot more sinister than they should be. He had a case to concentrate on, or at least the beginnings of one, and there he couldn't use dramatic distractions.
"Well, they always seem like they came straight to punish me and last I heard that was your job." Sherlock shrugged.
“I don’t know. I hadn’t thought of that. I just wanted to make sure I wouldn’t be bothering you further.”, he confessed, nervously rubbing his thumb over his forefinger.
"I might be open for that" Sherlock murmured and anew John felt him letting go of any resistance. It was a heady experience having such a controlled and logical human being discarding every principle he held, even if it was just for a moment. John took a deep breath and then they were kissing once more. It wasn't quite as restrained as the first kiss when John had been sure he would have to engage in some damage control afterwards. This was a lot more enthusiastic from both sides and John realised he would have no problem taking this further. Although he was still hyper aware of the sore parts on Sherlock's body, he gently began to let his hands grab hold of the detective. After all there wasn't a wound to Sherlock's torso so one hand deftly slipped under a well-worn old T-Shirt to explore the soft skin underneath. It came almost as a shock to the system when Sherlock gave a strangled whimper at the simple contact of hand to skin.
"More often than you think." John sighed "Somehow people think they can hide or use some form of religious exorcism to get their lives back. The soul is energy though and all we do is leave you energy for a predetermined amount of time, well then you will die after that set amount of time because you simply have no energy left to go on."
He was nearly assaulted by the Omega as soon as he stepped into the room. Sherlock had been waiting by the door, having taken off all his clothes already. “Thank you”, he drawled and plucked the pill from John’s hand, swallowing it dry, making sure to expose the long arch of his neck. He was aware that he was pulling all registers but his experience of the Alpha made this show necessary.
"Lestrade, when was the last time I saw a connection where none was?" Sherlock asked, hands now pressed to the top of the detective’s desk. He needed the other to believe him. "I don't always see everything but I never see something where there is nothing."
Sherlock rolled his eyes and chuckled, “It’s not what I meant. I thought I could prove my point within three minutes and be done. But now I find there is so much I still haven’t figured out.”
"Well, it's how it is. I can't go around and willy nilly make things happen." John hummed, "What kind of world would we live in if that were possible?"
It took Sherlock half an hour of thinking before he dared to put his pen to the parchment. He had never in his life exerted so much concentration on the writing of a document as he was now. In fairness, no other document had ever held the chance to change something irreversible into nothingness. Sherlock felt the added weight on his shoulders. It didn't help that the devil was still sitting just a few feet away from him, very clearly observing every minuscule move he made.
"Oh but it is" Sherlock hummed and started pacing up and down the living room, limping slightly as his leg was protesting with every step "If his deals concerned getting London's underworld under his thumb, he'll be slowly taking over all the little and large illegal dealings happening in this city, and imagine how easy it will be to spread out when you have London conquered. I don't know why that man had to die specifically but I might know what Moriarty wants." Sherlock suddenly stopped and grinned. Of course, it was easy, John didn’t even need to tell him what the deals were about exactly. He had the general idea and it was enough, Moriarty was a fanatic with just one goal. He was punishing people and Sherlock knew where every self-respecting criminal would make a move to announce their claim to power.
“That’s good. Come on, we need to get you into a bed.”, John said calmly, his arms worming around the thin body and pulling it up into his arms. Sherlock wanted to protest at being carried but he felt the low ache in his abdomen and the moisture already soaking through his pyjamas, making him reconsider his protest. Without further ado he found himself back on the bed but this time the sheets didn’t cause him to panic.
Sherlock's mouth, open to defend his story, snapped shut in confusion. There were always things you weren't expecting. To shake off his stun Sherlock quickly changed the topic, "We should get going. There might have been cases on some of your victims. Can you name the time of death of as many as possible?"
It took a moment before John unclenched his fist, resigning himself to the truth of Sherlock's words. "Go on then, who am I supposed to be?"
The ride to New Scotland Yard was quiet. Sherlock was looking out the window on his side of the cab, John on the other. The view of London's busy streets rushing past helped Sherlock to think. He needed to figure out why he suddenly had been so taken aback when John had complimented him earlier. At least, Sherlock had taken it as a compliment. John's reaction hadn't been the norm. Usually, when Sherlock implicitly insulted his way through an explanation he got a hearty 'piss off' not a 'brilliant'. Of course John needed him to solve this case but that didn't mean he had to be nice. The devil's behaviour confused Sherlock more than the case if he was honest. The case had two very distinct directions it would move in. Either they found some victims at NYS to open up the first clues or there inevitably would be the next victim to give him just that. A new victim would also mean a fresh crime scene and so much more data than any police report could cover. It was indecent but Sherlock was chasing a criminal on the payroll of the devil, he felt like nothing would be too indecent with this case.
“Hello?”, he said softly, his hand on the door handle but still keeping the door shut, “I’m coming in. I just wanted to warn you.”
"No" the devil sighed and shook his head, "We tried everything else already. If you manage to solve my case, you've earned it."
"I already said, I can do so better without being slowed down." the stress lay on the word 'better' and John thought he started to catch on to the real reasons here. Sherlock probably had laid out his own reasons, which didn't mean they were actually good ones. Nevertheless, John needed Sherlock and he needed him alive. "Come off it. Denying your brain sustenance does nothing but kill you."
"Yes, yes" she waved of what would have developed into a monologue about deduction and the fine art of logic, "But you know, most of us aren't that adept."
"If you organise the seize, I will even do that" Sherlock hoped that at last Lestrade would give in completely.
Sherlock nodded, the answer made sense and with all he had already accepted about 'hell' this didn't seem too far of a stretch. When he tried to think of the next question though, he found that his mind was increasingly uninterested in the game. He had already felt a bit annoyed when John had stopped kissing him to answer. Now he found himself gazing more at John's lips with no words forming coherent sentences in his mind than anything else.
"Only lies have details. You don't need to know more to get the general gist of how you should be behaving. An ex-army man can explain trust issues and temper, doctor would make you helpful on the case and as a job title stands a chance of you finding employment in the city. I don't have friends, so you are the friend of someone I trust enough to let their friend stay in my flat. It really, was extraordinary simple."
With a smile that said ‘see, works well like this, doesn’t it?’ John turned to the counter and ordered their drinks before walking towards a quiet corner to pull out a chair. “Sit down and then we can talk about this”
John chuckled and settled a slight distance away from Sherlock on the couch, "It depends on the nature of the deal I suppose. Souls are just a very high source of energy. Most people have some pretty major issues we should sort out, which in turn means we need a lot of energy. Sure, if you just wanted us to bring you a pizza a year of your life or so should be enough. But you guys invented delivery service so that's not really part of our portfolio anymore."
With a lot of patience John left Sherlock some time to explore unhindered before he brought one hand up to trail down the Omega’s back and towards his arse. He spent some time just drawing lazy circles at the top of Sherlock’s tailbone, always just brushing the crack with his fingers until he felt the other’s body twitching underneath his hand. A surprised gasp made him push two fingers down the crack towards Sherlock’s hole, where he could already feel the slickness spreading. Carefully he pushed forward, his fingers just dipping a fraction into the, from heat and arousal loosed, ring of muscles. Sherlock whined and pressed his arse up and back into John’s hand making the fingers glide in a bit further while he was panting hot breaths onto John’s chest.
The devil looked at him and asked with a calm voice, "What is it that you desire so much that, after all this time, you want to strike a bargain?"
Sherlock shook his head and gnawed slightly on his lip as he turned to look out of the window, "No, just thinking."
"Because he was too calm for being without backup. He knew exactly who you were and what we were out to do. Still, he happily invited us to follow him. No one who is playing a game like this would act in this fashion without knowing there was backup. I'm just surprised you didn't even try to go after him. It would have been good to know if he relies solely on the cross to keep him save." Sherlock mused, adjusting his position to make it more comfortable now that they both had gotten used to the physical contact.
“Well, I can’t say you didn’t manage to please me.” John interjected. Actually, the thought back at what they had just done, still made his head turn.
For a fact, Sherlock had never let anyone in his room since he had presented as an Omega. No one was allowed to upset the calming and familiar balance of smells he had achieved. Therefor this was definitely not his room. His eyes flew from one wall to the next, quickly assessing the contents of the strange surroundings Chest of drawers, wardrobe, bedside table, full length mirror, a small sideboard holding an iPod docking station and a few memorabilia he wasn’t really looking at. His hands started to clench in panic. Due to his meticulous schedule keeping he was aware that his heat was about to set on within the next 24 hours. With trembling legs he got up from the bed, realising that he was only clad in a thin dressing gown. His mind came crashing down with the most likely reason for his situation.
“I… I…”, Sherlock was gasping, not able to hold on to a single thought for longer than a fraction of a second, “John…”
EDIT: If you are interested: the_elusive_plot has pointed out to me that they have written a story with a similar plot (http://archiveofourown.org/works/2683154). So if you like the general idea, definitely head over there and check their work out :)
"Yes, because now you've seen it but it’s not like he sent it to you on a silver tray with a little tag of 'fuck you' attached."
Angrily he hung up and tossed his phone into some corner. No one was served with his extreme reaction at the moment. There was nothing he could do now that the Omega was in his flat and so shortly before his heat. Besides he needed to talk to the boy first before anything else was to happen. A deep breath calmed him down enough to take the suitcase and bring it into the small hallway.
"Well, it wasn't really a satisfying kiss so if you want a better answer put some work into it next time."
Sherlock pressed his index finger against John’s still clothed chest. “You”, he began and let his finger circle over one pectoral muscle before drawing up over John’s neck towards his lips. The softness in his gaze kept John from pushing him away.  “How did you do this?” To John’s amazement there was no mockery in Sherlock’s voice. It seemed as if he honestly was looking for an answer.
"I'm sorry, can we just?" Sherlock pointed at the house behind the detective, slightly confused but certain something had just gone over his head.
“Oh god”, John moaned thinking about what kind of research Sherlock had probably conducted over the past days. Well, only the detective could call it research, everyone else would refer to it as ‘watching porn and wanking’. The doctor smiled and let go enough for Sherlock to surge forward and push their lips back together. It was amazing, now that he allowed himself to enjoy it. Sherlock’s lips were plush and soft and the other tackled kissing with the same ruthless focus as he spared for everything else. That and his lap full of writhing Consulting Detective managed to pull deep moans form him fairly quickly. He would have been embarrassed any other time but this was Sherlock and it was like suddenly being allowed to wallow in luxury.
She put her tray on the table and hugged him tightly before pulling out a chair for herself to sit down. “Well, yeah whatever you call fun but you know how it is, you try to cram in as much work as possible” she chuckled. Molly was a bit younger than him and he had gotten to know her through a seminar he had done for a teacher in the younger years to earn a bit of money during the term. She had been one of the only people who were genuinely glad about some extra help and the possibility to ask questions. Most students hated these courses because they thought of them as extra time they had to spend in the University building but John couldn’t help that. In the end he had become friends with Molly and he actually liked her shy and sometimes flustered behaviour. Her brutal honesty though was something he value most.
“If he wanted to do that, you’d already be gone” Molly smiled cheerfully “So chin up and be a pretty boy.”
The devil raised an eyebrow in surprise, "What is it you do that suddenly reversed your outlook on life? I've been told you are a hopeless case, hell bend on self-destruction."
John pulled away when he was content with the mark he had left, moving his hands to undo the buttons on his shirt.
Lestrade contemplated the words for a moment before he put down the file he was holding, "Okay, you won. I'll indulge you but only because of the Peterson case that was bloody brilliant. Next victim like this turns up, I'll give you a call but I won't hold it open indefinitely."
“Well, for not wanting to bore me you are taking up a lot of time I could be using on my experiment, John”, the taller student said, looking down at John with one eyebrow perfectly arched upwards and the name drawn out with a smirk. It was the first time John actually took in the appearance before him. Obviously there were hushed descriptions running over the campus along with the various tales of what the Holmes boy seemingly got up to, aside from being a bloody brilliant student. Unlike other people in his year he had never felt the need to find out who was behind all the stories that were told behind closed doors, because no one dared to talk out loud, fearing some unknown wrath. So far, John thought Sherlock wasn’t so much different from the other students. Cotton T-Shirt hanging loosely off his shoulders, barefoot and in pyjama pants the other didn’t seem too frightening. John decided the rest of the student corps was being a bit dramatic and there was nothing dangerous about the infamous Sherlock Holmes, well perhaps with the exception of what was standing on the desk, labelled ‘Perchloric acid’.
"I'm not going to, you are" Sherlock stated matter of factly, "But for that I still cannot use the couch as you would have to step over me otherwise and that's something I most definitely won't allow."
John hummed and started reading. He quickly was surprised at the report he had picked up. The file described a quite vicious murder. Then it went into detail about how it was solved. John was doubtless Sherlock hadn't written it. For that it was too descriptive, not at all in the style the detective wrote his blog in. Still, John couldn't help but marvel at the reasoning process described. It appeared all so easy and obvious when laid out that way. Nevertheless, he was certain that presented with the same evidence, he wouldn't have managed anything close to Sherlock's feat without cheating a bit.
