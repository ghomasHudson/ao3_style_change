Sam always stands when he comes in. Always the exact same spot, two steps into the room and to the right of the door. Always tense, arms crossed behind is back. He doesn’t tremble, there is no evidence of crying but the spark from his eyes is gone and after exactly five minutes he leaves. Not that you counted.
Bruce asks questions but you don’t answer, just nod or shake your head when necessary and the one time you make the mistake to look him in the eyes you see the same despair you saw in Natasha’s only a day ago.
The three of you go to this little coffee shop a few streets down from the tower because they have the best coffee and the cake is just delicious. Before you head back you buy a slice of strawberry cheesecake for Tony and some of the cake pops that Steve loves so much.
But it’s not your room and you are not alone. A woman is cowering in the corner, her sobs filling the silence. Your gun is trained on a man who sits tied to a chair and he just stares at you without any emotions while his wife pleads for his life with high pitched screams and pleas. You shot her instead and finally it’s silent again.
Sometimes he looks at you with these big brown eyes and you just want to pull him close and kiss him. But then you think about how far you have come from him hating you and you don’t want to risk this friendship and so you don’t.
Then Zemo sets your alter ego free again and you are trapped inside your mind for the hundredth time while your body wracks havoc and tries to kill people that you have no interest in killing. It’s no use, though. In the end the Captain really saves you and slowly you regain control.
Ms Fields is back three days later but you don’t talk to her as well. She talks for nearly an hour and makes you sign a stack of papers. You don’t really listen and what penetrates your mental barrier doesn’t sound too reassuring anyway. What you understand though is that you’ll probably never be a free man again.
“You are alive.” It comes out raspy because you haven’t talked in over two months and tears are still spilling down your face and Tony’s head snaps up sharply.
Rogers shuts up after that and he looks like someone slapped him hard across the face and Stark almost laughs, almost.
You end up in Wakanda with the guy who tried to kill you but who is now, kind of, your friend and really, who saw that coming.
“No, you are very much alive. But I don’t think it’s a good idea to go in there right now, Tony. Listen to them.” And that’s Steve, pleading with Tony.
The biggest surprise is when T’Challa shows up one day. You are asleep but he is there when you wake up, posture much like Sam’s but he stands directly in front of the glass walls. He considers you for a moment before speaking.
“We are not sure. You showed up here shortly after the explosion and you were really angry but calm and no one noticed at first because it was really chaotic. And then you barged right into the flames before anyone could stop you. Ten minutes later you dragged out Tony and then Nat noticed you weren’t completely you but you had already taken off again, chasing the two guys who caused this.”
You still train with Steve every other day and sometimes you spar with Natasha because she keeps you on your feet. You go to the shooting range with Clint and sometimes, when it’s too loud in your head, you meditate with Bruce. It really helps to calm you down.
“Well, I take it you know that I don’t really hate you anymore. I mean, I testified for you, of course you know. Anyway, that’s not why you are here. You probably don’t want to talk about that with me. Or, maybe you do? I shouldn’t just assume things about other people, Pep says that all the time. So what I was meaning to say is I could build you a new arm if you want that.”
You are alone when you hear the front door shatter and you go to inspect. Tony Stark is standing there with fire in his eyes which you can only see because he came without the armor. It’s a pretty stupid move because you could kill him right here, right now. And the Winter Soldier would, you know, because his shadow in your mind grows and you are barely able to push him away. You came here for a reason after all. And it’s not to kill Tony Stark.
“You just disappeared after a few days and then you moved out and I just thought you never wanted anything to do with me anymore. But I thought about coming here all the time I just was a coward.”
Even though people are talking to you again, nobody tells you what is happening outside. And you are too afraid to ask. The room and the containment chamber slowly become a fort. FRIDAY has taken full control of the tower, effectively throwing everyone out who has no business being there. Avengers come and go and they bring with them food supplies, water and medicine. Shortly after that Clint and Natasha drop in through the vents with a shitload of weapons and other military supply. Steve and Sam go out to grab mattresses from the deserted rooms and build a kind of blanket fort in the far end of the containment chamber. Ms Fields drops by occasionally and talks in hushed voices with Tony.
Slowly your surroundings take shape and you notice that someone is holding your arms behind your back and everything hurts. Natasha, Steve and Sam stand in a half circle in front of you. They look worried but ready to fight.
He stutters badly at the end and then just stops talking abruptly. You can see his whole face turning red and how he suddenly finds his hands really interesting and it strikes you that maybe you have been unfair to him as well. All the time you just were angry because he wanted to pressure you into being someone else. But he is just as lost in this world as you are. And you –
Tony’s face stays nearly passive but there is a small smile on his lips and by the end of the week you’ll probably have some new and advanced gimmicks and that’s really all you need to know.
“FRIDAY, open the chamber”, Tony commands but his voice is faltering and you notice how bad he still looks. His right arm is in a cast, the skin that is showing is red from various burns and he limps badly.
– is the only thing he has from a past that no one here remembers and of course Rogers had tried to hold onto that. And maybe you don’t remember most of it, but he is also the only thing that you have from the past.
The shot makes your ears ring and it hurts like a bitch but it’s just a flesh wound in your shoulder, the good one, and you are confused. The Soldier is roaring now, hammering against the confines you built in your mind and you have to squeeze your eyes shut to regain control.
The next night you learn about Rogers’ and Stark’s relationship. Clint doesn’t really tell you but you can still hear it loud and clear, between the lines. And the pile of things you destroyed grows every day.
“Well good. Because I might have promised the bots that you’ll be back when they ambushed me with their devastated little beeps. And Pepper told me I should stop making promises I can’t keep but they were beeping, like, really sad this time. But ever since I told them they are useless anyway because they just hang out by the lab doors and tackle everyone who dares take a step in there. And when they realise it’s not you, well. They’ll probably be so thrilled to have you back.”
“Well, that’s pretty easy to answer. He didn’t do it.” A low murmur fills the courtroom at this answer.
Footage from the battle is airing on all stations but after the FOX News helicopter had been shot down (no casualties, thank god) the other reporters were keeping their distance and what you could make out is vague at least. You have to think back to your conversations with Pepper about how she worries about Tony when he is out fighting and you get it but it’s even worth for you because there a two people on the battlefield who you care for deeply.
The loud voices carry through the door of your room and you can’t help but flinch. So Rogers finally caught up.
Of course he had been upset. Steve and Tony had been together before you came back from the dead and you are pretty sure that Tony still has feelings for Steve because after all the time that has passed he is still avoiding the man if you are not around. And you had been so focused on your own feelings for both men that you never thought about what would happen if you acted on any of those feelings. And now Steve has made the first step and your friendship with Tony is probably ruined.
You can’t help but gape at the man as he takes the stand but he doesn’t even glance in your direction.
“You don’t have to talk to me, you know. I was here and that is what Pepper requested so.” Tony fidgets with his newest Stark phone, avoiding your eyes.
– Tony gets it and he bodily shoves Steve out of the room where Natasha and Clint already wait, probably alerted by FRIDAY, to take him away.
“James, look. Whatever happened I’m sure there is a solution. I don’t know much, to be honest, but I do know that Steve kissed you and Tony is upset about it. I have no idea what is going on between you and Steve though and you don’t have to tell me. But I know that whatever happened with you and Tony, we can sort it out.”
“Honestly? No. I won’t say that I’ll never come back but right now I’m good where I am. And I’m not a member of the Avengers anyway so I really shouldn’t live in the Avengers Tower.” You chuckle and he scoffs.
You ask Sam and he agrees to let you stay in his house for a while and no one stops you when you move out of the tower with your single duffel bag. Sam stays in the tower most of the time so you have the place for yourself and sometimes Clint and Natasha come over to visit and it’s nice. For the first time you have a place to yourself and you never even knew that this was something you wanted. You go for long walks at night and you join a gym where people don’t ask too many questions and you gain a questionable reputation for how many weights you can lift without breaking a sweat.
“I was wrong, James. Not saying anything back then. I was just confused and I really needed to think about it. I’m not… Pepper said you think I’m disgusted by you but that’s not true. I could never be disgusted by you. I was surprised, yes. But not disgusted.”
“Well, I didn’t expect that.” Tony sounds taken aback but not angry and when you finally find the courage to look up at him he moves into the kitchen and sits down on one of the chairs.
The door to your room begins to open and you stand up quickly and wait in front of the thick glass walls. Rogers walks in first with Stark on his heels and his eyes widen almost comically as he sees you.
Tony’s reaction is more subdued. He just throws you a quick smile when you slide the plate on his workbench. Then he busies himself with his latest project and you leave him be. One hour later though he calls you down to the lab again and presents you with some reinforced nerf guns and you will certainly win your little war with Clint with them because, hello, they can shoot around a corner. And you know that’s Tony’s way to say thank you.
Clint is actually a great guy to run with. He is good at avoiding and he finds the best hiding spots. He has no qualms about tranquilizing innocent people who might get in your way and he knows when to talk and when to shut up. After three days of running though, you get the suspicion that he is communicating with someone else. You are tense for a day after that but whoever it might be, they are just helping and not interfering so you let it slide.
“Storming into my tower like you still have the right to do just that and then threatening me in my own home?” Stark’s voice rises with every word till he is flat out screaming.
You come to, to a mixture of voices yelling your name and you are confused for a second because you had been in Pepper’s office just a second ago. Then memories start to trickle in, the fight, the explosion. The darkness.
“So, you two made up already? Why am I here then?” You can see him shutting down immediately, eyes turning hard and his jaw sets.
But the only place where your head really shuts up is the lab. There is always something happening. Loud music is playing, Tony arguing passionately with his bots, lights everywhere. It’s just so fascinating and new and it makes your head spin in a good way. You start asking questions and Tony answers them and more often than not you don’t understand half of it but you start to learn and soon he lets you help. You are nowhere near his level but you are good enough and you can see that Tony is happy that someone is interested in his work.
For all of you who have been waiting, I'm sorry. I had more then I posted here but I kind of fell out of love with the story. I don't know. But I came back to it and I decided to upload it anyway and let you be the judge.
A steady stream of doctors and lawyers and psychologists find their way to you now every day and you answer a lot of questions that are mostly inappropriate but you answer anyway because you know the truth is important. Clint and Natasha come by occasionally. Stark never shows up.
“Ok Barnes”, he addresses you while he plops down on the couch next to you. “You probably want to know why you are here.”
He gestures awkwardly toward the communal kitchen and you just shrug and follow him there. You lean against the counter with your good arm wrapped around you and then there is silence for a while. Finally, Rogers looks at you.
Then she leaves again because she actually is a busy woman, running a company and all. You go to the gym and shopping afterwards and when you get back Sam, Natasha and Clint are all lounging in the living room.
“What we saw was the Winter Soldier killing my parents. He may have Barnes’ body but he isn’t the same person.” Stark looks down for a moment as if he is collecting himself. When he looks up again his eyes meet yours for a second, then he looks at the jury.
so it's been a while since I posted something and I'm very very sorry that it took so long but now I'm gonna treat you to an extra long chapter!
“Neither did I, to be honest.” You consider sitting down as well but you are far too nervous to sit still now and so you busy yourself with making hot chocolate.
The room is completely silent now and you can feel a lot of eyes on you but there is nothing to do or to say but you notice that for the first time in months the shadow in your mind is barely there and you can’t do anything about the tears spilling from your eyes. The picture makes the front page, right under a catchy headline.
“I’m not isolating myself. They are all welcome here and they visit me and we go out sometimes. I needed this, Pep. I really did. I’m independent and pay my own bills and I’m actually happy most of the time. I still love them, yes. And seeing that picture, it fucking hurt. But I have been gone from the tower for two months and neither Steve nor Tony have ever tried to get in contact. And I can take a hint. I’ll get over it eventually.”
After that, things happen so fast that you can barely keep up but at the end of it all you are one metallic arm shorter, Tony Stark hates you because apparently you killed his parents and you are on the run again. This time with Rogers.
“Let’s just say Pepper is a very scary woman when she is out for someone’s hide and leave it at that.”
Tony only hums in response and you finish the hot chocolate in silence. When you turn around to put the cups on the table Tony is considering you carefully. It makes you kind of nervous but you sit down regardless and wait him out.
“Anyway, I wanted to apologise as well. I talked with Sam a lot and you were right. I wanted you to be Bucky so badly I never thought about what you might feel or think and I behaved like a douche. And you were right about the team and Tony as well. I hurt all of them but mostly Tony and he’ll probably never forgive me and that sucks. Because I still love him and I should have never left him so quickly especially after we found out about his parents but all I could see and think and feel was you. And I still love you as well. I know you are not the same person and maybe I am projecting feelings but I don’t think so. I look at you and I know you are not the same person, you are not the Bucky I lost but you are still Bucky and I will love you till the end of the line.”
“At once, Boss.” Then the doors slide open and Tony stumbles into the room, sagging on the bed as soon as he reaches it.
“Don’t be stupid, James”, is her unimpressed answer. “It was Steve’s decision and his alone. You didn’t even remember him at the time and you certainly didn’t ask for him to come after you, if I remember correctly. I don’t blame you and apart from that Tony cares for you. And it’s nice to have a friend who isn’t actually an Avenger and lives outside of the tower. I spend too much time in there as it is. It’s good to get out sometimes.”
“At first, yes. I told Steve the truth and his reaction”, you pause to search for the right words. “It could have been better. I decided to move out to give everyone some space and to clear my head but I realised pretty soon that this is something I wanted. A life of my own. Having a job, paying the bills. Taking on responsibility. After everything that happened in my life this feels really good. I’m happy.”
Natasha finds you the next day, still in bed and she curls up behind you but doesn’t say a word and that’s fine as well. You doze off and when you wake up again she is still there.
“I have a job that I like and I don’t wanna be paid by you anyway. But I could come by in my free time. If that’s enough for you.”
Rhodey only comes once as well but you suspect it has more to do with him being glued to Tony’s bedside (if he is still alive, your mind offers) than him hating you or something.
After that, there is only silence while Tony opens your restraints and plugs out the IV needle. He shoves you to the side carefully and slips under the sheets next to you, burying his face in the crook of your neck. After a minute his tears have soaked through your shirt.
Your friendship isn’t one way either. She tells you a lot about her life as well. Talks about her short relationship with Tony and why it never worked out. How she still cares for him deeply anyways and that she is afraid that he won’t come back from a battle one day. She gets really emotional when she tells you how Steve just up and left some day and how devastated Tony was after the whole ‘Civil War’ fiasco. She had to stand by completely helpless as Tony drank himself almost to death and refused to let anyone in his lab or even near it. It took her two days and the help of Jarvis to persuade FRIDAY to overwrite the commands and let her into the workshop. By then it had nearly been too late. She had found the genius unconscious in a puddle of his own piss and vomit and he had remained in a coma for two days before waking up again. She curses Steve’s name even now and you ask her why she doesn’t hate you because you are the reason Steve left after all.
You are dozing in and out of awareness when you notice a commotion by the doors. There are shouts and orders and it takes a moment for you to understand what is going on but then you start to make out different voices.
Steve still isn’t talking to you but the other Avengers are almost back to their normal selves and you count that as a win.
The days blur together into weeks, then a month and still nothing has happened. Ms Fields comes by three more times and you still don’t listen to what she has to say. People show up, stare at you without talking and leave again.
Three weeks later you run again. You can’t stay in Wakanda any longer. Rogers has started to seek you out as well and he tells you all these little stories from his past. Your past. But it all seems so far away and you try to tell him to stop chasing Bucky but you don’t find the right words. So you stay silent and listen until you can’t anymore.
You agree to stay for the movie and manage to drag Tony up to the living room half an hour later. The genius is still babbling about equations and materials and there is no resistance at all when you push him on the couch next to Steve and then plop down on Tony’s other side. It takes another twenty minutes for Tony to emerge from his thoughts. You feel him startle next to you, as if he was registering just now where he is. After turning his head from you to Steve he casually shrugs.
“It’s fine. It’s me. What happened?” Your throat hurts as well, burns to be exact and you feel like you’ve been run over by something very big. But at least the pressure on your arms lessens when Steve nods silently. Thor steps around you and he looks apologetic but you just shrug it away because obviously he had his reasons.
“I bet that’s not what you wanted to hear.” Rogers rubs his big hands through his face and pulls lightly at his hair. “I’m sorry again. Turns out I’m really shit at this. What I really wanted to say was, maybe we can be friends again? Tony allowed me to move back into the tower on the condition that I stay out of his way and I, I just thought maybe we can spend some time together? Just… just as friends of course and well, yes.”
“Well, you got lucky, boy. I’ve got an old Chevy Impala back at home. Wanted to rebuild her ages ago but never got around to it, I guess. She’d be perfect for you.”
“So you wouldn’t consider moving back into the tower anytime soon, right?” He stirs his drink absentmindedly and you think about the question for a moment.
“That would be too easy, Barnes. You think you can just run away from your responsibilities? From what you did?” Stark takes a step back and looks at you with hard eyes. He hates you with every fiber of his being and that’s just fair because you not only took his parents. You broke his team and stole his boyfriend and it doesn’t even matter that you wanted to do none of those things. Because somehow you still did. When you look at him you realize you made the right decision to come here.
A soft smile steals its way on your lips and without thinking about it, you start carding the fingers of your metal arm through Tony’s hair. It’s amazing really, how you can feel everything now. Before the arm had only been capable of distinguishing pain and no pain and hot and cold but that had been that. With the new arm, you can feel even the softest hairs on Tony’s head and the warmth of his skin. But then again Tony is a genius and you never had any doubt that an arm built by him would be just as incredible.
Well, it does hurt a little bit. Maybe even a lot but it’s no one’s business anyway. Except that it is Pepper’s obviously because she is the one who finds you in the kitchen, destroying Sam’s plates and with the newspaper all over the kitchen floor like confetti.
“… is still my tower. Or have I died and nobody told me? Am I dead, Steve?” And this is unmistakably Tony, not really screaming but talking in this thunderous tone which is worse. You are so relieved to hear his voice that you start to cry.
“I should kick you the fuck out right now. You have no right to be here, nor do you have any reason. Your little
And somehow, behind those walls, you feel calm for the first time in years. Your mind is still screaming too loud and your conscience is still weighing you down, you are not peaceful, but at least you can rest. You can hurt no one from here.
For the next week or so he avoids you. Tony has locked himself in the lab and life is miserable again. Clint and Natasha try to get you out of your room as often as possible but you just feel empty and broken and somehow you messed everything up again. Not for the first time that week you think about how much easier it would have been if Tony had just shot you in the head back then.
A cruel smile plays around your lips and you know that your verbal bullet hit the bullseye when Rogers turns around and flees the room. Stark gives you a calculating look before turning around and leaving the room as well.
“What’s the big plan, Barnes?” Stark’s voice is rough and deep and you can detect the anger without problem.
You find an abandoned floor in the tower, it’s under construction but nobody works here right now and you tend to spend your days, and some nights, there because no one finds you and you cherish the silence. New York looks amazing from up here and you just watch for hours. Until Pepper stumbles upon you with a throng of interior designers in tow. She acts unsurprised, takes one long look at you and then sends her entourage away.
“Do what you have to do, Stark. It will be easier for everyone when I’m gone.” Your voice is rough too, from disuse but it’s neutral and devoid of any emotions.
The trial goes as well as expected. There are many experts talking about brainwashing and torture and you can’t help but cringe when they show videos and pictures from your files. They are just the most harmless clips but it is torture and agony nonetheless and you curl in on yourself when you remember the pain. There are people testifying against you as well, people whose families or loved ones you killed, military officers and politicians. Ms Fields had informed you how this would roll and everything is as she said it would be until she calls the last witness for the defence and it’s none other than Tony fucking Stark.
And that’s Steve’s voice and you don’t know what is real anymore and your head hurts. And then the man is gone and it’s your room again and everything is spinning. The door gives and Steve and Tony both barge into your room. Tony notices you first, where you are crouched into the corner, just like the woman you killed a lifetime ago and then again two minutes ago. He kneels down before you and Steve does the same but you still can’t look at him and it’s only a whimper that escapes your lips. But somehow –
You just gape at him because that was a lot of talking and you aren’t sure if you understood him correctly. He wants to build a new arm?
“No more questions”, is what Ms Fields says as she leans back in her chair and smirks at Caldwell and after that your release is just a formality.
Bruce is the only doctor allowed inside because he is the only one who can defend himself against the Winter Soldier. You don’t bother to tell anyone that the soldier is no threat anymore. He is gone, you can feel it. You don’t know how or why but the place in your mind where darkness had lingered before is empty now and you can’t help but feel like you are not whole anymore. It’s no use anyway. You did what you did and you had your second chance.
“Tony, please. You don’t understand…” Steve starts again but Tony cuts him off sharply. “You are right. I don’t. Everyone’s been there to see him, including Rhodey! And the man was practically glued to my bedside. I don’t know why you avoid him like that and I am more than 100 per cent sure that it’s a bullshit reason. But I am going in there and you are not going to hold me back. Rhodey, if you would.” Sounds of a struggle penetrate the door and you are sure that War Machine is currently restraining Captain America.
When Bruce comes in the next day he brings Pepper. You don’t know how she managed to get an okay but you don’t want to know. She doesn’t speak but clutches your hand painfully, nails digging into your still tender skin but you don’t complain. Her eyes are bloodshot and puffy but as the first tear starts to fall she turns around and hurries out of the room.
But you are pretty sure that Stark’s speech alone isn’t the reason why you are a free man now. More what happened after. Out of nowhere Brad Caldwell had started reciting the words –
It doesn’t even hurt when you take a look at the newspaper one morning and see them together, on the red carpet for some charity event, Steve’s arm casually draped across Tony’s shoulders.
You drift in and out of consciousness while your body heals but you are always alone. While you sleep your mind provides you with images and memories that you would rather forget. After a vivid memory of the gutting you just manage to turn over and vomit half on your bed and half on the floor.
It’s silent again but it’s not a bad silence and you relax into the chair while sipping the hot chocolate and Tony does the same and for a while, you both chase your own thoughts.
You find a job in a garage and buy groceries and clothes with your own money and that’s nice as well. You meet a guy at the gym and another one while going out with Natasha and Clint and Sam and Wanda but it doesn’t really work out because they aren’t who you want them to be and while that isn’t nice it’s fine. You can cope with being alone.
You aren’t really sure what to think of that offer. Of course you miss your arm. It’s hard to do everything with just one arm but you can cope. It’s a small price to pay for everything you have done. And do you really want Stark to build you a new arm? Stark, whose parents you have killed?
Okay my dear readers. The time has finally come. In this chapter there will be a brief but graphic description of violence. Please consider this before reading.
You decide then that you don’t want to know after all and you settle on watching the newest Star Trek movie and what you told Pepper earlier is true. You are happy most of the time.
“As to why I can only guess, boss. But I can confirm that no one informed Sargent Barnes about your recovery.” Tony stares incredulously at the nearest camera for a while before he shakes his head and turns to Steve and Rhodey.
So you run and Clint is there beside you but he doesn’t stop you. He shoots two guards with his tranquilizer arrows and you don’t question it and so you run together.
After two more hours things seem to take a turn for the better before they go spectacularly wrong, of course. You don’t know what happens exactly but you can make out Tony in the armour, dragging the last bot he dismantled to the pile of already taken down bots. He drops it before he seems to freeze in midair and the last thing you see is him firing up all his blasters, trying to get away from the pile of broken bots. Then there is a big explosion and the noises from the TV mix with the real noises outside and the tower actually shakes. It feels like slow motion as you jump up from the couch, staring at the screen incredulously. You can hear Pepper gasp and her chair topple over as she jumps up as well, fingers digging hard into the wooden desk.
At first, everything is hazy and muted. But there are emotions now and you can feel something emerging from deep inside, something you thought you lost but by some miracle it’s still there. Broken and in pieces but there. And you know with a certainty that you are no longer under their control. You are no longer HYDRA’s little toy, their weapon. You don’t know who you are exactly but it doesn’t even matter right now. You run.
“Yeah, I… he still loves Steve. And now this. He probably doesn’t want to see me again, like ever and I… I can’t. He is my… my friend.”
“Apologize, again. I’m doing a lot of that lately.” He grins sheepishly at you but your gaze remains hard and he looks down again.
It’s not easy for you to talk about your feelings with Steve and you hesitate a lot and stutter and the words just don’t come out right. How do you explain someone that you love two people anyway? It goes as well as expected and Steve excuses himself afterwards. He says he has to think about everything and well, what did you expect?
“A ’67 Chevy Impala, James? How cliché”, is Tony’s dry comment but he allows you to rebuild her in his garage anyway so you don’t ask. Mr Dennings had been right. The car is perfect for you and you love tinkering on her. With Tony’s help, it takes you under a month to get her running again and you take him and Steve for a ride out of the city. The warm summer wind streams in through the windows and AC/DC is blaring from the speakers and you can’t think of a more perfect moment than the present.
You have talked with your therapist about Stark and she says that maybe you should talk with him about everything but well, you are not a big talker anymore and from Clint you know that Tony doesn’t do feelings and emotions. So that’s probably not happening anytime soon. On the other hand you kind of find yourself drawn to the man. He is everything you ever wanted the future to be and now that you are here in his lab it’s even better. He is an enigma, a puzzle you have no hope of solving but you still try. You don’t know if you will ever be friends with him but that doesn’t stop you from wishing.
Sometimes one of the armchairs is occupied by Natasha, sometimes by Clint. Sometimes it’s Natasha curled up in Clint’s lap. Clint looks relatively pulled together but his hand is trembling when he is carding it through red hair and when he is alone his knee constantly bumps up and down.
Your voice breaks on the last word because Tony is so much more than a friend and you realise now that you would never be happy with just Steve or just Tony and isn’t that just fucking great. Because you can’t leave well enough alone and now you have to go get greedy on top of everything else. The first sob escapes you before you can stop it but Natasha just hugs you tighter and you know she doesn’t judge.
The Winter Soldier is still in your head, circling the perimeter and looking for a way in. You have him under control most of the time but today has been a bad day. It’s been three weeks since the trial and Steve and you have been doing things together a few times now. It’s nice now that he has toned down a bit and is treating you with more ease. Normally you look forward to those outings but today, just thinking about Steve makes you feel unsettled and like you are breaking around the edges. You try to ignore the feeling but that’s a mistake because actually seeing him makes it so much worse and something snaps inside of you and your control is slipping and FRIDAY alerts Steve to whatever is happening to you. He tries to touch you and you snarl at him and turn around and just run –
Steve smiles blindingly at you and pulls you into a one-armed hug. He is still careful with touches around you and the hug is short and you wish it was longer. But the thought scares you so you push it away and smile back.
Being back in the workshop feels like coming home and Tony was certainly not lying about the bots because they ambush you the second you step through the doorway and keep following you around for almost an hour before Tony’s patience snaps and he sends them running (or wheeling) to the other end of the workshop with a very serious threat.
Now, almost a year later you finally feel like a human being again. You have friends now and you make new memories every day. There is so much lost time to make up for and in the end it’s no real surprise that you fall in love with two people at once.
“Buck – I mean James. Is James okay?” Rogers asks and he looks kind of lost as well and you just nod. James is fine.
You almost whisper but his head snaps up as if you had screamed at him, eyes going wide and disbelieving.
She kicks her heels away and sinks down on her knees, wrinkling her crisp suit but she doesn’t look like she gives a fuck.
Shortly after that the elevator spits out Stark and a woman who can only be Ms Potts. You have heard about her but this is the first time you see her and now you know what Clint meant when he said that you better not cross her. She looks nice enough and she smiles at you but you were taught how to assess people and the Winter Soldier would have classified her as a threat even though she has no super powers at all. What she has are sharp eyes and a no-nonsense attitude and well, you vow then and there that you will never get on her bad side.
“Would you consider coming back to the lab to help me out again?” He avoids your gaze and it means the question is important to him. So you consider it, carefully weighing the pros and cons in your head. You love the lab and the work there. You miss the robots and most of all FRIDAY and it’s probably a good way to salvage your friendship. You also remember how Pepper told you how you isolate yourself and maybe showing up in the tower from time to time will be good after all.
Jan tossed her hair back with a flick of one hand.  “That’s true,” she said, sounding proud of herself.  “I have, I enjoyed it, and I’m likely to do it again.”  She braced her hands on the edge of the workbench and gave a quick hop, boosting herself up to perch on the edge of the workspace.  “You’re the one determined to ruin my good time.”  She gave Steve a gamine grin.  “A few years ago, Officer, Tony would’ve eagerly gone along with my prank.”
Steve smiled at her. “I never told you no,” he said. He tapped the tip of his pencil against the page. “I encouraged it.” He glanced at her, his expression going wry. “You might've come up with the idea, but I was with you the entire way.”
“Eli thinks that just 'cause he's going to culinary school, he's too good to do the grunt work,” Isaiah said.  His teeth flashed in a bright, hard smile.  “I don't put up with that in my kitchen.”
“I'm concerned about short term survival.”  Tony gave up and reached for his scotch.  “I'll worry about the long run later.”
“How does it look like it's going?” Jessica asked, at the same time as Jan said, “It's going just fine.”
“There's a camera in here, you know that, right?” Steve breathed, but he didn't pull away, or pull back.
“I need to know where I stand.  I need to be-”  He struggled to smile, ignoring how his eyes burned.  “I need to be sure.  If I keep pretending-”  He shook his head.  “I'll forget.  That it's pretend.”
“Right, of course, how foolish of me to ask.” Tony grinned at Steve over DJ’s head.  “Did you know his pants were upstairs?” he asked.
“Right, so we’d better be on time, or we’ll both be in trouble,” Steve said.  “Take your backpack, okay?  In case something happens, and I’m not home to get you-”
Tony chuckled under his breath, and Harris paused in the aisle, his eyes narrowing.  “Yeah,” Harris said, drawing the word out.  “I wonder why that is?”
"Yes, but not in the way you're thinking."  She started walking again, back towards the guard station.  "That envelope I gave him?  There's a stash of them at the desk.  They've got the information of one of the shelters here in the city for runaways, and, well-"  Her mouth went tight.  "Throwaways.  Kids who have no where else to go.
The nothing spread, enveloping books, shelves, swallowing the light whole, the light flickering out as it disappeared.  It was moving, bubbling, thick and viscous, crawling through the air, threads tangling against wood, against walls.
Natasha patted the spot next to her.  “Put him here,” she said.  Steve heaved Clint over the pommel horse, face down.  His hands and feet trailed down towards the ground, his head hanging limp.  As they all watched, he started to snore.  Natasha reached out and patted him on the butt.  “Sorry.  Equipment failure.”
Hank mumbled something under his breath, already focused back on his work.  Tony watched him for a moment, a fond smile creeping over his face.  “Useless,” he said, hefting the box onto his shoulder.
“The Steve Rogers who belongs here, who is not you,” Tony said, in a rush.  “You don’t belong here.”
"That aside," Steve said, hipchecking the fridge door shut, "I'll be happy if it's the clean china."
Steve folded his arms on the railing, leaning forward to brace his chin on them.  "Looking for a rainbow," he said.
“Okay, so, I don't think I'm needed here,” Tony said, holding up his hands.  “I'm going to go-” He gestured at the door.  “I'm going to go, I don't know, invent something or blow something up, I haven't decided yet.”
“Yeah, that’s, that’s true,” Tony said, bracing his chin on one hand.  “Auntie Patricia, you call me.  Anytime.  We’ll get a salad and some soup, I don’t know, fettuccine.  Something that passes for fettuccine.  You get what you want.”  He pointed at the screen.  “I love you.”
“Tell him no more Chick Webb,” Tony called to Rhodey, even as he set Pepper back on her feet.  “My heart can't take it.”
“Everything is falling to pieces and all of those pieces are on fire,” Jan said. “I guess we're calling that 'not optimal.'”
“Gotta punch something,” Steve gritted out.   Every muscle in his body felt like it had been drawn taut, ready for a fight that refused to materialize.  He sucked in a breath, and another, air hissing between his teeth.  “And my choices are limited right now.”
Tony chomped his way through the toast.  “You want to come to dinner?” he asked Isaiah, gesturing with the crust.  “I can fit you in.  When's good for you?”
“And I need to see him!”  Obie’s face was florid, his forehead damp with sweat.  He tried to shove his way past Jarvis, who set his feet and refused to give way.  Obie scowled at him, but stopped.  “Tony?  Tony, how are you?”
In the silence that followed, Jarvis stepped forward.  “This way, sir,” he said, motioning towards the front hallway.  Maguire stared at Tony, his face florid, his mouth twisted, and Jarvis took him by the elbow.  Steve tensed, but Jarvis turned Maguire with ease, marching him to the foyer.
“Wha-”  The word was half out of his mouth, only halfway, because Clint could see things he couldn’t see, Clint could see things, and Clint’s face was bone white, his eyes huge, Clint-
Tony stared after him, stunned into silence.  A spike of pain from his hand shook him out of his stupor.  He looked down and found he was clutching the dog tags in the hollow of his palm, tight enough that the metal was digging into his skin.
Steve reached over Tony’s shoulder, catching a small equation that had tried to slip away, and pushing it back into place.  “Let’s make a deal,” he said.  “I’ll eat if you do.”
“I’d say leave him to pout in peace, but you are the big boss, so I guess it’s your job to talk him off the proverbial ledge,” Jan said, crouching down behind Greer.  “What’re we missing?”
He looked up at the soaring ceiling, at the gleaming arches that surrounded the stage.  Down below them, the crowds were moving, people flowing from their seats and into the aisles.  Everyone moved slowly, clinging to the last moments of magic.  Tony supposed he could understand that.
“My long, deep relationship with you,” Jarvis said.  His head tipped forward, just a bit, just enough.  “And my belief that you will not waste the time and effort the staff expends on your behalf.”
The warning was very clear in his voice, and the boy held up both his hands. "I think I hear one of the little ones callin' me," he said, his eyes dancing. He gave Pepper a wink and a cheeky grin, and took a couple of hopping steps backwards. "Still your humble servant, Miss Potts, you need anything, you talk to me first, understand?"
“Ah, of course,” Okoye said, her head bobbing in a nod.  “And what will we be using this vacation to do?”
Tony grinned down at him, water lapping at his waist and dripping from his arms.  “Why would you say that?” he asked, laughter running through the words.  His white shirt was plastered to his skin, his pants causing eddies in the water as he shifted his legs to straddle Steve’s hips.  Ignoring Steve’s efforts to fend him off, he reached out, smoothing wet hands through Steve’s hair.  “What do you know?  Much easier from here.”
“You’ll regret saying that,” she said.  She headed towards the staff room, moving slowly across the wet floor.  “Bruce?  The dining room’s closed.  Good work.”
Tony’s lips twitched as Steve gave a firm nod, and added the apple to his basket.  Pleased with this small approval, DJ went back to harvesting, one hand planted firmly on top of Peter’s head.
"New engine," he said.  The tip of his pencil rattled against the gleaming tabletop, his brows drawn in tight over his eyes.  "Very high powered."
Tony managed a lopsided smile.  “Recognize the chip.”  He rubbed his thumb against the indentation on the rim.  “How long do you plan on using it?”
“Hey!” Clint spread his hands.  “I'm up, I'm going, and fuck you, anyway, because any time anyone's asked me for something for that kid, I have shown up.”  He snatched a shirt from the basket and stomped towards the door.  “I might be useless, but I'm always there.”
She nodded.  "You're a good boy, like your Da before you." She made the sign of the cross.  "May he rest in peace."  She gave him a respectful nod.  "Let me know if you need some extra bread."
“Always so eager for me, darling,” Tony said with a smug look on his face, before tumbling unceremoniously onto the couch, sliding an arm behind Steve’s back. The blond leaned easily into Tony’s side, feeling a slight tickle of Tony’s rough stubble against the temple of his forehead. This was the best part of his life, he thought. Even with J Jonah Jameson, as he could come home to this handsome man every night.
When he left the compartment Nebula was in, Tony slumped down onto the floor. Tears began to well up in his eyes. He wasn’t the kind to show weakness to other people, having grown up learning to only depend on himself thanks to Howard’s A++ parenting. He wasn’t even an average father, the type with a beer belly and occasionally helps their child with their homework or turns up at a soccer game after months of not going. Howard was definitely more absent than a few months. Even when he came home, he was always reprimanding Tony about this, about that, and not a single compliment would fall from his lips.
“Well, it doesn’t work on biological beings and alive cells… Did you bring anything over by chance? Actually, that shouldn’t be quite possible, as my theory is that only your physical self was brought over, rather than your clothes or any other objects, assuming you’re from another dimension.”
“I’m not your Pops. Don’t call me that. However, you can sleep on the couch. Temporarily,” Steve said. Tony sighed audibly, knowing that Steve could never say no. He was simply too kind hearted. “You know what, I don’t care. I really don’t,” Tony snapped. “I’m going to go check on Morgan, while Steve, America’s sweetheart, can go and settle down this ‘good’ American citizen in our damn living room. I warn you, no funny tricks. No more breaking of windows. No setting foot on the first step of the staircase, you’re only allowed on the first floor.”
He didn’t make any move to push Steve off though, and Steve ran his fingers through Tony’s dark curls, pulling him closer.
“I did.” The fidgeting with the tiny triangle increased, such that the deft actions seemed more frantic rather than disdainful. “Peter – the guy in the spider suit – he – he was my son. Adopted, but still my son and I loved him more than anything.” Tony sighed heavily. “My husband – I don’t know what has happened to him, I don’t know if he’s safe or turned into tiny dust bits, and it seems like I’m never going to fucking find out since I’m stuck on this damn ship, light years away from Earth.”
Tony and Steve stared down at the table. They knew that feeling. The same pain had hit them so hard the few months after Thanos had snapped his fingers. Without either of them really thinking about it, their hands found each other’s hands and linked them together in a tight clutch. Wade went to clean up his own chimichanga mess and washed dishes in the kitchen, giving them a little bit of space to talk. However, they had no words to say – their emotions were threatening to suffocate them, and all they could do was to clasp each other’s warm hands and try to breathe.
He walked into the drab building, to see Reed bent over his precious machines and mumbling things to himself, as usual. His clothes were buttoned wrongly and had either food spillover or some soil from other dimensions splattered on his pants. After waiting for 2 minutes, Reed still hadn’t noticed that he entered the building, so Tony cleared his throat.
Tony wasn’t really sure what would happen after death. Anything would be better than having to go back home and have Steve berate him over Ultron or Wanda or his feelings for him though.
“The dream – it was the reason I finally told you how I felt. It’s the reason that even if you run away from me and hide in Reed’s office, I would find you. I would chase you to the ends of the world and at least tell you that I love you, because the one time I didn’t do that? I lost the only man I love.”
Tony looked away. If he stared into those eyes another second longer, he would fall. Again. This time, he was determined to not let Rogers break the iron he set up around his heart to stop it from being broken. He took the faceplate off, and was prepared to stand up and dust his knees off until –
“Tony, maybe you should spend less time on engineering new things, look how tired you are,” she said easily. To Steve, it sounded like she like she cared about Tony’s wellbeing, but the malicious and smug smile she gave Tony revealed what she actually thought. She hated Tony for his inventions, wanted to pressure him into giving up his hobby which was his only saving grace now.
“I probably shouldn’t look down on your intelligence – you actually say pretty sane stuff occasionally.”
Steve stared down at the Starkpad. He didn’t really want lessons without Tony teaching him. Just because he didn’t want Asgardian Thor teaching him about midgardian technology when he himself was midgardian, not any other specific reasons along the line of him having a crush on the brunette.
Clint smirked at Nat. “It’s time to cough up the money for the Starbucks I won, I have pictures of them kissing down in Tony’s not-very-secret underground laboratory, and it’s definitely not Photoshopped.”
He didn’t even noticed that he dozed off on the drab couch in a dark corner of Reed’s lab, until he felt Reed shaking him roughly awake. “Anthony Edward Stark, how the hell did you manage that interdimensional travel? Amazing. This is amazing, assuming that my machine didn’t test wrongly, but the probability of that is only 0.0356%. Amazing.”
Steve stirred slightly, and Tony adjusted himself to make Steve more comfortable. He looked beautiful asleep – the neon lights of night time New York were shining on his pale face, and the brunette reached a hand out to brush a stray strand of hair backwards.
A tiny child sat cradled in Tony’s arms, wearing an oversized blue and silver steel helmet over her small head. Her hand was adorned with a glowing glove, which she pointed at thin air in a typical Iron Man stance. “Pew pew,” Morgan Stark-Rogers exclaimed excitedly. “Pew pew all the bad guys away, Daddy.”
“I wish it was me,” Tony said softly. “Peter… He’s still so young. He tried his best to defeat Thanos with me. Before he left, he said he wasn’t feeling so well… I watched him stumble onto me and turn into dust right before my eyes, I couldn’t, fuck, I really wished it was me. I’m so glad you’re still here though… but I needed you. I needed you and I trusted you. Where were you?”
“Yep. That’s like, what I just said. Thank goodness Petey’s adopted, he’s smarter than you. Do you have any chimichangas? I’m starving.”
He was in his suit, lying on the ground, and Chitauri debris surrounded him. The Avengers were all huddled around him, but frozen, as if time stopped all around him. His head rang, and he wasn’t sure if this was some post-death hallucination that occurred in the last few minutes of brain activity. What was going on?
“Actually, there’s a tiny problem. I mean, my house is really far away, just a shitty apartment in New York, and it took me a really long time to get to this hidden place in the middle of nowhere. And Petey said you let Ned stay over before… Therefore, I can assume sleepovers aren’t completely banned… and I’m Petey’s friend…”
“I thought you liked me – I saw the pictures, the drawings, and they made me happy, and I thought you have these drawings saved in your Starkpad because you liked me, and then you turn around and say we’re just acquaintances, and why would you even have these stuff in your Starkpad then, just hidden away and found by a code from Clint, and now you must think I’m really stupid so I’m just going to leave now.”
“I wasn’t in the tower. I was bored out of my mind, and I really wanted Starbucks, so I shot an arrow to the nearest building with Starbucks and ziplined my way there. Also, I have no idea why you’re saying Pepper rejected Tony because he dumped her like 5 weeks ago when you were on the SHIELD mission,” Clint retorted.
Tony sat comfortably in the lounge of his apartment, as he tapped away at the keyboard with his eyes fixed carefully on the screen as he worked away at the 3D model of his character. He always wanted to be a superhero since he was younger, like the characters in the comics he loved so much. Howard always grabbed the comics and threw them in the bin, before losing his temper at Tony, saying that he wasn’t working hard enough and smart enough.
. He thought about Steve, and how he didn’t want to see him anymore, but he also missed that hug that Steve gave.
“How could you treat Wanda like that? It’s not like it’s her fault, you were the one who actually made Ultron. You’re being really rude, Tony, what the hell? Now you’re not even owning up to your own mistakes - I thought that maybe you were a better person than that, but clearly I was wrong, I can’t believe I actually - thought – maybe –,” Steve trailed off, a steely look in his eyes.
“I’m just glad that you’re a part of that 50 percent that stayed. I think… I think I might have ended myself if you went with Peter.” Steve moved up to sit on the bed and pulled Tony into an embrace. No more words were needed between them.
Blinking back some tears that blurred his vision he walked out onto the street without thinking, and everything fell to chaos as he saw a white coloured Mercedes rushing towards him at high speeds.
In the aftermath of Ultron, Tony was faced with glares and unhappy looks from his team mates at Stark Tower. People who he saw as family now gave him reproachful glances, especially with Wanda around. She moved into Stark Tower when she had nowhere to go after she lost her brother and her everything, and while Tony felt like it was the right thing to do, he did not want her around. The nightmares she planted in his head were just more ghosts that would never go away, more anxiety that would haunt his every footstep for the rest of his life.
Sighing loudly, Tony stands up and puts down the mechanical parts he was fidgetting with, before brushing off his knees.
“The only person I was slightly close to was probably my sister, Gamora. I hated her so much then, but now I miss her. Especially since our father gave her away for the stone. A little bit of me can’t forgive myself for taking so long to see her like a sister – so I can’t love her the way you love your husband and your – adopted… son.” Her black gaze seemed to bore a hole right through Tony himself.  The hurt in her voice was palpable. “She also had someone who loved her, and no matter how much I try, I can’t help but be jealous.”
“Yes Sir!” Wade mock salutes to both Tony and Steve, which earned him exasperated glances. Tony trod up the staircase to go kiss Morgan good night, while Steve took out spare blankets and pillows for Wade.
“You see the window open? It’s a search engine, in this case it’s Google. Usually, if you need any information, in this tower you can just ask Jarvis. However, I think it’s better if I roughly tell you how to use basic functions of your Starkphone and how to Google things, in case your 94 year-old ass decides to go out on the streets alone and you need help. You already know how to call and send messages, so just know how to Google things. Basically, you can ask Google anything, and it’ll have an answer,” Tony droned on.
Tony took Steve’s tiny hand in his own and interlaced their fingers, before pulling him over slowly to where a few laptop screens stood on the desk. One of the screens showed a map of Manhattan, while another showed an animation of some robots flying around played on repeat every few seconds. Steve’s eyes shifted to the last screen, and saw himself, but stronger. Tall, handsome. His sharp cheekbones from thinness were all filled out. A shiny shield with a white star in the middle was hooked onto his right hand, and his gaze was firm, but hopeful. Steve had never seen himself like this, and his grip on Tony’s hand tightened. His other hand reached out to touch the screen gently with the tip of his fingers.
Why are you still looking at the pictures, Steve reprimanded himself. It’s not even good art, I could draw better, Steve thought. He picked up the Starkpad, and stalked off angrily in the direction of Tony’s lab.
A shield, he decided. With that blue colour on it, just like the 5 similar blue shirts in his closet.
“A cup of coffee a day keeps the hangovers away. Haven’t you heard of that quote? It’s quite famous,” Tony replied, eyes still on the Starkpad. “Anyway, thanks a lot for carrying me up last night. It was pretty late last night, so I guess you crashed on my couch. Sorry, man.”
“What do you think, you little fuck, I literally just came back from dust! Is that not good enough for the great Tony Stark? Go ahead and blast me or cut off my head, darling, I promise I’ll still be fine after everything you do. Anyway, I picked up some newspapers, and I finally found out what happened. Some giant purple bastard called Thanus or something snapped his fingers and destroyed half of all living creatures in the entire universe. And I got my stupid fucking hopes up, because maybe, just maybe, Petey didn’t get snapped away. A few days later though, there was a newspaper article about all the superheroes that got killed by Thanus, and Peter was in that article.” Wade choked up slightly. “That’s why… I decided to come find you two. You are the only few people who really knows him the way I do, and the best parts of him. Before I came to find you, I spent a couple of months sitting in the alley of a bar and knocking myself out. I don’t know, I was a wreck.”
Steve looked at Rhodey.  Rhodey looked at Steve.  “No,” they said in unison, and Pepper burst out laughing.
“Six months?” he asked, with a winning smile.  “A year, max.  Just enough time for me to hide in the workshop, have a nervous breakdown, and channel a great deal of sexual tension into revolutionizing at least one American industry.”
Steve realized his mouth was hanging open.  He closed it.  "I see," he said, and he didn't.  But anything else he could say would only get him in trouble, and he'd had his fill of trouble.
Tony winced.  “Right.  Right.”  He gave his head a brisk rub.  “And now I'm grateful that we included a door directly into the closet from the master bath.”
The stores had changed.  The houses had grown and cluttered up streets that had once been empty, and women in fancy dresses and men in high collared jackets walked where sheep had once jostled against each other and their shepherds.  There were parks that hadn’t been there before.  There were old benches  right where he remembered them.
“Ass,” Nebula agreed.  “Also, you walked in chanting ‘tramp stamp tramp stamp tramp stamp,’ which, honestly, both rude and a bad idea.”
“I mean, by saying you’ll ignore it, you’re kinda not ignoring it,” Clint said, as Carol put a foot on the back of his chair and gave him a shove.  His chair slid sideways, and Clint made a grab for the table to keep himself upright.  “Hey!”
“I haven’t decided yet,” Tony said, and he did his absolute best not to let that sound like a lie.  He took a deep breath, squaring his shoulders.  “Look, it’s not-”  He shook his head.  “It’s not a big deal.”
“Watching the footage, I got that impression.”  Tony folded up his menu sign, moving it to the back of the truck.  “Luckily, I have spies everywhere.”
Bobbi smiled.  “Doesn’t it always?”  She paused beside a plant bed, crouching down to run her fingers over the leaves, turning them over, checking them for something.  “As it turns out, once they had my father on the payroll, they found other things for a talented chemist to make.  Worse things.”  She went still, gently stroking a leaf between her finger and thumb.  “Things that he made, because now they had his wife and his teenage daughter living right under their control.  Things he could swallow his pride, to keep his family safe.”
"Or, perhaps, that I had a job to do," Jarvis said, his voice wry.  He stepped back into the bedroom just in time to get out of the way of their new guest.
He tossed back the rest of his drink.  “He jumped.  That’s the last I saw of him.  By the time Stane stopped the car and we doubled back, he was long gone.  I told him that he’d gotten past me, that he’d opened the door and escaped, he’s…  Clever that way.”
DJ’s head snapped up, and for what seemed like the first time, he saw the elderly woman sitting in the chair opposite him.  She was a small woman, thin and almost frail looking, but her back was straight and her shoulders squared beneath pale silk of her scarf.  Her hair was a silvery-white frame around her gaunt face, long locks pulled into a smooth chignon.  She was smiling, but her eyes were dark and unreadable.  She leaned forward, setting her tea cup and saucer on the coffee table between them.  She reached for the tea pot.  “Now, then, don’t leave a mess,” she childed, a note of amusement in her clipped tones.  “Give me your cup, dear.”
"Don't make this any harder than it has to be," Steve said, his voice pitched low, his head bent next to Tony's.
“My husband Ben worked for StarkIndustries,” she said.  “A night watchman.  It was a tough job, but the pay was good, and it meant he could be around in the afternoons, when Peter was coming home from school.”
Steve’s eyes shot to Tony’s.  “His-”  He looked at DJ, but DJ was still sleeping, his breathing slow and even.  “They’re long gone.  Why do you-”  Care.  The word stuck in his throat.  It seemed wrong, somehow, and he didn’t know why.  Probably because he was stroking DJ’s hair, and he didn’t seem to know he was doing it.  “Why do you want to know?”
The pen slashed across the page, and Duck leaned forward, the lenses of his glasses catching the light and going flat and white for a moment.  “Ning.”
Laughing, Tony wrapped an arm around Pepper's waist, lifting her up and off the floor.  “A slow tune might not be the worst thing,” he pointed out, just as the door to the workshop opened.
There was a polite, subdued tap at the door, just loud enough to bring Steve's head up.  Before he could say anything, Jarvis said, "I took the liberty of ordering room service for a...  Late breakfast."
“Want to go for a walk?” Steve asked.  He braced his elbows on his knees, leaning into them.  “We can explore a bit?”
“Found him,” Natasha said, shoving her way through the door, one of Bruce's arm's clamped firmly in her hand.  Bruce stumbled along in her wake, his glasses bobbling sideways on his nose.  “Sorry we're late.”
Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide.”
Rogers caught his arm, dragging him to a stop.  “It’s his father,” he said, and Tony stared at him, the words ringing in his ears.  Rogers gave him a shake, a small one, but enough.  “The armors-  Recognize each other, it’s his father, it’s Tony, he wouldn’t do it unless-”
The last word was soft, sad.  There was no accusation to it, no anger, but still, it hit Tony like a physical punch, his chest aching.  Rogers stared at him, his blue eyes guileless.  “He's never been alone,” he said.  “And...”
His voice trailed away.  Steve shook his head.  “They’re not coming back,” he said.  He moved a piece, and he wasn’t even sure what it was.  “If they’re still alive, they’re telling themselves that he’s better off where he is then where they are. If you can’t feed your kid, then it’s better, you tell yourself that it’s better.  At least in a home like Hammer’s, they’ll be fed.”
“Only because they don't know about him.”  The words hung between them, and Tony shook his head.  “Can we discuss this later?  When we're not about to put on a good face in front of him?”
Hammer, for his part, burst into laughter, a little too loud and a little too sharp. Even in the crowded space of the lobby, heads turned in his direction. “There's that famous Tony Stark humor!” Hammer said, his hands propped on his hips. “Amazing. Just amazing.”
Jesse stared at her.  Ellen stared back.  “What?” she asked at last.  “What are you seeing that I'm not-”
Tony bent over, picking up a book.  The pages were crumbled, and he straightened them, one by one, flattening them against the covers.  “Right,” he said, his voice tight.  “We know that.  So what-”
Clint nodded.  “Look, I'm not in a place to tell anyone else how to live their lives, I'm a grown ass man and if my cell plan wasn't on auto pay, I'd be missing that sucker every month, but still.”  He looked up, squinting towards the roof of the tunnel.  “Bet your parents are worried about you.”
“For now, I’d like you to return to the city.  Wilson will get you set up on the city guard.  It’ll give you a reason to go where you need, and talk to anyone.”  He straightened up.  “The captain of the guard runs a tight ship.  His people can be trusted, but beyond that?”  Nicholas shook his head.  “I can’t say.”
“No!” he managed, struggling to pull away, but Steve’s arms tightened, holding him in place.  He kicked feebly at the air, choking on a laugh.  “No, I am not-  No!”
“Thank you, sir,” Jarvis said, setting a plate of roast beef, roasted new potatoes, maple glazed carrots and julienned green beans.  “And, if I might say, sir, a most creative chef.”
Just a crack, barely an inch, as if someone hadn't quite pulled it shut behind them after walking in.  But it was most certainly open.  From the shelter of the house, Steve eyed it, waiting for someone to realize their error, to appear to push it closed and lock it.
“Mmmm,” Tony said, neither agreement or disagreement.  “You're a menace.” He yawned.  “I could take a half dozen pictures and send my kid to college with the proceeds.”  He grinned.  “You're that dangerous.”
“Ah, that-”  Strange nodded.  “That explains quite a bit.”  He looked at DJ.  “I’m glad you found your way back to an old friend, but it’s nearly dinnertime.  Best we get you home before your father notices you’re missing.”
Sam glanced in Tony's direction.  Tony tipped his head in Steve's direction, and Sam nodded.  “Lead the way.”
“My ma used to give me Jell-O when I was sick,” Steve said.  “But she wouldn't, it wouldn't be solidified.”  Hitomi's eyebrows arched, and Steve grinned.  “When I've got a cold, drinking liquid lime Jell-O is still my comfort food.”
She smiled.  “So am I.” She took a deep breath, and it hissed between her teeth.  “I’ll be honest.  I don’t remember all that much that happened afterwards.  I was determined, I would not break down.  Peter had had enough loss, enough grief, and if I was all that was left, then I would be the rock upon which he could anchor himself.
There was a soft knock at the door, and Tony looked up, grateful for any interruption that he could get.  “Come in and take this away,” he called.  “I want this individual evicted from my library immediately.”
“Wait,” Clint said, but he was already moving.  Darcy, caught off guard, scrambled to catch up, and Clint grabbed her hand, making sure he didn’t lose her.  The remaining half of her churro tumbled to the ground, forgotten in an instant.  “We thought he was in Vegas, he’s-”
He reached up, catching the rim of his shield in his hand.  “I…”  He smiled.  “It was given to me,” he said, a truth that sounded like a lie.  “I had another.  It broke.  This was-” His fingers smoothed over the edge, learning the dimensions all over again.  “A gift.”
Steve hadn’t been expecting the cold, hard edge to Jarvis’ voice.  “An overstep of course, for an employee, and to be honest, I don’t know what I meant when I said it.” He paused.  “But I know I meant it, if that makes any sense at all.”
“Just tell everyone who asks where you got it, and you can have it for free,” Miriam said with a bright smile.
"Don't do that, either," Steve said, shaking his head.  "Tony, I think maybe you should just get some rest, we'll be home soon, and-"
Two voices, identical and balanced and coming from opposite sides of the room.  DJ looked from one Stephen Strange to the other, both walking in from identical portals with identical strides.  They both froze, staring at the other, and then as one, they both turned to Agatha.  “Agatha, what-”
Obie reached for his jacket.  “I had assumed you’d tire of that child, the way you’ve tired of every other toy you’ve been given.  I had thought I could simply wait you out.  I’ve waited you out for every other fixation you’ve found, your entire, worthless life.”
DJ nodded.  “Thank.”  The rest of the words caught in his throat and he hated it.  He took another breath, trying to focus on that, on the steady, controllable flow of air.  In.  Out.  In.  Out.  “Thank.  You.”
He heard it, and knew, without even having time to think about it, that something had just gone very, very wrong.
“Almost always,” Tony said, and he sounded remarkably cheerful about that.  Steve pulled back, just far enough to see his face, and that was a mistake, because Tony, rumpled and flushed and pleased, was the most gorgeous thing he’d ever seen.  Steve let out a breath, and it shuddered through him.  Tony’s lips twitched into a smile.  “What?”
“I'll remake the bed in the morning,” Steve said, his head falling back.  “I'll load the dishwasher and vacuum.  I don't care.”
Jarvis smiled at him, and straightened Steve’s jacket on his shoulders.  “I love you. Now go wash for dinner.”
“Because Hill wanted him here,” Tony agreed.  “The question is…”  He wiped his hands on a rag.  “Why?”
"I cannot be responsible for you," he said, but the statement didn't conjure up the fear that it should've.  “It's dangerous.”
"And that is a lot of pink," Natasha said. Both of them were on SHIELD motorcycles, somewhere down on the ground, and he didn't like it, he didn't like not knowing where everyone was.
Rhodey held up a hand. “No,” he said, shaking his head.  “Absolutely not.  I’m not getting involved in your latest act of madness, this is-”  He ducked as Happy went by, arms flailing through the air.  Rhodey watched him go, his face bemused, before looking back at Pepper.  “No.”
Clint shrugged.  “I mean, that’s the definition of my own life, I don’t dwell on it.”  He looked at Harris.  “You want to wear your own clothes, go pack.  Darcy-”
Val glanced at him.  “Yes,” she said.  She pulled her legs up, her glittering pink sneakers scraping against the carpet as she wrapped her arms around her knees.  “Everyone does, I guess.”
For an instant, Tony was frozen in place, caught too off-guard by the sudden meltdown to process the situation.  DJ was curled into a ball, his fingers clawing at his ears, a thin, high pitched shriek pouring out of him.  Tony stared at him, shocked into immobility.
Sue braced her hands against the edge of the workbench.  "No, Tony," she said, very carefully.  "I haven't."
“I mean, that’s another option, sure,” Harris said, because Fury looked pained and Tony was biting the straw of his juice box hard enough to bend it in half.  “Like, a…  A floating magical city above Las Vegas or-”
“You're thinking about it,” Tony said, and dear God, but that was the hottest thing he'd ever seen. “You're thinking about me shoving you into a bathroom stall and-”
O'Brien's mouth kicked up on one side.  "She's making a trip down to Hammer House.  And you're an expert in that particular rat's nest, so..."  His heavy fingers rattled against the arm of his chair.  "Your job is to go with her, make sure no one hassles her or her driver, and get her the hell out of our jurisdiction without any incidents."
Steve rolled his eyes at him. Tony chuckled. “Though, that being said, I don’t particularly boast about it. “
“That was a long time ago. Unfortunately…it was unsustainable.” Zola paced his lab in one of the newer models of his body. He remembered events extremely well, including the invention of his ‘son’ using Steve’s blood to create a child with super soldier abilities. That was soon used against him, and brought upon him his own downfall. There was a victorious spring in his step as his absurdly large eyes from the projection screen in his modified body’s chest darted from test tube to test tube. “There are much more…
To Tony, the kiss felt so real, so vivid. Once more he repeated internally that he didn’t want this dream to end, as strange as it was. Eventually he pulled back, gasping for air and looking at the Captain’s flushed cheeks.
From where Steve was, all he could hear was the pang of bullets, but that was mainly because he was being shot at while trying to clutch onto a drone plane and the explosive device that was attacked to it to disarm it. Bucky was crouched down next to him – shooting at oncoming agents to protect Steve, showering bullets upon oncoming enemies.
Tony leaped off the wing and grabbed the ledge of the plane, keeping his boot jets going whilst he dangled, letting his boots gain more power and slowly rise into the air reaching up for the door handle or something to grip onto to tear it down. He inched closer his metal fingers wrapping around the silver handle.
“I’m… We’ll work on it, but if you think that I was going to leave you over you giving me the ability to walk again, then you’ve taken me for a sucker, Stark. There’s no way in hell I’d leave you, Shellhead. We’ll be together through the thick and the thin,” Steve confessed, now taking advantage of his second chance at life. “The two of us.”
Steve’s eyes were darting about erratically as he held Tony, gliding down to the city alleys.  Tony’s chest jolted and he winced, gazing up at the man whose silhouette was highlighted by the risen sun.
“Great! I’m going to have fun doing this…” His finger lowered on the button before pressing it with a triumphant grin plastered on his face. The many screens in the room revealed the robots, and the police fighting them. Steve stood by, noticing the familiar faces from the precinct, it was a relief to see no one was hurt and that they had all banded together. The second Tony pressed the button the huge bots fell in unison, slamming to the ground with dust clouds surrounding their now lifeless bodies.
“This has to be one of the best days of my life.” Tony spoke with such elation, his hands flailing with excitement as the camera pointed toward the sleeping Steve, then back at him. “Best days… Ever!”
Tony nodded and pulled back, releasing Steve’s arm from his clutches and instead walking side by side with him.
Natasha shook her head at the inappropriate suggestion, attention caught by one of the screens in front of Tony. She noticed a figure, and even though her perspective was inverted from where she stood, she could still make out the silhouette.
As he was about to hit the ground he felt a metallic thud against him, had he fallen toward a building instead? Another metallic clang and screech and he meekly opened his eyes to behold what the commotion was about.
Steve instantly ducked down and wrapped Tony in his large wings that weighed virtually nothing, his hands reaching for Tony’s face, lightly prying his hand away and replacing it with his own as he cupped the man’s face. “You can do anything. You have the biggest heart and most pure soul I have seen. Although you fall Tony, we all fall, you pull yourself and build yourself up to be better than ever. You’re a strong person, a hero. You’re my hero.” He said, “You... gave me a home.”
Tony’s head began to throb with the information. “Okay so let me get this straight. So this is exactly the same as the superhero problem. You know, I was told that all of these superheroes were getting killed in gang killings, getting mobbed and brutally murdered. It wasn’t until recently that I saw it for myself, I saw a friend… Get killed by some over powered, brain dead people. I thought that was because we went out in the open, but what you’re saying about being tracked makes sense. That’s what these chips all have, a tracker. So you’re saying that the government arranges these mobs to kill not only heroes, but villains?”
“We need to go into that tower… We need to take down whoever is in charge. They’re hurting our friends, Steve. They’re killing them, they’re turning people into killing machines through chips in their brains… And they did…” He stopped, taking a deep breath and glancing up from the part he was working on. “They wiped your mind and turned you against me. Never, never again. We’ll find out who did this to you. I swear to you, I swear on my life that I’ll never let that happen again and I’ll do everything I can to take them down!” He nearly shouted.
Steve sighed. “There’s no point in waiting, let’s just get this done with so I can get my feet on the ground.”
Steve let out a chuckle. “Come on, I’ll ask Reed to open the next portal for us.” He wrapped his arm around the armoured man’s waist and walked on, stepping through a giant square portal of blue light that formed just in front of them.
The crowd that was by the entrance of the alleyway still hadn’t dispersed, watching the wide curious empty eyes stare at him as he stepped further out. He frowned instantly, giving them a growl and holding Steve protectively, huddling his head away from them and closer to his own chest. He staggered, still in pain from the previous fights. He knew he had to push through all of the pain to get the man he loved back into shape.
Steve made sure he was going so fast that Tony yelped a jumble of his name, short quick movements that made sure to graze against his prostate with each thrust. The pleasure was immeasurable.
Tony’s fingers carded through Steve’s soft, blonde hair with yearning, trailing down toward the nape of his neck and along. He urged the man closer until their clothed hips pressed together. Even through the fabric he could feel how much Steve wanted this, how much he needed his body completed again.
“I’m not sugar coating anything, but good luck. You’ll need it.” She saluted at him before heading out, Carol following her, clearly not finished with her lecture.
With Hammer down, it was time to deal with the puppeteer himself. The machine was huge, a mix of purple with purple crystals decorating the outside, and a range of wires all linked to the helmet that The Purple Man was donning. He stood with his arms out, head tilted back and glowing sparks of purple flying from his body.
“What are you two supposed to be, the skull brothers?” Tony remarked, the bitter memories of both of them not helping their case. But it seemed now they needed him, and this was their strange way of asking for help.
“You’ll have to make me…” He panted, fumbling over his own words. He tried to be stubborn but he was feeling so dazed from the affection he received.
Tony’s eyes widened with a snap, his mouth opening in pure shock, “Why are you saying this?” He asked in a slightly more aggressive tone. He hated when his father was brought up in any conversation, and it did indeed take him off guard.
“Night, Steve.” He finally plucks up the courage to reply, waving as he turned to his own room which was conveniently next door.
Steve gave a nod of acknowledgement and gratitude for the reassurance and then faced the screen. “What kind of bomb is it?”
Obliging, the man took his place in the scanner while the beams of red light swept along his body, and surely enough his vitals were registered on the monitors. Reed then took that opportunity to compare with the vitals that he had previously glanced at, and then at Luke’s. “The scanner is working perfectly fine, Tony.”
He smiled at the words. “You’ll be okay… Steve… I told you… I promised…” Tony raised his hand, with his last ounce of strength he used Extremis to open the door, before his hand fell and his entire body felt like nothing at all.
Steve who was already sat in the new car, adjusting his rear in to fit into the already formed groove of the black leather seats peered up. “What’s wrong, partner?”
It was strange to feel this overwhelmed with emotions over something that felt so surreal. He knew he would wake up and this would be a dream, in fact that was his worst fear, that this moment would end. He was drowsy already and probably drunk on tiredness, but as long as it felt real, that’s all that mattered.
Tony had grown up surrounded by the myths and stories of Captain America, hell he even collected the comics and had a whole room of Cap memorabilia. He was his hero, his company. When his father was busy he would sit down and read the comics and imagine he was right there witnessing it all, or even fall to sleep hugging a little action figure. Captain America had done so much for him without even being a real figure, and now this paper was saying that he was real – and here he thought all this time that it was just a figment of his father’s insanity.
Her heart began to race, but her collected appearance gave nothing away. He had once been in a close relationship with her, and with everything they had been through she knew this was a personal battle. “I’ll deal with him.”
Suddenly they both felt strong. Their hearts beat in sync, their bodies moving in the exact same pace.
Tony’s sad expression lightened a fraction. The agony and weight on his heart was solid and still very heavy. “You know… I loved her a lot, during the accident the shrapnel from the explosion went into my chest, near my heart. I always say that she took my heart when she left, since... I guess it’s never been the same.”
Steve could hear every sound that Tony was making through that microphone. He could hear the hitching breaths and the constant apologies and turned again toward the glass. Slowly he rose to his feet despite the never ending aching pain in his stomach, staggering toward the glass and looking up at him. Instead of tears a black drop of liquid pooled in his tear-duct and slowly began to trickle down his snow-white skin before he reached his hand up and brushed it away, though smearing the black over the sharp edge of his cheekbone.
Two to the left entrance, five to the right, six in the middle that would rotate every two minutes and walk in a circle – Having figured out the pattern, he turned to whisper it.
“He’s smarter than we give him credit for, that’s for sure.” Clint replied. “You never know, this could have all been an act. Then again, I never believe the crap that these reporters go on about. How’d they know it’s Stark?”
Steve’s hand carried on, fondling the bulge that was slowly unveiled as Tony’s undersuit slipped lower and lower, letting the Captain touch his raw skin.
Tony narrowed his eyes, “They’ve done something to you, I know they have. The Steve I knew wouldn’t have done that, and he wouldn’t be working for some evil communist regime.”
“We understand that Tony but we must prevent this from becoming worse.” T’challa grabbed Tony’s hand this time to stop him from lashing out any more.
Vision floated by, hovering just behind Tony to take in the data as the man was. “It appears that the multiple threats detected are spreading in allocated sectors within the city.”
“Clint used to be in the circus too, that’s when the guys picked him up as a youth offender and turned him into the fine strapping policeman you see before you.”
“You call me Steve too, Captain is for the battlefield.” He nodded, reaching out for Tony’s hand. The dark haired man smiled joyfully and took Steve’s hand, giving it a firm shake.
As he walked further he saw a trail of blood leading to the alleyway, the same one that they were using to hide in earlier. Cautiously he followed the crimson path and his eyes widened at what it led to. There she was, her black hair covering her face, lying as still as a doll. Tony could feel his heart thud with pain, unable to distinguish the whether it was caused by the intense regret he’d had for staying down below. Her mask was torn, along with parts of her outfit; her full lips were ever so slightly parted and had a trail of red from the corner. She was beaten, battered, pulverised to death. He could’ve gone through every bone that he knew was broken, but that would cause far too much agony. Peter ran up to him, peering over his shoulders, the wide white eyes widening even further as his body began to tremble. Tony scooped her into his arms and looked at the boy, what was he to do?
“He’s made more than just one crazy one, I heard a rumour that once he made a robot that was in love with him.”
Steve felt Tony’s movement to his inseam become far more rigorous than before, noticing the hunger in his half lidded eyes, he craned forward and slipped Tony’s trousers lower and lower. He had to wriggle to get out of them, but he was already doing so, particularly since he was pushing his hips up to meet Steve’s instinctively with a stare that oozed confidence.
Steve’s face flushed completely, and he grabbed his shirt from the floor, slipping it on and pulling Tony out too, who decided to opt out of doing his buttons up, quite proudly flaunting the love bites that Steve had left down his neck. They both cleared their throats and fixed their hair, Tony turning to help Steve neaten up his blond mop.
“Oh quit complaining, we get to take down a giant robot!” Jessica added with the thrill of excitement twinging her tone.
“How dare he touch you.” The armour spoke, backing up its own AI into the SHIELD database before absorbing the data. “You are mine. He does not deserve you. Decrepit outdated waste of life, the test subject that should have been eliminated. He is a failed subject, you are the superior subject, and you are the perfect subject.”
Tony nodded in a haze, his jaw clenching at first, but Steve’s movements started to circle inside him One fingers turned into to, and he began spreading and scissoring his two fingers to work the muscle. It actually hurt; it was painful despite the lube. For a moment he could have sworn he was tearing up, only to swallow it down after he looked up at the man doing it to him with an instant sense of relief.
He whistled one of his favourite tunes and walked into his building, noticing only then that everything was pitch black. JARVIS ran in first, barking mechanically, his eyes lighting up and projecting a flashlight as he sniffed around, searching for clues.
He could feel his heart in his throat, he knew something wasn’t quite right with Taskmaster, but he had to leave it and help his friend. He grabbed Masters by the hood, roughly, and pulled his body over to the nearest lamp post, reaching into his own utility belt to pull out a few rope ties.
“The scanner wasn’t working and—” He couldn’t just say that he had a moment whereby he was struck by empathy, and knew that Steve
“Anyway, I wasn’t the only one in the robotics industry. Turns out that guy over there was in it too, but in a different field. He ventured more in space and dimensional travel and robotics that would help that sort, nanny bots for his future family too.  We’ve been friends since high school, and we decided to meet up and collaborate on a project.” Reed appeared in the hologram, looking significantly younger than he was now, even though it was only a year ago. It really showed how work would often age you with stress, though he still had his signature grey temples and messy brown hair as well as a light dust of stubble on his upper lip probably from days on end spent in the confines of a lab. There was really that much detail in a tiny hologram.
There it was the confident tone Tony needed to make him enjoy this even more. He could feel how hard he was, the blood coursing through his veins, feeling the pumps ringing in his ears.
He was given the all clear and then sent home, back to his place which wasn’t too far from the base, even though he had a distinct recollection that he was hours away from base. He didn’t quite understand, but there was a lapse of time between him getting from the base to home, returning to his place in Brooklyn, the small apartment that he was raised in with everything looking just the way he had left it, even with specs of dust coating the shelves that he had left vacant for so long.
“Seems like a patch up job, you’re right. It’s too random, there has to be someone behind all of this…” That’s when Tony spotted something that made his expression fall even further, but he didn’t look mad, he had a look of disgust creeping over his lips. His eyebrow twitched in fury.
“Where are the others?” Steve asked while Vision floated toward Hank, lifting him into his arms and performing a scan.
