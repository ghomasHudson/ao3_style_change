“I’ll be home in time for family movie night. Later losers.” Tony kneeled down bracing for the pressure. Clint hit the enter button and Tony’s world warped out of focus into a blur of colour, clouds and pressure against his bones. He closed his eyes briefly but the landing threw off his balance as the pressure dispelled around his body.
“Tony, not this again, I had to help, they need me, I can’t sit on the side lines and watch things go to shit … not again T. Look, you’re still my best friend Tony, I want to be here and hang out like we did before, but I need to be settled in Shield, a couple more missions then I’ll be able to set my location here and not be away for months at a time… I don’t want you under Howard’s thumb again. I want to keep my best friend out of all this politics. Can’t we just agree on that?” Steve played with the edge of his t-shirt, nerves setting in. He was excited to see Tony again, but one wrong move and Steve could lose Tony, he could chuck him out of the flat and tell him to get lost.
“Kid, I’m pretty sure you were drugged. How else did you manage to get into this apartment with the best security around, I mean you didn’t exactly come through the window that’s for sure, Steve is not going to like this if he hears about it.” Tony rolled his eyes at his last comment, expecting Peter to not react or even care about what he said.
“How are you Steve?” Peggy’s hardened expression softened into one of concern and care for Steve’s wellbeing. Steve slid down in the chair a little stretching out his legs in a more relaxed position. “Well, I was shot and didn’t even see him, so not feeling too great Peggy. How are you?” Peggy continued to watch Steve, “I’ve been better, intel says its either Howard or Anthony that he’s targeting. Can you confirm either?” Steve shook his head, “Shoot had public news articles up on his computer before he shot through it and destroyed it, equal halves for articles about Howard and Tony.” Peggy sighed, “Will you ever call him by his name? His name is Anthony it’s not that hard, Steve” Steve chuckled a little, “I’m sure, even you, have slipped up even once and a while.”
“Cool, glad we have a big family rather than a tiny one, it’s just me, Howard and mom, well, and Jarvis cause he checks up on me more than my mom does so he should count.” Tony turned around to lean against the counter as Peter placed the casserole dish into the oven and set the timer. Tony pushed himself off and headed down the hallway to his room, “guess it’s time to ask the question, how did you get here? What were the events that placed you here?” Tony called out from down the hall. Peter panicked, how do you explain to your Dad who isn’t your Dad yet that he is superhero just like his Pops, along with two super spies, a Norse God, an irradiated scientist, his digital butler gone sentient and a witch who….yeah where do you even start to explain that to a guy whose only concerned with his PHD just now.
The music grew a slight fraction quieter, enough to give Peter his thoughts back even for a moment. Not enough for anyone else in the building to notice but enough that Peter didn’t care so long as he could try and get Tony to leave. Reminding him of his promise, but Tony was barely awake anymore. With the music slightly quieter, Peter’s super hearing picked up the confident heavy steps heading towards him. He got his wish.
Peter wrist watch pinged. He looked down to check, Karen needed him. He quickly ran upstairs, his sock cover feet leaving little to no noise, Peter jogged into his room gently closing the door behind him, jumping up on to the ceiling, picking open the vent and pulling down the bag with his spider suit in it, throwing it on to the bed. He jumped down and landed as softly as he could. Unzipping the navy duffle and rummaging around to grab the mask, holding it in his hand for a minute. It had been months since he’d actively put this on to be a hero. It had started to gather dust on the in inside eyepieces. He gave it a rough shake. Pulling it over his head.
Peter pushed the coarse dirt off his face, he took a harsh breath in and whipped his head up to look at Natasha, she stood tall, arms crossed and a proud smirk gracing her face. His hands curled to grip the dirt between his fingers, a few clumps sliding between his wrist and his father’s watch. “Try again.” Natasha brushed down her black vest top and jeans, shifting from a tense action stance to a relaxed position on the back of her heels. Peter used his hands to balance so he could jumped up on to his feet, he spun around ready to strike once again. Natasha uncrossed her arms, placed them down by her sides, she curled her fists, the playful smirk stayed comfortably on her face.
“You know they say sarcasm is a measure for potential. If that’s true, you’ll be a great man one day.” He looked over to his wife, “I just need to check on one thing, just to make sure its in the trunk.” Howard left once again through the front door. Maria placed her hands on her lap once she finished her song. She took a breath as she lowered the cover down over the key, “He does miss you Tony, when you’re not here.” Howard walked back in jacket in tow. Maria made her way over to Peter, his eyes wide, his heart rate picking up. She used her fingers in a come here motion for a hug, pulling him gently in. “It was very nice to meet you Peter, I hope Tony brings you round again sometime.”  Peter nodded into her shoulder, “The pleasure is all mine, Mrs Stark.” Howard and Tony snorted in the background. Maria whipped her head round to effectively shut the two men up. Howard coughed into his fist.
Peter slowly raised his head again coming face to face with the stranger. A stranger who he had seen before. Only in photos because that was the only way it was possible. That it was even plausible. Maybe Peter had finally lost it.
Steve let himself dream about the life he wasn’t going to get. Not anymore. He wonder if he and Tony stayed in that apartment, where did they raise Peter, Tony owned house all over the globe, maybe they stayed abroad. Guess he was retiring from Shield now, technically on the run from them. Maybe thats why Peter held the shield with such conviction? A relic to stay on the wall in his future home? Peter. His son. The spitting image of Tony and he wouldn’t have had it any other way, the kid who he’d held while he cried about missing his parents! What was it like raising Peter? Was he a good father, did they go to church on Sunday, did they even get along?
The Shooter was ahead of Peter and was running extremely fast, faster than the average human but Peter was just slightly faster, He would catch him in seconds at this pace. What Peter didn’t expect was to get within metres of the shooter, for him to stop and turn to punch Peter in the chest. Peter ducked under and slid on the gravel under the shooter. Peter armed the web shot with a tracking dot. Aiming at the shooter’s back to place the shot, the shooter turned with his arm out stretched to catch the web shot between his fingers.
Peter and Pops at the beach. He was Peter’s father! He was Tony’s husband?… The thought left a shiver down his spine. He married his best friend and had a son… he had a strange life, that was for sure. The thought was spoilt at the realisation that he’d failed his family… Tony and Peter are dead.
“When we get home, can we all come out here? Including dad? No technology, alien or otherwise?” Peter’s voice broke in a laugh towards the end of his sentence. Steve threw his arm up and over Peter’s head to hold his shoulder in a hug. “Of course kiddo, anything you want, I second the no alien tech rule as well!” Steve gave a gentle squeeze, then slapped his shoulder, “come on, we better maker our way to the trail road, We’ll get a lift from… me?Steve? Whatever, Clint and myself and we’ll be home in no time.” Steve used his knees to help himself up, “Natasha!” Steve, Peter jumped a little at his father’s booming voice, “Let’s go!” Steve held out Peter’s straps, Peter stood up, moving his arms through the straps and adjusting before his Pop’s let them go. Steve then sorted himself, before staring at Natasha for a minute. Peter’s eyes flick between the pair before Steve sighed and picked up Natasha’s bag and began walking. Natasha smiled at Peter before catching up to Steve.
“Anything we can help with Ana?” Tony came to stand by her, looking over into the pot, taking a long sniff of the food. “Mmm, smells good!” She reached over and ruffled Tony’s hair, “back you! I just added too much to the pot and I can’t lift it!” Peter stepped forward from Ana’s other side, lifting the pot with easy, “Uh, where would you like it?” Ana looked happily surprised, she gave Peter a light slap on the shoulder, “Ah, a good strong boy!”
Peter hit the floor with a thud on to his back. Quickly aware of surrounding Peter reached is hands out to lift himself off the ground, but he collided with another head. Peter lay back down In agony, clutching his forehead.
Tony made his way towards the double doors, knowing his way around his own compound. “Come on. You’re no fun, I think I’d love to chat with myself!” Director Carter frowned, clutching at Tony’s upper arms she dragged him out of the doors and down the hallway to the elevator. Tony smirked as she let go. Barely making eye contact with him, she stares straight ahead as the doors close. “You know, all you have to do is apologise and I’ll forgive you. You know what you did was wrong but, In a way Steve and I are inevitable but… I don’t want to lose the last of my family that was actually there for me, please apologise.” Tony straightened his tie in the reflection of the door as Peggy silently gasped at his words, “I’ll forgive you, not immediately. I remember that much but if you want Steve to forgive you. Then you’ll need to apologise to me first.”
Steve buckled the haggard safety harness, preparing himself for the jet to land. While Steve didn’t always agree with Tony’s ‘baby-sitting’ protocols that the suit had been developed with, he was grateful for it in this moment, the tracker that they’d added after a serious fight in New York had left their home in ruins and Peter twenty feet under rubble. Steve rested his head back on the headrest, closing his eyes, he played with his ring, the constant back and forth motion achieved by his thumb, a bad habit of his in stressful situations, he considered it his subconscious’ way of wanting Tony with him.
“Now, how do you know that. I’ve never seen you before on campus or at a party and I’m pretty good with faces kid. So who the hell are you?” Peter was frightened. What does he do? He’s stuck and lost in time as far as he can tell. His Dads are years away from being his parents and he’s just 17. The phone attached to the wall rings. Tony holds eye contact with Peter as he slowly gets up and walks to answer the phone. Peter takes a moment to look at where he was. He’d landed on the hardwood floorboards of his Dad’s college flat, his eyes landed first on the old yellow couch, which to be honest still looked like shit. The flat was literally covered in textbooks and sheets of paper lying about everywhere but he could see the bits where his Pops had been, the papers were stacked neatly rather than haphazardly, there was his leather jacket on the back of the chair at the dinner table and sticks of charcoal lying on surfaces around the room. The sun wasn’t up yet but he could see the clock on the far wall say it was 05:30.
Peter couldn’t help but snort at Steve's stunned reaction to his dad, it actually was kind of sweet to watch how in love Steve is with his dad, especially as his Pop’s watched next to him. The nervous blush at a single touch, his world turned up side down with time travel but his dad turns up and he’s stuttering,
Tony sat up, Steve continued to stay laid back, his hand rubbing up and down Tony’s back as a comforting gesture. “You are Captain America, not Tony Stark’s nanny. It’s …selfish of me to want you here all the time, you are the one friend that has stuck around, even when I do something stupid. Which is often. So, don’t be mad if…” Steve’s hand froze. He sat up next to Tony, Staring him in the eye. “I could call aunt Peggy, you could be reassigned to investigate the shooter. Agent Coulson would take over here.”
Natasha backed off of him. “I can respect that but he’s just a kid as well, as for Steve, if I tell him I get prison time and possibly murdered if I tell him Tony. I need you to tell him you’re alive. If I do, he might not believe me but if you use your weird pager communication device thing. Let him know, he’d be here in a heartbeat and you know that you need him here. Tony, he thinks you’re dead! He’s killed probably hundreds of Hydra operative in the last two months because he’s not caring about his own life anymore, he’s not planning anything!”
Their truck stopped in the middle of the trail, no one around for miles. Natasha jumped out the truck, Steve and Clint dropped down off the roof. The trio walked round to the back to open up the doors. They found papers. Everywhere. Filing cabinets destroyed in the chase or bullets. “Well. Stark likes to hide himself in plain sight, so whatever the solider was looking for. It’s in here. Start looking. Romanov drive back to the nearest town. Barton and I will start looking while you drive.” The other two nodded, Steve and Barton jumped in the back. Steve pulled the doors shut again.
The thunderous noise grew, coming closer and closer to him. He squeezed his eyes closed when the thunder struck overhead. “Peter! I have been looking all over America for you, where is the young leader of Iron?” Peter opened his eyes to his Uncle who was inspecting the room around him quickly. His short cape flowing around his shoulders. “He’s not here Uncle. He kicked me out.” Thor whipped his head around to Peter, “Young Tony, kicked you out of his home?”
Quickly walking over to the door, he leaned his back against the wall next to the heavy blast door. He closed his eyes and let his super soldier serum work its magic, he could hear the guard making his way down the hallway. The distinct sound of army books scrumming against the floor, finally turned the corner. Steve shoulder barged the door off of its hinges and let it clatter against the adjacent wall. Righting himself, after tripping slight, over his feet. He looked either way down the hall. Throwing his shield down the hall, allowing it to bounce twice before sweeping round the corner. Thunk!. One guard down, Steve thought to himself, time to get Clint, as he prepared his arm to receive the shield back.
Peter had given it two hours and an extra 150 people in the hall before his stress level increases and he became desperate to go home. He wants his Dads to come gets him and take him home, make him dinner and sit on the couch, watching a film as family. Tony had 9 beers in this time. You’d think he’d been stranded without water with how fast he downed the beers.
They heard the click of the gun safety off. Clint hit the gas as bullets hit the back of the truck. Steve held the shield behind their heads as the truck pulled off. The shield was wedge between the seats, barely moving as the bullets bounced off of it.
Peter helped pull out more art supplies and notepads from Steve’s room when he decided to just chance a question that he’d meant to ask his parents back home. “How do you know that about Steve? You two didn’t seem pretty close on the phone yesterday, just wondering how you guys came to live together.” Tony had moved on to the wardrobe by now packing up the last of Steve’s wardrobe that he had left behind. “Steve and I are the best of friends believe it or not, just … last semester, he dropped out went back to join Shield, saying the ‘country needed him’. Howard loved him like his only son and I was pretty sure he just told Steve that so he could have him back in his life.” Tony taped up the box and began to fill another one. “He didn’t believe me, of course why should he? He left for the greater good I guess, I think he was just done with me in the end, He’s a couple of years older than me physically, guess it wasn’t cool to be seen with me around.” Peter wanted to interrupt, prove how wrong he was about himself and his Pops, but he couldn’t his dads’ needed to find their own love for each other. “Steve and I used to just stay in after class and wait up all night telling each other stories, moving furniture about to make forts and just learning about each other. I’d say he knows the most about me out of anyone on earth. He is my best friend.” Tony stacked the boxes by the door, “Even if he thinks it’s a good idea to go spying for Shield for months at a time with no contact for his flat mate.” Before Tony could try and push the boxes down the hallway, Peter walked up and causally lifted them off the ground. Tony was shocked for a second before shrugging, “He could have led a quiet life, just doing art for the rest of his days, a legendary veteran retiring at 25 but nope, he’s got to play the hero.” Peter sat the boxes down by the front door, “Does he visit or speak to you?” Tony chuckled, a bitterness to his tone, “Kid, yesterday was the first time Steve got in touch since May, I don’t have his number, so I just have to sit here! Like a soldier’s housewife just waiting by the phone all day. I’ll keep his stuff till he is back but he’s not coming back into my life that is for sure.”
Tony’s lost look just nodded slowly as his Aunt Peggy explained, he was going to ask questions, but he didn’t even know where to start, “You two need protection 24/7. No ifs, no but. It’s happening Tony.” Steve stepped forward, he opened his mouth to speak but Peggy raised a finger to shush him. “You took a bullet Steve. Immediately off active duty. You wanted to stay in the USA? Here’s your mission, protect Tony and Peter, security detail only.” Peggy leaned to the side to look past Steve, “Barton I want you running leads on this now. I want a report and brief in the morning.” Clint nodded and walked towards another SUV and Romanoff followed.
“I’d like to think Tony is far from being someone like that. But Howard rubs off on people, not always in his best light, I just wanted to make it clear, I think you are good for Tony, he needs someone to show him the lighter side of life, whenever you’re around he seems, so much …. happier.”
“Hey Ste, aren’t you looking youthful and full of innocence.” Steve stopped short of breathing the same air as Tony. “Hey T.” Steve was breathless, this could be the last time he speaks to Tony. Even if it’s not his own He couldn’t help himself. “You’re looking … good Tony.” Tony smirked, reaching out to touch Steve’s face. His face let the smirk go, a lop sided smile at the gentle touch. “Not so bad yourself Steve.” Steve opened and closed his mouth a few time in quick succession.
Steve rolled his shoulder. Prepared for the argument ahead. He marched his way towards Director Carter’s office, Romanoff and Barton close behind. Barton had his grumpy face back on. Romanoff twirled the poster tub in her hands as they made their way to the elevator. The three stood in, turned on the spot, Barton pressed his key pass in the slot. “Welcome, Agent Barton. Level eight Clearance.” The robotic voice greets them, the doors closed, and the glass elevator began to climb.
“Sweet, uh when is that, I’ll need to get it off work just to be sure!” Peter started to pull out vegetables to make his soup with. Tony called out, while he was walking down the hall to get ready for his date, “We will head over for the 14
“Goodnight Captain Rogers.” Peter gave a small wave to his Pop’s before leaving the room. “Goodnight Peter.” Steve said quietly to Peter who was out in the hallway. Steve watched the door shut and make a soft click noise, Steve removed the rest of his uniform slowly, after 3 months in the jungle
“Wheels up in 15, Cap, see you there, I need to restock the arrow heads and grab like a burger, or maybe two? What do you say, ‘Natasha the Great’ hungry?” Barton exclaimed, making everyone but Peter and Tony jump a little.
Captain Steve Rogers, Captain America, the symbol of America freedom. Well, he lost it. The moment Howard’s hand raised again for another pat, Steve reached over to grab Howard’s hand with his arm across his chest. He quickly pinned Howard to the wall behind him, shattering the frame of the print that had calmed him down seconds ago. Howard grunted as he contacted with the wall.
“Uh, yeah, same to you Peggy, I mean!” Peter coughed and choked a bit, “Director Carter.” Peggy let out a soft laugh, “Let’s be honest with each other Peter, I know you are my godson’s son. You are from an unknown date in the future and that you at the moment have no way home.” Peter looked frightened in Tony’s eyes. “Glad, we cleared that up! Ok are we free to go Aunt Peggy?” Tony tried to help, he really tried.
Peter chuckled awkwardly, “Uh yeah, spider-bite, mutation, then it activated my Pop’s strength in my DNA, Super fast, super strong and heighten senses. Yeah. Super cool just hard for people to understand.” Natasha gentle placed her hand in Peter’s hair and gave a gentle pat. “Yeah its super weird kiddo but considering Steve is who he is, it doesn’t surprise me all that much.” Peter froze and slowly looked up to his aunt. “You know…?” Natasha gave a friendly smile, “Too much to match you to him kiddo, you smile and frown like he does.” Peter laughed with his aunt, “Yeah, Dad says that all the time. Does… does Steve know?” Peter looked so innocent in Natasha’s eyes, a young boy, lost and away from his family.
Tony turned pulling open the door he slammed it behind himself. Marching down the hallway he stayed calm. Sliding his key card in the door, he pushed it open forcefully and slowly shut it behind him. He pressed the back of his head against the door, letting out the stress. He smiled, his first real one in months. Letting out a silent scream, turning rapidly to give middle finger guns to the door. Fuck you Fury! Tony cheered to himself. Steve could do that to him, he’d be seeing Steve again soon and when he did. He’d never let go of him again, he’d take him away from Shield, no matter what. He just needed to wait. His eyes shot open, an idea playing in his head.
“Stark?” The small group turned to face Steve. “You’re a Stark? What is going on here?” Steve crossed his arms across his chest, desperately not trying to break into Carter’s office (again…) to just find the file on the kid. Peggy stood to attention, walking up to stand between Tony and Steve. “Captain Rogers, This is a Level 8 situation, 4 Days ago Peter James Stark arrived in Boston from 2018 New York. When this happened, we immediately began searching for a way home for the kid. Now you are up to date Captain.” She turned back to Fury, Coulson and the group of scientists.
Barton scoffed loudly, “That dude, ran over 7 rooftops in under 3 minutes, 80 he’s like an athletic 20-year-old. So, did the kid and even he was exhausted and he’s no couch potato. How did the meeting even go with Director Carter and kid, find out who he is yet?” Barton took another bite of his burger. Steve sat up in his chair, “Yeah, kids under Shield protection till he can get home, cousin of Stark’s.” Romanoff’s eyebrow twitched into a frown. “Right, anyway he’s been spotted in D.C so we are going to go stealth, see if we can find his target first. If not, someone will die, and we will lose this trail again for years.”
Peter let out a whistle, a low pitch, single note whistle. He could no longer hear outside the house. He took in another deep breath. “Step two, open your eyes,” Peter kept his shut, shaking his head, he felt like he couldn’t, it would be too much.
, “I was a day early to our wedding, it’s truly surprising I let you go alone. Really it was a matter of time.” Tony smiled down to Peter, who had been laughing at his Dad’s impatience. “Love you guys.”
day anniversary together.” Tony said with a slight smirk then sighed, “your Pops lost them on his latest mission, your photo totally fine, digital copies on every Stark server, but that old one of your Pops and I was an old shit-fashioned black and white photo copy, so he wants to make another, ergo, a trip down memory lane.” Peter broke into a grin, running over to Steve by jumping feet first over the couch as the last of the boxes were set down on the coffee table.
“I was thinking lunch on me?” Peter opened up his bag to show Tony he had food, Tony had led the pair upstairs to the workshop that held DUM_EE, The robot whirled in delight to see Tony and Peter. Tony kicked over a rolling chair towards the metal bench and dragged a stool over by hand. Peter set out the two rolls and the salad before sitting down. Tony sat down with a heavy thud on the stool, his arms going limp by his side, he gave a mock groan at the sight off food. “Peter, I have no idea how you get up at 6am for work, Rhodey dragged me out at 10:45 this morning and I’m exhausted!” Peter chuckled at the thought, “Well, only two more days till we head to the Stark Mansion for Christmas anyway, you can sleep then!” Tony hummed in agreement, spurring his body on to grab his roll.
Tony wiggled his fingers in Steve’s tight grip, trying to release the tension that had set deep in his bones, it had been there since he’d ran Peter out the door but now, was he really ready to let it go? “Only.. If you consider forgiving Aunt Peggy. I know this whole thing is a real shit show but we don’t have than many friends between us to be honest, so let’s not lose anymore?”
“We would like to offer a … weaker test of the device to allow you to forget your suffering of the deaths of your friends. We could set your memories back to coming out of the ice. No suffering of losing a friend. Just a little confusion then happiness again.” Steve and Peggy drew in a breath through their teeth. “No pain of the past, just a happier future. New friends. Friends that aren’t Directors of secret government divisions.” Steve stared off into the distance. Forget Tony?
“Open the door Rogers, I want to see my godson.” Peter raised his head quickly at the sound of his aunt Peggy. A wide smile broke out on Tony’s face as he ducked under Steve’s arm and ran to the door, stopping just before the door to swing it wide open.
Before Steve couldn’t even say anything, Peter quickly asked for help, “Please help me get him home, he’s letting me stay at the apartment, but I can’t even get him up and I just need help.” Steve was ready to protect Tony from this punk, but he’d quickly realised this kid was way too young to be here, he must have been like 16 and Tony brought him here!?
“On his way ma’am, though not by choice according to Agent Coulson, his butler is also joining him.” Peggy nodded in response, the scientist turned and rushed out the door back towards the lift. Peggy followed, she couldn’t remember the last time she’d truly spoken to Jarvis, he’d been her friend at one point in time, shame, she thought to herself, she’d let work get in the way again. Gosh she hopes Jarvis doesn’t faint when he sees this.
“Yeah, can’t say much about the business, don’t want to give you a heads up business wise  but don’t worry your home a lot. You’ve never missed a parent’s evening, academic decathlon or even a family dinner, well only a couple but not when it counts. I don’t know much about Howard but you’re definitely not like him.” Peter was happy with his answer, taking another bite of his sandwich. Tony looked thoughtfully at his answer, It meant that yes he took over for Howard at Stark Industries but he was still in a relationship with a man no less. He couldn’t imagine Howard just sitting back and letting that happen. Letting Tony run the company with his, lover/boyfriend/husband maybe even just co-parent of Peter and Howard not trying to disinherit him or kick him out of the board room.
Tony lead the way down close to the protective screens, a loud crack sounded through the office, Tony had to close his eyes as bright purple light filled the room, when he opened his eyes again the large anomaly stood wider than before, certainly less reactive and more stable than before. Peggy stood next to her godson and greeted the future, “Mr Stark. Captain Rogers and others.” They stood crowded round the anomaly on their side. The Avengers stood arms crossed in the back, Captain Rogers of the future had his shield at the ready, the scowl on his face, highlighted his age in young Tony’s eyes, the slight wrinkling around his eyes in forehead, man he missed his friend. He moved his attention to his future self. Anger clear on his face, Tony hadn’t realised that ‘Uncle Thor’ stood closely behind the pair.
“Captain Rogers, why is this relevant to your mission?” Peggy looked up to stare Steve in the face. “They were trying to manufacture Erskine serum.” Natasha looked over to Barton with a raised eyebrow, who just point towards Steve then expanded the distance between his hands grew in size. Natasha nodded her head as if she understood.
“That’s not possible?” Tony spoke up, “The Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee chased him after he shot Steve!” Thor looked confused and relayed the message. “The Captain, Widow and bird man have no idea of the events you are describing, Peter tread carefully, things may be changing around you. We may never feel the effect, or it will only hit us once you are back. Be carefully Neph- “Thor disappear when Peter blinked. Tony just turned to face Peter, “Uhh so that wasn’t good news was it?” Peter just walked over to the couch and sat down. He focused on the sensation of sinking into the couch cushions.
“Yeah, Yeah, he’s secretive but he’s good, he wouldn’t come unless he has an answer. I’m just hoping that Director Stark hasn’t got some super-secret clearance level 11 bunker that we aren’t supposed to find!” Steve shook his head slightly, reaching for a sip of his beer. “I wouldn’t put it past Howard, to be honest.” Natasha just ate her food in silence, carefully watching Steve’s face and reaction, if Steve was honest, it was slightly unnerving, he wasn’t going to let it show on his face. Natasha smirked.
was going to happen under her roof. Steve would have blushed but he’d like to think his mother would have supported him and Tony, sending them away with enough leftovers to feed them for weeks.
Tony rested his chin on Steve’s arms, “Peter deserves some ice cream too. But not you, you’re the idiot Frisbee player.” They all chuckled together and made their way back to the apartment. As they approached the ground door, Steve ran ahead towards a SUV with the shield logo. Peter saw his Uncle Clint jump out the driver side door and hand Steve two duffle bags. Exchanging short words as Tony and Peter approached. Steve thanked him for his help and promised to catch up with him later. Clint gave Tony a short wave and Tony gave a short and relaxed salute as the pair turned around.
“Tony, Tony, are you there?” Steve said on the other end of the line, “Tony, Jarvis said you’ve not left the flat in days now…Tony?” Peter just stood in shock as Tony mouthed to him. ‘Who is it?’ Peter grabbed the red pencil that was lying on top of the phone box and wrote Steve in giant letters next to him on the wall. Tony almost fell off his chair. ‘I’m not here! Say I’m not here!’
Steve let out a tense sigh, Peter could almost hear the disappointed tone of his Pops coming through from the sigh. “First off Howard, Tony is one of my best friends since I came out the Ice, he isn’t a chore or someone I feel obligated to hang out with. I …like his company,” Peggy didn’t move but looked up quickly to the vent where Tony and Peter were hiding, it was like she was his great Aunt Peggy giving him the sly and funny eyeroll whenever his dads did something sappy.
Hello and Happy New Year!  Apologies from the extreme lateness of this chapter! I decided to rewrite parts of the master plan for this story with some changes to this chapter taking the longest to implement, so sorry!
“Anthony.” Peggy smoothed out her skirt. Coughing into her fist, Tony watched her awkward behaviour with an air of distrust. “I must discuss something with you, urgently, I -“ Tony raised his hand and stopped the pen, effectively silencing his Aunt. “I already told you. I’m not Shield property and as I learned the hard way that’s the only way I get to see the people I call friends, so I’m done. You can come back Monday if it's one of those alternative Mondays. I don’t know yet I haven’t checked my schedule.” Peggy Carter was know for her stiff upper lip and she was not short of it now. She could see how Tony’s head could spin things, always having a reason as to way he wasn’t good enough for his friends or family, trust that could take years to build, gone in a single comment that Tony could justify just as quickly, no matter how much it hurt.
“Sure, if you can keep up!” Steve leaned back against the wall, “I’ll meet you in the kitchen in 5?” Peter nodded, “Alright you two, I’m officially going back to bed.” Steve let out a snort and Tony wandered back down the hall to the bedroom. He opened and shut the door behind him, inspecting the room before jumping back on the bed. He rolled the grey sheets over his body and sunk in to the mattress, laying directly over the bed, his head sandwiched between Steve’s two pillows.
“Well, I’ve not spoiled too much, so I think you’ll need to do it like the first time, absolutely blind but choosing how you would.” Peter gave a deep breath at the end. Hoping just a little, that everything was just set in stone. “Huh… Let’s build a fort tonight, order pizza the whole thing.” Peter looked up from his roll a little stunned, “uh sure, but I uh. Thought you had a 2
YES!, Tony thought to himself, but the kid didn’t reveal what he wanted. “Midtown,” Tony gave a long whistle, “Smart kid to get in there!” Tony was genuinely impressed with his son, but there it was that moral goody two shoes compass, Tony went straight to college, why would Peter’s other parent not encourage Peter to get ahead of his class mates?
Steve shook his head, thinking good old Rhodey, “He’s actually useless when he has a crush on a woman.” Tony held the door open and turned on the lights. Steve jumped in the room first, Peter poked his head around the door frame to watch, “DUM_EE I’m back!” The squeal was deafening! DUM_EE drove directly him to Steve who in return laughed as the robot attempted to claw at Steve’s face. “DUM_EE you’ve gotten better at driving! You’ve out done yourself this time Tony.”
“Mr. Stark made it quite clear that Tony was to… stay away from Captain Rogers when he returns from his mission. He doesn’t want Tony, to uh, ruin a national treasure with his ‘devil driven’ ways.” Maria sighed, her eyes giving away the slight hint, that a tear or two may form. “The yelling began shortly after I brought Mr Stark his morning toast. It hasn’t stopped.” Ana turned around to show a partially broken piece of glass, “Howard threw Tony’s pager device thing, that he made, at the wall, destroying it, then the poor boy screamed at Howard, it has been back and forth for about ten minutes.”
Peter woke up with his head hanging upside down off the bed. The sun was just peaking in to the room as Peter slowly slipped down off the side of the bed. As he stood up to take in his surroundings he realized that he’d been sleeping in his Dad’s old room when he was growing up. It still had poster, tapes and clothes sitting around. It was tidy but not by his Dad’s doing, definitely a cleaner or two has been through here. Peter switched out his hoodie for one of his Dad’s from the chair of recently clean laundry, it had one of his Dad’s favourite bands on it. He stared into the mirror in the corner of the room and ruffled his hair, he seriously need to get it cut. As his hair flopped in every direction above his head, Peter turned and wandered down the East hallway toward the kitchen. As he turned the corner into the kitchen Peter heard his Aunt Peggy.  “Anthony what are you doing up already?” Peter lifted his head up from the relaxed position to stare at his Aunt. “Sorry Peter, oh how you look so much like you father when he was your age.” Peter walked up to his Aunt and gave her a great big hug, “Good morning, Aunt Peggy! Yeah, yeah, I know I need a haircut.” Peter moved to sit down next to her at the breakfast table. “How are you, I’m guessing my dad’s told you what happened last night at home?” Peggy nodded at her godson. “Hmm. Yes and I’m glad you and your father are safe but you’ll be glad to know that ‘Dum-Ee’ is absolutely fine.” Peter let out a breath that he didn’t know he had been holding.
Steve’s fist stayed curled at his sides, taking large breaths, his shoulders rising and falling. He turned on the spot and marched back down the hall, muttering to Clint as he walked by. “He got away. Again.” Clint quickly ran a couple of steps to catch up with Steve. “Steve, Steve! Please Stop!” Steve stopped abruptly and turned to Clint. Clint turned to check that no other Shield agents were about, he leaned closer into Steve’s space, “Natasha sent a package. I haven’t managed to translate the entire message, but we are being kept in the dark about something Steve. Something big.” Steve’s frown was considered permanent on his face nowadays. “Let’s make out way back to base to free up sometime to translate the message. The fall likely broke his ankle. We’ll have a couple of days to follow.” Steve walked on, Clint tried to keep up.
“You know we’ll watch the monitors to make sure you get back with them?” Tony turned on his heels to find Clint spinning around in his desk chair. He jumped out of his skin, “How the hell are you still so silent Legolas! Damn you! Where you watching me?” Tony scrambled and threw a wade of paper at Clint’s head. Thor reached out his arm to catch the ball of paper. “He is right my friend! We will stand vigil as you go find the Captain and young Peter! We swear on our lives!
Tony loves the feeling of flying, he’d open the door of the helicopter if his Aunt Peggy wouldn’t just throw him out of it for scaring her. His face was pressed up against the cool glass window, watching as the forest below passed by, the sun filtering through the trees in the spring afternoon, The hum of the rotors drowsed out the noise of his own voice in his mind, he really wanted to jump out rather than see Steve. Steve thinks he’s dead, he's going to have to bite his tongue and not blame Steve for not getting in touch with him, not trying to find him. He can’t fight him on this but… he hurt just as much as Steve did. Then again, he didn’t think that his best friend was actually dead, just … ignoring him, for no real reason when his parents had been murdered.
Tony watched the kid and the super model interact, it was his Uncle!  So, his husband, god that is still weird to know, is definitely a model of some sort if this is his future Brother in Law, brain cells maybe lacking in the family, but It would be fine, he surely wouldn’t marry just for looks, he’d hope he was better than that. Tall, blonde and handsome huh, good to know, easier to keep an eye out for.
Tony played with a loose threat on the side of his fluffy white sock, he shrugged but knew that he had to speak to her eventually, he only had her, Jarvis and Ana left in his family, he couldn’t afford to lose another one due to bad judgement. “Anthony, what I… I came between you and Steve, I had no idea how close you two were and I had no right to act on behalf of Steve, I have to be honest and say it is strange for me, to see you and Steve get along so well, if we had anything close to a normal life, Steve would have likely been seen as your uncle, but we can’t have normal lives with people like Captain America around and time travel clearly possible.”
Steve held Tony out at arm’s length, “T, please don’t, I just got home, I need to know you’re safe! I didn’t bring you to Ma’s old apartment because it’s a Shield hideout, It’s home! You said if we both finished college, we’d move out here start a fresh, But I need you by my side. Please just a chance T?” Tony placed his head in his hands, leaning on his knees.
Tony was feeling grateful that Peter had inherited his brains and not this guys, jeez at least someone in his family was smart enough to keep up with him. But he didn’t call this Thor guy dad either, he really needs to focus more on the moment, his mind wandered again.
Making his way back on to the ATV, he set the vehicle into the gear and sped off to catch up with the truck.
Tony sat in the row ahead of Peter, thinking the kid was asleep again. The doors to the aircraft shut and the pilot ready to depart, they set off. Tony watch out the window, as the concrete runway turned into the dark cloudy skies above New York. He played with the edge of his glasses in his hands. Once the all clear had come from the pilot, Tony looked over his shoulder to check on Peter. He seemed out cold so Tony turned down the cabin lights and pulled out a small pager like device from his pocket.
Peter took his steps carefully, rocks by the rivers edge were always slippy. He’d been following the river all morning, hopefully close to the cabin if his sense of direction was correct. It had taken him longer than expected but a quick stop to get supplies and their weight on his back had slowed him down. He jumped slightly to re-position the hiking backpack on his shoulders. The water flowed over the small edge into the large pond in-front of the large wooden cabin. Stark family’s holiday cabin. The large wooden structure had been built some time in the fifties and while Howard Stark never wanted to go camping, it was seen as a nice tax break to hire two people to take care of the property. He and his Pops used to come down to the cabin every summer and speak some time together, just the two of them. They always used to tell Dad that they went fishing and hiking when really just spent the week relaxing in the sun and swimming in the nearby lake.
Ana was going wild on Tony. Trying to control each hair on his head, which fought back every time she moved it, he reached up to gently grab her wrist giving an innocent smile, “you can cut it tomorrow, it will be fine for today Ana. I look fine.” He lowed their arms down, she pats on his shoulders, giving a gentle squeeze. “Do not worry little one, they will be here today and gone tomorrow, then Christmas day and you won’t have to see him for another year.” Tony stood tall, his eyes focusing on hers, “You’re right. It’s just tonight, then they’re off again.”
Steve followed closely, “I was thinking that as well Tony, I can’t figure out why, but Barton will. He’s good.” the hall lead to two bedrooms, they used to be Steve’s parents’ room and his bedroom which Peter had taken up. So that just left the one, but Steve was prepared to offer himself for sleeping on the couch but he … had to try for some alone time with Tony so he pulled a plan he’d used from the old flat. “So, there’s only one room, you comfortable with it like it was when the heating broke?” Steve was a bit nervous about this, they’d shared a sleeping space a couple of times previously. Before he left.
“Thanks Tony. I need that.” Peter’s eyes dropped to the watch fiddling with it in his hands, turning it over and over again. Tony came and sat down next to him on the bed, he must have put the box back in the cupboard. “Don’t worry kid. We will get you home. Just promise me that you don’t lose that hope. I had Steve and Rhodey to save me just in time. You will get home to your family.”
Peter smiled at Thor. “Its December 1991, can you ask my Pops for me how he is? I miss him…” Simple and to the point, Thor came back quickly, “Peter your father insists you be careful and do not go—” Thor disappeared.
Peter subtly opened his eye to check if Tony was watching him, he shut them again and decided to just listen to his parents be dorks to each other. It was a nice remaindered that they are still like his parents just… not quite ready for him.
Clint kneeled down next to Steve, taking the photo out of Steve’s hand to look at it, Steve raised his hand out slightly, as if to stop Clint in case he damaged the photo. He quickly stopped. Clint’s eyebrows shot up. “Uh…wow.” Clint took Steve’s wrist in his hand, placing the photo down gently in his palm. Clint moved back to his stool. Resting his elbows on his knees and his chin resting in his hands. Steve cried. His breath hiccupping and stuttering. He let out a low whistle to calm himself down.
Peter continued to eat the rest of his salad in peace, with the solid thumps of a tennis ball repeatedly chucked at a wall in the background. The squeal DUM_EE let out was the only thing alerting Peter to his Uncle Thor appearing once again behind him. “Young Nephew, quickly what is the date for you?” Peter swallowed the last bite of the salad, the juicy tomato taking an extra second to swallow down.
if he was honest, he can’t really remember the day exactly, mainly because he was just there with him one day and his best friend the next day. A courteous handshake turned quickly into midnight food excursion and formal Shield meetings turned quickly into midday lunches in Tony’s lab, watching a genius at work and trying to get him to at least share a ham sandwich.
Peggy place the phone down on the holder. He office doors slammed against the walls as they whipped open. “Director! The anomaly is opening soon! Confirmed reading match the previous times!” She quickly walked around to the other side of her desk, stepping close to the scientist “Where is Anthony?”
Who was Peter’s other parent? The person he was fated to marry or at least have a child with. Peter definitely had his features, he was a Stark through and through, but it was interpreting the other half of Peter that was going to be tough for Tony. Who gave him his attitude, the niceness, the moral compass so to speak. Nothing was a giveaway so far but maybe he could get it out of Peter soon. A heads up on who to talk to at a party or an event would be pretty sweet, even if they hated Tony later, at the moment, he wanted to make sure he got Peter in his life. Because If Tony liked the kid now, then older him must sure as hell love him to pieces.
broke the silence and kind of regretted it once he had. “In the morning Peter, we’ll say bye to ourselves, then once we are home. I need to talk to you about Buck.”
Peter opened his mouth to speak but was lost for words. How do you tell someone after that moment, that you were going to leave soon, that you could never stay? “That’s very kind of you to say Mrs Stark.” He leaned into her side, this was strange, he’d never met his grandmother, his Dad didn’t speak that much about her, she seems a little high strung, but sweet when she came to his Dad… and today would be the last time he ever sees her.
Barton has his back pressed against the wall, blind firing out the window, until the bullets stopped. Barton pulled out his communicator device. “Shield support required at target’s location and satellite/CCTV images of the city being monitored for the suspect, medical team required for the Captain.” Steve rolled off of Natasha, lying out of breath on his back. “I’m getting pretty sick of being shot!” His hand raced down to grip the side of his thigh, trying to stop the bleeding.
“You gave him the watch? Good call, I think he needs it, don’t you? Whatever it takes to get him home Tony we are not alone. His family are trying from their end, he just needs to stay strong and stay patient. Which is definitely a family weakness.” The rustling of fabrics could be heard from the other end, Steve was heading to bed.
. The man he’d wish he could have become, a family, a husband, out and proud, a brilliant son, a home and a sense of contentment that he’d never felt before entering the ice. Maybe this was always going to happen.
“Howard.” Steve stepped forward, just one step. “I’ll be taking leave for the next month. In that time, I do not want to hear a word out of your mouth. I’m not coming over to your house, to drink and watch you wish away your life with your drinking buddies who just want your money.” Steve readjusted his neck, cracking it to the side. “You are going to leave Tony alone. That was our deal.”
“Ok…just… give me a couple of minutes, I would like a chance to look back and remember some memories of Tony…” Pierce rolled his eyes but nodded, he turned to knock on the door to notify the guard that he was ready to leave. Peggy’s eyes met Steve’s, she shook her head slightly, appalled at the idea that Steve would go along with something this dangerous.
Steve walked over the metal gate that was connected to the gauntlet, waiting for the gauntlet to spark once again. “Good luck Captain.” He gave a nod to his team and turned towards the anomaly. Taking a deep breath, clutching tightly at the straps of his shield, he stepped through.
Peggy was touched by Peter’s story, it was nice to know that her godson turned out safe and well. That he achieves greatness even after Howard’s constant hatred of everything he does, no matter how much Tony tried to please him, Peggy knew that Howard was no longer the good man she knew during the war. Maria Stark was a woman who knew she had reached her place. A good scientist for Shield a few decades ago, there was no doubt that Tony was going to be genius, but she lost her passion after Howard decided to live the socialist life style.
Clint had decided that there was no more need for doom and gloom, so in usual Clint fashion, he changed the subject back, “So once we catch this crazy 80 years assassin what’s everyone doing for Christmas.” Natasha responded immediately, “House arrest.” Steve didn’t stop staring at her, “I’m avoiding the Stark household, so that Howard actually sees his kid this year, so I’ll probably just continue renovating my old home.”
design us at every development.” Steve wasn’t too please about the missile improvement, but it was so Tony to be ahead of everyone else in the world. “Are you surprised?” He asked the semi sarcastic question. “No, but it is a reason to have a very large target painted on my godson’s head.”
Peter and Tony’s Fort was considerably smaller. But it was freaking fun to build. By the end of the night the fort was slightly collapsing but they didn’t care that much, having Chinese takeaway while on the floor watching Star Wars on VHS. It was a pretty unique day.
“You alright kid, you look like you’re high on something, could explain how you ended up in my flat but even you look a bit young to be partying like that … I’m Tony, by the way and you are?”  The young Tony asked, rubbing the middle of his forehead.
Steve had sat up and gave Natasha a quick nod as he got up to follow Peter through to his room. Making his way into the room, he stood behind Peter, looking over his shoulder. The suit lay flat out over the duvet, the sleeves had a few notable tears, slashes across the fabric in various places, some still covered in flecks of bloody. The mask sat at the top, noticeably discoloured from the rest of the suit, the dust had settled in the corners of the eye pieces. The black outline of the goggles had began to flake off small chips of plastic. Steve felt a sharp pain in his heart, the fear of seeing the suit in the state that it was currently in. His mouth fell open ever so slightly, tears formed in his eyes.
“Which reminds me, I need to head and see my family. So I’ll be back tomorrow morning for training then!  Borrowing the jet Tony, thanks ill bring it back tomorrow! Full tank of fuel. Gotta go now bye!” Clint rushed out the last sentence as he jumped back into the elevator.
Peter cried out in surprised, grinning, he scrambled onto his feet, tripping on the edge of the rug to get to the door. Pulling it open towards him, in his excitement, he tore it off its hinges and allowed it to slam against the wall. It lay splintered on the floor, Sprinting down the stairs and across the open area, elated Peter collided with his Pops chest.
His Dad was definitely worse than his Pops, he didn’t have super solider serum to keep him healthy, his eyes lacking their usual spark, his suit jacket crumpled on the floor in the background, his shirt completely gone for one of his Pop’s sports shirts. A zipper on his shoulders, his skin generally paler than usual, his parents looked worse than the time his Dad locked himself in the workshop for 6 days straight, Pops wouldn’t even let Peter see his Dad because he thought it would scare him.
Barton and Steve were discussing the details of the shooter as Peter and Tony walked over. Steve stood up as Peter approached, he purposely fronted up on Peter, “What the hell were you thinking kid? Do you have a death wish? If Barton hadn’t stepped in, you’d be dead.” Peter stood his ground. Glaring up at Steve, “I had it under control, besides I only got close to him to grab this.” Peter reached in to his pocket and pulled out the patch from the shooter’s arm. Opening his palm so the five of them could see it. Steve, Barton and Romanoff sucked in a breath. The patch showed 6 tendrils coming from the centre skull. Tony and Peter just shrugged at each other as the others shared a worried look. Barton looked at Steve for answers “Steve, if that’s … then they’re back…”
He owned Stark industries now, he could keep his promise. Scrambling over to the cream phone on the wall, he dialled his office. “It’s Stark, yeah yeah, I know I’ll sign it later. I want you to get me the entire Howling Commandos exhibit from the Smithsonian.” He waited, rolling his eyes and his upper body down in exaggeration, holding the phone between his shoulder and ear, “Yes the entire collection, especially the Captain America stuff. I don’t care how much, put it in arts fund. I know it's going to take time, Hire someone then!
“I have a date.” Well that shocked Peter. He kind of just expected Tony to say Steve was back, “What do you mean you have a date? With who?” Tony stood up, lifting his head up with a cheeky smirk on his face. “hmm, let’s compare names shall we! what a good idea!” Peter shook his head, laughing a little, “Nope, can’t spoil your entire life for you Tony.” It’s actually just the weird idea of seeing his Dad actually go on a date that wasn’t his Pop, he knew his father used to be a playboy but that was definitely all finished before he was born.
He threw Howard across the room, allowing him to fall to the ground by the door. Steve stalked towards the man on the floor, “Howard, you don’t seem to get it, I hate bullies and yet here you are in front of me, telling me that I shouldn’t be friends with Tony because he’s not ‘good enough’ for me?! He’s Tony Stark genius creator and philanthropist, you can’t even say you know where he lives!” The Captain bent down to pick Howard up again, little effort necessary and he pushed him into the office doors.
Peggy thumped her elbows down on top of her desk, agitated, she ran her hands through her head. She’d need to call them back. An idea came to her. She stopped for a second to think it through. Leaning forward cautiously, she reached for the phone. “I need Romanoff. Just Romanoff. Bring the other two back for a medical check then send them out again. No contact with the civil world. Thank you.”
He sat down on the bed again, mindlessly stirring his dinner into some form of edible food. “Do we need to keep hiding for Shield Peter? They could help.” Peter rolled his lower jaw around his mouth. Pissed off was probably the best description. “We don’t need them. I’m safer this way. I’m not going home, so I need to make this sustainable. The moment Shield give up trying to get me home, they are going to probably going to torture me for details about the next twenty or so years. My Da- Stark made it clear he doesn’t want me around and Rogers is a lonely no-show at the moment.”
“Tony.” Tony’s head slowly leaned back and looked up to see Rhodey. He gave a gentle smile. “Honey bear!
Tony took the last step forward before Steve could reach him, Steve took his hand in his own, yanking his friend wrist down, catching him into his lap, wrapping his arms around Tony’s shoulders and waist, catching Tony as he let out a rough shout of surprise from the fall, Tony took a second to look up at Steve. “Hey Ste.”
“I’m being chased? Hunted? I’m not sure if he was after me or you to be perfectly honest but he’s called the Winter soldier, i’ve seen him a few times, never more than a moment before I just leave, sometimes I didn’t grab my stuff, I just ran. He terrifies me dad.” Peter was barely audible as he finished. Steve was close to losing it, if he was honest with himself, he just wanted to get Peter home then go find this Soldier who thinks it’s ok to threaten his son, or anyone for that matter. “Pops, I don’t know what to do. He’s going to find here. I can’t… I’m so tired of it.” Steve wrapped his arm around Peter’s shoulder, pulling him into his chest as the tears burst through the dam. Peter’s body was wrecked by the sobs as his Pop’s heart broke.
Barton used his knife to slowly pull out the last bullet fragment. It dropped down onto the floor next to him. Making a soft clunk noise as it hit the floor. Steve's eyes rolled into the back of his head when he saw the MedEVAC team burst through the door with a crash kit. He closed his eyes just to he didn’t need to deal with the paramedics, he used one of their shoulders to help him get up and limp out towards the Shield ambulance. The walk down the stairs quickly becoming a hop down on one leg.
“This just appeared in our office, It appeared at 10:12am and has continued to grow to the size it is now. We have no control over it, but it is showing signs of some sort of time dilation, the office clock,” The scientist gestured to a digital black clock that was sat on a desk near the anomaly, it jumped between two times, back and forth between 14:43 and 15:09, “possibly the time on the inside or start of the anomaly.” The scientist reported to the Director and the general audience around her.
“But I don’t want to lose anymore family, I will forgive you, only if Steve forgives you, my life has been lonely, but his…” He didn’t hope that Steve truly missed him, that would be extremely selfish of him, to think that Steve would mourn him, “ he believes that everyone he knows in his life is dead. You keep taking people away from him. But I’m about to come back from the dead, so if he can forgive you, then I will too.” Tony looked up to his aunt, she flew forward into his arms, he clutched her in his chest, falling back to land on his butt. He wrapped his arms around her back, crying quietly into her shoulder. She sniffled, taking her hand up to his cheek, “You are very kind Anthony. I’m so very sorry for what I have done to you and I hope you can forgive me.” Tony nodded into her side.
rolled his shoulders, glancing back at a watchful Clint, bow slung across his back keeping an eye on his younger self, lost in thought, staring off into the distance behind the truck. Strange he thought to himself, what he would look like without Tony in his life, or at least younger him was about to get a big shock that in fact they hadn’t fucked up the timeline and that his Tony was just waiting for them when they got back.
“Come here Petey, please, it’s late and I want to be awake when I hear it all.” Tony held out his hand for Peter to take. Peter’s grin couldn’t get any bigger, nearly tripping on the oversized pj trousers as he scrambled forward on to the bed, crawling up and between his parents. Tony rolled to jump off the covers,
“Captain Rogers, it has come to our attention that an insider leaked sensitive information to you about the nature of Peter Stark, who was the traitor who leaked the-“ Steve had really had enough of Director Pierce’s nonsense. “You mean the information that would have nothing to do with the fact, that Peter was MY SON. And that you had no right to hide that information from me!”
“Only a little Shell-head. Watch your back till I get back, will you? How’s the kid?” Peter could hear faint mumbling of a TV on Steve’s end of the conversation, clearly the team of spies had checked into a hotel for the night.
The last couple were the most recent, they had been blue-tacked on top of the other’s edges. The first two caught Peter off guard, they had a very young Pepper Potts at a party with Tony, already done with him at 21, Peter let out a laugh at his Aunt’s exasperated face. The last few he recognised from the day before he left, the ones from the party, ones he didn’t recognised, had his parents passed out asleep, Tony fully asleep on top of Steve, Steve had one arm bent behind his head, the other curled around Tony’s back. The pair had red party cups stacked high on top of them, Rhodey’s signature was signed in the bottom, proud of his work. The last one, Peter actually reached out and took from the walk, the polaroid was worn in the corners, Steve and Tony laughing, faces red with tear streaks from laughter, this might have been one of the earliest selfies taken by the pair, they looked so young, they had happier smiles that his parents could do. After everything his parents had been through, it was surprising that they could still smile at the world.
“Drinks on me next month Anthony!  You, me and the grand bar in the New York Tower? What do you say?” Stane leaned over the top of Tony his arm resting on the wall next to him, his presence trying to over shadow Tony. Peter stood up, making his body as intimidating as possible. This was just ugly and uncomfortable flirting. “Ok, like you said, I’m up now, I saw you Stane, time to leave so I can ‘get up and go.’” Peter tried to channel his Pop’s attitude toward sleazy characters, ‘always act like the bigger man, kill them with kindness.’
“Just we miss you Peter, We love you and don’t forget,” Tony looked up to Steve and back towards the camera, “You’re a Roger, stay strong and use that big brain of yours and help us get you home.” A loud clatter from behind the pair distracted them both from the camera. Peter even looked off in the distance of the workshop in the video. His family were walking into the lab from the garage door entrance, carrying large bags of supermarket snacks and pizza boxes into the lab. All dressed in joggers and Avengers hoodies the team walked up to his parents. “What’s going on Tony?” Bruce dropped two pizza boxes next to the couple.
How hard can it be!” Thor smiled with a wide cheeky grin at the small group, pretending to exaggeratedly type over Tony’s keyboard. Tony nodded slowly, coming around on the idea.
Peter’s smiled stay on his face as he introduced himself, “Peter, uh friend of Tony Stark, happy to help with anything?” Peter’s confusion at his own statement made Edwin give a small laugh, Tony stood next to Jarvis, “J, he’s a cool kid, he doesn’t want the ‘Stark’ Welcome!” Edwin raised his eyebrows at Tony with a small understanding ‘oh!’ on his face. Jarvis walked up to Peter and took him in a tight hug, “Well welcome Peter, I hope you enjoy your stay with us.” Peter gripped the back of Jarvis jacket tightly. Tony leaned against the stained glass on the front doors, happy at the sight in front of him. Jarvis wasn’t a young man in anyway and Tony never thought he would have kids, so to see his… parental figure, meeting his son. It almost brought a tear to his eye, he was now determined more than ever to tell Jarvis who Peter was.
Tony startled awake. Blinking his eyes widely. He looked around the room, taking in everyone. The front door slammed but Maria continued to play. Howard walked into the room, opening one of the door sized windows slightly, to allow a breeze in, the dessert coloured curtains flowed in the breeze. Tony pulled the blanket over his head again. Howard rolled his eyes. Taking his own deep breath, fixing his cufflinks as he went. He pulled the covers off Tony. “Could you dress any more like a homeless slob. Come on, get up, say goodbye.”
Peggy leaned over the edge of the railing next to Coulson and watched as Steve ran off across the atrium, Peggy turned her head towards the young agent, “That’s going to cost a bit to repair, should we leave it until they return back to their time?” Peggy chuckled lightly, patting Coulson on the shoulder before assembling her security team to formulate a plan. Coulson stood and watched Steve run through the double door on the far end of the atrium. He stepped back from the railing and chuckled to himself, “Captain America knows my name! He gave me a task!”Coulson broke off in a sprint down the stairs towards his office, to print out the info.
Steve couldn’t imagined that he was still Captain America with a family and a kid to raise, then again, Peter had know the shield with a strong familiarity that Steve hadn’t seen from anyone else. Maybe it was a relic of his time at Shield? Either way the fact of the matter was, he wasn’t going to get that life anymore. He had fucked up and there was no going back into the ice to fix it this time. Howard was dead, his best friend dead and his future son, dead before he even knew him. He needed to go back to church, he wanted a confessional for his sins to bad his punishment had been served earlier. He shook his head of his thoughts when he heard a faint tapping coming through the pipes.
“LEAVE!” He pointed his finger right in his face, “DON’T COME BACK, YOU RUIN EVERYTHING! LEAVE ME AND MY LIFE, ALONE!” his breathing was erratic “I HATE YOU!”
“I’ll stand right beside you the whole time but Peter, he’s just a kid and to be honest with you Tony, what would you have wanted him to say? To stop them? He probably wouldn’t exist if it hadn’t happened.” Steve gave a gentle squeeze of Tony hand as he let out a breathy sigh, “He adores his parents and quiet rightly so when it comes to you, I just… please try to forgive him?”
“You know, your Uncle Thor has prepared a feast for a king, a full table spread for when you get home, we didn’t know if you wanted to spend the night with us or not, so your room is clean if you want to just sleep. And my therapist will visit when you’re ready for a chat, if you want?” Steve was taken aback slightly by
. He could never have imagined how the two meeting would have gone but now, the dream played in his mind, Buck would have figured it out pretty quickly, probably taking some time to get use to the fact that his best friend was… openly gay. But he’d tease him about Tony and his long time crush, probably force him to hang out with Tony more, dress up in his Sunday best for just going to the movie. He’d hope that they would get along, Buck would likely have been irritated by Tony but would get use to him for Steve, he’d probably been the reason they’d have gone on at least a date.
Steve left the warehouse, walking outside in the early hours of the morning there was a very cold breeze making its way inland. The Shield SUV pulled up next to Steve, the window at the front rolls down. “Hop in Captain,” Natasha says, “Shield just got intel about the ‘Winter Solider’, he’s just attacked a motor cade of Stark Industries file transports 6 miles outside of the city. 5 dead.” Steve opened the door and jumped in, chucking the shield over his shoulder and through the median. “Ow!” Barton cried out from the back seat, “Damn, that thing hurts when it wants too.” Natasha rolled her eyes at Barton’s moans of an injury, driving the car at high speed through the streets of New York city.
“So last night in this flat, what do you want to do?” Peter asked rubbing his eyes on his wrist, to remove any stray tears. Tony surveyed the room. Well the beds are striped, but the TV is still plugged in…” Tony jumped up, energy exploding from his body in excitement.
The argument started 2 hours ago but the last 20 minutes had been devoted solely to Peter and his appearance. “Tony he could be dangerous, he recognised and spotted one of Shield’s top spies from a roof top across the court yard from him. He knew him by name Tony. That’s not possible.” Steve sighed for the millionth time this morning. “I just want you safe Tony, I’m working for Shield to…”
Steve scrambled forward, barely standing up to get next to the man. Dirt kicked up around him as he held his hands over the man, unsure if he could touch, or would he wake up? He turned to look over his shoulder, '
“PETER, DUCK!” As Peter opened his eyes fully he saw the molten liquid whip out towards him, It touched him directly above his left eyebrow. The electric shock to the head pushed Peter back off his feet. As he flew backwards off his feet, his vision was only filled with darkness. The scream of his parents faded out as Peter blacked out.
“Your parents are coming through the garage door now,” Steve held up the garage door as Tony ducked under and signaled for the Iron Man armour to connect with his body. “Peter, SitRep, now!” Steve positioned himself to the side of Tony, while his arm was still bandaged, Steve held the shield as best as he could to protect Tony and his bad arm.
Tony sat down on the edge of the bed, taking in a deep breath to releases the unknown tension off of his shoulders. He began to fiddle with his wedding ring between his finger and thumb, He gave a soft smile to the wall above his desk, while dust floated in the air like fireflies in the night, disturbed when Tony sat down. Peter loved his photography, when Steve brought out his old camera from his war bike, they had thought it would have been a complete wreck, a trinket that was far from salvageable
The aircraft jolted as it landed in the car park. Steve clicked the buckle loose. Standing up and grabbing his shield he made his way out the back of the loading ramp. Looking out into the forest, guess he was jogging to the cabin, he and Peter had missed their trip this year, Steve sighed. Steve straightened his back, he’d have his son back in a couple of hours. He started his jog up the trail’s path.
“T… is this about what Howard said… You know I meant every word. I do consider you my … best friend, always will but I’m built specifically to take the hits, you’re just Tony, I just... I need you to live T, I couldn’t live in the 90s without you.”
“If you must know, I’m glad I sent you for that mission this summer, in truth I thought it would be a walk in the park for you, but I really just wanted you to get away from Anthony. See some perspective on life, I mean It was a good call for you to be there when the mission turned south but really Ste. You needed to stop being a people pleaser for him, don’t let him distract you. You don’t need art school you need to be where you belong.”
“Yeah, I want you nearby, no bullet taking just, a nearby hero.” Tony said while opening the new wooden bedroom door, they had been waiting on paint to be delivered before having a go at painting the doors, guided in by Tony’s arm, Steve inspected the room, he hadn’t been back here since just before he shipped out. It was his parents’ room, even though it hadn’t been that, for well over 50 years. He’d thrown out some of the furniture, rotten with the damp. Renovating the place was slow progress, however, Steve was determined to have the place back in working order, not that he disliked Boston, but this was home.
Steve gently slid Tony off of him and gave one last pat on the back before heading out to grab his meal and head to his room. Demolishing the meal quickly Steve sat with his back leaning against the headboard and legs stretched out straight, leaving the bowl of food on his bedside table. Sliding down under the blanket, Steve let sleep take him, knowing tomorrow, he was going to have to chat to Tony for the first time in almost 6 months and report back to Shield on this Peter kid. He felt a bit shady for doing it but the kid was strange that was for sure, but it bought him time back with Tony so he didn’t really mind.
“We’re aren’t going to win this!” Steve tried to yell over the noise. Natasha gripped at her side, bruises were going to form. “I’ve got a tracker on the first truck but we can’t lose both of them, can we try and get the driver out of this one?” Steve nodded. He positioned his arms ready to launch Natasha to the top of the truck. Firing her up into the air Natasha rolled into a landing on top of the driver cab. Steve pulled himself up onto the roof, reaching down to pull up his shield. Throwing it to the winter solider who dodged out of the way. But it was enough to catch Clint’s attention. He ran backwards towards the truck, leaping the gap, shooting out the drive as Natasha jumped in the passenger side to take control.
“Peter, the door, Mr Stane Is coming.” Peter threw the blanket on the floor over the suit on the bed. He grabbed his jumper and threw it over the mask. He threw himself over on to the bed. Just as the door opened, Stane stepped through before Tony could get in his way, “—Tony, he’s young but he can’t sleep in until what’s the time?”
Once Howard cleared the corner, Maria turned her attention back to Steve, taking his chin in her hand, moving his head side to side, inspecting his appearance. She let out a quiet Hmm, but Steve could hear it. “No matter what my husband says or anyone else for that matter.” She took a small step back and whispered to him, “I beg you Captain, please do what you must to protect Tony.” Steve immediately nodded. “You must mean it Captain, I fear Howard’s ghost are catching up with him, and I do not want Tony caught up in the crossfire. He needs someone to look out for him.” Steve took her hand in his. “I promise Mrs Stark. Tony is my friend, I will do what I can.” Maria whispered a thank you.
felt Tony just let out a long breath, For a while they thought they weren’t going to hear that voice again, that excitement the slight break of a young man’s voice, arms everywhere when telling his story but tonight,
“If you need to go through to get him,” Steve turned back to Tony and walked back to wrap himself up in Tony’s embrace. “You better give him a big hug from me, a good meal and wrap him up in every blanket under the sun.” The pair let out a pained chuckle between themselves. “Promise?”
Peter nodded, not trusting his voice to carry him through another conversation. Tony gripped tightly on to Peter’s hand and lead him through to Steve’s room. He sat Peter on the edge of the bed. Tony cautiously took a step back and walked into the cupboard, reaching up to pull a very dusty shoe box off the shelf. He sat the box next to Peter and knelt down on to the ground in front of the bed. Peter’s hand rested in his lap. No energy left to move. “Before we go back to campus, I think you should hold on to this until you head home. Steve gave it to me last summer while we were fixing up this place.” Tony lifted the lid carefully off the top of the box. A couple of boxes sat covered in a thin layer of dust, Tony reached in and took out the one that seemed the cleanest.
As she reached out to grab Steve’s wrist he stopped and turned on the spot, Peggy ran straight into Steve’s chest. Steve raised one eyebrow and looked down at Peggy. “Steve, I’m sorry, I’m so damn sorry.” Peggy wrapped her arms tight around Steve’s waist. He hesitated before wrapping his hands round her back. “Peter is somewhere in the mountains, I’ll get someone to get you all the intel.” Steve relaxed his muscles, “Peggy, just… promise me you’ll start answering to yourself. Pierce and his followers are not good for Shield. Fix it.” Steve pushed back slightly, “I need to find my son and take him home.” Peggy let out a tearful laugh. “If that is what it takes for you to forgive me then I promise I will do it.” She took a full step back and held Steve at arms length, looking up and down Steve’s appearance. “You’re finally looking as old as me!” Steve let out a huff, she laughed lightly, like a bird fluttering its wings, she vaguely motioned her hand over her face and chin, “The beard, it suits you.” Steve smirked, bolstered by the compliment, puffed up his chest.
Tony stood up, a new spring in his step from his nap. “This is exactly what I love about coming home for Christmas, right before you leave town again.” Tony bounced on his feet, trying to push down the confrontational tone popping up. Howard took his hand out of his pocket to dramatically pull the Santa hat off Tony’s head. Jarvis, nodded his head into the room, “The car is ready to go sir.” Howard nodded and Jarvis made his way through to the back of the house.
Tony hesitated before throwing his arms, around Peter’s shoulders. Peter didn’t count how long he stood there holding his Dad but he knew that a relationship like that with Howard Stark doesn’t leave a lot of room for self-appreciation. They took a step back from each other, “Let’s get packing shall we?” Peter said with a calming tone and smile. “Actually I need you to run to the corner store and get the newspapers. We need to find a flat quickly.” Peter forgot for a moment that technology wasn’t the way it should be in the 90s. Peter quickly walked over and shut the curtains blocking any view into the apartment in case Uncle Clint was watching. Peter flicked his wrist Web-shooters, the blue holographic projection lighting up their faces. Tony’s eyes lit up with the blue glow and the wonder of this technology (again he dare not tell Peter of last night) . He was amazed (again).
“I’ll be fit for training tomorrow, for today, it’s a family day.” Steve signaled behind him to the photos laid out of the large glass table.
keeps Tony alive by feeding and watering him, taking him outside every once in a while but Tony just gives
He sighed, condensation forming on the glass in front of him, don’t blame Steve, don’t get mad or upset, don’t do something stupid like… cry in front of him. What would he say? ‘Hey Steve how have you been? I’ve been busy with work and having sooo much fun without you.’ He rolled his eyes at himself, ‘Steve, I miss you, i’ve kept your room nice and tidy if you want to come home, or…’
Peter stepped forwards with a wide grin, looking up at Steve as he stepped towards him and his dad. barely making eye contact with them, “Hey Steve,” Peter stood between them. “Hi Peter, been a while.” Peter nodded back, Steve saw the innocent smile of a youthful kid free of stress for the first time since he met him. “Steve, I’d like you to meet my Pops, but I guess you figured that out already.”
“Kid, must really miss his parents.” Steve felt bad for the kid, he’s been through a lot, all the travelling was exhausting. Tony nodded, he threw himself on to the couch and Steve lifted him again to sit down underneath Tony’s body. “You ok after the flight? I know the wound is gone but knowing you, it still hurts, and you won’t tell me.” Steve chucked, Tony raising slightly up and down with Steve’s chest. “You’re right, I wouldn’t tell you if it hurt.”
and Clint marched quickly down the hallway to a locked down. Clint stepped aside, gesturing out for Steve to ‘go right ahead.’ Steve boot kicked the door off of his hinges.
“Not another one of you!” Tony opened his eyes to stare at a pair of smart navy high heels. He lifted his head to find his Aunt Peggy, much younger than he last saw her but this aunt certainly looked far more exhausted. Tony stood up, cricking his neck, he adjusted his suit. “Anthony…” Peggy took in this man in front of her, the spitting image of her godson. Peter’s father, a grown man, married and working as the head of a team of superheroes, not the young insecure boy in his father’s shadow.
Steve kept rolling his shoulder and cricking his neck. He wasn’t a happy old man. They’d lied to him, again. First when they woke him up in the stupid movie set and didn’t even bother to do their research, which kind of, insulted him a little. But this was too far. The doors opened and Steve marched past the reception desk, opening the doors and gesturing for Barton and Romanoff to close them behind them.
“ NO!  you can’t it’s bad enough that I’m here but like my blood like leaves a footprint of me being here, and if it gets into the wrong hands It could change the course of science! And to the rest of your questions, yes, yes, yes and no I don’t feel the blood rushing to my head up here.” Peter thought about the effects his blood could have in this time period. His mind wandered to the thought of his Uncle Bruce testing out his super solider serum on himself in a few years’ time, if he’d had access to his blood, things might have ended up a little different for him. Peter did have some of his Pop’s super strength and speed from just being his son but not enough to ever worry about but once the spider bit him, his Pop’s serum activated in his blood.
Peter landed in a roll on the next roof top, he activated the suit expansion button to rapidly pull on the mask, “Karen, track him!” Peter yelled out to Karen as he leaped across the next building. He could just hear the blood rushing in his ears, his heartbeat on over drive and the sound of his feet pounding against the gravel covered roof tops of the MIT Campus.
being going easy on you in the future, you haven’t even managed to lay a single finger on me yet.” Peter rolled over on to his back, using his upper arm strength he pushed himself up on to his feet.
Steve looked past Tony to notice his old war tin on the bed side table, half wrapped in one of Tony’s t-shirts. Steve gave a soft smile, he knew Tony wouldn’t donate his stuff, but he was glad to see Tony knew how much it meant to him. Peter had a soft smile on his face watching his dads interact, he could see his parents in their younger selves. Pops would always make sure his Dad would sleep at reasonable times, even if he was sleeping on top of Pops.
“So then why is time sped up for me?” Thor voice peaked slightly, “Ah young Peter, these creatures are of Asgard’s realm. They have a very short life span from birth to death, It seems the gauntlet advances time quickly to save the life of the creature, so that they can actually live long enough to make a change in history.” Peter just sat staring at his Uncle with an unimpressed look. “So, time is moving quicker for me because an alien race, dies young, so to actually live a longer life, it can speed up time. Or at least my perception of time?”
“So, future boy, what’s it like?” Natasha closed her eyes, a soft smile graced her face. Peter smiled up at her, “You are my Aunty Natasha, you are teaching me European languages, we booked a trip to Venice as test with Unc.. another Uncle of mine and hand to hand combat! I’m shooting up the Shield ranks like my Pops did!” Peter’s arms flailed with excitement. Natasha glanced down at him, bemused. “really?” The sort of exaggerated excitement that comes with entertaining a young child. “Yeah and I’m learning archery from Uncle Clint and Dad’s teaching me about engineering with the web-shooters and Pops, well he was rest a broken arm before I left.”
Steve turned to look out the window on to the main complex structure. “A government’s scientific laboratory is no safe place for a kid to be hanging around.” Peter harrumphed in disagreement, “I’m part of the team, I’m one of the people who creates the danger.” Tony smirked at Peter’s response, impressed by it. “When your parents get back and we explain the situation to them, I’ll be having words about irresponsibility for their attitude to your safety.”
Steve crossed his arms in thought. “Very specific target then, so is he usually faster at this plan and attack method? Why is he always spotted before not after?” The trio walked toward a cafeteria table with 6 cheap blue chairs, Steve sat first, Romanoff second with her coffee and Barton third, pulling out another burger that was wrapped from his pocket. “He’s spotted usually due to high police presence at the assassination or after the fact when assessing photos in the newspapers… but it’s like a title passed down generation, same uniform, same physical loss of an arm. It’s very strange for this not to show up in family traits or unit showing weakness, or a lack of participation if it was the same man, he’d be well over 80 years old.”
“You gonna tell him? Since you won’t tell me?” Barton called out with a smirk. Steve immediately turned his head over his shoulder with narrow eyes. He turned his gaze back to Natasha with furrowed brows. “What is he talking about.” Natasha sighed. She kept her arms straight, gripping the steering wheel. She didn’t break under is watchful gaze. “I’m know for not following the rule.” Steve looked forward and pinched the bridge of his nose, “You took off the handcuffs, didn’t you?” Steve’s rhetorical question made Barton bite back a laugh. “For a good reason, I wanted to know more about Peter, so I climbed through the vents—” Barton cut her off with a quick quip, “Girl after my own heart!” Steve crossed his arms, he couldn’t wait to hear what trouble this pair got into.
Are you here to take me home?” Tony looked so young, so lost. Rhodey smiled in the corner of his mouth, taking Tony’s hand in his to pull him up. Tony politely shoved the women out the way of the booth so he could climb down. Tony let go once he was upright and followed Rhodey back towards the front door. He stopped just before the threshold. Rhodey turned and watched as Tony’s hand that gripped the door frame, shook violently.
“Dinner is Served!” Ana called from down the hall. Maria ran her hands through his hair one more time, before Tony made a motion to get up, Peter watched as Tony held his hand out to help his mother up out of her chair, she stood up, took off her suit jacket and laid it down at the back of the chair.
Getting changed he decided that he needed to tidy his room as he hadn’t unpacked yet but before he could Jarvis invited him downstairs for a late lunch with himself and Ana. Peter followed Jarvis down to the kitchen. The trio sat in relative quiet until they heard Howard and Maria call for help from Jarvis, who quickly made his way up to help. Peter rubbed his hair in different directions and decided to get up and check on Tony. He ran into Howard as stepped into the hallway. Peter almost wanted to growl at him. God where was Pops when you need him.
Fury scoffed adjusting his jacket, “How do you even know the Captain America’s clearance? Stark, you must know that just because your father was a Director, that it doesn’t give you access to everything Shield does.” Crossing his arms, Fury stood by Peggy, watching Tony with his good eye. “Captain America, may be America’s pride but Steve likes to drop his suit’s laundry on the floor like a hellish flatmate when he get’s back from a mission, his clearance pass likes to lie around the floor of the flat until he needs it again.”Tony turned to walk down the hall toward’s his guest office/bed room, when he stopped short of the hallway door. He gripped the handle tightly before letting it go. “Also it’s Captain Rogers or Steve. Don’t confuse your pride and joy of human perfection with the soldier from Brooklyn.” Tony turned to leave once more. Pushing open the door he stopped as Fury called out to him, his voice echoing down the hall.
Before Steve could answer Peter decided it was time to poke his head round the corner, “Morning guys!” Even Peter knew that was not smooth. Tony and Steve turned their heads to look at Peter. Steve slowly backed away from Tony, “I’ll tell you why later, ok T?” The use of the nickname if you could call a letter a nickname softens Tony’s expression, “Ok… but Peter is staying ok? He’s a kid, don’t bring him into your secret spy world ok?” Steve wrapped his arms around Tony in a surprise hug, but Tony held on back, both glad that they could just be friends again.
Thank you all for your continued support on this story and hope you enjoy this chapter, hoping to have the next one up soon! x
Peter jumped into the back of the SUV with Tony, whose conversation had moved on to Howard. “He’s not at the compound, is he?” Tony asked politely but with a hit of desperation leaking through. “No, of course not Tony, Howard hasn’t left his office in decades, as if he’s going to actually appear at a local Shield office today. I wouldn’t put you through that.” Peggy honesty allowed Tony to relax and smile a bit, “We just need to confirm some details about Peter and where you are living, then you are free to go home and study, I hope.” She gave a parental look to the two boys across from her. Peter just politely nodded whereas Tony snorted, under his breathe he laughed.
It took 8-year-old Peter and his parents all day to build but this fort took up the entire kitchen and living room of the Stark Tower. Steve was surprisingly hand when it came to building forts and loved to spend the time watching as Peter worked out the complex physics of stress and balance to build a balcony on the fort. Steve and Peter decorated the insides with rooms and doors, colour coordinating each corridor, and creating a dining table out of cardboard boxes. Steve eventually carried through his and Tony’s super king mattress and placed it directly in front of the TV. By the end of the night the Stark family fort had been invaded by his Aunts and Uncles with peace offering Pizza.
“I’m just happy to see you Thor, is Pops ok? I didn’t get to see him much before the anomaly shut. How did you even get here?” Peter was standing in front of his, Uncle the fabrics of his Uncle’s cap blowing in the invisible wind, the distinct smell of home surrounded him, a mixture of engine oil, a hint of the fresh forest air that surrounds the compound and chalk dust from his Pop’s boxing ring.
“So, gotta start the questions somewhere, how about tennis questions, you ask one and then I’ll ask one. I’ll go first, Where are you from?” Peter raised his head to Tony with a smile, they had blasted through the vegetable chopping and now were assembling the pasta bake in the casserole dish. “Ok, uh, born in New York, lived in the Upper East Side District until a couple of years ago when we moved out of the city. My turn uh… Where are we anyway, like on a map kind of thing?” Tony chuckled at the question, but he kept in mind the answer to his question. Peter was as brash as he was certainly spoke with New York tone as he does, but well-spoken in general. Once they had placed the dish in the oven, Peter automatically set about tidying up the mess from the assembling of the dinner, Tony could only watch as Peter started to clear a space to eat the dinner together.
Peter decided that it would be best to shower and get changed for the day, start afresh with Tony when woke up from him nap. Shutting his bedroom door behind him, Peter began to strip off his clothes from the morning walk, he picked out a pair of blue jeans, a worn but fitted black crew neck jumper. Walking through to the shower room, he tried to relax his mind.
I removed this before uploading to keep myself straight, definitely should have kept it! But until I come round to edit the whole story, I'll fix it with a quick edit!
“Cereal is in the top cupboard there or there is toast, I’m just going to grab a chair to bring the cereal down.” Tony said as he went to grab one of the dinner room chairs that didn’t have any paper work stacked on top of it.
“I think I look like Dad the most in this one!” Peter held the polaroid up to the light, angling it to get a better look at the finer details of the photo. “Dad, what are you wearing?” Tony took the photo, “Your Pop’s painting hoodie, we forgot to pay our heating bill and I literally only owned like seven clean t-shirts. We were miserable in the cold but we wore those hoodies for 3 days solid.” His parents both laughed at the memory.
“You are currently rocking out on campus at M.I.T, we are just North West of Boston city and before you ask I’m here to get my PHD and this is my last year here.” Tony did a dramatic spin as he spoke, “Ok, What do you do Peter, I know you said you were 17 but you seem pretty smart?” come on genius child, come on, come on, Tony thought to himself, it wasn’t the end of the world but you know, bragging rights and peace of mind, another genius to talk to.
The two back doors of the ambulance slammed shut and Steve pulled himself up and on to the gurney. He leaned back on to the bed and closed his eyes when a pillow hit him square in the face. He didn’t even open his eyes as he moved the pillow behind him to prop up his head. “Captain, I’m Doctor Willems, are you ok with me doing a check on the wound?” A female doctor made her way in from the cabin at the front. Steve nodded. She quick assessed that they had managed to pull out all the fragments correctly and that the serum would heal the wound over in a couple of hours.
“Howard is crafty and selfish.” She continued to stare out of the window, the rain streaking down the glass. “I’m sure in some way he cares for Anthony but right now all I see at Directors meetings is a selfish, arrogant man. I can’t help but feel that he’s going to get Anthony killed and I cannot stand for that Steve.” Steve was staring down at his hands, his gloves worn, and blood soaked from his earlier wound. His mind couldn’t help but flash to the image of holding a dead Tony in his arms. His uniform soaked in blood as he tried to stop the bleeding.  Oh, how different the break in at the apartment could have gone if Shield had not brought him back to spy on the kid. He could’ve had another dead best friend. The scene was indistinguishable between Bucky and Tony at this point.
Steve shook his head. “They don’t work for me kid. I’ll be fine in an hour or so.” Peter felt numb, anytime his Pops was injured was in charge of making sure he took his pain medication. Steve would always get two pain pills to take and Peter would get two skittles, it was only fair, they would take them together and then his Pops would feel better but… His Pops can’t use painkillers?
The photos then jump from the 1940, to last year in the gardens, Peter had spent the afternoon with Steve, trying to teach him how to use the camera correctly. The collage of that day shared an oversized large black edge frame, plenty of blurry selfies of the pair together, some of his various Uncles and Aunts, Tony’s personal favourite sat in the middle of the collage, the largest one. Peter had taken it without Tony noticing, his arms wrapped around his husband’s neck, Steve’s arms holding on to his waist tightly, they had their eyes shut, smiling at each other in a private moment, Steve’s head bowed to rest on top of Tony’s. Their age truly hidden in the blurry nature of the old lens on the camera.
Peter and Natasha crouched down beneath the view of the window, Natasha raised her gun, ready to fire, Peter placed his last web-shooter capsule into his wrist holster. Terrified, Peter could felt his heart beating through his chest, Peter took some shallow breaths before sliding down the wall. Natasha, quickly aimed her gun to peak through the window. Peter tried to pull her down when she didn’t hide quickly enough for his liking. “Peter…” Peter switched onto his knees, poking his head up to look out the window.
“Overwhelmed again. So, I just said I had already found a place, he was ok with the idea till he found out it was Tony. Then Howard tried everything money could buy, anything to get me to leave. I’m sure he could have just had Shield find us and carry me out, but I guess he knew I was settling so he just had to get over himself.” Natasha watched Steve get lost in the memory of it. His eyes would glaze over, the reflection of the fire shining bright in them. She noticed that he subconsciously rubs his watch, back and forth on his wrist. Peter does the same, just a flash of a thought but impossible for her to forget. Steve shook himself out of his thoughts.
Thor stepped forward ahead of the couple, Lightening shooting out of his open palm, the portal shut with a crash of thunder. Peggy stood motionless. Tony looked to his godmother. Jarvis hit the floor pretty quickly. Peggy rolled her eye as she turned to her staff. “Find the boy, whatever it takes.”
“BullSHIT!?. Are you serious? Show me.” Tony watched with a look of wonder and amusement. Peter turned to face Tony stared him directly in the eye when he jumped flipped and hung from the ceiling, with a rather casual look on his face.”
“Oh also!” Tony clapped his hand down on Peter’s shoulder, “Director Stark or Hellish Howard as I call him, has kept up with Roger’s request, so,” Tony mock standing to attention and gave an exaggerated bow to Peter. “You and I are invited out to the Stark Mansion for the Christmas holidays!” Peter smiled, nodding at the thought, “Sounds good? Do you actually want to go, though?”
kicked the duvet out from under his torso. Once Peter realised what his parents were doing, he reach above his head to the headboard, sticking to it with his finger tips, he lifted his body off the bed.
“So this place is quite different once you’re living here?” Steve realised they were reaching the main entrance of the compound, “Well far less soldiers and scientists about, that’s for sure.” Peter muttered back.
Peter finally could hear the voices of Shield agents making their way towards the cabin. “Target fled in the NorthWest direction, Alpha unit two and three, inspect the cabin and catch up.” Peter watched as Natasha looked for a place to hide. The boots of the guards were getting close to the door. Peter shot a web to the ceiling them to Aunty Natasha’s waist. Giving it a sharp tug, Natasha shot off the ground and up to the ceiling. Before she could let out a sound Peter placed his hand over her mouth and pulled her on to the rafter. The guards kicked open the door and swept the room. Natasha balanced on the beam, gun at the ready incase they even bothered to look up. The guards moved through the cabin.
By the time Peter had finished his shower, got changed, brought his back out into the living room, helped Robert tidy up the entire living room and sat down with Robert to have a coffee and hot chocolate. Tony had finally gotten changed and packed. The trio made their way down to the front door of the apartment block out to the Mercedes business car. Robert opened the door for the back and the pair climbed in. Peter crossed his arms and leaned his head back against the headrest and decided to have a nap before they got there. Peter had just nodded off when Tony decided to grab the car’s business phone, he dialled the number for his Aunt Peggy’s office. The phone rang two times before the crisp voice of his Aunt came through, “Tony! Are you ok?” Tony smiled to himself, “Yes Aunt Peggy just calling to let you know we are heading home for Christmas.”
“Peter, ran out to grab food and shit, so we have snacks to figure out more about you and where you came from, help yourself to anything. Probably best if you don’t leave the apartment for now.
had finally moved from the chair on to the bed next to his husband when Peter’s story showed no signs of ending soon. He threw his arm over Tony’s shoulders and shuffled his body closer to his side. Tony chuckled and Steve could feel it through his bones, It settled deep within him, his little family finally back together. “Peter.”
Steve dropped the bags at the edge of the clearings parking bay. Dropping them roughly in the ground before making his way back, to sit next to Peter. Steve landed a bit roughly on the step, bringing his feet up a step to rest his elbows on his thighs, he took a look around the clearing. “hey, Pops?” Steve turned to look at Peter, a smile graced his face, “Yeah bud?” Peter leaned over, resting his head on his father’s shoulder.
Howard looked down the hall towards him wife, he turned quickly back when Peter started to speak. “No Mr Stark. I’m going to go spend time with Tony, let us know when dinner is ready.” Peter curled his fist by his side. Turning on the spot and marching up the stairs, leaving Howard at the bottom, happy to have the last word against him.
Steve made his way down the hall, avoiding the broken floorboards, noting to himself that he really should get them fixed soon, before he forgets. He opened the bedroom door, to a casual ‘Hey’ to Tony, when he finally raised his head to make eye contact with Tony, he found Tony asleep, lying across the bed in his turquoise boxers, jeans half way up his legs, he likely fell asleep getting ready. Steve noticed the scraps of paper and pen in Tony’s hand, another break through hastily noted down before tiredness over took Tony.
Jarvis stood by and watched as Tony once again lost himself into the work of his father. The smoke infused office didn’t help with the separation between Tony and Howard, his office, a dark space filled with emerald green walls and more liquor than books. Tony had found himself coming to his father’s office most days, sometimes he wouldn’t leave the living room couch for a day or two. But always back here. At work, where he can do better. Everyone is counting on him. He just really wished they didn’t need him all at once. He ran his hand through his hair again, the phone rang on Howar- his desk. Roughly he grabbed the phone, missing his grip once, he must be sobering up. He’d need to fix that. “Stark.” Tony used his hand to nodded and point towards the door for Jarvis and Ana to leave, Jarvis sighed taking his wife’s hand as they left. “Tony, my boy! How’s those designs coming along? Our stock is through the roof in the last months, just doing a house call, checking you’re alright and all that!” Tony thumped his head down onto the desk.
Steve stopped just outside the ruined door, he placed his hands on either side of his hips, lips pulled into a side smirk, Peter huffed awkwardly, letting out a stuttered laugh, “Oops?” he said shrugging his shoulders, giving his best innocent smile, Steve laughs, taking his hand from his hips to Peter’s shoulder, “Peter for weeks I was pulling doors off their hinges, it's no big deal, the wall however, thats going to need some work.” Peter relaxed his head down on to his Pop’s hand.
“Peter, I hope you get this message, you told your Uncle that it’s December 1991, Peter…” His Dad was crying at his desk, his Pops was working far in the background on some large device, but all Peter could see was his Dad’s face tear streaks. “Peter, if you are at the mansion… Peter do NOT go with my parents to Barbados, please don’t be talked into it. Stay at the Mansion, Peter… my parents die the next day, Howard drinks before he leaves, and he crashes the car. Peter just please do not go with them. I can’t lose my son.”
Lost in thought, Peter jumped when Steve called his name. Peter looked up to Steve with tear streaked eyes. “We will head to an old flat I own in Brooklyn. Director Carter has organised a flight for us in an hour. You’ll be ok kid, I promise, I’ll protect you.” Steve didn’t even know how important he was. Peter knew that if he died protecting Peter, Peter would never be born. He literally couldn’t let anyone get hurt. Peter hadn’t realised he wasn’t breathing until he saw his Pop’s hand reach out to catch him before passing out.
Natasha’s sad smile, told an all to common story in her life, how she could no longer believe that this was going to end well. She looked down into her cup. “I don’t want him to know, ok?” She looked up quickly to Steve, his eyes only found comfort in his son’s sleeping smile. “I came here to get him but I don’t know what’s going to happen if we go through, things could have changed for the worst. I’ve taken steps to fix it, just incase but… It might not be enough.” Steve let out a whistle.
“They’re back…?” Peggy took it from Steve’s hand. Steve solemnly nodded. Peggy swallowed her fear, looking to Barton, “Who were they after?” Barton gestured to Tony. “Steve took the bullet, but it was close.” Tony looked between Steve and his Aunt Peggy, worried about the situation between the two. Peggy stared for a minute into the distance and at the scene in front of her, Tony’s lost look as the ambulance lights flashed red and blue on the immediate area. Peggy sighed, “Peter, Tony. Go to the flat, pack a bag of clothes, personal artefacts and supplies. You are staying in a safe house for the immediate future.”
