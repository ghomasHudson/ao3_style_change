“You have glitter lube in your hair,” Cas retorts, and Dean shoves him to the side, only to roll into Cas’ body heat and sling his arm around him.
“This is true, but I met you, and that was quite enough.” She dries her hands on a towel and throws it back onto the counter. “Would you mind if I stayed? I am fine with no presents, but I would like to see Castiel open his.”
“I dislike the idea of you experiencing agony.”
“Hope you know where the closest 7-11 is, because you can go buy your own shitty Bud Light!” Dean calls back, entering the kitchen. Slightly smaller than the family room, it’s still good quality, mostly because when Dean had said he’d wanted a chef’s kitchen, he’d been taken seriously.
“Cas!” he calls, and Cas spots him immediately, making his way over to the booth. Dean tries to move over and create enough room, but he doesn’t make it in time, and Cas must not care, because he drops onto Dean’s lap without hesitation. Dean automatically wraps an arm around his waist and hauls him closer, burying his face in Cas’ hair.
he screams in his head just as much as he screams it to the sky.
Dean latches onto this gratefully, desperate for anything to distract him from what he’s about to do. “Yeah? What’s her name?”
“I’m Castiel,” Cas introduces himself, holding out his hand to Jess. “I work upstairs.”
Dean doesn’t have a chance to ask Cas where the hell he went before they get out on the ice, and Cas is doing a real good job of avoiding his eye too.
“Around here somewhere with his lady.”
“Fine,” he smiles slightly. “But for all I know you just told me to go fuck myself.”
“I know you’re sorry Cas,” Winchester says, sounding as if the conversation is over. “About Bal. About mom.”
He can feel tension rolling off the couple at its back in waves. It’s the same silence it had witnessed between them before, but thicker, somehow. It can sense that its presence being known to the two hasn’t meant a thing – the tension would have existed whether or not it where there to see it.
“Around Sam?”
“No,” Gordon’s lip curls. “You think I want a front row seat to the disgusting shit I see in the locker room every day?”
He comes yelling Cas’ name one last time, thick spurts of cum getting all over his comforter as the dog barks from the TV room.”Fuck,” he swears loudly, knocking his head back and hitting the wall with a loud thump. “Fuck.”
He’d expected to not like it, to have to soldier through the first few seconds before he got used to it, but that isn’t the case. Cas is hot and heavy on his tongue, the taste of him a mixture of salt and musk and something else he can’t really define. It’s not bad. Dean runs his tongue around the head of Cas’ cock, probing curiously, and Cas shudders, immediately clenching both hands in Dean’s hair.
Snow is gathering on his eyelashes, making them glitter and emphasizing how long they are.
“My birthday.” Dean feels like he’s in a bubble, not even really connected to the rest of the world as he watches Cas’ mouth turn up in a slight smile.
Dean feels a warm hand on his thigh and looks down in surprise. Cas has been doing this lately, touching him more and more. And it’s only him, because Dean has sure as hell been looking out for it when he interacts with other people. He kind of hopes it has something to do with Cas maybe…being able to read him a little, but he highly doubts it. Cas has always had issues with getting too close to Dean, the touching is probably just an extension of that. “Dean,” Cas says louder, and Dean’s pretty sure this isn’t the first time he’s said his name. “I have to go to the bathroom.”
“You got it.” Dean wiggles out of his jeans and kicks them off his feet, shrugging out of his flannel at the same time. Cas has backed up a little to give him room and is watching him undress, fingers toying idly with the cap of the lube bottle. “You know we’ll never get that stuff out of the sheets now?” Dean asks, nodding at it. “Glitter ain’t no joke.”
He can see Benny eyeing him as he tosses the last of the empty beer bottles in the trash, a smile on his lips.
“Get some more sleep, alright?” he says, grabbing his headphones on the bedside table.
“Do you want a complete list?”
It’s not like he isn’t used to it; Jimmy’s schedule had always been all over the place and more often than not Castiel would spend the day in the quiet comfort of the condo on his own. It’s the sudden knowledge that Jimmy is not going to burst through the door at any given point anymore that punches a hole through his chest and sends him spinning.
look at it, it’d probably make him dizzy. Instead he watches as Benny stands back up and pats his shoulder.
Jimmy was his best friend. He knew everything about him. Why did he choose to deliberately break him to pieces? Why did he decide to hurt his own brother?
Instead we all got a big old crap of
Dean seems to take his cue and starts undressing while Cas takes care of their dog. After a minute or two, Cas manages to coax him into going back to the living room and after petting him one last time (Dean goes as far as kissing Holli’s head because he’s so far gone on their dog- Cas tries to ignore the way it makes him melt) Cas finally closes the door of their bedroom behind him.
He scoffs, ducking his head to look at the river below the deck. “Figured you weren’t just here for a courtesy visit.”
“Alright. I’m probably gonna crash, I’m beat. Text me when you get back?”
“That’s a blast from the past,” Dean laughs quietly. “Where did you find that one?”
Dean can’t even tear his eyes away to look at Benny, too stunned by… well, at this point- everything.
“Even if that’s true, I don’t see how Cas fits that pattern. He’s the one who dumped me. Who didn’t want to have anything to do with me. I’m not just going to pop by his place and casually ask how he’s been doing for the past 10 years.”
Cas’ eyes twinkle with interest. “Yeah?”
It feels like so long ago. Like an alternate universe where all the shit they went through didn’t happen. A planet where Jimmy is still alive and Dean never left, never thought about leaving at all. A world where the only pain Cas would feel would be the pain of having to muscle through Dean and Jimmy’s bantering over the breakfast table.
• references to past drug abuse
It’s bordering 8 pm and it’s already dark, but the light of the city illuminates the outside enough for him to see the way Dean’s eyes still shine with unshed tears as Cas lowers himself on his knees right behind him. He has to resist the urge to wrap him into a hug, not knowing what’s going on and if he’s allowed in his space. So instead, he softly sets a reassuring hand between Dean’s shoulder blades and waits.
“I don’t want to read it,” he shakes his head, his tone clipped. “Just tell me what they want.”
“Are you... seriously offering me to move in with you?”
Thanks to everyone for your reactions to last week's chapter, I got a little overwhelmed by everything. I'm so glad so many of you seem to be enjoying this fic 🤟🏻
Other times though it would be easier, like navigating through a paler shade of grey, and for a second Cas would think he was doing better.
Dean shakes his head, emotions overflowing his senses.
“That was…” he starts, not knowing how to qualify what they just did.
Dean almost died and he doesn’t
“You know he talked about you a lot,” he says, voice all velvet and cajun accent seeping through his words. “Never said a name, or anything that would give you away, but he did. All the time.”
“Hey,” he finally whispers into Cas’ hair. “I’m not going anywhere.”
Dean wants him so badly that his entire body yearns for him, for the press of his skin against him; to get swallowed up by the ocean of emotions swirling into his guts. To hold him close like they’re the only one left in the world. And Cas seems to understand just how much he wants him as he dives down for another kiss.
Which is why Dean is so surprised to see him being awake and
“You have no idea what I’ve done before,” Dean interrupts, his voice so cold that it sends shivers down Cas’ spine. “And you don’t think I’m capable of fixing cars anymore?”
And he really, really,
Thank you for the incredible response you gave to the latest chapter. I was incredibly nervous to share it with everyone because I kept it very close to my heart for weeks, and your response blew me away. I said it before, this story can't exist without you and your support means the world to me. Whether it's a comment or a kudos here, or some yelling into my Tumblr inbox, or people reaching out to me on Twitter — all of it means everything. 💚
Instead, he dropped onto his couch where he’s been sprawled ever since. Losing his entire composure into a pint of mint chip ice cream, as everyone does once in a while.
He’s starting to babble, which is code for stress when it comes to Cas. Dean reaches out for his hand as Benny sits back on the couch after one last friendly slap to Cas’ shoulder.
“I’m sorry,” Dean breathes out, voice so broken he has trouble recognizing it. “It’s stupid.”
“I get it,” Dean says as he opens his arms. “I do. It’s okay.”
What’s unusual is the way he can see his broad shoulders shaking, or the quiet sobs he can already hear from where he’s standing.
“I don’t know if knowing your best friend is similar to a bear is supposed to be comforting or terrifying,” Cas chips in, delighting in the way Dean laughs again. “But thanks, I’ll keep that in mind.”
“Everything in the Navy is, to be fair.”
And then Cas was gone, and Dean was left on the floor, reeling.
“Let me take a look at your fridge and we’ll see from there.”
His hair is a mess, as per usual. His eyes are the brightest blue Dean has ever seen, and he sure as hell isn’t saying that because he’s completely, utterly in love with him (or maybe he is, but that’s not the point, the point is they’re beautiful and Dean could stare at them for hours). He’s not wearing a shirt either and it’s a sight for sore eyes, miles and miles of tan skin exposed to Dean’s eyes only. But it’s when Cas stares back at him with a tiny smile that Dean feels the actual, goddamn butterfly in his stomach starting to dance.
“Yeah. I made some eggs the way you like it.”
Cas smiles, emotions bubbling up to the surface at the sound of Dean’s voice- it’s stupid, really. He knows that he’ll be home in about 48 hours, that he’s barely four states over and that Dean is most likely sleeping in a bed they share, in a place they’ve been living in together for the most part of the past year.
He looks outrageously gorgeous, if not for the way the mix of water and sweat lights up the constellation of freckles on his face, then for the insane bolt of arousal that runs through Castiel’s veins when Dean’s too tight black t-shirt rises up to reveal the bruise on his hipbones left by Cas’ hand the night before.
I need you to know, there was not a day since I made that decision that I didn’t regret it. I know this pales in comparison to what you two had to go through, and I’m so sorry.
Dean doesn’t think he’s ever seen that look on Castiel’s face before. The sheer excitement mixed with wonder, something twinkling furiously in those baby blues.
“I guess sometimes I just feel guilty having all of this and Jimmy’s buried in the ground, and I hate it,” he finally lets out, the weight on his chest heavy as the words roll out on his tongue, his eyes closing on impact. “I just wish he were here. I wish I got tell him I forgive him while looking at his stupid smug face.”
And to crown it all, now that he’s home and preparing things for tonight’s meal, he’s missing the star ingredient for the dinner he had planned.
Right after kissing
Dean just scoffs, apparently mesmerized by the sight of Cas pressing limes to put some fresh juice in their glasses. It takes roughly three minutes and then Cas is handing Dean his drink before leaning against the counter with his own.
Bobby seems taken aback as he stares at him, but Dean sees it, as clear as day; the tingle of fury starting to grow inside his uncle’s eyes, telling him to either say his piece and leave or retreat to one of the safe corners and wait for the storm to pass.
“I think it’s stupidly arousing in ways that shouldn’t be allowed for the average person,” Dean fires back immediately, an edge of yearning piercing through his rough voice.
“Then write. Dean will definitely read it. And I’m sure you can find it in yourself to sit down with Cas and come clean,” she says as she looks at him intensely. “And then it’s up in the air. They’re not kids anymore, and Cas is strong enough to do what he wants with it once he knows.”
He struggles to get back to sleep, turns and tosses for a while until the distinct sound of his phone ringing rips through the quiet of his bedroom.
“Why didn’t you call me?” he asks after a while, never tearing his eyes away from him. “I’m here for you. You don’t have to do this alone.”
“You can’t- you
He all but jumps from his spot on the couch, catching Cas’ frame closing the front door. He’s wearing the same clothes as he did this morning before Dean left with Benny, but he’s sporting tiny cuts on his knuckles that take Dean all the way back to his freakout after they had both discovered what Jimmy did.
The bottom line is, you calling and telling me he’d OD'd didn’t convince me otherwise. You were there with him waiting for the paramedics to roll in, I needed someone to blame for it- so I did. To cap it all off, at the time I was consumed by misplaced jealousy over the space you took into my brother’s life — which I know, wasn’t fair too. You were my best friend. You still are to this day, and I don’t even know how, because I clearly don’t deserve it. And you were everything to Cas. I think you still are, despite everything.
“Hey angel,” he smirks, his gaze lingering on Cas for half a second before he turns back to conspicuously cleaning Baby, “came to join in on the fun, or to watch?”
He doesn’t even have the opportunity to really think about what he’s doing until he’s walking into the room and catching Cas. His arms automatically wrap around him in a hug so fierce that Cas gasps against him, his breath ghosting over the skin of Dean’s throat where he’s pressed. He catches the smirk on Jess’ face and the wink she throws at him before she takes off and closes the curtain behind her, giving them some privacy. Dean suddenly remembers the call and his mind jumps to a halt.
“Are you- did you get it by a meteorite or something?”
The truth is, letting you go is the hardest thing I’ve ever done. But in the end, it’s the only way I have left to love you.
He presses his forehead against Dean’s, sharing his breathing.
“C’mere, then.”
an ass now?”, “YES!!”)
“Tell me what you need,” he says, never letting go of Castiel’s eyes.
therapy? You?” Bobby says, a huge grin on his face. “Wow, that’s something I never expected to hear from your mouth.”
“I mean, you’ll have to get cleared by your doctors first and finish your PT and stuff, and I
It’s been more than a year since I wrote to you last. For a long time I wondered if it was doing more bad than good, if writing to you was just a way for me to keep you with me. So I stopped. I buried myself in booze and women, tried to self-destruct with too much work and not enough sleep, and you know what?
He drops his head into Cas’ shoulder again then, and follows the faint white marks where his shoulder and arm meet with one finger. He knows what these are — track marks where Cas used to inject heroin into his muscle to get off. He has some on his arms still, some more ancient marks on his legs from when he started using. But these look more recent.
“What I think is you could need a bodyguard,” he says instead.
“Course I know,” Dean groans.
Cas looks at him curiously as Dean’s hand drops from his cheek, and it looks like he’s been slapped in the face by Dean’s sudden cold tone.
“Yeah. I’m at Bobby’s.”
And that was a good thing, actually. Dean loves Jess, and at this point he trusts her with his life. So they made their way through the hospital’s second floor, knocked on a door, exchanged a few words and that’s how Dean wound up here in the waiting room.
“I’m saying he’d listen to you. Yet you’re not saying anything.”
Some days I wake and feel the emptiness already flooding the room, the yearning mounting in my throat. But it's not the cavity in my chest that keeps me awake, it's that I have no idea what I'm supposed to fill it with.
Dean loses Cas after a few minutes, and that’s when he runs into another veteran.
Much later, after the party had ended and they’d gone home in a cab, Dean wakes up close to +1000 followers and people commenting “otp” and “#ISHIPIT” under his latest post. Next to him, a really hungover Cas is laughing quietly.
They’re silent for a while until Cas’ voice breaks it again.
Some nights I can’t stop thinking about the stars- how anyone can see so much light and still call it darkness. I’m also struck by the notion that to look upwards is to look into the past- that the light takes so long to reach that we’re seeing them as they were, and not as they are.
“I don’t know what’s going on,” he says, a note of sadness in his eyes.
“But I wanna try. I wanna try healing. I wanna try being better, at talking, at sharing. I wanna try being a better person, not only for you, but for everyone around me. I wanna be someone that you can count on. I wanna be a better man, and it’s because of you.”
going to hell.
Benny starts working with Dean at Bobby’s auto shop and within their first month working together, Bobby decides to pass on the family business to both boys. It takes a little while for Dean to accept, his fear of ruining it and missing out on too many important moments with Cas holding him back. It takes a bit of coaxing and a solid reassurance that they’re not going anywhere from Cas for Dean to sign the deal, and suddenly he and Benny are business owners.
If there’s one thing that’s still very much the same though, it’s the way he keeps missing Cas.
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Dean finally says, turning his eyes to look anywhere but at him.
“It’s perfect,” Dean interrupts, sniffling a little. “Should we scratch our first box and go and do whatever it tells us tomorrow?”
Cas nods, puts the coffee and the paper bag down on the table, and follows as Dean makes his way to the guest room and finally puts the boxes down next to the bed.
Once he zeroes in on the car coming at full speed onto him, it’s already too late to think of anything else than one last prayer.
He remembers the break, missing Cas every day but knowing this was for the best, and then the insane rush of fear at hearing Cas was in the hospital. He remembers the sunset over Lawrence as they kissed in the Impala, and how it felt like coming home.
“What’s up with you?” he asks, this time with mild concern because Cas is acting
And yeah, okay, fair enough. Dean can see what Cas means, and maybe he’s not wrong. But the simple thought of having to go to bed alone, falling asleep without Cas wrapped around him and waking up to a cold empty bed makes him want to beg Cas not to go through with this.
“Nothing,” Dean’s still frowning. “He was being kind of an ass earlier.”
It feels like a break up, which may be the dumbest thing he’s ever let his brain think. He hadn’t even gotten to have sex with Cas, much less date him. He didn’t
“Please,” Gabriel snorts. “I’m the best damn goalie in the league. Besides, you’ve never defended me, ergo, you are a horrible defender, Sammy-boy. I’d work on that.”
“None of you take anything seriously,” he replies in response, although Dean thinks he looks more confused by that than angry.
Dean nods. He understands. “That’s why I loved him,” he says, very quietly, so quietly he’s not sure he says it at all.
Dean is ashamed to say that he instantly wishes Cas would go back to the other voice.
“Anna is going back to school tomorrow,” Cas tells him. “I’m sure she has something planned with her friends.”
“Dunno, seems like if Dean is showing you American stuff, you should get to show him some Russian stuff.”
“You guys still want to grab lunch?” Sam asks. Dean can hear the raised eyebrow. “You remember that, right?”
rich people, which ended up pissing Dean off the rest of the night because he’s nothing like a rich asshole. But The Palm is all low lighting and paneled wooden walls and old pictures. There’s even a bar, although the hostess leads them far away from that to a private room in back where a large round table is set and waiting for them.
“Then why—”
By the time they’re on their fifth beer together they’ve called a tentative truce, and Dean’s feeling less and less like taking Charlie home tonight, mostly because she’s starting to feel like the little sister he never had. But he should at least try, right? A girl he genuinely enjoys talking to is a better scenario than he could have ever hoped for.
“If you want Gabriel’s version of help, perhaps we should go find Gabriel,” Castiel replies seriously.
“Good?” Dean asks, pulling his hand back and smiling at him.
“Dean.”
Castiel bites his lip and opens another box. “What are you doing here?” he repeats.
Dean stops struggling and tilts his head back. Sam is standing behind the couch, looking down at them with this weird look on his face, like he’s not sure if he should smile. “Hello Sam,” Cas says calmly.
Dean spins until he finds Krushnic, doesn’t even register the look on his face before he’s violently shaking his gloves off and raising his fists. Whatever emotion Krushnic had been displaying before instantly vanishes, and he stares flatly at Dean. His gloves don’t come off.
“No,” she glares out at the ice. “He’s my bunkmate. I didn’t want the dumb Make-A-Wish, so I gave it to him. The hospital made me come anyway.”
“Why the fuck,” Dean demands to know. “Am I the bottom?”
“S’fine,” Dean grunts, fingers tightening around the seat once again as feels the plane start to descend. He can almost imagine what the nose dive looks like. What kind of sane person enjoys this?
“Cas,” Dean says, quietly horrified. But then Gordon and Zach look just as horrified, so hey, that’s a plus.
“Yeah, keep being assholes,” Dean grumbles, standing up and dumping his and Cas’ plate in the sink. “Cas is my friend. You two act like I never did shit with you when you were new to the team.”
Castiel looks up in surprise. Santa Claus is scowling at him. “I thought you were feeding your reindeer.”
Sam launches a gumdrop in Dean’s direction and Dean ducks, letting it hit Cas instead, who is taking his gingerbread man way too seriously. “Hey, Cas, you know we’re just gonna eat these, right?”
Kind of sucks he’ll have to spend his day off alone, unless he likes that kind of thing. He might.
“Alright,” Cas agrees. Dean stares up at the sky, breathing deeply and trying to will his erection back down whatever hole it crawled out of. He can feel Cas’ eyes on him, studying him, and Dean’s steadfastly ignoring him, but Cas’ hands must get cold or something, propping him up on the ice, because suddenly the entire weight of him has drops onto Dean’s chest and Dean is yelping and pushing him away before anything else can happen.
Despite having to do laundry, November starts off pretty great. Home games are the best, but a whole string of ‘em in a row are the stuff you look forward to all season. It gives you the opportunity to play as much hockey as you want and then go home at the end of the night, see your friends and your city for more than a day at a time.
“I gotta remember to hire you to write all my press conference answers,” Benny says. “You gotta way with words, Gabe.”
The only one missing is Victor.
Dean’s so eager to get out of here he’s already standing up, even as Gabriel says, “Why we gotta go anywhere early?”
“Probably because it is true.”
Dean tapes off the bandage. “I’m sorry.” He doesn’t know what for.
There is no way whoever is in the bathroom with them doesn’t hear Dean’s ensuing yelp, and the concern might have been greater if Cas wasn’t working him over so well, his tongue swirling around Dean’s head while his hand keeps a solid grip at his base.
“What, like with emotions and crap? Bobby, this team’s been a solid family for about six years now, we’ve managed to avoid all that and still come out of it liking each other okay.”
Dean’s still trying to get his fucking breathing back to normal when Bobby slaps the side of his helmet and tells him to get his ass moving. Bastard ruined his concentration.
“I don’t think I like your father,” Cas says, but he leaves it at that and lets Dean finish changing. Dean doesn’t say anything else either, because what’s the point. Dad’s not here, and he’ll either get over it or he won’t.
“Whining?” Dean stops searching and focuses on the conversation. “Did he get hurt? Swear to god Crowley, if you did anything to him—”
“Dunno,” Dean says truthfully, focusing on Eli’s lips. They’re alright, from what he can tell behind all that beard. He’s not sure if he could kiss a guy with a beard. It’d feel weird, wouldn’t it?
Castiel lets out a surprised chuckle. “How did it look?”
Bobby’s gonna kill Gabriel for getting champagne all over the locker room, but Dean can’t find it in himself to yell at the guy. Not when he’s this excited.
“I just want to make sure I don’t break your rule,” Sam says innocently.
Dean punches him in the face.
“Alright, fine, smart ass,” Dean sighs. “Guys grab dinner too, y’know. You ever been on a date with a guy?”
Contact practices mean you can hit people. As hard as you fucking want. And you get hit in return. Dean swears, the biggest rush is when someone like Benny slams into him and he doesn’t fall, or when he gets back up quickly with every muscle in his body screaming to race as fast as he can after the puck anyway.
Krissy looks up in exasperation from fumbling her laces, so Dean leans down again and begins to work at the knot for her. “Is he one of your issues?”
“You cannot fight the Mark forever, Dean,” Cas tells him, his voice low and urgent, the edge of desperation cutting at his words. “And when you turn – and you will turn – Sam and everyone else you love may be long dead. Everyone except me. I’m the one who will have to watch you murder the world. If there’s even a small chance we can save you, I won’t let you walk out of this room.”
“Nothing,” Dean shakes his head. Cas, thank god, isn’t like Sam. He drops it, even though Dean can tell he’s still thinking about it, thinking Dean’s upset, when they hail a cab and climb in.
Dean frowns. Panic and fear have cleared his head, the self-loathing and heartache that had been rolling and crashing over him just moments before temporarily forgotten. “Like?”
“Dean.” Cas is looking at him funny. “They only gave us one bed.”
“Maybe I’m not pretending,” Castiel counters.
Dean had been considering leaving Chekov in a kennel for the next two days, but the idea is quickly abandoned when Cas lets the damn dog sit on his lap as soon as he climbs into the car.
“Hey,” he barks out, and then pauses. The hollow feeling in his chest is rising, climbing up the back of his throat, and he can’t understand what he was even going to say. So the giant ugly brand on his arm is gone, so what? Sure makes his sex life easier.
” follows him all morning. Through his drive to the hospital, through his entire PT, through his walk to Charlie’s.
Dean lets out a startling laugh, halfway into a sob, and hates the way his voice cracks when he answers.
Dean hums appreciatively when Castiel slides a hand under his chin and lifts his head up, only to capture his lips in a tender kiss. His tongue wraps around Dean’s in a furious dance and Cas can feel the smile gradually appearing on the other man’s lips pressed against his as they melt into each other’s embrace. Dean’s hands are under his shirt suddenly, the rest of the buttons making a distinct
Wild greens finally meet steady blues, but Cas doesn’t stop cupping Dean’s face, and Dean doesn’t protest either. He looks exhausted. Out of it. But he’s
“It’s a 24-weeks-course. It’s divided into 5 distinct parts. You’ve got orientation first, which is 3 weeks, and was formerly known as Indoctrination. I think the name speaks for itself.”
Some secluded part of his brain realizes that he’s following the same path as he did a decade ago; being scared out of his mind that Cas might be dying and that he might never see him again, running like an absolute madman through the same hospital’s corridor. There’s probably a joke to be made about how similar the situations are, but Dean’s mind doesn’t stop to think, doesn’t want to remember about the pain and the loss and the tears and the heartache anymore. It only wants to find Cas, to make sure he’s okay, to make sure he’s
“Cas, sweetheart, look at me,” Dean pleads suddenly, his lips sealed underneath his jaw, his voice hoarse. Every thrust of his hips grows more erratic and Cas knows that he’s close, they both are. “Babe, look at me. It’s okay, you can let go. Let go, sweetheart.”
Benny’s silent for a second. Then, “Are you having a seizure?”
“Okay,” Cas says as Dean puts the dough for the crust in the refrigerator, “but on one condition.”
Dean turns on his side to watch Cas carefully. The faint light coming from the street illuminates the room just enough so that he can distinguish his friend in the darkness. Cas’ eyes are locked on the ceiling.
Dean wants to reach out. Wants to argue that this isn’t fair, that he doesn’t understand why they have to do this, or what it’s supposed to prove. But he’s too tired and wired, and Cas is a stubborn son of a bitch anyway so it’s not like he has any hope of proving him wrong.
“Oh definitely,” Dean smiles.
It takes half a minute until Dean’s shirt is finally off and Cas’ hand slides down his injured arm.
“Yeah,” Dean smiles, almost sheepishly and Cas’ mind stammers a little at the sight. “Why don’t you come ‘round here and I’ll show you?”
. And instead of picking up the goddamn phone you shut me out!”
Tears are rolling on Castiel’s cheek but he’s not sobbing. He’s watching as Dean steadily lays it all out for him, and Dean knows Cas well enough to know somewhere in the back of his head he appreciates him doing this instead of telling him the kind of usual crap people say when you lose someone.
“Cas it’s barely 8 pm I-,”
It’s one of those nights where they went to bed mad at each other that Cas wakes up in the middle of the night to an empty bed. He tries not to freak out; they’re way past the point where finding an empty bed is supposed to make them jump out in fear that the other has run away- at least, supposedly.
“You don’t get to leave and come back years later throwing accusations around just because you can’t live with yourself, boy,” Bobby erupts, getting up from his chair and making his way through the living room to stand across Dean. “You
It’s been three long years since I’ve left. I still hope, everyday, that you’re doing okay. That you’ve managed to rise again. Sometimes I awake at night and my first thought is always for you. This side of the world or the other, my first thought is always for you.
“Okay,” he nods, voice barely a whisper.
He barely has time to react when Castiel takes control, splaying both his hands on Dean’s chest and pushing him down before he starts riding his cock like it’s all he’s been made for. It’s borderline pornographic, the way Cas just
”. To Dean’s lips on his, his hands on his skin, the pull of his fingers on his hips. To the way he moaned his name like his own personal song, how softly he kept kissing him, holding him close.
“You’ve got to stop running into situations that can get you killed,” he keeps going, his voice muffled from where he’s pressed against Dean’s skin. “Because I cannot
“I already told you about as much as I can, Cas. It’s… most of those details are classified.”
I didn’t believe in forever, but I did believe in you. And for a while, it was enough.
But he’ll take it if it means Cas is safe.
“Say it, Jimmy,” Dean says as they stare at each other. “Say it.”
“Nope.”
It’s exactly one month after he moved in that Cas appears under his bedroom door frame around 9 pm, looking like he just ran a marathon.
And this morning, his dark hair completely disheveled, his 5 o’clock shadow and Dean’s shirt exposing the tan skin of his shoulder are making Dean’s mind even more slow to process anything remotely important.
• depiction of physical injuries/war injuries
It’s not uncommon for them to celebrate a successful hunt at a random bar before heading back on the road, toward Lebanon.
He lets his hand go from Cas’ cheek to his neck, down his shoulder and finally to his wrist. His pulse seems okay, only a little weak.
“You can’t be serious,” he scowls as Dean starts prepping the pie crust, making his best effort not to cross eyes with his pissed angry boyfriend, “you’ve had me running around the entire day! I get that it pissed you off that I forgot the beer the first time around, but that’s not—“
And yeah, sure, he has a point. Cas knows he’s being unfair. He knows he’ll most likely regret reacting like this later on. But he’s also halfway into an anxiety crisis, so he’s not quite sure it matters anyway.
Not that it wasn’t enjoyable.
“Okay, alright you two, point made,” Dean rolls his eyes fondly before he starts poking at his slice of pie. “You don’t have to drive me. I can walk or... take the bus.”
Hates the way his lips still taste like Cas. Hates how he instantly misses the warmth of Castiel’s hand against his skin as he pulls back.
Dean just grins and can’t help but slide his hand around Cas’ neck and kiss the living shit out of him, finding the strength to flip out a finger to his younger brother’s disgusted noise while he lets his tongue wander into his angel’s mouth.
Balthazar rolls his eyes. “Fucking typical.”
“How I was there when the stars were created, and now I’m here on Earth gazing at them.”
“I enjoy it,” Cas answers, looking at him with a soft smile and look that Dean knows for a fact is just for him. “It’s quiet and refreshing.”
He enters the bunker’s kitchen with a groan, only to find Cas behind the counter, busy doing god knows what that weirdo thought was more important to do than cuddling with his boyfriend in bed on a Sunday morning.
It comes out as a scream and ends in a sob, and Cas feels his heart giving out as he crashes against the kitchen counter trying to hold onto something solid for balance. Unable to control himself still, he gets a hold of the plates that have been drying for an entire day and sends them flying across the room, delighting in the distinct noise it makes as they crash on the floor. He keeps going, everything he can get his hands onto crashing around him.
Charlie nods. “Yes. I can’t guarantee that he’ll still want to talk to you after that, but he’ll read it. And then this is in their hands. They’re grown-ups. It’s out of your hands once you post the letter to Dean and once you’ve talked to your brother.”
“Left to go where?” he says, his voice barely a whisper.
“What gave you the right? Huh! Why did you decide to wreck my whole life?! Why did you take him away from me?! It’s not
“What did the bunker ever do to you?” he exclaims instead, purposely steering the conversation away.
“Hard?” Cas cuts off, and Dean smiles at the rough tone, alone in Charlie’s guest room. “Me neither, to tell you the truth.”
“Running,” Cas says matter-of-factly.
“You shut up,” Benny mutters against him, and Dean can’t help but laugh.
Cas extends a hand to cup Dean’s cheek, watching as his boyfriend closes his eyes on impact, pushes into the contact of Cas’ palm against his skin.
Cas finally allows his eyes to wander for a quick second as Dean rises from his seat.
He rocks slightly harder into him, snapping his hips faster and relishing the moan that leaves Cas’ mouth.
“Leave me alone.”
It sparks something in Dean. Some sort of cognitive response, a hint of something new. When he turns back to look at Ray, the other man is looking at him with an eyebrow raised.
You know, the Novak kid used to hang around here after you left".
“That’s fucked up, right? Feeling more at home in a… In a country that’s been at war for years. With the danger of dying at any given point, than feeling at home
Posting early for no other reason than "it was ready and I couldn't wait to share"! I'm probably gonna keep updating on Fridays/Saturdays from now on because I like it better than Sundays lmao.
September rolled in already and with it came the bitter feeling of Fall. Summer all wrapped up, Lawrence lost a bit of its magnificence. Students went back to KCU leaving the decks of bars empty and the warmth that came with August had left to welcome the chills and fallen leaves of September. Consequently, it also did a number on Cas’ mood and it’s been days since he felt anything like this warm feeling settling through his chest.
“Good night,” he whispers into nothing, the white envelope on the deck a stark contrast with the darkness of the night.
The planet doesn’t stop turning. Nothing changes in the air. But somehow, Cas feels like the tectonic plates have shifted. Like the air in his lungs suddenly got transformed into an electric current.
Howdy 🤠 How are we feeling? What do you think comes next?
“Is that what just happened to you?” Cas asks, his voice thin from where it’s pressed against Dean’s skin.
I have grown comfortable with the idea of being alone, because it seems somehow less frightening than letting another person make a home in my chest. I don’t think my heart can take another absence, and I don’t think I can survive another shot at love. I know it’s only barely been two months, but the way my heart still lurches when I think of you, I know I won’t let myself go through this ever again.
The Novaks’ apartment stands beside the Kansas river and in a quiet part of town (although Lawrence is undoubtedly a quiet city, Dean realizes quickly enough after a decade spent in Virginia). Cas and Jimmy started living here when they were 16, after they got booted from their last foster home (Jimmy
Dean smiles, his hand catching the small hair at the nape of Cas’ neck. He’s beautiful like this, only wearing boxers and Dean’s old Zeppelin shirt. His hair mussed and all soft against him, his frame only highlighted by the moonlight outside.
But he’s also terrified. Terrified to go through this again. Terrified to have to let go of Dean again. Terrified of him returning to running into war, never knowing if he’s going to come back dead or alive.
Cas wishes he could drown in it and never go back.
• mentions of killing while on military duties
Dean kisses him softly, trapping his bottom lip into his and
“You’re lucky I love you,” he whispers against Castiel’s lips.
Dean doesn’t stop his thrusts immediately, letting them both ride it out together until they grow slower and he finally sinks down on Cas completely and stops moving.
• Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder crisis
“Cas? He came here a few times after you were gone. I think he was looking for you, really, but he never specifically said so.”
“Oh joy," Cas laughs.
“I gotta be up by 6 to be at Kansas City Airport by 7.”
Okay, so Cas is not leaving him. Dean hates the relief that course through his veins at that. One night in an empty bed without Cas still doesn’t sound like a good thing though.
After a while, once he’s sure Cas has sunk deep into sleep, he allows himself to come closer. Propped on his elbow, he brushes a quick kiss into the v-shape of Cas’ neck, delighting in the warmth of his skin, breathing deeply before he whispers three barely audible words, more for himself than anyone else.
Until now.
“Thought you might’ve finally bitten the dust, Winchester.”
“Cas said he’d wait for you, huh?” Charlie asks, a smile on her face as she wraps her arm around Dean’s shoulders.
No one should be allowed to look this good, it’s criminal.
Ah yes, there it is. The concerned tone, the worried look. Dean is suddenly glad Sam wasn’t around to see him mope after Cas dumped him because he would have never seen the end of it.
“Is it serious?” Cas asks, his eyes slightly widening.
• alcohol/intoxicated character
Missouri smiles at him. “Of course I do. Your relationship with Dean is a complicated one filled with wounds and hurt and absence. It’s only human that you react this way.”
It takes him roughly 20 minutes to get from his place to Charlie’s coffee shop. Once he does he barely registers the environment, only making his way to the counter to order his usual out of habit.
“Scared.”
The answer is too quick, and his eyes are too wild. Dean has been there before, forced to weigh in on what’s real or not. He leans in to catch Cas’ eyes again, his hand tightening on his shoulder.
“Was Ian your boyfriend?” Cas finally asks.
Sam had said throwing bitch face number 387 labeled
They’re gonna need a new code.
. God,” he laughs brokenly, looking up at the ceiling as he searches for the right words to say all this. “I fucked up 10 years ago, Charlie, and nothing has ever been right ever since.”
“Y-yeah, okay,” Dean stammers, following Cas leads back to the Novaks condo.
“-will be fine without me,” Benny interrupts. “Part of why you need to read this as well.”
Cas sighs. “Balthazar wanted to try the Replay Lounge in Downtown Lawrence.”
Watching Ray move so smoothly around him as he paints on his canvas, knowing the trauma he’s been through and what he’s overcome reminds Dean that life is not lost just yet. That wounds don’t define you unless you let them.
The truth is, it doesn't hurt the way it did. It's more of an ache than a piercing. More stream than waterfall. Everything about the way I remember you is one day at a time, and eventually, I might not ache tomorrow.
“No, no, I’ll be fine,” Dean says as he raises on his feet to give Bobby a hug. “Only easy day was yesterday,” he half-jokes.
Dean makes his way to the counter and wraps both of his arms around Cas’ waist,
” question that he answered truthfully but with some sort of ghost dancing inside his beautiful eyes… Dean is a different man today than he was 10 years ago. It would be foolish not to acknowledge it.
I’m leaving Illinois in a few hours, and heading to California to start BUD/S for the next twenty-four weeks.
Dean furrows his brows. “Did something happen? I talked to him a few hours ago and he seemed fine.”
It’s what he loves about Missouri; she doesn’t judge, or push, or makes a point of making him feel like an idiot for how he feels. She listens and receives everything he has to say, and then dissects it to show him what he can do differently, or why he feels the way he feels. When he needs to cry, she lets him cry and offers comfort until he’s calm enough to talk again.
“On Ian’s first death anniversary I got stupid drunk and Benny had to come get me from the bar. You’re fine, babe.”
“Every time you pulled the trigger wasn’t of your own volition. You were sent to do a job. To protect your country. You’re
The truth is I am not better off without you than my lungs are without breath. You’ve been both my drowning and my shore, the lighthouse and the sea. And until I find a way to let you go, you’ll continue being my anchor.
Sometimes Cas thinks that Balthazar is going to end up with cognitive disorder from rolling his eyes this hard. His friends then proceeds to smirk at him, which does
“What are you doing?” Cas laughs against him, Dean’s arms solidly holding him up as he takes both of them to their room.
Somehow, talking with Ray unlocks something in Dean as they go through mutual stories about deployment. It reminds him that things are not lost, that he still gets to wake up every day and enjoy life, albeit differently than what he would’ve expected a few years back. It reminds him that he still has two legs to stand on.
No one should be allowed to look this hot this early in the morning. It’s criminal. Dean’s pretty sure there should be cosmic laws against this.
he loves you.”
“Did they do anything to you?” he asks, almost afraid to know the answer.
On a much more personal note, because I feel like I can share that in this space with you, tomorrow will mark 10 years since I got clean. This story is a testament to that journey, one that I hope I can convey through Cas and the people that gravitate around him, and one that's been extremely cathartic to write. If you're reading this and you're struggling with substance abuse, know that you can reach out, and know that there's a light at the end of the tunnel whenever you're ready to grasp it.
“I still don’t get it, Dean.”
“Yes, I want to marry you and have kids with you someday. Let’s just- let’s not think too hard about a schedule, alright? I don’t like schedules anymore. Let’s just go where life takes us?”
“I mean, I thought he dumped me. And he thought I dumped him. But neither of us dumped the other.”
He re-read the texts over and over, already cursing himself for their late-night dispute, blaming himself for messing things up all over again.
“That’s, uh… only if you want to come with me, of course.”
He reaches down and cups Dean through his jeans, and yeah, here it is hard as a rock, and Dean moans loudly into the hollow of his throat as Cas starts stroking painfully over the fabric of his pants.
Of course, it weighs on him to the point where it’s bordering 3 am and Cas is still wide awake staring at his ceiling in disbelief.
At that, Sam rises from his spot on the floor, takes a bottle of whisky out of the cabinet, and pours three glasses for the three of them.
like the man you used to love, I can’t let you fall for this. I’m damaged, and I damage people and I can’t. I won’t —,”
“Fuck,
How do you explain how much it still hurts to see him laugh, how much it still hurts to watch him get up in the morning with that soft look on his face he used to reserve specifically for you? How much it still hurts to hear the sound of his voice knowing that you’re not allowed to have him anymore?
Cas takes control then, pushing his head further down and gliding in until Dean is forced to breathe through his nose, his fingers digging into Cas’ hips where there will no doubt be bruises in the morning to remember.
echoing into his head. Cas is warm against him, and for the first time in years Dean feels like the gigantic weight he’s been holding on his shoulders slightly eases down.
Dean breaks again, and Cas is at a loss for words. In the past almost 20 years of knowing him, he’s almost positive this is the most Dean has ever talked about his feelings. And it doesn’t matter that his heart is in his throat right now. It doesn’t matter that tears are starting to well up in his eyes because he feels Dean’s pain and he knows that he’s not going to be able to heal it on the spot. It doesn’t matter that his stomach churns at how much he needs to hold him close.
Cas raises an eyebrow at that, and Dean can’t help but smile.
“Talk to me.”
There are tattoos amongst the ruin of his skin. Dean had none before he left. Cas might have seen the one on his left arm (a thorny rose tattooed on the side of his arm) and the one on his right wrist (a stylized M that Dean told Cas was for Mary and Mom) over the past few weeks, but he hadn’t seen the “Semper Fortis” on Dean’s left shoulder that seems to have miraculously been spared by the IED blast. Or the Roman numeral on Dean’s clavicle that unfortunately didn’t get so lucky and is barely readable over the scars.
I’ve been pondering for months, wondering if I should come clean. Truth be told, I wanted to tell Cas 8 years ago. I was gearing up to doing so, but then he relapsed. I found him on the floor of the apartment’s bathroom, a needle still inserted in his arm, and the only thing he was able to tell me before he crashed was your name. It took everything in me not to crack, not to come clean on the spot. He was trying so hard, Dean. And I believed, at the time, that the truth would kill him.
(See the end of the chapter for
He should’ve been there. He knew leaving even for three days was a bad idea in the first place.
Cas eyes him carefully, letting his eyes follow the trail of Dean’s left side where he now knows most of the damage is situated. Despite the 10 years that have gone by, he still knows the way Dean moves and stands, and right now he can clearly see the discomfort.
“Home,” Jimmy smiles.
Cas sniffles, bringing his other hand to wipe the tears from his cheek, the other one still holding Dean’s.
Bobby doesn’t say anything but keeps looking at him expectantly. Dean puts his empty glass back on the desk before picking up his thoughts, slowly coming to terms with what he’s about to say.
Please let me know when you read this, even if it’s a simple “fuck you, you’re dead to me”, which I fully deserve. As soon as I post this I will sit down with Cas and explain everything. Then the two of you can decide what you want to do about it. I promise to stay away from it this time.
“Do you want me to move back?” he asks softly, brushing a kiss against Cas’ cheek.
He touches the big bruise on Cas’ left side carefully. Cas watches him silently.
“Can we do this on the couch? I’m exhausted.”
Dean brushes a kiss on her forehead. “I’m happy for you. Both of you.”
“Three.” Dean interrupts him, the corner of his lips turning slightly upwards, “three years ago, and it was a freaking strawberry daiquiri, Benny.”
Yeah, Dean can do just that.
“I’m so mad at him. I’m angry and I feel like it could swallow me up alive. I’m mad about what he did to me, to us. I’m mad that he’s dead and he can’t answer for his bullshit. I’m mad that I can’t punch him in the face.”
“So,” he starts, eyeing his brother carefully. “Do you wanna tell us what happened?”
“Yeah uh… I was running and then I went to the lake, and to the cemetery. And I… lost track of time,” Cas explains before he pulls his phone out of his pocket. “Phone died.”
“For a moment I think he did,” Cas says softly. “I tried to help, but things- you know, things between us weren’t always great. Or healthy.”
“Told you you could stay with us,” Sam interrupts as he shoves some kale into his mouth.
“Wanna be inside of you,” he says, capturing Cas’ mouth into another filthy kiss. “Wanna feel you.”
“Dean, talk to me.”
” when the curtains that Jess had closed about 5 minutes ago are yanked open and a doctor walks in, white coat on and papers in hands. Cas visibly lights up at his sight and goes to stand but the doctor stops him with a hand on his shoulder before he does.
When they tell you that dreams don’t come true, they’re lying. You just have to fight for them. Admittedly, some fight more than others; but as Dean looks at Cas, he thinks it’s worth it.
He gives up trying to lie. “Yeah. We had a stupid fight. He apologized this morning, and when my doctor told me about the appointment I told her that I’d like to go in person instead of doing some Skyping shit. It gave me an excuse to get away and see you guys.”
“Is Dean here?” Cas asks, his eyes catching on his bedroom door.
A beat, and then.
“Listen Winchester, you still have a couple of days to decide,” his team leader says, his Cajun accent as thick as ever (sometimes Dean thinks the man does it on purpose), “but you gotta know that whatever you decide, we’re still gonna be here for you. Bravo Team isn’t going anywhere, no matter what you do,” he continues.
“It’s okay. You don’t have to explain, I understand.”
It’s been 6 years since Dean left. 4 since Cas relapsed. He’s going to clock 4 years sober in a couple of weeks, which is huge.
“Dean, you didn’t have to—,”
to do so, I don't (generally) bite.
“I did.”
“Can you, for once in your life, try and cut the crap to a minimum? Please?” Castiel pleads.
Balt got married to his long-time girlfriend, Alicia, a year ago. She is one of the funniest people Castiel has ever known, and he loves nothing more than sitting there and watching Alicia and Balthazar bantering together.
“What do you mean?”
He doesn’t send the last text he types. What good would it make, anyway?
Cas looks like he’s been struck by lightning and for a second Dean fears that he’s asked too much. That Cas isn’t ready for this yet. That this is too quick, too real- until Cas finally moves and crashes his lips into Dean full force as he straddles him, turning Dean’s brain into a puddle of mud.
“Did you think I’d lost my touch, old man?” Dean chuckles as he reloads his gun.
To anyone on the outside, the kiss would seem chaste, pure even. To Dean it feels like saving grace. Like pure, liquid supernova being poured out inside his veins. Warmth and utter love shoot through him as he lingers, his tongue grazing Cas’ bottom lip before retreating just enough to watch Cas open his eyes to stare at him again.
And Dean doesn’t get it. He doesn’t.
Most people might call him an ex-addict, but that’s only a half-truth. The real truth is you never really stop being an addict even when you’re clean. There’s nothing that suddenly takes over once you are branded as being in the clear and serves as a magical compass keeping you on right path. It took Cas years to realize that being on the addiction spectrum is an everyday battle, one that you struggle with whenever you come across something as insignificant as orange bottles of medication lying on your living room table on any goddamn day. Even after a decade.
The blood on Dean’s clothes has gradually been replaced by oil stains, and the only wounds he gets lately usually originate from a nasty carburetor or a poorly fixed piece of metal. The only tears that stain his cheeks nowadays are either the symptom of too much laughing, the product of an anxiety attack, or the result of an argument with Cas. These always end up being kissed away, because while Dean and Cas’ relationship might be one complicated, messy story, they know better than to jeopardize it by forgetting to apologize anymore (and, well… Dean would argue that the pillow talk and makeup sex is the best part of apologizing anyway).
The letter had landed at Sam’s a few weeks after Dean had moved in with Charlie. He didn’t make a big deal out of it. He carefully picked it up from Sam’s and tossed it on the desk of the guest room he was occupying, and blatantly decided to ignore absolutely everything about it.
“I mean whenever I get down, I don’t know how to get back up, and it’s eating at me. I thought I had it all under control but then… Sometimes it just feels like I’m swimming in a bowl and there’s no way out.”
“Have a safe flight.”
You and I once found ourselves at the end of the world, or at least that's how it felt. We watched the rolling breaths of the ocean and felt like we were the furthest we'd ever been from home.
Whenever you were next to me, there was no rest of the world. There were no stars painting light to the darkness. No wind to carry our names through the grass. To me, there was only ever you.
“Oh for
, which made Dean die of laughter because yeah, fucking spot on) and fills it with coffee.
“Mhm-mhm. And it doesn’t have anything to do with the fact that you had to let Cas go to his tattoo appointment alone, right?”
“We can go at your pace. I won’t ever do anything you don’t feel like doing.”
“I’m sure the kids are fine. Honestly, we’ll be lucky if they even want to come back with us after spending two days with Sam and Jess.”
; for their
“What’s going on, Dean? Are you in trouble?”
He remembers letting go of the hurt of what Jimmy had done and forgiving him, missing him together.
Right now though, Dean stays stunned at the admission that Cas has touched himself thinking about this way before they got together again as the sentence goes straight to his already half-hard cock.
Dean sighs. “Yeah, I do. Everyone just talks about dad, all the goddamn time, and I don’t… you know how we were. I don’t have anything nice to say about him anymore, and I’m tired of having to keep it shut not to offend mom.”
“Huh?”
“He’s an ex-addict who doesn’t have any family left and who just lost a part of himself. And truth be told, I couldn’t stand my motel room anymore anyway, so that was a win-win situation.”
broke the father’s nose after he tried to go after Cas, a story neither of the twins ever made a point of confirming nor denying).
“Yeah, yeah. Well, you’re the one disturbing my peace and quiet at dawn,” Dean yawns into the phone.
“Will you ever stop?” Cas sighs, burying his head back into Dean’s shirt, and Dean laughs above him, his hand finding his way into Cas’ hair.
“Well, did you tell him you’re not going?”
“Are you two conspiring against me?”
“That’s not very fair of you, Castiel. You now know that this wasn’t his choice, but your brother’s.”
“That’s not what I-,” Cas starts before Dean interrupts him.
If Castiel was in his right mind, he would see the way this simple sentence seems to act like a slap in Dean’s face. He’d see the way the vibrant green of his eyes falters just a tremor. He’d see how the corners of Dean’s mouth twitch slightly before he schools it.
He moves his palm up Cas’ chest, the other one steady on his hip, finds the bulge of a nipple that he tweaks slightly… and smirks at the way Cas arches beautifully into the touch.
They’re busy bickering, so Dean doesn’t register right away when Cas rises to his feet and puts his denim jacket back on. When he does, Cas is smiling down at them with the purest smile he’s seen ever since they crashed into each other earlier.
Dean is used to words left untold, to white-lies and half-truths, to shoving his feelings down and swallowing his pride.
“Hey,” Balthazar clicks his finger to catch his attention. “You okay? You seem a little off.”
Days pass by and things start slowly changing around Dean. His sleeping pattern is improving slightly, his leg gets less and less bad days, his therapy appointments aren’t such a drag anymore.
“You’d tell me, though?” Balthazar says softly after a while, and although Cas doesn’t rip his eyes away from the sky, he can feel the weight of his friend’s gaze on his profile. “If it was something important or bad. You’d tell me?”
“I’m okay.”
They walk alongside the river for a few minutes before Dean decides to break the silence that settled between them. Cas is wearing a pair of grey sweatpants and a hoodie that Dean is almost sure belonged to Jimmy. He looks like he hasn’t seen the outside world in days (Dean knows that’s a lie, he’s seen the man the day before, but it still feels like Cas is completely disconnected from reality).
“What happened to your hands?” Dean asks gently, following the curve of Cas’ cheekbone with the pad of his thumb.
At that, Dean pushes himself off Cas’ chest and onto one elbow, the expression on his face barely readable through the darkness of their room.
They’re silent for a while, only disturbed by the quiet buzz of a town that never really sleeps. When he was still living in Virginia Beach, Dean used to love it. He’d sit in the mess that he called his backyard and would gaze at the stars with a beer in hand until it would get too cold to be out or the distinct alarm on his phone would go out and he’d have to rush to base.
“Just don’t go. Please, Dean,
He’s wearing the exact same hat he was wearing 10 years ago, and the clothes he has on are pretty much the same that Dean has seen him in his whole life. If it wasn’t for a couple of wrinkles on his face and the grey in his hair, Dean could’ve been fooled thinking this was 2010 all over again.
to me,” he chuckles sadly.
“My point is,” Cas continues, smiling at Dean. “It’s okay to discover new things about the person you share your life with. I don’t… I can’t say that I have a lot of experience with how relationships work, but I think it’s healthy. And I don’t think you’re a bad boyfriend just because you,” he gestures at his underwear. “Didn’t know that I liked wearing bright underwear.”
“You have?” Cas asks, his hand finding Dean’s and weaving their fingers together.
Cas nods, concentrates on his screen in front of him. It’s been a long day and he’s been craving a release for hours. He’s honestly on the verge of calling it quits and heading to a NA meeting before dinner. That’s the thing about addiction, it can strike and take you in at any given time if you don’t pay enough attention. Dean doesn’t seem to notice his wariness and just keeps going excitedly.
It takes everything in Dean not to jump on his feet and wrap Bobby in an outstanding hug.
Dean rolls his eyes affectionately. It’s been a new thing of Cas lately, enquiring about how Dean’s body feels after they have sex. Only because he winced
“Don’t think you can use this excuse to get you out of conversations you don’t want to have.”
A lot is going to keep unfolding in the next couple of chapters so hold on tight, and for the love of God please check the trigger warnings before each chapter. I know I've said it a few times already, but this is a story that deals with heavy subject, and even I as a writer sometimes manage to trigger
“I fell. M’fine.”
How do you stay mad at someone who’s dead?
There it is again. That tone of concern, the warmth of Missouri’s hand on Castiel’s knee. He breathes in, breathes out, just like she’s taught him. When they’re eyes connect again, Missouri is smiling at him.
“Is it though? You’ve been telling this for six years and it’s never been okay.”
Soooooo... How are we feeling about this? Did you notice all the little tidbits that are threatening to explode? What are you expecting in the next chapter? TELL ME EVERYTHING. 👀
“Come here,” Dean says softly, tugging at Cas’ waist until he moves and presses himself flush against Dean’s chest.
“I want to —,” Cas whines as Dean’s hand twists in an almost painful stroke around him, his thumb smearing the droplets of precome on his length. “
Benny clears his throat, clearly uncomfortable, and Dean’s heart starts going up again. Benny doesn’t get uncomfortable over a lot of things. Something is definitely up.
Benny claps him on the shoulder before going inside and quickly coming back with a backpack on his shoulder.
(See the end of the chapter for
All of it was different with you. We knew that forever didn’t exist for us, and neither of us cared. However this would end, you’d have been worth every second of pain I might have had to carry with me. The truth is, I loved you from the beginning, and no matter how much time I had left, I would have loved you until the end.
The world had been quieter ever since they knocked Chuck off the board and rode into the sunset to wherever life would take them. A couple of hunts here and there, nothing too complicated to take care of, and both brothers had allowed themselves to let go little by little, finding solace in figuring out what the rest of their respective lives could mean now that they were finally free.
Dean scoffs. “Didn’t know I had one.”
And Cas
“Get the fuck over here before I change my mind.”
Dean immediately takes his phone out of his pocket as both men make their way back inside. Balthazar collapses on the couch, like someone who’s familiar enough with this house to know exactly where the softest spot is.
Jimmy sensed it as soon as he entered the apartment and found it absolutely silent, with Cas in no line of sight. Call it a sixth sense or some sort of eerie twin connection, but when he pushed the door of the bathroom open and found Castiel sitting on the floor very obviously pushing heroin into his bloodstream, he didn’t even flinch.
Cas can’t help it- he burst out laughing.
Maybe it’s the way he says it, like it’s not the most cheesy pick-up line in the world but just a simple definite statement, but Dean feels it in his bones for a long time afterward, like a shockwave. He doesn’t answer, just press a lingering kiss right where Cas’ shoulder meets his neck, trying to convey every single thing he feels into a simple touch.
When Dean finally breaks away, it’s with a simple question making its way over his lips:
Now, there’s not a lot of things that Jimmy could recognize anywhere — his mom’s perfume, the smell of apple pie, his best friend’s laugh in the midst of a thousand other voices… but most of all, the distinct sound of leather slapping against skin and his brother’s voice as he yells in pain.
I saw Jimmy for the first time since leaving Lawrence today. He insisted we FaceTime once I made it home from my 6-month deployment in Iraq just a couple of hours back, and I indulged. I saw pictures over the past 8 years obviously, but it’s different to have real-life Jimmy smiling back at you, even if there’s a screen between us. And as I was watching him, I realized how much of me is still missing you. I haven’t seen any pictures since I left. The only one I have is an old polaroid I took of you, and it’s tucked away in my wallet. I don’t look at it. Looking at it just hurts me in more places than I ever know could hurt.
pinning him to a wall and sucking the living shit out of his mouth. And it’s been
“You’re telling me.”
But he’s not. He’s never going to be here anymore. And it
“Hey,” he starts, making his way to him. “Where have you been?”
” against his lips right after.
There’s a whimper at the end of the line and the arousal in Cas’ guts punches through him at the sound. He can’t resist slowly gripping his own cock from where it’s straining against the fabric of his boxers, stroking lazily as he listens to Dean. His lips curl into a smile and he can’t help but bite down his lower lip to keep himself from moaning slowly.
It takes Sam a whopping three minutes before he cracks.
Truth be told, he
And sometimes it’s here as they’re falling asleep, before one of the biggest choices they’ve taken in their whole life.
“Fine,” Jimmy answers, and it really takes a lot out of him not to crack.
Cas closes his eyes at the slight touch of Dean’s thumb over the ridge of his cheekbones and huffs into Dean’s mouth as he pulls him into a soft kiss. His fingers curl into the collar of Dean’s old shirt as they trade shallow kisses, finally alone for one last night in a space they’ve called their own for months.
“I’m excited to finally meet him next week,” Cas admits.
“Well, I don’t want to pressure you or anything. I just- I want him to see us. I don’t want him to learn this from anybody else.”
Does Dean still love him now?
Dean is wearing a blue checkered shirt with a pair of grey pants that highlights every single one of his best features (including but not limited to his ass), and Cas hates it. Hates the way it invariably attracts his eyes and takes his breath away every time he walks close by.
It’s unfair, totally meant to hit him front and center with all the venom he can’t spit. And he knows it, but can’t find it in himself to even look back at what he just said.
He soldiers on and walks through the apartment, only to find Dean sitting on the floor in front of the bay window. He has a blanket wrapped around his shoulders, and both of his hands are tightly gripping a cup of what looks like fresh coffee. It’s in one of Cas’ favorite mugs, the one he got for Dean more than a decade ago that says “Chaos coordinator fueled by caffeine” in gradient bisexual flag colors. He didn't even know Dean had kept it all these years until he eyed it on the kitchen counter not long after Dean had moved in last year.
They forget to tell you that sometimes, falling off the wagon is caused by utter and complete despair. They forget to tell you that sometimes all it takes for you to dig your phone from your pockets and dial your old dealer’s number is finding out your brother lied to you for a decade and cut someone you loved out of your life for seemingly no reason. They don’t tell you the blood on your hands is what triggers the actual physical
Charlie nods, checking on her phone while Dean goes back to the never-ending listings Sam has sent his way. Trying to filter through what he wants and what he doesn’t.
“Don’t go,” Castiel repeats, his voice starting to rise and Dean instantly knows he’s getting close. “Don’t go, please, don’t go.”
Sam locks eyes with him instantly, and Dean can read the surprise on his brother’s face.
, Dean? I can’t even think about you leaving, do you really want me to think about you
The sandy-brown kid is smiling at him.
“One doesn’t cancel the other. Actually, it strengthens it.
“I’m fantastic, and this was perfect,” Dean groans. “Love you.”
He half expects Cas to retort with something slightly bitter, a “you know I’m not an angel anymore” that would come out of his mouth before he could stop it. But Cas just keeps swiping his fingertips over the line of his jaw and down his neck tenderly.
He hates the way his voice sounds like his entire soul has left his body, leaving him breathless and crackling all over again. Hates that he keeps discovering that everyone around him apparently loves lying to him.
and/or
“What about you? Marriage? Kids?” he asks, deflecting instead of answering.
“Buds?”
Castiel is halfway through a pint of mint chip ice cream and an episode of Queer Eye when it hits.
“Hey. Head’s up,” Bobby asks and Dean complies, his eyes meeting with his uncle’s. “You know he’s never ran from you in the first place, right?”
Cas looks at him, visibly unsure, so Jimmy pushes on.
Cas wrote him a letter.
“What more do you have to lose? Nothing. If it goes the same way as the first time, at least you tried. But there’s a good chance that Bobby just wants to hear you explain why you left, and a chance to hear what happened to his kid.”
Charlie’s silent for a second. Then she bursts out laughing.
Some parts of what Dean has shared with him last night resurface, and Cas’ heart grows a bit heavier at that. Dean had opened up to him for the first time, and for the first time Cas saw what war did to him — the look on his face when he talked about losing his friend, or how he quickly deflected when Cas asked about what they did to him during his training. The “
Deep down, there’s a point that Dean can see, about trying his best to protect Cas. He’d be a fool to say he wouldn’t do something similar for Sam.
I’ve learned to rely on these guys more than I ever relied on anyone. That’s what makes us who we are, and right now that’s about the only thing that I’ve got beside Sam. Another round of brothers. Another big, merry band of idiots than I can call family.
There’s a beat. Cas huffs, his voice sounding annoyed. “You’re an idiot.”
But still, I never thought of you as something I’d have to survive until recently, and it breaks my heart that this is what we have become to each other. A burned mark into each other’s book, and the long-gone promise of never letting go of each other.
The nerves start rising and his mind starts wandering off to anxiety-land again when they make it to Charlie’s to meet up with Sam over lunch, and the first thing Charlie asks is “Where’s Cas?”
“Is that really that surprising? They’ve been tracking your recovery, they know you’ve been doing well. Cas told me earlier how your therapist thought you could come back to 100% even with your prosthetic.”
“Yeah, you’d better have an explanation,” Dean says as he sits back next to Cas, making sure to keep his hand on Cas as if in complete tune with what he needs right now — and Cas needs Dean’s touch like he needs oxygen, or he’s going to drown.
Jimmy leans back against the counter, arms crossed as he looks at Dean. His friend looks visibly hurt, if not for the way his eyes seem watery even from where Jimmy’s standing, then for the slight tremor of his hands plastered against the table.
“Had a bad day. Bobby invited me over. Drank too much. Now I’m lying on the floor of my old bedroom.”
He watches closely as Cas cautiously opens up the gift Dean had chosen for him, his heart beating so loud that he fears it might give out. When Cas finally discovers what’s inside, his face twists into such a loving expression that Dean feels relief coursing through his veins.
Then he ducks his head to look at Castiel’s face, and although he’s still pretty shaken up from whatever he dreamed about, his eyes are steady, unwavering.
“Listen. He wanted me gone, he got what he wanted. I was gone for 10 years, and now I’m back. I’m not gonna skip my best friend’s funeral—,“ Dean’s voice breaks there. He has to breathe to finish, oxygen rushing to his head and making it spin, “just because his brother and I used to have a thing.”
“We don’t have a couch,” Dean retorts with a chuckle before leaning down to place a soft kiss on Cas’ lips, effectively shutting him up. “Okay grumpy- how about we tell everyone to go home, order in from the Chinese restaurant down the road and enjoy one last night in this place? What do you say?”
It’s 5 am and no one else in the world could bother him at this hour if it wasn’t for Benjamin Laffite.
The heavy silence that follows only gets cut by Jess.
In spite of what happened with Charlie earlier today, she’s still the most qualified person Cas can talk to about this. Still his friend. And the only one who’s probably still awake in his contact list.
,” Dean says as he lies him down on the bed. “You’d make a pretty bride though.”
“Dean, don’t-”
Castiel and Jimmy’s lives were a bunch of messed up stories already when they wound up in Lawrence. A dad that never recognized his children, a mom that did her best but still always put her heroin intake before the well-being of her twins, and a cascade of scars and butchered stories. By some unclear circumstances, the twins ended up in Foster Care in Lawrence, Kansas. And that’s when the abuse started.
“Not particularly no,” Dean says, shifting uncomfortably on the leather seat of his car.
”, you know?”
Dean's pinky fingers tattoo:
It’s the middle of the night now, and I really should be asleep. We’re gearing up for another OP early in the morning and I should be in bed. Instead, I’m thinking about you.
Sleeping might have been a waste of time more than a decade ago, but kissing Dean in the backseat of the Impala on a quiet summer night in Utah actually sounds like Heaven.
“We kissed, we… drunk made out. He told me he loves me.”
“It should have been his choice, Jimmy!! You stripped it away from him! Not to mention that you not only broke his heart, you quite literally fucked him up for good.”
“Went to the gym. He should be back in an hour. Said he’d bring dinner back.”
Mission accomplished.
“You’re in a good mood,” he says as he unpacks the bagel Dean got for him.
“Like hell you’re not,” Balt cuts off, waving a thank you at the bartender as he hands him a fresh pint in hand. “You’ve been glued to the counter all night, it’s only your third beer despite the fact that we’ve been here
There’s a beat in the room, a silence that’s all but light, loaded in every way, before Dean adds with a broken voice.
“You’re not being fair to me right now,” Dean answers, his voice soft despite the distinct hurt at Cas’ words.
Cas shakes his head, a soft smile on his lips. What on Earth has he done to deserve a friend like Balthazar, capable of driving him crazy at any point but also to be of advice and a shoulder to cry on whenever he needs to, he doesn’t know.
“I don’t know why I knew that he’d be here but when I made it he was on the floor struggling to breathe and I called 911 but I think it was too late already,” Dean manages to say with a breathy voice. “He can’t die Jimmy, he can’t-”
come back to haunt his ass if he stopped. He hates that after almost 8 years, sobriety is still always a matter of toeing an invisible line that you can end up crossing at any time.
“I’m gonna hang up the boots, brother.”
Charlie nods in understanding. “Okay.”
“Seriously,” Cas presses on, nonchalantly propped up on one elbow as he looks at him with concern floating into his eyes.
Dean is beautiful under him, writhing with every thrust of Cas’ hips against him, looking so vulnerable and pliant that it almost feels surreal. He whines and moans into Cas’ mouth as he drives harder and faster into him, his legs trembling around Cas’ waist where they’re tightly wrapped, his heels digging into the meat of Cas’ ass.
“Missed you,” Cas breathes out, trying not to make such a big deal about how his entire body relaxes into Dean’s embrace, even after months together. “If you think we should bring it up with Terry, just do it. I don’t think he’s suffering from separation anxiety but it’s better to check regardless.”
“I’m not
It’s like a bucket of ice-cold water has been dumped on Dean as the words almost resonate into the night and Dean’s mind has trouble processing it.
“It’s nothing,” he dismissed, and once again Cas could feel his entire body go rigid against him.
March 11, 2018. 8 years since Dean left. 6 years sober.
“Are you alright,” Cas asks again and Dean can hear the smile on his lips all the way from here.
“We’re grown-ups, Sammy. I think we’re over it.”
Cas sighs. “Balt—,”
PS: To my non-smut peeps, skip after the second three-star divider!
“It’s okay,” he says softly as his other hand gently runs against Dean’s hairline. “We’re going to be okay. This isn’t me walking out on you, or giving up on us, alright?”
It’s pretty stupid, really. The way Dean’s entire brain cuts out of oxygen for a solid second once he catches Cas’ frame through the living room- he’s wearing his best pair of jeans, the one that hugs him in all the best places, and one of Dean’s old Zeppelin shirt with his washed-out denim jacket on. His hair is in even more complete disarray than usual, but what gets Dean is the glint in Cas’ cobalt blue eyes, and the way he freezes in front of the couch when his eyes lock on Benny.
“I mean, in some sense yeah. It’s not like I have an urge to know. I just… hope he’s doing okay. Losing Jimmy has taken a toll on me even if I hadn’t seen him in years, I can’t imagine how it feels for him.”
A round of applause for the magnificent
“Damn right I do!” Benny laughs easily.
If Dean’s being honest with himself, he always thought that Cas was pretty, from the very beginning. Those cobalt blue eyes staring at him across that barn in South Dakota like they could see right through him (well, retrospectively speaking, he probably could) the first time they meet were permanently engraved inside Dean’s soul, no matter how much time it took him to actually admit it to himself.
“And what, you think I don’t know that? Again, you’re one to
“It’s me. I’m real, babe. It’s okay.”
Dean gasps into the warm, hopeless press of Cas’ lips against him and Cas feels like he’s both drowning and flying. Like a supernova exploding into the air and being reborn into another universe.
“So you still don’t know what to do, is what you’re telling me?”
Scars will always be there. Dean’s trauma and the load of the war he still carries on his back won’t disappear tomorrow. But it’s not about forgetting what they’ve been through, it’s about working through it together. It’s about learning how to function with each other as a unit. It’s about finding a way to fit the broken pieces together again.
He slides his arm over the fake red leather of the seat, angling his hand just enough so that his fingers rest on the nape of Cas’ neck, brushing softly against the angel’s skin. Sam rolls his eyes at him, just like the previous gazillion time Dean has played this joke on him, and brings the glass to his lips to taste the Cosmo his brother just got him instead of the beer he’d wanted in the first place.
There’s no heat in Castiel’s voice, he’s genuinely asking. And Dean hears the tone of amazement in his voice like clear water.
Which is stupid, by the way, because there’s no way anything is going to happen between him and Dean ever again.
“What do you mean?”
Cas slides a hand from where it’s been resting gently on the back of Dean’s head to his face, carefully running his thumb over the swell of Dean’s bottom lip while Dean suckles at the tip of his cock.
Cas cocks an eyebrow at him and Dean feels his heart accelerate. It’s stupid really, they’ve been back together for three weeks by now, they’ve known each other for years. There’s no reason he should be stressed about this.
“Do you… Do you not want to?” Cas says, voice as flat as possible but Dean can see the wheels running wild beneath his scalp. “Have sex with me?”
They’re making their way to security when he finally grabs Cas by the sleeve of his jacket and stops him on his track. The other man looks at him curiously, one eyebrow raised and his signature head tilt.
“What about Sam?” he asks instead, thinking about the younger Winchester who’s lost his mom at barely 6 years old and had to watch as his father walked away and never came back for his two sons just months ago.
Of course, there was Jimmy. There was Dean. But Jimmy was wicked-smart and soon enough he’d realize how fucked up his own brother was. He’d leave, too. As for Dean, well… Dean was too good for him, always had been. Soon enough he’d grow tired of him, just like his mom had. Just like every single one of the boys’ guardians had.
. What I
“It shouldn’t be possible,” he whispers against Dean’s lips, his breath hovering over his mouth.
“Dean?” he asks after a minute, making a point of keeping his voice extra soft. “What’s going on?”
Sitting on the deck, he reaches for the bottle and comes to the realization that he might have left Afghanistan as a wounded shell of a soldier; but here in Lawrence he’s still a soldier. Only the battlefield is now home and it’s left to him to patch things together again.
The door slams shut behind him and suddenly he’s alone in the warmth of this mid-May night.
You’re turning 22 today, and I should be with you. Instead I’m inside a C-17 heading toward an OP in the Middle East, and I don’t know if I’ll be alive long enough to ever see you again. Sometimes it soothes me. Tonight it drives me insane.
“I know,” Cas answers, drawing back slightly to look at Dean’s face. “But you want to take me to Christmas with your family.”
It’s already dark outside when he rises up to his feet and stumbles out of his office.  Suddenly the apartment silence is too much for him to handle.
“I’m not.”
his life always has to get away from him. It takes Benny comically hunkering down to catch his eyes for Dean to realize he’s been brooding for close to 20 minutes.
He studies Dean’s face from up close, his glorious freckles visible over the moonlight. When Dean doesn’t answer, he gently kisses over the stubble of his jaw, his thumb brushing at the corner of Dean’s mouth, padding over his lower lip.
He wraps Castiel into a hug, and hopes for the best.
your one that got away?!”
He thinks of being 18 and scared out of his mind, of having to pray that the love of his life was going to make it out alive as paramedics tried to revive him.
“Fuck off, Cas.”
, right there with you.”
When Castiel started doing drugs, he started with pot like most kids his age. It was a way to forget the crap happening at home, forget everything about how he felt. But unlike most kids his age, he quickly moved on to better, harder things. From then on it was a downward spiral. It was so easy to lose himself in the sensation, to allow himself to float into nothing when life was so shitty back on Earth. No dad, no mom, scars littered on his body where the hands of a guardian - someone that was supposed to keep them
“I can’t bear the thought of losing you, which motivates me to do stupid shit that, in turn, makes
Dean can’t help but smirk at him. He did go at it pretty heavily this morning, but Cas seemed very content about it, judging by the sounds that came out of his mouth.
He doesn’t mean for his tone to be this clipped, but it does. Chalk it up to exhaustion or being an actual asshole, whatever. The fact of the matter is, Dean’s face falls even further. Cas can see the hurt painted on his face before he schools his feature back to normal, an exercise he excels at.
“What is it?” he asks softly, patting Cas’ hand on his knee. When Cas raises an eyebrow at him quizzically, he adds, “I know there’s something you want to ask, and I know you’re not letting yourself do so.”
But it’s real. They’re real. They won and they’re free. And Dean loves him so much that sometimes it still feels surreal, being able to stare at him with no shame, knowing they’re allowed the chance to be here together for as long as they want to.
“I love you too,” Dean says, shuddering at the weight on those words, relishing the press of Cas’ lips against his neck.
“Dean, you sure you’re okay?” Sam asks as he hands a beer to his brother over the arm of the couch Dean is slumped on, “Maybe you should stay and sleep instead—“
For so long, Cas had wondered. Jimmy was the only other person on Earth he could read like an open book, so of course he had noticed a shift 10 years back after his overdose. He wrongfully assumed that Jimmy only felt guilty because he hadn’t been able to prevent Cas from spiraling into drugs — which was stupid. Cas’ addictions were no one else’s fault but his.
It’s not like he doesn’t want to see Bobby. Ever since he set foot in Lawrence two days before, all he really wants to do is go to Bobby’s and try really hard to put the pieces back together. Apart from Sam, Bobby’s the last family he has. The situation has been weighing on him for so long, it’s actually growing more and more unbearable.
I miss you. I still love you. I wish my heart could stop searching for you. Would stop aching when it realizes it can’t reach you anymore.
And he hates it. Hates the way his body still finds ways to betray him even after the way Dean’s behaved toward him, ever since they did what they did after their party, already two weeks ago.
But this entire interaction with Holli and Dean has been a light into his gloomy mood, and he can’t stop giggling at the way Dean’s face completely lights up as he laughs.
Sam asks after pulling himself together.
“I love you too.”
Castiel’s smile is like a shooting star through the darkness.
Holli is a big part of Dean’s life and by extension Cas’, even if he spends way less time with him than Dean. But there’s a couple of things that everyone has told them they couldn’t let Holli get away with. Which is why they’ve come to a consensus that Holli would only sleep on their bed if Dean experienced a crisis during the night. So far it only happened a couple of times, but Holli still tries almost every night before usually retreating to his bed in the living room.
“I tried. Every single time I wanted to do it, something happened. And now Dean’s in a hospital bed and it’s all my fault.”
He closes his eyes and breathes in. Breathes out. Just like his therapist taught him as a way to bring his heartbeat back down. He feels Dean’s hands finding him again, reaching out for his palms and accepts them again. When he opens his eyes, Dean’s vibrant green’s are staring at him, almost pleading.
“So Cas has barely been away for a day and you’re already being all Broody McBroodiest about it?” Bobby says, clearly teasing him.
Dean gulps, knowing that Benny’s about to kick his ass whatever he says. So in the end he says nothing, and Benny ends up picking up the conversation again.
And he knows, deep down, that he’s reacting unfairly, that nothing Cas has done could ever push him to think he’s going to leave him behind- hell quite the contrary actually.
“Okay, but do you
He spends an unhealthy amount of time out with Balthazar, stumbling into the apartment at ungodly hours, visibly smashed. Dean doesn’t miss the Instagram posts, and he wishes he could say that it doesn’t spark something nasty in him, but it does. And he knows that’s the point.
“No, no, no. I’m cooking tonight,” Dean interrupts, pointing a finger at him with a determined look plastered on his face. “I don’t wanna hear anything. I know you. I know you don’t cook, but I do.”
“Cas, buddy- are you drunk?”
It would be lying to say that Dean doesn’t miss him. He misses the laugh, misses the report of Balthazar’s latest shenanigans, or Cas complaining about a deadline. He misses the way Cas’ eyes crinkles at the joke he tells, or the sound of his laugh when he manages to say something funny enough. He misses movie nights, explaining the point of an entire movie to the other man and still ending up with an “I don’t understand”. He misses the excuse of having a too-small couch to press against the warmth of Cas’ side.
“You scared?” he asks when they part just a whisker, his breath hovering on Cas’ lips.
There’s mirth in Dean’s eyes, and Cas knows they’re headed for a merciless battle. Not that he has any complaints.
He pulls back to look at Dean, his eyes automatically wary. Dean chuckles, recognizing that look for what it is, knowing there’s a full cross-examination coming.
— /skɑː/
“Sir? Sir,” the nurse’s voice finally cut through his thoughts and Dean’s eyes refocus on her. “Are you okay?”
“Nothing,” Cas says as he stares into his beer. “I just miss him, that’s all.”
A list where ‘Arborio rice for tonight’s risotto’ was clearly written.
“I love you too, angel.”
That’s how half of their stuff got here, including the fluffy carpet Castiel is lying on right now. He’s so lost in his thought that he doesn’t hear the front door open and doesn’t realize he’s not alone anymore until Balthazar’s voice chimes in from the corridor.
“Did I break you?” he chuckles against sweaty skin. “Was it that good?”
“Thanks for sharing that with us, Castiel. It’s important to remind you all that it’s okay to fail. It’s okay to have moments where you feel weak, where you feel like giving up. But it’s important to focus on how you manage to overcome these situations. Castiel had a friend, sometimes what it takes is a text, or a phone call, or a meeting. Reach out to the people around you. Don’t be afraid to hold onto others.”
Yeah, 10-years-ago-Dean-freaking-Winchester would’ve drowned the simple thoughts in a mountain of shots.
Charlie straightens on the couch as she looks at him expectantly. Dean picks up, wondering how to phrase it.
When Castiel hangs up and finally crashes on his couch, he feels like he’s suddenly a decade older. Holding back a sob, he sinks his face into his palms and quietly proceeds to cover his eyes.
Learning that Charlie knew about Jimmy’s lie took a toll on Dean, but it’s nothing compared to what it did to Cas. Dean could see the pain on his face and the anger rising by just looking at him as they finished their lunch together. He made a point of keeping a point of contact with him all the way through the rest of the meal, to make sure he knew he wasn’t alone. And it worked. When they parted ways with Charlie, Cas embraced her as he said goodbye, told her that despite needing some time they were still friends.
It’s already pushing 8 pm, but the lights are out in the apartment. Dean takes his duffel bag out of the trunk and makes his way to the door, ready to take his key out when it opens before him.
Looking back on it, he’ll probably blame it on being lost in thought, or onto his monstrous hangover. The truth of the matter is he doesn’t think to check before crossing like he usually does.
He’s always loved running, as far as he can remember. It helps keep his mind in check, grounds him. His creativity tends to overflow after a long run, his brain works faster, and the fact that he gets to lose himself into the music blasting into his ears is just the cherry on top.
Jimmy loved watching the sunset whenever he’d find himself home at night, which admittedly didn’t happen a lot since he was more busy running around.
There it is. Green eyes meeting his, looking like they’re floating somewhere else. Dean’s breath stutters and for a second he looks so utterly
“Cas, you can’t answer my question with another question,” Dean chuckles.
And I want this, Dean, I do.
“I’m not… I don’t expect anything anymore. I don’t think he’s ever going to come back. It’s been a long time, he probably moved on years ago, probably has a wife and a kid or something.”
It’s not a secret that Dean Winchester is a grumpy bastard until he gets through at least two cups of coffee in the morning. One would argue that he’d gotten better at being a tiny bit more sufferable in the morning ever since Cas and him had figured out whatever the hell they had struggled to figure out for the past decade, and the former-angel had now secured a permanent spot beside Dean on the memory foam mattress in Room 11.
“No,” Dean interrupts, tugging Cas closer against him as he rolls on his side to press against his chest. “What the hell do you have that’s weighing so hard on your conscience that you feel the need to get up at 6am to go
“No you don’t,” he smiles instead, trying to ignore the knot inside his stomach. “Go.”
When he wakes up Cas is still awake, petting his hair tenderly as he watches the rain still pouring out the window.
“Have you- do you know where he is?” Cas asks carefully, knowing that the John subject is a bundle of very intricate feelings in this house.
The response to the first chapter of this story has been a bit overwhelming, thank you
Dean starts moving forward through the crowd until Cas almost crashes into his arms, and suddenly it feels like all his broken pieces fit back together again.
Somehow it seems to sober him up instantly, and Cas sags against the cool surface of the fridge until he’s sinking to the floor, eyes fixated on his bloodied hands.
Dean lifts the paper bag and the coffee cup. “Charlie asked me to run an errand. Said you might need a pick me up.”
“I get it.”
,” Cas struggles to say, one of his hands hitting Dean in the sternum, his other still fisted into the fabric of his shirt. “You can’t go out there and I can’t lose you. I can’t, I
“Alright. I have a proposal.”
Cas nods, looking down on the river below the deck.
“Dean- oh baby,” Cas whines as Dean presses more kisses against the curve of his throat, his hips shifting slightly as he starts thrusting lightly into Cas. “Oh fuck,
They’re going to be okay.
Cas answers, his voice gruff as Dean kisses that soft spot behind his ears that tends to make him whimper,
Then his mind wanders as the road stretches out under Baby’s wheel.
He tries to ignore the pang of deception inside his chest- the crux of it all folded beneath his ribs, easy to forget- as he sits down in bed, covers pooling around his waist.
It’s January 1st of 2021, and for the first time in years Dean doesn’t wake up wondering where Cas might be, or how he might be doing. He woke up with Cas entirely wrapped around him like a koala, his stupid beautiful hair tickling his chin and watched as he gradually woke up into his arms, before giving him the first good-morning kiss of the year.
“What time are you picking Jo up tomorrow?”
Bobby watches him from head to toe before he steps aside to allow Dean in. He makes his way to the living room immediately, watching as Bobby goes back to his desk and sits on his chair.
“Then what?” Cas says, closing his eyes as Dean’s hand runs along his arm, trying so hard to soothe him. “What about what I want?”
Dean says playfully, setting up the coffee mug on the bedside table and extending a hand to ruffle Cas’ hair tenderly.
After 5 minutes, Cas joins him, silently rifling through the boxes.
“Yeah?”
And the best gift of all is the way Cas’ eyes glint with what are apparently tears as he figures out what the hell his best friend — no,
I remember the last letter you wrote to me, and your last line was a plea to “
“Says the guy who slept less than 4 hours per night for a decade,” Cas chuckles against him, throwing his arm around Dean’s waist to pull him closer against him under the cover.
Dean flinches at the reminder. They had planned this at least two months ago and Dean had to cancel just this morning because he had forgotten and he couldn’t get out of his supplier appointments. Cas didn’t seem to mind- he kissed him softly before he left this morning, told him he’d send him the pic when it’d be done, and told Dean to stop apologizing.
“Dean-”
Unfortunately Castiel is on the verge of a panic attack, and he doesn’t even have the energy to pay attention to these details when all he hears are the beating of his heart slightly out of time.
“You know what? Pigs are dying and I can’t deal with your cholesterol level now that I don’t have my grace anymore, so maybe I shouldn’t have gone back for your freaking bacon, Dean,” he deadpans, “besides, if you knew how to make a goddamn list in the first place, we wouldn’t be in this mess!”
“So what? I’ve got a steady job, you work part-time, we can handle it!”
This was a hard one to get through. I've rewritten the last part prior to the letter close to a dozen times and I'm still not entirely convinced it lands exactly where I want, since it's all really about nuance.
It barely takes a second for Dean to answer his call, and Cas finally smiles into the speaker as Dean’s voice comes up at the other end of the line.
But life for Dean is different now, too.
7. March 11, 2012
Cas isn’t one for pet names. But they tend to fall out of his mouth in bed and the way Dean’s pupil blows even wider at the simple mentions is just the cherry on top. It’s thrilling, intoxicating even. One of his hands finds its way into Dean’s hair and he threads his fingers tightly into the dirty blonde locks, tugging just the way he knows Dean likes, causing him to whine even more against the assault.
Cas moves his head back just enough to look at him, and can’t help his lips from moving slightly upwards as their eyes connect, “Hey. You look better.”
“To miss you this much when I’m away, even just for a day.”
“Because I didn’t put my sobriety on Jimmy’s fucking pedestal! Because Jimmy wasn’t the reason I stayed clean!”
He scoffs, trying hard to keep his composure as he stares at his hands, fidgeting with the hospital sheet before he reaches for Cas’.
“I woke up and you weren’t there.”
Benny laughs at him as he stands up. “Is that a yes? We’re gearing up for an op, everyone’s here. They’ll be happy to see you.”
I guess this is how the past grips the present. These are the echoes I can’t seem to shake.
Cas can’t help but roll his eyes, knowing there’s no sense in lying to her. “I know.”
“I know. You’re still not going running.”
“Okay well, she just cleared me to go work with Bobby again! I can start by the end of the week. I’ll have to call Bobby and see what he thinks, but all in all I guess I’m back to work? Which eh,” he punches Cas’ shoulder lightly with his fist. “Good news, right?”
“Then tell me now,” Cas says, interrupting his train of thoughts.
“And you’d want that?” Sam asks, eyes unwavering from Dean’s.
She snorts disbelievingly. “Like what?”
“Hey Winchester times two,” Gabriel greets them, shoving the rest of the Twix into his mouth. “Miss me? Fear for my life as I risked it trekking through foreign country, fighting the good fight?”
“FUCK YEAH!” Dean yells, skating over and hitting Benny in the shoulder.
“He wanted me to say yes. He wouldn’t tell me what I was saying yes to, he just told me if I believed, if I had faith, I had to say yes, and then everything would be okay.” She looks imploringly at Cas, lips quivering slightly. “I have faith, Agent Marlowe, I swear I do. I just didn’t want to say yes.”
“I don’t like her,” he announces. He’s not sure he’s saying it to anyone in particular, just knows he wants to say it, but Cas scowls darkly at him.
“No, you really don’t hafta—,”
“Shh,” Dean says quietly. “Just enjoy it.”
“I hear sometimes women will say yes when you ask them out, if you wanna try it,” Gabriel suggests.
“Well you could’ve moved me!” he retorts.
But Anna’s already shaking her head and turning. “Goodbye, Dean Winchester.”
“Cas,” he says quietly. “What did you do?”
“Well yeah,” he says immediately, confused. “Best friends.”
“Are you threatening me with mother, Michael?” Castiel laughs again. “That stopped scaring me the second I was able to move as far away from you as possible.”
“It’s those kinds of warm and gooey sentiments that I look forward to seeing on my birthday cards,” Gabriel tells him. “Come on, let’s go to the store. Maybe you’ll like it better when you’re not working.”
“What the hell are you wearing?” Dean asks, and his voice is hoarse, and he hates himself.
Castiel quickly relays his address, fumbling over the words a little as he stares down at his ratty jeans and water soaked T-shirt. Dean promises to be there within ten minutes and Castiel quickly sets his phone down to go change. He throws on a thick blue wool sweater and a nicer pair of jeans, pressing down on his hair with his palm before he realizes it’s a lost cause and just runs a hand through it again. He can actually hear the water dripping from his sink pipes now, which means it’s created a big enough puddle that he can hear the water hitting water, but he has no idea what to do about it. He’s just pulling a towel from the linen closet when the buzzer for the door downstairs goes off.
“Maybe I just think you look pretty in gold.”
“I fucking hate that asshole,” Dean tells him. “Give me a minute.”
“Tell me how to make you feel good,” Cas rumbles when he gets there, the shape of his lips and the words he’s making brushing against the lobe of Dean’s ear.
Baez draws a ball from the pitcher on field, and Dean takes the opportunity to point out the manual scoreboard to Cas. “It’s one of the oldest ones in the country,” he tells him proudly as the number of balls flips over to two. “None of that electronic crap.”
Ishim proves to be a real dick in record time, much to Dean’s relief. He’s always been more comfortable with just stabbing his problems in the face. He feels like maybe he should be upset with Cas like he used to be when he heard stories about how angels bulldozed their way through everything. Cas had part in murdering an innocent kid.
He’s got a fucking boner again too.
He’s gotta piss.
“Still younger than your face,” Dean retorts.
“Can’t I just come home with you?” Cas asks petulantly, and Dean is so taken aback by the question that he doesn’t answer before the door to the room bursts open and the whole team comes pouring in, talking excitedly.
He manages to stop just as the food is arriving, but almost starts all over again because Krushnic has this fucking ridiculous bemused look on his face as his steak is set down in front of him, like he’s never seen one before.
“I think it’ll survive,” Castiel frowns, hating the idea of ruining Dean’s plans for their date and making him fix his sink. “We can go.”
Now she just looks confused, which is fairly typical when they roll up pretending to be FBI caring about weird shit like this. “I don’t understand. Why would the FBI—”
Even Sam was being a jerk about it, telling Dean to just get over it and start focusing on the season. Not only was this Dean’s line, but he was always particularly pissed off when Sam played the high and mighty card, and he makes a silent vow to never pretend to listen to Sam bitch about anything again.
Dean knows what the answer is, but he asks it anyway. It’s like he can’t help it, like he needs to hear, if only to confirm what his mind is already telling him. “Tell me what?”
Finding out Billie is the new Death really puts things into perspective as well, especially as she’s showing Dean the thousands of books that each spell out a different permanent end to his life. “You and Sam have work to do,” she tells him.
“Keeps me on my toes,” Gabriel winks.
“I figured it was because he was being forced to eat lunch with you,” Dean retorts, no malice behind the statement. Castiel wonders how well Gabriel knows Dean. There’s an easy feeling of camaraderie between them that suggests they’ve done this many times before.
Eyes?
As long as you’re not someone like Buffalo, or Edmonton, it’s hard to go through the season without winning pretty regularly. All the same, the feeling never, ever gets old. You leave the stadium on a huge high from all of it, the cheering fans and the adoration of the reporters that crowded the locker room and every guy on the team in a fucking fantastic mood, even Gordon. It’s hard to go straight to bed after something like that, even if it is eleven at night and you have an eight a.m. flight in the morning.
Cas purses his lips. “I was in Moscow with a teammate, and we had hailed a car. We agreed upon a price before the drive, but when we arrived the driver insisted he needed eleven extra rubles we did not have. He would not let us out of the car until we paid, so my teammate punched him.”
“I just need a win.” He says it to Sam, but it’s a plea to the universe. He remembers Cas, what seems like lifetimes ago.
Krushnic gives him a confused look before turning back to the ride. It’s really just a lagoon type deal, where you boarded a pirate ship with water cannons so you could spray other pirate ships and targets they set up along the ride. There were also cannons all around the outside of the ride, so people who didn’t want to board a pirate ship could still join in.
“Cas was being a dick—,”
“What?” Dean asks urgently, and this time Chekov does jump off the couch, probably to go find Cas, who won’t launch him out of his comfortable resting positions. “Why? What happened?”
His room with Cas is all the way down the hall, at 343. When he opens the door, Cas is already there, flipping through the channels at a dizzying rate. Dean doubts he’s even registering what’s on the screen, and wonders again what the hell Cas did for fun in Russia.
Lisa skates around with him for awhile, and surprisingly enough talking to her puts Dean in a better mood then he has been in weeks. This stuff with Cas has been really grating on him, stuff he doesn’t really feel like he can talk to all the guys he hangs out with about (not that they haven’t tried) and the female presence is kind of nice. Not that he’s gonna talk about it with her either or anything, but he doesn’t feel like he needs to.
Benny’s the one who lets out a cheer first, short and sharp, and then Sam follows. Soon the entire team is cheering, and they’re storming out of the locker room and back onto the bench.
“M’sorry.”
“He’s trying to get you drunk so he can feel you up under the table later, Cas,” Dean says.
“Well, yeah, if you wanna meet other people,” Dean says, looking unimpressed. “Charlie’s awesome, but you haven’t talked to any of the cooks, or the perfume girls, or the guys down on one that’ll measure your inseam for ya.”
“M’not beautiful.”
The bathroom is at the end of a long dark hallway that leads back into the main area. Fumbling with his phone proves it to be 11:59, and Dean’s pretty sure he’s not gonna make it back to anybody he knows. Dim shadows and certain noises prove that the hallway is definitely the place you want to be to end the year with a bang, though, so maybe there’s some chick nearby who wouldn’t mind kissing him for the hell of it.
Dean bumps his glove onto Balthazar’s knee in solidarity and goes back to watching the game. True, it was punishment enough.
The nurse’s face brightens into a wide smile, and it’s so infectious that Dean can’t help but grin back. “Come with me,” she says, gesturing them past the desk. A small ways beyond it is a large common room, in the same bright colors as the hallway. Small tables dot the room, along with various puzzles and toys, posters reminding the kids to wash their hands and eat healthily. There are a couple of kids in there who all turn to gape at them, although only a couple seem to actually recognize them.
“This is where we have visitors,” the nurse explains. “In the public room. Krissy has her own room though, if you’d like to follow me?”
“Gee, I wonder why?”
“You and Cas were in a closet?” Sam asks suspiciously.
Cas growls low and deep in his throat, the vibration against him all Dean need to cant his hips forward, fitting a thigh between Cas’ legs and dragging a hand through the back of his hair and pulling to reveal the column of Cas’ throat. He begins kissing along Cas’ jawline as Cas’ hands run up his back.
Dean wakes up the next morning to Cas standing over him with a mug of coffee in his hands and almost has a heart attack.
“Here ya go, hotshot,” Jo says, sliding another beer in front of him. “Thanks for gracing us with your presence. A week is too long.”
Turns out Cas has a shit throwing arm.
“Bullshit,” is Dean’s knee jerk response, and he feels the familiar rush of anger that usually accompanies Krushnic and the dumb things he says. They can’t fucking keep doing this. They have a game in two days, the first home game. He wants to be able to play hockey again god dammit, to be comfortable with his team on the ice. He takes a deep breath. “Look, man, Bobby wants us to be buddies, and I want to be able to play hockey. So let’s make this as painless as possible, alright?”
He gets into his office and behind his desk then, quickly going through his emails before remembering what Benny said about Cas having left something for him.
-“ Dean moans, and Cas thinks fleetingly that he could almost come just like this, from rutting slowly into his own hand and hearing Dean moans just listening to the sound of his voice while he reminisces on a few actions in bed, truly lustful images of Dean and him popping up in mind as he starts thrusting up in his fist.
Jimmy might not be there anymore, and 10 years ago his lie had probably been crafted to protect his brother. But today he had also been the sole architect of Castiel’s demise, and Dean will never forgive him for that.
“I texted you before therapy, did you forget about that?”
“Two times felon, actually.”
Dean’s never felt so in love.
Jimmy nods at Charlie’s words. She’s right, it’s the best thing to do. It’s been ten years and maybe he’s about to lose whatever he has left of both Cas and Dean. But if it means they’ll finally find their way back to each other… well, it’s worth a try.
. But when we met… you always made me feel all of those things. We were only 10, and I was already just an angry little boy with a deadbeat dad and a dead mom, a little brother to care for and not even 20 bucks to my name. Yet you made me feel like I belonged, like I was meant to be something greater than anyone had ever thought. I was nothing, and yet you and Jimmy saw worth in me. You both came into my life and claimed me as one of your own, and for the first time ever I was finally someone worth a shot.”
“No Benny, I’m fine. Don’t worry about it.”
“What?” he grumbles.
“Maybe I should start adding these hashtags when I post stuff with you,” Cas says, all smug and, if Dean’s honest, terribly handsome.
“Get back to sleep, sweetheart,” Dean says groggily as he kisses into Cas’ hair one last time.
“Alright. So are you gonna say yes?” Charlie asks, having trouble concealing her excitement.
Dean finally enters the kitchen and finds his little brother sitting down at the table, seemingly reading on his iPad, a steaming cup of coffee and and a bowl filled with some healthy crappy cereals that he makes a point of adding to the supplies every time he’s in charge of grocery shopping  (
Dean is parking the car when he makes the decision. They’re walking the dimly lit hallway together, Dean’s hand clutched tightly into Jimmy’s, and Jimmy knows what he has to do.
Dean, in all his post-coital haze, must notice the wheels running full speed under his scalp, because his mouth softly brushes against his forehead, both arms bringing him closer against him.
Castiel eyes him carefully before he speaks again, “I didn’t know you two still talked on a regular basis.”
“Time keeps ticking and the more it does, the more I just realize that I feel more at home in a war zone with the risk of dying every damn second hanging over my head than I do here. And that’s… That’s fucked up, you know? Why can’t I just… Why can’t I connect with… with the people I love here? Why am I feeling like a stranger in front of my own brother, in front of you, or Charlie, when you’ve known me my whole life?”
Once it’s out in the open, there’s no taking it back. Cas’ eyes look even brighter in front of him. And maybe it’s the way the sun is slowly setting in front of them, highlighting him in a light orange glow, or maybe it’s just Dean being a lovesick idiot. But Dean could swear he feels part of his heart stitch back together as Cas moves closer, mouth hovering just mere inches from Dean’s own.
But the truth of the matter is, he had to spend his first Thanksgiving without Jimmy and it sucked; no matter how pissed he still is at his brother. On top of that, he also had to settle in with a text from Dean instead of actually spending Thanksgiving with him, Charlie, Jess and Sam; since both of them are still giving each other some space. Cas spent the day with Balthazar and Alicia. And despite the day being delightful, it still hurt to see the empty space beside him where Jimmy had always been for the past 28 years.
“It’s fine,” Dean tells Cas.
“Damn it all,” Balthazar mutters, and Dean focuses back on Bobby just in time to see him pulling out the playbook they’ve studied about a million times this season. He lets out a groan along with just about everyone else, except his groan evolves into a yelp.
Cas squints at him. “People here often pretend to be a sexuality they are not? This is normal?”
As if by magic, Sam appears at the table just then, a takeout bag of Chinese food in his hand. When he spots Dean, he reddens slightly, ducking his head. “I got lunch, Jess.”
So sue him. It did make his dick look pretty, and even if Dean’s not the most experienced guy with anal around, he has used lube before. He’s only ever used fucking glitter lube with Cas.
Castiel sincerely hopes that Dean didn’t ask him to come here for a secret liaison.
“Does it involve asking me to help adjust the grip on your stick, Dean?” Cas asks lowly. “Because if you’re asking my advice, you choke up too much on it when you get excited about scoring.”
“Goodbye, Sam,” Dean says forcefully, and he distinctly hears Sam chuckling before he manages to hang up the phone. Bastard.
. But no way was he telling the kid that. “Cas is his own issue.” He pulls off her skates and stands up, studying her for a minute. “You have a good time?”
Sam’s squinting at Dean again, but Dean’s finding it easier to ignore him this time. This is the greatest break he’s caught since Cas started distracting him with his stupid attractiveness. He’s not broken. It’s normal to get caught on a guy, apparently, even for hockey players like his dad. All he has to do is flush it out of his system and he’ll be good and back to normal.
“They do?” Dean asks doubtfully.
He shouldn’t have worried about Balthazar starting shit, mostly because not two minutes have gone by when one of Victor’s teammates heads after Chuck with the kind of focus usually reserved for suburban moms having a coupon catalog waved in front of them. Chuck, to his credit, manages to get out of the way despite his obvious horror, but he still catches the guy in the knee, somehow managing to stay upright even as the other guy’s momentum sends him down to the ice, hard. Usually the look of miserable confusion he sends at the ref would melt any heart, but he still gets sent to the box, and needless to say, the score is tied pretty quickly.
Man, this is awkward. No wonder it’d been so easy for him to dislike Krushnic. He has nothing in common with the guy, and on top of that, he won’t even talk. Either Krushnic is naturally close lipped, or people in Russia get around with one word sentences all the time.
“Jesus, Cas,” he gasps, breaking away. He fucking forgets how strong Cas is. Cas seems unbothered by Dean’s surprise, trailing his mouth along the line of his jaw instead, to the sensitive part of his neck just behind his ear.
So he lets Cas stay. And because he has slept for more than forty-eight straight hours, he gets to be wide awake.
Cas scrubs a hand across his jaw, which Dean notices is getting stubbly. The rasping sound it makes across his palm is followed by a reluctant, “Yes.”
“You wanna give us some space?” he says, trying to push past them. Cas says something too, but Dean forgets English isn’t his first language, and all these people yelling at once, words jumbling together, are clearly starting to confuse him and piss him off. “Back off,” Dean tries again, louder.
“Fucking incredible,” Ash says, almost reverently.
“Don’t miss, Dean,” he hears Michael murmur. Before he has time to respond, the puck is dropped and they’re off.
Cas’ eyes are burning into his own, and the ghost of his palm burns through Dean’s shirt to his skin.
Dean’s not sure what Trenton is wishing him good luck for, but he thanks him again and eats the rest of his sandwich.
Hell, it even got him some proud words from dad. When all that was left to eat was a bowl of Fruit Loops and a packet of ramen seasoning with some Speghetti-o’s, Dean never complained, just poured the bowl of cereal for Sammy and choked down the artificially chicken-flavored soggy noodles. He never inconvenienced John by getting sick off of something he ate. “Kid’ll put anything in his mouth,” his dad used to say, awarding Dean a rare half smile.
Cas purses his lips and looks entirely too skeptical for a hockey player who refuses to get into any fights himself, but settles back into his seat anyway, casually leaning into Dean and shoving a hand into the box of Cracker Jacks he’s holding in his lap. It is not a movement that makes his chest feel all warm and stupid, no sir-ee.
He loves Jack. He really does. Worse than that, hurting Jack would hurt Cas. But Dean has a responsibility to this world, to his people, and that responsibility includes not letting the most powerful being in the universe run around soulless.
It’s the old jealousy from when Jack first appeared rearing its ugly head again, but this time it’s worse. This time, Dean gave Cas the choice, and Cas didn’t choose him. He’s lost Cas to a half angel kid who, with Heaven’s help, is enslaving the planet. Dean’s logic says Jack needs to be gotten rid of. Cas’ love says that he can still be reasoned with. Their bond is breaking.
“Be careful,” he’s pretty sure he hears Cas say, but he has no idea what he’s worrying about as he slams the door shut and heads around to the front of the car.
That gets Cas to look away from his newspaper, and Dean tries not to get too distracted by his peach fuzz, and how the dark shadow across the lower half of his face makes his eyes pop something crazy. He also doesn’t think about how that beard feels scrapping across his thighs. “I get very enthusiastic during sex with you,” Cas says, frowning.
“Hunting,” Jo says matter-of-factly. “You know it snowed last night, right Dean? Maybe you wanna put on a shirt.”
“You know I can’t,” Sam says morosely. “Have you finally picked a name?”
“Besides which,” Anna speaks up for the first time, “I do not believe Dean would need the post office for a bride.”
A year. A year is how long Cas has been keeping this quiet, his deal with the Empty to save Jack. Dean wants to be furious with Jack again but he can’t, he can’t be anymore than Cas has never resented Sam for all the times Dean died for him.
“I wanted to get more coffee as well.”
Dean kicks his ankle, hard, and Gabriel yelps loudly, letting the bartender roll her eyes and walk away.
Dean has almost forgotten this footnote in their history, has not blamed Cas for anything that had happened back then since the night he appeared, filthy and dejected, in his and Sam’s motel room, spit out of Purgatory.
. Not that he’s ever watched that movie, and whatever Sam has to say about it is a lie. He pulls his toiletry kit out of his bag and heads to the bathroom to brush his teeth, because flying always gives him a sour taste in his mouth, and when he comes back out Cas is sitting on the bed with the TV turned on to some nature documentary.
“Is this the best hotel we’ve been in or what?” Dean asks, dumping his bag off his shoulder and collapsing onto the bed. They’re in Winnipeg, and while the hotel rooms they usually get put up in are never anything to sneeze at, this one is insane. All huge and fancy with glass and shit. He’s pretty sure there’s a spa here. “They fucking do
Cas is quiet for a long time, and Dean thinks, good. Maybe he fucked it up before it could even get started. It’ll hurt less. Because he can’t tell people he’s bisexual, or whatever. He just can’t. He’s seen the kind of shit the gay football players get, and there’s never even been a homosexual hockey player, retired or present. There’s no way he can be the first. He can’t handle the attention he’ll get, and he especially can’t handle the shit that will be piled on him.
“Just because
“Thanks,
“So big that we’re having it on the floor of our newly bought house after having tacos on a random night,” Dean laughs before diving down for another kiss on Cas’ lips. “God, I love you.”
They’re not kids anymore. Castiel doesn’t need a support system like he used to. And Dean… he still has a home to come back to.
is the concern here.
If he could fly, Sam would probably be halfway across the globe right now. Instead, he just runs back to the war room, grabs the keys to his car, and leaves the bunker so fast one might think he’d got his skivvies in a bunch.
The routine is nice and grounding, and it’s always a surprise when either of them breaks it.
He swallows with difficulty, trying to get past the lump in his throat. It’s something he’s been gearing up to do, that his therapist encouraged him to try: say the things that he really means, even if it takes more time to actually get past the discomfort. And Cas deserves to hear it, even if he texted it already.
Fitting.
What he doesn’t understand is why it frightens him so much.
for a goddamn second. At least while he’s throwing Jimmy’s clothes and memorabilia into the walls, all he can feel is the fabric of Jimmy’s t-shirts under his fingertips, the way his knuckles splinter slightly when he punches the wall, or the sound of papers when he tears it apart.
“Hell yeah,” Dean says with a smile, and watches as Cas grabs the bottle of lemon vodka from the table and two glasses.
“Okay idiot, I get it, I miss your ass too. I thought we were past that?” Benny ends up saying.
“And you’re being too hard on yourself,” Dean says as he bends down to kiss his forehead. “Why don’t you take a break? I’ll start dinner in an hour and you could relax in the meantime. Go get a hot shower or something.”
“Yeah, yeah. Go away, your boyfriend needs an escape.”
“Can we return to me trying to have sex with you now?” Cas asks with a knowing smirk. “Because we’re not getting any younger here.”
There are dozens of pictures in there. Some that Jimmy took of Cas, Dean, them together, or all three of them. A bracelet that Cas remembers having bought for his brother when he went to summer camp. A guitar pick that Cas is almost sure was a gift from Dean to Jimmy.
“Have you thought about seeing someone?” he finally asks very carefully, as if he’d weighed every word before saying it.
don’t have to. There are plenty of hunters that can take care of this.”
Sam says, quickly interrupting him,
“I know that.”
Dean answers while he makes his way to the hallway, the atmosphere quickly shifting into something a little bit too heavy for an early Sunday morning,
Cas must sense something in the shift of his voice as he finally raises his head to stare back at him. He can almost see his brain trying to work out what’s happening. They’ve always been like that, able to read the other like an open book.
on your face.”
It rises then, from the pool in his stomach all the way up to his throat before it hits his head. He has to quickly sit down, tries to sort through every single one of his feelings, but it’s already too late judging by how quick he’s breathing.
Cassette tapes over vinyl records. White wine one over red. Soccer over football (this one, Dean’s not sure he can get past it). Led Zeppelin III over IV (this one Dean let slides, because “Tangerine” is on Led Zeppelin III, and
He doesn’t know if it’s a remnant of the sixth sense he’s developed after a decade on the Teams or if it’s just a coincidence, but Dean raises his head back up to stare across space in front of him, and immediately freezes.
“Do you want to go to his grave and get those special blue roses we saw the other day?” Dean asks after a moment, speaking the words almost into Cas’ mouth as they break apart barely a whisker. “Or we could get that bottle of whisky we bought the other day and just drink it there with him. I’m sure he’d appreciate it.”
And well, yeah. That’s as solid as an argument can get. And if Dean’s heart stops hammering for a second, if his eyes start prickling at the corner, if his smile goes as wide as it can go, that’s nobody’s business but their own.
“But Dean… I — why?”
“Still like that huh?”
“We’re not—,” Dean tries to interrupt but Sam keeps going.
“I’m sorry,” Dean adds softly. “I don’t mean to add to your pain.”
“You-” Dean starts, but gets interrupted by Cas almost right away.
“And I’m trying to figure out why the hell you’re wearing orange briefs in bed!”
“I like it when you’re needy,” Cas all but whispers into the phone and delights in the whine it elicits from Dean.
“I love you too,” he whispers against the shell of Dean’s ear.
Something twinkles in Cas’ eyes and Dean gets it instantly. He’s not gonna talk in front of Benny, but something did phase him enough for him to forget about Benny’s arrival entirely. He squeezes his hand back, a smile on his lips.
Novak.
“You- you don’t think I’m ready?”
“What’s up with your brother?” Anna asks, looking at Jimmy with an eyebrow cocked.
It takes a while until they find their footing, until Cas finds his way on top of Dean, until their eyes meet with understanding and Dean murmurs “I want this Cas, I want you”.
“What really happened to you?” Bobby finally asks.
“Ha-ha, very funny,” Balthazar says as Cas lets him in.
Dean nods as Castiel makes his way to his bedroom to change, his dumb brain briefly making a point of remarking that Dean’s eyes are still on him.
Dean wraps his arms around him as Cas lies halfway on top of him, one hand quickly finding its way under Cas’ shirt and drawing abstract patterns into his skin. They stay like that for a while, just breathing together.
The damage extends from Dean’s hip on his left side up to the back of his left shoulder. If you concentrate hard enough, you can almost picture the blast. When Cas takes in the state of Dean’s leg and how it seems to have literally been licked by fire, he realizes that it’s nothing short of a miracle that Dean is still able to stand and walk as well as he is right now.
sweetheart,” he grumbles, starting the dishes.
“I miss him too. I’m still a long way from… I don’t know. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to forget. But I wish he could be there. I wish he could see us together. Sometimes it still feels like he’s here. Like he’s going to appear in the room and laugh at one of your jokes.”
of you. We’re retiring. Together. Because we’re old and we have a life that’s worth more than dying because of a werewolf. Okay?”
“Well, you forgot the beers and then the whisky, and then the BACON, Cas! It’s like you called it out on yourself,” Dean interrupts, and if Cas wasn’t so irritated already he would’ve caught the smirk and the playful tone, but he is, as a matter of fact, getting even more irritated by the second.
Cas hadn’t been able to suppress the warmth that bubbled and expanded through his chest at that, and all he had been able to do at the time was to hug his boyfriend tighter and promise him that they’d be
“Like hell you didn’t,” Charlie interrupts right away. “I know Dean loves his job to absolute death but he would have NEVER gone the military way before Cas- before
to be joking.”
Dean’s whole body shudders as the words tumble out of Castiel’s mouth. From the way his voice breaks to the pleading tone inside his voice and wraps around his heart already aching.
Dean nods before brushing a kiss on the marks, and can feel Cas almost violently shuddering against him. When he looks up at him, there are tears threatening to spill at the corner of his eyes. Dean leans in on his elbow and kisses him softly, trapping his bottom lip between his teeth gently and nibbling at the skin.
He watches as Cas makes his way to the corridor and disappears into Jimmy’s room, where Dean cannot reach him anymore.
“Yeah, of course,” he nods. “I just need 24 hours to make sense of the mess.”
“What slur did he use this time?” Jimmy asks as soft as he can, but he can see the way Cas’ shoulders straighten. “Cas, just tell me what he said.”
The stars shining above him seem to agree with that statement as he pushes the door to the apartment open and makes his way inside.
“What kind of motions are we talking about here?”
he’s wrecked him before sinking into the bed- content, exhausted.
Cas wants to tell him. Wants to explain that his entire life is a kaleidoscope of stories ending in him never being enough for anyone to ever care. Wants to explain that he’s terrified that Dean might end up walking out on him, because it’s the way every single one of the stories that compose Castiel’s life always ends. Wants to tell him that he would never want to inflict so much of his pain on someone he loves so much.
It’s a distinct sound between a scream and a sob, loud enough so that it tears through the silence of the night and hits Cas’ ears even before his eyes open. Once they do, he’s out of bed and into the corridor in close to no time before he throws Dean’s bedroom door open.
The bed is cold when he wakes up.
He stops there, slightly out of breath before Dean pulls him in for a kiss. It’s wet and a little desperate but Dean has needed this all day. He relishes the burn of Cas’ stubble against his chin and the delicious taste of Cas’ tongue when it finds him. They trade a few shallow kisses before Cas drops his head into the crook of Dean’s neck again, settling more comfortably against him.
twelve different directions — and he goes for green tea instead of his beloved morning coffee.

I wish things would be different. I wish I could still wake up and stare at your face in the morning. I wish I could still lose myself in the blue of your eyes. Pathetic, I know. I hope you’re okay. I miss you. I know, I said it already. But I miss you.
. This isn’t what was supposed to happen.
with you?” Because my injuries are not visible unless I’m half-naked or wearing something that shows my arm or my leg, right? Sometimes I foolishly think that if I had been injured
Dean doesn’t have a lot of bad days lately, but today has been particularly difficult. The fact that his leg picked this day out of all the others to fuck with him is just the cherry on top.
, he doesn’t say.
“I’m sorry,” he finally says, his voice soft. “About the yelling, and what I said, and the broken plate. I’m so sorry.”
“Evidently,” Cas smiles at the other end of the line. “Do you want to tell me about your day?”
I burnt your letters, early this morning.
me. It destroyed us! Why would you keep it for yourself!”
“Inside,” Cas pants. “Wanna feel you inside- Oh fuck Dean, f- don’t stop, don’t-”
They’re rimmed red, exhausted. Cas brushes a thumb along the line of his jaw, trying to convey how much he feels. Dean’s arms have wrapped tightly around his waist and they’re as pressed together as it’s physically possible.
Jimmy hugs Cas tighter in response, unable to find his voice, words staying at the back of his throat scraping him painfully.
He’s halfway through the room already, walking across the moms and crying kids, the elderly that’s almost asleep in his chair, when he catches sight of him and his heart stutters in his chest. His eyes focus only on him, Jessica rendered only a blur next to the one he only has eyes for.
In hindsight, maybe too quickly, judging by the sleek smile on Balt’s lips.
“I pulled the trigger. Hell, you know how many times,” he sneers. “Not all of them were warlords, or terrorists. There were kids, and women, and I can’t… I can’t stop thinking about it.”
about the airport itself, but Dean isn’t about to admit to that any more than he is ready to admit that his feelings for Cas are slightly stronger than the friendship they’ve been cultivating for more than two solid decades.
“Mhm,” Dean smiles into his skin, pressing one last kiss into the crook of his neck before tucking his face against his back, ready to fall asleep. “Okay. I’m here regardless.”
He eyes the space covered by Cas’ shirt where he knows the gigantic bruise that turned a specific shade of brown just a day ago on his ribs is situated.
(See the end of the chapter for
Plus, he’s 100% sure Dean hasn’t gone out today.
Of all the places Castiel would like to be at, this is very low on the list.
“Dean.”
Dean can’t help but tense at the mention of Jimmy’s name. If Bobby notices, he doesn’t say a thing.
Dean scoffs. “I don’t know. Yeah, probably.”
If anyone's interested, here's
Cas just smiles at him, trying to ignore the way his heart sunk at the mention of a name he doesn’t know, or the way Dean said it with a genuine gummy smile.
“Don’t full-name me, you asshole! You know damn well what happened!”
Cas doesn’t respond. Instead, Dean hears him shuffling around in the kitchen until he’s done with his chores, and concentrates back on his medical drama.
What if Jimmy still doesn’t mention anything about what he’d done? What if it’s a letter telling him how much Castiel is better off without him? Even worse, what if it’s a letter entirely unrelated to Cas?
The rest is secondary at this point.
“Okay. I fail to see how that’s bad?”
“Jesus,
Dean sighs, bathing for a second in that moment, in the warmth of Cas’ arms around him in that shitty motel room that looks like the other hundred motel rooms he’s been into in the past 42 years. In the quiet hum of the rain falling steadily as the city of Modesto, California, slowly wakes up.
They share an easy laugh and it almost makes Dean giddy on the inside, the thought that they can actually enjoy this now, without fearing monsters are going to barge in at any point crossing his mind.
When Cas finally sinks into sleep a few minutes later, he’s holding onto the way Dean’s breathed his name against his lips, and how it shooked him to the core.
There’s peace, and content, and joy, and so much love.
“Will you make me one of your unfamous Cosmos?” Dean groans against his lips.
The air in the room has changed from heated up just a couple minutes ago to reverent. Cas is looking at Dean like he’s the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen in the world, and for someone who’s had so much trouble looking at this new image of his damaged self in the mirror for the past 10 months, it feels slightly unreal.
5 minutes later he’s settled on the couch in Benny’s living room, a beer in hand and his friend looking at him expectantly. Nothing’s changed in the past two months, but then again Dean’s not surprised. Benny’s not one for change.
A couple of beers and whiskeys later, he ends up sleeping in his childhood bed because he’s a bit too drunk to be allowed behind the wheel. Bobby ushers him upstairs around midnight and Dean has barely collapsed with the comforter on the single bed when his phone rings.
“If you’re going to be fighting? Yes, absolutely,” Cas laughs.
“You ever think about… I don’t know, settling down?” Sam says quietly, softly, like he doesn’t really know if he’s allowed to ask. When Dean turns his gaze to look at him and arches an eyebrow quizzically, Sam continues. “Buying a house. Making an honest man out of Cas,” he laughs.
Charlie’s eyes grow soft as she looks at him, leaning against the kitchen island.
It starts rising inside his stomach once he leaves his office and goes into Jimmy’s room, wrongfully thinking that picking up where he and Dean left off a few days ago while they started going through all of his cluttering mess would do him good. Unfortunately, that’s his first wrong move.
I still do. That’s the issue here, I still do. And the ashes from the burnt letters are glued to my skin, the shadow of the words you wrote returning to ask me
and I was so scared-”
“Hey, I’ve been trying to reach you for 10 minutes. I’m just out at lunch with Jessica and,” he scratches his neck, cursing himself for being uncomfortable over the goddamn
Dean sighs. “Alright. Mail it back to me?”
For the first time since they got back together, Cas has a work conference to attend in Austin for 3 days. Dean's insecurities rise up to the surface.
“Yes and no. They offered me a desk job or disability severance pay. I was already leaning toward the latter because I couldn’t fathom being stuck behind a desk instead of being out in the field with my team. But when I heard about Jimmy I knew I had to come back.”
— Dean
Dean asks, his voice already heavy like he’s minutes away from drifting off.
“I can’t believe we’re leaving,” Cas says as they break away after one last kiss, Dean’s hand solid on his hips. “It still feels unreal.”
In a surprising turn of events that may or may not have involved Balthazar crashing into their living room the morning after Benny’s arrival, they decide to organize a small party at home with Jess, Sam, Balthazar, Alicia and Charlie the following night as a way for Benny to see everyone. He’s only staying 5 days, and it makes it easier for him to catch up with everyone and meet the few he hasn’t before. Dean makes dinner, Balthazar and Sam handle the booze, and all in all the evening is extremely nice and pleasant, conversations flowing and people meddling very quickly and smoothly.
