Dean reaches out to take Cas’ hand, but he jerks it back and stands up from the bed. Feeling abandoned and alone, with no one to defend him, Castiel lashes out like the wounded animal that he is.
"You dumbass. Your parents are gonna skin you alive. I'm pretty sure my dad will too, for making mom sick with worry," Dean says as he plops down next to Cas.
Dean aims a jab at his ribs and Cas dodges, lunging towards the door. “Hey! You know that’s unfair. And you’re supposed to reciprocate!” Dean laughs as he stumbles over to Ash’ bar. The guy is locked in conversation with another patron, so he just throws a couple of bills on the counter and they wave their goodbyes. Cas drapes and arm around Dean’s shoulders as they exit.
Castiel strides down the hall in a huff. “You’re a genius at this type of thing, and I’m not. What the hell was I supposed to come up with, huh? I can’t oppose someone of your level,” he proclaims and flails his arms in frustration.
A slow drumming of rain begins to pound against the metal roofing. Cas smiles, places the book beside the bed and stares at the ceiling, letting the pitter-patter lull him into a state of relaxation. He glances out of the window at the rainy, bare street outside, bathed in the fluorescent orange of the streetlights. It tugs at his memory peculiarly, like it holds some significant meaning.
Every fibre of his being is telling Dean to fight whatever is happening, to punch, scratch, and tear his way through it, that he hates this so completely, that these tears he’s seeing are so fucking wrong, so unacceptable in reality to be unnatural.
As the emergency exit doors shut behind Dean, and he’s catching his breath from the sudden burst of adrenaline, he can’t stop himself from laughing, and laughing hard.
"You were trying to be kind to me by taking me to where you thought I might experience pleasure and gladness, as you have experienced it, and I realize that," Castiel explains, scrutinizing the stars, "I do not mean to offend you or your efforts. You are only trying to be a good friend, which you are. I hope you know, though, that I am just as pleased, and just as glad to be sitting here, talking with you."
The tone of her voice is familiar to Dean; 'thanks, that's all well and good, but I'd prefer to have my person back.' There aren't any platitudes in the world that can replace a person, or take the sting out of losing them, and Dean gets it.
Their lives run parallel to each other; Sam is a father, a working man with a wife, and a legitimate social security number and shit.
“If you were blind, though, Sam, and you wanted me to explain to you what the color red is, I would not rest until I had exhausted all efforts to do so."
To Dean’s simultaneous horror and delight, Cas doesn’t relinquish any control; he won’t be moved, his hands get tighter and hotter where they touch Dean’s skin, he only presses them harder together, and he kisses Dean like he wants to
When Castiel chooses this moment to fall quiet, Dean steals a glance to check on him and finds him watching the blurred scenery pass them by.
He knows he’s worrying Castiel, but he’s quite literally lost all ability to communicate more eloquently than that, and thankfully, Castiel follows the direction without question. He's got more tact than that (most of the time), he'd never be telling Castiel to fuck off and forget everything that harshly, but he can't string the words 'you don't wanna fuck around in the Impala for pretty valid reasons, and what I wanna do to you requires space so we'll be fucking outside like animals, unless you have another idea about how the instantaneous, blazing fire of need you just lit in me can be met within the next few seconds,' together.
That response pulls a chortle out of Dean, and his future self looks like he’s gearing up to find something worse to say, so he intercedes before that can happen.
“Fine! Then risk everything and everyone else! Not my - no, I don’t care if it’s - no! I don’t care if it’s cruel of me, Dean! You are my one and my only!” Cas cried, throwing his arms out wide, “Irreplaceable! Do not ask me to make peace with the fact that you can, at any moment, be stripped from me for the sake of saving fools!”
Reverently, so tenderly, Castiel touches Dean’s cheek with the pads of his calloused, bloody fingers, a gesture inarguably intimate and loving, and Dean is leaning into it, he wants it - he
“Does it mean - you liked it? That I’d say it?” Dean’s voice comes out barely audible, and Cas gives him that sad smile Dean hates.
“I don’t mind that you don’t love me, Dean. But if you could lie for me - just once. For a moment… please…”
“I’ll be useful tomorrow,” Cas assures him, some degree of dissociation coming over him, “I’m not scared to die anymore. So, it’s okay. Dying is something I can do right.”
He spent his entire life being too grown-up for shit like that, too busy, too dangerous, and there were women - lots of women - that helped him feel a little better for brief hours, but he never felt like
They all take the cue for what it is and spend time ribbing him for it, and soon they're onto new topics, and hopefully forgetting whatever they gleaned from his eyes.
Nodding in a small way, Castiel answers, “the silence of it is the burden, the keeping of the secret is the torture, but I… it felt as if there was never time enough to set it down, or there was too much time that I took for granted, or feeling that… if I shared the burden of my secret, that the world would collapse under the weight of it, and I would lose everything for it… I told myself that carrying it by myself was the right thing to do, the kind thing to do, but maybe that was another lie I told myself. To comfort myself.”
Claire takes three months to prepare the event all the while insisting that it's 'not that big a deal,' and alluding to how she doesn't care how it turns out; her planned service lands on a warm, Thursday evening, and Jody hosts them all.
- treats him like that. Especially not a cheap knock-off of John Winchester, which is, by the way, somehow worse than calling someone a clown or a son of a bitch, okay? Seeing you, tonight? Like this? This is fucking humiliating. I’d tell you that you should feel ashamed of yourself if I had any reason to believe you feel anything at all anymore.”
In the blanket of darkness that’s settled over the graveyard, Dean can still see clearly, because Cas’ eyes are high beams cutting through the fog of the night.
hygge (Danish): a quality of coziness and comfortable conviviality that engenders a feeling of contentment or well-being.
“No!” Dean huffs, feeling for a knife in his pocket or boot (but his counterpart was thorough), “Don’t give me that fuckin’ tone! You’re taking it. You can - you can exist with it. Right? It’s a part of you - you can get back to Heaven, or just stay with me, or - ’’
Clearing his throat, Dean shakes his head to cut through the static, and his mouth wants to make words happen, but it’s like a limb that’s fallen asleep.
As with all things Dean does, his heart is heavy in it, and the uncertainty that spiderwebs around the words when he goes to make them - it’s like stepping out on a sheet of ice blanketing a deep lake and hearing a low crack and echo, but being unable to see from where it originated.
“I’d heed me, if I were you. I may be a fuck-up in absolutely every other way, Dean, but as soon as Heaven lost the strategist that brought them their righteous man, they abandoned their post with their hands empty.”
“She’s a fully grown woman, Dean,” Castiel corrects him, eyebrows scrunched in confusion as he brings his glass to his lips, “Besides, I’d only be wasting her time. I cannot dance, and I’d not be amenable to having relations with her, so it’s better I -”
ya’aburnee (Arabic): literally “you bury me,” a term of endearment expressing the desire to die before a loved one, rather than live without them, because living without them is unthinkable.
“Your father was emotionally absent at all times, and physically absent a great deal. If the natural order among humans is that those with absent fathers follow particular career paths -”
“You know, Cas - I get the drugs, the drinking, the, uh - grief beard, you got goin’ on - but what is with the orgies? I am actually curious.”
Castiel slants his mouth at Sam, and Sam smiles gently back at him, “I know it doesn’t sound like fun, but, honestly? It’s a good skill to have, and worst case scenario is that you brighten someone’s evening.”
“I - thanks, man. Uhm. Now - this is gonna sound like a weird question, but bear with me, ‘cause I’m not about to assume consent or something.”
Dean Prime looks close to striking out at Cas, but then his expression twitches into something slightly different and substantially harder to read.
“Elsewhere. Largely South America. Listen, though, Sam - the last we spoke you posed a question to me -”
“This is a den of iniquity,” Castiel responds, voice stricken with his full-body fear, “I should not be here.”
Cas is seated on the bed of one of the trucks, seeming as gentle and harmless as any other time, just peeling and eating slices of a clementine.
Rolling his eyes as though he’s actually put out, Dean peels himself from the French window he’d been leaning on, and takes Sam’s place.
With that timer counting down from somewhere up above, Dean swallows around the jagged heat at the back of his throat, and inwardly tells himself to nut up.
“Cas, shut up!” future Dean snaps, drawing himself up tall so he can scowl down his nose at Cas, “Stop acting like you know the kid! Like you get why the whole fuckin’ world ended, and that it somehow lies with me letting him go! I’m not the fuck-up here.”
“A good man,” Castiel answers without hesitation, and before Dean can argue, or even look away just to shake the intensity of their exchange, Castiel moves closer to him again, and continues, “Everything you have ever done, the good and the bad, you have done for love. You raised your little brother for love. You fought for this whole world for the love of it, even when it seemed that the world wouldn’t love you back, even when it was cruel and unforgiving - for the love of a world in which you couldn't believe that good things happen, and could happen to
“Why is this difficult for you to believe?” Castiel wonders, “You are aware of how you appear. Is it so surprising that you are physically and metaphysically the most beautiful to my perceptions?”
As much as this makes him uncomfortable, Cas is Sam’s best friend too, and he doesn’t intend to leave the guy out in the cold on this one.
the Righteous Man, I saved him - despite Hell's best efforts, their most cunning commanders, their most vicious monsters, despite the blood spilled, despite how many and how much we lost, and as Dean and I neared the physical world's wavelengths again, so near the surface, I put back together his soul and his body, navigating the cities of grief in him, their crumbled temples, the soft breathing beasts cradled there that he had somehow kept alive through the evil he had been witness and victim to..."
Clambering out of the grave, Dean brushes the soil from his hands onto his dirtier jeans, and stomps more than walks up to Castiel.
Exposing Dean’s neck more, Castiel yanks on Dean’s hair, watches the bob of his Adam’s apple, and he keeps grinding against Dean as he curves himself downward to kiss the corner of Dean’s eye, then inhale deeply against his hair.
His blood is smeared on the edges of the dents he's made, and his knuckles have that particular type of pain throbbing through them that feels ice-cold, and typically means he's broken them.
“Someday,” Cas reasons calmly, “you will. Someday - today - it will make sense to you. You’ll want that. It will be okay.”
He keeps telling himself it's because Castiel might die and so he deserves to have the best sex that Dean can offer, but another part of him is only growing more and more determined to keep Castiel alive, because sex has never felt like this for Dean.
Dean finds that his throat has gone very tight around his rapid heart rate, when impulsively, and instinctively, he responds earnestly, "... you wanna be?"
Dean felt remorse for the Cas he saw who was high on opioids, so why couldn’t he gather that empathy for the Castiel he knew wound up high on potential, and power?
“That was lightning,” the elder Dean specifies, narrowing his eyes, gesticulating vaguely behind and around him, “You just said it. You said ‘lightning.’”
Each time he pulls back just to come back in and change the angle, or depth, Castiel expelling little puffs of hot breath so close they rebound off Dean's flushed skin, and then Castiel keeps chasing his lips like he’s desperate.
He knows that Sam has never seen him look the way he looks now, because he knows that he has never cried in his life like he just cried now.
Unsure if he's still a little drunk or actually hungover or possibly both at the same time, Dean may as well be asleep at the wheel, so he doesn't make for great company.
Dean invites himself into the lazy, wide part of Castiel's legs and kisses him soundly, silently agreeing, but also wondering where in the Hell Castiel draws the line on blasphemy.
The alternative has always meant that Castiel does cry, and when he does, he does it away from Dean, he does it in secrecy, like an injured animal hiding their splintered joint. The alternative meant that he felt deeply, all things, that when he felt fear, that he protected Dean from it. That when he felt rage, or gladness, or mourning, that he shielded Dean from it - or shielded himself from Dean.
He fears the keen loneliness, the specific brand of loneliness that floods him when Castiel leaves him, he fears he can’t take another cut, another burn, he can’t say goodbye again, he doesn’t want to, the pain is too immense - he's spent a lifetime in Hell, torturing and being tortured, and he's been hurt in all ways a human can be hurt, but nothing frightens him more than the prospect of never seeing Castiel again.
Staring down at the knife, Dean furrows his brow, and says slowly, "... you took my knife. And I was so fucked up about the whole thing... I didn't notice it was gone."
- needed you, biblically, I would press you into the mattress, and I would call you ‘lover,’” Cas’ voice is rough stone, setting loose chills across Dean’s shoulders and back, “I’d light all our candles, lick the sweat from your body, throw myself at your altar, and call you ‘lover,’ and it was my way of asking for permission to sing your praises all night, unspool you, and adore you. Profess it long into the witching hours, until you wept. Until you surrendered to me - completely.”
Dean chokes on a clumsy inhale that goes down the wrong pipe, or something, and he splutters for a few seconds.
As his fingers climb into Cas' hair, and Cas' nails scrape at him from under his shirt, he feels himself
Dean feels a rage-induced migraine starting up, “no, that's not what I mean and you know it. I wanna know what's going on.”
“I expect nothing of you, Dean,” Castiel promises, eyes downcast, maybe looking at the freckles smattering Dean’s clavicle, “That said, this is anything but commonplace or casual for me. I am of Heaven, Dean, but I am not an Angel of modern, Western myth. I am not sweet, I am not soft, and I do not love blindly.”
He gets a lot better at signing too, though every time Eileen corrects something he's signed, he just tells her he meant to say it that way, and he likes it that way, and it drives her up a wall.
"I love you," he huffs, breathless, kissing Castiel a million times over, "I love you, I love you - of course I fucking love you, Cas, I love you, I always loved you, I was just scared, and stupid, and I - you forgive me?"
If Castiel had cared to notice Dean’s body language behind him, he may have been able to tell how badly Dean wanted to smack him upside the head; Sam once told Dean that getting details about anything from him was like ‘pulling teeth with chopsticks.’
. I want nothing else, I want no one else, but I will not sleep in that bed. I won’t, you cannot ask me to. I don’t think I can imagine even coming back to this cabin after tonight. Don't ask me to stay - because, I will…”
They stare at each other for a few silent beats in which Castiel seems to release a massive, invisible weight from his shoulders, and Sam thinks that being loved by an Angel of the Lord sounds, while poetic, immensely dangerous, and then Dean's voice comes, tinny and crackling with static; "Sam. Keep him there."
It feels dangerous - kissing Cas, on purpose. Doing it in a way he’ll remember it, doing it with enough time to compute it.
“Take it,” Dean intercepts; his left hand is noticeably trembling against Castiel’s side, under his shirt, and while he says 'take it,' what he means is, 'take from me so I don't have to admit I
,” future Dean corrects Cas, trying to break the magnetism, “...and it’s gonna get everyone killed.”
,” Dean brushes off, though anyone with slightly more social awareness would be able to tell he’s nervous enough to be sick, “It’s a kiss, man. After everything we’ve been through, it’s - it’s the least I could do.”
But Eileen is there as an emotional support for Sam, and they fill the quiet air, flirting in the backseat, Sam signing to her while she repeatedly laughs at him for accidentally signing something lewd, offensive, or absurd.
“What? Dude,” Dean laughs, self-deprecating, starting the car, “First of all, I’m not self-aware at all, I feel like most of the time I’m barely aware of like - anything, okay? And who I am? That’s none of my business.”
He doesn’t know when Zachariah will come for him, he wants it to be soon enough that he won’t witness what becomes of Cas, but he fears he will.
Sniffing, Sam glances off, then nods, and answers, "yeah. I mean - no, obviously, but yeah. I didn't know missing him was gonna be like this, is all. I keep expecting him to turn up somehow, or for someone to just pop up, wanting to make a fucked up deal to get him back, but... it's like the whole world went quiet when he left, or something. Like the whole universe shut up."
Cas’ eyes slide shut again, sleepily, exhausted with the day, “... perhaps, someday - when you get home - maybe I will make the same happy mistake, of saying what I mean just how I mean it.”
Swallowing with some difficulty, Dean holds loosely onto the lapels of Cas’ trench coat, and he means to go in chaste, he really does, it’s just that he’s actually struggling to breathe a little, so his lips are just barely parted, and Cas - as far as Dean can tell, Cas takes that as a cue.
Cas tilts his head curiously, bemused again; “it is not your favorite pet name I gave you. Yours for me varied over the years, but I only use four for you, ‘sweetheart,’ being one of them.”
“And maybe try to not look like you’re heading off to the gallows, huh? You don’t wanna insult the woman before you’ve even opened your mouth.”
Rubbing his neck in what is a very new visible tic, Castiel shrugs, and doesn’t respond right away, leaving the floor far too open for mockery.
Three days later, she calls back, though, and Sam is at the dining table on his laptop, lightly picking at a fruit bowl next to Dean who is pretending that Sam doesn't already know he's drinking a screwdriver.
No one has ever been as warm to him as Castiel, and while it’s probably in Castiel’s Angelic nature to be warm, and to emit waves of empathy and plain goodness, Dean still doesn’t recall a time in his life when it felt like it does with Castiel.
Sam gives chase after Dean when he storms off to lock himself in the bathroom for a while, which means Eileen follows closely, and when he finds the bathroom already occupied, he panics about being cornered and forced to talk about feelings, which genuinely sounds like a fucking nightmare.
Castiel placed his faith in Dean, and Dean could’ve told him any old day that putting faith in him was one sure-fire way of getting disappointed real fast, but he knows Castiel wouldn’t have listened to that.
“Like - are you… wait,” Dean struggles, using a free hand to rub at his temple, “You’ve, uh - you’ve never been called ‘she,’ or ‘her,’ in front of me, but sometimes when Angels take different vessels, you call them by different, uh… lemme start over. Do Angels have genders?”
He hugs Cas close, and kisses him soundly - besides the kiss over all feeling decidedly masculine in an unfamiliar way (musk, stubble, untreated skin -), Cas’ lips are a little dry (no lipstick, no gloss, no perfume -), it makes for a nice pulling sensation, though, dragging him in closer (made for him, made for him, made for him -) - he breaks for air, and to switch the angle of his head, “I’m not givin’ up on you,” he manages.
Tugging Castiel’s underwear and pants down by the back of them, Dean brings his other hand to his mouth, and coats his palm with drool; when Castiel’s cock is revealed thick, hard, and wanting, Dean takes hold with no hesitation, and drags his fist down to the root.
Then the line switches, and what is plainly Claire's voice says, "now," "it's recording?" "oh my God, yes, Cas, it's recording, just say the -" "you've reached Castiel... Angel of the Lord -" "You can't put that in an answering machine message!" "What am I supposed to call myself then? What if the call is relevant to my being an Angel?" "If they're calling you, Cas, odds are they know who and what you are already!" "But, I -"
With a long-suffering sigh, Cas drops his shoulders, and turns back to Dean before saying, “I could use help with some of the cars. Are you feeling generous?”
She’s beautiful, no doubt, but next to Castiel, with all his otherworldly energy and luminescent eyes, all human beauty seems to wilt in comparison.
“Okay,” Sam responds; he doesn’t think his meditation app will be available at whatever altitude they are, doubts it would help Cas anyway, instructing him through a tapping exercise would be impossible with such limited ability to hear one another, and box-breathing may take too long to explain before Cas loses patience and ejects himself from his body or something, “do you know - uhm, war cries? Or something?”
And whatever he feels about Dean, camaraderie, or friendship, or familial bonds - whatever it is, the unobtrusive but near-tangible fondness he has for Dean - it’s powerful enough to destroy holy scripture, defy God-given orders, and somehow, it’s worth more than all of Heaven and all its Angels.
The hand he’s got on Castiel’s waist grips more tightly, and the one around the length of Castiel’s tie freezes in a white-knuckled clasp.
Scuffing his loafer on the carpet, he admits, "I did not need to make contact in the third dimension," he spares a glance at Sam, then looks away again, "It was not required of me - I had done what I was ordered to do, my mission was complete, and I could rest for a time before deploying again to battlefronts at the seals. What remained of my garrison was withdrawing from Hell as quickly and safely as possible, I had rescued the Righteous Man, and upon finding, and saving him, returned him to Earth, body and soul. There was not more for me to do. I could have left, but I was so eager to speak to him, I couldn’t wait."
Cas’ shoulders tense up, and his eyes go hard; he swallows a final slice of clementine, then sets it aside on the truck bed, half-peeled.
His future self seems to be waiting for something, but when the desired result does not come, he glowers more deeply, his brow furrowing and wrinkling with distaste.
Dean catches Castiel by the sleeve of his coat before he’s out of reach, and tells Castiel what he remembers his own father telling him once-upon-a-time.
“Are you saying we, uh, walk in, straight up the driveway, past all the demons and the Croates, and we shoot the Devil?” Cas counters.
"No, there's no body to view, or burn, or bury," and "I don't think he left anything for anyone," and "no, there's no affairs to put in order or anything," and "you were at the forefront of his mind when he -"
“Sam, when I first looked upon him, risen and free, I…” Castiel trails off, biting the inside of his lower lip, looking off to the right, then down and away; a little more quietly, he manages, “I… I had a passing, almost traitorous thought that... had Lucifer only a moment’s chance to look upon him there as I had, if he could see Dean Winchester as I beheld him there, a representative of mankind, so full of gratitude, fear, and love, courage and regret, and so startlingly beautiful in the white starlight of the Earth’s night, that he - that he would have crumbled to his knees, and repented.”
In his mind’s eye is every instance that Castiel smiled in front of him, caught off-guard with relief, or just too eager to please him that he couldn’t stop himself, or laughing at the wrong part of a joke; Castiel’s entire face would change when he smiled. A familiar stranger Dean only ever wanted to know better.
If he ever did, he must’ve been a young teenager for it, and the orgasm itself must've been pretty run-of-the-mill as far as intensity goes.
This is all wrong - he feels like a helpless child again, like his life is splintering apart and he’s powerless to stop it.
He doesn't know if Cas can hear him anymore, odds are he can't, odds are Cas isn't even a thing in existence anymore that can receive anything intangible or not, but - he polishes, and he shines, and he hums, and he prays.
He thinks to himself that he can lie. He can just - circumvent this conversation the way he has for roughly four years now, but he knows it won't work. Not really.
“It was all - it was fast! I wasn’t thinking, I hadn’t had time to think, and I - I chose you, I always choose you, Ben was all but forgotten in that moment, I’m ashamed, Dean, but I couldn’t - you were in danger - and you thought - you blamed me, and I understood, I understood why you were angry, but I - you thought it was revenge or -”
His breath stutters when Cas rolls his hips against him, and he pulls away only for the pleasure of looking into Cas' blown, hungry eyes with very, very clear intentions.
Driving the Impala after The Empty was an unprecedented torture; her accelleration had kept lagging like she was purposefully dragging her feet (‘I will not be moved from my post!’), her brakes kept making uncharacteristic groans of disapproval (‘what are you doing!? Where is he? He’s my friend too!’), and she even spat out his music last he drove her.
Swallowing roughly, feeling possibly feverish, Dean down, then away, “… you gotta stop saying shit like that, Cas.”
Dean tries to move his bloodless arms up to take hold of Castiel, to refuse to let him go, or just say
"I apologize if you felt responsibility for what happened to me. I don't need to be anymore part of your after-life than you want me to be."
happen," Dean recites, his face too warm, his body trembling, "And - sometimes - they happen to me."
There was a life before Castiel, where he got along just fine on his own, where friends were whoever was useful for as long as they were useful, where he trusted no one and nothing, where there were monsters in the world, but nothing equivalently good in the natural order - there was a life before Angels, before
He wishes, helpless, and limbless, that they had more time together - that he could offer any educated counter-idea to whatever it is Castiel has planned with trapping an Archangel, but he knows he's out of his depths when it comes to Angelic politics.
, Dean pleads, rubbing and suckling simultaneously on both nubs, humming agreeably when he feels Castiel’s cock throb hard in his dress pants,
It’s been a long, long time since he’s felt such a pressing, immediate race to bliss that he couldn’t manage to get his dick out of his pants for it. His brain is floating around his skull like it might float around in a jar of formaldehyde, but the formaldehyde in this case is just post-coital endorphins, and hungry lust still building - otherwise, he might be able to dig up a relevant memory.
Abruptly, both of them hear a door slam, and several more doors opening, as though to investigate the noise. The commotion is coming from the hallway at the back of the room; Dean puts his drink down and goes to make sure that everyone is safe.
Taking another swig of his beer, Dean sits on the corner of her bed, close enough to see her laptop screen but not so close that he's hovering over her computer chair, as she explains, "I got video, though. I put it on a little USB thing, so you can have it too."
cared,” Castiel tells him in wonderment, “Do you understand? I was not built for that, Dean. I was not built to care about anything beyond my orders, but I cared about
A Manananggal - she is hideous, and terrifying to look upon, and he only succeeds in killing her purely by accident.
Missing Castiel - it’s not just weirdly sentimental of Dean in the first place, but it’s - it’s not even an option. He hasn’t got the emotional bandwidth for something like that.
The near-festive gathering in the backyard falls entirely silent when Angels arrive, standing around the sigil, and facing Dean; they come bearing gifts, like their own feathers of other colors, Angel blades, silver daggers, and smooth stones they place down on the center of the sigil.
His left hand is still holding Castiel at the hip to keep Castiel seated on him - he lets that hand move down to where he can shakily finger at the wrinkled dress shirt and start untucking it.
His hand flexes in and out of a fist, "it is my miracle. It is for me, divinely gifted by faithless hands - mine. My miracle. And I would sooner rip the seams of space-time apart than ever be without it again. All can be taken, all - I will gladly give until there is nothing left of me, nothing more to offer, nothing left in all the universe but this, and I would not surrender it. Unmake me, lay what ribbons remain of me at the feet of cruelty, persecution, and savagery, but my miracle - it will remain. Steadfast, and unending."
“Yeah,” Dean encourages him, a ghost of a smile tugging on his mouth as he sees the Angel he knows back home, “There’ee is. I trust you, Cas. Implicitly. I’m serious. Tell me what you think happened.”
, they’re something that shouldn’t be, should never be, and when Dean’s heart hurts like this, he swings, and he swings blindly, but he’s old enough now - he’s lived long enough to know better, and still fail. He doesn’t want to fail Castiel right now. He can’t.
His collar is open by two buttons, his shirt sleeves are pushed up to his elbows, and his tie is barely hanging on its knot, and also facing the wrong way. His hair is a mess, the way it always was, and he's got on black dress socks, which, for whatever reason, endears Dean to him even more.
How is Dean going to pull another trigger when he remembers how longingly Cas looked at the screen at the end of
Staring down into the open grave the boys are in, Castiel glances between the brothers and tilts his head, wondering if perhaps by a different angle, he may better understand what their expressions mean.
Breathing is still difficult, enough that Dean’s chest is tight, but even so, he says against Castiel’s lips, “open your mouth,” in a gravelly whisper, and when Castiel obeys, he brings his right hand to the opposite side of Castiel’s neck, tilting him just-so, and licking broadly inside.
He pulls off Castiel, lips slick and swollen, jaw aching, throat hot and tight, and his voice is fucked out in a very unfamiliar way when he watches Castiel slide down into the grass and says, "lemme. Lemme, Cas. Please, God, yeah, lemme fuck you."
His sweaty palms cup to hide his face from the loathsome Nothing and No One of the room, he grips too hard on his fringe, pulling his hair, and then he weeps.
Several people shout, even more run out of their cabins with guns drawn, but Dean only notices them through his periphery.
!" Dean rushes, some popping-zipping energy running through him from scalp to sole, buzzing and cleansing, "God -
“I could do nothing. I could not find him in time, I could not get you to him in time, I could not predict where and when attacks would fall, people were dying all around us every day, and you needed me as I used to be, not as I was then - as I am now, either - and then Bobby - I couldn’t do anything to help Bobby either, and you kept - you kept telling me how I was leaving you alone in your suffering, how you felt you were without aid, or support - but I hadn’t meant to leave you in that. I was disoriented, I was lost - I couldn’t help as I once had, I was as an adult human learning again how to speak and walk, and you needed me to sing and run. I could barely crawl, Dean.”
He got used to not being alone anymore, even when he didn't have Sam, or casual girlfriends, or Bobby; he got used to never being truly alone, because Castiel was with him, watching over him, even when it hurt, even when he was called home, even when the creator of the known universe told Castiel to give it up, even when Dean was unnecessarily cruel, even when he made every argument he could that he was not someone who deserved forgiveness or saving - Castiel was there.
Finally, Castiel takes the money and turns to follow Chastity, to which Dean calls out, “go get ‘er, tiger!” - which is apparently not the vote of confidence Castiel wanted, because he throws a look over his shoulder to Dean that could kill a lesser man.
Leaning in a little further, Dean’s right arm slides over the back of the seat, and his shaky left hand brushes the front of Castiel’s coat, moving up until his hand is cupping the side of Castiel’s neck; his thumb brushes gently along the five o’clock shadow at the bolt of Castiel’s jaw.
Coming up short, Dean almost swallows his entire tongue with how immediately he wants to argue, but Cas steamrolls right over him; “but why is he?” Cas asks, indicating Dean to his future self with a hitchhiker’s thumb, “I mean, he's you from five years ago. If something happens to him, you might vanish from this time, right?”
Heart rate still on the incline, Dean hopes his expression conveys how lost and uncomfortable he is.
Sam's eyes are round, and shining, and Dean has to swallow a hot lump in his throat before shrugging and saying simply, "I'm spoken for. Okay?"
Expression relaxing into something more sympathetic, Cas looks him in the eye, and tells him, “I can’t promise you anything, Dean. I wish I could…”
"Dean, I do not intend to impose upon you, or your paradise as you pursue it. I only wish to return something to you."
Startled, Castiel gasps, but it dissolves into a sweet humming noise as his hands slide down to mirror Dean’s hands, about the neck.
“You ain’t cute, Cas. How the fuck did you do that? Do you have your powers back? Have you been hiding your -”
When Castiel doesn’t move, and just continues looking like a victim of Medusa, Dean bullies him good-naturedly, “don’t make me push you.”
He flashes those sapphires up at Dean, the tips of their noses pressed side-by-side, “I said it when I meant it the most. When it was not enough to know your name. I said it when we fought, when you hurt me, when I hurt you back - when I thought I’d die without your skin, beneath the blankets. When I was infatuated, spellbound by you. When I couldn’t justify being alive, but I wanted to be anyway - I wanted to be alive so I could adore you.”
- Dean, for you and I it is not a question of bringing you into me, or myself into you, but rather blending us together, outside the rigid fabric of time and the confines of terrestrial space.”
A potentially involuntary noise is struck from Cas’ throat, and then his arms are winding themselves around Dean’s neck, and Dean can feel the vibration of Cas’ moans against his jaw, he can taste a sweet citrus crossing onto his tongue from Cas’, he can hear how their clothes are rustling together, he’s trembling, he’s frightened to keep kissing Cas, but he’s more frightened of ever letting go.
Momentarily wounded, Dean stares at her retreating back, then looks back down the hall where her door is open, and Castiel is standing there, disheveled and nonplussed.
starts up, and he checks his left hand - he's pleased to find the ring still on him. He wonders to himself if Jack noticed.
To Dean’s horror, he watches tears slip down Cas’ cheeks in rapid succession, and stands stock-still as Cas breathes against his lips.
There's more drool in Dean's mouth than can be contained; his chin is wet, and Castiel's cock is sliding down easy now, just getting stiffer, and hotter, and slicker, and it's appealing to Dean in a way that hooks deep in his abdomen and keeps tugging him closer to coming in his jeans again.
There’s a beat of silence wherein Cas’ eyes change, and he’s come out of some sort of spell. His eyes don’t glow, the Earth doesn’t shake, but he seems to really, almost tangibly return to his own eyes.
“Be careful, please,” is said through the driver’s side window as Dean reluctantly buckles himself in, “You are the most precious cargo, Dean. You are my one and my only.”
Dean’s eyes flicker up, trying to gauge Castiel’s reaction, and he feels another shiver move across his shoulders at the intensity with which Castiel is staring at Dean’s lips, and his own fingers there.
,” Castiel hisses, head tilting back, the hickeys and bite marks Dean’s left all over his neck and clavicle looking carnal in the shadows, “pray to me, Dean.”
“Oh,” Sam utters, turning back around, surprised, but not displeased at all, “Yeah, anything, man. What’s up?”
Wiping away his smirk, Sam clears his throat, and suggests, “I mean… it could just be a crush, Cas. Considering your whole existence, how long you’ve been around, I mean - this being new to you, the emotions and stuff… maybe it’s just the shock of your first crush.”
“I had no reason to before. I had made a deal where my end of the bargain seemed so nebulous, I didn't even know if I would ever confirm the agreement."
Dean wonders, ridiculously thinking of a new color trenchcoat, a change of tie, or an espresso machine,
“It’s about pleasure, Cas,” Dean explains, gesturing as much as he can with his hands on the steering wheel, “You’re in a human vessel, and that comes with some perks. We like art, and shit, you know? Something looks real fuckin’ pretty, and it makes our monkey brains light up with cool chemicals that make us feel good. We play competitive sports and stuff, ‘cause winning at something does the same thing. Physical intimacy is… it’s good. It’s healing, and it’s, uh… it can provide.”
The realization that he cannot rescue this Castiel from his fast-approaching fate slams into Dean like an oncoming bus - or, more accurately, like the asphalt and Earth that meets him like a wall as it does.
Flicking his eyes back to Cas' face, he adds, "I actually didn't know this. I didn't - I really didn't know this. I didn't notice it was gone."
, falling short - saying that I am in love with Dean is an insult to the gravity of what I feel for him, yet these are the only words a human
The recording is cut there with a beep, indicating that it's recording the voicemail now, but Dean is blinded by grief at the sound of Cas' voice. He forgets what he wanted to scream into Cas' inbox.
again, and now he can't play Clue again, even though he doesn't even remember the last time he played it, and he's unlikely to ever have the desire to play it again, but he's
Three years after that, Dean gives Claire away at her wedding - it's a bright, sunny day, but before the ceremony even starts, she's sobbing and telling Dean how she'd always half-imagined Castiel walking her down the aisle.
He falls asleep on the ride back to her place, and no one bothers him for a good long while, where he's stretched out and sleeping across the front seat - and when someone does, it's just Sam, offering him a water bottle.
saudade (Polish): nostalgia or melancholic longing for something, or someone that one cares for and/or loves. Moreover, it often carries a repressed knowledge that the object of longing might never be had / had again.
"What? No," Dean laughs, grime thankfully covering most of his face; he feels Sam's stare boring holes in the side of his head, "Just got tired of fighting women off while I traveled. Easier to just start gesturing with my left hand, and they take the hint."
Unconsciously, Dean wets his lips, and replies roughly, “yeah. It’s, uh - look, though, I don’t… I don’t kiss guys -”
In a rare moment of familial levity between them, Sam laughs, and Dean smiles at him - all of that makes Cas smile too, and then Sam’s phone rings.
The rough pads of Castiel’s fingers ghost along Dean’s jaw, until both of his thumbs and forefingers are touching at where their lips are moving against each other; it’s a curious, exploratory touch, entirely innocent.
“I could explain to you the function and making of the crypts and collarettes in his irises, I handled their rebuilding myself, but in all of these years I cannot explain to you why they effect me," is what comes in reply, "I have known and understood the structure and function of beauty - or I thought I had - since an age you can scarcely conceive of, but I… when Dean is near, I…”
The whisper of a smile tugs at the corner of Dean's lips, and he juts his chin out toward the laptop, indicating that she should play it for him.
Castiel’s knees nearly give out, he gasps loudly and his hands fly to Dean’s hair as his back curls forward from the door as if he's been punched in the gut; there was cum still on him from making out in the front seat, and Dean’s not squeamish, but not interested in what cooling cum tastes like either, so he manages to haphazardly clean it off with his own spit and tight fist.
When Dean doesn’t answer for too long a period, Sam crosses his arms over his chest, and continues, “I can go in there, if you want. If there’s something you need, or something -”
Castiel is this fresh fallen snow, and Dean wants to claim it for himself, to have fun and freedom with it before anyone even knows it’s there to be played through, to have a memory of something he could touch that's between just him and the snow, and no one else.
“No, but it’s okay,” Cas reassures him, fingers scratching gently through his scalp in a way he recognizes as addictive in an instant, “The closest you ever got was saying that you needed me. And I knew what you meant. You and I, Dean…”
With difficulty, Castiel looks back into Dean’s eyes, and Dean feels his heart thud in his ears. He wonders to himself if Cas can hear it, or feel it, but all Cas does is stare intently back at him, maybe waiting for Dean to confirm or deny something.
He grabs a hand towel, turns around and leans the small of his back against the counter, keeping his head and eyes down as he dries his hands.
Remorseful and, socially, more at a loss than he's ever been, Sam considers Castiel's round, frightened eyes for a quarter beat, and then, as a hand turns the door knob, predictably, he's gone, and he and Dean are left blinking dumbly at each other.
Castiel’s thumb pushes Dean’s upper lip to reveal his canine in a semi-snarl, and that has all of Castiel’s attention when he continues, “if there was ever cause to love human flesh, it is because of how mine reacts to yours. If there was ever cause to love teeth, Dean, it is for the sake of sinking mine into you. The love of skin for how your blood makes it turn dark, and the love of breath for how scarce you make it seem… I do not need you to reciprocate sentiments I keep for mine to hold true.”
It's not said to patronize him, they only mean to distinguish Cas from all other possible sightings; "bitch had me by the throat, and I blink, and there's Dean's Angel! He put his hand on 'er head, and -
Jody and he ride in companionable silence, he stares out the window, bites the cuticle of his thumb until he's ripping the skin, wonders if Cas actually understood how romantic the songs are, and he thinks about what the fuck he'd put on his tape to Cas, and how fucking stupid, and obvious it was, and how much of an idiot he's been.
Cas gets lost in random trains of thought, until some half an hour later there’s commotion from the hallway. Soon Dean bursts into the living room, and his eyes immediately fall on the beer in Castiel's hand. He frowns.
By the time Cas and Dean arrive, a small party has already gathered. Random people loiter around the front porch and music blasts through the door as it swings open. Inside they find Crowley in his kitchen, busy dispensing moonshine from the stash in his walk-in storage. Straight away Dean starts rummaging through his fridge and cupboards for ingredients and clean dishes. A few minutes later they join the others in the cramped living room, carrying a pitcher of disgusting punch and mugs.
Not sure how to deal with himself while Dean peruses through his unfiltered notes, Cas lays down on the floor and studies the ceiling. The paint has cracks. So many cracks. He counts them to distract himself from Dean’s occasional humms of approval and remarks like “huh” or “interesting”. Finally Dean lowers the notebook and stares at him with a whole new kind of intensity.
“What? I’ll just write an essay to make up for it,” he says defiantly and slides even further down into the couch, until his head is practically leaning against Dean’s thigh. “ ‘s no big deal,” he mumbles and shrugs. Dean pats Cas' arm in sympathy and once again fails to retract his hand, letting it rest against the worn velvet instead.
Another aspect is how personal the new stories feel. Previously the stories have revolved around hunters and monsters, ranging from obscure lore and stories to more widely used tropes. The most he’s ever nodded in the direction of religion are demons and the concept of hell, without taking any stance on the existence of heaven. But he chose to include Biblical lore in the fourth draft, and even included a character modeled after himself, an angel who rebels against heaven for Dean’s character.
"Are you saying you're willing to pick up a volume on Enochian language or Bible history, Dean?" Cas suggests, smiling innocently. "Because I swear, that's the only thing that could make you sexier." Sam breaks down in laughter as Cas wiggles his eyebrow at Dean, who is blushing furiously.
Dean nods absently. “Sounds like. But this assisted learning thing, how come they spring that on you now?” he asks, looking as confused by this as Cas was.
Neither Cas nor Dean have ever directly addressed their sexualities, so technically they aren’t even out of the closet. Not to each other or, to Castiel’s knowledge, anyone else. It’s never been an issue, and frankly hasn’t even entered his mind as something he should actively address. The suggestion has always been there between them, that straight isn’t the box either of them would tick. It reads between the lines, in their staring game, and the occasional discussion where the subject matter veers into decidedly queer territory. But explicit wording? No, they steer clear of that as skillfully as they steered clear of intimacy, until very recently.
His parents are apparently some big city hot shots. They bought the house cheap and moved back to Seattle some time ago, leaving Crowley to live out his best life at Duke John’s. And Crowley seems a-okay with that. Smart as he is, the guy appears to manage school with minimum effort, and instead focuses on perfecting his moonshine recipe. From his dubious headquarters, he deals the stuff out to his friends, friends of friends, and basically anyone he decides is unlikely to rat him out to the police.
"I'm sorry, Dean," Cas mutters and frowns at the torn label of his beer. "I never meant to pull your family into my mess. It's why I came here."
“What? No! If this is how you see me, then fuck me, I’m awesome,” Dean grins as he extends an arm to help Cas sit up. “We might need to change the names if we publish something, but I’m fine working with the original stuff for now.”
Cas doesn’t have to be told twice, but it’s with some trepidation that he goes to dig through the notebooks that are piled high on his desk. He hasn’t mentioned his pet project to Dean before, and for a very good reason. The main characters are unabashedly based on the Winchesters, Dean and his brother Sam, and there’s just something intimidating about admitting to writing stories about them for months.
Amelia places her hands next to her plate. “We need you to stop acting up and focus on finishing your Senior year. You’re due to receive your acceptance letters soon, remember?”
Cas tries to hide his relief and attempts a genuine smile. “I get that. But I had fun”, he says, and as it feels like an inadequate thing to say, he quickly adds,  “A lot of fun.”
The Bunker is a combination of break room, library and even occasionally a cafe, whenever there’s a bake sale for whatever the association is trying to fund. Since Duke John’s is a drama and arts oriented institution, most of those sales tend to fund plays, concerts or exhibitions. Sometimes even the occasional sporting event makes the list, they are a high school after all, complete with jocks and sporting teams. Although they don’t reach the competitive level of other local schools.
Dean doesn’t necessarily need new material in any near future. While he is fond of making comprehensive page drafts for stories before any detailed drawing, and is very prolific in doing it, creating a single finished page takes a lot more time than that. Finishing inkwork on even the first storyline would be many months away. Still, Cas prefers working through the old stuff sooner rather than later. It’ll give him plenty of time for rewrites, and he wants to incorporate Dean as much as he can in the storytelling.
- When I was in high school, me and my friend / same sex crush at the time started a project together. It wasn't a comic, but it did include worldbuilding, writing and concept art as well. We finished the project that same year, in 2005. We produced sequels, altogether counting 5 by 2015. This project lead to my current career.
Dean sits up and cautiously lowers his glass down beside the bed. “Hey, it’s okay. You can figure this out. I’m sure you’ll find a compromise if you just talk to your folks,” he says cautiously and lifts his hands like he's approaching a wounded animal.
His eyes fall close and his jaw slacks from pleasure. In Cas’ mind moss green, lust blown eyes gaze at him, and it sets him off on an irreversible dive over the edge. He opens his eyes just in time to witness Meg arch her back like a cat as she clamps up around him.
“I don’t know what to tell you, mom. I don’t usually drink like that. I guess I just felt overwhelmed and the booze was there,” Cas shrugs.
It’s not even 7AM, but his parents are early risers. The aroma of coffee wafts through the air, treacherously inviting. Cas abandons his jacket and bag in the hallway and enters the kitchen carefully, anticipating an inquisition waiting for him inside.
“They’re afraid I’m being corrupted by bad influences,” Cas says dryly, huffs a breathy laugh and spins the scotch around in it’s glass. “To them what I do outside and at school are one and the same. They’re worried I’m failing my Senior year, but this is just punishment for everything else.
“I’m sitting right here, you know? You could, once in a while, ask me what really happened or how I feel about this,” Cas grits out, just managing a mask of calm despite being infuriated. “I get that I messed up, but don’t you think I deserve any support in this situation?”
“Aw, shit. Dean, we have to go,” Cas sighs with a pang of disappointment. He had all but forgotten this wasn’t what they were supposed to be doing for the rest of the night.
Some strips he recalls clearly, some he’s forgotten, and a few make his shoulder shake with the effort not to laugh aloud. The final comic is one of him and Dean, once again annoying their friends with some form of telepathic communication. It barely makes sense, and is certainly unintelligible to anyone but them.
Cas doesn’t look up, but smiles weakly. "I know," he answers, taking Dean's hand and lacing their fingers together.
“You realize how awesome this is, right?” Dean says and gestures between them. “I don’t think I could have this connection with anyone else, and I can’t imagine working on someone else’s stories.”
It eventually takes Castiel nearly four weeks to decide that he and Hannah aren’t going to work out. The final straw came last night, as they were laying in her bed after some perfectly adequate sex. For all that it was lacking, Cas had actually felt rather good about it afterwards. It was less of a fumble and he managed to get a little more into it. Perhaps that was what prompted Hannah to bluntly propose oral sex soon after.
“Thanks, Ash,” Cas mumbles and smiles as he moves towards their regular booth in the corner. Dean slides onto the bench next to him and pulls out his sketchbook. He sets it down on the table in front of them and rapps it’s cover with his fingertips.
, and not just for Cas and his clan. A lot of folks tend to come and go at their leisure, and Crowley really doesn’t give a flipping shite if they do. The Brit lives in an old neighborhood a little further down the Plough River, where old detached houses stand mixed together with rows of townhouses from various decades, perhaps even centuries. Crowley’s place is situated in a side alley, off the main roads, squeezed between two considerably less run down townhouses.
Sorry for all manner of typos and such. I've done my best with editing. Point out if something is a real eye sore.
Dean sighs. “Oh will you shut up." He covers Cas’ mouth with his palm and leans over to hover above him, and with complete sincerity tells him, “It’s fucking amazing, Cas. It’s awesome, and I’d be honored to be your artist."
didn't mess up for any other reason than my own stupidity,” Cas pokes a finger at his own chest. “If you paid attention for even a moment, you’d realize that I’ve been trying to be honest about myself for a long time! You just don’t want to see it or hear it!”
Recalling his last waking thoughts of the previous night, Cas braces himself. He will enter through the front door, not hide away in his room, and at the very least attempt to be brave. With a sigh Cas makes his way to the front door, turns his key and opens the lock with a click.
Returning to school after Friday’s events was a nightmare, and it made Cas infinitely grateful for Dean’s company in the evenings. They shared the bed every night, although things remained on a rather platonic stage. Just some hugging and sleeping in tangles. Perhaps that’s for the best, since Cas’ mind already felt like exploding from keeping on the edge all day, every day.
“They make it sound like I seduced you and forced you to cheat on Hannah,” Dean complains. “Not to mention we didn’t do anything like they said at the party.”
The whole Satanic Panic at his mother’s church was one thing. He can laugh at the belief that dressing in black and listening to heavier music puts him in cahoots with Lucifer. He can’t laugh at the notion that he’s fallen in with the wrong crowd, or that he’s becoming a depressed outcast because of who he chooses to be.
“Mr. Tran has good ideas. Maritime industry pollutes. Green solutions reduce pollution. If fish get killed the ecosystem will suffer. Suffering leads to fear. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to the Dark Side. Be like Jedi Master Tran so we don’t need to fear the Sith Fish.”
"That's good. Because I've discussed this with your counselor and a few of my colleagues,” Amelia discloses. “All agree that you ought to have a curriculum drafted for the rest of the year, which would include all the assignments you need to pass your courses, and a few to bump previous grades." She offers a smile that is perhaps meant to be supportive, but comes across as deeply condescending.
“Yeah! We can get started on it tomorrow, if you’re staying over,” Sam agrees with a million watt smile.
“We’ll join them. Of course,” Cas agrees in relief. If Dean and the others are coming too, he’ll be fine. He can wait until tomorrow to break up in a decent manner, and not ruin a perfectly good evening.
Bobby was a friend of Dean’s family and strictly speaking Cas didn’t know him all that well. But he had visited the old man’s eccentric junk yard slash epic library a few times, and found he couldn’t resist an opportunity to look up some stuff in those books. Bobby had been amused but gracious about it.
“Yeah, and they still treat us like they're raising good God fearing subjects,” says Cas and rolls his eyes exaggeratedly.
Back in bed, resting beneath the dusty covers, his mind swims with a mix of green, sad eyes, and the familiar stings of failure and guilt. Drowning in emptiness, weighed down with regret, Castiel clutches onto one single thought before drifting into sleep; in the morning he’ll start to mend things. Come tomorrow, he will start thinking with his brain again, and maybe, just maybe, he can begin to surface from the empty.
Castiel thinks. There is definitely a point somewhere there after which he can only recall strange flashes, but there is no telling if they happened early or late in the evening, or even what they are precisely. The flashes are more like weird sensory recollections than actual events, and the sequence of everything doesn’t even begin to form in his mind.
Today, as I post this, it's been exactly 16 years since we found out about the death of our "Anna Milton". I didn't know I'd post this exact chapter on this day, but it feels weirdly cathartic to do so. It was really painful but also quite beautiful to write some of this stuff. It's very personal, but also not. I think dealing with grief and depression is a universal theme, and I hope this terribly heavy and joyless chapter can make someone feel not alone with those experiences.
The shelf is filled to bursting with books, comics and collective figures. Low, very close to where Cas is facing it, are stacks of albums, sketchbooks and binders. Some Cas knows are filled with little snippets of text by him. Dean attaches illustrations to them and keeps them, little tokens of their bond.
At that, Cas had freaked out and bolted. He isn’t exactly sure why, the general idea has always held appeal to him, but he is willing to bet it was mainly the fact that it was Hannah. Afterwards he stayed up all night thinking and regretting, not answering Hannah’s texts, until he reached a decision in the early morning hours. He had to end it the very next day.
The upstairs guest room is a simple affair. It’s fitted with a queen size bed that is covered in dusty quilts. A small desk stands below the window, and next to it a tiny cupboard crowded with random booze and mismatched, displaced items.
From there, their touches morph gradually into a tacit language of innuendo, where each purposeful touch and avoidance heightens the delicious, anticipating tension between them. Wordlessly, they negotiate their wants and needs, searching for their boundaries and daring the other to leap across them.
The only upside Cas has found so far is that he keeps hiding behind notebooks, and as he is too anxious to focus on his classes, he’s made some incredible progress on the second script for Dean. Since he’s started going through material for the third one too, it means Cas is swiftly catching up with himself.
If the ending of this chapter bothers you, you might want the heads up that this turn of events will be addressed extensively in the next chapter. If the death of a young person isn't something you want to read about, you might want to skip parts and I'll make sure that is possible.
Dean lets his backpack fall on the bed and slides down on the floor in front of Cas, whose cheeks are heating up.
Now they had sex. Not the most intimate kind, but Cas isn’t stupid enought to beat around the bushes. They took one of the last bricks that usually separates a friendship from a relationship, threw it away casually, and once again fell into step as if this is how it's always been. As if nothing changed between them.
, is all he has time to think before the door opens and Meg saunters through. She closes the door behind her and leans against it, a devilish smile spreading on her heart shaped face and rouge lips.
Professor Missouri Moseley is, by a comfortable margin, Castiel’s favorite teacher throughout his entire school career. Certainly his natural talents and love for the English language mean he would likely enjoy these classes the most regardless of who teaches them. But Mrs. Moseley has managed to make English the only subject Cas still attends readily and with excitement.
It really had been something. Among other things it has made Castiel want to dress in a cape for church every week since, just to spite them for their ridiculousness. He shrugs his acquiescence, and they burst out laughing.
“Ugh,” Cas grimaces, “I remember the awful punch you mixed at Crowleys.” Suddenly he’s very aware of his morning breath, which even to him tastes like a family of rats had crawled in his mouth and died there. Dean m-hmm’s, waiting for Cas to continue. “I remember us walking over to Hester’s.”
“The Kelpie,” Dean answers and hops off the couch, grinning widely. “We can discuss the next script. Also, I’ve got something to show you.”
"You'll be attending a supported learning group after school for the rest of the semester,” James says and fixes him with a stern look. “Your mother already enrolled you, so no backing out, young man.”
Cas swallows down his frustrations and tries to smile reassuringly. “Don’t worry. I’ve got my priorities sorted,” he says gently, but can’t resist shooting Dean a defiant, meaningful look.
“Ha, you got me there,” Ash laughs and lights a joint-- another habit that goes kindly unmentioned. “Slept in the back last night and haven’t felt like going out since. Why would I?” He takes a long drag. “Got my living room, kitchen, TV and everything right here.”
“Dean, if Cas agreed to be your writer, I’d seriously reconsider enlisting him,” he deadpans and proceeds to dig out a form from his bag. “Just listen to what this regular Shakespeare wrote in his opposition to my work today.”
Cas cranes his head to peer at the monitor. "I just figured you run some sort of scheme and have most of the teachers indebted to you in one way or another.”
“The suspense is killing me, Dean, maybe even worse than this coffee,” Cas gags. “Stop teasing, please.”
Cas throws his backpack in the corner, picks up two dusty glasses and a fifth of some cheap scotch, and proceeds to pour each of them a generous drink. Dean accepts with some hesitation, while Cas sips on his and watches the amber liquid slosh in the glass. They stand close, less than an arm’s reach away from each other, like they’ve fallen into the habit of doing.
Dean seems to startle out of deep thoughts when Cas stirs. His green eyes are swimming with emotions, but this time their meaning is undecipherable to Castiel, and he draws his hand back, frowning into his pillow. The hazy, floating state from before has dissolved. He’s feeling much more lucid now, and his mind is already weighing down with the crushing clarity that came with it.
Dean sighs, takes a sip and sets his drink aside. He reaches out for Cas’ glass and places it down next to it before pulling him into a tight hug, one hand cupping his neck and the other resting on the small of his back.
The denim of Cas’ jeans is painfully constricting, and leans back on his knees to unbutton them with his unoccupied hand. In a show of flexibility, Meg pushes the jeans down with one foot, and Cas moves to kick them off entirely. She yanks her top over her head, all the while spearing herself on Cas’ fingers, now counting three.
“No but listen,” Charlie pipes up as she’s calmed her breath, “I think this really might be his greatest idea ever.”
“Castiel, it’s not just this- this drunken display you put on, though admittedly it is the last straw,” his father speaks up, and gestures vaguely with his dessert fork. “We’ve also received reports from your school. There’s been a significant drop in your grades, and especially your attendance.”
The edge is near, Cas feels it with each increasingly urgent moment. He’s chasing it already, senses a tightness coil up in his stomach and tug at his balls, and it only takes a slight shift to graze Dean’s cock in a long stroke, and he tumbles over.
And it’s not just school stuff either, it’s everything. At the end of junior year, when Cas started to allow himself more self expression through music, style and opinions, he was met not with acceptance, but a wall of prejudice, disappointment and disapproval.
Cas is breathing hard and his mind is spinning, still wrapped up in the high, but he can see Dean already close off, steeling against his reaction.
Cas feels cold, dead to the core. How could he do things like that? What had taken over him? “Dean, I’m so sorry. I’m so fucking sorry,” he whispers, unable to meet Dean’s eyes.
“Yes!” Sam shouts and quickly slaps his hand over his mouth. “Sorry. It’s just, I’m kinda into that stuff.”
Today Castiel is exceptionally grateful for their arrangement, as he barely has enough energy after the first period to show up at Missouri’s classroom at all.
"No," Cas says plainly. This isn’t a thing he will even consider. As good as the intentions may be, the actions are invasive and misguided, and trigger an immediate fight or flight reaction in Cas.
Twenty minutes is barely enough time for Cas to consider whether this is a complete mistake. He hasn’t reached a conclusion yet when the front door clicks and he hears voices downstairs.
His mind is filled with the heat of battle, monsters clawing at his protagonists, and angelic beings descending to the rescue. The battle is won and the protagonist recognizes the saviour. He captures the intensity in their exchange, the way their breaths catch and eyes lock, an unresolved undercurrent of heat sizzling in the air. Castiel can almost feel it as he writes, because, granted, he’s not unfamiliar with the experience.
“You look even more tired than usual,” Crowley notes as Cas slumps exhaustedly into his usual spot. “Work late on those assignments last night?”
He considers the exchanges they’ve had this week. Meg is fun, witty, sarcastic and shamelessly flirty and direct in her advances. It doesn’t so much surprise Cas - since apparently he’s already been a few knuckles deep inside her - as it intrigues him. This kind of candor is a new experience to him, and it’s exciting if also slightly confusing in his emotional state. But it is, definitely, a distraction. And that’s what Cas needs right now.
“You guys, don’t rush through these bad boys. Yours truly might’ve been a little generous with the syrup, if you know what I mean,” says Ash seriously and taps the side of his nose. Dean and Cas accept their drinks with thanks, and proceed to take unnecessarily large sips, which sends them into fits of choughs.
They move like that for a while, Meg rubbing Cas’ dick through way too many layers of clothing, until they are both panting heavily. Cas flips them over and pulls her skirt and stockings down in one rough motion. There’s no need to be coy here. Meg’s delighted giggle turns into a moan when Cas forces two fingers in her mouth, and she starts sucking with dedication, eliciting a low, appreciative growl from him.
“Sure, Cas,” Dean smiles, slides the book back in front of them and opens up the first page drafts, four of them fitted on one spread. “Let’s start at the beginning, the flashback to 22 years ago…”
Admittedly these days it has a lot to do with how much Mrs. Moseley cuts him slack. Cas easily keeps up with other students without any real effort at all, so it’s not like she’s watching him fall through. It’s rather like she’s figured out how Castiel ticks, and lets him follow the curriculum in whatever way he feels most comfortable with. If it means he zones out for an entire class and just focuses on his own writing, then so be it.
Now here is Dean, pressed against Castiel’s near naked body, hot and solid, and all at once it becomes both too much and not enough.
It’s late. Dean left a few hours ago and Cas shouldn’t be awake if he wanted to have any wits about him at school tomorrow, but sleep just doesn’t come to him.
Pretty sure he didn’t get the entire picture yet, Cas frowns. This is hardly anything unexpected. Dean is easily one of the most promising young artists of Duke John’s, and his forte is pop art, comics in particular, a craft he’s been perfecting for years.
It hurts Castiel to the core, when displaying something that is truly him results in it being called a phase that he should outgrow, that being like that made him less developed. That hurt never heals, instead it only festers. He continues to resolutely stay true to himself, “rebel” as his parents call it, and therefore finds that defiance has become his default setting. He can no longer tell apart if a demand is for his own good or not-- any and all pressure results in an immediate need to revolt.
"It sounds to me like he did a lot of good while he was here," Jody mentions, "By the stories of all those people that pulled up for the service, he sounds like a superhero."
He lets go of the tie and takes hold of Castiel’s left wrist where it’s moving away from him, bringing it to his wet lips so he can mouth at the sensitive skin there; he looks up at Castiel from under his eyelashes in a way he knows liquifies the knees of most women. He doesn't know how it might effect a man - or, an entity that's a man 'some of the time,' but he's not really being driven by reason anymore.
“Until you cannot tell the difference between knowing me and knowing euphoria, Dean,” Castiel continues in a breathy, demanding growl, “I want your prayer, and your body, and your pleasure, and your
“Cas!?” Sam shouts over the winds, which are harsh enough that he puts his forearm up to his face to keep it from hurting his squinting eyes, “What’s happening!?”
Seated on what is now recognizably Claire's bed, Kaia sits against the pillows at the headboard and Castiel has shed his coat, jacket, and shoes, and is situated with his legs pretzeled, and a lyre cushioned on his thigh.
Jolting, Castiel’s hands wrap around Dean’s head, holding him there, gasping, and Dean can hear Castiel’s heart pumping wildly away.
Outdated Ideology Regarding Virginity (Dean tries to rationalize why he wants to Do the Do w a Dude), Something Something Toxic Masculinity in Trying to Justify Tenderness and Appreciation for Beauty Something Something Virginity and Sexual Attraction Likened to Manifest Destiny, Light Nipple Play, Praying/Mind-sharing, Fingers In My Mouth Friday, Rutting, Clothed Grinding + Pining Is Actually Very Sexy Thank U, Impala Sex, Drunk on Endorphins, Dom!Cas Vibes, Cas Says The L-Word (but Dean is too drunk on lust to notice it yet), Castiel's Handprint, Dean Being Drunk On Lust Makes Him Kinda Dumb, Mentions of Anna, Cas Being Possessive, Dirty Talk and uhhhhh other stuff, I'm sure
The window passed, he thinks - for whatever sequence of events would have made that timeline a reality for him, he thinks that the opportunity has passed and gone, and that’s all there is to it. He dwells anyway. He dwells deeply, and often, but he keeps it to himself because there’s nothing to be done for it.
man on this accursed, beautiful Earth that can save it from waste and ruin, it is you. I believe that. And you know what?”
Third; he’s going to miss Castiel. He’s going to miss Castiel a lot, no matter how he tries to rationalize the feeling away.
Nodding uselessly, with his eyes transfixed on Castiel’s mouth, Dean tells him, “yeah - yeah, okay. Take off your coat, alright?”
Cas looks an inch away from just fully lying on the ground for all it seems worth putting up more of a fight.
Once Castiel appears suitably confounded again, Dean answers him, “and I’m not in sex work because I sell my body other ways. Namely, hunting.”
He glances down, away, and then back up from under his lashes, “... am not much better off. I am of little utility to anyone anymore, but that - I can give. I can be out of the way, without being dead yet. I disappear beneath responsibility, I have a mission and purpose again, I help them forget, I put balm on the wound of reality - for a while. It’s enough. It’s how I justify being alive.”
Straightening up again, Dean finds himself inexplicably angry - he'll never be able to play Clue again. Not unless he wants to shout, and cry, and throw the board off the table.
“Jesus fuck!” Sam curses, his arms crossed over his head where he still plucks a shard of glass from his hair.
Fed up with his obliviousness apparently, Cas rolls his eyes, stomps forward, grabs both sides of his face, and pulls him roughly into a kiss that is desperate, sad, loving, and at once full of passion, recognition and grief.
Hunters from all over the states show up, which catches Dean off-guard, but what's even more odd are the everyday civilians that come by to drop off flowers, and tinfoil topped foods.
Dean's breath catches when Castiel pushes his head back down, but he goes eagerly - emboldened, fierce - Castiel's rough hands and long, dexterous fingers are holding his face, cradling him almost with a tenderness in high contrast with the tension pulling his body taut.
“No!” Dean answers too quickly; he runs a hand down his face, and looks away again, “No, I mean… it’s not - it’s a lot, knowing that you think of me… like that. But it’s not something you need to apologize for or anything. Just sort of hard to believe, you know? You've seen a lotta shit, Cas, and you're
"Oh my God," Claire groans, moving to turn the camera off as Kaia laughs, and Castiel turns to her, looking betrayed, and mumbling, "you promised you wouldn't laugh."
"He was an Angel," Kaia explains with a shrug, "And he wasn't with you guys all the time. He was just out in the world, being... Angelic. We knew there had to be more people that would've wanted to do something for him."
Before he can even properly lean into the touch, Castiel moves his bloodied hand onto Dean's shoulder, gripping him tight.
"It's a lot, out there," Claire commiserates, looking as if she thinks Dean might be angry with her, "I didn't expect so many people to have met him. The Facebook page is insane, Dean - he was all over the world, like, all the time, preforming miracles and shit - everywhere, for like, everyone."
"Cas..." Sam tries, wearing an expression that Castiel cannot understand; whatever he gleans from Sam (if anything) doesn't slow him down any.
When it's done, he brings his left hand up to the side of his head, so he can turn his face and look at Castiel's sigil.
“You are not paid to hunt, though,” Castiel reminds him, “Your body is more donated than sold to the purpose of hunting.”
He wonders what happened to the handprint since 2009, but it doesn’t really occur to him to just ask about it. He’s too busy with trying to find the Grace he carries, extract it, and return it to its home.
The way Castiel is watching him makes his face flush with heat, his painfully hard cock twitches in his jeans nudging up against Castiel’s, which answers in kind.
He wants to let Cas know it's no trouble, but in less than an instant, he's gone, and Sam finds himself alone in the room; at the apparent emptiness of the room, he assumes Dean must still be out at the morgue, and his sudden field trip with Castiel will go unnoticed.
“Nah, of course not,” Dean reassures him, scratching absent-mindedly at his jaw, “I… it’s nice. Being - I dunno. Being someone’s... favorite.”
Castiel keeps looking at him, tilting his head, and trying to get a better look at his face, even more confused now, and that only serves to make Dean laugh harder.
Still hot and bothered, he blinks up at Castiel, and meeting eyes with him sends his thoughts scattering like bats across the night sky.
Castiel’s electric eyes refocus on him, startling him with their intensity just as they had the wedding guests that were strangers to Cas, “I do understand now. However, perhaps it’s the soldier in me, but I find I much prefer following than leading.”
His body is hypersensitive to the low pitch of Cas’ voice, and the human blood-warmth radiating off him.
Thinking of Dean’s own jealous, and possessive streaks, the notion that there would be someone just as aggressive about him is very funny to Sam. He wonders if Dean would cave at all, and let Cas be possessive over him, or if he’d fight it tooth and nail. Maybe Dean would have no idea what to do, being on the receiving end of devoted territoriality.
He didn't mean to think it so purposefully, but once it's out in the ether, Castiel seems to cling to it with laser-focus.
Shaking his head, Cas easily becomes more interested in butting their noses together again before answering, “no, Dean. That last one - it’s my favorite. It’s the first pet name I ever called you by. I didn’t realize what pet names were before I said it, I hadn’t realized it was something that might fluster you… you told me I was too straightforward, but I could tell you liked it.”
That's how the story begins; he's in love with Castiel, an Angel of the Lord who did not betray his home and family for Dean, but rather devoted himself so completely and wholly to Dean that it changed the very fabric of the universe, and he's going to kiss that man-shaped ethereal being within an inch of his life, forever and ever, amen.
"He asked for my forgiveness so many times," he mumbles, fresh tears building, "Even when he was right, even when I was the one being a huge asshole, he just - he hated when we were at odds, he hated when I was mad at him, and he was so willing to just bow first if it meant I'd be happy with him again. I've never trusted anyone like I trusted him."
saying is that it’s not been years since someone was as warm to him as Castiel is; and that’s because it hasn’t been years - it’s never happened before at all.
proud of him. If you see Claire again, tell her that she helped me to grow into something better, something less cruel, that I never really stopped repenting for all the wrong I did her, and that I hope that all of her dreams come to fruition. Dean, I loved the mixtape.”
“When I was very pleased with you - you would preen for me, Dean. Years ago, when you cared one way or another what I thought of you, you would come home covered in soot, gunpowder, dirt, oil, blood, but ambition and hope as I’d always known you had in you, and I would tell you how proud I was of you, ‘my darling man.’”
Dean can’t remember a time where he was so scared he couldn’t even speak, he can’t remember ever feeling this way - inky tendrils of The Empty wrap around Castiel, and there must be something he can do, something he’s forgetting in his idiotic panic.
Nostrils flaring minutely, Cas nods a few too many times, looking away, off to the side, his eyes glassy and pained.
"That's what made him happy. Like, real, genuine, megawatt smile, crying outta gladness type happy - loving me. Even if I didn't return the feelings. He said I was the only thing in all of creation he'd ever wanted, and I was the one thing he couldn't have. So, he loved me anyway, and it made him happy because he said I - he said I was a good man to love."
There’s a threatening heat behind Dean’s eyes, but he refuses to cry, he tells himself that he won’t, and he can’t, and he tells himself it’s because Castiel needs him to be level-headed right now, since obviously, Castiel has lost his inner balance.
Subdued, Claire wanders off to join Kaia around the growing bonfire, and Jody sidles up next to Dean, crossing her arms over her chest, and looking up at him, "you've been awfully quiet tonight. Heard tell you've been running scared from just about every well-wisher too. Wanna talk about it?"
How is he supposed to walk through a department store and not look at the trench coats all lined up on the wall?
, so different from what I’d known and seen of humans thus far, and, to my sight, shining with glory after forty years of seeing only destruction and torture, he was so peculiar - I wanted so immediately to properly meet him, for him to be aware of me as I was of him - I had known the Righteous Man for over forty years, but he had only known me for a flight faster than light, in a form he would not be capable of comprehending.”
Curling in on himself, the tears cascade, and all he can hear is every reprisal of “hello, Dean,” in that low rumble he will never have the chance to recognize again.
“I dunno,” he responds honestly, dropping his hand and looking at Sam plainly, “I really don’t, Sam. But I need to - I need to do this, to go in there. Are you - will you help me?”
As The Book of Love begins, the live orchestra swells from inside the hall, Dean bows just a little at the waist, with his right arm crossing his chest, but his head up, and he inquires politely, “Castiel, may I have this dance?”
“I can’t open - can’t open the door. I can’t open the door,” Dean struggles to answer, his right hand coming up to rub at his forehead and temple, easing away a mounting pain.
Cas laughs abruptly. " Do you really feel the need to apologize for that, after everything we’ve done?” he asks, amused.
The first alarm rings out, shrill and obnoxious. Cas stands there a while, mentally preparing himself for whatever awaits him inside. The plan is to avoid Hannah as much as possible, or stay civilly distant, until they can talk after school. Then Cas plans to take her to a nearby cafe and explain things calmly, although he hasn’t really figured out what to say.
