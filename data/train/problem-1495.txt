“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
John realized exactly how odd that phrase would have sounded to him a few months ago, but still he pressed on. “And at eleven-twenty-two, I received confirmation from a reliable source that Sherlock had been kidnapped.”
“You wouldn’t even walk away when that cabbie handed you a suicide pill. Why this time?”
Mycroft bristled a little at this, showing more emotion than John had ever seen from him. “You are insinuating that my watch has been useless. Do you have any idea how many times it has saved my brother’s life? Has saved yours?”
“Open up, Johnny-boy!” mouthed the consulting criminal. He moved his hand a bit, indicating the switch within. By the big red button on it, John figured it would detonate the bomb. Or possibly summon a genie, knowing Moriarty. Either way, opening the door seemed like the best option.
John was grateful that Lestrade had said something, as his own mind was rather occupied with other matters. Besides, disciplining Anderson felt rather awkward, like reprimanding someone else’s whining toddler.
Biopharmaceuticals Limited certainly lived up to its name. It produced the best drugs, for a price. Treatments of the corporations’ patrons had nearly double the success rates of those performed through city hospitals, a statistic touted on billboards throughout London. Of course, there were the dissenters; rival companies, homeopathic agencies, and human rights activists were always pinning signs up on one streetcorner or another, but the general public paid them little mind.
As soon as John had tied off the last stitch, he’d crashed. Falling loosely to his knees, the doctor had let the suture scissors clink to the floor and dumbly removed his gloves. The med student had gone to pieces again, trying to take his pulse, but he’d pushed her away, insisting on going in the ambulance with Sherlock. That had been over eighteen hours ago.
Sherlock pouted. “They don’t let me in during the day.”
At about two in the afternoon, another technician would arrive, wheeling in a cart. Sherlock would extend a bored arm and, a few vials of blood lighter, take it back. Since he wasn’t yet in the final three months of treatment, he wasn’t being given any shots yet. John knew from Mike Stamford, with whom he’d become friends, that things would get worse when the shots started. Molly was further along than Sherlock, and Mike was spending less and less time away from her room. The shy IP was only a few weeks away from removal surgery, and she was displaying all the symptoms of stomach flu. Mike assured John that she’d be fine, that it was a very common side effect of producing the neurological drugs Molly was assigned, but John was still worried. And even if Mike’s IP was only bothered physically by what she was going through, that would hardly be the case with Sherlock.
“Dr. Stamford! Molly! I’d like to introduce you to Dr. Watson, one of our prospective new recruits!”
“And last: How do you feel about the violin?”
John shrugged, taken a bit off guard, but he began. “When I got to you, you were already in the process of escaping on your own. Why?”
“Tell them ‘no,’ because this won’t end until the criminal responsible learns that he can’t force good people to stop doing things he doesn’t want them to do.”
Legs flailing like a baby colt on roller skates, he leapt down what remained of the last five steps and came to a kneeling stop inches from the dust- and splinter-covered form of his army doctor, which was pressed against the side of the once-stairwell.
John was always talking to him, trying to reassure him that everything would be alright. But so long as he felt his John's pulse beneath his fingers, all the rest was obvious.
“Alright, it would seem I’m convinced,” John said as he reentered Sherlock’s room.
“Give me a minute.” John stood up and went over to the desk, returning with his laptop. He opened it without turning it on, and placed his detective’s hands over the keys.
Sherlock was furrowing his eyebrows now, a sure sign that he was awake, so John walked over and powered up the ultrasound. He used the hulking thing to make sure there was nothing horribly wrong with his flatmate's healing process, even if it were unlikely that there would be any significant change in the appearance of his detective's abdominal cavity over mere twenty-four hour intervals. John wondered how aware Sherlock was, and knew that if he were currently capable of such an action, he would point out the foolishness of John wasting his time and effort in such a way, but the doctor couldn't help himself. It was hard enough limiting himself to only once a day.
“You see, the important part is that you’re alone. And that you’ve been kidnapped. And that no one knows where you are. But the real point of this exercise is for you to see what I’ve known all along: The people out there aren’t worth your time!”
Just then, Sherlock twitched and started to shiver. John’s eyes widened in excitement before he realized that the movement wasn’t voluntary; rather, it reminded John of his childhood dog having a nightmare.
Unpacking his things didn’t take John much longer than packing them had. The room was small, and all of the furniture aside from the hospital bed that dominated the room had almost definitely been donated after seeing multiple owners. There was a long, beaten-up-looking couch, a low coffee table, a lumpy armchair, a chest of drawers, a small bed and nightstand, and a desk. Or, at least, what John thought was a desk. It was rather difficult to tell, seeing as the thing was entirely covered with what looked like the contents of half the facility’s hazardous material disposal bins. Petri dishes, pipettes, beakers, a microscope, several bottles of household and industrial-grade cleaning product, and at least one Bunsen burner all stood haphazardly on book pedestals, surrounded by slides, pamphlets, more books, assorted papers (some pinned in place by a knife), and a human skull.
Sherlock kept his face impassive. So Moriarty knew that he had an affiliation with Mycroft. That wasn’t too dangerous, as he obviously didn’t know Mycroft’s exact identity, or that he was Sherlock’s brother. So, then, Mycroft was safe, just immobilized somehow. Probably in a manner having to do with his work, as that was all Moriarty seemed to know about him.
Today had been an alright day so far, but something seemed to be bothering Sherlock. He hadn’t made a sound for hours, but the detective’s facial expression showed a range from pondering concentration to abject misery. Finally, John had to ask.
The detective gave a little shrug, which John knew to mean that he would very much like to be clean, but didn’t want to ask. Didn’t want John to have to fill yet another need for him, didn’t want John to see him as weak in yet another way. The doctor was long used to such attitudes from patients, but it still hurt to see it in his Sherlock. John would do anything for his detective, and hardly resented an opportunity to show the affection he couldn’t always voice. And what better way to prove this to Sherlock than to go above and beyond the call?
Initially, the bait and switch goes well. John puts a very mind-palace-y Sherlock in a supply closet along with the vital memory stick full of data, and leaves him his gun despite knowing that there's no way Sherlock could fire it effectively (still dizzy, post-operative, etc). John just can't bring himself to leave him defenseless. Then, John goes ahead with the plan of reporting to his supervisor and pretending he has no idea where Sherlock went. However, everyone is suddenly making a much bigger deal about Sherlock's disappearance than John expected, and it's because the little specimen jar holding the bag of blood thinner John took from Sherlock's abdomen is missing, too. Yes, Sherlock managed to palm it while being mostly out of his mind. He probably would not have done so had he been in possession of more of his mind, but in his current mental state he felt he had a right to keep it. Maybe for an experiment.
“But he’s a menace! I refuse to work with him.”
The agent looked surprised. “You’re too modest, Dr. Watson! Biopharmaceuticals Limited is always looking for the best and brightest doctors, and your record shows that you are certainly in that category. Plus a war hero to boot! No, we are very interested.”
Then, the consulting detective continued. “But you have a question. You may as well ask it.”
“Yes, except for that, but no one expects an IP to be entirely sane. They’re used to us acting oddly, so no one was all that surprised when I started using their facilities. And after the first week, they didn’t even bother trying to keep me out. Very useful, all that.”
Dr. Watson was seated on the Underground with his solitary box of belongings, headed back from the tiny bedsit in which he’d been situated while awaiting his new assignment. Partially to pass the time and partially as an excuse to avoid eye contact with fellow passengers, he’d started reading the pamphlet Wilkes had given him before sending the doctor on this brief sabbatical. It was printed with the Biopharm Limited logo, and the overly-cheerful cover read, “Incubator Patients and You: What a New Doctor Needs to Know.”
“Moriarty? About what in particular?”
“He offered you money to spy on me.” Sherlock looked at John sharply. “Did you take it?”
“Don’t hide the gun in your sock drawer, it’s cliché,” drawled the detective, still without leaving the couch.
John wasn’t scared. In an emergency, he never felt anything but calm. It was an excellent quality for a doctor, a soldier, and anyone who had an emotional attachment to Sherlock Holmes. So when he looked down into his friend’s very person, John’s reactions were clinical. Which was a good thing because, if he’d made room for emotion, there wouldn't have been room for anything else.
He could end this right now.
“Phase One of how many?” asked Sherlock, judging the width of the hallway he could see through the open door of his cell.
This time, John had practically gasped. "So . . . you can hear me?"
John knew full well that he was grasping at straws, but he wasn’t about to stop. He took a breath, and called the ersatz rescue team to attention.
So, the detective was alone, and he was bored. He’d already figured out the dimensions of his cell (four meters by six), his placement in it (roughly central), and its components (entirely concrete, run through with a steel frame, and fluorescent light fixtures in the ceiling). His eyes were certainly accustomed to the lack of light by now (he’d been there for at least eight hours, and conscious for two of them), but he couldn’t see much if only for a lack of visual stimuli. Currently, the only objects that broke up his field of vision were his own knees and shoulders, although he could see a set of speakers behind him if he craned his neck back far enough. Sherlock was also aware of a small black box mounted above the door in front of him, and imagined it must be a security camera. Chances were that it wasn’t the only one in the room; he’d have made sure to install at least three if the tables were turned.
When John got back upstairs after setting Mrs. Hudson up with the CCTV footage, he found DI Lestrade already pouring over the film, a little notebook and pen in his lap, and Anthea still on the couch where he’d left her. John settled down next to her with Sherlock’s laptop. She was obviously aware of his proximity, and raised her eyebrows slightly, but John wasn’t interested in flirting. Instead, he asked her the question that had been bothering him since this whole affair started.
Sherlock took a steadying breath and twitched his left shoulder, pressing gently at the stitching of the straightjacket’s right sleeve with his other hand under the cloak of the former motion. His efforts were rewarded as the final line of stitching gave way, and the detective fought down the urge to start clawing at his bonds immediately. Instead, he allowed his torso to fall as far forward as it could over his knees, doing his best to appear exhausted as his ribs twinged painfully. So I’ve been here for a little over two days then, thought Sherlock as he assessed the sensation. It certainly seemed like longer, but that was always the case when one was going through substance withdrawal. But John probably felt like it had been more than two days, and he had no vices more extensive than tea. Well, tea and danger. And caring about people. That would be the one driving John up the wall right about now, the caring about people. The ex-army doctor could never relax when there was someone he felt he should be helping, and he’d definitely feel that way about Sherlock. Feel that way more than he would about most people, if Sherlock was honest with himself. Which he most certainly wouldn’t be. Thinking about John caring about him wouldn’t help John, only escaping would do that. So, back to escaping. With one last hope that John had at least considered shooting the wall to minimize the side effects of caring (he’d find it an effective emotional release, and Sherlock had already drawn the target and everything), the consulting detective snaked his arm down one leg and got to work. That was the only permanent way to make sure John was alright.
But John was still thunderstruck, and couldn’t hold back an exclamation. “Brilliant.”
This time, John was ready. “Yes.”
The consulting detective gave a mental start. Discrepancy. The human mind is designed to perceive changes in status quo, which meant that if Sherlock could keep moving, could keep the visible symptoms of low blood sugar at a constant, even his brilliant captor would begin to ignore them. Which might even be helpful, as false twitching could eventually be used to hide some of the more obvious motions of escaping a straightjacket. And he did have to escape it soon; the detective knew that his motor control was more likely to get worse than better, so his best chance at slipping the knots was now. Not that this was the time for all-out escape, no, not enough information for that yet. Still, escape was something better done sooner than later. Because Moriarty was wrong; John would never forget Sherlock. It just wasn’t in his nature. No, John would continue to torture himself for the rest of his life if Sherlock didn’t escape, and John didn’t deserve that. He wasn’t even a part of this game, and it wasn’t right that he suffer for it. But if his flatmate was never seen again, John would blame himself. Sherlock needed to get himself out of here, for John’s sake.
After Sherlock’s mood, things improved drastically. He wasn’t much better at walking for a sustained period of time, but was able to navigate the flat with short spurts of mobility. But most dramatically, the detective was in higher spirits than John had seen in weeks, maybe months. Propelling himself from chair to mantle to kitchen laboratory, solving case after case on his (or John’s) laptop, Sherlock had hardly ever seemed in more control of his faculties. Privately, John wondered if Sherlock’s black moods were his brain’s way of recalibrating. If that were true, it was certainly an effective, if heartbreaking method.
“In which case he’ll be left without any physician and we could lose the drugs for good. And the cost will be coming out of your salary.”
“Nnnnn.”
Then, there was the crackle of a speaker being turned off.
“Oh, sorry, forgot. Yes or no questions. So . . . are you bored?”
Seconds after the clip began, a figure walked into the frame. John recognized his flatmate instantly; the distinctive dark halo of curls and dramatic long coat all he needed to identify the world’s only consulting detective, although the large bag of human body parts did lend credence to the theory. Mrs. Hudson gave an admonishing click of the tongue, and started saying something about how Sherlock might just give knitting a try if he needed a hobby so badly, before John shushed her. His flatmate, his friend, was in danger. Good Tenant John couldn’t help him, so Soldier John was in charge.
Understanding immediately, John wrapped one arm further around his consulting detective, holding him, while taking his wrist in the other hand. Sherlock’s pulse was fast but slowing, and John was sure the same could be said for his own. He pressed his fingers against Sherlock’s pulsepoint, and felt the answering press against his own. “Amazing,” he repeated, breathing into Sherlock’s hair.
Mycroft cracked his patent-worthy half smile, indignation expertly smothered. “Ever the soldier, Dr. Watson. Looking for a more defensible position, I take it. Very well, where would you suggest?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"I know, it's frustrating as anything, but if you're going to do something that sets the heart monitor off, could you at least wait until morning? I know you know what time it is."
“R—Bathroom?”
John was concerned with Mycroft's lack of progress, but didn't resent taking care of Sherlock. He knew his detective, and how he resented hospitals. Once, when forced into an overnight stay after exposure to an unidentified acid, Sherlock had taken out his frustration by stealing every bottle of every controlled substance on half the hospital floor. No one on staff could figure out how he'd managed to un- and re-lock all seventeen storage boxes without use of a single key, never mind how he'd spirited the contents to the roof. John hadn't quite managed to keep from laughing even at the time, to the chagrin of the handful of administrators begging him to please take his pet madman home.
John pressed on. “And for what else? You can’t expect me to be of any help if you don’t tell me what the plan is.” The doctor went to scan the room for cameras before stopping himself.
“Well we didn’t want to hurt anyone, so we did what they said as safely as we could. They’d already knocked the guy out, but there wasn’t any gas so we had to use injections to keep him out. It took a lot, but Jason monitored that,” she indicated one of her compatriots, “and Dan and I did the cutting.” Her eyes grew wide over her mask as she realized how callous that had sounded, but a look from John kept her talking.
By this time, John had reached the other man’s side.
But would he though? This was an old building, one with solid construction, and Moriarty didn’t seem to be wearing half as many explosives as his victims from his first game with Sherlock. And the detective, up a level and towards the back of the flat with his experiment, should be fine in the case of a minor explosion. Mrs. Hudson was out, the street had been deserted and probably still was, would there ever be a better opportunity?
“Well, you’d know all about that, wouldn’t you?” asked John. The past few months of dealing with the criminal classes, and Sherlock’s brother (where was Mycroft?), had eradicated whatever fear response the doctor hadn’t lost in Afghanistan. Now, he was just angry.
He looked over one shoulder, from Lestrade to Anthea.
After Anderson finished his production of storming out in a huff, Lestrade turned to John. “Her help is worth it, right?” He indicated the vapid-looking young woman, who was still favoring ninety percent of her attention on the device beneath her thumbs.
The flatmate in question was already protesting, shaking his dark head. “I’m fine—don’t even know why it happens.”
“Of course.”
The doctor opened his mouth to respond, wrongfooted, when Sherlock cut him off again. “Never mind, not important. A doctor, with a strong moral principle, taste for adrenaline, and no aversions to following orders, has just fallen into my lap! It’s Christmas! The game is On, Dr. Watson!” The enigmatic patient was now pacing the room, practically manic with excitement.
“What?”
John held the back of Sherlock’s hand to his own forehead. Unprecedented. It was a good word to describe everything about the consulting detective, as well as everything about John’s own life since meeting him. Unprecedented to be the flatmate of someone so strange and amazing. Unprecedented to grow closer to him, in spite of it all, than you’d been to anyone else ever. Unprecedented for him to ask if you loved him, unprecedented to answer honestly, and most unprecedented of all for him to respond in the way he had. For him to look down so nervous and tell you that he knew he wasn’t good at this, but that it made him glad that you loved him, and that he didn’t respond like other people but that if he did, his response would be that he loved you back.
“It does help. Why?”
“We were as safe as we could, but one of them said to remove everything but the organs, and cauterize the shapes on all of those, and somebody kept chanting something I couldn’t understand except that I think it was Latin, and throwing all this salt over the surgical field!”
Anthea was the first one to speak. “Violent crime has skyrocketed in the last ten minutes, reaching nearly ninety times average levels for a comparable timespan this year. It would seem that an anonymous member of an online forum offered a substantial reward to anyone apprehending a police officer.”
“It’s the same plan used to divert my employer.” She was typing more rapidly again.
But difficulty didn’t seem to be something John would find himself short of any time soon. One day a soldier, next day accomplice to some sort of government-hired private detective. “Consulting Detective,” Sherlock had called himself.
An hour later, both inhabitants of 221B were sitting on the back of a parked ambulance, both inexplicably wearing orange shock blankets and watching the completely unnecessary number of secret service people with guns currently swarming around the abandoned building in which Sherlock had been held.
“Yes. How else could he keep tabs on everyone he’s watching?”
Interrupting John’s internal crisis, Sally cut in. “Sherlock Holmes? Stay away from him.”
It was a good sign, John thought, and he leaned over Sherlock, one hand splayed across his back, and whispered, “It’s late. Would you like to come to bed?”
But now, John. He wasn’t trying to speak to Sherlock, or to otherwise distract him or force him from his prison. But at the same time, the doctor wasn’t leaving him alone to face his demons. John, as always, had found a third option.
John shook his head, unsure of how to respond. He settled on, “If we’re going to be spending four months together, you might as well call me John.”
In a moment of inspiration, John shifted his grip on Sherlock’s hand and arranged it so that while John’s two fingers pressed into Sherlock’s wrist, Sherlock’s fingers pressed into the pulsepoint of John’s. Almost immediately, the detective settled back into a more peaceful facsimile of sleep.
“Did you say something, Sherlock?” John asked, emerging from the bathroom. He took in the sight before him with a sigh, which was better than panic at least. Without saying anything further, the doctor shrugged and lifted his detective fully onto the couch, exactly where he’d been before his little adventure. So much energy expended, and nothing at all to show for it. Sherlock rolled over to face the back of the couch. At least sulking wasn’t beyond his physical limits of the moment.
Now Moriarty’s lips were brushing Sherlock’s ear, and the hiss of madness was in his voice. “None of the useless wastes of life even thinking about Sherlock Holmes, whose mind could destroy them in an instant. No respect for what you are, what we are. You will see that they are useless, and you will join me as I take control.”
“Sherlock, what’s wrong?” John couldn’t tell if he was reacting to muscle strain, frustration, or even shame. One seemed as likely as the next.
Actually, John mentally amended, Sherlock would probably take the opportunity of having an ultrasound machine in the flat to try some new experiments on dead things.
A week had passed, and John’s life had fallen into a sort of pattern. With the drop in pain meds, Sherlock had become more aware if not more mobile. John no longer needed an EEG to determine if his detective was awake, he could see it in his face. Sherlock always seemed to be wearing some sort of facial expression while conscious, even if it was so faint that no one but John could have noticed.
“Except for breaking into laboratories?”
Anderson straightened, horrified. “That would be a waste of police resources! Legally, there isn’t even a missing person yet!”
“See?”  John said softly. “My pulse means that I’m here. And as long as I’m here, I’ve got you, and you’re safe, and everything is going to be fine.”
Obviously things aren't that simple. John has to operate on Sherlock without anesthesia, on paper because of Sherlock's drug history but really because anesthetics would corrupt the blood thinner drug Sherlock's body is being used to create. John calls them on this by bringing up his medical knowledge of how there are anesthetics that are not habit-forming, but no one will give him access to any and he is told that if he refuses to operate they will get someone else. Because Sherlock basically has a bag of super potent blood thinner inside him, and if it is damaged he will bleed out and die, John won't trust anyone else to operate. So, yeah. Sherlock is just tied down really extensively and his life depends on his ability not to move while being basically disemboweled and John's ability to not nick the bag. Remarkably, this ends well. Someone makes an offhand comment to John about how impressive it is that he didn't kill Sherlock by accident, as survival rates for carriers of that particular drug are about 20%. John refrains from stabbing them.
The other man shrugged, turning back to his violin. “Pity, we could have split the fee. Think it through next time, will you, Doctor?”
“Instead of going back up right away, I’m going to give you a bath. It’s been a while, and I don’t relish making a trip back up those stairs just now anyway.” He spoke directly into Sherlock’s ear, hair tickling his nose.
“H’lo?” asked the Detective Inspector blearily. It wasn’t much past ten pm, but he’d fallen into a habit of going to bed earlier between cases.
“Look, I know you know the man best, but are you sure you aren’t overreacting? I mean, we are talking about Sherlock Holmes here. He may be crazy, but it usually isn’t dangerous. Chances are, he just saw someone whose love life he couldn’t deduce from their fingernails and decided to follow them around to expand his knowledge base, or something.”  Lestrade was a bit disturbed with how easily he’d come up with that scenario, and by how plausible it seemed. It just seemed to prove that he was spending altogether too much time with the consulting detective.
“Mmmm.”
Just then, the gray strip of light under the door became blinding, and Sherlock was aware of footsteps coming down a concrete hallway. It was Moriarty of course—the man had a very distinctive walk, especially when as gleeful as he obviously was now—and the detective shut his eyes tight just in time for the door to swing open. It wouldn’t do to be blinded when the criminal came in.
Sherlock was turned to him with a somewhat accusatory air, clearly bothered by his absence, so John wordlessly handed the clean garments to his detective. After running his hands over the set for a few seconds, a light of recognition seemed to go on, and the consulting detective lay the pyjamas aside. John wouldn’t have been surprised if Sherlock could tell him their age, make, and even color from the quick textural perusal.
P.S. Sherlock's look to John was just telling him to utilize the distraction. He didn't even think of using blood thinner as a weapon. But he was super impressed, and tells John so. John is a little smug.
When neither of the junior detectives seemed prepared to take his word for it, and even Lestrade continued to look skeptical, John continued. “Sherlock Holmes is always here. Always. Sometimes he gets bored and starts mixing mad concoctions, or firing bullets through the walls,” he directed an apologetic look at Mrs. Hudson, “but he’s always here. And I have it on the authority of a member of the British Government that something has gone wrong. That proof enough for you?”
John looked around, a bit disconcerted to know that a good number of the black-suited figures surrounding them had probably been following him on CCTV footage at some point or another. No wonder Anthea hadn’t had to give anyone directions to Baker Street when she’d called that mysterious number on her speed dial. Actually, come to think of it, she hadn’t had to tell anyone anything. She’d just pressed a button, and the cast of every action movie John had ever watched had appeared on their doorstep. Suddenly, John wondered where Anthea had gotten to. Everything had sort of sped up after Rescue Force One had shown up, and Mycroft’s PA, as well as Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson, had sort of been swept out of the way. The latter two had descended on them the minute John led Sherlock out of the building, the officer shouting and the landlady sobbing and both somewhat hysterical. But Anthea was nowhere to be seen. John decided to ask Lestrade about it as soon as he and Mrs. Hudson were done writing up their official statements (on which Lestrade himself had insisted, although John was quite sure this matter would never reach official channels beyond Mycroft’s personal army).
Closely followed by the music. Sherlock wasn't completely bored by music, which was an infinite improvement over the relative silence of the first two lucid days, although he did much prefer the local news. John was surely aware of this, so the only explanation for the switching back and forth was that the doctor was trying to instill in his flatmate a sense of time of day. If it were merely to break up the monotony, the time between the switching of stations wouldn't be so consistent from one day to the next.
As Mycroft left, John turned back to Sherlock. His Sherlock. Moriarty wouldn’t be taking him away without a fight.
“Of course not,” the criminal snapped. “That would be entirely unnecessary.” Then, Moriarty’s voice became low and conspiratorial. “Pets are known for their loyalty, after all. And besides,” he continued, “there’s always the offchance that someone might figure out something helpful from one of my messages. A very small chance, in the case of your colleagues, but a larger one with regards to whatever member of government you have in your pocket.” Moriarty’s manner peaked again, his voice filled with unholy glee. “You didn’t know I knew? Oh don’t be silly, detective. I know you’ve had help. But you won’t be getting any now. I’ve made sure of it.”
“Thank you,” John called as he jogged back down the hall to the elevator bank. He jammed the down button with his thumb, anxiety making his stomach crawl. But as the doctor stood there, he saw a sign by the lift door. It read: For The Safety of our Incubator Patients, Basement Lifts Do Not Operate from 8pm to 6am. With a groan, John located the door onto a nearby stairwell and ran down into the facility’s lowest level.
He tried the men’s bathroom, the women’s bathroom, Umbrella Man’s closet, and even the staff lounge to no avail. John was considering the relative immorality of checking the other IPs’ rooms while the occupants were still asleep when he ran into Sally Donovan. Zeroing in on the familiar face, he approached her.
The doctor rolled his eyes. Usually he’d have better manners, but the man in front of him had just given him two thirds of a heart attack, and was now acting like nothing much was happening. So, John reasoned, sarcasm was not only allowed, but called for. He responded, “Hmm, let me think? The man in the middle of a dangerous medical procedure and a dangerous government mission goes missing without a word in the middle of the night, and I assumed he might be in some sort of trouble. Yep, I was totally overreacting.”
Dr. Watson shook his head as he accepted back his phone, and was about to respond to Dr. Wilkes’ frantic glances towards the door when the man with the violin cut in again.
John sighed. He wasn't sure if Sherlock could hear him, but at least the heart monitor had calmed down. He removed the ultrasound wand from its notch and ran it back and forth through the stretch of clear jelly, eyes focused on the black-and-white screen. As he'd expected, the grainy image didn't show anything different from what it had shown yesterday. No suspicious masses, no unidentifiable bodies, just organs reasonably close to where they should be.
“We didn’t want to!” she wailed. “We didn’t know what we were doing! Dan’s friend just brought us the organs for his group, said they were animal parts, and we just cauterized the shapes he wanted! Today was the first time any of us knew they were human, and they had guns, and—”
“To analyze how different strengths of acid interact with various organs.”
His madman was home now, at least.
“Yes?”
So Moriarty had obviously seen Sherlock cringe. Even if he were in the room, there was no way his eyes were that good (Sherlock had been awake several minutes, and his eyes still hadn’t been able to pick out more than a line of less-dark blackness roughly two meters in front of him, doubtless the strip under the door to this room). Moriarty must have a camera trained on him, then, and one with night-vision capabilities. Good to know, don’t delete.
Sherlock opened his eyes and waited for the painfully bright blur to resolve itself into shapes. It seemed that Moriarty had put on a more serious, less flamboyant persona for this particular visit, and this one exuded not glee, but power. The detective was reminded strongly of Mycroft.
Next, Sherlock tried to remember how he’d gotten into this situation. The last clear memory he had was of waiting for a taxi on the way back from the mortuary. None of them were stopping; taxi drivers seemed to have an extreme bias against passengers holding clear plastic garbage bags full of frozen human feet. He had just decided to walk home when one cab started to pull over. The problem was that it didn’t slow down as it reached him, and the next thing he was aware of was losing consciousness flat on his back on the pavement with the wind knocked out of him, surrounded by ice and feet. The pain in his ribs would certainly bear out the story that he’d been hit by a cab. Vaguely, he wondered what the feet had come to.
“Sherlock?”
Which was why Sherlock was currently shredding the seams of the straightjacket’s offending fabric. He almost laughed to himself—wasn’t it just a few hours ago that he’d compared himself to a spider, and here he was pulling the anchors from a polyester web?
John knew that this was about the highest praise the self-proclaimed sociopath could give, and felt something in himself glow accordingly.
“Well yes, except that this someone is almost definitely Moriarty, and that this is an attempt to run you ragged as well.” She nodded her head towards John’s pager. “Expect to be called in to deal with emergencies presently.”
But now, this.
Getting Sherlock to the bathroom wasn’t easy; even if the detective wasn’t heavy, he was still long. But eventually they made it to the flat’s full bath, and with only minimal bumps and bruises to both doctor and patient.
“He was wrong, you know.”
“You won’t,” responded the remainder of the room’s inhabitants in unison.
Eventually Sherlock is in too bad shape to continue running John off his feet, as he's pretty much delirious. This is the first time he ever really opens up about how he didn't know he was lonely until now that he isn't. John is touched. John does not really need to open up in return, as Sherlock does it for him by deducing all of his pains and their reasons while he's too out of it to know any better (even less of a filter than usual). Sherlock pretends not to remember the conversation. John knows he's pretending, but doesn't call him on it.
At that, John exploded. “Sherlock, I thought you were dead! Sorry I didn’t take the time to conduct a proper investigation. And what do you mean, tiny little brain?”
Just then, Lestrade caught up, closely flanked by his team. John indicated the cowering medical students (Sherlock had deduced days ago that it was medical students being used to perform the ersatz surgeries), and Lestrade took over covering them with his own gun while Sergeant Donovan handcuffed the three. She and Lestrade were speaking, but John couldn’t hear them. Emergency first, background noise later.
“She clearly didn’t send all of them, John,” called the detective from the kitchen.  “Molly sent six, and Mycroft added the other two himself. He even left a note, wants me to take a look. Do his work for him, more like.”  And at that, the consulting detective promptly lost himself in his experiment.
“The completely insufficient deadbolt is practically an invitation in itself.”
Sherlock gave a secretive half-smile. “For one.”
At that the doctor nodded, making way for the soldier once more.
“Okay . . . are you hungry?”
“Have you spoken to John about it?”  Sherlock was careful to keep his voice level.
John pressed. “So he’s . . . not really—”
“You do know breaking into laboratories isn’t exactly conducive to keeping a low profile?” asked John conversationally as they reentered their room.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “If you haven’t figured it out, why should I tell you?”
“And they let you in at night?”
Dr. Watson had seen a lot in his career, but never anything like this. Not only had those children cut in to Sherlock, needlessly hurt his Sherlock, they had done so in a manner that was both cruel and criminally unsafe.
“And don’t worry about the signal affecting the machines, Doctor, the walls around the surgical areas are all lead-lined.”
John sighed internally. He’d gone into war zones countless times, but never accompanied by an elderly landlady. Well, beggars can’t be choosers. And who knows? Mrs. Hudson was married to a murderer for most of her adult life, and she’s the one who brought Sherlock in to stop him. So she’s certainly not frightened of hostile situations, no matter how she might act.
John internally conceded the point and returned to his earlier statement, looking for a way to amend it. Finally, he spoke to the side of Sherlock’s neck that he could see at the moment.
Now the doctor was intrigued. “Not for drugs?”
“Alright, bathroom then. Suppose I should have guessed that, you’ve been eating after all, and catheters are for urine, which is only cellular waste. But you knew that.”
John turned to Sherlock.
“Shhhh . . . don’t worry. Everything is going to be fine. I’ve got you. It’s John, and I’ve got you. I promise.”
The detective saw stars for a moment, but after he could see past the haze of pain being punched in broken ribs produced, he realized that he was now lying flat on his back, as the thug’s blow had knocked him clear over the back of the chair to which he was theoretically still bound hand and foot. That explained why the bit of hired muscle in question was now looking at Sherlock as if he were some sort of ghost. Or rather, as if Sherlock had simply confirmed his suspicions that he was, in fact, some sort of ghost. At any rate, it was a particularly handy supposition, as it sent the larger man practically running from the room.
The doctor was overcome by a sudden wave of disgust and only just managed to stumble from the room. The agent, alarmed, followed.
“No,” said John. “I can’t. I won’t hurt people like her, even if they don’t think they mind. I’m a doctor, and I made an oath to do no harm.”
More often than not the expression in question could be termed “annoyed.” Occasionally it moved into “slightly panicked,” but when that happened John would speak to him, would hold him, and things would be alright again. “Shhh,” he said, softly. “I know. But everything is going to be fine, I promise. I’ve got you.” Then, he would put Sherlock’s fingers over his pulse, and the detective would calm down.
For the first time in their interaction, Wilkes looked vaguely uncomfortable. “Well, most of them are subcontracted. Though almost all of them are thrilled to work here, the pay is better than overseas. And we do good work, our drugs help to save—”
John turned back to Sherlock and gathered him off the floor. Despite the previous moment’s levity, the detective still seemed largely closed off. It was nearly imperceptible, but the doctor had a lot of practice identifying his detective’s emotions. And when he saw this little sign of shame, he couldn’t help but hold a little tighter.
John’s hands were right there immediately, one cradling the back of the detective’s head while the other cleaned his face with what felt like a dishtowel. Then, Sherlock felt a warm presence all up his side, as John joined him against the mountain of pillows. John was speaking, saying something about how he couldn’t even imagine how frustrating it must be, but Sherlock was too tired to focus. So instead, the detective twitched his head sideways against the John’s, and the doctor responded by taking his wrist. The room was silent with the exception of the voices coming through the radio, and within minutes both living occupants were asleep, resting against each other in the pillow nest.
John was rather proud of himself for finding a way to vocalize that so quickly, but Sherlock pressed on.
“Five days, John. Hardly a week.”  His usual nonchalant nature was belied by the hypoglycemic shakes wracking the pale man’s figure. John wished he had thought to bring along some orange juice.
Lestrade wasn’t overly concerned by the news. He took a breath.
“Nothing, really.” Anthea’s eyes were back on her BlackBerry as she made her way to the couch and perched neatly on a cushion. “But I have been given instructions to provide your investigation with the resources at my employer’s disposal. Provided they leave, of course.” She flicked her eyes up again, indicating Donovan and Anderson.
John couldn’t help but laugh, but was more than a bit intrigued himself. “Triplets? So, if any of them did it, you can’t rely on DNA to know which one.”
“And the stolen badge?”
Dr. Watson reached the fourth door on the left, only just remembering Sherlock’s advice to knock before entering. The reason became apparent, as he only just managed to catch the nurse Anderson extricating himself from the arms of a tall, attractive doctor. John schooled his expression to pleasant neutrality, and asked, “Dr. Donovan?”
“Good evening, Dr. Watson,” said a smooth, cultured voice. “There is a supply closet on your right. Enter it, and close the door behind you. I would make some sort of threat, but I’m sure your position is quite clear to you.”
Sherlock was on the floor, torso in the kitchen but legs insistent on remaining in the living room. He’d been trying to reach his microscope (just because it was unlikely he had the fine motor control to manipulate the dials didn’t mean he couldn’t try). However, there had been a catch at the edge of the rug, and, unable to steady himself, the detective had come tumbling down.
Sherlock was finding it difficult to follow the madman’s reasoning, which, he imagined, shouldn’t come as a surprise. It was always more difficult to predict the trajectory of a bullet from a damaged gun than one from a gun in good shape. Not that an incomplete understanding of Moriarty’s thought process was much of a concern at the moment; the consulting criminal’s need to gloat over his accomplishments insured that he’d make his meaning plain before very much longer.
John Watson. Ever the gentleman. Although Saint was more like it, really. True, Lestrade didn’t have quite as strong a dislike for Holmes as most people seemed to, but Dr. Watson actually had to live with the man. If there was a heaven, Lestrade couldn’t think of a better way to qualify for admission.
John was scrubbing the worst of the dust off his face, and said through his sleeve, “Moriarty. But he’s almost cert’ly dead now—“ added the doctor as Sherlock unconsciously grabbed his shoulder, scanning the debris as if the madman were about to leap out and strike.
John folded the laptop and stood up. “Call the local hospitals,” he instructed Mrs. Hudson as he looked about for his coat.
“Second,” Sherlock cut in. “You enlisted in the military, which speaks to a willingness to break social codes of conduct in attaining an end. If the end were important enough to you, would you do so here?”
Anyway, at about noon, the caneless Dr. Watson would return to his and Sherlock’s room. The detective would almost certainly be awake by then, either typing madly on John’s laptop, playing away on his violin, or poking at some experiment he’d set up with bits and pieces absconded from the morgue. It would then be John’s job to force Sherlock to eat something, usually by means of refusing to let the subject drop until the other man moodily agreed to at least some mediocre toast or breakfast cereal. Getting Sherlock to take his meds went down the same way.
They spent several minutes like this, John waiting for any indication that Sherlock had, well, completed. But after five, and then ten minutes, nothing had happened. John’s knees had started to hurt by this point, so he half-straightened, looking behind Sherlock to check the toilet bowl. Still nothing, but as he went to kneel back down, he realized that his detective was shaking. Sherlock’s face was pinched, and there were even tear tracks down his cheeks.
“Well I do, and this helps.” With a determined air, John put his arms around his friend’s shoulders and squeezed gently.
“Of course,” Sherlock responded, carelessly grabbing John’s laptop and flopping down on the couch. “But keeping a low profile is the most sure way to be caught. The best place to hide is in plain sight.” The detective seemed to be using John’s laptop to make notes on the spleen, and John decided not to comment on the appropriation of his computer for the time being.
He knew that there was little to nothing he could do at that point. It was nearing eleven at night, and John didn’t have his flatmate’s ability to predict what any given person would be doing at every hour of the day. And Lestrade hadn’t seemed worried, so it was unlikely John could get Scotland Yard out looking for the consulting detective, even if that didn’t seem a bit extreme at this point even to John.
Sherlock recoiled slightly at that last statement, a physical reaction Moriarty picked up in an instant. He swooped around the back of Sherlock’s chair, hands digging into the detective’s shoulders and face just centimeters from his right ear.
Some time later, and John couldn’t have said if it was minutes or hours, he felt Sherlock stiffen, and heard a few soft little splashes. The doctor gave it a minute, before asking, “Done?”  John felt the dig of a chin nodding into his back.
Moriarty laughed. “Why of course! They couldn’t live, after touching what was mine. So, I arranged some rather nasty accidents. Even for the medical students. Yes, they were forced to do what they did at gunpoint, but they still should have known better. So, I burned them alive,” sang the consulting criminal. Then he grinned again. “That’s what I really came to tell you two. That those mean people were all dead. Consider it a gift.”
The criminal pouted once more. “But I haven’t even seen Sherly yet! I’ll tell you what—send him down, and I’ll leave once our chat is done. Or, you can wait for the police to get here, and I’ll blow them all up when they do!”  Moriarty indicated his vest. “Your choice, Johnny!” he called as the doctor slammed the door in his face.
“It’s all fine,” John heard himself whisper as he felt thin, wet fingers tentatively spider their way over and around his back, completing their circle. “It’s all going to be just fine.” And for the first time, John himself actually believed it.
The criminal had come twice in two days, and it was the third day now (as an entirely uncomfortable jab to his ribs showed him), so it was not unreasonable to assume the madman would be back today. So all there was to do now was wait. Sherlock entertained himself by assessing what he’d say to John when he got back.
John did a mental double-take. “I met the man an hour ago. How do you even—”
“Phase One is looking for you, Phase Two is giving up, and Phase Three is forgetting that you’d ever existed.”
“You see, “ Moriarty went on, and Sherlock allowed himself a grim smile. “You seem to be under the impression that you’re important to the outside world. That the people there need you, Even, “ his voice became simpering, “That they care about you.”
John grinned, feeling pinpricks behind his eyes as well as he leaned over and gathered his detective close in a damp hug.
The first thing John noticed was that far too many internal organs were visible. The inside of a healthy human body is a net of membranes and fats within which the vital organs are safely nestled. But in this case, such protection had been cut away, sloppily patched to prevent the worst of the bleeding. And there was bleeding. This was to be expected with any abdominal surgery, but that was hardly a comfort. The too-visible internal organs, intestines and the like, looked like aluminium cans that had been kicked once too many, and John noted at least four large burn marks. Only the steady beeping of the heart monitor kept him from shooting the perpetrators then and there.
“Of course not!”
John certainly wanted to know as much as he could. Since he was apparently part of a scheme that would involve another human’s life in his hands, he wanted to be sure he went into it with as much information as possible. Even still, the doctor skimmed the sections on employee benefits and the code of conduct, skipping straight to the parts pertaining to medical treatment.
John didn’t like it that Sherlock loved solving violent crimes. Seemed to be under the impression that Sherlock enjoyed the fact that violent crimes took place. Which perhaps he did, because otherwise everything would be so incredibly boring, but that didn’t mean that, if no one else were a violent criminal, he’d take up the job. Not any more than John would start stabbing people for a lack of patients at the surgery. It simply wasn’t the point. Sherlock had tried to explain this to John, once at least, but the good doctor had just made an indeterminate sound in the back of his throat. Which was still closer to understanding than most people ever got, so the detective supposed that counted for something. At least John hadn’t moved out of the apartment yet, so all must be well as of now. Or, as of the last time Sherlock was at the apartment and could factually verify that John hadn’t moved out. Which had been roughly two and a half hours before the cab-and-frozen-foot incident. How long ago had that been, Sherlock wondered? Well not more than twenty-four hours—he didn’t feel the overwhelming need to add another nicotine patch quite yet. Sherlock twisted his arm slightly in the straightjacket’s sleeve—yes, there was still the one patch from before on the inside of his right arm—he felt it brushing against the fabric of the restraint. So he could have a full day before withdrawal symptoms set in. Or another hour, all depending on how long he’d been here. Sherlock was too impatient to wait that long for an answer, so he twisted his torso around sharply, waiting to gauge the response from his ribs. It came, of course, making Sherlock wince a little, but he’d learned what he’d wanted to know. Judging from the extent to which his muscles had already stiffened around the afflicted area, it had been at least six hours since the taxi had hit him. Sherlock had noted that most people seemed to judge time by how hungry and/or tired they were, but this method never worked for him, as a case-related adrenaline rush could keep him going awake and unfed for days.
Sherlock twisted around to look at him balefully. “Friend.”  Then, he flopped back down.
John looked around the hastily-cleared dining room table. Detective Inspector Lestrade, now seated on his right, had come over straight away. John had been slightly disappointed to see that Lestrade had brought Sergeant Sally Donovan and Forensic Investigator Anderson, two of his extremely frustrating subordinates who certainly had no love for Sherlock, along with him. John had been about to say something when the Detective Inspector explained his reasoning.
The door was opened, of course, and Moriarty came in. His walk had changed, as it was wont to do, and so, when he spoke, had his manner.
Sherlock smiled to himself. He had no idea what Moriarty was referring to, but it was obvious the madman had become desperate, and desperation was easily exploited. All the better for John.
John took a breath. He could hardly even start to point out all of his problems with this plan. After a moment, though, he settled on the most obvious.
Wilkes looked excited. “Of course, but Biopharm Limited has three different subterranean levels as well as its aboveground stories.” He continued to detail the engineering brilliance that had allowed for this as the agent and the doctor sank underground in the polished metal box.
“Exactly,” continued Sherlock, on a roll. “And they’re not just making drugs, either; there’s no way one could make those kinds of profit with only the facilities on their tax record. No, this place is a front for something, and considering that the father dabbled in multiple borderline-legal fields of scientific inquiry, it stands to reason that it would be something along those lines.”
“May I borrow your phone?” asked the man within as he put down his violin bow with a flourish. “Anderson took my last one.”
“Alright, then. I’ll just get you cleaned up.” John tipped Sherlock further against himself as he reached for the toilet paper. As he gently cleaned off his love, John noticed that Sherlock had turned further in on himself again. His head was twisted as far from John as it would go, and the detective seemed to be trying to curl up into a ball. If he’d been on a couch, he would have been facing the back of it.
With one arm around his detective’s waist, John walked them both to bed. He hated that there was nothing much he could do to help when Sherlock’s moods took him, but the face pressed against the top of his head as they walked, and the heartbreaking smile when he settled them both under the covers, told the doctor that the little he’d done just might have been enough.
“And that’s all we know?”  asked Detective Inspector Lestrade. “It isn’t much to go on.”
The entryway was now more of a cavern, sealed behind a dam of rubble that had been their front door and surrounding supporting wall, but Sherlock had no time for that.
The doctor couldn’t help but grin at the familiarly childish tone. “Not yet, Sherlock. We don’t know if it’s safe out there. Besides, you were practically in a coma less than a week ago, you can stand another few days in the flat. Don’t you have any more cases you can take care of from here?”
John caught sight of a shock of dark hair just as he pushed open the double-doors to the morgue. “What are you doing down here?” he shouted, still high on adrenaline from his run down the stairs.
If John had thought Baker Street had been a war room before, it was a regular army base now. After only a few hours’ sleep, Mrs. Hudson was again on her computer downstairs, video files on the screen and city maps beside her as she cross-referenced CCTV footage. At least half of the cameras had blacked out seconds after Sherlock was loaded into the hijacked ambulance, but the remaining footage was good for confirming where Sherlock wasn’t. Detective Inspector Lestrade had settled himself at 221B’s kitchen table, listening in on a police scanner and calling in personal favors with his cell phone. After a lifetime on the force, there were a lot of favors to call in. Anthea was still on the couch, typing furiously and silently. One could almost think she was utterly uninvolved with their endeavor, except for the e-mails full of extremely pertinent information that kept appearing on John’s laptop. John, for his part, had taken up the table’s entire surface, covering it with notes, images, and anything else he could think of that pertained to Moriarty as he tried to turn their points of data into a cohesive narrative.
Fine, then. No need for that particular family chat after my escape. Mycroft had a tendency to use such situations to attempt to guilt Sherlock into doing things, like taking boring cases for the government or attending family dinners.
This was new. Throughout his life, the consulting detective had spent far too many stays in his box of poison, and had endured countless attempts by people with various levels of good intent to break him out of it. Mummy had tried to hug him free, Father had tried shouting, schoolmates had tried everything from tickling to fists to make him stop staring into space and speak. Mycroft had even had him arrested once, but nothing helped. Eventually, everyone had accepted that nothing worked, and had individually come to the conclusion that there was nothing for it but to ignore Sherlock, to leave him alone to ride it out.
It made sense that Moriarty would enjoy using such paraphernalia on others; he’d doubtless seen the inside of a mental hospital at least once. Probably during childhood, before he had the experience to keep himself away from such places.
“Very surprising. Why don’t you explain exactly how you figured out where Moriarty was keeping me?”
Sherlock knew it wasn’t wise, but he couldn’t help himself at the moment. He strained his neck as far as he could from Moriarty’s face, then smashed his head hard into the other man’s nose. Moriarty sputtered, blood gushing.
Sherlock was waiting, eyes closed. The cuffs at his ankles were both undone, and the straightjacket sleeves only appeared restrictive. The detective was certain he could detach the jacket’s straps from behind the chair in seconds, so the only real barrier between himself and the hallway beyond was the (doubtless, locked) door in front of him. So, Sherlock was waiting for Moriarty to make another of his visits.
“It’s nothing.” Sherlock’s confusion was edged with a bit of panic. “Happens, sometimes. Stops eventually.”
So, that's that. Or at least, I think it is. I just figured that I knew how it ended and I thought someone else might want to know, too.
John looked his friend square in the eye. “You know that was a week ago.”
Eventually, John had unpacked everything but the gun. He looked at it for a few minutes, debating whether to leave it in the now-empty box and stash the whole thing under the bed, which would allow him to avoid showing the thing to Sherlock, or to put it away somewhere among his other belongings and mitigate the chances of it being found inadvertently by hospital cleaning staff.
Security wasn’t much of an issue where John was concerned, except that he always, always kept the curtains closed and his gun on hand. Mycroft was doing his best, but that wasn’t always enough, after all. And John didn’t have to hurt their odds any.
“Sherlock hasn’t come home,” he said. And then, in response to the silence on the other end of the line, “Which is weird for him.”
Just then, Anderson gave a little shriek as the petri dish he’d been snooping around burst into flame.
“Okay, I’ll just stop talking then.”
All the other deductions he’d made about the room and his manner of restraint in it were correct, of course, but it never hurt to check one’s work. Curious, he glanced down at the handcuffs about his ankles. The second cuff of each set was attached to a leg of the metal folding chair on which he was seated, but they were fixed not only around the leg, but also about the metal bar that fixed one leg to the other. So tipping the chair wouldn’t guarantee escape. Mental note: adjust preliminary escape plans for new information.
John looked over at Anthea, who was sleeping like a perfectly normal stick-person with her head on a cushion, looking so different from how Sherlock did when he took over that particular couch. The detective could sleep in any position, whether sprawled like an emaciated starfish or curled up on one side with his face in the pillows like a little child, but he never looked ordinary.
Except, John admitted to himself, that he was. Sherlock was a genius, but he had little to no sense of self-preservation and if John didn’t keep the detective from getting himself killed, no one else would. Ergo, John worried about him.
Everyone stared for a second. Even Anderson stopped snooping to look puzzled.
For the first time in the exchange, Sherlock seemed genuinely surprised. “Alright, then . . . John.”
Sherlock met his captor’s gaze with a look of ire. Of course John hadn’t given up; he never would. And this particular mind game of withholding food, obviously intended to make Sherlock long for John to stop trying, was utterly pointless. For one, John would never stop trying. And second, how Sherlock felt about the matter had no bearing on anything, as he had no way of communicating his opinions to John. No matter how much he might wish, at this moment, that Dr. John Watson had never even met him, because if John had never met him then John wouldn’t be feeling as guilty as he doubtless was. The knowledge that there was another human being who cared whether Sherlock lived or died was pleasant to have, more pleasant than Sherlock would readily admit, but it still wasn’t worth it. Wasn’t worth causing that person, causing John, pain. But there was no opportunity to explain this to John now, even if the doctor would listen. Which he wouldn’t, because not caring wasn’t in his nature, so there was no point in the whole hypothetical endeavor in the first place. There were also more useful things to be thinking about.
“I had to, Sherlock, they were growing fuzz. But Molly sent some in a care package last week.”
Making a decision, John changed the trajectory of his backward movement. He could see the shadows of Moriarty’s feet from under the door, keeping them in his line of sight as he tracked back as far as he could down the hallway. Once he’d gotten to Mrs. Hudson’s door, he stopped, and aimed.
“Mycroft always has this many people at this disposal?” John asked, gesturing to the swarming figures. Anything to keep Sherlock from thinking about the juice.
“So, tonight is the last time I can be sure to be in possession of all of my faculties. Thus, it has become imperative that I share with you my findings, as I may be unable to adequately do so in the future. Trust me, I’m no more pleased with these circumstances than you are.”
“Alright, it’s about time someone actually explained to me what’s going on.”
Just then, the detective heard the sound of heavy, running feet and the gap under the door burned. He only just had time to close his eyes before the door was thrown wide and one of Moriarty’s thugs was screaming incoherently into his face. Sherlock pulled out a few phrases, like “how dare you” and “no one’s that smart,” but the huge man’s raving was cut short when, with a scream of rage, he drove one massive fist into Sherlock’s side.
“Unimportant, Doctor. What I’m interested in is your association with one Sherlock Holmes.”
It was already dark by the time John got home. He’d been out at the surgery all day, followed by a trip to the grocery store and a stop at an ATM before finally returning home to 221B Baker Street. He’d known immediately that Sherlock wasn’t home, but that was hardly unusual. John knew that his flatmate wasn’t off solving a case, because Sherlock would have texted him about that—probably. Unless he’d left his phone at home, or forgotten to charge it, or had forgotten that he hadn’t texted, or had simply been unable to take the time to do so. But still, Sherlock usually managed to text, if only to have someone there to say “Brilliant” when he finally deduced whatever undoubtedly brilliant solution would solve the matter at hand. No, it was more likely Sherlock was off at the mortuary again, collecting body parts like some modern-age Dr. Frankenstein for his somewhat disturbing experiments.
John wasn’t quite sure that statement was accurate, as he’d personally been looking forward to being let in on his IP’s mission. But he remained silent on the point, choosing instead to wait for whatever Sherlock chose to share with him.
“Undeniably. Possibly in no more than consulting capacity, but security protocols must be taken. Surely you understand the gravity of the situation, and it was necessary you be informed. But know that the matter is well in hand.”
John took a second to catch his breath before panting, “I was . . . looking for you . . . Woke up, you were gone.”
John looked over at the bed. Sherlock seemed to be asleep at the moment, and the flat was silent with the exceptions of the beeping heart monitor and the chattering radio. Most of the machines had been returned to-- well, wherever Mycroft had gotten them from. John had kept the heart monitor, and the ultrasound machine was dark and silent in a corner, but the rest of the more advanced equipment had gone. John had even put a nail in the wall to take the place of an IV stand after he'd nearly tripped over the spindly thing once too often. Now, the room was much easier to move about in.
“I know you can’t type yet. But if you could just, I don’t know, tap the right key? I might be able to get some idea of what you’re trying to say.”
Then, he leaned down and kissed the brow of his consulting detective. And perhaps it was John’s imagination, but he was sure that Sherlock’s fingers pressed down just a bit harder.
“Of course, you won’t need to go down there. Doctors stay in Basement 2 with their IPs, Incubator Patients. And here we are now!”
“The area was obviously secure, but you were holding your head back a bit, listening for sound behind you. Ergo, there were others present and you felt responsible for them.” The detective stopped again, apparently recognized from John’s expression that this was enough explanation, and so continued to elaborate on his previous deduction.
“Yes, you average about twelve words per minute. Half the speed of the average prepubescent, but that has little bearing on our current investigation.”
“That,” said Sherlock, with the devil’s smile, “Is what we’re here to find out.”
“How do you know who I am?”
It was cruel, and John ached for his flatmate. But Lestrade, sensing the turn John’s thoughts had taken, dissuaded him from taking his illegal Browning to the streets.
The heart monitor, and common sense. His Sherlock needed a doctor, a real doctor, and now. John could help best by being this doctor.
“And you will be administering all medical treatment yourself?” Mycroft said, once again with that condescending smile.
“It’ll be in a baggie concealed in tomorrow’s milk.”
Which explained why John wouldn’t let himself sleep, either. Sherlock needed him. Wherever his mad flatmate was, John was his only real hope of getting home again. Of course there was always the chance Sherlock would escape, but John didn’t think it would pan out. The detective was certainly clever enough to get out of any scrape, but he was too stubborn to try. If his friend’s near-suicide with the cabbie didn’t point that out, nothing did. No, Sherlock would stubbornly try to work his way through whatever hell he found himself in, with no thought of self-preservation. Which is why, if his flatmate were to survive the ordeal, it would have to be due to John’s interference.
John—Sherlock in trouble.
“Wait,” asked the doctor, “Aren’t we on the ground floor?”
“You escaped . . . for me?”  It wasn’t a question so much as a statement, but John still felt the need to express it aloud.
But John had eat, and check the shipments of medical equipment, and get telephone updates from Mycroft, and therefore couldn’t be speaking in Sherlock's ear twenty-four/seven. So on the third day after the reduction in pain medication, John asked the elder Holmes if radio could be included in that day's shipment of IV bags. He soon found a few stations that seemed promising—local news for the daytime and classical music for the night—and John knew that he was better off for it, and was certain Sherlock was, too.
Anthea looked up then, catching John’s stare and holding it. “Whoever has your friend has found a way to keep Mycroft from finding him. But my employer has a high opinion of your abilities, so he sent me to assist you here.” Anthea looked as close to upset as John had ever seen her. It couldn’t have been easy for Mycroft to give up her help, or for her to leave him to sort out whatever international affairs on his own. And now, everyone was relying on John to see that the sacrifice was worth it.
“From you?” asked the consulting criminal, as Sherlock noted the sensitivity of the microphones. “Nothing! I want absolutely nothing from you, Sherlock Holmes. All you have to do is sit there, and the rest will just fall into place!” Sherlock could practically hear Moriarty grinning.
Not that it could in any way be compared with Afghanistan. No, thought John. The people at play here are certainly more dangerous.
John looked up, suspicious and angry. “Your doctors—are they all like me? Subcontracted against their will?”
Sherlock twitched his head back toward the doctor, to which John responded, “Yes, I’ll tell you, but no real names. And you can’t go deducing the names either.” John lifted Sherlock off the seat and settled him against the side of the bathtub, before continuing, “Or, at least when you do, don’t go trying to contact them for verification or anything.”
“Does anything hurt?”
When Moriarty made his move, it was Lestrade who noticed it first. Or rather Lestrade’s police scanner, which veritably went insane. John wouldn’t have been surprised if the sheer quantity of angry and panicked voices coming through the machine caused the little black box to vibrate off the table. It sounded like every car in London was calling for support at once.
John stammered, “Y-yes, I am. But how—?”
I was worried about writing/posting this chapter, because months ago (when I was already considering this story) I read something similar and saw that it had been absolutely shredded by mean people making snarky comments. So please, do not hurt meee!
With that, John opened the closet door and stalked out, cane clacking on the hallway floor. But he didn’t entirely miss the slow smile that spread across Umbrella Man’s face, right before the ultrasound machine’s screen flickered back to black.
“John!” called Sherlock. Well, it wasn’t a very loud call, but being able to speak was infinitely better than the alternative. As was being able to see, and to walk, although the latter was what had gotten the detective into this predicament.
Sherlock gave a rueful half-smile. “I usually don’t end up speaking to the same people twice.”
John dropped his head into his hands. The idea that someone could do this, could hurt so many people because of a vendetta against one, left the doctor numb. But what hurt is that it just might work. John had sworn an oath to save lives, and when the hospital called him, as they surely would, could he bring himself to turn them down?
Seeming to read John’s mind (for the umpteenth time in the last fifteen minutes), Sherlock said, “And if you want to be sure I’m telling the truth, speak to Dr. Sally Donovan. She was the initial government plant. You’ll find her in the staff lounge at this time of day, but knock. Anderson’ll be in there, too, and no one wants to see that. Fourth door on the left, just past the bathroom.” With that, he turned back to the violin and continued to play, seemingly unaware that John was still in the room.
John ignored her entirely. Although the footage had no sound, the doctor could almost hear the strain of human ribs, the crack of head against pavement. In spite of himself, he half stood up, all instinct telling him to go, to help the man on the computer screen. Lestrade saw the movement and put a hand on John’s shoulder. “Watch,” he said, not unkindly.
John pressed the mug to his detective’s lower lip and slowly started to tip the liquid into his mouth. The first swallow went fine, as did the second, but by the third the detective was tiring. Unable to keep up, he felt a few drops of the warm liquid track their way down his chin. Sherlock let his head tip backward and made a sound he hoped passed for an angry, frustrated moan. Even to his own ears, he sounded weak.
“No?” The unspoken question was evident. Should he be here?
Sherlock was still shaking, but no longer trying to hide it. He’d unfolded a little, let himself lean heavily on John. The detective twitched his fingers against the doctor’s leg.
The Detective Inspector gave a doubtful, apologetic shrug. “I’d do it, of course, but getting clearance for something like that takes time. Weeks, sometimes.”
John settled his detective on the toilet seat, pyjama bottoms around his ankles. He was saved the trouble of wondering what to do next when Sherlock overbalanced and nearly fell forward, saved only by one of John’s hands. Which is how John ended up on his knees in front of the toilet, supporting his friend and pretending he was somewhere else while Sherlock was almost certainly doing the same.
Sherlock looked at him approvingly. “Now, we act as any other doctor and patient. In a month from now, however, I will be on the operating table and you will hack into the administrative mainframe and steal every bit of data you can.”
By the time John got to the back of Sherlock’s right knee, he’d entered a sort of Zen state. The doctor was so far lost in his own head, he nearly missed the sparkle aimed his way from the head of the tub. But a light caught his eye, and John looked up to see Sherlock, his light eyes open, alert, and shining.
“No,” said John, flatly. “It isn’t a joke.”
Which had been followed by an honest smile, a kiss on tip-toe, and a night, week, and month of time that were unprecedentedly wonderful. It was like Sherlock had already filled every aspect of John’s life but one, and that last piece had finally been put in place. It had been strange in the most amazing way possible.
Sherlock Holmes was bored, as well as annoyed with his captor. This certainly wasn’t what the Game was all about, sitting in a room with nothing but a low-key struggle with nicotine addiction for entertainment. No, he wanted to be doing things, deducing things, fighting Moriarty in a battle of wits. But it seemed that the particular lesson the criminal was trying to impart had less to do with Sherlock himself and more to do with the people around him. Moriarty had come right out and said that he was trying to prove to Sherlock how useless his companions were, which indicated that he was setting them a challenge instead of the detective himself, setting them challenge at which Moriarty had already decided they had no chance of success.
“Here we go,” John exclaimed, drawing Mrs. Hudson and the Detective Inspector to watch the laptop screen from behind John’s chair. They were met with an awkwardly angled black-and-white video of a London streetcorner. John recognized it as being hardly half a block from the entrance to the St. Bart’s Mortuary.
“How? How did you get a message out?”  Moriarty’s voice was rushed, but the intrigued madness within was readily audible.
Then, the detective allowed his eyes to close as John continued to methodically check him for injuries, only a slight blush on the smaller man’s features.
Just then, Wilkes came back to the room with a thin manila envelope. He looked at John as if trying to assure himself of the man’s sanity before proffering the envelope along with a pen. As John signed in the indicated boxes, the Doctor of Business Sciences explained his new duties.
Sherlock looked confused and stiffened for a second, then relaxed a little in his John’s arms.
The consulting criminal schooled his face into a facsimile of guilt before brightening. “Yes, sorry about that, but to be fair how was I to know who they’d choose as a sacrifice? Anyway, they’re gone now, so no need to worry about that happening again. At least, not because of those amateurs. If anyone has the right to burn our Sherlock from the inside, it’s me. Only me.”
After a quick glance at the two monitors that were displaying Sherlock’s vital signs (slightly distressed, but not dangerous enough to call for medical intervention), John joined him on the bed. He stroked his flatmate’s head with the hand that wasn’t circling his wrist, murmuring softly.
“What,” seethed the madman, “are you thinking?”
John blinked, a bit taken aback, before responding. “Baker Street would be as good as anywhere. Not much in the way of comings and goings, and Mrs. Hudson knows who we usually associate with. You wouldn’t have to bother moving the cameras and microphones we both know you’ve installed about the flat, and I already know all the ins and outs in case something does go wrong.”
As far as Sherlock had deduced, he had minimal control over some muscles, just not the ones that mattered. He could move his facial features without much concentration, and even twitch fingers and toes with some effort, but the rest was practically useless. All his gravity-fighting muscles, the arms, legs, neck and whatnot, were utterly beyond the detective's control. He couldn't even open his eyes.
John couldn’t have said how long they stayed like that, Sherlock softly shaking and John whispering completely true endearments. The doctor was dimly aware that his knees were still hurting, but he honestly couldn’t bring himself to care at the moment. Knees were never bruised in nobler circumstances.
“So, Mr. Holmes . . .” he drawled on, sounding bored.
Sherlock had even started solving cases again. He and John had developed a system in which John would read e-mailed requests for help aloud, and Sherlock would do his best to indicate the solutions to people’s puzzles. John ended up with a far greater knowledge of how many mundane cases he and Sherlock were given on a regular basis, as the only ones they could solve under the circumstances were ones that didn’t require the detective to directly observe anything. And yet, he still solved nearly all of them, usually before John had finished reading their descriptions. These were the cases that Sherlock would normally turn down before John got a chance to see them, but as far as entertaining his detective was concerned, they were the best the doctor could do under the circumstances.
“Or you could just watch the CCTV footage I’ve just e-mailed to Dr. Watson’s laptop.”
John was still incredibly wrongfooted, but couldn’t deny that, if this man was doing what he said he was doing, he’d be more than willing to help. But then again, whether or not the obviously brilliant man was telling the truth, or even sane, had not been established to John’s satisfaction. Still, he was unsure how to pose the question. “Are you or are you not delusional?” seemed like a rather ineffectual way to put it.
John’s detective didn’t respond other than to curl even further in on himself, twisting his face away from the doctor.
There was a small crowd gathering around Sherlock now, the few passersby obviously torn between wanting to help the gasping figure on the ground and trying to avoid the human appendages now strewn over the sidewalk. Then, an ambulance pulled up and two people dressed in white lifted John’s friend onto a gurney. They clearly weren’t medical personnel, that much was obvious from the careless way they handled Sherlock. They hadn’t even avoided putting pressure on his ribs! Indignance joined John’s concern, and he seethed. But the footage on the screen went on, as the two not-professionals loaded John’s best friend into the back of the ambulance. Then, it pulled away, and the screen went dark again.
Within the first week, things fell into a sort of pattern. John would wake up early and make himself a cup of tea while browsing on his laptop. An hour or so later, a technician would come in bearing breakfast and whatever vitamins and immune boosters Sherlock was due to be given that day. John would remove his own food and put the rest in the room’s miniature refrigerator, then retreat to the staff lounge. There he’d spend a few hours chatting with whatever doctors and, occasionally, administrators who weren’t busy, keeping an ear out for anything that seemed important. Sometimes he’d wander the hallways, idly exploring. This was all easier to do without his cane—John hadn’t even noticed it until the next day, but when he’d gone looking for Sherlock in the middle of the night, he’d apparently been in such a hurry he forgot the thing. And waking up to see the hated crutch still where he’d left it before the little adventure had been a powerful case to the doctor’s subconscious that he hadn’t needed it in the first place.
“How nice to see you, little pet!” squealed the deranged criminal as John cracked the door open. “May I come in?”
“The body has different ways of dealing with danger. One of them is to ignore it, leaving the mind free to face whatever situation until the danger has passed. Then, it hits you with everything it had been holding back whether it makes sense in the new context or not. Well, when someone hugs you, they’re doing their best to prove to you that you’re safe now, and promising that they’ll keep you that way.”
Sherlock didn’t look at him. Whatever personable light had been in his expression before hid itself, and the detective’s face was stone. “Isn’t that what you’d expect a person to do, John? Try to escape?”
“Sorry about the taxi,” the sing-song voice went on, not sounding sorry in the least. “We had to get you here, and alone, for all of this to work.”
“Excellent decision, Dr. Watson.”  The man on the screen stood mostly in shadow, in what appeared to be an abandoned warehouse, but John could make out a black umbrella in his right hand.
“You’d have gone all guilty—” Sherlock made a wild gesture with one arm, knocking over the last of the juice drink onto the asphalt below.
John, still dumbstruck, nodded weakly. “Yeah, her help’s worth it.”  He crossed to Anthea. “The CCTV footage? Of the whole track between Bart’s and here?”
John was incredulous. “No bearing? How do you expect me to do any hacking when I can’t even make a computer do what everyone can make a computer do in a reasonable amount of time?!”
“Please don’t interpret my concern as anything sinister, Dr. Watson. I’m merely looking out for Sherlock’s best interests. To that end, I’d like you to do something for me.”
Shaking his head, John returned to the book he’d been neglecting since Sherlock had come over and sat on it and him. Then, he was interrupted by the doorbell. A look at Sherlock confirmed that, so deep in his experiment, the detective hadn’t even noticed the interruption, so John made his way down the stairs to answer it. It was too early in the day to be one of Mycroft’s people with take-away, so John was slightly suspicious. Mrs. Hudson was out, and he assumed she may have left her key, but that didn’t stop the doctor from making sure his gun was still tucked in the back of his jeans.
“Nnnnn.”  That one sounded annoyed, and no wonder. John had a feeling Sherlock could lose a limb and not ask for an increase in pain meds. Not when pain meds were indirectly responsible for his lack of physical control, at least.
“It wasn’t a suicide pill, and he didn’t hand it to me; that’s what made it a puzzle. I’d chosen correctly, and was therefore in no danger. Please, John, at least try to remember things correctly.”
It had been a long time since John felt quite the way he did at this moment. Here he’d been expecting to find his friend in some life-threatening predicament, one from which only the intervention of John’s common sense could have saved him, and here the man was standing in the middle of the hallway, a very damaged straightjacket hanging from his shoulders and bruises on his face. One did not have to be Sherlock Holmes, World’s Only Consulting Detective to see that John’s closest friend had clearly fought his own way out of whatever predicament he was in. John felt glad, of course, as Sherlock was alive, but also frustrated, concerned, angry, and vaguely proud.
“Of course she was helping you. You were in charge of this whole operation, that much was obvious from the angle of your shoulders as you ran down the hall.”  He caught John’s eye, recognizing the need for elaboration.
“Don’t worry,” John whispered, moving even closer to his love’s head and holding his hand even tighter, fingers drawn to that reassuring pulse. “I’ve got you, and it’s all going to be fine.”
As she said that, John’s laptop gave the little ding of a received message. The e-mail contained links to the records of local ambulance corporations and hospitals, as well as additional video footage from both the streets around Bart’s and the security cameras of the largest local ambulance corporations.
For the first time since he’d gotten Mycroft’s text message, John realized that, if Sherlock was going to be found, it was only John who’d be able to find him. Mycroft couldn’t help, and Lestrade wouldn’t have the resources until it would almost certainly be too late. So, it was up to John. And John wasn’t about to let his best friend in the world down.
At that, Anderson bit his nearly nonexistent lower lip and stormed off, leaving a wet trail of saline solution in his wake. As soon as the nurse rounded the corner, violin music started to flow from the open door he’d left behind.
Moriarty pouted. “Why, to visit Sherly, of course. I heard he wasn’t feeling well,” he added in a conspiratorial whisper.
“So you don’t like my idea,” Moriarty coughed, the light of triumph in his eyes in spite of the blood dripping from his chin. “Too bad. You don’t really have a choice in the matter. John will forget you, whether you want to believe it or not.” He moved to flounce from the room, turning only as he reached the doorway.
Sherlock rolled his eyes without opening them, but gave an affirmative, “Mmmm.”
“It would seem to me,” said the landlady, “that you all just need a little more information.”
Still on his guard, and trying not to give anything away, John replied, “I know that he’s not a usual sort of patient.” He kept his face stoic.
John fired.
As John wondered on his new situation, the third shocking circumstance came about. Dr. (or, as John now thought of him, Somewhat Sleazy Doctor of Business) Wilkes had all but run from the room to get the necessary forms for John’s employment, leaving John alone with Sherlock, who hadn’t waited more than half a breath before zeroing in on the doctor, a look in his eyes speaking of hardly restrained excitement.
The doctor pressed the power button on his phone and aimed the screen at the lumpy couch, on which Sherlock had been draped when John went to sleep. No consulting detective. He checked the hospital bed, still no consulting detective. A quick scan of the room didn’t reveal anyone, either.
It had all started with a rather unusual cult, bent on achieving enlightenment through ingestion of some strange cocktail of substances as set out by an Elizabethan-age manuscript. It had been a diary kept by a relatively high-level clergyman, in which he’d detailed the confessions of all the people in the region who had, under torture, admitted witchcraft. One woman had apparently been particularly creative, and had detailed a procedure by which one could attain ultimate knowledge. This had, of course, intrigued Sherlock, leading him to take on the cases of the cult’s victims (apparently, quite a number of the ingredients consisted of vital pieces of the human anatomy, which had been surgically removed from their previous hosts with little concern for whether the bodies in question could survive the procedures). Unfortunately, the cult in question had become aware of the consulting detective’s attentions, and decided he’d be an excellent sacrifice.
John was thoroughly out of patience with this exchange. “I don’t care if you’re his fairy godfather or something, I’m not going to be a part of it. Can I get out of this closet now?”
And there were a lot of points to consider. Besides what Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, and even Anthea found out, John had taken the liberty of utilizing Sherlock’s usual unorthodox method of information gathering—the homeless network—as well as dropping in on Angelo at his restaurant. Moriarty had better hope that it wasn’t any of Angelo’s friends that found him, as sweet-talking rarely helps when one is being torn limb from limb.
Sherlock turned his head to look at the doctor, one eyebrow raised. “I could ask you the same question.”
John was having trouble keeping his eyes open. He’d been staring at a map of London for hours, and didn’t seem to be seeing any more possible places where Moriarty could be keeping Sherlock. But since earlier that night, when he’d told Sarah, his employer and friend, that he couldn’t help with the emergencies at the surgery, John hadn’t been able to bring himself to give up in even the smallest of senses.
Sherlock lifted his head and seemed to ponder this for a minute before looking at the top of John’s head, twisting as much as he could with two broken ribs.
Wilkes went on. “Molly here is one of our best volunteer IPs. This is, what, your fourth round here?”
John was getting annoyed with Sherlock’s tone. “So, they’re looking into making more specialized incubator organs.”
John was beyond words, and settled for a nod.
When Sherlock’s hair stopped actively trying to trap John’s fingers, the doctor grabbed soap and washcloth and gently started to clean his way down the rest of his detective’s body. Neither person made a sound as John worked, such communication rendered entirely superfluous. For in every fold of skin, plane of muscle, ridge of scar, and knob of bone the doctor covered and rinsed of soap, he inscribed just how much he cared for his detective, saying with his hands what he couldn’t with words.
John had understood. Donovan and Anderson were the price to pay for police support. And while he might not like them, John wasn’t about to give up the significant benefits Scotland Yard could provide. Not when his friend’s life was in the balance.
Sherlock of course knew the time down to the hour (it was obvious from the sounds John made bustling about the room and, more occasionally, about the rest of the flat) even if the detective's own paltry internal clock was working further below par than usual. Sherlock found himself drifting into sleep or drug-induced unconsciousness with frustrating frequency. The absence of boredom was a welcome reprieve, but it all reminded Sherlock just how far he was from control of his person.
Sherlock was bored. More bored than he could ever remember being, as there wasn't even visual stimulation to break the monotony. Having one's eyelids shut in spite of all efforts tended to produce that result. Well, that and frustration. And even more frustrating exhaustion.
But John was not to be put off. He scooted himself sideways over to his flatmate, earnest if not graceful.
Still, it would be better for John if I escaped sooner. Prolonged absence is more likely to result in psychological damage. How much more likely, I’d know if I had an internet connection. Sherlock longed for his phone, not for the first time. Being deprived of research was as bad as lack of food and nicotine withdrawal put together. He had managed to create the perfect network, access a perfect web of information, just to be cut out of the middle of it and put in a box like any other spider a schoolchild found interesting.
John spoke up, turning down the volume on the police scanner as he did so. “What you’re saying is, someone is trying to run the police ragged so they can’t help find Sherlock?”  His mouth went dry as he was speaking.
Sherlock sighed dramatically. “Alright, perhaps that was a reasonable conclusion to your tiny little brain, but if you’d looked around the room for more than a minute, even you would have seen that there were no signs of a struggle.”
John walked purposely down the early morning street, looking for the man with the scraggly beard he’d seen earlier. He’d given the man a significant sum of money along with a list of addresses and instructions to look for anything suspicious. The doctor was usually quite careful about money, but this was a special case.
Sherlock was glad John talked to him. It was frustrating, not being able to ask any follow-up questions, but the doctor was fairly competent at anticipating them. So Sherlock knew exactly what had transpired from the time John had come to his rescue to the present, when John was still technically rescuing him. The gap between Sherlock feeling the pinch of a hypodermic in his thigh muscle and John's arrival at the factory was still a mystery, though one that had been rather cleared up by later evidence. Sherlock hoped John had photographed his internal organs, though he knew that to be rather unlikely. It just wasn't a John-like thing to do. Ah, well. He'd just have to be content with the ultrasound films.
