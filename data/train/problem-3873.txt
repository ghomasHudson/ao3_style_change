I was snapped out of my trance however when I suddenly felt a slightly heavy weight on my head and I realized Castiel had spilled the pancakes on my hair while he was whispering to me.
“You’re gonna pay for ditching me this morning, I hope you know that.” I felt soft lips whisper into my ear, the sound was smooth despite the threatening words.
I’ve never seen Castiel this happy, other than the times he’s with his friends I’ve never seen him wear a smile that isn’t cruel. No, this smile is different. This smile looks like he finally achieved something he’s been wanting for a long time and he just got it.
And that’s why it hurts even more that he hates me because every good trait that he has is what I look for in a partner.
“The fuck are you looking at Winchester?” I was interrupted from my dirty thoughts and I couldn’t believe he had caught me ogling him
I managed to let one of my arms escape his hold and I brought my hand up to wipe away my tears but Castiel stopped me. He’s now holding my arms even tighter than he was before.
The bell to start class began ringing, interrupting my thoughts and I noticed a certain someone was missing.
And if I thought it looked nice on the outside it paled in comparison looking inside. There was a golden double staircase surrounding the large foyer and all in all it looked like I was stepping into some kind of modern palace.
Thankfully since I was used to Castiel’s tactics I brought a spare change of clothes but it still wouldn’t hide the awful smell of the food he threw on me. And to top it all off I have to go to his house after school for the English assignment. I can even look at him let alone enter his lair.
“I’ll be here tomorrow I promise, I’ll even pack you your favorite cupcakes too.” She laughed and I shook my head at her.
Before she could take another step forward I pulled her harshly towards me to stop her. “Only I get to pick on him ok. If you lay a hand on Dean I won’t ever speak to you again,” I warned her.
Taking out the English assignment from my bag and the book that goes with it- The Scarlet Letter- I read over the directions to see what we needed to do.
I mean it’s possible. We all know he’s a fag. Especially with the way Dean is always nice to me and is always checking me out.
After parking the car and my chauffeur opening the door for me, the sunlight immediately hit my face so I put on my black ray bans and just entered the school with them on, not wanting to look at all the people staring at my presence.
The minute he closed the door behind him I finally got to breathe in the intoxicating smell that is Castiel Novak. It was all over this fucking room and it was hard for me to concentrate on even keeping up with a conversation.
Now coming to my table, the entire lunchroom became much more quiet when they saw that the prince of the school was approaching the scholarship loser who was sitting all alone.
“Yup pretty much. Got a problem with that?” He raised an eyebrow and it looked like he was waiting to see if I was going to argue with him but to his disappointment I just shook my head and took out his computer like he asked.
“Daph what did I say about calling me babe you know I said I want this relationship to be on and off, strictly no strings attached.” I explained, pushing the desperate girl away from me.
“You were late, no excuses.” She replied and shook her head at him. “This is the final time I’m letting you off and next time I’ll have to write you a detention. Go ahead and have a seat next to Mr. Novak, and let him be an example to you.”
“Don’t worry momma I’ll be good,” I couldn’t contain my excitement anymore and I gave her a quick hug goodbye before rushing out into the school to see just how nice it was on the inside.
I see the way Castiel pushes her away when she gets too clingy. He clearly has no interest in the girl.
His blue eyes were like fire as that glared into mine and I couldn’t control my own eyes tearing up because every word he spoke broke into me like a knife, aiming right at my heart.
Catching me staring at him, Castiel suddenly pushed Daph off of him and grabbed a leftover lunch tray of spaghetti that one of his one hundred friends didn’t use.
“But I can’t stop Dean, you see with you I can’t control myself. I can’t even do a fucking assignment with you for five minutes without wanting to tear you apart and expose every part of yourself that you hate. Expose every emotion that you hide.” He was now the one wiping my tears and he’s doing it softly.
I was hit with a strong scent of expensive cologne with a mix of body wash and it took all I had in me not to breathe it in on the spot.
When the smell of expensive cologne filled my senses and I felt muscular arms wrap around me, I knew exactly who had me trapped. “Where do you think you're going?” The devil asked in my ear, his free hand was pushing my damp hair out of my face.
But now I’m really starting to think he truly does mean everything he says to me, and it hurts more than I’d like to admit.
You’ve got to be kidding me, it’s a freaking essay? Though I got a scholarship because of my good grades it was mostly from hard work and studying, plus math and science have always been easy for me. But writing an essay has got to be the most difficult thing I had to do out of all the other work I get.
“Hi you must be Dean!” the teacher exclaimed, giving me a warm smile. “We’re already a few months into the school year but I’ll let you choose your seat so you can make some new friends. I also assume your uniform hasn’t arrived yet correct?” She asked.
I don’t know why I keep feeling hurt every time that boy is cruel to me, it’s like I feel betrayed or something even though it’s nothing new and we aren’t friends. But despite all of that I’ve still made it my mission for Castiel to like me, or at least tolerate me before the end of senior year.
“The driver has been waiting outside for over ten minutes Castiel. You need to be more mindful of everyone that waits on you and change for school quicker next time.” She scolded me, shaking her head while I rolled my eyes.
“Something as cheap and pathetic as this doesn’t belong in my school,” he explained as he ripped more and more.
Walking into his bathroom, I wasn’t even surprised to see the large tub in the middle and fancy shower right next to it. Meanwhile me, my parents, and Sam had to all share one bathroom and this boy has his own connected to his room.
“You’ve never actually made me miserable Castiel, and you never will. I won’t get put down by words that I know you don’t mean.” He tried to look strong with his unblinking stare and brave statements but I noticed his hands were shaking next to his side.
Opening my bag, he took out my lunch box and inspected what was inside. He then took out the container of the extra pancakes I packed earlier from breakfast with momma.
“My boss gave me a raise the other day so I decided to celebrate by buying a lot of groceries for food. You can finally have a proper breakfast today Dean.” She hugged me back, giving me a bright smile.
Looking at me through the rear mirror he smiled and shook his head. “It’s Ben, and no problem,” he politely replied.
“Yo Cas I almost forgot Dykey Dean was your locker buddy this year!” I heard right next to me, and I felt my face warming from the nickname I was called.
Sitting in the spot that I was in he leaned against his pillows and put his arms behind his head getting comfortable. “Hmm well at least you know your place.” He commented and though the words were rude I had to agree with them. I hate overstepping myself especially when I am surrounded by larger than life people. Aka people like Castiel.
“What the fuck is wrong with you? Don’t tell me you still have a crush on the bastard. Dean we talked about this back in middle school when he fucking destroyed your mom’s book bag she made you. That boy does not deserve someone like you!!” She yelled even more and I definitely regret telling her.
admits it though I’ll crush his heart without even blinking. Maybe then he’ll take the hint that I hate his guts.
I was like a drug addict, except in my case my addiction was to bring every negative emotion possible out of the ever so cheerful Dean Winchester and relish in it.
“C-castiel give it back, it was a present my m-momma made me,” I cried, trying not to stutter too much in front of him but I failed miserably.
“What do you mean?” His smooth voice asked innocently. “I was just trying to help you find your place here…..”
The moment I was faced with those blue orbs I instantly wanted to be closer to the boy, but I see he has other plans unfortunately.
I heard a few of the students snickering but I didn’t even bother to look at who was laughing and I just turned around and sat at the desk in the furthest back.
The ginormous white building seemed like it spreaded out for miles and it was equally as tall. There was a large gold fountain in the center of the circular driveway and I couldn’t even see any neighbors from here because of how private the property was.
He moaned softly, feeling Dean move away, and Castiel let him, he let him because he knew what the other was going to do. “You’ll never guess what I brought,” he said with a warm smile. Dean shuffled on the bed, leaning off of it and digging around in his bag. Castiel huffed after a moment, but smiled brightly when he looked at Dean’s hand.
“Cause you’re into me Cas, and you clearly don’t want to be,” Dean said, really nailing the head on the coffin. Not that Castiel was going to admit that. “And somehow I still like you even with your puke in my peripheral.”
“No kissing,” he mumbled as he grasped Castiel’s arms and brought them down to just rest on his chest. “Not unless we’re fucking.” Castiel furrowed his brow and he moved his hands to grasp at Dean’s and pull them away from him in general. He pursed his lips and crossed his arms over his chest.
Castiel slipped past Dean, and made his way to the kitchen quickly. He didn’t bother with the lights, and ignored the red blinking light of his answering machine that scarcely lit up the room every other second.  When he got into his kitchen though, he did flick on the little light above the sink. There on a shelf above it was mint mouthwash. Castiel grabbed for it, twisted the cap off, and drank a little straight from the bottle. The cool burn of the liquid definitely brought some life into him, and after swishing it around a couple seconds he was spitting it out. He wiped his mouth, turned around, and there Dean was, waiting patiently by the doorframe into the kitchen.
“Its fine. Dorothy and I get along amazingly,” Charlie said with a wave. She grabbed Castiel’s arms. “That’s not why I’m here, I’m supposed to be asking about you! How’s Californian life?” Castiel chuckled and looked around.
“What do you want Cas?” Dean asked, his voice a purr and right next to Castiel’s ear. “Want to be fucked? Right here in the back of my car?” God, Castiel really didn’t, but Dean never waited until they got to either of their houses. He nodded though, and pulled the Winchester closer.
“I’d rather not talk about it okay?” He looked over at Dean and for a second and Dean thought he saw something in Castiel’s eyes, but it changed and he looked back up at the board. Mrs. Broton had started her lesson and Dean watched as Castiel went into class mode. The other boy had started to write down notes, every so often looking up and scrunching his nose. Dean leaned back in his chair. There was no way he was going to be taking notes, especially when he could just copy off of Castiel later.
“They haven’t? I didn’t notice,” Castiel chuckled and Green Eyes leaned away from him. He watched as the other man looked around the bar and then had his eyes land back on Castiel’s. He leaned down to him again and Castiel felt himself swoon when he felt the warm breath against his lips.
Castiel and Dean were crashing against each other the second they had securely shut the door behind them in the Novaks’ apartment. The blue eyed man moaned as his hands slipped under Dean’s shirt and his hips rolled against the others. “Fuck me,” he breathed against the skin of Dean’s neck for what seemed like the millionth time. “Please Dean.” Dean moaned as well and he grasped Castiel’s hips, turning him roughly and pressing him against the kitchen counter.
“Whatever Sammy,” he mumbled and scooted his chair to be a little closer to the other man. Castiel shifted to stand up and he slipped his hand from the other’s.
He walks to his closet, the one place that doesn’t have clothes strewn about, and lets out a long sigh. He forgot to do the laundry last night. Of course, he had other things that he was doing, but he should have gotten a load done before getting high. Castiel groaned, running a hand through his greasy hair, and he heads towards the bathroom. If he freshens himself up then his clothes won’t smell that bad. Right? At this point Castiel didn’t even care. His head was aching and his body was shaking. He just wanted to do something. He needed to distract himself.
“Shut up,” he grumbled with a roll of his eyes. Castiel slid his hands up to grab onto Dean’s shoulders. He didn’t even let the other man get the opportunity to coax him into another kiss because he was shoving Dean to the side and onto his bed.
“Any time you want doll,” he said, and Charlie blushed a tad. She stuttered over her words a little, as if collecting her thoughts. Dean could tell though, he could tell she wasn’t interested in him, she was just surprised to be actually talking to someone famous. “Just get the gig?” Charlie looked down as they walked, Sam opening the door for her to leave the arena. Charlie smiled, thanking him.
“I slept well,” he said and smiled. “What about you? Did you sleep well?” He was wondering now, were they going to be sharing a bed? He’d never actually shared a bed with a man, just for the actual sleeping part.
See, Castiel knew that Dean was attractive. A person would have to be blind not to find the man’s bright green eyes or strong jaw appealing. It was annoying because anytime he got a look at the other he felt this twist in his stomach. Unbearable, truly. As Dean stepped up closer to Castiel, closing the distance between them, he found more things to appreciate. His freckles, or his nose, or the way his lips moved as he spoke.
“Cum.” Castiel’s eyes were squeezed shut, his entire body was tightening like a coil, and on the verge of springing open. There was a hand on his cock again, and it only took a couple more strokes before he was climaxing.
It took several moments before Castiel moved his hands away. He stared up at his ceiling, and tried his damndest to think about something other than the mess he was currently laying in. Jesus, he was so fucking stupid. So fucking weak.
“Fuck Cas,” he breathed and fell back against the door. his grip in Castiel’s hair tightened and he rolled his hips into Castiel’s face. “Do it, suck me off.” Castiel obliged and he pulled Dean’s boxers down, hand going to grasp the other’s throbbing member and tongue slipping out to slide across the length of it. A few seconds later and Castiel was taking Dean into his mouth with a moan, rolling his tongue around it and pushing farther in. His eyes squeezed shut and he started to bob his head, making sure that his teeth grazed across Dean’s cock every so often because he’d picked up that the other had liked it. Dean moaned again and Castiel heard his head bang against the door.
“I love them,” she said with a slight smirk. Her cheeks had gone back to a normal color and Castiel wouldn’t lie and say that she didn’t look even more adorable with it. Her freckles even seemed to grow a different shade when she did so. “I mean, my mom would read the Hobbit to me every night before I would go to bed. Not the whole thing, but bits and pieces until I would drift off.” Castiel nodded with a small smile.
“So slow?” He asked and Castiel nodded. Dean moved to be pressed against Castiel, a hand slipping under Castiel’s shirt and smoothed across the sweaty skin. “I can work with that.” He kissed the side of Castiel’s neck and peppered them up the skin, smile spreading when he reached Castiel’s scruff. “You’re not clean shaven.” The words were so hot against Castiel’s ear, and Dean’s cock was continuously pushing in, filling Castiel nicely.
“I get off in five, my car is the ‘67 Chevy Impala,” he practically purred and Castiel’s eyes fluttered close at the sound of that. “I expect you to be there when I walk out.” Castiel nodded, eyes still closed and when he opened them Green Eyes was gone. The blue eyed man didn’t have to be told twice, his entire body was stricken with the most beautiful feeling of pleasure and he was out of his chair in a matter of seconds.
“I was hoping you were going to be giving me a ride,” Tessa said with a smile as she looked up at Dean and pressed a quick kiss to his lips. He smiled against her soft skin and licked his lips once she pulled away. “Can you do that?”
“Boring,” he commented as he tangled his fingers with hers. “Although Cas has Biology with me now.” He still couldn’t decide if that was a good thing or a bad thing.
Castiel and Dean have been fucking around for nearly two weeks now. They've done a lot, but Dean hasn't actually slipped it in Castiel. Charlie thinks its because Dean isn't going to be that gay, but Castiel keeps thinking that its because he's shy, and scared that he's going to mess up. They still don't know each other's names, that is, until they get introduced in Castiel's favorite place and sneak off to get it on in the autobiographies.
Castiel pushed the door closed, locked it, and turned around just in time for Dean to grab at his shirt and close what little space they had between them. He had barely enough time to duck his head down when the other man went in for a kiss.
“Dammit Sam I might just leave you in Omaha if you keep talking about my health. You’re my kid brother, not my doctor,” he said, sipping his soda. “If I wanted to be reminded of my health I would have brought along Dr. Devereaux, because he is such a big ball of sunshine.” Which was a complete lie. Devereaux did his job, but he liked to insult Dean as he did it. It wasn’t a problem, he got Dean to drop the bottle, and he made him stay away from it. So Dean thanks him for that, he just wished he had better bedside manner.
Castiel looked over at Green Eyes and then at the road. “Saddlehorn Drive,” he said and watched as Green Eyes nodded. “Do you know how to get there?”
Win they did not. The Leviathans decimated the Hunters. A whopping 42 points to the Hunters’ 14. Dean couldn’t get past the fucking defense. He only went a few plays without being tackled or having to throw the ball away to eliminate the risk of a sack. The quarterback couldn’t get a single god damn word in either, because the second he would try to talk to Castiel? The other man was retreating to someplace else, or getting some sort of help for his wrist. The wrist thing wasn’t bad, but he was still ignoring Dean at all costs. When they got into the locker room? He kept quiet, he dressed quickly, and only stuck around for Bobby’s last remarks.
Just as he held up his hand to tell her to go away, the girl was holding up her ID. “Charlie Bradbury, Rolling Stone Magazine,” she said, pushing her glasses up the bridge of her nose. Dean looked her over. Long red hair, thick rimmed glasses. He really didn’t want to do an interview right now, and Dean had a feeling that was exactly what Miss Bradbury wanted. “I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.” Dean wanted to put up some resistance. He wanted to say no to the woman and tell her to fuck off, but he wasn’t that person anymore. Dean could be civil with people, and he could sit down and do an interview.  Especially if it was Rolling Stone.
Castiel was about to say something but Green Eyes was already heading down to the other end of the bar. How hard was it to say a rum and coke? Apparently pretty fucking hard when you had the walking and talking image of sex staring at you with his too fucking perfect face. Castiel clenched his jaw and looked down. He needed to calm himself, he really did because if he didn’t he could vitally ruin his chance with Green Eyes. Of course, he could have absolutely no chance if the man was straight, but no man that beautiful should just be exclusive to girls. Castiel glanced down over the bar and holy shit, how long was he going to use that expression? Holy shit God had given Green Eyes the most beautifully shaped ass in all the world. Castiel thought he had one to be looked at, but no, fuck no did it compare to Green Eyes. The blue eyed man stared longer than should be appropriate and fixed his glasses, pushing them up the bridge of his nose with an intake of breath. “Fuck,” he muttered and then the man was turning back toward him.
“Thanks for the compliment?” He asked as he slipped his helmet on, everyone else joining because it was game time. Bobby was at the door to the stadium and all of them huddled close.
“Charlie!” Castiel exclaimed as he sat up to glare at her. “Its his first time messing with a dude, he’s shy.”
“Hey brother, are you and Cas going to be on your top game tonight?” Benny asked as he stood next to his locker. The southern slipped on his under armor shirt as Dean started working on his pads. Dean shrugged his shoulders and looked at Benny.
“Only in the room?” He asked with a raised brow and Castiel rolled his eyes. He leaned away as Dean shifted to pour him his usual drink.
“Be mad at me,” Dean breathed as he popped off of Castiel for a second. Castiel hissed and he pushed Dean’s head towards his cock again, the other man moved to nip at the side of the Novak’s cock. Castiel was quickly becoming a moaning and quivering mess. “I’m still going to blow you.” Castiel smirked and he rolled his hips against Dean’s face. His eyes were screwed shut and his breath hitched as Dean took him back into his mouth.
When they got to the field they exited the car, the morning dew getting Castiel’s sneakers damp. He didn’t care though, because after a little bit they were on the hood of the Nova. Dorothy was messing around with clothes in the trunk, and Charlie was lying next to Castiel. The sun was just breaching the sky with warm pink and orange colors.
“The Gods Themselves?” He asked and Charlie nodded. He smiled and sat down the book he was looking at. “Well, I’m not that far into it, but basically its the human race being a bunch of dicks and an alien race being the good guys.” Charlie wrinkled her nose and brought her brow together.
Dean stopped thinking right then and there. No, he wasn’t even going to contemplate doing anything with Castiel. He was the one that said they should never talk about it, so why was he even thinking about it? He walked into his math class and took his seat, trying his best to ignore the fact that Castiel was plaguing his mind more than Tessa was.
“The camper looks like its going to be cramped,” he said and walked past Dean, ignoring his statement. So Castiel liked to day dream, there is nothing wrong with that. He was always caught at school because of it. He always liked to just remember everything that happened in his life. He had a gift, he could remember anything if he just locked it away. Castiel liked reliving his memories, because memories are precious and they tell about a part of your life.
“I get that,” she said and bumped shoulders with Castiel. “Write him a letter.” Castiel thought gor a moment, that wouldn’t actually be a bad thing. He could tell Dean about what he was doing, and how much he missed him.
“Honestly Charlie, we never discussed last names, we just figured out first ones,” he said as he sat down beside her, handing her a bottle of Coke. “Does Dean Winchester have a younger brother name Sam?” That got Charlie upset, she leaned over to Castiel and her hand was in a tight fist as it came across his arm.
“Let’s start dinner yeah?” He asked and Dean just glared up at him. He crossed his arms over his chest and narrowed his eyes.
“Nice to know you asked!” Dean called after his brother and shook his head. “He’s such a dweeb.” Castiel smirked and he looked down again.
“Yeah? And how is she? Cause I’ve never met her,” Castiel joked along with Gabriel. Their conversation went on like this for several minutes. Every now and again Castiel would look up at the sky, wishing that instead of some forested drab blue it was a bright sky filled with little puffy clouds. Vietnam never looked like that though. The air was always thick, and on the days that it was sunny there was never a cloud in the sky. It didn’t take long before a piercing sound echoed in his ears. Castiel immediately dropped down into a crouch, hearing someone just splash down beside him. He looked down, seeing the muggy water before him turn a dark shade of maroon. Castiel didn’t have time to think about what was going on when another shot pierced the splashing. He could hear Lucifer shouting something, but he couldn’t quite make out what as the shots continued to fire. Eventually he just started to follow the group, heading for cover opposite of the shots. Another few shots rang out before they stopped, Castiel with the rest of the group minus the person who was laying in the water dead.
“If it was I think we’d all be dead, because I have no idea where he is,” the sergeant replied, reloading the clip and sliding it back into place. He cocked his pistol and they all looked at Samandriel. “Alright, who has the radio?”
“Johnson did,” Castiel said, finally adding into the conversation. His eyes stayed on Samandriel’s, studying his face. How could someone have this good of a shot? How could they get it dead in the center if they weren’t that close. He looked up at Lucifer, watching him curse under his breath. Could…. Could Lucifer have done it? No. No that was crazy, there was absolutely no reason for the sergeant to have shot Samandriel. The kid was as innocent as possible. If someone even mentioned the word pussy his face would flush and he would get all awkward.
Castiel rolled his eyes and he glared up at Dean. “God did everybody grow under a rock?” He retorted and he had no idea where his anger was coming from. “It comes from Cassiel, who was the angel of Saturday. Does no one open a Bible?” Dean and Sam both looked up at Castiel and they cocked a brow.
“The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy?” He asked as he turned the book around to start reading the summary. “One Thursday lunchtime the Earth gets unexpectedly demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass.” Castiel cocked a brow and continued to read barely audible. “For Arthur Dean, who has only just had his house demolished that morning.” He smirked and licked his lips. “Sounds like this guy doesn’t have the best of luck.” The blue eyed man chuckled and opened his mouth to finish up the summary. “This seems to be more than he can cope with. Sadly, however, the weekend has only just begun, and the galaxy is a very strange and startling place.” Castiel sucked his bottom lip into his mouth and pondered it for a moment before smirking and walking away from the isle of books, settling on just one. He pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose again and that was when he felt the tap on his shoulder.
“Are we not cool?” Dean asked, finally breaking the silence between them. He looked over at Castiel who had his arms crossed over his chest and the other boy shrugged his shoulders.
“Yeah, I just gotta tell my brother that I’m going away for the weekend.” Dean nodded and he walked down the other end of the bar. Castiel, like he always did when he got the chance, immediately started to look at Dean’s rear. It was so beautiful, so well sculpted in the tight jeans that surrounded his body. Castiel smirked because it reminded him of a time when they were in Dean’s car.
“Okay Cas,” he heard Dean murmur as he moved his mouth next to Castiel’s ear, teeth going to nibble on his lobe. “Whatever you want.” Castiel shivered and he nodded his head, causing Dean’s grip on his ear to tighten. Fuck it felt so amazing, every piece of Dean that was touching Castiel was just igniting every nerve in his body. Dean Winchester was truly a god among men. His broadly built, muscles peeking up around every piece of him and making curves. They were so smooth and inviting and Castiel would be perfectly content if that was all he was allowed to do to Dean, just touch him and get nothing in return.
When they approached the so called party area Castiel was quick to notice that there was entirely no one around. He turned to Charlie and cocked a brow. “I thought you told me there was a party going on?” He asked and Charlie just nodded.
"Dean! Cas!" He yelled as he downed another beer from the side of the aluminium. "And you brought your ladies!" He tossed the can to the ground and walked up to them, two women hanging off of his shoulder, their cheeks tinted red and their smiles huge.
“God no,” he muttered and he shook his head, just thinking about one making him sick to his stomach. “No, they’re not in any interest of mine.”
“Orange 17,” Dean called out as he looked at his other teammates. “Orange 17.” He let out a big sigh and the ball was in his hands. He took his calculated step back and looked out into the crowd, finding Ash exactly where he needed to be. The quarterback threw the ball and he moved himself away from Zachariah and Raphael who were about to push him to the ground. He observed as Ash caught the ball and no one seemed to be around him. The running back’s feet touch the ground and he was off. He immediately raced his way toward the touchdown grass, which was painted bright red and Dean couldn’t hide his excitement because he knew no one was going to be able to stop him.
After a few awkward thrusts they finally seemed to find their rhythm. Castiel would roll his hips down while Dean would thrust up. It was hard, deep, and exactly what he needed. It also certainly helped Castiel’s experience when Dean wrapped a hand around his cock, pumping in time with his thrusts up into him.
Castiel would have gone farther into thought if the driver’s side door hadn’t swung open. He smiled and looked over to Dean, sliding across the bench seat to lay his hand on the other’s thigh. “Well you don’t take any time,” he said and Castiel rolled his eyes. He would miss that. The voice of angels that was Dean’s. Castiel’s hand went to rub in between before scaling it up to press his palm against the other man’s crotch. “Jesus fuck Cas.”
“Fuck I love with you,” he breathed and smiled idiotically. Castiel arched his back up, still not believing that he was so comfortable with saying that he loved Dean. He never thought that he would actually love someone, to want something more with a person. Although, it still didn’t change all the underlying talks that they still had to get to, but that could wait. A slight rub to his prostate and Castiel was long gone. He groaned and moved with Dean’s finger, only wincing slightly when a second finger was added.
“Alright,” he mumbled and kissed the top of Castiel’s head. Dean moved away and stripped off his shirt. Castiel’s eyes glazed over as he watched Dean, instantly becoming entranced by the other’s body. The older Winchester noticed and he looked over at Castiel. “Getting a good look Cas?” Castiel blushed deeply and looked away, searching for his swim trunks. He found them, the deep blue short trunks and then started to strip the clothing off himself. This time it was Dean’s turn to stare.
“No,” he said and then he shook his head. “I mean, yes I want you to go. I really do.” He slid the glass down the bar and placed his hand on the glossed wood. “But are you sure? This is four days of just you, me, and my brother.” Castiel clenched his jaw and he nodded.
“I can tell that you’ve been wanting to touch me since you first looked at me,” he whispered and God, Castiel didn’t even know his voice could take on a deeper, even sexier tone than before. Castiel shivered and smirked.
Dean blinked at him, and Castiel couldn’t help but wonder if maybe the question went over his head. By the second blink though, Dean’s eyes were going wide and he felt the man’s hands squeeze his ass, “help… Definitely help.” His hand moved from groping at his ass to slipping in between them. Castiel raised his eyebrow as he felt rough fingers press onto his lips. “Wet ‘em for me. Will ya?”
Castiel’s eyes rolled so far into his head he nearly swayed from the action. He went back to hanging his head over the porch, staring down at the mess he made. Why the hell was Dean still talking to him when the guy was literally in view of his vomit? Wouldn’t that be enough for someone to get the idea that maybe he should be left alone? Apparently not with Dean Winchester. He groaned, squeezing his eyes shut and running a hand through his hair again.
“Don’t make me sound like a small scared child, someone could seriously kill me,” Castiel murmured. He rolled his eyes because of Dean’s childish smile. “Nevermind, I’ll go by myself. If I die I’m going to have a text set that will say its all Dean Winchester’s fault because he didn’t come with me.” He turned away from Dean and walked over to Meg quickly. Dean followed behind and wrapped his arms around Tessa’s waist.
“This fire is too hot,” Castiel grumbled as he tossed his can in it. The world around him was getting slightly dull, well, all of it except Dean, which Castiel found to be rather odd.
“Well I do, a lot actually.” He closed up his locker and slung his bag over his shoulder. “So am I taking you to my house?”
“Maybe I will,” he mumbled and pressed his lips to Castiel’s, causing the Novak to melt against his lips. “After we actually fuck in a bed.” He melted at that. Dean never talked about any future plans, even if it was for fucking. He was always in the moment and Castiel enjoyed that.
No, Dean didn’t need alcohol to be a good musician. All he needed was the confidence to do what he wanted. Next he strummed his guitar listening to the notes echo throughout the stadium. The sound technician gave a thumbs up and Dean nodded to pull his guitar off of him. Just a few more hours and he’d be singing in front of a packed stadium. His stomach felt queasy, but at the same time he knew he was hungry as he headed back stage. “Sammy,” Dean called seeing his brother walked around a corner and into view. Sam raised a brow.
Castiel had been nursing his third strange concoction of peach schnapps and Jack Daniel’s as his eyes traveled across the crowded room. The booze had certainly started to take effect because his gaze finally began to wander to places he didn’t often let himself look. It strolled along broad shoulders covered by worn leather, then dipped down to see a nice set of buttocks perfectly shaped by dark denim. Castiel was usually one to catch himself whenever this happened. The staring. He didn’t often delve into his carnal desires, but tonight was different. He was here to delve.
He looked away then, down towards the liquor, and moved his hand out to grab a bottle again before it was being swatted at.
“Yes olive oil,” he said with a furrow of his brow. Dean laughed again and he took the oil. “Is that a problem?” Castiel cocked a brow and watched as Dean shook his head.
“Not yet,” he breathed and he moved a little, spreading his legs some. “I have to get used to it.” Dean nodded against Castiel’s cheek, a small chuckle escaping as his body shook. Castiel had tickled him with his scruff. It was a few moments before Castiel nodded and he rolled his hips. “You can move.” Dean kissed him again and then pulled out slowly, it was with ease and he thrusting back in, a little bit quicker and hitting Castiel’s prostate. “Oh fuck.” He clenched and Dean moaned along with Castiel.
“Oh you think you’re my best friend?” Dean said as he cocked a brow. “No see you’re the guy that everyone follows into the woods to take advantage of. :
“We’re supposed to act like it didn’t happen,” Dean stated. “I mean why haven’t we talked at all today?” Castiel looked at Dean again and cocked a brow, even though Dean couldn’t see it because of the helmet.
“I’m not gorgeous,” he mumbled and Meg rolled her eyes. She grabbed her drink from the bar and then walked off. Castiel looked over at Dean and he saw the other’s expression. “What? I’m not gorgeous.” Dean chuckled and he shook his head.
Dean sat back in his seat. “So you like to be thorough?” He asked, resulting in her to nod her head. Dean nodded back as well and crossed his arms over his chest. “Well, then get on with it Velma. I’m an open book.” Charlie frantically nodded and flipped a few pages back on her notepad, adjusting her glasses.
When he reached the edge of the porch, guarded by a dilapidated fence, he leaned over and that was when he finally let his stomach fully lurch. He retched as he gripped the splintered wood of the fence, completely emptying the contents of his stomach. It burned his mouth and his nose, but he just let it happen. Castiel learned a long time ago that holding back vomit usually did nothing to truly stop it.
The Novaks’ apartment was small, it had two bedrooms, a bathroom, a small living area and the kitchen which was where the front door was located. There was a small balcony, but besides that it was really nothing special. Castiel liked that, small living areas when there weren’t that many people living together. It fit both him and Gabriel and that was enough.
“The party isn’t necessarily here,” Dean retorted as he looked between the two of them and it clicked in his brain that neither of them had been to a party at Ash’s. He smirked again because he knew that they were going to be in for a treat. He looked back out the window, turned to give Tessa a knowing look then got out of the car. She smiled and looked at the couple before removing herself as well. Dean closed the door and was happy for the slight drizzle that had happened while he was driving, he watched as Castiel got out of the car and stretched his muscles. Dean chuckled slightly when he heard the small squeak emanate from Castiel’s mouth. “You’re a fucking dweeb.” The other boy looked at him and cocked an eyebrow.
"You go sit, I'll get us more beer.” Castiel left Dean and the quarterback shuffled over to a log and plopped down onto it. He looked up at the sky and smiled as rain fell down onto his cheeks. He closed his eyes and completely drowned everything out that was going on around him. He liked the little flecks of cold that were peppering his cheeks. He welcomed it and he felt his stomach churn slightly from the alcohol. “Here you go.” Castiel plopped down beside Dean, handing the other boy an opened beer.
Dean obliged, though at the cost of stroking his cock. He grabbed onto both of Castiel’s hips and thrusted up while bringing him down, essentially spearing him on Dean’s cock. Castiel didn’t even bother to hold back his cry of pleasure from the action, and it only egged Dean on more. He kept the pace, and Castiel felt his entire body filling to the brim with pure hot pleasure.
“So back to my freckles,” he whispered and Castiel rolled his eyes, pressing a soft kiss over one of his tattoos. He never talked about it before, but Dean had several tattoos. There was a pentagram surrounded by a sun on his chest. Wrapping letters along the curve of his hip, ‘Hey Jude’, which Dean once explained was for his mother who he didn’t have any more in his life. There was a snake wrapping around his ankle, but that was all Castiel had seen, they were all so simple in the sense, but at the same time they were extremely important to Dean.
“I’m sorry,” Dean breathed shyly as he looked down at Castiel, moving them so that the Novak was pressed against a tree. “I’m sorry for pissing you off.” Castiel shook his head and tugged at Dean’s shirt.
“So, if you weren’t having financial issues you wouldn’t have come back?” Dean took a second to think that out. He still thinks he would have come back. Dean enjoyed being on the stage, it was what it lead him to that freaked him out the most.
“Enjoying the view?” Dean asked, reaching out and grabbing for Castiel’s hip. He let himself be pulled forward, and experienced a pulse of pleasure from feeling their cocks slide together.
The blue eyed man had been all set and ready to cross the street when he noticed that Charlie had ducked behind him and rushed over to a door. He quickly swiveled on his feet and caught up with her with ease. “Is this the place?” He asked and she nodded.
“Stanford,” he said, scooting over to Dean. He watched as Green Eyes flipped the radio on, settling it on a Jazz station.
“Why the hell are you so pissed at me?” He questioned, and Castiel only stood up, tackling him to the ground.
“When people come into the woods Cas they usually try to get it on,” Dean said as he stopped too and looked down at Castiel. “You know, try to have sex.”
“You’re at it again aren’t you?” Dean asked and Castiel snapped out of it, looking over at the other boy.
He knew how hard he was, and had no indecision that Dean could feel it. He took in a large breath when he felt cold hands slipping down into his boxers, and practically thrusted into them despite the temperature.
“I do,” he whispered and he stopped moving, hips pressed against Castiel and cock fully inside of him. “It tickles.” Castiel’s breath caught as he tried to take all of Dean in, to relax his entire body, because there was no way that he would decline having Dean’s cock in him. Dean started to pull out and Castiel clenched around him, causing Dean to stutter and push back in. “Oh fuck Cas.” A small moan escaped him and Castiel shook his head.
“We’re just messing around remember Dean? We shouldn’t hold hands,” he said and he walked a little farther from Dean, trying not to look at the other. He knew what Dean’s face would look like. It would be hurt, because even Castiel knew that there was something between them, something that was a whole lot more than messing around. Castiel cared for Dean, and they didn’t even know each other that well.
“Well then what are we Castiel?” He asked and fuck, it felt so amazingly hot to hear Dean say his name. Although, he did like that Dean called him Cas.
“She was not a poor and helpless girl, she dragged me in the woods herself,” Dean retorted as he walked with Castiel.
Dean smirked. “What? You don’t want to dissect things?” He asked in a hushed voice as he watched Castiel turn to face him again. The other boy shook his head and Dean cocked a brow. “Why?” Castiel shrugged and pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose.
“I know its old, it really cramped, and it doesn’t really offer much, but,” Dean started until Castiel leaned forward and connected their lips, pressing him to the countertop. The sandy blonde haired man smiled against Castiel’s lips and wrapped his arms around his waist.
“Oh you know, the service is really great,” he said as he sipped at his rum and coke. Dean had passed by and Castiel’s eyes wandered to his ass again, but Meg didn’t seem to notice.
“Face paint brother,” he said as he looked over at Dean. “Gotta get a game face on.” Dean chuckled because Ash looked absolutely ridiculous. “Hey, you need one too.” The wide receiver leaned over to Dean and he smeared black paint across his cheek.
Castiel zipped Dean’s pants up roughly and scaled his hand up the other’s side. “Are you going to fuck me tonight?” He asked, because it was getting to the point where it just needed to happen. Dean kept saying that he wanted to, so why the fuck hadn’t he yet? Dean looked down and slipped his hands in his pockets, sucking a lip into his mouth. He shrugged his shoulders and looked off to the side. “Why not?”
“Thank you so much!” He said happily and then he grasped Castiel’s hand, tugging him towards the piles of books for sale. Castiel chuckled and couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face at the way Sam lit up. “I like fantasy and science fiction.”
“That’s why I like it so much,” he said and then he picked up another book. They did this for a while, every so often making casual conversation. Castiel liked Charlie and his’ relationship. They didn’t always have to talk, and they just enjoyed each other’s company. They both also liked the fact that they couldn’t get the other’s hopes up in no possible way. He eventually found a book that looked good enough and bought it for a later day, skimming through the pages. When he went to go sit down and actually read, leaving Charlie by the cheaper books, he only got into the first few pages before his mind drifted to Green Eyes in the movie theater.
“Honestly?” He asked, Charlie nodded. “I don’t know Miss Bradbury.” He leaned forward, crossing his arms over his chest. “I came back because I’m broke, and performing on that stage is the only thing I know what to do.”
“So I’ve never seen you before,” he said and Castiel shivered because his voice was just so empowering. “Where are you from?”
Dean could believe that he guessed. If people didn’t want to see him then he wouldn’t have had a sold out show in the biggest arena in Nebraska. People had to at least care enough to spend twenty bucks for lawn seats. He sighed, his throat dry. Dean turned to Sam again and clicked his tongue. “We got anything cold on this thing?” He asked and Sam’s gaze flicked to look at Dean.
“Maybe you should close up the bar once and we can do it then.” Dean did his famous half smile and he pushed Castiel back against the passenger’s side door.
“I’m sorry,” he said with a frown and he watched as the other boy matched his expression. “I’m afraid that I don’t really know where anything is. I just got into this town only a few days ago.” Castiel watched as the kid looked down, but he nodded.
That was because Dean hadn’t. Castiel didn’t often dare go to parties, and he definitely didn’t find himself at Kappa Beta Sigma. It was simply the closest to his shitty little apartment, and he’d spent countless past Friday nights listening to the parties a block away.
"Get dressed." He moved his hands to cover his eyes, resting the bottoms of his palms against them. "And get out."
“Can I get a shower and change?” He asked and Charlie nodded. “Thank you.” He sighed and moved his arms to slip them in his shirt. Castiel was still rocking a massive hard on and there was no way that he wanted Charlie to see it. He looked at his friend and cocked a brow. “Are you going to leave or am I just going to have to get naked in front of you?” Charlie rolled her eyes and gagged.
“He’s shy?” Charlie cocked a brow then lolled her head back with a loud laugh. “He’ll suck you off in a movie theater, but he won’t fuck you because he’s shy?” Oh God was that a good time, Episode V had come out for Star Wars and Castiel really wanted to see it. He hadn’t expected to see Green Eyes there. He was just sitting in the back, enjoying a bag of popcorn before God’s best ass was in his face.
They went on like this for several minutes, sometimes they would break the kiss and just stare at each other before going back to it. Castiel ran his hands up and down Dean’s back, not truly believing that he was kissing his best friend. He moved his legs and Dean nestled himself in between them. He grasped at Dean’s shirt more as the man started to ground down on him, both of their clothed erections rubbing against each other and causing them to stop. Reality had snapped back to them and they looked at each other with swollen lips and flushed faces.
“The tips,” he said and Castiel laughed a little harder. “I’m dead serious, these pants are magical.”
“Because Cas, up until just now I was completely sold on the idea that Dean Winchester was a red blooded, cold hearted, lady killer. I didn’t know that he’d actually been batting for the other team.” Castiel’s eyes grew wide, not believing that in any form.
“I’m going on a walk,” he grumbled as he looked at the three of his friends and walked away from them, stealing Meg’s beer as he did so. He drank it and couldn’t help but like the warm fuzzy feeling it was generating as he walked away from the party, running into a few people as he did so. He wanted to make a dramatic exit, so that his friends could see how pissed he was but being slightly tipsy didn’t help since he just continued to trip until he actually made it to the massive treeline.
“Dude, you are literally swaying. I think you’ve had enough,” Dean commented as Castiel peeked over to him again. Even with the smoke clouding everything around them. The way the kitchen light illuminated over Dean almost made him look bathed in it like some kind of saint.
“She is a lesbian that I met here a few weeks ago,” he said and watched as all of Dean’s grumpiness disappear from his face. “And we’re not friends.” He cocked a brow and Castiel shook his head. “No friends wouldn’t have waited this long to tell each other their names.”
“Yeah well I never thought someone would dry hump me in a library,” he quickly retorted as he stood up for the last time. “But people can be wrong.” Dean laughed and he shook his head.
“We talked about your wrist.” Dean hissed as he quickly changed his face to one filled with anger, if Castiel wanted to get pissy Dean would too.
“I’m not a whore,” Dean hissed and he reached out for Castiel again, which is turn only made the man back away. “Cas I’m not a whore, sure I’ve slept around, but that doesn’t make me a whore.” Castiel rolled his eyes.
“Well, try again,” Castiel said as he placed his mouth guard back into his mouth. He mumbled something, but the mouth guard made it completely inaudible. He bent back down into his stance and Dean followed behind, placing his hands in between Castiel’s legs again. He looked around at the players on the other team. Zachariah, Gabriel, Raphael, Leo, Balthazar, Uriel, and finally Michael. Michael, the one player that made Dean actually quiver with a slight fear, not that he would admit that. He took a deep breath, out of practice and sucked on his bottom lip. Its only the second play Dean, don't let that dude distract you. He swallowed thickly and called out another play, same as before, he was suppose to throw. The angels had a strong defense, but it was more angled toward blocking carriers than tackling catchers. The ball touched his hand and he took his step back. He gripped it tightly, bringing the ball up to his face.
“That should be him now,” he said and grabbed the knob, twisting it and swinging the door open. When his eyes met the beautiful green of Dean’s he felt like he was butter.
“Excuse me,” a voice sounded through the library and Castiel turned around to see no one at first before his eyes moved down to see a kid. Okay, so he might not have been a kid, but he was definitely a few years younger than Castiel. He had bright green eyes and tousled brown hair.
Sam nodded and he took the book from Castiel, holding it close to his chest. “What else?” He asked and Castiel looked back down at the books.
“His name is Ash,” she said with a small smile as they started their normal descent down the semi busy street of where Castiel lived. “He’s really cool, has a mullet and everything.”
“Exactly,” he breathed and nuzzled himself into the crook of Dean’s neck. “Fuck it was amazing.” Dean chuckled as well, shuffling to remove himself from Castiel’s embrace, causing the other to whine low in his throat.
“Yes Dean, believe it or not there are actually people who are better looking than you,” Castiel lied with ease and the Winchester rolled his eyes.
“How much longer you got?” Bartholomew asked Castiel quietly, loading a round into his M79, which Castiel didn’t think he would use, but accepted that anything could happen at this point. Castiel clenched his jaw and looked at Bartholomew for a moment.
They shared a glance from across the room, and his eyes flicked away from Dean when he noticed the man’s smile, small but knowing. As if he had caught Castiel staring. Which Castiel attempted to ignore by looking absolutely anywhere but at those full lips.
"Hey De," Tessa said with a smile as all of them continued to get pure enjoyment from Castiel's face as he continued to sio shyly at his beer. "Meg and I are going to play pong." She pressed a kiss to Dean's lips.
“Is that your practice jersey?” He asked as he looked at Dean while he placed his own shoulder pads in his locker.
“Well if you say used to you must not be a fan either,” he said, making the air in the car that much more tense. Castiel enjoyed rock music, he felt that it was freeing in a sense.
“No we haven’t Cas, not really,” Dean said with a shake of his head. “We’ve talked about school and football, that’s not what we did before.”
“Why the hell can’t you guys make it to a bed?” Charlie asked in a hushed whisper as they browsed books in the library. “I mean, it’s been what? Two months?” She looked at a book and nodded as she pulled it from the shelf. “Yeah, he’s been fucking your brains out for nearly two months and you actually haven’t made it to a bed?” This was a common discussion with Castiel and Charlie. Charlie, even though she would never in her life get it on with a man, had a weird fascination with a man being with a man. Castiel, however, had no interest in learning what her and Gilda did behind closed doors.
“I wish my parents would have even let me have the Hobbit in the house,” he said as he looked at his drink. “I mean I’ve read them several times, but I had to keep them from my parents. They saw magic or aliens as the work of the devil and banished me from it.” Which was true, Castiel had learned to resent his parents because he had loved everything they didn’t. He sipped at his drink and Charlie stood up.
Castiel was sorting through his dirty clothes, deciding between darks and lights, putting his whites in a completely different pile. Then he came across a dark green plaid shirt, and he smiled softly. He brought the shirt to his nose, and sniffed it lightly, getting the rich aroma that was Dean Winchester. He’d stole it on one of their last days together. They were bustling about the break room, grabbing clothes left and right, and Castiel ended up with Dean’s shirt.
“Why,” Castiel started, spitting in an attempt to get the taste of purge from his mouth. “Why are you still talking to me?” He slid a glance over to Dean before remembering what the first thing he saw was when looking over his arm, and went back to looking down.
are. Cry because I will always hate you.” One of my tears fell onto his finger and he licked it with satisfaction. Bringing his lips to my ear he finished spewing his poison into it. “Cry because it makes me happy Dean, it makes me happy to see you express an emotion other than joy.”
Ever since my first day here when he had first tripped and insulted me, he made sure to let all of his followers know that I am their target.
This time he unfortunately was sat next to me since I usually prefer to sit with no people but since Castiel was in this period now there was no other place for him to sit.
The moment I recognized his fancy black car pulling up I then turned my entire body towards the window so I could get a better view of him.
“Now we're talkin.’ Gabe smirked and nudged a grinning Balt next to him. “What do you plan on doing? We want in.”
After my last few classes were over (and thank God they were because everyone was giving me dirty looks) I stood in the parking lot deciding if I should just walk home and screw over Castiel or wait for him to meet up with me.
She had just told me it’s because I'm a little ‘smarty’ and my good grades paid off but I didn’t really know what that meant.
My cheeks reddened when I picked up one of his clean underwear and put them on like lightning speed out of embarrassment. Since Castiel was only a few inches shorter than me most of his clothes fit when I tried them on and I ended up going with the cheapest looking idems so I don’t ruin the nice ones. Though everything here looks expensive.
I mean it wasn’t really surprising that the moment I stepped into those doors my classmates parted for me like the red sea. They’ve been doing that even when I was a kid, and I was glad to see they still know who holds the most power here.
On the way there I overheard Castiel’s sadistic laughter, followed by everyone else in the halls who decided that scene was hilarious.
This time I might finally get to see him talk back to me or get the temper that he hides so well rising from within.
All of a sudden, I was interrupted from my thoughts when I heard my locker slamming in front of me and already I dreaded what was to come.
He instantly caught me staring at him and I noticed him slightly smirk as he and his friends went up to where me and Anna were standing.
“So, how’s my favorite toy been doing?” He mocked, and I hated how much it hurt that he only thought of me as his plaything.
“Perfect,” I said with a smirk. “You guys go in from the back, he needs to think it’s just the two of us. Come to my room and hide under the bed. If he does end up saying it, come out of your spots and scare the shit out of him.”
I feel like what I’ve done so far hasn’t hurt him enough. I want to see the light in those eyes disappear completely. I want to see his smile turn into a permanent frown. I want him broken.
I decided to skip English class and just have Castiel present the assignment on his own. He did the whole thing anyway and that entire assignment was just a reminder of what happened at his house.
The moment Dean Winchester entered my school back then I was faced with his innocent little grin, and it made me so upset that a child could be so happy even though he had absolutely no reason to be.
It’s all a gamble though, if the boy really does love me. I mean I’ve always had a feeling but never wanted to admit it. If
“Y-you’re sick,” I stuttered, not believing he would actually go to such lengths to make sure I wouldn’t have a peaceful school year.
“Dean I’ve told you this before your scholarship the school gave us when you were little is a huge reason why we are keeping you here. Your big brain will get you so far in life just don’t worry about the money and understand your father and I are proud of you.” She said, giving me a serious look.
“He didn’t do anything wrong.” I muttered under my breath, my blood was slowly boiling at the way Castiel treated his employees. He should be grateful he has people to do this for him at all.
“Let’s make up for all that lost time shall we?’ He smirked as Gabriel and Balthazar held both of my arms in place, trapping me.
His petrified emerald eyes wouldn’t leave my relaxed sitting form, and he seemed to be deaf to the teacher calling out his name.
“Pull yourself together Dean,” I said facing the bathroom mirror. All my tears have been cleaned off by now but the humiliation still hasn’t faded away.
“I’ve missed you babe, did you enjoy your trip?” She asked with a hug and I heard my friends chuckling behind her.
“Have I ever told you how much I hate you?” He pushed me onto the bed and trapped me with his arms. “I know I’ve shown you but I don’t think I’ve ever said it straight up to your face.”
“I-I don’t want him to get in trouble and you know why I can’t tell my parents, this school will give me an amazing future they’ll take me out the second they find out I’m being bullied-”
Without meaning to, my eyes suddenly started searching for a certain blue eyed boy to see if he was around anywhere.
“Hey check it out look who’s coming by your locker,” Balt suddenly elbowed me and interrupted my thoughts. I turned my head to see who he was talking about.
By now most of the parking lot was empty and everyone had gone home, so it was only me and Castiel standing here in front of the school.
He only did it to take away one of the biggest things that I never experienced before and even though I knew that, while his sinful lips were on mine I created a pitiful delusion in my head that it was out of love.
“You’re heartless,” I whispered and I already felt defeated even though we haven't even arrived at his house yet.
“All right honey, you just let me know if anyone is bothering you ok?” She said, narrowing her eyes at me.
I couldn’t hold it in any longer and I started to cry, feeling absolutely ashamed with myself that I was infatuated with a boy who only brought misery upon my life.
Since I couldn’t find him anywhere I started to walk home but before I could take another step I was suddenly pulled by a strong force and my back hit a hard chest.
The intoxicating scent was even stronger here and I almost got dizzy washing my hair when I realized this was the smell of Castiel’s shampoo. I breathed into the bottle like the love-struck idiot I am and relished in the fact that I am currently standing in Castiel’s literal shower. This really has to be a dream.
you. I insult you. But don’t misunderstand that for us being friends or something.” I couldn’t look at him when I answered back. I didn’t want him to see my flushed cheeks.
I walked up to my teacher shyly and tugged on her sleeve to get her attention.“U-um excuse me miss where do I sit?’ I asked nervously, everyone in the class stopped talking and they were now staring at me in a judging manner.
“It would have been much better if you were there to entertain me,” he sighed and I suddenly felt his two friends drag my backpack off of my shoulder while throwing it right to Castiel.
“Castiel, may I ask why you’re suddenly in all of my classes now? How did you get a hold of my schedule?” I asked skeptically.
“Because Dean you and I live in two different worlds, and I would never bring myself low enough to be friends with someone like you,” he taunted, and finally let go of me. He then walked away and left me here to drown in my sorrow.
I fell onto my knees in defeat with tears in my eyes threatening to fall but all I could do was watch.
Castiel finally finished changing and came out wearing casual grey sweats and a light blue tee shirt and yet still looked like a runway model. The blue shirt brought out his eyes and I knew I was in trouble the moment he brought those sinful orbs of his towards mine.
“No buts. Come to my car when school ends. You heard the teacher, we both have to help.” He shut down my protests and left the classroom.
Like lightning speed I hid the new bag my momma made me behind my back so Castiel wouldn’t see but it was too late and his stupid friend Gabe yanked it out of my hold.
“P-please stop just stop Castiel!” I yelled while hysterically sobbing. I really am pitiful and he really does hate me, will it ever change?
“DON’T WANT HIM TO GET IN TROUBLE?” She screamed at the top of her lungs and completely ignored my other argument.
“I know Anna I know,” I sobbed and she went quiet on the other line. “ I just can’t help it ok. He’s smart and gorgeous and funny and rich, did I mention gorgeous because maybe I didn’t say that well enough..” I sighed and just decided to stop because I was acting like a fool.
“Dean!” She gave me a hug, “I’ve missed you and omg I’m so happy you finally got a bag for all your supplies it’s about time.” She laughed and ruffled my hair.
My face heated in embarrassment as I finally got off the floor and ran to my desk. I put my head down to hide myself from the handsome but mean boy who humiliated me on my first day here.
And it really doesn’t. If he wants to see every emotion out of me like he says he can easily make me happy without trying. I’m already infatuated so much with him and he doesn’t even see that.
“What do you mean you’re not coming to school today Anna?” I complained on the speaker phone while I was changing.
He got to enjoy himself far too much before Christmas break because we didn’t have any classes together, only lunch but I made sure this time he would get no freedom.
“Woah woah woah slow down how did this happen?” She yelled and I realized I should have given more detail.
“Yeah they wouldn’t have, that’s why I’m so grateful to be here and to get such a good education.” I hate how freely he always talks with me. As if we are friends or something.
“I thought that too at one point but then I realized it’s more satisfying hurting you and taking away from you. So let’s do that now shall we!” Moving away from my ear he brought his face towards mine, his hands were cupping my damp cheeks.
“Then how were you able to transfer into all of my hours?” This didn’t make sense, if he never took my schedule how did he have the power to make sure he attended all of my classes just so he can make me miserable in them.
But there’s something about Castiel that I can’t help but see past all the horrible things he does to me and only sees his good qualities.
“Sure he’s the antagonist, but who said the protagonist was always someone good? They are simply the main character of the book and the antagonist is the one opposing them. Morals have nothing to do with it, but of course you bring that into it.” He rolled his eyes at me.
Pulling my seat closer to them, I covered the side of my mouth with my hand so no one could read my lips. “Well let’s just say this is a bit different than our usual pranks. Pretty much Dean is a fag hiding in the closet and I’m almost positive he has a crush on me. I want to get him to admit it today, then use that against him by telling the whole school.”
“You know, on the ground where your kind belongs,” He said slowly like I was an idiot and cheekily smiled even more as the class bursted into laughter.
As I entered the school halls I tried not to think about last year as I put up a smile and positive attitude.
Even though I try to fight the jealousy it just kept crawling back with every girl he surrounded himself with.
“Mr. Winchester, what did I say last semester about entering class late?” Mrs. Richards asked but Dean wasn’t even paying attention to her.
The biggest reaction of out him so far was that fucking kiss. It was almost as if…… he enjoyed it? With the way he was lying below me, looking like he was in complete bliss…
“By taking away your first kiss of course. What better way to hurt you than to have the person who brings you the most pain steal something so precious.” He smirked and brought his lips even closer, my heart was beating out of my chest and I felt my cheeks heating under his hands.
I couldn’t even deny it because he was absolutely right. Even after everything he did to me if he asked me for anything I’d do it in a heartbeat.
“All I had to do was ask the principal sweetheart.” He whispered to me and I felt his mischievous smile against my ear. “You should know by now I have this whole school wrapped around my finger. Even you.”
“Whichever pair didn’t finish their assignments you need to get those done by tomorrow to present in class,” the teacher explained before we all left. “And I better see equal effort on both ends, if one person does all the work
“Holy shit that's just cruel,” Gabe whistled and shook his head. “Alright me and Balt will record, It’ll be even better to have evidence.”
“Hi I’m Anna,” The girl whispered cautiously. “I’m sorry that happened to you, Cas can be a real jerk sometimes.” She explained while frowning at my sad state.
Castiel opened the container and came close to my face, his lips were barely touching my earlobe as he whispered into it.
The clever things he said in class, the witty responses to his friends' jokes that I overhear, and the way his beautiful blue eyes seem to see through every person he interacts with.
It would always make me feel better and calm me down when I want to lose my temper at their antics. I had always thought to myself he only wanted a reaction out of me.
I didn’t have one last year and had to use my book bag for everything but fortunately she was able to save up money to make me one. We come from a very poor family and I’m surprised that we can even afford to come to this school considering it’s one of the best in the state.
Ugly huh… I suddenly got a flashback of when Castiel smiled sweetly at one of his friends in the halls when they were upset. He had put a hand on their back and rubbed it slowly to comfort them. I remember thinking how incredible it was that he was capable of such kindness and how beautiful he looked at that moment.
“Check it out Cas the loser finally got a bag for all of his shit,” Gabriel snickered and I flitched at the swear word he used. Momma always told me swearing was bad but these kids don’t seem to think so.
“Are you really though?” I gave him a skeptical look. Why the fuck would he be glad his tormentor shares the same class as him?
All those times Castiel and his friends put me down with their vicious words I would tell myself that they don’t mean it.
It’s been a whole year of me attending this prep school and the only friend I’ve made so far was Anna. She’s pretty much the only kind one here in this place full of rich brats and I’m incredibly grateful to have met her.
Back in fourth grade when I ripped his pitiful thing he called a bag I finally got an emotion other than pure happiness out of him, and to my delight he became so sad he even started to cry, which is something he never does in front of me.
“I know we aren’t friends Castiel, trust me I know,” Dean replied with a frown. “But you have no idea how much I would like to be. Even back in third grade the moment I saw you I wanted to be your friend.” He was now standing in front of my seat rather than sitting behind me and I had a full view of his serious face.
I ran up to him to grab my bag back but he threw it to Castiel who caught it swiftly and my heart raced hearing his deep chuckle at my attempts to grab it back.
I thought as I gripped the sheets with anger. And don’t even get started with that wonderful, delicious, dream like, just absolutely magical ki-
“Then here hopefully this will help,” he laughed while smashing the bright red spaghetti all over my white uniform.
Ignoring my mom, I looked at my reflection in the mirror and made sure to style my hair perfectly while buttoning up my white shirt.
“His name is Castiel Novak and he has super rich parents which is why the teacher lets him get away with things like that.” She frowned looking back at the spot where he tripped me.
I was then faced with bright green eyes who looked terrified after making eye contact with me and they quickly looked down while opening the locker right next to mine.
I couldn’t hear her however because I couldn’t stop staring at Castiel. From the moment he came into my line of sight it was like I was put into a spell, and I couldn’t break away from it even if I tried.
“I went to his house for an assignment we had to do together and he was going on about how he wanted to take away all of my first times and he took my first kiss Anna.” I decided not to tell her about the part where I kneeled for him cause I’m pretty sure she would end this call right now.
As I entered the next class feeling anxious to face Castiel again later today, to my utter surprise and disbelief he was in my Pre-Calc period as well.
Shifting in his seat Castiel came closer to me and he had an evil glint to his bright blue eyes as he wrapped an arm around my shoulder in a friendly manner. “No Dean, I have a heart, don't misunderstand. It just doesn’t care for worthless people.” His face was inches away from mine when he spoke that and despite the hurtful words he said them in a sickenly sweet voice.
“You’re lucky you didn’t ditch me because you don’t know the kind of hell I would have planned for you if you made me do the assignment alone,” he threatened while giving me a glare.
“You’re not gonna be grateful for long after I’m done making your life miserable here.” I glared at him with such contempt it almost scared me how much I hate this boy even though he didn’t do anything wrong to me.
Castiel and his two close friends Gabriel and Balthazar had entered the school like they owned the place, and I’m pretty sure at this point they really do.
I don’t know why I even allow her to be near me but when I see Dean’s reaction from the corner of my eye it’s worth it. I’ve never seen the boy make a mean face before but everytime Daphne touches me he sends an ice cold glare at her.
I made sure to tell the principal, who was also a very close friend to my father, that I wanted my schedule to be identical to Deans this semester.
I still haven't filled up the bag with the things yet since it was handmade by my momma so I wanted to do it one at a time when I got to my class.
I haven’t cried in front of him since that day he ripped up the bag mama made for me because I didn’t want to give him the satisfaction. However today is now the second time he got to see my tears, and boy is he satisfied now.
“Wouldn’t you have hell planned for me either way?” I bravely asked, however before he could answer a luxury black car pulled up in front of us interpreting our conversation.
The pancakes fell onto the floor and I had maple syrup all over my hair which was now dripping onto my face.
After finally finishing getting ready, I ran downstairs to be greeted with our chef plating our breakfast on the table, and right next to her was my mom who didn’t look too happy.
One day I had caught Dean eye-fucking me in the gym locker rooms freshman year and at that moment the nickname Dykey Dean was born. It was of course put into great use by pretty much the whole school thanks to yours truly.
Walking into History thankfully on time, I sat on my assigned seat next to Castiel and I was too afraid to even look at him. Unfortunately though I could feel his bright blue eyes on me and I knew that he was upset I ditched the presentation.
“The people you have a seat with here to your right, go ahead and work on the assignment on the board together, make sure it’s done by the end of class.” She said and sat back in her seat.
I hate myself. I hate myself for enjoying such a cruel kiss. Even though it was something I’ve wanted since the day I first laid my eyes on Castiel, the way it came to be made me feel sick.
“You’re coming to my house after school today to help finish this up.” Castiel said to me as I was picking up my backpack.
I felt someone tap my shoulder next to me and I turned to be faced with a girl with red hair looking at me with sympathetic brown eyes.
“I’m sorry Dean I know I’m usually always there for you when you know who shows up but I just got back from Miami today,” She said and I heard a lot of noise in the background.
Speaking of, as I entered the kitchen I was surprised to see her cooking pancakes when I usually just eat an apple for breakfast or some other sort of fruit.
“It’s fine I understand, please you guys should let me know if me going to this prep school is too much of a toll on this family. I can just join Sam in public if it’s needed, and I will be able to see him more often in the morning since he leaves early.” I reasoned, and she sat down next to me as we ate breakfast together.
I’ve never been a fast runner. Usually I would be short of breath very quickly however after what happened at Castiel’s I suddenly became a track star. My heart was racing even when I got home and I immediately ran to my bed to hide under the sheets in shame of what I just did.
A young man dressed in a fancy attire opened the door and then walked around to open the door for Castiel as well.
If my cheeks were red before just from trying on his clothes I had to be a tomato by now because holy crap did he look good. His black wavy hair was even darker and longer because it was wet and it framed his ocean eyes and angelic face. The droplets from his hair were dripping down onto his toned chest and I wanted so badly to lick every drop off his immaculate clear skin and-
“No, I don’t think he's cute, please leave me alone. I’m leaving now momma!” I replied so quickly I couldn’t even register the words that came out of my mouth.
I grabbed my bag and entered into the Rolls-Royce that usually takes me to school and as I sat down I noticed my phone buzzing.
I slammed his locker shut before he could grab his books, almost crushing his fingers in the process.
I didn’t want her to know I was getting bullied at this school after she’s worked so hard for me to get in while making her proud with my grades too.
“Y-you’re… you’re delusional Dean..” I heard Anna whisper and instead of the anger I heard in her voice earlier she now sounds very sad. “He’s sadistic and thrives on your pain, there’s nothing more or less to it. It’s the truth. Unfortunately you are blind to who he actually is
It was finally lunch time but I realized since Anna wasn’t here I was going to be eating lunch all alone today.
Now she knows he exists and even worse she’s probably gonna assume I have a crush on him because of my reaction.
“I’m so sorry sweetie, the new company he’s working at demands a lot of hours and he had to leave early.” She explained while setting down the food on the table.
Thankfully I didn’t let any tears fall while I was in the bathroom, but they still teared up even though I tried so hard to act indifferent to his little outburst in the classroom.
Castiel slammed the door behind him and jumped on his bed to lay down while I stood there awkwardly watching.
His smile faltered for a second when I talked down on his family but he nonetheless blushed even harder and his previous large smile turned into a shy one.
“Cassy!” I suddenly heard someone yell down the hallways and I suppressed a groan as Daphne entered our little circle.
Wearing one of his usual obnoxious smiles he replied to her calmly. “I’m so sorry it won't happen again Mrs. Richards I was just…..” His eyes glanced over to me again and I raised an eyebrow at him as if to say ‘go ahead tell her why’ but he looked down in defeat instead.
I was crying now because of how absolutely right she was. It hurts even more because at the same time she will never understand the way I feel about him or will see him the way I do. Through her eyes Castiel will always be a monster and she has every right to feel that way.
“A-anna,” I said with a shaky voice after she picked up on the second ring. “Do you have time to talk?”
“G-good, how was your winter break Castiel?” I replied politely, while silently cursing myself for always being so nice to him.
They had the whole grade, especially Cas, wrapped around their finger and everyone followed everything they said without hesitation. So of course when they say to make fun of me not a single person will disobey.
“I see you started the assignment, sorry I wasn’t here to help. I can do my part of it now.” My momma always told me never to be rude to people even if they are to you.
Castiel was pinning me against the locker and after finally looking up I saw him smirking down on me, his ocean eyes were sparkling with excitement.
As I sat down at my usual table in the back eating nothing since Castiel threw my lunch on my head this morning, I tried to avoid looking over at his table in the center where all the popular students sat.
The rest of the day went by pretty fast and I decided to not mess with Dean until he came over. If I want him to think I don’t hate him anymore I unfortunately gotta loosen up on the bullying.
After a moment of him relaxing he sat up to look at me from under his long eyelashes and he gestured with his fingers to sit next to him. “Come here,” he said and patted the empty space next to where he was laying down.
“Please, I beg y-you please can I have it back.” I pleaded, feeling ashamed that I had to do this in front of everyone.
And thank God he came because I couldn’t take starting classes right now after dealing with that flea Daphne.
“Why does it have to be sadness though? Why are you always putting me down? The ‘happy’ you see at school from me isn’t real..Don’t you want to be the one who makes it real Castiel? It doesn’t have to be this way.”
thing is though, dean doesn't talk like at all, not to sam, not to his dad, no one, not to teachers, he just can't, he knows he doesn't deserve to be loved, even if he ever meets this guy, he's worthless like his dad never misses a day to remind him
cas watched, and he had to clench tightly to stop himself from releasing his full bladder, hopefully he would have a strong bladder during all of this
sure, dean should be more pissed that his dad was an alcoholic but even then he was always there for dean, his mom was great but she didn’t understand dean she just seemed to be more interested in sam because of course, sam was the good kid and the nerd, the one she could count on
coraline purred at the contact and instantly leaned into his touch “like i said before, my shoulder isn’t a chilling spot” he grabbed her from his shoulder and held her close to his chest and kissed the top of her head “but that’s not gonna stop you, is it?”
dean was lucky he didn’t fully blow his load or this was gonna be over far faster he had liked, cas grunted at the feeling of deans tight heat engulfing him in almost way to smoothly, but he was rewarded with dean clenching around his cock which he knew was due hitting deans prostate
instead he grabs a leather jacket and puts it on, after fixing his eyebrow piercing he walked downstairs after closing his door due to his orders that his cat can’t be walking around the house when he not home but she could when he is
”fine” lucifer pouted, after a bit the wrestling started to get even more aggressive, luckily chuck walked into the room and rolled his eyes pulling them apart from each other, pinching both of their arms
but cas just stared at him for a second then said “i have the stuff for it, i could do it for you if you’d like it”
cas squeaked at the new sensation and squirmed a bit, not much do to the powers holding him still and spread open like he was, he felt dean circle his rim again and cas couldn’t stop his muscles from relaxing a bit under the feelings of the tongue that was licking his most vulnerable spot
dean got used to cas’ size pretty fast and was quickly using that as a go and started putting his hips to work and rocking at a fast pace, and taking some moments to go all the way up on cas’ cock till only the tip was in the slamming back down loving the grunt cas let out every time
“never in a million years, moose” gabe smirked, poking faster now ignoring the ache in his wrist for keeping it up for way too long now
“wait dean..i might be able to help you with sam” cas replied “my family is known for adopting troubled teenagers with bad homes, maybe if you let me tell my parents about what’s happening to you and sam, we can..adopt you guys”
after a couple mouths, he turned 14 then started causing fights at school but he only started them with people who actually deserved to get beat up, like a kid named micheal, dude was a total teachers pet and would steal homework from nerds and get away with it, so dean stepped in and after that him and micheal have been enemy’s since, constantly at each other’s throats
dean quickly locked his lips with the other, benny groaned and put his hands on deans thighs and gripped them, letting dean take control of the kiss for now
give up on you even if it means losing everything” cas said looking into deans eyes to tell him he was being honest
dean watched the ex angel piss on himself, dean slammed harder and the streaks started coming down harder making a loud hissing noise on the angels neck and chest, a puddle slowly made itself known on the sheets
other than his mind, it was the only thing he was listening to other than his mind, he was alone and that's how he always will be
“This is really good, and I like the name. I thought you were just doing that as an album name.” Dean shook his head.
“Well did you guys make up?” Tessa asked as she looked over at Dean. He shrugged his shoulders in a response.
“Jesus,” Castiel whispered somehow in between breaths and kisses. “Bedroom.” He was positive that he had said that. Or at least positive enough that he had attempted to. It was just so difficult to get anything out when all his brain could think about was how good Dean felt against him. They were practically melting into each other at this point. Castiel could feel the edge of his counter digging into his back from being pressed into it so hard, but the things that Dean could do with his tongue made him numb to the pain. That was so dangerous.
“Yeah, its a religious name,” he commented and he smiled as he placed is hands on her hips. Maybe that could get the blood flowing between them, if Dean could mess around with girls and fuck Castiel then he could make the appearance of it. She giggled and wrapped her arms around his neck again.
“I’ll have a rum and coke,” he said and he tugged his bottom lip into his teeth, watching as Green Eyes observed that as well. Maybe getting him wasn’t going to be as hard as he thought. Green Eyes nodded and then moved away from him, going to pour his drink. Castiel having his eyes roam shamelessly over the body in front of him. A few moments later and Green Eyes was setting down a drink, sliding it across for Castiel.
“Are you?” He asked and Castiel nodded himself. Dean smiled and then walked out with the other, pressing against his shoulder every so often. This weekend was going to great, Castiel could feel it. “How did you sleep?” Castiel looked over at Dean and he adjusted his glasses somewhat.
“I’m fine,” Castiel hissed as he looked at Dean with narrow eyes. “Does it look like my spikes have gotten any worse?” Dean clenched his jaw. Castiel was right, no matter if he did continue to nurse it, his spikes were still the same as always. They were good and he was still defending like a natural.
They made their descent back up into the field and Dean couldn’t help but see all of the people gathering themselves back into the stands. He could never get over how the stands looked. All of the people, they were there for the game. They were there to sit, and to watch Dean throw a ball to another person. They observed how Castiel spiked the ball and how Garth would kick a field goal or a point after.
