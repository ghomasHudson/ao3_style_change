here is chapter 3 :)
“It’s been awhile since I haven’t seen that kid.” Bobby adds. “Still a computer nerd?”
“So what’s your story, Dean?” His voice is collected and calm, and it only makes Dean more embarrassed and self-conscious than he already is, because he knows what kind of person Castiel is. He doesn’t need to know more about him to understand. He’s the kind of person who stays composed no matter what the circumstances are, the kind of person who have it all figured out, the epitome of self-confidence and assertiveness. Everything Dean isn’t.
“When you said there were things I needed to fix first in order to be able to- to allow myself to- to feel or whatever.” Dean answers. “Cas you need to know I- I haven’t always been like that. I mean it’s- it’s been a long time since I haven’t- since I haven’t talked about anything too- anything too close to what actually matters.” He marks a pause and looks around him. Castiel’s flat is much more welcoming and warm than his is and he wonders for a second if a flat can actually reflect the person’s soul. It sounds stupid, saying it like that, he thinks, but in that case it’s not far from being the truth. Dean has always been quite pessimistic, grey and dark, just like his flat’s always been. Castiel is more aglow, more beaming, radiating with warmth. That makes Dean think of his mother.
Dean nods to himself and takes a step backwards. He stays still for a few seconds and nods another time before turning around and making his way towards the exit. He puts both of his hands in his coat’s pocket and that’s when he hears him. His voice. Just behind him.
“Why do you bring this shit up now, Cas? You’re
Castiel chuckles and Dean suddenly feels very self-conscious about where the conversation is going. He gulps with difficulty and looks away, suddenly very interested in watching the rain running down his windshield.
“Well if there ain’t nothing to fix, stop acting like someone just died and get a grip on yourself, boy.”
“Sure it is.” Bobby contradicts him. “Listen… Boy. Something obviously happened between you two. You’ve been shutting yourself down ever since you came back from Kansas. And I know what you’re gonna tell me, it’s not my business. And maybe it isn’t, but you’d have to be blind not to see that you and that co-pilot of yours shared something special. So whatever it is, fix it.”
“You were wrong.” Dean knows his reaction is excessive, unreasonable and childish, and Castiel is right. It doesn’t have to be a big deal. There’s nothing wrong about feeling that way towards another man, these things happen and it’s nothing they can’t deal with. He’s being childish and absurd and yet he can’t help himself to be on the defensive.
“Because at the end of the day Sam, he’s still my dad. He’s still our dad.”
Dean watches him as he fiddles with his key and unlocks the door. When he steps inside his flat, he is a bit taken aback by the number of plants in the room. Not an excessive amount, but Dean’s never been the kind of guy to have a weird greenery flat and it actually feels kind of good. There’s a small vestibule where Dean makes sure to take off his shoes and place them next to what seems to be a very old pair of sneakers. He then takes a few steps forward and finds himself in a large living-room with a small kitchen area in the corner. There are several pictures on the fridge and when Dean gets closer, he can recognize Castiel with who seems to be his brothers and sisters judging by the resemblance.
“The mechanic look suits you, by the way.”
A few meters away from him, Dean can see Bobby seemingly busy with a failing alternator and he chuckles lightly when he hears him swear under his breath. Not a day goes by when he doesn’t hear him curse or complain and to be perfectly honest with himself, Dean kind of misses it when Bobby’s not around. He wipes his hands on the rag he placed on his shoulders and his eyes shift from Bobby to Sam. His brother is hunched over the hood of a car and from the way his eyes are squint in concentration, whatever he’s working on seems to give him a run-around. He’s never been an expert in the whole car fixing business but he’s been insisting on giving them a hand during his month off from Stanford university. Dean’s been trying to convince him not to waste his time on them and study for his exams instead but his little brother is too stubborn for his own good.
“You got it, Sammy.” He wipes his oily hands on his ripped jeans and takes the work’s cellphone in his hand. He types the number and presses the call button.
Castiel must feel his longing because he’s kissing him with more vigor now and his thumb strokes his cheeks gently while the rest of his fingers brush his hair slowly. “Cas” Dean whispers against his lips and lays down on the couch when Castiel’s hand pushes him backwards. It’s not only their lips that are touching now, it’s their torso, their legs, their whole bodies and when Castiel’s lips are pressed against his jaw and then his neck, Dean loses his breath. He throws his head back to give him more access and lets his own hands slide under his tee-shirt, smiling when the co-pilot shivers at the touch. And Dean thinks he’s all for it but then Castiel’s hands ventures a bit further down, everything is suddenly too overwhelming for him to handle and his whole body tenses.
For a few seconds, neither of them say anything. Dean doesn’t know what to say, he doesn’t even know why these words came out of his mouth in the first place, and Castiel is so deep in thought he probably wouldn’t notice if the building suddenly caught on fire. But then Dean can feel a hand on his knee and his whole body tenses and freezes. A wave of panic sweeps over him until Castiel lifts his hand from his knee and puts it back on his own thigh, and Dean wants to say something but the words get stuck in his throat once again.
Dean hangs up.
“Look I’m not gonna ask you to tell me what’s on your mind cause I’m not your freaking caretaker boy but next time Sam calls ya, please answer I can’t take his whining anymore.”
“Dean?” Castiel asks, confused. “What’s up?” His tone is detached and all the words Dean have been meaning to say suddenly disappear into thin air.
“You should let him in, boy.” Bobby agrees. “It’s obvious you like him too. All the things your dad taught you about ‘being a man’ and all? You can let that shit go.”
“Well I- uh- I was at my brother’s graduation in Stanford and- well we- we talked. About you. Me and Sam I mean. He’s the one who pushed me to take that plane.” The words come out of Dean’s mouth all wrong and it doesn’t matter how much of a speech he planned during the forty-five minutes of anxious waiting before, there’s absolutely nothing that makes sense in his brain at the moment. Nothing. His hand comes to land on the table and it squeezes the edge with a desperate grip. “Cas you know I’m not good with words. And with… Well. Feelings in general.”
“Dean. I said I was thrilled.” Castiel says. “But you’re sure you’re okay? You seem tense. What was the thing you wanted to talk to me about?”
“Are we talking about Dean’s boyfriend?” Eileen adds and signs at the same time.
“Hey boy.” He says. It takes Dean a while to realize he’s been called and he slowly raises his head, an inquisitorial look on his face. “You doing okay over there? You should take a break, you’ve been working your ass off since this morning.”
“You did help.” Dean manages to articulate through gritted teeth. “You did. A lot more than you think.” He adds. “He’s the reason I’m so messed up in the head, isn’t he?” Dean admits, not being able to stop the tears from rolling down his cheeks.
?” Dean repeats, ironically. “Cas I- I’m just not- I’m not gay.”
“Alright. I’m sorry, then.” Castiel says and Dean watches him as he gathers his possessions. “You take care, Dean. I mean it.”
“I don’t know.” He admits. “I mean I don’t even get you most of the time.”
“You’re a weird guy, that’s all.” He says, smiling down at his hands.
“I just want to see you.” Dean eventually says like it’s the most obvious thing in the world. “Because every time I’m with you I feel- I feel warm and I- I wish I could just- I mean ever since you told me you lo- Ever since that afternoon, there’ve been so many things in my head all the damn time Cas. But I don’t know what to- I don’t know what to make of them and then my head keeps spinning and I feel like I’m drowning and I just- I can’t take it anymore, Cas.” His voice wavers and Dean is surprised to feel some tears rolling down his cheeks. He wipes them with the back of his hand and sniffs quietly. There’s a silence on the other side of the line and Dean is terrified.
“Stop being a dumbass.” Castiel says, smiling. “I just think it will be easier for you to make sense of everything going on in your head if you’re alone for a while. I know how hard it can be, Dean and maybe the reason why it’s so difficult for you to understand how you feel is because there’s other things that need to be resolved first.”
“One day at a time” Dean answers, smiling softly when Castiel takes his hand in his and squeezes his fingers.
“Yeah, no worries, man.”
“Yeah right.” He only says, lowering his eyes.
“Yeah.” Dean whispers, his voice barely audible. “Yes.” He repeats more clearly, letting his chin fall on Castiel’s shoulder. “Can you- can you hold me?” He dares saying after a few seconds. “Please. It’s been a- a long time since I-” But he doesn’t finish his sentence because he can feel two strong arms wrapping themselves around his back and his face is buried in Castiel’s neck and the next thing he knows he’s breaking down in tears, his body shaking and his hands gripping his white shirt so hard on Castiel’s back his knuckles go white. He doesn’t remember the last time someone hugged him, the only thing he knows is that he feels warm and there’s an intensity to it that makes his whole body tingle with excitement and comfort. And he never wants it to stop.
“I’m sorry.” All is forgotten when the co-pilot runs his right hand through his hair and Dean cannot help himself but to close his eyes and enjoy the new feeling. He opens them again when Castiel’s warm mouth is being pressed against his lips another time. The kiss is slower this time, more gentle, and when Dean’s own hands make their way behind Castiel’s neck and pulls at his hair, it’s now his turn to groan against his lips, but Dean doesn’t smile. It only makes him want to feel him closer and his right hand moves from his neck to that washed-out shirt and holds it tightly, clinging on it.
“There’s nothing for you to be sorry for.” Castiel says. “You take care of yourself, alright? I’m sorry I’ve been distant lately, you can call me anytime and I’ll answer. But keep in mind what I said, and take it slow, alright? I know you. Don’t work yourself to death.”
With that, they turn and head back into their room. Dean calls them an asshole as they go.
“Sure you’re not,” Chuck and Jo say at the same time, and it sounds rehearsed, something you say to appease a child. Cas is sick of feeling like a child today.
Sam finds him a couple of hours later, still sitting against the wall, staring straight ahead.
Not that he’ll ever admit it out loud.
Dean watches him, eyes tracking his every step as he walks around the hood to get to the passenger side. He slides into the warm car as gracefully as possible, immediately leaning against the closed door and pressing his forehead to the unyielding glass of the window. They sit in the parking lot in silence for what could be an hour or no more than a minute, Cas has no idea. Dean’s gaze rests on him the entire time. Then, a deep breath and the sound of the car shifting gears. The road rumbles clumsily beneath them as they begin to drive.
“If you tell me,” they say, “and it’s a good reason, I’ll stop coming.”
“Go,” they tell him. He scampers out of the room, giving Dean as wide a berth as possible on his way through the curtain. Dean is still standing stock still, blinking at them.
They make their legs move, following him to the car. Daniel, a middle aged man who handles a machine gun like a beauty and usually rides with Dean when Cas isn’t there, hovers questioningly as the pair gets silently into the car.
“We do,” Cas answers without hesitation.
“No,” Cas mutters. “No, what were you going to tell me?”
“He’s here?”
It’s going to take awhile to get accustomed to living without a constant state of warfare. Even in the short time Dean had had between Chuck losing his power and a friggin’ giant ass nail getting the best of him, they’d been hunting.
“What?” Dean drops the act, feeling defensive.
“Me too.”
That scares the shit out of him. Another weakness. But isn’t Cas already his weakness? Whether they label it or not? Doesn’t everyone already seem to assume—to know? Why deny himself this one happy thing?
“It’s not mine to tell.”
Castiel glances at Cas, expecting him to look surprised at Dean’s easy trust. He doesn’t even blink.
“Alright.” Castiel marks the papers and turns the page. “He… what about this?” Dean leans over his shoulder, pretending not to notice just how close they are. He reaches over and runs his finger down the list, answering each as he goes.
“You really think I’ll walk in there and shoot Sammy in the head? No hesitation?” Dean asks. For once, he is completely still, blinking at the ceiling.
“You’ve pushed it enough today, Cas. If he asked you not to come, I’m sure it’s for a good reason,” she tells them. They slump back in their seat.  “Besides, this raid sounded like some serious shit. We all need to be completely dialed in, not watching Dean to see if he’ll explode on you.”
The people in the crowd on the TV look just like their small room. Some are dancing and kissing and shouting and hugging, others are getting jostled around as they stare at the courthouse, smiling with tears streaming.
“Why aren’t you focused when I’m there?” Cas asks, quieter now. They can have a conversation. It doesn’t have to be an argument every time.
“No?”
“Sorry,” Dean mutters, watching the rearview mirror again. Cas doesn’t say anything as he reaches for the radio. “Did I lose anybody? Over.”
“We better not see him for a long time,” Dean says, his throat tight.
“Do you really think I deserve to be here?”
He should drive slow, take it easy for his first experience in Heaven. Take in the landmarks, the beautiful view. He presses his foot all the way down and the car doesn’t groan and lurch like it would on Earth, it just shoots off in the direction Bobby pointed him.
Jo and Chuck exchange a look, but Cas stretches their legs out and settles into the seat, setting his gaze on the road. Behind them, people are starting up their engines and calling for Chuck to get moving.
“Very puffy,” Cas replies. If he can hear a change in Dean he doesn’t mention it, but the air is definitely thicker than it had been. “I should go. Thank you for… attempting to apologize. Goodnight, Dean.”
Dean is looking at him then, with a glint of mischief in his eyes, and Cas sets a hand on his chest to steady them both.
“That’s another thing,” Dean says, shifting roughly into drive and pulling back onto the road, eyes on the rearview mirror to make sure everyone else follows. “You
There’s panic there, and guilt, and something else Dean doesn’t recognize.
“Can’t,” Dean reminds him, gesturing at his broken right arm. He taps his foot a couple of times and looks back up at Sam. They don’t talk about it. They’ve been doing a great job not talking about it. Damn it. “No, Sam. I’m not on any medication right now.”
The nail of his thumb secures its spot under the cap. If he presses up at the right angle, with just enough pressure, it will pop off. He stares at it. Marvels at how it feels both foreign and all too familiar in his hand. He’s had a couple since his recovery, one wouldn’t hurt.
Castiel feels sick. How far he has fallen...This is beyond defiance of unjust orders, this is sacrilege. He searches wildly for a change in subject.
“I did.” He looks up at Cas through his eyelashes, an open gaze that takes Cas apart from the inside. “I gotta be honest, I just needed to hear your voice. So I’d call and let it ring out to hear your outgoing voicemail message. I missed ya, buddy, for real.” Buddy. The word sticks and makes something in Cas tick in annoyance.
“Don’t be. I wasn’t cut out for apple pie anyway.” Dean shrugs, but an ugly feeling rises in his gut. He’d been excited about that job interview.
“No, I’m not--can you just come get me? Please?” He feels incredibly small. If he leans back a little, the wind blows against him so violently that he can pretend he’s flying again. “I’m at the Gas-N-Sip.”
“Listen, smartass, it’s a figure of speech.” Cas smiles a little at that, his chest giving a feeble kick. Now that is disconcerting. His heart likes to do gymnastics all day-especially when he’s with Dean-when he’s least expecting it, and it’s beyond bothersome. “Listen, why don’t you come in for a while? I’ll fix you something to eat if you’re hungry and I’ll tell you some of the stuff I do to ground myself. It’s different for everybody, but at least next time you’ll have some things to try out.”
“Cas,” Dean starts, and they can tell by his tone that this conversation isn’t ending with an explanation.
Dean’s heart plummets. His grip slackens on Castiel’s hand, but the angel holds tight.
“Dean, are you sure that’s a good idea? He didn’t seem like your biggest fan--”
“It’s dangerous,” he says finally.
When Cas steps out of the shower Dean is laying on his stomach, head turned to the side so he can stare out the window. He doesn’t react at first to the dip in the bed as Cas lays down, but then there’s a restless sigh and the springs squeak as Cas rolls over.
“Hello, Dean.” Cas releases him and surveys him closely. “I didn’t expect to see you so soon.” When Dean frowns, confused, Cas continues, “I figured you would visit your parents. Or Jo and Ellen.”
“No,” Castiel says. For a moment, Dean forgets that he asked a question. Castiel’s blue, blue eyes are distracting as hell and the way that they look unhesitatingly into his own makes Dean worried about what he might find there. He looks down.
once, twice, and a third time.
“Are you okay?” he asks, voice hard. Cas stares at him. “Your grace was…” he breaks off, waving a hesitant hand.
The response is immediate this time.
He spots the dock and the figure sitting on the lawn chair in the middle of it and comes to a screeching stop that should make his neck hurt. It doesn’t. Heaven rocks. He stumbles out of the car and starts to lock the door before realizing that there’s no need to do so anymore.
Cas moves the curtains from their window, which is so grimy it barely makes a difference, and watches Dean’s car pull away. At the back of the line, people are still packing extra weaponry and bandages. Cas weighs their gun in their hand for a moment.
“With me,” Dean replies, walking right past them toward his car at the front of the pack. When they don’t follow, besides whirling to watch him pass, he turns, eyes flashing and expression severe. “
“Home?” Cas echoes. She shrugs.
When they stumble back to Dean’s place, he kisses them against the door and they let themself pretend that they’re just two people. That they’ve always been human and nothing more. Maybe they met Dean in a coffee shop, or in a classroom, or they’ve known each other their whole lives. It doesn’t matter. Nothing matters because Cas is kissing this guy with pretty green eyes and they’re not going to die soon. Nobody is going to die soon.
It’s been over a year since Benny died. Over a year since his first relapse. He takes a shaky breath and begins the walk back to his room.
But Cas can’t bring himself to look at him now, so he has no idea what that small ‘oh’ means.
“Well, Cas helped.”
“Hello,” Castiel responds, a small smile gracing his lips. The smile only grows when Dean can’t help but return it. “My apologies for startling you. I just overheard, and--”
“Not that he’ll ever admit it out loud.”
“...maybe I should’ve told you…”
This is when they will forgive and ask for forgiveness. This is penance and exoneration. It’s I’m sorry for everything and it’s me too. It’s the closest thing they have left to grace. Maybe they have had this grace the whole time, and they were both too angry to see it. It doesn’t matter anymore.
“It’s the end times, honey. We’re all screwed.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You had half a hit, Dean. And you’re not going to get a contact high—”
“Does he know?” Their voice shakes at the idea.
Dean huffs but doesn’t respond, just looks out over the water. It makes sense, he decides, that this is Heaven. Looking out over a body of water with Cas sitting next to him, their hands linked between them and the sun shining just right so that there’s no glare in his eyes.
The phone stops ringing. He hears Cas utter a greeting. He really wants a drink.
“Shut up.” Dean sits on the edge of the table, twisting his engagement ring around and around his finger. Cas doesn’t think much of it; Dean has been a nervous bundle of energy ever since the proposal. Even though the extent of their wedding planning was deciding a day that they should go to the courthouse and sign the papers, Dean has become a bit of a bridezilla (but Cas learned the hard way that he does not find it humorous when that is pointed out to him.)
Cas huffs, the crease on his forehead deepening. Dean smiles reassuringly, reaching up to hold Castiel’s chin between his thumb and forefinger.
“I dunno, Cas, it’s different without you. It’s like, at first everything was bearable, because at least we still had each other, y’know?”
“No,” Dean mutters, his eyes opening slowly. He blinks in the stale light of the Emergency Room and scratches his leg absentmindedly. Cas is holding the papers out to him and there’s a small smile on his face. A kind smile that makes his eyes crinkle up at the edges and warms Dean from the inside out. Dean takes the papers in his good hand and returns the smile.
She lunges for them. They pull the trigger. She drops to the ground immediately, unmoving body looking distinctly human. They turn around and get back into the car in silence. Dean opens his eyes as Cas holds the gun out to him, and he takes it without looking at them.
“For how long?” Dean’s voice is measured. That’s not usually a good thing. Cas cringes, briefly considering flying to Canada and not returning. Maybe he’ll change his name to Geoff and make a living in ice fishing.
“I’ve disappointed him too. So does Jack, so did mom. Just like he has disappointed you, and me, and Jack, and mom.”
“You’re not coming. And that’s final.”
“No,” Dean tells him. “Friends don’t do this.” Cas shivers, and Dean stops moving his hands.

“The vampire called you my boyfriend,” Cas says softly. When his breath spills over Dean’s cheeks, it smells clean. Minty. Familiar. Dean has tasted that before. He fights the urge to lean forward and kiss the apprehension off of Castiel’s face.
“It’s dangerous to take you with us,” Dean snaps, louder than he’s been all morning. Cas sways a little and tries to determine his tone. Angry? Maybe. Probably. “I can’t—I have to focus when I’m out there, okay? I can't do that when you’re there.”
“What was that?” they ask, craning their neck. They can’t see over the rest of the cars. Nobody says anything. “What the hell was that?”
Cas tries to bring himself back down to reality, to celebrate this moment with his boyfriend and his best friend, but he can’t. His joy has faded to sour vindictiveness, thinking about every stranger that has glared at them in the street, of family members who would never be invited to the wedding but wouldn’t come even if they were. Then even that fades to triumph. They can get married whenever the hell they want. Just like anybody else.
“You’re threatening me right now?” Chuck says, looking more hurt than scared. Cas feels a little bad. They like Chuck, for the most part. He’s harmless, if not a little doofy.
“Nah.” Dean sets the bottle to the side and glances at the Impala, sitting on the road in front of him. “I’m gonna go for a drive.” He stands, somehow knowing that the keys are sitting in the ignition, waiting for him.
“As friends,” Cas says finally. Dean fights the urge to roll his eyes, even though Cas wouldn’t see him if he did. If he has to be a friend, he’ll be a friend. It’s better than being nobody.
“I thought maybe you would want to unwind after Winchester undoubtedly tore into you the whole way home,” he says, smiling like he’s been considerate by letting himself in and offering to rescue them. From
“You’re right. I figure I’ll be coming for you any minute anyway.”
“I can’t fuckin’ say it,” he snaps. “I don’t know why—because I do. I do feel the same. And now you’re gone and I never got to tell you that I love you too.”
After a quiet moment where Cas skims his thumb gently across Dean’s hand, he sighs.
“Our grace failed. Dean did everything he could, but he had so much more going on, what with Sam being Lucifer’s meatsuit and all. We told him to drop it. That’s right about when we broke our leg.”
Jack stands just behind Sam, wide eyes sweeping the room and landing on the red handprint on Dean’s shoulder. Dean doesn’t stand up, just lifts his gaze to his brother and shakes his head.
If you’re too high to manage to light up again, you’re too high. That’s what Dean told them once, when he found them mindlessly flicking their lighter, not even sure what they’d wanted it for in the first place anymore. Now they heed that advice, not because they give a shit, but because watching their hands shake and fumble still makes Cas taste acid and see red.
“What are you doing in here?” they ask tiredly, barely sparing the man a glance before turning their back on him and taking a long hit. They’d hoped that the question would be an obvious dismissal, but when they turn around and let the smoke out of their mouth, he’s smiling lazily at them, stretching out like he owns the place. He’s definitely been invited in more than once, Cas can remember that much, but not enough for him to think that
Cas hangs up the phone and tosses it on the bed, not taking his eyes off of Dean. His hair is messy; Dean did that. Dean’s hand pushed through the unruly black curls and Dean’s fingers untucked Castiel’s shirt. It’s too much. He turns on his heel and shoves his way out the door.
“As close acquaintances,” Dean corrects him. Cas laughs again, and Dean closes his eyes, savoring the moment. Pretending he’s there next to him.
“I’m going out,” Dean says after a long moment where he just glares at them. Cas blinks,
They’ve always been Cas and Dean. They never needed to talk about it. They still don’t. It’s the end of the world, anyway, they’re just passing the time. Each moment that passes is borrowed, there’s no reason to make things difficult by talking too much. They never thought about it before, besides a few moments of weakness, when one of them has one drink too many, and the other pretends they don’t remember it in the morning.
“...one of the biggest civil rights rulings in its history, the Supreme Court has found same-sex marriage to be a constitutional right.”
“Why’d you bail on Dean?” How could you possibly bail on someone who loves you that much? Dean tries to stop him, tries to defend the angel, but Cas just gives him a guilt stricken look. Benny’s own rage in his friend's defense distracts him from the conversation until Dean raises his voice.
“If you knew, why did you wait to tell me until we were out of time, Cas? We could’ve—could’ve been together before you died,” Dean chokes on the last word. Cas shakes his head.
“It embarrasses him when I outperform him in the field,” Cas jokes instead of answering her question, turning to look out the window. She chuckles, spinning her shotgun again. “Did you put the safety back on that thing?” they ask, eyeing her sideways.
“Dean,” he says quietly, his voice sounding about as small as he feels. Dean doesn’t hear him at first, laughing loudly at something Charlie says before elbowing her in the gut. “Dean,” he repeats himself, louder, and catches Dean’s attention.
“Nothing,” Dean says after a moment where he seems to make a decision. “Nothing. Sorry. I didn’t think--”
Sam stands eventually and begins to tidy a few things up in the room.
“Couple months,” he mutters, his gut wrenching with the confession. Whereas his face feels like it’s on fire, his stomach feels like ice. He’s overwhelmed with emotions that he doesn’t recognize at all, which frustrates him. Frustration. He knows that one pretty well too. “Before you proposed.”
“Well, that’s enough cause for a riot.” Dean sighs something that sounds like ‘hmphglr.’ Castiel shifts uneasily at the hand that Cas leaves on Dean’s arm. Dean doesn’t shrug him off.
“Aw, hey baby,” he mutters as she roars to life. “Let’s go see Cas.” The car shifts into gear and revs like she‘s as excited as Dean.
“Well, good morning.” Dean gives him a winning smile. If Benny hadn’t heard Dean crying and begging Cas to show up, he wouldn’t have ever guessed that Dean has anything on his mind.
“Um…probably before the end of the world started?” she guesses. Cas tilts his head. “Okay. For real? I dunno. Definitely before you guys found me. If you haven’t noticed, there’s not much room for fun at home.”
“He’s not going without me,” Cas snaps in reply. Still, no movement. Finally, Cas scowls and pulls their gun from their pocket. Chuck’s eyebrows shoot up. “I can drive too, you know. Whose life do you think means more to me? His or yours?”
“This is stupid. I don’t even need to be here. It’s just a sore arm. My little brother made me come,” he explains. Castiel doesn’t look convinced. He sets the papers on the empty chair next to him and turns towards Dean completely.
“Can you come pick me up?” His voice sounds incredibly small. He closes his eyes against another cold rush of wind.
“You don’t think so?” he asks. Cas stares at both of them, dumbfounded.
“Get out.”
Before Castiel can object, he feels his feet start to lose the ground beneath him.

“...won’t work again. I tried turning it off and back on again. I just want to watch the damn game.” Cas turns his head, and god, his chest restricts. Dean’s soul is so bright, so beautiful and just the way Cas rebuilt it, over a decade ago. His grace fizzles out and he’s looking at just Dean again. Just as beautiful, but different.
“Way to go, Sammy,” he mutters. He glances around the room, the older brother in him searching for anything else that might need fixing. Sam is annoyingly organized, his boots sitting in the corner by the door. His jacket is hanging up on the door of his closet, and the only thing out of place is a sock. Dean kicks it under the bed, flicks the TV off, and creeps back out of the room.
“I prayed to you, Cas, every night,” Dean is saying. Benny stops himself from adding ‘and some mornings, too.’
“Bullshit, that’s all?” Castiel flips over the papers to find that he only has one page left.
That decides it, then. They grab a water bottle from their bedside table and stuff their gun in the back pocket of their jeans before jogging out to the road. Chuck is just swinging himself up into the driver's seat of the car, Jo Harvelle in the passenger seat, squinting into the sun and shifting her shotgun from side to side.
“It was nothin’. His boyfriends a dick and I stepped over the line by telling him that.” He shrugs, as though he couldn’t care less about the look on Castiel’s face as he walked out the door. Because he doesn’t. He doesn’t care. He doesn’t. “He got his panties in a twist about it, I guess.”
“I’ll see you around, kid.”
“How is he? Is he okay?”
“Even if I am,” Cas says, pulling back the hammer, “I’m not known for my steady hands. Would be a shame if something slipped.”
“What about Dean?” Cas meets his gaze evenly.
“Ow--what the hell, Sammy?” Dean rips his attention away from Castiel’s broody companion, glaring at his little brother.
“Boyfriend. He got into a fight at a bar,” he sighs. Okay, so he likes boys. But he’s got a boyfriend. But Dean doesn’t care anyway. He doesn’t. This guy is just a pretty stranger, and thinking that he is anything more than that would be stupid. Dean makes an impressed noise from the back of his throat. Bar fights are much more his speed.
Dean picks up on the second ring.
For a blissful second, they’re not in a sorry excuse for a home, but they’re in the kitchen at Bobby’s. They’re in South Dakota, and Dean is drinking a beer with one hand, rubbing his neck awkwardly with the other. Dean is still kind. Rash, but soft spoken when he can afford it. His little brother is only a room over, and he’s not a meatsuit for the devil. Cas looks away from him. Suddenly, they need something stronger than weed.
“Jackass,” he mutters. “That’s not what I was asking.”
“I love him.”
“Pardon?”
“Who does this?” He sounds genuinely curious. Dean presses the tiniest bit closer to him.
,” Cas half-growls, grabbing their joint in one hand and the collar of his shirt in the other, dragging him out of the bed and onto his feet. They use their grip on him to back him up against the far wall, his eyes wide, and get right up in his face. “Don’t ever assume that I want you to--”
“Did you?” Chuck asks wearily from the driver's seat. She must answer nonverbally, because Cas doesn’t hear what she says.
Sam. Dean feels his eyes widen and his stomach twist.
Eileen
“Request denied. Over and out.”
“You gonna get me killed looking for that son of a bitch, Winchester?” Dean’s jaw tightens. “Maybe he don’t wanna be found, you ever think about that?”
She shocks a smile out of them, but the sound of a gunshot from the front of the line snaps them back into real life.
“You knew and you didn’t tell him?”
tw // depiction of dangerous drug abuse
“You were dead!”
The longer they sit there, the more the constant restlessness in Dean grows. The hunter in him insists that they’ve been static for too long, but every time he shifts and glances around, Cas soothes him back down.
“Castiel,” Cas calls. “It took me five years to tell him. Do better.”
“I guess Benny--I told you about Benny the other night, the vamp--he makes it better sometimes. At least I’m not sitting here on my own, goin’ crazy, right? And I think I can trust him. I think he can actually get us out of here. So, you gotta come back Cas, okay? You just--” Dean’s voice breaks and Benny feels bad for listening now, as though he’s cracked opened Dean’s diary. He can’t bring himself to stop, though. He’s never seen Dean vulnerable like this. “I need you to come back. ‘Cause you’re comin’ with, or I’m not leaving. I’m not leaving you here, man.”
“I know.”
the first time that he has sought them out just to tell them that they cannot come.
“I came to tell you I’m leaving. In case you went looking for me.” There’s an implication there that Cas wants to deny, that they want to mock. But they know they can’t. “I’ll be back later,” Dean tells them when they still don’t say anything.
“I didn’t
“This is easily one of the worst apologies I’ve ever heard in my life,” Castiel informs him. Dean laughs, the anxious knot in his stomach loosening slightly at the easiness in Castiel’s voice. “It’s okay. You didn’t mean to overstep. We were doing some pretty serious sharing for a while there, anyway. It got hard to remember that we’re just strangers.” Ouch.
Behind the group lies what used to be a small town. Now, it’s dust. Smoldering, burning piles of ash.
“You left me a voicemail,” he says, keeping his voice as flat as he can. His breath catches, but Dean seems to be too busy surveying the ceiling to notice.
“Hey, Cas? Did--oh.” He stays awkwardly in the middle of the bead curtains, like he can’t decide whether to flee or not. Cas wants to drop out of existence more in that moment than they ever have before.
“Cas is gone.”
“Do you want to maybe go out for a bite sometime?” He holds his breath, his whole body tense, braced for an answer that doesn’t come. For a moment, Dean wonders if Cas hung up. He glances at his screen, and it says the call is active, so he brings it back to his face. This is torture. Total torture. Why is he just sitting there? Is he considering it? Or just trying to think of the easiest way to let Dean down?
“Hannah, hey,” Cas says, pacing back and forth in front of Dean, the napkin still clutched in his hand. Dean sighs, taking another bite of his burger. They had definitely been about to kiss, he’s experienced enough to recognize the vibe when it’s right in front of him. “I’m not sure. He’s been in there forever now, so I think he might be getting stitches.”
“Cas?” Dean prompts. He still looks like a soldier, standing with his chin high and with people patting his tensed shoulders as they pass, telling him he did good today. Cas aches to just see
LOL. Goodnight.
“Leave it alone,” Mark snaps loudly. Dean raises an unimpressed eyebrow right as Castiel glances around the emergency room, probably embarrassed. They make eye contact, and Castiel stares at back at him. Dean prides himself on not being bashful in the least, but the weight of Castiel’s shockingly blue gaze makes the back of his neck hot. The guy is staring at him, completely unashamed. He doesn’t look angry that Dean has clearly been eavesdropping, just curious. Dean rubs at his neck and looks down, unable to hold eye contact any longer.
Even alone in an empty room, with nothing left to lose, his throat constricts over the words as they try to claw their way out.
After that, they really do shower. The world is soft again, their shampoo feels funny in their hair and they take their time massaging it into their scalp before rinsing it out. They skip the conditioner. It’s slowly growing harder to find more and they don’t want to waste it. Dean doesn’t have any in his own shower, and they’ve noticed the careful way he applies it when they’re crowded in Castiel’s shower together. They need it less than him anyway.
“Yes,” Cas tells him hesitantly.
“I know,” Cas tells him, gentle again. Dean lifts his gaze. “I know, Dean.” Dean frowns at him.
“Dammit, Cas, I said turn it off.” Dean reaches for the phone and Cas doesn’t stop him from shutting it off. The voicemail cuts off. “What the hell, man?”
Still, they’re high. Too high to participate in an active raid. But if something goes wrong, they should be there to help, right? They can just ride in the back of Chuck’s car. He’s no snitch. Dean will never know they were there.
“What was that?” Cas laughs, a hand coming up to cover his mouth. Dean doesn’t know what to say, instead, he gives in to the laugh that is rising in his own throat. They sit there for a while, laughing together. They draw some attention to themselves from the other people in the room, but they don’t care. In fact, Dean has completely forgotten that there are other people around at all. There’s no telling how long they would’ve sat there, slapping their knees and gasping for breath, because Sam appears in front of them, looking thoroughly nonplussed. Dean wipes at his eyes and takes a few steadying breaths, a couple of final chuckles forcing their way out of him as he looks at his little brother.
They’re far too close to be appropriate, Dean can feel Castiel’s breath on his face, but neither of them move back. Castiel’s eyes search his face for a moment and Dean feels himself go red. Mercifully, Cas doesn’t repeat the question or make him answer, he just checks the ‘yes’ box and moves down the list. Dean blows out a shaky breath and sits back in his chair, eyes falling shut.
“He didn’t want you to come.”
After a few minutes of driving in silence, Jo turns around as though to size them up. They really like her. She reminds them of Dean when they first met him.
“And-and he lets us stay? Even though we’re useless?”
“Cas?”
“You’re dressed like a hobo. Are you wearing that to the courthouse?”
Dean waits for him to nod before getting out of the car and slapping the roof a couple of times. Cas joins him and looks at him questioningly.
“Delta 7,” Dean snaps over the radio, “get your shit together and get moving, or get the fuck out of the way. We’re on a schedule here. Over.”
“Of course,” they whisper back. Then, slowly, they reach for the radio. Dean does nothing to stop them. “Sorry for the abrupt stop,” they say, closing their eyes and forcing their voice back into the vaguely amused tone they all will recognize. “There was a Croat in the road. Pass with care, she’s on the right side of the lane. Over and out.”
“...total asshole. I don’t know what’s gotten into him.” Cas pauses, clearly listening to something being said on the other side of the line. “No, he isn’t always like this. Hannah—no. You don’t know him.”
“Tough shit,” Dean mutters, not feeling bad at all. All he cares about is getting home, getting in bed, and pretending he never met a very pretty man with very blue eyes.
“We’re not friends,” Dean breathes. Castiel’s breath stutters.
“Just for the record,” Sam says, his hand still resting on Castiel’s arm, “I think you’d be surprised by his response, if you ever decide to tell him.”
“I told you to stay back,” Dean reminds him, voice still strangely level. “I told you that I cannot focus when I know that you—” he breaks off, closing his eyes. His grip on the wheel turns his knuckles white, even though they haven’t started driving yet. “Were you trying to get everybody killed?”
“Hang on,” Cas objects. “What do you mean I can get away with more?”
“Ground?”
“Dean,” Bobby calls out. He turns back to him. “He likes to sit on the dock, when he’s got time. If you want to find him, that’s where he’ll be. It’s right down that way.” Dean follows the direction that Bobby is pointing and then nods gratefully
“You call this peace?” Dean asks, eyes flashing dangerously as he gestures at the ruined joint. Cas guesses that if they could smell it anymore, it would reek. “This isn’t peace, Cas. It’s sedation.”
“Castiel,” Dean says softly, in that way that tears Cas apart from the inside out. At first he hated himself for it. And then he hated Dean for it. Now, when he knows how rarely Dean is as gentle as he can be with Cas, it makes him want to cry. He looks up at him.
Sam is pulling Dean’s pillow back, presumably looking for a gun or a blade. But in the days leading up to Dean’s death, he didn't need one. Instead, Sam finds a slightly crumpled picture. Dean averts his gaze from the water.
They sit up, setting their beer down and tracking his movement toward the fridge. He feels how he feels every time Dean pops up on him without warning, like he’s lost his breath. But he’s an angel, he’s been alive for a millennia and he doesn’t need to breathe. Dean grabs a beer and the box of leftover pizza before disappearing again. Cas deflates.
For a long time, Dean stares at their gun and doesn’t say anything. He still has the ammo in his other hand.
“It never quite healed up right. Dean introduced us to the wonders of painkillers, and that’s when we realized that drugs work to dampen humanity as much as pain. They numb us out,” Cas says. “Leg doesn’t hurt so bad anymore, it’s just a stiff fucker.” Castiel flinches at the sound of profanity falling from his own mouth, but Cas just casts him a lopsided grin. “But we kept askin’ for the drugs.”
Hello Dean. This is Castiel again. Was thinking we could do next Thursday night around 7?
His phone buzzes with another call from Sam. He turns it off.
“What makes you think that?” The stranger asks with a warm smile.
“Well this is going to be embarrassing.” Cas starts with a smile. “I wanted to become an accountant.” He adds, chuckling. Dean tries to keep a straight face but soon bursts into laughter, tilting his head back. He doesn’t see Castiel looking at him with affectionate eyes and if he does, he decides to bury this piece of information far, far in the back of his head.
“Exactly. It is my day. So if I say I want to talk about your ‘stupid problems’ then we’re gonna talk about them alright?” Sam says, determined. “What’s going on? Is it about Cas?” Dean flinches at the name. “It
“Weird.” Dean says instantly. “Embarrassed.” He clarifies and takes a step back. He glances at Castiel but looks away just as fast. “I’m sorry for- all that.” He says and gestures around the two of them with his hand. “Can I- Can I use your bathroom?”
“That’s not what I’m trying to say here and you know it.” Castiel cuts him off. “I don’t blame you.” Dean wants to protest but Castiel doesn’t let him the time. “I don’t. I’m just trying to make you understand. I know I may seem like I have it all figured out but that’s not true. And I know you didn’t mean to sound harsh back there, you were just shocked and Dean, I- Trust me I get it. I do. But it wasn’t exactly easy for me either.”
“I don’t.” He lowers his eyes again. “You think you’ve got a pretty clear picture of what a person’s like but really sometimes you realize you don’t even know the first thing about them.”
“Just make sure you come back, alright?” He says as he lets go of his hand and walks away.
“You know I do.” He leans on his Impala’s hood and takes the beer Bobby hands to him. He takes a sip and sighs, looking at the sun fading out behind the buildings. It’s not rare for them to enjoy a fresh beer at the end of a long day and Dean has come to really appreciate this habit. For a short moment, nothing seems to exist around him, almost as if the world stops and the only thing Dean cares about is his brother, Bobby, the beer in his hand and the sunset.
“I never said you were.” Castiel answers. “There were just some signs, I just assumed that maybe-”
“How long you’re here for?” He says as they’re both walking towards Dean’s flat.
“I’m starving.” Dean admits with a smile. “Thanks.”
“I don’t know man I thought I- I thought it was just a very weirdly intimate but completely platonic relationship.” He says, his cheeks turning red again at the sound of Castiel’s laughter echoing across the room. “Dude please just- I’m trying to say something here. It’s… It’s important.”
“Dean, we didn’t really part on good terms the other day.” Castiel reminds him. “And maybe that’s my fault I don’t know, but after what happened last time we saw each other I just thought- I mean Dean, what did you expect, you didn’t exactly react with the b-”
” He sends.
“You think you’ll ever settle down? If you find the right g- the right person.”
“What are you doing here?” Castiel asks with a smile. His keys are in his right hand and Dean lets out a small laugh when he realizes the exit is the other way around. He’s trapped between Castiel and a wall.
“Can’t see her ever stopping being one.” Dean answers with a smile. They used to see Charlie a lot a few years ago, him and Sam. She was their neighbor back when they were still living at their parents’ place, and it wasn’t rare for her to give them a hand in the garage, especially for the IT part, that until she got her dream job in a company Dean can’t remember the name of. It’s not rare for her to come back to her hometown for a few days and Dean would be lying if he said he didn’t miss her quite a lot. They’ve always considered her as their little sister and Dean isn’t sure if he knows a more passionate person than her. He smiles fondly at the memories and takes another sip of his beer.
“I do not. One day at a time?”
“What is it, man?” Dean asks, his brows furrowed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean lets out a small laugh. “Yeah tell me about it. What’s your deal, then? Accountant?”
“He… He did told me he was having some time-off starting from tonight.” Dean admits. “Cas, I mean.”
“Enough for today, boys.” Bobby says. “Want a beer?”
“Listen kid you’re only fucking things up since this morning. I’m not blaming ya but you should get some sleep. You look like shit.”
“That Castiel was flirting with Dean.” Sam precises.
“Sorry.” Castiel answers, smiling. “Too tempting.” He nudges him and Dean is so glad he decided to put aside that whole overwhelming conversation they just had, even if just for a few hours. He’s not naive, he knows perfectly well Castiel is eventually going to come back to it at some point but for now he’s just happy to relax and enjoy the evening.
“Don’t listen to him. Dean’s an asshole.” Sam says, popping his head between the threshold and the door. “I swear, you’re gonna make all the new customers flee at this point.”
“Nothing I just- never mind.”
“I just thought you would like to hear it.” Sam answers and seems to ponder over something for a few seconds until he speaks again. “With Castiel being gone soon and all.”
Dean said goodbye to his brother first. He left in the morning and Dean dropped him off at the bus station and made him promise to send him a text as soon as gets to the airport.
“The wheels also seem to be in a bad shape.”
, dean repeats in his head to himself.
“I’m fine Bobby.” He says as he lowers his eyes, his jaw clenched.
“Huh well it was… It was important.”
“You too.” Dean manages to articulate. He gives him a weak smile and watches him as he steps out of the car.
“These your parents?” Dean asks while pointing at the couple in a picture on the left.
“Listen Dean.” Castiel starts and there’s a seriousness in his tone that Dean doesn’t like. “I don’t know where you’re at about… about us, but- I feel like I owe it to you to be honest on something.”
“Listen Dean I know we- I know we’ve never been very good at communicating in this family, especially with the way dad-” Sam starts but marks a pause, looking at Dean with a determined look on his face. “All I’m saying is that if you ever feel the need to talk to me- about anything- even something you think will probably bother me- then I’m- I’m here. I’m here for you, man. Bobby too. We’re not great talkers but we can listen. You do know that, right?”
“I knew it, man. The trench-coat and the classy suit? You can’t fool me.”
“You’ve always been working with your brother and your dad?”
“You never noticed? Dean I wasn’t being very subtle about it. If you didn’t think I was flirting, what do you think I was doing?”
“Doesn’t matter.” Dean gets to his feet. Cas follows suit.
Sam seems to catch his disapproving gaze before it sets in and he nods, checking the box on the paper and going quiet again. Dean clears his throat, wishing he could cross his arms. After Benny died, with no one around to shove a pill and a glass of water in his hand, he just hasn’t been motivated to take his prescription. He knows that Sam and Charlie talk shit about it when he’s not around, but they don’t understand. The only one who ever understood was Benny. The name--or more likely the memories connected to it--leaves a bad taste in his mouth.
“Fuck you,” Cas grits out. Dean laughs without any humor in it.
When he returns to the waiting room, his sprained arm in a sling and in a significantly worse mood, Cas is not waiting for him. Sammy, however, is awake and scrolling through his phone. Dean walks over to him gingerly, knocking the phone from his hand with his good arm when Sam doesn’t look up at him.
“What the fuck?” they ask the moment Dean is within earshot.
“Friends,” Cas whispers, an unwelcome reminder, but the word is a stark contrast to the tightening of the grip on his hip.
“Cas?”
“Like you said, that is none of your business.” Dean recognizes the tense tone and knows he shouldn’t push the subject. “This one is a little personal,” Cas warns, glancing over the sheet. Dean nods, shifting to read over Castiel’s shoulder. “Do you have a history of issues with addiction to medication?” Dean shakes his head, and Castiel checks the ‘no’ box. “Have you ever been diagnosed with alcoholism?” Cas has the pen hovering over the ‘no’ box again, but when Dean doesn’t answer, he turns and looks up at him.
Dean slams into the ground, all of his breath is knocked out of him on contact. He barely has time to gasp for air before the vamp is on top of him, nails digging painfully into his shoulder.
“But it’s different,” Cas says, growing agitated. Sam leans forward across the table, brow furrowed, clearly just as frustrated as Cas.
Dean feels something like tears prickling at the back of his eyes and he looks away, clearing his throat and blinking.
“Why did you tell me not to come?” they demand. Dean looks exhausted instead of pissed now. There’s still a speck of blood on his cheek, and they tentatively reach out, using their thumb to wipe it away. He jerks away on instinct, but after a moment he lets them help.
Cas waves his hand and Dean’s room dissolves, leaving nothing but the calm splashing of the water behind.
Benny risks peeking an eye open and finds that Dean has turned away again. Cas. He recognizes the name. Sometimes Dean whispers it in his sleep, voice full of longing and loss. Sometimes he screams it, more of a desperate, terrified plea. Cas is the angel.
There is no response, no laughter under breath that was meant for only Dean to hear. No snide comment or obscure reference that even Dean barely grasps.
If Cas had still been panicking, the confining walls of the car and the bumps on the road would have been too much for him. Instead, he barely registers them. Dean doesn’t say anything, doesn’t press him or even look at him more than the occasional wellness check.
Dean pokes his head in without warning.
“I know,” the angel replies quietly. Benny watches Dean take the words like a physical blow.
“I think being on earth is my problem.”
Nobody in the room talks. Even the nurse, who had been about to read out another name, is frozen in place. Dean swallows thickly and sinks down in his chair, glaring at anyone who is rude enough to be openly staring at him. The general rustle and hum of the room returns slowly, and Sam clears his throat awkwardly.
If figuring out his own emotions can be frustrating, placing Dean’s is next to impossible. Over the years, Cas has learned to use body language to help figure out what Dean is feeling. Folded arms mean he’s defensive, whereas fiddling hands mean he’s anxious. If the line between his eyes deepens but the rest of his face remains impassive, he’s in deep thought. When he is angry, his jaw tightens and he stiffens, draws himself up like a soldier.
“Uh oh,” it teases. “Little Sammy looks down for the count.” He squirms, but it’s no use. The claws press down harder. The fabric of his shirt tears. Dean grunts in pain, tossing his head back before realizing it probably isn’t the smartest move to bare his neck to the vamp. As he shifts to look the monster dead in the eye, he sees movement behind it. He doesn’t dare let his gaze waver to investigate. “But what about Cassstiel?” It lingers on Cas’s name, like a hiss. “Hm? Where’s your boyfriend, Dean?”
He glances at his phone before laying back down. No new notifications.
“I think,” Cas says slowly, “that you deserve to be back there. Tending a bar. Taking Miracle to the park.” Dean lets out a breath of relief.
“The next time I tell you to stay at camp, you stay at camp,” Dean says shortly. Cas glares out the windshield. Part of them wants to drop it, to count their blessings that Dean seems to be shockingly calm, but then they think about Chuck and Jo saying Dean is soft on them. They don’t want to be treated differently.
“Cas. Hey.” He rubs at the back of his neck. There’s a moment of awkward silence, and that’s when Dean realizes that he doesn’t have anything to say. He had been so focused on getting Cas on the phone, he’d never thought of what to talk to him about once it happened. “What’s up?”
Behind them, each of the cars in the convoy screech to sudden stops. Somehow, there’s no sound of metal on metal collision.
Instead of water, he can see his room. Sam is sitting on the edge of his bed, talking quietly to Miracle as he rubs and scratches behind his ears. Dean can’t hear him, but he can see the hitch in his chest every few words.
“I gave the guy your number,” Sam tells him as they drive home, breaking the silence and reading Dean’s glum thoughts. “I wouldn’t wait on him, though. He wasn’t very happy when I started talking to him. He just sat there and stared straight ahead until his buddy got back. It was kind of creepy, actually. I don’t think you two would work out anyways.” Dean makes a noncommittal noise and nods, staring out the window. Sam gets the message, turning up the radio and finishing the rest of the drive in silence.
“Yeah,” Cas says, stilling the hand that was previously skating over Dean’s side. Dean breathes out a laugh, and he’s asleep within minutes.
Cas is okay with that. He’s okay with not knowing what Sam meant that night. As long as Dean lets him sit a little too close on the couch with a tolerant smile, Cas is okay. He doesn’t need to say it out loud, to have what he so desperately wants, if he can just be with Dean.
“I don’t think we will.” Cas is turned partly toward Dean and his fingers twitch on the arm of his chair. Dean flicks his gaze up to meet his eyes. Cas is watching him closely.
“You kiddin’?” He touches Castiel’s face lightly. “I wanted to see you.” Cas’ gaze softens and he smiles, but it disappears quickly.
sounds good. ive got a place in mind. will pick u up.
They shouldn’t go. Dean asked them not to. No, he
“Of course,” he says eventually. “Of course, Cas. I--”
Castiel looks at him for a long moment, at the strong jaw that he’d caught Cas cupping when he was zapped into the future, at the scar above his eyebrow, at the broken curve of his nose.
“How’s your boyfriend’s face?” He asks, hoping his misery doesn’t shine through in his tone.
“I was watching over Sam.”
Cas, suddenly ashamed, stares at the side mirror, as though fascinated by the view of the side of the car and the garage door. He has never seen Dean or Sam like this without reason, he realizes. They only ever break down in the face of horrifying losses and unshakable traumas. He was just a little overwhelmed, and he called Dean to rescue him.
Cas is seeing Sam in swirling colors. His soul more than his physical form. It makes him dizzy. Too dizzy to realize that Dean is in the kitchen again and saying something.
“Why did you come in here, then? Just to disturb my peace?” Cas is agitated, confused by whatever Dean is trying to say and pissed that they’re being locked in their room like a child.
“Well now that’s not a great way of speaking to your new customers.” Dean opens his mouth to say something but quickly closes it again. He doesn’t exactly know what about this guy makes him lose his usually cool and casual demeanor but he’s determined to find out.
“I just uh wanted to talk, talk to you.” Dean articulates and he lowers his eyes to the ground in embarrassment when he can hear his own voice waver.
“One day my dad just- he just lost it, Cas. He came back home battered, and he- well that’s when the hitting part started.”
“You’ll see him again.”
“Shut up, Sammy.” His brother only rolls his eyes and crosses the office to go to the bathroom. Dean watches him as he disappears behind the door but quickly brings back his attention to the stranger when his voice echoes through the room again.
“Yeah.” Dean lowers his eyes once again. “Yeah I guess.” He says, leaning to the touch of Castiel’s hand.
“How do I know? Really, Dean? The man was flirting with you all the damn time, even I noticed and I wasn’t around much.” Sam tells him. “I mean, he literally asked you out, man.”
When Dean parks his car next to Kansas’ airport, it’s pouring rain. It strikes on his windshield and Dean turns up the volume of the radio, glancing at the door Castiel should use to leave the main building, any minute now. His fingers tap the beat of a song on the steering wheel and Dean mumbles the lyrics with a low voice.
“Oh Bobby’s not my dad.” He corrects him. It’s a common mistake and Dean doesn’t blame him for making the assumption.
Luckily for them, it’s still early in the afternoon and there’s little traffic around the airport. Dean makes his way back to the parking lot in no more than thirty minutes. He lets his hands set down on the steering wheel and gives Castiel a small smile, waiting for him to open the car door and dive into the airport once again. But his friend doesn’t do any of these things and stay awfully quiet for a few seconds, that until something clicks on his face and he turns around to look at him with what seems to be a determined look.
“What do you want, Dean?” Castiel asks and it’s such a simple question but Dean finds himself at a loss for words. His head is spinning again and he doesn’t know how to make sense of all his thoughts and feelings, they’re swirling around in his mind and everything is so unclear and indistinct and Dean can’t think. He just can’t think.
“How come?” Castiel asks, and it’s something else that Dean doesn’t understand, why his friend always seems to be adamant to go to the bottom of everything, to make sure he understands what’s on his head all the damn time, because Dean’s head is messed-up and Castiel would flee if he came to realize how little he knew about himself.
Dean’s always been working there, ever since he graduated from high-school. Even in primary school, he remembers spending his week-ends here, trying to give his father a hand whenever it was needed. ‘Singer Auto Salvage’ was originally called ‘Winchester Auto Salvage’ until their father decided to vanish from the face of the earth and never come back. After that, the business was sold to Bobby, one of their dad’s old friends, whom Dean’s been helping ever since. He likes it here, and he never really thought of doing anything else, not that he was given a choice anyway. When his father disappeared soon after their mother’s death, Dean needed to take care of his little brother and he drowned himself in work until he was able to pay back Sam’s loan for his law school. And now that he’s only three months away from graduating, Dean’s been meaning to take it a bit slower and give himself some time-off, but Bobby needs help and he doesn’t find it in him to ask for a small vacation, as deserving of a break as he may be. He owes him that. Not that he minds. He’s good at what he does and he’s free to be his own boss, as Bobby mostly views him as a “partner” rather than an “employee”.
“I’m sorry.” Dean repeats another time, almost pleadingly. “I’m sorry. I know I-”
Dean hangs up and lets the cellphone fall on the office desk. He tries to sort the mail and put every document and every paper in order because he knows for a fact that there is no way Bobby is going to do it anytime soon. He’s always been disorganized and Sam was usually the one who was dealing with the administrative part of the job, him being the most meticulous. Dean tried to give him a hand from time to time and eventually had to take the reins when his brother left for Stanford. Bobby helps when he can but Dean always tells him not to because he only seems to make it worse. It doesn’t take him too long to find Castiel’s invoice and car keys and after putting everything in evidence on the table, Dean stands up and turns the light off. He leaves the room and is about to change a flat tire when Bobby’s voice changes his plans.
“Dean?”
“You’re fine.” Dean says, trying to not make his uneasiness obvious.
“Oh this is going to be so much fun, Bobby.”
, he thinks. The man is probably the last person he wants to deal with at the moment. He’s had his fair share of rich people thinking they’re better than him just because they hold a more prestigious place in society and Dean’s had enough.
“Right.”
Maybe he doesn’t have to do it now, he thinks. Maybe it’s too early. He still hasn’t figured out everything and Castiel did tell him that maybe it was preferable if he took some time alone. Yes. Castiel is right. He still needs time. There are still some things he needs to focus on before starting a relationship with someone. And does he even want to start a relationship with Castiel? Maybe he doesn’t. Maybe he’s not ready to commit. Maybe this is just a ‘heat of a moment’ thing and he’s going to regret it in the morning. After all, he was still at his brother’s place the day before and 24 hours is clearly not enough to make up his mind on something so big. Maybe he needs to take a step back and reflect some more. Yes. It seems like the smartest decision right now.
“Okay.” Dean says. “Thank you.”
“Fucking tourist.” Dean mutters under his breath. Their eyes meet for a few seconds and Dean only half smiles but looks away quickly when he sees Sam is already on it.
“That’s a good song.”
not sure if it's great i kinda feel like it's boring buuut hopefully you liked it :)
(See the end of the chapter for
“I doubt romantic relationships are built for me man but thanks for the concern.” Dean dismisses the question and gazes at his phone for a while until it lights up with a message from Cas.
“Well I am. Proud. Dean I’m so sorry this happened to you. And I- I don’t know what to say- Thank you. Thank you for opening up to me. I can only imagine how hard it must have been for you but I just- Dean I want you to know that-”
“It’s Cas?” Sam asks.
“No I’m telling you to stop trying to figure me out. Because if you knew the extent of how fucked-up I am you would run away, Cas.”
“I got Charlie on the phone this morning by the way.” He says, breaking the silence. “She’s in town for a few days in May, she’ll want to see us.” He speaks again, mostly to Sam as he knows his brother is set to have a few days off around the same time.
“Well he- he told me he-” Dean blinks hard and tries to clear his head and let the words come out. It turns out he doesn’t need to though, Sam beats him to it.
“That was me flirting with you in case you need to be sure” There’s a hint of teasing in Castiel’s voice and Dean huffs out a laugh.
“Hey, it’s Dean Winchester from the garage?” He tells him as makes is way in the office, letting himself fall heavily on the chair.
here is chapter 2 :)
“I don’t want you to say anything. I just wanted you to know where I’m at.” Castiel clarifies.
did. And he asked
“When he went back to the garage to fetch his car? He asked you if he could buy you a drink? You really didn’t notice anything, did you?”
“You come back soon, yeah?” He asks and doesn’t understand why his voice sounds so broken all of a sudden, but he doesn’t care because next second he can feel Castiel’s arm bringing him close and Dean’s face is pressed against his neck. He sighs in relief and breathes in the scent of his perfume. He closes his eyes fiercely but lets his arms hanged along his body.
“Then what are you waiting for, man?” Sam asks, his eyes wide.
“How- how do you know I’ve been avoiding him?” Dean eventually asks with shifty eyes.
“And what was that?”
“So what you’re breaking up with me?” Dean huffs out a laugh, his eyes still bright with tears.
It’s Castiel’s turn now. His friend is smiling, his fixed car next to him, the engine running. Dean gazes into space for a few seconds, he only knows the guy for a bit less than a month yet what they shared feels like a lifetime to him, and he doesn’t want to let go. He wants to say something but he stays there instead, motionless, unable to raise his eyes towards him. It’s only when Castiel looks down at the ground with a shy smile that Dean seems to regain the use of speech.
“I insist.” Dean opens his mouth to say something and for a few seconds he wants to ask Castiel why the offer only seems to be directed at him but he eventually shrugs his shoulders and nods. Who is he to say no to free beers?
It’s Dean’s weak attempt to run away from that unfiltered conversation and weird intimacy and he doesn’t really care if his old bad habits of constantly fleeing from moments like this one are obvious to Castiel’s eyes, Dean still doesn’t waste any time to rush out of the living-room and into the bathroom. There, he stops himself in front of the mirror and take in his appearance. His eyes are red from all the tears that rolled down his cheeks and the tired features of his face makes him look older than he actually is. He splashes his face with water and runs his fingers through his hair until he’s happy with the way he looks, or at least happy with the way he managed to cover up the redness from his eyes, and cheeks.
“I’m not- That’s not what’s happening.”
“Hey Castiel” Sam says. “Your car’s good to go.”
It’s not common for customers to invite them to grab a drink, quite rare in fact, but Castiel being a new visitor and having no friends in town, Dean told himself it was the least he could do to make him feel more at home, even if it only was for a couple of weeks.
“No. Just arrived this morning, I’m only here for a couple of weeks.”
“You should go, man. You don’t want to miss your flight, right? Go. I’m fine. He doesn’t have the emotional capacity to go on with that conversation and he’s not even sure he wants to. Running away and making sure they don’t engage in dangerous territory seems more like him anyway.
“Dean, you mind calling Castiel Novak? I just finished his car.” Sam says from the other side of the garage, getting him out of his daydream.
“Thanks man. You know I couldn’t have done it without you.” Sam says, his chin on Dean’s right shoulder. It’s not often they allow themselves to share a moment like this one but Dean will be damned if he’s not here to see his little brother achieve one of his biggest dreams. He remembers 10 years old Sam telling him all about how he wanted to become a civil rights attorney to eradicate discrimination and prosecute the bad guys, that kid had big dreams and Dean knew that if someone could do it, it was him.
“Hello, Dean.”
“Hum… Thanks. I guess.” Dean answers, looking away. There’s a small tremor in his own voice that he doesn’t understand, and doesn’t particularly like either. He can feel that the man’s eyes are still on him and Dean squirms uncomfortably on his seat. He clears his throat and lets out a relieved sigh when Castiel finally steps out of the room. He watches him as he makes his way outside the garage and lets his eyes linger on his broad shoulders and his black hair for a while, that until Bobby sends him an amused look and Dean quickly finishes to type the client’s information and puts the computer on standby.
can’t do that for you. I can help and I want to help but ultimately Dean, that’s something you need to figure out on your own. And maybe it’s best if we take some distance, you and I.”
“Nah, I don’t mind waiting, we’ll be there.”
Dean finds it funny, that they only really know the guy for a few days but they already seem to be on a first-name basis. They always tend to be friendly with all their customers because that’s just how they are and Dean never really liked being too formal, but it still usually takes them a bit more time.
“Sam?”
“My brother.” Dean clarifies. “You met him.” He points at Sam still working on the same car outside but the stranger's eyes stay focused on him. Dean holds his gaze for a few seconds but his eyes eventually dart down on the computer.
“Dean I’m sorry.” Castiel says and Dean is surprised he’s a lot closer than he was a few seconds ago. He looks up at him and lets himself get lost in his bright blue eyes. Castiel lifts his hand and cradle Dean’s chin in a delicate gesture. Dean lowers his eyes to the ground and lets his own fingers intertwine themselves with Castiel’s.
“I’ll give you a call. See you around, Cas.”
They don’t share an excessive amount of messages but enough for Dean’s usual routine to be interfered with a bit. Castiel is a co-pilot and he’s not able to be on his phone quite a lot during the days, which is convenient for Dean as he likes to stay focused on his work at the garage and not be interrupted.
“Well if it’s only these two doors and the broken window, you’ll probably have your car good as new in a week or so.” Dean answers, inviting the man to follow him in the small room serving as an office.
“Vacation?” Dean leans against the back of the chair.
“Hello Dean. Sam.” Dean looks up at Castiel whom he didn’t see coming. He gives him a warm smile and can’t help but notice he no longer wears a trench-coat but a black hooded jacket with a green tee-shirt and a pair of jeans, which, Dean has to admit, makes him look a lot more approachable.
“Very observant.”
“You take care, okay?” His friend is looking at him with his bright blue eyes, placing his hand on his left shoulder and Dean finds himself longing for more. His body stirs, he steps forward but comes to a dead stop. He realizes he has no idea what he’s doing, there’s no way for him to act on what he feels if he doesn’t know what he feels in the first place. And so he just smiles and nods, he’s not sure he can do anything else. His head is heavy and his chest aches and he’s not sure he ever experienced this kind of pain before. He wants to say it’s not physical but he would be wrong, his throat is tight and his mouth is dry and there’s a knot in his stomach he can’t seem to be able to untangle.
“You scared me man but hell yeah it is, Zeppelin rules.” Dean answers as he turns around. “Rough day?” He asks, only half trying to be polite.
about Cas then. Thought you guys were good and had patched things up?”
“You’re an asshole.” Dean says with a fake accusing tone.
“I never told you about my parents.” He says, and stays silent for a while.
“I’m fine, Cas.” He takes a step backwards. He’s about to join Bobby in the garage when Castiel’s hand slips in his own. Dean’s body freezes but he finds himself being brave enough to squeeze his friend’s fingers against his own.
, he thinks as he opens the clients’ file.
“Small accident.” The stranger answers and Dean is taken aback by how gravelly and deep the voice is. He looks up and his eyes stare at the disheveled hair, the designer stubble and the tired features of the man’s face. “I’m not from around here. I guess I should have paid more attention.” The stranger adds, and Dean finally looks away.
“Yeah right. I said I’m fine.”
“We are. We did.” Dean starts and is about to stop there but then Castiel’s words resonate in his head and he decides to push through the awkwardness and the embarrassment. “You remember when I spent the afternoon with him in Kansas?”
“What does Cas have to do with anything?”
“What the fuck are you talking about, man?” Dean asks, confused. “Why are you telling me this now?”
“Hum he’s not- he’s not my-”
“How do you-”
“No need to thank me. See you, Dean.”
“Well you know what they say. These wheels, always tired.” Dean says with a smirk. He thinks this is gonna earn him a small laugh from the other man but instead he only furrows his brows and tilts his head to the left, his confusion clearly shown. “Never mind. You’ll get it fixed soon enough. Sam’s fast.”
“You’re still seeing that chick? Eileen right?” Dean asks. He doesn’t really know what his brother was trying to tell him and to be perfectly honest he’s not sure he even wants to understand.
Dean looks up from the steering wheel when he hears the distinct sound of someone shutting a car door. From what he can see, the car seems to be in quite a bad state and the first thing that comes to his mind is that the repairs are going to cost a lot. Not that he minds or feels bad for whoever needs to pay, in fact it only means more money for the business and god only knows how much they need it. He says nothing but rolls his eyes when they fall on the man standing up near the car. He only has to take a quick look at him to know the guy is loaded and probably working as an accountant or something along the lines of it. He wears a black suit underneath a brown trench-coat and from the way he keeps glancing to his right and left, he seems to be lost and in search of reassurance.
“I- I wasn’t really- I acted like a dick, Sam. I was- I was shocked and he needed to get back to work so I- I just let him go. I thought I was gonna be able to- to forget about the whole thing you know, pretend it never happened like I always do but- it was eating away at me, Sam. So I called him and- well I- We talked.”
“Castiel Novak’s speaking” The voice which resonates in his ear is calm and weirdly professional and Dean has to think twice before being able to gather the words he wants to say.
“Hum. Dean. Dean Winchester. It’s a… Family business. Kind of.” He still says, avoiding any eye-contact. “You’re… You’re new in town, right? We’re used to have the same customers and I don’t remember seeing you around. Am I wrong?”
“Well I guess I’ll see you around then, mister the co-pilot.”
“Well Castiel Novak, we’ll only need your car keys and your phone number. As soon as your car is ready to go, I’ll give you a call.”
“What happened there, man?” He can still hear Sam say as he checks the tire’s tread of Rufus’ car.
Love makes people stupid. That’s the only explanation he can think of when he wakes up to Dean talking once again the next night, but this time there’s a low voice answering him.
“If you ever actually propose to me in my shitty living room while you smell like sweat and oil and I’m in sweatpants I’ll kill you.” It’s Dean’s turn to laugh.
They don’t talk much after that. Surely Jo and Chuck are wondering whether they will get in trouble for not only letting Cas tag along, but for letting him get ahold of the radio and broadcasting it to everyone else. As they near their destination, Cas begins rethinking their plan to wait in the car.
. I mean, sure, we—I guess, we—no. No relationship. Officially. We don’t talk about it.” Their cheeks threaten to go red, so they clear their throat and turn the conversation back to the topic at hand. “He doesn’t go easy on me.”
“Well, then…Chuck and Jo are better on road trips than you,” Cas replies. “They yell less.” Dean laughs weakly, eyes shifting from the road to the mirror back to Cas. Their gazes catch, and this time Dean forgets to look away.
“You sounded pretty clear-headed to me, Dean.” Before the hunter can make some elaborate excuse, Cas sets his phone on the table with the voicemail open.
“He’s gonna be pissed if he finds out we let you come,” Jo points out, not seeming to notice, “so I’m screwed either way.”
When he gets into his room and sets the drink down, he struggles with his phone in his pocket until it finally pops free. He hasn’t had the heart to look at it until now, and any hope he was fostering that Castiel would’ve texted him is squashed. He has one notification, and it’s from his cousin, Garth. He ignores the text and tosses the phone on the bedside table, but not before turning on his ringer. Just in case.
They don’t tell him to be careful. Careful isn’t in his job description.
“Dean, listen--”
“Dean? Where the hell are you, dude? We gotta go!” Cas recognizes Sam’s muffled voice. Before he knows it, Dean is cursing and hanging up and suddenly, his voicemail box is empty.
He isn’t sure what he expects. For Sam to tell him to get out, or to laugh at him, or to ask if this is some joke. At the very least, he expects Sam to look surprised. Instead, he takes another measured drink and nods.
This feeling, though, Cas is used to. He feels it all the time; when he is fumbling through a video game or tripping over his borrowed feet. When Dean teases him, lighthearted as it usually is. He is embarrassed.
them not to. A few years ago, the idea of Dean
As if on cue, Cas looms over the creature, machete raised high above his head.
“I told you. I have to fill this out!”
“Thank you.” He hangs up the phone and drops it into his lap without waiting for Dean to respond. People walk by him without stopping to make sure he is okay, which is probably for the best, because he doesn’t know if he’d be able to handle someone touching him or looking at him wrong. He pulls his knees to his chest and rests his forehead there until he hears the Impala pull into the parking spot right next to him. By that time, he’s breathing normally again. His feet feel solid beneath him and the cold is more of a nuisance than a stressor. The engine purrs so recognizably that Cas lifts his head on instinct and stands on shaking legs.
He smiles, looking from the screen to his sleeping brother. Sam looks younger when he sleeps, his hair swept across his face. The permanent line between his brow when he’s awake is smoothed, and he looks peaceful. Dean hovers for another moment, looking at how his brother could’ve been. If he had done a better job looking after him. At least things seem to be taking off between him and Eileen. Dean likes her. He knows that Sam likes her a lot too.
“You called me.” Dean would hang up the phone out of embarrassment if Cas didn’t have that patiently amused tone in his voice. But he does. Dean can almost see him, one eyebrow quirked and the ghost of a smile on his lips. “Dean?” Cas sounds concerned now. Dean almost hits himself upside the head. He hasn’t said anything! He’s been walking around in circles and thinking about the way Castiel’s lips look when he smiles and not saying anything! Like an idiot.
Cas stares at him, something ugly rising in his gut.
“Yeah, whatever. I’ve got to go, Han. Tell mom and Gabe I say hi.” He hangs up the phone and turns on his heel without looking at Dean. He returns to where he had been sitting with Mark and grabs his coat. Then, with not so much as a glance in Dean’s direction, he’s walking by his chair.
Dean bites his lip to stop the smile on his face from growing too big, even though no one can see him. The first thing he does is fix the contact.
“I’d give anything for you to be here. I’m sorry.” He breaks down again, words lost in breathtaking sobs that barely sound human. Benny rolls over and tries to fall back asleep.
“Delta 7,” Dean tells Daniel shortly. He walks off without complaint. Cas looks down at their lap, waiting for the barrage to start. Dean doesn’t say anything as he cleans the blood from his neck and his arms. None of it is his, Cas notes thankfully. Still, they aren’t dumb enough to offer to help today.
Cas lets out a relief-drunken laugh, grabbing his book and slapping Dean’s arm with it. Glad to be over with the unpleasant storm of emotions that had been brewing inside of him, he feigns nonchalance.
“Then what was it?” He chances a look back up at Castiel, who has picked up his papers again and is pointing at a question with a pen. Dean glances at it and shakes his head. “No to that whole section.”
Jo grabs the radio and bullshits about an ammo box being loose. Meanwhile, Chuck is looking at Cas over his shoulder.
“I mean, you could get away with a little bit more than the rest of us could,” Jo says casually. Cas feels their eyebrows rocket upwards. “And it’s just—nobody wants to put more stress on Dean’s shoulders by fucking around, you know?”
Sure, he’s without his little brother for the first time since Sam left for college, but he’d take that over Sam being here. Being dead. Dean makes a mental note to beat the shit out of him if he shows up in anything less than forty years from now.
“Sorry about your weed.”
Dean can’t help it, he lets out a cynical bark of a laugh. Castiel hears him. He turns on him, an uncharacteristic scowl on his face. Dean raises his eyebrows, and Cas glares at him for a moment more before continuing to pace.
“Me and Dean do have a…more profound bond,” they say haltingly. “But we are not in a
“I wasn’t taunting you,” Cas objects. Dean makes a noise of disbelief. “I was making sure you were alive. Nobody knew what the hell was happening, all we heard was a gunshot.”
“Just do it, Sam.” He doesn’t give him a chance to say no. He gives the door one last pleading look, but it remains stubbornly shut. Maybe Castiel took off. But he wouldn’t totally abandon his boyfriend like that, not after how fiercely he defended him from both Dean and his sister. He just doesn’t want to see Dean, it seems. Maybe he’s waiting just on the other side until he’s sure Dean is long gone. Either way, he doesn’t appear before Dean disappears through the doors, following the nurse down the never-ending hallways.
Cas doesn’t follow.
“Hey, Cas. I ditched Sammy and the kid…” Cas watches Dean, who watches the phone fixedly. He doesn’t look surprised by the existence of the voicemail, but he closes his eyes after a minute. “...but he didn’t really lose what I lost, did he?”
“You’re kidding, right?”
“Guess you had to sign your work after you saved me again, huh?”
“Hey, babe.” Castiel’s voice is a controlled calm, but he paces back and forth in front of Dean, dragging his hand through his hair roughly. “No, you’re not interrupting anything. We just got back from dinner. Me and..me and Dean. Yeah.” He pauses for a moment, and he meets Dean’s gaze.
Far too quickly, everything goes quiet. Cas perks up, one hand on their gun, and listens as hard as they can with their good ear.
“Please.” He stops again. When he continues, his voice is clear. “Anyway, that’s the news report for the day. I’ll talk to you tomorrow, ‘kay? Okay. Over and out.”
“Yes, it does--”
“Uh--what was that?” Dean ignores him, tossing his burger back in the bag, not hungry anymore. They’d been having a nice time, and he ruined it. What the hell was he thinking telling a complete stranger what he thought about his relationship? Stupid. “Dean, come on man,” Sam presses. God, he’s annoying. Dean brushes him off, but he sighs sharply and Dean caves.
“Go change,” he orders, cracking his book open and pretending to be able to read. He’s too dizzy. The words swim in front of his eyes. “I’m not marrying you in those socks.”
His feet slam into solid ground and despite his working grace, the only thing that keeps him from stumbling into the asphalt is Dean’s hand on his arm. Dean. His Dean.
“Alright,” Dean says as Sam sets the picture to the side and scratches Miracle’s head. “That’s enough.”
Dean takes his hand from where it was clenched at his side as he watched Sam and holds it out in the space between them. Cas stares at it for a moment before looking back up at Dean and taking it.
She looks at him quizzically.
“Castiel,” he repeats. Cas frowns. Before he can respond Dean continues, “Winchester. Castiel Winchester.” Then, impossibly, his grin widens. “That’s sexy.”
“Oh, really?” Dean’s voice is tinged with mock intrigue. “What’s that like? Feel different?”
“Is that today?”
Dean sticks his tongue out at him, but shrugs a little as he pulls him back into a tight hug.
“I’m going to run this up to the nurse,” Sam tells them, squinting his eyes suspiciously as Dean nods, distracted by something Cas is saying under his breath. He stomps away without being noticed.
“No,” Dean answers, sighing dramatically.
“I’m glad to see you, but it was not your time yet,” he says, voice heavy. “I’m sorry.”
“I didn’t know he was in here,” Cas explains, cutting him off before things can get weird. “Asshole let himself in. I was just telling him to get lost.”
“We’re going to the courthouse today,” Dean tells him. As though he doesn’t know. Cas looks up at him, a dry smile playing on his lips.
“Cas!” Dean calls after him, twisting in his chair and wincing when his arm protests. Cas comes to a stop in front of the automatic doors, which are standing open, waiting for him to go through. He turns around and holds up his arms, very clearly asking ‘what?’ “Where are you going?”
You can scream at me on
“For what it’s worth, I’m not an accountant. I’m a co-pilot.” Dean opens his eyes wide. Why someone would voluntarily want to spend his days working in a plane is beyond him but he’s always found that job pretty impressive.
“That’s an understatement.” Castiel agrees with an amused smile. His aim may be to lighten up the mood but it only makes Dean more uncomfortable.
I know this story's not great but I hope you're enjoying it anyway! I'm listening to Radio Company's new album while typing these words and i'm loving it!
out, not me.” Sam clarifies. “Trust me it was obvious. I mean even freaking Bobby could see it.”
Castiel has moved his hands from his chin to his neck now and his thumbs are brushing his cheeks with a light touch. Dean’s hand is gripping his shirt tight, almost desperately.
“Yeah. Turns out he’s leaving tomorrow, just like you.” Dean answers, his face darkening as he nervously rubs the side of his trousers.
“You don’t look too bad yourself.” Castiel answers and Dean looks down at his red flannel and his black shirt with a shrug. He hasn’t really paid attention to what he put on this morning and took the first things that his hands touched. He starts the car and slowly turns the wheel to the left in order to leave the parking lot. He drives away from the airport to the city-center and listens to Castiel talk about his day and complain about annoying passengers during his flight.
“In fact I think I remember your brother saying you were ‘emotionally constipated’”.
final chapter :)
by Zeppelin starts resonating in the garage and Dean leans on the engine as he mumbles the song’s lyrics. He doesn’t see the man approaching and jumps with surprise when he hears the same deep voice behind him.
“We don’t need to talk about me, man, today’s your day. Let’s not ruin it with my stupid problems, alright?” He tries to sound casual but his hand tighten his grip on the bottle as he looks away. He can hear his brother letting a loud sigh but he prefers to ignore it and focus on the task at hand. It’s usually enough for Sam to drop the topic, but not this time.
“Well, we’ll be closed but-”
“Is it me or Castiel just asked him out?” Sam asks Bobby once Dean is out of sight.
“Castiel. Castiel Novak.”
“More like overwhelming.” He rectifies. “You’re the first person that I uh let in, and- it’s good but I probably need some time to- to adjust.” Castiel kisses him another time, letting his hand on his neck, and sits up straight the next second, getting the creases out of his tee-shirt. His cheeks are red and his hair is disheveled and Dean only sighs at the sight. “Seriously it shouldn’t be allowed to look that hot, man.” He says and open his eyes wide when he can actually hear himself say those words out loud.
“Dean.” Castiel whispers. Dean looks up at him and frowns when he sees him looking at him with such heartbreak. “You can stop there. If it’s too much. I had no idea I-”
“I’d like that very much.”
“I know. I know Sam I just- you were right, you know. The other day. We’re not good at communicating in this family. And it is because of dad but I just can’t- I know he wasn’t exactly the dad of the year but-” Sam snorts at that and Dean lets out a nervous laugh.
“I… I know.” Castiel admits but this time Dean can hear remorse in his voice. “I’m sorry. I’ve been busy with work and well, I- I thought you wanted some space. So that’s what I’ve been trying to give you.”
“Yeah hi man, your car is ready so you can come as soon as you want.”
“The hell you are.” Bobby whispers to himself. Dean changed his position and he can now take a closer look at him. His eyes are bloodshot from the fatigue and the tired features of his face leaves little to the imagination about the number of sleep hours he gets at night. “Go back home.” He eventually says when he hears Dean curse under his breath while the spanner slips out of his hand for what might be the fifth time in two minutes.
“Well if you insist. I won’t say no to another one There’s this pub called the Roadhouse if you want to hang out.” He says, standing up to his feet. “Wanna join, Sammy?”
‘Why are you looking at me like this?” Castiel asks and only now Dean realizes he’s been staring at his friend for quite a long time, longer than necessary.
“Well for starters, the whole ‘don’t talk to me i’m too busy’ look.” The man seems surprised to hear him talk in such a frank and up-front way but laughs it off after a few seconds. “Probably what got me in the right direction.”
“I really don’t know how they do it, the flight attendants, to stay calm when you hear some loaded entitled brats complaining about the food on the plane. I mean you’re lucky enough not to have to pay for it so shut your pie-hole and eat your damn food in silence, Diane. Christ.”
“Fearless leader,” they say in reply, blinking their eyes open and sitting up. Dean does his usual sweep of the room, looking for stragglers, men from the camp who haven’t stumbled back home yet. There’s nothing to see, so his gaze finds Cas and whatever he sees makes his jaw tense. “Want a hit?”
“Hi.” Dean surprises himself with the greeting, and Sam raises his eyebrows at him.
“Sure. I’d love to go out for a ‘bite’ sometime. But I really do need to go. Goodnight, Dean.”
To his surprise, Cas doesn’t bring it up in the car. Or at dinner. Or as the three of them have a drink in the motel bar. By the time they say goodnight and Sam disappears to his room, he’s beginning to wonder if the conversation won’t happen at all. The silence is thick as Dean opens the door to his and Castiel’s room. Someone mentions how cold it is and the other hums in agreement.
Cas responds with his address and Dean plugs his phone in, glancing at the clock. It’s three in the morning. He rubs at his face and heads into the bathroom. He’s pretty clumsy with only one arm, but he manages to wash his face and change into pajama pants without causing any problems for himself.
“I know what you were asking, but it was a stupid question.”
“Why are you acting like
“Fuckin’ weirdo,” Dean mutters under his breath. “Touching my stuff.”
He can’t be the only one thinking it, because Castiel just licked his lips absentmindedly. Dean breathes out evenly, his eyes slipping to said lips without his permission. Then, because God must have some agenda against him, Castiel’s phone rings loudly.
“I’ll do it.” Dean nearly jumps out of his skin and another strike of pain runs up his arm. He hisses, grabbing at it and looking up reproachfully at the owner of the shockingly deep voice that had interrupted his conversation with Sam. It’s Castiel.
That’s as much of an answer as Castiel gets before Dean is throwing the door open and falling into the chair next to Cas roughly.
“What did you need?” Cas asks, trying to seem unbothered. They raise the joint to their lips and take a shallow puff, already feeling the familiar lightness creeping into the back of their head, the tightness behind their eyes.
“I’m fine,” Cas breathes. Dean nods shortly, and then he’s gone, Sam following him out the door and giving Cas a small smile.
“Don’t stop.”
Another hit, blowing smoke out without looking up. It’s a dismissal, clear as day. Dean is gone before they can soften it. No matter. They don’t need to worry about his feelings--he sure as hell doesn’t worry about theirs. He was mild today, no outbursts or hurled insults, but that just makes the bad days harder to deal with.
One week after Benny and Dean link up.
“All we’re saying,” Chuck pipes up, “is that if Dean had told one of us to stay behind, we sure as hell would have stayed behind.”
“Not tonight, sweetheart, you’ll have to find one of your other little friends to entertain you. I’m not in the mood.”
“And if I ask you to stop coming without telling you why?” Dean looks away from the road for long enough to make brief eye contact, long enough to tear Cas apart from the inside.
“No,” Cas cuts him off. “No, he needs to live. Or you won’t even make it to this point in his timeline.” Castiel’s fingers fidget. Dean doesn’t yell. He drops his gaze to the table and nods his head a little.
Neither of them hangs up at first. After a moment of weighted silence, Dean clears his throat. A little hope makes its way back into his wary heart.
“Okay,” Dean says, a soothing note to his voice that tells Cas he figured out this isn’t the kind of distress call he’d been expecting. “I’m leaving right now, I’ll be there in a minute.”
Their mouths are slanted together, only a breath apart, but neither of them make the next move. Cas has a hand flat against Dean’s chest, but he doesn’t push him away. His other hand is bunched on his hip. Just as Dean’s brain catches up with the moment and he tries to press forward, Cas says his name quietly.
“I thought it was sweet,” Cas tells him. Curiosity at Sam’s reaction gets the better of Dean and he returns his gaze to the lake.
“I’m sorry--” he begins, but Dean waves a hand and shakes his head.
“I just wish—” he breaks off, looking up in surprise as Dean walks in.
In the end, Cas gets the explanation they were looking for. They drive past a crumpled body on the side of the road, sickeningly small but covered in every possible indication of sickness.
“Dean, no. Are you losing your mind?”
“I wouldn’t say strangers,” Dean objects, sitting back down on the edge of his bed.
“Don’t get dead,” they say instead, still refusing to look back at him.
“I’m sure he doesn’t know what they’ve decided yet either,” Cas says softly. His voice shakes, giving away his nerves, but the other two don’t seem to notice. They’re bickering about something good-naturedly, but Dean grabs his hand absentmindedly as he gestures with his other. Cas gives it a grateful squeeze.
“Guys,” Charlie half-shouts, pulling their attention to her, and then to the TV as she points at it. The camera is panning over the crowd on the steps of the courthouse and-- “They’re cheering! You guys--they’re cheering! That means--”
“What the fuck was with that explosion back there? We’re disintegrating towns now?” Cas pushes their luck. “That’s what was in Delta 7? An unmarked box of fuckin’ explosives?”
Dean swings his legs over the edge of the bed, holds the phone between his cheek and his neck, and rubs at his eyes, and then a deep voice is coming to life from his phone.
“God damn it, Cas. You could’ve had me. You did have me, you idiot. You had me. I thought you knew it.”
They’ve never talked about putting a label on it. Maybe Cas has been scared that Dean would get spooked and call the whole thing off. It probably isn’t fair for Dean to refuse to communicate when Cas has enough trouble dealing with simple emotions as it is, but the whole ‘being with a guy’ thing is new to him too.
“Yeah, well.” He rubs at the back of his neck. “I’m here now, so. There’s something I wanted to tell you. I don’t really have the right words for it, though—”
Castiel watches from the corner of the room, silent as Dean and Cas speak softly. These two have had seven additional years together compared to him and his Dean, and it shows. Dean leans into Cas’ gentle hand where it rests on his side as they talk, he doesn’t complain about personal space or bitch at Cas about anything. He just nods in agreement at whatever Cas mutters, and turns to Castiel.
Dean stares at him. Then, he’s moving towards him and there are hands cupping his face and lips pressing forcefully against his. He’s too stunned to react before Dean pulls away.
“Cas—” Cas turns on him, stepping away from the door and drawing the attention of the nurse at the front desk, as well as the other people in the waiting room.
“No, I don’t think so,” Sam says. His stomach settles slightly.
“Don’t call me that.”
“It just is,” Cas says finally.
“Oh,” Cas says simply. Dean freezes in place, unsure of whether Cas is going to tell him there’s no need. He doesn’t.
“Yeah, as long as you’ll unwrap it for me as I go.” Cas nods, pulling back the paper and handing it to Dean. Dean grabs it and takes a grateful, albeit messy, bite. He makes a noise of approval and goes for another bite almost before he has swallowed.
“No, sir,” comes Garth’s voice immediately. “I’m driving the last car. Still in line. Over.”
“Charlie, shut up,” Dean snaps, shoving her again and lunging for the remote to turn it up.
“And you didn’t correct it.”
“I can’t believe you just laughed at me when I proposed to you, you dick,” he mutters. Cas chuckles again, the happy tears welling up again.
“It’s not exactly morning,” Benny points out, gesturing at the darkness that still surrounds them.
“‘Course I got you back, dumbass,” Dean replies, not unkindly. “What’d you figure out?”
Dean gasps in mock offense, but he swings his feet a little, and Cas recognizes his Send Noods socks.
“Croat,” Dean says quietly. He stares at her as she tilts her head awkwardly, surveying the cars, and slowly makes her way toward them. With heavy movements, he reaches for his gun, and then the handle on the car door.
He walks by the kitchen too, and he can see the beer that Sam had snagged from him sitting on the table. He stares at it, chewing on his lip. He could grab it. Nobody would know. It’s just a beer, it barely even counts as alcohol at this point. He wouldn’t even get buzzed from just one. His hand closes around the neck of the bottle before he has even realized that he stepped into the room. It’s still cold.
“What about me?” Dean uncaps another bottle with his hand and lifts the beer to his mouth.
“I wanted you to know that because- you need to understand that it doesn’t matter if I was gay or- or bi or whatever. It didn’t matter because it just wasn’t an option for me Cas. My dad he- I think we pretty much established the fact that he was a jerk.” He says, chuckling nervously. “But- besides being a jerk, he was also very old-school. Boys don’t cry, man up, don’t be a pussy, the whole ordeal. And Cas I- You need to know I don’t even know if I- If I realized back then that I could also be attracted to boys or if that part of me was so repressed that I couldn’t even see it myself. Loads of internalized homophobia you know.”
They all decided to settle for a lunch outside and Dean being the ‘meat-man’, he’s obviously in charge of the barbecue. He turns the ribs on the shelf and jumps with surprise when his brother comes to him and hands him a beer. Dean uncaps it and takes a quick sip while keeping a close eye on the meat. “How you’re doing Dean? And I mean how are you feeling, really? Bobby told me it was a rough couple of months for you.”
