“John,” Sherlock said, eyes snapping open just as John was tucking the blanket around him.
Father fiddles with the ring on his hand. Daddy's also wearing a new ring. It's shinier than the old ring - the one with Mom - and it's a bit strange seeing it on Daddy's hand. Mr. Angelo comes back and I get macaroni cheese. Daddy orders for Father, because Father never likes to eat.
Greg laughed as he pulled his lover up to kiss him on the lips. "Make yourself comfortable I'll be right back." He smiled even as Mycroft growled at him. He didn't want to get out of bed but he did need to go to the bathroom.
After a few second John started to groaned and thrust back into the digits lodged inside of him "M-More..." He groaned as Sherlock started to add another finger to the two that were already inside of him.
John grinned and threw his arms around his lover’s shoulders.
"Oh relax you'll like it."
"They scare everyone."
"Did they really just kick us out of the living room?" Sherlock asked suddenly finding himself his john and his brother in the kitchen. "Those children of yours talk people around in circles Sherlock; pretty sure they either got that from you or Mycroft…" John remarked as he kept one eye on the living room. "I don't know what she's saying to them but Lucian is pale and shaking…" John trailed off making his lover frown. "Lily…I've seen that look on many people's faces but Sherlock…those people were heading to war."
“Leave my kids alone.” Sherlock sighed, already tired of her actions and motioned for the kids to follow him.
*Duh Da Duh Da Duh Da*
Alright I know this is not a comedy but why would she pick out a sad movie? Ah I see the sad movie is for my benefit if the looks Lucian kept shooting at me is any hint…But how. Wait she purposely sat in the chair with her brother…how is a sad movie and them sitting together helping me? Ah I see she is trying to get John (not that I need any help) perhaps a little closer? Sherlock thought as He moved even closer to his friend. "What are you doing?" his friend snapped quietly at him. "They look comfortable and I wanted to try it…" He blurted out then mentally patted himself on the back at the lie that flew from his lips. "You mean Lily and Lucian?" John whispered back and turning to look at the two.
"You never know Lil." John said with a smile. He had started watching Doctor Who with the girl and so far she loved the show but hated the change in doctors, saying it was a 'cop out' to ending the show.
John and Sherlock had a week of bliss before they started with the details of the wedding. First was the date which brought up the questions of the suits. If they had the wedding in the spring or summer the suits would have to be pretty light weight. But if it was in the fall or winter, they would have to be thicker. But that all depended on if they wanted the venue to be outside of not. And if they had it outside would it be in a tent or an open air wedding? If it was open air then what would they do if it rained?
John and Sherlock lay together in a warm cocoon of limbs when they woke up for their first day in Ireland. "Good morning husband." John grinned at Sherlock. "Good morning husband." He smiled back and pulled him impossibly closer. "Ouch."
Sherlock sighed at the doctors (totally inadequate) explanation of his feelings. "I thought you were supposed to be good with feelings."
"I thought they would have asked for something more...elaborate." Moriarty sighed as he shook his head in confusion. "Go out and see what they're doing would you?"
“Called us brats”
"What? Why would he do that? OH! I get it! If Mycroft sets up a pretend threat then Sherlock and his doctor would automatically blame me! Then he could spirit the twins away and I would never have gotten a hold of them! It's brilliant!" Jim said and clasped his hands together.
"We are in need of a car." Sherlock told the attendant at the car rental place.
"So it is just a figment of my imagination then."
They had decided on two cakes for the reception. One cake for them and the kids and the other for the guests. The guests cake was a three tiered round cake in a light blue frosting with violet roses adorning the sides. They had had two grooms on top of the cake made special to look like them but the twins thought it was creepy. ("Great now you can throw each other around with no evidence of domestic abuse"-Lily) so they had replaced them with two regular grooms. Their cake, however, was different in that it had been molded to look like an army medical kit. The icing had been dyed the same forest green as the actual kit. On top of the med-kit laying on its side was a magnifying glass. The magnifying glass was the same size and shape as an old style glass, the rim was made of hardened fondant that spiraled into a large brown handle made of rolled chocolate. The cake itself was a honey butter cream icing with vanilla cake and looked delicious.
He never got to finish that sentence as the twins threw themselves at him and wrapped themselves around him in a hug, both babbling their thanks to him.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“See what you did?”
"I don't know it's like this secret twin language they have going. And I swear they are plotting against me." Moran snarled as he dropped into a chair making the criminal mastermind blink. "Don't be ridiculous Sebby. They're twelve; they can't plot against a mouse at this point in their lives."
Kyle and Lucian chased Lily through the house and into the backgarden where the girl turned on her pursuers. "You'll never take me alive!" she shouted then her eyes went wide as she saw a shadowy figure step out behind a bush to slam the butt of a semi-auntomatic into the back of Kyles head. "Lucian! RUN!" she screamed but he too was knocked unconscious before he could move. "I think I will take you alive, now are you going to come easy? Or do I have to shoot your brother?" The tall blond man smiled as he stepped forward, gun still trained on Lucian.
John chuckled. "Maybe I will. What's Mycroft's full name then?"
Sherlock smiled again. "I love it."
"Sherlock." John smiled, after hanging his coat up. "What are you doing?"
I don't know why she's proud of them, but I'm happy for them. I hug both of them to show my happiness and because hugs spread happiness. Then, the three of us go to Angelo's for dinner.
"No, because I don't abuse my body like you do," John said. They took a seat within the heated ambulance. The paramedics were busy with the suspect, who was frighteningly pale and wasn't breathing. Sherlock wouldn't stop shivering, and it was worrying John. "Look, come here." John pulled Sherlock into his arms, hoping his body heat could warm Sherlock faster.
"I-" Sherlock shook his head, keeping his gaze low. "Nothing."
He ate while he waited. He sent another message. By the time his lunch break was almost over, Sherlock still hadn’t replied. John sighed and went to find his manager. He couldn’t leave little Rosie all alone.
It was another boring day of John at work, Rosie at school, and Sherlock without any cases. Sherlock decided to browse John's laptop. He liked reading the drafts of John's blog posts and seeing how many changes he could make before John noticed.
Sherlock tilted his head to the side. "Well, I imagine it'd be something sentimental."
"Hm… Say that to Mycroft," Sherlock said.
"God," Daddy is saying, shaking his head while still giggling, "I never would have thought. Ten years ago, I never would have thought we'd be back here. Married."
John shrugged. For some reason, he didn't really want anyone else calling Sherlock by his full name. "Well, if we use it too often, he'll get used to it, and it won't be as effective."
"It gets boring by myself," Sherlock said and lifted John's hand to his shoulder while placing his own on John's shoulder blade. "Dance with me, John."
Sherlock looked at John and cleared his throat, before slipping the ring up.
"How do you-" John shook his head. "Nevermind. Thanks. Good night, Sherlock. Don't stay up too late."
No, no. Not at all.
Sherlock chuckled.
Sherlock laughed, causing John’s head to bob up. “You would think that, wouldn’t you?”
John nearly gagged as he was rereading what he'd written and began deleting all the random, extra lines when he noticed there was something at the bottom.
John nodded. "It's surprisingly effective."
John helped Rosie in the bath, careful not to get any water on her knee. Then he wrapped her knee in fresh bandages.
“Alright.” John tightened his arms around her. “You’re okay. It doesn’t hurt anymore.”
Sherlock liked the idea of that.
"Good-night, Daddy."
Daddy cuts me pieces of his chicken. He cuts some more for Father. Father eats slowly and keeps staring at Daddy. Then he takes some of my macaroni.
John chuckled and stepped closer. "Of course." Sherlock's arms tentatively wrapped around John, as if he was afraid he'd break John by touching him. John patted his back, while saying, "Silly."
John looked at him. "You realize that we're not in a relationship, well, in
John pulled the ring out from his jacket pocket but kept it hidden within his fist. "Can't you guess?"
"Hey!" I say and hit the table with my fork in hand.
"Well, you're an idiot who jumps into the Thames in October," John said, as the paramedics wrapped them up in warm towels and blankets. "I don't trust an idiot like that to do anything." Sherlock rolled his eyes, and John rubbed the towel through Sherlock's hair. "If you catch a cold, I'm the one who has to deal with it."
"Yes?" Sherlock didn't move. John rubbed his face, remembered Sherlock's response, and regathered his courage.
Perhaps hugs weren’t so mediocre after all. Perhaps physical affection could be rather enjoyable, and comforting, not that Sherlock would voice such thoughts. After all, he wasn’t an emotional, sentimental human being.
"So what's the big deal then? It's not like he really meant it, and I'm sure Carol didn't mean it either," John said, hugging her.
John nodded and looked at the ring in his hand again, then at the ring on his hand. He took the new one off and slipped the old one back on. It was a familiar weight and presence. He glanced back up at Sherlock. "Can I see it?"
“It doesn’t hurt anymore, right?”
“Well, good night then,” John said, stepping towards the stairs.
John grinned. "William Scott Sherlock Holmes." Sherlock missed a beat, and they stumbled over each other's feet for a second. His eyes darted up to John's, and John could see that he was worried he'd done something wrong. "You lovely human being. I'm going to tell Greg and Molly that you cooked dinner. They're not going to believe it."
“It doesn’t hurt, Rosie. It’s all in your head,” Sherlock said. “Now, what do you want to do? Shall we have a music battle?” He reached under the table to drag her small keyboard out.
“No no, that’s fine.” John held a hand up. “Thanks, though.” Sherlock glanced up. “Really, Sherlock. I-” He shook his head. “I don’t know what I’d do without you.”
“Incredible,” John said.
Tomorrow, I'll ask Father how to use a memory palace, so I can remember this day forever.
“Are you sure?” John stood up.
"The ring," Sherlock said. "What did you engrave on it?"
"Will you, John Hamish Watson, marry me?" Sherlock said.
"Here, you can have the rest of my plate," Father says and pushes his plate over. I get on my knees to reach over and stab some of his pasta to eat it. It's pretty good. Daddy is good at ordering good food.
If John was preparing something - even if it were these atrocious poems - Sherlock should prepare something to.
John sat up. “What happened? I heard your heartbeat increase and-” He caught a glimpse of Sherlock’s pale face in the dark, the haunted, wild look in his gray eyes. “Sherlock.”
John’s own breathing evened out and he was fast asleep in five minutes.
"What did you do with my ring?"
We start walking back home. I take Daddy's hand and Father's hand, and they let me swing while we walk. It's a lot of fun. They pick me up and I go flying through the air. But they get tired after a while, and then it's not as fun cause I have to walk.
"Sorry," Sherlock said.
. Every unedited word John had tossed upon the word document last night.
"What does it look like?"
"Alright."
"William Scott Sherlock Holmes!" John said, yanking Sherlock towards the nearest boat launch. Someone had tossed down a life buoy, which John grabbed and threw towards Sherlock.
She nodded. “A little bit.”
"But why?" John glanced over.
"Using your full name?"
They smile at each other, and it's very cute. I might have squealed, but I'm not sure. Then they hug, and I get to throw my flower petals in the air. Mrs. Hudson coos, and the three of us clap. Daddy's cheeks are red. He must be feeling shy about getting married in front of us. Mr. Lestrade says congrats, and Mrs. Hudson kisses their cheeks and talks about how proud she is of them.
John shook his head and stood. “No. It’s fine. I just needed to use the toilet-”
John stared at him, then laughed. “Sherlock, I’m not going to-”
“Sometimes, I still see you dead,” John said.
So John just rested his head against Sherlock's shoulder and closed his eyes too. "I love you."
“Hm. Very funny,” John said. Rosie sniffled, and he began rocking her back and forth. He glanced down at her. “It doesn’t hurt anymore, right?” Sherlock sat down in his armchair.
"Small talk." Sherlock shrugged.
John smiled up at him. "You're asking me about my day?"
"I almost got him, John," Sherlock said, pushing against John's grip. "He's got rocks in his pockets and boots. Let me go. I saw him. I have to go and save him, or he'll be too deep under."
“What happened?” Sherlock said, stepping into the living room. He saw Rosie sitting in John’s lap, cradled in his arms, still teary-eyed and weary. “Ah.”
It's another one of their secret telepathy jokes. It's when one of them tells the other a joke through telepathy and then they laugh about it together. I don't know why they don't tell me the joke, maybe because I don't know telepathy, but I do know that I like it when they smile and laugh. Especially Father, because he doesn't laugh often. So I always smile, like I heard the telepathy joke too.
“I don’t want to,” Rosie said with a small pout.
“Okay, okay. I’ll call your Godfather, and I’ll see if he can come pick you up. Okay? Just stay strong, Rosie. You can do this. Think about other things, and it won’t hurt anymore, okay?”
John shook his head. “Forget it, Sherlock.” He turned towards the stairs.
Sherlock was home after solving a case for Lestrade about an hour after John and Rosie were back.
John was awake about three hours later, though, with shaken nerves and faded images of a bloodied body. He laid in bed, tossing and turning, for an hour before heading downstairs to use the toilet. Sherlock was still lying on the sofa, eyes shut but hands steepled together. John watched him breathe for a while, before using the toilet and returning with a throw blanket to cover Sherlock.
When we're finished, Father tries to hail a cab but Daddy says, "Let's just walk back. We need to digest."
Daddy nods, and they stare at each other, the way Matt and Carol look at each other in class. Father keeps talking, "I know I don't deserve your trust, or your kindness, or your forgiveness, or your companionship, and certainly not you as my husband. But if you will accept me as yours, I will do my best to follow my vow."
“You know Rosie hates naps. How’d you get her to sleep? You couldn’t have exhausted her with the story of your case. And you didn’t tell her too many details, right?”
John was beginning to get the hang of this, although it was strange to be dancing with another man. They were in 221B, and no one would see. So John didn't mind. He'd done crazier things, he supposed, than dancing with another man.
"Why..." John decided not to continue that thought. "I was going to cook dinner, though."
“I just did,” Sherlock said with a frown. John sighed and sat down on the edge of the sofa near Sherlock’s feet. “Was it a war nightmare or a Mary nightmare? Or maybe even a Rosie nightmare? Quite possible seeing as she was injured today and you’re rather protective.”
Sherlock waved at him to leave. “Then how about I tell you about my latest case?”
"A very good day," I say. He smiles back. "What about you, Daddy?"
Sherlock lowered his head back down, and a silent minute passed before he adjusted his position to make more room. “John. Would you like to try it out?”
Sherlock snorted. "Don't compare me to Mycroft."
Sherlock stopped twirling in the living room and glanced at John. There was classical music playing, and John had thought it was Sherlock on his violin. "What does it look like?"
“Rosie, dear, be strong. It’s just a few more hours, okay? I’m at work right now. I can’t just leave to pick you up.”
“Whatever it was about,” John said in a whisper. “It wasn’t real.”
"People are going to talk, John. Aren't you worried?" Sherlock's tone was harsh and mocking. His whole body was trembling.
"Wait until tomorrow evening at least."
Sherlock sat on the ground and hid his face with his hand, ruffling his hair. “Nothing. Go back to sleep, John.”
"Rosie wouldn't dance with me," Sherlock said. "She's throwing a fit right now in your room." So John went upstairs to check on Rosie, who cried to him about her awful day because Carol said something mean to her and Matt agreed with Carol.
"You keep waking Rosie up when you do that," John said.
John read the "letter," or whatever it might be, twice. Then he took a screenshot of it, took a picture of his screen with his phone, and then uploaded the document to the cloud. Sherlock rarely showed his feelings; he was rarely so tender and honest. Sometimes, John doubted how much he meant to the detective, and this could serve as the perfect reminder for when Sherlock was being particularly insufferable.
Mr. Angelo comes around and gives us menus and smiles at me.
"Sure," John said. Sherlock looked him in the eye, and the smile vanished. "Seriously? He cares that much about it?"
"Hm?" Sherlock was in the middle of an experiment in the kitchen.
"I can swim, you know," Sherlock said with a snarl, but he followed John out of the river anyway. They were shivering, and their lips and skin were tinted blue. John stripped Sherlock out of his coat and his collared shirt. "I can undress myself, you know," Sherlock said and pulled John's coat and jumper off.
Sherlock nodded. "As much as he cares for his sweets, if not more."
“How about I put her on the phone?” the nurse said, and he agreed that that would be a good idea.
John jumped. “Jesus, Sherlock! If you’re awake, say something.”
"Will you consider it?"
"Please, you're already digesting. Walking won't make you digest," Father says, rolling his eyes.
"Are hug parties going to be a thing now?" John said.
Sherlock reread that line. He knew they didn't talk about the 2 years that he was gone, but he didn't talk about it because John didn't really ask. He'd told John that he'd taken down Moriarty's network but never the specifics. Never about the undercover work, the tracking, the disguises, the languages, the people. Never about the times he was captured and nearly killed.
Sherlock grinned, chuckling. “Ooh you are learning fast, my dear.”
"Yes, do keep up," Sherlock said, and John laughed.
"Yes." Sherlock nodded once and continued to sweep across the room, arms outstretched as if he had a partner.
"Sherlock, we're married. Whatever you want to say, just say it," John said. He could see Sherlock's Adam's apple bob as he swallowed.
Sherlock gaped at the screen. John had strange trains of thought, and this could be the strangest one Sherlock had ever witnessed. "I know I have gray hairs, but I don't pluck them out," he muttered and read on.
“I’m serious,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock nodded. His back was to John, so John stepped over to catch a glimpse of Sherlock's face. It was impassive but there was a knowing glimmer in his eyes. John couldn't help the smile on his face. "Did your parents ever use your full name when they were yelling at you?"
"Yes, I know. I'm a doctor, remember?" It's one of Daddy's favorite lines, like how Father likes to say he's a high-something something-path. I don't remember the middle words, and Daddy says I don't need to because it's a lie anyway.
Daddy blinks and clears his throat. "You do deserve me, you git," he says, and I try not to giggle or tell anyone that Daddy just said a bad word. He looks at his shoes, which I like because they're so shiny, and then he smiles and looks back up at Father and says, "I vow to make sure you eat and sleep enough, to help you out on cases, and to save your life as many times as I need to. I vow to be there for you, Sherlock. No matter what, no matter when, no matter why. Always, like you've done for me."
“I’m really going to go then,” John said, standing by the doorway.
Sherlock shrugged. “It was an educated guess.”
"Then, you should know that this is also a fact." John dropped the ring in Sherlock's palm. He held it up to read the words engraved within:
“Good night,” Sherlock said, softly.
Greg smiled. "Do you think I could give it a try?"
"Don't be ridiculous," Sherlock said.
"What does your ring look that?"
And for once, the three words were enough.
“It.” John swallowed, his voice thick, and said his next words in a slow, measured way. “It was a Sherlock nightmare.”
“Yet you sat down and told me about a nightmare.”
Sherlock scooted to the side to make room for John. “I’m alive. Come hear the proof.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "Yes, John, I do understand metaphors."
Sherlock jerked to a start and stumbled off the couch, eyes wide and gasping. John lifted his head up and stared at Sherlock. “What’s wrong?”
Rosie jumped with a smile and clapped her hands. “Was it a murder?”
"Oh God," Sherlock said. "This is an abomination."
"I'm more worried about you dying of hypothermia," John said. "Idiot." Sherlock was quiet. The shivering stopped, and John relaxed. Sherlock would be alright.
"It's all cause Matt likes Carol," Rosie said.
"What, and you won't catch one?" Sherlock said.
"Wow." John kissed Rosie's forehead. "Well, Rosamund Mary Watson, let's hope I don't have to say that often, hm?" She giggled and he kissed her forehead again.
"Your mum seems like a sweet lady, though. Can't imagine what it'd take to get her angry," John said.
John found his old ring on the mantelpiece the day after the wedding ceremony. It was shinier than before, and when he inspected it, he found an engraving on the inside that read:
"No you didn't," Daddy says with a smile.
"Did you have a good day?" Daddy asks, and I nod.
"You're dancing," John said.
"Wait, you cooked dinner?" John's forehead creased in disbelief. He glanced towards the kitchen to make sure nothing had burned down. There were plates of what looked like curry on the table.
"Sherlock," John said.
"I didn't engrave anything on it, if that's what you're wondering," Sherlock said.
Sherlock cleared his throat and stared at the man's chin. "I'm. Sorry."
"You said you wanted to make it clear that you were in a new marriage, but you are still sentimental about Mary and want to keep wearing your ring from her, in part because you've grown accustomed to it. So it's easiest to add a mark of mine on your old ring."
“John.”
John’s gaze snapped to Sherlock’s. “Try what out? If you still have-”
“Daddy.” Rosie was sobbing. “Come pick me up. It hurts. It hurts so much.”
John stepped over to fish the band out. It was a simple gold band like John's but newer and smaller. "Can I take it for a day?"
He decided it must be something that emotional, sentimental human beings liked. Either that, or it was genetic, because John also appreciated hugs. Mary did too, and Molly perhaps, now that Sherlock thought about it. Irene didn’t seem as much of a hugger, though. Lestrade… Why Lestrade was one of the few times when Sherlock had been hugged. That meant Lestrade liked hugs, otherwise he wouldn’t willingly hug someone, much less Sherlock.
“Not that.” He rolled his eyes. “The heartbeat.”
A week? Sherlock checked the calendar. What was a week away? February 14th. He frowned. Valentine's Day. John had been preparing for Valentine's Day, even though they'd never done much on that so-called holiday. Sherlock knew John and Rosie loved the day after, when they could bring home lots of on-sale chocolate.
"Do what?" John glanced at him.
“My hands are hurting too,” she said and showed them the cuts on her palms.
"Again may I ask the point of the history lesson?"
Sherlock's shoulders sagged in defeat as his little lover used his army voice. "Alright just.. sit there and I'll...go and get it."
Sherlock carefully made his way up stairs, balancing a bowl of soup with one hand and a bottle of water with the other. "Lily? I have soup." He said as he pushed his way through the door.
"Don't do it again." Jim responded then kicked them out of the office.
"What kind?" Lucian asked as Lily started poking at the tea cup with a finger. "I think he meant explosions…" Mycroft announced. "Oh we're fine with those…" Lily said as she tried to dump her tea into Mycroft's.
“It starts out find, Lucian and I are swimming in a pond when I suddenly can’t find him. I look around to find him sitting on the beach and when I try to swim to him I can’t get there. The water turns thick like I’m swimming through jelly and I looked down to see the water has turned to blood and suddenly I’m drowning in it.”
Both John and Sherlock were too busy laughing to stop them. So each of them grabbed one of the twins and dragged them to the terminal to present their tickets.
"Alright Lily you will be sitting here…Lucian I want you over at that desk…I would rather you not infect my class with your behavior…god knows what you two do behind closed doors but your… lifestyle outside of the class is not my concern though if I hear any word of your…fathers you will have detention. I don't want their homosexuality to infect my students…" He sneered and sat the twins as far away from each other as humanly possible.
Moriarty was sitting at his desk while Sebastian filled him in on the 'special' assignment he was sent on. He had finished it quickly and quietly and had come back in a hurry. Moriarty was getting bored listening to his assassins voice drone on about the assignment.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sandra was sitting at her desk trying to get Anderson to leave her alone when she saw a small girl lean out from the adjoining corridor only to press her fingers to her lips and wink. She didn't know who this girl was but it was obvious that she did not want Anderson to spot her. 'What the hell?' she thought as Anderson spoke. 'Well I think I'd better be getting back."
“Can we do this by ourselves?”
"Sherlock?"
"Lily-lie…" Lucian whispered as he walked over to grab one of her hands and press it to his cheek.
I did not have her do anything. I forgot about it while she did not. But doesn't it get to you that your puzzle was solved by a fifteen year old girl? SH
After getting the twins settled (which was a feat in of itself as Sherlock was absolutely convinced that children needed a bed time story to go to sleep and only after arguing with john for an hour about 'age appropriateness' did he finally relent) John and Sherlock settled into bed. "Okay remind me again why my bed was burned and then thrown out?" John asked as his friend kept trying to snuggle with him. "It was too big to drag in here." Sherlock remarked as his blogger kept wiggling away. "okay…will you stop that? What are you doing?" John finally snapped as Sherlock managed to gain a hold on his waist and yank him back.
Mycroft had a pleasure of watching his younger brother's eyes fill with horror and the blood drain out of his face.
And the pity starts. "I'm fine Greg...I just need to get back to pick up some clothes." He said as he slid off the bed and struggled not to wince at his pain in his leg. "Pick up some clothes? Why would you need to do that?"
"Why are you doing that?"
I found a man I can trust
He found Lily two inches away from the skull staring intently into the eye sockets and Lucian eyeing the moose head.
Both teens just sighed and went to grab their light jackets.
“Alright I guess I have to go and pick up the twins.” John sighed making his partner (in more ways than one) frown. “Why so soon?” He asked then took the phone out of John’s hand where he was currently making motions like he was going to smash it.
"Then tell them that."
"Yea." He sighed and nuzzled his face into Sherlock's collar bone. "I love you too by the way." he sighed then glared as his pillow moved. "Now...Not so much."
The man was nice enough to give the twins a large jug of water and some food in a bag before kicking them off his land. He might not have had a good grasp of the English language but that did not mean that he didn't know that trouble was following them.
"Yea,"
“Do what?”
You: I love doctor who
Lily just phased out the woman's voice as she tried to decipher the meaning behind Trymmans words. "Amalee enough, Lily may have a flowery name my dear but if I'm not mistaken that is all you have in common besides gender. Ah, Travis, would you please see them to the drawing room I believe some tea is in order after your journey. Oh and don't worry about your bags we'll get someone to bring them to your rooms. Now John, tell me how you and the twins are fairing with my son."
"Lily?"
He wont take it
Alright people I'm extending the story a chapter and the next one will be the wedding then the honeymoon. Mainly because I was up till two AM and don't feel like doing anymore research tonight...and I have to be up at six tomorrow. So yea ending it here...
From: Boss
John turned his head very slowly to stare down Sherlock. “What was it that Lily says all the time? I’ll do it by magic.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Alright now we go shopping.”
"Oh hey Kyle...sorry I was a million miles away." Lucian grinned at his friend who punched him in the shoulder.
Sugar glass is a thing no idea if it's edible...
“Alright your father and I have been talking and we both think it’s best if you two see a therapist.”
At the loch they were met by a multitude of stares and some laughter at either Lily or Lucian's t-shirts. John and Sherlock sat down to talk while the twins walked away to explore after showing their fathers they had their phones.
Mycroft blushed and gave a nod of his head. "I am sorry for springing this…inquisition on you."
"Sherlock said leverage against him."
From Lily
“But..”
car instead of having her almost faint from the heat." Greg shot back and Mycroft took the time to actually look at his boyfriend.
"Yea…" John blushed still not looking at Sherlock. "We can bite? That's allowed?" the detective asked suddenly making John frown. "Well as long as there isn't any blood involved…yes…" He said thoughtfully then jumped when Sherlock bit him none to gently on his uninjured shoulder making him groan in pleasure. Who knew that biting could be so erotic? The scrape of teeth down your throat mixed with the soft wetness of the tongue tracing your jugular vein…then the sudden pressure of teeth on your skin? Erotic.
"I just wanted to apologize… Luce and I didn't know that we were freaking you out." She whispered as she took a small step back. "We were just curious that's all."
Sherlock turned to find three pairs of wide eyes staring at him in total adoration. "What?" he asked making them smile. "Papa bears got nothing on you!" Lily said making him blush. "Right…I'm going to call Mycroft about this…Go and…entertain yourselves." Sherlock responded as he slowly walked backwards into the kitchen.
“Interesting it’s the female that needs to be watched out for. She’s highly protective of the male.” He thought then started to speak again. “Where do you want to begin? And don’t even try that whole criminal mastermind thing with me, I don’t scare as easily as the girl did.”

Afterwards John and Sherlock were sitting in the living room while the twins did the dishes. "I still don't see why…" Sherlock began but stopped at Johns flare. "Chores Sherlock…every child does chores this is the way it goes…"John sighed blowing across the top of his tea cup before taking a sip and ignoring his friends pout. "Fine…what do we do afterwards?" Sherlock asked as he scooted closer to John. "I don't know see if they want to watch a movie I guess…" John remarked not noticing Sherlock sliding closer towards him. "What movie?" Sherlock asked knowing that his friend was trying to ignore him. "I don't know why don't you ask them what they want to watch?" John snapped finally turning towards Sherlock who was much closer then he realized.
"Yes."
Soon enough he was bombarded by questions from the backseat about the surrounding area.
It was pink. Eye blindingly pink. She was lying on a bright pink bed with princess pillows with crowns scattered over the comforter. There were stuffed unicorns at the end of the bed and across the room was a shelf full of creepy porcelain dolls. On another wall was a bright pink bookshelf and in the middle of the room was a pink table with pink chairs and a tea set on the table. The room itself looked as though it had been painted with pepto bismol. Curiosity got the better of her and she walked over to the bookshelf to investigate what kinds of books they gave her to pass the time with. Grimm's fairy tales, the pink fairy book, the princess and the pea, the prince and the pauper, the bookshelf was full of fairy tales.
"You don't fuck with our family."
"I think we're good Lil." Lucian whispered and lifted himself up then turned to help Lily climb up. "Alright now that he's off our tail the town is this way." Lily said as she grabbed her brothers hand and started walking towards the western sun. They would have to either walk fast or find shelter relatively soon as the sun was just starting to set.
"An experiment, I'm relatively sure that human contact will decrease the flight or fight reaction in case you have a night terror…" Sherlock smiled inwardly as he felt his john weigh the options concerning Sherlock wrapped around him. "Alright…but if you wake up with bruises and what not I tried to warn you and you will not pout about it and I get another bed…alright?" The army doctor reasoned gently with his detective…besides Sherlock was rather…warm.
“I can’t see any more flour…”
"Are you going to do the whole 'do you want chicken or fish' thing?" Lily asked as she poked at one of her fathers expiraments.
Everyone took a bite then signed as Lucian was the one to grab for the milk. "Wow I didn't know they made glue that sweet!"
The twins sent each other confused and shocked looks as the landlady kept rambling.
"Oh for heaven's sake I DID NOT KIDNAP THEM!" Sherlock shouted making everyone flinch. "Those are MY CHILDREN!" He was getting highly annoyed with the train of conversation but even more so at how they were scaring his children.
Sherlock gave a curt nod and Greg tried not to laugh as the Consulting Detective imitated his Blogger. "Alright then, I should be off. I wonder what the kids have cajoled John into now…last week they convinced him that yes they could bring a puppy home…Named it Gladstone and the thing ate my one of my shoes."
"Sir they're fifteen."
Sherlock skipped over to grasp her by the shoulders. "Funny you should mention that...I know who wants to g-"
"I love you John. And you're mine...MINE!" Sherlock roared as his body poured into Johns forcing the doctor to follow him over that cliff and into bliss.
"As I understand it neither you nor the twins have left the flat for several days and I am calling to find out why that is."
"So we brought him home."
"Err…Hello…" John whispered awkwardly trying not to tremble as Sherlock's face was only a few centimeters from his own, which made it difficult. "Hello." Sherlock smiled as John blushed.
"We'll find them later right now you need to calm down… Mycroft what are their names?" John asked as gently as he could. "Lucian and Lily…they are fifteen years old, Lily is a vegetarian while Lucian is not and even though they dress…differently they are very much alike. They are both highly protective of each other and if they think that their twin could be harmed by something…or someone they will not hesitate to either take out the threat or remove themselves from the perceived danger…as you have seen." Mycroft scolded earning a glare from both John and Sherlock.
Sherlock and John nodded emphatically while Greg smiled up at his boyfriend.
~~__~~!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everyone turned to find Kyle Lestrade at the threshold, pale and shaking with unshed tears in his eyes. "Why are you apologizing?" Sherlock demanded, honestly confused as to why.
“Lily, Lucian…what did they do?” John asked with a sigh, he had been so busy with minding their carry ons and watching Sherlock that he had missed the twins sneaking off.
"LUCIAN!" Sherlock grinned as he came from around his lab to give his son a hug. "Hey Luce! How was class?" John grinned.
Sherlocks heart melt at the sight. “You two were in the air tower?” He asked amazed at them. “Why didn’t you tell them?”
"Yes I remembered watching a documentary with Father on triangulation and how if you had pictures of everywhere around a place you can find it through the landmarks.
“We’ll see tomorrow.”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Wait...I know this smell...It's...God what is it?...Olives?" She asked shaking her head to clear the memories.
"No continual heat, or freezing of items."
“We served together in Afghanistan.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"John Watson, I give you this ring in token of my commitment and love."
"I don't care what you want...You have to eat." Sherlock growled as he was losing his patience with the teenager. "Lily sweetheart...Please?" John asked as he came in to the room and gave Sherlock a pointed stare. "I know your throat hurts but the heat will help it and I brought up some medicine."
"W-why?" Sally asked gently.
Good evening headmaster Carey this is Sherlock Holmes, Lily and Lucian's father
"Oh holy crap you speak English!" Lucian grinned and threw his arms around the boy. "You are so my favorite person! We need help, we were separated from our parents and then this guy shows up with a gun and sort of brought us here. But we escaped and can we use your phone?"
After Sherlock went upstairs to his offspring John tried to get back to the chores only to be interrupted by the phone.
“Should I run?” “What? No…What that lawyer said in that room…”
Text Message from: Unknown
“No not bribe I think of it like this, the kids don’t have criminal records, Mycroft wasn’t involved, and we can get anything here…By the by kids. How was the air tower?” He asked absentmindedly.
I embrace my fears
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately, the employees of Scotland yard noticed the change as well. Especially when he brought the kids in to meet Lestrade properly.
"Guess he really told on us." Lucian remarked quietly to his sister but she only placed a hand on his arm and nod her head towards Sebastian's room. "Watch this."
“What do you think?”
10:43...10:44...10:45...This clock needs to go faster. Sherlock thought to himself as he glared at the offending object. "Oh stuff it I'm checking on her now."
“No, I did not. I understand it’s entirely unexpected but…I’m not sure how to say this.” Sherlock said as he lifted a hand to his chin and looked a little confused for a second. “Apparently I am a father.”
Greg smiled as Mycroft finally got the the heart of his discomfort. "My, they are pretty much self sufficient at the moment. Just give them some space, let them get settled and don't forget they're there. That's about it really."

"Really?"

Lily sighed and pressed her forehead to her brothers. "Lucian…there are steps to be taken love…We made them sit together yes, now we just need to soften John towards Sherlock. It'll be great, trust me John's a doctor."
Thank you to all who have commented on this word, you all get a cookie for the effort :)
"Alright so everything is set, everything is ready. There will be no issues..." John muttered to himself the day before the wedding as Lily watched him pace the small hotel room. They had decided that no one was to stay at 221B baker street and both groom received their own hotel rooms (In different hotels). The twins had even decided to split up and spend the night with their parents should they need them. So far they had been right for even though John was pacing back and forth he was taking the strain better than his fiancé.
"Remind me again why we can't make a fire?"
To their surprise their mother dragged them onto the bus and then to one of the various thrift stores where they were told to ‘grab something nice.’
They had finally achieved something resembling a normal atmosphere at last.
"I'll Think about it."
Lucian rolled his eyes and reached out his hands in front of him. "It's okay I got this!" He said to his fathers and turned back to his sister to smack her gently in the back of the head. "No! bad girl!"
Sherlock's mouth was surprisingly firm but gentle at the same time and John could not help but moan at the feeling. But soon it was not enough as he swiped Sherlock's closed lips with his tongue, silently asking for entry and gasping when the detectives mouth opened to swirl his tongue with his own.
"Not helpful."
"John!" He shouted and ran over to the doctor who was hunched over himself. "Oh, hello Greg."
"Damn it."
AHOY! SMUTTINESS AHEAD!
Lucian blushed at the mans words and cleared his throat. "I…I draw…and paint…sir." He finished then looked over at his grandmother who was making his way over to his sister to pull at her shirt. "What is this?"
ashamed of their actions. John however looked dazed at everything.
...freaking out assassins...kind of self explanatory ^_^
Lily and Lucian were sitting on the couch doing their homework (For once there was no fight over who had the right answer) when John and Sherlock stormed into the flat in the middle of a heated argument.
"Sneaky Sneaky"
He couldn't help it, he chuckled making Sherlock huff in annoyance. "Sorry love, I know you're trying to comfort me and trust me the fact that your trying means the world. But I'll be fine in a while just give it time alright?" He said giving the detective a firm kiss.
John stared a minute before turning away. Well now we know who the push over is.
It will be alright Sweetheart…it going to be alright!" he soothed as he rocked his daughter in his arms. I don't care what I have to say as long as she stops leaking! He thought as she clung to him and cried.
Lily was pulling one of the boys away from her brother trying to get to him when he turned to smack her in the face.
“Well things change. But the kids are hungry and I promised dinner. You’re more than welcome to join us if you wish.” John remarked not noticing the kids gently pulling them away.
be the parents, not just I. And as for a consenting parent…I never said that I would let you speak to my children at all…” Sherlock announced as, he too, stood and gathered his belstaff. “Now I believe you will hear from our barristers, have a good day madam try not to eat any children on your way out.”
Lily and Lucian were seated in front of the couple with their fathers seated behind them. An elderly woman had taken the window seat while Sherlock had the isle.
Moriarty and Moran watched from the window as Lucian happily drew in the garden and his sister walked around taking pictures of everything.
I've finally found my way
Soon both grooms were cleaned up and Sherlock happily sucked on the magnifying glass after gleefully discovering the edible glass. "Sherlock!"
"It's a Scottish version of a lake."
"Alright so we know where we want to go…The only issue is getting there…"
“That’s not what I meant. John-“
"Myc, baby…"
ten minutes later Sherlock was free and the children were snickering from the couch. "Alright now which one of you did it?" Sherlock glared at his children who laughed and pointed to John. "John? Why?!" Sherlock demanded making the doctor smile. "You fell asleep while watching the children. Being stapled to the floor should have been the LEAST of your worries." John smiled and took another sip of his tea.
The man led them through the house and into a small library. “I had had your DNA tested and as it turns out you are the biological children of my brother Sherlock. Now I hope that you wish to meet him.”
“Already sorted.”
Lily gave her brother an odd look. "Alright let's do that. We're going to keep walking north until we hit England…Or a town."
The detective shook his head slowly still confused at what John was saying. "So we can keep the dog."
~~_~~!
The next morning the new couple woke up in complete bliss and just laid there, stroking their hands across the others skin, basking in the wonder of each other. Suddenly Sherlock noticed something…or rather noticed something was not there to be noticed. "John…Where are the children?"
Sherlock smiled as he saw his two children walk up the aisle to stand beside him. Next came Greg and Mycroft, both wearing black tuxedos adorned with purple flowers. Then came Molly and Mrs. Hudson both wearing ankle length violet dresses with icy blue edgings, they were both holding a single violet rose. Next came Kyle holding a light blue pillow on which rested two silver and gold rings. Then came his John and Sherlock lost sight of everything else as the love of his life walked up the aisle accompanied by his sister Harriet. John was wearing a dark blue suit with a purple rose boutonniere and a heather grey handkerchief in the pocket. His undershirt was a light blue colour and his tie was a heather greyish. His hair had been gelled (against his will) to stand up in small spikes and the only thing that adorned him besides that was a smile on his face which lit up his blue eyes. Likewise John could not take his eyes off of Sherlock who was dressed in a dark purple suit with a violet undershirt and an ice blue tie. His boutonniere was a single sprig of heather and his handkerchief was an ice blue color. He had used all his wiles to escape the mad hairdresser so his curls had not been touched by that evil person. Sherlock held out a single hand which John lovingly took as they stepped closer to the podium.
Hussy? Oh I really hate her Lily thought as she glared at the woman.
"Obviously." He tried to answer but at the look on Johns face decided to amend his answer. "I Do."
“Hopefully not as I would personally like to talk with her beforehand.” Sherlock growled barely pushed down the urge to throw something.
"I don't need your help Doctor...Why don't you go sit by some ailing person's bedside." he snarled but John only drew himself up. "I'm only trying to help Sherlock. You needn't be mean, I am not the enemy." He said making the man glare even harder.
"It's a uniform…" Lily sneered at the outfit laid out on the table. "Yes, your school requires you to wear it." John remarked mildly as he wrote out another blog. "It's hideous." The twins spoke in unison Making John shiver. "Don't care you're wearing it." He sighed then thanked whatever god made it possible for Sherlock not to be here for this fight. For if he was then the detective would undoubtedly make the argument 'if you don't like it you don't have to go' then the fight would only escalate from there.
just wanted you peoples to know that I now have a tumblr! I have no idea how to use it! but they (My friends who may or may not be imaginary) told me that I need to spread my weirdness around! So...Yea! any questions concerns and/or comments can also be relayed there were i'm sure you can comment more that once (Unlike here)....that's all!
Okay peoples, I'm ending this one here for now...It might get expanded in the future but probably not until I finish with Q's Mentor and Stalker Tendencies...wow I just realized that I only have two on going stories left...that's new hahaha. Anyways I hope you enjoy!
(See the end of the chapter for
“How are you two acclimating to living with Sherlock and John?” Lestrade asked making the detective in question glare.
Daddy and Father have always loved each other, and I've always known it. I can tell by the way they look at each other. Daddy's eyes are always soft and warm when he looks at Father or me. And Father only listens to what Daddy says, even if he makes a fuss about it. They're silly though and didn't decide to get married until now, when I'm almost seven years old.
kind of relationship, and if we get married for the benefits that that's illegal?"
“It once was,” Sherlock said in a hoarse reply.
"For how long?"
Sherlock jumped into the Thames after the suspect. He jumped in, coat, scarf, and all. John swore and jumped in too - coat, jumper, and all. He resurfaced, grasping Sherlock's arms, both gasping for air.
It was different from listening to a heartbeat with a stethoscope, as he did at work. Here, he could feel Sherlock’s warmth, feel Sherlock’s heartbeat, feel Sherlock’s breathing. John’s eyes slid shut to better focus on the sound, the steady, pounding reassurance that Sherlock was real and alive, breathing and beating, not splattered in a bloody mess on the pavement.
I decide I want ice cream when we're back home. I tell Daddy this, and he agrees, so we all have a bowl of ice cream. Then we sit down on the couch and eat it while watching the telly. Daddy tells me to brush my teeth when I'm done, so I do. When I'm back, I sit between Daddy and Father, and it's really warm. Daddy's wearing a nice, soft jumper, and Father's shirt is nice and smooth. It's very comfy. I link my arms with theirs, and listen while Father mocks the show and points out everything stupid about it and sometimes Daddy joins in, but mostly he just laughs or argues with Father.
"No, no, that was a fact," Sherlock said. "And facts aren't sentimental."
We get a booth by the door where we can see out onto the street. Daddy once told me they chased down a cabbie here. When we sit down, Father and Daddy look at each other and burst out laughing.
I don't remember falling asleep but I must have, because I wake up in Daddy's arms as he's tucking me into bed.
“Well, you’re being very strong,” he said and kissed her on the forehead. After tucking Rosie into bed, John returned to the living room, where Sherlock was putting together the data of his latest case.
Sherlock harrumphed and swept away, hands tucked in his pockets. Greg stepped over to John's side, and said, in a low voice, "Did I just see what I saw?"
John agreed. "It is a rather desperate measure."
"Yeah, Daddy," Rosie said with a fierce frown. John didn't understand. Didn't Rosie like hugs and hug parties? "It's been a thing for a long time now. Keep up, will you?"
“But it hurts to stand,” she said. He set her on her feet and wiped a few stray tears away.
"Could I hug you?" Sherlock said, in a very quiet voice.
Sherlock managed a scoff, though the tightness in his chest had yet to disappear. Had John forgotten how many lives he'd saved himself? How many times John had saved Sherlock? How every life that Sherlock had saved, past, present, and future, was a life that John had helped save as well?
Sherlock cleared his throat. "Thanks."
John flushed. Sherlock had read his terrible, cheesy poems, and he hadn't said a word about it. "Oh God." John buried his face in his hands and struggled with the overwhelming embarrassment until he decided to read the rest of what Sherlock had written. John prepared himself for a slew of criticisms.
"It was fine. Thanks for asking. If you're done with the hug, we've got dinner to make."
Sherlock smiled.
That was very John Watson, indeed. Sherlock ought to delete this document, in case it incriminated John.
“Thank goodness you’re back,” John said. “I called you and texted you, and you didn’t answer.”
The next day, John said yes.
"Sure," John said and wrapped his arms around Sherlock, patting his back. "You okay? Something happen?"
Sherlock nodded. That seemed about right. But why was John writing poetry in the first place? And who was it about? Did John meet a pretty lady who he wanted to woo? Maybe Sherlock should edit John's poetry for him.
John turned around. Sherlock peered at him with slitted eyes, still foggy from sleep.
"Poetry?" Sherlock said, and couldn't decide if he was amused, incredulous, or appalled. He opened the document and began reading.
Sherlock didn’t look up from his seat on the floor. “This isn’t the first time, John. You’d be surprised how comforting the sound of a heartbeat can be.” John searched his mind and had a vague recollection of Sherlock lying on the couch and tiny, baby Rosie on his chest, sound asleep after a night of endless crying. “Would you like to give it a try?” Sherlock said. “I’m quite curious if it’d be as effective on an adult as a child.”
Sherlock stared at the second stanza. So, John was writing poetry about him? There was no one else John knew who could delete things from his memory drive. Right? Sherlock sat up straighter. Why was John writing poetry about him?
Sherlock found it fascinating that Rosie found hugs so comforting. Sherlock himself had experienced a few hugs before, and they were mediocre at best. They certainly weren’t something to covet. Physical affection rarely was. Or, at least, that was what he told himself.
"Well what?"
"Fine," Sherlock said. He kept his gaze lowered as he spun away.
Sherlock was tense and rigid. He could still see the flashes of red, feel the searing pain upon his back, the tight metal chains on his wrist.
“Two years...the worst two years of my life...You died because of me...To protect me, when I didn't even deserve protecting. I'm nobody special. You though, you are fucking brilliant. There is nobody else in the world like Sherlock Holmes. You are special. The world is a better and safer place with you in it...and for reasons I still can't comprehend, you still chose me…”
"Jesus...Christ...Sherlock..." The older man heaved, his voice cracking at; the name of his friend.
Sherlock Holmes did not cry. He would never allow himself to feel such ridiculous sentiment towards another human being. And yet...despite his best efforts, Sherlock Holmes could feel the tears running freely down his cheeks…
Sherlock's head snapped up, immediately locking eyes with his blogger. His eyes were wild, his face was flushed, his chest heaving. It didn't take a genius such as Sherlock Holmes to see the panic written all over John Watson's face.
Sherlock had done his best to avoid staring at John, so he was noticeably startled when John had reached out and taken his hand. Sherlock knew that it wasn't intended as a romantic gesture, but he couldn't stop the blush that crept across his cheeks. When the car finally arrived back at Baker street, Sherlock expected John to let go of his hand. He assumed that It would be one of those not strictly platonic things that they would never speak about or acknowledge ever again. Sherlock barely contained his surprise when John opted to slide across the seat and out Sherlock’s side of the car.
“John...slow deep breaths...that's it...you're okay…”
The ride back to Baker street passed in complete silence. John remained stoic, his posture rigid and tense, as he stared blankly out the window. Sherlock studied his companion through the reflection of his own window. He regretted taking this case. It was a 3 at best, but he had been desperate. He hadn’t stopped to think about how it could possibly affect John, and for that he felt positively awful. An agonizing seven minutes and forty-three seconds ticked by before John finally moved. Without turning his head, he reached out to Sherlock, slipping his hand into that of his friend and intertwining their fingers.
Sherlock’s breath hitched.
“I called Greg...made him take it away…”
"You didn't think? You didn't bloody think? You are the great Sherlock Holmes! The world's ONLY consulting detective, and you didn’t bloody think! You are always thinking! How could that not have crossed your brilliant mind!?”
“John...oh John…” He buried his face into John’s hair. “I never thought my death would affect you so much…I never...I’m sorry. ”
"Oh John...I didn't think...I didn't realize..."
Sherlock’s eyes locked with John’s. “Sherlock?” His voice suddenly hoarse, gravelly, and just the slightest bit uncertain.
So, of course, when John's phone buzzed, alerting him of a text from the one and only Sherlock Holmes summoning him to the very place in question for a case, he panicked.
Sherlock brushed his nose against John's ear, sending shivers down the older man’s spine.
"John?"
John smiled slightly, trying his best to control his emotions. "Where exactly?"
Sometimes Sherlock would change his mind and go to step down from the ledge. Once, John had even made it to the roof before Sherlock had fallen. And yet, every single dream ended the same way. Sherlock fell, and Sherlock died. Every night John re-lived the worst moment of his life. The moment that Sherlock died. He would wake many nights, with tears streaming down his face, and Sherlock’s name on his lips.
“The one time I worked up the courage...My gun jammed...like...you...were...telling me...begging me not to…”
He rose at once, shoving his mobile into his pocket and tearing off the gloves that Lestrade had insisted he wear, utterly pointless as they were, and threw them to the ground, rushing to his friend.
John's heart was hammering in his chest by the time that he pulled up to the hospital. He paid the cabbie and choked down the bile that had begun rising in his throat before emerging from the cab. He couldn't miss the crime scene. The entire road had been blocked off and the entire scene was swarming with officers. He slowly made his way through the crowd and pushed through the barriers as he caught sight of Lestrade and was quickly waved in.
"The victim fell from the roof. Sherlock is up there with the other body."
The thought of the utter devastation and despair he felt at the loss of his best friend would often overwhelm him, and it was something that he would carry with him for the rest of his life.
He shook his head violently, trying to hold back the tears. "We're on the fucking roof, Sherlock." His voice broke, tears now flowing freely down his face. "There's a dead body on the fucking sidewalk Sherlock...And then Lestrade said you were up here..."
He carefully helped his friend into the back passenger seat of the car before walking around and sliding into the car next to his friend who still appeared dazed, and even somewhat confused.
“Every time.” He breathed.
“Of course you didn't…” John lifted his head to look the detective in the eye, “you utter git...can't understand how much you are loved.”
“John..." Sherlock quieted, his heart too, now hammering in his own chest.
The air was thick with tension and when Sherlock finally spoke his words hung heavily in the air. “John...I’m sorry…... I am so sorry. I am so very sorry John.”
-------------------------------------------------------------------
“Oh honestly Lestrade, I hoped that even your incompetent team could have figured this one out. It was the wife. She found out that her husband was cheating, both worked at the hospital and she followed her husband and his lover to the roof during their break. She then proceeded to shoot the lover and during the resulting struggle she managed to push him off the roof. I'll text you the rest of the details. Now please excuse us.”
John’s breath hitched, his eyes beginning to prickle, and before he knew it, he was furiously batting away at his angry tears for the second time that day.
John tore past Lestrade before he had even finished speaking, desperately trying to reach his best friend. He bounded up the stairs three steps at a time, ripping his phone from his pocket and mashing his thumb on Sherlock’s name to call him. Rationally, John knew that his best friend was just fine. He was in no tangible danger. His heart, had, at this moment, however, overwhelmed his head. Sherlock was on the roof of the hospital. Of course he wasn’t safe. Four agonizing rings later. “Where are you?” Sherlock’s voice cut through the phone.
“WHERE THE BLOODY FUCK ARE YOU!?!?” John all but shouted, panting with exertion as he ascended the stairs, ripping the door open as he finally reached top of the staircase.
“What do you mean, you're leaving? What about the case?”
“If I had to make that decision a thousand times over John Watson, I would choose you every single time. A world without my blogger is no world to live in.”
Lestrade stiffened. "I don't know why I expected him to warn you ahead of time of the specifics of this one." he grumbled. "Basic human decency, that would be...He's looking at the other body. I promised him that I would give him a few minutes alone with the body before letting Anderson loose up there."
Sherlock saw the signs before John realized it was happening. Sherlock sat back against the door and pulled his best friend close. As the panic attack washed over his flatmate, his best friend, Sherlock felt utterly helpless. Sherlock always knew what to do. He knew forty seven ways to kill a man without leaving a mark, he knew the names of every single star in the sky, (despite what John believed) he could learn a new language in under 4 hours, hell, if it wasn’t for his brother, he could manage to bring down the entire British government in one afternoon. Sherlock Holmes was in nearly every sense of the word, an enigma, capable of incredible things. But the one thing Sherlock Holmes could not do was save John Watson. Yes, in the most literal sense, John had been saved. He was still here, warm and breathing, and sobbing in Sherlock’s own arms. But in the end, it was the very act of saving John Watson was the very same thing that had broken him.
“Sherlock...what are you doing?”
John finally turned to face him. “What?”
John’s fists clenched around the countertop, knuckles white. Sherlock rose from the couch and approached the doctor, all but wrapping himself around the smaller man.
Sherlock swiped his thumbs under his blogger's eyes, clearing away the tears, before he batted away his own. “Sentiment is a chemical defect found in the losing side...It’s all I’ve ever known...I’ve always thought that love was a dangerous disadvantage...but as it turns out, I was wrong.
Sherlock held his friend firmly by the arm, slowly leading him from the scene and towards the unmistakable black car that had seemingly appeared out of nowhere. Sherlock knew what it must have looked like to all of New Scotland Yard. He knew that both of their faces were red and tear streaked, but honestly he just couldn't be bothered to care.
Sentiment. His brother had warned him too many times. Sentiment Sherlock... All lives end... all hearts are broken... Caring is not an advantage...Love will destroy you...it will eat you alive from the inside out...
"Yes John...I was observing the crime scene…
"John." Sherlock grabbed his arms. "Has something happened?" His long, nimble fingers searching for any indication that John, HIS John, has been hurt. "Are you injured?"
John's brow furrowed.
The roof...the roof...Sherlock fucking Holmes was on the bloody fucking roof of St. Bart's Hospital. Not again. Not this. This couldn't be happening again. Sherlock was on the roof!
“You have no idea how many...how many times I laid on your bed...gun in my hand...I tried…I wanted to die...”
“Just the two of us against the rest of the world.” He breathed, angling his head down, brushing his nose against John's.
john shook his head in disbelief. “There is a dead body on the ground Sherlock...A man fell off of this roof. Lestrade said you were up here. On this roof...And I…”
It was a full 45 minutes until John let go of his friend’s hand. Sherlock had barely been able to disentangle himself from the good doctor for long enough to remove his coat, before John’s hand sought out his own once more. The two settled onto the couch, John leaning his head against Sherlock’s shoulder, studying their intertwined hands. He finally rose from the couch, his feet carrying him into the kitchen. He flicked on the kettle and retrieved two mugs from the cabinet. His eyes darted over to Sherlock, as if he needed to reassure himself that Sherlock was still there, alive and breathing. He shifted his gaze and turned back to the tea once again.
