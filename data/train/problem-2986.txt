“Is there another Dean?” Dean asked. “’Cause I just came out of my bedroom to see Cas.”
“Pfft,” Sam scoffed. “Not a chance. He thinks I don’t notice, but he’s been eyeing up guys since we were in high school. I mean, come on, Gabe, you know how he feels about Doctor Sexy.”
“If this doesn’t work,” Dean said, feeling a constriction in his throat, “we have to stop him. Permanently. Whatever that takes.”
“Burned to a crisp? Yeah. Because Metadouche’s spell had them all manifest in the physical before dropping them through the atmosphere. An army of angels can’t come after you if they’re permanently grounded.”
“I might as well. Who knows how he’d spin it. And it’s part of something larger that I kinda wanted to talk to you about.”
“No, Dean. Not any more than you could get me new wings.”
“No, Dean,” Castiel stretched the wing out a little more, taking a shuddering breath. “They’re just…sensitive.”
“That’s an eloquent way of putting it, yes.”
“Well, not
“Well, maybe I want you to be,” Dean snapped. “Maybe I’m selfish too.”
“Yeah.” Rubbing the back of his neck, Dean took a deep breath. “I’ll think about it. I gotta go. Thanks, Sammy. You’re the best.”
He felt Cas shudder against him, then a breathy, “Dean,” in his ear.
The one child gave an exaggerated sigh and ambled over to the mom, while one of the other kids darted in, grabbed a handful of feathers, and yanked them out, causing Cas to gasp in pain.
“Okay. Well, what did you find? What’s the reference?”
“Cas isn’t healing anyone other than himself right now.”
to believe instead. And then while keeping all of this in mind, you do a bunch of sets of these. I think each one is like a minute long. And then the patient reports what they noticed while they were doing the eye movement part.”
Shaking that thought out of his head, Sam looked for a place to sit. The other bed seemed wrong, somehow. But in the chair at the table, across from the two of them on the bed where they were… Well, shit, now they were holding hands and sharing
“No. I want to continue.”
Instead, he had six feet of surly angel staring down at him.
Although Castiel was comfortable in Dean’s room, he hesitated to lay down until Dean had arrived with a bowl of popcorn and a laptop. It seemed somehow presumptuous, and more than anything, Castiel felt the need for the safety and support of Dean’s proximity. He didn’t dare risk overstepping his bounds.
Castiel followed Sam into the kitchen and positioned himself so he could see Dean’s face. He was reasonably certain he could spot changes in Dean quickly, and may be able to render assistance for Sam.
“Dean?”
“To be fair, Dean, a lot of traditional publishers
“No!” Cas whimpered, his blue eyes wide but unseeing. “No, please! Don’t!”
Tween Dean pointed at him. “You’re the one who drew this guy.” He hooked a thumb over his shoulder at Castiel. “Aren’t you?” At the other Dean’s nod, he grinned. “You draw really well.”
“I was already planning to attend that one.” Cas gave him a wink as he slid off his stool and fished some cash out of his pocket, setting it under the mug. “I’ll see you in there.”
Letting out a long breath, Dean closed his eyes. Cas’ hands were just as warm on his upper back, running through whatever had dripped on him, moving effortlessly over his shoulders and the back of his neck, finding every sore muscle. Massage oil, Dean realized. The scent had a hint of cinnamon and something else…maybe vanilla. It smelled warm and relaxing and Dean could actually feel the tension ease out of his body.
Dean startled when Cas suddenly stood up and announced he knew how to fix Jack. He still wasn’t sure if he wanted to fix Jack or kill him. Or seal him away somewhere until they made up their minds.
“I don’t know how,” Cas said, sitting down across the kitchen table. “I only know he did. I felt the surge of his grace. Both times. And now I can sense him much more clearly than yesterday. As if he is no longer weakened by the implant.”
“I only agreed to help you because I was the one who broke Heaven,” Castiel argued. “And now I’m not even sure that’s true. What Naomi took from me… I might have made different choices if she hadn’t erased memories, tried to make me her puppet, do her bidding.”
“What do you think leadership is? Using your power—your agency—with intention.” Michael slid Dean’s credit card over in front of Sam and stood. “Your breakfast is paid for. I’ll be around.”
What Michael had shown him, had forced him to look at, was so preposterous, it approached blasphemy. Initially, it had shaken him and caused untold pain when he tried to accept it, but now he was able to relegate it to a bad nightmare. As long as no one asked him about it, he was sure that in time, he could come as close as possible to forgetting it entirely.
Cas hadn’t moved at all on the bed when Dean returned to his room. He checked the bandages on Cas’ wing, seeing no evidence of additional bleeding, then settled himself as comfortably as he could on the green couch and closed his eyes, arms crossed, and chin tucked into his chest. His mind drifted, thinking about their next steps when everyone had recovered. What were other hunters doing—if anything—regarding the angels on earth? And all those demons at the checkpoints? Maybe Crowley knew something. It was worth asking, anyway.
“No. Stop.” Dean held a hand up. “What the
“And we are,” Dean said, grief flaring to life again. “Angry.”
“Cas…” Dean said, a hint of warning in his tone.
kind of not normal. More like Sammy’s kind. How can you come to a place like this and not have bacon?” He flagged the waitress down and asked if he could get a salad to go.
“What?”
He sat down on the bed where he’d woken up. Where Dean had slept next to him. Dean, who deserved so much more than Castiel could ever give him. Perhaps the only way he could make Dean happy was to find Dean’s soulmate, quickly, and make sure they were together before spending the rest of his existence trying to keep Heaven open. In this, he felt he had a purpose. But to do this meant getting back to their world.
“Well, how can he communicate with you, then?”
Castiel felt a tightness across his vessel’s chest, and he seemed to be breathing harder than required, considering breathing technically wasn’t necessary at all.
,” Dean said, settling onto the right side next to his nightstand. “Figured a little action would be okay, but not too much, given what you’ve been through today. Plus, can’t go wrong with Harrison Ford.”
are those?”
“Sam, you really don’t need—”
“I’m not an—” Sam stopped and shook his head. “Yeah. I’ve heard you for years. Helped whenever I could.”
“It’s not what I want to tell myself. It’s just what is.”
“And Sam let him?”
Dean nodded and sniffled again. “Okay.”
Dean stuffed a piece of waffle in his mouth and pointed his fork at Castiel. “Surgeon,” he said around his food. “Stop selling yourself short.”
“In a manner of speaking. But not the way Dean is thinking.” He came farther into the room and stood between the small table and the bathroom while Sam closed the door and returned to his chair. “This universe is not fractured and concrete, Dean. I require no vessel. I am not at war. Do you know why I truly want to help, Dean?”
Cas shot him a glare. “He’s noted for observing humanity from a distance, never interfering in human affairs. But what if something happened that required his involvement? And humanity was threatened as a result?”
“Not the point.”
Dean watched as Cas slowly raised his eyes, the look on the angel’s face one of puzzlement. “You want to massage my wings to make me happier?” he asked, sounding like Dean had made the stupidest offer of all time.
He laughed wryly to himself. Here they’d been planning this novel about fighting Raphael, and now they had a real life threat in the form of Michael. Another angel name. Who was in freaking air force intelligence. Maybe they could find a way to turn this into a novel, after any actual threat was gone. If Bela would even consider such an outlandish plot.
Dean nodded slowly. “Yeah, I kind of remember that. One had all the organs and one had the circulatory system, another one had the skeleton.”
“Dean,” Lover Dean said softly. “Dad’s dead. And what he thinks doesn’t matter. It’s what
Sam nodded. “Impaled…cemetery. Ghost threw me.”
“Tell me anyway,” Jess said.
“Gabriel, that is inappropriate,” Cas said.
“You may have more success with a guinea pig. I believe Dean has one sequestered away somewhere, though I have yet to find it.”
Done in grnd junct. heading back in a few hours after sleep. minor injuries. any word on gabe?
“That, also, is easy. The image of her drill coming toward me. How disapproving she looked. Merciless. Not that I deserved any.”
“That is entirely beside the point.” Naomi pointed to her chair. “Sit. Now. I’m going to make sure you don’t interfere again.”
Dean stood and strode over to the kitchen, grabbed a beer out of the fridge, opened it, and drank half of it. He knew Cas didn’t have anything to do with this. Not really, But he was angry all the same, as if Cas had somehow misdirected him. “Fine,” he grumbled, more to himself.
Sam balked. The enormity of the situation hit him and now he had no idea what to ask. Gabriel had been around nearly forever. Sam wanted to ask about the creation of the universe, about how things worked in Heaven, about why the angels looked down on humans when God—Chuck—told them to love humans.
Gabe’s shoulders and wings shrugged. “And I like the taste.”
Sam wrote something on his pad of paper, then smiled at him. “We’re not judging you, Cas. We’ll do several sets of about thirty to forty-five seconds each, where you watch my hand go back and forth. After each one, I want you to do that breathing thing—easy, deep breath in through your nose, hold for a couple of seconds, then out through your mouth. Then I want you to tell me what you noticed.”
“But something wonderful will happen, Castiel.”
“You did just fine at the abandoned yard,” Michael said.
Dean opened his mouth and closed it again, once he realized he had nothing. “Cas and Gabe can keep trying.”
“Yeah, but then what happened to her baby?” Sam shoveled a forkful of eggs into his mouth, sighed contentedly, then swallowed. “I mean, if it weren’t for the video and the investigation, I don’t know if it would be worth it to go out there. But…”
“Don’t you dare, Cas,” Dean said, pointing at him. “Don’t you dare. There’s more to this story. Your brother is a Grade-A dick. He took some of what you had in your notes, along with some photos of us together, and passed all that along to Bela, who called me this morning to threaten my contract. Again. Then he sent me an email, saying he was going to send the rest to her and to Crowley if I didn’t turn you over to him. He thinks he can just snap his fingers and get his way, manipulate me like a puppet. I say screw him.”
“How many of us you think Lot can take at once?”
“Yes.”
“No! God, no,” Sam said. “She
“Damn it. We need help. Who knows what Michael and Lucifer are up to, what kind of danger Mom’s facing?”
look.
“How long will this last?”
“Go write your story, Castiel. I can tell it’s going to be a good one. And say hello to the flannel twins for me.”
“Dude!
The synagogue wasn’t much better. The rabbi there told him that the way to God was through prayer, study, and charity, and that it wasn’t achieved overnight. It took decades. A lifetime. Castiel saw no reason to commit decades to calling for his father. Jack didn’t have decades.
Cas stood and gave him a confused look. “You just ate.”
needed?”
“Yeah, and they make up all sorts of interesting facts about angels’ mating habits. You know, like um…creative uses for wing oil.”
“It’s all packets of jam,” Castiel said softly.
“We should cross the border and then find lodging. You need sleep, Dean. And Gabriel is a little conspicuous right now. We can plan our next border crossing for tomorrow night.”
“A self-fulfilling prophecy,” Cas said, sounding thoughtful.
“No. And yes.”
Cas was unconscious, collapsed over on his side while still being buckled in. A trail of dried blood trickled out from the inner corner of his left eye, and he was covered in a sheen of perspiration. Dean had only seen him sweat one other time, back in that barn after he’d been stabbed by Michael’s lance. For an angel who claimed not to sweat under any circumstances, he was looking both human and sick.
“Silver lining?”
“So what do we do about it?” Sam asked. “How do we fix him?”
“Good. I’ll draft the letter later today, FedEx it to them tomorrow.”
I thought I’d take a few moments to explain how this fic came to be. Initially, as a professional author, I loved the idea that Dean wrote urban fantasy based on the basic
Castiel let out a long breath, his face relaxing a fraction. “You’re right, of course.” His blue eyes looked like pools of sorrow. “With that implant, they have no choice but to allow him to mistreat them.”
“I am. Thank you.”
“It’s okay, Sam. Your lung’s ready to be fully reinflated.”
“No. But I cannot send him away. He is… I love him. You understand that?”
“Sam, you should be resting,” Castiel said.
“Not ganking any ghosts today,” Dean said. He checked out the parking lot. Tucked into the far corner was a newer SUV covered in tree droppings, and not far from that, a dark minivan with a busted rear window, secured with plastic sheeting and duct tape. “Bingo.”
“Yeah, Cas. ‘Sides, I was really hopin’ you’d have listened to it already. It, uh… It kinda says some of this.”
Castiel moved closer to Dean, who spotted him moments later.
“Huh.” Dean considered that. “Dream walking?”
. More.”
Based on the files, Husband Dean was in room number eight. Castiel was cautious around the hunter’s doorway, but didn’t see him or anyone else. He knocked on the door, trying to prepare himself for anything.
“We could wait,” Cas suggested. “The entity did say it wanted me to forget about it before it came for me. If I never forget, maybe I won’t have fulfilled the terms.”
“Yes.”
“Would it affect our body in the real world?” Lover Dean asked. “’Cause, you know, Cas…with yours…”
They’d finished their hot cocoa in uncomfortable silence after Cas said he would think about it and then retreated to his room, but it was pretty clear to Dean that the idea of showing his wings to anyone under any circumstances made Cas extremely uneasy. In fact, if he had to name the emotion he thought he saw flit across Cas’ face when they talked about it, it was fear.
“No,” Sam huffed. “Constance and the baby were found in a shallow grave on the property. Newspaper said it looked like the baby had been attacked by a wild animal. Constance had slit her wrists.”
Castiel entered and glanced around the room. No clothes on the floor. The bedcovers looked neat and orderly. “What’s the last thing you remember?”
“Oh, please. You don’t remember even a moment of that.”
“Peace, bro.” Gabriel held his hands up, then turned to Dean. “I think I told you these implants were designed for, you know, standard angels. So it has a dampening effect on a bunch of things. The cuffs prohibit even more. No flying, no teleporting, no one-handed buffing the banana.”
Castiel met his eyes for a moment, then looked away and nodded, biting his lower lip.
Dean threw a bottle cap at Sam’s head, missing badly. “Shut up. You know what I mean.”
Dean ran back into the war room to see Sam trying to get Cas’ attention, or bring him back from wherever he’d gone. “Sam, he’s having another flashback.”
sounds like a dream. Or the plot to a book. Or a really campy TV show. My life is fucking normal compared to that.”
“I know. It’s like a sped-up Alzheimer’s.” He held up his phone. “I’ve been looking, searching… There’s nothing.” He swallowed visibly and met Cas’ gaze. “I’ve already lost him, haven’t I?”
Dean drove around Smith Center, finding two bars a block apart from each other. One was opening in an hour; the other didn’t open until evening. But the more he thought about it, as tempting as it was to lose himself in a few shots, Cas might still need him. Even if Cas didn’t want to stick around for the long haul.
Cas lowered his head with a sigh and nodded again.
“You would? Well…here!” She pulled up the sleeve of her blouse and held out her forearm.
“When you’re covered in ganked monster blood and guts, a friggin’ hose-down feels fantastic too.”
“No, not airplanes. There are seven planes of existence in this universe, some of which are subdivided. We’re currently in the physical plane, the lowest plane. Next to the physical plane is the etheric plane. It looks much like this one, but…vibrates at a different frequency. I can see into the etheric plane. You cannot.”
Dean nodded, understanding. “Except we’re not nice and neat and tidy. Jack’s half-angel and we’re gonna help him grow his soul back. I’ve been a demon
“And I’m doing quite well after being incarcerated and mistreated; thank you for caring.”
“You are, yes. I don’t know if you’re serious or teasing. I don’t feel like being teased right now.”
Dean watched, momentarily paralyzed, as Cas looked him over like he might be an appetizer. Or dessert.
Dean switched off all the lights and slowed down as they approached the bridge.
“Tomorrow. It can wait a few hours. You need sleep.”
“But—”
! I’m
“Breathe, Jack,” Cas instructed. “Now. In through your nose. Hold… Now out through your mouth.”
“We had sex,” Lover Dean said. “Really amazing, awesome sex. And apparently when he orgasmed here, he came in his vessel too.”
Dean checked to make sure fueling had finished, replaced the pump nozzle, and got back out onto the highway, easing the speed back up and heading for the bunker. He glanced in the rearview mirror again. “How’s he doing?”
“Is that what causes the thunder and all?”
Gabriel laughed shortly and nodded. “You know, even Lucifer was good once upon a time. He’s a shining example of what eons of rage and hate will do.”
“Because he couldn’t
“Thank you, Dean.”
“I apologize for what I said last night. It may be best if you—”
“No, Castiel. You’re not going to lose anything. You’ve lost too much already. I’m going to give it back to you, undo the damage they caused. It’ll be easier to trust yourself, to know exactly who and what you are. And you may find your answer for Jack too.” Chuck motioned with his hand. “Come here.”
“You were supposed to come get me, Cas,” Lover Dean scolded as he answered the door. “I was about to— Oh.” He looked back and forth between Husband Dean and Hunter Dean. “This is beyond weird.”
“I speak all languages, Dean.”
Castiel couldn’t help but look at Dean. “I want to believe I’m worthy.”
“Yeah?”
Cas stopped eating and leaned forward, his hands resting in front of him on the table. He waited with a patient expression until Dean gave him his full attention. “You’re right. I do.” With a satisfied look, he sat back and popped another fry into his mouth.
“Cas called?” Sam asked, looking up from his laptop.
Dean leaned against the door jamb. “Well, you
“Hate to break it to you, kid, but your choice of music grew out of country,” Gabriel said. “You wouldn’t be playing CCR in that boat you call a car if it weren’t for country music.”
Through the soundstage door, Metatron walked in, holding an empty vial and an angel blade, followed by Naomi with her drill.
“Oh. Should I go easier then?”
“Yes,” Castiel said softly.
Gabriel nodded once. “Huh.”
Cas. I’m gonna go look for him. He usually doesn’t go far. If I don’t see him right away, I’ll call him. He’s still got his cell.”
“No, Mom, you’re always welcome here.” Sam gestured into the kitchen. “I’ll make some coffee.”
A small hand reached out and took Dean’s. “Do you want to color?” four-year-old Dean asked. “Sometimes I draw my feelings. Maybe you can draw the sadness and get it on the paper and it won’t be inside you anymore.”
that was our world.”
“You heard anything else from him?” Dean asked.
Cas dropped his hands and Dean turned around to face him, noting a hint of a smile on the angel’s face. Maybe even hope. “No graves, Dean. Do you know what this means?”
“Cas?” Sam’s voice called from the hallway. “Can you come here? Slowly?”
NOTES, TRIVIA, AND REFERENCES (in order of appearance)
“I believe Michael found me. I just returned from grocery shopping this morning and someone has been in the apartment.”
say I’d stay,” Gabriel said defensively. “And I will. For a while. But taking on the US government? And Lucifer? Again? Not really on my bucket list.”
“We can get the rest of your luggage after dinner. Come on, burgers are ready.”
Castiel thought quickly. “I chose not to wear it in solidarity with you. When we pick yours up, I will wear mine again.”
There was a long silence before Cas spoke. “You’ve saved me twice, Dean.”
Sam heard Dean call out, “Sam, where are you—?” but lost the rest as he quickly made his way to find Gabriel.
“It is. It would be selfish of me to want more than that.”
“Still healing. Rest now. Your body needs it.”
“Yes.” The barista looked up from his order pad, eyes bluer than the Mediterranean gazing out from a tanned face with dark, messy hair. “What size
“I don’t think you can. And I’m…I’m at the end of my rope. I don’t know what to do here, Sam. He’s not responding, doesn’t seem to know I’m here. And damn it, I’m exhausted. I need my four hours.”
“That doesn’t make sense.”
“Gabe, listen,” Dean began.
“Routine protocol now, sir.” The officer nodded to one of the National Guardsmen on the passenger side, who opened the back door.
Dean spun around to see him as he walked slowly toward them and glanced briefly around the empty lot. Then he came to a stop precisely in the center of the circle Dean had poured. “I assume you’d like me here?”
“A year from now, this tree will be taller than you, Dean. It grew from a seed that no one planted. A few short months from now, there will be wildflowers and tall grasses in this field. It will be home to insects and small mammals. In fact,” Cas paused as if listening, “a pair of prairie voles is going to mate shortly, in a burrow beneath where you’re standing.”
“Cas…” Dean scrubbed over his mouth with his hand. “Would you show me your wings?”
“Thank you.” Mary sat at the kitchen table and watched him.
Castiel looked between the two brothers, trying to process what he’d heard. A cup of coffee sat on the library table, warming the palm of his hand. Sam and Dean sat across from him, a united front so to speak. But one discrepancy stood out. “Dean, why is it that when you have an idea that concerns me, we just do it, and when Sam has an idea that concerns me, you want my consent?”
Dean caught up to Sam, the other three right behind him. “We just wanted to check this out,” Dean said. He got a better look at the stranger. About the same height, Caucasian, hair about Gabe’s length, blue jeans, gray lightweight bomber jacket. Probably just another Kansas hick. Harmless. “Heard a lot about it. We’ll be on our way now.”
“Let’s go back to your room,” Castiel said. “I’ll tell you the whole story.”
a teenager, Cas. You weren’t.”
“Dean…that’s not—”
He set about trying to coax as many sounds as possible out of Cas, using his lips, tongue, teeth, nails, and skin. Growling, he bit at the base of Cas’ throat, not hard enough to break skin, but hard enough to leave marks, earning him a strangled groan, then sucked a hickey there. Moving down, he nipped at shoulders, upper chest, then used his nails to slowly draw a shrinking spiral around one pec, getting closer and closer to Cas’ nipple, before flicking it with his finger. Cas gasped and shuddered, and Dean attacked the nub with his tongue and teeth while performing the spiral around the other, causing Cas to mewl and then cry out when Dean flicked both tips repeatedly without mercy.
“Cas, I think the entire universe knows. Everyone except Dean. But that doesn’t explain why he had his gun on you. Why he
Dean nursed his second drink as someone slid onto the stool next to him and ordered a black coffee.
“What’s this?” Gabe said from the footwell. He sat up again, holding Cas’ duffel in his hands. After maneuvering the zipper open, he pulled something out and tossed it on the front seat. “You wanted symbolism, have your boyfriend explain this.”
“Tween Dean?” Sam offered with a smirk, knowing that Dean would never forgive him for that if he ever found out.
“No, Dean. You can’t.”
“Yeah, well…”
“Sure. There are only two bedrooms here. It’s a small house, even for one built in 1980.”
“I think you qualify as a guide and helper now, Cas.”
the only way he can help? All Michael. Must be part of his DNA or something. But I call BS. He can do pretty much anything he wants to do. He just wants to dick around with us while I’m recovering and can’t call him on it.”
Dean looked up, tear tracks running down his cheeks from haunted, sunken eyes. “I’m talking about nearly killing my best friend. Again. It doesn’t matter: if I’m in Hell, if I’m a demon, if I’ve got the mark. It’s just me.”
“What do you mean?”
“I’m not sure,” Gabriel answered, sitting back up. His face was relaxed, and he looked maybe a little drunk. “But I think you’re good to go on the other wing.”
“Then you don’t need their consent. You’re with
The feathers were even softer than they looked, and Dean knew that if he didn’t have so many callouses on his hands, they’d feel even silkier. At first he lightly ran his fingertips down along the feathers, noticing that Cas wasn’t flinching, though he was breathing more heavily. Dean took a chance and pressed in more deeply, feeling warm skin and muscle beneath the velvety feathers as he massaged his way down the wings.
“That’s not what you said, Cas.”
“What’s wrong, Dean?” Cas asked, sounding concerned.
“You helped, Cas. More than you know. I was doin’ some big-time repressing, I guess. Got a PhD in denial. In a way, Rowena’s spell was kind of a good thing. Y’know? I had to finally accept all these parts of me. I mean, we all got these parts, right? Just…not always so literal. Or separated.” His look turned somber. “Sam told me a little bit about his research, before you woke up. That people go through something like this for real and not from a spell? That’s just wrong, man. No one should hurt that much. And he said a lot of them have these helper parts, who might be angels?”
“No.” Castiel kissed him. “You’re perfect.” He kissed Dean’s jaw. “Not because you’ve always succeeded. But because you’ve seen it all.” He kissed the side of Dean’s face. “And still you love,” he whispered.
Metatron smiled and twirled the angel blade in his hand. “Or what? I hold the angel blade here.”
“They don’t
After a long silence, understanding grew on Sam’s face. “Multiple personality disorder,” he said. “A young child, who could see your wings. And Dean like he was years ago, following in Dad’s footsteps.”
. I’ve been working on them for a while. But my work was stolen. And when I find out who stole it, they will pay. Profusely.”
They switched places and Dean felt a momentary hesitation before he put his hands on Cas’ broad shoulders. Okay, this wasn’t too weird. He’d given Sam shoulder rubs before, worked out tight muscles after the kid had spent all night reading hundreds of pages of cases for law school. He fell back into the rhythm, his fingers and thumbs finding areas of tightness. But Cas was making sounds that Sam never did, or at least Dean didn’t remember groans and sighs that went straight to his groin.
“Focus on what you desire,” Michael suggested. “Focus on love. Focus on your sense of your chosen family.”
Cas is better.”
“Oh, bullshit. You and Sam have been crying over your feelings in the Impala for years.” At Dean’s surprised look, he continued. “I’m neither blind nor stupid. And yeah, I’ve seen you more often than you’ve seen me. Don’t give me that look. You can deny it to yourself, and you can deny it to Castiel, but you can’t deny it to me. And I really don’t know how much time we’ve all got left. So just talk to him.”
Dean glanced at Cas. “Good. Really good. Even with everything hanging over our heads.”
Slowly, Dean looked up, his gaze meeting Castiel’s only to dart away again before returning.
Dean set his now-empty mug down heavily. “Yeah. They know exactly what they’re doing.”
Dean felt a jolt of jealousy at whoever was making Cas react that way.
“No, Dean. I need to talk to you for a few minutes.”
“Do you think people can tell we’re angels?” Jack asked softly.
Cas chuckled. “Another angel.”
“And…teen in,” Castiel said. “Their light is your light too.”
Cas licked his lips, looking uncomfortable for a moment. “I love him.”
Castiel had to break eye contact then, feeling guilty for not saying anything for so long. “Since Hell.”
“Okay. So?” Dean motioned for him to continue.
“That’s not what I mean, Dean. Just…lay down next to Cas. If he wakes, you’ll know. And you don’t have to worry about anyone coming in and out.”
“Yes, I would agree that selling your soul was a stupid move.”
Sam let out a quick exhale. “Gabriel.”
“He ate one,” Jack explained. “While we were at our table. But when we stopped at his table, there were two again. The waitress never brought more over.”
“I understand why we need to do this,” Jack spoke up, “but it is a little unpleasant to hear one father and uncle talking about how to kill another father and uncle.”
“Dean, he is not like other angels,” Castiel warned. “I can’t even tell that he’s an angel, and my grace
Dean shifted on the bed, making eye contact. “You know you’re family, right Cas?”

Sleep overtook Sam easily, and he dreamed of elusive golden wings, just out of reach.
“Um, well, not if you don’t want me to.” Dean raised his hands in a gesture of submission. “I mean, it was just an offer. I don’t… This is all new to me. I don’t know the protocol. It’s just… You say you don’t like your wings the way they are now, and all these people who hate angels, who’ve never even
“Middle of fucking nowhere, Kansas,” Dean answered. “I’m gonna drive you home. Sam’ll take your truck. Can you unbuckle your seat belt?”
want to hear you guys.”
After taking a long swallow of his beer, Dean set the bottle down and stood. “Okay. Let’s go.”
“Perhaps. The reaper was called because Naomi was dead. Or everyone thought she was dead. Because Metatron had killed her.”
“Sure was, rockstar.” Gabriel glanced at Dean, then grabbed the lasagna pan and scooped out a square from the very center. “Early Taylor Swift, Billy Ray Cyrus, Dixie Chicks.”
“Kill the angel!”
“What? Cas? You having another flashback?”
The image still had him cringing. But instead of all fear, he felt anger now too. A hint of righteous fury. Naomi should not have done what she did. He wasn’t sure why, but he knew that much. “Six.”
“I know what you thought, Cas. You think you’re not good enough for me, and man, that is the farthest thing from the truth. If anything, it’s the other way around.”
“And…” Jack began.
“We have a club?” Hunter Dean said with disbelief.
“Huh,” Sam said softly. “Like we’re saying yes.”
“Cas!” Sam reached for Cas’ arm, but missed, his fingertips grazing Cas’ coat. He should never have brought up Heaven. Of course he knew Cas felt useless, had felt that way ever since the angels fell. Why did he have to dig into Cas’ sore spot? And Dean’s, for that matter, suggesting that Dean was at fault for people leaving him. He thought back to his conversations with Jack and Gabriel. Did he say something that sent them off?
“Yeah. I mean, if you want to be.”
Michael rested his hand on Jack’s shoulder and almost immediately, Jack gasped.
“You know what? Screw you, Dean.”
“Cool…” Dean stared at the carpet with a kind of awe. “So we should avoid it?”
Castiel made his way to Sam’s room and knocked on the door.
“Why?”
“Okay. No more sappy brother talk.”
“But maybe this one is right about this thing,” Sam said. “I mean think about it. Dean’s afraid everyone is going to leave him. Cas is afraid of being useless, of failing everyone else. Jack’s afraid of being evil.”
Dean kicked at the grass. “He doesn’t care about eternity. About what’ll happen to him if Heaven dies.”
“That’s it, then,” Dean pronounced. “No more knives for you. I’ll have to cut up all your food.”
“I do, Gabe. Let me help.” Invigorated, Sam retrieved the first-aid kit, reminding himself that this was not that much different that dressing any of Dean’s wounds. It was still flesh and bone. And feathers. He returned to Gabriel's room and dragged a chair to sit right in front of the angel.
“Why?” Dean asked.
“You’re always doing stuff for us,” Dean said softly, working at another knot. “Even the big stuff. The war in Heaven. I didn’t see it at the time, but I get it now. It was still for us. And the little things. You think of us before you think of yourself.”
“Oh.” Cas sighed. “I suppose.”
“Samurai sword-fighting teach you how to coach people through panic attacks?”
“What… What was that? I mean, was it an accident? A hook-up? Something we should pretend never happened?”
“Really? You think he’d go there? I don’t. Maybe rock music is covertly expressing emotions for those allergic to feelings.”
“No.” Cas shook his head. “Not specifically. Perhaps my superiors knew. All I knew was that you needed to stop, or the entire world was at risk. The more you gave in to the demands of the demon blood, the more of yourself you lost, and the more danger that put everyone in.”
“I feel like I should go talk to Dean, but I’m afraid I might make it worse. I tried telling Jack about what I was like when you met me. You know, the whole demon blood thing. And he took it the wrong way, that he’s
Castiel studied the fish more carefully. It was small and gray, nothing to look at, really. Completely unremarkable, aside from its desire to be on land instead of in the water. And yet now he understood: within that fish lay the potential to become what he found so fascinating. Humanity. And at a certain appointed time: Dean. In that moment, he felt a rush of protectiveness for that fish, wanting to prevent it from feeling pain, from enduring hardships. He felt the semblance of a hand on his shoulder, confident and supportive, followed by an instruction:
“Nothing you need to worry about, Sammich. You go get your beauty sleep.”
Dean sought Cas’ lips again, not ready to move quite yet. He pushed his hips up into Cas, rolling them a little, the heat and bubbles nearly overwhelming him as they surrounded him. “Okay,” he said, darting in for one more kiss.
“They still do,” Castiel mused. “Even in the Empty. They don’t realize they have a choice.” He looked up at Metatron sharply. “I don’t have a soul. Not like humans do. But when you took my grace, you told me to live this new life to the fullest. And that when I died and my soul went to Heaven, to come find you, to tell you my story.”
Dean wiped his hand over his face and blinked several times as he looked up at the ceiling. “So I’ve got a great life in this dream, and in reality it’s completely fucked up?”
“Of course, Dean.”
Castiel could sense Dean retreating back into himself, locking whatever he’d wanted to say back up. “Dean, talk to me. You don’t want me to leave…what?”
Castiel’s gaze went from the man’s attire to his face and he sighed heavily. “Gabriel,” his voice came out in a rasp. “What are you doing here? And where am I?”
“Depends on what you call home.”
door. The bunker door. Of course.
. Mom couldn’t see Dean in his condition. He was going to have to find out what she wanted and encourage her to leave. Quickly.
“Dammit Sam, why aren’t you in a hospital?” Dean ran a hand over his face. “Don’t answer that; I know. Okay. I can’t do this on my own. Broken ribs, sure, I can wrap you up. Collapsed lung is outta my league, man. You have a
Dean sat down in his chair as Castiel continued to dress, quirking an eyebrow when Castiel turned the tie over and over in his hands as if trying to figure out which way he should put it on. Sam was right, he admitted silently. With his wings, the angel did look kind of fierce. Without them, he just looked like Cas.
Dean tried to match the motions, grateful for the guidance, and struggling with each breath.
Sam nodded, smiling as if he knew something but wasn’t going to share it. “Okay, then. Just notice.”
“Where are we? Are you safe?”
“I’m Cas, remember? Castiel?”
Cas was quiet for a few moments. “No. You’re right, Dean. Especially when I can’t sense any deception from him.”
Cas’ shoulders sagged. “I wanted to share something that came up, but…” He sighed and his shoulders sagged even further.
Castiel swallowed down his unease. “Yes, Dean. You can touch them.” He stretched one wing out, still keeping them in the etheric plane, amazed that Dean could see them at all. Sam’s expression made it clear he didn’t see anything.
“Yeah. Somehow I knew you were going to say that.” Sam looked at the notebook. “So, we’ve got a part that’s in love with you. And one who’s ready to commit suicide.”
“No, there’s a page on Instagram for the brewery.” Sam shook his head at Dean’s blank look. “He’s on social media and he posted something earlier today. So, no, I don’t think we switched places with them. And look,” Sam held his phone out for a moment so everyone could see. “The guy who plays Cas has sent…” he started counting. “…four, five, six, seven tweets insulting the president, just in the past hour.”
After appraising his brother for a moment, Dean added, “You sure that’s not just you being overly forgiving?”
“I’m looking forward to it too. I don’t know much about angels, but I completely understand battling a manuscript. Sometimes it just takes a different perspective. Tell me more about Raphael.”
“Put it on speaker,” Dean said, sitting next to him.
“It is
Dean took the documents and looked them over again. “I would like to have my attorney review this.” He flashed her a grin. “I remember being encouraged to do that when I was offered my last contract. The one you’re changing. Due diligence and all that.”
“Feels longer.”
“Look, I said some things I’m not proud of,” Dean said. “Doesn’t make ‘em not true, but I could’ve said it better.”
“The hell you are. You left angry. You were just out here screaming and holding your head. And I nearly couldn’t bring you back. That’s not ‘okay’ in any universe.” He held one hand out to help Castiel up. “Let’s go home. I’m not taking no for an answer.”
“Kinky. And maybe some other time. Right now, I want you naked and in my bed.”
“Maybe he overheard us,” Cas said.
“It’s more than that,” Cas said. “It’s programmed with Enochian spellwork. A very advanced level, and extremely old magic.”
“I know, Cas. Me too.” Cas’ nearness did help Dean feel a little more relaxed, and he took a deep breath and let it out slowly, allowing his muscles to release some of their tension. “Ready?” he asked everyone.
“Okay. How’s the distance today?”
“Wow.” Dean looked away for a moment, then returned his gaze. “How long?”
was, uh…you know… The sex wasn’t really consensual. You didn’t know she was a reaper.”
“Crazy people who aren’t hot enough?” Dean ventured, reclining back onto his elbows.
“Naomi again? Or something else?”
“Yeah. He doesn’t sound good. Like, Michael’s-lance-in-the-barn not good.”
“You’re talking about a form of systematic desensitization,” Cas said. “Isn’t that precisely what Naomi did?”
Dean nodded and took a long breath. “Okay. Well, you’re not a casual hook-up, Cas. We’ve been through just about everything this universe—and a few others—can throw at us, and while you piss me off sometimes, I can’t imagine my life without you. You’re it for me. So, yeah. Forever? Sign me up.”
“Or Sam loving someone in a male vessel?” Castiel pressed.
“Have you talked to my agent about this?”
“Really, Dean? The birds and bees?”
“How do I manifest them here?”
“Need I remind you that I’m here at
“Look, I can’t leave you alone like this.”
Dean stilled again. “They’re not?”
Cas huffed out a short laugh. “No.”
Dean shrugged his shoulders under Cas’ hands. “That’s nothing new. After Mom died, Dad threw himself into work to cope. Bobby, his business partner, stayed in the shop to work on the cars while Dad traveled all over, going to car shows and trying to drum up business. It was the eighties, and business wasn’t great. High interest rates, no one wanted to take out a loan for a custom car. We didn’t have a lot of money coming in. I took care of Sammy, made sure he got to school, did his homework. I mowed lawns and did odd jobs for extra money where I could. A lot of people couldn’t afford much. The whole thing drove Dad to drink, and pretty soon we didn’t have any money at all. I dropped out of high school to go to work for Bobby, got my GED a couple years later. And in my free time, I wrote.”
Sam let out a frustrated sigh and lowered his phone. “There’s a type of trauma therapy that could help Cas in just a few sessions. It’s not talk therapy. Not like what you’re thinking. It uses brain science. I don’t know
“One thing about us, Jack,” Dean said, “is that what you see is what you get. If I don’t trust you, I’m gonna tell you I don’t trust you. And right now? I don’t trust you. But Lucifer—or whatever connection you’ve got to him—he twists everything.”
when you think of that? Not gonna lie, Cas, this is not doing a whole lot for my sexual self-esteem here.”
But a gun… He could control the gun but not the bullet. Once it left the muzzle, there were variables he could neither predict nor affect. Not anymore. Not without his grace. Not since he’d been reduced to this.
“Jameson’s, neat,” he said, using his voice for the first time that morning. He’d flown in the previous afternoon, settled into his room, and decided to order room service for breakfast. Chances were good his publisher would pay at least some of his expenses for the trip, and the rest would be a tax write-off. He had his first panel at eleven—all urban fantasy authors—and with his lifelong shyness, he was going to need a drink or two before he could put his successful-author mask on.
“I know, Sam. She said she didn’t belong here anymore.” Dean looked down the road to the right, seeing nothing but road and trees and sky. To the left appeared to be the outskirts of a small town. “Wherever here is.”
Chewing on his lip, Dean pondered how much to say, then decided to go for it. “My editor wants to change the terms of my contract. Shorter deadlines and half the royalties. If I don’t sign, I’m out.”
“I’m afraid I don’t know your work,” Dean said. “Either of you. I apologize. I try to keep up.”
Sam chanced another look around the diner. No one new had arrived. The server was laughing at something the cook had said. The radio had changed to a different song. He watched the card game behind him for a moment.
“Yeah, Sam.
my hands on you.”
“I researched it, yes. And interviewed someone who had spent years studying it. I enjoy researching for my novels. It’s like taking independent study courses in college, without ever having to worry about exams or grades.”
The rough voice just behind his shoulder surprised Dean and he whirled around to see Cas standing right there, an innocent look on his face. “You, actually.”
"My pie gland?"
“Go on.”
“You’ve always had the key, Cas.”
“Either way, that’s creepy,” Dean said. “How in the world do you keep that many fans on social media when you don’t interact with them? Bela’s always on my case for that whole interaction thing. She’s certain that if I’m
“I started the damn apocalypse, Cas,” Dean said softly.
“Why?” Castiel asked. “Why was that the necessary element?”
Castiel wasn’t entirely certain why Dean felt such frustration over a law that he had no control over and didn’t directly affect him. Gabriel still needed their help, and for now it seemed the only practical course of action was to accept their current reality. “There are very few times in human history where one group of people has not been oppressed or persecuted by others, based on meaningless categories such as skin color, religion, sexuality, or national origin.”
“You’re an angel,” Dean repeated, snuggling back into the hug. “And you love me and that makes everything okay.”
Castiel cut off the name with another kiss, then nipped at Dean’s lip. “Less talking. More eating.”
That was a jarring thought, and he almost forgot to follow Sam’s hand as it lowered. Inhale. Exhale.
“Aw, that’s it?” Gabriel complained. “No dramatic arguments? Throwing coffee on each other? A few punches?”
“The angel did suggest asking,” Castiel said. “He said that instead of using holy water and silver, we could have asked him.”
“Oh, thanks,” Dean growled. “You got any other stellar ideas?”
“Cas, this could change…everything.”
“Yeah, whatevs,” Gabriel said. “I am kind of curious about the guy.”
“Dude. How can you own social media and not have seen
“It’s why Chuck won’t interfere with Jack,” Castiel said, putting the pieces together. “It’s why he gave me back what Naomi took. So that I can make an informed choice. It’s why the cosmic entity kicked me out of the Empty. Because I chose to annoy it. I chose not to sleep. I
“Why, the royal sampler, of course!” Charlie said with an affected accent and a wave of her hand.
“No,” Sam corrected, “they’re electromagnetic lines of energy that cross the earth. Some people swear by them; others think it’s junk science.”
With that, a subtle shift in the universe, and Castiel found himself observing a beach as a wayward fish was prompted to heave itself up on the sand.
“Well, that’s interesting. Because I referred to you the same way and he didn’t deny it.”
Jack’s shoulders sagged. “I’ve still failed.”
Gabe gave him a puzzled look but didn’t say anything.
“Yeah? That what Dad would say?”
“All cars are she,” Tween Dean said, hugging four-year-old Dean to him. “Except monster trucks. They’re just assholes.”
Dean handed him a cup, and Castiel sipped it, only to make a face as the bitter brew hit his tongue. “This doesn’t taste right.”
“Suit yourself.” Dean grabbed a second beer and set it in front of Castiel before sitting next to him at the table.
“It’s the key to everything,” Metatron said. “It’s the only thing that keeps me from knowing how the story ends.”
“No. Why? Am I supposed to take you out if I do?”
“Not the best of memories,” Gabriel warned.
“I will, Mary. Thank you.” He waited until the entry door clicked shut, then went back to the kitchen for Dean, wondering if he’d find the husband or the hunter.
“No. Me and Sam haven’t renewed our licenses since we got ‘em. We just keep forging new ones. I’m telling you, Cas, I’ve never seen this one before.”
fun?”
“I’m gonna go check on Sam.”
“Why are you splitting us up, Cas?” Dean asked as he was firmly led toward the motel door.
Tween Dean was, in fact, still the dominant part and finishing up whatever he was writing when Castiel entered the room.
“Oh, Sam…” Gabriel lowered his hands. “I can heal the hole, but it’s going to take a few sessions. It’ll become smaller each time. I think maybe once an hour ought to work.”
“Okay guys,” Pamela said, standing. “I’ve got to get you over to the signing area, and we’re already about five minutes late. You can leave your water bottles here; they’ll have more for you at the tables. Pens are provided. Just grab your stuff and let’s head out!”
“Of course I pick good. I don’t go anywhere I haven’t fully vetted first.”
“Yeah, you’re one to talk, Mr. I’m-pushing-forty.” Sam stood and stretched, raising his arms high above his head, fingers nearly touching the ceiling. “I’m gonna go check out the outdoor hot tub. We’ve never stayed anywhere with a hot tub before. You should come.”
“Oh. Well, when Cas was more human than angel, he had to, you know, shower. And he kept getting shampoo in his eyes, so I bought a bunch of baby shampoo. I certainly wasn’t going to try and teach him how to wash his hair.”
“Also, you can’t keep tripping the breakers. And this?” Sam held up what had once been the brass mesh. “What’s up with this?”
attention until we’ve gone through every last song, and I’ll forgive you.”
He parked in the motel’s tiny parking lot and turned around to face Gabe. “Stay in the car and don’t draw attention to yourself, okay?”
“Some angel. Always needing to be saved instead of saving others.”
“Yes.”
Dean had no choice now; the need overrode everything. He reached for his dick, stroking it slowly at first, then faster, avoiding the sensitivity of the head. Every sensation grew, too many to identify, just the pressure and the need as he chased his release.
Sam checked his watch. Dean had been asleep for about ninety minutes now. “Maybe check on Dean first, make sure he’ll stay asleep for another half-hour or so?”
Cas approached the angel guarding the sandbox, a sad, apathetic guy who seemed far more interested in whatever he was drinking than two hunters and another angel. “Get Dumah for me,” Cas ordered. “Now.”
the heavy lifting around here. And speaking of heavy lifting, I wonder if Sam would like—”
, and even if this was all Castiel ever got to experience of Dean’s physicality, it would be enough.
“Of course, Dean.”
“Google ‘CJ Novak.’”
After Castiel folded the t-shirt and set it on the foot of the bed, he turned to face Dean, his arms loose at his sides. He closed his eyes and seemed to concentrate. The air behind him, from above his shoulders, extending just past the sides of his arms and halfway down his legs, began to pulse, very quickly at first, like the flickering of a fluorescent light, then gradually slow to that of a strobe light, slowing even further and becoming more visible.
“Sam. We
“Does the bunker exist here?” Dean asked.
“Or three.”
. Dean cracked the egg he was holding a little too hard, crushing the shell in his hand and getting broken yolk all over the countertop.
Michael turned that ethereal gaze on Dean. “If those you fight choose evil, what prevents you from choosing the same?”
“You read my book?”
After four nods, Dean called out, “We need help!”
Moments later, both angels shook their heads. “I can’t find him,” Cas said.
“I’d like to think we could be friends.”
“Don’t dis on Dad. He was plenty good enough. He was a great hunter.”
“Would my staying bring you comfort?” Castiel asked, knowing he would stay if asked.
“That’s other people, Dean. That’s not my boyfriend’s brother. He means a lot to you, so he’s important to me.”
“My point exactly. Your idea of fun and Sam’s idea of fun are two very different things.”
“No, Cas…” Dean combed his fingers through the feathers, willing them to puff up again. Puffing up seemed to be a good thing. Or at least a relaxed thing. “I love the color. I love how when the light hits it just right, it’s like a rainbow or an oil slick. I mean,” he added quickly, “maybe an oil slick isn’t the best comparison. But in certain light, there’s all this blue and green and violet. It’s pretty spectacular. I bet your true form is even more so. I kind of wish I could see it.”
Bleary-eyed, he typed a response back.
Castiel left the room, crossed the hall through the whirling gray, and found the next room. Hoping he interpreted the files correctly, he knocked on the door.
“All right. Back in,” the guardsman said to Castiel, shoving him roughly back into the car and slamming the door quickly, almost catching the long flight feathers in the Impala’s door jamb.
Dean caught Cas’ forearm with his hand as they walked under an antique-looking street lamp, bringing them to a stop. “Wait. Are you… Are you telling me that you got into writing because of reading my book?”
“He got shot with a tranq, okay? But it was meant for me, so he got quite a dose.”
“I know I’ve said you’re like another brother.”
“What?”
“Still not telling you.”
Thing was, Cas was his best friend. He’d never tried to have a relationship with a best friend before. If it tanked, then the friendship was over too. But if it succeeded… He and Cas had been furious with each other before, and one of them—usually Cas—always came back.
“We could offer up bait,” Sam said slowly. “Something that would be enough to throw him off if it
, if you will.”
“Um… Can I…? Yeah, I’m just gonna…sit down.” Dean made his way over to the other bed and sat.
“I must’ve fallen asleep. I think we’ve still got some hot dogs?” Dean looked down both directions for the hallway, as if unsure which way to go.
Cas followed the instructions, taking a few more breaths before he closed his eyes, his body sagging.
Dean looked around the table, then threw his arm around Cas’ shoulders and kissed him on the cheek. “We’re good now. Anyone who wants to argue with that can fight me.”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas said, his hair looking even more disheveled than Dean thought was possible. “How did you sleep?”
With a single nod, Dean left the restaurant, trying to clear his head on the way back to the hotel. Being published by a large New York house was all he’d known, and if he turned down the contract amendment, he could easily earn a reputation in the industry for demanding unfairly high royalties, which would make it harder to get signed with a new publisher. But if he signed, wasn’t he silently telling them they could walk all over him?
than shield. He could almost feel it, the smooth, flat metal between his fingers, ready to fly out from his hand and do his bidding.
“Kate.”
to protect them! To save
“Maybe we can take a little poetic license with that. So Tristan and Ross go to investigate these healings and survivors because this isn’t normal, and they’re concerned maybe something bad is saving people to extort them later. No good deed goes unpunished, and all that.”
“I know. Sam said the same thing, that I’ve got a soft spot to land. I even have half a classic car restoration company that my dad left to me, if the books don’t work out.”
“What did you notice?” Sam asked.
—they’re not exactly different people—but they’re different ages, have different ways of speaking, thinking.
“I honestly don’t know.” Sam let out a long sigh. “I love the little guy to pieces, but he might actually be more than I can handle. I am not looking forward to his teenage years.”
“What?” Dean’s brow furrowed. “Nah. Day off. Oh!” he snapped his fingers and pointed to Castiel. “I got a call that my ring was fixed. Maybe we can go into town and pick it up today?” He glanced at Castiel’s left hand. “Where’s yours?”
Castiel shook his head, unable to figure it out. No human should be able to see his wings. No human could see into the etheric plane. Except… He’d heard stories about young children still being able to see into both the etheric and astral planes before they learned to only focus on the physical plane. Such children also were able to see spirits, even remember a previous life if they had waived their right to remain in their personal heaven and decided to incarnate again as another human.
Castiel considered this. “Gabriel is going to do what Gabriel is going to do. I doubt that any one thing you say will affect him much.”
“I want to fix this,” Castiel said. “I want to fix me.”
“Being honest? You made it to all of us now.”
“I didn’t lose it,” Castiel said, backing away. “It was taken from me.”
If he was honest with himself, that time after Purgatory wasn’t particularly fun. And it was more than the guilt of leaving Cas behind. He just… He and Cas were better together. Really, wasn’t that what his concern for Cas was all about now? Making sure he didn’t get caught, implanted, and now with this expected order from the president, having his grace drained too?
“Wait, Cas…” Dean chided himself for not having looked at all of Cas’ books yet. “Your first book was, in a way, about your brother?”
“The brewery’s on Instagram?” Dean asked. “Thought you said it was in Texas.”
With one last, long pull with suction, Castiel pulled off of him and stood up. “Yes?”
“I’ll let you know. If my attorney says it’s all kosher, I’ll sign it and get it in the mail the same day. Sound good?”
“Fine.” Gabriel sighed and failed to look dejected.
“No, Gabe. It doesn’t just go away. I’ve been there. Sometimes I think I still am there. Maybe…” He shrugged. “Maybe we could help each other.”
“No, you dork,” Dean said, shaking his head. “I’ve seen
Dean looked surprised. “Might’ve been that cold I had. The guys are always bringin’ somethin’ in to work.”
was about Michael as a supposed protector,” Cas said.
Cas turned to look at him, his eyes holding the same expression of betrayal and resignation that the little girl had as she left the restroom. “Zachariah.”
“Your boyfriend’s fine.”
“Yeah, of course. You wanna help me wash dishes? And explain why, in this kitchen renovation, you didn’t put in a dishwasher?”
Dean managed a nod and forced himself to relax, reminded himself that Cas would take care of him, had always taken care of him. When Dean allowed it.
“Can’t have everything as a hunter,” Dean said.
“Hey,” Dean said, setting the ACE bandages aside. “Having met your siblings, and your…uh…Chuck… I’m sorry for calling you a baby in a trench coat. You’re probably one of the most grown up of all of them.”
Izzy shook her head. “My wife wouldn’t like that very much.” She pulled a five-dollar bill out of her wallet and handed it over. “Chai tea. Large. I’ve already eaten, but feel free to eat in front of me.”
“I did stuff I’m not proud of,” nine-year-old Dean said. “’Cause I had to. To survive and take care of Sammy. I did stuff that hurt. I bet the stuff you did was to survive too. Or to help someone else.”
In his most private moments, he could admit to finding the male form attractive, sometimes wishing for hard muscle instead of soft curves. And if he was
“Tell me more about the video you took,” he prompted.
his ass back here. And then we’ll make a plan.”
. “Things were taken from me in that chair,” he said. “So… I don’t know… Maybe I take back what is mine?”
Castiel waited until he heard the lock click and then turned to Gabriel. “Let me see where they cuffed your wings.”
“You can change it if you want. If that doesn’t fit anymore, based on what happened yesterday.”
“Yes, I get that,” Sam said. “But what did you
“Hold still, Castiel,” Naomi said.
“I’m going to kiss you again,” Dean said, leaning closer.
Firm fingers gently touched his chin, then pulled until he faced Cas. “Dean. Look at me.”
Dean let out a long breath once Castiel stopped moving, and muttered, “Better,” under his breath.
“No, hey, I’m not going right back to the movie after that. It seemed like it was kind of a, you know,
“No, it kinda does,” Dean said. “Your whole thing was family. Right? Too much fighting upstairs and you got out. I can understand that.”
“That is
“We’ve all made mistakes,” Cas said. “Sometimes monumental ones.”
. I’m not sure about angels.”
“I have harmed you, Sam. I wish to ask for forgiveness.”
The hands paused in midair and a disembodied voice whispered, “Shhh… You’re safe.” Then the hands faded away, leaving Sam alone in a dark room.
“I heard there’s one part who’s not here. A demon?”
He pulled the car around to the far end, checked for any sort of video cameras, and finding none, turned off the ignition and let out a long sigh. “I got us two beds. I figured you guys don’t sleep anyway, right?”
“Okay, what are you all arguing about?” Sam asked.
“How do you know?” Castiel asked, half out of curiosity and half trying to figure out how he should answer Dean.
“Did I…do something wrong?” Castiel asked slowly.
to be good. That right there tells me you’re not evil. Your—” Sam caught himself. “Lucifer doesn’t want to be good. He just wants what he wants, no matter how many people it hurts or kills.”
“Why? They’re…”
“Yeah, actually. I heard someone say Sammy needed my help. And I still haven’t made dinner.” He moved to get off the bed.
Kelly Kline had told Jack, in a video.
“Sorry,” Dean said, not sorry. He drank more of his beer, maybe sulking a little bit.
“Hm.” Dean devoured the last slice, figuring it wouldn’t taste as good reheated later, when he inevitably got hungry again. He patted his belly, watched Sam for a bit, then finally stood and gathered up the pizza boxes and dirty napkins to dispose of them.
“How long did you have them?”
Checking that his alarm was still set for six in the morning, Sam rolled over and went back to sleep.
“Don’t you think we should talk about this?” Sam asked.
Weighing his options, Castiel decided on honesty. Sort of. “Would that be a problem?”
“No, Jack,” Sam added as Dean left. “You don’t have a cat.” He ran a hand over his face. “Let’s eat first. I’ll check a few things out, and then I’ll explain what’s going on.”
He thought about Anna for a moment. She’d given up everything to be human, to completely experience emotion and all the physical sensations of the human body. And for almost twenty-three years, she’d experienced family, love, friendship. In contrast, his three months of humanity had left him with only memories of pain, fear, and being alone.
“I don’t like any of this,” Dean broke in. “I don’t like that we had to bust your ass out in the first place, and Sam got hurt because we weren’t there. I don’t like that you thought it was more fun or whatever to play hide and seek than to help us stop the apocalypse and Sam paid for that too.”
“Remember when you broke my wall?”
“Yeah, Sam was telling me about that earlier.” Dean repeated what Sam had said, including his thought about being a silent author.
“And how exactly did he call you?” Sam said.
“’Course I do. What of it any adult remembers. Family picnics, road trip vacations. All the usual stuff.”
“What’s this new book about?” Jess asked as she came in and sat in the other La-Z-Boy recliner.
“Cas told me.”
“Well, not everyone,” Sam said. “Because anyone who recognizes us from the show is going to think we’re these actors.”
“Sam, I have sinned. Terribly.”
“Dean, I’d just be asking for information.”
“Okay, Dean. I’ll look over the papers once I get them. Just know that you’ve got options. Okay? You’ve got a soft spot to land.”
Cas stopped the massage and rested his arms on the edge of the whirlpool. “Anyway, that’s why I don’t do photos or much in the way of appearances.”
