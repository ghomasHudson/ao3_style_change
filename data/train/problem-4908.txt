"What happened to you?" Ruby asked Bucky as she cut open his vest to reveal his wound. Looking at it, she hypothesised that this was most probably a knife wound. It was quite large but not deep enough to consider it life threatening so she knew that she only had to disinfect it and sew it up. It also looked like that Bucky got the bleeding under control as it was very slowly coming to a stop.
Ruby was actually hoping that Dr Banner would take so much time creating her medical profile because once he's finished, that's it. Mr Stark and Steve would leave her here and Dr Banner would probably pass her onto the next doctor.
Overall, Ruby thought that having Wanda teach her more control over the next few months would be awesome. Ruby liked her. She always wondered what it would feel like if she had an older sister and she thought that perhaps, this was as close as she could. What was strange though, was the fact that the Voice had been very quiet through it all. Months have passed ever since Ruby realised that there was a Voice in her head so it was very disconcerting to have her mind silent.
Nobody was prepared though when he pulled out a cleaver underneath the bed and slashed it down Ruby’s stomach. Her scream echoed in the room along with Peter’s worried shouts and Tony’s sharp curses. On the screen, Mordo chuckled as Ruby’s scream was reduced to whimpers of agony.
"There's nothing much really." Ruby started. "I mean, I used to live in Michigan with my parents. Got captured by HYDRA. Lost my parents. Then now I'm here." Wanda nodded her head. She could empathise with her loss of parents, especially at such a young age. If there was only a way to prevent young kids like her from experiencing all this trauma, she would have done it.
The door swung open and one by one, the rest of the Avengers slipped in the room. Even Dr Banner, who Bucky was sure down the lab. Bucky had known that they were listening in to their conversation ever since Ruby asked about them discovering her abilities.
Hi lovelies! Who watched End Game already? Imma watch it this weekend and I'm so hyped for it!!! Anyways, enjoy this chapter!
Ruby found it hard to sense anything. All she could focus on was how this power seem to swallow her.
The physical and mental exhaustion must have shown in Ruby's face because before she could even reply to Tony's question, Steve intervened, "Maybe we could do that tomorrow?" He suggested.
The man created a portal, and as though he sensed that someone was looking at him, he turned around to smirk at her.
Once the AI took them into the penthouse, both Tony and Steve gave her the grand tour of the place. Ruby couldn't quite believe how massive the floor is. It had an urban modern interior design with a motif of black and oak brown. Right at the corner, there was a set of stairs that led to a mezzanine floor where the guest bedroom is.
She closed her eyes tight in an attempt to stop tears from flooding down the sides of her face. Taking two deep breaths, Ruby tried to reassure herself that everything will be alright. No big deal, right? HYDRA just captured her again. She survived 2 years with them so she could surely endure a little bit more. Plus, she wasn't really alone like before. She got Infinity now.
"I'm sorry, what was that?" Did Tony just hear the girl tell him to shut up? Even though it was barely a whisper, Steve and everyone else in the room clearly heard what she just said.
"That might not actually be true." Both boys looked at Ruby in confusion. "I may have deliberately aimed badly when I was shooting the ball."
Steve couldn't really fault Tony for thinking as far ahead as this. It would be really good for Ruby to have someone similar support her through all this, so she didn't feel too alienated. Steve just hoped that Tony could have talked this through with both Ruby and him first. He moved the arm where Ruby was leaning on and wrapped it around her shoulder instead.
Flashes of someone's, ‒ a man's life played in her mind. He was in the playground, rocking the swing his little boy was on. They looked so content and happy. The boy was giggling, his smile reached his tiny little ears as his chubby hands clutched at the chains to ground himself onto the seat. Then the boy looked at Ruby and gave her a small smile, causing Ruby return one of her own.
As if hearing Bucky utter the word, Ruby's eyes slowly slipped open and began to take in her surroundings. She was quite disoriented at first but once she saw Bucky's face slightly hovering to her left side, everything came back to her. People running. The symbiote. The fight. Peter. Not calling Bucky.
This wasn't important right now anyway. Whatever their intentions were, they have all been scrapped. She was safe now and nobody would be coming after her anymore.
He couldn't pinpoint what exactly was causing him to feel this way but it was putting him on edge. And he didn't like being on edge. It made him paranoid and shaky and hypervigilant. That always never end well.
All three of them went quiet when they heard the elevator ping. The doors swung open and it revealed a woman clad in a dark red leather jacket alongside a tall man with dirty blonde hair.
In a blink of an eye, it was back onto its feet and Peter was knocked down on the ground again. The creature raised its hand which was now turning into tendril-like limbs, swiftly taking the form of an axe and was getting ready to swing it down to her friend.
Confused with the situation himself, Stephen answered the parts that he could, “Ruby is fine. Infinity, the sister of Eternity who took control of Mordo, is residing within her and healing her. I don’t know where we are but I believe that this is Infinity’s doing.”
Hey guys! Shout out to those who subscribed,  bookmarked and gave kudos to this story! Thank you, it means so much to me. Anyways, here's Chapter 4. Happy reading!
Tony commented about getting to know each other more to which Ruby protested that Vision must be left with them too but the android insisted that he wanted to synchronise himself with the surroundings again. Something about being nostalgic with all these familiar places that he hadn't seen for quite a considerable amount of time. Vision, Steve and Tony all scrambled out of the communal floor a while ago to do their own things so it was just Ruby and Wanda left.
Infinity showed Ruby everything that Eternity annihilated. She saw him, albeit a different face but with the same azure eyes, burning a planet down with its inhabitants. He even altered the pull of gravity of two galaxies, causing them to collide and damning all the life forms that lived within them. For a long time, Eternity took vessels, leaving a trail of dead bodies as he finished with them.
Clenching her fists so hard her nails drew blood in her palms, Ruby tried her best to dominate over the power. She focused all her energy and strength trying to push down its intimidating consciousness until she felt the rush of blood in her veins slow down, the glow slowly fade away and her heartbeat return back to normal.
"Yes, but doing this will speed the healing process up. You didn't have the wound exposed to air for more than 6 hours, did you?" Bucky shook his head no and he didn't really had to ask why the girl seemed to know what she was doing as she started to suture.
"What the hell, Ruby?" Tony ran down to Steve who was already arguing that he was fine and that it was alright.
"Whatever. At least everybody else here loves me. Ooooh, I smell bacon. Barnes! Give me some of those bacon strips you're eating." Clint shouted.
They sat stiffly on the round table, all their attention centered towards the screen. Fury wasn't surprised with their reaction. Ever since the Avengers have defeated Thanos, Rogers and the Winter Soldier had been working with SHIELD to dismantle the remaining hydra base operations while the others offered mission support from time to time.
Tony gasped loudly when he saw a brunette woman with an arc reactor at the middle of her chest come into the living room. It was covered underneath the thin layer of her shirt but Tony wouldn’t mistake that glow. This person was him. But as a woman.
It was the stuff that those scientists usually inject to her. Put her body in a muscle paralysis but left her lucid to be able to hear and remember almost everything. Most of the time, it would wear off after she's counted until 1,561 but it could run over until she's reached 9,000. Today, she only reached up until 4,296 before she managed to open her eyes and saw Dr Banner's hand hovering inches away from her face.
"The winner gets to have 2 more extra shares of cupcakes!" Spidey announced and everyone immediately started on their designs. Natasha chose to make a fox design while Spidey decided to just draw himself on the cupcake. Ruby can't actually think of someone who would like to eat a cupcake with their friend's face on it.
That information made Steve look abruptly next to the man beside him. "Are you sure that's a good idea? Hydra might still be looking for her and‒
With a sigh, O’Malley pulled his collar up and clicked his tongue. It was such a shame that his master would rather prolong this than take her. The sooner they get her back, the sooner they could seal
Not long after, Ruby and Tony reached the penthouse. For some reason, Ruby was getting this strange feeling about both Tony and Steve being very far away from her and placing themselves in a probably dangerous situation.
"Go!" The guy (who was wearing the creature?) shouted at her. "We will take care of this!" As soon as he said that, he transformed back to the full face of the black creature and led the fight away from where they were. Ruby wasted no time crawling towards where Peter laid and shook his head.
Steve was very on board with that decision. Damn it all to hell if he was going to let her be imprisoned yet again, and it wasn't like they could sign her up for foster care either. They had no idea why Hydra wanted her and taking her to the tower would mean that the public would be safe in case she turns out to be hostile.
No doubt that's probably related to the journal entry that Fury showed to them earlier this morning.
"Hello, Miss Reid. I'd like to inform you that the Avengers has left just now." Friday said. "If you would like to know their whereabouts at any time, please do not hesitate to ask me." Ruby nodded her head which she assumed Friday saw because the AI did not say anything afterwards.
Hydra was keeping someone in captive. More specifically, a girl. Probably not older than 18 the most. This recon task had just turned to a rescue mission whether Fury liked it or not.
Natasha flipped open the cabinets which stood opposite the beds. They contained medical supplies. All freshly stocked.
Author's Note: Hi guys!  Just informing you that there would be mild violence in this chapter. Although I believe that it isn't really that graphic, I thought you'd appreciate the warning. Happy reading, my lovelies!
Tony had been too focused figuring out a way to access the underground facility from the blueprint that he wouldn't have felt the presence of two hydra officers pointing their rifles at him if he didn't hear the crisp click of a trigger safety being unbuckled.
Raising his hand, he took hold of Ruby’s cheeks and pinched them between his thumb and forefinger, forcing her to look up. Mordo’s eyes glinted azure and Ruby felt the beginnings of scorching heat from her stomach. Soon, it spread on onto her whole body.
Ruby had been so hurt. She couldn't believe she lost her life and her parents over this. To heck with this cosmic beings shit. And Infinity could take her abilities with her and leave her body. She didn't want any of it in the first place so she hoped that the entity could just fuck off and get out.
“Sure thing, Princess. And oh, did you take the lunch our metallic friend fixed up for you? It was on the kitchen counter.” Steve and Tony were actually jealous. Bucky didn’t allow them to taste even a tiny piece of those California maki rolls he made.
She was clad in a golden yellow dress that looked almost like her second skin. The second she sensed that Ruby was approaching, she raised her head up to assume a sitting position and beckoned for Ruby to sit in front of her.
He popped a cookie in his mouth that he found sitting on the table top, not even caring that it was half eaten already.
He couldn't help but wince at the sight of Peter receiving sharp blows after sharp blows from the symbiote. They were just about to head out when a familiar blonde girl turn into the street while everyone else was running completely opposite to the direction she was heading.
The three men left the make shift shelter and each took a designated area to clear. Tony had been doing well with the new micro-missiles he installed in his suit. They were more compact and much more explosive. He cheered in victory when he had a small group of demons dusted.
"It has begun, Master." Unbeknownst to the two teenagers, a man clad in a long black trench coat was following them from the shadows throughout the day, observing what Ruby has managed to discover from her ability.
"I'm a harsh judge! So don't waste my time!" Clint shouted from the living room where he was seated on the couch in front of the TV.
Swallowing the chicken in her mouth and clearing her throat, Ruby straightened her posture in attempt of showing that she was still very much stable before answering his question.
She didn't notice that it was already half past nine until the dim lights startled her when they automatically lit up. Yawning, she stretched her arms and proceeded to place the book back to its shelf.  She just turned the lights off and was in the middle of getting another book to keep in her bedroom when she heard a loud thump and what sounded like a hurt grunt coming from the balcony.
After a few moments, Ruby wiped her mouth from side to side when she noticed that Bucky was staring intently at her and truth be told, it was actually kind of scary.
Ruby shook her head at her friend's stubbornness. She learnt her lesson, she wasn't going to intervene. What she would do, as a responsible teenager, was call Tony or Steve or anyone who was in the Tower for back up and stay where she was until they get here.
"I gotta go help save some people." That was all the explanation Ruby got before Peter webbed away, leaving her here with her mouth gaped open in disbelief as she clutched at the backpack in her hand. Not that she hated him for trying to help people but it was just so sudden. Some sort of explanation about what kind of trouble he was going to poke his nose in would have been nice so she wouldn't be dying in worried speculation over here.
"It's already late, Tony. It's best for Ruby to get her rest." She sent Steve a grateful smile before nodding along in agreement with his idea.
The Voice proclaimed in a sing-song manner. She just shook her head at her mental companion's antics. For once, it felt like the notion of having the Voice inside her head forever didn't seem too scary. Ruby looked at everyone hovering around Peter with a fond expression. She got a new family now.
Having enough experience in combat, Steve was able to predict Ruby's move and was able to block it with his forearm. He took the chance to grab her leg and twist it, rendering Ruby out of balance and making her fall to the ground. Again.
“Tony, I’m seeing this correct, right?” Steve asked to confirm, but Tony was too flabbergasted to answer.
Steve wondered whether Peter was alright. He knew that in the boy’s haste to find Ruby, a demon managed to claw the back of his thigh. It wouldn’t stop bleeding but Peter had been fast to reassure both Steve and Tony that he was alright. His healing factor was just taking some time to kick in because the wound wasn’t inflicted from a human source. Distracted with his thoughts, Steve barely dodged a talon to his temple. He pummelled his shield to the hollow of the demon’s throat before kicking it on the shin, effectively immobilising it.
Ruby opened her eyes and took several breaths to get her heart rate in control. Once more, she shut her eyes close but the scientists were back there again. Again and again she attempted to go to sleep. She made sure her lamp was turned on before she went to sleep, but it was still dark when she closes her eyes.
Natasha lifted her gloved hand to adjust her earpiece so that it fitted snuggly inside the hollow of her ear.
What was even worse is that he knew that having a cosmic entity completely destroy a soul bond without destroying a vessel, would mean that Mordo himself willingly agreed to give up his physical body and consciousness to provide Eternity a powerful, permanent corporeal form.
"Anyways, I'm gonna go now Ned. It was nice meeting you!" Ruby and Ned exchanged numbers before she went and thought about whether or not she should call Bucky to come pick her up. She was actually annoyed when Steve and Tony told her that they would be on rotational duty on who will accompany her to College for at least a month. She tried to complain that she could definitely handle herself and that the College was only half an hour walk, 15 minutes if she took the bus! But the two superheroes were not having it.
He has seen her file when the team rescued her from HYDRA. There had been so many circumstances where their '
Yes, that's right. Peter said that he liked watching the sunset as he dangle from one of the spikes of its crown so here they were, on the way to the said statue. She didn’t know why but to be honest, it felt like blasphemy.
"Oh he's in SHIELD headquarters. He said that he needed to look something over. Research about bacterial DNA and stuff. Something about needing a second eye." Tony answered and set his StarkTablet on the coffee table.
"Where's Bruce?" Steve asked. Bruce was usually the one up early in the morning almost every day so Steve found it quite unusual that he's not in the common room yet.
"I'll tell you my plan later." Ruby answered, eyes still locked on the screen as he tapped Peter's arm, "Now hush, I'm watching the movie."
"Do you think they'll come rescue you for the second time? Or would they be secretly thankful that a brat like you had been taken away from them? I wish they'll come for you so I could finally get rid of their filth in this world."
rolled her eyes as she chewed on her gum. “No, it isn’t. The doctor said my heart is getting stronger now. No need to worry, old man.”
Immediately, the production logos started rolling and they all settled in. But Halfway through the movie, just when the dwarves and company was about to enter Rivendell, Steve's phone rang.
It didn’t take long for the rest of the Avengers to arrive as well. Bucky came in first. He looked murderous in his black tactical vest with wild alert eyes as he walked in into the communal area. The sudden call for assemble had put his mind in a disarray especially since he was already in a mission, and he rarely receives a distress call in the middle of it as it was normal protocol for stationed Avengers not to be disturbed unless it was an emergency or a matter of national security.
As soon as she voiced that out, Steve's eyes widened in concern and asked Dr Banner when she could start eating some solid food. Unfortunately, she would have to retain a liquid diet for up until 2 weeks and gradually introduce solid food again as to not upset her stomach. At least, she wouldn't have to use a feeding tube.
The Voice said and when she looked down for the second time, the glow in her hand was nowhere to be seen. She tried to rotate her ankle slowly but was really bewildered when she felt no pain whatsoever at all.
“V, no. Please don’t go just yet. Together, Remember?” Ruby pleaded. “We could defeat Eternity together. Come on, I know you can take my life energy, and then we could go back.”
In the end, Tony had no choice but to take the gun and shoot the towers. Ruby couldn't help letting out a loud,
Their conversation was cut short when the doctor examining Ruby walked out of the room, "You can go see her now." Both men thanked the man and wasted no time before entering the room.
"Look Steve, okay, the girl might be enhanced and it might be the reason why Hydra had her. But you know what I think? She's either having an inner conflict about her abilities or just doesn't know what's happening to her." Tony acknowledged his concern. "Don't you think she needs some sort of normalcy from all of this? Or do you want her to be imprisoned in this tower? With the same people who claimed that she could trust, which obviously she doesn't, considering that she felt the need to hide her abilities."
Darkness filled Ruby’s vision. She couldn’t see a single thing, couldn’t hear the soft whisper of the wind, and couldn’t even feel the warmth of the sun against her skin.
Being the book lover that she was, Ruby excitedly looked through the many titles in the collection. She was absolutely pleased to find that there was a huge section for fiction fit for her age.
Immediately, both men knew that something bad happened to Ruby. Tony hanged up on Peter, threw off his blanket, and ordered Friday to run a visual recognition  while he began to start his remote control suit army to help find Ruby. Steve, on the other hand, sent an assemble notification to Bucky, Natasha and Clint. This was Ruby they were talking about. Both superheroes knew that it wasn’t a coincidence that she was missing. Maybe they were lucky and she was just being a rebellious teenager defying her supposed parents, but worst case scenario is she was dying on a ditch somewhere. Steve and Tony  didn’t even want to think about that. The girl attached herself to their lives so much that they couldn’t even fathom going back to living their lives where they didn’t had Ruby.
Remembering that they were actually playing tag, Ruby quickly pretended that she was so much in pain as she dramatically howled while clutching her leg.
Ruby replied back mentally. She was still wondering how she would tell her new found family about the Voice inside her head, because even herself, couldn't understand what it was. It didn't matter that Ruby believed that the Voice was real and wouldn't do anything to hurt her. What mattered was the fact that scientifically and medically speaking, she would be considered mentally unstable.
Hours and hours later, Ruby found herself becoming ridiculously bankrupt after getting her money milked by Tony and Natasha. Tony had hotels on both Park Place and Boardwalk while Natasha had three houses on each of the green ones. She has been so unlucky as well after landing on the Luxury Tax numerous times.
"We'll only be gone for a few hours. If not by tonight, we'll be back tomorrow. If you need anything, just ask Friday." Tony said and he must have seen something fleet across Ruby's face because his expression softened.
Ruby had been so pre-occupied of her thoughts of Peter that she barely registered the cold liquid that slapped down her cheek with a sharp splash. It immediately made her sit up on the bed, her hand automatically went up her face and hair to smooth them down. When she smelled a fruity scent and looked down at her sticky hand, Ruby glared at Wanda.
Caught off-guard, Stephen tried to look as calm as possible. Even though the being didn’t seem hostile, he didn’t want to take risks. “Regarding Ruby, why is she unresponsive?”
"You're only afraid because you don't understand. I am afraid too, for the same reason." Ruby couldn't hide the flinch when Wanda admitted that even she was scared of Ruby so it took Ruby by surprise when Wanda enveloped her fingers with her own, in an attempt to provide comfort. "But together, we could understand."
"But you aren't getting off your punishments." Tony reprimanded. "You're still restricted in the lab, and you Princess, are still going to do some training." Ruby thought that wasn't too bad. At least Tony and Steve didn't seem too mad at them anymore.
"That's for me to know and for you not to find out." He winked and then proceeded to open up all the cupboards he could place his hands on to find whatever ingredients he could have in this kitchen.
"Hey, take it easy kid. You hit your head quite hard when you fainted." Ruby then remembered the theme park.
he commited when he was HYDRA's Winter Soldier. Even after all this time, they still couldn't fully convince him that none of that was his fault, and that he, himself, was a victim. But seventy years of manipulation and forced psychological conditioning couldn't be undone with just mere semantics and conviction so they would accept what they could get.
Tony clicked his tongue in irritation. How the hell was he supposed to help the girl if he couldn’t even identify the source of the problem? Steve must have noticed his apprehension because he lightly clapped Tony’s shoulder to get his attention and smiled, “Let’s take her home, okay?”  Tony nodded and positioned Ruby in a comfortable position in his arms to fly home.
"You'll be alright in here?" He asked. Ruby nodded and Steve gave her a smile before stepping out of the elevator.
About 2 minutes later, the medical team arrived. Tony and Steve loaded Ruby on the stretcher and the staff hurriedly assessed her condition even before they had the chance to close the door. Ruby's left temple was bleeding which was immediately disinfected and dressed with gauze. Apart from that, Ruby appeared to be fine.
But despite of all this transcendence the Voice was showing her, Ruby could see so much death. And in the middle of the countless corpses was her. All in a white dress standing proud with self-proclaimed graciousness as her eyes blazed bright in power.
"Sorry about Peter. He's so forgetful, sometimes he remembers stuff he needs to do at the most inconvenient time and just leaves." Ned explained once he swallowed his food.
Lacking the energy to even bother retorting back, Peter just webbed himself up and sat next to Ruby. He got them four orders of double bacon smokehouse burgers and a hot chocolate. Both teenagers were too hungry that for half an hour or so, they didn't even talk. The sound of chewing and slurping coupled with the roar of engines filled the silence.
"Why did you and Tony take me in?" Ruby asked, almost in a whisper. When she felt like Steve wasn't going to answer, she crooked her head to the side to look at him.
After months of having Infinity as her constant companion, she knew deep in her heart that she could trust her. However, she wanted some answers. She wanted to understand what Infinity and Eternity's feud was all about. All she knew right now is that Eternity is using Mordo for whatever vile reason it was. As young as she maybe, she wanted to help Infinity no matter how small it could be. If it meant using her body as a vessel and honing her abilities, then she would do it. But first, she needs to hear Infinity's story.
"Yes, exactly. These were found in one of the meeting rooms on the 8th floor. The site has been under constant monitoring right from when it was discovered by SHIELD agents. No unusual circumstances were reported. Just an ol' abandoned building in the eye of a normal citizen." Fury explained to answer Stark's question.
Peter thought that they were going to argue about how it was much safer for him to stay and help defend the tower so he was surprised when Tony only nodded and the Captain signalled for them to get moving.
"Ruby is within the perimeter of the fight." Bucky, who was in the middle of strapping his holsters shifted his glance at the projector screen. What the hell is seriously wrong with this girl? He was deadly clear about calling him to pick her up when she finished the day. Bucky was totally sure that being the stubborn brat that she was, Ruby intended to walk home, managed to catch Spidey on a bad spot and decided to help save the day. Again.
"Oh my god, Steve! There's two of you now! No, you can't trick me with those puppy eyes!" He exclaimed while Steve just laughed at his misery.
He fired his repulsor beams. Left and right together first, before he twisted his waist to fire at the front and back. The nutjobs were hit straight to the chest with a resonant blare. The impact pushed them back to collide with the other officers behind them while all their weapons dropped down to the floor like a unified surrender.
Ruby ignored what the Voice just said but she did like her suggestion about doing some reading. Having finished high school at the age of 16, she should have been at her second year of university in the UK, doing just as she has planned with her parents.
With a new profound courage and sympathy she felt for her friend, Ruby took Infinity’s hand and looked her straight in the eye.
Ruby had worried both Steve and Tony as well, even if Tony wouldn't admit it. The girl had been withdrawn, engaging in very less conversation for the past few days. So when Steve told Friday to call Ruby down for lunch only to be told that her heat signature wasn't around in the tower anymore, Tony all but panicked and sent one of his suits to find her. He only calmed down when he found out that she was eating at a McDonald’s in Chelsea.
Steve rushed excitedly to Jumpstart after his run. The past twenty-four hours had been very difficult. After getting to spend almost an entire weekend with Tony, to have that pure bliss of spending every moment with him, it was even harder to go back to his own apartment. It felt so empty, so naked, and so lonely because Tony wasn’t there. He hated to say he was turning into the sort of needy person that couldn’t sleep right unless he was sleeping with his boyfriend. He never thought he would be the type – he’d slept on pure hard ground in the war without a problem – but somehow now that he experienced sleeping with Tony, he couldn’t sleep alone. He actually tried to sleep wrapped around a pillow, pretending to spoon it, but it wasn’t the same. The pillow was too soft, too room temperature, and didn’t have the same curves that fit perfectly along his body, but Tony did. Tony was warm and solid and fit perfectly against him, and he missed that falling asleep last night.
Steve looked down at the design swirled in the foam and it looked…incredibly phallic. A proud grin spread across his face and he lifted an eyebrow. “Favorite part, huh?”
Steve just groaned. “No, but just ask for it anyways.” When Tony seemed hesitant he gave his hands another squeeze. “It’ll be worth it, I promise.”
“Right. Well, I’d go with a chocolate muffin today, it’ll add a sweetness to the richness of today’s blend,” he recommended. And while the recommendation sounded the same, it was given to him without any teasing. He sounded distracted. “Anything for your…Bucky?” he asked, and there was that hesitation again.
“So Steve, are you going to stay again?” Tony asked after Steve paid for his usual coffee and muffin. He could swear he heard a hopeful tone in that question, but it could be his own hopes bleeding into what he heard. “Because if you are, then I’ll make your coffee in an actual mug. You know, doing my part for the environment,” he added, trying to sound casual.
He looked intently at Tony’s face, hoping for some kind of reaction, some kind of guide as to how he took the news. In his heart of hearts, he was hoping it would instantly fix everything: Tony would smile, they’d both laugh it off, and they’d pick up on the flirting right where they left off. But he was also a realist, and knew that wasn’t going to happen, but he at least wanted to see that clearing the air helped. He definitely saw some tension leave Tony’s shoulders, and he thought he saw a glimmer of something in his eyes, but his face remained infuriatingly neutral.
Steve just rolled his eyes and pushed his way into the coffee shop, greeted by Tony’s warm voice as usual.
Tony laughed as he set the coffee down on the table and gave him a quick peck on his pouting lips. “Don’t worry, I’ve got a great night planned! If you love it, it was one hundred percent my idea. If you don’t…then it was only twelve percent my idea and the rest was Pete,” he grinned.
The back booth felt real empty without Pete’s presence, and he actually found himself sad that he couldn’t talk to Pete while he waited for his coffee. Sure it gave him unlimited access to watching Tony’s butt without worrying about making Pete feel weird, but he really liked talking to Pete. He had this awkward charm about him and he sometimes talked before his mind had a chance to decide whether he should say it or not, which was a pretty endearing quality. Mostly though, he was just honest, and he really treasured that honesty, especially in a young person. The fact that he honestly missed Pete was a really good sign, and he liked what that meant for their future as a couple.
But despite his wariness of saying anything to Tony, that didn’t mean he couldn’t feel it and celebrate it himself. He didn’t need to hear Tony return those words and he didn’t really even need to say those words, because he could feel that love any time they were together. He was good with that, and he was good with waiting until Tony was ready to hear it.
Pete? That caught Steve’s attention. Who was Pete? The other guy was named Happy, unless his real name was Pete? But that didn’t seem right.
His son already jumped up and nodded and was at the register in a flash while Tony pulled Steve into the back room. He followed after him, still confused and slightly worried at what could have happened that ruined that beautiful moment. Happy apparently got the hint and vacated the room, leaving them alone. Some of his fears went away when Tony turned to face him and grabbed both his hands and brought them up between their chests. “Steve, you said love.”
Fair warning that some days will be long and some will be a little shorter, but I promise there will be some fluff every day =D
“Yeah, you did,” Bucky agreed as he sat down next to him. “But you can fix this. Look, you don’t get jealous over something you don’t want. The fact that he is jealous means he wants you. That’s a good sign, Steve. You just have to go in there tomorrow, explain that we’re not dating, and then ask him out.”
Steve caught a look at Tony’s face, and it looked soft and happy, and he knew he scored points by showing he was open to Pete’s presence. They weren’t officially dating (though he had a feeling they were going in that direction and he was operating under that assumption) but he wanted to make it clear that Pete wasn’t in the way – he was a part of this too and he was ready to be aware of that fact.
“The counter’s in the way,” Tony decided with a breathless pant, and Steve had to say he completely agreed. He would have loved to reach over and lift Tony over the counter, but it was an awkward angle and he wasn’t
He was still so close to Tony’s face he could feel the heat of his blush, and he just had to kiss one of those blushing cheeks. Tony just smiled. “You’re not the only one. Never knew I wanted to be cuddled like that until you,” he admitted softly.
“Touche. Here’s your muffin and I’ll start making your coffee,” Tony gave in as he handed over the pastry.
Steve caught the faintest glimmer of something in Tony’s eyes (were they tears?), but he didn’t get a catch of it long enough before Tony pulled him into an emotional and heart-felt kiss that made his heart swell with…well probably the closest emotion he could get to love without actually saying it – that was way too soon. He could tell by the sheer emotion in that kiss that he did the right thing by asking Pete’s permission before asking Tony. He could feel the warmth of Tony’s feelings for him rush into him, and that kiss screamed yes more than any words ever could.
He continues before Cap can answer. “You’ve been getting my emails, right? I told JARVIS to assist if you needed help accessing the servers, but he didn’t tell me there was any problem.”
“Don’t lie to me. Don’t tell me you weren't there when he got lonely, and vice versa. Just giving a fellow soldier a helping hand, right? That’s what you guys called it back then, isn’t it? Give him a quick blow job before—“
He blinks, not really seeing anything. After a minute or two he shakes his head hard and gets back to work.
“How about you don’t tell me how to do my job and I won’t tell you how to do yours,” Tony snaps, eyes still closed. Cap can’t know he’s walked directly into a minefield, but Tony doesn’t apologize. He’s too worked up. It’s the same old argument he has with Pepper every time he’s in the lab for too long, and he doesn’t want to hear it anymore.
saved him, believed in him, refused to hear anything other than “We’re getting him back”. And now he’s gone, Bucky’s last link to anything he really knows, and Tony’s sitting here, in his swanky penthouse apartment with fucking cracks in the walls and cracks in his soul and cracks in his fucking mind, because he’s stupid and selfish and it has to stop now. Bucky’s right, Tony’s not the only one who lost someone.
He makes it to Steve without collapsing, which he counts as a win. He wraps his arms tightly around Steve’s neck and closes his eyes, tucking his face into the hollow between neck and shoulder that he used to think was made for him. Steve’s arms come around him, enveloping him in warmth, and he’s missed this so much. He can’t even remember the last time Steve held him like this. It must have been months ago.
Steve squints slightly at Tony’s face, though Tony knows he doesn’t really have to—the Captain’s eyesight is perfect, better than perfect, thanks to the serum.
He thinks he remembers Rhodey visiting him, but it’s a vague, fuzzy thing in his mind. It might have been from before, but he doesn’t think so, because Rhodey’s face is all sad and concerned and he tries to get Tony to eat solid food and drink something that’s not alcohol before he goes.
It's not much, he's still not fully recovered, but it's enough, and he pours everything he's feeling into the kiss, all the doubt and uncertainty and fear and worry and love, yes, love, he loves this big stupid blonde Adonis more than he thought he could love anyone, and it may have started out as resentment slash obsession but it's turned into wanting to know this man inside and out and he couldn't stop falling even if he wanted to.
Rhodey's eyes are sad but he doesn't say anything. He knows what it's like to be in that kind of situation.
Tony smiles to himself, stepping into the elevator. “Sure thing, Cap," he calls out as the doors slide closed.
“Not so bad yourself, Stark,” Steve says, smiling. Maybe this will be fun. He won’t be able to enjoy it the same way Tony will, but he can keep Tony company when he obviously needs to blow off a little steam. And he can always leave when he’s had enough; Tony’s a grown man and certainly doesn’t need Steve as an annoyingly sober chaperone.
"Are you crazy, or just masochistic? How long have you been down here, mutilating yourself? Your knuckles look like hamburger meat." Tony doesn't even seem to expect an an answer, just lets go of Steve, stalks over to grab his gym bag, and then reclaims Steve's wrist and pulls him along behind as he exits the training room. Steve rolls his eyes at Tony's antics but goes along with it, wondering at how completely their roles have been reversed since this morning. He still wants to strangle the guy for putting himself in danger, but it's buried under so much fondness at the moment that the anger is just a distant memory. Now Tony's trying to take care of him, and it's nice, if unneeded.
“Fuck you, Barnes,” he snaps, yanking his arms out of Bucky’s grip. He knocks Bucky’s shoulder roughly as he storms past toward the bathroom.
“Sir, it appears there are military personnel climbing the tower stairs, attempting to access your laboratory.” There’s a pause. “I am unable to lock them out, sir. It seems they have broken into my systems without my knowledge.”
“If you hadn’t left them this long there wouldn’t be so many, so don’t start complaining, you did this to yourself.”
“Uh… Thanks?” Steve looks slightly bemused now, and Tony mentally kicks himself. He's talking out loud again—long engineering binges always make him do that. He suspects it's a byproduct of talking to himself and JARVIS for so long.
He wakes up to someone shaking him, calling his name. He’s groggy, everything is fuzzy and his mouth is dry, and he’s laying on something cold and hard. It feels like tile, why would he be sleeping on tile, did he fall asleep in the lab again?
Rhodey shows him the changes to the training area, the new quinjet (Tony just rolls his eyes and asks him who he thinks made the upgrades to it, you idiot?), and then they head to the Caf for a late lunch.
“You don’t have to stay anymore, I’m not going to drown in my own puke or anything,” Tony says, offhand like it isn’t a big deal that maybe he could have, like he’s been in the position before where someone did need to be there to prevent him from dying in his drunken sleep. Another awful stab of feeling, and Steve can’t really take it anymore.
The doctor’s eyes go wide at Tony’s words. “Nothing at all?” he asks, disbelieving. Tony shakes his head mutely. The doctor murmurs something to the nurse behind him and she scribbles furiously on her notepad. He turns back to Tony.
He wakes up the next morning to his phone chiming a text from the nightstand. Fingers clumsy with sleep, he attempts to unlock it, succeeding after a few tries. He finds a message from Pepper, informing him that the SI meeting begins downstairs in half an hour and she expects him to be on time and fully dressed.
Steve must hear something, because he looks right at the camera in the corner of the room, right into Tony’s eyes. “Tony, I love you. I love you so much—“ He’s cut off when the door explodes inward and dust and debris obscures Tony’s view.
Then Steve’s letting go of his wrists and reaching both hands inside Tony’s shirt, pushing both it and his jacket off Tony’s shoulders and away from his body. They fall with a dull thump to the hallway floor and Steve’s hands are back to exploring his chest, shoulders, stomach, and Tony’s shivering from the sensations, unable to control the tremors racing through his body.
“Sorry, Steve. Sorry. I’m out of practice with this. Waking up with strangers in my room,” he elaborates. His eyes slide away self-consciously. “I’ve got some trust issues, to put it lightly.” He squeezes Steve’s bicep before he lets go and steps back, some of his old confidence returning.
Rhodey and Pepper visit him more often now, and Tony guesses that Steve told them what happened. They never mention him, avoid talking about him completely, and Tony can’t help but be grateful. He still gets a lump in his throat when he thinks about him and it takes a minute to be able to speak normally.
Underneath is a sketch done in black ink, of Tony asleep, legs tangled in the covers of the hotel bed, arc reactor exposed and shining bright. It’s breathtaking in it’s simplicity, the details done with such obvious care. Tony stares at it for a long time, wondering if this is how Steve sees him, saw him.
He collapses into the cushions and lets out a frustrated breath. “Okay, I’m sitting. Now fucking answer me. Where is Bruce? And where the fuck were you guys?”
The nurse clucks her tongue at him, though thankfully pulls her hand away. Tony lets out a small sigh of relief, though he quickly sucks in a breath when the doctor takes his wrist to feel his pulse. His skin crawls at the touch and he holds his breath, heart pounding, until the doctor lets go. He pulls out a small light that he shines into each of Tony’s eyes, then tucks it away.
He doesn’t know if he has a home to go back to. He’s been away for months. He doesn’t know if his SHIELD apartment in Washington is even still an option. He boards a flight back to New York instead of DC and rests his head back against the seat, closing his eyes. He resolves not to think about it, or about Bucky, or about anything at all, for the next 10 hours.
“Definitely not on Google,” Tony finishes for him, eyes creased in mirth. Steve’s missed this, Tony’s smile and his laugh, and he realizes they haven't just talked like this in probably over a year. Long before the Accords came around. Probably even before Ultron.
BBC news informs him that law enforcement agents in California have arrived at the scene and are currently searching the wreckage for… anything, really. Parts of the Iron Man armor. A body. There are divers and boats and helicopters, but so far they’ve found nothing.
“As you wish, sir.” JARVIS sounds angry, and worried, and Tony ignores it, because this has to happen, and it’s going to work. He’s not going to let his friends go down from a bunch of shit robots that are a travesty to modern technology.
"Where am I?" He figures that's easy enough to understand. The nurse's eyebrows furrow as she considers her reply. "Hospital," she says, with a very strong accent. She pauses, then continues, "Romania."
In no way am I condoning returning to an abusive relationship. I've been there and I'm a thousand times better off for getting away from it, and I'd encourage anyone in that situation to do the same. This story, and the ending in particular, is just my way of expressing that there are a thousand shades of grey in this world, and nothing is ever as black and white as it seems.
Sam walks up behind the bag to hold it in place, knowing Steve will have to pull his punches so he doesn’t hurt the other man. Steve snorts, throws a few weak punches, then gives up, moving over the bench to start pulling off his wraps. Sam walks over and picks the spot directly next to him.
The realization washes like cold water over Steve, drowning his frustration with little effort. Sadness and regret and grief swirl in his gut, sadness at the state of their relationship, regret over things he should have done better. And grief, because now Steve knows the truth. And so does Tony. Maybe Tony always has. Maybe he just didn’t want to let go.
He sits there, sipping scotch until the sky turns light, his phone sitting innocently on the countertop next to him, screen dark.
He sits and watches numbly as they disappear into the earth, and then Rhodey helps him up to throw dirt on top. He’s moving like a robot, he knows, which is funny, because he’s Iron Man. He goes through the motions, watching as a line of people throw dirt on top of his family, as they slowly walk away back to their cars and limos and go back to their lives.
Tony asks a few questions here and there, and he lets Steve ramble on about the Eiffel Tower (which he’s never actually seen), about Germany and some of the people he met in a pub there (Tony doesn't need to know he met them in 1944 and they most likely died in a bombing raid the following week). He’s got his chin in his hand, elbow resting on the bartop, and he’s smiling while Steve talks, and Steve’s never known the man to be so quiet, such a good listener, and then he wants to hit himself because he never actually gave Tony the chance to listen, did he.
Tony had come up to the compound yesterday, swirling in like a hurricane, talking about improvements in the training rooms and adding another wing to house more quinjets, and Steve was glad to see him, even if Tony seemed slightly more manic than usual. He found out later that Tony’d been having some kind of trouble with the board at SI, and that Rhodey told him to come up for the weekend, get some fresh air. Rhodey said the fact that Tony didn’t even argue with him shows how much he needed the break.
Thor lands next to him and helps, and soon enough they've got Tony out of the pile and they drag him a short distance away.
The doctor looks exhausted and possibly sad, Tony can’t tell, he just wants the damn man to speak. He looks at Rhodey, then Tony, seems to make a connection, then speaks.
Rhodey’s the next one they send to come get him. Makes sense, he’s Tony’s best friend. Maybe they think he can talk Tony out of his funk. Tony wants to roll his eyes but doesn’t have the energy. He’s pretty sure he’s not coming out of this one intact.
He doesn’t make a speech, he doesn’t even remember who does. He has a vague idea that Thor got up there at one point, but has no idea what he would have said. Hundreds, possibly thousands of people have gathered outside the cemetery, wanting to pay their respects to Captain America and his son, but security is keeping them outside the gates, allowing only the small party of private mourners to approach the burial site.
“Steve, where’s Bruce?” Steve looks awkward, and sad, and Tony’s heart sinks. “Where did they take him?”
Cap’s face has gone from earnest to irritated to resigned, and now rests somewhere around determined. He takes a deep breath, chest expanding and holy hell he’s huge, his chest and shoulders dwarf Tony and Tony may only be 5’9” but he’s pretty broad and he works hard to keep his physique toned but it's still nothing compared to Rogers. It's really not fair.
Tony’s throat is tight and he doesn’t have time for this, his team needs him and Steve can take care of Jamie and no matter how much he loves them there are people that need him more right now.
Natasha marks her page with a folded piece of paper and sets it down on the bedside table, next to a tray of hospital food. She grabs a bowl from the tray and raises an eyebrow at Tony. He nods, afraid to say no when she's obviously feeling so murderous. He can be hungry, sure.
Steve grabs his arm as he passes by, pulling him around to face him. Steve is angry, Tony can see it in the clenched jaw, in the high spots of color on his cheekbones.
Rhodey comes back in a little while later. Steve’s sitting with Tony on a black leather couch in the corner of the conference room, stroking his hair gently. Rhodey rolls up one of the chairs from the conference table and sits in it, clasping his hands between his knees.
The nurses exchange looks, though the doctor just nods in confirmation. “Yes, in your last Avengers fight. You fell some distance, though you were wearing the Iron Man suit at the time, which prevented any major injuries.”
His phone chimes somewhere in the pile of scrap metal on his workbench and he ignores it. He’s getting tired of the concerned friends thing, he’s fine, he just has to work himself out of this funk he’s gotten himself into.
They walk quietly, and Tony has half a mind to open up the newspaper tucked into his armpit, but he thinks maybe that would be awkward, even rude, so he decides against it. Conversation, then.
Tony looks away, to the open window with the thin curtains blowing softly. "I don't know, Steve. Are you?"
They tuck into delicious ham and cheese sandwiches and Dr. Peppers, and Tony wolfs down 3 sandwiches before his stomach is satisfied. He leans back and stretches with his arms behind his head, sighing deeply. Rolling his head on his hands, he looks over to Steve and smiles languorously.
"You almost died Tony." Tony opens his mouth to say this isn't the first time, but Rhodey cuts him off. "No, Tony, no jokes. Steve had to call us and tell us to fly over, that you might not make it through the night. He was a wreck. Your team probably hasn't slept since you got here. What were you thinking?" He says the last almost angrily, hand clenching on Tony's shoulder. Tony doesn't complain.
Tony shakes his head again, disbelieving and confused and so, so relieved. Steve’s capacity for forgiveness is unfathomable, something that Tony will never deserve, as long as he lives. “Never again,” he says, quiet but firm. “I promise. I won’t
Rhodey clears his throat, squeezes his hand. “You do, I know you do.” Tony shakes his head again, throat clenching. “You’re listed as her health care proxy. They need you to decide what she would have wanted.” Tony’s still shaking his head, and Steve’s hand is there, petting gently, holding him steady.
Thick, black nothing surrounds him, and he feels like he’s been here before. Lost in the blankness, the calm darkness, wandering around maybe for eons, maybe for only minutes, there’s no sense of time here. Just a faint memory, a knowledge deep down that he’s been here. He knows this darkness, as unknowable as it is, he knows it and he’s intimate with it, and it knows him as well.
Tony’s still in his clothes from the bar, watching Steve silently, and his face is contemplative, assessing, calculating. He’s sober now, one hundred percent aware and all of his considerable attention is focused directly on Steve. It’s slightly unnerving. Steve turns toward him.
“I know I hurt you, in more ways than one, and I’m sorry for that, more sorry than you’ll ever know. But, if you’ll have me, I want to spend the rest of my life making it up to you. Please.”
They settle on the old couch, burn marks and stains and worn leather welcoming Tony’s exhausted body. Standing and bending over for hours upon hours working on tiny electrical connections does a real number on his back, and he’s definitely (sadly) not getting any younger.
They walk hand in hand until they’re only a block from Tony’s hotel. There, Tony pulls Steve to a stop and the other man turns around to face him, question in his clear blue eyes.
There’s movement, and shouting, and he can’t get a shot off because he can’t see straight and his arms are no longer working, but he’s sure he hears a roar, and more shouting and actual gunshots, and then there’s nothing.
Tony grins ruefully. “Well, the hostages are safe, at least. I don’t know about the whole taking-Hydra-into-custody part.”
Steve nods, expression too complex for Tony to figure out, somewhere between tender and indulgent. Then he lays down on his back, pulling Tony to his side. Tony nuzzles into Steve’s massive chest, feeling loved and protected, even if only for the night, and he drifts off to the sound of fireworks and Steve’s steady heartbeat.
Tony nods slowly, turning it all over in his mind. He fell, and got a concussion. It might explain the memory loss. He figures he should mention it.
He wants to strangle him. How can Tony think his life is worth any less than any of theirs? He wants to punch him and hug him at the same time, though he doubts Tony would accept the hug. Tony’s a physical guy, always a hand on the shoulder or a playful shove or a squeeze on the arm, but the second there’s emotion involved he avoids contact like it’s the plague. He’s a man of contradictions, and it drives Steve crazy, but it also makes him want to know more, learn what makes him tick, what makes him smile—the real smile, not the overused Tony Stark publicity grin. He wants to hear that laugh that gets startled out of him, like he doesn’t expect Steve to be funny and is pleasantly surprised when he is. He wants to understand how Tony can be so narcissistic, yet so self-destructive. Love his image but hate himself so much. How he can be so confident on the outside while on the inside he’s just a guy who thinks he’s not worth the effort. Steve wants so badly to understand, so he can show Tony how wrong he is.
People come in from a door he hadn’t noticed before on the other side of the room. Nurses, and a doctor, he recognizes the uniforms. They smile at him and talk and he hears them but doesn’t understand, knows the language but can’t make sense of the words. “You’re awake!” and “How are you feeling?” and “Mr. Stark!”
he thinks. He pushes away the thought and just feels, feels Steve’s lips and tongue and heat and love. He gives all of his love in return.
“And you? What brings you to Switzerland?” he asks. Tony looks back up at him, and his dry smile doesn't hide the dark bruises underneath his eyes.
“I like you,” Tony says simply. Steve’s heart flutters nervously. He’s full of so many conflicting feelings, guilt and desire and shame. Mostly he just want to make sure Tony’s alright, though, so he fills a glass of water and brings it back to him, sits him up and has him drink the whole thing before laying him back down. He goes back to the bathroom to refill the glass and set it on the table next to Tony’s head. Tony blinks at him, eyes hazy, barely tracking. Steve brushes a stray lock of hair out of Tony’s face and Tony smiles at him, grabs his hand and twines their fingers briefly before letting Steve slide out of his hold, eyes slipping shut.
"Wouldn't you, though?" He doesn't know why he says it. He wants to take it back as soon as he does at the look on Steve's face. He back pedals. "Sorry, I'm sorry, I know you wouldn't, I'm being stupid, ignore me--" Steve interrupts him softly.
A few minutes later and the bartender slides a new drink over to Tony, says something and motions to Steve. Tony looks up as the bartender leaves, eyes finding Steve across the bar. He raises his eyebrows, mouth turned up on one side in a puzzled smile, then raises the new drink in a little salute. Steve tips his beer bottle back at him.
Doombots had come flying in from all sides, shooting lasers (lasers, of all things) in every direction, taking out windows and walls and superheroes alike. Bucky had taken off, fleeing the fight or heading towards it Tony didn't know, and Steve had taken off after him, and now here they are on the outskirts of a shit town in Latveria, with Hydra-enhanced-Doombots doing their damnedest to take them all out. Tony’s not sure if they’re after the Avengers, Steve specifically (they’re always after Steve), or the Winter Soldier (who's been taking out Hydra bases one by one since the end of the SHIELD fiasco), but now they’re all here and they’re all under attack, and Hydra and Dr. Doom have apparently decided they have a common enemy (enemies?), and now they’re in this shitstorm.
“I just wanted to thank you. For the funds, and the information. I know you’ve been helping, and I appreciate it.”
Tony can only make a vaguely affirmative-sounding noise. His hands are splayed flat on the workshop bench in front of him so he doesn't have to see them shaking.
He pads softly into the kitchen and sneaks up behind Steve, who’s at the stove, frying up some potatoes and eggs. He wraps his arms around Steve’s waist, teasing his fingers below the hem of the boxer briefs he’d put on when he’d gotten out of bed. Steve doesn’t jump, super soldier senses and all, but he turns his body and pulls Tony into his chest, still tending to the food with his other hand, nuzzling his nose into Tony’s hair.
They’re in the airport the next morning, waiting for their flight to Wakanda to begin boarding, when his pocket vibrates. It takes him a moment to place it, because his cell phone is sitting on the chair next to his leg, screen dark.
Tony thinks about it. Sees the image in his mind again, a flying suit of armor, shining red and gold in the blue sky. Sees Tony Stark, of Stark Industries. Of the Avengers. Sees his teammates, Thor and Bruce and Natasha, Clint, Steve. Bucky Barnes. He shrugs again.
“What the fuck do you think you’re doing, huh?” Tony snarls, pushing hard at Bucky’s shoulders. He doesn’t budge, the fucking prick, but it makes Tony feel better anyway. He pushes him harder. “You have no right being here, this is my fucking apartment, this is my fucking
Tony could never resist a good mystery, and Steve doesn’t have to wait long before he slides gracefully onto the barstool next to him.
There is no up or down, no left or right or backward or forward. Just the heavy blankness of thoughtlessness, and he thinks that maybe he’s asleep, but he feels aware in a way that’s either one of those very vivid dreams, or he’s in some kind of coma. He doesn’t know how he knows he’s a he, but it feels right. Feels like maybe he’s a person, has a past of some kind. Maybe this darkness is purgatory, and he’s waiting for judgement for his sins.
“Tony, oh my god, thank god.” He sounds close to tears and Tony wants to kick himself, but that won’t be happening anytime soon. He can hardly move. He cries out as he feels a sharp pain in his abdomen, opens his eyes to see what’s attacking him. There are people leaning over his body, pressing him down, and Tony tries to sit up, get them off him.
It’s a moment before JARVIS answers. “It is classified, sir. I have taken the liberty of accessing their files regardless, and it looks like they are here for Dr. Banner.”
Rhodey and Pepper are sitting on the loveseat on the far side of the room. Thor is on the floor in front of Natasha, who is carefully braiding his hair into fine little strands. Bruce and Sam are in armchairs, Bruce reading a thick stack of papers with his glasses slipping down his nose and Sam writing in a small book, probably a journal of some kind. Everyone’s eyes are red.
He's in a hospital bed, in a small but very nice room in what looks to be a foreign country, judging from the writing on the various hospital equipment around the room. Somewhere in Eastern Europe, he guesses, trying to remember why he's here.
It’s darkness, if darkness had a texture, and a smell, and a taste. Thick and swirling, like a black fog, it wraps around his body, cushions him, carries him along to nowhere. It fills his senses, smelling like sleep and death and sorrow, pouring out of his eyes in blacks and blues and dark purples and shades of grey.
Steve looks straight into his eyes while he reaches across the table and grabs one of Tony’s hands in both of his own.
“You, too,” Tony says, then he turns back to the direction he’d been walking before his impromptu coffee stop and resumes his trek.
They’re all sitting around him, his team, his friends, and he feels like he doesn’t know them at all.
He can’t pull his hands back even if he wanted to, he’s got no control of his limbs, but JARVIS, true to his word, moves the armor around him. The gauntlets shudder and jerk, moving haltingly, but it’s working, JARVIS is pulling wires and fuses apart and the Doombot looks like it’s starting to fail as well.
He pummels the punching bag but it refuses to budge, leaving him feeling wound up and unsatisfied. It’s reinforced, like everything else in the gym, made strong by Tony’s genius, strong enough to stand up to repeated abuse by super soldiers and Norse gods and everything else the Avengers can throw at them (though Tony has asked Natasha and Clint to practice their shooting and knife skills in the range and save the bags for the “gym rats”).
SI profits are soaring and the Avengers are avenging with all of their new equipment and tech, and if Rhodey gives him these sad eyes when he comes to visit it’s easy enough for Tony to ignore.
Steve had followed him across the workshop and was now standing directly in front of him, almost crowding Tony to the countertop. He looks serious, and so goddamn beautiful Tony catches himself wondering again how he got so lucky. How this is his life. His eyes flutter closed as he leans up for a kiss, and Steve indulges him, cupping Tony’s cheeks in his hands gently.
“Explain it to me.” Steve thinks for a moment that maybe he’s pushed too far, he’s a stranger as far as Tony knows, and this is deeply personal, so personal that Steve and Tony couldn't talk about it without it deteriorating into a fight. But maybe they were too close. Maybe Tony will tell some stranger, someone willing to listen to his side without judgement. Maybe Tony will finally explain in a way Steve can understand.
It’s like that time the shrapnel dug into his chest. It feels like getting hit by a bus, stealing all the breath from his lungs and it takes him a moment before he can get air in. But somehow this is worse, because it’s Steve, it’s the man he loves saying they shouldn’t be together, and Tony knows it’s his fault, he did this, and he has to fix it,
bed that he’s decided may as well be his new home. He certainly can’t face anything else in this tower. Too many memories. In the bed, too, but if he faces the bathroom he doesn’t have to see the flat sheets and bare pillow, the lack of a warm body lying next to him. He’s got it all worked out by now.
He uses the crack as a guideline, keeps his eyes from straying any further along the wall. He’s gotten to know the wall pretty well; the hairline crack, the dark blue/denim/whatever the fuck color Pepper decided on when the place was built, the crown moulding, the bathroom door with the shiny silver handle. He’s only had 48 hours to get to know it all, after all.
Steve takes a breath, steeling himself. Sam is quiet behind him, a supportive shadow. “For striking you. I— I shouldn’t have done that.” He almost whispers the last. “I’m so sorry, Tony.”
“I miss you, Tony.” Steve’s so serious, and if by some chance Tony wasn’t still in love with him he definitely is now. He feels his stomach swoop as Steve continues. “I know I’m asking a lot, I know I don’t deserve a second chance, I know you’ve moved on with your life, but…” he trails off, for the first time sounding uncertain. “I— You make me feel so much. So
Steve sits down carefully beside him, gaze cautious as he takes in Tony’s less-than-stellar condition.
“I’m so sorry,” Steve continues, voice choked. Tony opens his eyes, didn’t realized he closed them, and sees tears trailing down Steve’s face.
“Steve,” Tony whispers, and he wishes he could say something other than Steve’s name but there’s nothing. He doesn’t have anything because Steve’s hasn’t left yet, Steve’s apologizing and saying he loves him and he’s not leaving.
Tony turns to a tablet he’s brought with him and begins to work at something that could be Iron Man designs or could be more details for tonight’s mission. Steve doesn’t really want to know either way, he’s already keyed up enough as it is. He decides he needs a distraction and pulls out his sketchpad and a pencil, and before long he’s lost himself in his art. Some time later he comes back to himself to find that he’s filled the page with Bucky Barnes. Bucky from the war, Bucky from their shared apartment together, Bucky on the Cyclone at Coney Island. Bucky falling from the train, reaching for him. Bucky on the bridge, when Steve saw him again for the first time in 70 years.
Tony grits his teeth, looks back down at his worktop. He’s soldering very tiny bits of electronics together and Steve fucking Rogers is not going to make him lose his concentration over a conversation they’ve had a hundred times.
He carefully puts the phone down on the table, safely away from any scrap metal, and gets back to work, not surprised but disappointed anyway when there’s no reply.
“What is your problem, Tony?” He grits out, squeezing Tony’s arm. Tony thinks there might be bruises tomorrow, his grip is so tight.
“It’s kind of early to be drinking, isn’t it?” Steve asks, glancing over at Tony. Tony can’t read his expression.
“Where’ve you been?” Tony asks, and Steve tells him France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, England. All the places World War II and the Howling Commandos took him. He stretches the truth a bit, tells him he backpacked after college for a year, hitchhiked and stayed in hostels and all the things kids do now before they settle down with a job and a wife and kids. Tony nods like he’s interested, and maybe he is. Maybe he wants to know Steve’s mostly-fabricated story. Or maybe he just needs a distraction from his own life, from the Accords and Pepper and his team split down the middle while he tries to clean up the mess left behind from the last six months.
He doesn’t know for sure, but he thinks he’s the kind of man who couldn’t wait for answers to just come around, who would go out and find them himself if he had to. He decides to go with his gut.
Tony talks over him. “—what really bothers me is that you dropped off the face of the earth afterwards, like it’s totally acceptable to not speak to me for two weeks after something like that.”
He nods and answers just as quietly. “A blanket, please. And maybe a pillow?” He thanks her as she fishes some out of the cabinet and hands them to him.
Steve grins back slowly, sensually, eyes dark with desire, and Tony wants. He wants so much. Steve's face is mischievous as he pushes Tony back onto his pillows again. "You need your rest, you've got a long day tomorrow," he says, all helpful and innocent and so, so sexy.
Steve’s angry. Fuck, what did Tony say to make him angry this time? Is it the drinking? No, he’d been upset about that but was just fine when he was asking if Tony needed to talk. Maybe the mention of Pepper?
Tony shakes his head, clears his throat. His eyes flit away, unable to hold Steve’s brilliant gaze any longer.
He also knows about Howard's obsession with finding him, that Tony was held to impossible standards as a child. Knows that's most likely the cause for the resentment Tony felt towards him when they first met. If only Steve had known, maybe he could have prevented the blow-up on the helicarrier, maybe he could have been more tactful, more understanding. But he didn't know, and because of everything, because of Howard, Steve has had to work through all of that childhood grief to get to where he is now, and it's still not enough. He wants to know more.
Steve shakes his head sharply, breath hitching once before he takes in a lungful of air and lets it out in a whoosh, reigning everything in. He breathes deeply again and drops his hand, opening his eyes to find Tony kneeling in front of him.
“He says he didn’t ask you to clean anything, and that he will, I quote: “Clean the whole fucking kitchen later, Jesus Tony.””
“You’re a beautiful woman, ma’am, and I’m flattered,” he says, smiling. She takes the hint graciously and smiles back before standing up.
Tony doesn't know what to say. He's speechless, which has happened less times than he can count on one hand in his entire life, so he doesn't say anything. He just stares at Steve's beautiful face and reads everything that's there for the taking, and he leans forward and kisses him as passionately as he can.
“You’re a terrible influence on him,” Steve says after he breaks away, grinning ruefully. Tony laughs, hiking Jamie up higher against his side. Jamie makes another happy gurgling noise.
). He hasn’t been romantic with anyone since before he left for that last weapons demonstration all those months ago, hasn’t really even thought about it recently, what with everything that’s been going on, but something about Steve draws him in, makes him want more. He thinks maybe Steve feels it, too, and then suddenly he’s not thinking anything because Steve’s hand brushes his where they’re swinging down by their sides. He startles a little, but neither of them acknowledge it and when it happens again Tony doesn’t pull away.
“I know, Tony. I just hate not being there to help you guys. I worry, is all.” Tony doesn’t have anything to say to that. He knows the feeling, when he’s the one sitting in the saferoom with his eyes glued to the computer screens, gunshots and screams in his ears and nothing he can do but wait.
Tony flips imaginary hair over his shoulder with a prim hand. "It's because nobody can pull it off quite like me. You like it, it’s okay to admit it.” He flutters his eyelashes ridiculously.
Steve shakes himself out of his melancholy when he hears an argument at the other end of the bar. Leaning forward in his seat he watches as the bartender speaks sternly to a man in German, gesturing angrily at the cigar hanging out of his mouth. The man snorts, says a few heated words back that Steve probably knows but doesn’t bother translating in his head, then removes his cigar, blows the smoke out almost violently, slams back the rest of his drink, and stalks out of the bar. Steve assumes his tab is already paid because the bartender doesn't chase after him, just shakes his head sullenly and mutters under his breath.
So he doesn’t get it when Tony asks him out on the town and immediately follows it with an eye roll and says, “Why am I even asking you? You don’t know how to have fun.”
“Will it make you feel better if I get Natasha’s approval first? She can go through all my clothes and pick something that meets your standards.”
Tony’s shocked, completely thrown, has no idea where it comes from, and it hurts. It must show on his face because Steve apologizes immediately and blames it on work, on the new team not coming together as well as he’d like them to, the stress is just getting to him.
“Steve,” Tony gasps out. He can’t breathe, his throat is closed up and his chest is being squeezed by bands of iron and he can see the Tower, he’s flying down Park but it’s too late, Steve’s dying in front of his eyes and he’s not even there to save him, to help him.
“No really,” he says. “I paid them to not report my score. Told them to say I was there for the alcohol. I think the newspapers said I was a caddy.” He shrugs, hand dropping off Steve’s back, and Steve misses the warmth immediately.
There’s the requisite snarking and teasing, and Tony downs the coffee, and Steve manages to get one pancake into him before Tony’s back at his workstation, reinventing the future in ways only he can.
The nurse speaks to him while he drinks. “You’ve had visitors, of course. They’ve come to see you every day since you’ve been here, your Avenger friends.” Tony takes a last sip and looks up, straw dropping out of his mouth.
Tony can’t say how long they stay like that. Long enough for the tears to stop. Long enough that he worries every moment will be the last, will be the moment Steve pulls away from him forever.
A ball of paper hits Tony in the side of the head and he gasps in mock outrage. Turning, he puts a hand over his mechanical heart.
It’s true, he does feel better, holding their son in his arms. Jamie is the spitting image of Steve, and seeing him is hard, very hard, because he sees Steve in everything the kid does. But it’s almost a good pain, bittersweet, being reminded of his husband so vividly. It’s cathartic, and soothing, to know that Steve is living on in the world, that part of him is still right here with Tony. That Tony can see that part of him every day, and he take care of Jamie and love him and treasure him and remember everything wonderful about Steve every time he looks into their son’s sky blue eyes.
Tony’s just finished loading the dishes into the dishwasher (he doesn’t even have to wash them, they have a fucking dishwasher, how hard can it be?) when Friday speaks again.
Tony and Steve spend the extra time getting to know each other. Tony learns that Steve enlisted way back in 2003, and that he’s a Captain. His specific role in the Army is “Classified” (which really just means a little more work on Tony’s part to figure it out, “Classified” has never stopped him and Jarvis from finding out before), and that he was actually
He’s showering after a particularly spectacular round of sex with Steve, contemplating whether he should actually get dressed when he’s done or just stay naked. Steve’s in the kitchen, having decided they needed sustenance, and though Tony had told him he was perfectly fine with not leaving the bed at all today, Steve had insisted on the grounds of Tony doesn’t eat right when he’s not here, so he’s damn well going to eat right when Steve’s here to feed him personally.
“Tony, I need you to understand, this wasn’t your fault. Okay?” Tony says nothing, and Steve sighs before he continues. “We were called away on a mission, the Avengers were, and JARVIS told us you were unavailable. That you would catch up to us, and that Bruce was out of town. So we went.”
He’s found the leader of the Doombots, that’s for damn sure. A big hulking thing with a massive electronic panel in it's chest that Tony’s sure he can take out the entire swarm with if he does it right. Only it’s covered by some kind of forcefield, some new thing Doom invented, and so far nothing’s been able to get past it. Everything they've tried gets fried before it can touch anything important.
The cabin is quiet, and Steve glances around to find that everyone has fallen asleep. In the back of the plane, Clint’s head is leaning against the window with his mouth wide open, Natasha resting against his shoulder, her body curled into him, both of them tucked under a warm-looking quilt. Bruce is curled up in his seat, blanket cushioned between his head and the wall and another covering his lap. Thor hasn’t moved since he fell asleep after the briefing. Tony’s head is tipped back against the head rest, mouth fallen open slightly, hands still on the dark tablet in his lap. The rings under his eyes are more prominent when he’s relaxed like he is now, with no smiles or sunglasses to draw attention from them, and Steve wonders if he slept at all last night, despite the fact that he’d told everyone else to.
Steve huffs, and before he can get a word out Tony cuts in. “Khakis don’t count, grandpa. Neither do slacks. You know what, forget it, I’ll get you clothes, if you want it done right you have to do it yourself,” he says, muttering the last bit to himself, pulling out his phone.
“Tony,” he says, and his voice doesn’t make it as far as Tony’s ears, but he knows Tony heard him all the same. Tony’s eyes flicker between his, back and forth, and his arms come down to settle on Steve’s shoulders, bracketing his head. The music is blaring, saying something about finding love in hopeless places, and Steve feels like this is exactly where he’s meant to be in this moment, in a dark club with loud music and confetti streaming from the ceiling and Tony Stark in his arms.
The rage wells up without warning and he punches the glass and it shatters, pieces falling noisily to the countertop around his clenched fist. He notices the blood before he feels the pain, the ugly throbbing of his hand. Grabbing a towel left next to the sink, —
“I’m sorry, sir, they have shut down the elevators as well.” He sounds apologetic and frustrated, but Tony doesn’t hear that, can only hear the men storming up the stairwell across the room.
He’s not even sure if Steve came to bed last night. It wouldn’t be the first time. They used to make it a point to sleep in the same bed, no matter how busy Tony is in the shop, or how much paperwork Steve has to fill out after a mission. It doesn’t seem so important now.
Tony curls into him and Steve’s heart aches, eyes burning with the terrible emotions churning inside him, regret and guilt and love. He kisses Tony’s forehead, lets his lips linger perhaps longer than is necessary, lets himself indulge, just for tonight. Tony sighs and relaxes into sleep, and Steve lies awake and holds him for a long time after.
It’s fucking perfect, is what it is. It’s movies and popcorn on the couch, and half-hour makeout sessions that don’t always lead to more (but mostly do, which Tony is totally okay with, no complaints here), and random texts that make him burst out laughing because Steve is
He hears Steve sigh, sees him get up and walk over to Jamie’s crib, smooth down the little tufts of dark hair on his head. Tony’s heart clenches.
Gandalf beats Dumbledore in a magical showdown. You’re out of your mind, Banner, I can’t even handle you right now.”
It’s good, fucking amazing, Steve pistoning into him, hard and deep and perfect. It’s not long before he feels himself getting closer, hears it in the way Steve’s breathing changes that he’s close too, as Steve’s thrusts become less controlled. Tony hovers on the edge for endless seconds and without warning Steve reaches down to palm Tony’s cock, strokes once, twice, and then he’s coming, vision whiting out at the edges, and he can just hear Steve choke on a breath as Tony tightens up and Steve thrusts one last time, deep, and he’s coming too.
Steve huffs a laugh through his nose, petting the back of Tony’s head, smoothing his unruly bedhead down. “You’re such a brat,” he rumbles, throat moving under Tony’s mouth. Tony starts kissing it, following the vibrations when Steve keeps talking. “I made breakfast, there might still be some left if you get up now,” he says. Tony hums, biting at a particularly nice patch of skin. Steve makes a startled noise, then sighs and stretches his neck out, the hand on the back of Tony’s head becoming more possessive, pulling Tony into his body. Tony makes a happy noise and obliges, wriggling and getting more comfortable, one leg thrown over top of Steve’s and lips moving down his neck to mouth at his clavicle.
There are two couches in their little area positioned around a small table, which holds a bucket of ice, two glasses, and what’s probably very expensive scotch.
Someone is petting his head, murmuring his name, and he remembers that he likes this, this is a good thing, and then he’s out again.
“Is that what this is, Steve? Are you breaking up with me?” Tony means to stay angry, but his voice breaks at the end and his throat is burning. He will not break down in front of Steve and Sam Wilson, and why the fuck is Wilson here anyway?
He’s watched the interview so many times he knows it by heart. They’ve been playing it on repeat, between footage of the house collapsing into the Pacific.
Steve’s strong hands rub up and down his back soothingly. He’s murmuring calming words into Tony’s hair and Tony can’t believe how stupid he’s been to risk this, how lucky he is, how amazing this man is, that’s he’s still here, holding Tony after what he did. Tony can believe that Steve forgives him, he doesn’t lie about things like that, but Tony swears to himself that he’s going to make it up to him. He’s going to give Steve everything he deserves, for as long as he’ll have him.
Steve returns from his run on Saturday morning and showers before he heads straight to Tony’s lab. Normally he’d be in the gym until about lunchtime, lifting and training and studying team stats, but that’s when Tony doesn’t come up from the city for the first time in months.
Tony had half-expected the Captain to stay away out of spite, or obstinance (since the spite in their relationship has faded into something not quite so spiteful, maybe wariness, or guardedness), but he supposes even he can be wrong. Sometimes. Rarely, but anything can happen, really.
Rogers runs a hand along the back of the leather couch, fingers catching lightly on seams. “And call me Steve, please,” he says before Tony reaches the door.
“We don't make each other happy anymore, Tony. I never wanted that. I want you to be happy,” Steve is saying, voice tripping and breaking dangerously over the words.
Tony’s eyes are liquid brown pools full of compassion and desire. They search Steve’s face, taking in everything, every feeling Steve would rather keep hidden, every thought he’s ever had about the man in front of him. Tony smiles softly, a small thing that’s so intimate Steve wonders if he’s ever smiled like that for anyone else before, and he wants to keep it, wants to hoard it and not let anyone ever see this side of the enigmatic billionaire except for him.
Steve stays where he is, asking the medical team questions and getting stilted replies, occasionally talking to Natasha and Clint, who can translate Romanian for him. Bruce is tucked into a corner, meditating now that the professionals have taken over. Thor watches the action quietly with a sorrowful look on his face, and Bucky hasn't moved an inch since he boarded the helicopter. Steve can tell he's uncomfortable, though his posture is relaxed and nonchalant; his eyes keep darting to the pilots, then the doors, then to Steve and the rest of the Avengers, and Steve can only hope that he can hold it together until they get Tony somewhere safe.
Steve’s eyes are agonized when he speaks, but his voice is level. “There’s been an accident.” Tony reaches out for the dresser behind him. He’s 21 again and there’s a police officer telling him the same exact thing, that his parents are dead, were killed on impact. He shakes his head sharply, pulling himself back to the present, though he’s not sure if he wants to be here either. He wants to ask Steve who, but he can’t get the words to come out. Steve hears him anyway.
“Well, for what it’s worth, I think you did an amazing thing, stopping weapons development. There are enough weapons in the world already. You’re very brave for standing up for what you believe in.”
Steve’s still looking at him expectantly, so Tony makes his decision. “My hotel is right there,” he points. Steve looks over his shoulder, then back to Tony’s face. “If you’re still trying to get to the park, you’d better hurry, you’ve got less than an hour ’til go-time.”
Tony rests his arms on the dresser and bows his head, eyes welling up and breath hitching dangerously. He allows himself ten seconds before he takes a deep breath, wipes his face, and disappears into the bathroom with a change of clothes.
Tony waves his apology away impatiently. “Fine, great, you're sorry for hitting me. Apology accepted. What about leaving me? Not talking to me for two weeks? Are you sorry about that, Steve?”
“Tony, you’re mine.” Steve says, a flare of heat in the words. Tony stops trying to talk, instead tries to make sense of Steve’s words. “You’re mine, and I’m sorry that I hurt you, if I ever made you feel unwanted. I can’t pretend that we’re not— that we’re not sweethearts, anymore. You’re mine and I want everyone to know that, no more lies, no more hiding, no more misunderstandings.” Steve has drawn himself up to his full height, determination in his stance, red rimmed eyes boring into Tony’s.
"Hulk, I need Bruce here," Steve shouts into his comm, voice on the verge of panic. Some part of his mind is screaming that he's too late, Tony's already dead, but he ignores it and yanks off the faceplate. Tony's face is pale and slack, and there's blood running from a cut somewhere above his hairline. Steve leans forward, checking for exhalations, but there's nothing, no breath stirring against his cheek. His fingers find no pulse, either, just clammy skin. Someone drops down to their knees next to him, and Steve looks over to see Bucky reaching for the armor's releases. He snaps out a hand to grab at his arm.
He finished his coffee faster than yesterday under the guise he was almost late for work, but that it was worth it. He still got a sly smile from Tony as he told him he’d see him tomorrow, and he chose to hold onto that, but his insides were squirming with worry. As he left the shop, he knew what he had to do before he could let this go any further (even though he was already in far too deep) – he had to bring Bucky to the café.
Bucky looked shocked, like it wasn’t the question he was expecting. “Oh no, he’s a hundred percent into you. No question.” Steve breathed out a huge sigh of relief. So maybe he had been imagining all that distance between them? “Don’t look so relieved Steve; that’s not the problem.”
He switched his attention over to the case of baked goods, and honestly they all looked good, but trying to decide prevented him from looking at the barista, and wasn’t that the whole point of this trip? “What do you recommend?”
Tony lifted an interested eyebrow. “Well, now I’m even more excited for our date. What’s the dress code?”
Except he did know what it was. His mind had been trying to tell him, and he had been ignoring it, but he couldn’t deny what that emotion was any more. That was love. Pure, beautiful love. He was in love.
“No no no! This is good! I’m not—I’m just so happy!” Pete exclaimed, his face shining with joy. “No Steve, he really needed this! He’s needed to date someone for a long time and he talks about you all the time at home!”
“Yeah I…I guess we will,” he sighed. He went over to his counter, feeling like he missed his moment. He had a perfect lead-in, he had everything he’d been waiting for…and he chickened out. He kept his focus on Tony because he could just feel the disappointed looks he was getting from the other customers, and he could feel Pete’s disappointment burrowing a hole in his back. He could understand it from the kid – he lied to his dad to get him that smooth lead-in, and he blew it.
“Yeah, we’ll talk about it tonight,” Tony decided. He handed Steve his card back and stepped aside to make the coffee, which gave Steve time to talk to Pete.
“No,” he said resolutely as he walked up to the counter, and Tony looked a little taken aback. “Well, yes, I do want my regular but—hold on. I have something to say first. Bucky isn’t my boyfriend.” He heard a loud thud like something dropped over where Pete was sitting, but he didn’t take his eyes off Tony. “We’ve never dated. I thought about—yesterday it probably seemed like we were, but we’re not. Bucky’s like my brother; his family took me in after my parents passed. I would never date him.”
Tony had leaned in to place the coffee near him; it would be so easy to lean in and close the gap between them. He felt this strong sense of need surge through him to close the gap, to kiss those beautiful, soft lips. He’d imagined kissing them so many times, but after feeling so much electricity just from a touch, he knew a kiss would feel a million times more incredible. He wanted it so badly – his body cried out for it – but he knew he couldn’t go for it. That was definitely too bold.
Wow, yeah he had been staring. Way to go Steve. He recovered with a bright smile of his own as he leaned against the counter. “I know. It’s because that was the most beautiful smile I’ve ever seen; I had to stare.”
That seemed to break Tony out of whatever haze he was in and he looked up at him quizzically. “What are we role playing?”
He had to wait to answer because he honestly couldn’t form words right now he was just so happy, but that wait gave enough time for Pete to stand up, his hands gesticulating wildly in excitement. “Wait wait are you—I can’t believe this. Did you…you finally asked him out?! You finally did it! Thank God!”
Tony doesn't hear any more. There’s a high-pitched whining in his ears, and his vision blurs. There’s no way, Bruce is indestructible. They can’t, they couldn’t, he doesn't understand. Bruce is just Bruce, he’s his buddy, his science bro, they watch stupid movies and play chess and argue hypothetical nerd scenarios with each other. Why would anyone want to hurt Bruce?
He’s lost his breath before, probably more times than any one normal person should be able to say. But he isn’t normal, he never has been.
Tony nearly growls, slamming the dishwasher door closed and drying his hands on the hand towel next to the sink before stomping out of the kitchen.
