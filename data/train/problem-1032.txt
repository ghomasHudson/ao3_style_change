An hour later Rosie was awake again, crying for a bottle. Still awake John stood up to take care of her. He couldn’t help but wish that he still had someone to share these responsibilities with, but not her. If Mary had loved him, she never would have shoot Sherlock, or tried to do it a second time. John’s own love had been in question since then, only put out of question when Sherlock had reassured him that Mary had also ‘saved’ Sherlock. But now he knew that wasn’t true. If she had ever loved him in an unselfish way, she never would have tried to kill him.
“Is there anything else Moriarty wanted you to do?” Sherlock asked, looking up from the cards in front of him.
John, sitting in the cab, took a deep breath. He looked out the windows, to try and get a general idea of what direction they were heading. He thought of Rosie in danger, of Mrs. Hudson, probably in danger, and now him in danger. He thought that he had an idea of what was coming, but dismissed the thought, as it was too painful to think about.
“Sorry,” he croaked, mouth dry, “Sorry to wake you.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Sherlock. She’s marrying Greg.”
“Left a message with Carlo, the butler, she was out.”
Mrs Hudson cannot meet his eye “There are so many secrets”
“There is nothing to gain by concealing anything from you. Complete frankness, however painful it may be to me, is the best policy in this desperate situation to which James's folly and jealousy have reduced us. You’d better sit down; it is a long story.”
The sarcasm wasn’t lost on Sherlock as it might have been in the past. He looked up at John and smiled. The red mist threatened John again, but he folded his arms, he would not strike, however angry he felt.
“That was a matter of life or death.”
“Sherlock to be honest, I feel like the luckiest girl in the world. I have not only found my life-long companion, the lover of my heart, but my soul mate, someone who turns my grey skies into blue.
“You can next time.” Mary replied, as she brushed passed him to pin another post-it to the wall. John gave her a squinty look; he was never entirely sure when she was joking.
Flowers –
After that things got a little rowdy. Mrs Hudson seemed to have forgotten she had banned Mycroft from her house, and handed him a large Glen Fiddich which seemed to improve his mood no end. He looked even jovial… for Mycroft, but even so clung like a limpet to Greg’s side.
Sadly, it appeared it was time for Sherlock to face the hard facts. John‘s romantic conquests were legendary, he had been a widower for over a year, it was almost inevitable that he should become enamoured of someone. Despite the lack of evidence, having eliminated the impossible, whatever remained, however improbable, had to be the truth. Somehow, without giving any signs of her presence an unknown woman had inveigled her way into John’s affections. This brilliant beauty with her ebony hair, ivory skin and no doubt pert bottom had captured John’s thoughts and desires and was poised to take him, and by default Rosie, away from their home in Baker Street. Sherlock had always schooled himself to be content with whatever crumbs John chose to strew his way and now even that little morsel would be gone.
Crowley got no further with this thought as the door flew open and he found himself staring instead at a flushed and rather flustered angel.
“German husband number three, the one that got away. Dinah married him ten years ago, still alive, never divorced.”
Sherlock gave a half laugh, “I am not sure she would appreciate being classed as a possession.”
Meanwhile in Scotland...
“It appears that marriage has been annulled.”
Sherlock put down the thermometer, picked up a spoon and brought a drop of the mulled wine to John’s lips. John blew gently and then tasted it.
Patrick and I have been away from home today visiting friends in Norwich. We got back about half an hour ago and I took a constitutional around the garden checking the outhouses and barn as I usually do when I discovered the attached drawing again hidden under the pedestal of the sundial. I have not shown this to Patrick as I have no wish to upset him further. I would be grateful for any update on the progress of your investigations you are able to give.
“Sherlock?”
Mrs Windibank was a shrewd woman and quickly appraised the situation. “Well don’t leave them on the doorstep, invite them in. I am sure they would be pleased to see Mary and how well and happy she is looking after her little adventure.”
Mummy and Mrs Hudson rise to the occasion, Sherlock deprived of planning duties drives everyone to distraction until Mummy begs Lestrade to find her son a case. Scotland Yard obliges and the engaged couple spend three days in Camberwell on the trail of a poisoner before taking the day off to get married.
There was a long silence as they computed this fact, which was finally broken by Steve.
“She did before.”
“I think he went outside,” Molly replied.
“Really, John, you’re not my keeper, I am of age and don’t need your permission to go out.”
******
John, comparatively sober but still rather worse for wear reviewed the situation, then took himself off to the bathroom to change into his pyjamas and to brush his teeth, he used the toilet and drank a glass of water before refilling it bringing back into the room to put on the table on Sherlock’s side. John took a long look at the bed before deciding, it was a big bed and the room was bloody freezing, he scooted under the covers and switched off the light.
Mycroft replaced the handset into the telephone cradle of his private, private line and sighed.
Sherlock stood, stretched and rotated his neck with a satisfying pop. “Plenty Gilbert, but I’d like to have a look at the CCTV next.”
sadly had a poorly couple of days so have fallen behind with this challenge, I have the last three chapters drafted out so will finish even if it is a few days late!
John isn’t moved.
"To all of it?"
Aziraphale jumped up and the pen started writing again furiously.
“After we all moved to Lyon Place, I began to feel down. I had always thought it my own special place but as soon as he moved in Mr Windibank began to lay down the law.  Like I said to you yesterday I was not best pleased when Mother remarried eight months after Daddy died, it all seemed rather soon. I had no wish to stand in the way of her happiness but now it seemed she and Mr Windibank were determined to prevent mine. He never wanted me to go out, not even to see our old neighbours in the Tottenham Court Road, and he never wanted us to have visitors if he could help it. He would say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to Mrs Etherege, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and I had not got mine yet.
“What is it?”
“There would be shock and grief that I understand,” Sherlock frowned, his look giving lie to his words. “But surely the natural reaction would be to seek revenge or justice, not oblivion.”
Sherlock opened the door, John was sitting bolt upright in bed, wide-eyed but otherwise quite calm.
Prematurely as it happened, the caller replied again, at length, and with a hint of menace causing Mycroft to expostulate. “What you are suggesting is tantamount to blackmail!”
******
“None of us are getting any younger!” John replied as Mrs Hudson slipped out of the room.
Sherlock thought this was possibly a ruse, and that there was almost certainly a directive not to allow him to look around on his own. But as the geography teacher led him away from the Headmaster’s study down one passageway and then another until they came to a small door partially hidden by a curtain, Sherlock supposed that it did save time to have an escort. The door opened onto the cloisters that surrounded the central courtyard of the old priory.
“Ethylene glycol!” Sherlock barks at him suddenly, breaking Stamford’s reverie. “Detectable in food?”
Finally, the Investigating Officer let him go, and Sherlock took a cab back to Baker Street, it was a filthy night, cold, wet and dark, and matched his mood exactly. He felt none of the elation that he usually felt at the satisfactory conclusion of a case. Yes, he had been the means of bringing Dinah Shepherd to justice, but he had achieved this at the expense of his relationship with his closest friends. Lestrade, Mrs Hudson, Molly and most importantly John had all been taken in by his subterfuge and it made him feel very uncomfortable. Sherlock twisted the thin gold band on the ring finger of his left hand round a little. Dinah had bought it and ironically Sherlock thought it suited him rather well.
“It’s a bit cold out.”
Sherlock wasn’t sure.
“She displays considerably more tenacity too; they are engaged remember and planning a wedding… Plus there is something about her, something I cannot quite put my finger on…”
“I keep meaning to ask you, quite what are you planning for this first dance?”
“You knew the Duke when he was a young man?” Sherlock reckoned Debbie to be around five or six years the Duke’s junior but despite the age gap, and the difference in class, he was sure their paths would have crossed.
It is no laughing matter to be chastised by an angel, Crowley reminded himself as he tried to keep a straight face under the onslaught of Aziraphale’s wrath. The problem was that although he had started out as the Angel of the Eastern gate, complete with flaming sword, Aziraphale’s manifestation of anger amounted to no more than a pout, and a great deal of sighing interspersed with a few tuts.
“Are you William Sherlock Scott Holmes free, lawfully, to marry Dinah Elisabeth Shepherd?”
Sherlock did as he was told, and Steve put the truck into gear and set off back the way he had come. In the mirror Sherlock watched as Danny pushed the bike through the gap in the hedge and clambered over the stile, climbed on and started peddling furiously down the bridlepath. He was soon out of sight.
John finished writing up his notes, switched off his computer and put on his coat before turning off the lights and going in search of Sherlock.
John bristled and he clenched his hands into fists, “Why do you always have to do it?” he spat out. “Why is it always your life on the line? You know how important you are, to me, to your mum and dad, Mrs H, even Mycroft.
At the Diogenes Club, Aziraphale pressed the fiver, now restored to pristine condition, into the hand of the major-domo and was shown into the strangers’ room to await the arrival of his prospective kidnapper. At his request, the waiter brought him a crème de menthe frappe and some ten minutes later, Mycroft Holmes.
Sherlock nodded, “Good”
“The Queen only considers me for the wealth I can bring her, but you see me for who I really am, and so if you are willing, I would rather be married to you.”
The deceit, the deaths, the multiple identities, the hidden bank accounts, each disclosure landed on John like a blow, leaving him gasping for air and disorientated. Mary had come to him during the still dark days of Sherlock’s demise, and given John a reason to keep going, a reason that was now revealed as artificial and contrived.
“Thank you, your assistance has been invaluable. I cannot…” Sherlock’s final words were interrupted by Dr Huxtable rushing out to meet them.
“I did wonder at the time if Alex and Jo would make a go of it, and if they would eventually settle down, but instead they drifted apart. Jo got involved with some New Age Traveller types and went off with them, Alex spent a year in Australia, working a bar, surfing, sailing, exploring. Then the next thing we heard was that Jo had been killed in an accident. My father had inherited Holderness by then, but I only saw Alex a couple of times before he died the following year.
His mother took over while he recovered, “Chris would have lived in your father’s bookshop if we’d let him. It was his favourite place right from the time he was little. I loved it too; it hasn’t been the same since it changed hands. I’m sorry for your loss, Mary.”
“Gentleman here to see you… not got an appointment. Not a rep.”
“Shut up. What if she hadn’t tried to be smart? What if she’d gone for a bullet instead of poison? I couldn’t have saved you then.”
The result was a rough approximation of his previous home, as if put together by someone who had only read a description and never seen the original. That was the problem, Sherlock thought sadly as he reached for his phone, perhaps it would have been better to make a clean break rather than trying to recreate something that could never be restored.
“Thirty-five times so far and she’s been out every one. I get the picture.”
“Portland Place, by Riding House Street.”
“Like I said originally Gordon, someone who can make it worth his while which means someone with money and a lot to lose, footballer, pop singer, politician…”
She held out a piece of paper, that had obviously been folded in her gloved hand but the inspector didn’t take it. Instead he motioned her to show it to Sherlock. Even from a distance John could see line of dancing men were different from the others so far.
Sherlock was much more pragmatic. “You can have the bed,” he said, taking a suit out of its carrier and hanging in it in the wardrobe, “I never sleep during a case.”
Sherlock quickly deduced the rest and rattled off his findings without revealing their sources. Two years nursing in Australia (small tattoo) before back packing in Malaysia (collection of leather wrist braids). This man would easily make a success of army life, resilient and with a strong sense of duty of care for his patients, compassionate, kind and down to earth. Sherlock reassured him that his girlfriend would be true while he was away and snuck in the deduction that his boyfriend would be too for good measure. Bill, the name the man had given Sherlock, burst out laughing and called to his companions now waiting outside “Hey, this guy’s good”
“Hop in.”
“You never said.”
Sherlock demurred, turning a delicate shade of pink. “Your contribution was important too, John, Alice’s comments about her father’s view of Paul as a potential suitor made me suspicious and more aware of their genetic link.”
“Catterick, Freetown, Seria and now Wilvercombe. Three Continents Watson strikes again!”
Though it was when Sherlock returned and Mrs Hudson, who had already had her herbal soother for the night, got on to the subject of her and the late Frank Hudson’s compatibility in the bedroom that John drew a halt to the proceedings. It might be the eve of Sherlock’s wedding but there was no need for that kind of talk.
Baker Street - the evening before the crack den
“Drink up. Cottage, three minutes, last cubicle, furthest from the door.”
“It’s not very often I have one up on the Holmes brothers. I didn’t hear what you were up to, but I heard enough to know that you were up to something. I gathered Mycroft had enlisted your help to separate Greg from Dinah Shepherd. I assumed he knew that she was behind the deaths of her first three husbands and wanted to save Greg from a similar fate. I was always on my guard from then on I never thought you would go as far as to marry her.”
Sherlock was almost to the door, he never chose to spend longer in his brother’s company than was completely necessary, but he turned and facing Mycroft said.
As the Duke finished making the arrangements, there was a knock on the study door and a uniformed police officer appeared requesting the presence of his Grace. The Duke made his farewells to Sherlock and John and went with her.
“A person with average intelligence and observational abilities should be able to develop the skill. Let me see,” Sherlock turned his head and did a quick reconnaissance of dining room, “what you make of them?”
Sherlock replied simply. “Her hands”
“You see, he knows things, he told me things about myself that he could only have known with the second sight. Things about Mother and Father, and the typing, and where I live and work.” At this juncture Mary turned her tear stained face to Sherlock, “You have to help me find my Ian, I have no one else to turn to.”
Sherlock with his newly discovered aptitude for deduction had gladly shown off what he could glean about the forty-something merchant banker from Tunbridge Wells with a category three golf handicap and Border terrier. At some point during the stream of deductions the boy

“Born 12
John requested a copy of the will online, there was a fee and he absently drew out his wallet and paid with his own card, so they were soon reading the contents. The will had been drawn up in 2002 and apart from the usual clauses and items regarding funerial arrangements it revealed two things. Firstly, that Mrs Flugrath was a considerably wealthy woman with assets valued at just over two million pounds, mainly comprising the house in Lyon Place with the remainder in cash, stocks and shares. The second was that, aside from a couple of small bequests, Mrs Frugraph had left everything to her niece Mary Sutherland.
“For what happened before, on the phone, you know… when… I…”
A noise outside, the lift whirring, someone is about.

Except he didn’t do that anymore, just like he didn’t cheat on his wife, neglect his daughter and abuse his best friend. Funny, it was Sherlock’s psychotic sister who had finally called time on the drinking. He’d gone home after one of their sessions and poured ever last drop of alcohol down the sink. He’s stuck to it too, apart from the one time. But then when you have witnessed half a dozen needless deaths and faced your own watery demise then perhaps you can be allowed a temporary lapse, but from now on it was nothing stronger than tea.
“Greg’s Dinah?”
“Look Sherlock, we need to move the victim…if you’ve finished that is?”
Aziraphale had conjured up tickets for a concert at the Albert Hall the following evening, and then had been invited back to Baker Street where Sherlock had demonstrated how he would have interpreted the Brahms.
Just as they were despairing of ever finding a solution to the eternal triangle that Sherlock now found himself a part of, Aziraphale crinkled his nose and smelt a whiff of brimstone in the air as the club servant knocked on the door and announced, “Mr Anthony J Crowley.”
“Moriarty! He’s gone!”
Meanwhile, Miss Vanjie decides to retreat to her room. “I have severe mid-morning grumpiness,” she says. “I can’t believe I put on my chest glitter for a big bundle of
“Well,” John says. “After last night’s penthouse date, I’m exhausted, so I’m going to bed.”
Shangela looks at him with brows drawn. “I was robbed! Didn’t you see All Stars 3?”
A sudden noise startles him. Someone’s in the church - he stands up.
“That’s safe to assume. Shall we order room service?”
“Yup,” Detective Inspector Lestrade confirms. “The first winner of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK. Judge Graham Norton called him an....
“No, you’re right, I’m sorry.” Jonathan sighs. “I feel like I haven’t gotten to know you well enough yet. I mean, three days ago I thought you were straight.”
A clue that M is a meddlesome maniac.
“You…” She-lock stutters, suddenly realising. “
“Are you…?!”
“Kidding,” John says. “Kidding! Sorry.”
It feels like a blow to John’s stomach. “That’s unfair.”
John and Jonathan’s private date is a bit more calm, and John is grateful. They do a river ride together, past beautiful mechanical animals, inside dark rooms, sitting in the same boat. The pace is slow, and in the background, cheesy music plays. With them in the boat, a cameraman and soundman sit, but they ignore them as well as they can while admiring their surroundings.
John scoffs. That’s a fucking ridiculous plan.
That’s all it takes. John grows rock hard. He groans, cursing himself for his teenage boy behaviour.
“She means metaphorically,” She-lock explains.
“Well, a favor’s been called in. My expertise is needed.”
, Sherlock thinks while eyeing Mary’s deep-cut blouse,
“Lipstick will be a big improvement on you,” She-lock continues, picking up her sketchbook. “Your mouth’s too small now.”
“You killed yourself in front of me, and then came here dressed as a joke…” John shakes his head. “I was so angry, when I left this church.”
“I was promised six minutes of screen time!” Todrick says. “I ate a hotdog in the back of Ru’s car for this!”
She-lock takes John’s hand and drags him behind the vanity curtain.
Sherlock steeples his hands together. “I wonder what this all means,” he tries to humour him. Put him on the wrong scent.
John buries his face in his hands. He hears the bottle being opened behind him, and runs his fingers through his hair. This is it. Is he really going to go through with this? This is, he can’t deny, going above and beyond what any friend would expect while asking seduction tips.
Has he forgotten him that quickly? Rude.
John pauses. Sherlock can feel him breathing against his ear. Likely, John too needs to recover from the experience - but
you fill the gaping hole Bill Wiggins left and become one of the suitors on this show,” Sherlock says, face hard.
“I can sleep on the sofa,” Sherlock says.
Suddenly, he hears a foreign sound – a strangled sigh, and the whole world seems to stop, even if the water keeps streaming. He hesitates, turns the faucet off, and then opens the shower door, to peek his head around the corner. He nearly gets scared to death. Right there, on the closed toilet lid, Sherlock sits, his long legs crossed.
“Aren’t you?”
Not that it was a
“John, I know you already have a lot of excitement in your life. First in the army, and now with Sherlock solving cases,” Karamo says. “I want to show you ways to relax, without letting the comfort of domesticity feel like a threat.”
“Well, if I may so inform you, it is capable of it.”
is on the list,” Sherlock says, suddenly uncomfortably close to his ear.
He stays there for hours, staring at nothing, losing the faith he never even had. Going over all events in his head. Has he made the right decision? Was there really no other way? He must leave the next morning, and tear Moriarty’s web down. Will he die on this mission? Mycroft seems to entertain the possibility. Was this his practise funeral? Will he tell John the truth eventually, after Sherlock’s death? What will John feel then?
Sherlock can see a vein almost popping in Mycroft’s forehead.
A head peeps up. It’s a man -
Mycroft rolls his eyes. “Oh, please. Everybody wants that codename. I’m afraid we reserve that number for our employee of the month.”
Jonathan rises and leaves the restaurant without looking twice at the buffet. John can relate. He, too, is not hungry anymore.
John turns back to him. Right. He has just confessed his undying love like an idiot. What if he was wrong about this? What if Sherlock doesn’t feel the same - maybe he just really likes white roses. Maybe he’s heartbroken about watching Jonathan disappear.
“Nervous?” Jonathan asks, as the large metal beast starts climbing.
He can’t help but stare at Sherlock. They’ve both emerged from the Aston Martin, John looking like he’d just shared a seat with twenty clowns in a tiny car, Sherlock looking like he’d just been to a spa. Sherlock really looks the part in his slim-fitted black suit and tailored white shirt, complete with a black bow tie. The stakes are always high when it comes to Sherlock Holmes, but now he looks like he’s walked straight out of a 1960’s casino heist film.
John is right, of course. This
“You know, he kissed me,” She-lock says. “Before we got on stage for the lip sync. I forgot to put on lipstick, and he kissed me, to solve it. And now, he’s just a policeman?”
“Well, he
The music cuts abruptly and dramatically. The only sound is now the light buzz from the hydraulic lift as Sherlock is excruciatingly slowly lowered back to the stage. Meanwhile, a small crowd has gathered around Jonathan Wilson, who’s lying next to a shattered floodlight, rubbing his temple from where the broom hit him.
Sherlock is trying desperately to think. Because of their bodyswapped state, Moriarty might actually kill John, accidentally. Or will he target him first, thinking to tease him with his ‘pet’? Which scenario would be better? Sherlock is a skilled boxer and fighter, and has some moves Moriarty wouldn’t expect of John. Then again, John is not without skill either. Both of them could put up a fight.
“What brings you to the Gold room?” Bill Wiggins asks.
“For this week’s main challenge, you’ll be making over these British army veterans,” RuPaul says.
Mycroft scoffs. “More like an illegal download.”
. They did not catch the killer, did they, those
“Yes. I got the good name in the family, believe it or not. And before you ask: his drag queen name would be Thigh-croft. Mycroft was seven years older. So even though I had a brother, I very much felt like an only child. Mycroft was smart, well beyond his years. He left the house at fifteen, to attend university. He works in government now…. High up. When he left, I… I was eight.”
John clears his throat. Better to accompany Sherlock, actually, now that he thinks about it.
There’s also a very awake cameraman and a sound guy present, eagerly filming the commotion.
John knows exactly what to do: he needs to slowly lower his body in a different position so his hard-on won’t be noticeable. He crouches a bit and releases Sherlock’s thumb from his hot mouth with a pop. Sherlock breathes out heavily as John stretches his body next to him again and decides the next lesson is
“They better not have messed with my room,” Sherlock says when he arrives.
“That’s what I thought.” Sherlock’s voice is cold as ice.
“He’s been getting bad critiques,” a voice startles him. It’s Anderson, leaning over his shoulder.
Meanwhile, he flips Sherlock’s hand under the table and softly caresses his palm.
Sherlock attacks the vacuum seals with his teeth while John parks.
Sherlock notices John’s fist is clenching, though the rest of his body is perfectly still. John breathes hard through his nose before resuming his speech.
“Shut up,” Sherlock says, even though John hasn’t said a word. “Listen. David is right. It’s going to be final dates soon, and what do I have to offer? No. Shut up. I don’t know if I’m any good… at anything. I’m an adequate dancer. But is that really an indicator? I need more data to sufficiently theorise.”
“I’ve never been to Disneyland,” John says, squinting his eyes at the sight.
It’s all fine.
He opens a drawer. Syringes and a stack of sick notes. Boring.
my date, apparently.” John demonstratively re-opens the laptop. The e-mail is signed by Sebastian Wilkes, Director of the Trading Floor at Shad Sanderson. John frows. The somewhat arrogant young investment banker who had provided them with the case one week earlier, doesn't seem like the type to organise a murder mystery party. Let alone that it would be appropriate, so shortly after the murder of a colleague. Although those City Boys aren't particularly famous for their EQ, of course.
“It’s fine,” John says, frowning. Did Sherlock like his haircut? Christ. He feels like a teenage girl ready to whip out her diary.
He puts his index finger over John’s lips, while using his other hand to rub up and down John’s thighs. John swallows. He should probably put a stop to this, now. With some difficulty, he breathes out.
“You first,” Wiggins says.
“I took you to three continents, and you learned nothing. You only conquered, and fired your gun,” Sholto continues.
“Bam!”
“I think we better leave”, she says. “All three of us.”
“And yet you remained so clueless,” she says.
to be here. This was just a convenient cover since he’s currently investigating a part of Moriarty’s web that’s laundering money in this very outdated, rusty beachside fair. This place shouldn’t exist anymore - it shouldn’t be making the kind of money it does.
“There’s been an additional threat to Michelle Visage, and I just wanted to keep you informed because you’re paired with our main suspect,” Lestrade says, adding a mumble: “Somehow. God help us.”
But John.
“We’ve only filmed two episodes so far, we can easily switch ‘m up now. Tell the public Wiggins turned out to be a druggie, was booted off the show and we replaced him with a willing candidate.”
A few hours later, while John is on the sofa watching television and Sherlock is staring down his microscope, his phone pings.
“Where have you been, Sherlock? I’ve been
In this soft light, Jonathan is a truly breathtakingly gorgeous man, John notices.
“Don’t get bitter, just get… out!” Alyssa says, stretching her arm toward the exit dramatically.
Then, Jonathan guides the cameraman out the door. Before closing it, he winks into the camera.
“It’s all fine,” John says.
“This is a magical place,” Jonathan says.
“So,” John says, swallowing. “Jonathan Wilson.”
“Most likely it's an empty threat,” Lestrade says. He clears his throat. “But yes. According to Sherlock, this can go three ways. Possibly it's an empty threat, a prank of sorts.
“H… how are you?”
“I’m not going to masturbate
John shakes his head. “That was just some kids playing with an airgun.”
Karamo pulls John into his arms. Into his really, really muscled arms. “What a cool place you guys have.”
, those are backdated posts I put on a timer,” Shangela says. “I’ve been Bran Starking all over the ‘Gram. You think I can’t rule my seven kingdoms from inside a box? I’m a media mogul, honey. Thanks for following me.” She winks.
John hesitates.
Sherlock notices his body is doing something strange - leaning toward her, donning a half-smile, almost… blushing?
Sherlock tries to grab it. “I should confiscate it,” he says, suppressing his smile.
He and Mrs Hudson are going to have some serious words later.
“They’re the same brand, I suppose,” Sherlock answers.
Can you hear the (alarm) bells?
“You know I’ll do the washing,” John says, hoping to break the tension.
“Pull down my pants,” John instructs.
John can’t help but snigger.
John licks his lips. Sherlock’s cock is absolutely beautiful. It’s long, and for a moment John is intimidated imagining all of it inside of him, but he steels himself. It’s doable. Definitely doable.
They're lists and lists of numbers, they mean nothing to John, who doesn't exactly have the mind of a decent bookkeeper.

sent them after me.”
“Splendid,” he answers, staring at David and Sherlock tensely chatting in the distance.
(Also, 88thparallel is the best thing to happen to this world since the Beatles.)
Well. It didn’t take long for Magnussen to make good on his threats. Should he have refused the rose?
Where’s this suddenly coming from?
In the background, Sherlock fiddles with his microphone.
Miss… thing?
“Yes, undercover. They’re… laundering… criminals… They’re….”
“That's none of your business”, Sherlock replies indignantly. And suddenly, John knows what's going on. Victor is likely a former lover, a first relationship that ended rather badly, wounds not fully healed. What was it that Sherlock had said? Women –
red colouring in there - as a crime drag queen, she must have an emergency bag of fake blood around somewhere.
“Yes, it's infinitely boring,” Sherlock says. “Entertain me. How does John Watson convince people to play doctor?”
John gets up so fast that his chair falls backwards on the wooden, expensive floor. He hits his fist on the table, and stares at it.
“What?”
“No, please, continue”, Sherlock begs.
John takes Sherlock’s rose and wraps his hand around its stem, lets a forgotten thorn push against his palm. He shouldn’t be thinking about it. But he can’t help himself.
It takes a few more minutes until Sherlock joins them at the table. Maybe he was adjusting his pants, trying to hide his boner, John's mind unhelpfully supplies.
And also, a ton of loose change.
“Oh no. At most it’s a parody.”
. His steps seem a lot smaller. This is disorienting. Like miscalculating the dose of a drug so your limbs feel all wrong.
“No.”
John’s back straightens. They sit very close, almost intimately so. It must look cosy, to the cameras.
“Yes, tell him how you feel, and all that. He might…” Sherlock stops, and sighs deeply. “You never know when your last chance is to…”
“Of course not.”
John can hear Lestrade shuffling uncomfortably on his seven inch heels. Little does She-lock know, these ‘army men’ are the exact Scotland Yard he’s reading to filth. John was hired shortly after that case closed, but he remembers reading about the serial suicides in the paper. It was quite gruesome.
The Fab Five could ruin not just his jumper collection, but everything that’s been good between Sherlock and John.
John approaches the castle, and lingers near the entrance as the Alices shove the cart into a doorway, closing the door behind them. John runs up to it, and tries the handle. Locked. There’s a sign on the door -
He smiles reassuringly, but the moon is shaded again, and the darkness is a hot and heavy blanket. John puts his feet back into his slippers, and ascends the stairs, shedding its weight. During the night, time seems to be shaped differently, and it's as if the world is inside out.
“We actually made a triple booking of dance instructors,” Miley explains. “Accidentally.”

“Stay out of it,” She-lock says. “Focus on painting your mug, darling. You look like you’ve been cast as an extra on ‘Chernobyl’.”
John glares, and ends the call.
John nods. Is he sweating?
“What the hell are you doing?!” Sherlock says, running up to him.
David and Bainbridge’s horse rears in distress, throwing off David. Meanwhile, Sherlock and John’s horses take off running, fast.
“Like it says on your card, yeah?” John continues. “You talk to dead people?”
“I will solve the case on air”, Sherlock says, “I will have the murderer arrested, and leave the show. It'll be good for ratings.”
Sherlock has been hiding something from John. John is not amused.
He sounds hoarse. Exhausted.
If only posh Donald Duck wasn’t watching this whole scene with his dead brass eyes.
“I’d like to organise a case for him,” Sherlock says. “As a gift.”
“We could use the magnifying aquarium glass,” Sherlock offers.
Sherlock frowns. “I’m perfectly fine.”
“You still there?”
John throws him some serious side-eye. Has Lestrade been taken as well? “The
John jumps up, quickly extracts the perfume bottle from his waistband and holds it in front of him like a gun, menacing.
“Of course,” he replies, mentally lying beaten on the floor.
John does not wake.
“Sherlock, look at me,” John says. He sighs. Beneath them, the English countryside is rolling by. He sincerely wishes for a Union Jack parachute right now, if only he didn’t have to sit here with Sherlock and his brother’s whore.
Sherlock throws off his dressing gown, gets up and stands straight as a rod. “John?”
“We’ll quickly be off then. Kill you later!”
“I’m going to the party of a lifetime,” Sherlock says.
It’s so intense, John covers his face with his hands.
-Ornacia: a doll face that was part of an infamous costume worn by Vivacious
“I’m not saying anything!”
It feels as if John’s entire soul has dropped into his shoes.
Moriarty approaches him. “You won’t mind if I search you first, right? Need to make sure you don’t carry a knife. I’d hate to lose a piranha to this.”
Sherlock puts his hand over the microphone, but John can still hear him.
Sherlock visibly rolls his eyes, and John braces himself.
“I’m you, aren’t I?”
“John! John! Wake up!”
“I know you’re not dead, you daft bonehead,” he says. “You couldn’t execute the plan without me, remember?”
“You’re on,” PA Miley says, and pushes them into the light.
She-lock wipes tears from her eyes, then becomes a lot more serious.
Sherlock startles and stares at his plate, completely frozen.
Sherlock whirls around on his feet. “Really, Gav… Geor… Lestrade. I would think even Anderson could have solved this one. Look at the way she’s dressed. Quite fancy for her, especially when you take a look in her bedroom closet. Designer dress, the most expensive earrings she owns, Chanel perfume. She was preparing for the evening of her life. So, she thought she’d pop a bottle of champagne. Popped right into her eye” - he points to the bruised wound - “now this would normally be merely an inconvenience, nothing lethal. But with her, it triggered a tumor that had been growing behind her eye for a while now. Prescription for new lenses on her desk, you see…”
He uses red chalk to draw a five-pointed star in the middle of the table, and puts the lock of hair on top. Then he surrounds it with small candles. They light John’s eyes on fire.
She smiles knowingly.
“You’re about as coherent as the Trixie and Katya show,” She-lock rolls her eyes at the accusations. She? A drama queen? How dare he. She takes Sharon’s drink from her hands and splashes it into Mycroft’s Skype face.
“It’s all fine, John. The show’s sponsor is loving it. Anyway. I talked to Jonathan already, he’s keeping you around for today’s dates, so please, do whatever you can to convince him those touches meant nothing.”
“Exactly.” She-lock leans backward. Her dressing gown rides up, revealing even more of those long, smooth legs to John. “And yet. The order of eliminations has been posted to Reddit. Just like on All Stars 2, by an ex of Alaska. History repeating itself...”
-To get trade: to get a one night stand with an attractive man (with no long term potential)
Would have been okay with the pod, at the moment.
John Watson, a grown man, stands there weeping softly now. Shoulders hunched, looking at the floor, clenching his fists. The whole church is quiet, save for the ruffling sounds of handkerchiefs. Even Mycroft wipes away at his eyes. John slowly turns away to get back to his pew, facing Sherlock.
“You better clear your schedule for the next two weeks,” John says, releasing Sherlock’s thumb from his mouth. “I need my detective, because I plan on committing murder over and over again.”
. Men –
“No, thank you, I’m good on all my blackmail,” John turns to his desk, looking to assemble her clothes. They must be somewhere in this office. “Now if you’ll please…”
No. Magnussen may be a creep, he’s not the type to get his hands dirty with anything other than ink. Definitely not the killer.
. ‘I’ for Irene. You never could resist a touch of the dramatic, could you? And the codes for the escape room. 23537 - on a cellphone keypad, it spells ADLER. And 1058, it suddenly came to me where I heard that number before. You used it, as a fake code when I was trying to figure out how to unlock your phone.”
Well,
Sherlock looks at Mycroft, eyes bulging. This is impressive. He must have pulled a lot of strings to get them down here.
Wiggins turns his cards. “Straight Flush. What do you say to that, Mister Holmes?”
Sherlock looks him up and down.
He tucks a blonde curl behind his ears. Straight as an arrow or not, he’s really aiming to win this show, no matter how tight the corset. John will give him that.
Sherlock is staring at Magnussen and Jonathan ordering drinks together, when Janine shoves a cocktail glass in his hand. It’s filled with a red liquid. Sherlock sniffs it.
Sherlock’s broom.
Then he recovers, and drinks John’s tea.
Another pause. Sherlock looks into his own, stunned, disbelieving eyes, unmistakably John looking back.
The actual Sherlock startles, snapping the pants’ elastic band hard against John’s skin.
She-lock’s mouth twitches.
He turns to a nearby table, where there’s a single red rose and a large bottle of rose scented massage oil. He pours some of it on Sherlock’s back, and rubs some oil between his hands, slowly heating them against each other.
Who wants to
“Oh, you know, he was a complete wanker even then”, Victor says. Is the bloke wearing eyeliner, John suddenly wonders, or are his lashes just naturally so dark? Victor touches Sherlock's sleeve playfully. He's stock-still.
John's fingers freeze for a fraction of a second around the artichoke he's been weighing in the palm of his hand. They're in the middle of a brightly-lit Tesco, John is mentally cooking their evening meal while trying to keep Sherlock away from the sweets aisle, and he's not prepared for curveballs in the middle of the produce section. Carefully, he lowers the artichoke in a see-through bag.
John swallows.
As a Sherlock-shaped figure keeps struggling in his harness just below the edge of the rooftop, the actual Sherlock glances at his homeless network, now pointing and scratching their heads. Not very good for his street credibility, this.
“You can fill in the blanks, I suppose,” John says.
“That’s right,” the real Mary says, in Moriarty’s high-pitched voice. “We swapped bodies, right while we were in the middle of our beautiful plan. He was lying ‘dead’ on the rooftop, I was looking at John through my rifle’s lense. Then, in an instant, we switched.”
Sherlock jumps out the taxi and they argue all the way back to the apartment.
“Oh, come off it, John,” Sherlock snarls, eyes closed. “Don't worry about your little
“This is how you walk!” Sherlock replies.
“Lucky for you, I’ve applied some real James Bond tricks,” John says.
As if that doesn’t matter, John turns to Sherlock.
“There is no case in Southend.”
“You forgot to ask me, yesterday,” he says more quietly.
Even so, it must have been in passing.
John eyes the Bible. That’s bloody Lestrade and Dimmock in there, recording sound bites for months to come.
John looks appalled down Sherlock’s body. “
“... the more I believed you couldn’t have done such a thing.”
“Well. You were gone this morning, so,” Sherlock says.
“You know. The song?” John says.
Janine joins them. She slaps them on the backs. “Let’s wrap this up, shall we. We’re already running late on schedule.”
. And John hates it. As if such a betrayal can be soothed by carrying grocery bags.
When John sits on his bed, hair dripping, bathrobe feeling not nearly tight enough, he glares at the two men.
He doesn’t really need a makeover, really.
“Fuck,” John says to himself. He turns off his phone and starts pacing the room. That’s the last thing he needed. His own rejection - his own obvious want and need for Sherlock - to be publicly dissected and taken to polls. And once they start airing
Maybe that is precisely the reason John shouldn’t do it.
, I imagine,” John says.
“What about Janine?” Jonathan asks.
Feel free to guess where. ;)
He winces, but doesn’t hold up his arms as John approaches him fast. He looks sad, and very much
, for god’s sake. But this, She-lock thinks, this disheveled looking crowd of misfits looks the worst of all.
The moment he realised something was off, John knew he had two choices. Fight or flight. But he would be up against five men in possession of sedatives - and who knows what else. Or who else. Just like in the army: sometimes it’s better to retreat and to come up with a plan, and then strike back harder.
“Technically,” Sherlock tries, “it’s your body. Your boner.”
Sherlock looks like he’s using all his strength to stand still. “Risk of the job, John. I was caught in Serbia. I managed to send Mycroft a message just before it happened. But it took him… weeks.”
“That’s kind of…”
“Sherlock...”, John admonishes him, but then he quickly shuts up as he sees what's in Sherlock's palm, what was hidden in the salmon.
“I’ll eh…” she says. “Give the other one to Sharon.”
John crashes through the penthouse’s door, nearly falling into a surprised Sherlock.
While he waits for his turn, Mary approaches John.
More like suicide.
The Eye starts moving again.
In the background, REM’s song
can’t be a murderer. He looks so… nice.
And boy… talk about
John manhandles Sherlock away from the crime scene.
Soon after the threat, strange things started happening to Michelle. First, her judging chair fell apart mid-taping. Its rear leg had been partly sawn off. Then, her night cream smelled suspiciously like day cream. She’d only
. Just, you know, to help him. So he knows he's safe and all.
Sherlock swallows. He is not going along for the fake cremation. It really is his last chance to say something to John. To look at him. To stop him hurting. But he can’t blow his cover. He
Both John and Sherlock work through their Victor issues.
Good. Only a couple of octaves too high. With one hand, John seeks support from the desk in front of them, with the other he grips Sherlock’s curls a little tighter. His hips start thrusting with Sherlock’s pace, now, short hard pushes. John squeeze his eyes closed.
“I'll assume you're Daddy”, Sherlock says, without missing a beat, staring at Sam. Victor about chokes on a shrimp.
And takes out a Goofy plush toy.
“I experiment all the time, John!”
“You know, She-lock, that lipstick...” she says. “That man could have easily used his fingers. But he used his mouth.”
It’s Janine. She lets herself in, happily prancing inside the room, and turns to him.
“The name’s Holmes,” he says as he puts it between his lips and lights it. “Sherlock Holmes.”
-  the on-set medic, so I got to know Jonathan behind the scenes, actually. When a spot opened up…”
Sherlock glances at him. “I was merely pointing out a fact.”
There’s only one choice, here, really. The woman woman. She-lock.
“To the main road, 009,” Sherlock says. “How’s your French, by the way?”
Behind him, the bathroom door opens. Out peeks a head.
“What are you implying?”
“Who?”
The murderer is getting desperate, John figures. That’s hardly a threat at all.
His arm is hung around John’s shoulder, dropping down slightly into his shirt. His hand rests hot on John’s collarbone.
John’s first private session is the next day, with Antoni. They’re standing inside the 221B kitchen, while Rosie is sleeping upstairs.
When Jonathan pulls back, there’s a faint frown between his brows.
“I just don’t think you should be flirting with my body,” Sherlock says, a little calmer.
John picks up the chair, and moves it back to its position. He leans on it, and Sherlock can’t help but admire John’s strong arms holding it, gripping it so tight -
Luckily nobody willfully pays attention to German tourists.
“I don't think he should draw that much attention to himself again,” he says.
Sherlock bites his bottom lip. John searches his face. Is he being sarcastic? John’s heart flutters in his chest like a trapped butterfly.
To be fair, each and every queen’s makeover man looks downright miserable to be here.
as much as a dress-up show, in which drag queens compete to be crowned this RuPaul Charles’ favourite. To be named ‘the future of drag’ - though John was barely aware that there’s a
, John thinks.
He searches Sherlock’s face for a reaction.
“Errrrr… I’m just replacing Michelle while she’s recovering from her breasts-just-a-bit-more-surge-again-ry,” BenDeLa stutters. “I was only trying to be congenial.”
“The family is deeply saddened by the loss of our son and brother,” he starts. Sherlock sighs. How very
“I truly am sorry, John. In my mind I was back here… countless times.”
John rolls his eyes. “Just sleep, Sherlock. Don’t you want to look good on your wedding day?”
Sherlock roll his eyes.
Luckily, he doesn’t get many customers, tucked away behind the hall of mirrors and sandwiched between a magician and an illusionist. He is a disillusioned island.
“It’s nothing, John,” Sherlock tells the wall.
John knows that face, that close-to-orgasm type of gasp, those glittering eyes. It’s a breakthrough. What else could it be?
bladder.”
He blinks at himself. Is this, then, the sum of his life?
Sherlock smiles.
John nods.
“Merci, thank you,” Sherlock says, falling back into his French accent. He attempts to drop his voice a little though, to further elude John. He mustn’t find out it’s him, since John’s life could still be in danger.
“Now you sit, I need to focus. Don’t say a word, it will distract me.”
“When I'm... sober.” Sherlock buries his head into his long fingers. Damn that Victor, John thinks. If he ever gets his hands on him...
John startles. He feels mortified.
Sherlock blinks rapidly. “But that's... against the rules.”
Good lord almighty. He might be untuckable.
“Yes… Yes, I’m here,” Sherlock manages, tearing up.
There’s still time to refuse the flower, but John steps forward. Soldiers don’t leave their friends behind, no matter what. If they were really shot at earlier today, then more is at stake than just a reputation. What if John leaves, and Sherlock gets hurt, or dies? What if Jonathan dies, and Sherlock will have a lifetime to blame John for leaving and not saving him?
“Now, She-lock from the House of Holmes,” Ru announces. “And her drag sister, Joan Pads-on. Where did you get the inspiration for your outfits?”
She remains unmoving. Actually, that’s also a win. Considering the… crossed legs.
“Not ‘him’. Not ‘step away from him’. But ‘step away from her’, that’s how you’re supposed to address a drag queen. In case you’re wondering.”
“I hear you,” Karamo says, “We’ll handle one baby at a time.”
“None of the goodwill places would take them,” John says.
John frowns. “I don't understand.”
He throws
Sherlock's face falls. “I didn't want you there, John. I asked you not to come.”
She stops just short of Sherlock and leans close. She caresses his neck with her gun. “Come on now. Impress a girl.”
“There’s only one snake here and it’s your ex-girlfriend Alaska,” Sherlock snaps back.
“Also, eh, sadly, the skull painting and the skull on the mantle had to go,” Bobby says.
Not… murderous as much as disinterested, perhaps. Though She-lock seems to be an expert at hiding emotions. There could be a murderer brewing underneath those layers of mascara, John reckons.
What’s gotten into John?
“John-,” Sherlock whispers, desperately.
John glances over to Sherlock. The posh git has taken over the reins and is concentrating on guiding and calming his horse, while Jonathan grips him firmly from behind. Sherlock is talking in a steady voice, to the horse, though John can’t hear what he’s saying.
“I’m not gay,” John says.
“Oh, like YOU exercise,” he says. “You’re skinny as a bloody rat. That ridiculous bouncy castle would’ve bounced you right back against the brick wall like a feather.”
While Miley hastily offers Dimmock and John some elimination lipsticks, She-lock retreats to the back with the other queens. She’s boiling with anger. If John thinks he can just… manipulate her like this...
“Oh god, I just found a bowl of eyeballs,” Antoni says, fear clouding the poor man’s eyes.
“Yes, Sherlock’s fine. For example, he bought rounded furniture after our flat exploded. And when I cut him out of my life because my retired secret agent wife got killed protecting him, he still came by and asked after her. I know he loves Rosie.”
Sherlock tenses, but doesn’t move away.
“Oh, don’t you know? Before Drag Race, She-lock’s asshole was the number one tourist spot in London. She finished Grindr like a video game.”
“So sorry,” he mumbles, trying to de-buzz his brain. This wine is crumbling the mask he so carefully carries.
Upon the words 'enter me', John nearly loses it. He pushes his finger halfway inside Sherlock, who gasps.
“It seemed only polite,” Sherlock mutters. He touches John’s arm hesitantly. “Back to Baker Street?”
John doesn’t know how he feels about this, really. It seems they were taking large steps in the right direction. They’re closer now than they’ve been in the six months since Sherlock’s return. And Sherlock may have been finding love in the oddest of places: a televised dating show. Closing this case might mean indefinitely stacking away an old file that Sherlock had been on the verge of opening. The cold case of his heart.
John huffs out a laugh. “No, you silly man.”
, John thinks.
The lady at the check-in desk smiles brightly at the two men. She’s in her mid thirties, impeccably dressed with a housewife hairdo, and with one more button unfastened on her blouse than Walt would approve of. Sherlock looks back at the doorman, who’s got his back to the actual entrance now and is watching them closely.
When the unknown shooter stops, and they hear the rather close sound of a gun reloading, John reaches into his Dalmatians rucksack. Sherlock stares at him in terror. They can’t die. This was supposed to be a fun trip. John fumbles in the rucksack.
“I’ll try to… dig a little deeper.”
The exact second the first pork and potato dish touches the table, John shoots upwards, straight as an arrow.
“You’ve been wearing those this whole time?”
John moves onto different parts of Sherlock’s body.
-Best Judy: best friend (it’s a Judy Garland thing)
“It’s art.”
. No, more than that. Sherlock has apparently decided to play another game with him.
“Nevermind the holes, does that smiley have any special meaning to you?” Bobby asks.
Then, his phone beeps again:
He’s following Sherlock down the aisle of their Eurostar carriage.
Except Jinkx’ new toyboy, apparently named Dimmock. She-lock rolls her eyes. Jinkx is probably already planning on sleeping with him. Or
Right, mustn’t get distracted from the case.
With his hand, meanwhile, Sherlock moves from John’s balls to further back, placing a wet finger against his entrance. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
“Oh. That's why you went to a murder dinner party.”
John swallows. Perhaps that’s it, isn’t it? It was Sherlock’s first and only experience with sex, so maybe he thinks it’s always like that. It’s not.
John’s mouth runs dry. He needs a glass of water. It’s just so hard to swallow.
“Right, I’m in,” Q says. His voice sounds strained, as if he’s actually exercising and not hacking into the Mickey wifi.
John groans. The man might not even wait for the rose ceremony to boot Sherlock off the show. Swank pot.
The detective reaches underneath the dashboard and extracts two packets.
“No you didn’t, you daft bastard.” John peers into the candles, breathing heavily. Then he looks up again. “Is Moriarty really dead?”
, for this show.
,” Sherlock says. “There’s a lot you don’t know about me. That you should know about me. You’ve barely scratched the surface.”
Sherlock growls. “Sebastian told me to come as myself. He still needed a detective character for his childish game, apparently.”
And if John Watson loves James Bond, Sherlock will get him what he loves.
But Lestrade and Dimmock can’t see her face. They can only hear what she says.
Great? Good? Kind?
“She’s too old to be a twink,” Dimmock says. “Nice dressing gown, by the way. Very #BedBathAndBeyoncé.”
“They’re not shaved.”
“Jinkx is my friend,” Alaska says, looking rather disappointed. “I want to destroy her dreams on my own merit.”
“I feel the same,” Jonathan winks at Sherlock from beside Mary.
John frowns. When did that happen? Must have been one of their secret, private conversations.
In front of her, John straightens his shoulders. She-lock follows his cues - their dance instructor has appeared.
She-lock reaches over to put John’s hair into shape. They’re both still wearing their drag outfits, but with their faces clear, there is nowhere to hide.
He can’t believe Mycroft made a deal with Eurostar to make the train do an emergency stop in the middle of a trip. He really is the most powerful man in Britain. ‘M’. John chuckles to himself.
John puts his hand over his mouth. Judging from the annoyed look on his face, Sherlock can hear him giggling into the microphone.
This isn’t a game anymore.
Mycroft pauses a minute, eyeing Jesus.
Suddenly, he catches someone’s glare, way back in the crowd. Mycroft.
Next chapter update: Monday!
Sherlock falters, as if he’s physically struck by so much stupidity. “Coincidence? That a spotlight nearly falls on top of Doctor Wilson? During
“I’m not a… huge fan,” the man says.
Sherlock’s face falls. “What?”
She-lock picks the fake eyelashes off John’s real ones - he didn’t need them, really. They are naturally stunning.
“I’m a patriot,” Sherlock says.
“This is… interesting,” Antoni says.
“I know you are grieving,” Sherlock says, desperate for words. “And I can’t say anything to make the pain less.”
A small pause. “Windows Vista update.”
Thank you guys so much for all your lovely reactions, subscriptions, kudos, etc. They mean the world to me, and keep me sane during this writing process. (Also: totally cool if you're just a silent reader. We're all balls of anxiety together here.)
“Our client this week is named John Watson,” Karamo reads off a tiny cue card. “John was nominated by his friend Molly. He’s 41 years old and has an 18 month old baby daughter Rosie. He currently lives in a tiny London apartment with his 37 year old friend Sherlock.”
As John lays on top of that wooden desk, exhausted, come dripping down his backside and a little over his entrance, there is one thing he knows for certain.
“Errr…” John starts, glancing at Irene, who’s near the X-ray lightbox now. She’s hanging something on top of it.
“Don’t worry, I’m an expert,” She-lock says in a - hopefully - reassuring tone. “I even have a blog about this. The Science of Untucking.”
The suitors go dancing. Coming home is harder.
“You honestly look so good,” Tan says.
-Shade: insults (as in, throwing shade, insulting)
Indeed.
Sam and Sandy continue. “We're the victim's parents, our names are just Mom and Dad.”
here,” she grins. “Though I don’t understand why. Your crime drag is ridiculous. You think you look like ‘killer clown’ John Wayne Gacy Jr but you really look like Bianca Del Rio.”
Then, John puts Sherlock’s thumb in his mouth, and immediately Sherlock’s entire face changes by dropping his bottom lip a tiny bit.
“My mother was
The title is a line from the musical Wicked. When Elphaba doesn't believe the love interest when he calls her beautiful - since she is green and all - he says, "It's not lying, it's looking at things another way". The first time I saw Wicked, that's one of the things that really made an impact on me. We all feel 'green' in a way, I suppose, we're all searching for someone to look past it. She says, nipping her scotch at the bar, holding her cigar, staring into the distance.
John clears his throat. “I'm here to speak to a ghost.”
“Make the move, Sherlock.”
“It used to be a
happen to me here?” John says. “Crushed by Dumbo the Flying Elephant? Too many spins on the Mad Tea Party carousel?”
Ru’s tone sounds rather regretful. She-lock is not surprised: as far as she knows, Latrice doesn’t know much about nursing. Except perhaps burn wounds.
“Jesus, Mary and a biscuit,” She-lock mumbles.
She-lock’s mouth runs dry. It doesn’t happen often that she’s lost for words.
“Michelle Visage has been known to… intimidate queens into leaving the competition.”
Lestrade looks at his knuckles. “Well. Even a detective must look for love sometimes.”
“I was just tired from work, those two times” John tries to defend himself. Seeing the look in Sholto’s eyes, he stammers. “Sir, yes sir.”
A little odd, that. Maybe it's just one of those groups of old college buddies who, once they meet up again, fall back into their old lame jokes and habits. John shrugs and slips the envelope back into his back pocket.
“I don’t cook, for example,” Sherlock says.
Well, fuck. And to think John hadn’t even reached the perineum yet.
“That’s right, I
John could easily walk away now. Leave Jonathan simmering in his anger, and take Sherlock home. But how could he be so selfish? Winning by tripping the competition is not winning. And Sherlock should get a shot at getting what he wants. And what he wants, is Jonathan.
John brushes his teeth, showers, puts on clothes, makes a little too much tea. As if he is performing in a play about his life, acting normal.
With his other hand, John moves his hand from his nipple to his own pants, slowly pushing them down, releasing his cock. Then, he pushes forward until their cocks touch.
“Leave me alone, Mycroft.”
“Who called it busted? Michelle Visage?”
The claw opens; Sherlock pistol-whips him with the distorted gun, and the attacker falls to the floor. Seemingly unconscious. John is in awe. This man, this fantastic actor, falling down with his fake claw. All because Sherlock wanted to surprise him. It fills his heart with sweet, sweet joy.
“For life,” Sherlock mutters.
John doesn’t think he should come in his friend’s mouth, really. That seems like a bad way to treat your best mate. It’s not proper.
After about fifteen minutes of Mateo monologue, they move on to Jinkx Monsoon, and her drag evil stepsister, Dimm-cock Monsoon. They look like 1940s black and white glamour shots.
-Drag ball: underground LGBT event, in which people "walk" (compete) for trophies, prizes, and glory. RuPaul has drag ball challenges in which the queens have to create multiple looks
“You know you should be looking at the other one,” Magnussen continues.
“Wait… Where do I sleep?”
“I’ve gotten my hands on footage of yesterday’s so called ‘dessert date’ between David and Jonathan,” Sherlock says, stepping over John’s bed in a frenzy. “They’ve been

“Oh, sorry, just some spilled tea.”
“In a good way, I mean. You’re surprisingly good at this deduction stuff. If you ever want to start on your own…” Lestrade teases.
of drag. Not that he has anything against… well. It’s all fine. It’s just not his cup of tea.
A small note. A few individuals said I should tag this dubcon. I (strongly) disagree that it is dubcon, but if you’re easily triggered, continue at your own discretion.
David smiles, nodding at Jonathan. “You should try it. The meat is very… tender.”
He goes to the penthouse, and to cheer Jonathan up, they order room service and press the beanie hipster to bring games. They play Operation, Cluedo and Monopoly all night.
The sight stuns John.
“You’re right. We should go to the Disney shop and buy fun tshirts.”
John’s anger subsides, but he knows it is just one wave retreating in the large ocean that he is. He sits back down opposite Sherlock.
-zap-
“So, Magnussen,” Sherlock says, clicking his tongue. “I’ve been reading your paper.”
“It was tasteless, to quote Michelle.”
John shakes his head open-mouthed. It makes Sherlock melt a little.
A perfect place for children.
“This is ridiculous.” John shakes his head, looking at Lestrade for backup. “Why wouldn't he suspect he's being investigated? Or that
Jonathan acts surprised, but soon falls into the rhythm. Sherlock, it turns out, is absolutely radiant on the dance floor. John’s breath hitches. Sherlock has control over his body and muscles in ways John hadn’t even imagined (well, especially after the erogenous zones class). Sherlock’s shirt hugs his sides as he lifts his arms, his trousers emphasise the endless length of his legs. He finds the beat, then seems to invent a new beat, and adapts flawlessly to the song playing - ‘Not on Drugs’ by Tove Lo.
“Just follow me, Honey Mahogany,” Dimmock says.
Jonathan backs away quickly.
Not just a doorman, perhaps.
Sherlock swirls his tongue around, touching every nerve ending separately, it seems.
More knocking. She-lock wishes it would go away. But John’s eyelashes are fluttering.
“The diva’s refusing to cooperate.”
. With little Donald Ducks on it, holding colorful numbers.
“Right. Stand still, please.”
John frowns. Is he trying to get Jonathan to choke faster? He doesn’t think Heimlich is on the menu, today.
Whoops. Saved the day.
“Do you think Bobby gave you open shelves? Wait, don’t speculate. Let him surprise you!”
“Like this?”, he asks.
“But you didn’t go through the whole audition process?” Stephen Bainbridge asks. He wipes his mouth with a napkin, covered in an ugly print of
“Yes, please.”
John startles. “You … need me?”
“Oi! I’m the victim here!” Lestrade retorts, grumpy.
John is… aroused?
“We even considered special wristbands with electronic currency in them,” Sherlock says into the cameras. “So people could buy souvenirs, holy wine, communion wafers …”
” Shangela says. “I was robbed!”
“You see, I’d gotten some blood spatters on you when I shot myself,” she says. “We think it was in the fake blood. Some kind of strange chemistry. Now we need to find a way to reverse it. And aren’t you a graduate chemist?”
A group of kids run past them, nearly knocking Sherlock over.
“It wouldn't be fair to the rest of us if you were able to actually investigate, Sherlock”, Victor says. Did he just... Did he just briefly put his hand on Sherlock's knee? John squares his shoulders. Somewhere in the back of his mind an alarm is going off.
He pulled off his dressing gown, but there was some resistance at his back, like the fabric had been sticking to something. John saw Sherlock wince at that, and John’s heart started galloping. Sherlock bit his lip and stifled a grunt of pain as he got all of the dressing gown off his body, and without a word, he turned around.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Like Mary,” John muttered.
Not long after that comment, Rosie started to fuss a little, so John sighed and said, “Well, I think it’s time for her to nap, so I’ll take her home.” He stood up, stretching.
“Not yet,” Sherlock said. “I had chips last night, but I ate them all. I didn’t have time to shop yesterday. Mrs. Hudson would have something.”
Sherlock wasn’t concerned. He wasn’t ticklish. John was just being ridiculous.
“Yeah, I know, I just found that out,” he said gruffly.
Why was she saying this to him?
John remembered when Sherlock told him the exact same thing at his wedding. His head was spinning. Last night, he told Sherlock he deserved romance to be happy, he responded by thanking John for his kindness, and now he said John kept him right? What the hell was going through Sherlock’s head? He was smiley all day and now this--and he was looking at John with--with
Mrs. Hudson gave him a sympathetic look. “He came back to you before.”
Sherlock’s lips compressed. There wasn’t a viable way around it, was there? He would have to shake away the lingering fear of his nightmare, and the memories from the night she shot him. John would be there. He could do it with John there. If they were careful, and if Sherlock got a better sense of how Mary really felt about the situation, then he could concoct a plan if need be. “Yes, bring your gun.”
Sherlock was letting out quiet, unsteady exhales, his breath hot on John’s face. “I can’t be happy without you,” he confessed as a response.
Sherlock’s mind said stubbornly as his heart panged. Their embrace felt like the beginning of the healing process. To Sherlock, there was no reason to dwell on it. (Right?) If John could see past how Sherlock was killing himself with drugs and knew it, then he could see past John losing his temper and snapping at him. It was a bad day for both of them. (Sherlock could picture Mycroft rolling his eyes at his justification.) But no. They could be better now. If they got through this, they would get through anything. They wouldn’t be completely better overnight, but these things took time. He had to give their relationship time to heal entirely. (He was incredibly impatient.)
“‘Too much’?” Sherlock asked.
“Yes?” he asked from his chair.
Sherlock looked stricken. “I…” he trailed off. He swallowed, his Adam’s apple bobbing visibly. Sometimes, when Sherlock allowed his walls to go down, the depth of emotion on his face was frighteningly raw. Sherlock only looked at him helplessly.
“You’re afraid she’s going to hurt us,” he said bluntly.
“I can ask the same thing,” John redirected the conversation. “How do
And on top of everything else, she acted so chummy with Sherlock, as if she didn’t try to murder him. Sherlock deserved better treatment than that. John inhaled sharply. He messed up again, didn’t he? He treated Sherlock badly not only by moving back in with Mary, and blaming him for her death, and taking out his self-loathing on him, but by being as hung up on her death as he was on harming Sherlock, putting those two things on the same level. They were not on the same level. After everything, John’s mind still valued Mary as much as Sherlock. Well, fuck that. Fuck that shit. He was done. He was fucking
“People are foolishly ambitious,” Sherlock muttered, getting his mind under control.
Sherlock sat down in one of the kitchen chairs, rubbing his eye tiredly. “Can you not?” he muttered. “You need to eat.”
“Sorry.”
John smiled back, and they shared the quiet moment, the soft afternoon sunlight highlighting Sherlock’s messy curls.
They slowly broke apart, foreheads touching. “I ought to smack Mycroft for the rubbish he told you,” John mumbled.
“No,” he said immediately.
That was where a couple things could happen. John could either be pleasantly surprised, accept Sherlock’s gestures, and reciprocate accordingly, or he could let Sherlock down and tell him that he wasn’t interested, that they’re just friends, he’s not gay, and he’s married. Sherlock was almost positive he would receive the latter response, but at least at that point, John wouldn’t be able to see he was incapable of being in a relationship. No matter what, though, Sherlock was going to tell John the truth about Mary once he put the pieces together. That was the other reason why he was doing this anonymously: he couldn’t let Mary know what he was doing. She was perceptive, though. She could figure it out before John did. She would absolutely want to know who was sending her husband flowers.
“The first one says, ‘I knew you were up to something, John!’ Then she tried to call me, and the next one says, ‘Fine. Don’t even bother coming home.’”
John swallowed hard. There was a deep, long-suppressed ache in his chest when he thought about what Sherlock really meant to him, but that was out of the question. Their friendship was barely afloat, and there was no way they would be anything more. Aside from everything else, John didn’t deserve Sherlock’s affection.
“Typical Sherlock,” John rolled his eyes. “I’ll text you later, okay? I’ll tell you then.”
“Okay,” he nodded, squeezing John’s hand. “I’ll tell you about it all one day, I promise.”
“Er, yeah,” John coughed lightly. “Everything’s organized. I didn’t touch your sock index, I promise.”
I had accidentally uploaded it TWICE. AO3 kept glitching out on me, and it wouldn't let me upload the story, and I kept pressing "post without preview" because it was late and I wanted to upload it so badly, but I guess it registered that I had uploaded it twice. Then, that created confusion, and some people weren't sure if they were reading the whole story, and so I deleted the version with fewer kudos and decided to write the porny epilogue, anyway.
Sherlock grinned. “Really?”
“Like I shouldn’t have done that.”
John’s hand tightened, gripping his knee. He was getting off-topic. “I don’t want to see Mary.”
“Good. You look happy.”
. So if you want a more in-depth story that deals with that situation, there you go lol.
John let go of him quickly. “Sherlock, what? Did I hurt you?”
“Make yourself at home,” Sherlock said. He didn’t want to appear aloof, but knew that if he started asking John questions right away, it would only make him angrier. He would wait until John spoke first. He turned a page and pretended to read, watching John from his peripheral vision.
“Are you really using such a juvenile term?” Sherlock asked, but he was already setting down his violin, an unmistakable flush creeping up on his cheeks.
He cupped his jaw and looked straight into his eyes. “I’m never going to hurt you again, okay? I want to make you happy,” his voice shook.
Sherlock was eerily quiet.
Sherlock looked perplexed. “Well, yes,” he said as if it were obvious.
Sherlock shrugged. “It’s true.”
“You didn’t have to throw it in the first place,” he teased, not even pretending to look at Sherlock’s face, his eyes roaming over the planes of his chest and his now-flaccid penis.
Sherlock chuckled a little. “I know.”
Sherlock chatted with Rosie for a bit about how she would need to develop at a faster rate than normal babies in order for her to become as smart as he was.
“Don’t care,” he spat.
“Well,” she put her hands on her hips, looking down at the table in thought. “I believe she worked for Jim starting about ten years ago. He praised her as one of his best men--or, women. She was a crack shot. Whenever he needed snipers, she was always there.”
“Yeah, ‘cause caring is such a bad thing,” John shook his head. He didn’t know what he expected from this talk, honestly. “He’s not over them, Mycroft. I think forcing himself to repress his feelings about it for thirty years had something to do with it, wouldn’t you say?” he asked with as much sarcasm as he could muster.
Sherlock had no idea he’d felt that way. “John, I would have never laughed at you,” he said, unable to keep the surprise out of his voice. Was he truly that cold years ago? Was John that insecure? Perhaps it was a combination of both. He tried to shut off his feelings so much back then, but he didn’t know he was hurting John in the process. He imagined John pining for him while he was more or less oblivious, sneering at love and emotionally manipulating people at the drop of a hat for the Work. Coldness seeped into his stomach.
He paused, stopping in front of the table by the window. What was he, crazy? That wasn’t enough to--what? To assume these were visions?
“Oh, dear, I’m sorry,” she smiled coyly. “I didn’t mean to interrupt anything.”
“Something private,” he said.
John rubbed his eyes. Different timeline, same old Mycroft.
Sherlock shook his head. “I’m awake now--”
“I get it,” John said. “I do.” He thought of what to tell Sherlock next. “Well, I had an odd one tonight. It’s odd because it’s the opposite of what’s happened in real life.”
John was on his stomach and sat up on his elbows. He cupped Sherlock’s bruised face gently, cautiously, and brought their lips together. Sherlock sobbed into his mouth, the warmth of John’s lips a better balm on his wounds than any medicine. He tossed the ice pack aside and it landed somewhere on the floor.
“Good. Good. Good.” John said multiple times without really realizing it.
John maneuvered the stroller around him, so he could see as well. There was the cerement bump in the pavement he had avoided with the stroller earlier. At a closer inspection John noticed that that section of pavement was darker than the rest around it, so it had been set fairly recently. Sherlock smiled. “Call Lestrade.” He said. “We’re setting up a crime scene."
Sherlock nodded. “I’ve got 50.”
John was late coming down to the kitchen the next morning, Rosie balanced on his hip. Mrs. Hudson had left tea and toast out, and despite it being cold John took some anyway. Sherlock was once again in the kitchen, preforming experiments.
Sherlock’s hands relaxed a bit, and John sighed. “Give us the reading, or whatever you call it then.” John said.
Sherlock realized what John was trying to explain. He hadn’t even thought that Ms. Hudson would be put back in danger. But it had happened so many times before, so why wouldn’t she now?
John looked at him. “What do you mean?”
The name of the child that wasn’t his. Then he scolded himself for thinking that. Rosie would always be his daughter. She had done nothing wrong in this world, and deserved a home, and a father. He realized he didn’t care who her biological father was, she was his to love.
A couple star starting popping up in the darker end of the sky.
Sherlock kicked his gun to the left of him, and John saw it sliding in his direction. He knew that if he moved fast enough, he could pick it up and fire it if he needed to. John looked at Moriarty to see if he would react to the new location of the gun, but Moriarty only lowered his gun arm. Now no one had guns on anyone.
Mary knew what was coming. She also knew that she was going to have to finally complete what she had tried to do months ago.
They did not have to wait much longer. The next afternoon Greg Lestrade walked in the door, breathing heavy. “You’re not going to believe this.” He said in his heavy accent.
In front of John was the devil, the hermit, the tower, the hanged man, and death.
“Well, you’ve got quite an array here.” She said after looking at all of them. “They would make for an interesting reading.”
“Who did you expect?” John asked, walking towards her.
John laughed a little, which was a relief to Sherlock.
Lestrade looked closely at the pearl. “We won’t know for sure until we give it the proper tests, but if I had to bet money on it, I would say it is. How did you do it, Sherlock?” Lestrade asked, peeling his eyes of the gem.
“Yes.” Sherlock said in a deep voice, which usually meant he was busy thinking.
“Whatever you said…” Mycroft said, and they both knew very well that he knew what Sherlock had said. “He doesn’t remember.”
“I will let you know at the end of the session.” She said, with a little smirk. With that she took the pages, and examined both sides of all of them.
“You said you had mics?” John asked.
Sherlock looked over the pictures again. “The mermaid and the birds are too random. There must be other meanings to them. Have you check to see if there’s any secret messages on them?” Sherlock asked.
“Sorry again!” John said. “Is Rosie asleep?”
“Thank you for everything.” John said.
John smiled. He wanted to take her in his arms, and never let go again, but as a doctor, understood that he really shouldn’t.
The time it took was agonizing. Sherlock had insisted on watching the whole thing, but eventually lost patience, and walked over to a bench where John was sat, the stroller with Rosie in it on the other side of him.
*****************
He carefully examined the water, the tiles, everything. Nothing seemed to suggest that Moriarty had been here recently. He found himself standing in the same spot he stood so many years ago, and imagined the scene in his head. He saw John, with the red scope dots all over him.
“Glg brx plvv ph? Hmh csy qmww qi? Eje zpv njtt nf? Fkf aqw okuu og? Glg brx plvv ph?” was just the first line of text, followed by several dozen more. Scrolling past the nonsense and into the comments, they didn’t recognize any names they knew. No comments from Mrs. Hudson, no comments from Molly Hooper. Not even any from the famous The Improbable One. Simply names without faces, all commented something that included a lot of question marks.
“I’m not sure.” Sherlock said, finally getting out more than a one word sentence.
And it had writing on it, and you looked at it, and said it was a women’s ‘obviously’.”
“Ms. Hudson again.” Sherlock responded.
Sherlock frowns. “But you’re a doctor.”
He swallows, and looks down at his fiddling hands.
What can I say? This fic started with a crazy idea and now it's over 50.000 words and I feel incredibly proud, and sad that it’s ending, and by the way, have I mentioned that 88thparallel is the best beta in the world?
Then today Mycroft had rang him.
“It’s John’s birthday. Next Sunday.”
“Of you enjoying yourself,” John says.
She-lock returns to her room. And she can’t help but feel a little sting when John doesn’t follow her.
“I... tripped,” he says.
It doesn’t matter, John tells himself. It’s better this way. He rubs his wet eyes, then looks one last time at Sherlock’s sleeping figure - almost fully dressed, cock hanging out, mouth open - before he gets dressed and crosses the balcony, back to his own room. He doesn’t fall asleep for a long time still. What a way. What a way to find out he’s in love with Sherlock Holmes.
Watson doesn’t move. He looks about as cocked as a gun.
for putting us on the case of Sherlock and John,” Karamo says.
“It just… spoke to me. This cab driver, Jeff Hope, managed to kill twelve people before Scotland Yard finally caught him.”
“His name?” Mycroft asks. He glances at the file in his hand. “Sebastian Moran.”
Stephen Bainbridge and Jonathan Smalls genuinely try their best during
“Mr Holmes is ready for you now,” the secretary says. She pushes a button and with a buzz, the door to his office opens.
. I’d advise you to stay away from her room. She’s a freak. Her
“John, you can stay,” Wilson says. “Please come collect your rose.”
“Ehm. You’re welcome?”
“What? No it’s not,” Sherlock laughs nervously. “It’s really not. Moriarty’s dead. I saw him shoot his own brains-”
“How are you feeling today, John?”, she asks.
It’s true - on last year’s Christmas photos, he’s noticed John apparently cut off a shape. He knows perfectly well who: Jeanette. The boring teacher.
“This is a student doctor, Sherlock,” Sherlock says for the umpteenth time that day. Playing doctor isn’t as fun as he thought it would be.
“You think this sex was about forgiveness?”
“Well, that was useless,” Sherlock pants.
He can almost hear Sherlock smiling. The man rubs his behind, like he’s discovered a new moon (about to plant his flag), then spreads his cheeks again and lowers his head. In a circular motion, Sherlock licks the area around John’s anus, tracing every ridge with his tongue point, stroking every inch.
Sherlock waves his hand. “No, no. He’s fine. All drugged up, so he’s more than happy.”
Pieces of drywall fall to the floor.
Though he has been thinking about it, of course. Since the zoo date with Molly and Karamo, he’s been thinking of little else, actually. If he’s honest with himself, he hasn’t even considered dating, because he’s perfectly happy with Sherlock. And the thought of being with anyone else - or Sherlock being with anyone else - makes his heart hurt.
“Thank you,” he says, and he licks his lips and winks.
On screen, Jonathan tenderly presses his lips against Sherlock’s, and for a moment, nothing happens. Jonathan’s oily body presses a little harder, a little more passionately, into Sherlock, and suddenly, Sherlock pushes him off. Hard. Against the massage table.
“Phi Phi O’Hara, your drag outfits belong on a season two runway,” She-lock says while theatrically lifting the reading glasses. Though he soon slides them back down for the next one, a tall, goofy ginger apparently named Jinkx Monsoon.
“I’m obsessed with Joan’s lesbian look,” Katya says. “It’s so Raven. Oh, and that violin part you did during your lip-sync and dance? Brilliant. You reminded me of Thorgy... before she was taken by the reptilian people.”
Damn you, Eric Clapton.
. I sure as hell am not wearing those anymore.”
“You're the blogger”, Penelope smiles. She has perfectly white teeth, but one is slightly crooked, John notices. He decides to stop staring at her mouth immediately, and nods.
Their rooms at the Landmark are not adjoined anymore. No more balcony hopping.
, John.”
The man himself, meanwhile, is not talking to him. After last night’s rose ceremony, Sherlock was obligated to do interviews, provide soundbites, engage in photoshoots. They kept the candidates awake for hours and hours, hoping they’d say something mean about the others (they’d have a harder time provoking a kind word from Sherlock). John didn’t stay for the circus, but retired early.
“I’m not here to judge,” Katya says.
Soon, they enter a tiny room. The walls are adorned with gold silk wallpaper, the floor is all red-patterned carpet, in the corner there’s an aquarium with a python inside, and in the middle there’s a single poker table.
John’s nostrils flare. “The
Sherlock strokes himself slowly, looking John up and down with pure, drunken lust. Sherlock puts the condom on, rubs it with more lube, and crouches over John. His Belstaff is still on, but there’s something erotic about that.
Irene licks her lips suggestively. John groans. Really. Not. Necessary.
John almost needs him to be dead because the lie would feel worse than death.
Enthusiastically, Sherlock pulls down John’s trousers and pants. He halts for a second at his feet, to remove John’s shoes, with hungry, impatient fingers. Then, he flops John onto his belly.
John can almost
“There is no case.” Sherlock slowly repeats.
Nothing.
When Sherlock returned after two years of undercover work, he’d been wounded. He had redirected every conversation John had tried to start about it. But he’d winced when they’d hugged, and John hadn’t tried after.
“I suppose it’s like masturbating, but from a different angle,” Sherlock concedes.
, it will only get worse. People will imagine it in every take, in every short scene where he glances at the man.
The Dwarves laugh loudly, their deep voices rumbling through the chamber. In the background, the dragon roars.
“Shut up and eat your ice lolly,” Sherlock says. “Doctor’s orders.”
Sherlock complies. Jonathan looks at him in surprise. A soft smile tugs at the corner of Jonathan’s mouth.
“You were wrong, you know,” John says, popping his trouser button.
“I’m… Watson John,” he manages to utter, awkwardly. He stares at Sherlock’s lean fingers fondling a cigarette between his lips. As if he’s done little else in his life than playing poker with London’s underground figures, Sherlock deftly deals the cards. John is in awe - he didn’t know Sherlock could play.
It looks different than he remembers. Worn out. Filthier. Threads sticking out. John tentatively pulls one. His breath hitches. It’s definitely not a vision. It’s real, Sherlock’s old coat is hanging right in front of him. He swallows. His throat protests. He swallows again, and again.

Slightly embarrassed.
John groans. It’s 2 o’clock in the
What other choice does he have, than to help his friend? He promised.
Dick tape?
“Well, Lestrade has been keeping an eye on them,” Sherlock says. “So: could be.”
“Yes... Indeed,” Sherlock says. “But we’ll find a way out of this, I promise you.”
be so good at chemistry, Sherlock supposes.
“The music is not for you!” Mycroft’s voice nearly rises too loud. Sherlock looks at the nave, where uncle Rudy is trying to catch a glimpse of what’s going on.
“Why did you come to my room?” she asks. “Because I was your
“This is actually… Quite scary,” John admits.
“Well. On a Eurostar train.”
John’s throat feels completely dry.
John leans even closer to Sherlock's face.
And immediately trips over his own long legs. Part of the vicar robes falls open, revealing the sparkly rainbow inside.
, he hears from inside the office close-by. Then, a scuffle. Someone hastily putting his phone on vibrate.
On stage, Sherlock shakes his head.
At the same time. It’s just logical, really. Time saving.
John wonders. He squints.
“Don’t call me love,” Vanjie says. “We’re not in a mothertucking fanfiction. Did you bring your post-its, bitch? That’s what I thought. I don’t need to be judged by you. Now, press those lips close like a toaster oven. I can see your cliffhangers from here.”
First, they tape an extra scene with Mary and all the remaining suitors, to fit the murder case into the narrative of the show. By the time it airs, the public will definitely have heard about it. So they need a smooth transition.
“I’m sure you’ve… experimented,” John says decidedly.
“John. As you know, my body is just transport to me. Nothing sentimental. Merely a device to get me from point A to point B.”
Sherlock reaches into John's opened trousers, and rubs across his cock.
Behind him, Antoni has gone straight for the kitchen. He pulls open the fridge door and screams.
Sherlock groans.
She-lock blinks. She can’t stay here. No.
“Time to head back to the stage,” PA Miley announces. “For the big finale. Category is: runway, not runaway. Katya, bring nicotine patches. She-lock, bring tears. Five minutes!”
“You have an international reputation,” Sherlock says.
She nearly can’t keep up, but she
Jonathan smiles, but before he can make a joke, Sherlock picks up speed. Like a deduction, but about himself, and in all the wrong ways.
It is the heaviest thing in the room.
It was a job for him. He was probably there to question her, to search her belongings. How could she have been so naive?
John exhales slowly, and scratches the back of his head. “I suppose… David Beckham is quite stylish.”
“Right…” Their elbows hook together now as they dance-walk to the side. “Who’s your favourite judge?”
John eyes the recording Bible. “You’re eh… hoping this All Stars season will restore your reputation?”
“Sherlock, I don’t care,” Jonathan interrupts. “Everyone has done things they regret. The point is in trying to be better. Even if it’s with ups and downs. And if we do start something together after this show, away from the cameras and escaped zoo animals… I would like the problems of your future to be my privilege.”
“John, I -”
Then, Sherlock crouches over him, close to his ear.
, John. He can’t hear you in here, and neither can his secretary,” Sherlock says. "And we’re already at our seats anyway."
It still remembers Sherlock’s strong shoulders.
To make matters worse, John’s body starts having a - well, what else could it be called? A sympathy boner.
“Mycroft surely has-”
“Whaaaaat?” Alaska exclaims from the back.
As he pinches Sherlock’s nipple, he moves his head upwards. There’s near terror on Sherlock’s face as John gets near it, but then he takes a left turn to his earlobe. He kisses it softly, then takes it into his mouth.
. Meaningless.
“From the crotch down, you’re a star. But you should’ve bought a better breast plate…. BenDeLa!” She-lock says.
“O.M.G. So exciting,” Jonathan says, plunging on the sofa with a drink. “Will they or won’t they?”
“See, Sherlock,” John says. “Your body
John steps a little closer to the wall. In a large frame, Bobby has grouped photos John didn’t even know he had: Sherlock hugging Rosie closely, Rosie having fallen asleep on John’s chest, and even Sherlock and John talking to each other in the lab. Suddenly it dawns on John: Molly must have provided all these pictures. He swallows, something stuck in his throat.
She-lock looks up. “I’m not here to make friends.”
She-lock slowly lifts her hand to her bra, feeling the keys resting there. John lets go of her shoulder, and stares in front of him now, bracing as if for battle.
An elderly gentleman with round glasses joins them and shakes Mycroft’s hand.
“You’re already cute as a gay button,” Jonathan continues, unperturbed by the terror in John’s eyes. “You’re giving me serious daddy vibes. I like your swoop. So here’s what I want for you: trim the sides, curve the top, and make it a bit more military. Do you think Sherlock will like that?”
After Janine yells cut, Mary waits for John to stand apart from the other suitors until she approaches him, like a bloodhound sniffing out prey.
“Good.” Moriarty said, a smile slipping across his face. “Now kick it so you can’t reach it and I’ll put mine down.”
But what was on his mind now more than ever, was that “Mary” or Rosamunde, her actual name, had been working for Moriarty the whole time. He had not been told by anyone, but had come to the conclusion that Moriarty had sent her to him. Now, John was questioning if Mary had ever loved him at all. And if he truly ever loved her.
One of them was for a bag of oysters, another for a brand-less perfume, a jellyfish stuffed animal, red lipstick, and colored eye contacts. After thinking about it, he decided that the oysters and the jellyfish would be connected, and the perfume, lipstick and contacts would also have something to do with each other.
“Of course it doesn’t” Sherlock said as he moved more into the light, examining the parcel. With careful fingers he reached in, and pulled a stack of papers. Some of them had different styles of bar-codes; others had drawings that looked to be from children’s books. The first of these was of a knight with curly brown hair going in to attack a red dragon. The next drawing showed the dragon transforming into the devil, and in the next, the devil was holding the knight, poised to sallow him.
Christmas Day - Mr and Mrs Holmes' Cottage in the country
“Not particularly,” John replied, “Just the usual life changing things,  the washing, cleaning, shopping kind of stuff that doesn’t get done by the fairies despite what some people who live here might think.”
He was cold, he knew he must try to stay awake.
“Sounds a bit drastic, mate.”
“Blimey Greg”, John spluttered on his drink. “No need to be quite so defensive. I’m your mate, you don’t need to justify yourself to me, not least about this.”
“And yet you have come to me?”
DI Martin agreed to John’s suggestion, wished them well then went back to his regular job of policing, securing the scene and arranging for the removal of Richard’s body.
******
On arrival in his mind palace Sherlock takes a cursory glance towards the throne room, as he feared, his older brother, who has been delightfully absent much of the past year, is back in residence.
By the time he reaches Northumberland Street where another clue’s pinned to the door it’s gone seven.
Sherlock took the dish and asked, “Did I get anything wrong?”
Good evening Sir, how can I help you?”
“What?”
There must have been something, a subconscious deduction that had prompted the thought of Afghanistan, but what it had been still eluded him.
and then
“Not a mistake I will make again.” Mycroft said firmly, shades of his old self returning, “the game is not worth the candle.”
And in that quiet and darkening room, as the earth stood still; spring had come at last, after a long and bitter winter.
“What?”
“Have you seen him?” Sherlock was in no mood for games, which was unfortunate as Mycroft was determined to play.
“Oh, you’ve lost your tinsel” The receptionist exclaims at the lack of festive cheer in John’s office and pointing in dismay at his naked monitor, “Never mind, I’ve plenty behind the desk in reception. I’ll sort it out later.” John doesn’t respond but inwardly dreads to think what his room will look like in the morning.
John can hang on; the water is up to his chin but no longer rising. He’s cold, his neck is killing him, but the sound of his friend’s voice and the knowledge that rescue is on its way helps. The resilience of the human spirit – remarkable.
“When did it rain here last?”
It was late when Sherlock returned to Baker Street, so late that it could almost be called early. The flat was in darkness, Sherlock had messaged John to tell him not to wait up, having no idea how long he would be.
“What reasons?”
They spoke in chorus.
John laughed, knowing that Sherlock was just as curious to find out more about Greg’s engagement as he was.
******
“Of course,” Sherlock replied but he didn’t meet John’s eyes.
It was frustratingly slow progress, and there was something he was sure he was missing but he couldn’t put his finger on it. It was almost a relief when his phone rang.
“Aren’t there any biscuits?”
Alone with the soldier, Sherlock assessed the situation, and concluded that the anger that had been demonstrated before had dissipated into curiosity. That he could handle. He invited the man to take a seat before sitting again himself.
This… the endless daily grind of work, and commuting and child care and the terrifying knowledge that you are all this little person has got.
Unfortunately for Lestrade, he was spending most of his time outside.
Poor motherless babe, so easy to look after; no doubt that would change once the terrible twos set in. Still, she has plenty of experience of dealing with tantrums and it is wonderful to have her boys under her roof again.
John nodded, and together they slipped unnoticed out of the front door. It was cold, and still raining hard but fortunately their wait was a brief one, as Steve appear from around the corner of the building driving a smart Range Rover, the twin of the one that was already parked outside.
Sherlock had no hesitations. “Yes John, as I indicated in my text. Keep up!”
Sherlock turned away from the tracks and began the climb to the mouth of the nearest cave. Steve and Danny followed him, Sherlock questioning Steve along the way.
“I’m afraid taking the law into your own hands might well backfire. Is it impossible for you and your husband to get away for a few days?”
“What time do finish weaving your tangled web around the unsuspecting folk of Wilvercombe?”
“No,” Sherlock quickly replied, “I just meant I haven’t seen him for a couple of years; he used to hide these from me,” Sherlock indicated the cigarette.
Aveling was standing close behind him, “can I help you at all, are you looking for anything in particular?”
“I’m nineteen years old, Dr Watson, I have my whole life ahead of me… and besides, I have known Paul since I was a baby, he’s like a brother to me, and besides although my father liked Paul, he was dead set against anything more than friendship between us, and told me so, often.”
EDDIE/?RE?ARE/?O/MEE?/YO?R/GOD
“Yes,” Sherlock interrupted him, “I haven’t deleted Lincoln. I think you may be right.” He pointed to the laptop, “See if you can find anyone by the name Abraham or Abe Garvey, living in the state of Arkansas.”
“You are aware, Dr Huxtable, that the persons who are holding Lord Saltire have expressly prohibited any outside interference. His Grace is particularly anxious to obey them to the letter. The fact that so many people from the school have been alerted to Lord Saltire’s disappearance is unfortunate, but regarding the ransom only you, I and the Duchess have been taken into his confidence and you did not have permission to disclose it to anyone else.”
“Will he come back?”
was only a short walk away.
Sherlock felt a twinge of guilt, what did it cost him to humour a friend, and a locked room murder would be nice. He gave the mixture a half-hearted stir.
“Not acting alone, I believe there was a someone else involved.”
“Now? Now you listen to me?” Gerard says incredulously “That’s a first”
“As my best man. Sherlock Holmes can hardly get married without John Watson at his side.”
“I think not, Mrs Holmes,” John said, and produced his gun from the waistband of his trousers.
Sherlock shuffles up and Mycroft sits; they smoke their cigarettes in companionable silence.
Crowley agreed that this was perverse behaviour;
“Is she dead?”
“Oh no Sir, change is annoyingly difficult, the public and the tourism board don’t like it.”
“Forgive my early intrusion, Mr. Holmes, but I have come in person in order to insure that you would return to Mackleton with me by the next train. I feared that no telephone call or email would convince you of the absolute urgency of the case."
Mycroft blushed to the roots.
“I understand, go on.”
“Reasonable enough, the way Mary Sutherland described her Aunt implied they were close and she even lived with her during the week once she started working for Mrs Etherege. I got the impression that the Aunt had no children or even close relatives after Mary’s father died.”
There, under the infra-red lamp, he was able to decipher the remaining few words on the charred remnant.
They left the warmth of the gamekeeper’s cottage and walked down the lane to the place where André Cloete had died. As Sherlock had feared, there was little left to be discovered from the site, what hadn’t already been destroyed by the heavy-footed constabulary had been obliterated by the snow.
Sherlock forbore from enlightening John further on which of Eddie’s wares he had sampled.
There was a brief silence before Sherlock, eager to retain the upper hand replied.
“Do you think she knows?”
Sherlock was startled, from the moment he had met the Duke and his assistant the day before he had ceased to worry about Arthur Saltire, to the extent that he had almost forgotten that the boy was missing presumed kidnapped. He tried to school his face, but his bewilderment must have shown as John turned his head in disgust.
There was something about the client that made Sherlock think they had met before, or perhaps it was merely that the man reminded him of John. Sherlock put the man’s age as late thirties, possibly slightly older, expensively but not ostentatiously dressed, someone who liked the finer things in life and was able to afford them.
The soldier got cross again, “I thought you offered to help me, not blind me with science.”
Sherlock extrapolated the relevant information from the detritus of ballgowns and birthdays that littered Debbie’s account.
Sherlock turned to the uniformed officer and asked, “Who phoned it in?”
, they had both wept buckets but denied it afterwards), Sherlock had confessed that he had studied ballet for several years in his mother’s attempts to help him channel his energies and command his thoughts. Aziraphale was delighted but then shocked when he discovered that Sherlock had never learned the gavotte.
“I assure you, Mr Holmes, it is a case of the utmost importance,” here the man lowered his voice to barely above a whisper, “it concerns His Grace, the Duke of Holderness.”
“I’m sorry, Sir, we’re closing.”
Mummy was the first to react, gathering her first born into her arms she pulled his head down to whisper in his ear “about bloody time too”. While Sherlock looked thunderous and muttered "So that's how he knew it wasn't a politician" to anyone who would listen.
Sherlock did not like John’s flat, it had far too many unhappy associations. This was John’s matrimonial home, a place where Sherlock had scarcely visited and for a while had been specifically prohibited. The last time he had crossed the threshold it had been in response to a summons from John to watch the final message from Mary where she had once again attempted to pull their strings from beyond the grave. Sherlock had found it sinister, but had said nothing, as he had the impression that John had found it comforting.
John shrugged, he didn’t seem disposed to argue, he merely inclined his head towards the baby monitor. “It’s two way.”
“The gardener and his lad, plus some of the domestic staff who were not on duty searched the grounds to no avail; it was then reported to me that the science master was also missing. I knew at once that was no co-incidence and that I could no longer delay in informing His Grace of his son’s disappearance. My worst fears were realised, he had already received the demand.”
Sherlock shuddered dramatically but Lestrade pressed on. “But it couldn’t have all been bad, there must have been some good things, you in your reindeer antlers, Mycroft playing Santa Claus.”
“I’ll pick you up at eight then,” John responded with a smile, “don’t be late. You still owe me an explanation”
Sherlock took a deep breath. “You don’t trust easily but once you do you are unfailingly loyal; you are fundamentally traditionalist but have a rebellious streak that will occasionally come out to play. You played rugby at school and university and turn out for a senior side when duties permit, although you worry more now about getting hurt. You drink coffee when out and about but at home you prefer tea.  You are not particularly close to your family and have at least one family member who has or has had an issue with alcohol, your father or a sibling or possibly both. Your own vice is gambling to the extent you don’t trust yourself even at the penny arcade. You have a girlfriend called Lucy, but you are not sure if it serious or not. Is that enough to be going on with?”
******
However this morning Sherlock had other things on his mind. The truth was that he hadn’t seen that much of Mycroft since the events of Sherringford. Ironically for someone who had dedicated much of his adult life to avoiding his older brother it now appeared that Mycroft was avoiding him.
Musgrave Hall, by the well.
“You are sure about this, aren’t you Greg, you haven’t known Dinah very long to be making this kind of commitment.”
The club, when they finally reached it, was in John’s opinion, a right dump. The entrance tucked away underneath the railway arches in an alley that ran alongside the canal (not exactly Canal Street). The scrawny ginger haired bouncer didn’t look as if he would offer much resistance should John decide he was getting in without paying, or much use if there was any ‘trouble’.
“After Daddy died, Mother took over the business with Mr Windibank, who was one of Daddy’s buyers, but I don’t think they ran it very well. Mother said that I would have to find myself a job and Aunty put me in touch with her neighbour, Hermione Etherege the novelist…” Here Mary paused, “surely you have heard of her?” She went on, gawping in wonder at their blank faces. “The author of ‘
On starting to play the Shostakovich again, Sherlock had recalled that he had learnt the piece before; at the age of about eight or nine he had been chosen to play it in his school concert. The other violinist had been a boy in the year above him although not as tall as Sherlock, a competent player and they had matched each other well. As they had been thrown together for rehearsals Sherlock had begun to tentatively wonder if he might achieve that elusive status of a friend. Then, just before the concert started, the boy
The truth is Dinah, and I are getting married. Tomorrow.”
“He never turned up, no-one like that there. I went straight from work, arrived about five thirty, the museum was closing, so I walked round the outside then stood at the main door by the columns until gone seven, just in case, you know what the traffic is like on a Friday night.”
John is not convinced. He’s been clubbing with Harry before, and while he’s not adverse to a few drinks on his last night of freedom he knows what he’s in for if he says yes.
It was John’s turn to be silent and thoughtful.
“His right sleeve,” John repeated in disbelief. “No chance of room service then?”
He made himself a camomile tea to go to bed with and took a last look round the sitting room. He’d heard Mrs Hudson come in a while ago and knew that all was well there. He noticed that at some point Sherlock had removed his socks and shoes. Looking at those long bony feet always did something that made John’s insides go soft.  He swiftly pulled the throw off the back of the couch and placed it over them, Sherlock didn’t move a muscle.
“Who knows what went through his mind in those seconds before he fired the gun. But all I can tell you is that the love his life was dead and he wanted to die too.”
Mycroft’s plan is unsuccessful; he is almost relieved, though slightly hurt, when Sherlock tells John to ignore him.
“Fat Eddie?”
“Heard us talking about you? How are you feeling?”
Evenings like these are so very few and far between John reflected as he settled in his chair, a cup of tea by his side and the remote in his hand. Rosie had gone down easily, worn out by her day at nursery. Mrs Hudson was at her book club; Sherlock was off on a case with Hopkins hours ago and John had Baker Street to himself.
Or as we know it in England,
“If I may furnish you with a little background to this desperate situation. My name is Dr Thorneycroft Huxtable and I am the headmaster of a boys’ preparatory school in Derbyshire.  I am the fourth generation of my family to head the school which was founded over a hundred years ago by my great-grandfather.
Sherlock was horrified “John, I told you I am not clairvoyant, I don’t see anything that isn’t there.”
Helen and Jules provide a sympathetic ear, they know Clara of old and appreciate Harry’s dilemma. It is not so easy to be in a relationship with a paragon.
“I know,” John’s heart is heavy, “I know the Museum closes at five thirty.”
When he tuned back in Sherlock and Mary were still talking weddings.
Aveling pushed open the door to allow Sherlock to enter first and he found himself standing in a comfortable sitting room that doubled as a study. There were two upholstered armchairs, not unlike John’s chair at Baker Street, either side of the fireplace, and a table and chairs and a large bookcase. On the desk there was a newspaper open at a half completed sudoku and a chewed biro, next to a new laptop stood a stack of exercise books and science worksheets.  The four doors off this room revealed a bathroom, a kitchen, a cupboard and the bedroom. It was this room that Sherlock turned to first, although larger than John’s room at Baker Street and differently laid out there was something quintessentially John about the room. It was neat and tidy as he might have expected, but there was a spy novel open face down on the bedside table, next to glass of water. The bed was unmade, as if someone had just got up out of it, but the bottom sheet was neatly tucked in with ‘hospital corners’ just as it always had been.
“Harry…!”
Molly and her current beau were the next to arrive, Sherlock learnt his name and promptly deleted it, Molly took Simon over to meet Mrs Hudson. Stella Hopkins, Mr Hopkins (who it turned out wasn’t a Hopkins at all but instead called Paul Rowland) and Sally Donovan were the next to arrive. John always had mixed feelings regarding Sally due to her long history of animosity towards Sherlock but had to admit she had been better since his return and was prepared to be generous as it was Christmas.
“How did you know about the raid?” John asks after their order has been taken.
Three months, six days, John consults his watch, and fifteen hours (possibly he still hasn’t got his head around the time zones), God willing, he’ll be walking up the steps of the British Museum.
"Could be shortened, Ed, or Eddie."
Gorgeous.
Sherlock smiled “Not good?”
Trust Mycroft not to spare any expense, Sherlock thinks, slumping into the seat of the executive jet; nothing but the best for the departure of the nearly departed.
Everyone agrees that Sherlock is remarkably good with Rosie, but then he’s been looking after her since she was a few weeks old.
John was so disconcerted by Sherlock’s remarks that he could think of nothing to say for the rest of their journey home.
******
Reassured, John stood carefully and stretched his legs, he thought he was getting better at this, standing in the dark. He caught a few drops of water in his hand to drink and took another mint, his last but one, his stomach rumbled but his mouth felt better for it. He was ready to press on.
“I have told you this, so you are fully cognisant with what has occurred and how bitterly I regret my part in it. You will have learned, I am sure, that I wrote to Arthur the day before he disappeared. Well, James opened the letter and inserted a note asking Arthur to meet him at the school gates. He used the Duchess's name, and in that way got the boy to come.
“I just wanted to say a few words, to thank you for making me so welcome in your circle. You will all know that the last few years have not been easy for me, I have played out my personal life on a very public stage, so it means a great deal to me that Gregory and I have friends around us that we can trust. I know that my detractors will say that it is too soon, but just because of three tragic marriages should I spend the rest of my life alone?”
“We know Sir,” Marcus replied, “but short of getting the Enterprise here with her teleporter there’s not much we can do about it. “
“There’s plenty of entrances to the caves but this is the nearest, so it makes sense to start here, though we won’t be exploring far without equipment.” Steve said, pre-empting Sherlock’s next question. “Grab the torches Danny-boy.”
“I see you have uncovered the skeleton in the family cupboard. Well, it has not been much of a secret for many years, anyone who lived or worked on the estate or in the local area will know that James Wilder is my late brother’s son by Joanna Wilder. There is no scandal or mystery about it, although my mother and father never knew the truth.
“I said I don’t agree with it, but if there is one thing that twenty years as a nurse and twelve as a priest have taught me it is that, to quote Hamlet, there are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”
The woman relaxed a little, “We’re not supposed to talk about the boy’s disappearance, we’ve been told it’s instant dismissal but if it helps you find that nice Dr Watson then I can’t see any harm in it. You’d best have a chat with Debbie” she pointed to red-headed woman (
Steve shrugged, “I know what you are getting at, but you are wrong to suspect any of them. Roy, the gamekeeper I have known all my life, he grew up on the estate, same as I did, and his father worked for the family same as mine did. Pete, that’s Roy’s second in command, he’s a village boy, family farmed round here for generations. Mr Rogers the land agent, he’s been here since the old duke’s time, must be twenty years.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John having an insomniac spell, in the kitchen at 3 A.M. waiting for the kettle to boil hears Sherlock cry out, and then again. Immediately alert he realises it is not a soldier Sherlock requires, nor a doctor, but a friend.
“What do you think he meant by that?” Aziraphale asked.
Arranging to meet at the property, Sherlock questions the rent but Mrs Hudson is adamant.
“I’m not getting into an argument with you about Santa’s nefarious purposes, now will you listen”
Greg looked round too, and in doing so, missed both Amy’s conspiratorial wink at Sally, and seeing Sally’s smile in return, eyes mischievously twinkling.
Sherlock made up his mind, he would speak to John; encourage him in his romantic endeavours. Even Mycroft could be made to assist, he was bound to have something on the poet laureate that could be used to induce him to write a poem that would bring John’s courtship to its proper conclusion.
“No, not at the moment.”
“We kept it hidden, it just wasn’t done in our town, but we had each other. Did folk guess? I couldn’t tell you. As it happens we didn’t see that much of each other, different colleges. I was busy with the church, Eddie with his writing. But then suddenly we were thirty and all the guys we knew at school were getting married and having kids, and I thought if folk aren’t talking they will be before long. Eddie was teaching at the local junior school, and I’d been called to an associate pastorship at my dad’s church and I just knew that people would sure enough start asking why the two of us were still on our own. Then Eddie got a book deal, and he started to get dissatisfied, he wanted to go off and see the world and he wanted me to go with him, but I couldn’t could I cause then folk would really have talked.
It was true that he was a little eccentric in his mode of dress, but he had found a style in the mid-eighteen hundreds that he thought rather suited him and had stuck with it. He was a little on the plump side, that he would admit, but he had long ago discovered that you always received better service in restaurants if you gave the chef the impression you will actually enjoy the food they serve you.
The moment Sherlock heard the front door close behind John, he got up from the couch and fired up his laptop; he then spent a frustrating couple of hours researching the remarkably elusive Mr Ralph Fell. It wasn’t that there was no information, rather the reverse, there was heaps of it, covering more decades, events and places than were feasibly possible for one individual to have gathered by his age. What was more, there was something about every entry Sherlock read that jarred and left him with the impression that it might have been ‘cut and pasted’ from someone else’s Wikipedia page. Curiouser and curiouser.
“I thought you might have recognised the celebrant. Personally, I still think he is yet to surpass his Lady Bracknell.”
Crowley avoided headquarters a much as possible, its associations were far from happy ones, even for a demon, but needs must, and he was cautiously optimistic that at this time on a Monday night he might slip past reception without too much difficulty.
Crowder was polite and answered Sherlock’s questions almost verbatim to the evidence he had given the police; his daughter Patience confirmed that she had seen Paul arguing with his father as she walked through the woods. Her brother, Robbie, had been some way behind her on the walk from the school bus, having called in at the village shop before heading home but he confirmed that he had heard André Cloete greet his son although he hadn’t seen him.
“Yes… badly changed.”
******
Sherlock, appraised John quickly and deduced that he genuinely didn’t know the outcome of the interview. However, the detective had no doubts and said so, where else would the hospital find such a suitable candidate, a former army surgeon with battlefield experience?
He hazarded a guess at west and started walking in that direction. As he rounded the point, he saw to his amazement just below him a pickup truck, which was surely an indication that there were people about. John lurched forward, stumbling over rocks and sliding on the wet grass, as he made his weary way towards the vehicle as quickly as he could, his head throbbing and every muscle in his exhausted body aching, yet fear that it might drive off before he reached it gave him the momentum to carry on.
******
“Possibly, but that still doesn’t explain how she got there, nothing on the CCTV and the lock was completely rusted up, the hotel maintenance had to force the door with a jemmy.”
“You still haven’t explained about Afghanistan.”
“Of course it was fine, in the end it was barely a three”
Sherlock’s narrative was interrupted by the need to change trains at Worcester. The rain had turned to sleet, and it was cold and miserable. John went into the station café and bought them both tea while Sherlock huddled in the waiting room. Fortunately, it was not a long wait and they were soon on the local train to Great Malvern. This was crowded and Sherlock, who was never at his best on public transport drew into his coat as if to protect himself from the onslaught of sensations from being surrounded by so many people.
“I’m sorry to call you so early but here’s been another incident Mr Holmes; a message was left under a pebble upon the sun-dial, I found it yesterday morning. I’ve emailed the photograph to you but you’ll see the characters are exactly the same as the last one.”
“Long life and happiness!”
“Do we really have to do this again?” He whines as they pose in the stunning Physick garden. (The answer’s ‘Yes’)
Perhaps it was time to seal the deal, jump the gun, make sure of him, after all she wasn’t getting any younger. She could easily accidentally on purpose forget her cap wasn’t in place the next time she got John in the right mood. Because Mary Morstan was not about to forfeit John Watson. He was her insurance policy, even more so since Sherlock Holmes had come back from the dead. Marriage to John Watson would protect her, Sherlock would see to that, and Mycroft would end up protecting all three of them.
They don’t stop running until they reach the main street, brightly lit and busy with bars still open although it’s after one. They collapse against a wall, breathless and giddy.
Sherlock’s hands are in prayer pose, his answer a long time coming.
“I might have said the same of you.” Mycroft replied, his tone sharp.
John looked up confused. “It looks as if this letter from Ian Moody aka Mr Nobody was written on Mary’s own typewriter.”
“Hang on, you sound like this isn’t the first time. Is that where you were all weekend, with Dinah Shepherd?”
“Merry Christmas, Dr Watson,” Sherlock replied, “Merry Christmas!”
“Not ideal.”
“Not out loud, silly boy. Now another one.”
Sherlock was about to protest when his tummy gave a loud rumble.
“That was Mycroft?”
“You old romantic!”
“Now me. John held out his hand palm up,“you owe me a reading, like you did for Bill and Chris. What you should have told me before you got derailed by Afghanistan.”
John agreed but noted that Sherlock had sidestepped his question.
“I am sorry to inform you that you are going to die.”
John let the silence carry them for a while, sipping his disgusting coffee, when he did speak it was quiet and measured, like he was holding himself under great strain, “Of course you don’t understand, how could you? The one thing that everyone has said consistently about Richard and Patrick is how much they loved each other. The police, the Kings, even you said it, affectionate, devoted, happy. Yes I did see the photographs in the kitchen, and their wedding portrait in the hall, and the love they had for each other was unmistakable. That kind of love doesn’t come along very often; I think Patrick didn’t want to have to live without it.
“No, Lord Arthur became the duke when his brother died, but then he died too, a couple of years later. It was a shock, because he was only just over seventy, but folk round here said he never got over the death of Master Alex. That had happened a few months before.”
Aziraphale called tails, he lost.
The uniformed officer replied “Yes, no exit wound, they’ll operate to remove it when they consider him stable enough for the procedure, if he makes it that is. But there are still four cartridges in the revolver. Two have been ﬁred and two wounds inﬂicted, so that’s both bullets accounted for.”
Immediately after Musgrave Hall - Molly Hooper's flat.
“Much as usual then.”
“Can you tell us what happened?”
Mycroft replied instantly. “No, my dear, not at all, it is merely… you will recall last Saturday morning, a certain text message.”
“Do you know what a bucket list is? It is named after ‘kick the bucket’. Humans make them, they are a list of all the things a person wants to do before they die.”
This train of thought was disrupted by the vibration of his phone, it was quarter past three already. Picking up the hoodie for Rosie, Sherlock scrunched up the paper and lobbed it into the bin. There was something definitely worrying his flatmate, Sherlock concluded as he left the room, John should never have missed such an easy shot.
He’s beginning to feel it, lightheaded, heart racing, a tremor in his left hand. The substance, blended by the surprisingly able Wiggins to Sherlock’s own specification is taking effect. He’s no wish to take his chances with the Serbians. If death is on the table he might as well make it Item One on the Agenda.
“That is where you are wrong,” Sherlock stood up and addressed the Duke, “Alexander and Joanna were married at the time of James’s birth, I have had this information from a most reliable source, and what is more I believe that James is aware of the marriage too. He may not have known it for long, but I am certain he knows it now and because of this he is a very real danger to your son Arthur.”
“No?”
Sherlock, whose Russian was fluent, bent and whispered in John’s ear. “Let’s wait in the porch, it would not be wise to be seen to overhear that call, even if it is in a foreign language.”
“Your hobby, seeing that it generates no income”
Emelia Ricoletti. He can see her clearly; her blonde curls framed by her wedding veil. Sherlock shakes his head, the earth tilts,
Sherlock knelt by the man’s side, felt for his pulse which was faint but steady, then loosened his tie and collar, the man seemed to be breathing normally. Sherlock cast an appraising eye over his visitor, the two-day stubble on his chin, the dirt on his collar and cuffs, and a train ticket poking out of the breast pocket of his jacket. Sherlock, extracted it, noted the details of the journey and replaced it, just as the man’s eyelids began to quiver, and a pair of vacant blue eyes looked up at him. An instant later the man was trying to scramble to his feet, his face still grey with exhaustion. Sherlock gently restrained him and offered him a cushion for his head.
“I know” John beams “Completely brilliant!”
Sherlock looked round uncertainly but John’s eyes were shining in the firelight as he nodded his reassurance. His face was beaming with pride in Sherlock’s success, just like the old days… before. So much so that Sherlock was very nearly overcome with the emotion of it. He felt his face go hot with embarrassment, and he took a large gulp of his drink. Seeing that he had everyone’s attention Sherlock began.
“He panicked and left Cloete and went back to the Hall where the stroke hit him. He knew that Cloete was dead but had no idea that Paul was in Boscombe or that he had been arrested for murder until I told him this afternoon. He immediately confessed everything. The rest you know.”
