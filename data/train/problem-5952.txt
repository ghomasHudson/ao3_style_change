Peter coughed awkwardly, “hi me again, right here still, didn’t move, wasn’t involved in the hug. But could I get like a glass of juice or something?” Peter stood like a bit of an idiot at the corner of the hallway, “Of course Peter here,” Tony opened fridge grabbing the carton of apple juice, Steve grabbed a glass from the shelf above Tony at the same time, Steve noted that it was the same juice as his favourite brand, he silently hoped there was still some left for him once Peter had some, It had been so long since a glass of juice or even water was guaranteed for him. Peter thanked them and sat down on the couch but before he could say anymore, someone knocked on the flat door.
Peter moved to stand beside the piano, watching the interaction between his Dad and his Grandfather, “Do me a favour, Tony, try not to burn the house down before, Monday.” Tony held his hands out to gesture towards the door, “Ok, so its Monday, good to know, I will plan my toga party with Peter accordingly. Barbados, correct?” Tony moved to stand behind his mother, shoulder to shoulder with Peter.
and I've change Steve to the nickname '
Usually if they fell asleep, it was on the couch watching movies and that one-time Steve accidently broke the heating in the apartment. Steve would bundle Tony up in his arms, he’d use Tony’s lack of body heat as an ice pack for himself, but he couldn’t help but notice how… comfortable Tony got, they both slept peacefully which was rare for both of them. Before he was shipped out, before he had to tell Tony he was shipping out. He’d make excuses just to see him, even Tony noticed his behaviour, but he was a good friend and never said anything.
“You are beyond happy, sickly sweet in fact, no threats of divorce or unhappiness with this family!” Peter reshuffled himself on the chair, “I’m assuming your date went well then?” Tony stayed silent, staring off into the distance. Peter rolled his eyes at his dramatic father. He could see Tony’s eyes wander around the room, settling on Peter’s watch. That had reminded to check the time, to make sure he wasn’t holding Tony back from any of his classes. Tony’s face had settled into a frown, eyes locked on to the watch, Peter waved his arm to try and break Tony out of his stare.
The walls were an odd colour, the wood too dark, not enough expose to sunlight yet, his rocking chair was in too good of a condition to be considered his, the book shelf was half empty rather than overflowing, the record player missing their Stark Industries upgraded speakers, everything was just slightly wrong. It was just a little unsettling for Steve. It was the same for Peter, his son seemed, so far, alright but the whistling technique had clearly been a little too well used for Steve’s liking. He promised himself to find out what had happened and to not allow Peter to go through that again.
The hairs on the back of his neck began to tingle, his hearing zeroed in on the noise, approaching faster and faster, small…like … A
His Dad was definitely worse than his Pops, he didn’t have super solider serum to keep him healthy, his eyes lacking their usual spark, his suit jacket crumpled on the floor in the background, his shirt completely gone for one of his Pop’s sports shirts. A zipper on his shoulders, his skin generally paler than usual, his parents looked worse than the time his Dad locked himself in the workshop for 6 days straight, Pops wouldn’t even let Peter see his Dad because he thought it would scare him.
had any common sense this place was now a bad memory for Peter. His tightened his grip around Peter’s shoulder, Peter had fallen asleep pretty quickly once they’d hit the road, and that left him alone with his thoughts, or a single one to be specific, Bucky was alive. His best friend was alive, and likely still alive in his time, a new mission that he was going to have to pass by Tony.
The compound was a shining beacon in the distance, and bright enough for
He pulled off his helmet, dropping it to the ground. Gently placing the shield down next to it. He took in a large breath. Clint had already started, starting with the papers already on the floor. Quickly shuffling through the sheets in his hand, Clint turned to Steve, “He definitely went through these, they are all about Stark properties around the world.” Clint let out a whistle, “Stark has private island
, “I didn't know." He said, "I didn’t know…”
The doors bing open and Tony leads the way. Taking one of the bottles of chilled water from the receptions basket, he sauntered down the hall, holding the doors open to her office open for her to catch up. She caught up, thanking him quietly as she entered. Tony shut the door behind himself, spotting a couch, he threw himself onto it as he prepared to sit and wait for
Peter woke up first, he lifted his head off of his make shift pillow. His mouth was bone dry having slept his mouth wide open. He surveyed the room around him, Rhodey was passed out on the couch with a monopoly piece sitting on his forehead, Tony was asleep on the floor, piles of monopoly money stacked around him, he pulled himself up on to his knees and stood up. Pizza boxes surrounded the floor as well as random blankets, drinks and snacks. A loud knock of the door woke Tony from his deep sleep. He quickly got up, patting Peter silently on the shoulder, he kicked the bottom of Rhodey’s foot to wake him up.
The shooting stopped. The sounds of sirens echoed in the distance. Steve’s head lulled. He knew he was going to pass out soon if he didn’t stop the bleeding. He opened one of the pouches on the back of the belt, pulling out a handkerchief and pulling it round to his wound. He crumpled the handkerchief into his hand and shoved it roughly into the wound. He let out an involuntary hiss at the pain. Natasha rolled her eyes towards Steve “God, you’re actually a grandpa, handkerchief to complete it.”
Peggy sighed on the other end of the phone. “Anthony please don’t talk like that, look if you are lonely and are determined to hide out at home… I could get Cadet Rhodes to visit, bring you some of the class lectures- “He cut her off again, “I don’t need to distract Rhodes, he’s off to training camp after we graduate, leave him, I’m fine at home.” Tony could hear movement, on the other end of the phone, he ran his hands through his hair again, “I could get Steve to visit.” Peggy’s voice was quiet, “No.” Tony stopped moving, he hadn’t seen Steve for months. He’d thought about him, what Steve would say to him, he didn’t really want to hear it, Steve promised him he would find this guy but then Howard killed his own family. Steve wasn’t going to help with anything.
Tony was alive. His future was sitting down stairs. He hadn’t met
“Ok, just make sure you give it a clean in the morning to be sure no dirt heals in with it overnight, do you have any questions Captain?” Steve shook his head. Natasha tilted her head in a questioning look. “Doctor, can I ask, is the serum likely to pass down genetically?” Steve opened his eyes and looked over to Natasha, what was she up to? The doctor was caught off guard by the question and her face showed it. “That’s a very … personal question to ask on behalf of the captain.” She looked over her shoulder to the Captain, who just shrugged back at her. He wasn’t in the mood to try and be polite.
“To keep me and everyone else safe, blah, blah, blah, whatever helps you sleep at night ‘Captain.’ I’ve heard all of this before, instead I’ve got my best friend spying on me when I’m not even allowed to know where in the world, he his or if he’s coming back home to the shared apartment, we rent even though he’s not been here for 5 months!”  Tony took a large swig of his coffee.
Steve made his way down the hall, avoiding the broken floorboards, noting to himself that he really should get them fixed soon, before he forgets. He opened the bedroom door, to a casual ‘Hey’ to Tony, when he finally raised his head to make eye contact with Tony, he found Tony asleep, lying across the bed in his turquoise boxers, jeans half way up his legs, he likely fell asleep getting ready. Steve noticed the scraps of paper and pen in Tony’s hand, another break through hastily noted down before tiredness over took Tony.
Steve turned to look out the window on to the main complex structure. “A government’s scientific laboratory is no safe place for a kid to be hanging around.” Peter harrumphed in disagreement, “I’m part of the team, I’m one of the people who creates the danger.” Tony smirked at Peter’s response, impressed by it. “When your parents get back and we explain the situation to them, I’ll be having words about irresponsibility for their attitude to your safety.”
Steve jumped a little at the slam of the cabin’s door, but quickly forgot about it as his son sprinted towards him, Steve dropped the shield on the dirt floor of the clearing, he picked up the pace to meet his son in the middle, colliding with Peter the pair collapsed into a heap on the forest floor. Steve running his hands over his sons face, not quite believing that he finally had his son back in his arms. Steve was laughing hysterically, over joyed that Peter was finally back in his arms. Peter chest felt like it was going to exploded with how hard he was breathing, he gripped onto his Pop’s forearm, not quite believe that he’d come for him, that for the first time in months he was going home, that his Pops was here. Steve rested his chin on top of Peter’s head, cradling the boy in his lap, arms holding the back of his head into his chest as the other gripped tightly onto the back of his son’s shirt.
Steve’s face remained neutral. He took two steps back and marched through to his bedroom. He heard Clint sigh but he couldn’t face it. Steve shut the door quickly behind himself and sat on the corner of his bed. He leaned back far enough to fall onto his side of the bed. Staring up at the ceiling. He let the tears slip quietly down his cheeks. Steve and Tony Stark? Steve and Tony Rogers? Peter James Stark. Steve, Tony and Peter Stark. A very broken family right now. Steve pulled himself up and off of the bed. He couldn’t save them but he could try and save Natasha.
Peter curling his fist with a quiet yesss to himself, Steve chuckled as he motioned for Tony to join him on the 7 seater corner couch which was slightly sunken into the ground to create a more open space or at least, that is how to the design team sold the idea to Tony. Tony reached for the plate of the now peanut buttered toast, he picked it up, ate a bite as he walked over and sat down on Steve’s other side. Peter motioned for the toast, “HEY that’s my breakfast!” as Steve let out a monotone repeat of “Language, please Tony.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Yeah, Promise.”
“Yes Jarvis, I have eaten this week… I know its early but I did sleep. Don’t worry I have a friend around…he’s very interesting… I don’t care what Roger’s thinks at the moment, he doesn’t care about me or our friendship.” Tony had a smirk on his face while talking to Jarvis, playing with the cord of the phone. Peter never knew the man version of Jarvis but his Dad spoke well of him, said he practically raised him. “Oh, we were just up having a catch up, weren’t we Peter?” Peter eyes shot up to Tony who had a devious smirk on his face, “Tell him what you want Jarvis, he isn’t speaking to me and I don’t want him here. So you can tell ‘Captain Rogers’ to go fuck himself!.. sorry Jarvis, speak to you later.” Tony slowly placed the phone back on the stand on the wall.
Peter…Stark, wrapped in his chest, a poor kid clutching a glove and a wrench in one hand, he guessed symbols of his parents. The Wrench is Tony’s, besides the obvious engraving on the handle of, ‘Tony S. R’s stuff don’t touch,’ It could only be his, Steve’s birthday present to Tony last year was a full workshop set, the metal shelves painted custom hot rod red. The wrench in Peter’s hand was the same brand. Peter’s eyes were closed, his head leaning into Steve’s chest, his arms and legs curled up so that he was wholly in Steve’s arms and held him to his body.
“The one to create all this, then I am ecstatic that it’s me but also, you … you speak so well of me and your other dad whoever they may be. Enough for me to believe that we raise you, together.” Tony coughed awkwardly, “That we are a family and you look up to future me and your other dad, I don’t have that with Howard or my mom, I have a butler, who has taken on my trouble maker attitude to do far more than he should ever do…”Tony stood up and walked over to the window, looking over the dark campus of M.I.T. Peter wanted to interrupt him, but he knew his dad had more to say, he always does.
drawer on the wooden chest of drawers and selected the first pair of PJs that he could grab. Throwing his clothes over the already full hamper, Peter pulled on his PJs and dived into bed. Wrapped in the red and blue tartan throw Peter drifted off into his dreams.
“Are you going to answer it?” Natasha watched Steve closely. Steve turned to look at the device, “No. He’s at home with his family, he knows he shouldn’t be calling me anyway.” Natasha frowned at Steve, she watched the conflict show on his face. She quickly realised he wanted to answer, “Why not?”
a forgotten memory,
“I want to work on the apartment. I want to be at home, with you, maybe go back to art school.. again. I can’t do this for them, not anymore, I have a life outside of Shield and I’m going to miss it if I keep risking my life on a lie.” Tony just watched Steve’s face as he spoke, he waited for the joke, but Steve was truly leaving Shield. Steve turned to face Tony, a hand resting just above Tony’s hip, the other reaching up to take the letter from Tony’s grip.
Tony and Steve slid down the faded grey cabinets to the floor. Tony holding Steve’s upper body against his chest as they heard Peter dive out the window when a piece of glass hit the floor. Tony shifted himself up to reach for a kitchen tea towel, so he could apply pressure to Steve’s arm. Steve set in motion a plan to try and get up, “Steve What are you doing?!” Tony called out, trying to pull Steve back down to a sitting position.
Like right now, Peter wanted breakfast as today was his first day back at school after 3 days off and all he wanted was damn peanut butter spread and toast. Instead, he wandering blearily and unsuspectingly into the glossy white marble kitchen, dropping his backpack on the island counter with a purposeful thud to inform his parents once again that they in fact do share this kitchen with other human beings. Tony was sat perched on the edge of the island, legs apart, so that Steve could stand between them, holding Tony’s face gently in his hand, kissing his husband with a lazy passion that only years together could grant them.
Edwin Jarvis, stood tall and proud in front of the grand front doors, the sunlight of the frosty day shining down on to him. Tony let out a sigh of relief. The car came to a stop, shutting of the engine Robert proceeded to get out so that he could open the doors for the boys. Before Robert managed to open his own door, Tony scrambled for the door handle, almost tripping out of the car and running up the couple of steps up to Jarvis, grabbing the well-kept man into a crushing hug. Jarvis equally returned the hug, keeping Tony’s head and hair under his chin.
Jarvis dropped to his knees, surrounding Tony in his arms. Ana knelt in front of him, trying to stop the tears falling from his face, as hers poured out from her own eyes. Peter watched his Dad’s life just crumbled in front of him. Tony stopped crying, he stood up and turned to Peter. Ana tried to get him to sit down, “LEAVE ME ALONE.” Ana took a step back in shock, she nodded, he needed to process this, so did she, so did Jarvis. Tony pointed towards the door for the pair.
“We are going home, Petey, we are going home to Dad and this man is never going to bother you again.”
Steve rubbed his hand up and down Peter’s back slowly, creating circles with his thumb. The motion reminded him of the late nights when Peter was an extremely small child but gosh darn did he have a set of lungs on him. He’d cry all night if he could!
Yeah!
Steve hesitated for a moment before offering to Natasha, “you know if this does go well and you want company on house arrest you are more than welcome to help me?” She terrifies him, but that might just give him enough to stay away from Tony until he graduates, just until he finds someone else to live with, Tony will be offered some crazy job, he shouldn’t be stuck to just New York because of him.
Peter turned around and downed his painkillers and quickly checked up on his Dad, peaking his head through the door Peter watched his Dad arms wrapped around Steve’s hoodie, using it as a pillow, his hair pointing in every direction, he looked relaxed. Peter then went to his room and put on some of the PJs that Tony gave him yesterday. By the time he had walked back out in the kitchen Steve had dropped his Shield duffle bag and an obvious round carry case for the shield itself. Steve once again did a double take for how similar Peter looked to Tony. The floppy hair, the oversized clothing, Steve just couldn’t help but stare at the similarities. Peter could tell Steve wasn’t quite at the level of suspicion, but he could tell something was definitely up.
Steve stopped just outside the ruined door, he placed his hands on either side of his hips, lips pulled into a side smirk, Peter huffed awkwardly, letting out a stuttered laugh, “Oops?” he said shrugging his shoulders, giving his best innocent smile, Steve laughs, taking his hand from his hips to Peter’s shoulder, “Peter for weeks I was pulling doors off their hinges, it's no big deal, the wall however, thats going to need some work.” Peter relaxed his head down on to his Pop’s hand.
“ok my turn, What’s up with this flat, not to be like rude or ungrateful but this doesn’t scream, Stark Industries wealth?...” Peter ran a finger along the window sill, a small layer of dust coming with him.
“Kid I’ve tried to fix this heating system for months now be my guest to try and fix it.” His reluctant attitude bleeding through with just a dash of not giving a shit. Tony passed by Peter’s shoulder and whispered, “Challenge accepted.” Peter snorted at Tony’s dorkiness. All the boxes were dropped in the rooms across the flat, after the last one was placed Tony finally took a tour around. He took in the kitchen living room that was slightly bigger than his last flat, but he had double doors opening on to a small balcony looking out over the West campus. The bedrooms were at exact opposite ends of this room. Small hallways lead to bedrooms with en suites and office rooms that were just slightly smaller than Tony’s last office, but the bedroom was bigger, so it was a trade-off he was willing to pay.
Howard slapped his hand down on Steve’s shoulder, Peggy looked enraged. She wanted to slap Howard for insulting her, her godson and her oldest friend. Tony’s eyes closed, taking slow breathes. He shouldn’t be here, he thought, he needed to get away from here. Peter quietly wrapped his arm around Tony, using his thumb to pat his back to let him know he was here for him.
Ana was going wild on Tony. Trying to control each hair on his head, which fought back every time she moved it, he reached up to gently grab her wrist giving an innocent smile, “you can cut it tomorrow, it will be fine for today Ana. I look fine.” He lowed their arms down, she pats on his shoulders, giving a gentle squeeze. “Do not worry little one, they will be here today and gone tomorrow, then Christmas day and you won’t have to see him for another year.” Tony stood tall, his eyes focusing on hers, “You’re right. It’s just tonight, then they’re off again.”
. “You. You just blow my mind Tony. You look incredible, especially for a dad, not that you’re looking old just, I’m … Your
Peter dropped the money onto the counter, gesturing with his head to the receptionist, who responded with a ‘gruff’, he reached over to the lock box and drop the keys onto the counter. “Room 202.” Peter nodded. He shuffled his backpack higher up on to his shoulder as he made his way outside into the rain. Keeping his head down until in the room. Quickly unlocking, opening, entering and closing the door. He pulled the curtains shut and searched the room. He removed his soaking hoodie and jacket first. Hanging them over the cheap white radiator. He rubbed his hands together before twisting his web shooter and firing a shot at the door lock. Satisfied with his work he took them off and sat them down on the bedside table.
blood family… and you thought it would be best to keep that from me!?” Pierce looked… uninterested at Steve’s outbursts. “Yes, I heard of your unfortunate news. The lost of the Stark family is a true tragedy. And young Anthony, I heard you two were… close. Shame, he was a smart kid.” Pierce sneered and let a little of his disgust show through at the mention of their relationship.
And Tony, would probably have thought that Bucky hated him through protective glares and unfriendly dead pan jokes. Maybe they would have gotten along just for him. He could at least believe it could happen that way. That Peter would grow up with a father and an uncle who cared about each other. Here Steve found himself once again, alone and a friend down and unable to explain his emotions to anyone. He was getting exhausted and he really just wish he could have looked forward to having his own Peter. But his real world just wasn’t that fair or kind to him, he was out of time. Again.
But he needed a way out and fast. He need to warn Natasha, If she knows something about Peter, then she is in danger. They aren’t going to offer her a choice as to to whether or not to use this memory wipe. Who wouldn’t want one of the best spies in the business under their control.
“You know they say sarcasm is a measure for potential. If that’s true, you’ll be a great man one day.” He looked over to his wife, “I just need to check on one thing, just to make sure its in the trunk.” Howard left once again through the front door. Maria placed her hands on her lap once she finished her song. She took a breath as she lowered the cover down over the key, “He does miss you Tony, when you’re not here.” Howard walked back in jacket in tow. Maria made her way over to Peter, his eyes wide, his heart rate picking up. She used her fingers in a come here motion for a hug, pulling him gently in. “It was very nice to meet you Peter, I hope Tony brings you round again sometime.”  Peter nodded into her shoulder, “The pleasure is all mine, Mrs Stark.” Howard and Tony snorted in the background. Maria whipped her head round to effectively shut the two men up. Howard coughed into his fist.
Steve couldn’t imagined that he was still Captain America with a family and a kid to raise, then again, Peter had know the shield with a strong familiarity that Steve hadn’t seen from anyone else. Maybe it was a relic of his time at Shield? Either way the fact of the matter was, he wasn’t going to get that life anymore. He had fucked up and there was no going back into the ice to fix it this time. Howard was dead, his best friend dead and his future son, dead before he even knew him. He needed to go back to church, he wanted a confessional for his sins to bad his punishment had been served earlier. He shook his head of his thoughts when he heard a faint tapping coming through the pipes.
“Loud and clear Shell-head, what’s happening on your end?” Steve’s voice responded from the device. His tone tired and soft as if he hadn’t spoken all afternoon.
Natasha began to gather things from around her, her jacket, a couple of pens and paper from Tony’s desk. She sighed, trying to not sound as agitated and tense as she had been this morning. “He’s not strategizing, he’s not planning, we would plan a raid for the early hours of the morning, we’d go to sleep, wake up and Steve would be walking in the door covered in blood and bullet wounds saying it’s time to ‘get up and move on.’ He’s reckless and he’s going to get himself killed. He needs to come home to something Tony.” She took him into a surprise hug. He gripped the back of her maroon leather jacket in his fists, closing his eyes and letting out a stream of air from his nose. She pulled back, “I need to go, I’ll be ‘landing’ soon. Find him Tony, I don’t know where the two idiots are but please for your own sake, find them, I’ll find Peter, deal?” She looked out beyond Tony as headlights flashed through the curtains. “I have to go, take care of yourself Tony, no more drinking, it makes your hand writing terrible.” Tony whipped his head round to his desk, taking a look at his top note pad, his writing was worse than a doctor’s prescription. He turned back around to find no one.
Steve had no idea a kid’s imagination could be that vivid, but the kid needed sleep, so he just encouraged and repeated the mantra, “Its ok, kiddo, there’s nothing to worry about, get back to sleep.” Peter eyes began to lull again, “yeah, I will Pops, I’m glad I’m home again, I’ll see you in the morning for a run, I need a long one.” Steve ruffled the kid’s hair as he slowly fell back into his dreams, “Sure thing kiddo. Just get me up if you need anything.” Steve used his hand on his knee to help him get up. Tip toeing out of the room, Steve gently shut the door behind him and made his way to the other bedroom.
Steve had to play up the acting, he needed to give himself enough time to get to Clint and then leave this place. Just enough to give them a head start against the Shield agents. Guess it's time for retirement or would it be dis-honourable discharge?
of December 1991 – 2pm
Tony waved his hand off as he barely acknowledged Clint’s request. He lifted the gauntlet to inspect the shiny emerald metal that surrounded a molten black wiring throughout the gauntlet which produced its own light. “Petey want to come help me inspect this down in the workshop? I think I’m going to need your brain on this one.” Steve turned immediately turned towards the kitchen, “I’ll get the lunches!” Thor laughed and bid them farewell with promises of asking Heimdall for any information on the gauntlet.
“So then why is time sped up for me?” Thor voice peaked slightly, “Ah young Peter, these creatures are of Asgard’s realm. They have a very short life span from birth to death, It seems the gauntlet advances time quickly to save the life of the creature, so that they can actually live long enough to make a change in history.” Peter just sat staring at his Uncle with an unimpressed look. “So, time is moving quicker for me because an alien race, dies young, so to actually live a longer life, it can speed up time. Or at least my perception of time?”
think he heard the door open and close, but not his door. Some time passed.
Tony: And you to me, too.
"I think so," Steve laughed. "At least, I don't have a better explanation." He felt instantly guilty, because the sweater had been a present. "I think it's nice, though," he added. And he did, he really did. He supposed it might be considered a form of naive art.
"And I plan to give you back the real thing too," he added, because he'd thought it was self-evident, but then he thought maybe it wasn't to Steve. "It's always been your anyway." Like Tony should have been, perhaps. In a different universe. But, no. Maybe they had to go through everything in order to lend here, together. That's what Tony  chooses to think.
?" His voice vibrated with urgency.
still love the other Tony too, and I don't think that's really going to change, but... but whether you are him or not, I know
"No, don't."
"You'll have to very explicitly kick me out of here if that's what you want," I said as steadily as I could manage. "Otherwise I'm not going anywhere."
Tony: did you think about how much you were going to miss me while your tiny disbalanced friend tried to crush me by piling literal TONS of cars on top of me
"It's safest to assume so."
"Yes. Bed."
I shrugged. "I still keep thinking about it."
a fan of the fresh air, incidentally" Captain said deadpan, fixing those eyes on Tony, unblinking.
"I..." Tony began again, his words becoming as hesitant as Steve's had been. "I've come to realize something. Between the moment you broke into that cell and now. I... I love you. Too." He sounded unusually calm. "I think I have loved you... for a long time as well. I don't think I saw it, back then. Not in that way. But, if I hadn't loved you, it wouldn't have hurt as much. All that happened, I mean. So, there you go," he finished on an almost defiant note. "I love you too. What do we do with this mess now?"
Next message from Tony was another animal video, not even a funny one, just a cute basset hound with sad, sad eyes turning its ass to a kids' birthday party behind him, putting his head down on his front paws and staring at the wall in utter resignation.
A couple of weeks in, I'd also started feeling increasingly useless, and restless, so I kept talking about finding a job until Tony snapped,
Tony: That, on the other hand, IS the point.
Still mostly expressionless, Captain nodded curtly and muttered, "As you were."
"In counseling. He's not doing so bad."
Had the gravity been stronger, Louis would have been crushed by the contents of a storage room that good spilled into the corridor. As it was, he just looked dazed. It seemed he got hit in the head. There was a faint trickle of blood on his temple, down his cheek, but at the first glance he didn't seem to have any serious injuries.
"I can multitask, for fuck's sake" Tony snapped, then took an audible breath. "Sorry, Cap. Listen, I'll work better if I have an idea what's going on over there." Steve couldn't quite figure out how the man could produce so many words a minute, but he did sound a little distraught.
Patiently, as if beating himself over the head with a tiny hammer, Tony made himself remember the painful awkwardness when they met earlier tonight, remember the way Steve avoided him, the way he abruptly started pretending he was talking to Sharon when he spotted Tony coming over. The way he – cold, irritated, exasperated – snapped at Tony when Tony refused to take a hint like any normal person would. The way it was nearly always Tony who initiated contact (
Tony: I heard about Madripoor.
, it felt shamefully good to be fussed over, Tony thought. Just for a second, just for a little bit. Steve's cool fingers on his hot skin were pure bliss, and to be touched with such care, after what seemed like such a long time... He felt his gut tighten into a thousand fluttery little knots. His eyes went a little wide in the dark (he was thankful Steve couldn't see them). He had to put a stop to this before he did or said something stupid, out of pure loneliness. Steve was just kind, he told himself. And then, mercilessly: he'd be this kind to
"Be silent," Tony tells him sharply instead, "when I want your opinion, I'll ask." Because it's all about the game, the performance, the attitude, and the other man is responding so nicely to verbal domination play. Steve inhales sharply and bites his lower lip. Gives Tony an incredibly hot look. His eyes are big, blown wide; impossibly pretty. (Tony would kiss both his eyelids. If he were allowed to.)
Tony: I don't feel like apologizing for the other night.
"Yes, yes," Steve cut him off, blushing. "He mentioned something. I think it's probably an Asgardian term."
An intrusive idea that felt a bit foreign to Tony. Had he ever considered them that?
Tony: You had fun last night, right?
They both knew how to put on the fake, interested and corporate glam smile, Tony knew it well. Maybe he should get to know him, see if there is something behind the name. Tony shook himself out of his chain of thought. Back to the moment, sitting in front of Peter James Stark. Possibly Peter James Stark- Hammer? Ew. No… but … maybe? Focus! Tony thought to himself.
“I was thinking lunch on me?” Peter opened up his bag to show Tony he had food, Tony had led the pair upstairs to the workshop that held DUM_EE, The robot whirled in delight to see Tony and Peter. Tony kicked over a rolling chair towards the metal bench and dragged a stool over by hand. Peter set out the two rolls and the salad before sitting down. Tony sat down with a heavy thud on the stool, his arms going limp by his side, he gave a mock groan at the sight off food. “Peter, I have no idea how you get up at 6am for work, Rhodey dragged me out at 10:45 this morning and I’m exhausted!” Peter chuckled at the thought, “Well, only two more days till we head to the Stark Mansion for Christmas anyway, you can sleep then!” Tony hummed in agreement, spurring his body on to grab his roll.
“Home Tomorrow.” Tony confirmed, as the family shuffled one last time to settle in for the night,
Barton scoffed loudly, “That dude, ran over 7 rooftops in under 3 minutes, 80 he’s like an athletic 20-year-old. So, did the kid and even he was exhausted and he’s no couch potato. How did the meeting even go with Director Carter and kid, find out who he is yet?” Barton took another bite of his burger. Steve sat up in his chair, “Yeah, kids under Shield protection till he can get home, cousin of Stark’s.” Romanoff’s eyebrow twitched into a frown. “Right, anyway he’s been spotted in D.C so we are going to go stealth, see if we can find his target first. If not, someone will die, and we will lose this trail again for years.”
Ana, sat him down, kneeling slightly down to get a look at Tony’s face, she let out a slight tut. “Come on Édesem, let’s get you out of that jumper.” She reached over to grab the bottom of the hoodie that Tony was wearing, pulling the MIT Hoodie over his head, Tony raised his arms slightly to help her. Jarvis walked the short distance to the table, placing three portions of stew on each place mat. He made sure to give Tony extra mash potatoes and vegetables. Tony sat looking up at Ana as she chucked the hoodie into the washing room. Tony waited until Ana and Jarvis sat down, either side of him, she smiled at him and nodded for him to start eating. He took it slow, judging it bite by bite as to how much he could eat.
“Ok. I won’t tell him but… uh, my Steve, I mean! Steve from just now is on his way to the cabin just now. They’re on the run just now. So how am I explaining this?” Natasha coughed to cover up her mistake, she can’t ever be seen to be going soft. Imagine she actually believed what this Steve was implying, that she… of all people… had a family.
The Winter Soldier stood up, with a crack in his lens of his mask, his orders were unreadable. The flickering screen irritated him. He grabbed at the full face plate, ripping it off of the straps and threw it to the ground. Looking up at his target he scowled at the two twins in the way.
The group had made their way out to the trail access road. Walking in a row, they kept a steady pace. The spring sun high in the sky but the cool forest breeze kept them going. Natasha stopped abruptly, too quickly that Peter walked into her. She whispered, “Steve?” He stopped, looking off down the road, squinting his eyes to focus. They shot out as a pick up truck barrelled over the edge of the hill. Steve immediately dropped the bag to ground, pulling the shield off his back he moved to stand in front of Peter. Natasha prepared herself, fists at the ready.
Tony finally read the opening line. A letter of resignation.

“Open the door Rogers, I want to see my godson.” Peter raised his head quickly at the sound of his aunt Peggy. A wide smile broke out on Tony’s face as he ducked under Steve’s arm and ran to the door, stopping just before the door to swing it wide open.
Tony held the office door open for the pair to exit. As Steve nodded as he passed by Tony, he was caught off guard for a moment when Tony walked quickly to keep up with his steps and took his hand once again, giving him a gentle squeeze.
Thank you all for your continued support on this story and hope you enjoy this chapter, hoping to have the next one up soon! x
“Floor it. We aren’t far!
It couldn’t be, Peter thought to himself, It was him thought, the man from his
Steve noticed once again that Peter had been true to his word, he knew this compound like the back of his hand, he was leading him back to the main entrance without even realising it, “So, this,” Steve gestured with both hands above his head at the wide expanse of an open area they were walking through, “is home to you? Bit. cold is it not?” Peter looked around at the area, “yeah, just now this is the boxing area for training, down the hall has... will have the back hallway to my uncle’s lab.”
Peter has always been aware that when his Pops returns from a mission, five things are certain to take place; one - the whole family will gather for dinner, or as uncle Thor puts it, “a hero’s feast.”  Two, that his Pops will not let him or his Dad out of his sights for any great length of time, which was fine in Peter’s book, he wanted to make sure his Pop knew he missed him too when he was away, also … that meant a couple of days off school, win-win really. Three, if either one of his parents were injured then at least one argument broke out. The worse the injury was, the more arguments took place, it was guaranteed. Peter had correlated the data into an exponential graph when he was 14, after a particularly bad broken collar bone led to a record breaking 13 arguments about who was going to take the responsibility or ‘self-blame’ for the injury. The graph has come in handy for consultation from time to time (it’s still accurate to this day). Four, his Dad would always read a book to his Pops while he was recovering in bed. Peter had originally guessed it was part mother hen on his Dad’s side, not wanting to let Steve sit bored or risk reading with a broken hand after that one time, Peter now guesses it just something they’ve always done just one of those weird things that parents just do. And five, his parents will be disgustingly lovely dovey with each other. He has a bingo card with his Uncle Clint, betting on which lines of sickening lovey nonsense his parents will spew to each other. Whether it’s slow dancing to their first dance song or quoting random lines from those really old movies that his parents used to watch together, one thing is for certain, they become unbearable and that quoting their vows is worth double points.
Tony double tapped his finger near the end of his cigar, the ash glided down into the clear crystal ash tray, taking another swig of his whisky, rolling the ice cubes around in the glass. He let out an angry gruff as he inspected his blue-prints once again. Gripping the stalk of his desk lamp he pulled it closer to the design. Flipping the pencil between his fingers, he erased and re-drew a wiring component. A knock at the door drew his attention from his work. He raised his eyes briefly before returning to the design, “Come in.” Ana pushed open the door and stepped inside the room, using her back to hold it open for Jarvis. Jarvis carried through a tray with toast, eggs, bacon and a glass of orange juice. Ana coughed at the stench of the cigar. “Édesem, please eat some breakfast this morning. You look very tired…” Jarvis set the tray on the side of the hand-crafted wooden desk, careful not to lay the tray on top of some of Tony’s work.
Tony rolled over on his shoulder, closing his eyes he stared up at the blank ceiling. He’d received word from an agent through the door. Steve, Natasha, Clint and Peter. Oh, and Peter’s
Peter had been allowed to leave his work early after Margaret said that he worked too hard and that her son had come home early for Christmas so she would get him to clean out the coffee grinder, so Peter wasn’t too disappointed, he’d save up quite a bit of money, a nice amount to maybe treat himself after Christmas if he was still here but he was proud of himself, he’d work a job.. no one expect it of him at home, he was the heir to literally Billions, not that he cared but it was nice to work, no one stopping him on the street to get a photo of him or his parents. It was nice, peaceful even.
His son had lost a year of his life away from his friends and his family, left with his past self. Steve wasn’t as sure of himself in the 90’s fresh out the ice, he’d always second guessed himself and all the decisions he’d made but Tony finally kicked that out of him after disappearing in early 1999. Peter is going to look older, a year wiser, a lot could change in a year and that worried Steve the most.
Tony decided it was time to head back to the flat after a solid miss from Captain America left him with a tennis ball shaped lump on the back of his head. Picking up ice cream along the way, of course, Steve had promised to make it up to Tony. Peter was discussing robotics with Tony as they climbed the stairs, Steve followed, watching the pair interact. Steve knew they got along well but they were so similar, it’s so uncanny, he believed even for a moment that Howard had an affair, likely with a blonde-haired woman to get the mix of hair colour, he wouldn’t have put it past Howard to do that.
Hey all you lovelies! Just a wee note to say thank you for all your continued support of my first story on the Archive, thank you very much for all your comment, kudos and hits, it means a lot to me!
“Dude, What the Fuck is on your head?”
It had been 11 hours since Peter and his Dad had entered the workshop and they were no closer to dismantling the gauntlet. It didn’t even have a scratch from the hammer that his Pops had hit it with, after Dad had demanded he use his muscles for some good! His Pop’s finally put his foot down or actually just picked up his family to force them to dinner. Peter over his shoulder with his Dad dragged by his arms. Pizza takeaway for dinner on the couch. Perfect day in Peter’s opinion. His Pop had his arm wrapped around his Dad, who was asleep at his side. Peter wished his parent’s goodnight and wandered along to his bedroom. Ditching his trainers as he walked in Peter pulled open the 3
. Maybe one day Buck would understand that enough, to let him live in denial at the lost of his family that he’d never get. His fella and their son. Steve Rogers, a lonely retired veteran who lived quietly in Brooklyn, not disturbing his neighbours, reading books, learning to play instruments, going to the local baseball game and silently spending his days reading by the window. It would be a quiet life.
“BullSHIT!?. Are you serious? Show me.” Tony watched with a look of wonder and amusement. Peter turned to face Tony stared him directly in the eye when he jumped flipped and hung from the ceiling, with a rather casual look on his face.”
“Your parents are coming through the garage door now,” Steve held up the garage door as Tony ducked under and signaled for the Iron Man armour to connect with his body. “Peter, SitRep, now!” Steve positioned himself to the side of Tony, while his arm was still bandaged, Steve held the shield as best as he could to protect Tony and his bad arm.
Tony’s hand grab through his hair, distracted by the photo of his family on his desk. Peter remembered it. He last saw it months ago. It was taken at his Dad’s birthday party, they had all dressed up in the best for lunch, but by the time dinner came around they were in matching red joggers that had ‘Rogers’ printed down the leg. Peter was lifted in his Dad’s arms, with his Dad being lifted in his Pop’s arms. All laughing at their fun day together. It had been a while since he last saw it.
Clint watched the Peter boy come closer to him, judging him up and down before saying, “You’re a lot grumpier than I remember.” Peter turned and ran off to catch up with his parents, catching the sour faced expression of his Uncle in the reflection of the glass.
Peggy’s computer binged. She sat up in her chair, accepting the message, “P. Stark spotted 2 miles outside of a town in North Carolina. Will follow up with detail.” Opening the file, Peggy found the very blurred photos of a person walking down a town main street. When she found out Tony had thrown Peter out the house, she wanted to scream, she knew she shouldn’t have left Peter with him but when she went to collect Peter from Agent Coulson’s hide out. Peter had managed to slip past the pair at some point and ran. They hadn’t seen him since.
“Tony, Tony, are you there?” Steve said on the other end of the line, “Tony, Jarvis said you’ve not left the flat in days now…Tony?” Peter just stood in shock as Tony mouthed to him. ‘Who is it?’ Peter grabbed the red pencil that was lying on top of the phone box and wrote Steve in giant letters next to him on the wall. Tony almost fell off his chair. ‘I’m not here! Say I’m not here!’
Thor stepped forward ahead of the couple, Lightening shooting out of his open palm, the portal shut with a crash of thunder. Peggy stood motionless. Tony looked to his godmother. Jarvis hit the floor pretty quickly. Peggy rolled her eye as she turned to her staff. “Find the boy, whatever it takes.”
As Peter thought up his plan they moved through to pack Tony’s room. Tony had a lot of shit for such a tiny room. Peter was amazed at the amount of blueprint and construction paper Tony had just on his walls and floor, before they even moved on to the desk unit. Tony insisted on keeping it all. Peter was reluctant until he spotted a familiar design schematic. “DUM-EE!” Tony stopped was he was doing. He peered over Peter’s shoulder to investigate what design Peter was looking at. “Wait, you know this design?” Tony asked looking shocked. “Yeah!” Peter exclaimed while looking at the finer detail of the schematic, “You keep him in your workshop, he helps out or at least he tries to! He tries so hard sometimes… Man you have this framed in the lab above your desk, I never knew it was the real one.” Tony dropped everything.
“Oh joy! Two professional secret keepers, a cadet who was assigned to put up with me as well as the world war veteran for friends and a family I pay to keep around me, What life do you think I have! I’m living the million dream.” Sarcasm practically dripping for every word out of his mouth, “besides, I don’t see you rushing to tell Steve that I’m alive. Fuck me and Fuck Peter, He’s not my son, not yet, I don’t want kids, I want to get blackout wasted and just wake up in someone’s bed and build robots! I want to live!”
Flicking through his notes, Tony continued to run his hands through his hair to style it for the day, correcting some of his equations as he went. Tony set the notes down again to pull on his boots, Steve walked out of the shower, fully dressed and to Tony’s pleasant surprise, not the Captain America uniform, blue jeans, trainers and a white t-shirt, Steve was using the black towel to scrub his hair dry as he smiled at Tony.
“Ready Boss?” Clint typed the last of the code, holding his hand steady over the enter key for the all clear to start.
Peter stood by the door in a row with Jarvis and Tony, Ana was straightening up his appearance, shaping his hair and eyebrows, she had been kind enough to cut his hair down to a reasonable length last night after dinner, she sat him down on a closed lid toilet seat and went to town with the scissors, he felt more like himself again, if he had to be honest. She straightened up his checker shirt, flattening out the pocket on his chest before taken a step back to appreciate her own work. She moved on to Edwin, smiling at him, giving him a kiss on the cheek before moving on to Tony. Jarvis side eye glanced a Peter, giving a proud, ‘are you jealous of me’ smirk to Peter, who pulled a face right back at him, clear annoyance on his face.
“On their way boss.”
“So, you’re level eight clearance and he’s level nine, so I’m going to assume the Directors of Shield are level ten?” Natasha bounced back and forth on her heels, trying to lighten Steve’s bad mood. “Technically They are Level thirteen, and I don’t know anyone besides Cap, here whose higher than me. Never met a level eleven.” Barton just shrugged his shoulders, the thought didn’t sit easy with him but it’s never taken him long to gain levels and Steve doesn’t even seem to know that much more than him.
Steve Rogers could have died a war veteran in the 1940’s. No one in this time, beside his fellow art students could recognise the name. He was a nobody, by design to be fair, but he wanted a new life. He was hesitating on the change to Steve Stark. He’d considered taking his father’s name, hiding behind Joseph Rogers. For a short while he’d considered taking his mother’s maiden name, but he’d forgotten it, she’d been married to his father his entire life. A sad moment of memory that happened a life time ago for the rest of the world, well and truly forgotten. But it was just an idea on the long road home. But visiting Stark mansion one last time to apologise to Jarvis and Ana. He’d like to ask for maybe a jumper or two of Tony’s if there was anything of his left. Steve really wanted to ask his future self how they worked out in the end, when did they finally get together? What was their wedding like?
Steve nodded.
"...War...?" he said after a pause. He tried to keep his voice emotionless and probably failed.
"Okay," Steve whispered. He also sounded weary, and just a little broken somewhere below the surface. He drew marginally closer to Tony.
Tony: Yep. The biggest mistake of my life.
Tony: yeah
shower. This time he'd crash into bed right after and hopefully get a few hours of sleep before his shift started again. He and Hope hadn't repaired the damage for real. They had at best patched it up; it would hold for now, but for two people to do the job of five or six or ten, and in such a short time too – that would be impossible. Still, since the acute crisis was averted, Darryl had taken a team of competent, uninjured and fresh people and began the proper works on the damage. Some parts would need to be changed, some could be repaired, but it wasn't undoable. Everything would most probably turn out all right – right up to the next disaster.

Tony: Isn't everything about this just poetic?
. I continue. I exist. It's been months, and perhaps the pain has dulled a bit, but it's still there, an edge keen enough to stab me from the inside whenever I sit still for too long.

Logan gave the person a one-over. "Aw, fuck off, will ya."
Tony: Thank you, Steve. I never even say that, but thank you.
"Why ever the fuck not?" Tony wanted to yell these words, his muscles tight with sudden frustration, but even if he'd tried, his throat was suddenly too dry to oblige.
Tony gave him a long look. While Steve was nearly sure he would say yes – he wouldn't be here, after all, if he didn't wish to see Steve at all – Steve felt a cold stab of dread at the possibility of refusal. Because, back when he thought he'd lost Tony for good, he learned how to deal with the sadness, but now that he was on the verge of having him back, he couldn't stand the thought of losing him again.
, Tony told himself, and didn’t listen.
Tony: Yeah, me neither.
Steve had never really paid attention to how quiet it was around here. The wind outside had died down some time ago, and all that could be heard were the haphazard sounds of the house creaking, shifting in its sleep, and the crackling of the fire. In the silence and the firelight, every word seemed more significant, every movement more intimate somehow.
We removed layers upon layers and did our best to bare ourselves for each other. We got better at it with time, too.
Tony: I know.
"Yeah," Steve said, mimicking Tony's tone from minutes earlier. "
Both statements true, both statements painfully unfair. But all the old rot that exploded in Tony’s chest was suddenly suppressed, suddenly easier to stand, when Steve’s arm tightened around him drawing him impossibly closer. Somehow, that made it all bearable. But Steve buried his nose in Tony’s hair, and his breath hitched a little, and Tony knew he was thinking about Siberia as well.
seem like an axe murderer country." He was aiming for funny, but it mostly just came out as snippy. And it wasn't fair to Happy, just like it hadn't been fair to Happy for Tony to take off like that, on his own, without a word. But Tony's head hurt like eleven circles of Hades and he had a mother and a father of all hangovers. He wasn't in the mood for talking, he really wasn't, much less for feeling guilty. Actually, one of the reasons he'd decided to use the back roads was a vague hope there would be no signal and he'd be off the grid (and off the hook) for just a little while. But that was a no go. His tech was simply too good, unfortunately.
They've always worked together well. They've always understood each other practically without words, as long as it was about work and absolutely nothing else. On the field, they are a well-oiled machine. Outside of it, no mechanic in the world can fix them, apparently. There is no blueprint on this Earth that would help them understand each other better.
"You keep thinking of the people you're not celebrating it with" he supplied, point-blank, but with incredible gentleness in his voice. Was he supposed to say that or should he have shut up?
The moment is there and gone. And then there is no reason to look into Tony's eyes any longer. There's nothing there now.
"So you live here as a, what, a crazy inventor now?" Fury was saying.
of a jerk.“ Because it was true, and he could outjerk Steve any day, he could outjerk him ten to one.
"What date was it?" Tony asked quietly. "When they got you. Do you know?" Because it was a pretty innocent question, and not too personal, and Tony really wanted to know. He
, look it up.” But he was too weak to do anything about any of that, even if he’d thought it was a good idea at the moment, and it probably wasn’t. ”On second thought, no;  don’t ever watch it. I don’t want to hear how much you hate it.” He took a deep breath. Listened to Steve’s heartbeat for a moment or two. “Cap?”
Tony: Didn't.
Tony: Antideps make me fat.
The closed door to Tony's room seemed like an affront.
"You're dead," he informed me, which explained a few things. Then he stopped, stared hard into my eyes. "Shit," he said. "
Tony: I'm so going to regret telling you these things tomorrow.
It wasn't something in those blue eyes, it absolutely wasn't. Or if it was – and it
BACHMAN: We cannot comment on this!
But: “Actually...” Steve made a small pondering noise in his throat, the one Tony had learned to recognize as Steve wondering whether to say something or not. “It was in 2012. You’d invited me over.” Steve’s voice felt deceptively light.

Then, moments later, very quietly: "Tony?"
Tony: People will instinctively know honesty, mostly. You just need to stand there and open a vein.
Tony: It sure seemed that way.

Tony: It is what it is.
There was too much emotion in the air. He tried to shake it off. "We need to get moving," he said briskly.
The empathetic insight shook him slightly.
That was when the door went down and the shooting started.
," he gasped.
Tony: i'm a little drunk
"Some." There was something more to Tony's offhand comment, it occurred to Steve all of a sudden. He looked at Tony, really looked, at all the nooks and crannies of his face, the circles around his eyes, the tiny new lines that weren't all age. Tony opened his mouth to speak, but Steve beat him to it for once. "You've been trough much more crap than he," he said. "At least back when I knew him. And it..." For a long moment, he thought hard of what he was going to say next. Inhaled. "In my experience, it either turns people hard or it gives them compassion. When all's said and done, I think you came out a lot kinder than Howard ever was."
I don’t know what people
"Don't you huff at me," Tony snapped. (Steve hadn't been aware of doing it; he compressed his lips.) "You still aren't cleared to enter the States," Tony went on. "I don't have the time to go gallivanting with you around the world. If you want, come by my cabin in the Swiss Alps next Friday, I'll be there. I'm hosting some kind of a corporate retreat, don't ask, it's something that I..." Tony fell silent mid-sentence, as if deliberately cutting off the flow of words. He took an audible breath. Somehow managed to sound even more tired. "Anyway. They are coming on Saturday. If you come by on Friday, we can talk in the evening, if that's what you want. I'll send you the coordinates. You could drive, I suppose, but honestly, the weather may be a little shifty..."
Steve didn't really mind, right now. He returned his gaze, unflinching. "Yes. And you were the one who said that, if you left, it would be forever."
"I need all of you to know this is no game." He was trying to look dead stern, but the word that came to Tony's mind instead was
And Tony, acutely aware they will be parting ways right now, was deliberately forgetting to return the sweater, so that he'd have a keepsake. He was like a fanboy out of nightmares, he thought. He should stop.
go for a run too? On the other hand, the packed schedule got their minds off other things, such as wondering if their friends and families back home were alive, if they would ever see them again. Still, did he spot signs of exhaustion on some of the nuggets? When you're dog-tired, you can't think well, you can't steer well, your  reflexes get shitty and you make mistakes. Maybe this had gone far enough. Which also brought him to another question. He looked at Natasha thoughtfully. "Do you think it's actually harmful? The war with the tech? Should I talk to Darryl, put a stop to it, do you think?"
"What if I hadn't been exactly forthright with you?"
"Oh. Fine. It was fine."
And only when all that was done, he asked: "Darryl, what's the situation? Where's Cap."
Tony just nodded. See, this worked marvelously too. Just let him squirm. He didn't have to say anything, even. "Uh-huh," he made himself say anyway.
"Is this why you woke me up?" Bruce turned over in bed and squinted at Tony. "It's still dim-lights. What
Curiosity won. "Did he come to you when I refused his application?" he asked. He wasn't even pissed. In the situation they were in, you couldn't really be choosy; as Fury said, you were stuck with the men you had. Still:
Tony: You still have friends.
that tends to invite people he barely knows to live with him in his home after one battle, a lunch and some bonding. You don't have the best track record, Tony."
He gave Steve a piercing look, a sharp frown. "You saw us. On the balcony." Matter-of-factly. But not. There was something else in his voice too.
Tony: White pawn to e4.
holding Steve by the hand and leaning towards him with his whole body. "We'll need to talk at some point," Steve says reluctantly into Tony's hair.
"So. You talking marriage, eh?" he said after he let go of me. He didn't say it with his usual animation, but he did make a valiant attempt.
" he said, and I didn't believe the wryness of his smirk for one second. I think he knew it.
"Hm?"
Tony: It's just not coming.
aloud; bites his lips hard instead. Still, a harsh breath on the verge of a moan escapes his lips, uncontrollable, as Tony pushes them as deep as they would go –
. With less urgency and more... intimacy, he supposed. But, he reminded himself, it wasn't as if Steve exactly went around lusting after him every day. Tony forced himself to stop for a sec, tear his gaze away. "You're sure about this, right?" he asked, a bit sobered up. Then: "Steve?"
Tony: just words
would have been something. A sign. Tony
In any case, he'd sounded almost normal when he said it. And then he added: "I just didn't think I'd be up for being this friends-with-benefits thing with you, not again, but you know what, why the fuck not. We're friends. We can have benefits. Right?" He smiled at me, and it was just a little tense, just a little on the brittle side. Still, it seemed genuine enough.
“I don’t know, would you like me to? Because I’m thinking Australia.”
"I suppose," Steve allowed, finishing his sandwich. Throwing politeness to the wind, he'd eaten it in three or four huge bites, and now he was starting to feel more like himself. "But you'd have done the same."
Come. With me.” That was absolutely the closest he could manage to an outright invitation at this moment in time.
He was being an idiot. And Natasha is Steve's. She's his special friend, his adopted sibling, his anima. Tony is happy they have each other, he is. It would be petty to be jealous of that; but then again, he's not exactly a stranger to pettiness. Maybe he can make a piece with all this  in time, or maybe he can shorten the process by cutting his own head off. That should solve the problem.
Tony: What I’m trying to say is
Bucky is back, and so is Sam, and Wanda too, and Clint has his family, and Tony has little Peter, and there will be time for celebration and time for clean-up and time for rebuilding. But later. Steve is tired. They all are. So, first things first. Around them is ruin and wreckage, but many good things have survived. The lake house is one of them. And even if he and Tony have lived a the Compound for convenience, some of Steve's dearest memories took place at the cottage.
One of her eyebrows twitched. It looked suspiciously like amusement.
According to what Tony had told him
Tony: Okay.
And now, here, Tony seemed more distant with every word, every sentence made him even less Steve's than before. This was Tony's real life, his ticket out of here, and he was going to go, and Steve was going to stay, and that was going to be that.
"Nope," Tony said. "We're not."
"You... be safe," Tony replied lamely as he pulled away a bit. He wasn't disappointed – or he shouldn't be, he thought – everything was great, everything was better than he could have ever hoped, and he'll
"Oh, don't get me wrong," Steve said looking around, eyebrows raised appreciatively. "I love the place."
Tony: But I’m not used to admitting any kind of need or want, so it’s going to be hard work.
, the rest of him figured it was going to be okay, just for a second longer, just a minute, just to say goodbye.
I'm here, with Tony, and I'm grateful for every moment. I'm sure I don't deserve all the happiness I got to have again. I've had three chances with the man I love. It's more than
to him – he doesn't even want to know what, doesn't want to imagine it, just wants it to be something Tony wants,
"You having a good time?" she asks. And while Tony wants to quip about how wet feet and kneeling in the snow are his idea of a very best time, he doesn't. He's not quite sure where he stands with Natasha any more. He doesn't want to spoil any more of what's left between them.
"In my timeline, you wielded the gauntlet," he told me.
He still felt compelled to say, "I can't guarantee you that I'm emotionally ready for that kind of relationship."
, deeply asleep, had a vision of drawing Tony. This was where it got weird (no, wait, everything was weird
It used to be so much easier to talk to Tony. But, Steve had to admit, it was mainly because Tony himself had talked, and it was enough for Steve to just be there, and react, and say something now and again; it had all seemed deceptively easy. Now Tony was uncharacteristically silent (and awkward; and abrupt) and Steve couldn't figure out why.
"Your teeth are chattering," Steve observed from the blanket nest Tony was becoming acutely jealous of. The man still didn't sound drowsy in the least. Was he lying there, stewing as well? The thought wasn't as satisfactory as Tony expected it to be. Steve hadn't really
"That we didn't do it earlier," Steve finished.
The instructor's chair was to the right of Tony's, but Rogers almost never used it like a normal person would. He typically stood to Tony's left instead, holding on to the handle on the wall.
For a moment Natasha thought Steve was, uncharacteristically enough, asking for help with a combat situation, but that made no sense, since he rode safely in the middle... Then her gaze snapped to him and she registered how dangerously he was swaying in the saddle, and:
“All right.” Tony echoed and leaned against his chest.
I couldn't move. My heart was doing its best to choke me again. When I could finally speak, the best I managed was, "We
STARK: I know. I... There were many people who looked up, at a
Tony: Well, maybe you don’t know me as well as you think you do.
, dammit, Steve, I can't talk and count at the same time, you know that." He rewarded this with a snort, because it was bullshit, and she glared at him. "Besides," she added offhandedly. "If I went running with them, they'd think I was openly supporting our side, so they'd think the info they know we are getting was coming from me, and then they'd think it was via Darryl and Thor, and that would be bad. So."
He nodded. "I think so. Some."
Tony: Natasha's onto us.
Yet, when Tony isn't looking, Steve drinks in his face – it looks a little older, a little more tired. Dearer than ever. He doesn't allow himself to stare, not too much, otherwise Tony might see, and know. And when he isn't quite looking, Steve has this vague impression that Tony's eyes are following him in turn, studying him, trying to decipher, to parse, to put together and pull apart, discern what's inside. He says nothing about it. Tony doesn't either.
His friends had come to rescue him, of course. No surprise there. Natasha suspected that, in every world, that was a constant. Steve did inspire loyalty in people, true enough, but it wasn't just that. He knew how to pick them too, she supposed. He would spot you, and like you, and go on fiercely believing in you even if you yourself didn't – until you relented.  Who else, she mused, would befriend Thor, a Saxon hostage who had been  little more than a prisoner, really, and let him guard his back, and give him a war-hammer to wield, and eventually knight him? Who else would accept a lady determined to bear arms (and knight her too, to the general disgust of his court), or take in a low-born petty thief, even a one exceedingly talented with a bow and arrow (whom he had also knighted as soon as he got a chance)? Steve had knighted even Bruce – a wizard of erratic powers, with no real skill with weapons of any sort. Okay, so they were all blind drunk at the time, and Bruce didn't stand the proper vigil afterwards, so it probably didn't count, but
"All I did blew up in my face. I fucked up. But, Tony, I..." The voices were outside their door now, and the first thud resounded.
Tony: Oh.
They had bought some time with that booby trap that went boom, because no one was shooting at the lock now. Still, it was boot against wood, and the wood was old. Won't be long now.
, he thought, and figured he should probably stop thinking altogether. That was the safest option.
Steve's heart sank, but he couldn't say he hadn't been expecting this. A perfect opportunity to nod and say nothing more on the subject, ever, but he had to see this through.
Oh, god. The eggs. I wasn't an expert cook at the best of times, but I could usually make scrambled eggs, as long as, unlike now, I remembered not to leave them sitting on the stove indefinitely. I started stirring frantically, but even though the heat had been very low (someone told me that was how you made eggs buttery and soft), they had turned into something dry and even gummier than usual. Tony peered into the pan over my shoulder. Sniffed.
Tony: Well, then.
The thing was, Steve could. The idea bloomed inside him, spreading petals, and he realized he'd been watering the seed of it for a very long time, ever since Tony first told him where he came from. It had been an idle dream, sure, but now it was becoming solid, almost palpable – to traverse the universe, see different planets, do good. With
Tony: Apparently I have to do a press conference  on Monday.
"Yeah?"
I come over to him, peel them off his sandwich, toss them in the garbage.
Tony: I'll think about options if you think about options, okay?
Tony: That I'm going to fuck you up further.
"What the hell
Tony: No?
Tony: I think it's going to get split in two, actually. Hell, I'm going to give a birth to Athena. I have a mother and father of all headaches in the world, and I think I'm going to throw up, and I just took the meds, and they should kick in soon, I hope they do. But I was just sitting here, thinking how I should have known sooner, and I can't shake that feeling, that's all.
Once, he told himself. He would ask one more time, directly, and that will be it.
In the beginning, there is a victory won, albeit a bittersweet one. There is a victory, and then a seemingly endless cleanup; after a big victory, the world tends to need some care. That's the beginning, even though some might call it the end. But this is, after all, just a matter of semantics. One thing needs to end so that something new can start.
Tony: So last night my sight was still too blurry-like to figure out what it was you sent me. And this morning I guess I'm too hungover to make heads or tails of the fact that you sent me an old newspaper photo of Reed Richards?
tastes like shit or it's the tongue itself. Small sips. It's ages since he'd drunk enough to actually be hung-over.
after the book two. I can't stomach dogs dying."
Steve pulls him down on top of him and claims his lips for a time. "Strings," he says afterwards, "sound really good."
Tony slung his small bag over his shoulder. He was wondering if he was supposed to do the rounds, say good bye to everyone or if a general wave to the dormitory at large would be enough. Lang was, of course, diligently shaking hands with all the Daves and Gales and Dales. Tony wondered if he himself might sneak out while the attention was on the other man. Oh, he could be hyper-social with the best of them. Still, he'd give a lot only to skip talking to Justin Fucking Hammer. The man was insufferable.
There were a hundred things he would have normally done in a situation like this. A scorching look through lowered lashes, a corner of his mouth dancing slightly, a slow, deliberate caress of thumb over Steve’s wrist, over his pulse. But all of that seemed inadequate, and almost like a betrayal.
Still not looking at him, Steve shrugged. Different? No, maybe not. But they'd have been together, and to him it would have been important, and he knew – thought –
All the while he kept telling himself he'd help Steve best if he did the job in front of him, just like he'd been told to – repeatedly. He also, in a les controlled voice, kept telling himself that whatever happened, it was probably entirely his fault, because he couldn't fix things faster, because he kept distracting Steve with inane questions instead of letting him focus on his own safety.
love. And he
Tony: Because whenever I ask how bad it is, you change the subject.
Tony considered. It didn't really need any more consideration, but cursorily, he checked his feelings. There was nothing there any more. "I did," he said quickly. "I don't."
The finger slams into him again, so deceptively close to where Steve wants it but very decidedly
A lot happened during the following six months. What I want to say is, we didn't just mope around and talk about our feelings and watch movies, although there was quite a lot of that, too, actually. Ice-cream as well. What can I say, clichés are often clichés because they
Tony: Thanks, buddy.
shrewd," Tony commented.
Tony: And this goes way beyond politics, which is why Everhart is listening to what I have to say at all.
"Tell me how you're feeling," Tony told him firmly, trying to anchor him.
"Let's go get some ice cream and wrap ourselves in blankets and watch movies. Jesus, Steve. You need to
"Huh." Jacobson seemed genuinely puzzled at his request. Then: "Stark's a fine engineer. I don't know about piloting. But around here he did his job real well, as long as I let him do what he wanted."
The voice is metallic and level and it almost catches Steve by surprise, because he's used to hearing Tony's voice over the comm even when he has his helmet down. Over the comm, it's still Tony's voice. Tony doesn't lift the faceplate now, makes no move to step out of the armor, he's just standing there, near the door, all red and gold and cold.
. You're a regular mother hen, did you know that?"
"Screw you, Tony. Kiss me."
Their eyes met. Electric shock was an old metaphor, but at least one aspect was sure true: it's generally impossible for the shock victim to let go of the energized object. They were glued to the spot.
It makes sense, really. This is the most affordable semi-decent hotel around, and the secret new SHIELD is apparently even cheaper than the old one. There is also the fact that this place is closest to the convention venue. And the convention itself is primarily aimed at middle-aged, unsuccessful dentists who are looking to learn how to rekindle their business. Of course the attendants would pick the inexpensive nearby hotel to stay in.
Before he could think about what he was doing, he bent down and pressed his lips softly to Tony's forehead. It was almost like someone else was doing it. But as he lingered there for a second, his lips against Tony's warm skin, a wave of thrill shook him. He stepped back quickly, flushed, opened his mouth to say something, to apologize.
"Yeah." Tony swallowed. Tried to think of what to say next, because his first sentence was, horrifyingly, starting to sound as if he was inviting Steve Rogers over for a Christmas party or something, and if there was anything that could make this situation more awkward, it was that kind of misunderstanding.
"Like I really didn't want to get up?" Steve paused, rubbed his forehead impatiently. Sighed. "Look, Tony... I feel... weak. Weak
"I missed you too, Tony." As replies went, this one was blueberry pie and stars and late night coding sessions and all the good things in life, rolled into one.
"It's red, though," Steve said with a most beautiful, tiny smile and he pushed the sweater into Tony's unresisting arms. "I think you'd look
sounded a bit out of breath, which was... weird. For a moment Tony thought Steve was going to examine the masonry, but in the end he just leaned against it.
Once they are a bit further down the corridor, they pause. Steve is in front of him. His hair is sweaty, the shape of his shoulders so close and familiar. Tony knows Steve's cheeks are probably still burning, his eyes still bright, and yet, once dressed, he suddenly seems unapproachable again. Which is – well, its ridiculous, probably.
Steve, the one that was braver, maybe, or quicker, or worthier than me. "I figured."
He doesn't need to ask why. Tony doesn't need to say
, a starburst, a flood of pleasure, and Steve cries out uncontrollably.
Tony: Eventually.
"Is that an Asgardian thing? I thought it was an Asgardian thing."
Tony: I think we can unclench. Don’t WORRY, babe.
"Steve," Tony says, his voice so week already. Is it trembling with pain or... – yes, with urgency, too. Steve looks into his eyes, trying not to think that this might be the last time, because – it's inconceivable. Steve refuses that possibility completely. At the very least, Steve will stay here forever, holding Tony in his arms, and time will run no longer.
, he mused.
Tony: and than I realized: why would you even want them
Tony: Okay.
"Actually," Tony said, "it's statistically improbable there would be two axe murderers in one car, and since you are one..."
Tony: That if we're actually still managing to talk regularly after more than a month, without biting each other's head off, this is probably not the stupidest or the most harmful thing I've ever been doing. But to watch my ass because I'm actively breaking the law, which yeah, newsflash.
you cook. You can do the dishes afterwards if you want."
To get his mind off things it shouldn't touch with a ten foot pole, Tony tried – yet again – to figure out why they were being kept here. The captors had apparently wanted nothing from him. They did strip the leftover parts of his suit, but no one had come in to even talk to him. They did take Steve's blood, so this whole shindig had to have something to do with the supersoldier serum. And they'd experimented on Steve, maybe. To see how he'd react to the drugs and whatever chemicals they pumped him full of. Tony shuddered.
But that was a long time ago, and everything is changed, and he really shouldn't be thinking about this.
real. It's sweet and intimate and sensual and Tony could happily drown in Steve's kisses.
all of it, but it was as if he could barely access his own feelings). "You were sitting there, drawing pictures of you and Tony Stark, thinking about how much you missed him?"
Tony repeated to himself, and, just like everything else tonight, he decided he shouldn't have said it, back then. Too late, now.
"I don't think you people realize how tiny your lives are," Thor told him. "And short."
The red bed cover, the toy train, a pair of pint-sized skis (his heart practically stopped at the sight of the skis). It felt too intimate, even being in here. It felt like a violation. Stepping into a life that wasn't his, seeing something he wasn't supposed to be privy to. And yet, Tony had told him to come here, and given him this room to stay in, and Steve remembered the softness in his eyes when he looked around the sitting room and touched upon the topic of his parents during that one short moment when it had seemed something between him and Steve was thawing.
“Yeah, it’s working because I’m all emotional because I’m having a meltdown from the stim. And the circumstances won’t be so easy to replicate since I’m not metabolizing that shit ever again.”
Tony: You signed off already, didn't you.
Steve sighed deeply. "I'm mostly just Steve these days."
"Some time ago, yeah."
"Really, Cap? I had no idea you were a cuddler." It sounded forced. He could practically feel Steve roll his eyes on the other side of the cell.
When the door to the hotel room finally opens, Steve can hear his own sharp intake of breath. On reflex, he tries to sit up, feels the tug of the handcuffs on his wrists, and it's delicious. He hates to admit it to himself, but that's how it is, and he's blushing, he knows he's blushing and it makes him blush even more.
"You okay?" Tony asked.
Tony: No?
Tony: About that.
"...diverged from
(I'd always loved the way Tony shook hands). I covered it with my other palm, tenderly, like a little bird. It wasn't the way a friend would comfort you, but it wasn't exactly the way a couple would hold hands, either. It was somewhere in between, and I it was a perfect reflection our relationship at that moment in time.
"We should probably try to come up with some sort of a plan," he said when Steve seemed finished with exercising and started pacing purposelessly.
Tony: Sounds good to me.
We fucked up in that we didn't figure it out in time. Steve
them, but somehow not like this. The fact cut his gut in half, and that was the moment he knew he was in deep shit.
“Shoo. In MY office, come on.” Tony gestured towards the office with his hands. Obi’s smirk fell, turning on his foot to walk back into the office. He picked his tumbler glass off of the counter, swishing his glass around with the ice clicking against the sides. He made his way round to the other side of the desk, Tony picked up his pace and slid into the chair from the other side before Obadiah could sit in his chair. He smiled with a boyish grin up to where Obi stood above him, whisky in hand. Obadiah made his way round to the other side again, sitting down opposite Tony in the black leather chair.
Tony pulled down his white top that he’d fallen asleep in to make himself more presentable, he opened the door, and smiled kindly to the man behind the door, “Ah Robert, good to see you again!” He shook Robert’s hand firmly, “Good to see you are well, Young Master Anthony, I’m going to assume by your general appearance that you and your guest are not packed for the journey home.” Tony lifted his head proudly, “Ah, Robert, you know me so well!” Tony invited the older gentlemen into the apartment.
Peter led the way down the hall to his Pop’s new room, currently empty besides a matching; desk, bedside table and bed. The dark navy-blue sheets from the old flat were sitting folded on the bed near two pillows. The pair worked quickly to prepare the bed once the sheets were on, Peter sat on the bed to get the pillow cases sorted while Steve sat down and pulled his leg sitting across his body, undoing the boot straps and dropping them to the ground with a thud, rubbing his feet with both his hands to tease out the stress.
The pair made their way up to the black metal and deep oak bench. Engraved with a family crest in the centre, vines, flowers and branches surrounding the entire design. Peter thought it looked amazing, running a finger along the vines, as he sat down, he followed it back to the centre crest design, “Its family’s crest, they didn’t have one until Howard asked my father what was most important to him, so Howard commissioned this to be made…” She looked lost in memory at a time long gone by, “He was a good man back then. Nowadays he’s more focused on all the money in the world, rather than moments like that one.” She gestured to the crest on the bench.
‘He looks healthier than expected’
He’d considered going out but with the risk of being spotted too great, poor Karen had been relegated to running possible return home plans for the last couple of months. Peter made sure his wallet was ready, he couldn’t open any bank accounts, due the fact he hadn’t been born yet so he was carrying a lot of cash that he’d earned around with him. He also made sure everything was switched off in his room before grabbing his clothes and taking them to the shower.
Steve threw himself down on the couch next to his son. Peter almost immediately slid down, placing his head down to lay in his father’s lap. Steve ran his hand through Peter’s much longer hair, random lengths cut into it, they’d fix that once he was home, his hair was slightly blonder, maybe it was exposer in the sun from all his traveling, it left a bitter taste in Steve’s mouth, he’d hoped it was from him, that his genetics had finally shown through in his son, strands of blonde hair mixed with Tony’s appearance. Steve let a soft smile grace his face, running his hand up and down Peter’s arm a comforting gesture from when he was just a toddler. Peter shuffled his head to nuzzle into the heat.
“But I don’t want to lose anymore family, I will forgive you, only if Steve forgives you, my life has been lonely, but his…” He didn’t hope that Steve truly missed him, that would be extremely selfish of him, to think that Steve would mourn him, “ he believes that everyone he knows in his life is dead. You keep taking people away from him. But I’m about to come back from the dead, so if he can forgive you, then I will too.” Tony looked up to his aunt, she flew forward into his arms, he clutched her in his chest, falling back to land on his butt. He wrapped his arms around her back, crying quietly into her shoulder. She sniffled, taking her hand up to his cheek, “You are very kind Anthony. I’m so very sorry for what I have done to you and I hope you can forgive me.” Tony nodded into her side.
Peter slowly raised his head again coming face to face with the stranger. A stranger who he had seen before. Only in photos because that was the only way it was possible. That it was even plausible. Maybe Peter had finally lost it.
The argument started 2 hours ago but the last 20 minutes had been devoted solely to Peter and his appearance. “Tony he could be dangerous, he recognised and spotted one of Shield’s top spies from a roof top across the court yard from him. He knew him by name Tony. That’s not possible.” Steve sighed for the millionth time this morning. “I just want you safe Tony, I’m working for Shield to…”
Tony walked over to the phone attached to the wall in the far corner of the room, stepping over the same pyramid of paint tins they had bought to redecorate the living room. “What kind pizza do you like?” Tony had already picked up the phone and had begun roto-dialing the number. “Same as you.” Peter stated in a ‘matter of fact’ tone. “NY Bronx pizza what’s your order?” The women on the other side of the phone, sounded bored, when Tony replied, staring directly at Peter, “Two regular Pepperoni pizza, extra red sauce.” Peter grinned.
but we went back to see Dum_Ee! And he was super happy to see you and then you hit Dad with a tennis ball and then-“ Tony stretched out on the bed, finally free of a suit and crossed his legs the other way round.
Steve scrambled forward, barely standing up to get next to the man. Dirt kicked up around him as he held his hands over the man, unsure if he could touch, or would he wake up? He turned to look over his shoulder, '
“You are currently rocking out on campus at M.I.T, we are just North West of Boston city and before you ask I’m here to get my PHD and this is my last year here.” Tony did a dramatic spin as he spoke, “Ok, What do you do Peter, I know you said you were 17 but you seem pretty smart?” come on genius child, come on, come on, Tony thought to himself, it wasn’t the end of the world but you know, bragging rights and peace of mind, another genius to talk to.
“They told me you were dead!? That you were in the car when it crashed!
Tony.
“Night Tony.”
is going to be annoyed at him for … putting them on and meeting them half way at Shield compound in 1992.
“I will give you, whatever resources you want.” Steve looked back up to Peg, who was back in Director mode. “Whatever, whoever. Anything, just catch the assassin before he gets Anthony.” She raised her hand up to stop Steve before he interrupted, “Do not worry about Howard, He has himself and Shield behind him. He will be fine. But Anthony needs protection. No matter the cost. Do you understand?” Steve sat up right hands on each of his knees, “Yes Director.” The car pulled to halt outside of warehouse in the middle of the docklands, Steve’s best assumption was in the Upper West Side of the city.
Jarvis entered the kitchen, pulling on his out door gloves. “Oh, I thought we were going a walk?” Tony looked between Ana and Peter, “how about Peter stays here and help you Ana, Jarvis and I can go a walk!” Peter smiled and nodded at the idea, this could be his only time to get to know Ana, “I’d like that.” Ana grinned sweetly. “I will always say yes to extra hands in the kitchen! Off you two go then!”
Steve covered his face with his hands before making his way over to Tony. Tony had turned in a fit of childish rage. “What was that?!” Steve just raised his shoulders in a shrug trying not to giggle. “Call yourself Captain America with that throw!? Bullshit, I could do better! Come on now you owe me ice cream!” Steve just walked over to Tony, wrapping his arms over Tony’s shoulders in a hug. “Sorry T, come on DUM_EE’s had enough for today, let’s go back, I’ll bring you a blanket and Ice cream, how does that sound?”
“Do you see him in me is that it? I’m too old a man for you now is that it? Tony is immature, lazy and a challenge to deal with. What is it Steve, you defend him like you breathe. I don’t understand.” Steve really wanted to punch him. Right on the nose. “Howard, would you stop provoking the poor Captain.” The pair turned to look over to where the voice was coming from, the entrance to a hallway Steve hadn’t noticed before. Maria Stark.
Steve flinched from the prodding in his back, turning swiftly to place his hand on his hip, the other currently wrapped across his chest for another day or at least that’s Uncle B’s best guess. The healing factor of a super solider really messes with the whole, 3 to 6 months of recommended recovery. Tony let out a single relaxed laugh, hoping off the counter to stand next to Steve on his uninjured side, leaning against his husband good arm. “fair, fair what do you want this morning kiddo?” he crossed his arms, “Cereal, peanut butter toasties or your Pop’s favourite war time breakfast biscuits, so hard and stale he could knock out hydra faster than his shield.”
Seconds later Tony was brought into the kitchen by Maria gripping his upper arm tightly, “Jarvis get the med kit. Howard broke the mirror.” Peter rushed to Tony’s side, trying to assess the situation, there was small shards of glass in his shoulder, Tony’s face showed nothing, he just stared off in the distance. “Peter go grab some clothes for Tony from his room.” Peter booked it towards the main stairs, where Howard sat with his hand in his hair, elbows sat on his knees. He looked up to Peter. Peter just sneered at him as he walked by him on the stairs, he could feel the anger throbbing through his veins.
He remembered every groove on the shield, it was so familiar to him and his family, it sits in the corner of the living room for his Dad to forget, trip and stub his toe on, it was also used as Peter’s tobogganing sled when he was a baby. Steve watched Peter caresses the outside of the shield, he’d seen people do that before, like Agent Coulson, respect the shield but Steve could tell this was different, Peter was almost as familiar with the shield as he was, which was impossible, Steve hadn’t seen or met Peter before in his life.
The room fell to a deafening silence. Scientists hid subconsciously behind their desks but peaked over the top of their monitors,“If you thought he was dangerous, I am far worse.” Steve took a step forward in Peggy’s direction, the guns clicked loudly as they turned off the safety lock. “Where is Peter?” Director Pierce stepped forward. “I’ve had enough of your dramatics, guards arrest this man.” Peggy turned her head round to Pierce but Steve was much quicker, grabbing Pierce by the neck, holding him up and off his feet, he squeezed lightly, walking slowly down the room towards the door. “I’m sick and tired of Shield, thinking my son is a weapon, someone they can control. I’m taking him home. Far away from your
“Thor!” Peter called out. Thor? As in… the God of Thunder, god someone nailed their sons name when he was born, he truly looked like a god, Tony thought to himself, Tall blonde and handsome, just his type.
“Hey, Ste, not the time, I know but, I can’t really breath with your strength right now.” Steve let go, lifting Tony so that he at his side rather than on his lap. He face bright red now from the tears. Tony let out a stuttering laugh, matching with Steve’s almost historically laugh of joy. He’s alive.
Natasha threw her book at Peter, his spider-sense alerting him to the danger. He caught the book in his outstretched hand. Natasha smiled, “You miss them?” Peter nodded, “Sorry, just… sometimes I let myself think that i’m actually going home, back to my parents, I know that they are here technically! But… they just aren’t them, not yet, they aren’t confident, my dad would never second guess himself and my Pops, he wouldn’t just follow orders. I know it sounds stupid just… he’s a captain not a soldier.” Natasha slowly nodded and agreed, “Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you get home and kick some sense into Steve’s commander voice.” The pair whipped their heads up to the faint sounds in the distance, the roar of engines flying nearby. “Might be sooner rather than later. Get ready kid.” Natasha reached over to the side table to throw Peter his web shooter. Natasha’s watch began to let out a series of beeps. Peter prepared for the worst, he only had a single web shooter capsule left.
“Have fun playing dress up with my dad as a glorified spy. I hope you two are very happy together! Don’t call me again. Bye asshole and for the record it is none of your concern who Peter is!” Tony slammed the phone down on the holder on the wall, breathing deeply. Peter just stood in shock, he’d never seen his parents argue like this before.
Steve landed roughly into a roll and kicked his feet under him, running again to catch up with the next truck. His suit now sporting fresh burn marks along his back after hitting the road at about 40mph. Steve with laboured breath threw his shield into the side of the second truck. Free of the shield, Steve used both his arms fully in a sprint. He leaped up on to his shield perched on the side of the truck on top of his shield.
“Thank you, delta seven leader, mission filed a success, bring the Captain and Hawkeye to the facility upstate.” Peggy aimlessly stepped around herself, moving without a care between her feet in a small circle. “What evidence did you find?” She looked out the window of her upstate office, appreciating the view of the vast forest landscape. “So, he has been made aware…” She sighed, turning once again to look down at the file on her desk, “Do it. The board of Directors will agree to this, wipe their memory of the event, call it a Hydra ambush. Burn the Letter and any evidence of Peter Stark.”
“Peter Stark, I am asking you and you alone, is this the portal that sent you here and will you just step near it?” Peggy’s voice started loud, and by the end of the sentence she had relaxed to a normal volume, but the room had gone silent.
“Young Peter, we have narrowed it down to two possibilities, the first is that the weapon is an escape plan for the alien race, that they could go back in time to try once again to fix their mistake of loss in a battle or the second… is to provide mercy for the victim of the attack, allow them to relive a moment that they wish they could fix. But considering you are not born yet, and these are not your memories, we strongly agree it is the first option.” Thor sat in a meditative pose that Wanda had taught Peter, Thor and Bruce a while ago, a position to find peace and a calm state of mind. Peter decided it would be a good idea to do the same.
“No, not at all”
“So last night in this flat, what do you want to do?” Peter asked rubbing his eyes on his wrist, to remove any stray tears. Tony surveyed the room. Well the beds are striped, but the TV is still plugged in…” Tony jumped up, energy exploding from his body in excitement.
“Overwhelmed again. So, I just said I had already found a place, he was ok with the idea till he found out it was Tony. Then Howard tried everything money could buy, anything to get me to leave. I’m sure he could have just had Shield find us and carry me out, but I guess he knew I was settling so he just had to get over himself.” Natasha watched Steve get lost in the memory of it. His eyes would glaze over, the reflection of the fire shining bright in them. She noticed that he subconsciously rubs his watch, back and forth on his wrist. Peter does the same, just a flash of a thought but impossible for her to forget. Steve shook himself out of his thoughts.
The sweat-ridden manager lead Rhodey through the main dance floor and up some more stairs, through to a secret back room. Opening the deep navy curtains, Rhodey entered the room slowly. Music blaring loudly, you could feel it through the floor and up your spin. A full sensory overload. Rhodey couldn’t find Tony immediately but the clatter of glass on to the floor immediately caught his attention.
Peter just sat down on the floor, his back hitting the floor hard, he could feel the jolt up his spine. What was he going to do, his world is literally collapsing in front of him, he might not go back to his family as he knows them. Luckily for Peter, this Tony Stark was more a glass half full kind of guy. “It isn’t impossible kid, I’m not your Dad but I’m still Tony Stark son of Howard Stark, I’m smart. I can help, I want you to go home to me as well kid, well l future me.” Tony slowly moved closer to Peter, taking his hand in his.
“Yeah, Yeah, he’s secretive but he’s good, he wouldn’t come unless he has an answer. I’m just hoping that Director Stark hasn’t got some super-secret clearance level 11 bunker that we aren’t supposed to find!” Steve shook his head slightly, reaching for a sip of his beer. “I wouldn’t put it past Howard, to be honest.” Natasha just ate her food in silence, carefully watching Steve’s face and reaction, if Steve was honest, it was slightly unnerving, he wasn’t going to let it show on his face. Natasha smirked.
Steve turned to look over his shoulder, watching closely as the river followed the road, maybe he should go back to church, pray for forgiveness, not for …caring about Tony, but that he lost him too early. That he couldn’t protect the friend he had. Steve changed his mind again, he wouldn’t go to church but he wished he could speak to his mother. She would tell it to him straight, what to do next? He wondered what she would have thought of Tony, would she understand it all? She always said he liked people his height, at the time, short, spunky and larger than life brunettes. She’d want to make Tony dinner and Tony would have taken one look at their apartment and replaced everything in it. Or break everything so he could replace it.
Tony shook his head with a mutter of ‘sorry’. Lost in his own world. Tony didn’t seem all to focused when he asked, “Who is Steve Rogers to you?” Tony’s eyes were focused on a spot on the work bench, his mind racing behind them. Peter hesitated ever so slightly. “He’s a good man, he taught me a lot.” That seems to have satisfied Tony for now, he smiled gently to himself. “Peter, why do you think I haven’t heard from Steve?” Tony lifted his head, starring directly into Peter’s eyes. “I honestly don’t know, this assassin guy is pretty tough, maybe he’s just putting a lot of effort in to it? After all his best friend was shot at!” Peter nudged Tony’s leg at the best friend part. Tony smiled.
Tony stepped into the room, closing the door gently behind him. Peter’s room lay untouched since the day he left.
“Anthony.” Peggy smoothed out her skirt. Coughing into her fist, Tony watched her awkward behaviour with an air of distrust. “I must discuss something with you, urgently, I -“ Tony raised his hand and stopped the pen, effectively silencing his Aunt. “I already told you. I’m not Shield property and as I learned the hard way that’s the only way I get to see the people I call friends, so I’m done. You can come back Monday if it's one of those alternative Mondays. I don’t know yet I haven’t checked my schedule.” Peggy Carter was know for her stiff upper lip and she was not short of it now. She could see how Tony’s head could spin things, always having a reason as to way he wasn’t good enough for his friends or family, trust that could take years to build, gone in a single comment that Tony could justify just as quickly, no matter how much it hurt.
rather than your own friend!” Tony slammed his fist into the arm rest, fast and hard enough to cause Peggy to jump in her chair.
“I have to say pizza sound pretty good right now, hungry?”
“And T …Tony as well? He’s my best friend…” Steve stuttered out. Peter’s face softened, bottom lip opening slightly surprised that his Pop would have ever been this nervous.
Sam walked up to stand toe to toe with Tony, who had leaned his head up to allow Sam clear access to the collar of his crisp white shirt. Tony reached his arm round the back of Sam’s arm to grab the sandwich and chuck it at Thor, who grabbed it in his hands, raising it slightly in a cheers motion before taking a large bite. Sam, flipped the clip on the device and turned it around. “Seriously,
Steve pulled Tony’s body up to his face, crying into his chest. Tony finally woke up to the situation that Steve was dealing with, wrapping his arms as best as he could around the back of Steve’s head. Squeezing tightly in response to Tony’s grip, playing with the longer strands of blonde hair, pushing them out of Steve’s face.
other Steve, Nat, Clint and Peter to arrive at the front door, his glasses clocked that agents were in fact staring right at him but he just ignored them, he’d been here for thirty minutes or so, they could just mind their own damn business. Tony stood up as Peggy and Agent Coulson approached him, re-buttoning his maroon suit waist coat as he stood, he turned to face the two with a smile.
Tony shrugged, and Peter nodded, his eyes couldn’t stop wandering around the hall. Peter took a sip of the beer and tried not to screw up his face at the taste. His Dad had already halved his beer. Peter listened to his Uncle Rhodey and Tony discussed DUM-EE actions and his behaviours for today as Peter slowly worked his way through the beer.
The laughter died down, Steve finally took another bite of his noodles. “Not to sound rude Steve, but then how did you end up with Stark Jr in Boston? I thought they would put you straight into Shield training.” Natasha continued to chew her food loudly as she spoke?” Steve took another sip of his drink, loudly slurping from the straw. “Howard thought it would be good for me to go finish something I had start from the war, he thought art school was the easiest for me to ‘accept’, I think it was the easiest for him to fund.” Steve shuffled his entire body, unbuckling the sides of his boots, trying to get more comfortable on the hardwood flooring, he could really use a coffee right now.
simple conversation from turning into a fight for like three minutes.
Tony: Thanks.
"Well, I wanted to talk to you, actually," Tony said, mildly affronted.
Tony gave him an unnecessarily grateful look. “Yeah...” A pause. “Dammit, Cap. Together, you and I make for one semi-functional human being.” And then, with more of his usual confidence: “I’m
steps,
I compressed my lips in frustration with myself because I didn't know what to tell him without falling into trap of addressing my own Tony instead.
"You create a diversion, I'll grab the food, meet you at the fire escape."
This took him aback. He just stood there for a moment, blinking.
Tony rolled his eyes. "For the tenth time, I was high on adrenaline at the time. You can't take that seriously. Besides, if you'd come back earlier, maybe. As it is, I aged out of clubbing in the meantime. I had to get out before it got embarrassing."
, a bit earlier than it was supposed to. They had reached the tech deck, more or less. As expected, the grav field was all wrong. They found out about it as they climbed out and stood on baloonishly light and bouncy feet, on what used to be the ceiling. The corridor was empty. Apart from the

to anyone who knew how to listen.
Tony: Which...
Tony: Do you really think I would, like, rat you out? Really? After everything?
Sometimes, the darkness around him seemed the embodiment of his panic. When he was first brought here, it appeared dense, impenetrable; he could barely breathe for it. And then as the time passed, his eyes became accustomed to the gloom. He could now make out the shapes, not that there was much to make out around him. The walls, the blankets on the floor; there was a niche in the wall with a toilet bowl. The first thing Tony did after he got his bearings was to fix the flush tank. (It was easy – just reattaching the chain to the lift road; a child could have done it). Judging by touch only, he'd have said the thing was made in the...60s? Maybe 70s.
Steve didn't mention that the suit apparently had a leak. If Tony's air purifiers indeed became operational and he managed to put the fire out before something exploded, he should be just fine.
And seeing all of them, together like that, was as if the other half of his life slid into place, a missing piece he wouldn't let himself miss properly until it was already there, because it would have hurt too much otherwise.
," he responded, a tad testily, because it was probably a hallucination anyway, and why would he want to be nice to a hallucination? "I'm pretty sure you heard me the first time."
rescued the survivors from the wrecked ships, transferred most of the civilians to the two surviving crafts, and drafted the useful ones into service. And this was, incongruously, incomprehensibly, how he had ended up sleeping on a bunk bed above Justin Hammer of all people. This was how he had come to work a menial, mind-numbing maintenance job after the big repairs on
Steve could have listened to him happily for ages on end.
I nodded. "You saved all of us."
Something in my brain decided to interpret the last part of The Ancient One's question as a

Tony: So don't worry.

In Steve's throat, a frog squirmed. For a moment it was difficult to make a sound. "Yes?"
And Steve's arms around him made him feel almost like he was a part of a completely different world, a world that wasn't half so bad, a world you could actually make something of, if you tried. They were warm and solid and weren't letting go of him.
STARK: The truth is... we fuck up too. Just like everyone else. But our fuckups are more global and more visible and with much worse consequences. Lethal consequences. You're going to have to beep this out, right? Sorry about that. Anyway... We try to make right. We

That was what his

"Either you or Tony are going to make an ass out of yourselves, that much's for sure," she now informed Steve, "probably both of you. So try not to."  Seeing her social persona bothered Steve, so he welcomed the exaggerated eyeroll at Bucky's departure, as well as the sharp words. At least they were genuine.
you’d just take off down that slope and that would be it.” A pause. “Was that supposed to be some kind of... a test?”
The alarm in Steve's voice would have been at least somewhat hilarious if the situation had been different. "What
, for a moment he would glimpse emotions that weren't his, a sadness of the wrong brand, the memories of himself seen through a different pair of eyes.
And that was, somehow, enough.
It was his turn to get up on an elbow, look down into Steve’s closed-up face. Until recently, he never knew how much he’d missed that face, how painful the gush of sweetness could be when he just glanced at it. That’s why he’d never dared look too much, never too long. He’d  been stupid, stupid, stupid...
Tony: Steve? About the other night.
Still, Steve is upping the stakes, and Tony was never a one to fold. He steps
"What I mean to say is," Thor said, leaning forward, so that only Tony could hear, "when that happens, you need to recognize it." And then, abruptly louder: "I still cannot fathom that the fair lady was partial to the dauntless Captain Marvel, but would hardly even look at me twice. I am, after all, the deity of her ancestors; I should think I deserve some notice." This was just a tad too booming and convivial to be genuine. Thor's attempt at diverting attention, then; because, Tony saw, Peter was coming over – all knees and elbows and awkward angles in his fancy new suit Tony had helped him pick out. And Tony was suddenly grateful, whether to Thor for changing the subject or to little Pete for inducing the change, he couldn't be sure.
"Why aren't you in the car already? Get in the car," Tony semi-snapped. You'll freeze to death, he didn't say, you'll freeze to death and it will be my fault. Asshole.
THE END
, Tony thought. Everything. Even Barnes. He could learn to tolerate even the Bucky fucking Barnes. "Why the hell not?" He looked at Steve appreciatively. "I bagged the key player, after all. Everything else is less important." And then, as if there was any doubt left: "Steve, I love you."
Is that what the two of them are, though? Were they, ever?
The above/bellow thing on a gunstar class ship– on any modern spaceship – seemed skewed until you got used to it. The gravitation strips were installed in the deck floors in parallel lines, to avoid more amusing aspects of gravitation fields that, unfortunately enough, were spherical in shape. It would be impossible for a floor of one deck to act as a ceiling to the deck below, like in a normal building. In such a case, grav fields would overlap and people and things on the deck below would have an unfortunate tendency to gravitate towards ceilings. So, on a spaceship, the decks had to be set floor to floor or ceiling to ceiling. The pilots' accommodation and the tech deck/landing bay were ceiling to ceiling. And the tech deck itself was generally considered 'lowest', insomuch that it was right next to the lower hull itself, so that the access to the side engines would be easier. It didn't share a floor with another deck.
Tony: You don't have to tell me.
Tony: Okay.
Tony: Listen, I'd be happy to ignore the issue, but he's a big part of your life, obviously, and he's plainly important to you, so I'm asking, and there you go.
Tony: You there?
Steve might try.
A snort, that somehow didn’t sound too amused. “Nothing. You never showed up. So I left.” He fished one hand out from under the blankets and absently ran his fingers through Tony’s hair, just the once.
Tony: And we can learn to talk. I mean, I learned to water-ski when I was 32. I can learn this too. It’s not rocket science.
Tony: Why do we fall apart this easily, Steve?
The intensity of pure, cool relief that swept trough him took Tony aback for a second.
"Did you two love each other?" he asked in a very gentle voice.
The cleanup was already in progress. Everything seemed in order. Vipers, like overgrown birds, shaken and disheveled, weren't being tended to yet. They looked forlorn. In another time, another place, Tony would have wanted to go over, see how they were doing, see if they could be fixed. It had to be doable. He couldn't have lost the possibility to fly
Steve shrugged it off awkwardly. “I still mean what I said. Obviously, I can’t stop you, but...”
"...or threes, apparently" Tony finished.
.  For a millionth time he wished Steve was his to touch and hug and fuss over. To put his arms around his torso so that no one saw how badly his hands were shaking.
Tony: Okay, maybe not intentionally, but do you have any idea what you ignoring me does to me?
It occurred to him – later, too late – that the thing with the water was also inappropriate. Honestly, he didn't know what he was doing any more. He was going crazy.
took in survivors. There was suddenly enough techs for three full shifts, and the old common room was pitifully small.
"Go on, say it. What are you thinking?"
Tony may have lost some air. It was utterly due to the collision.
Fury snorted. "Don't give me that crap. Go, go, do your job. But keep this in mind, Rogers: I have 7 pilots dead, I have 8 pilots in the sick bay. I have 20 vipers onboard and only 5 pilots on active duty."
Neither of us had ever been particularly good at saying sorry, but I think this hug counted as something in that vein.
Tony: So obviously I can't sleep.
Tony took a long drink and shot Steve a curious look. "What did the others say? To all this?"
STARK: No. No, I cannot because there can absolutely be no comparison. Because, see...
Tony: You know, I can build a suit of armor in a fucking cave with like two pots, a pan, and a sharp stick, but I still have no idea how you can go and turn a piece of paper into art with just a pencil.

And he missed.

Steve was, however, busy at the moment, being wrapped in a giant bear hug of the Old Norse variant. Steve was probably the only one Thor could unleash the true force of his shoulder claps upon. Jesus Christ, Steve's back, his shoulder, the back of his neck, mildly pink with embarrassment. Tony never knew you could miss the way someone's neck met his meticulous hairline. It was so completely ridiculous.
Tony: not you

As he looked around the room, his eyes were piercing, vigorous. Still, whenever they lighted on Tony's face, all of a sudden they seemed set in stone. Tony could feel almost visceral dislike there, thinly covered up.

. "Whatever you think you know, forget it. Whatever you were in your previous lives – is irrelevant. You think you know something about flying? I need you to bury that notion. You were picked because I think you're able to learn. That's all. You are new cadets. You've no idea how to fly a viper. You've no idea how to fly

Steve laughed. "You
His earnestness was worryingly sweet. It was also very different from the way he conducted himself lately. It felt like a peace offering (not that they had been at war or anything). No, wait; it almost felt like something more. Tony stuffed a hand into a pocket and curled it into a fist because gritting his teeth would probably be impolite. „Nah. Nope. You know what, I don't mind the running at all. I think I'm going to keep at it. Indefinitely." Because, before, he'd kept telling himself he was just waiting for Cap to break and say
He didn't even drink all that
"Tony..." Natasha begins, and then he looks at me.
Sure enough, a fraction of a second later he did look back and he rose his eyebrows at Tony, as if in serene enquiry. It could have been absolutely nothing, of course it could have; Tony could have been imagining the whole exchange. But some kind of weird, dangerous curiosity inside him was piqued.
"Yeah," Tony whispered.
Tony gave him a tablet; he'd spent the night logging, writing down all he remembered about the dreams, as well as his measurements, BARF readings and speculations. "Read that and tell me what you think."
He smiled at that and acquiesced. I took his hand in mine – it was a bit smaller than my own, but wonderfully firm and warm and
"As you always do," Steve said. "I know. I know that, Tony."
This was when Tony spotted a green hand that tapped Rhodey's shoulder. Then his own upper arm found itself caught in a vice-like grip, and he was being turned around and then wrapped in a twiggy, branchy embrace. As soon as he was released, there was an insistent, none too gentle push against his thigh, and a furry hand being extended upwards for Tony to shake; and then Peter was pulling him into a one-armed hug, and then the throng of the others, and the hellos and the laughter and the chatter. Tony was happy to see them all, after almost a year, and
To answer that, he'd have needed some serious soul-searching. He never really tried. Facts were the facts and that was enough. He was now wondering when the kernel of his apparent feelings for Steve had been born.

Tony: Got pushed for today.
exact point in time onwards," he interrupted. "Yeah, I know, I'm figuring it out as I go, I just..." He rubbed his forehead, glistening with sweat.
"Yes?" There it was, back in Tony's voice; that tension.
And he wanted to. He was going to have to drive away and leave Steve here in an hour or two, and never ever mention to anyone he'd seen him, and all Tony wanted was to get to know him better.
"Yeah," he said sardonically, "you are right, because I'd absolutely sacrifice you in order to get myself out."
"The real thing?" Steve sounds confused now.
Tony: Steve.
He falls silent, takes an audible breath, but doesn't go on.
"If you'll have me, that is," I added.
Was that pathetic? Without a doubt it was.
“Nothing much. You feelin’ better?”
Tony: Over tech.
The ballroom seemed unbridgeable, and all that happened earlier felt like a distant dream.
“Because I didn’t know what comes next,” he hurried to get it out while the magic still worked, before he changed his mind. “It wasn’t about forgiveness any more, once we... well, once we sorta-talked about it. I simply didn’t know where to go from there. How do I proceed? How do we do this?” Tony heard his own words become more heated as they approached the core of the problem.
Tony: What did she say?
Tony: I know.
Tony let himself lean against Steve for a moment. "Nothing, just the old one, getting worse. Landed on the bad leg. I'll be fine."
"I'll go with you to a point. I suspect there will be some blockage." That made perfect sense, Tony thought. That's where the thumps had come from. "If we can clear the corridor, I'll continue to the lending bay. You go and try to fix the engines. Recruit anyone able on the way, to help you." They were
Tony sighed. "God, Steve, I missed you."
“I’m... cold from the inside,” Steve was saying. “Like... ice radiating outwards. From my spine. Like...” And nope, the distant look in his eyes was not good at all, and this line of thought had to be cut short.
"Tony, how's Scotty?" a concerned voice asked then, and Tony just about had the time to say, "Hey, Luis. He's fine, he's good, he sends his love," when Hammer absolutely had to surface from the throng of people and butt in.
feel like an alien nowadays. At least he was a free alien, here. At least he wasn't an experiment, again, and no one was using him.
He was gorgeous and it didn't matter, perhaps because Tony had talked to him before he saw him. Still, he knew one thing: he was going to do his best to protect this man.
"Yeah." And then, as an afterthought. "Hello, Tony."
He stepped forward, and Tony didn't step back, didn't pull away. Steve reached up, shy and gentle, touching Tony's hips again, his back. Tony
"Having in mind my opinions on the subject," I interrupted, "I went and fell in love with
"Gee, Steve, you shouldn't have asked so nicely." His voice was dry – and still hoarse – but he wasn't running away screaming at my almost-proposal, so I supposed it was something. And then his next line suddenly took me back to 2016, with a cold pang in my stomach. "Wanna see something cool?" he asked, and I flinched involuntarily.
our good Captain?" The others were joking loudly now, about one thing or another, and the two of them had an improbable moment to talk in peace. Tony didn't know if he liked the line of inquiry or not.
Tony huffed: "Fuck's sake, Rogers, I worked with them every day. What do you take me for?"
"He didn't hold it against you." That's the best I can come up with. Because I can't say
"No, listen, big guy..." Tony began, as the first thud resounded.
, with an alien army rushing through. No, we didn't invite them in. No, we didn't somehow attract them. We weren't even a team back then, we barely knew each other. We came together because we were needed, and because there wasn't anyone else. Two scientists, a soldier, two government agents... We...

"No," Nebula repeats, staring at Tony. "Not you."
Tony chuckled. "Oh, I bet those damn wounded are real whiners, aren't they."
"So you, ah, you didn't mean anything by it?" He forced the words out. He knew they sounded like he'd eaten a stick.
At Tony's grunt of protest at the delay, Steve started fumbling with the button. Impatiently, Tony pushed Steve's fingers away, unzipped himself, then started on Steve's belt, which was when the white haze behind Steve's eyes swallowed all thought.
, but mental-sanity-wise... not awesome."
. "Even you're not that clueless. Out with it. What did you really want to talk about?"
Tony: Except for tracking you down and arresting you, which, fyi, I could have done already if I'd wanted to.
The idea of just moving on, living on, had been unbearable after Tony's death. I'd already been trying to learn how to move on from my own past; it took me years. And at last I'd realized Tony was it; he was my way of embracing the future – or that was what my stupid, unreasonable heart wanted, at any rate. But that wasn't something that could have happened anyway, not in our universe. "And he died," I echoed my own thoughts. "And I was supposed to do it again, try to move on
Tony barked a laugh. "Holy hell, you've been watching

Tony: Yep.
"You were... tracking this organization?" Tony asked very carefully.
Dripping of the lube down his crack feels like a trail of ice. Steve closes his eyes reflexively. Steve shivers.
Tony died, and suddenly, there was nothing left for me there. It was the second time it had happened to me. I'd be able to appreciate the irony, perhaps, but I was busy disintegrating on the inside at the time.

He kisses Steve.
Tony: Me too, babe.
Still, it seemed a lightest touch on the elbow was enough to make Steve freeze in his tracks. "Tony?" His whisper was hoarse.
Too many feelings at once always make me want to step up and issue a challenge – to someone, to anyone, to the universe at large.
Uninvited, Tony's lips twisted up, too far. He wanted to turn it into a smirk, but it was too late.
Hope was relentless, the bastard. Just like Steve, it never knew how to stop.
"I've dealt with worse."
Tony: As you said yourself, he's your friend, eh.
And now he looked up as Tony was announced (
"I'm starting over," she declared, just like he knew she would.
"Yeah," Steve says. "Well, you know, maybe it's like that, even if we're talking about friendship. And I
Tony placed his hand into his pockets, playing with a little bit of lint nervously between his fingers. Howard took a slight step towards his wife. Peter watched as Howard and Tony stood side by side, appreciating the similarity of their posture. Peter shuffled slightly to stand in frame of the mirror across the room, comparing himself against his Dad and his Grandfather. He could spot similarities between all three of them, the shape of their hairline, the jawline and maybe their ears at a push.
“Howard, I told you he’s not here! Leave Peggy alone, she is probably busy!” The footsteps were fast approaching, and Tony froze. Howard was coming, and Tony has nowhere to hind and nowhere to run. Peter’s body froze as well, He’d never met Howard died before he was even born, and he never heard a good word about the man from his dad.
Steve watched Peggy’s car drive off down the road. He turned and made his way towards the large rusted doors of a shipping warehouse, Steve wasn’t all that surprised to see the old-style Stark Industries logo, that he had grown up with in the 30s and 40s, faded on the door. He placed his hand on the door to push it open, it hesitated for a second before a robotic voiced answered, “Welcome Captain Rogers.” The warehouse door opened fully to let Steve enter, he shouldn’t have been surprised when he saw the lush interior. A Howard Stark hide out, plush leather and velvet furniture everywhere, a fully stocked bar, a pool table, Howard’s grand oak desk and a workshop behind glass doors in the back corner.
“Come on Tony, time to go home.” Tony just nodded.
“I’d love to meet Jarvis! That would actually be awesome!” Tony smiled and took Peter by surprised by giving him a tight hug, “They’re going to love you Peter, I actually can’t wait,” The pair stepped apart, “We’re invited down when college breaks for Christmas, dinner when we arrive and then a cocktail hour… But lunch with the Jarvis family the next day, so bonus!” Tony was on cloud 9, he would get to show Jarvis that he raised him well, he didn’t screw his life up!
floor, voices called out.
“That’s your best nickname yet Barton. Let’s go” The pair turned to leave, Barton curling his fist to his chest with a ‘yes’. Peter Finally realised that Steve and Tony had been having a silent conversation since Steve was told to go out on a mission. He knew quite a bit of his dads’ secret language of the eyes, but he didn’t know everything yet. Yet, he knew enough to see the pair’s longing eyes, Tony mixed with determination, Steve’s mixed with hurt.
“Yes boss, they began the drying cycle ten minutes ago.”
even! Peter looked up to his Pops. Pop’s stood tall, watch the scene unfold, glancing down to his son he leaned down ever so slightly, whispering in Peter’s ear, “I just want to be clear, I have literally only ever loved your dad and I hope that at some point in your life, someone looks at you, the same way I look like a complete and utter idiot with your Dad.” Peter giggled, a
Once Howard cleared the corner, Maria turned her attention back to Steve, taking his chin in her hand, moving his head side to side, inspecting his appearance. She let out a quiet Hmm, but Steve could hear it. “No matter what my husband says or anyone else for that matter.” She took a small step back and whispered to him, “I beg you Captain, please do what you must to protect Tony.” Steve immediately nodded. “You must mean it Captain, I fear Howard’s ghost are catching up with him, and I do not want Tony caught up in the crossfire. He needs someone to look out for him.” Steve took her hand in his. “I promise Mrs Stark. Tony is my friend, I will do what I can.” Maria whispered a thank you.
“Kid, I don’t like seeing you … upset. This isn’t the way I would have wanted you to grow up. This is what happened to me, difficult situations and… no one to help when I needed them. I’ll help, Steve will definitely help and even if he didn’t want to, I would make him! And! Shield, they will help! Just … you’re not alone Peter.” Peter gripped Tony’s hand tightly, he was going to break his fingers if he wasn’t careful. Tears streaming down his face Peter used his jumper to clear them off his face.
“Captain Rogers, why is this relevant to your mission?” Peggy looked up to stare Steve in the face. “They were trying to manufacture Erskine serum.” Natasha looked over to Barton with a raised eyebrow, who just point towards Steve then expanded the distance between his hands grew in size. Natasha nodded her head as if she understood.
As she reached out to grab Steve’s wrist he stopped and turned on the spot, Peggy ran straight into Steve’s chest. Steve raised one eyebrow and looked down at Peggy. “Steve, I’m sorry, I’m so damn sorry.” Peggy wrapped her arms tight around Steve’s waist. He hesitated before wrapping his hands round her back. “Peter is somewhere in the mountains, I’ll get someone to get you all the intel.” Steve relaxed his muscles, “Peggy, just… promise me you’ll start answering to yourself. Pierce and his followers are not good for Shield. Fix it.” Steve pushed back slightly, “I need to find my son and take him home.” Peggy let out a tearful laugh. “If that is what it takes for you to forgive me then I promise I will do it.” She took a full step back and held Steve at arms length, looking up and down Steve’s appearance. “You’re finally looking as old as me!” Steve let out a huff, she laughed lightly, like a bird fluttering its wings, she vaguely motioned her hand over her face and chin, “The beard, it suits you.” Steve smirked, bolstered by the compliment, puffed up his chest.
“Sure” Peter walked across the ceiling opened the cupboard, and dropped two boxes down on the counter below. Tony was taking this extremely well, he was just glad that his son was healthy and had this under control, like it wasn’t killing him which was good and maybe he could make advancements in genetic mutation if he had the time.
Howard made his way through the house towards his wife, who was discussing dinner options with Ana. “Ana, glad to see you are well. I’ll take tea in the drawing room, thank you.” Howard walked through the kitchen down past the island, he was almost at his office to drop off his brief case when Maria called out. “Howard dear, please stop for just a second.”
Peter wanted to laugh, his Pop’s has never been good with new people. “I’m a new friend of Tony’s, my parents… are out the country so he offered to take care of me until I can go home…” Steve nodded in response, noting how he hesitated, Steve assumed the kid’s parents must be like Howard and Maria, withdrawn and unforgiving.
“Wing-head, come in Wing-head” the call came from Steve’s belt which had been abandoned on the table in the corner, the wooden table vibrated with the sound waves. They all turned their gaze towards the device, Steve let out a gently sigh. Clint, turned back to look at Steve, stabbing his fork down into his dinner to prepare another bite, “I thought communication devices weren’t allowed on Special Ops Mission?” It was a cheeky question, but Steve knew he was in the wrong to have the device with him, “I know, I know, Tony says its un-traceable and so far, that’s been true.”
Barton and Steve were discussing the details of the shooter as Peter and Tony walked over. Steve stood up as Peter approached, he purposely fronted up on Peter, “What the hell were you thinking kid? Do you have a death wish? If Barton hadn’t stepped in, you’d be dead.” Peter stood his ground. Glaring up at Steve, “I had it under control, besides I only got close to him to grab this.” Peter reached in to his pocket and pulled out the patch from the shooter’s arm. Opening his palm so the five of them could see it. Steve, Barton and Romanoff sucked in a breath. The patch showed 6 tendrils coming from the centre skull. Tony and Peter just shrugged at each other as the others shared a worried look. Barton looked at Steve for answers “Steve, if that’s … then they’re back…”
“Exactly!  Glad you understand young Nephew! There should be no adverse effects to your health when you return to the future time, you’ve not even noticed the advancement in time, so it is unlikely to be a problem upon your return!” Peter nodded slowly, strange feeling to know you are out of sync with the rest of the world. “Your parents are glad to hear you are well and are proud of your continued determination after such a long time for yourself. They wish to know how you are?”
“A message in case Peter can get Karen back on the servers.” Steve sat back up to let all of his Uncles and Aunts crowd around the screen, “Smart move Dr and Captain Stark. Hey Peter, got a new bow for you to try out, you just need to come back and get some wisdom from the old master Hawkeye!”
date with this person had gone well then, he’s not used to his Dad second guessing himself, it was strange.
Well, he tried not to let it show. “Cap, I know it could be a touchy subject and all but- “Steve turned towards Clint, “but you’re still going to ask.” Clint shrugged his shoulders at Steve, under his blanket cocoon. “-yeah, you knew Director Stark back when this whole thing started, was he always like this? Like did you not spend Christmas with them last year, what was that like?” Steve tried to relax his posture, trying not to let the question show the strain on his face. The fabric of the suit constricted round his back as he let his spin drop slightly. He rolled his tongue round the side of his cheek. He let out an exaggerated breath, letting his cheeks puff out. Stabbing his fork down into the noodles, twirling them round his fork.
Tony eyes flickered to
As the SUV pulled into the office’s underground car park Peter felt his spider sense tingle. He’d never forget what his Dad used to say when Pops was away, ‘an intelligence organisation that fears intelligence, is never good.’ He was going to have a killer headache after this. Escorted through the building and into a lift, the soft tones of elevator music played as Peter took a chance to glance at everyone, however, Steve was staring directly to him, and not a friendly stare. This was a Captain America stare. Tony was checking out the painting on the wall and nudged Steve’s elbow, enough to distract him from staring at Peter. Tony smiled and subtly pointed to the piece raised his eyebrows and just like that Peter watched Captain America and his Pops appear, Steve closed his eye, shook his head gently and let out a soft laugh at the print. Steve opened his eyes to look at Tony, who was trying not to laugh and looking straight ahead.
Steve coughed and decided to take advantage of his time with Mrs. Wilkinson, who lived two doors up stairs from his parents and was his old drama teacher. She gave him an A for his work. Let’s hope it paid off he thought to himself. Steve clicked his neck to the side, losing his gaze to a spider in the corner of the room, he let the tears just tip over the edge of his eyes. They needed to hold back the tears believably. “I’d forget? How would you explain Howard’s death to me? It was very public knowledge?” Pierce gave a depraved smirk. It left an uneasy feeling in Steve’s stomach. “We’ll figure it out. Don’t worry, you’ll be fine at the end of the day, You’re old Captain Rogers, Its not hard to explain the deaths of veterans in the modern world.” Steve accidentally let out an angered gruff and his upper lip twitched.
The journey to the science labs at MIT, Peter just took in the experience of watching his not, yet parents just talk about their lives over the last 5 months, he saw the ‘captain’ disappear, this guy was just a solider called Steve Rogers, coming home to best friend and catching up on what Tony has been studying and their crazy ex-neighbour. Watching a solider and his student best friend laugh and get excited at random moments when they are filled in about stories and gossip of their friends like Rhodey and his ‘girlfriends’.
The group smiled gently at the camera, unsure of what words are the most important to pass on. Thor however looked on to Barton’s words. “I have an idea of how to communicate to my young Nephew.” Thor walked back away from the group and shot up through the air and through the ceiling with a loud crash.
Tony just stood frozen, eyes wide shock. He stared into Peter’s face. Tony pushed off the wall and slowly moved towards Peter, who was near hysterical at this point. Tony took him into a hug against him. Tony just knew it. When the sensors went off this morning something big had come through the radiation energy detector, he knew it, he just knew it, but here was this kid, not much young than Tony on the floor in his apartment. From his future! He had a kid, who seemed smart and kind, probably due to his mother but who cared, he had a family, or at the very least someone who looked up to him.
. He could never have imagined how the two meeting would have gone but now, the dream played in his mind, Buck would have figured it out pretty quickly, probably taking some time to get use to the fact that his best friend was… openly gay. But he’d tease him about Tony and his long time crush, probably force him to hang out with Tony more, dress up in his Sunday best for just going to the movie. He’d hope that they would get along, Buck would likely have been irritated by Tony but would get use to him for Steve, he’d probably been the reason they’d have gone on at least a date.
Peter had never seen this look on his Pops before, this was anger. Raw hatred of something as evil as the devil himself. Pops was a religious man once, he used to say he’d never say a bad word with the fear the devil was listening in on him, This Steve Rogers looked like he was going to murder Howard where he stood and drag him to hell himself. The VIP treatment Howard deserved. Peggy stood between the two. “Howard that’s quite enough.”
“That kid is going to get himself killed chasing the shooter!” Steve struggled through the pain, while not life threatening it hurt like fucking hell. Steve tried to get up but wasn’t thinking straight when he tried to use his injured arm to get up, he yelped in pain and fell back down with Tony.
Clint peaked above the nearest desk, spotting a beat up blue pickup truck parked just at the corner of the hanger bay. Bingo! Clint quickly dropped back down behind the desk, using his sign language to inform Steve of his plan. Steve got it, they snuck up to the side of the truck, Steve pulled himself up and over the edge of the truck bed. Pulling a large tarp to cover himself, hiding under the shield to break up his human body shape. Clint snuck up and into the driver’s seat, poking around in the glove box and the sun-visor he found the keys to the truck. Looking in the back seat, Clint pulled forward a shield hat and jacket. Pulling the jacket on and zipping it up to cover the Hawkeye badge. Clint assessed the situation outside the truck, whispering down into his shoulder, knowing full well Steve could hear him.
‘Is that the kid’
Peter mirrored Natasha playful smile nodded, “I learned from the best. I can understand that but I don’t understand what I’ve done? Why me?” Natasha shrugged her shoulders. “I don’t know yet but we’ll find out soon. Enough chatting, let’s keep going, I’ll even let you cheat a little this time. Show me what the super serum does for you.” Natasha directed a punch towards Peter’s head, he dropped down to miss the punch. Reaching forward he quickly grabbed her fist, twisting her arms around to strain her arm but she flipped around to avoid the strain. Sweep kicking his legs out from under him. Peter jumped off the ground and planted his feet firmly on the tree is the small area he’d cracked with his back. Punching forward into Natasha, she fell back into a cartwheel and kicked Peter in the face with her boot.
“Goodnight Captain Rogers.” Peter gave a small wave to his Pop’s before leaving the room. “Goodnight Peter.” Steve said quietly to Peter who was out in the hallway. Steve watched the door shut and make a soft click noise, Steve removed the rest of his uniform slowly, after 3 months in the jungle
Peggy had sent the special ops team out to collect the kid, but it was made clear very quickly when they found two of the team unconscious and their tactical vest missing, that the kid had Shield training. Not unexpected of Steve to have the kid trained in case of kidnapping, she was surprised that Tony had agreed to such a high level of training, Steve was special operations at Level 9-11 combat training, Tony through his own hobbies was probably at level 3-5. Higher than he would ever need at a civilian level. But Peter, as far as the reports were coming in, was sitting near enough Level 11-13. He was taking out her highest-level operatives, he was ghost and he was seventeen. He shouldn’t be able to do this, she would need to get Steve and his team back soon to find the kid, but… that would mean telling them that the kid is alive.
“NO! Peter please don’t touch this! I don’t know what it will do, until I know I can bring you back safely, I don’t want you to touch this! Are you safe?! Are you with Shield, am I there?” Tony held his arm out, palm raised to stop Peter from walking forward towards him, a few tears in his own eyes. “Yeah Dad! I’m ok, you are taking care of me, we are in the compound of Shield right now… I’ll be ok, please… I just want to come home.” Peter stepped forward towards the crack, Peggy, Steve and Tony raising a cautionary hand to stop Peter from getting too close.
Tony wiggled his fingers in Steve’s tight grip, trying to release the tension that had set deep in his bones, it had been there since he’d ran Peter out the door but now, was he really ready to let it go? “Only.. If you consider forgiving Aunt Peggy. I know this whole thing is a real shit show but we don’t have than many friends between us to be honest, so let’s not lose anymore?”
closing files on his computer to prepare for leaving. Peggy gave a gentle smile to her godson, she stood behind Tony, reaching forward to give his shoulder a gentle grip of comfort, letting him know that he wasn’t doing this alone.
I'm back! Thank you for waiting so long, I was in for minor planned surgery and all went well so it was time to release this chapter!
The pair quietly made their way along the stone trial for the next 30 minutes or so, the sound of a quiet world not yet awake, this would be her last day alive, Peter trusted her enough to let out a whistle. She turned to him with a curious glance as he closed his eyes. She was impressed that he had enough spatial awareness, to walk in on a rocky terrain with his eyes closed.
to determine that he, Peter and Tony were moving after they got home. If he had anything to do with it they’d be moving either back to his apartment or they’re buying a house outside the city. This was no place for a kid to grow up and if
“So this place is quite different once you’re living here?” Steve realised they were reaching the main entrance of the compound, “Well far less soldiers and scientists about, that’s for sure.” Peter muttered back.
Shit, she knew.
“Oh…” Peter didn’t know what to say but Natasha had a plan. “Peter we need to get you and Tony in front of Steve as soon as possible, the sooner he realises that you two are alive, he’ll stop his stupid death wish.” She shuffled onto the couch further back, so that she could relax. Taking Peter’s hand in her’s, she pulled him up and on to the couch with her. He settled in to her side, relaxing in his aunt’s rare but unique maternal instinct. “For now, we are going to relax for the rest of the day and then come up with a plan to get to New York undetected.” Peter nodded into her side, he needed a day to rest, he’d been hiking up hill for three days.
“You’re Alive Tony!? You’re actually alive!” Steve super-hearing could hear the excited beats of Tony’s heart in his chest, “You’re Alive!”
She had fucked up. Not something she would ever be proud of but her judgement in her leadership and colleagues had been swayed this morning by the arrival of one Steve G. Stark. Who had fallen in love with her godson sitting across from her, this bitter but ultimately lonely boy and love him so much to start a family with arguably a sweeter kid than Tony when he was younger.
Peter smiled at Thor. “Its December 1991, can you ask my Pops for me how he is? I miss him…” Simple and to the point, Thor came back quickly, “Peter your father insists you be careful and do not go—” Thor disappeared.
in some incidences to make it clearer whose who!
Steve nodded, a wide grin on his face, “Thank you!” He swung his leg round to take the open stairs a few with each lung at the time, “Steve!” He stopped turning on his feet to look down at Tony, “Just …” He turned back to Peter’s Pops, staying connected with him as he spoke with conviction. “Just remember, I won’t believe you.” Steve frowned, confused at the statement but Peter and
“Howard!” He called out loudly as he shut the door behind him. “Steve!” A surprisingly happy Howard made his way out of the workshop doors, shirt sleeves rolled up to his elbows, a grease stain on the front pocket. Howard lifted the googles he’d been wearing up off his face, on to the top of his head. “Glad you made it back in one piece!  Can I fix you a drink?” Howard clearly wasn’t perceptive enough to spot the blood-soaked combat trousers he was wearing. Steve met Howard halfway at the bar, Steve shook his head as he sat on one of the stools. Howard pulled out a whisky decanter, pouring himself a glass. “Thanks, but no thanks I’ll take water.” Steve sat the shield down by the side of the bar. “Alright then.” Howard sat a water in front of Steve, who gladly took two large gulps of the water. “I called you here to discussion options with you.”
“I’m just happy to see you Thor, is Pops ok? I didn’t get to see him much before the anomaly shut. How did you even get here?” Peter was standing in front of his, Uncle the fabrics of his Uncle’s cap blowing in the invisible wind, the distinct smell of home surrounded him, a mixture of engine oil, a hint of the fresh forest air that surrounds the compound and chalk dust from his Pop’s boxing ring.
Tony sat legs stretched out in front of him, relaxing on a bench in front of the atrium’s fountain, playing on his phone, waiting for
The room was spacious a bonus for this modern era, but costly, heating the apartment with gas in the 40’s was a costly business and one Steve’s mom couldn’t always afford. Now the room had a large comfortable bed placed in the middle of the wall, bought by Tony, directly under the large window that ran the length of the wall. With rewiring, fresh plasterboard and paint the room became liveable and actually quite nice in Steve’s opinion. The wall the bed lay against was a deep navy colour, the other 3 a light grey. Some of his father’s drawing were framed and place around the room, on top of the dresser, hung on the wall and sitting on the bedside table, it was a nice touch from Tony.
Back again! Sorry this took a bit longer than initially planned but I'm glad you are all enjoying the story so far! See you in the next chapter! x
“My Tony, doesn’t quite agree with the beard but I think i’ll leave the decision up to Peter.” Steve rubbed his hand through the beard and up from his neck. “Peter is an amazing kid Steve. He’s been quite a force to be reckoned with during his time here.” Steve small smile left his face, “Unfortunately, he’s been here longer than we’d like. Not a lot of support for him here.” Peggy nodded, guilt eating away at her composure, “I’m so sorry Steve, we should have kept him here, we shouldn’t have let him out of this place, then he might not have run away and we’d have noticed-” Steve shook his head, cutting her off he pulled Peggy in for a tight hug, his arms fully engulfing the smaller women.
Rhodey glared at the oversized, idiotic, absolutely useless bouncer. “For the last time. I am Tony Stark’s friend. I am here, right now. To take him home. So let me through.” The bouncer just let out a gruff of air from the side of his mouth. Rhodey was not amused. He’d been hanging around outside Grande Errore Club for the past forty minutes or so, Tony had texted him begging him to come save him from himself. Usually he would have played this off as Tony trying to get him to join him on a night out, the classic, ‘well, you’re here now Rhodey, so you might as well stay!’
Steve leant back slightly, his legs out stretched in front of him, a bend in the knees to form a slight V. Peter sat in his Pop’s lap, looking up at him as he pulled back slightly, the pair grinning at each other, giving small but ecstatic bursts of laughter. “Hey Petey,” Steve finally broke the silence between them, “Hey Pops.” Peter let the tears flow freely down his face, his Pops had grown his beard back, his arm no longer in a cast and sling, his hair slightly longer, enough to push back into a soft wave.
“Yeah, well, fell out with the old man… again… I have like the million dollar account there if I need it but, like I’ve never really had to struggle away from Howard so, Steve encouraged me to ditch the flat in the city, try my hand at actual student living, and yeah it’s nicer than any other student has but it’s mine and Howard doesn’t know where it is… so bonus. I guess he does now, Steve has probably told him already…” Tony sighed and turned to take the cleaning cloth from Peter’s hand, Tony was proud of himself for at least for having a space away from the name Stark, on those nights where it was just him and Steve in the flat, trying to stay warm and having dinner around candle lights before Tony had fixed the wiring of the flat. (he broke it in the first place so it’s only fair) “Anyway, Whose your family like brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, like I already know ‘Uncle Rhodey’ which I’m super glad about, what about Uncle Stane or Uncle Robertson?” Peter raised his shoulders at the last two, he’d never heard of those two before.
“Hi Aunt Peggy!” Tony beamed. There stood Director Carter of Shield, stood prim and proper at the door of her godson’s student apartment in a tailored skirt and suit. Oh, and the 6 or so Shield body guards who were armed standing around her.
“Which reminds me, I need to head and see my family. So I’ll be back tomorrow morning for training then!  Borrowing the jet Tony, thanks ill bring it back tomorrow! Full tank of fuel. Gotta go now bye!” Clint rushed out the last sentence as he jumped back into the elevator.
kicked the duvet out from under his torso. Once Peter realised what his parents were doing, he reach above his head to the headboard, sticking to it with his finger tips, he lifted his body off the bed.
An amazed smile appeared on Tony’s face. “Wicked! So not genetics but mutation, interesting, has your stamina increased, metabolism, regenerative cells, kid you’ve got to let me test you blood!”
That was going to be fun.
“I met Tony because Cadet Rhodes was assigned to help me get around answers any questions, he was. Tony knew I was around because of Rhodes, so he walked in before his dad showed up once at our weekly dinner, he asked if I wanted to go eat like a real student, for whatever reason I said yes, ditched Howard, and Tony was just … he didn’t treat me like I was some 40s veteran, he actually called me stupid for believing Howard’s nonsense. We ate at this diner on campus. Became instant friends.” Steve got up, quickly grabbing three sleeping bags from the corner of the room and placing them in front of the fire to heat them up.
“Thanks.” The bouncer stepped to the side lifting the velvet rope. Rhodey smiled as he walked by and desperately held back the extremely manly whin of pain as the bouncer shoulder budged him. Rhodey could hear the anger call of harassment from those who had been waiting in line for a while as he made his way up the stairs. Rhodey was greeted by the familiar wall of noise and stench of beer as he made his way past the cloakroom window. “Cadet Rhodes!” Rhodey turned to find the person yelling his name. Ah. A manager, never a good start. Rhodey nodded and shook the sweaty hand of the quiet stressed looking man. “Cadet Rhodes are you here to collect Mister Stark?”
“Son of a bitch! That stings.” Steve gritted through his teeth, Natasha rolled further away from Steve, crouching with her back against the wall, she glances between Barton, Steve and the window. “He has a clear shot on Steve why isn’t he shooting?” Barton shrugged his shoulders. Steve used his upper arm strength to pull himself through to the living room. Twisting his body round so that he could sit up right with his back against the wall. He gripped his leg with both hands, he let the back of his head hit the wall with a loud thud. A bullet ripped through the wall next to Steve. Missing his body by a couple of inches, lodging itself into the dark oak floorboards.
“Peter is leaving tomorrow?” Tony let out quietly. “Yes, his father would like you to be there to say goodbye and sorry to Peter.” Tony looked up form his desk his eyes comically wide. “Sorry?! For what? That kid, my kid didn’t even warn me I was going to lose my parents! He stood by as I said goodbye to my parents and then what! I broke down and he left me alone!” Tony stopped himself, unclenching his fist on the desk, his eyes glazing over. “I’m beyond sorry that I’m that poor kid’s dad but I can’t fix that.” Tony was quiet. He stood up and quickly looked out the floor to ceiling windows over the fountain in the middle of the complex. He coughed to hide his dry throat.
