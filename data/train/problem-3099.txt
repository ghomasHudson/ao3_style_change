He can’t go through that again. He doesn’t think he would survive another attack such as Alastair committed against him.
“You’re dating Dean Winchester?” She asks again and Cas wants to melt into the floor for telling her they were on a date.
He risks a glance to the green-eyed man and isn’t surprised to find those eyes trained on him. Dean stares as if Castiel is a puzzle to solve. Cas musters his bravery and arches a questioning brow. Dean gives him a curt nod with his lips still set in a fine line. Cas has no idea what to make of Dean’s behavior.
Cas sighs again. “Airfare is a little different than a date, Dean.”
Two weeks later...
Cas takes Sam’s distraction as an opportunity to jog away from the clearing in the same direction Dean had headed.
Dean swallows hard and turns, catching the almost yellow eyes of his cousin standing with a knife to Benny’s throat.
“What happened?” Sam asks, looking at Cas for an answer but he still glances at Benny for confirmation.
Dean’s stomach lurches painfully and his eyes burn with righteous fury as he digs the tip of the sword against Alastair’s pale flesh.
They fall still, panting and Cas can feel the man’s hammering heart against his back and he swallows hard, blinking the sweat from his watery eyes.
Thoughts? Questions? Concerns? I'd love to hear from you.
As suspected, a still steaming mug of coffee is sitting on his coaster just out of arms reach. “I fuckin love you, Cas” Dean mutters as he reaches for the sweet nectar of the gods and sighs as he takes his first sip. For all the trouble they had teaching Cas how to use the coffee maker and despite him still approaching the coffee maker like he would an enemy in battle, the Angel can make a fantastic pot of coffee.
Monsters.
Benny nods with a frown. “That smarmy bastard came up with it and somehow it stuck.”
“Hey! What’s going on here!” A strange voice calls out behind them and Cas startles as Dean spins. “Steve, this asshole giving you trouble?”
, Cas and I’d be damn happy to call you mine in front of everybody.”
“Your brother did this?” Dean questions, his voice wooden. He’s torn between apologizing for Cole’s actions and screaming his outrage about the craft herpes infection he’s been saddled with.
Now he knows where Missy has gotten her propensity for hugging and he strangely doesn’t mind.
“Uncultured swine like me? Nope.” Dean pulls out onto the road.
She shakes her head and grumbles under her breath as she reaches for the stack of papers. Cas’ heart lurches, thinking he’s failed and she isn’t going to let him meet Dean. He glances out the window, noticing the SUV with the blacked-out windows idling on the curb and he imagines Dean is inside, watching him and Charlie through the window. “One last chance.”
The hunt for Witches doesn't go exactly as planned and Dean feels Castiel is entirely to blame. Sam makes the wise decision to make himself scarce when Dean finally confronts his Angel.
Judging by the way she only has eyes for Dean, she doesn’t care about their brotherly bickering.
Cas flinches and pulls his wrist away with a hard swallow but he firms his jaw defiantly and glares as Dean closes his eyes and tries to regain his calm.
“Is that…” Cas trails off, gaze fixated on the white tissue clutched in her hand, now mottled with bright spots of red.
Sam and Castiel simultaneously protest Dean’s words, demanding that he not sell himself short and then the two regard each other with soft smiles while Dean’s cheeks redden with embarrassment.
They can fight together.
Dean pulls back first and Cas’ breath catches as he takes in Dean’s soft smile and unfocused gaze.
Cas closes his eyes and tries not to groan even as he allows himself to nod. “Dean is very sweet.”
The morning passes quickly as Cas, Dean, and Sam get the back yard ready for the crowd that will be showing up early in the afternoon. By the time they’re finished, the yard is mowed and gardens weeded, chairs are set up around the fire pit in the corner and coolers are filled with ice and various drinks under the awning of the house.
Eventually, Cas pulls back and stares deep into Dean’s soul. “I know. Dean, I know you were a Saxon. I’ve known since the first night,” Cas says and Dean’s heart stills in his chest.
Cas stands alone for a moment and swallows hard as his heart hammers wildly in his chest.
to kiss that bead of sweat away as it rolls over the stubbled skin. He leans forward and mouths over the sharp cut of Dean’s jaw and down his throat as he bucks into Dean’s hand, chasing the peak of pleasure that he’s steadily climbing toward.
Meg nods knowingly and Cas squirms in his seat.
“Wash!” Dean calls out as he turns to face Castiel and Cas’ cheeks heat painfully at the sight. He crouches in the stream and cups water in his hands to let spill over his nude form, scrubbing with his hands as he goes.
“It’ll be okay,” Dean murmurs as they sway before he pulls back with a gentle pat to her shoulder. “Just ease up a bit, okay?”
Cas looks to Dean and gives him a half-smile. “I need to…” Cas doesn’t need to finish before Dean begins nodding and releases his hand.
Dean shakes his head and forces himself to his feet so he can dress without the astonishingly sexy display of him floundering around the bed like an ailing squid as he tugs his underwear up his legs while sitting.
Cas drops petulantly to the ground with a wince when Dean presses his shoulder down and Dean crouches in front of him. “Are you hungry?” Dean asks, only to find himself on the receiving end of a puzzled and hate-filled look. Dean sighs and shakes his head. “Food? Eat?” Dean speaks but Cas only narrows his eyes in a glare. “Do you want food?” Dean says, this time miming the motion of putting food in his mouth and chewing before rubbing his stomach.
seems fitting, considering, and Cas is more than content to just ride.
Reads the headline and Cas grimaces.
And he isn’t really sure if it’s to protect Dean or himself.
“Dean,” Cas whimpers on a shaky breath as his muscles flex. “Please.”
“Just look at yourself” Cas mutters, eyes fixated on the way the pain and pleasure flit over Dean’s features in equal measure, each groan punctuated with a grimace that smooths into peaceful bliss. By the time Cas gets to ten, Dean has dropped onto his elbows and his head hangs low. Cas strokes the reddened flesh carefully and Dean whimpers at the light touches.
Dean half whines when Cas lets out a short laugh.
Benny’s testimony will be damning.
His hands are over the button of his jeans when he completes the turn and he bites his bottom lip seductively as his fingers slowly pry the button loose. He tilts his head back, baring the long column of his throat as he slides the zipper down tortuously slow, waiting until he hears a whimper from Castiel before peeling his jeans open and pulling them down just enough to reveal that forest green lace underneath.
Read the beginning notes for a slight warning.
Dean’s eyes watch Cas’ expression carefully for signs of displeasure, but he finds none and deems this safe to continue. He tightens his lips and hums loudly, knowing Cas can’t hear him but he will certainly be able to feel the vibrations. He reaches up to pinch and tug as Cas’ nipples and the man arches into the touch while Dean’s cock demands attention.
Dean couldn’t stand to know what Cas is going without to pay for his meal, or what Cas might have done to earn the extra money.
“I haven’t.” Cas shakes his head sadly as they join the rest of their team.
Really, he ought to know better.
With Gabe at the helm, they’re in for one hell of a night.
His heart calms as they lay together, Dean warm and soft in his arms, and everything feels right with the world.
Dean flushes crimson and he turns in Cas’ arms to take in the sight of his mom with her hands held over her mouth and her eyes glowing with excitement.
The werewolf hunt went perfectly. Turns out, the first victim’s Uncle was the culprit. Cas suspected him immediately, claiming there was something wrong with his soul. The Angel couldn’t tell exactly what just by looking at the man, but his assertion was enough to cause Dean and Sam to take a closer look.
Now though? The appeal has worn off and he just feels used.
Which means he’s running out of time.
“Screw’em. I don’t care what they think. Charlie says it's up to us how we want to handle our relationship,” Dean’s voice is confident and Cas can’t help but smile softly. “So what do you say? Come out to New York and stay with me, please?”
Dean remains mute and follows Castiel, likely dumbfounded and confused but Cas isn’t above using that surprise to his advantage.
“Sleep, Cas,” Dean forces himself to say as he gestures toward the pile of furs in front of his fireplace that has become Cas’ bed.
“It’s a bat, Cas, no one cares about its gender.” Dean sucks in a deep breath and shakes his head before pinching the bridge of his nose. “Listen, I’m gonna put some boxers on. Standing here with my dick hanging out is just getting weird. You figure out what you want to do about this.” He pushes to his feet and waves his hand absently toward the blanket covered bat.
“You knew Dean’s dad?” Cas voice comes out as a bare squeak. He knew Rufus served but he never would have guessed that his mentor would have known his soulmates family.
Mary jumps and flicks the mixer off as Dean takes a step back with a grin. “You startled me,” she says as she places a hand over her heart with a smile.
His mind somersaults and reels at the feeling of Dean holding him so tenderly, consuming him and he can’t help the sudden tension that has his shoulders drawing back and his spine stiffening when he remembers that he needs to be cautious.
“Cas,” Dean says quietly, nudging Cas’ chin to try to get him to look.
He doesn’t have the will to argue. He
Dean pulls away from Cas, sitting up straight and pretending everything is perfectly fine. Because it is. No matter that Cas is now starting at him with wide eyes and slightly parted lips.
Dean turns as slowly as he dares, keeping his gaze downward to avoid the disappointment he knows must be written across Castiel’s features. “I’m sorry” He mumbles, feeling the guilt of ruining this for Cas sinking in his stomach like a stone.
“Dean,” Cas interrupts tiredly.
Cas quirks a brow with a smirk. “You just did.”
“Cas,” Dean says as he places a hand on Castiel’s shoulder and ruins the peaceful illusion. “Clean,” Dean mutters as he drags his fingers across Castiel’s shoulder to his chin before guiding Castiel’s gaze from the river to meet Dean’s eyes.
Charlie and Benny arrive about the time Sam is emerging from the house, shortly followed by Mary and a duly chastised John.
Dean follows the wet trail left behind by Castiel’s tears with the tip of the blade before dragging the sharp point across the Angel’s lips. Cas trembles in his bindings, unable to see or hear what Dean is doing and unable to speak. Dean wants to hear his Angel scream.
He gives himself a couple of quick stokes before tugging Dean’s ass cheeks apart to stare down at his needy hole, ready and waiting for him to thrust inside.
“Fuck, that was perfect.” The man pulls out and rips off the condom, leaving Cas curled on the concrete as he tucks himself back into his pants. “Hey, you okay?” He crouches down and his brows furrow as he takes in Cas’ tear-streaked face.
“Maybe put pants on first. I don’t know about you, but I don’t think I would want to talk to Sammy when I’m bare ass naked,” Dean shifts again to get more comfortable and ends up stuffing a pillow behind his back when he fails.
Dean drapes an arm over Castiel’s waist, holding him close. “You have me” His lips find Castiel’s and they work together languidly, each reminding the other of their solid presence until Castiel shudders against Dean. “Cas?”
“Dean, please,” Cas sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose, willing this conversation to end. Gabriel would be nothing but ashamed of what he’s become. Worse yet, Gabriel would be hurt that Cas didn’t ask him for help when he got sick. All those weeks in the hospital, alone, because he wouldn’t tell the staff how to contact his next of kin.
“What now, Gabe?” Cas asks breathlessly as he hurries to keep up. For being shorter, Gabriel can be quick when he wants to be.
“Alright man. We’re all set here. Sorry it took so long, I know you’re on a schedule. I’ll send Dean right in.” Charlie tucks all her papers away and drops her empty cup off at the counter on her way out the door.
“Gabriel,” Gabriel says with just a shade too much cheer as his eyes drag over the easy way they fit together and Castiel does not miss the way his eyes narrow at the sight of his hand covering Dean’s.
for me,” his voice falters and he scrubs at his eyes. “I’m so sorry I left, Dean. I was too afraid to call, too afraid of disappointing you.” He sniffles and Dean finally looks up to meet Sam’s watering eyes. “I’m so sorry.”
And Cas would prefer to avoid both of those options.
Gabriel was purposefully not told.
Once outside, Cas fishes in Dean’s pocket for the keys. “I’m driving, you rest,” he says as he opens the passenger door for Dean.
Alfie nods and flinches a smile. “Thank you, Professor. I, I ought to be getting to my next class.”
Charlie nods and wipes an invisible tear from her eye. “Right.” She nods. “Sorry about all that, Cas. Didn’t mean for you to get involved with our crap.”
The stars sparkle above him since he light pollution from the city doesn’t make it out as far as Bobby’s house and for the first time since he promised himself to get sober, he feels like he’s going to make it.
If she wants Cas to fill the role of guest and be excused from dish duty, then he is not going to protest.
“He...” Dean starts but lets his words trail off, realizing how much he doesn’t want to tell Cas about what Sam had said. What Sam had very nearly accused Castiel of doing. “He’s sick of being mentally scarred by us” He chooses to snicker instead, shaking his head as if mocking his brother.
“Are you ready?” Cas asks despite the way Dean pushes back to meet him.
“Nut up, Winchester,” Dean grumbles to himself. Pining after someone he barely knows because he’s so desperate for a friend is somewhere he never imagined he would be.
Cas sighs as he returns Dean’s embrace and pulls his closer. “Thank you for inviting me,” Cas mutters, hesitant to break the quiet they’ve found themselves in.
Dean nods, feeling more exposed than he would like but he will not ashamed to admit that Cas has come to mean something more to him. “What does this have to do with Virgil?”
He’s in Dean’s bed because Dean wants him here. Because
Cas lets Dean heave him to his feet with a soft grunt and meanders toward the bed without meeting his eyes. The mattress shifts when Dean settles next to him but he doesn’t touch, he simply gives Cas the time he needs to collect his thoughts.
Finally, the man plunges in roughly as deep as he’ll go and stills. Cas can feel him pulsing inside the condom and he takes a shuddering breath as he tries to calm down.
“Dean!” Cas tugs the robe closed and ignores the way the soft cotton feels like sandpaper over his scorched shoulders. “You will not.”
They eat and drink well into the night. Cas’ smiles come easier and the space between them grows smaller while Dean does his best to teach Cas various words. He identifies items in the room and the light in Cas’ eyes grows with each new word learned.
“Cas, babe, come on. Let’s go sit and wait for the police,” Dean whispers reassuringly, the phone still pressed to one ear as he grasps Cas’s elbow.
“You should have seen your face!” Dean grins as they make their way to the counter.
Dean only shrugs and allows Cas to stew in his anger as the days drag on.
He has done nothing wrong.
Cas hums and wraps his arms around Dean’s waist as he buries his nose in the crook of Dean’s neck. “I didn’t think you’d be like this,” Cas mumbles tiredly.
Yet here he is, barely hanging on every time he gets a little bit stressed.
“Oh please, you act all demure and he’s practically drooling.” Gabe rolls his eyes and gestures toward the outer door.
Dean’s heart flutters despite how he tries to squash the feeling and he finds himself nodding against his internal better judgment. “Okay.” The word feels like sand in his mouth. He shouldn’t. He should stay far away from his very human neighbor and keep to himself. Those piercing blue eyes can only mean trouble.
“Uh-huh...” Dean rolls his eyes and holds his hand out to collect Cas’ putter. He sets them both on the return rack and reaches for Cas’ hand in almost the same motion.
“Really, Cas? Really?” Dean gripes but the smile on his face only grows.
It flicks its tail and continues to chatter, not moving an inch.
His heart hammers harder as his feet begin to carry him toward the edge of the settlement. The forest lies beyond and surely there is freedom to be found beyond that.
“Please what?” Cas smirks and Dean groans.
A few weeks ago, he was resigned to selling himself for the foreseeable future. Now, with Meg’s pestering and Dean’s earnest offer of help, the thought of spending every night standing in that alley eats away just a little bit more of his soul. He’d much rather work his fingers to the bone during the day and be able to crawl into bed next to Dean at night.
Cas quirks a brow and continues his determined touch, loosely wrapping his fingers around the base of Dean’s cock and stroking upward. “Are you certain about that?” He teases, tightening his grip as he moves.
“I, what?” Cas looks absolutely confused and ten times more adorable than usual.
His nimble fingers reach between them and tug at the button of Dean’s jeans.
He’d rather be someone his brother wouldn’t be ashamed of.
Cas wishes he could say the same, but he’s glad for Dean’s offer nonetheless.
Gabe shakes his head before turning to Cas. “Get off your knees, Cassie. You know he isn’t a Prince anymore,” Gabe says with a nearly audible eyeroll. “And you,” Gabe says as he turns his attention back to Dean. “You
Dean’s cockhead catches on Castiel’s rim as the hunter slows his punishing pace and Castiel keens at the feeling, needing Dean to push back inside. “Dean” He chokes out in a sob, arching his back and pushing his hips upward to draw Dean back in.
Gadreel’s words of Metatron’s betrayal repeat in his head and he cannot help the connections he sees between Azazel and Lilith that extend to Ruby.
Dean flashes a smile. “No worries.”
Castiel’s muscles clench and roll when the hot wax dribbles across his stomach and his eyes slide closed when Dean runs light fingertips in the space between the trails of hardening wax. His cock strains for attention, twitching with each new addition of delicate heat from the wax and Dean stares entranced at the way Castiel moves and whimpers with each touch.
The look that countered every doubt about bringing an omega into a den of violent alphas.
Cas pulls his hand back and adds a second finger, twisting and scissoring his way back to Dean’s prostate where begin pressing and rubbing in circles against the sensitive little bump. Dean shivers and struggles to hold still, breath coming in ragged gasps as Cas works his prostate, hard.
His regular flinches a half smile and rubs the back of his neck as his cheeks redden before reaching for his wallet again. “That was weird, wasn’t it? I’m sorry if I crossed any lines…”
Cas is tired. So tired. The morning had gone so well, the concert had gone so well. Now, Dean is standing beside him, hovering defensively while still sweaty in his stage outfit while confronting a brother he never thought he’d see again.
“Cas, sit,” Dean says, pointing to the large table in the room.
Cas can
Dean’s thick fingers toy with the tiny paper umbrella, a bright blue one that contrasts beautifully against the pale peach of his drink. “I always loved these things when I was a kid.”
She isn’t expecting him to resist and she stumbles back with a bitten off snarl but the dangerous gleam in her blue eyes only grows stronger.
Dean learns that Cas has three big brothers, one of which is estranged, and the other two are as close to polar opposites as can be.
Castiel hums and drags feather light fingertips along the base of Dean’s spine, tracing the crack of his ass. “Thank you”
“I was hoping you’d have time to spar with me,” Dean says as he comes to a halt.
“That’s okay baby, I’ll find somewhere to show you off.” Cas lets him up and Dean nearly sputters. He always knows just how far to push, he can read Dean so well and that simple fact causes another spike of arousal deep in Dean’s stomach.
Jess rolls her eyes. “It’s only an hour. I’ll drive if you’re too tired.” She pokes in the ribs with a soft smile and Sam readily wraps his arm over her shoulders.
“Dean,” Cas says softly and his tongue darts out to moisten his lips. He doesn’t miss how Dean’s eyes track the motion and Cas wants little more than to lean forward and close the space between them until he’s nearly blinded by a bright flash of light.
Dean swoops down to claim his lips before Cas can think too deeply on exactly how blind love is, and to be honest, he doesn’t care. Not when Dean’s pillow-soft lips are moving against his, pouring emotion between them and dragging him so high into the clouds that he might never land.
Cas turns to watch him go with a laugh. “I swear, I wasn’t saying anything…”
“There has to be something I can do for you,” Cas says even though he knows there really isn’t. He’s been working as hard as he can to earn enough to support them and he’s reached his wit's end.
The wall is hard against Dean’s back but he’s content to let Cas pin him there. Frantic hands wander, clever fingers finding their way under the hem of his shirt until Cas is raking his blunt nails down his sides and around his hips. “Please, Cas,” Dean whimpers, not sure what he’s asking but he knows that he needs something more.
“No, I’m doing this.” Cas swallows hard. “Call him.”
“Dean, I... I’m sorry,” Cas offers, stepping forward just enough to enter Dean’s line of sight.
Kinks aren’t first date material, right? Dean quickly decides that even if kinks could be discussed this early, right now isn’t the time. Not when they’re on the way to see Dean’s
It was heaven and Cas wants little more than to have it back.
Dean takes the box, staring at the slim black case with deep suspicion. He turns his back to Cas, wanting a moment of privacy as he lifts the lid and peers inside. His heart skips a beat when his gaze lands on the deep green of delicate lace. He pinches the item between two fingers and lifts it from the box, staring with wide eyes. His mouth goes dry and his heart races painfully. The panties are beautiful, the green matches his eyes perfectly and Cas can’t possibly be serious…can he?
“You want a beer, Sammy?” Dean asks as Sam drops into one of the comfortable Adirondack chairs on the deck.
Cas sucks in a breath and his eyes widen at Dean’s sudden change of tone and posture. He would love nothing more than to refuse the man but the hunger gnawing at his gut and Benny’s pleading gaze soften the edges of his ire.
They walk in silence, Cas’ hands still pinned behind his back, but he doesn’t bother to struggle. He would be no match for a warrior like Benny.
Dean had a bruise on his arm for a week from Charlie’s wrath at not being allowed to plan something spectacular like he had promised her.
“Is that blood?” Dean swallows hard. The renewed pounding of his heart tells him that he already knows the answer, but he refuses to believe it until he hears the words from Castiel’s mouth.
Finally, those blue eyes surrounded by that black mask open and lock with Dean’s. “Feel so good Dean” His voice is pure gravel, wrecked and needy. “Please, don’t stop”
James chuckles and Dean does his best to glare at the man, entirely blaming him for Cas holding back and denying him what he really wants. “You two sure are a sight,” James says as he circles. “Alright, Castiel. These loops you made here and here,” he explains as he gestures to places that Dean can’t see but his gentle tugs tell Dean everything he needs to know.
Dean nods and Cas hums.
“Dean, I know you said that porn should be watched alone; but do you think it might help us here?” Castiel cocks his head, voice small and unsure. Since that first film with the babysitter and the pizza man, Dean has been adamant about the societal rules regarding watching porn.
Cas barely holds back a snarl. “Do not talk about Meg like that.”
“Babe,” Dean sits up and brushes his palms over Cas’ shoulders as he stares down at him. “What’s got you all twisted up?”
Mid shirtless Brandon heard a scream coming from the water. He walked over to where he last saw Catherine.
“Do you have a criminal history? Are you taking any drugs or medication? You know things like that.”
“What can I do for you boys?”
Sam hung towards the back and pulled out the EMF meter, nothing but crickets came back. Dean turned back to see if Sam had found anything, Sam replied by shaking his head.
The group had gotten to the top of the tower and the boys had introduced themselves. Marina was a pretty, blonde-haired woman with big red-lipstick stained lips, she was wearing a 2-piece that in Dean’s opinion was too small in a good way. Sam and Dean stood for a few seconds before they realized that she had asked a question.
“This is a little better,” Dean said in his FBI outfit, as they drove over to the Police station. The station was a little small but surprisingly well-kept for Florida. The receptionist was busy on the phone and motioned to the seats at the front of the building. After 5 minutes of twiddling their thumbs the receptionist called them to the front and asked,
The boys were surprised, “No, no it's nothing like that,” Sam reassured her, “we are here to help, nothing more”. They exchanged glances knowing full well they would never get any recognition. Dean walked over to the board and saw more missing people than body parts.
“Hey Brandon! Do you wanna go skinny dipping?” 17-year-old Catherine yells to her boyfriend. The couple had been out partying with their friends for the 4th of July on the beach. They had decided to slip out of the party and go for a walk on the beach. They were both a little tipsy and unaware of their surroundings.
“Oh, hi,” She muttered, still distracted as she lifted her hand to shake the boy's hands. “You guys the Feds?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Could we take a look at the parts?” Cass asked with a blank look on his face. Sheriff Ryan stared at him for a second,
The purr of Baby was almost overtaken by the sound of seagulls as Sam, Dean, and Cass pulled up to the public parking lot of Tigertail Beach, Florida. The beach was full of people, which made sense with the heat and how popular the cool waters got.
>>>>>> SUPERNATURAL <<<<<<
“Well that would be because you are wearing jeans in summer,” Sam replied, tossing him a pair of jean shorts. Sam had apparently dressed for the weather with a plain tee-shirt, basketball shorts and 5-dollar flip-flops.
“Are you guys here for the job?” The boy asked. He had short fluffy hair shaved on the sides, a first aid fanny pack draped around his shoulder. He was holding hands with his partner who was about the same age, they had short spiked hair, they were much shorter than the boy and had a whistle around their neck.
Cass was a little confused as to the reasoning behind beachwear, “What is the function of these sunglasses? The brightness of the sun has no effect on me whatsoever.”
“Body parts, he means body parts,” Dean fake chuckled, “he is new”. Dean mouthed a sorry as Sheriff Ryan pointed to the station's morgue which was just a sterile room with a table in the middle with a couple places to store cadavers.
Gadreel turns his head toward Dean with surprise written across his features and the very corners of Cas’ lips curl into a smile as he meets Dean’s gaze.
Benny arches a brow and frowns harder. “An arrangement? He don’t own you, brother, don’t let him…”
“Meg, please. Just let me take care of you.” Cas pulls her closer and rubs soothing circles between her shoulder blades. “Stay home tonight.”
“NO!” Sam screams and Asmodeus laughs as he comes to stand over Dean.
Dean steps out of his jeans and underwear, leaving them abandoned on the floor as he retakes his position straddled over Cas’ hips. Cas surges up to meet him when he bends down for a kiss, one hand roaming over Cas’ chest and down his belly, fingers tickling at the thin trail of hair that leads further down. “How do you want me, Angel?” Dean rasps, breath tickling the shell of Cas’ ear. “Do you want me to fuck you, mark you up, claim you as mine? Or do you want this,” Dean says, shifting his hips in a mockery of riding Cas’ thick cock. “Want to be inside me as I take my pleasure? Want to feel me clenching around you, greedily milking every last drop of come I can get?”
“Yeah, with a spell.” Dean protests, clenching the steering wheel tighter.
“It’s a classic.” Cas bites his lip to keep from laughing. He misses this lighthearted teasing, he remembers playing like this with his brothers when they were kids and with Meg before their lives took a turn for the worst.
What’s done is done. Dean has more important things to worry about.
Cas chuckles lowly as he works the plug back inside Dean’s ass and gives him a gentle smack when he’s ready for Dean to straighten. “I think you still have breakfast to make” Cas reminds as he tugs Dean’s jeans back to his hips.
“Go start my bubble bath, assbutt.” Cas rolls his eyes with a wide smile.
“Answer,” Dean snaps, adding a hard edge to his tone.
Dean shrugs. “More or less. My fans are usually pretty cool. There’s a few that we have to keep an eye out for, ones that have this sick obsession with me and Sam, but Benny knows their faces. They won’t get through.”
Garth’s grin refuses to fade. “For three years now!”
Over a dozen messages from Dean and nearly as many calls that have all gone ignored.
Dean rubs the back of his neck doubtfully and Cas feels his heart skip. He can’t be certain, but Dean seems rattled for once, out of his element and Cas feels a protective swell in his stomach.
“Dean is…” Cas says lowly as he leans close enough for his lips to brush Inias’ ear as he whispers too lowly for Dean to hear.
“No” Dean almost sobs and Cas rains sharps slaps against Dean’s ass and thighs.
*Cas*
His hands tremble as he reaches carefully between Dean and Samuel to set his burden down. Dean had requested Castiel be the one to serve him and his father, Cas being his great prize that the green-eyed man desires to show off and Jarl Samuel had relented.
Cas makes short work of spinning Dean around and guiding him to the table. “I’m gonna bend you over and fuck you hard and fast. If you don’t come on my cock, you will wait till later” Cas growls in Dean’s ear as his hand presses into Dean’s lower back.
When the john in front of him finally comes, Cas is left with a hollow feeling in his gut despite the cash padding his pocket and the awkward thanks thrown at him as the man hurries away to his wife.
The manages gives a cross look toward the door he ushered the photographer out of. “Still, I don’t appreciate my customers being harassed.”
Dean squirms with excitement when a roll is brought out on fire, the blue flames licking up over the protective dish.
Cas flushes crimson and ducks his chin.
“I’m Charlie! Dean’s agent.” The redhead holds out her hand and grins. Cas swears she’s nearly bouncing. “Dean warned me not to get in the way of your coffee fix, but while she’s making your drink maybe we can get this fickle business out of the way?”
Cas shakes his head fondly as he pushes to his feet and bumps Dean’s shoulder as he passes him to leave. Tonight has been wonderful and if Dean wants ice cream, he isn’t going to say no.
expecting that to happen.”
Cas sucks in a deep breath. He had suspected as much but to hear Sam put his thoughts into words causes a new spike of terror in Castiel’s gut. “Then let me go. If Dean wants to keep me safe, let me go,” Cas pleads, shaking his head as he speaks.
“My ass is fine. Thank you very much.” Cas dances away and flops onto the bed with the tv remote in hand.
Dean strokes his fingers through Cas’ hair and smiles. “What are you going to do, sir?” Dean asks, genuinely curious.
Dean lowers himself slowly, sucking gently with a pulsating rhythm. Cas squirms under his hands, determined to do as Dean asked no matter how much he doesn’t want to. Cas could overpower Dean without a thought, but he chooses to obey Dean and Dean alone. Dean’s cock gives a happy twitch at the thought that one of Chuck’s most powerful creations is putty in his merely human hands. Dean hums his happiness as the hard length in his mouth nudges against the back of his throat.
He pulls the package of fresh pasta out of the fridge and dumps a handful of kosher salt into the water while Dean leans against the counter to watch. “It’s nothing much, but I’d probably burn the place down if I tried to do more.” He shrugs and leans against the counter opposite of Dean, their feet nearly touching in the narrow space.
Cas hums, thinking. “I want you to get on your hands and knees for me. Facing that mirror” Cas’ low voice rumbles as his fingers travel to circle Dean’s nipples.
The bolt slides easily from the lock and Dean leads them through the basement corridors and up the staircase before Cas’ grace begins to recover from his ordeal.
Dean looks to Cas with worry beginning to cloud his thoughts. Is Cas already having second thoughts?
He loves the sound of that. He hums as he leans closer to press a chaste kiss to Dean’s stubbled cheek. “I appreciate that immensely, but I don’t want you to be uncomfortable.”
He is so chicken shit, sitting here like the worthless coward he is and avoiding his brother.
Thursday.
This is no way for grown adults to travel.
“You have not heard the end of this!” Asmodeus hisses as Dean sweeps around the corner and several of the other village members come into view as Dean pushes through the door. Asmodeus won’t dare try anything in public and they both know it.
“I know, I know. You don’t date.” Dean claps him on the shoulder playfully and uses the leverage to steer him toward the gleaming black beast of a car parked along the curb.
Turns out, he managed to get himself turned around and is farther from his apartment than where he started.
Of course, Cas’ word counts for nothing to the Jarl but Dean and Benny believe him wholeheartedly. Enough so for Benny to lie and say that he heard every word Cas had relayed to him.
Cas also explains that he works for himself, owning his small firm, so he gives himself Mondays off.
“Say it, Cas. Tell me you won’t go off alone anymore” Dean grunts the words as he picks up his pace. Cas clenches around him, the tight heat makes staving off his orgasm nearly impossible. He only wants a minute more. He needs Cas to understand.
Dean returns a few minutes later wearing an open green flannel over a black undershirt. “Better?” Dean asks sarcastically, holding his arms out wide as he glares at his brother.
are, Cas” Dean flashes a grin. “Do you know that he keeps threatening me with horrible things if I screw this up? Like whatever he might do would be worse than losing you” Dean snorts a laugh and shakes his head, taking in Castiel’s growing smile. A smile reserved just for Dean
He needs to see him clean and bundled into bed.
“Cas,” Dean’s gentle tone cuts through Castiel’s thoughts and he turns to blink at the man, surprised to find they’ve come to a stop at the edge of the forest. “Cas, water,” Dean says, eyeing Castiel cautiously.
He can’t do that to Cas.
With a few drinks in him, Cas would almost consider giving up coffee for a whole week for just one piping hot fresh pastry from the French Quarter.
The young man smiles and takes Cas’ card. “It’s going to be an even fifty.”
Dean climbs to his feet as gracefully as he can but his knees ache in protest and he fails to hide his grimace. Cas ignores Dean’s suffering, as Dean has demanded he do, and drapes the blanket over his shoulders instead. Dean happily pulls the quilt tightly around him like a cloak, only now realizing the chill in the room and how his skin is pebbled.
She deserves so much more than a five-dollar tip for the service she provides.
Cas grins wider as Ellen claps Dean on the back.
“Cas,” Dean says softly. “I promised,” Dean says in Castiel’s language, the words coming slow and stiff.
This is too much. Grandparents. He has grandparents.
Lilith’s advances had always been easy to ignore before he left for the raid this spring, but her persistent aggression toward Cas since their return has been enough for him to wish her gone. To think she had been intended to seduce him is laughable. She is beautiful, Dean will allow that, but she is nothing compared to Cas.
He nods once, admitting to what appears to be a grievous personality flaw.
He trembles as Cas wraps him in a warm embrace, their skin sticky with a fine sheen of sweat and Cas’ cooling come between them. But Dean doesn’t care.
“He won’t let me out of my lease,” Cas grumbles as he tosses the last bag of his belongings, at least the ones he cares about, into the back seat. “My contract isn’t up for five more months.” He frowns and shakes his head, he could have sworn the lease he agreed to expires in January but Zachariah is now saying March.
“The umbrella, man!” Dean grins as he spins the tiny thing between his fingers.
“I betray no one,” Cas snaps and takes a step back. He clenches his jaw and glares. “You are a dear friend and brother to me, please do not forsake me for finding happiness.”
The taste isn’t as awful as Cas was expecting and his stomach seems to immediately recognize the fish as sustenance and demands he eat more.
“Dean!” Cas growls, snagging Dean’s arm and pulling him around.
The feeling of someone so close is strange and foreign and yet the sensation is somehow comforting.
Dean grunts with the force of Cas’ movements as tension coils low in his belly, their interruption nearly forgotten with the pace Castiel sets.
Cas takes a steadying breath and nods. Gabriel might be a bit manic at times, but Cas has never won a chess match against him and he pities anyone who thinks they could best Gabriel when it comes to subterfuge.
, are essential to a healthy eco-system.” Cas retorts, glaring all the while as he gestures to his yard with a sweep of his hand. “They deserve as much care as any other living thing.”
And truthfully, Cas really isn’t ready to say goodnight.
Dean nods again, stomach unclenching incrementally with each breath. “Do you want to do like last time or do you want to…”
No wonder Dean usually prefers to drive his baby everywhere.
Cas huffs and shakes his head at the thought. Just because Dean hasn’t physically harmed him, does not make him a protector.
Cas chuckles. “No, Dean. It does not involve food. I asked the Google, hotdogging is like intercrural sex but between the butt cheeks instead of the thighs.”
He can’t bring himself to look at Cas, to take in the man’s silence or risk him making more empty promises.
“Let me go, Lilith,” Cas demands, hoping he’s found the right words through his adrenaline-fueled haze. His heart is lodged in his throat and makes his words come out stiff and choked sounding enough to draw another derisive laugh from his attacker.
and kicked him out on his ass.
“Of course,” Cas says softly, swallowing around the lump in his throat.
Seeing the love of his life and his brother chatting and smiling together is closer to perfection than Dean ever thought he would be fortunate enough to witness.
A low whistle comes from the back. “He must be amazing to have you in a good mood so early. Damn. I’m jealous.”
“I’m sorry, Cas” Dean mutters, nearly a whimper.
A lesser man would think that Asmodeus’ age, he would be at a disadvantage, but Dean knows better.
Meg rolls her eyes and pushes to her feet with a wince. “He asked you to dinner, you said yes. He kissed you, you kissed back. You said so yourself.” She places her hands on his shoulders and stares up into his widened blue eyes. “Let yourself have this, Castiel.”
Dean huffs with a smile. “If you want me to blow you, then yes.”
Benny gives the man a sideways glance and his expression falters before he raises the club once more.
Dean’s gaze flits to Cas before scowling at the woman. “Mind your own business,” he grumbles with a glare to rival Sam’s best bitch face. “Cas, I thought you were gonna...” He trails off with a wave of his hand and quirks a brow as Cas nods.
“Dean!” John calls from the backdoor.
Cas’s breath seizes when he notices the used needle on the floor and the lighter discarded on the counter. “Shit.”
Cas nods before pressing a gentle kiss to Dean’s lips. “Tomorrow? We can talk about what we both want out of the experience and decide beforehand how far we’re planning to go. I shouldn’t have just sprung this on you, I apologize, Dean.”
Cas had been worried about his job when he and Dean decided to go public. Dean’s adoring fans were one thing, but the professional repercussions of dating someone as famous as Dean were something he couldn’t anticipate or control.
Showing up late and ass drunk at his father’s graveside service was something Bobby just wasn’t going to tolerate.
Dean nods and swallows hard as he watches Cas go.
“Dean would like to know who your friend is,” Sam offers helpfully and Dean can’t help the scowl that he gives his brother.
He watches Dean’s throat flex as he thinks, still staring at the door and he lets out a sigh of relief when Dean’s shoulders sag.
As if Dean is even looking at him right now.
Cas is on his feet before his brain can catch up with Dean’s ridiculous notion. “A toy?” The words escape his throat as a low growl as he stalks toward Dean, slowly crowding into the man’s space even as he inches backward. “You think you’re a toy to me?” Cas gently strokes his fingers over the high arch of Dean’s cheek, his tone softened into a mere whisper.
Cas glares with a huff.
But, Dean is Dean, so he keeps his mouth shut and lets his touch do the talking.
“You asshole.” Cas grabs the napkin from Dean’s hand and presses it to his mouth, spitting inky black saliva into the white paper with a disgusted scowl. He takes a swig of the too cold water in front of him and spits it back into the glass, growling low in his throat as it comes out tinged with black.
Cas leans back, out of Dean’s space and pushes to his feet. His cheeks flush crimson and he runs a hand over his face. Only then does he seem to realize that he snapped at Benny and he turns to the man with worry etched clearly in his features.
Cas barks a laugh at Dean’s acrid tone and grins. “Would you believe that running into you has been the highlight of my day?”
He hears another rustle of leaves and branches and he relaxes marginally, the sound likely only one of his warriors up to relieve themselves.
Cas tilts his head and looks to Dean, watching him studiously as Dean carefully watches their hands clasped between them. “And, do feet appeal to you?” Those blue eyes strip Dean bare beyond his lack of clothing and Dean has no choice but to give in.
Cas nods but his heart feels hollow. Gadreel saved his life and praying for his soul seems so…inadequate.
Cas groans against Dean’s shoulder and shakes his head. “I wouldn’t call this amends.”
Dean nods with a grimace. “I promise, Dad. Don’t worry about us. Please, don’t even…think about us.” Talk about awkward. Eww.
Who do you think is going to break first?
Thankfully, Dean leaves him alone to brood and Cas feels like a fool for trying to explain anything.
“I don’t think he’ll be weird about this, but I dunno.” Dean does not want to tell Cas how Benny held him after that horrible nightmare of the eruption.
“Coleslaw,” Cas says seriously, as if mixing that particular salad is of dire consequence.
His lower back screams with the sharp pain from where Benny’s knee has him pinned and his shoulders ache from having his arms wrenched backward, but Benny seems to have infinite patience as he silently waits for him to calm. Finally, after what feels like hours, the fight bleeds out of Cas and he goes lax in Benny’s hold.
At least Sammy has made peace with their irrelevance.
Charlie nods but narrows her eyes in scrutiny. “Are you enjoying yourself here? I mean, you’ve never played mini-golf or any of these arcade games I’m guessing.”
Cas arches a skeptical brow and doesn’t move from his chair even when Dean scoots back and checks his watch.
Cas’ expression falls and Dean swears he can see disappointment flicker in his too blue gaze. “Next time, sure,” Cas forces a smile that neither of them believes.
Dean almost forgets they have an audience until Meg lets out a low whistle of approval. Dean pulls back quickly with an awkward chuckle. “I’m fine. Everything’s fine.”
His boyfriend’s answering cackle has Castiel turning to kill the man with his glare.
Dean cocks his head at the strange yet distantly familiar word but doesn’t pause his mission of tying Castiel’s hands together.
Dean gives Cas a lazy grin and nods. “M’fine, Cas,” he tries to say but Cas is not convinced. “I shoulda known better, she’s a sneaky one.” Dean looks inside the enclosure with a smirk and shakes his head.
That makes Cas perk up and he pushes himself into a sitting position before holding out his hands. “Gimme.”
Cas leans over to spit and rinse his mouth after he sets his toothbrush aside. “I like to see you happy.” He turns in Dean’s arms and leans closer with his hands resting on Dean’s hips.
That is a subject best left untouched.
“I shot Dean Winchester?” The little girl from laser tag stands in front of them, looking around Cas at Dean with wide, star-struck eyes.
“Sorry,” Dean mumbles, hoping he hasn’t accidentally ruined the good day Cas has been having but Cas hums again, this time with a note of forgiveness in his tone.
That was when Samuel had burst through the door to the sanctuary and their father had shoved Dean and little Sam behind the alter, telling Dean to “take care of Sammy.”
He’s certain he might explode at any moment.
“That’s what I’m talking about!” Dean reaches for his swim trucks and Cas swats him away with a laugh.
“Of course not,” Dean says hurriedly but Cas isn’t convinced by his words. The dismissive lilt to his tone and the nervous chuckle that follows makes Castiel’s stomach squirm and his smile grow.
“Cas,” Dean breathes, voice barely more than a breathy whine as he fumbles to lock the door behind him. “You were gonna call...”
“Dean,” Cas says tiredly as he gently pushes his handsy boyfriend away. “You said you have to be up in two hours.”
“What will you do with Gabriel?” Dean questions, genuinely curious.
“Out with it, Sammy,” Dean chides, already sensing Sam is going to drag his feet all day if Dean doesn’t force it out of him.
Dean’s cheeks flush and he looks down at his coffee. “Like I said, I’m new to the area. I guess I didn’t realize…”
“Time to meet your new Jarl,” Azazel says smoothly. “We have some new toys I’m sure you’ll
“Is that so wrong?” Dean bites. He can’t fathom why Cas thinks that Dean caring is so amusing, but he does not appreciate the ridicule.
Bal has been trying to convince him for years that sometimes you just know.
By the time Dean leaves, Castiel’s stomach is twisted in confused knots as he replays their interaction in his mind, searching for whatever key piece of information he must have missed.
“You know how Heaven is going dark? Cas thinks one could act as a generator to keep things going up there” Dean explains, chewing on his lip slightly as he waits for Sam to take that information in.
No one.
The other man keeps his steady gaze on their surroundings for the rest of the night and Cas doesn’t risk trying to move. At the very least, the brothers have made no move to harm him, but he isn’t foolish enough to trust anyone here.
Dean buries his nose in the crook of Cas’ neck with a noise of disagreement. “I’m a cuttlefish,” Dean says and Cas goes still.
He likes it.
Cas pulls back with widened eyes and nods silently before disappearing with a flutter of wings.
Dean shrugs. Rufus said the same and he isn’t going to argue with that. He’ll let Cas decide if he wants to repeat his speech or leave it between the three of them.
“Just. Give me a second” Dean pleads as he reaches a hand to pry one of the contacts from his eye. “See” He holds the black disc out for Sam to see and blinks the dryness from his eye now that the blasted thing is gone. He quickly gives his other eye the same treatment. “It’s just me Sam”
Dean is watching him carefully, cheeks flushed. “Yeah?”
“Dean…” Cas starts but Balthazar steers him away with a grunt.
Cas shakes his head and purses his lips, still fighting back a smile. “That’s what I’m afraid of,” he says with exasperation in his tone even as he digs in his pocket for his phone. “Fine, I’ll ask him to come up.”
Dean looks quite proud of himself and Cas’ chest feels warm at the sight. He squeezes Dean’s hand and tugs him closer. He isn’t about to complain that Dean is so tactile.
Dean moans and swallows, tongue sweeping around the underside of Cas’ cock as warm come fills his mouth. He suckles and licks until Cas collapses against the bed, spent and panting.
“How can I tell if you’re ok when I can’t feel you clearly?” Cas asks and Dean knows the question is rhetorical. Sometimes their play gets a little rough, a little unconventional, and Cas is always careful to not push Dean anywhere near his limits. Cas’ expression darkens as he wraps the fingers of one hand around Dean’s now fully erect cock and squeezes almost too hard. Dean gasps and bucks into Cas’ grip but the Angel isn’t having it. Dean suddenly finds himself pinned to the cold shower wall with no chance of escape. Luckily, not a single cell in his body wants to escape. Cas’ hand roughly tugs on Dean’s erection and Dean keens in pleasure.
His hand slips into Cas’ as they explore room after room and Dean’s heart rate increases with each passing exhibit. More than once, Cas gives him a curious look but Dean shrugs off his concern.
By now, Ezekiel and Balthazar are watching closely and Cas doesn’t miss the concerned look shared between them.
“You…” Dean starts but trails off and Cas can tell he’s working up to something. “You’ll stay with me when you come, right? I mean, I can get you your own room if you want but I’d really like it if you’d…we don’t have to do anything, just sleep like before…”
Cas settles between Dean’s knees with a happy hum and takes Dean’s hard length between his lips and sucks lightly, teasing.
“Shit, Cas, breathe.” Dean turns to him and grips his shoulders. “It’s okay. You’re okay.”
Charlie shakes her head and then nods. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to pry.” She squeaks and Cas’ heart sinks further.
Dean throws his head back with parted lips. “F…faster,” he mutters as he forces his gaze back to Cas. “Wanna feel it.”
“Winchester,” Dean and Cas say in unison and Cas swears his heart is about to beat out of his chest. Has he really had a thin connection to Dean for years before they met? He shakes his head and swallows hard.
Dean parks and they climb out of the car without another word. One look to Sam’s scowl has Dean’s hackles rising all over again and he presses himself firmly into Cas’ space. He doesn’t care if his parents aren’t accustomed to seeing him with someone, he isn’t letting Cas think he has to face them alone.
Cas forces himself to look at Dean and study the man’s features. He might not understand most of Dean’s words, but the man’s expression is far more open. Dean chews his lip as he watches Castiel study him and Cas sees what he thinks is genuine concern.
“I’m sorry he hurt you,” Dean mutters and Castiel cocks his head, uncertain of Dean’s meaning.
“We should be going, Dean.” Cas pulls away from Meg, pretending his cheeks aren’t heating steadily. The sway of Meg’s hips is impeccable, her smile perfectly seductive. There is no doubt that she is a beautiful woman but Dean barely spared her a glance.
Cas grins as he leans up and reaches for the drawer. He searches wildly, knocking against whatever else might be rattling around inside before coming up triumphantly.
His friend looks up from the pile of papers in front of him, his fingers still buried in his hair like he’s been tugging on it and his eyes are half glazed.
Eventually, he pries himself from the bed and stumbles into the kitchen where he eyes the full trash with disdain. That explains the smell, at least.
The man hums as he gently turns Cas to face the wall. “That’s a shame, I bet your lips are delicious,” he whispers, his voice low and husky as his fingers skim Cas’ hips and push his jeans down to uncover his ass. “Can I put my mouth on you? Not on the lips, but elsewhere?”
“Ravenclaw,” Charlie says with a smile as she gestures toward a table. “Now, the gist of this agreement is that you aren’t allowed to post anything about this date on social media, tell anyone about meeting Dean through a dating app, or take any photographs beyond what Dean might offer. We’ll walk through the finer details as we go, gotta make sure you understand everything before signing on the dotted line.”
Cas barks a laugh and squirms away. “Brat.” He grins and shakes his head.
Cas nods and finds a seat at one of the small tables in the room to munch on his sandwich. Dean mentioned dinner after, so he doesn’t want to eat too much but he is getting pretty hungry.
Dean does as requested without protest, and Cas whispers more affirmations into his ear that leave him shivering and begging for more. Castiel continues to use his grace to manifest lubrication and Dean keens when the thick head of his cock eases past the tight ring of muscles at Dean’s entrance.
Dean shrugs and leans back in for more delicious kisses but Cas pushes him off and quickly climbs over him.
He’s known that Gabriel was once as cold and battle-hardened as the family he was raised with, but he left all that behind when he joined their brotherhood, Cas has never seen the extent of Gabriel’s ability and he fears that he soon will. “Gabe, we should go. There is nothing to gain here,” Cas whispers and looks at his brother with a plea written in his gaze.
“Castiel!” She cries out and hurries around the counter, all but throwing herself at him with a crushing embrace.
Cas nods and presses a kiss to the top of Dean’s head. “Would you?”
Benny arches a brow and turns to stare at Cas for a moment before looking back at Dean. “In that case, I’ll leave you to it.
“Dean, get off your boyfriend’s lap and buckle up,” Benny gripes from the front seat and Cas feels a flush creeping up his neck as Dean does as he’s told.
Cas drops to his knees, tears streaming down his cheeks as he leans forward and mutters words that sound like nonsense to Dean.
Neither of them are.
Dean manages a nod, the small motion being the best he can do when his brain is short circuiting from this unexpected turn of events. More sex with Cas? How is that even a question? Since they’ve progressed from friends to lovers, Dean has been insatiable where Castiel is concerned; and Cas has been full of surprises.
“Now?”
Right now, he doesn’t care.
The words are out of his mouth before Cas can stop them and Dean’s little frown makes it clear that they weren’t quite the right thing to say.
What if Dean didn’t?
Perhaps the rocks can wait.
Sam pinches the bridge of his nose and drops his chin to glare at the ground. He lets out a heavy sigh that automatically has Dean tensing in anticipation. “I don’t know how you can say that, you self-sacrificing moron! He loves you!”
The walk to his alley hasn’t changed in the last two weeks, despite his entire life upending and Missy’s coffee shop is as warm and inviting as ever.
Dean's heart flips at the sight and he can’t help but step into Cas’ space and dig his fingers into Cas’ untamable hair. “Some things never change, huh?” Dean asks playfully as he tries to smooth his dark locks into something resembling managed.
Inias’ features tighten and he narrows his eyes. “Will your
“Sure sounds like it to me,” Gabe says with a twinkle in his eye that Castiel does not like one little bit. “Anyway, I thought we were ordering pizza?”
“Dean?” Cas asks, voice unsure. Dean lifts his chin to meet Cas’ gaze, intending to gesture for Cas to join him but his words die on his tongue when he sees Cas lift his come coated fingers to his lips.
He’s pretty much resigned himself to not hearing back from Dean after his blunder and he digs his phone out of his pocket to see if Bal is free for lunch.
When Dean reached for him, Cas had flinched away with apologies on his lips that tore Dean’s heart to shreds.
Dean nods, looking into her wide and interested eyes before noticing Gabriel’s frown. “You alright, Gabe?”
He startles when the cutting sound of someone pounding on his front door fills the room, jarring him from his thoughts. “Dean!” A familiar voice calls through his front door, carrying a sense of urgency followed by several hard thumps against the wood. “Open up!”
Cas’ quiet pants and gasps fill the room as Dean continues to work him with his mouth. Dean delights in having part of Castiel in his mouth, in having him in a way that Dean had never thought he would. The pull of Cas’ fingers in his hair is nearing perfection as Dean tightens his lips around Cas’ girth and pumps his head up and down.
Dean hesitates and for a moment, Cas thinks he’s going to kiss him again but he refrains. Instead, Dean turns away to join Sam and Benny. Undoubtedly to plan their next moves.
Cas laughs at Dean’s stricken look. Trading soapy handjobs had proven to be an effective way to overcome his nervousness but he isn’t certain being overheard was worth it.
If he closes his eyes.
Cas’ voice is stronger.
She was cruel, vindictive, and generally horrible to both of them.
“He is not yours. He was trespassing into our camp to steal what is ours. You hold no claim on him,” Alastair says boldly, only the slightest flinch giving away his unease. “I was doing what you should have done.”
Before Dean can convince his lips to form words, Cas grips his hips and pushes in solidly and just a shade too fast. Dean gasps and bucks with a hiss as his body argues against the sudden intrusion even as his nerves sing for more.
Bobby had a lease drawn up so Cas could have an official address and Ellen helped him pour over help wanted ads when Dean was at work, not even questioning the lies that Cas had told them before.
Cas pulls away from Dean’s touch, refusing to let Dean get under his skin any further. “No.” Castiel forces himself to pull away despite craving the tender touch. His life has become one trial after another, his body constantly aches, and bruises litter the skin he can’t bring himself to look at.
Cas nods again. “I
“Ah ah, stay away from that,” Mick chides when Cas’s fingers brush over something hard and rectangular strapped just below Mick’s armpit.
But he and Cas are determined to see this through. “I could ease your discomfort, Dean. I know your ass has to be sore by now” Cas whispers in Dean’s ear as he drops his chin onto the hunter’s shoulder.
Cas chuckles. “Patience, Mr. Winchester” He chides as he pulls his cock free from his pants and slicks it up. He lines up with Dean’s hole, now at the perfect height and angle as he touches the tip of his dick to the loosened pucker of Dean’s ass.
Dean’s squirming stomach flops at those words and his heart constricts as he shakes his head silently. He doesn’t like that idea, not at all. “I’ll let you go then,” he breaths as he tightly closes his eyes and swallows hard.
Alfie nods, still trembling slightly but Cas knows from experience that the worst is over. He’ll start feeling better soon. “You’re the first person I’ve told,” he says quietly, barely a whisper.
Dean grins. “So, we’re both already planning on going to Rome on the same day?”
Dean rolls his eyes and covers his yawn. “You talked to him last night. How much do you think has changed between now and then?”
“Dean, come on,” Lee huffs and gestures down the hall.
“I need y’all to do me a favor, what’ddya say?” Dean calls out with his smile firmly in place. The way he stands, the command he has over the crowd is astounding. For all that he’s familiar,
“Dean, you can’t be serious.” Sam shakes his head in feigned disbelief.
Dean's lips curl upward even as he obviously tries to stifle his amusement at Castiel’s misery.
There are so many ways that Dean could continue that sentence but no words feel adequate. Nothing can express the sheer level of overwhelmed that Dean feels right now.
angry. That's a good sign, right?
Knowing Gabriel, she must be a big fish in the local industry to plant that smug little smirk on his face.
Their breath comes in short pants, although surely for differing reasons, and Dean trembles in Castiel’s hands. “Dean?” Castiel whispers, doing his absolute best to keep his voice steady.
Dean’s brow arches and then scrunches. “Uh, what?” Urophagia? What the hell? “No. No piss or vomit, thank you very much. Hard pass.”
“Are you certain, Dean?” Cas asks, reining in his obvious desire as he strokes a hand down Dean’s bare forearm until their fingers tangle together effortlessly.
“Damn stubborn idgit, that was four years ago. You don’t think that he misses you?” Bobby takes a swig from his nearly empty bottle and sets it aside. Dean’s gaze tracks the motion and his breath hitches with how hard Bobby’s words hit.
Sam pinches a frown and Dean looks on curiously, wishing yet again that he had taken the time to learn the language of Wessex. The more he listens to Castiel speak, the more the syllables come forward in his mind. Memories he’s been shoving down since he was a young boy.
Not someone who Cas views as a monster.
Dean leaves a kiss in Cas’ hair. “You’re not a mess. This is new for both of us. We’ll figure it out.”
Samuel looks up with a faint smile, his clear preference for the younger of his sons is shown in the way his eyes light up at Sam’s presence.
Just, not this soon.
And once again, Balthazar proves his faith to be well placed.
Dean sucks in a breath and shakes his head, dislodging Cas’ hold. “This, you.” Dean shakes his head. “What are we doing?”
“Cas!” Dean exclaims with a grin, leaning forward automatically to press a deep kiss to his lover’s lips. “I wasn’t expecting to see you yet” His grin refuses to fade as he rakes his eyes over the expanse of tanned flesh on display before him. Cas must have willed his clothes away or undressed before he popped in here to join Dean.
Dean frowns as he considers the space. “Some,” he mutters. He is barely willing to admit that this adventure is bringing back memories long since buried.
Dean goes to work and comes back with Cas barely climbing out of bed in between. He should get up and go home, go to work. He’s going to lose his apartment if he doesn’t make enough to pay the rent.
“That was,” Dean says and swallows hard as Cas crawls up his body to snuggle in close. “Intense.” Dean feels foolish even mentioning it, but he knows that Cas appreciates when he uses his words and damn does he want to make Cas happy.
“Room service!” a voice calls and both men sag in relief before huffing awkward laughs.
Cas is happy with him. He isn’t upset. Dean can do this. He sucks in a ragged breath as Cas continues pounding into him.
She flashes him a winning smile and closes the distance between them as he stands frozen to the pavement that is only now beginning to release the heat of the day, coving the faint chill of night air rolling in from the bay. “It might be a little cold, I wasn’t sure when you’d be by…” She trails off as she holds out the cup earnestly.
something.
“What the hell is going on here!” Benny barks as he charges into the clearing, taking in the scene before him.
Cas bobs up and down, licking and sucking as he swallows around Dean’s length, pulling needy whines and whimpers from the man as he trembles beneath him.
Cas grins and leans against the signpost to wait. He tucks his fingertips into his pockets as he stares, waiting for Dean to emerge from the growling beast of a car.
Nothing.
Cas must understand enough because he lowers with only a huff of protest and whimper of pain. Dean’s heart aches knowing there is little he can do. The brighter light of the fire reveals a trail of blood leaking down Castiel’s leg and Dean’s outrage grows. He lets out a low growl as he tugs Castiel’s robe aside to reveal the monk’s bare leg and more crimson wetness.
He can’t leave her to die alone.
“Good. Because I’m guessing I don’t have to tell you what’ll happen if you hurt my brother,” Sam says pointedly, tone going flat and threatening enough to leave Cas swallowing hard.
He exchanges his nearly broken pencil for a pen cap, gnawing absently as he continues his grading quest. He’s proud of his freshmen students this semester. They've come a long way since August and their essays are quite insightful for being so young.
“I was wondering,” Megan says, glancing over at Cas and down at his hands. “Who, who’s your… friend?” Another word clearly wanted to come out and the way she says friend comes off as more polite than insulting but Cas can’t help the amused huff that escapes him.
“Don’t you dare argue, Cassie. I’ve spent the last five years thinking you were dead, I
“Dean,” Cas gasps and tips his head back as Dean bites and kisses his way down Cas’ throat, the gentle nips sending shock waves of arousal straight to his groin the same as they had in their dreams.
The bodyguard does manage to corral Dean before he tumbles out onto the pavement, but he doesn’t bother trying to hold him back from circling the SUV and pinning Cas against the sleek exterior.
“That doesn’t answer my question,” Dean says gently and Cas pulls back, tucking his hands into his lap.
Deeper into the trees, the hairs on the back of his neck begin to stand at attention, his instinct demanding a reaction to a charge in the air that he cannot quite place. The farther Dean travels from camp, the louder the silence becomes and the more certain Dean is that something isn’t right.
He has no idea what he’s doing.
Cas doesn’t go far, although Dean knows that he would if he asked him too. Dean doesn’t need the privacy, he has nothing to say to her that Cas can’t hear too.
Cas had begged though, begged Dean to bind him in the Enochian handcuffs inside the warded basement room designed to hold an Angel prisoner. Right now, Cas is as close to human as he can be without losing his grace and Dean hesitates applying the final items to render Cas cut off from the world and helpless to resist the scene he and Dean had carefully discussed.
By the time Gabriel hangs up the phone, Cas is exhausted but happier than he’s been in years.
“Cas,” Sam crouches in front of Castiel and reaches out to touch his shoulder. “Cas, look at me,” Sam speaks in Castiel’s language and Cas meets the man’s hazel eyes. “Take a deep breath, come on. In slow. Breathe with me,” Sam instructs as he exaggerates his breathing.
“Awesome,” Sam says with a grin.
Asmodeus lets out a strangled yelp of pain as the sharp edge of Dean’s wyvern sword cuts deep into his side and crimson fluid quickly spreads against the white linen of his loose-fitting shirt.
Dean smiles to himself and chews his lip. “It’s a tux, Cas. That’s what makes it different.” Dean lifts his hands to muss Cas’ hair.
*Castiel*
“Dean,” Cas says again at normal volume as he shakes Dean’s shoulder.
“Yes,” Dean says, already feeling himself slip away into that hazy space that he’s come to love.
He would just rather not be on the receiving end of that threat.
Cas sighs as he tucks the extra money away, already deciding that he’s going to stop for coffee tomorrow night and spend a few minutes chatting with Missy. If he’s careful, he’ll have enough left to pay for his own meal when he has dinner with Dean on Sunday.
She grins and flexes her feet, pushing onto her tiptoes before dropping back and repeating the motion with an eager nod. “I aced all my classes.” Her grin turns blinding and Cas can’t help the happy chuckle that escapes him.
Dean sags against his bonds, his body feeling boneless as Cas keeps going. He can feel his cock softening and his post-orgasmic haze threatens to pull him under. He wants to stay awake for Cas though. He needs to. “Cas” Dean squeaks, forcing his eyes to remain open.
Dean lifts his head sluggishly as Cas takes his cock in hand. The languid strokes send shockwaves skittering up Dean’s spine and he finds himself locking eyes with Cas in the mirror. “Look at yourself, Dean” Cas turns his chin to whisper into Dean’s ear, gently thrusting and stroking. “Look how perfect you are” he nips the column of Dean’s throat with blunt teeth as Dean groans and slumps back against him.
“No, Sam. Pretty sure he’s done with me.” Dean rolls his eyes and drops his head back on the couch.
Dean’s pants fit his waist near perfectly, the thighs a little too snug, and they fall a tad too long over his bare feet. Overall, not a terrible fit and they’re the best he can do under the circumstances. The fabric feels strange against his legs since he has worn naught but his Monk’s robes since well before he came to be in Dean’s company but the feeling isn’t entirely unwelcome.
” He sucks in a deep breath. “You’re the best big brother, the best I could have asked for. Hell, you were more of a dad to me than Dad was.”
“You…” Cas says with a sputtering laugh. “I would have loved to see their faces.”
Cas hums and moans, enjoying bringing this tense pleasure to his love; knowing this is something Dean would probably have never asked for but is loving all the same. He sinks down until his nose brushes the tight curls of Dean groin and slowly but steady applies pressure with his teeth until Dean is trembling and whispering quiet pleas between needy whines.
When the sun dips over the horizon, Dean once again eagerly holds out a piece of salted fish to Castiel and Cas wrinkles his nose at the offering. He shakes his head and mutters a quiet no. Dean’s expression darkens into something Cas fears might be anger and soon, Dean turns to exchange low words with Benny that has the other man yelling something to the surrounding boats that sound like orders.
“Shuttup,” Dean grumbles but he doesn’t bother to hide his smile.
“Shit, sorry,” Cas hurries to apologize when Dean sputters but his concern is waved off easily as Dean’s tongue presses against the underside of his cock.
Dean’s attention has refocused, but Cas can’t pry his gaze from the man as he sings song after song, holding the microphone seductively on the rare occasion he set his guitar aside. He jokes with the crowd, teases them, and smiles wide as people lob excited screams toward the band.
Dean takes the last sip of his drink and gathers their cups to return to the counter. “Can I get your phone number? To set up our date, I, uh, it would be easier than the app. Feel more legit, you know?”
“Good idea,” Cas grumbles after he spits into an empty glass on the table.
“Another hunt” Dean grumbles as he throws his duffle into Baby’s trunk. Cas stands by his side, looking every bit as pleased as Dean feels. They just got back and now Jody called asking them to check out a potential werewolf in upstate Nebraska. Dean huffs a sigh, at least they won’t be on the road all day this time. Only a few hours.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean grumbles, leaning in for one more chaste kiss before he releases Cas’ hips and takes a step back. “Walk next to me and glare at anyone who looks like they might be thinking about approaching, they’ll just assume you’re security like Benny.”
Understanding is slow to dawn, but when it does, a wide grin splits his features. “You’re a genius!” He hurries to do as Dean instructed and Benny helpfully swaps out the saltshakers. This is going to be more than okay. This is going to be
“Cas,” Dean says, tone cracking.
Eileen.
“Alright. Let's go” Dean turns abruptly towards the door and snags Castiel by the wrist on his way out.
He had not anticipated that he would feel more guilt-ridden the longer he kept his secret but he hasn’t yet collected enough courage to face that battle. He half considers continuing on the easy route and tucking it back into his robes but the thought doesn’t quite sit right with him.
After spurning Dean earlier, he expects the green-eyed man will offer him nothing more.
“If calling your brother means getting proper ID so you can get a real job, then you should,” she rasps through the final coughs of her fit and she drops back against the couch, exhausted.
His breath catches in his throat as he crosses the room to Dean’s carefully folded clothing. The ones that Cas himself folded only days ago.
Cas frowns but nods. “He has. Surprisingly.”
Cas leans forward with a smirk. “Do you think you can come like this?” He whispers and Dean nearly chokes as Cas presses down. A thrill rushes through him, something forbidden and yet completely natural settling into place.
Cas groans as those blue eyes slide closed and he presses a gentle kiss to the side of Dean’s ankle. A smile tugs at his lips as Dean watches, propped on his elbows. Dean’s heart seizes at the sight and his cock feels like he’s going to explode with the shockwaves of pleasure that travel through him at the sight of Cas kissing and licking places Dean had never thought of asking for. His toes curl and a shiver runs up his spine with each lick. This better than he ever expected it to be. All of the incidental pleasure he’s ever felt from the few clumsy foot massages he’s experienced is nothing compared to this. This is bliss.
“I found it at the same shop that I bought the sound, I saw it before the lists and then you wrote collaring and I...” Cas babbles with an increasing amount of uncertainty coloring his tone and Dean turns his attention to the flustered Angel.
Cas won’t admit to it, but Dean knows how much he loves having a supportive and caring mother figure in his life. The way his blue eyes lit up happily when Mary introduced him as her third son to her co-workers last Christmas said enough.
he’s okay, that he doesn’t need a drink.
“Harder,” Dean groans as he bucks his hips. His hand drifts to the front of Cas’ sweats and for a moment, Cas thinks he might reach inside.
He should have known.
“Don’t forget that you killed Hitler,” Cas agrees softly.
He stops outside room fourteen and hesitates. Does he knock? Does he just go in? “Man up Winchester” He mutters under his breath and reaches for the handle. It’s just Cas behind the door, why should he knock?
“You’re struggling with the idea” She nods sagely. “Do you trust your partner?”
“No,” Castiel bites with a frown and turns his gaze away from temptation. He doesn’t care if his stubborn refusal costs him his life. He will gladly die in service to his God. He will not serve these men.
“Do you want him to be?” Balthazar tilts his head and smirks. “It’s about time you get some tail, darling, you can’t spend all your time with your books.”
Who would have guessed that Sam would choose a girl so much like Ellen and her daughter, Jo?
Castiel’s first knot is sloppy and James has him undo and redo it before allowing him to continue.
Dean huffs a laugh and Cas can hear the beep of a card reader in the background and then the sound of a door closing. “I’m glad to hear it.”
Not all of his injuries are fake.
“What?” Dean asks again, smile widening as his eyes glint with mirth. “It’s important you know what you’re getting into.”
“You?” Cas says, pointing to himself and Dean scowls as he shakes his head.
“Do you wish to argue?” Cas asks and Dean already knows Cas’ thick brow is raised, just daring him to push.
“Tomorrow is aphrodisiacs. Do those actually work, Dean?” Cas scoots up just enough to meet Dean’s gaze, blue eyes questioning.
They move quietly with Sam holding his ax at the ready. The sounds of the raid echo through the halls but their cohort has yet to progress this deep into the monastery.
His shame means he shall not receive a proper funeral and his soul shall never reside in Valhalla. Dean will see to it.
“Uh,” Cas says, glancing around at his options. “Bacon and some eggs?” Cas decided on, looking to Dean for approval.
