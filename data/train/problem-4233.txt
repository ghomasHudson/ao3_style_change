“Anyway, but she’s still in pain and I could have taken that from her if nothing else. And then, to make it worse, I scared her by simply being there.”
They don’t talk for the rest of the ride to the coroner’s office where Dean introduces them as Special Agents Van Zant and Burns.
“Do you, like, honestly, and don’t make a joke of it again, think we will have this too, one day, get married, maybe have kids?”
They start out sitting but soon, very soon, Dean lies halfway on top of Cas and his eyes roll back in his head when Cas moves his head so he can kiss under Dean’s ear, his neck. He pulls back.
“Thanks for the offer, Balt, but no. Also, I don’t think anyone would’ve bought it. Least of all Rowena.”
They don’t have much for him to put on his sandwich but they bought cheese and ham and that’s perfectly alright to fill his stomach for now.
As it turns out, she helped defeat her brother from the inside, to save this beautiful, unique world, as she claims. The other three archangels are gone again. Somehow, Michael managed to convince the Empty to borrow those three of its possessions for one last fight and helped to make it quiet again and let it go back to sleep. He could convince it that Cas would only cause trouble again so it would let him go for now.
“I’ll also have a few days off and I thought we could have dinner sometime, maybe hit a few bars afterwards—girl’s night out!” she says but Jody doesn’t seem to be too enthusiastic upon the suggestion.
“Well, we haven’t talked in a while. Since, you know, you said Emma’s not my real daughter because I’ve only known her for two years and shit.”
“No,” Dean says and leaves the bed. He grabs the towel hanging by the sink and cleans them real quick.
Dean leans forward, holding onto Cas’s shoulders, thrusting out his ass to give Cas better access, or to get a better angle, it doesn’t matter. Cas is fucking him with his fingers, trying to give his prostate some attention, but not too much, because this isn’t over yet.
“I’m sorry,” Dean says and cautiously moves towards him until he’s close enough to put a gentle hand on the man’s shoulder. “I didn’t mean to freak you out. You don’t have to tell me anything, if you don’t want to. Although I’d really like to help you and it would be easier if I knew your name or what you’ve been up to. Man, I owe you my life. Please, let me help you.”
“Hello, hi. I’m here to see Dean?” Cas says. To be honest, he’s slightly intimidated. That’s why his announcement sounded like a question.
When his work is done, Cas washes the cloth as good as possible, wrings it out again, carefully places it over the edge of the sink and dries his hands with the towel hanging from the hook next to it.
Claire on the other hand seems less worried. “This was awesome,” she says eventually. Both men send her a horrified look. “Whatever…
Dean tells him more about his Uncle Bobby and Cas’s landlord Rufus until he decides it’s time to go and thanks Cas once more for the pizza.
“How about these,” he says but Dean grabs the pair from his hand and sets it back down before Cas can even put them on properly. They’re hideous, like some kind of sport style rip-off with red and yellow glasses.
The bus left at 10 p.m. and soon Cas was lulled to sleep by the vehicle’s steady motion along the road.
“And, honestly, I’m not fully convinced yet there’s actually some sort of ghost in this house. But what I’m sure of is that you’re having some issues right now and you need a friend.”
“No,” she says. “She’s not around anymore. But on certain days when certain conditions apply, it’s easier to get in touch with the spirit world. Samhain for example…or Halloween, as you’d call it. I guess this day getting close is also a reason for why your encounters are rather distinct.”
Cas was aware of Dean turning his head every few minutes, checking on him, and every once in a while he dropped a reassuring pat on his knee.
“Oh no, did the fish at lunch not become you? Yesterday I mentioned to Jackie that I think it’s risky to eat it. You never know how they store it on a ship—lucky we didn’t have any—and when you didn’t show up for dinner…”
“They met a few weeks ago. I don’t think you know him. But I can tell you he’s the worst. He thinks he’s cool and sucks up to me like it’ll help him with mom when I approve of him… I hope he won’t last.”
“So, uh,” he pauses to regain his composure under the three pairs of eyes watching him. “Welcome to the Eldridge Hotel,” he says with a small gesture of his free hand and Meg groans beside him.
Dean turns to Cas and whispers, “When I say ‘run’, you run. I’ll get into the car on the passenger side and slide across the bench. You jump in at the back and stay there and make sure you duck.”
Dean doesn’t know in which room exactly Cas is and he’s not going to look for him. Cas wouldn’t like him snooping around.
It’s idiotic to have fallen for Dean so hard but he can’t alter his feelings about him, no matter how hard he tries. He has to keep it together, though, occupy his mind with more important things like the thin thread his musical career is hanging on to. He can’t fuck up this time and he won’t.
While Sam and Mary do the dishes and clean the kitchen, Dean has moved to the living room sofa and turned on the TV, Blossom lying next to him with her head in his lap. Dean is gently carding his fingers through yellow fur as he’s switching from channel to channel until he sets on the rerun of a football game.
When Cas drives to Dean’s shop for the second time, he, again, isn’t alone. Meg has invited herself along, saying she couldn’t leave all these important decisions about his car to himself. “I love you, but your taste in cars sucks and I can’t risk letting you do this on your own,” she says and Cas gives in without resistance. Any sort of argument with her is pointless anyway.
He sniffed a few times to bring up the courage to tell his mother the truth. “I’m…I don’t want Cas to become a priest, mom. I’m in love with him and I want to be with him.”
Dean spins around. “Really? How come you can’t just buy yourself a Green Card?” He adds a laugh to his question.
“I don’t even know if he’s single…or into guys. I mean, he looked at slave Leia the same way you do!”
“It’s nice to meet you, too,” Dean says and shakes her hand. “I hope Cas has only told you nice things about me.”
“Other people would like to have bacon, too, you know. You always want everything for yourself, don’t you? You don’t give a fuck about anyone else.”
Compared to the limited resources of the people in Apocalypse World, this is an unthinkable luxury. They barely even had access to drinking water, let alone water to shower or at least wash their hands and faces with. Everything there was dirty and smelled. Antiseptics hardly existed anymore, so cleaning an angel-inflicted wound was almost impossible. The lucky ones were those who died on the instant when heavenly armies struck. Getting away with injuries was not the favorable outcome.
Dean pulls back slightly so he can have a look at him. “I’m so proud of you,” he says with sincerity.
“And I’ve made good use of my resources to find out something about this house,” he says simultaneously in two languages.
Cas does his best to change the subject again and they continue to talk for quite a while until Dean asks for the bill and even though Cas insists on splitting it, Dean covers for all their food and drinks.
Later, when Cas goes to bed, everything around him is pleasantly silent and, for once, he’s able to sleep through the night. Maybe moving here wasn’t such a bad decision after all.
“Now,” Cas says as he sits at the glass dining table in the main room and opens a folder. “We have an appointment at the courthouse early this afternoon and we’ve still got a lot of work ahead of us. I already had my papers translated a while ago so we won’t lose time on that. I’d say we start with the basics.”
“Yeah,” Dean breathes. “I am.” He needs to sit before his knees give in. Castiel follows him and takes a seat next to him on the couch.
“When did you change your mind?” Cas asks while neatly putting one of Dean’s plaid shirts on a hanger.
“Because,” Dean says, then looks away, shifting his weight from one leg to the other. When no more words follow, Cas says, “I got a new job.”
Though, when graduation day came, he certainly hadn’t. Dean’s parents and his brother had come to attend the commencement ceremony. They had arrived the night before, Sam moaning about how awful it was to be stuck in car with mom and dad for fifteen hours. “At least I was allowed to drive for three hours,” he said. “And tomorrow we have to go the entire way back again.”
They part awkwardly, Cas taking a step behind, Sam glancing at Dean, expecting him to do something to break the ice.
Sure, he was happy to be here now, but a part of him also questioned why he had even contacted Dean in the first place. They were friends—he knew that for certain now but he couldn’t have counted on him actually wanting to help.
Dean was standing next to him, swaying a little with the baby on his hip. “You don’t look so bad with her either,” Cas said and lightly kissed the girl’s head, then his boyfriend.
“Mr. Novak,” Bela Talbot says, reaching out a delicate arm, diamonds blinking on her wrist. Now Dean understands why Balthazar bolted. He already isn’t much of a fan of hers either.
“It was this,” he says, sneaking an arm under Cas’s shoulder blades and pulls him closer until Castiel’s head rests on his chest.
She excuses herself and gets up to let Sam in. Dean is staring at Cas with fear in his eyes so he leaves the table as well to calm him down.
He reads about how he and dad had the best day ever watching a fight, John bought him a hotdog and soda, and afterwards Gunnar, the champion of the night, gave an autograph session and Dean, bursting with delight, felt like levitating off the ground.
After they’ve eaten, Dean does the dishes and Cas is studying more of his books, this one with particular interest, but he can’t see the cover from afar. When he’s done, he walks over to him, still not done with the book, drying his hand on a kitchen towel. “What you got there?” he says and his jaw drops when Cas shows him.
Dean didn’t answer to that. Instead he said, “The water must be getting cold, and look at your rumpled hands; you should get out of the tub now.” He fetched the towel from the rail and held it spreading it out in front of his body. When Cas stood up, he had the decency not to peep at his friend’s nudity before wrapping the towel around him under his armpits. After he had helped Cas stepping out of the tub, he said, “I’ll be right outside,” and walked into his bedroom.
“That’s me, yes,” Dean says, sniffing at the dark liquid in his glass which causes him to wrinkle his nose.
“Listen, if you wanna leave, I get it. Happens all the time. But don’t pretend you’re interested unless you are.”
He absently reaches out his right hand, his mind preoccupied with the thought of someone else’s misfortune, and hisses in pain as soon as he touches the razor-sharp spot on the damaged mirror. Now this is something he can only blame on his own stupidity, Cas thinks while sucking at his bleeding finger.
“No, it was,” Dean reassures him, “but we can do this anther time. For now, I’d like to kiss you more.”
“Yes, you can. Cas is relaxed, see? Just pay attention to each other’s bodies,” Balthazar says and if there is anyone’s body Dean doesn’t want to pay attention to, it’s Castiel’s.
Dean does the same and the situation feels almost comical to him. They’re like an old married couple. It’s not unpleasant, though.
After they’ve let go of each other, Sam becomes aware of the other people around. Cas is closest, so he starts with him. “You must be Cas,” he says.
“Cas, you’re so hot. Want you,” she breathed against his neck where she had begun to suck at. “Take your shirt off.”
It’s not enough. Dean wants to see him, all of him. But he’s scared. He’s scared he might be turned off and that this might all have been a big mistake.
He willed himself up again to get out of his clothes and crawled under the covers when he had only his underwear left on. Then he picked up his wallet from the nightstand and rummaged until he found what he had been looking for. From a hidden compartment he retrieved a folded, slightly crumpled piece of paper. He opened it and carefully evened the wrinkles with a fingertip. It was the photo of Cas sleeping that Gabriel had sent him during their first spring break in college. The picture had found its way from the pinboard in his room in his parents’ house into his wallet when he’d moved to Kansas City. It wasn’t the same wallet anymore but the photo had remained. Dean was only half aware most of the time that it was there, rediscovering it every time he cleaned out old checks.
“But the thing is, he’s kinda working a job for me right now. I’ll be running into him again sooner or later, even if we’re avoiding each other.”
So what now—Cas has to admit there’s some kind of attraction between them. On a strictly sexual level, of course, and he would be a liar if he said he would entirely object to hate-fucking Dean Winchester, but only that…just working out their occasional aggression towards each other, like, together, the two of them…
“A girl’s eyes were taken after she attended her cousin’s wedding. She even was the one to catch the bride’s bouquet.”
When they got back to their motel room, they crawled into Cas’s bed together, Dean falling asleep being the little spoon. Yes, this was exactly how it should be. He did no longer mind the squeaky noises the bed made in response to every minor movement with his husband at his back. Soon they were going to return to memory foam anyway.
Tango class is also a good opportunity to stay out of Dean’s way. On the sundeck and other places on the ship they’re at constant risk of running into each other and he’s certain this isn’t Dean’s kind of thing at all so he definitely won’t be there.
Therefore, he decided to take a shot at some community college classes. He’s still unsure about what to do with his life which is why he’s now studying all kinds of subjects. He loves history and literature and all that but his favorite so far is woodworking. Apparently, he hasn’t forgotten everything he learned in school, but that’s hardly the reason he has become somewhat of a teacher’s pet. He’s good and he knows it and Pamela, the course instructor, does too.
“Don’t worry about me,” Dean declines. “I’ve got it,” he says and pulls the back of his jacket over his head.
“And you,” he resumes, “you really took the easy way out by saying it and dying right after the words had left your mouth, so you wouldn’t even hear my thoughts on all,” he makes a gesture with his hands, “this.”
“You should get up soon,” Cas said after a few minutes of making out. “We’re having brunch with the girls, remember.”
Cas sighs at the phone in his hand. Dean has warned him that his landlord can be stubborn but he also informed him about his weakness.
Cas just lay there, unmoving, his soiled hand up in the air. He didn’t dare to open his eyes as he listened to Dean’s shuffling around in his room, probably putting his clothes back on. Then Dean took his hand and gently wiped his come off with what Cas supposed was a handful of Kleenex.
“I told you, Cas, I won’t let anything or anyone get to you. Besides, the folks around here are nice. And, no-one knows who you really are anyway, so don’t worry.”
Dean shakes his head, sheepishly running a hand through his hair. “It’s nothing. We just got startled by your knocking.”
“We usually gather passengers who’re travelling on their own at a table together. Of course we can change the seating arrangement if you’re not feeling comfortable with it,” Charlie says.
“You know, it’s weird, seeing you two together,” he said then, looking at Dean and Cas. “I mean, I don’t have a problem with that. Not at all, don’t get me wrong. It’s just…I’d never guessed you’d have a thing for each other.”
When they’ve continued their ride for a while, Dean realizes Athena and Jody have broken the silence in favor of talking. They’re still a bit ahead of him and Cas who has apparently decided they should follow the women’s lead.
“This is looking good; I think it’s done,” Sam says eventually, after some time of sweat-inducing labor under the hot afternoon sun.
“And I won’t disturb you. I’ll just be sitting here, maybe read one of my textbooks while you play. Besides, you’ll have to perform it in front of other people sooner or later anyway. And it’s not like you’ve never had an audience, right?”
Any further explanation on which bride she was referring to wasn’t necessary. Dean knew exactly who wanted to see him. The question only was: what had come up now?
“What was that music before I came in?” He finds it weird that it stopped in the middle of the song.
“Why not?” he asks. “Come on, Cas. I’m sure there’s something I could learn in half an hour or so. I don’t expect any Mozart.”
“Why’re always flattering me?” Dean says, laughing, as he washes his hands after class. “You know I’m a married man.”
Dean starts to panic a little on the inside. Moving to the couch means getting horizontal and getting horizontal means… Not that he’s completely unaffected by their making out. On the contrary.
“Have all of you sat on a horse before?” Athena asks after bringing them to the stables and a staff member, Diego, has already saddled the horses for them.
“Thanks, Castiel,” She hugged him and gave him a peck on his cheek and beamed as she added, “Brother-in-law.”
“What do girls want? I mean what do they like in a guy or a person in general, romantically speaking?”
Dean told her the whole story how he had met Gunnar at the garage and didn’t leave out any detail about his car, despite Charlie’s disinterest. “Come to the fun part,” she said.
“It’s not only that,” Cas resumed. “She’s fallen in love with someone I’m close with. How could they hurt me like this, Father?”
“Dean, ever since this guy showed up at our shop, you were all over him and his car. And after the thing with the British dude you suddenly begged me to take over the job from you, even though you’d known the car much better than I by then and we usually never switch projects when we’re already in the middle of them and I had to figure out all that car’s tiny quirks by myself because you were being a jealous bitch!”
“I don’t know, Cas,” Dean sighed. “Okay, maybe we wouldn’t even live in the same state in the beginning, but we could have tried long-distance.” Cas rolled his eyes at him. “Yeah, I know, but that this didn’t work out for you, doesn’t necessarily mean it wouldn’t have worked for Aaron and I.”
Everyone was cheerful during their boat trip, though Dean was quieter than usual. Cas didn’t seem to notice.
“Well, as it is already my second violation of the bishop’s policy in less than a year and of the same category as my first, despite my clear knowledge of his point of view, he’s putting me on probation until further notice.”
They spend the day like every other day since they came here, even though Sam and Jack have gone on an adventure of their own…which leaves him here with Cas. Cas who, not pausing their routine, begins their lazy beach day with putting cream on his back, and Dean doesn’t admit how much he’s come to enjoy this part of their vacation. Cas has always made sure to take care of him but Dean still doubts he deserves this amount of affection. Today, though, Cas doesn’t seem to stop. If Dean didn’t swat away his hand, Cas would’ve rubbed sunscreen on every inch of his skin and Dean can only accept this much tenderness in a certain period of time.
His husband is wealthy, yes, but would it have been too much to ask to marry someone he has got at least a few things in common with? Fake or not, they still have to live together.
“You always knew, didn’t you,” Michael said to his wife. “You could’ve told me my brother was…you know.”
It frightened him that he had already begun to doubt his decisions. Yet, he wasn’t willing to give up. He was going to fight for his beliefs and he also owed it to himself to, for once, succeed. He was certainly not going back to where he had been before and give into being a failure for the rest of his life.
“Yeah, because he talked me into doing this tonight and now he spends all his time with Charlie while I have to hang out with you.” His breath hitches when he realizes what he just said and starts to mentally prepare himself to die at Meg’s hands.
Dean had a huge grin on his face. “I love you,” he said and, after making sure no-one was around to see, Cas leaned in for a brief kiss.
Dean stands in front of the closed door for a while, considering whether to knock or let Cas sleep over what just happened first.
“I apologize,” she says then, out of nowhere. “You know, a woman travelling on her own, then a guy approaches her… I’ve encountered a lot of douchebags in my life.”
“Because,” Dean yells, slamming his cup onto the counter, tea spilling over. He takes a deep breath and starts over again, more calmly this time. “Because…your husband doesn’t even have a high school diploma.”
“Oh, I miss her, too. But we’re seeing her again very soon,” her wife said and pulled her into a hug.
“Wow, Cas, you’re really showing off today!” Dean said and somehow the angel appeared like he had a flush on his cheeks but this was probably just dirt or rust or lichens.
He and Cas hadn’t made any previous plans to go back home together, sparing Dean the detour to Indianapolis. Apparently, Cas’s parents had bought him a plane ticket but it was one of his new friends who brought him to the airport. Charlie told him that as Dean wouldn’t have known. Usually, when Cas had the opportunity to fly, it was Dean who gave him a lift. This time, though, Cas didn’t ask and Dean didn’t offer.
While Cas was in the shower, Dean took off his FBI outfit, neatly putting it on a hanger. When he added the final layer, his overcoat, something that had obviously fallen out of one of the pockets caught his eye. He picked up the bright pink ball of cloth and realized it was a pair of satin panties. “Where the hell did this come from?” he wondered aloud.
“Did he make you gay?” Mrs. Novak interrupted Dean. “Castiel, is this why you gave up on everything you had here, because your friend seduced you?”
“Mind if I borrow my husband for the next song,” Cas says suddenly. He and Balthazar are standing next to them, waiting for Dean and Rowena to change partners.
“School teaches people things,” Cas says, “although I wasn’t aware that humans dedicate entire buildings to it.” There is an expression of slight confusion on his face.
Anyway, the bath was for nothing. He’s more stressed out than ever when he towels off properly and removes the plug to let the water drain from the tub.
Cas shakes his head. He needs to stop doing this to himself. Those fantasies only increase his suffering. Cas has been in love with Dean Winchester–
“But I have questions…so many questions, Cas. You can never be with someone, romantically or intimately, you can’t decide about your own life, you’ll never have a family of your own. Being a priest means having a lot of restrictions.”
“From the minute that creep walked into my store I knew he was after something for himself,” she said, spitting the words at Cas like venom.
“Blow me, Cas,” Dean says and Cas is quite sure this wasn’t supposed to be taken literally but moves further down anyway.
After their coffee break, he and Balthazar go back to the ballet studio. Balthazar has arranged for him to provide piano accompaniment for his dancers. Cas does it because he wants to work, even though this is a low point for his career. He has played sold out concert halls and now this.
Wide-eyed, Dean gawks at him for a moment. “This is stupid,” he says then and gets on his feet. “Let’s do something else.”
Cas considered it for some time, before he said, “Alright, I’ll ask my mom if she’d like us to come.”
The next afternoon Dean and Charlie walked across the camping site while the others prepared dinner. They hadn’t had any time alone since the morning the day before. “So,” Charlie said, “how long?”
The waitress arrived with her notepad and Dean ordered a cheeseburger. “You’d like to have more toast, sir?” she asked Cas with an sarcastic undertone.
“So,” Dean says, wiping his mouth after the last drink, “you said your brother’s also here. Why didn’t you invite him to come sit with us? I’m sure Sammy wouldn’t have minded.”
He fished his notes out of his breast pocket, took a sip of water and cleared his throat before he began.
Cas lets out a strangled whine when Dean’s fist closes tight around him, his fingers digging deep into the flesh at Dean’s waist. “Shh, it’s okay, my love,” Dean says, moving his hand downwards Cas’s gradually swelling cock. He’s solid now under his touch. He can feel himself getting harder at the realization, unable to restrain his hips from making a slight forward motion, digging into Cas’s thigh. It’s almost too good to be true. He bites at his lower lip, exhaling sharply through his nose. His hand on Cas’s cock moves up again, squeezing the tip, thumb circling on the top, spreading the few droplets that glisten there in the strong beams of the afternoon sun falling through the shades.
“And who knows—maybe something’ll show up on photo,” Charlie says, then, “What next? Should we check out the rest of the hotel? Maybe we catch a ghost in the hallways.”
Dean had come into the dining room and didn’t look happy at all, the beer he was holding presumably the one Cas had been cooling his hand with. “Cas, I promise, we won’t stay longer than necessary. Sorry, mom.”
Moss was growing at the angel’s feet and Dean had some kind of déjà vu that was ruined by the ringing of the phone in his pocket.
Dean took a picture with his phone. Sunset was approaching and the light was perfect; it gave the whole scenery a somewhat romantic atmosphere. He felt nostalgic and sent the image to the first person that came to his mind: Cas.
He gets himself a burger and then another one and finally encounters a few familiar faces and flirts a little with a group of pretty girls over more beer. It’s getting close to midnight and most people have already gathered further away from the festival set-up, waiting for the fireworks to happen.
Dean hesitated before he answered. “I wanted to know if you’d like to be my roommate after college. I don’t know where exactly we’d live, but I just wanted to know if you were even available for the idea. But that doesn’t matter now anyway.”
“What about this?” he says and holds up the ring. “Do you want it to be over? Do you want to get a divorce?”
There wouldn’t be enough time to get dressed before Cas was going to step out, so Dean grabbed the closest thing he could spot and this happened to be Cas’s overcoat which he had thrown onto his bed.
Cas was excited but also stressed out that he hadn’t had time to buy condoms before reaching her house. He felt stupid for his unnecessary worries because he wasn’t actually thinking they were going to have sex right now. This needed preparation.
It was New Year’s Day and Cas had remained in a state of anxiousness throughout the holidays. He had come to the conclusion that he should no longer ponder over all the things that were perturbing him, so he asked Father Jim for a talk.
“Yeah,” Dean says. Sam doesn’t notice that his smile fades right before he brings the glass of coke to his lips. Until right this moment, Dean hadn’t even thought of how he’s going to break it to his little brother that he and Cas are getting a divorce, to convince him that he’s not heartbroken, that everything’s fine and that it was a mutual decision. Hopefully, Cas doesn’t grow too much on Sam.
“Oh,” he exhales. He’s already feeling guilty because he’s, once again, made a fool of himself in front of Jody, and now Captain Hanscum and Charlie and several other people too. “Why didn’t you say anything?”
Meanwhile, Cas has begun to portion the eggs onto plates. He moves for him when Dean opens the cabinet right in front of his head to retrieve a cup for Sam.
Cas gasped, then he said, “Do it,” and Dean leaned down and took him into his mouth. Cas tried to push all is uneasiness down and concentrate the strain in his cock to let Dean make it go away. Dean’s breath was warm on him and the movements of his slick tongue made him gradually loosen up, his hand gently carding through the light strands of hair on his boyfriend’s head. It was incredible how good Dean was at this. Not at giving blowjob—well, that too—, but at relaxing him and convincing him that all would turn out fine with his love and tenderness.
He understands why Dean is angry. He told him not to do anything stupid and he did. As usual, he did it all wrong.
“Always,” Cain says and huffs a laugh, then, “No, but one of my workers just moved away because his wife got a new job in Boston and Ellen sprained her wrist last week so I’m currently low on staff.”
Cas is standing behind her—the real Cas, with eyes and all—, apparently able to see her now, and proceeds to make a move at her with his blade but he can’t withstand her counter attack and is knocked out. Sam, on the other hand, is back in the game now, threatening her with a burning hot poker from the fireplace.
For a couple of times Dean’s eyes drifted off to where Cas was sitting as he stood there, waiting for the brides to arrive. He discreetly examined the way the different outfit suited him. Cas was wearing a charcoal suit and a bright blue shirt, casually without a tie. He was probably sick already of the collar he had to wear day in, day out and was taking the liberty of spending a day without the tightness around his neck. Cas didn’t seem to notice the best man’s eyes on him but Dean realized it was time when Cas turned in his seat to look behind to the entrance. Dean hadn’t even registered the music already playing. The brides entered the ballroom together, walking down the aisle hand in hand—one of the few things Charlie wasn’t willing to leave to tradition. Both looked radiant in their gowns, smiling from ear to ear and Dean knew for sure now he wouldn’t make it through the ceremony without crying. Everything that followed passed in a blur. Between being moved to tears and the irking feeling of Cas’s presence, he almost missed his cue to hand over the rings. But only almost, so no-one should have noticed that his mind had been wandering off.
Cas is playing a gentle, not exactly cheerful, though not sad either, melody with long pauses between notes.
He drops the dead phone again and instead squints his bleary eyes into focus to read the watch that is still on his wrist and groans when he sees how late it is already.
“But that’s not happening any time soon, you know that, Dean. I’ll have to live with this place for a while longer.”
Cas liked this. Mandy’s hair felt like silk under his fingers, her skin was warm and her lips were soft. He could have kept this up forever.
“Well, I’ll take this as a compliment ‘cause I like cats a lot, too,” Cas tells him and walks past Dean inside the building, the dog following him and ignoring Dean completely which makes Cas feel like he won some sort of competition.
“Hey, uh, there’s barely anyone waiting in line right now,” Cas tells Mick then. “I’ll use the opportunity to get us something to drink. I’ll be right back. Behave!”
“I feel a bit gross,” Dean says then, “no offence, though. It’s just, you know, all that stuff in my butt crack.”
He’s been having a hard time keeping it together but as soon as he’s exited the building, he’s bending over, struggling for air. Clearly, this was going to happen, yet it still took him by surprise.
“Sorry,” Cas says but Dean already seems to have adjusted and has loosened around his fingers. He applies more lube and continues to fuck him with his fingers and tongue for some time until he deems Dean able to take more.
Cas pursed his lips. “I didn’t really have friends as a child. At least none that were close enough that I’d invite them to spend the night at my house.”
Dean silences him with a kiss. “Yes,” he breathes and holds out his hand for Cas to put the ring back on his finger where it belongs.
“Okay,” Dean says when he’s found a parking space that’s close to the studio entrance. “Call me when you’re done. I’m gonna stay nearby.”
“No, that I can’t,” Dean says, “but I can tell you when you’re getting on our nerves. So go brush your teeth and then do whatever—in your room.”
“The couple I met at Pastor Boyle’s church. One of them used to be a member of the Catholic Church as well.”
“That’s enough!” Captain Hanscum yells and Dean didn’t think she was capable of such a commanding and intimidating tone. But of course there must have been a reason for her to be captain.
“According to Benny tonight is the game of the century and there’ll be this frat house party afterwards and everyone is supposed to be there.”
At breakfast, Cas is building a big pile of bacon on his plate when the voice of someone he doesn’t need to see this early cuts through the air.
“We don’t know if they are but there has been another incident that happened the night after a wedding which would link it to the first case.”
He had intended to ask Dean what he had planned for spring break but was too afraid to ask, wherefore, the next day he had told Rachel he would accompany them to Virginia.
Dean didn’t understand what his problem was. It was true, yes, they had decided on slowing down on the interval of their jobs, but Dean was itching to go out and kill something. Live as a civilian didn’t suit him. He had spent his entire life as a hunter and he couldn’t just step out of it overnight. He needed time to adjust. Cas nagged him with his worries that one or both of them might die on the job. Well, newsflash, that’s what happens in this line of work. They’d been to Heaven and Hell and back again—literally.
Cas doesn’t know how to word his question. Nervously, his fingers dance over the handlebar. “Nothing. Let’s go.”
Gunnar found a McDonald’s napkin under the seat to clean his hand with and held it out for Dean to put the used condom in. They dressed and put the front seats back into their normal position. Then they headed back to the restaurant for Dean to get his car.
Cain hints at a promise to get in touch and Dean quickly gets through the labyrinth of hallways, back to the foyer, just in time for Cas joining him there.
They then agree to hit the dance floor and Benjamin has got some really cool moves and maybe there are more hands sliding up and down backs and along waists than those moves actually require but Cas is very much into it.
“I think I want to continue listening to your step by step retelling of your vacation now,” he told her, shaking slightly as he spoke.
“Well, Cas didn’t exactly seem happy about this the next day. I wanted to talk about it but he kept avoiding the issue. And, as you possibly remember, we gave each other the silent treatment for a few weeks afterwards.”
“Ugh, Dean, let me make the call first,” Cas said, took off his sunglasses and rubbed a hand over his eyes.
“She was there for his last appointment. She seems to be very much into Benny. Of course she’s barking up the wrong tree with him but he kinda enjoyed being flirted with.”
“I can answer that question for you,” Mrs. Graham suddenly spoke behind them. Dean hadn’t noticed her enter the shop, but he noticed the look Linda gave her husband. It had something of a scolding glare which he knew too well from his husband. “I gave them to her as a thank you for the job she’d done on the catalogue so far,” she explained.
They sit still, quiet, for some time and then, on the other side of the pool, a deer appears from the thicket, wary, but unaware of them. It lowers its head by the pool and starts to drink. Then, suddenly, its head shoots up, looking in their direction. Dean’s eyes keep switching between the deer and Castiel, hoping for him to stay unmoving. The deer goes back to quenching its thirst. After a minute, it’s had enough and vanishes under the shrubs again.
A strange sadness swept over him as he saw what had become of the surely once beautiful angel. Such a shame to neglect it like this, Dean thought.
They talked for a while about other stuff until Dean came home. Charlie stayed a little longer with them and around nine she excused herself. “The wife is waiting,” she told them.
Cas squints as he looks into the sun. “Sometimes I used to mingle with other merfolk but I don’t even remember how long ago that was. We didn’t talk much, however. Talking would have required coming to the surface and most of them refrained from doing so. You never knew what lay beyond the waters, the great unknown.”
“So, what’s this rhyme anyway? We should try to find out if Tanya said it too,” Dean says. “Won’t be so easy though, considering how weirded out by Cas she was.”
Cas kisses him again, hungry, not yet satisfied. Dean isn’t either and he thinks he never will be. He will never have enough of this now that he’s finally,
“You still haven’t answered my question,” Cas said after a few minutes of silence. “Will you still be wearing panties?”
“What do you even have in there?” Dean asks. “That thing is huge. Are you planning on moving in with us? I thought you’re only staying a couple of days.”
“Yes, and it was wrong,” she said insistently, glaring behind her back at Dean. “You should have been able to tell me yourself,” she told Cas.
“I mean the way he talks about him and how he talks about the two of you. He always calls Cas ‘your roommate,’ like he doesn’t even wanna remember his name.”
The Kline’s are nice but Cas doesn’t feel comfortable with how attached to him they seem to have gotten already. Therefore he’s glad when two more people join their table.
“I’ve done it, too, you know, the wall thing,” he murmured into his pillow and Dean pulled Cas even closer against him and soon they fell asleep like this, free to touch this time, without a wall or any other restraints keeping them apart.
“So,” Dean started. “I know you don’t like to talk about this, but I’ve been wondering if you got any plans for after graduation. I mean like living arrangements for example, you know.”
“Relationships don’t always have to end in a disaster. If you’re still getting along then why shouldn’t you try to be friends?”
He looked over to his friend who was still avoiding his gaze. “Dean,” he said as he strode forward. “Please look at me,” he pleaded and carefully reached out a hand for Dean’s arm. There was a slight jerk in response to the touch. “Dean, I am going to do this, whether you agree or not. But I’d much rather stay friends with you.”
Benny moans but takes the glass anyway and empties it in one long gulp. When he goes to return the glass and get a proper drink instead, he, of course, bumps into Cas again. This club really isn’t big enough for the both of them.
“Yeah, I got a terrible headache and had to cancel. Sorry you went there only to find out we weren’t gonna dance.”
Lying on his fuzzy bedside rug made his head spin more than when he’d been sitting upright and Dean rocking his hips in a rhythm with his hand did nothing to ease his dizziness. He hadn’t noticed himself beginning to hump against thin air but Dean obviously had and nudged a knee between his legs to provide him with friction.
Of course, Sam had asked Dean to be his best man and he would be the first to be informed as soon as he and Eileen had found a date so he could book a flight out to California.
“I like it,” Dean says while gently checking out smooth edges, feeling the wood under his fingers that Cas once shaped with his own two hands and a shiver runs down his back as Dean does so.
“You’re right. Other people’s sex noises aren’t funny at all,” Dean said, trying to maintain a serious face. “We should give them a taste of their own medicine.”
When Cas doesn’t respond or even dare to move, Dean’s fingers find the lapels of Cas’s coat. “Did you hear me, Cas?” he says.
Aaron moved his own hips up a few times more until he came too and then carefully pulled out his finger. “So, can I fuck you next time?” he asked.
They had spent the rest of the day cuddled up in comfy clothes on the living room couch, kissing, occasionally paying attention to the TV, kissing some more and just holding each other and repeating love confessions over and over again.
So, whatever, time to study. He won’t be able to face his college student brother ever again if he fails his GED.
Cas has long stopped pretending. Except, if pretense is all he can get from Dean, then so be it, if only for tonight.
“Oh, he is more of a city person, you know. He only came here because I asked him to. But I, on the other hand, am thrilled to be here. There’s so much exploring to be done, out in the nature. You’ll never know what you might stumble across.” There’s a twinkle in his eye, whitened teeth flashing in the poor light. “And what are you doing out here, all by yourself? Taking a swim?”
“Quit the jokes, please,” Cas says and shoves the hand off his shoulder. “This is not funny. Never was. I’m not into her and she probably only dreams of me in the context of murdering me in my sleep.”
“Castiel, I can see how much you’re hurting. Talk to your friend,” Father Jim advised him once again.
“Gladly, I could take off my shoes and pants before ripping them apart with my tail. I hid them and myself under the bridge.”
“What? Claire, no, I wasn’t drunk. And I didn’t get sick from just a few beers.” He turns the key in the ignition and the engine comes to life. “You should be careful what you’re implying there.”
As he does so, Castiel doesn’t dare to look Dean in the eye but he can feel his burning gaze. He hears Dean’s little gasps every time the washcloth touches his skin anew and he only so much sees that his mouth is slightly open. Mainly his eyes are fixed on the spot where the stab wound used to be.
He’s about to walk away again but Dean catches his arm. “Cas,” he says, looking deep into his eyes, searching.
On the way he bought some pie from a bakery Gabriel has recommended to him a while back because Dean mentioned he likes pie and Cas can’t bake and getting him pie is the least he can do to thank him. He also got a bottle of red wine because they didn’t get to spent their evening as planned yesterday and he wants to make up for it.
“This house, it’s just too big. All the empty rooms… It makes me feel lonely. When Blossom is here, I feel a little bit better, but you, my boys, you’re grown men, you don’t live here anymore and no-one ever stays here overnight. Except for the holidays, maybe. And this place is just too much work. I can’t afford to pay a handyman for every little thing that breaks.”
“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” every word accentuated by a random slam onto the keys. Then, with a bang, he crashes down the lid and buries his face into his hands. They’re vibrating from the force he hit the keyboard with and the piano itself resonates with an irritated, metallic sound.
“Pass,” Sam says and of course he does. He didn’t stay a moment longer than necessary after finishing school.
Castiel looked at him with kind eyes. They looked more alive than ever before but, of course, they weren’t. They couldn’t be.
Dean leaned over for a quick sniff, telling him, “You’re good. Just wash up real quick and put on some cologne.”
“Dean, are you okay?” Cas rushes towards him but he’s already resurfaced when he gets there. “I’m so sorry, Dean,” Cas apologizes when Dean wipes his wet hair out of his face. “I didn’t mean to alarm you. I was worried because you’ve been out here for quite a while and I don’t want you to get sunburnt.”
“He said things like Emma isn’t even like my real daughter because I haven’t seen her grow up. I just,” he balls his hands into fists, “this made me so, so angry, and then I snapped.”
Cas looked around after entering the arrival hall, seemingly a little lost, but then he spotted Dean and their eyes met. He was in full clerical get-up—black shirt, jacket and pants, plus the collar. Dean had a hard time keeping the pace of his breathing steady. He had never seen Cas like this and up until now hadn’t been able to actually imagine Cas in that kind of outfit either. Despite the shock, Dean noted that Cas looked good. Black suited him and he was in good shape, as far as Dean could tell with all that fabric covering him. He had a nice haircut—only slightly differing from the one he used to wear—and his eyes were as blue as Dean had remembered. Those were currently staring at him with intent.
“Warm some of it up between your finger, then start carefully pressing one in. I’ll tell you when you can add a second finger.”
“By the end of this vacation I want you two to have cut the crap and settled this stupid dispute. So neither of you is getting this promotion. End of story. This ship has sailed. Get over it. And I know there’s more to what you’re willing to admit. You like each other so grow some balls and talk about it.”
Asking seems so easy in theory but the request doesn’t make it past his lips. All that comes out is a feeble sigh.
“I thought so,” she says and then, with a bright smile, she adds, “you all look very much alike. Have a nice stay.” Sam takes their keys from her with an awkward smile upon her comment and after being informed their rooms are on the second floor, they head upstairs.
“Call me around lunchtime,” he says before pushing the pedals and heading down the road. Cas’s heart leaps in his chest when Dean casts a last look over his shoulder.
“Yeah, we were roommates during college and a few years after as well.” Dean nods. “Anyway, we gotta go now. It was nice seeing you again, Dean. We’ll talk.”
He tries to stop it, switch to the next track. When nothing works he simply pulls the iPod off the docking station but the song
How would he even contact Dean? He didn’t have his phone number, nor his address—not that he was planning to show up at his house unannounced. Yet, he knew the name of the company Dean was working at. He googled it along with Dean’s name but didn’t find his particular number, so he just called the front desk. After having been transferred back and forth from one department to another and explaining who he was and why he was calling, he finally reached Dean’s personal line.
Cas is taking pictures of their horses and the scenery. Dean can’t image anyone would like to see those because it’s just grass and sky. Then he attempts to take a selfie standing by his horse but it doesn’t seem to turn out as he’d wished.
Cas was panting into the crook of his neck and Dean sensed he was getting close, so he reached between them and fisted his cock, jerking himself in time with Cas’s thrusts.
But he was dead. They had accepted this and, fortunately, didn’t take any foolish risks to bring him back. They couldn’t have done it anyway.
"Cas, uh," he's scared to look Cas in the eye when he speaks. "What you said when, uh, when, you know... Did you mean it?"
“I don’t want to be a burden,” Cas spoke as if the plain idea of accepting Dean’s offer caused him discomfort.
On his way back to the parking lot, he saw the angel again and remembered what he’d intended to do when Sam had called the last time he was here.
Dean’s spinning the glass between his hands. He has barely touched his drink yet. It needs to last because he’s fucking broke and not even sure he’s got enough cash to pay for this one. He sighs.
“Of course, she is. We’ve talked about this and she said if I wanted to I could. We both just want our daughter to be happy. And it’s just the car. I won’t be paying for insurance or anything.”
they were doing—he wasn’t stupid. But when he had seen Dean back then, sitting on his bed, without his clothes on, Aaron buckling up his belt as he walked out of Dean’s room…the sight of it had hurt somehow. He lacked a better word to explain the feeling. Maybe he was being unfair. Honestly, he didn’t like Aaron that much either. Anyhow, his opinion didn’t count here. Only Dean’s.
Dean comes back close again, cautiously laying his arms around Cas’s shoulders. “We had a great time together, didn’t we? Just think about last night.”
“Everything’s fine. Cas, come here, say hi to my dad,” Dean said and Cas carefully walked up to them.
There is no reason for them to kiss now, of course. Balt and Rowena bought their story without any mouth-to-mouth action involved. They seemed impressed even that Cas would go as far as touching anyone simply for the intimacy of it, their ice prince, though people who don’t know Cas, like Sam, might need more to convince them. The DSS didn’t. Kissing would only have made them suspicious.
“Uh, you know, I’m broke and homeless which is why I’m getting married to some Polish guy as a fraud.”
While Claire organizes a drinking glass from the cabinet and draws something on a piece of paper, Dean asks Cas about her unscheduled visit.
Dean went to the end of the hallway to his own room and looked down to Cas’s, somehow hoping he would return outside to look at him once more. He waited for a minute but Cas didn’t show.
“Oh, Dean!” He hadn’t thought Dean would take this so seriously. “I only said this to hurt you back then. You’re looking good, really.”
“Okay,” Cas says, huge eyes looking at him and making him feel all cozy and warm, begging Dean to spare a kiss and Dean’s entire body urges him to give in but, of course, he can’t.
“You guys wouldn’t even have noticed if the house had been on fire,” he said. “Cas couldn’t handle his booze that well, so we left.”
Cas tells himself. An endearing one, though. Yet, to be completely honest, he’s not sure he could really act on it if the opportunity ever arose but pondering over the idea is quite enjoyable…until he sobers up and realizes how fucked up this is. Cas is someone who isn’t able to easily separate sex from feelings; he could never become intimate with Dean.
Dean shakes his head and lets out a small whine. An array of scenarios flashes through his brain as he thinks of what’s going to happen if he actually did not pass. He doesn’t want either of them to be disappointed. Sam will probably encourage him to just try again. Cas will feel more superior to him than he already does. Dean’s failure will confirm that he married the dumbest fuck in America.
They’re watching him through the window of Jody’s office door. The man is now dressed in clothes from the department’s lost and found box: gray sweatpants, a T-shirt that is much too big on him and two unmatching flip-flops, only one of which is actually his size. He’s looking around curiously but remains sitting on the chair opposite Jody’s desk as he was told to. He obviously understands what they’re saying but hasn’t spoken a word of his own yet.
“I like you, okay,” he says, after a while, fake annoyance swinging with his voice. “I think you’re cool.”
“Hey, Benny,” she tells the bartender after they’ve taken a seat at the counter of the Captain’s bar, “can I have a glass of your special for my guest here, please.”
“No, no, absolutely not. I was just thinking about how I used to take Claire to the arcade on Second Street when she was little. You know that one? Though, I think it’s been shut down since then,” Cas says, abruptly starting to stir his coffee for no reason and hoping they haven’t changed the subject since the last time he actually listened.
Dean was longing for his bed but he also didn’t want this night to end yet. Cas didn’t move to open his door either. They kept staring at each other for what couldn’t have been more than a few seconds but felt like forever. Dean recalled the moment from before when Cas had touched his arm and was suddenly craving for more. Just one more touch. His lips felt dry and rough from the exhaustion and the alcohol rushing through his veins, so he licked them, without taking his eyes off Cas.
“Have you ever looked in a mirror? Yes, you are.” Right after she’d said that Dean entered the room.
Ms. Talbot lets out a fake laugh. “Mr. Novak, please, you know why. You’re the reason everyone came here tonight. Everyone was curious to see what has become of you, whether you’d succeed or…else.”
Cas pulls back his head to look at him. “Then what about this?” he says, presenting the ring once more.
“Tomorrow is Saturday. We won’t have to leave the bed for the entire day,” Dean said, cocking an eyebrow and hauled the covers over them when he had cuddled up against Cas’s side.
They finish their donuts in silence. Then, while she wipes her uniform clean with a napkin, she asks, gesturing him to sit, “So, what’s been eating at you?”
“I believe you, Dean,” the sheriff says, “still, there’s no sign of him. We need to face the facts. His body might wash ashore in a few days if the current doesn’t carry him elsewhere.”
“I promised Emma to help her find a car. I’ve got a few in my yard that could work for her. They’re old but in good shape and I’d rather she get one from me than buy some over-priced piece of crap that’ll need fixing a week later.”
“Cas,” Dean said loudly, his voice echoing from the walls. They had been avoiding certain matters long enough.
Sam stirs his coffee. “So, does this mean you’ll move into Cas and Jack’s room for the rest of our stay?”
“I’m good, thanks,” he says. “Let’s just hope he’s getting tired soon. Hearing this song in an endless loop is kinda annoying.”
A shadowy figure is lurking in the dark alleyway behind a row of trashcans. Rustling comes from deep inside one of those, probably a raccoon. Something’s stuck to his sole and he tries to wipe it off on the ground. It stinks here. This was supposed to be an adventure but he’d rather have one less smelly and without the threat of rabies infested vermin nearby.
“Anyway, I have to go now. I’m having brunch with Jess,” Sam said. “Have a nice wedding!” They said goodbye and hung up.
“Stressed, on vacation? Oh, that’s not good, Castiel. Is it too loud in your cabin? Or are you seasick sometimes? Are you actually afraid of the ocean?”
“Because it’s only in our heads,” Cas says. “That’s why you and Rufus couldn’t hear anything the other day when this happened to me the first time.”
Cas bites his lip. He loves that kid so much. “You’re cool, too,” he says. The light turns green and he puts his foot back on the gas.
“Oh, that’s really kind of you, Sam,” Cas says. “But I’m afraid I have to decline. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to meet up with my ensemble for practice.”
Every now and then the combination of a bubble bath, a scented candle, some indie folk music and maybe a book—but a fiction one, anything else would be work—is exactly what Sam needs. What he needs to come down, to not lose his mind. Again.
“Oh, well, that’s nice. Anyway, I gotta finish my round now. Still a few tables to go. It was great seeing you again, Jodes. Have a good journey,” Donna says. “I’ll do my best bringing you to Uruguay in one piece. No icebergs, I promise,” she says, fingers crossed. “See you around!”
Nice ass guy had been waiting behind his back and yelled, “Where’re you going?” as he ran off. Dean didn’t answer. His best friend needed him.
Dean headed upstairs to his hotel room and stuffed his few belongings in a duffel bag and put the smoking back on its hanger. He grabbed the photo from the nightstand and, after a second of hesitating, balled it up and threw it in the trash can.
“We can make it out through the woods,” he says. “There’s an old footbridge. We cross the river. You can hide there when you turn. I’ll make my way back into town by myself and get help.”
“So, I was thinking,” Dean says when they’ve stopped kissing, yet just a few inches away from Castiel’s lips, “how about that new Italian place downtown?”
He pulls the pillow over his head and falls asleep again only to be woken up by Sam slapping his ass with a towel.
“Yeah, I like it, too,” Dean says and walks over to him. “Have you read H.P. Lovecraft?” The guy frowns. “No? Well, you should. If you’re into that kind of thing, that is.”
“So,” Charlie says and puts down her glass, “what’s the issue with you and…his name is Dean, right?”
As they entered the living room, Dean was lying on the couch, Aaron on top of him between his legs and they were kissing lazily.
His eyes are moving back and forth between Dean and Sam who eventually takes his cue and leaves the room, signaling Annabel to follow him.
“I know this one,” Dean says then, astonished. He’s never actively listened to this kind of music, yet he’s certain that he’s heard this song before.
“That’s no excuse,” she says while Dean slips out of his shoes. “Now, would you please be so kind and tell me why none of my sons is talking to me.”
“That’s because I was almost buried under a stack of chairs.” Dean’s eyes still bore into him, pushing deeper. “I’m fine,” Cas insists and flees to one of the chairs lined up against the wall. One should think he’s having enough of chairs for a while but he just wants to sit down a bit and the floor doesn’t appear too welcoming. Meg has already reconquered her spot on the bed next to Charlie.
“Oh, so sorry to hear that. Always dreamt of catching bad guys doing illegal stuff, you know,” Captain Hanscum informs Dean. “So, what are you then?”
Dean won’t give up what they had so easily. Even if it means losing all his dignity, he’ll at least try to save this. “Cas,” he says.
Dean’s sight was already blurred by tears. “Just…get here,” he said and enveloped Cas with his arms. A shaky inhale gave away that he had begun to cry.
“We know nothing for sure yet, ma’am,” Dean said. “However, we have order to investigate. Maybe their death’s happening so close timewise is a coincidence but we have to make sure in order not to risk any other lives.”
“Do you understand now why you needed to learn the places I’ve lived before coming here?” Cas says when they’re finally on their own.
“Honestly, though,” Rowena says then, “I’m surprised he isn’t another musician. Or do you play any instruments, Dean?”
Cas wonders how much more he can drink to maintain the right balance between a numbing buzz and the level of intoxication that’ll make him embarrass himself. He hates it here. Everyone seems to be having a good time but him.
Cas rolled off of him when his softening dick had slid out of Dean and Dean thought he could possibly hear his heartbeat if his own heart wouldn’t be drumming so loudly inside his ears as well.
“Good, I guess. We’re skyping at least once a week and we’re texting quite a lot. Mostly about school stuff though.”
“You cooked?” Sam asks. Dean already told him that Cas’s lack of talent or motivation in the kitchen is hopeless and this is how the lie of Dean working as a cook for a rich man came to be.
Everything seems to look the same on the Hunter deck but Dean finds his way easily, thanks to numerous signs, and has soon reached his inside cabin. Although he doesn’t have ocean view, it’s quite nice and big enough for one person to stay in for a few days. He won’t be spending too much time in here anyway.
When they finally had the house for themselves, Dean showed Aaron how much he had missed him. He showed him with his hands, with his mouth, with his cock. He caught himself thinking that his father would be furious if he knew what his son was doing right now…which was actually a redundant thought as John was certainly very aware of this. A tiny part of his brain called him out on the likelihood that he hadn’t so much asked Aaron to come to Lawrence so that he could spend time with his boyfriend, but rather as an opportunity to annoy his homophobic dad. But that part was clearly stupid and should better shut up. Because Dean had missed his boyfriend who he…was very fond of. Okay, to be honest, he had also missed a cock in his ass. Aaron’s cock, just to be clear.
Cas crouches next to him, holds him. “It can’t be,” he says but Dean can barely hear his own thoughts over that painful noise.
Again, he seized the waistband with his teeth, this time pulling it down and releasing Dean’s throbbing erection. The fine material was still covering his balls, though, and Dean was thankful for it not being removed completely.
Michael sighed before looking at him. “I’m rather disappointed that you left without telling any of us. We’re your family, Cas. And you just took off. I had to explain to the kids why Uncle Cas was gone all of a sudden and they couldn’t see you anywhere at church.”
She’s a friendly looking blond woman, coming closer and shaking his hand. “It’s so nice to meet you. Dean has told me a much about you,” she says and Cas frowns at Dean.
The hair at his neck is standing upright, cold sweat dampens his hands when he realizes one other, very important thing: No-one else knows he committed a crime.
Cas finds it hard to fall asleep. He’s not used to having someone next to him at night. Dean’s breathing evened out a while ago, leaving Cas to be the only one awake. From time to time there are small noises coming from the other side of the bed, little snorts but no actual snoring.
“You mean staying home alone and geeking out over books? Sure,” Dean huffs and Alicia lets out an amused laugh out through her nose.
“Annabel,” he says with determination in his voice and the dog lays off enthusiastically greeting Cas. “Good dog,” he tells her and the golden retriever comes to stand by his side, expectantly waiting for what comes next.
Dean furrows his brows. “Stop reading my mind, Cas. You know I don’t like you snooping around in there. It’s called privacy.”
“So, uh,” Dean resumes their conversation from earlier, “I’m curious, I really gotta ask, what’s the deal about you and Meg being exes and, you know, that other dude.”
“Hi, uh, buongiorno,” he greets the bored looking woman at the reception. “We don’t have a reservation but do you happen to have two rooms for us?”
Carefully, he draws back his hand, stroking his wet fingers along Dean’s cheek and jaw and pulls him into another kiss.
Dean spotted Cas on the other end of the room. He was talking to a girl who was practically hanging on his lips. She appeared to be really into him and Cas didn’t look nervous at all when she playfully tipped his party hat to the side of his head.
And there he is again, really, really close in front of his face, nose to nose. Dean feels trapped and intimidated and slightly aroused—must be the alcohol in his system—and when Cas’s eyes flick down for a brief moment he’s getting goosebumps.
“Please,” she says, placing a hand above her heart, “it is an honor to host our town’s most talented artist in my humble business.” Her overly dramatic speech evokes a laugh from Dean.
The break only lasts briefly anyway, and Dean is confused that Cas is not with the returning musicians. Scared, he casts Rowena a look but she leans over and, whispering, explains there’s no piano in this one.
“Dean, seriously, stop it,” and he does. They continue to watch Benny and Andrea for a while, until Sam resumes, “Can I ask you something?”
“Rufus?” Cas asks, slightly confused, until something dawns on him. “Oh, you mean Mr. Tuner. You know him?”
“Maybe,” Cas says, watching the reflection of the fireworks in his eyes. Mick smiles, slowly leaning in.
“Captain Donna Hanscum, at your service,” she laughs and does a small salute. “You know me, always loved the sea.”
Cas was really stiff, frowning uneasily, and only stood there at first but then Dean gripped his hips, swinging him from left to right until a cautious smile appeared on his face and he eventually started to dance on his own. Dean, Cas and the girls were all close together, Dean spinning around either of them from time to time. Everyone was having a good time and even Cas appeared to be happy right now, not thinking about people’s eyes on him anymore that might judge his style.
“Yes, I’m still at Dean’s. Oh, I, he’s fine, I guess,” he said, facing Dean now with a questioning expression. Dean nodded to signal him he was indeed alright. “Uh, yes, he’s fine…yeah, I’ll tell him that…mhm…I don’t know, it’ll take some time I’d say.”
“Cas, what’s going on? Why are you here? And why do you look like you’ve seen a ghost?” Dean has taken a seat next to him.
“You do,” Sam insists. “And I just wanted you to know that I’m cool. You might consider getting me an extra great Christmas present but I’m not mad. I mean, of course I would’ve liked to be at your wedding and I’m a little bit hurt that you didn’t ask me to be your best man but…we’re good. So, you don’t need to hold back. Act naturally around me.”
He was a little early but one never knew what might be coming up—especially when it was Charlie Bradbury’s wedding. Sure, the timeline had been laid out to perfection in advance, but during the time Dean had spent assisting the planning process he had realized that nothing was ever certain with his best friend in charge.
Being with you was the only thing I ever wanted and you keep on trying to ruin this for me by attempting to kill us with your stupid hunting.”
“I don’t know. For one, he didn’t want to join us for dinner. And he was tense all the time like he couldn’t wait to get away.”
“It’s good to see you, too,” he said. “Father, this is my friend Dean,” Cas introduced them and they shook hands.
He and Sam talk it out for a minute. There isn’t much to say. They’re fucked either way so they might as well trust the archangel who intended to kill them all those years ago. And then there might even be a possibility that—no, Dean can’t got there. He needs to focus now.
Cas was very enthusiastic to tell Dean everything he had learned during his visit to the seminary and stories Father Jim had remembered when he came back to this place that had once been his home. Sure, Dean was glad his friend was so cheerful about the experience, but he still couldn’t imagine him actually going there and eventually becoming a priest. He wanted Cas to succeed, of course, yet the prospect left a better taste in his mouth and a heavy feeling weighing in his gut. A part of him was still hoping that Cas would change his mind.
“I am,” Cas says and Dean realizes his hand is resting on Cas’s hip, just where fish scales and skin begin to blend into each other. Quickly, he draws it back.
During breakfast Cas was nowhere to be seen. Dean asked around a little if anyone had seen him up yet but no-one could help him. When we had emptied his coffee, he went back upstairs to knock at Cas’s door. There came no answer.
Like you needed to continue this sham even behind closed doors to be close to me. I’m not pretending, just so you know. My feelings for you are real.” Cas feels naked, vulnerable now that it’s out. Dean could crush him with his pinky finger if he wanted to.
Cas takes another sip from his bottle before he replies, “I’ve put up with my current living situation. Though, I have to admit, with all the noises such an old house makes, it’s a bit scary at night.”
Cas smiles back at him. They’re already standing next to each other, but then Cas leans over and Dean is caught off guard when he kisses him. No, the most notable thing isn’t the kiss itself. They need to let Sam know that they’re an actual couple, affection and all. It’s the quality of the kiss. Not measuring the pressure or moistness or use of tongue—there is no tongue. It’s how soft yet firm it is and how long it lasts. Not long. Still, it’s much more than a quick peck. And Dean is confused.
“Then he was just very good at faking that he’s not an emotionless dick. You’re different,” Dean says, his hand finding his way onto Cas’s shoulder. “I’m glad you are. You care about other people’s feelings—just show them, don’t hold it back. Just be you.”
“That’s not true, Cas,” Dean said and shook his head. “You wanna know what I’m actually thinking? That you hate me enough that you think you have to do this.” Dean had a big lump in his throat and the thought of Cas doing this to him, of choosing this of all the possible ways to repel him, hurt so fucking much.
“They’re right,” Dean said. “Maybe we should get to our room. We still have enough time before dinner.”
He’s so mad at himself, he grips the bars of his cell hard until his knuckles turn white and screams. He screams until his human vocal chords are sore but it’s not enough.
“Why are you telling me this now?” he asks. “Why are you here? Something must have happened. You obviously weren’t arrested, so I guess your cover hasn’t been blown.”
Cas abruptly leaned back. “You brought lube? Were you actually expecting us to fuck at my parents’ house?”
“Dean, I’m not angry. Just upset that you didn’t tell me sooner.” He bit the inside of his cheek. “Am I the only one who was left out on this?”
“It’s nice to meet you too. Dean has told us so much about you,” Mary said as she welcomed Charlie in their house.
Right when they come in, there’s a round, slightly elevated booth, clad in dark wood paneling. In it sits Sam, his face highlighted by the shine of a lamp on his desk, the computer to his right a stark contrast. He looks up when he hears the echo of their footsteps on the stone tile floor.
“Okay,” she said and gently pushed him back against the kitchen counter. “I have to go. Have fun tonight and don’t worry too much about your speech. You can do it!”
Dean let Cas drive all the way back. When they got home late at night, they held each other as they lay in bed, Dean carding his fingers through Cas’s hair and telling him without words that everything would turn out fine. And Cas believed it. If John Winchester could change his opinion on this, then his mother and brother could, too.
During dessert Dean sees a woman in uniform making her way around the room, politely greeting the passengers and talking to some of them for a little while. When she finally arrives at their table, she says, “Heya! May I introduce myself, I’m Captain Hanscum. I have the pleasure to safely guide this ship to Montevideo.”
“Stop it. He’s handsome and I wouldn’t object to dating him but, like you said, we barely know each other and we’re in a business relation.”
Cas’s big hand wraps around his head. Then, his back arches off the mattress, accompanied by a pull at Dean’s hair and a long, loud moan, he spills over Dean’s hand and cock, sending an intense and final pulse through him before he follows Cas into oblivion.
“Oh, he ordered wine. Thinks he’s better than me because he knows something about wine. As if he’s superior to me because I’m having beer.” Jody’s hand lands on Dean’s.
Then Dean walks away and for a moment Cas isn’t quite sure if he understood him correctly but when Dean drops a bill into the musician’s hat, Cas’s assumption is confirmed.
“Thanks for the coffee,” Cas says like he knows what’s going on in Dean’s head right now and goes back to sit at the table with the others.
“So,” Cas says after a moment of silence, “can you recommend a place for horseback riding and do you know how I get there from Montevideo?”
“Fuck yeah!” Dean moaned and Gunnar, in response, pulled him down the length of the backseat until Dean’s upper body was lying flat, his knees bent at the end. With a lot of unwieldy shifting Gunnar got rid of his pants. He quickly removed a lubed condom from its wrapper and rolled it over Dean’s cock. He sunk down slowly, letting out a sigh and Dean exhaled a ‘Fuuuck!’ at the tight sensation that Gunnar’s asshole was, hands clasping at the backrest and bench. It was so completely different from sex with Lisa, he thought, but not any less arousing.
“The job always benefits from co-workers getting along,” Jody continues. “I’m confident you won’t disappoint me and will work on getting over your issues, am I right?”
“Sure. There’s more female population on campus to be explored,” Charlie said as she climbed over the backrest of the sofa Dean was sitting on and sunk lazily into the cushion next to him.
Already reaching around but stopping right before touching him, Cas says, “May I?” and Dean gives him an encouraging nod.
“Before you, no-one would ever listen to me like this. You never talk back or complain… I wish you were, you know, a real boy.” The chuckle that followed sounded forced and sad.
Michael shrugs. “While I was in the cage, I’ve had some time to think, all the while I had good company. Turns out I’m not.”
Pastor Boyle showed Cas around and endorsed him to tell him a bit about himself. Cas hesitated, unsure whether to adjust the truth a little, but opted for being an open book to his fellow churchman, though being from a different church. They were all Christians anyway.
When it’s time, Dean drives them down to the beach. They agreed to do this here. The far end, so he thought, would be hidden enough from curious eyes, behind a few tall rocks. Hardly anyone ever goes here and certainly not this time of day. They are on their own, just the two of them.
Dumbstruck, Cas takes him in. Dean’s actually gone back to mall to buy the outfit Emma had picked out for him. Because Cas said he liked it.
Dean is thankful for the drink in his hands now. It’s not that he doesn’t like Sam’s friends but he never really clicked with them.
“Why do you assume it was a girl? You know I’m bi, it could’ve also been a boy,” Dean replied rudely.
The tip of his tongue pokes out between his lips again. He looks at the framework, then at Cas’s sketches in his hands, then at Cas. Cas stares back at him.
Dean had originally furnished the room with only two threadbare, suspiciously smelling recliners but Mary had insisted he throw them out and replace them with a sofa. “You realize there are more than two people living here?” she’d said. That was the whole point, Dean had later confided in Cas. Movie nights were supposed to be just for the two of them but he had to admit that this was awfully selfish and eventually came to the conclusion that family movie nights where actually a nice thing.
“I missed you. As soon as I woke up and realized you weren’t there, I wanted to find you and get you back in my arms and kiss you and forget how we even got into this marriage. I was hoping you’d ask me to never leave you again.”
Father Jim put a hand on Cas’s shoulder before replying, “I understand. Do you think you’ll get over this any time soon without making your work suffer under your issues?”
“Dean, do you even hear yourself? I get that you had feelings for him when we were in college and wished for something like this to happen, but it never did. You just imagined that Cas felt the same way about you. Otherwise something would have happened, I’m sure. And you never told him you loved him, right? So why would he act like that now? You were probably just tired and drunk.”
Then, Ketch turns his attention towards the tub where Cas sits, unmoving, probably paralyzed with fear. Dean wants to tell him that everything is going to be fine, though it arguably doesn’t look good right now.
Cas is running, as far as their off-trail route allows it. “Wait,” Dean calls after him, trying to catch up, “don’t hurt yourself. We’ve got plenty of time.”
“No,” Cas says. “Actually, it’s our first wedding anniversary but there’s also something else we have to celebrate.”
“No, you don’t understand me. It’s not his fault! He always encourages me in everything I do and—” His voice cracked. “I feel like I don’t deserve him.”
“I tried, really. But you’ve seen her. The sun basically shines out of her ass. I didn’t want to upset her by calling her off.”
Now Dean is on his back and Cas above him. Something cool drops onto his thigh. He sighs. There’s no way he’s getting up now, so he reaches over the bed, finding the boxers he slept in last night and wipes away the consequence of their release, disposing it on the floor when he’s done.
“Yeah, people can be dicks. But around here, most of them are really friendly and kind. You don’t have to worry about anyone.”
Their room was Cas and Ishim’s old one which meant that Dean now lived in the same building as Charlie. Cas turned out to be pretty orderly. He kept his side of the room tidy, he didn’t snore—unlike Benny—and in the morning he was the grumpiest person Dean had ever seen. He learned soon enough that he shouldn't try to talk to him during the first hour after waking up when he didn’t want to be confronted with Cas’s dark side. Dean had started to refer to morning-Cas as Palpatine which made said person furious every time he heard the nickname. Yes, they were having the time of their life together.
They were standing right in front of Hudson Hall, kissing and completely lost in their own world. Cas’s hands slid lower onto Dean’s butt and Dean was holding him by the back of his head.
Dean hugs her tightly and Cas is a bit caught off guard when he begins to gesticulate his hands and fingers at her and she cheerfully salutes him, brushes her palms together and then touches her fingertips after what was probably their introduction.
With a toast to everyone involved, Cas is released from stage and Dean almost breaks his glass, quickly as he puts it down, and hurries to get to Cas.
Cas felt bad for listening in but even if he went to his own room, he would still hear them and he didn’t want to go anywhere else. If Aaron was actually going to break up with Dean over this, he would need Cas to comfort him afterwards.
He kisses Dean’s back, along the tailbone, his butt and kneads his cheeks before eventually placing a gentle kiss on his rim. Dean shudders.
“And classical music is already in your life,” Cas says, turns now fully towards the keyboard and then the room is filled with music. Dean never noticed how loud that piano actually is. But how would he? He was never allowed outside his room while Cas was playing.
Cas had looked so sad and pitiful when he had told Dean his story, yet his choice to offer him hospitality didn’t come from his motivation to be a good Samaritan or whatever. He still considered Cas a friend—after all those years, after all Cas had done to him.
When she got back, Cas met her at the community center where she was about to prepare the Girl Scout camping trip she was put in charge of. Cas hugged her but didn’t want to start a making out session in front of the children.
“He’s at college, in California. This isn’t really something I wanna tell him over the phone. I thought I do it the next time I see him in person.”
“No, it’s alright. Ben and his mother moved to another state. We only talk on the phone every once in a while. But whatever, it’s been years. I’m over it.” Both of them know that’s not true.
“Andrea’s niece is singing there, you know. I’m glad I have an excuse to miss it,” Benny says, wiping a kid’s finger prints off a Mustang’s hood.
“You didn’t show at all, had your professional poker face on—really, I couldn’t tell what’s been going on inside you besides being focused on the music.”
There’s Wi-Fi on board but what would be the point of sending it to Dean now? He doesn’t think Dean would still like to have it.
“Yeah, but…” He takes a deep breath. “Listen, I understand if you won’t accept any kind of financial aid and I really don’t mean to scare you off with this—”
Dean takes a bite, hoping to finally get rid of the godawful taste of ocean water, and his guest decides to try it as well. He seems concentrated as he chews, like it’s all new flavors to him. Almost as if he’s never had a sandwich before.
“Cas,” he pleaded. Even this single word was a struggle. Lying down made it worse—he wasn’t able to breathe all of a sudden. “Cas,” he choked out again, clasping at Cas’s arms, “help!”
Dean couldn’t really describe why he didn’t like it but he always felt like the angel was watching him. His mother had used to tell him that this was exactly what they were doing, yet Dean was certain she meant they were having an eye on him from their spot on a fluffy cloud in heaven. Not like this particular one, with its dead eyes that looked like it wanted to eat him alive.
“Sure, I’m sorry. We didn’t mean to make you feel left out,” Alicia tells her, arm around her shoulders. “This is Hannah, my old friend from college. She just moved here.”
“The usual: sulfur, hexbags, ectoplasm,” Dean replied and switched on his EMF meter. “Also, occult books, a Ouija board…whatever tends to get people into trouble.”
“Oh, okay…but, Cas, I don’t think writing down facts will make this very convincing. Why don’t we just talk, you know, like we would do if this were real?”
The boy became a man, his brother as well, and their father only ever mentioned his late wife when he had drunken himself senseless again, and since Sam had long left the state to go to college and start anew, it was Dean who had to pick him up from the bar and drive him home.
“Dean, get yourself a beer from the fridge and bring me one too, would ya? Where’s your brother and his lovely lady?”
They both chuckle at their jokes but Dean realizes he can’t draw this out forever. “Come on now,” he says and Sam follows him.
Castiel spots them from across the dining hall as Charlie is leading him to his table but there must actually be a God ‘cause he ends up being seated far away from Dean and Jody.
Dean is leaning back, face directed towards the painted sky, and somehow the tips of his fingers find the back of Cas’s hand resting on the bench between them, gently brushing his knuckles. Just for a moment, though, because when an elderly lady with a black lace veil on her head shushes Sam for disturbing her silent prayer, Dean quickly withdraws his hand and indicates them to leave.
Dean’s worried expression changed into a soft smile, moving closer to Cas. “Oh, babe, I’d love to, but I really need to go now,” he said and gave him a light kiss on the lips.
“I thought you didn’t want to do the talking,” Cas says and he looks so smug about it, Dean could slap his pretty little face. Instead he lets out a breathy laugh.
“Hey, Dean,” Benny says with a nod when he finally opens the door. The two boys smile at one another. Benny’s eyes are tinged with surprise, clearly not expecting Dean to show himself at his doorstep like this so suddenly.
Enough light to see if you’re walking out at night - which, apparently, Castiel Novak intends to do.
and he’s going to die this way. He’s going to die and the Hounds will come for him again and rip and tear and drag him back down below the crust and back into the pit where he belongs —
“Now, you said you can play any song just by hearing it once, correct? I’m going to play this song. Play it back once it’s finished.”
The place has changed since the last time Castiel was here. The pond is stagnant and nearly dry, the thickets of dried weeds choking the small dock that juts out several feet into the sludgy water where he and Lucifer used to sit and look for salamanders beneath the rocks. Overgrown grass and piles of rubbish are strewn across the lawn and over the dirt driveway that trails up the hill and to what remains of Castiel and Lucifer’s childhood home. Obscured by the rise of the hill, Castiel knows that the old barn lies on the other side of the property behind what’s left of the house.
They scramble to their feet and bolt for the road. Dean is faster than Castiel is and quickly pulls ahead of him, his long legs pumping furiously across the grass. He’s too slow, too slow, he wouldn’t make it. Oblivious, Gabriel wanders onto the sidewalk, headed straight for the path of the oncoming car.
Castiel blinks. “I knew you were of high ranking, but I had no idea you were so important.” Dean hums but says nothing more.
“I’ll try giving Lucifer another call. If he doesn’t pick up, I’ll track his phone...but if I cannot find him, we begin looking for what did this to me. And why.”
“Benny?” Castiel rasps. Benny chuckles that same, husky laugh that had made Castiel smile ear-to-ear the first time he ever heard it. Now, it makes him feel sick. His lower lip trembles, shaking his head in numb disbelief as he tries to make sense of what he’s seeing.
“Hey, don’t thank me. I’m just speaking the truth. Like I said, man...you’re the kinda guy who’s gonna get a record deal someday. You’ll be out of this town like it’s nothing.” He claps Castiel over the shoulder. Their shared smile is sad.
They kiss a lot, too. Castiel likes that, and so does Dean, especially when he realizes how different kinds of kisses feel. Castiel kisses his cheek, and Dean blushes. He kisses the back of his neck, and Dean’s whole body wriggles like a content cat. They kiss, long and slow on the couch, half-clothed, hands wandering around each other’s bodies at a steady easy pace. No need for rush, though it’s clear from the shared, muffled moans, quietly passed between slips of the tongue and muffled lips, that they want more.
“I have to go,” he says. “You’ll be safe going home - I cloaked your car against angels and your house should be entirely undetectable. They won’t touch you...but if something is killing angels, I need to check it out. I’m sorry.”
that hadn’t been a dream, he realizes with a jolt - cleaning his gun. He turns his head towards him when Castiel finally comes to.
“I guess. I really don’t mind if you take a nap, dude. I was just gonna try and figure out Ms. Ellen’s science homework or whatever.”
“Maybe we can go through and organize some of his notes some time,” Dean offers. “There’s so much stuff here.” Castiel nods in agreement. Death had given him a second chance - might as well do something with that, right? Is that what you’re supposed to do when you were meant to die over and over and over again, but didn’t?”
“Turn left up here,” Dean says, gesturing with his chin at the sharp curve in the road. “We’re almost there.”
Dean chews on his lower lip. “Castiel...this ain’t my order. I said ‘no’ when the angels proposed this. They were willing to stop their search for Jo - and me - to get this done. I tried to reason with them - “
Castiel inside, Dean waits until Castiel disappears inside the side door before quietly following in close pursuit. He waits for a full minute before Dean carefully pulls open the door and peers inside.
I wanted to thank everyone in my Discord chat who provided encouraging words and who looked over the final chapter to make sure the formatting made sense. I also wanted to thank my friend Avery who was a big source of encouragement back when I was working on this story in high school. And of course, I want to thank everyone who left comments and kudos. It's appreciated more than I can say.
It’s too much. He feels stiff and uncomfortable in his pants as he turns away, pressing the back of his hand to his mouth. He’s too much like Dean. Too much. It sends a pang of longing through his chest that he can’t seem to shove down. The man in there isn’t Dean, and he knows without a single doubt that both he and his future self wish that it could be.
“Loosen up, Cassie,” Balthazar snorts. “Could be fun. Anyway - can I go back to bed now? Or do I have to worry about heavenly wrath reigning hellfire down on my house?”
Another punch to the mouth unleashes a rough groan from Castiel’s throat. His legs buckle as Benny hits him again and again. Guilt and unbearable shame render him foggy and unresponsive.
Dean shifts uncomfortably where he stands. “Yeah, you’re right. Thanks, for, um...for showing me this.”
Glancing around, Dean leans in close, ensuring nobody else can hear him speak. “Angel radio’s gone silent - they’ve stopped looking for me, at least for now. We can head out if you want to. I just might have to lay low for a couple of days until their patrol regroups again.”
“I won’t be joining. There’s a vigil being held for Olivia Lowry today and the other hunters who were killed by the Witnesses.”
house. He tenses, pausing as he listens with growing alarm the muffled screaming. Something thuds to the floor, and Dean bolts into action. He races across the lawn, throwing open the front door as the yelling reaches a dizzying crescendo.
Naomi squints and tilts her head to one side. She grimaces slightly when the movement of her eye burns against the salt, but she gives no other indication that she’s in any kind of pain. He turns to grab a handful of salt again.
show up at school later that day. Exhausted, with a distant, dazed look in his eye, Dean spots Castiel stumbling into the school through the crowded halls just before the sixth-period bell rings. He feels lighter at the sight of him, though the absence in Castiel’s eyes haunts Dean as nothing else can. At the end of the day, when Dean has a headache from listening to the teachers talk in school, he hurries down the hallway to meet up with his friend by the doors. As the students clear out, a familiar sight catches Dean’s eye; the notorious bullies, Dick, Az, and Arry, shoving a kid Dean shares science with up against the lockers. Some kid named Benny with a quiet, kind, strange sense of humor that has always made Dean chuckle under his breath.
“I mean it, Dean,” he says hoarsely. It comes out harsher than he wants it to. The two lock eyes again and Castiel stiffens where he sits, memories of the night before flooding back through his vision. How warm Dean had felt. How vulnerable.
“Cas’ isn’t feeling well,” Dean murmurs when Sam insists that they wait for their friend. Even Sam has grown to like Castiel, though nothing could penetrate the bond the two older boys share. Their argument from the night before goes unspoken, but yet again, guilt bubbles up in Dean’s stomach, just like before. He knows that he should be doing something. He
The knife slips from his hand and clatters onto the floor, joining the pieces of the broken syringe on the dirty ground. Her blood is splattered across his skin, in his eyes, in his mouth, but he barely feels it. She’s lying. She must be lying. That’s what demons
He wakes up slowly after that. Blinking open his eyes, Castiel finds himself staring at the white, blank walls of a hospital room. His head hurts and he feels thick and clouded.
“I’ve often asked myself why my brother and I spent so much time tracking that demon down when it was clear we both hated where we came from. But...some memories...were good ones. We had a large yard to play in. A pond. The summers were beautiful and warm and Lucifer and I often challenged each other to see how many salamanders we could catch. It’s strange to hate a place and yet...feel so attached to it. Perhaps I wanted to blame the demon for all the evil that happened there, even though the supernatural had nothing to do with our suffering and neglect. Hunting it gave Lucifer and me a sense of purpose. But we never found it.”
Her voice is firm but gentle, and impossible to say ‘no’ to. Truthfully, Dean doesn’t know how he’d have made it home otherwise; the biting, winter wind only amplifies the searing pain in his face. Quickly, the two boys follow her up the path and into her house. She leads them into the kitchen, gesturing for them both to sit down as she grabs peroxide, bandages, and a wet cloth from underneath her sink.
When he finally wakes, hours later, he feels unrested and shaky. Despite being shielded from the nightmares (Had that really been Dean? Or did he just imagine it?) Castiel had only slept for a couple of hours. The clock on the dresser reads 6:21 a.m. He gropes for his phone, his chest leaping to life when he sees a text message notification.
Benny digs through his pockets, pulling out a clean tissue and pressing it gently against Dean’s face. Blood soaks the tissue almost immediately; in his panic, Dean hadn’t realized how badly he’d been hurt. The glint of the knife shines in Castiel’s hand again as Dean looks up, watching as he glares at the three of them like an avenging angel. Az grabs him by the shirt. Castiel slashes the blade through the air, slicing through the skin of Az’s hand. He jerks back with a howl of pain as bright blood gushes from his cut hand, spilling onto the hallway floor. Eyes bulging, Dean watches as Castiel’s eyes seem to
it is to follow Castiel this late at night — how is it any of his business what Castiel does, anyway? Castiel had
The older Castiel doesn’t answer. He walks across the room and grabs a small, black box with a series of runes carved on the side. Devil’s traps. Angelic runes. Others that Castiel does not recognize. Slamming it down on the table, Castiel watches as the other unlatches it, revealing a large, stone tablet sitting inside.
The camp itself is mostly quiet. Save for murmured conversation near the entrances to some of the other cabins, most people not confined to their meager living spaces linger near the camp borders in small groups, sorting through small crates of supplies. Half-concealed by one of the smaller cabins just across from the makeshift dirt path, he spots his older self talking to a young man with a short cut of hair that sticks partially upright and a strong jaw that cuts across his cheeks. The other man is handsome - Castiel certainly can’t deny that. He’s only slightly taller than Castiel, and if Castiel didn’t know any better, he’d say the other man looks almost exactly like Dean. Same stance. The same manner of dress. Same wide, dorky grin.
Castiel drives back to Balthazar’s house, having taken a separate car should Balthazar want to stay, and waits. Waiting is all that he can do. He brushes his fingers over the scar, again and again, as though hoping it would provide some answer, though he hates its presence and all that it represents. What he knows is that whatever this thing is, it isn’t friendly. Far from it. And when Balthazar gets back, hours later, Castiel tells him that he wants to go after the being that raised him from hell, dangerous or not.
Sam shrugs his shoulders. He turns his back to Dean, hurriedly dressing for bed with an impatient huff of breath.
“Tonight, you’re going to come with me,” he says after a moment. He unsheathes his knife from his belt and absently begins cleaning it off. “Now that the second trial is complete, I think I know where I can find the Devil. And my brother. We’re going to find him tonight and take his grace and end this once and for all. If I have to kill him and take it myself, I will.”
Castiel bites his lip. “That’s...that’s good,” he says quietly. Consent. Regard for human well-being. It might be the most angelic thing he’s heard out of Dean’s mouth since the day they met. “So...you’ve never had sex?” Castiel asks hesitantly.
Castiel gapes at him. “Isn’t it obvious?” he whispers. How could Dean not know? After all the people he’s let down and failed to save? Not to mention that he’s slept with other men.
They’re no longer in the bathroom. A split second passes and Castiel is suddenly thrust onto a stool at an empty bar he’s never seen. White lights hang around the perimeter of the rustic room, lined with wooden tables and the smell of cheap whiskey. Similar to the Roadhouse where Ellen and Anna work, the place has seen better days with its faded, wooden walls and dusty lights. Nobody else is here - it’s only the two of them.
Castiel doesn’t know when he and Dean decided that Dean would be living with him - sleeping on Balthazar’s bed, mostly. Researching hunts, helping Castiel organize Balthazar’s numerous books and notes. Throwing away old liquor bottles, little by little. Fixing the leak in the bathroom faucet upstairs. Sometimes, he’ll leave to investigate a hunt and come back with another creature’s blood on his hands. Castiel will help him wash it off and then go to bed.
“If you ever wanted to — “ Castiel begins. Dean’s eyes widen even further, if possible, and Castiel can swear that he looks
“You know me,” he rasps, swaying where he kneels. “You care about me. All my life I never thought I deserved to be - to be cared for. I was just a soldier, going through the motions, too out of my mind with how badly I hated myself for letting myself get close to anybody. You...you gave me something to believe in. You believed in
John sighs. “Good. Now, I’m gonna go get changed, and then I want you outside to help me look at the transmission. Your brother’s going to make dinner tonight.”
Castiel lifts a shaking hand, placing it over Dean’s wrist holding the blade to his throat. He gently pushes Dean’s hand towards his shoulder where Dean’s handprint marks his skin. Carefully, Dean presses his closed fist over the print before he drops the blade onto the floor, spreading his fingers to match the pattern. A shiver runs up Castiel’s body as the connection makes his skin sing to life. All at once, he can feel everything that is
As it turns out, just because his future self believes him, doesn’t mean he trusts him. He keeps him handcuffed to the bed as he gathers his things and hurries out the door, much to Castiel’s dismay.
“I killed an angel,” Dean murmurs. “This is it for me. The other angels will hunt me down. This will be their excuse to throw me from power once and for all - violently if they have to. They don’t need to use my brother to do it anymore. I can never come back home to heaven.”
“I’m...glad, Dean. You were the one person I was hoping would hear it. That means so much coming from you.”
Castiel places his hand on the piano. Dean watches him, wordless. He only nods. A long moment of silence falls between them with only the soft ticking of the clock on the wall to account for any noise.
“This is a situation I have under control,” Castiel says quietly, addressing the onlookers. “I am dealing with him - this
Tearing his gaze away, Castiel trudges away from the window, desperate to clear his head and calm the raging stiffness in his pants. He feels like a teenager, itchy and hot under the skin after watching something he wasn’t supposed to be witness to.
in his groin, spreading warm coils of pleasure up through his stomach. Almost without thinking, he grinds his hips up against Dean’s, feeling those familiar twinges of pleasure shoot through his body at the brush of the intimate contact.
Stunned silence befalls Castiel. He watches the man, eyes wide and unblinking, as he turns back to face Castiel with folded arms.
But she doesn’t answer. Nobody does, even when he dares send out a prayer to Dean, not able to bring himself to think about where he could be, now. Or what this world had done to him.
