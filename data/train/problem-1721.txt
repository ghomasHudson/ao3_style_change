.." He shook his head. "Yeah... the bloke's name was Jim. They made a big fuss over him at the school because he was supposed to be so clever. Got a scholarship or something and took off too. Well - after the fire, I mean. Didn't stick around for long. I still remember how everyone was all up in arms because he didn't even stay for the funeral. That's when the talk started. Like they were saying he might've started the fire himself." Patrick shook his head again. "It was fairly peculiar when you think about it. Burnt right down to the foundation."
Sherlock opened one eye to look at John then closed it again. He said, "Of all the questions you could ask me, that's the one you choose?"
“A little tight?” John asked. Sherlock nodded automatically, leading to an explosion of pain in his groin. With a hoarse cry, he let the rope between his teeth go, and arousal gained the upper hand.
"No," Sherlock answered firmly. "For some reason, John wants to ensure that I remain exactly where I am. And that's why I'm going to stay here."
Sherlock nodded. That's what they'd decided and it was sketched in on the blueprints. The only problem was they hadn't found a bed yet that met their specifications. They simply hadn't been able to find the
"What did he tell you?" Sherlock wanted to know. It was a rather obvious question, yes, but Sherlock had to know what was going on. He'd tiptoed around the question long enough without John revealing anything of importance.
Sherlock spread his arms. "I didn't want to get on her bad side... after all, I did call rather late - or early, depending on how..." He broke off at Mike's impatient snort. "I was simply nice to her... I can be quite convincing and rather charming... when I want to be," he admitted, unconcerned. "I might have overdone it slightly. I'm a bit out of practise."
As it was, however, all he said - with no small degree of annoyance - was, "Oh, Sherlock! Whatever have you got yourself into now!"
"What was that just now?" John asked, his voice raw and still tainted by a hint of that emotion which had been so clearly displayed on his face just moments ago.
A sense of yearning rose within John... of unquenchable want. He grabbed Sherlock, pushed him backwards on the bed, pressed his legs apart and lay down between them. “Okay?” he asked, his voice rough and pleading.
An ominous crease appeared on Sherlock's forehead for a fraction of a second, but then something like hopelessness and shame spread across his face.
"That would be the last thing I need!" Mycroft cried. "Delete them right now. You've looked at them all at least three times. That should suffice."
Secretly, John knew that was an empty threat. He'd let himself be manipulated by Sherlock anytime, simply because he didn't have the heart to sabotage Sherlock's efforts and ignore his little tricks, thus disappointing all his hopes. Why did this young man get under his skin the way no one else before him ever had? Other than maybe... Victor... back then... Victor had got under his skin like that. But John didn't want to think about Victor right now. Victor was the past. Sherlock was the present. And it was good that way.
John immediately pulled the crop away, directing it now toward Sherlock's bare chest. He tapped the leather tongue at the end – also called the tress – against Sherlock's nipple several times, causing Sherlock to gasp breathlessly for air, before moving on to his actual goal, allowing the tress to rest against Sherlock's cheek in a parody of a gentle, loving caress.
He'd found the kitchen on the first try after all. There were four people in the large, chrome-accoutred space. The young man who'd brought Sherlock's bags up to his room sat at a table peeling potatoes, an apron tied over his suit. Apparently no one here much cared about a strict division of duties. A woman of around fifty with grey hair and a white jacket identifying her as the cook stood at the stove, where a pot was quietly bubbling. The second woman, in her early thirties and wearing a dark, knee-length dress and a white apron, must be one of the maids. The only one whose function Sherlock couldn't quite place was the man who was about John's age, sporting a narrow moustache. The dark suit and bowtie indicated some kind of butler. But was John really toff enough to employ a butler?
"Was skinny-dipping, the nutter. Naked as God made him!" Patrick laughed again. "None of us would've even thought of something like that." He drained his glass. "Jim!" he crowed all of a sudden.
"No!" Sherlock cried out immediately. "No... everything's... everything's fine... I... go on. Please!"
Sherlock gasped for air and his hips jerked forward, but it wasn't until John increased the pressure on his nipples that he stilled his hand. John twisted Sherlock's nipples a bit, solely in order to hear him whimper and to see his body bend forward. Only then did he let go.
"John..." Sherlock said, startled at how soft his own voice sounded. "John." He left his violin on the table, not paying it much heed this time, and went to John, who stood up and awaited him with a smile.
"I use it constantly... it's the only way for me to tell that what I'm doing is wrong. Without a compass... I would probably be convinced I was doing the right thing even when I wasn't."
But aside from that, there were more tedious ways to spend a Friday afternoon. His client was – as mentioned – rather skillful, and Sherlock allowed himself to daydream of John while the smacks rained down on him. It was easy to imagine John in the place of his actual client ... the intensity of the beating had increased gradually, and he was given breaks now and then to recover and prepare himself mentally for the next round – just like John did. But it was lacking slightly in terms of variety, and the rhythm wasn't quite right. However, the action was carried out with care and a fine grasp of the technique, such that Sherlock was relatively certain it wouldn't leave any marks.
The masons and electricians had cleared out, but more tradesmen had invaded the new bathroom like a plague of locusts, where they were laying tiles and installing every imaginable accoutrement, from bathtub to bidet, as long as it was decadent … and expensive.
Anthea took a step back and dropped her head; there would be no further objections from her. Jacques, however, didn’t quite seem to have understood yet.
John later justified his obedient departure from Sherlock's chaotic living conditions with the fact that the forty minutes he'd allowed for the discussion with Sherlock had run out.
“Don’t try and distract me!” Mike barked at John. He’d talked himself into a proper snit, and he was just getting started. He didn’t want to be interrupted. There was still something important he had to get off his chest. “You’re going to prove to him just how important he is to you! You’re going to give him something.”
Thomas had hastily leapt to his feet, but was still struggling with a large bite of his snack and was therefore unable to speak.
... but there was no way John was nurturing any romantic feelings for him whatsoever, because otherwise he would have told him about this therapy... wouldn't he? Why should a man like John ever fall in love with someone like
"You bet I can. I told you right from the beginning that I have absolutely no desire to be reminded of an ashtray when I stick my tongue down your throat," John said, as calm as anything, before continuing with smug satisfaction: "Based on your reaction, it seems this really will be a punishment for you."
A warm glow appeared on John's face, the one he loved so much. "You've done well. I'm proud of you." A chaste kiss on his cheek that caused more emotional turmoil in him than a hard fuck would, and then John let go, got up, and moved away from him. "You've earned a little reward," John said eventually, puffed on the cigar and blew the smoke languidly into Sherlock's face.
A fun-loving woman, once so full of life, she had finally been beaten by cancer. The hospital staff had already moved her to a private room, so that she could say good-bye to her loved ones in peace.
"Yes, I do... but if I said that, I'd sound like someone who was fairly gagging for it," he retorted dryly.
Sherlock wasn't the only one – John also exhibited an involuntary reaction, licking his lips greedily. The faint, almost ecstatic twitches that his efforts had unleashed in Sherlock fanned the flames of his desire even higher. His blood rushed hotly through his veins, gathered in a glowing ball in his abdomen, and sank lower into his groin, where it manifested as an insistent throbbing.
Then... John's hand felt tentatively for Sherlock's erection. The stars twinkled anew. Sherlock gasped for air, almost in desperation. An awkward up-and-down. Exhausted. Careless. And yet, more than enough.
John licked his tongue across the slippery head a few times, secretly glad that Sherlock was already so aroused and stimulated that it wouldn't take long before he reached his climax. The thought struck him of how long it had been since he'd pleasured anyone other than Sherlock like this. He couldn't remember. Certainly not in the last few years at any rate. No one he'd shared his life with during that time had ever seemed worth the effort. Because it was an effort for him. As much as he enjoyed this sexual act being performed on him, he didn't like having another cock in his mouth. He was much better with his fingers than his tongue - plus, he didn't particularly like the taste.
Once again, John slowed down a bit, waiting for Sherlock to ask him for something else that would postpone his orgasm.
Btw... the rapid progress (of the German version) of this story was all due to the most understanding husband of all times, who left me completely alone and let me write all through my holidays until my fingertips were glowing.
Were they going to have to talk about it? About everything that had happened today? It would probably be better if they did...
“Yes.” Sherlock told him the number. "Thank you," he then said in an exaggerated way, not really meaning it, and rang off.
Sherlock, on the other hand, sat as still as a statue. Perhaps a bit pale, but with a completely calm expression. He didn't look at Mike, but rather at John, who in turn only glanced at him quickly before trying to stare Mike right through the floor. Following John's brief look, Sherlock lowered his head again over his papers and kept working.
Sherlock made a sound that was suspiciously like a purr and then demanded, "Bed," once again stretching his arms out to John as before.
"The difference between a whore and a respectable citizen isn't as great as generally believed. Aside from that... you and YOUR policeman aren't just reading Bible verses to each other when you're alone, are you?"
Mycroft nodded imperceptibly. "Gregory." His eyes wandered to the plaster still decorating Greg's temple. "Your recovery is progressing, as I see."
"Reward?" Sherlock asked, perplexed, as he finally stood on wobbly legs. Why in the world did he feel that John had somehow protected him - sanctified him, even … as if the punishment were some kind of perverse anointing?
Jim Moriarty loved fairy tales, but he wasn't above taking inspiration from Hollywood movies now and then. Because what were they, if not modern fairy tales?
One morning, John awoke and wished Sherlock were there with him, taking care of his morning wood under the covers.
John laughed, unamused. "You took a couple of sips of tea, stuck your spoon in the jam and licked it off... That's not what we call
"Why didn't you ever say anything?" he finally asked. "About Father and what he told you? Why did you … carry that around with you the whole time?" It must have been a hardship for Mycroft. To be relegated to a spot behind his half-brother, and then in addition to be burdened with the responsibility for him. If Sherlock had been in Mycroft's shoes, he probably would have hated him too.
"Fine," Mike acquiesced. "But just one more thing - John... this thing with Sherlock isn't forever. There's something wrong with the guy... I can feel it. He's going to leave sometime. And what happens then?"
A smile spread across John's lips. There was nothing he enjoyed more than a challenge – and a man like this, who wanted to portray himself as bored and impassive, despite his anxiety, truly presented an unhoped-for and very special challenge. To cut him down a bit, to break his resistance – to break
Sherlock tilted his head in acknowledgement. "Of course... but... you're definitely the type for romantic gestures. You're wearing black, despite the fact that he's been dead several days now. You're wearing a locket around your neck - probably containing a picture of the deceased. All sentimental nonsense." Sherlock tried hard not to think of John's handkerchief right then, which he'd been carrying around with him for days in his trouser pocket. "You introduced yourself as Mary Moran... you have the same last name as him. If you'd been married, you'd wear a wedding ring, for sentimental reasons. Therefore, he wasn't your husband, but he was a relative. A cousin or..." The curve of her nose, the blond hair... "Your brother."
"I simply wanted to give you a piece of good advice," Mycroft Holmes interrupted him, his voice tense. Or maybe it just sounded that way due to the connection. After all, Greg had never heard him speaking over the phone before. "Scotland Yard will be receiving some new equipment in the next few days. The funding has been approved." Greg heard Holmes take a deep breath. "The equipment includes a new type of bullet-proof vest. Make sure that you get one."
John stared at the blanched face and the pale eyes glaring down at him. They appeared so large they were out of proportion with the rest of his features, and burned with anger. Although John's ability to breathe was considerably limited by Sherlock's grip, his immediate thought wasn't '
"Anything you want," John whispered without a moment's hesitation, and less than a minute later he penetrated Sherlock with two cold, slick fingers.
"Oh, Sherlock." Irene had stood up and come over to him. She placed her hand on his chest in a gesture of sympathy. "The two of you truly deserve each other... Men!" she snorted, rolling her eyes. "You can't seem to do anything right. Am I glad I don't have to muck about with that anymore. Women are much more... but that's not the point," she cut herself off and looked him straight in the eye. "Sherlock - I'm going to give you a piece of advice: don't be so pig-headed. Sometimes you need to give your happiness a little shot in the arm." She gave him a parting kiss on the cheek, leaving behind a distinct lipstick smudge. "Good-bye, Sherlock. Maybe that will get your Doc's engine revving a bit. A little jealousy can do wonders."
They'd taken a different way in than John Watson had been directed to by Moriarty, seeking a spot that was more or less protected from curious onlookers in order to climb over the fence that separated the park from the rest of the city. Since the park was closed after sunset, they hadn't had any other choice in order to gain entrance to the grounds. Now they moved cautiously toward the McKenzie Pavilion, which was near the rendezvous point the mob boss was heading for.
"A thank-you would be charming," Mycroft replied in the same tone of voice, making the hairs on the back of Sherlock's neck stand on end. It was utterly repugnant to him to be beholden to his brother, especially for something like this! Mycroft had given him back his freedom and autonomy, and Sherlock knew he should be profoundly grateful for that (and deep down, he actually was) but he simply couldn't bring himself to admit as much to his brother. Too much had passed between them... too much broken china... too many hurtful words... too many unforgivable actions.
"Opinions differ." Sherlock shrugged his shoulders with a casual air, only to pull a grimace at the pain. "And now stop looking at me as if I were some saintly vision."
"Fine." Sherlock nodded. "And now you can go get me that ice pack," he allowed with benevolent condescension.
"I'm going to have to knock the ash off soon. Do you want to... assist me... or should I use the ashtray instead?" John asked, and Sherlock's heart rate surged into a restless gallop.
At that moment, Sherlock couldn't decide which of the two topics was more unpleasant for him, and so he asked randomly, "Who gave me away? I only smoked in the garden, showered and changed immediately after … and whenever I did smoke in my room, it was with the window open and I blew the smoke out as far as possible."
"Mummy, you must still have all of our old things, don't you? Sherlock's old violin as well? Wonderful. This evening, if I were to... Of course, Mummy.
"BULLSHIT!" Greg interrupted the mayor crassly. "You were there! I read it in the paper the next day. You visited all the other police officers there who'd been hurt."
"I gave them the day off," John told him. "I wanted to have you all to myself today. They weren't exactly happy about it... but they were so upset with me anyway that one more thing didn't really make a difference."
Before you tar and feather me... read to the end of the chapter. I've written an additional explanation there as to the whys and wherefores. Thanks.
"Terribly sorry I can't control the release of my pre-ejaculate," Sherlock retorted in a clipped, sarcastic tone.
"Oh, Jack," the cook exclaimed, shaking her head. "I don't know why the Gaul in you always comes out when you get worked up."
"It's better to test the cigar's condition by smell anyway. A cigar that's too dry or that's been stored improperly will barely smell of anything," Sherlock babbled almost involuntarily.
"You could have taken something else. There was more than enough selection on the tray that rather fit waiter passed around," Mike stated matter-of-factly.
When John arrived back at his house, he took a deep breath and let it out. Home. Finally. He stepped into the entry hall and waved away Jacques, who had approached him and now retreated again without a word.
“Sensible... pfff,” Sherlock scoffed. “Who wants to be sensible...” He made a dismissive gesture. “But fine. Since you seem to have your heart set on it...
"That was... sublime..." a quiet voice sounded behind him, and when he turned around in surprise, there was John. John, sitting on the floor in the open doorway with his legs crossed, a look on his face that could only be described as
"I'm... I'm just picturing... Mike's face... if his presence hadn't... stopped you..." Sherlock explained with some effort.
Sherlock shivered hot and cold. The tongue was still on his glans. Unrelenting. And then... then Sherlock felt dry, soft skin for the first time. A kiss on his throbbing erection, and in the middle of the kiss that wet, gentle tongue again.
Sherlock was holding still, but now he swallowed again. The muscle contractions of the narrow passage around John's erection were almost too much for him. He gripped both hands around either side of the chair seat, digging his fingernails into the wood.
at all... it was completely unintentional. Sherlock had never tried to seduce him by batting his eyelashes or wiggling his arse. That wasn't him. He didn't use cheap tricks to fan the flames of John's desire. One look generally sufficed... and John's lust was awakened.
"Oh yes they do," John announced firmly. "From this point on they do. Always. I'm going to personally ensure it. And as soon as we're home, I'm putting you over my knee anyway. Or maybe exactly for that reason," he concluded with a lecherous grin.
Yes – obviously... '007' John was returning home following a hard day and a successfully completed mission, requiring a martini and something … relaxing. Sherlock was only too willing to be of assistance in the matter. Or... (Sherlock's imagination was already boiling over a little) maybe John was still on a mission, and he – Sherlock – was meant as a present... with an assignment to squeeze everything out of the master spy... information and... other things... of course he would be at his disposal... fall in love with him in the meantime, and end up plotting with him against his former boss...
"Me?" Lestrade exclaimed, nonplussed, pressing both hands to his chest. "Me? Are you sure? Just because I'm the last honest copper?"
Two days later, John and Mike were out making further preparations for the upcoming diamond smuggling operation. No sooner had they left than Jacques arrived and resumed his duties.
John wore his silk dressing gown - the knee-length one with the black and dark grey stripes that Sherlock particularly liked seeing him in - and held a towel in one hand. He must have just been drying his hair, which was still damp and standing up in every direction.
"Oh, I see... your lack of response tells me you've just put two and two together." Moriarty sounded pleased. "Good, that puts an end to the tedious introductions. Can we move on to the heart of the matter now?"
Now John smiled, and this time it was a genuine, friendly smile that reached his eyes and warmed them. "I don't think begging will be necessary. I'd say we're beyond that. You've earned your reward. No ifs, ands, or buts."
His cock was agonisingly hard, even though he hadn't so much as touched it. Sherlock's surrender and his ability to suffer and still experience pleasure unfailingly had that effect on him. The man was simply a gift from on high. Up to now, everything was going just as he'd imagined it would - perhaps even better. It was an incomparable feeling to control another person in this manner... to command them... to have them so completely in the palm of his hand. So vulnerable... so fragile... so irresistible... utterly at his mercy. Oh, yes... it was perfect. The power that Sherlock had handed him was intoxicating. He was finally able to breathe easy again. He was finally able to think clearly once more. A burden was removed from his shoulders. Here, he had total control... and he'd get it back in the other areas of his life too. Piece by piece. But first... first he was going to bring Sherlock to orgasm. John took a deliberate breath through his nose. Oh, yes... he was going to make him come... he was going to make him come in the throes of the pain... and the way he knew Sherlock, he'd scream for
"Fuck..." John hissed from between his teeth, which were still clamped firmly together. What in the world had got into Sherlock today? No matter what it was - it was bloody hot!
It was actually rather mad, when he thought about it. Greg couldn't be allowed to discover the lengths to which Mycroft was going to simply in order to spend a bit of time with him. Admitting to a weakness like that would be unforgivable. There was no telling what might happen if Greg ever found out. He didn't doubt it would end up being used against him sooner or later. That was the way of the world. And yet... Mycroft still felt drawn to this policeman in a way that was strange and unfamiliar. He'd never felt this way about another person before in his life. It scared him. And that fear strengthened his resolve never to allow the depth of his feelings to become known. Sure - he'd more or less proposed marriage to Greg already... in the drizzling rain, with a pair of ducks as their only witnesses... but that didn't mean by a long shot that he had to expose himself or make himself vulnerable to attack... not even if he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Greg. Although there was nothing he'd rather do more.
"And what might that be - in your considered opinion?" Mycroft Holmes inquired with a faintly amused wink, and Greg took heart once again with relief. His behaviour and his curiosity were being tolerated, perhaps even encouraged.
"For us," Sherlock corrected him gently. "I know." He stood there for a while, not sure what to do, before giving himself a little push. "And Mike will get something out of it too," he added, deliberately aiming for a lighter if somewhat forced tone. "You haven’t yelled at him in quite a while now."
Just as Sherlock was about to go to bed - an empty bed, which seemed horrifyingly cold without John - his mobile beeped. He took it out of his trouser pocket, his face already brightening, when he recognised Mike's number. An irrational fear stretched its icy claws out toward him. His fingers flying, he accepted the call and pressed the phone so hard against his ear that it hurt, shouting, "What's happened to John?"
With those words, his exhausted cock twitched with interest, and a happy smile played around Sherlock's mouth.
Sherlock got into the back seat and - following a gesture from Mary - slid across behind the front passenger seat so that she could take the spot beside him.
"What is it?" he asked, since John obviously expected him to, although the question came out sounding somewhat suspicious.
"In his defence, I have to admit that he probably didn't consider the fact that he might be damaging your bottom line in doing so." John took a piece of paper and a pen from her desk, wrote a figure on it, folded the paper in half, and pushed it toward her. Then he leaned back in his chair and crossed his legs lazily. "I know that Sherlock owes you something. He's never told me what – or how much – but I think that amount should be more than enough to erase at least a portion of his debt."
and the lock sprang open. Without further ado, Sherlock opened the door, only to stop on the threshold in a fit of self-consciousness.
"Here!" John called with a quiet sigh, although he still didn't move from where he was standing. "I'm in here, Mike."
Sherlock only needed to spare a cursory glance for the two cigar bands and the straight, elegant parejo shape... take note of the light, hazelnut brown coloration of the wrapper leaf, reminiscent of milk chocolate... inhale the the exquisite, aromatic smell of cocoa, cream, vanilla, and a hint of marshmallow with an almost greedy sniff... and a name appeared before his eyes as clearly as if it were engraved in marble:
"Oh God..." Sherlock groaned. "All right... I'm taking it... aaaahhhh... Oh God... John! I... I'm..."
"You're making a mess again already," John took pleasure in reproaching him. "You are and will always be a knob slob. It looks like I'm going to have to punish you, like it or not."
As John was an enthusiastic eater, he didn't notice at first that Sherlock was just using his fork to move his food around on his plate rather than to put it in his mouth.
"I could have," Sherlock admitted with a small sigh. "But... I wanted to do it alone. Well... almost alone." He removed his last article of clothing and stood naked in front of John. An eager gleam came into his eyes. "Still... I did go behind your back. Are you going to punish me now?"
"No... all we found was an envelope with the initials J and M on it, like a return address, and a telephone number... when we called, there was a recording... the name '
Sherlock, who was a bit thrown by the advice, recovered from his bewilderment just in time to call Thomas back before he left the room.
Sherlock snuggled up to him, his legs stretched out across one of John's thighs while John's other leg supported Sherlock's back. John's arm draped itself around the pale, narrow shoulders.
Sherlock held completely still, his eyes locked on John's. John reached back, and Sherlock automatically held his breath.
"What can I say?" Greg responded with a sheepish grin. "I always wanted to be a cop, ever since I was a kid. Justice and security and all that..."
Greg's eyes swept across Mycroft. The Inspector looked disappointed, his eyes knowing and at the same time empty.
A shudder ran through John's body and he started to resist the embrace, but then he clung to the half-naked body in front of him, buried his face in Sherlock's shoulder and struggled to hold back a sob that very nearly burned his throat.
"It's true," Sherlock insisted with the obstinacy of a young child. "You always kept something on. Your shirt... or your trousers. Sometimes you didn't take anything off."
"Out of the question," John objected with mild reproach. "Do you really think I'm going to let you out of my sight for a second? Now that I finally have you here? I've waited for this moment for more than three weeks. That's long enough. More than enough. One second more would be nothing but a waste of valuable time that we could spend in a much different - and more pleasurable - way."
Nothing but row after row of those endless pillars and weird oval arches, like empty eye sockets staring into the void. If he stood at just the right - or perhaps the wrong - angle, the pillars lined up in a self-repeating row, creating the disturbing impression of a hall of mirrors. John almost expected to find himself face-to-face with an image of himself any second now, but instead Moriarty suddenly stood before him.
"Good, isn't it?" John's voice sounded, and although Sherlock had his eyes closed, he heard the amused, eye-twinkling smile in the words.
Sherlock leaned back against the bedroom door and closed his eyes. He wanted to be everything for John... his light... his darkness... his slave... his idol... his equal partner. But that would only be possible once there were no more secrets, no more lies, no more half-truths, and no more excuses between them. Only then would he truly be worthy of John's respect... his attentions... his affection (and perhaps, eventually... his love). Only when he was able to stand before him on equal footing - on equal terms … only then would his submission … his supremacy... be complete. Only then would it all make sense... would it form a complete picture. Only then would all of the conditions be fulfilled for him to truly enjoy life at John's side. Only then would he have the right to claim everything for himself that John already shared with him so willingly - at least, that was how Sherlock saw it.
"And not just the one time, either..." Mike mused. "At least no one said it out loud. And you're really not known for defending the honour of your flings."
The sight made John think of Sherlock once again. But the others were still drinking and talking, wanting to discuss their next steps with him and make plans.
'. South Americans don't usually take well to things like that," Sherlock objected calmly. "But I could..."
"Precisely, Mike," Sherlock interrupted him mildly. "It's none of your business. But as you're not going to shut up about it otherwise... I've never used any of my
"Who are you?" he asked, irritated by the interruption. His head was spinning. He couldn't possibly concentrate on interacting with a stranger at the moment.
Mycroft endured his mother's ensuing monologue with stoicism - just the way she had taught him. During a brief pause in the flow of words, however, he realised that he was no longer seventeen years old, having just been caught in the act of preparing to compose an especially florid piece of poetry. Something like that was the worst kind of time-waster in Sylvia Holmes' opinion.
"Daddy, Daddy! Watch!" a girl called just then as she climbed the ladder to the top of the slide. She was maybe eight or nine years old and was dragging a younger girl - probably her sister - after her.
Mrs Hudson always set off a creak on the first step, Lestrade took the steps two at a time, and Mycroft... actually, he didn't want to think about Mycroft at the moment.
"Oh yes..." She nodded, and Mike realised he wasn't the only one who'd done some digging. "I know. You're..."
John responded to the laugh with a grin. "Why am I not surprised? You must have always been a troublemaker." He gestured at the folder. "Arrests for fighting, drugs, public intoxication... you transferred universities..."
"So..." John took a deep, relaxed breath. "Shall we begin?" he asked – still careful to remain polite.
The path they'd taken had become narrower, the headstones more modern, and Sherlock had been looking around more often in the last couple of minutes.
"The conference is going about the way I expected," John answered somewhat evasively, in the hope that Sherlock wouldn't be quite as obstinate as usual following his spectacular orgasm.
was more like it. It had been going on for years now. Sometimes more - sometimes less. He knew it. He'd known it practically from the beginning. He wasn't stupid, after all. And yet he didn't do anything about it. What could he have done anyway? It wasn't as if he didn't love her anymore … still, they'd gone in different directions in the course of their marriage when it came to … certain needs.
"Oh, maybe because it might hurt my reputation within the mob if I'm on such good terms with the mayor?" John said, pretending at disinterest before his voice took on a testy undertone. "Do you have any idea how fast a rumour might start going round that I was going to scuttle some plan because of you, or because of him? Have you considered that it might hurt my reputation as a crimelord if I associate with a mayor who ISN'T under my thumb?"
The cut of the suit emphasised John's shoulders, even making him appear slightly taller than he really was. Sherlock could tell it wasn't bespoke, though. It was an expensive suit, purchased in an exclusive shop with expert advice, and it suited John extraordinarily well, but Sherlock had a hankering to admire John in a suit that had been made just for him. He wouldn't leave his side for an instant during the fittings, and the thought that some fancy tailor would ask him which side he dressed on – and forever thereafter bear that knowledge – was nearly insufferable. No, on second thought it was better if John continued to buy his clothing off the rack.
"Unbelievable," John muttered, shaking his head. "At least this way you'll only make a mess on the floor." Then he pulled his left hand back and, without any warning, slapped the pure white skin of Sherlock's buttocks.
"Yes," he breathed, pressing himself even closer to John's trousers and the very promising hardness that had begun to appear between the mob boss's legs. "I did ... and this right here..." He pushed his own rapidly swelling cock more meaningfully against John's leg. "...isn't a gun in my pocket. I'm just happy to see you."
John stretched his lips to a fiendish grin and reached back to deliver the first blow, which Sherlock greeted with an enthusiastic shout.
"All right," John growled between two hungry kisses. "Is it going to work like this? Because I really don't know if I'm in any state to get the lube."
John let his gaze wander around the entryway, which was indeed very happily empty. His eyes passed over the curved stairway that led up to the first floor, where his private rooms were located. But he turned in the other direction. His bedroom didn't hold much interest for him at the moment. Strangely, he felt the urge to have a hot shower, even though logic told him he was clean enough after his bath with Sherlock. Still, he felt dirty.
John inhaled audibly through his nose. His index finger twitched on the trigger. Then - as if it took a great effort of will - he clicked the safety back on and lowered the muzzle.
This time John couldn't help chuckling a bit. "We're rather rude today, aren't we?" he said, but he complied with Sherlock's wish and shoved his erection into the pliant opening again.
Sherlock didn't know exactly how it happened, but at some point during the afternoon he found himself in the kitchen. Mrs Turner pushed him down onto a chair at the big kitchen table, smiling indulgently, and set about heating up some hot cocoa on the cooker. This wasn't the first time Sherlock had been in John's - or rather, Mrs Turner's - kitchen. But this was the first time he stayed longer than a couple of minutes. And it was... rather pleasant.
He took a long, hard look at his face in order to be sure he'd got rid of all the lipstick, and was astonished at what he saw.
“Happy.” John made sure to snort derisively at that. “I'll never be as happy as you and Susan anyway. And taking the two of you as the measure, then Sherlock is the second best thing I could ever hope to find. At least he satisfies all of my physical needs.”
John's body clenched, and then it was as if a dam broke inside him, and everything, absolutely everything flowed out of him into Sherlock's willing, expectant mouth. Pure bliss was written on that pale face, its cheeks now flushed faintly red. Sherlock didn't relinquish his prize yet, however. He continued to trace circles with his tongue around the slowly softening penis in his mouth … so warm and so slick... John shuddered one last time as he realised that Sherlock hadn't swallowed yet. With the back of one slightly shaky hand, John wiped the perspiration off his upper lip. A muted, shameless, throaty moan vibrated around John's depleted cock, and it was only then that he felt the muscles contracting as Sherlock swallowed.
He sighed in an aggravated manner, but stood back in order to let her in. "If you must... come in and have a seat." He went to his bed and let himself drop down onto it with his dressing gown swirling around him dramatically and his lips shaped into an exaggerated moue of indignation.
"You wouldn't be the first to be tempted with thoughts of murder in Sherlock's presence," Irene murmured, half to herself.
Sherlock moistened his lips with the tip of his tongue, and John felt his penis begin to swell even at that simple gesture. What was it going to be like when...
"That wasn't the deal, my friend. I should really put you over my knee for that, you insolent bastard," John growled. "Maybe that will teach you to behave."
"I understand... not only married, but with children too." Saying it out loud felt like a kick to the gut.
"Inspector?" Mycroft was somewhat surprised by the remark - pleasantly surprised - and tried to hide it behind a quirked eyebrow.
"You're in the market for a new abode, in other words..." Mycroft started to say, but Greg wasn't really listening to him.
Greg shrugged again. "Well," he said bitterly. "That's the funny thing about marriage. Never did manage to follow her example. Couldn't bring myself to cheat on her... until... today..." he realised with mild astonishment and took the cigarette back. He smoked silently for a while before returning the cigarette to Mycroft.
"Cooper's right," Jack tossed out. "I'm all right with a poofter for a boss. But that Sigerson was too much..." He shook his head in disgust, rubbing the backs of his hands. "Wanker bit me too. Hope I didn't catch anything from him. Who knows what diseases and shit they've got."
Mike gave Jacques a warning look as well, including Anthea in it. “Jacques...I don’t think you really want to carry on that line of argument... at least not as long as you wish to remain employed here.”
Sherlock looked up into John's deep blue eyes with their huge, black pupils, and forgot everything else around him. The pulling and burning on his back and in his arse weren't important anymore. He spread his legs and ended up flinching. His skin had been stretched a little too much by the movement, and the pain flared up anew for a moment. Tears seeped out of the corners of his eyes, and he heard John curse hotly over him. Sherlock smiled slyly through the fading ache, and then pinched his own nipples until fresh tears ran down his cheeks and he was gasping for breath.
Without saying a word, Sherlock allowed himself to absorb the effects of all the grandeur, his silent gaze flitting around the room. Strangely, the house was quite similar to his father's. Although the Holmesian residence had never been a loving haven for Sherlock, it hadn't exuded the air of emptiness which greeted Sherlock here - in John's home.
John hadn't failed to notice Sherlock's brief inner struggle along with the increase in his arousal, and decided to tease him just a bit more. Although he pushed his fingers deep into Sherlock's body, he avoided stimulating his prostate as much as he could. A lusty gleam appeared in his eyes when he saw how Sherlock angled and turned his hips to get John's fingers where he wanted them. But John was prepared, and pulled his fingers back, not letting them penetrate deep enough anymore, instead settling for short, shallow strokes.
Then the shot, the pain, the unwavering belief that he'd received a mortal wound. His knees buckled, his legs no longer had the strength to hold him up, and then... nothing.
"I must say, this cigar is really worth it," John said as he settled into his armchair again. He took another long draw and let the smoke escape in a slow, controlled stream from between his pursed lips. "It's supposed to take almost an hour to smoke the whole thing."
It was hollow praise, as John was well aware he never would have drawn certain conclusions without Sherlock's and Mike's help.
With a hoarse cry, John found his release and let himself fall backwards onto the bed. In the fog of his diminishing climax, he perceived Sherlock still kneeling between his knees. He lifted his head a bit, only to meet Sherlock's burning, glittering eyes.
John sighed. "You'll find out anyway when you go through my account statements... I may have spent a bit of money tonight."
? That has to be the understatement of the century. This used to be a quaint, cosy flat – and you've turned it into a pigsty!" Her horrified gaze fell once again on the overflowing ashtrays, which she then pointed to. "And what is the meaning of this? I demand an immediate explanation!"
"I'll tell you what you get out of it: me." John spread out both arms to present himself. But it was getting harder and harder for him to curb his impatience.
“God, yes,” Sherlock gasped softly, not letting the hand John was touching him with out of his sight.
When he was able to distinguish top from bottom again, he was lying on his back on the bed, his ribs and shoulder sockets hurting like hell. He tried to sit up, but a fist that seemed to come out of nowhere slammed into his chin, and he collapsed back onto the mattress.
John set the glass against his lips, and with a quick flick of his wrist he tossed the gin down. The alcohol burned his throat and ate through his insides. But the gin couldn't cover up or numb the feelings of guilt that burned John's conscience.
It wasn't until John's breath brushed his cheek that he returned halfway to an awareness of his surroundings.
"TWO fingers, Sherlock, and if I hear so much as one more sound out of you, then you're only going to be using your thumb. Have I made myself clear?"
John snorted softly. “I'm going to tell you exactly the same thing now that I wanted to tell you five minutes ago. And nothing that you've said or done in the meantime has changed anything about it.” His fingers disengaged from Sherlock's hair.
"Perfect," Sherlock croaked out his opinion. It was little more than a wisp of air. But John heard it loud and clear, only realising a moment later that Sherlock hadn't graced the cigar with so much as a glance, having eyes only for John instead. He sat back down in his chair, a little embarrassed.
Sherlock sighed quietly and scooted in even closer to John, and all of a sudden it wasn't weird anymore to be lying together in bed just … to sleep.
It was exactly this desperation and the obvious effort that it cost Sherlock to comply with John's wishes that aroused John. There was nothing that could compare to the feeling of power that flowed through him at moments like this. To subjugate someone – another body – to
The cigar John had bought peeked out of the top of his outer breast pocket, in lieu of a handkerchief. Or rather... the metal cylinder containing the cigar. The cigar itself remained a mystery to Sherlock, which might have had something to do with the fact that he didn't exactly have the usual amount of blood circulating in his brain; it was cavorting in other parts of his body in a most pleasant manner instead.
"A cigar," he stated with faint surprise. "Why did you buy a cigar? I thought you didn't want me to..."
"No matter..." Irene said with a small sigh as she stood. "I can only guess what's brought about this sudden change of heart, but at least you're finally thinking of your health. I'll take it. That's all I ever wanted. You can give me your blood sample tomorrow, and I'll see what I can do."
"Because neither you nor I are going to get any kind of work done that way," John explained, this time with true regret. "And because I really do have some things to take care of here."
he got from drugs or alcohol. Was this happiness he was feeling? Sherlock didn't really have any points of comparison, but if this was happiness, this feeling that was stealing his breath away, he might just become
Sherlock realised once again that uncertainty was the worst thing that could happen to a distraught brain. He kept telling himself over and over:
"Of course," Irene said in a business-like manner, avoiding heaping further embarrassment on him, for which John was secretly grateful.
Irene didn't let him finish. "He's going to proclaim his love for you at some point. I'm sure if you tell him often enough, he'll... What is it now?!"
She stared at the number that was written there for a long time; it exceeded all of her expectations.
"Oh..." Sherlock murmured and scrambled out of bed, his eyes half closed. "Then it must be mine..." His fingers still asleep and his brain not really online, he fished his mobile phone out of the pocket of his trousers where they hung over the back of a chair. He answered it, only to promptly hold the device at arm's length from his ear with a pained grimace.
. In accordance with her instructions, Sherlock had taken his best, most expensive suit out of his closet, put it on, and gone down to the lounge to wait for his client.
"Oh my God," John whispered in a low voice... it almost sounded awestruck to his own ears. He let go of Sherlock's hair, and his head sank down into John's lap. What was he supposed to do now? He really hadn't thought that...
But when Sherlock sat up again, gave him a baleful look and said in all seriousness, "Your shoe polish tastes horrendous. If you want me to do that again, I'd be obliged if you'd switch brands," John's incipient arousal reverted easily into amusement.
Those three hours did him good, but his nerves were still on edge, and his emotions were still in an uproar. John's words had burnt themselves into his memory. His arse belonged to John. No one else.
"Insatiable," John murmured, but it sounded more like praise than reproach. "Fine - then you're getting the next size up too. I don't want you to miss out on anything..." The hint of mockery that sounded in his words released a fresh wave of erotic shivers in Sherlock's tormented body.
Sherlock’s legs started trembling and his whole body stretched while the movements of his hand grew quicker and quicker.
John looked up at the blue sky for a moment. "As it happens..." he started tentatively, "I do have a ring here with me."
"...you'll think of something," Greg said lightly. "I have complete faith in you. And anyway..." he whispered, drawing the word out.
An icy chill spread through Sherlock's body. "Moran," he repeated in a flat voice. His mouth felt numb.
Boundless relief coursed through Sherlock, and his spirits rose higher. John's hand still rested warm and firm against his back.
Sherlock bit his lower lip nervously before gathering himself. Thomas was always a bit too familiar, but at least he didn't condescend to him the way Jacques did, and he always served him with a friendly smile. Plus, he smuggled cigarettes into the house for him without squealing. If he were going to get a reasonable answer out of anyone, Thomas was his only option. He swallowed and then asked the question that had been nagging at him for some time now.
But that disaster was all past now. And it no longer interested Sherlock a day later, when John came back.
"Okay. Looks good," John decided, relieved. He smeared some cream onto the head of Sherlock's penis and massaged it gently into the reddened opening.
"It's just ... John?" Sherlock hemmed and hawed and John looked up in surprise. "If I... if I ever... can you promise me something?"
Greg stared at him with a look on his face that wavered between being placated, touched, bewildered, and irritated.
"You're a decent fellow, Sherlock," Mike said. "Do yourself and John a favour and stay in here tonight. Lock the door, don't let anyone in, and push the dresser in front of the door. Promise me?"
When he looked at John's face, all he could see was sincere concern, and the tears he'd worked so hard to hold back rolled down his cheeks.
The sharp pain in his testicles increased, as expected, making him squeeze his eyes shut. He panted through it, and wasn't able to open his eyes again until he'd acclimated to it and the stretching and burning had mellowed into a dull heat.
Mike stood up when Albright entered, but Sherlock merely glanced up briefly and then began to translate the half-finished letter into Italian, as he saw that John would likely not continue with his dictation in the next few minutes.
That was the second time Sherlock had thanked him in that tone of voice, and it was still unfamiliar to John's ears.
Although he tried not to let it show, Sherlock was looking forward feverishly to his upcoming appointment with John. Ever since noon, he kept checking every available clock, accusing them of running behind or being broken and having stopped altogether.
Mike stared dazedly into the distance, the phone still pressed to his ear. The dial tone sounded, and he wished with all his might that he could discount everything as some feverish dream. But maybe it really was better to heed Sherlock's advice (all right, it had been an order, but Mike refused to acknowledge that) and not tell John anything about Sherlock's suspicions.
"Oh, man!" his better half swore in annoyance. She rolled half on top of him, reached out and fished the mobile off his nightstand. "Stamford!" she answered in a curt tone that made Mike flinch.
Even without the visual incentive, the bids quickly shot up to an amount John would never have expected, and which rather surprised him.
John nodded politely and finished inserting the implant into the woman’s arm before sending her on her way. He rested his head on his desk and groaned. It was generally frowned upon to wank at work, right? He pulled his phone out and typed a message.
John weaves through the crowd of people, most of them hovering around the room he’s attempting to reach. A short blonde with an obscenely tight skirt pushes up in front of him and sticks her hand out in front of him.
-Sherlock’s shaky breath when he had pressed a finger inside of him, his cry when John lightly brushed against his prostate-
“Hold your hand out,” Sherlock said, lifting John’s wrist lightly until John responded and held it up himself.
"It'll be there when you wake up. A cup of tea, as well." John whispered, carefully removing himself from the edge of the bed. Sherlock's mouth twitched with sign of a smile, but then he was asleep again and John watched for a moment as his chest rose and fell softly. He leaned over the pale man and pressed a kiss at the edge of his curls. "I love you."
“Smart,” Lestrade said, waving a finger very near John’s face, “know your limits.” He patted John on the head and ruffled his hair, making the man feel like a particularly cuddly golden retriever. John frowned slightly and batted the hand away. Lestrade nodded, seeming to not even notice what he had done. “You going home then?”
"That's not an excuse!" John can't hold back his voice, the anger and frustration evident. Sherlock flinches slightly, but doesn’t back away. John releases a shaky breath, "He was part of my regiment, and I missed his funeral because you forgot to relay one message. It would’ve taken two seconds, Sherlock.
“Christ. We’re in an ambulance,” John gasps, tears of relief and laughter escaping the corner of his eyes.
"John. Say it back," Sherlock reaches out and touches John's shoulder, feeling him freeze at his touch, "Please, just say you love me." His eyes beg, and John can't quite meet them. Silently, he turns and exits the flat, pulling the door closed behind him hard enough to echo throughout the flat and shake the pictures on the wall.
John placed a hand at the base of Sherlock’s cock, giving a few light strokes. Sherlock’s head fell back. Grinning, John ran his hand down lower, over his bollocks, giving them a soft squeeze before allowing his finger to travel further back. He massaged Sherlock’s perineum, causing Sherlock to grip John’s shoulder and bit his lip to stifle a cry.
John pushes his face into the crook of Sherlock's neck, and he feels the small pressure of a kiss pressed into his hair. His eyes are fluttering closed, his mind and body fuzzy. He places a lazy kiss on Sherlock's neck.
“Said you guys were finally together and couldn’t keep your hand off each other,” She responded. John almost denied the second part, but Molly cut him off, “John, you’ve been staring at his bum for the last half-hour.”
“-and don’t get me started on sex toys. I used to think they were weird and kinky, but let me tell you-“
They hadn’t done this before, this thing that John was so obviously preparing to do. They had kissed, snogged, groped, frotted: yes. Wanked next to each other once, even. But Sherlock had never had John’s mouth over him, around him, never felt that wet heat on his cock, and until that moment he hadn’t realized how much we wanted it. How much he needed it.
The cold of December had fully washed over London and each day seemed to be colder than the last. The temperature had hovered around freezing for several days, flurries threatening to fall from the grey clouds. The first snowflake fell somewhere in Brixton and before long, London had become a city of sparkling white.
Sherlock didn’t return to the flat until after John was asleep that night, so John didn’t get a chance to talk to him before heading to the clinic the next day. If he was lucky, he could push sex completely out of his head for the time being. Hopefully, he’d be able to sit down with Sherlock and have an honest and adult discussion about this when he got home.
“Define well.” John tilted his head onto his shoulder in a way that reminded Sherlock eerily of a puppy looking through the shop window. The detective sighed, though it was more affectionate than annoyed. John peeked a lopsided smile, “It actually went okay. Walked across the room twice without help.”
“Shh,” John whispered, pressing kisses across Sherlock’s cheek until their lips met once again. This time, John didn’t hesitate to run his tongue along Sherlock’s lower lip and Sherlock opened his mouth enough for John to enter. John let go of Sherlock’s hand and curled it around the detective’s back to pull him closer. Their groins grinded together and Sherlock’s eyes flew open and his hand clutched at John’s sleeve.
“Lovely.” John’s breath reached the tip of his cock and something electric shot up Sherlock’s spine. John gently ran his tongue from the tip down and then back up and Sherlock spasmed at the new sensation.
He remembers himself yelling something; Sherlock’s name, most likely. He remembers Sherlock disappearing over the side of the balcony, John catching the metal railing and digging the palms of his hands hard into it as he searched for Sherlock below. He remembers that he couldn’t hear the splash, the ripple of the water as Sherlock landed in the water, over the roar of the wind.
“Oh, Christ, we’ve scarred her for life, haven’t we?” John said, wiping his eyes as he stood up straighter. Sherlock kept his smirk and eyes glittered.
Sherlock smirked as John settled his head back down to his chest, small ends of soft hair tickling his chin, “Of course not. You, however, are taking up a ridiculous amount of space.”
"Papa!" She squealed as he wrapped his arms around her small shoulders and hugged her against him. Her laughter became muffled into his chest, but it continued all the same.
“Sherlock?” John’s voice slurred slightly as he reached out his hand. Sherlock sat down in the chair to John’s right and allowed John’s hand to cover his over the sheets on the edge of the mattress.
“Yeah. Yeah, sure. Of course,” John smiled down at him and moved to lay back down on Sherlock, but the detective’s hand pressed against his chest, stopping him before he could, “Wha-“
“Sherlock!” John yelled, his tone hushed but still loud enough. He threw another pebble. After a minute, his phone vibrated in his pocket and he pulled it out, opening the new notification.
“You’re gorgeous,” he whispered, kissing the edge of Sherlock’s mouth, “beautiful,” another kiss to the other side of his mouth.
They sit there for a moment before Sherlock feels John shaking, momentarily panicking before he realizes that John is
"John," Sherlock says, peering over his him. John's heart is beating quickly in his chest and he holds back a smile.
“Sherlock?” He pulled away to meet Sherlock’s eyes, only to see them shining and overflowing, “Sherlock, what’s wrong?”
Sherlock did not hold much opinion on the seasons. Winter was cold, summer was hot, and he didn’t have much else to say beyond that.
“I need a sample of the lung tissue. If it’s the same as the last victim, Mr. Galloway here will have died from a gas exposure,” Sherlock said, leaning over the body as he pulled on a latex glove and opened the corpse’s mouth with a gloved finger.
Molly smiled and turned away, hesitating slightly. She looked over to Sherlock for a moment and then back to John, “So, I guess what Greg said is true?”
“I assume your brother’s sex life is not something you want to be privy to,” John gave him a quick wave and closed the car door behind him but was able to catch the beginning of an uncomfortable blush rising on Mycroft’s cheeks. John had no idea, really, if sex was even on the table for him and Sherlock, but he took pride in being able to make Mycroft uncomfortable.
“Do you want to talk first or can I go ahead and take your clothes off?” Sherlock said, his gaze dropping low to John’s stomach and then back to his eyes. John shivered visibly.
"It's Lestrade. We have a case," Sherlock says, pulling his coat around his shoulders before John can even move from his position in the kitchen.
"Good?" Sherlock whispers in a low baritone. John nods, a smile pulling at his swollen and reddened lips.
“I missed you.” He smiled up at Sherlock. Sherlock blinked vacantly, something in his throat making it hard to swallow. John frowned as the man disappeared from the window. A few seconds later, however, he could hear footsteps coming down the stairs of 221B, the deadbolt sliding inside the mechanism, and the door opening inward. John beamed. Sherlock only looked at the shorter man before turning back up the stairs, leaving the door open behind him.
John shakes his head once and blinks. He sends a cursory glance to Lestrade, not surprised by the shocked expression there, but is determined to not get flustered, “Uhm… Skating blades? I’ve seen enough sliced up fingers to know they can do quite a bit of damage." John replies, not expecting this to be any sort of revelation. Sherlock, however, waits patiently for him to continue, "Someone would have to be of a specific height and build to make a substantial cut like this."
"Everyone is finding their plants for the project. Don't worry, I already found some interesting species on the other side of the trail," Sherlock said, leading John over to the trail they had reached the campground through.
Sherlock looked startled as he blinked the tears away like he hadn’t realized they were there in the first place. A visible shiver went through him and John searched his face worryingly. Sherlock put a hand on John’s cheek and held it still there.
“Mate, there’s no way that boy is straight,” Mike replied, reading John’s thoughts. John blushed, a fact he was glad he could hide under the cover of darkness.
“Hello, love,” Sherlock squeezed John’s fingers and gave him a small smile, “How are you feeling? Physio go well?”
Sherlock pressed his lips to John’s to quiet him then pulled back and nodded, “I do want to. Eventually. Obviously, we might have to work up to it.”
They were both only wearing pants, Sherlock in briefs and John in boxers. And yet, all of a sudden, this small amount of material between them was too much. John skimmed his hands around Sherlock’s back, running lower until his fingertips slid underneath the waistband of Sherlock’s briefs. He pushed further down, kneading Sherlock’s arse underneath the material. Sherlock huffed, pulling back just enough to rest his forehead against John’s.
“Oh! Yeah, good thinking,” John pulled off and stood up from the couch. He looked down at Sherlock’s debauched, half-nude form and tilted his head, “God, you really are lovely.”
The woman looks between Sherlock’s bleeding forehead and John and apparently decides it’s not worth the fight.
“Nothing. Nothing’s wrong,” He reached his hand up to his face to cover Sherlock’s hand with his own and closed his eyes. “It’s progress. It’s good.”
Sherlock responded by pushing down onto John’s finger, causing the tip to press against the puckered hole. He huffed as John pulled his hand back. A few seconds later, he was relieved to feel John’s finger back where it was, lubed up sufficiently this time.
"What? That's it?" John's voice echoes after Sherlock as the detective disappears down the stairs. He sighs, shaking his head, and chases after the man.
Later, John waits nervously at Lestrade’s side as his team combs the river and banks for Sherlock (not his body,
“C’mon, you giant baby. Let’s get you home before these clothes dry on you and we have to cut them off.”
“What kind of gas?” Molly asked, giving him a wary look. Sherlock tilted his head but didn’t look up from his inspection of Mr. Galloway’s gums.
“I almost lost you,” his voice was meek and broken, “When you fell that day, I thought- I thought you…” The tears built up again and a lone droplet ran a track down his cheekbone. His hand gripped John’s face harshly, “I almost lost you,” he repeated. His head fell, and he looked down at his lap.
"Sally," Bill announced, looking across the circle to the curly haired girl, giving her a charming smile. She rolled her eyes but moved to stand next to him.
When they reach Lestrade, he leans over and says in a low voice, “You know ambulances aren’t soundproofed, right?”
Sherlock slapped the hand not in John’s hair over his eyes, mortified. John had barely just got started and Sherlock hadn’t even lasted a full
He pulls the sheets off, throwing them into the empty hamper and pulling clean ones from the bottom drawer of the dresser. He tucks the fitted sheet around the edges of the bed, shakes out the duvet and lays it on top, and throws the pillows in the closet near the headboard. He stares at the bed for a few minutes and then goes back down to the kitchen.
The detective blinked his eyes open in the early morning light, the smallest sliver of sunshine peeking through a gap in the curtains. He breathed deeply, running a hand over his face as he rolled onto his back. It was cold, colder than it had been the night before, and he pulled the duvet up over his face in defiance. Defiance to the cold, defiance to the morning light forcing him awake, and defiance to the fact that John had apparently already left the bed, leaving a cold void in his place.
They talked about some other cases and Sherlock even asked John about rugby, and by the time the conversation had dwindled, they realized that everyone else had retreated to their tents, the fire dwindling to mere embers.
After what feels like an eternity, John wraps his arms around Sherlock neck, kisses the corner of his mouth sweetly, and nods. Sherlock is excited, but keeps himself in check as he pulls out just a bit and shallowly thrusts back in. He keeps a slow pace, pulling out further and further each time before thrusting back into that consuming heat.
Mycroft rose and walked back out into the London realm where a mysterious black car awaited him, no doubt.
Sherlock follows closed behind, sent over by the sight of John arching, slack jawed and tight against his body. He falls, careful not to land on the smaller man and pulls John towards him panting and trying to orient himself. John’s got his faced tucked below Sherlock’s chin, heavy breaths washing over the hollow of his throat with every exhale.
John rolls his eyes. Sherlock really is infuriating, but John can’t help himself from one more kiss before heading out the door, running to catch a cab and call Greg to tell him he’ll be home soon.
Sherlock had asked Mrs. Hudson to help John with dinner and let him know Sherlock was “out and about with the good DI” but John was wary to accept too much help from their landlady. He had his pride and was reluctant to even ask Sherlock for assistance, so it wasn’t too big of a surprise to find the short blond standing in the kitchen, leaning heavily on one foot, with his hand under the faucet, while the lino was littered with ceramic shards and tea. The detective went straight to the man and grabbed his wrist, wanting to survey the damage for himself.
John gives a solemn nod. He’ll be out of his heat before the sedative wears off and he makes sure to tell Lestrade to inform Mrs. Hudson about their situation so she can check on Sherlock while John’s incapacitate. They split up on the landing of flat B and John makes his agonizing way up to his room.
“It’s not biology, it’s not pheromones, and it’s not my sexuality,” He’s impossibly close and his lips are so close to John’s ear he fights an anxious shiver. “
He breaks the kiss with a lewd smack, “Too many clothes.” His bottoms are too constricting and he pushes at them, wiggling and kicking his pajamas and pants off. Next he gropes at Sherlock’s thin waist and pulls at the waistband of his black boxer briefs for emphasis. There’s a shocking moment of cold on John’s damp skin as Sherlock lifts himself up to shuck off his pants but it doesn’t last for long before he’s pressing back down on John, their movements becoming increasingly more frantic.
“I am not– “, but he can’t finish. Is that what this is? Like anger, but more helpless and melancholy, with a touch of fear?
“From the amount of debris the smoker had been there for between 30 and 40 minutes. The officer was too focused on the amount of the time the murderer had waited for his victim to show up and completely overlooked the truly important evidence right under his shoe. Higher quality tobacco keeps its form when it burns off and, coupled with the silky bit of wrapper on the ground implies the cigar was expensive and bought abroad.”
“I’ll probably need another shower soon” John says temptingly, pulling himself up. “Maybe a warm bath..?.”
Crooked Nose is pushing his face into the crook of John’s neck. “Hell I might throw my lot in to buy this bitch myself.” The man’s breath smells like days old beer. He brings his hands around John’s waist and grabs onto the omega’s lower back, pushing his body against John’s. Seeing his opportunity, John throws himself forward and butts his head against the alpha’s. Tying his hands in front of him was big mistake and he’s determined to make them regret underestimating him when grabs at his kidnappers gun.
His gunmetal eyes snap open at the sensation of a warm wet cloth running down his back. He jolts forward, away from the strange sensation and immediately regrets the sudden movement. He bites back the moan of pain.  Looking over his shoulder at the intruder he sees a Sherlock with wide eyes, towel in one hand and basin in the other. He’s shocked for a moment and they just stare into each other’s eyes, alarm, confusion, and concern shifting between them, before John returns to his senses.
“You…bit me” John is shocked at the rough treatment. Visible bites and marks is just so unlike Greg, not since the first few weeks of their relationship when everything was so new and unsure. When the loneliness had settled and grief had faded, they realized they didn’t need the juvenile possessiveness. What they had wasn’t thrown together in the wake of Sherlock Holmes.
In all the time he has known the detective he’s never heard him praise someone else’s intelligence. Sure, that wasn’t exactly a ringing endorsement for John’s deductive capabilities, but it was as close as anyone is going to get, he’s positive.
“Don’t worry Sherlock. I’ve not deluded myself into thinking you’ve suddenly fallen for me.” John gets up and dumps his tepid cuppa into the sink. He doesn’t need those pitying eyes. “It was just hormones.” God knows the real Sherlock couldn’t feel anything more for him.
There are no more words between them for the evening. John knows he’ll be have until early morning to return to Greg’s flat (
“Please Greg I need your help.” Immediately Lestrade is worried his missed something, a serious injury or something. The panic in John’s voice disturbs him. “I need you to keep Sherlock away from me.”
What commences isn’t so much fucking, the rough handling John craves, but making love. The tenderness and romance John needs. When he feels Greg shift to reach the lube on the bedside table, there’s a part of him that wants to stop him. A part that wants Greg to just thrust in, rip him apart, give him an excruciating pain he’ll remember for days. As long as he has that pain, he’ll have Greg, the memory of who gave it to him. He wants Greg to own him, brand him, before he finds out about his transgressions and sends him away.
He let himself think for a second, as the pair maneuvered awkwardly into the too-small bathroom, that he’d like to hold John like this, wrapped in his bed, waking up with this pliant gold body clutching him. He thought about how his yellow hair would glitter in the morning light breaking through the window, the sleepy way he’d look at Sherlock, adore him, kiss him…
Something close to guilt still boils away in the pit of Sherlock’s stomach. Last night was as close to terrified as he’s gotten in a long,
Sherlock doesn’t understand where the pain is coming from, he thought this was all he needed. But Sherlock was a man desperate for a drink and John was an ocean tempting him with salty water.
He was teaching John his methods: the science of deduction, how to see what others miss, and how to use all the facts to formulate theories (proper ones, not the half-cocked
Sherlock worried about John, of course, but none of his injuries appeared life-threatening and he knew he would be of no help in the back of that ambulance.
and Sherlock’s mind is imploding at the sensory information. He grabs at the strong arms that are gripping the back of the sofa, caging Sherlock in. He doesn’t know if it’s to pull the blond closer or push him off. He should stop this right now, and he’s about to, when he feels John’s tongue brush against his. He settles his hands on John’s waist and pulls the man so he’s straddling him because he needs him closer
Greg squeezed his eyes shut and tried to take deep breaths. His thoughts are growing out of control, after all it was just a small bruise. Who is to say it was a kiss mark? It could have been from anything. John and Sherlock run the streets and alleyways like teenagers, bumps and bruises are unavoidable the way they live life. Is he projecting his scars from past relationships onto his current one? Unsatisfied with his thoughts, but unwilling to be with them any longer, Greg closed his eyes and drifted, hoping a peace would come with morning.
“I’m not trying to do anything other take advantage of an excellent opportunity to educate. “ With a petulant sniff, Sherlock hugs his knees, cramming himself into his seat.
Clients are nearly constantly visiting the flat and there’s no shortage of interesting cases. Well, interesting enough for the consulting detective to deem worth his time. It’s great news for Sherlock’s mind, and subsequently, their walls, but bad news for John’s social life.
It plays on repeat in his mind and he lashes out in his dreams: trying to stop it, trying to stop everything. He’s trying to save John, not just from the hands of a drug smuggler, but from the life that’s waiting for him when he wakes up, the life neither of them knows how to cope with.
Arriving on Baker Street always filled John’s gut with a homesickness since Sherlock died – or didn’t die as it was. Outside the building, staring up the windows that opened the main room of 221B to the world, John realizes he hasn’t felt at home someplace in so long.
any victims. Right, John?” John doesn’t answer, but he feels like a victim in all of this, as he wraps his arms around Sherlock without a second thought.
This whole bloody mess could have been avoided. If he hadn’t of turned down the alleyway, or if they’d called for backup, or, or,
At first, John finds the warmth and close proximity comforting. The stress of nearly dying at the hands of a madman has set off his solider instincts but as the adrenalin works its way out of his system he’s more and more shaken. His biology is telling him that he’s safe in the arms of this
“No Sherlock its fine. Well, no it wasn’t…but it’s okay because it wasn’t…” John chokes a bit. It was just biology. Sherlock doesn’t want him. It was just an alpha trying to claim a possible mate. “it wasn’t
I’m sorry John.” He still won’t open his eyes but Sherlock keeping an iron tight grip on his self-control to stay still and let John adjust to his girth. The unshed tears from a few moments ago are starting to leave trails down John’s fever red cheeks. It hurts, but he knows it’ll pass. “
He crashes their mouths together with such passion and force he worries for a split second about busted lips. He’s forcing himself in further as the kiss deepens, pushing through John’s heated flesh. The delicious slick grip on his cock knocks the breath from his lungs. Nothing could ever feel better than this. John breaks the kiss to gasp, his eyes are clenched tight as he grits his teeth. Sherlock takes a moment to gather himself as John breathes deeply through the splitting pain. It’s not horrible, not unbearable, he just has to force himself through the initial penetration. A small whine escapes his lips, and Sherlocks icy eyes snap to his face, worried.
The prognosis was not what he wanted. Surgery was unsuccessful. A second surgery is possible but unlikely to do much help.
“So it’ll be two different procedures meaning separate surgeries for each eye because each will require a different level of anesthesia.” John wasn’t going to get his hopes too high.
There was a steady stream of people on the sidewalk; it was midday in the city. They were bumping into the doctor, pushing him to and fro. A few muttered “Sorry, mate” but no one noticed the blind man stumbling around. He was afraid to move, not knowing which direction would take him toward the busy road and which toward his detective.
If John said no, right now, Sherlock would step away. It would take all his will power and that ache in his chest would probably implode.
” The fog is taking over his vision, Mycroft Holmes is slipping away, a blackness is creeping in. He can’t breathe.
Sherlock straightens at the omegas new behaviour. Why is John angry at him? He apologized for forcing himself on him. He’s clarified his disappointing behavior was a one-time slip up. He’s shown concern for John’s well-being, he even made sure that the blond was uninjured before he went to bed.
John can’t help but snap at the man part way through the disappointing vision acuity exam when all the damn noises become too much, “Sherlock. Get out.” At the agitated tone from the blond man, Doctor Hart stops fiddling with the equipment immediately.
?” He’s shaking so hard. His legs aren’t going to hold him much longer. John's still slow and hazy from his heat.
He lowers John onto the toilet lid and starts the water, as hot as he can get the pipes to pump out, “I can do that, you’re free to do, uhmm, experiments or, uh, whatever.” John’s mortified enough covered in bruises and his own fluids, he wants some time for self-loathing and pity.
-but running that warm cloth over John earlier had nothing to do with biology. No hormones made him want to kiss away each bruise on his doctor’s body or promise him he won’t let anyone hurt him again. It wasn’t his alpha side that told him not to use John’s favorite mug to hold severed index fingers. No pheromones drove him to play his most soothing compositions on his violin when he knew John was in the throes of a nightmare.
“Besides you can’t get too much worse at solving cases. Even with your vision at near perfection you still missed all the important observations.”
“Oh, sorry.” John said, his hand clasped tightly around the detective’s. Sherlock looked down at their hands intertwined, heat rising in his cheeks momentarily before he pushed it away.
Sherlock smiled and placed a hand in John’s hair. They lay there just breathing for a while until Sherlock broke the silence.
“So it would seem,” Sherlock replied, wrapping his dressing gown further around himself. “I see you’ve indulged yourself tonight.”
Sherlock paces for a while, raking fingers roughly through his hair. He finds himself climbing up the stairs to John's room. The door is closed, has been for a few months. It’s been unoccupied pretty much when they started sleeping together. Sherlock pushes open the door and looks around at the empty closet, the stale sheets gathering dust on the bed.
“Last week,” Sherlock replied, and John nodded and slightly, starting to turn his face back down into Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock stopped the movement with his hand against John’s jaw and their eyes met. John smiled tiredly at him.
They don't touch when the words are first said. They don't kiss, or brush hands, or even go within five feet of the other.
He was lying on his back on the sofa, fingertips pressed up under his chin. It had been a few hours since he had started, or perhaps longer. Sherlock wasn’t sure, being too distracted by the organizing of all the different sensations certain fabrics of John’s clothing felt against his skin. Cataloging them.
John comes first, Sherlock soon after, their bodies riding the high and soon relaxing as dopamine floods their brains. John sighs and rolls halfway off Sherlock, keeping his chest pressed against Sherlock's side, an arm around his stomach.
“You’re insufferable,” John’s words are affectionate, and the hand placed softly on Sherlock’s neck matches the tone.
That night, they started a fire and roasted marshmallows, Mike telling only vaguely scary, but funny, ghost stories as the fire crackled behind him.  John listened and laughed for a bit, but ended up staring at Sherlock, who was sitting a bit away, reading something with his flashlight.
John grinned deviously and pressed his mouth to Sherlock’s jaw, then mouthed his way down his chest. He pulled up the hem of Sherlock’s shirt and licked a circle around his belly button and ran his tongue down to his hips. John moved Sherlock’s legs to either side of his waist and ran his hands up Sherlock’s thighs. Sherlock looked down at the doctor between his legs and couldn’t help the broken sound that escaped his throat.
Lestrade, who is looking both extremely amused and little embarrassed, shakes his head, “Nothing yet.”
He hears the door downstairs open and close, leaden steps making slowly up the flight. He doesn't move, just waits until John steps through the door, hanging up his coat before noticing Sherlock on the floor of the kitchen. Without a word, he sits down beside him, their thighs almost touching, but not quite.
“The tremor’s gone,” Sherlock echoed, and his expression hinted that he would’ve picked John up and spun him around if he could. John felt a prickling in his eyes and only realized what it was when a tear rolled down his cheek. Sherlock’s face went from elated to worried in half a second.
Sherlock stepped around the coffee table and nudged John’s leg with his knee. John shifted over to make more room and the detective lowered himself to the empty space. He placed a hand on John’s knee, rubbing his thumb soothingly over the top of the kneecap. They sat in silence for a few minutes, before John kicked the cane on the floor softly.
John lowers his shoulders, the tension easing out. Sherlock being awake – and aware – is good. Very good.
"You- what? Why?" John leans back and his eyes meet Sherlock’s, brows creased. He tilts his head, then straightens it again as realization dawns on his features. He shuffles around as he stands up from the floor, standing fully and reaching his hand out to Sherlock, "I will never be mad enough at you to not want to sleep next to you.”
John clutches Sherlock’s shoulders and leans over him, folding his legs on either side of Sherlock on the metal bench of the ambulance. He needs to be close to him, needs to feel him, here, real,
Sherlock gave him a look as he stood once again to take the containers of food out of the sack, “His grandson was born last week. Handsome, apparently, though I think the opinion is biased. I doubt he escaped the inevitability of every newborn to look like a turnip.”
"Oh? What is that?" Sherlock asked, lowering the blanket lower until his whole face showed. The girl leaned in close, her hands cuffed next to her mouth.
John swallowed and sighed, “I must admit, knowing that she set this up is not exactly a turn-on.” He pulled away, keeping one arm on Sherlock’s shoulder, “And we haven’t gotten rid of Mycroft’s bugs yet.”
John readjusted his grip on his walking cane, his fist squeezing the handle tensely. He glanced up at the door of the flat for a moment before looking over his shoulder at Sherlock, who was pulling their bags from the back of the cab.
He leaned away and looked at Sherlock, whose cheeks were flushed and was looking at him with heavy-lidded eyes. At the sight of his desperate expression, John pulled them back together again, moving his mouth hungrily against Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock reciprocated with a sigh, moving his hands up into John’s hair. They licked into each other’s mouths and just when Sherlock was about to beg for
Sherlock’s whimper was lost in John’s mouth and the doctor pulled away, pecking one, two, three quick kisses along Sherlock’s jaw.
Sherlock shook his head as the strap of a bag fell down his arm and tugged his body slightly toward the ground, “No, no. I’ve got it.” John snorted at the sight of the semi-retired detective being bested by duffles and suitcases.
Sherlock’s breathy moan was interrupted by a squeak to their left. John pursed his lips and looked over, seeing Molly holding a fresh cup of coffee and turning beet red. John’s eyes widened just about as much as humanly possible as he watched Molly scuttle away to her office. The door closed with a distinct click.
"Why were you gone all last week?" John asked, just trying to make conversation. However, Sherlock's shoulders tensed and he froze for a moment.
"What?" John finally says, cutting through the silence. His voice is cracked as if he hasn't spoken in years.
His teacher, Mr. Dimmock, had announced two weeks ago that anyone that went on the retreat wouldn’t have to take the final. John signed up right away.
“John,” Sherlock moaned when John’s mouth was back on his throat, sucking a licking at his pulse point. Their cocks aligned as John lowered himself down and they both shivered in want.
The t-shirt John wore to bed, for example, glided easily under his fingertips when Sherlock hiked it up to settle his hands at John’s back. John’s canvas jacket, which rubbed roughly against Sherlock’s wrist when they held hands across the seat in a cab. John’s cable knit socks, which tickled Sherlock’s toes from under the table as they ate Chinese takeout.
Mycroft was already there, standing with his hands in expensive suit pockets. He didn’t seem to notice Sherlock’s approach as he stared at the gravestones near the base of the tree.
John frowned and walked over to Sherlock, who glared at Anderson before sniffing disdainfully and turning to John.
"I know. I know." John placed a hand in Sherlock's curls, pulling his head closer and pulling Sherlock’s head to rest underneath his chin. Sherlock releases a breath and closes his eyes. They stay for a while, feeling each other’s heartbeats.
When the door swings open, however, there are several pairs of wide eyes looking at them and John immediately feels his face turning red. Lestrade is leaning against his car with his arms crossed and he shakes his head when he looks at them. He gestures for them to come over and John shoves his hands into his pockets, looking resolutely anywhere but the other officers that he’s passing.
John pulled out, causing Sherlock to whine at the loss, but then came back with two fingers. He slowly worked his way inside, loosening the muscle more and more as he scissored his fingers. As John watched and felt Sherlock writhe underneath him, he became aware that he himself was very, very aroused, and he took himself in his free hand for a moment to ease the ache.
John smiled, eyes half-closed before he froze, his heart beating hard. They had never said that before and, truth be told, he never expected Sherlock to say it first. He knew, he
“By that, you mean you were watching me sleep in that creepy way you do and you lost track of time.”
“Oh, John! Have you seen Sherlock? A package came for him and I’m never sure about those kinds of things. It could be body parts, for all I know,” She said as she pulled her coat around her small frame. John stepped forward and helped lift the material over her shoulders.
The wood floor creaked softly, and Sherlock opened his eyes, though all he could see was the dark sheets still covering his eyes. Suddenly, he felt a weight shifting onto the bed.
Mycroft peered at him as John reluctantly settled into the back seat of the car. Anthea offered him a drink (
"Marvelous, John!" Sherlock waits a moment to see the smile emerge on John's face, and then turns to Lestrade, "Your suspect is her skating partner. He is the right height and muscle mass to have cut through her throat at the correct angle."
"Oh, yes. Sorry, love. Mornin'." John replied, having walked to the edge of the bed as he spoke. He leaned down and placed a soft kiss in Sherlock's curls, pausing for a moment to take in his scent. The doctor sat lightly on the edge of the bed. "Sleep well?"
“You really shouldn’t be embarrassed. If anyone should be embarrassed, it should be me,” John said, causing Sherlock to raise an eyebrow and shift his hand away from his face. John looked pointedly down at his crotch and Sherlock noted the wet spot emerging on his trousers.
"Sherlock, do you think it'll lose its novelty if you keep saying it so much?" John asks, knowing Sherlock will understand him, even though the conversation is quite unprompted. Sherlock looks up from his microscope and frowns.
“You’re not putting me through anything. It is what it is. And when it’s all done, we’ll go back to the flat and make love on the sofa.”
Sherlock makes a frustrated noise. John rolls his eyes and laces their fingers together, shaking his head, “Let’s go home, then. Lestrade, you’ll call if you get anything?”
The doctor has Sherlock’s trousers undone in no time, pulling the zip aside to grasp Sherlock through the material of his pants. Sherlock moans (quite loudly, he’s embarrassed to realize) and dips his head to meet John’s lips once again. John pushes aside Sherlock’s pants so there is nothing let between them. Just skin on skin, mouth against mouth, and soon he has Sherlock panting and writhing underneath him.
“Oh, you're so lovely, Sherlock,” John rasped as Sherlock pressed his face into his neck, restraining from biting his skin, “Just like that, baby, c’mon.”
Sherlock sighed as he placed a kiss on John’s temple before detangling his limbs from around the doctor’s body, “Fine. But this is all rather anti-climactic.”
Not only was it a way to get away from London, away from my sister, and do something fun, but also a way to pass Microbiology.
Sherlock was grappling at John’s back when his phone beeped on the side table. Sherlock reached out and grabbed it, wiping a bit of sweat from his forehead as he did so. John huffed as he watched Sherlock tap at the screen.
The doctor shook out of his thoughts to see Molly standing beside him, her cheeks bright pink and her arms folded in in discomfort.
John had already composed a response when Sherlock’s face appeared through the glass, his hair more disheveled than usual, curls sticking up in every direction. A smile spread on John’s face and he waved his hand in the air, the unsent message forgotten.
Sherlock looks up at him in what could be interpreted as shock. John presses his hand further toward the detective. Sherlock takes it, pulling himself up. John is engulfed in thin, long arms before he can process what's happening. Sherlock's breath is hot on his neck and the hug is somewhat stiff.
John shook his head and took one last look at Sherlock, who closed his eyes and steepled his fingers (probably documenting the experience) before turning toward the bathroom. Sherlock peeked one eye open as the doctor walked through the kitchen and studied the way his lower body shifted in his trousers. He shook himself and closed his eyes again.
John still had a self-indulgent smile on his face as he unlocked the front door. If anything, the doctor could be happy about the fact that he hadn’t had to pay for a cab or the Tube that evening. The trade-off of having to talk to Mycroft was rather high, though.
"I wouldn’t know." Sherlock finally sits up on the sofa, tilting his head as he positions himself upright. John stares at him until his eyes are too piercing, too intense, and he looks away to the window.
“The car is still moving, John,” Mycroft, for all that he was usually composed, was exuding a reasonable amount of frustration. John pulled at the handle a few times, realized that it would not unlock until the car had stopped, and turned back to Mycroft. When he did not say anything, Mycroft continued, “My brother does not handle sentiment well.”
Dimmock held out a ball cap with strips of paper in it and shook it in front of Bill. Bill reached in and pulled out a name.
John was just coming off a double-shift. John was tired. John was irritated. John was not in the mood.
Sherlock finds himself sitting against the wall for hours, beating his head against the sheetrock in between glances at his phone. He receives one text from Lestrade about a new case, but he doesn't even pretend to bother.
Sherlock stiffened against John as he came, clenching around John’s cock and crying out something that sounded vaguely like John's name. John slid in and out two more times before he was coming with him, shaking and pressing their bodies together.
Sherlock couldn’t say anything, just nodded as John met his gaze. John’s eyes gleamed and he folded one of Sherlock’s legs over his arm. He rubbed his thumb into Sherlock’s hip as he kissed his way down his inner thigh, pausing above Sherlock’s cock, which was now full and jutting up proudly from his hip.
"Sherlock," He said, looking up at the curly haired boy, who just raised an eyebrow at him. Anderson leaned over and sneered.
“Did I say that out loud?” John asked, tilting his head quizzically. He giggled to himself, falling over slightly in the process. Sherlock was there, suddenly, propping him up with his slender arms. Next thing John knew, he was on the couch, being covered with an incredibly soft blanket. He looked up to see Sherlock’s face near his own, the detective knelt beside him on the floor. John wrinkled his eyebrows, studying the man.
Sherlock, for his part, either realizes John's hesitancy to make their relationship public, or just isn’t prone to public displays of affection. They've had six cases with Scotland Yard since their relationship made the transfer from friends to more-than-friends, and they were yet to make any indication that they were together. No hand-holding, kissing, or ‘I-love-you's in sight.
“What’s that, John?” He asked, turning around. John’s eyes quickly came up to Sherlock’s, a shocked expression on his face.
“I wasn’t-“ John started but stopped at Molly’s knowing gaze. He gave her an embarrassed smile and she left to get her coffee before the entire situation could get even more uncomfortable.
John licked his lips and pulled Sherlock closer, pressing his lips to Sherlock’s jaw and working his way down to his neck. Sherlock released a breathy moan and ran a hand over John’s chest. Sherlock smelled of tea and expensive shampoo, and John paused to breath him in.
It was silent for a moment before Sherlock felt John’s lips against his neck, hot breath on his skin, and he released a surprised but contented sigh. John’s free hand traced up Sherlock’s waist, along his collarbone, and then up into his uncombed curls. All the while, his mouth worked at Sherlock’s pulse point, leaving wet trails underneath his jaw.
"If by 'this' you mean John and I sleeping together, then yes," He replies bluntly. John feels a blush creep through his cheeks and his ears burn red as he sighs.
John paused for a moment, though the patient was too busy talking to notice. He took a deep breath and chose not to respond. His plan to avoid thinking about sex today was absolutely bollocksed and his mind was starting to wander to exceedingly unprofessional places. Sherlock leaning over him, shirtless; John pushed against the wall, hot, wet kisses trailing down his neck; a hand snaking its way down the back of Sherlock’s trousers-
"Scientific curiosity," Sherlock replied, carefully placing a red and green leafed plant into a clear plastic bag.
"Alright everyone, welcome to the annual Microbiology science retreat. I know most of you are only here to avoid taking the final, but I hope everyone finds this week fun and educational nonetheless," he paused, looking around the group, and then continued, "The first task is to meet with your retreat buddy. Now, in the spirit of learning and making new friends, I filled this hat with all of your names so it's random. Hopefully, everyone will get a chance to work with someone they wouldn’t normally work with."
“Unghh..” John frowned at the incomprehensible sound that escaped his mouth, “Talk. Sorry. Yeah, we need to talk.”
“You’re covered in both of our…” Sherlock moved his hand in a grand motion toward their lower parts. John looked down and he blushed as Sherlock’s words clicked.
“Very good,” Sherlock said, leaning in and placing a kiss at the doctor’s temple. “Brilliant, even.”
Sherlock breathed heavily as John pushed in, pausing for a moment so Sherlock could adjust. John placed a kiss on Sherlock’s lips before pressing their foreheads together, sweating mingling together.
He doesn’t get a reply for a while and assumes that John has fallen asleep. He receives a new message as he’s pulling his (well, John’s) laptop off the desk.
The first time they have sex, it’s slightly awkward, John being somewhat nervous and new to the whole 'being with a man' thing, and Sherlock just somewhat lanky and awkward in general. It's no less amazing, though, as they get the hang of it and find the right rhythm.
“Don’t,” Sherlock mumbled into his hands. John lifted a few of Sherlock’s fingers so his eye was visible.
Alone, Sherlock tries to stand up, but John puts a hand on his shoulder and pushes him back down onto the seat. He pauses for a  moment and then turns to the ambulance door, Lestrade giving him an odd look before he pulls it closed. When he looks back at Sherlock, the detective has a peculiar expression, both exasperated and confused.
As if this comparison summoned him – as if her eyes were magical crystals connected to his - John appeared in the doorway, holding a cup of tea, still steaming in his hands.
"That should hold... Hopefully," He said, looking back over his shoulder to find Mike swaying back and forth in his hammock. He sighed and shook his head, "Not that you were any help."
Sherlock lit up with a ghost of a smile. He brought the doctor’s hand to his mouth and held it there, not quite kissing the fingers, but the sentiment was there all the same. When he spoke, it was mumbled into the skin of war-worn hands, “I brought ziti. From Angelo’s.”
"So, this week, the main events are the canoe trip tomorrow, the trivia tournament on Tuesday, the adventure hike on Wednesday, and then Thursday will be a free day until we leave that night. In between all that," he said, handing out sheets of paper to everyone in the circle, "you and your partner will do a project. It’s not difficult, just find a plant and use the books in front of my tent to research it. Create an infographic for the species, which you will turn in at the end of the retreat. And don't forget to collect a sample!"
Sherlock squeezed John's hand as he sat up, leaning back against the headboard. His eyes fluttered slightly before he made an obvious effort to keep them open.
“They found him,” Lestrade says, shoving his mobile back into his pocket and turning on his heel. John follows after him in a half-jog.
"Oh, we don’t have time for this!" A small voice rang beside them. Rosie poked her head in between the couple, exasperated. "It's snowing!"
“Still here then,” John mumbled as his cocoon of Sherlock fell away and he glanced down at his feet at the end of the bed. Pastel blankets and pastel walls and pastel cups with pastel pitchers. Sherlock’s fingers paused on his cheek for a moment before continuing their path.
“Patience, love. I don’t want to hurt you,” John circled his hole, slicking up the area before pushing in slightly. Feeling assured by Sherlock’s pleasure gasp, John wriggled his finger to start stretching the muscle. As he moved his finger, it slipped further into Sherlock’s heat, past the tight ring of muscle and eventually up to the second knuckle. Once fully inside, John curved his finger and pressed lightly.
“Possibly my method of reinforcement might have sent the wrong message,” John says, leaning away. He notices the cut still halfway treated on Sherlock’s forehead, however, and sighs, “I should probably finish patching you up.”
“Wow, that was a lot of words for this early in the morning, “John replied, sliding his hand up along Sherlock’s torso, over his shoulder, and finally wrapping his fingers around the back of his neck. Sherlock smirked.
His second patient of the day was a woman in her thirties, who was receiving a contraceptive implant. Apparently, there
"I do, don't I?" Sherlock said. He kissed her nose again and then her chin, and then was placing kisses all over her face as she giggled, squirming away from the small affection.
They were practically in the middle of nowhere, a kilometer away from a lake and twenty kilometers from any civilization. A science retreat, is what it was officially called. John liked to consider it the only spring break vacation he could afford.
"Oh. Okay," John nodded and decided to drop it before he caused any accidental awkwardness again, "On a different note, I have a question."
The sun was setting as Sherlock ran his fingers through John’s hair, cool fingertips tracing temple to jaw. His touch felt like home and everything wonderful.
“You said that yesterday.” Sherlock pointed out. John didn’t reply, only holding his fork over the ziti as he stared forward. Sherlock decided to break the silence once again, “She and Trent picked a date. You’d know if you would answer your daughter’s calls. Or return them.”
"Did I not tell you to let Papa sleep, Rosie?" John said, though his tone was light, and he had a smirk on his lips. Rosie lifted her head but did not move from her bed on Sherlock’s chest.
John watched the door swing shut behind Molly and then looked over at Sherlock, who was writing notes next to his microscope. Before thinking about it too much, he strolled over and wrapped his arms around the detective’s waist. Sherlock made only a small noise in response.
"I can think of other ways to wake you up," Sherlock says, his voice low and gravelly. John peeks one eye open and Sherlock knows he's caught his attention. He smirks deviously as he rolls his pelvis against John's side, pressing himself into his hip.
“Doctor Watson! What is Mr. Holmes’ condition? Is he going to make a recovery?” She prompts, eyes wide and mouth open in an innocent pucker. John waves her off. Unfortunately, she has caught the attention of several more reporters and suddenly he has multiple microphones shoved in his face. There’s too many of them, too many questions being thrown at him, and he’s finding it hard to breathe.
“You’re so gorgeous,” John said, placing a kiss on the inside of Sherlock’s knee. Sherlock quirked a small smile as John looked down at his flushed cock and licked his lips. John took the lube from Sherlock’s hands, settling himself in between Sherlock’s spread thighs.
John chased the last shot with a beer, a combination that he would regret when he woke up the next day with a soaring headache and a rising stomach. The glass slammed down messily on the bar, the empty glass tipping over as John disregarded it. He pushed away from the bar, steadying himself momentarily before nodding and taking in a deep breath. A hand clapped his shoulder and nearly tipped him over.
"Goodnight, John,” Sherlock replied, turning away and climbing into his tent. John watched after him for a moment, biting his lip, and then made his way to his own tent with a quiet sigh.
“Jesus, stop. You’re like a goddamn teenager.” John said, a smile gracing his face as he opened his eyes again.
“Molly. Have you started the autopsy?” Sherlock threw his coat at John, causing him to roll his eyes but fold the coat over his arm nonetheless. Molly snapped a latex glove onto her hand and looked up from the body on the metal table.
that he felt that way too, but it felt so sudden. Although, was it? They’d been together for almost two months now and time never moved like it was supposed to with Sherlock anyway. Oh, what the hell.
Sherlock slowly smiled and sighed, “The best declarations of love always include a threat of murder,” he said sarcastically.
"Decent enough." Sherlock removed one arm from around Rosie and placed his hand on top of Johns, lacing their fingers together. John looking questioningly at the circles under Sherlock’s eyes, but did not comment on it. Sherlock glanced at the cup of tea in John's spare hand. "That for me?" He asked.
"I love you more." His groggy voice said before he rolled onto his side and breathed in, a soft snore released from his mouth. John closed the door the rest of the way, a cheeky grin on his face.
John watched Sherlock walk toward the bookcase and start pulling books off the shelves, following the line of his body contrasting with the light coming in the from the street, “Don’t I know it.”
“What happened?” John says as he reaches the side of the bed, placing both his hands over Sherlock’s right. Sherlock makes a sort of grimace-like face and shrugs.
"So, you're smart. Really smart. Especially with all this science stuff. I myself came on this trip because it was either this or taking the final. You probably would ace the final without even studying. So. Why are you here?"
The room was silent for a moment until John could hear – and feel – Sherlock starting to chuckle. He couldn’t help joining in and soon the two were bent over each other, shaking in tearful giggles.
"Yeah and then you sat there and watched me do all the hard work," John countered, unzipping the tent and throwing their bags inside.
“…The sex is phenomenal, but I don’t want kids anytime soon, you know? Quite honestly, I’ve been put in positions in the past two weeks that I didn’t even think possible, let alone pleasurable.”
In hindsight, he shouldn’t have tried to outdrink Lestrade and the rest of the homicide squad. In hindsight, he should’ve just gone home, drank a very large glass of water, and gone to sleep. John didn’t give a damn about hindsight.
Sherlock huffed and looked up at the ceiling as John laced their hands together, “I wouldn’t have said it if I didn’t mean it.”
The room did look uncomfortably clean, and perhaps he should have been delighted. How many times had he told Sherlock to dust or tidy his books or clean up his experiments? Even in their aging ways, Sherlock still tended to err on the side of chaotic order and the tidiness of a tornado. It was unsettling, then, to see the flat in such pristine condition, void of chemical spills or make-shift crime boards pinned to the wall. Like he had come back home, but it wasn’t really home.
John pushed in further and released a strangled sound as he became fully seated inside Sherlock. Sherlock’s head fell back and he ground down onto John’s cock as well as he could from underneath him. John’s mouth fell open and Sherlock thrashed against him with a cry as John hit his prostate.
"Would you like to? Kiss, that is." Sherlock doesn’t seem at all phased by the conversation, which only irks John.
Rosie climbed on top of Sherlock's chest and lay flat, folding her hands under her chin and looking up at his face with her large doe eyes. Those eyes, sparkling blue and brown. So beautiful, so like John's. He never got tired of those eyes.
“There are things we need to discuss. One thing in particular,” the statesman said with an expression which was somehow both blank and condescending. John withheld an eye-roll but was unable to hold back a deep sigh.
“Sherlock? You okay?” he asked. Sherlock removed his hand from John’s grip and started back up the stairs, not responding. John followed behind, having to steady himself every other step.
"No, Sherlock," He leans his shoulder against the wall, leaning his head sideways, "Of course I want you to say it. You just- you can’t manipulate me with it."
“I don’t know anything, at the moment. If I could just get through-“ John puts an arm in between two of the reporters and shoves through the barrier, reaching the door in a few steps. In a swift motion, he slips through the doorway, pushing it closed behind him, and leans his back against it with a sigh. The handle digs into his back, but he’s not paying attention to it.
A flash of something hot ran through Sherlock’s chest and he had to concentrate for a moment to get his breathing back, “I- I want- “
Sherlock's eyebrows shot up and he turned his head quickly toward the window. On observation, he found the toddler to be correct, seeing the flurries floating lazily past his window. He turned toward her with a smile.
“Mycroft. I would say it’s nice to see you, but, well,” John folded his hands in his lap, unconsciously tapping his right thumb over his left. Mycroft lifted his chin and pursed his lips.
"Yeah, that was believable," John scoffed, watching Sherlock pull latex gloves out of his pocket and pluck something from the soil.
Sherlock scoffed, “Of course not. Dreams are completely random firings of synapses, there’s no way I could know what you’re dreaming unless you talk in your sleep, which you don’t… most of the time.”
Mycroft’s threat has been lingering in the back of Sherlock’s head since he came home to find his brother in the flat with his doctor.
Greg’s smile nearly blinds the doctor, “That, my love, is an adventure I’d love to join you in.” John smiles back at him, just as fondly, maybe more, because it all seems so perfect.
John” John’s royal blue eyes are wide and glazed, confused by his alpha, “I want to see you.” And John nods, understanding before settling back down, arms reaching up beckoning the detective closer.
Of course, it wasn’t the last time. It didn’t stop. Sherlock wasn’t a passing cloud in summer, he’d turned into a rainstorm, to a cold front, to a natural disaster. John tried to justify it, every blowjob in an alleyway, every fuck at Baker Street, every hand-job at NSY. All the time was intoxicating, it never felt like enough. John wished the feeling of being the sole subject of Sherlock’s attention would last forever so he wouldn’t come back for another taste, but he couldn’t stop himself. Every time he ended it with a “This stays between us. Really, Sherlock. We have to be careful”.
Everything Sherlock wanted to say was stuck in his throat: a simmering, burning mass of regret and anger. The next morning he saw an ugly violet and yellow bruise along the side of John’s jaw, leading all the way up to his cheekbone. John couldn’t see the hideous mark himself, of course, but it had to be painful. Not that the idiotic man would complain. The worst part was that John thought it was his fault.
“Hello, John.” The army doctors eyes snapped up to the bureaucrat’s face. A plastic smile crawls across Mycroft’s face, “Good. You’re here with us.”
“Sherlock, the men,” John’s panting and it’s not a good sign. The heat is coming on fast. “Those men, they’re Mori-….they’re his men.”
Spent, satiated, and hedonistic on the sofa, the two laid, a warm midday striking across their bare skin through the window. John would have been happy laying her forever, until he realized the time, shocked to see he’d spent almost five hours at Baker street.
“Shhhh…” He tries to calm John who is reaching towards him, wanting him closer, and needing to be filled. Sherlock wants to, gods, does he want to give the small man what he wants. His erection is throbbing, the knot already starting to swell a little around the base, and his blood is racing instincts screaming at him to impale the small body on his cock, make the world know whose he is. “Shhh…John
Not sure how many chapters there will be but probz around like 5 or 6. Just depends on if I suddenly get struck by inspiration. I can't give any promises on when updates will happen.
He won’t lie; the forced bonding heat was utterly unsatisfying when he could smell the tempting reek of fertile alpha so close yet he was stuffing himself full of cold silicone. Now he’s just sexually frustrated, trolling small pubs and bars just looking for a willing beta or alpha to make him feel full. He’s trying to tell himself it’s not about the sex, it’s about wanting a real relationship, but mainly all he can think about his having a real knot filling him up when his real heat hits.
Watching John unravel beneath his body is making Sherlock burst with pride, and before long he’s lost in the sensations. Pistoning in and out of the beautiful omega doctor, growls rumbling from deep in his chest; it’s like a high he’s never experienced before.  He wants this to last forever and it almost feel like they’ve been rutting for days before he feels himself catching on John’s rim with every thrust. The knot at the base of his penis, designed by nature to keep an alpha and omega together to improve insemination and bonding, is swelling to full size. Before long, Sherlock can only give shallow thrusts when his knot is inflated too much to allow him to move freely.
