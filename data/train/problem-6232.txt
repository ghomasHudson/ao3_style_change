The door to the unmarked room was closed. Peter left it that way.
“Not that. Not.” Phil tipped Tony’s face up and held his gaze, and Coulson looking at him like that was some kind of human truth serum, Tony was pretty sure. “Just…want to feel you like that. Want to stay on my knees for you, and have you in my mouth.  Want you to get to bask in it, Dominating, since you didn’t get to do it as much as you needed before, and I wanna bask in you.”
Even hours later when he and Steve returned to the Tower, Tony wanted to crawl out of his skin. Sunset had been the closest he’d ever come to letting his true orientation come through in a relationship. It had been she who had taught him all the fussy, old-world poses and words, who had provided a thorough introduction to all the possible tools and tricks that could possibly be used to punish a sub. She had never strayed toward actual non-consent; it would be virtually impossible for any Dominant, especially one with such a high classification. But much like Tony himself, Sunset had learned to sublimate some of her own instincts in the interests of business; the Dominant desires to protect and nurture were twisted into drives to control and to manipulate. Without Rhodey, Tony might never have gotten the hell out of there before revealing who and what he really was; thank fucking Christ for Rhodey.
“In 160 CE, what led to the collapse of the Han—”
—I’m a real fucking submissive, dammit, I can kneel even without whatever biological shit everyone else has here that make their joints into rubber!”
“Not at all. I just don’t make a habit of taking notes during my closing session with a patient. I like to just listen, and take a more reflective set of notes once our time together has concluded.” Hazy as Steve’s brain was with post-engagement and holiday cheer, it took several long seconds for this to compute.
“Show! Show! Show!” Clint chanted, joined quickly by Thor and Bucky. Even Cap—Steve cracked a smile. “You don’t have to show us the really boring stuff like socks,” Clint allowed graciously, waving a candy belt that he seemed to have stolen from Thor judging by the covetous looks the other man was giving the snack.
“Good.” It should have been annoying to be praised for doing something as simple as looking Clint in the eye. It definitely should not have made Tony’s mouth go suddenly dry, or the pace of his breath to quicken.  “And yes, to answer your question, I absolutely want. Try to get to bed early tonight, please, and make sure to eat a decent lunch. I’ll be up at one.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Just as quickly as everyone had sprung into action, they all came to a sudden, grinding halt. Steve’s enhanced hearing didn’t even pick up the sound of anyone breathing—well, no one except for his (their) dead submissive, who had stumbled to his feet and was staring at Coulson without blinking. For a matter of seconds there was something almost relieved in Tony’s expression, and a quiet hunger in the way he kept raking his eyes over Phil.
“Trust me, punk.”
Rather than webbing he walked to where he was headed, using the time to try to sort through his racing thoughts. When he neared the front door of the building, he drew his phone out. He didn’t have Gwen’s number, but he wrote on the wall of the Facebook event page.
“You did so well today. I didn’t have the chance to tell you, but feeding you was incredible. You were perfect and responsive, everything a Dominant could ever have wanted. I could have stayed there with you just like that for hours. Even if you never do anything like it again, I’m honoured that you gave that gift to me.” Bruce didn’t give Tony the chance to come up with a snarky reply designed to put some distance back between them. He always paired praise with some kind of remark about the shield schematics so that the discomfort of receiving such open approval was tempered with cool logic. It would have driven pretty much all Tony’s previous partners crazy to have him vacillating so rapidly between science and romance (or whatever romance-adjacent thing this was), but especially with Bruce the one really didn’t seem like a distraction from the other. Even in his own world, Tony and Bruce had always been intellectually compatible if nothing else, so it felt like a natural way to build on already-existing form of intimacy. Tony hummed in contentment and tipped his head back.
“You are ours to protect now, mine Tony.” If Steve’s gentleness while he warmed Tony up had been difficult to bear, then Thor’s warm sincerity, his talk of
By some force that felt like it came from outside of himself, Tony halted any further movement. There was no build-up, nothing like foreplay: Bruce’s finger targeted his prostate with singular focus. He circled the gland, glancing off it with various levels of pressure until he seemed to find one he liked.
How truly foolish had Steve been, to believe that death and ‘resurrection’ would change the fundamental truths about their lives? In every possible variation, Tony would always be Iron Man, and Steve would always be Captain America. They had charged themselves with the safety and security of the world, which meant that they would always be on the front lines. Always at risk.
“You don’t have to say it out loud. I’m not trying to get you to submit. I just want to hold onto whatever happened today for you, just for a little while.” Then Coulson held out his hands, palms up and held parallel between them. And Steve’s slow, numbed brain finally understood what was being offered: the chance to give over his problems, to hand them off to someone else. It was a perfect, horrible mirror of the way they would usually come together, and the grace and kindness of it stabbed Steve through the heart.
(See the end of the chapter for
” Masdee seemed to struggle with herself for a moment, but then she crossed the small space and wrapped a hand around the back of Talia’s neck. The agent stared up at her for several seconds and then flushed again, averting her gaze. “I’m sorry. I…well, I don’t know what people would have said if you’d asked them what they expected for my life when I was a kid, but no one would have ever said I’d get to see something like this, I guarantee you. I…thank you.” Masdee’s grip tightened, her dark skin a stunning contrast to Talia’s caramel tones.
“No abrasions or swelling. Nothing beyond a bit of expected tenderness,” he reported. “I’m going to insert a finger now. Tony, you’ll tell me immediately if anything hurts.” Bruce was efficient but thorough, planting one hand on Tony’s hip to help him keep still while the other worked inside him to assess for injuries. “No evidence of any internal damage whatsoever—no blood, no undue sensitivity, and no pain reported by the submissive. Tony is there anything else you want to tell me this morning?”
Tony was saying his name, but Steve couldn’t focus on that, couldn’t anything at all past the mental checklist he'd been writing all morning. He had to know that Tony was alright, he had to be sure, more sure than Steve had ever been of anything because Tony trusted him, he’d given Steve everything just as Steve had asked (demanded, really, because he'd taken it from Tony, hadn’t he?)
Should you have any grievances concerning term work grades, you must discuss your concerns with the instructor. If the problem is not resolved after that a meeting with the instructor, AIs are encouraged to direct concerns to J.A.R.V.I.S., who will make the final decision on all grading disputes.
It had been the perfect way to begin wrapping the vacation up. There had been weeks of shopping and decadent meals and sex and games and lounging by the pool and every other form of relaxation Tony could have dreamed of. He’d learned a hell of a lot about the rest of the team, and even more about himself. He really, really like exhibitionism; he loved being on display in front of the team, knowing they were hearing and watching and taking notes (sometimes literally—Coulson had brought an actual notepad as a prop to one scene and Tony had come in about five minutes); he loved anything to do with having his hair played with or pulled; he liked being restrained, but he preferred soft tools, leather and silk and rope, over chain or manacles. (He also did not like any kind of bondage that involved being suspended.) Other things Tony really liked but also felt conflicted on; despite the fact that he always waited for the team’s permission to come, actually asking still made him squirm, and the day Coulson had made him tell someone every time he got hard had been…overwhelmingly hot, and also just plain overwhelming. The non-sexual stuff was pretty awesome too, but he felt conflicted about nearly all of it. He treasured everything he and Rhodey had brought home from their shopping trip, but it still went against every instinct he had to let the team spend money on him. Food was still a big challenge, but he’d settled into a routine of cooking at least one meal with someone (usually Rhodey) every couple of days, and between that and the barrage of snacks that Bruce had resumed leaving around the house, his worst episodes of either refusing to eat altogether or wolfing food down out of fear were growing fewer and farther between. When Phil had set a blank copy of the exploratory contract down in front of him several days prior, Tony had been happily stunned to realize how much of it he could fill out now. All that had been left had been settling things with Bucky. Well…almost everything.
“Yes. Steve told him.”
Tony and Steve both reconnect with figures from their pasts.
Strange likely thought he was complicating matters. In truth Tony was surprised to learn that Harley was apparently involved in Peter’s attempts to recover Tony. He’d kept in contact throughout the years, but not as much as he would have liked, and beyond a bit of relief from the money he’d left Harley and his Mom in his will, Tony never expected the kid to feel particularly strongly about his loss. But the answer to Strange’s actual question arrived with a clarity that Tony rarely found in anything except science and engineering problems.
“So tell me everything we have on this new contractor, then. How are w—you guys going to take him down?”
“Good. Now, that wound on your side looks like it’s just about healed. Is that accurate?”
"Honestly I’m not sure. I think it would be hard to avoid them entirely, especially since some scenes don’t start that way but do end up going that direction, and I wouldn’t want to limit any of you by making that kind of flexibility unavailable. There might be particular scenes I’d have to nope out of, or that Tones might not want me there for, but we can probably deal with that in the moment without causing anyone too much distress.”
“One of the only ways that Tony…our Tony was comfortable demonstrating submission in public was when we went out for food. He absolutely adored being hand fed, and whatever qualms he had with his submission were never enough to take that from him. I’m telling you this partially because when we’re finally ready to go public, there will undoubtedly be events involving food and you need to know that people will be expecting it. That isn’t some kind of ultimatum; if it’s not something you’re comfortable with then we’ll find another way. But lately, I’ve been trying to figure out how to make your problems with food easier.”
Your questions were so spot on this week that I feel like y'all have a pretty good sense of where we're heading! (And, to be clear, I am in no way offended by this! To me that means the narrative is actually building the way it should, so I'm pretty damn delighted, actually, even if I'm sorry the Doctor couldn't answer some of the questions.)
“You know the team talks, right, and not just about practical things?” This time Tony was sure his surprise showed on his face, because Steve chuckled. The sound was low and dark and just a little bit arrogant, and the latter was so different and specific to Steve as a Dominant that Tony would have done anything to hear it again even as it also made him feel ever so slightly humiliated. “Oh sweetheart. I know so much about you already. Lay back for me and get the first toy slicked up and I’ll tell you just how much.”
Before long, Tony was sipping cold brew and trying to regain his will to live. Richards updated him on a number of projects that Tony knew for a fact the guy had vehemently opposed, and managed to work in no less than five passive-aggressive remarks about Pepper’s leadership, too. It was hard to let those ones pass him by, but he’d promised to use every advantage they had, including the fact that the Board was currently uncertain where exactly he and Pepper stood following his ‘return to the living.’ So far he hadn’t learned anything today beyond a highly selective, verging-on-inaccurate overview of SI (most of which Tony had known anyway), but he had a feeling Richards was saving what he considered to be his best point for last. Sure enough, as Tony started shifting in his seat and making offhand comments about having plans with his Doms later that day, it happened. Richards sat up and leaned in closer to Tony as if sharing particularly juicy gossip.
Okay, so this chapter was a beast. It was over 7,000 words long, and every time I tried to edit it down it somehow got longer. (What can I say? Wordy author is wordy.) It was also a particularly challenging one to write in a number of respects. So I would particularly love to know your thoughts!
I don't need to duck flying objects, right fam?
, too. Steve had been elated to learn how often he donated his work to organizations for low-income partners who would normally never be able to afford custom collars. He also made a lot of designs that accommodated a range of body types; Kala’s shop was one of only three in the city that made collars for those with necks wider than the industry standards, and he also worked frequently to make unique pieces for those who couldn’t or chose not to wear leather, or who couldn’t wear things around their necks.
“No apologies necessary. Really. Captain America was used as a symbol for so many things when I was under the ice. Some of it I would have agreed with, a lot of it I wouldn’t have. It’s…it’s really nice to know those comics helped build connections between our parts of the world, even before anyone knew Wakanda existed. Thank you.” Angzata nodded stiffly, apparently too embarrassed by his candour to speak further on the topic, but after giving himself another visible shake, he addressed himself to Steve again.
“Would you prefer to play hostage instead, Specialist?”
“No, sweetheart. I’m not leaving.”
Content Notes: Clint is still struggling with jealousy here (see note on previous chapter for more detail.) Pepper's account of her life at SI post-Tony also reveals some disturbing behaviours from the Board (including threats and attempts at intimidation.) The descriptions aren't graphic or lengthy, but if you want to avoid this section, skip the paragraph that begins "It wasn't a big deal!"
The Doctor already has some queries he'll be dealing with tomorrow. I'll also aim for another Ask Strange live event around 7:30 MST tomorrow, so feel free to pop by my Tumblr then with more questions (or get them in in advance if you won't be available then!)
Two nights after the failed movie night, Bucky insisted that the team observe (or more like resurrect) Friday Date Night. They’d started Date Night many years prior, primarily as a way to account for the uneven levels of intimacy between different members of the team Eventually they’d outgrown the need for such a formalized set of outings, but they occasionally still made time for it as a way to reconnect or decompress after long absences or stressful missions.
“Are you alright? It’s been a long time for you to not really go down much, especially following on such an intense togetherness during your vacation. If you need some time with your Dominants I won’t be upset. I can work from my own place for a while, or—”
“Show me yours first, Agent.”
“This is not a punishment, Tony,” Bruce said from behind him. Tony pictured Bruce standing there, flogger in hand, relying on the very last of his self-control to get through his spiel, and shivered again. “It should be intense, especially after that very thorough warm-up—”
“I’m so glad to hear that sweetheart. It was good for me too,” Steve told him as he placed Tony’s right foot into his palm and then began to gently roll his ankle. “I like it when you go down hard and fast, and I’m sure we’ll play that way sometimes too, but for this first time, I liked having you stay with me a little longer. And I like to let you fight yourself a little on the way down instead of just forcing you; it makes the full drop feel even sweeter when I’ve watched you work so hard to get yourself there.”
No warnings for this one that I can think of. As always, let me know if you have questions or concerns.
Tony’s first scene as a Dominant didn’t end up being a particularly extended one. Thor was incredibly keyed up, moreso than Tony ever would have expected from someone with so much experience under his proverbial belt. And the others, in between occasionally calling out suggestions and modifications to Bucky’s instructions, had fooled around on their own smaller groups. The whole thing had taken probably less than an hour, though there had been plenty of aftercare afterward.
“Mmm. S’early, Platypus. You going back to sleep?”
“Someone say my—woah, what’d you do, kid?”
“I am here, Sir. The time in New York is 1:42 am, and the temperature is 68 degrees Fahrenheit.”
“The carpal tunnel I noticed the other day—how severe is it?”
“Do we ask for the pillow, or—”
Steve studied Phil for several seconds longer, then laid his head on Phil’s shoulder with a weary sigh.
“I thought we were keeping hands off?” Steve whispered, even as he pulled Tony’s arms tighter around himself and interlaced their fingers together.
“I—yeah, if you still want.” Tony’s attention was half on the small troupe of Avengers jostling for space in the elevator with his helper-bot-turned-domestic-diva, but when he realized Barton hadn’t answered for a few seconds, he turned to face him fully.
He found Rhodey in Tony’s own bedroom, right where he’d left him. On the bed next to him were laid out a full set of clothes, including a cozy-looking pair of sweats and an unfamiliar t-shirt and pair of underwear. Tony picked up the latter first. They were black briefs, soft but relatively plain except for the lace panels that would sit above each of his thighs. He stared at them nonplussed for several seconds, then flushed as he remembered a throw-away comment he'd made on the contract next to the box marked ‘cross-dressing.’
“It wouldn’t work like that. Part of the release comes from knowing you messed up and being forgiven for it. If we punished you frequently on that scale for no reason you would just end up resentful—not to mention extremely sore.” As if to prove his point, Bruce increased the pressure of his hands on Tony’s ass and thighs until Tony hissed and tried to roll away “Punishments aren’t magic. They’re not going to erase years of pain and trauma and all their residual effects in one go. But that doesn’t mean what you’re feeling now isn’t real or meaningful, Tony, and it also doesn’t mean that all this won’t eventually help with the things that are hard. It’s just a more gradual process; it’s about learning, over and over again, that we’re here, that we aren’t going anywhere, that we’ll pull you back in line and remind you that you’re deserving of love and care and attention as often as it takes.”
in control right now, you understand me?”
And if there had been any doubt before, that was the end of it, at least for Steve. Submissives craved routine, structure, order. It was another aspect of their Tony’s nature that the man had so often despised, because he found it to be so at odds with the processes of discovery and invention. Like most aspects of Tony’s orientational needs, they’d managed through compromise, bookending Tony’s large blocks of unstructured time in the shop and the labs with morning and evening routines that weren’t optional except in cases of world-ending emergencies. If making a daily schedule, of all things, had been the thing to calm this Tony down and bring him up out of what sure as hell sounded like subdrop, then he might very well be some version of a submissive after all.
“Ah, yes, we thought we might experiment a bit more deliberately with the effects of Bucky’s Dominant register on you. I assume that’s not a problem?” Bruce dropped this bombshell with the distant, easy professionalism of a doctor ordering an additional test, then made his way to the front of the bench and held out the flogger for Tony to see. Reflexively, he reached out to touch it, but was stopped by the restraints at his wrists. Bruce smirked, then brought the crop up to stroke his cheek with a gentleness that felt somehow more ominous than any harsh words or touch he could have offered. “Do you have questions before we begin?”
Stepping backward into the shadows slightly, Tony simply watched. While the shock of encountering a solid wall of green when he’d been expecting Bruce had pretty much dulled his other observational senses, it was clear now that Hulk was…well, not agitated in that pants-wetting way that meant anyone in the immediate vicinity needed to clear out, but not post-battle exhausted either. (These were basically the only two states Tony had ever seen the Hulk in—again, he didn’t count the Bruce/Hulk mash-up that Bruce had turned them into.) His head was in his massive green hands, fingers occasionally pulling at strands of his and Bruce’s curly hair; every half a minute or so, he made quiet sounds that sounded like a cross between an angry grunt and the little humming noises that Bruce made when he was thinking.
Barnes was, as Phil had warned, shirtless and covered in marks. These couldn’t have been farther from the occasional wounds that were the souvenirs of training and missions, or the faded scars from Barnes' time as the Soldier. These marks had clearly been laid down with care. They spanned Barnes’ back from between his shoulder blades to just above his kidneys in a grid-like pattern that was almost perfectly spaced. (Of course, Clint’s unerring accuracy would be a boon in other situations than battle in this universe, Tony mused.) The skin underneath the raised welts was pink, and the whole area was glistening with the remains of some kind oil or cream. Barnes himself was more relaxed than Tony had dreamed The Winter Soldier was even capable of, grinning almost dopily to himself as Clint gathered up a plate of food for them to share.
“I going to. I have to—” Those were all the words Steve managed to grate out before he took off down the hall at a run. He didn’t quite make it to his planned destination; the sound of him vomiting spectacularly on the hardwood floor echoed through the entire penthouse. Then they spent another agonizing two minutes in silence while they listened to running water and the sounds of Steve brushing his teeth.
, he thought viciously. He hoped every word was agony.) “A man’s supposed to know when it’s his time to die, Stark. But you just won’t, will ya? Gotta keep rising up out of them ashes like that damn bird you were always on about—”
“Sir, I believe you meant to contact our HR department. The CEO of Stark Industries is not directly involved in—”
“Alright. And where is it at today, relative to that six?”
…” was all Tony could manage.
As Bucky had turned out to be a veritable sage when it came to all things Tony, no one had bothered to put up much of an argument against the idea of making the collar both thicker and slightly heavier. They also agreed fairly easily that they wanted to use a dark, espresso brown for the leather rather than the standard black; it would highlight Tony’s eyes, and stand out without making Tony feel like too much of an outsider in a universe he was still hesitant to claim as his own. That, however, had been where the agreement had stopped.
“So,” Phil continued without missing a beat, “you’re going to be sending me a daily texts, telling me something you’re proud of or like about yourself that day. No passive voice, no irony, no bullshit.”
effect, but they hit like a ton of bricks. He groaned, loudly, and had his face half-buried in Barnes’ armpit, like he was sniffing for pheromones or some goddamn thing, before he even realized what was happening. Several laughs came from the direction of the pool, and he didn’t even bother to look up to glare.
“You don’t gotta do that man.”
“Oh god please, please I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry.”
Steve didn’t particularly enjoy feeling handled, but he’d worked with Domen long enough by now to know that this was one of those things she wasn’t going to be willing to move an inch on. He nodded in the direction of the nearest camera, and JARVIS confirmed a handful of seconds later that Phil was around and had agreed to the terms.
“Tony, I’m not trying to invade your privacy. I promised that we would let your relationships with the others develop in whatever ways felt natural and right and I stand by that. But you haven’t been yourself, and I’m concerned.” Tony groaned, that dark flush painting his cheeks again. “Sweetheart, whatever happened, you can talk to me.”
“…doctor patient confidentiality?” May was not in any sense a doctor, but as she suspected this was a point in her favour, she took a swig straight out of the bottle and then handed it back to Tony. He immediately followed suit and then sighed. “I…it’s hard for me to see the others around Peter, and around you to some extent. Especially Steve.”
“You all blamed Thor, didn’t you?”
“Alright, sweetheart, since you don’t seem all that interested in food let’s have you head straight down to Bruce. I think you could use a bit of help this morning, and you always come out of check-ins in a better mood than you go into them.”
“I can be almost anything my submissive requires of me. If they need pain, if they need me to make them bleed and cry and scream, I can. If they seek me out for gentleness, for light touches and soft words, I can provide that as well. There are very few needs I cannot satisfy, and for however long our time together lasts, I feel completely worthy. Guiltless.”
The graves of Howard and Maria Stark had once been truly massive, paid for jointly by SHIELD and the Department of Defense as monuments to not just the man and his wife, but all of the ideas about America and American-ness they had once embodied for so many. Howard’s had been defaced within hours of Tony’s announcement; they’d called him in Malibu, wanting to know if he wanted to hire private security, or have the markers taken down altogether, or moved to a private location. Tony had told them to leave it alone, and now he could read weeks of anger and disappointment and hurt and rage in every scrawled message and crack on the stone that marked Howard Stark’s resting place. Maria’s stone had emerged relatively unscathed, with the exception of a few errant drops of spray paint and a single handwritten note propped up against it that read
“You’ve been up this whole time. You know, none of the documentaries or the obnoxious videos they showed us in school ever mentioned what a goddamn troll you are.”
“Please, Rhodey. I can’t…” The other man sighed.
Tony had been trying to balance the desires of so many people, even if only in his head, over the last few days that the thought of locking himself in the penthouse bedroom and just focusing on his own..err, stuff, sounded luxurious, almost decadent. More importantly, it sounded like something he might actually be capable of doing.
Tony, our Tony…he was a 1. And the last thing he would have ever wanted was to be in subspace all the time. But in order for him to be stable, to get what he needed, we had to find ways to integrate his submission into his daily life. Part of that was ensuring that he had frequent opportunities to spend time kneeling when he was in the common areas with other members of the team. It was…it was a special time, for all of us.” Bruce cleared his throat as if he were choking back tears.
“So Cap’s not coming, huh?”
“I know, I know, it’s just—I’ve never done one of these and meant it before. Even after we switched over from weapons there had to be so much compromising in order to pacify the old guard that had been there under Howard. Now they’re gone and we can just say what we actually mean.”
“Carol helped out with the photon energy. For the shield,” he clarified, because Tony’s access to his faculties became almost non-existent when Bruce started massaging his feet. He knew how to press hard enough to avoid tickling, and he even got in between Tony’s toes and manipulated the arches. Tony tipped his head back and made an aborted sound that would have definitely been a moan. “No, you're good sweetheart. You can make any sounds you want or need to. Aftercare is all about helping both the Dom and the sub to stay steady after a scene is done. It keeps me steady to know you’re feeling nice.”

“No no the muffins are good I swear. Or at least Bruce assured me they were, and he made them, and since he’s on some kind of make-Tony-eat kick I really doubt he’d supply substandard baking.”
Peter barely spared him a glance. His eyes were fixed on Steve as if might develop some kind meta-human ability to burn through him with a glance. Sadly, such power proved elusive, but eventually Steve seemed to realize something was wrong. He jogged toward the pair of them, a furrowed look of concern creasing the usually baby-smooth spot between his eyebrows. Peter abruptly hated him more for the show of care. How dare he bother when Steve, like Tony, was just going to abandon Peter too?
It wasn’t until he was practically fellating Bruce’s index finger to ensure he’d gotten the last of the juices from a particularly plump raspberry that Tony realized his jeans had grown uncomfortably tight. He had no idea when during this whole process it had happened, but he was harder than he had been in recent memory, and had zero smooth ways to escape the situation unnoticed. (Fuck fuck fuck why had he had to ruin this? Why did Tony always have to make it weird?) Panicked, he opened his eyes and looked at Bruce, attempting to gauge the damage. Bruce stared back, his pupils blown so wide the brown of his irises were nearly invisible.
“Are you telling me,” she said slowly, as if measuring and choosing every word with care, “that he’s subbing for all—or most—of you, and there are no daily elements to that? It’s all isolated scenes?” The blue Iron Man armour turned to stare at the team, too, and even though Steve knew it was empty, he still felt the weight of its disapproval.
“Hush now. That’s my decision to make, isn’t it? I decide when you’ve had enough. And you’ve been so good for me, Tony, so patient and obedient.”
“You have no idea how sorry I am to disturb you both, Tony, truly.”
“…dare I ask what BARF stands for?” Tony wagged his finger as if Coulson as a naughty child.
Tony and Steve discuss potential career changes and prepare to celebrate Christmas. The Tower receives an unexpected visitor.
Tony was, of course, famously outed as a submissive (I do not use the designator
“My first and only foray into spying didn’t turn out to be a major success either. I’m sure Coulson would have had a thing or two to say about it if he’d been there.”
Tony loved the feeling of leather. He’d been bound in a lot of different ways by now; he knew the way his skin looked all wrapped up in rope, was familiar with the soft clinking sounds of chain, and the silky smoothness of scarves. Other than the chain (which had felt too hard, too unforgiving of the moments when Tony would pull at his bonds, seeking reassurance, not harshness) he loved them all.He adored the feeling of being held fast and made still. But there was nothing quite like the feeling of a simple pair of leather cuffs around his wrists. They were buttery soft and insistent all at once, the kind of power that didn’t need to be brutal to be felt.
“But how...it’s disgusting that I was angry at them in the first place. I hate that about myself.”
Other than that, the only warning I can think of is that Tony remains somewhat at odds with himself about his submission, and especially about his relationship to the concept of punishments. That comes somewhat to a head in this chapter, and while I would firmly classify everything that happens as Risk Aware Consensual Kink, I again recognize that sometimes what readers feel constitutes adequate negotiation/discussion can vary.
“Masters. Did you just miss me, or were you after something in particular today? Besides yet another broken nose, that is?”
Tony nodded, stealing another spoonful of ice cream as he surveyed the scene. Most of the techs were gathered around a screen that depicted someone (or something, he concluded quickly based on the environment) moving through some very sludgy water. Every few moments, a series of readings would appear in one corner; the bot (and it was a bot, there was no way a human would be safe to interact directly with this kind of environment) was moving through a positively toxic mixture of salts, acids, benzene, residual bitumen and hydrocarbons.

“Phil never punishes physically, that’s a hard limit of his,” Steve reminded Tony. Both his hands were on Tony’s back and ass now, pressing hard enough to almost be a massage, though he was probably checking for scar tissue or other no-go areas. “You also lied to us in a few different ways that we’re going to handle separately. Phil will be dealing specifically with the fact that you turned in writing to him that turned out not to be your own. Bruce will be taking care of the fact that you kept back medical information that had direct bearing on our ability to adequately care for you."
Steve has never been one to hear and see people who aren’t there. Sure, he’d resented the fact of his utter isolation when he’d woken to find himself in a new century, but he’d never followed someone who looked like Peggy down the street, or seen members of the Howling Commandos everywhere he went. The one time he’d thought there was an exception—Bucky, because it was always Bucky—it had instead transpired that the world had stubbornly refused to be done with both of them.
Ah, yes. The matter has come up. You're correct that it's likely most useful for me to show you in this instance.
“I uh…I mean, I’m definitely not saying no. But I barely know some of you right now. I think I’d want to let things develops a little more first, then see where it goes from there.” Steve nodded, recording all of this on the team’s extensive shared contract. As he finished up, another window opened on the holographic screen; he opened it to find a copy of a handwritten document. It was Phil’s writing, but, according to the note at the top, Tony’s notes. Steve scanned them quickly. He was not all that surprised to find cropping and cockwarming tied for first place on Tony’s list of favourites; while highly responsive across the board, Tony did seem to find particular enjoyment in more extreme sensations, the kinds that took him over and refused to let his hyperactive mind wander. Seeing orgasm denial under his least-favourite was less expected, but he’d supplied an explanatory note. Tony hadn’t liked it, he said, when he’d thought Natasha was refusing to let him come as a punishment. He felt he’d be fine with it in other contexts, as something fun or playful. (Given how often Tony seemed to deny himself release except when given explicit direction or permission from the team, Steve privately agreed.) Under ‘most excited/interested to explore’ were two items: exhibitionism/display and humiliation. Potential scenes already swimming before his eyes, Steve slid the screen over to Rhodey, who grunted thoughtfully.
Truthfully, the last thing Tony really wanted was to be forced to eat a large meal in front of Natasha (and potentially the press), and he felt a vague twinge of disappointment. (He must have been wrong about them having picked up on that particular aspect of his food issues.)
?” Talia asked. Masdee turned to face Steve’s agent with her usual mix of grace and intensity. Her silence was the only indication she gave that Talia should continue speaking, which she did after a few seconds’ pause. “I just…if they blame Wakanda for not offering up their medical technology, Princess Shuri is the face of those advancements. Maybe the sale of the weapons is a ruse, a distraction from something bigger.” Masdee exchanged several tense words with one of her captains (C’Chemi, if he recalled correctly—she’d saved Clint’s life once, when he’d performed another of his heart-stopping dives off of a massive piece of scaffoling.) Then she turned back to Talia.
He wanted to say no. He nearly did. But Tony’s frustration seemed to go beyond his usual annoyance at having to voice emotions or preferences, and when Steve turned to look back at the contract, his eyes found the long column tracking experience. Almost everything was marked ‘No.’ A few had question marks, or were annotated with definitions and descriptions Tony had clearly pulled off the web.
Content Notes: The first scene contains a depiction of top-drop. It's handled fine, but still something worth skipping if it's a trigger area for you.
Steve hadn’t spoken in therapy. Again. It was getting absurd, he knew it was, but he had been awake for nearly all of the past three nights dreaming of Tony’s death with renewed vigour, and he was pissed right the hell off that Dr. Domen had dragged all this up again. It felt like it was doing more harm than good, and all Steve wanted at this point was to stuff all this back in the ugly, broken box in his mind that he kept it in most of the time.
With Peter well-occupied (Clint Barton, she suspected, was far smarter than his exceptionally pretty face suggested), it was an easy thing for May to slip out of the room and take the elevator to the floor where JARVIS directed her. Tony stood in front of a solid wall, peering at it like it contained the mysteries of the universe.
Mostly, though, Tony’s focus wasn’t on the big show-stopping moments, but on tiny and often boring details. He would rewind and replay footage where small nicks or tears appeared on the team’s suits, attempting to determine both cause and fix. He was forever tweaking the training modules in the gym and making minuscule adjustments to the Quinjets and dozens upon dozens of other acts of what was essentially maintenance. It was necessary, critical work. It was also hella boring to watch.
“Course you haven’t! Nor should you have.” He chortled again, and Tony fought very hard not to cringe. He didn’t even
Steve frequently thought that no matter how well he got to know any version of Tony Stark, he’d never become truly predictable, and this was one of those moments where he was glad he had never grown cocky enough to believe otherwise.
“If this is what you needed to feel confident that I am Tony Stark,” he said, gesturing to key images and findings of the report being projected on a screen behind him, “then here you go. But if you really want to know if I’m the same person I was before all this happened? Honestly, no, I’m not. I died. And yes I’m grateful to be back, yes I’m getting a second chance that other people could only dream of, but you don’t go through something like that and come out the other side totally unchanged. I lost my life suddenly, under extremely traumatic circumstances. My partners, my friends, all the people I love, they lost me too. And no matter how much I wish…” [Author’s Note: There was an extended pause here, where an uncharacteristically emotional Stark appeared to tear up and was comforted by James Rhodes and Steve Rogers.] “I’ll never get that time back, never get those people back, because I’m changed forever by what happened to me, and so are they. We’re moving forward, but that doesn’t mean we should or even could pick up exactly where we left off.”
“They’re never going to find where I parked my car.” It was a dickish answer, the kind of reply Tony only gave reporters nowadays when he either really hated them or really didn’t want to answer the question. (In the case, it was both.) When he glanced at Pepper he expected a head shake, or some other visible sign of disapproval. She flashed the peace sign and accompanied it with a little wink. Oddly enough, receiving tacit permission to keep avoiding this line of inquiry made it somehow more tolerable to offer something at least slightly more gracious. “Look, without getting into too much detail because a man’s dying thoughts should definitely get to be his own, I wished for what most people probably wish for: more time.”
After that bit of awkwardness, no one else seemed to want to touch Tony, but they all made sure to greet him (so that he knew they were still all on speaking terms, he supposed.) Several of them offered he and Rhodey food, which they both declined, though Rhodey did accept Phil’s offer of a beer. He assigned Tony water without asking, which was probably for the best given that the emotional hangover of the night prior was punishing enough. Finally, with all the niceties exhausted, Tony threw one last, longing look at the elevator.
“’s fine. I like it when Rhodey’s here. If I thought he’d let me steal him from the Air Force I’d keep him all the time.” Bruce chuckled, low and rumbly, but he settled Tony in his usual position on his hands and knees. The movement was enough to wake Clint and Rhodey, the other two inhabitants of the bed. Clint, familiar enough with check-ins to not be confused even by one taking place in his bed, didn’t react beyond a lazy wink in Tony’s direction. Rhodey seemed far more interested, sitting up with his back against the headboard and watching the scene with undisguised interest that felt almost academic, like he was studying how the team’s Dominants treated Tony.
Natasha drew her feet towards her, then threw them up onto the coffee table instead. Clint yelped and just managed to prevent his bowl of sun chips from meeting an untimely end.
“I heard that!” came a crabby shout from the hallway.
“Not again, man. We’re not fuckin’ goin’ through this
“The Ultron program was never intended to be the be-all end-all of global security. It was intended as a part of something bigger, a whole system designed to monitor, contain and engage extraterrestrial threats before they become local problems, which is when they would become SHIELD jurisdiction.”
?” he growled. Tony got the value of open communication and all of that, but there had to be limits, didn’t there? Clint wasn’t seriously going to stop mid-scene to have some kind of emotional breakthrough, was he? Because with everything going on with SI and then Peter, it had been fucking ages since they’d had time for more than what Phil referred to as ‘basic maintenance’ scenes designed to help everyone stay out of dep. As far as Tony was concerned, the world owed him.
turned out to be the operative word, given that she ended up seizing the wooden spoon he was using and slapping him not the ass with it halfway through, leaving behind a bright red stain on his jeans.
“Tell me your safewords,” Bruce said in a voice near a whisper, his hand sliding down to Tony’s low back as he guided them down the stairs.
. So she said nothing, throwing her left leg back and overtop of Bruce’s just so she could feel more of his skin on hers.
Tony wanted to think it mostly the result of his recent injuries, but Peter’s file had told a different story. Numerous hospitalizations, though none that SHIELD had managed to successfully link with Spiderman activities. (This was mostly, Tony had been horrified to realize, because Peter had typically waited 2-3 days before seeking medical aid for superhero-related injuries. He also tended to leave against medical advice, likely to avoid any realization on his doctor’s parts that he was healing faster than he should have been, or that there were unexplained anomalies in his bloodwork.) He and his aunt had minimal insurance coverage, which meant that the bills had started to add up fast; May Parker had several maxed out credit cards, and was working hours that had to be leaving next to no time for sleep in order to avoid being evicted from their third apartment in fourteen months.
“And what’s that?”
So why wasn’t he satisfied? Why couldn’t that be enough?
It had been a harrowing night, and Steve still felt wrung out as more and more of the adrenaline left his system. Strangely it was also probably the happiest he had been in recent memory, sitting and doing nothing with several of the people he loved best in the world.
! I know Coulson has a thing about his paperwork, but even he has to have a limit, doesn’t he?”
By short, terse agreement, the little trio made its way into Steve’s chambers. The second they were inside with the door securely shut, Masdee wasted little time. She sat down one one of the functional orange chairs that surrounded the small table in the corner of the living space, waited for Steve and Talia to do the same, and then addressed herself to the latter.
By the time Steve’s shock had worn off, Natasha and Bruce were already off the phone, and Bruce was trying to wrestle a sweater over his head that was both inside-out and backwards. Steve strode over, seized the offending garment in one hand and put the other on top of Bruce’s chest, directly above his heart.
“To get the stones back, we ended up having to go back in time. Cap and I were in the middle of SHIELD in the 70s, and it took us about two minutes to get made. Which honestly is two minutes longer than it should have taken given that I named myself Howard Potts, and he called himself Captain Stevens and we were generally the worst spies ever. We ended up stuck there way longer than we should have been, and I still almost left the briefcase with the thing I was there for behind.”
Even though Steve had been the one to put Thor in the air today, witnessing him hoisted several feet above the bed didn’t feel all that dissimilar from all those other occasions where he'd watched Thor fly. The suspension rig that Steve had meticulously assembled using Asgardian rope was holding Thor beautifully; Steve was damn near obsessed with the point where it cinched at Thor’s waist and then met a larger grounding knot at his groin, spreading out to wrap around both thighs and under his ass. The chest restraint required for the simple seated suspension was fairly minimal, but on a whim Steve had added a lace-up armbinder, so that Thor would feel the press of the knots all the way from his shoulders to his hands.
“Tony, what
And, it transpired, exercise with Rhodey didn’t necessarily mean running. After they ate, Rhodey brought him down to the shop where they suited up in Iron Man and War Machine and took flight. (He wondered with a fond pang just how much of a heart attack this would be giving Steve.) He would have been happy for a directionless wander through the skies, but Rhodey seemed to be flying with a particular location in mind; Tony’s attempts to ask prodding questions about their destinatio, however, were interrupted by Rhodey’s delighted and detailed inquiries about the Bleeding Edge armour, which he hadn’t seen in person before. Tony promised to add at least some nanotech to War Machine, which made Rhodey downright giddy until they both realized that Tony might not have the chance before—if he…
Given these social influences, it can be possible for some parents to predict with a certain degree of accuracy how their child will eventually be classified. However, especially given the fine distinctions in degrees when it comes to switch identities especially, it is usually easiest for parents of those on the highest and lowest ends of the scales to predict how their child will eventually be classified.
Peter experiences his first hangover, and promptly decides it will be his last. Steve speaks with an old friend…sort of
“No, you know what I would regret? What I do regret? I regret digging a child out of relative obscurity in Queens, dragging him across national borders and asking him to fight against half of you lot in a German airport hanger. I regret promptly abandoning that kid and nearly getting him killed by yet another villain I managed to create. I regret that child still ending up feeling so—so obligated or attached or whatever that he followed me into space to fight a megalomaniac without a second thought and ended up fading into dust in my arms. He has this thing, you know, this supernatural sense of when danger’s coming? So he felt it. He felt death coming for him at the ripe old age of sixteen, and he begged me to stop it. I couldn’t. I didn’t.”
“Let. Go,” Steve growled, letting every bit of Dominance he felt press into his tone the way he so rarely did, even during scenes. Tony tipped his head back and screamed as he came.
Ah, Ms. Everhart. Now of course, we know from previous visions that Christine Everhart was unintentionally involved in the outing of the D/s version of Tony Stark.
Some not insignificant part of Tony had truly believed that after he admitted to Barnes that he’d probably be sticking around in this universe, things with the team would start to change. It wouldn’t be anything overly dramatic or sudden. They’d start pointing out all the ways in which he was failing to live up to his dead doppleganger, maybe, or start hinting about how Tony could start making himself useful around here with weapons or tech upgrades. He wouldn’t honestly blame them, especially for the latter; hell, even if he was still kind of enjoying this unexpected vacation, it was only a matter of time before Tony was going to get bored and have to find some way to fill his days.
“Tony kind of…broke. None of us know exactly what happened, he was with Pepper and Rhodes and even they don’t seem to completely understand exactly what pushed him over the edge. But he had what sounds like a breakdown, both of which lead to panic and subsequent challenges with food.”
“But I thought…isn’t that what we’ve been doing?”
happen to…well, the towel underneath you is medical grade, it will soak up any fluids.”
May had heard what the team had said about the need to get carbs and fats into Peter’s overactive metabolism, she really had. But at the lowest points, the kid had barely eaten anything, so it still felt like a victory to bring the cake, still on its tray, out to the living room and watch the childish glee on Peter’s face as she cut into it and watched a cascade of Reese’s Pieces fall from the center.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea.”
In lieu of answering, Bucky fires again. Sam asks FRIDAY to pause the simulation.
TIME SPECIAL ISSUE: ORIENTATION AT WORK? WHY THE WAKANDAN MODEL IS LEADING THE WAY TOWARD THE FUTURE
As fantasy-Tony adjusted his position to hover over the dildo, real-Tony began fucking himself in earnest. This time he didn’t bother restraining his moan, too busy pressing back against his fingers and then up into his fist while he imagined being watched by a hungry set of eyes.
It would have been easy to fall into the same trap as Clint, blinded by anger and grief, and dismiss this as another self-important and largely irrelevant interjection from Tony. But if Steve had learned anything from this whole mess—Ultron, the Accords, Thanos—it was that Tony was almost always coming from someplace good, right, even when his execution ended up terribly flawed. (And those issues with execution were in no small part Steve’s fault; Steve and the rest of the team, who hadn’t ended up as much of team at all to Tony, in the end.)
“In fact I haven’t. Mainly because there’s a stack of outstanding reports with your name on them on my desk.” Clint blew a raspberry, and Steve attempted to keep his stern scowl in place. He’d actually had a chance to miss his partners this week, Steve realized. Between work and many of them catching up with friends or individual hobbies and pursuits they’d neglected on vacation, they’d spent more time without one another than they had…probably since Tony had crashed into their lives.
“Aftercare,” he hissed. Surprise and worry and frustration and about a dozen other responses left Pepper momentarily stunned. Since when was Tony subbing for these people? Could he even sub, when last she’d heard the entire issue was that he didn’t fit into the orientational classification of their universe?
“Yes, Clint,” Tony ground out. Clint nodded, the storminess passing from his expression as his submissive’s attempts to challenge him were halted, at least for now. He waved a hand toward his feet, and Tony settled himself into a cross-legged position. (Clint was right; he was just as beautiful that way.) The archer dangled a set of familiar purple leather cuffs in front of Tony, twirling them irreverently on his index finger. Tony’s pouting expression instantly transformed, his eyes following the cuffs unblinking and almost transfixed.
Content Notes: As you've probably guessed, Tony faces up to the consequences of his actions prior to the press conference in this chapter. It's proceeded by a lengthy negotiation (most, but not all, of which is included in the narrative) so there's no question of consent being an issue, but it's still a challenging and difficult scene.
No one spoke for the duration of the ride home. Well, to be more precise, no one spoke to Steve. Natasha spent most of the flight alternating between addressing Clint in that deadly whisper that was far more terrifying than most people’s yells and holding his hand while the medics used the mobile x-ray and then got to work setting his ankle.
Along with the weird compliments came what seemed to be a team-wide concern for his every comfort. He shivered exactly once, mainly because this version of his Black Sabbath t-shirt had even more holes in it than Tony’s other one; Coulson was on him in seconds with a thick, heavy blanket. When Tony complained idly about Rhodey’s shoulder being too hard, mostly to try to give the guy an out if he wanted to stop cuddling Tony, Thor fetched a large, squashy pillow, helped Tony lift his head, and slid it atop Rhodey’s chest for him to rest on. That was the last straw.
“I mean, yeah I guess I could see how losing so many people that young would make me more cautious, but it also made me…I don’t know, more aware that waiting to do things I wanted until they fit some kind of script or set of expectations for what life is supposed to look like, I’d just end up regretting it. Because nothing is—I mean, doing things the way you’re supposed to doesn’t mean you can be sure of anything, does it?”
(See the end of the chapter for
The gauntlet. Pain beyond any he had ever experienced. Pain that deconstructed him where he sat slumped the battlefield, the Infinity Stones glowing eerily at his fist. He’d worried that the power would be appealing, that he’d be intoxicated by it the same he felt after a few rounds of good scotch or a conversation about science and the universe with Bruce. It felt nothing at all like that. The world lay, quite literally, at his fingertips, a tremendous, horrible weight that Tony couldn’t possibly hope to carry, had never wanted to carry.
At one point, when they’ve turned the TV on to watch Ted Lasso, Steve reaches over and hands Peter a bowl of popcorn. It’s covered in nacho cheese, the kind that’s one ingredient away from plastic. Peter loves the stuff, and Steve is so revolted by it that he often tries to hide it in various corners of the compound.  Peter takes a huge handful, partly out of teenaged, contrary spite, and partly because he recognizes a fake-cheese-olive-branch when he sees one.
Ah, an excellent beginning with another sensible, scientific question. Truly, you readers give me hope for the future…well, most versions of it, anyway. (There’s always one where Deadpool ends up ruling everything, or I end up *shudder* teaming up with Peter Quill.)
Tony loved workshop days the most. The rest of the time his Dad had only a few settings: physically gone (searching for Captain America), mentally gone (booze was usually the culprit on these occasions), or emotionally gone. The latter times were the worst, because Howard would be there, right in front of you, and he might even be sober, but he might as well have been thousands of miles away. Those usually happened during the big fundraising events Tony’s Mom put on, though Howard had also been known to check-out during kiddish milestones he considered beneath his son, like piano recitals or elementary school ‘graduations.’
In seriousness, I hope you all are hanging in there. Thank you so very much for sticking around, and for continuing to chat about this story with me. Your comments, kudos, and questions are never taken for granted, not even for a second.
James Barnes has perhaps the most complex and conflicted relationship with collars. The collar he had received from Captain Rogers was taken from him during his time with HYDRA, and for a long time he mourned its absence and refused any replacements. He was convinced to accept one during the team’s bonding ceremony with the other version of Tony, but he must be in a very specific headspace to be able to accept wearing it.
“But—huh? Why? I thought we were doing  orientation stuff. I don’t understand.”
This morning, however, it was like all of those feelings were amped up to twelve. When Steve tossed him a sweater to put on over his t-shirt with a casual reminder that it had snowed overnight, Tony threw it onto the bench in foot of the bed in a ball. Immediately it rolled off the and landed in a wrinkled heap at Steve’s feet.
“Are you enjoying things here more now that you’re working with Phil, Tony?” Natasha inquired, something in her tone suggesting she was repeating herself. (Damn. He really needed to pay attention to the kind of remarkable fact that the rest of the team was here rather than dwelling on Cap’s absence.)
“Finish that cupcake and then you bet your ass I can help.”
It was over in under two minutes, Tony shooting ropes of come into the air that splattered his stomach and thighs and the sheet beneath him. Clint followed shortly thereafter, stripping off his shirt and pants and tugging his own cock out of his boxers without even bothering to take them off. That sight on its own, Clint too much in a hurry to bother fully undressing, was enough to draw another twinge out of Tony’s own oversensitive dick. Clint brought himself off with the same ruthless focus that he’d used on Tony, smiling in dark satisfaction as he painted Tony with his come.
Tony had barely managed to suck down a cup of coffee and take another for the road before Dummy had all but shoved him into the elevator, so it was maybe not all that outrageous that his brain took a good forty or so seconds upon entering the workshop to realize that he was not alone. James Barnes was there, listening to some godforsaken country western number and
Peter was still downstairs when Steve finally made his entrance. The guy looked exhausted the way he always did these days, and Peter could see the outline of the EDITH glasses in the pocket of his plaid button-up. From what Peter could tell Steve never went anywhere without them, and he seemed to spend the majority of his days tracking down any and all potential problems flagged by the system.
“Alright then. Take 24 hours and decide if you wish me to communicate a message to your own universe, or begin the process of researching how to return you to them.”
“I…yeah, I think I am. I didn’t think I wanted to, or that I even could, but secrets destroyed a version of you and I before. Killed it before it even had the chance to be anything. And if you’re serious about this—”
“In the meantime, as long as you both assure me you’ve had an in-depth conversation about your limits and boundaries and provide me with a copy of your contract to keep on file in case of emergencies, I’ll plan on turning a blind eye to whatever else happens.” Talia was barely listening now, he knew, so Steve mentally planned on repeating the last part of what he needed to say at a later date. But, even if only for Masdee’s benefit, he needed to make this clear as quickly as possible. “Agent Avelino, that means you’re under the General’s command rather than my own from this point forward. I will not be interfering with how she chooses to go about that any more than I would take over for another Dominant in private without clear permission. That will include if you earn any disciplinary measures. Are we clear?”
Since a few of you have expressed interest in the Avenger’s ever-expanding wish-list for Stark, I’ve provided a few of the items and accompanying commentary below.
“The bloodwork,” he said, in lieu of a traditional greeting. There was simply no point; Bruce at least tried to be more polite than Tony tended to be when he was focused on a problem, but the result was usually that he lost track of a conversation midway through and the whole thing took five times longer than just getting down to business.
“You want to stick around outside, make sure he gets out okay?” She smiled, shoulders sinking down from her ears and her hands moving away from her weapons in palpable relief as she turned her attention back to the scene in front of them. Spiderman bore all the signs of a true amateur; there was no discipline or predictability evident in his attacks, which ranged from a mix of street fighting moves to something closer to the graceful movements of a dancer. He was way too strong for what Steve could tell of his size, too, which had to mean some kind of enhanced strength and speed. More than either of those factors, though, what had always interested Steve about the guy was his kindness. He interrupted what would have been a devastating attack against the leader of the robbers to ensure the safety of the owner’s cat, and when the fight was over, he made doubly certain that all the robbers could still breathe in the webbed nets he’d caught them up in. Indeed, he was so busy with that that he didn’t seem to realize the police were finally about to make their entrance; undoubtedly they’d want Spiderman to stay, something he’d steadfastly avoided doing for months now.
“In addition to most of a roast and every imaginable side, I’m pretty sure there’s an entire specialty-baked cake in that bag. You’re not losing them over one no-show, Pete. I’m not sure you could lose them at all even if you tried.” Peter made a distressed noise of dissent that might have been a word and probably wasn’t. May gave in to the urge to card her fingers through his hair. “I don’t know how much you remember about how things were after Ben died. But pretty much the only way I could get through the days was to set one small, manageable goal. I’d tell myself I didn’t have to face a whole day, I just had to brush my teeth. That’s all. At the beginning, I usually went back to bed after that. But as time went on, I added another step, and another: I’d brush my teeth
be shut away from him like this. I am so close to being utterly out of control…”
THE END
“But what’s the last thing you remember thinking?” The guy in the fourth row, the one who just had to push it, was exactly who Pepper had insisted, contra Phil, that it would be: Jeremy something, an intern with Forbes who hosted a truly terrible podcast about the lives of rich businessmen.
stopped Thanos.
The drawers on one side were filled with compounds that he used for the web fluid, plus about a dozen others he supposed were suggestions from Tony. Other drawers were filled with mechanical components for the web shooters and cartridges. Much like with the fluid, some of the hardware was already familiar, while others seemed to be Tony’s attempts to make subtle suggestions. One of the cartridges, for instance, was bright green, and Peter would bet it was designed to be paired with some of the acids he'd seen in the other drawers. (Which, yeah, okay, acid webs did sound pretty awesome.)
“So I wondered if maybe we might consider combining those two aims—prepping you on expected submissive behaviours and helping your own issues with food—by trying out some hand feeding.”
“But why?”
“My aunt is in an assisted care facility. Everyone there tries their best, but the facility is very underfunded and understaffed. I’ve been doing some reading lately about the use of robotics in care facilities; they can perform simple tasks to free up support staff’s time, plus the more advanced ones have been shown to aid cognitive processes and emotional stability by making basic conversation with residents.” Tony used a holoscreen to take notes, nodding his encouragement; eventually, other suggestions started pouring in fast enough that Pepper began taking her own notes in an effort to just keep up.
“Pardon? Didn’t quite catch that.”
When he’d fantasized about the other Tony in the aftermath of his loss, it had been scenes just like this. Tony sleeping, or so deep in subspace that there was no room for any of the doubt or anger or insecurity that so often coloured his responses. Steve and Domen had had what felt like endless conversations about those fantasies. She’d called them idyllic, a descriptor Steve had strongly resisted at first.
, Tony. You were just as famous here as you were in your own world, maybe more. People
The Avengers battle Taskmaster while Tony and Coulson monitor events from the Tower. In the aftermath, Steve makes a decision about his future with Tony.
“Natasha, none of you are going to be left behind or forgotten because there is a full-time submissive back in this Tower. I know that once upon a time all you and Clint had to rely on was each other, but you will never be back at that place, not ever again. Do you understand me?”
“Tony.” But Tony had exactly zero interest in waiting for Bruce to figure out how to let him down gently. It wasn’t as if the reasons weren’t painfully obvious anyway; even if Bruce hadn’t been confusing his friendship with Tony for the love and attraction he’d felt toward Mark II, the simple fact of the matter was that Tony was not and could never be a submissive. Not the way Bruce wanted and needed. It had been foolish to ever pretend otherwise.
“And I bet you came by that title way more legitimately than I did. It’s good to meet you, Captain Birikha.”
“It’s not that I even disagree, but I was right there! You couldn’t have given me a heads up?” she demanded as she slid her shoes off and let them fall carelessly onto the floor of the towncar.
Tony wanted to cover his own face and hide from the disapproval he knew was coming. He was still fuzzy on some of the more nuanced rules in this universe, but one thing he was crystal clear on was that subs were not supposed to go down into any kind of serious headspace, especially one involving any kind of tools or scenes that could be harmful, without a Dom or a Switch in the right headspace present to supervise. Natasha appeared to know she was in trouble too, because despite the lightness she was forcing into her tone, she had started to squirm on the bench.
Tony’s absence still gave the proceedings a bittersweet kind of air, but Steve was coming to realize that that was just life after a loss as big as the one they had experienced. It didn’t mean he wasn’t getting better, or that he couldn’t still take pleasure in things. And he had enjoyed the morning with Bruce, enough so that when JARVIS alerted the other man to an incoming call, Steve felt a little grumpy about the interruption.
“I intended to make a point just now, and I do think we have a lot of work to do with your ability to accept praise outside of headspace. But I did not intend to cause you active distress. I apologize for underestimating the depth of the issue, and again, I’m very proud that you used your safeword to communicate your discomfort with me. Thank you.”
He didn’t consciously realize he was asking to see Pepper next, but when the images shifted toward a focus on her, he definitely didn’t argue.
The other parts of his life were a bit slower to normalize, but despite his more dire predictions, they were coming along too. The girl from Decathlon, who he learned was named Gwen Stacy, continued to mystify and infuriate Peter in about equal measures. Tracking her around the school proved nearly impossible. Gwen was constantly disappearing from one space and showing up in another without tipping any of Peter’s enhanced senses, which he hadn’t believed possible given that the other students often sounded like a herd of angry elephants when they moved. The one place she was guaranteed to be was Decathlon practices, which made Peter’s own required presence much more bearable. Even if she did seem to delight in pointing out what she saw as the holes in Peter’s education, which was why he was currently using his free period trying (and mostly failing) to make sense of
Peter spent the next several hours, in which he was playing with one of the rarest substances in the world, somehow more occupied with a gnawing sense of annoyance, which then fed into fury about said annoyance. How dare Tony Stark somehow manage to go from a hovering, frustrating, and highly confusing presence in Peter’s life to something he actually feared losing?
Tony considered this for a long time. He spent so long blaming individual players—Steve, mostly, though Bucky and Wanda and Clint also made the occasional appearance—that he hadn’t really put a lot of thought into how far back the dysfunctional dynamics between them all stretched back. Steve had been self-righteous and hypocritical, yes, and he had also been painfully young and broken, asked to lead a team of equally volatile and damaged people when he could barely figure out how to put one foot in front of the other in a new century. Coulson’s death had brought them all together, yes, but more trauma had hardly been enough to keep them that way long term.
“We need to have a conversation some time soon about boundaries. You can’t just—”
“Clint I got drunk and bitched about our alternative universe selves last night.” He expected annoyance, amusement, maybe even anger. What Phil did not anticipate was what Steve actually said.
“No. You look at me, don’t look away.” He thrust up again, then twice more in rapid succession. Tony’s mouth fell open in a wordless cry; he wanted to hide from the intensity of all he could see in Steve’s fierce gaze, but he was powerless to do anything but obey as Steve mercilessly brought them both closer and closer to the brink. “I see you, Tony. I’ll always see you.”
“Tony needed correction this morning. I milked him, and it brought him down extremely hard. He’s pretty much nonverbal right now, and he reacts badly to even the sight of clothes let alone the prospect of being fully dressed. There’s no way he can train like this, and while I initially planned on just the two of us skipping out, I think it’s actually a better idea for us all to take the day. Steve mentioned that he seemed unsure of how to handle having more than one Dominant around at the same time, and exposure’s going to help with that. Plus, honestly, he’s never been down this far that I’m aware of and I’d appreciate help caring for him. He doesn’t want me out of his sight long enough to even get him some food and water, and he’ll crash soon if I don’t.” At the mere mention of Bruce leaving, Tony made a discontented whining noise.
Tony’s eyes immediately darted around the room, reflexively seeking out the exits. His posture, though, actually loosened in response to Steve’s words. He sat back in his seat, and released a long, slow exhalation too controlled to be a sigh. The tension those gestures contained, the contradiction of seeking reassurance through punishment while also trying to escape it, was so perfectly Tony that Steve found himself oddly reassured. This, he could do. This, he was practically made for. He could already feel the calm sense of righteousness that came with punishing a submissive who needed it, needed him, settling into his bones.
If it had been anyone else entering Steve’s space JARVIS would have announced it, making this kind of surprise next to impossible. But when Bucky had first moved into the Tower, he had practically lived on Steve’s floor. Back then Bucky hadn’t trusted himself to be near the rest of the building’s inhabitants without supervision, and he’d also needed Steve’s help with getting acclimated in the world. (HYDRA had only taught him whatever was strategically valuable about whatever moment he was in when taken out of cryo, which meant his knowledge of the world was incredibly piecemeal; he’d known the basics of how to use a cell phone, for instance, but he had no idea what a microwave was or how to use it.) Even long after Bucky had gained more independence, Steve had never changed the protocols for his friend’s entry onto his own floor. It felt too final, like putting a willful distance between them. Even now, Steve’s pretty intense embarrassment about the position he’d been found in was still secondary to the pleasure of having Bucky just stroll in, casually confident in his place in Steve’s life and apartment.
The shot depicted Tony—not the one currently asleep in the penthouse, but the one the team had originally known. He was slumped but unnaturally still against a long white couch, veins protruding unnaturally in his face and neck, his eyes bloodshot. Obidiah Stane loomed over him, crooning as if to a lover as he removed the arc reactor that was keeping Tony alive from inside his chest. Phil thought, just as he had the first and only other occasion he’d witnessed this video, how much it resembled sexual assault.
) Tony shuddered with enough violence that some of the penne slid off the dish and onto the floor with a wet thwap. The worst part about all of it was that Tony couldn’t decide between being pissed at Bruce for prying or pleased, maybe even relieved, that he’d bothered to notice. (Pathetic, Stark, really.) “Not ready to talk about it?”
“Hold up, did you
“Yellow.”
Steve stepped off the elevator and into the penthouse level and found himself alone with Natasha and Tony. They were both dressed to the nines and quite obviously just returned from a date; as they stood in the kitchen and debated the merits of dessert-wine versus tea, Natasha kept finding excuses to brush up against Tony, an arm here, a hip there. The little efforts at flirtation appeared mostly one-sided, at least until Tony leaned down to whisper something into Natasha’s ear, a slight growl to his voice that Steve recognized well.
“Of course, Henry, I’m sorry. Yes, I’m coming in. I just needed to work myself up to it, i guess.”
He paused, fingers hovering over the screen, then added
been doing—remaining on the verge of Dominant deprivation, rarely eating enough to satisfy your metabolism, isolating yourself—should be counted as self-harming behaviours. But I concur that you didn’t make any of the larger scale attempts at self-sacrifice that typified your other major losses. Why do you think that is, Steve?”
“Submissive high. Sometimes when the endorphins from the pain of a punishment combine with the emotional release of being forgiven, a sub can experience intense feelings of euphoria. It seems particularly intense with you, which I’m guessing comes from a combination of how much crap you’ve been carrying around with you, and the fact that subtonin is still pretty new to your system.” The distant sound of liquid squirting from a bottle proceeded his hands on Tony’s ass by seconds; whatever oil or cream he was putting on smelled like aloe, and it dulled some of the harshest edges of the hurt just slightly. Tony didn’t know if he felt more betrayed by that, or by the implication that this was all just temporary, some kind of lie his brain was telling him.
Thor landed a second hit, and Tony burst immediately into loud, unrestrained tears.
“I’m surprised to see you’ve stepped out with your team for the first time without your collar.”
Tony couldn't even begin to respond to praise like that, could barely even force himself to listen without putting his fingers in his ears and shouting nonsense to drown it out. Phil, thankfully, didn’t force the matter, and instead moved on entirely after only a few moments.
“Not today, Captain Tightass. My employers are extremely generous, and they want to see the job done right. It’s so good to have corporate sponsorship, don’t you think? You ever thought about going branded?” He threw his replica of Steve’s own shield (which was never going to stop bothering Steve, no matter how many times the team pointed out its inferiority.) Steve dodged, and watched as the offending copy ricocheted off the wall and toward the Hulk. Which, God help it if it connected. (Maybe Steve would finally be rid of the thing after all.)
“No thanks. It’s uh…I’m working on trying to be a little more independent sometimes.” He knew that Natasha, at least, would pick up on what he wasn’t saying outright (that this was part of his therapy, and that he was nervous as hell about it.) But her reaction, as usual, gave nothing away.
“I need a job.”
The session with Phil wasn’t much easier. He was given a prompt to work with for what he’d mentally taken to referring to as Coulson’s ‘Make Tony Love Tony’ project (“Get outside yourself, away from the patterns your brain is used to. Assess yourself objectively, like you’re an employee. Find one word, a single word that conveys something valuable about who you are.”) Eventually, remembering a phone call with Harley that felt both like it had happened lifetimes ago and like it had just taken place yesterday, he scribbled ‘engineer’ and handed the page off to Phil.
Of course he had. Working with Coulson had been a good distraction, it had meant Tony hadn’t verged into having time to overthink this conversation, but he’d still had downtime during which he’d obsessed about little else. The way he’d felt with Bruce…nothing Tony had tried in the kinky realm had felt remotely like that. The feeding thing should have been boring and awkward at best, deeply humiliating at worst, and instead it had been like Bruce had stripped Tony down into his barest, most essential parts. By providing for him in such a basic way, Bruce had effortlessly torn away decades worth of defenses until Tony had been nothing but just…need.
“It wasn’t enough. Already he’s convinced himself he’ll never need anything like it again, when it’s so painfully obvious that he needs the 24/7 parts of the dynamic way more than anything else.” Bruce hummed thoughtfully, a familiar and comforting sound that reached down inside Natasha two soothe and calm. “I was terrified the entire time, and yet I’m so sure that if we keep moving this slowly we’ll lose him. We need…I don’t know what we need.”
Tony had always listened better to words than to actions, and Steve’s hold on his own instincts was razor-thin and fraying by the second. When he finally made the conscious decision to let go, to show Tony instead of telling him, he had the submissive hoisted up and into his arms in seconds. Steve was very nearly out of control; he barely remembered to get a hand up and behind Tony’s head before they collided with the nearest wall. He kissed Tony the way he had never let himself before, with everything that was wild and desperate and almost frightening about how much he loved this man pressed into it, not hidden away and carefully doled out in more manageable portions. It was Dominance, yes, but it was the kind of Dominant headspace Steve rarely let himself reach because it took him over, broke him down into a base set of needs—to pleasure, to care, to protect—that pushed everything else out of his mind. Tony whimpered and Steve tried to wrench their mouths apart, to ensure that he hadn’t gone too far, too fast. Tony put two hands in his hair and pulled.
“Gwen! I’m really sorry I couldn’t make it to the show on Friday. How’d it go?” An odd expression slid across her face, but when Gwen shrugged with her usual air of nonchalance, Peter decided he must have imagined it.
“Phil has Tony designing a top secret training module that even he doesn’t know the details of. And I wasn’t cheating, Thor, simply…gathering relevant data. It’s hardly my fault you’re all brawn.” Reflexively, Tony winced; Thor’s once ridiculous ego had taken such a massive hit following the series of catastrophic setbacks he’d faced that such a joke would have been in extremely poor taste in Tony’s world. Here, though, Thor just laughed and threw a colourful knitted potholder at Bruce’s head.
Loki was released from Asgardian prison when it came to light (through a series of equally important events which I shall not derail here) that he himself had been under mental duress and influence from the so-called Mad Titan, Thanos. Loki still occasionally makes appearances on Earth, but his efforts are far less focused on dictatorial control and more on the kinds of mischief he has been famous on Asgard for for centuries.
“After the press conference?” He confirmed the guess with a short nod. “The tailors are coming by in fifteen minutes, we don’t have enough time to get into this now I suppose. Meet me tonight, fill me in on the details?” He hesitated, and her gaze narrowed. "I’ve had enough surprises from you for several lifetimes, Tony, you owe me this at least.”
Rhodey took a step backward, visibly stunned on a level comparable to when he’d found Tony in the desert with a new chest accessory. Steve, though, well he’d long ago guessed at the truth of it, hadn’t he? Ignoring the numerous protesters from the others, Steve gathered the splattered eggs and crushed fruit off the floor and back onto Tony’s plate, setting it front of him with the air of someone who knew intimately just how precious food became when it was low or gone.
Steve's flashbacks also contain a brief representation of Tony in the immediate aftermath of being outed as a sub by Christine Everhart. He's drunk angry and hurting and tries to goad Steve into Dominating him, which Steve of course doesn't do. If you want to avoid that, just skip the italicized bit in Steve's section.
Tony hoped that was true; for now, he had to believe it was. Slowly, the urgent want that had surged in him when he’d heard Steve describing his fantasy gave way to the slow, easy pleasure of just being together. He pressed himself back against Steve again, just to feel him close, and let himself imagine that he could really have this forever.
him. I know some of that shit is necessary for the press, but that makes it even more important that it not creep into the rest of your life. You’re
“I see you are absolutely devastated by the prospect of leaving us,” Domen said drily. Steve tried for an apologetic expression, but she rolled her eyes. “Don’t bother. I’m truly glad you’re content in your decision. Any plans for the future you wish to share?”
“Take me through it again.” It pained Tony to make the request. He had never been someone who required information be repeated, a habit he’d come by the same way as most: from good ol’ Dad, who had often feigned temporary hearing impairment when Tony hadn’t understood him the first time he’d said something. Tony had learned to piece most things together with contextual clues, and to bluster through when he still felt like he was missing something but didn’t dare ask what it was.
“Yessir,” Tony muttered.
“Do you want us to go, Tony?” Bruce offered. Bucky made a half-growling, half-whining noise that somehow managed to sound both protective and protesting. Steve identified with both.
“Tony’s job today is to observe. We’re mainly going to use TV for that, because we can’t go outside so it’s the closest we can get to an on-the-ground view of everyday life. Try to pay particular attention to social norms or everyday things in the programming or even in ads that aren’t the same as your universe, Tony; it’ll give us a clearer idea of where we’ll need to devote the most time when you’re closer to needing to perform this role for real.” Watching TV felt weirdly anticlimactic given what Tony had come into the room expecting, but the logic behind the decision was sound; it was the same way recent migrants often learned the language of their new countries, after all, and orientation was essentially a new embodied language for him. And it was definitely preferable to Nat pulling out a whip or something. He nodded in acknowledgement, but couldn’t keep his eyes off of Phil, who was frozen in place, staring between Natasha and the plates in his hand. “However, in addition to needing a sense of how orientation in general functions, you’ll also have to get acclimated to the specific dynamics of the Tower. No one’s going to be explicitly sexual in front of you, Tony, and if there’s anything you’re ever uncomfortable witnessing you can always say so. But orientation…it really does effect most every aspect of our lives. There are things we need to stay well and safe and fulfilled, and it’s not realistic or sustainable in the long term to confine them only to private bedrooms.”
“What, you think you’re the hero right now? You realize that by ‘saving’ me from the terrible fate of a light collision with a sheet of glass, you may in fact have broken my tailbone, right? My ass is definitely bruised, which, if I’m going to start dating is really not something I want to have to explain to anyone.”
“I have no need for your apologies. You were given cause, I think, not to trust many of your own shield brothers. I cannot atone for their errors, but I can attempt to ensure that our bond develops differently. Perhaps it is best we forego any power exchanges for the present, but I would still enjoy the opportunity to spend time with you.”
The questions this week were GOLD, team. I had a blast writing these.
This time, Bruce offered a piece of cut up bell pepper accompanied by a buttermilk ranch dip. Tony at least succeeded at not gnawing on the guy like an animal this time, though when a bit of the dip came off the pepper he reflexively swiped it off Bruce’s finger with his tongue. As soon as he did he glanced at Bruce in apology, but the other man just smiled and repeated,
“Agent Coulson did once more ask me to pass on his suggestion that you meet and discuss the matter in person. And it does appear as if that might be the more expedient option, Sir.”
“Sir, you gotta—haa, fuck, fuck, Clint, stop, I’m gonna—”
“Then what?”
It was a gloriously productive morning, knee pain aside, and he worked until his music stopped and JARVIS’s smooth tones declared,
“I think Barnes and the others had something they wanted to show you, Tones.”
“Maybe I was once,” Steve agreed. “But that was also always a bit of an oversimplification. I certainly had a shield, and I told myself everything I did was in defense of the people and the places I loved. That’s still true, but anyone who knew me back then will tell you I’ve also always been an aggressive little shit. I hope I’ve never bullied, or made conflicts when there could have been peace, but I like being right down there in the action. I’m naturally pretty impatient, so I like the immediacy of those kinds of results, seeing big change happen quickly. You, though…you told me that you built Ultron because you wanted a suit of armour around the world. Nearly everything you’ve ever done since Afghanistan has come from a desire to protect. To be honest I think you’re maybe more of a shield than I’ve ever been.”
“Tony? Focus.” The words fell from Steve’s lips as they had maybe hundreds of times before, and as they so often did, the simple direction cut through the babbling web of words Tony was spinning around himself.
“Fuck yes!” Talia’s outburst was clearly unplanned, and when her mind caught up to her mouth she groaned. Masdee laughed. The sound was rich and warm and throaty, like the bold coffees Tony had preferred mixed with smoke and the flavourful foods of the world that Bruce so often cooked for them. It made Steve homesick.
complaint that she’d been blonde for the end of the world.
“Fucking ages but how the hell is that my fault? You people insisted on stopping the sex, remember?” This, at least, got Bruce to drop his hold on Tony’s package, a fact which was somehow disappointing and relieving at once. His dress shoes clicked quickly against the tile floor as he made his way around to the front of the table.
“Not exactly. What happened…well, our Tony died.”
The rest of the week seemed to crawl by for Steve. Seeing just how well SHIELD had run without him left Steve both proud and increasingly unsettled. It was a very real relief to meet his team for dinner when Friday evening finally arrived. Bucky had suggested the restaurant; it was new and trendy and they likely never would have gotten in without using Tony’s real name to make the reservation, but Steve was glad they had.
“Because!” Tony snapped, stunned that he was facing this reaction for a second time, especially from the one person who should have known better. “Because it’s a nightmare! I don’t fit here, or there, I don’t make sense anywhere anymore. And no, I didn’t really want SI to get the chance to out me, but now I’m just going to live forever as someone else, someone who knew who he was and what he needed. And you can’t even
Indeed, the presence of orientation in the D/s sense makes the type of binaristic thought that often shapes mainstream discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity all but impossible. Take something like the assumed (and obviously problematic and just plain unscientific) links between something like dominant behaviours and masculine gender identities in universes like the MCU; they are even more transparently absurd in the D/s verse because Domination crosses all boundaries of sex, gender, sexual orientation, etc. This is not to say that this universe has perfect, progressive gender politics, but the privileging of orientation in their sense of that term, coupled with the comprehensive and mandatory orientation education most individuals receive at age 14 does tend to make for more nuanced understandings of the web of intersections between gender, sexuality, and specific kinky practices which may or may not be tied to either of those factors.
Shortly before the Snap, Pepper had accused Tony of putting the women in his life on pedestals. He had responded by truthfully telling her that it was hardly his fault that pretty much every woman in his life was equal parts impressive and terrifying. Rasa Chimva did not look to be in any way a deviation from that trend. The number of letters after her name rivalled Tony’s own, and combined with Wakanda’s vastly superior medical knowledge and technology, he could barely understand some of her more recent publications. The fact that she was glaring suspiciously at Tony did not help matters either.
This was the biggest risk Tony would take today, and he hoped he was playing it right. He couldn’t, wouldn’t, imply he was willing to directly go up against Steve, and he also had to play it with a hint of reluctance, like he was fighting his instincts by risking his Dominant’s displeasure. (That part came easier than he expected. He remembered how goddamn frantic he’d felt during the scene with Natasha, when he convinced himself she wasn’t letting him come because he’d done something wrong. That feeling, that fear of disappointing her, had been way worse and more powerful than the denial itself.) Richards’ brows shot up towards his receding hairline, and he studied Tony for a couple of seconds with what could only be described as hunger. (Gotcha, old man.) Still, when he spoke, the other man at least attempted the light, jovial tone of a few minutes prior.
“That’s a great idea!” Tony enthused. He strode over to Steve and, without warning or ceremony, stuck a hand into Steve’s front left pocket. He shook the loose change he’d recovered with a rattle while Steve tried to get his heart to restart. “Drama, c’mere girl!”
My own visions are not perfect, especially when I am under the kind of constraints I was on Titan. My initial impression was that Stark would perish during the final battle against Thanos. So initially I was relieved to realize it was otherwise. It is rather difficult to keep the truth of his existence in another universe from those who love and are missing him, and Peter in particular is not making it easy. He and Mr. Keener are secretly (or what they believe to be secretly, anyway) attempting to seek Stark out, correctly believing he is not dead. If they get far I may have to intervene; Stark is correct in assuming that contact between the universes could be catastrophic, resulting in (among other things) both his and Natasha Romanov’s deaths, or even the potential undoing of the team’s success against Thanos.
“Thirteen, Agent Barton.”
It did, actually, sound doable. Not being able to kneel as long as the others could had once been a hugely difficult thing for Tony to try to accept, but Clint especially had been annoyingly insistent in his efforts to re-direct Tony’s focus.
“He asleep?” Pepper asked as Rhodey rounded the corner. He found her sprawled out on his couch, a bottle of beer in one hand and a tablet in the other; she was squinting at the latter in a way that he was quite certain had much more to do with exhaustion than the small amount of booze she’d consumed that night, and he felt no guilt at all for sliding it out of her hands.
“We’re trusting him to you, Stevie. We know you won’t let any of us down.”
“Oh hey Pete. Ready to play with vibranium? Shuri sent a bunch of her own research along with the raw materials, so it’s possible you’ll want to call May. We might be here awhile.”
“I really, really want to. You have no idea how much.” The ‘but’ was audible in every word, and in the suddenly defeated slump of Tony’s shoulder’s. “You could still hurt me so badly, and so easily. You can hurt me like no one else can, and I’m not sure I can take anymore. I’m so tired Steve. I’m tired and I want—I think I want to rest now more than I want anything else. Even you.”
I should note that in recent decades, there have been broader challenges to the ranking system. Those identifying as ‘un-oriented’ (analogous to an asexual mode of identification in other universes) have begun to rally around calls for legalizing a ‘0’ classification. Trans-oriented individuals, or those whose hormonal make-up is strongly unaligned with their psychosocial orientation, are also lobbying for a change to the classification system that privileges self-identification and makes mandatory hormonal testing optional.
It was a nothing moment in the grand scheme of things. But the quiet serenity of seeing Bruce in safe and content to pursue whatever knowledge he wanted in the space Tony had built for him, for both of them, made him slightly less inclined to stop plotting elaborate escapes. (Sort of.)
“I do.”
“I mean yeah, that was the thought. But now that I’m in it, it feels kind of weird to think about having spent all night with you and then turning around and trying to be intimate and vulnerable with someone else. So I was hoping we could…re-negotiate, or whatever it is you healthy grown-up people say around here.” Clint’s frown deepened if anything, and Tony wondered whether using the suit to bore his way through the floor would count as breaking his promise not to be Iron Man in this dimension. “Look, it’s fine if you’re not interested—”
After two more intake meetings he was abruptly called in to an unscheduled disciplinary session; as soon as he saw the name on the agenda, he groaned. Out loud. In the middle of a crowded hallway. He quickly covered it as a cough and no one was any the wiser (he hoped.) But he still dragged his feet as he made his way down to Maria’s office, where Hill, Coulson and the guest of honour were already assembled and waiting.
Some of the tension drained from Thor’s shoulders the moment they were buckled around his wrists—the constant effect bondage had on his partner was predictable and welcome to Steve, who reached out and touched his cheek.
After his encounter with Bucky, Tony expected to be back at baseline and head on his merry way. Instead, he was back to dropping by the time sucked back the last of his green juice. It was horribly frustrating, not to mention embarrassing—he’d thought Dr. Chimva had been kidding about this whole becoming a submissive thing feeling like a second puberty.
“No, everyone.”
“Something the matter, Cap? I figured between Rhodes hanging around more and Tony bein’ back you wouldn’t need much air support, but I can still be there in a couple hours if you need—”
The language of warfare was one Thor had had centuries with which to become intimately familiar. He straightened in his seat, eyes reflexively seeking out Mjolnir the same way Steve’s had found his shield when he’d first heard the news. If Tony was at war, then so were the Avengers. (He’d be damned if they lost him again.)
“Good morning. Want to go take care of check-in downstairs?”
“Uh, -2, 5.”
“I…holographic volleyball?” Which really
—cool takedowns, awesome one-liners, maybe a few bloopers where Hawkeye missed or Captain America dropped his shield or something. And sure, there had been some of that—like in the footage of Thor shooting lightning out of his eyes, or that time when Black Widow, having apparently lost a bet, fought an entire session wearing ballet slippers and beat everyone in one way or another.
“I’ve noticed, Snack Ghost.” That, at least, dragged a grin out of Bruce.
Steve battered heavy bags in the gym until his knuckles bled. With how heavily Tony had reinforced them, this took much more doing than it used to, and he wondered with a clinical kind of disinterest if he’d managed to break one or more of the bones. JARVIS announced Rhodes’ and the team’s arrival just as he was wrapping them up, though his lingering discomfort was probably evident based on the exasperated glare Coulson shot his way. (Bruce, Steve noted, was absent, and he was probably lucky for that.) He didn’t wait for Rhodey to speak, wasn’t in the mood for pleasantries even with a man whose company he genuinely enjoyed.
Content Notes: A few things to know about this chapter in case any of them are triggering. During his discussion with Bruce, Tony has a moment where he maps some of his own world's gender and sexual stereotypes onto the D/s verse, specifically ideas about women/submissives (he sort of collapses the two in his rushed and incorrect analogy) being overemotional and men/Dominants being sex-crazed and unable to control themselves. He is promptly corrected, because those stereotypes are not in fact present in this version of a D/s verse, but the conversation still circles around some fairly heavy topics related to rape culture and sexual/orientational violence.
“Oh fuck,
“Oh hell no. She’s like the sweetest little dictator you’ve ever met. I’m pretty sure she would figure out a way to take me offline before I could manage anything close to an actual coup.”
“I like it better this way.” Bucky frowned. “No, it’s not—I don’t just mean because I’m pissed at the guy, although he does seem to have ended up going down a substantially worse road than…you know. But Howard was always so much about appearances; it didn’t matter how ugly something was in reality as long as it looked good from the outside. I’m weirdly glad to finally have somewhere to go to remember him that reflects how complicated and weird and shitty and brilliant he was. And it’s okay if today means more than one thing to you, too. I’m sorry they died the way they did, and I’m sorry you were and are traumatized by the act of being forced to kill them. But you also have my permission now and forever to not be all that sorry that they’re gone. Especially him.”
Geoffrey C. Bowker and Susan Leigh Star.
“You have nothing to apologize for. We’re the ones who assumed instead of asking you what you needed. However, I don’t think any of us plan on making that mistake with you again, Tony. So take in all the information you can during these sessions, learn to play the game the way you’ll unfortunately need to. But you’ll need to start thinking, too, about what it is you
“Bruce, you are certain he’s alright? It feels different to be leaving him on his own in a house that’s comparatively so much smaller than the Tower.” Natasha didn’t look away from her current project, which involved sorting toys and other implements using a system known only to her, but she was repeating a question she’d already asked once, and Nat was typically nothing if not efficient. Bruce followed her lead, though, and finished hanging the print in his hand as he answered.
“Yes,” Tony blurted, no hint of his earlier hesitation. He looked across the room at Rhodes, unconditional gratitude and affection painting the lines of his face so clearly that for a moment it felt just as private and intimate a thing to witness as it would have to find the two of them exchanging passionate kisses or caresses. Steve averted his eyes, waiting until Rhodes cleared his throat, clearly trying to gather himself.
“Yeah yeah fine.”
And hey, it wasn’t that Steve didn’t recognize the impulse. He’d been way worse off than this and for much longer after the other Tony had die. But these had been the same people who had peeled him off the floor or out of Tony’s room, reminded him that he had a life to lead, people who still loved him. It was about time, he thought, that he returned the favour.
“Well I suppose that’s reassuring. What I was actually referring to, though, was your tendency to idealize the people and places of your past as a response to traumatic loss.”
They were still always careful about the D/s stuff, too, constantly checking in with Tony and asking his permission for almost any kind of orientation-based interaction, everything from hand feeding to the use of soft tools like blindfolds. It was kind, and Tony certainly wasn’t ready to be present for any of the more sexual elements, but as the D/s stuff was turning out to feel like it was the least bewildering part of this whole universe, their caution was also overkill at this point. He didn’t quite know how to say that to Coulson just yet, though, so he gave his permission and soon the spy trio emerged from the elevator.
.” He didn’t know he was going to speak until he’d whispered the words into the chasm that felt like it separated him from Phil, from everyone who was normal and decent and didn’t get angry at their partners for asking them to
that tone. Its purpose was to diffuse and deflect.) “A good few days does not mean you are healed, Steve.”
The seemingly random attacks that had been keeping the Avengers so busy all week were not, it transpired, random at all. One of the prisoners SHIELD had taken in after the latest call-out had happily volunteered that his organization, along with numerous others, had been paid handsomely to keep the team as active and busy as possible. There were bonuses, the guy had told Nat, for attacks that ensured Tony’s involvement, and for capturing his tech, or any intel at all related to Tony.
Rhodey dropped a scoop of butter into the pan and handed it off to Tony. “Put that on the burner over there, and turn the heat to medium, please.” Tony did as he was told with a grumble, his frustration heightened by the feeling of multiple pairs of eyes following the scene.  “I’m not necessarily an expert in starvation specifically, but I’ve helped enough of my guys through this kind of stuff after missions gone wrong that I do know it often comes down to feeling like you’re not in control of your relationship with food anymore. There’s lots of ways to try to change that, and we can do some experimenting to see what fits. Right now, the thing we’re going to try is getting you involved in the prep a little bit more, so that your body and your head start to understand that not only is there food here, but you don’t have to rely on other people to turn it into something edible. Now spread that butter around the pan, good, and chuck some of these in there.”
Bruce was right, there was still a part of Tony that didn’t want any more information about his orientation than he already had. The last round of testing he’d done in this area had ended in such a complete disaster that he was still paying the price for it, and what if Bruce’s tests yielded bad news?
“I’m…not convinced that’s true. Is there someone I could call, at least? Your aunt, perhaps? Captain Rogers?”
“Whatever Captain Sasspants.”
“Yeah whatever. Let’s just get some pizza or something. There has to be somewhere that will deliver out here, right?”
We join the team a few weeks after the events of last chapter as they look toward the end of their vacation. Tony and Bucky enjoy the afterglow of a long-awaited scene, and the team welcomes a visitor.
“Definitely not,” Bruce told him, calm and decisive. “Steve didn’t want orientation mixed up in our conversation about whether you wanted to stay in this universe because especially now that there are biochemical elements of submission at play, he wanted to avoid exerting any influence over a decision that needed to be yours alone. And I wasn’t trying to stress you out about the check-in either; I just wanted to have some of these conversations first. You’re still our sub, Tony, as long as you want to be. That’s a basic right on your side, and an honour on ours. Got it?”
“Oh. Right. Well I mean how that I now how delightful these two a.m. chats are—”
Tony should really have gotten up at that point. They were on a tight deadline, after all, what with him needing to learn an entirely new universe well enough to be able to convincingly impersonate one of its most beloved members. And it wasn’t as if lying here would bring him any closer to Peter, or any of the others he’d lost. This had never been Tony, to just allow himself to stop and succumb to his own demons this way. After Afghanistan, after the Mandarin and Ultron and the Civil War, even after the Snap, he’d found solace in never staying put long enough to truly feel the full weight of anything. So why wasn’t he moving?
“So you’re not going to rat me out then, Platypus?” Tony teased, hoping he had managed to keep the thread of anxiety from seeping too much into his tone. Dr. Chimva appeared to be ignoring the entire exchange as she started unpacking gear from her bag and muttering about the lack of sterility of the room. (It was true that they’d be better off doing this in the med-wing that Bruce had built, but Tony would never make it through the next morning’s check-in with a straight face if he was hiding something like this from Bruce in his Dominant’s own domain.) Rhodey rolled his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
He thought back to those dark, horrid days after Tony had died. At first, managing to do things like breathing and eating were about all he could handle. He hadn’t needed to imagine or wish for death because he’d felt lifeless and broken already. As days turned into weeks and months, though, it had been tempting to find the most dangerous mission he could. But…
“The ring goes around your cock, making it harder or impossible to reach orgasm depending on the person. It’ll lie on top of this,” she gestured to the fake penis, “which I can make vibrate if I wish, or use to fuck myself . And these,” she pointed to the ears, “are designed to vibrate and rub up against my clit.” Tony remembered with a thrill of fear and excitement that one of the only things Natasha had ranked at the high end of the spectrum were related to controlling, even denying, her partners the ability to orgasm. “One way or another, I’d like to make you desperate tonight. I want to try to bring you out of your head and keep you there for as long as I can. But I’d like you to tell me how you wish for me to take you there. This can include any one of these toys, or none of them if you suspect there will be a more effective method.”
“He can’t handle praise or compliments if he’s not already deep in headspace. He deflects, usually, or finds a reason to leave the room. The more sincere it is, the more uncomfortable he gets. I’ve been trying to work on it, but it seems even worse with me than with the rest of you.”
“So, you seem to have a bee in your bonnet about this whole Stark thing, and while I sort of get where the other two are coming from, I’m not really sure what’s up with you.”
So I reflected a lot this week on how and why I am still so energized and excited about this fic after all this time and all the words already spilled. And a lot of it comes back to you fine folks! This story has had an incredible, active, generous readership basically right from the start, and I'm so grateful that you're still here with me.
Bruce muttered something, something that sounds suspiciously like ‘It isn’t you I’m angry at.’ But Tony made certain he was far enough away to pretend not to have heard a word.
“Fuck yeah!” Impulsively, Tony leaned up to press a kiss to the tip of Bucky’s nose, just to see his eyes cross slightly as he laughed.
“Sorry. I, yeah it’s good to feel useful, I guess.”
Tony wanted to be comforted by the sight of the bag being used by that way, as yet another indication of how committed the Bruce in this universe was to staying rather than leaving.
It wasn’t until a tight, crisp set of knocks landed on the heavy wooden door to his rooms that he even glanced at the clock on the nearest wall. What he saw produced a sharp inhalation that didn’t manage to satisfy Steve’s suddenly burning lungs at all; it was nearly noon. (Not now, it couldn’t be starting already.) Steve bid the man carrying a heavily-laden lunch tray entrance in a voice that barely sounded like his own. From the thick leather gambeson he wore, ornately designed to illustrate numerous military victories, delivering Steve’s meal was rather below his pay grade. But the soldier appeared to have no problem with it, arranging Steve’s plate and cutlery with as much care and attention to detail as if the task were far more significant. Only when the food was laid out on Steve’s table to his satisfaction did the man turn to address Steve directly.
Peter encounters his first really formidable fight in a while; Tony handles it about as well as you'd expect.
more than they wanted his stuff. Steve had helped get him there once, with persistence and gentle reassurances and, eventually, the comfort of submission. But this wasn’t his Tony, and therefore it was neither Steve’s right nor his responsibility to step in. So he tore into the takeout and curled up between Bucky and Natasha with every intention of enjoying the movie and the familiar presence of his family.
Neither Natasha nor Bruce responded to this (admittedly kind of obvious) description, though Bruce did resume the stroking of Tony’s hair. Once he’d worked his way past the shock of the first few blows, Tony managed to spare some awareness for the way the hits were falling. Witnessing the aftermath of Clint’s handiwork several times suggested that the archer treated this almost like painting or some other visual art, creating intricate, exact patterns that were designed to be displayed. Natasha’s art form felt, fittingly, more like a dance, something just as delicate but entirely ephemeral, designed to live only in the moment it was experienced. There was a hypnotic kind of rhythm to the blows, and before long Tony was listening to the dense strike of the paddle colliding with skin just as much as he was feeling the effects.
“That’s harsh,” Peter commented, before it occurred to him that perhaps a SHIELD employee important enough to just walk up to the Director and start rambling would not be interested in the opinion of a random kid.
“Please accept my submission, Sir,” he added. It was simple, nothing poetic or complex, but Tony was surprised by how much he meant it, how deeply he needed confirmation that it was time to put himself in the team’s hands. The hand Bruce put on his cheek was so tender that Tony could barely stand the touch.
“Aunt May, I didn’t mean any of what I said—”
“I should have written it out on a post-it or something, because this is the third time you’ve asked so far. But you’re with it enough to string a full sentence together this time, so yes. I’m a lying liar who lies, because I wanted to be here to surprise you.” Tony sat up, slightly alarmed by the idea that he’d apparently been so far out of it for that long, but winced as soon as his eyes were fully open. The combined light of the TV and the flood lighting in the penthouse living room felt hotter and brighter than being under actual interrogation lights. He hid his face against Rhodey’s chest. “What’s—ah. JARVIS, dim lights by 70 percent. Shh, Tones, it’s normal, it’s fine. Just some sensory sensitivity brought on by going down as hard as you were earlier. Actually, Steve, maybe get me a blindfold. I was going to hand feed him lunch anyway, no reason he needs to have his eyes open while he starts coming back up.”
