For now, Steve needed food and a shower, and probably in that order. He lurched to his feet and followed the sounds coming from the kitchen, where someone else had clearly had the same idea. Steve was a little surprised to find Tony there, out of the armor and already showered and in a fresh t-shirt and jeans. Tony looked up from his place at the stove when Steve walked in, and offered an easy, tired smile.
Tony groaned as the memory surfaced, and he raised his head from the pillow before forcing himself to sit up. He had given JARVIS very specific protocols for shutting off the alarm, and the relentless noise did not cease until Tony was standing up and had made it several steps toward the bathroom.
Tony paced back and forth across his workshop, tapping a wrench against his palm. “I could tell him I don’t want to get involved in vigilantism.”
Natasha raised an eyebrow, looking neither surprised nor particularly pleased. Steve was a little surprised, himself; Natasha had never struck him as an especially judgmental type, but then, he understood about as much about Natasha as he did other women, which was to say, not a lot.
Tony seemed asleep already, with an arm draped frankly a bit dramatically over his eyes, but he broke Steve's concentration by mumbling, "This is why we don't have sex in your room."
Mr. Jarvis, coming through to announce the opening of the bay doors, jolted Steve out of his wandering thoughts.
Steve rolls away, flushing with embarrassment. Suddenly, the moment feels too intimate, and he feels exposed by his own feelings. "No, I just ... I didn't
Steve bites back a groan at the idea of trouble following him. He presses his ear against the bedroom door to listen, and distinguishes voices in the living room, with cadence very similar to those he heard in Sternberg's lab.
He should probably remove the Iron Man's arm from around Steve's waist, but Tony uses the excuse that the hatch is still open, and Jim hasn't come back up yet with Steve's partner, Bucky.
Steve takes a step back to put a respectable distance between them, and turns shyly away from Tony in order to greet his friend.
All the rifle-wielding soldiers begin to fire, and Tony presses forward, trying to get out of the covered causeway before he finds himself stuck there. He fires off his own guns and watches three of the group drop, but the one with the bazooka is gearing up to fire.
She came back in time for them to endure a somewhat awkward round of Secret Santa, where the kids exchanged gifts and Tony happened to have some random presents on hand to dole out to the adults, too. It seemed like a pretty mixed bag, without real intent for usefulness to the particular person who received each thing; Steve ended up with what seemed like a very nice set of beakers (not that he had much of a frame of reference), while Natasha got a desk ornament that proclaimed itself a 'Newton's cradle' on the box.
"Besides." Natasha smiled. "It's Christmas Eve, and I'm going to cook dinner, and then we're all going to eat dinner and be happy."
"Here, you should have this before it gets cold," Steve said, pressing Tony's neglected coffee mug from earlier into his hands. It had already cooled considerably, but was still warm enough to drink.
Steve set down his shield and crossed over to the couch, careful not to disturb any of the papers as he sat down next to Tony. “Tony, what’s going on?”
Steve wants to look to Agent Drew for some signal or cue, but he knows better than to give up her cover. He can do this alone, if he needs to; he allowed himself to be captured by the Red Skull, back in the war; he can sure as hell fight his way past some two-bit Hydra leftovers.
When Steve broke away from the kiss, Tony was left gasping for breath, though he tried to act at least somewhat unaffected.
He doesn't want to rush this, or rush Steve. Even though their relationship has slowly progressed from kissing to
very well at a certain bashfulness, though, all lowered lashes and coy glances back up at Tony while he stroked his cock.
Cedar Falls was quaint, more town than city, especially in comparison to New York. It was the sort of place where Steve might have imagined settling down when that kind of thing was still on the table for him (and if he ever could have brought himself to leave Brooklyn, which admittedly wasn't likely).
It took years for Zemo to finally take hold of Howard, though; enough time for him to come home from the war, to settle in and conceive of a civilian life. Everyone thought, when he had trouble sleeping, when he had the paranoid attacks, that it was simply shellshock.
By the time Steve realized he'd spent longer than was strictly polite in staring, Tony was looking at him with an especially sly grin.
"Well," Steve says. "I was just thinking. Wondering. When you said 'don't be sorry,' was it just because you were being nice, or -"
For most of the world, Tony Stark in a suit was nothing new; one could simply run the man's name through Google and the first few hundred results - well, with SafeSearch on at least - would be a mixed batch of the Iron Man armor and Tony looking like he had just walked out of some board room or charity gala.
“Starving,” Steve admitted. He tugged off his gloves and tucked them into his belt. “You need any help?”
Tony snorts, allowing Steve his delusion. "Okay, soldier. Wanna lend me a hand? Assuming you can get it off my ass long enough."
Steve plummeted from the tower with no time to think about the landing that awaited him, then a pair of strong, red-and-gold-armored, hands caught him.
good, Jessica," the woman - who can only be Madame Hydra - practically purrs. "Captain America, brought to his knees at last."
Their hips fit together neatly that way, and Tony wrapped his hand around them both while Steve rocked into the friction of the touch. Steve felt a little self-conscious of the knowledge that he wasn't going to last very long like this, but even in their short time together, they'd danced around this attraction enough to set them both on edge.
"Come on," Tony said. "My old man went out looking for you on a semi-regular basis. He was obsessed. Of
“I didn’t mean to scare you,” Tony said. He paused, then added, a hint of reluctance in his voice, “But I was prepared for that to be the case.”
The faceplate of the armor lowered and Tony braced himself in the posture that was now familiar to Steve as an indication that Tony intended to take off. Steve stepped closer and placed an urgent hand on Tony’s shoulder.
The words hung in the air for a split second, long enough for them both to stop short and consider their implications. Steve ducked his head, self-conscious, and Tony looked down and away, rubbing at the back of his neck.
No one else could be Iron Man, because Iron Man was sitting right there. Tony shifted uncomfortably, then sprung to his feet. “You know what,” he said quickly, before Steve could ask any more questions, “I think I need a shower after all that fun. Care to join me?”
Suddenly, the music turned down and a large television mounted on the wall near the front of the room switched on, airing a repeat of the Times Square broadcast from an hour ago on the east coast. Steve joined in with everyone else on the countdown from ten, and shortly after the shouts of "HAPPY NEW YEAR!" went up around the room, Steve found himself being yanked down by his collar, into a kiss.
For one night in Madripoor, it's like Tony Stark has stepped back in time. The illegal weapons expo, held in Hightown's largest and most grandiose conference center, is packed with so many faces from international most wanted lists that Tony could earn himself a favor from nearly every country in the U.N., if not for Madripoor's non-extradition laws. Tony raises more than a few eyebrows with his mere presence at the event, even as he goes about rubbing elbows with arms dealers like he still belongs among them. It will probably be his last time in such circles, at any rate; smuggling Captain America into the party is a great way to ensure that Tony never gets invited back.
"What? We can have a memento for later." Tony grinned back at Steve, grabbing a screwdriver (what? he always had one) from his pocket as he headed that way. "Now give me a boost."
The shaking stopped, but the person lingered. Steve blinked, and the blur reconstituted itself into a shock of short-cropped dark hair, a full mouth, and very bright blue eyes. He blinked again, and his brain processed that the face was that of a woman, and not one Steve recognized.
"Come on, Steve," Tony complained. He had no idea what Steve was doing to him, in that Tony felt like a horny teenager all over again; they'd just fucked this morning before he left for the office, and Steve had already shown up by mid-afternoon to do it all over again.
to respond, but he's relieved when Jim lets him up and even helps him down the corridor to his quarters. At the door, Jim drags Tony into a brief hug before walking off.
"Easy," Tony says, while Steve moves to the opposite side of the table and places his hands on the other Tony's shoulders.
"It's all ... this," Steve said. He raised a hand and gestured around the room, before winding an arm around Tony's shoulders. "I don't like undercover work, but this part has been nice. Having a place, pretending to be normal."
Impulsively, Steve kissed Tony again, then went to let himself out of Tony's bedroom. The hallway outside was empty, the rest of the team undoubtedly engaging in their own post-mission rituals ... though, Steve thought with a private smile, they probably didn't involve getting up close and personal with another teammate.
have fun - and explaining that he was borrowing the garage door opener, but Tony knew how to find him to get it back later.
Steve is beginning to believe that smart alec scientists are to be the bane of his existence. "You didn't tell anyone where you were going, sir. There are people who are worried about you."
It seemed obvious now, however, that this Anthony Edward Stark was Howard's son. It was all there in the handsome face, with its laughing eyes.
"Dental records and DNA tests may not be enough, given we'd have to explain how we obtained those things, but he's certainly the type who would almost ... appreciate being caught in a lie. Have respect for his adversary, maybe," Coulson concluded.
Tony cringes away from the light like it burns. He looks bleary and hungover, with dark circles under his eyes and his hair tousled. "Inhumane," he declares.
"I'm not sure how much more I have to tell," Steve says honestly. Eventually, Pepper will have to start making things up, or the stories in
"Not tonight," Tony says. "Reed got some information from - Anthony - and I'm sure he'll be working on it."
“I didn’t say that.” Steve settled in at Tony’s side again, his head on Tony’s shoulder. “People aren’t always well-intentioned, Tony. I don’t want to see anyone take advantage of your generosity.”
Namor walks off, and Steve looks down into the water, trying not to feel as disappointed as he does. Tony always did rely a little too heavily on alcohol to numb his pain, to forget the stresses of the war and his own bad heart. Steve had tried to do what he could to help, but it never seemed like enough, which had been especially hard on Steve after growing up with an alcoholic father.
's fishing trawler cover boat. Namor is bundled in a wool coat, the collar pulled up to conceal his identity, and he has a knitted cap pulled down low over the tips of his ears.
Steve fumbled with the phone as he typed in his number, feeling like his hands were too big and too clunky for the sleek screen; at least he had the cold as an excuse for numbing the pads of his fingers. Steve was relieved again for his good memory bringing the brand new cell phone number - with an area code and prefix for the city of his supposed former college - immediately to mind, and he handed the phone back to Tony as soon as he was done typing in the number.
"I'm glad we had this ... talk," Steve said, offering Tony a small kiss. The way he was continuing to get handsy didn't exactly suggest he was back on his best behavior, however.
Tony doesn't remember much about his father now, not much about what Howard was really like, before all that happened, but he thinks Howard used to be happy. Tony has memories of his father smiling, laughing; there was none of that, after the war.
They shook hands with a sense of urgency, so that Tony could put his back on the leaning stack of cupcake boxes in relatively short order.
Steve dives to the side as she squeezes off her shot, and it takes out the dresser mirror instead. Steve rushes behind the bed to use it for cover, popping over the edge of the mattress to fire off a few shots of his own.
"Why wouldn't I be?" Steve wonders happily. "I'm here with you, there's no immediate crisis to worry about ..."
that. It was refreshing, with the sexual history that Tony had – the reputation that Tony had – to have a partner who didn’t seem to have expectations of Tony to keep things fresh, who wanted to contribute his own part to their intimacy.
"I promise, you could have woken me up, I wouldn't have minded," Tony said. "Anyway, whatever, moot point now. Are you in or not?"
"All of that did remind me how good you are in a fight," Steve says cautiously. "You know, I missed having Iron Man at my back."
," Tony said, exasperated in his own way now. "There's no way I was going to let him make Cap jam out of you."
Steve would grab Tony down corridors after press conferences, press him up the wall and get a hand down his trousers sometimes and jerk him off right there, rutting against Tony's hip until they were both messy and Tony's - mercifully dark, usually, on those occasions - suit would be a complete ruin.
He throws himself forward as he hears the bullet singing toward them, and tackles Sternberg to the floor. A split second later, the round embeds itself in the wall, just where Sternberg's head would have been. The scientist's gun falls from his hand in the scuffle, sliding across the floor and out of reach.
It gave Steve a great moment of reflection, as he wondered briefly - very briefly - just what he was doing there. With Tony. What the two of them were doing together. Well, thinking about
After a room service breakfast, Tony goes back to bed, while Steve remains awake and begins to prepare for his day. The sun is out and he's already wasted more hours than he should have, though he can't say that he regrets the decision.
Dr. Banner administers the cure, which they take to calling the Infinity Formula thanks to the markings on the label, and then there is nothing left to do but wait.
But Tony’s walls, those last barriers around what was left of his personal life that he kept carefully protected from Steve, had already gone up again. “It’s okay,” he said, his attention hyper-focused on cutting the sandwiches on the diagonal, before he shifted them from the griddle to waiting plates. “You wanna grab us some bowls?”
Steve lowers himself to the ground and risks a glance inside. The men aren't looking his way, busy searching the lab, rummaging through papers, and the few remaining beakers and vials.
Tony's house, Steve realized upon reaching it, was rather large, a sprawling two stories with the back extending out in a long private dock toward the lake. It seemed like an awful lot of house for one person.
"It's the counterpart to St. Nicholas," Steve said. "Instead of Santa deciding who's naughty and who's nice, St. Nicholas delivers gifts to the nice children and the Krampus punishes naughty ones."
What Steve called aspirin looked, on closer inspection, more like the best over the counter stuff you could get for a headache. He'd probably gotten them from Clint or Sam, since Captain America didn't really do headaches. Tony didn't ask, he just pushed himself up from the pillows and dutifully swallowed both pills, washing them down with half the glass of water, under Steve's supervision.
Steve smiled, pleased beyond words that Tony was willing to open himself up to such vulnerability. “I love you, too, Tony.”
"I should have known you'd follow me here," Tony says, once Steve is inside, and he's closed and locked the door.
Tony started a little, like he had been dozing, but turned to give the console his attention as the screen flared to life. Steve watched as a smile spread over his face.
And so the armor is, tall and hulking, imposing to anyone with anything to fear from it. Steve walks up to the armor, where it hangs suspended in its chains for maintenance, and reaches a hand up to the breastplate - but he stops, glancing back at Tony.
Tony takes the lock in hand and turns it over, leaning close to inspect the mechanism. “Namor’s here?”
Steve scrubbed his hand over his face, then turned his hand over to scowl at the IV line running into it. "When can I get out of here?"
An awkward silence hung between them for a few seconds, awkward mostly because Tony didn’t actually feel compelled to break it. Not until he remembered that this guy was in fact a complete stranger, and a possible future foe, if they crossed paths again at a moment when Tony couldn’t pass himself off as an innocent bystander.
Steve sighed softly, but conceded the point and stepped into the elevator along with Clint. He had to remember there were other members of the team besides just himself and Tony, and if Clint was right - that everyone was feeling betrayed and upset right now - Steve should really step in and set a good example for all of them.
Tony closes his eyes and rubs his hands over Steve's back, murmuring whatever quiet words he can in an effort to soothe his lover. "I'm so sorry, Steve. I'm so sorry."
Tony laughs softly, appreciating the effort, even if he still feels unusually sorry to see his alternate go. They wait until they're all on the other side of the portal, where Reed can't watch, to exchange quick farewell kisses (Tony's is definitely dirty, though; he can't resist slipping in a bit of tongue). They get the stasis pods situated, then assemble to say their goodbyes when the alarms in his parallel workshop begin to sound. The other Avengers will be on their way, and Steve and Tony shouldn't linger any longer.
Steve's blush must spread from his hairline to his collar, but he keeps it civil as he shakes Stark's hand. "Steve Rogers, sir. And I'm sorry, I just - well, I just thought you looked younger than your magazine covers."
Steve debated for a moment whether Tony would prefer well-informed or ignorant; he decided to go with the former. Tony seemed like the sort of guy who would be suspicious of someone purporting to know too
Tony raised his eyebrows. “Says the vigilante who uses his super strength to anonymously save old ladies from purse snatchers.”
Steve pushes up onto an elbow and looks between Tony and the heart bubble, before he sets a hand delicately over the glass. His large palm is nearly enough to cover it, to shield it, entirely. "He worked on the armor?"
Steve glanced around him, and had to concede the point that, for all the strangeness of a twenty-first century Christmas party spent with people he hardly knew, he had been enjoying himself. "Yeah."
Steve reaches up and tugs the hood off. He sags with relief when he sees the wry twist of a smile on Tony's lips.
“That’s incredibly brave,” Steve said. “You’re - really brilliant. I just don’t understand why you don’t ...” He made a helpless gesture. “Use your power for good?”
Tony blinked. “Well, I didn’t think you just woke up at … 3 am, with a burning need to wash your linens, Steven.” He waved at the door. “I can go.”
"I know," Steve said softly. Even if Tony hadn't already mentioned it earlier, that information had also been part of what Agent Coulson imparted when Steve first woke up in the twenty-first century, that Howard Stark's search was continued by SHIELD after his retirement.
The next day was Christmas Eve, and Steve woke up and went on his usual morning run, noting all the Christmas decorations lining the street along the way. The house that he and Natasha were sharing looked plain and a bit sad in comparison. Steve figured it was understandable, considering they had only just moved in - and were not, actually, permanent residents - but he decided that they needed at least a tree.
Tony closes the door and locks it - with two deadbolts and a chain, Steve notes - before asking, "And what, exactly, is my style?"
Anthony stares back at them, confusion in his expression as he looks first at Steve, then past him at Tony. "You mean ..."
"Gloating," Tony says, stopping himself at the last moment before he can reach up and touch the side of his neck. "That's all."
Trips to the moon were becoming just another day for the Avengers, and after the team had a moment to rest, clustered around the kitchen table, one by one they began to stagger off for their own post-mission rituals. Tony stowed the armor in his workshop and helped himself to a nice and long shower, letting the hot water soothe the aches and pains of the day. It was late by the time he finished, so he didn’t bother getting dressed in anything fancier than a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt, before setting off downstairs to find Steve.
doing good, Steve,” he said. “After I nearly got blown up by one of my own company’s bombs, I knew my tech was being traded without my knowledge. I shut down weapons production and turned our defense contracts into actual defensive equipment, but - well, that didn’t do anything about the guys who were using my proprietary tech and selling to the highest bidder.”
The bedroom is as large as the entirety of the shabby Lowtown apartment. A four-poster bed with a mosquito netting-draped canopy dominates the center of the room. Tony leads the way to the bed and stops at the side.
“I suppose there are some perks to being a grownup.” Tony laughed, eagerly propping pillows at the head of the bed.
Steve nodded, stepping up closer to rest a hand warmly on the small of Tony’s back. “I believe in this, Tony. I believe in you. This is going to work, and we’re going to get our lives back.”
Steve hurriedly tugs on his socks and shoes, and gets to his feet, tucking in his shirt. "Is Tony in immediate danger?" he asks.
Steve looked down at Tony’s hands, then up at Tony’s face; he dragged his lower lip between his teeth, considering the temptation on offer here. As if sensing that Steve was close to caving in, Tony went in for the kill and eased one leg up, pressing his thigh right against Steve’s groin. Traitor that it was to all of Steve’s sense of propriety and decorum, his cock almost immediately stirred at the suggestion.
Tony leaned against Jarvis and cried silently, and then only for a little while, unwilling to allow himself the weakness for very long. He still sniffled when he straightened, and gave a watery laugh when Jarvis produced a linen handkerchief for him to use.
"Mm, morning," Steve says. He glances over his shoulder and smiles when he sees Anthony, and he makes a point of tugging him down for a kiss, too.
The next morning, Tony wakes up to find Steve and Anthony in the small kitchen on their floor, Steve making pancakes for breakfast. Tony makes a bee-line for the coffee pot, joining Anthony at the breakfast bar just as Steve begins to set out the plates. Anthony looks better today, less morose and verging on cheerful in Steve's company, freshly showered and dressed once again in a set of clothes Tony recognizes as his own. Yesterday's downer attitude may well have been the result of post-stasis sickness, and undoubtedly a night of real sleep has done wonders for Anthony.
Steve got a glass from the cabinet and tried to keep the judgment from his tone as he said, “It’s been a long few days.”
“No,” Steve said. “The Captain and Mr. Stark, Captain America and Iron Man ... Steve and Tony ... I think no matter the reality, you’re just stuck with me.”
Steve walks into the cabin, and is drawn to the papers strewn across Tony's table. "Oh. Are you busy working?" he asks.
Just as Steve exited the shop, another man was leaving the one next door; a glance at the sign identified it as a cupcakery, which Steve assumed - without making much of a leap - was a bakery that specialized in cupcakes. A little eccentric, in his opinion, but there was a shop in Manhattan that sold macarons so popular that people would wait hours in line just to get a box of the expensive treats, so maybe he wasn't much of a judge.
Steve had no idea what Iron Man looked like outside of the armor. They spoke often enough, but Iron Man’s voice was always modulated through the radio inside the suit. Steve might have passed him on base and never known it.
Steve returned a few moments later and slid beneath the covers with Tony. He put his arms around Tony's waist and drew him in, until they lay close, spooning up together.
Tony seemed satisfied not to question further; maybe because he didn't want to speak extensively about
Steve takes up residence in the kitchen, sitting in a chair that's too small at a table that's too low. Someone makes coffee and gives him a cup; he folds the mug between his hands and resolutely doesn't drink it. He knows he might be in shock, but he doesn't think so. His body is too resilient for that, though they never have tested the limits of its ability to handle emotional trauma.
"Here," Tony said, juggling the boxes awkwardly again as he fished his phone out of his pocket. He extended it to Steve. "Put in your number, I'll text you my address."
“Well,” Steve said, “I only made it that far because Peggy Carter enlisted your father to fly us into enemy territory so I could make the drop. It looked like a suicide mission at the time, but Howard never flinched.”
- a submarine designed and built in many incarnations by Tony Stark - takes up most of the space below; the fishing boat has likely never seen a day of service hauling a load of seafood.
"Down here." Sternberg scrambles down the staircase he had attempted to descend moments ago, fumbling to unlock the door at the bottom.
"What is it?" Steve asks desperately, trying to slow Sternberg's fall as the man slides to the floor.
Steve smiled faintly. “I crashed a plane into the Arctic. It was loaded down with a bomb headed to New York. I thought it would be a suicide mission ... then, against all odds, some seventy years later, Namor -” He pointed to the Atlantean in the photo, “- found me, preserved in ice. Said he was just going to bring me back for a burial, but I ... thawed out.”
Steve walked back over from looking out the front windows, settled into the squashy recliner that didn't remotely match the couch, and proceeded to inhale his donut.
Unfortunately, his search doesn't turn up much, just clothes and a few coins rolling around a dresser drawer. It's clear that Tony doesn't actually live here, and fairly obvious that he isn't planning on coming back anytime soon.
Tony gasped when Steve's slick fingers brushed along his cleft, and he brought one of his knees up higher, spreading himself wider when Steve asked whether it was okay. Steve took his time in circling Tony's hole before he began to press a single digit inside of him. Tony responded sweetly, moaning and relaxing instead of tensing against the intrusion, and he took a second finger without any difficulty aside from his own impatience.
Steve, determined to take things more slowly this time, reaches for the belt on Tony's robe and tugs it loose. The robe falls open, baring the fact that Tony is naked beneath it.
Tony stopped, head thudding lightly back against the glass of the shower wall. He looked up at Steve, uncertainty in his expression. "Cap?"
He knew what Coulson's plan came around to: make the evidence so irrefutable that Tony could no longer deny his identity. But then what? Tony obviously wasn't just playing around here, a billionaire on holiday, the way that SHIELD presented him. This was a man with a life, a job he obviously enjoyed, friends, and a place in the community.
Natasha didn't judge when Steve asked about Tony's current whereabouts, and she drove him to the middle school without question. It was still early in the morning and the parking lot stood nearly empty, except for Tony's car in one of the faculty spots. Natasha parked, and silently handed Steve a key. He let himself into the school, where he finally found Tony in his science classroom.
Steve wound his arm around Tony's waist again to help support him, as Tony started to sag against the shower wall, boneless with his release. They kissed under the spray of water in a sloppy, lazy way as they came down from the high of orgasm, and Steve took charge of washing away the mess they made of themselves.
Agent Drew lingers behind to keep Madame Hydra secured, even though she seems down for the count, leaving Steve and Tony alone.
Steve lunged from the bay doors into a controlled dive, while Iron Man’s boot jets launched him with effort into the fray. His onboard guns were already prepped and ready to return fire to the troops on the ground.
, so Tony kept right on going, until Steve was thrusting back into his hand, making desperate and needy little sounds into the quick kisses they kept exchanging.
There were a few ways, Tony supposed, that he could go about this. He could kidnap Steve, take him to his evil lair, and reveal himself to be Iron Man. He could send a text along the lines of, “lol btw im iron man” but he didn’t actually know Steve’s number, so that was off the table. There was something problematic, anyway, about a guy wanting to save you like you were a princess in a castle, when you didn’t even know his damn last name or his phone number or whether
"You're a teacher?" Steve asked, letting a little eagerness seep into his tone in spite of the dishonesty he felt. Spy work was definitely not for him; he hated the part of it where he had to lie.
The Captain pulled back and, to Tony’s relief, he looked just as dazed as Tony felt, and was breathing just as hard. “I -” He hesitated, took a step back and glanced around.
Tony brooded over his options during the flight home, and promptly had every thought fly from his mind as soon as he saw the wreck of the penthouse at the hands of Thor and the Hulk. The destruction provided a good distraction, at least; Tony was able to slink off while the others weren't looking, and rather than heading down to his workshop this time, he just shed the armor and retreated into his bedroom.
Steve looks up at Tony again, swallowing hard. "I'm not," he says. "I just - I'm sorry I can't do anything to help."
Steve felt himself flush, not with embarrassment but with annoyance. "I'm not that much of a heel, that I don't get -"
It wasn't the neatest or most well-timed kiss Steve had ever experienced, but Tony certainly got points for enthusiasm, going so far as to slip in a bit of tongue while Steve was hesitating in surprise. Steve closed his eyes and kissed back, while it lasted, until finally Tony released him and stepped back, still smiling broadly.
Steve makes coffee, then they all settle together around the workbench Tony and Steve had dinner at earlier, while Stark picks at the food. He still looks pale and a little listless, but much more alert than he had just a few minutes ago.
That did not, however, preclude the place from being booby-trapped. As Steve grabbed the comparatively small box they were after and tucked it under his arm, he handily forgot everything he ever learned from reading
Tony took the bundle, and frowned as he flipped through them. “I don’t know,” he said, as he produced the birthday card where his father crossed out
There was an interesting amount of strategy involved in the game, where the first few levels were spent gathering parts and customizing your own Tiny Robot, along with a choose your own adventure storyline. You could send the Tiny Robot down a peaceful path of aiding humanity, or opt for the 'Kill All Humans' option, where the Tiny Robot's job was to develop offensive capabilities and eventually lead a rebellion against the human race. It was sort of deep, for a cell phone game. (Steve chose the evil path, getting a little amusement out of playing against type.)
Tony waves offhandedly with his free arm. "I had to convince her I was the real deal, or else she would've thrown me into prison and let me rot there."
"If he does, then we don't need Stark to oust him." Natasha paused, her expression serious. "But I think you and I both know the likelihood of Stane wriggling out of this one."
Tony thought nothing could top the blowjob Steve gave him earlier, but watching Steve bring himself off was somehow just as good, if not slightly better, and Tony watched with fascination as Steve finally came, lips parted and crying out softly.
In the wake of his second orgasm in not so many hours, Tony feels ridiculously boneless and even less like getting out of bed than he had before suggesting a round of sleepy morning sex. Anthony seems similarly lazy, smooshed up against Steve's back, and for once, even Steve is content to get in a few hours more sleep.
"They're fine. Worried about you, Tony." Steve pauses. "It isn't ... it hasn't been the same without you."
Steve laughed, slicking his wet hair back against his head once he had rinsed out all the suds. He guided Tony under the water and helped him to do the same, then Steve molded himself against Tony's back, winding his arms around Tony's waist to hold him close.
Tony blinked, trying to figure out if she was messing with him. Captain America was alive, after seventy years spent sleeping in ice; his partner could very well be a very convincing robot, for all Tony knew.
"At first, I thought they were just some of Machinesmith's androids," Tony answers. "But they're flesh and blood and ... all non-invasive tests indicate, us. Except
Steve's nicest suit paled in comparison to even the more casual ones that Tony wore, though, and Steve developed a bit of a fascination with glimpsing Tony in his different outfits. Grays and blacks and blues, pinstripes and sharkskin and even checkers appeared. Nothing came off the rack; all of the bespoke suits were perfectly tailored to Tony's body, trim at the waist, jacket sleeves falling to show the ideal half-inch of shirt cuff, trousers perfectly hemmed to accommodate the baffling lift shoes that Tony oftentimes wore.
Steve continued on as if completely unaware of this development, settling in to massage Tony's shoulders, where the worst of the tension was centered. Tony made a soft, pained noise when Steve's thumbs dug in on a particularly bad spot, and Steve leaned in to kiss the back of his neck.
"I haven't bought any Christmas presents," Natasha admitted, as they stood back to admire their handiwork.
Steve secured an arm under Tony, supporting the man's weight easily, and braced his other hand against the shower wall for balance. "You could say I'm ...
Steve was systematic, moving up to Tony's ankles and then his calves, pausing whenever he found a stubborn knot of muscle, taking the time to ease the tension away. When Steve reached Tony's thighs, and eventually slid up the bed to straddle Tony's legs and work on his glutes and lower back, Tony discovered that he was not, in fact, too tired to get aroused. His cock twitched against the sheets with interest, even as the rest of his body loosened up.
Somehow, this ended in Clint and Natasha having a knife-throwing contest that involved throwing potatoes into the air and impaling them on the opposite wall. The two spies became especially gleeful when Steve cautioned that Coulson was going to kill them for not getting the security deposit back on the house.
"You're amazing," Tony murmurs, picking up his pace as he draws back, before snapping his hips forward in a harder thrust.
“So, uh - how does this work, exactly?” Tony asked between kisses. He should have been embarrassed over how breathless he was, how his chest was heaving like he had run a marathon, but he absolutely, somehow, did not care. “Do you, uh - keep the mask on, or ...”
Steve was silent for a long moment, even his hands stilling at their work. When he moved again, it was to shift away from Tony, and Tony worried he had said the wrong thing, that Steve really was about to leave, but Steve settled beside Tony instead.
This, Steve was not shy about; in fact, Steve was actually shy about very little, and then usually just silly and seemingly inconsequential things. He
Steve offered him a tired look, but there was something a little bit wry in it. “Honestly? I’m a little surprised by that, too.”
"Go back to New York, I guess," Tony said. He pulled his hands out of his pockets and began to pace up and down the front of the room again, fidgeting with his hands as he went. "Take back my company."
Tony sits down at his desk once the day's chores are done, and finds himself staring at the letter that arrived only this morning from Steve. It's cheerfully worded, announcing Steve's impending return home. Steve's words are filled with cautious optimism about the future, and eagerness to see Tony again.
“Tell that to Spider-Man. He’s probably still trying to pay off that hot dog cart. Remind me to send that guy some money.”
"Come on," Tony said around his own snickering, "I think we could be generous, and at least give it 'pitchfork' as a comparison. Or trident? Nah, that doesn't explain why Attuma wasn't more into him. Me? Whatever."
"Well," Anthony says, obviously trying to lighten the mood. "I hope no supervillains try to attack the second we get home, because I'm way too sore to fight them off."
Steve shifted, pushing up on an elbow to look down at Tony. “Is that what they’re calling it these days?”
Natasha rolled her eyes; Steve felt a little relieved that he wasn't the only one on the receiving end of that look.
"I believe what you told Coulson was that Stark would take one look at him and figure it out," Natasha said, with a pointedly raised eyebrow.
"Guess we'll leave it a mystery for the sake of suspense," Tony teased. He snagged a glass of champagne for each of them, and held one out to Steve. Tony had already had quite a bit to drink; his cheeks were flushed and his eyes sparkled with amusement.
Steve lapped at a bead of water on Tony's neck, catching it on his tongue. "Taking things slow wasn't so bad, was it?"
"This man is currently known as Anthony Carbonell," Fury said. He keyed his controls again, and the display changed to an older looking picture of a much younger man, but he was obviously just a younger version of the same. "Formerly known as Anthony Edward Stark."
Steve has a destination in mind, and after the morning, an even stronger suspicion that Tony might be able to give him some of the answers that he seeks after all. Peggy might have been right in her suggestion that Steve lacks the objectivity for this task, but Steve is feeling determined to prove her - and even more so, himself - wrong.
Natasha shook her head. "We're not completely sure if they're suspicious of us, or if Stane has just had someone watching Stark all this time."
Tony didn’t seem to mind that Steve wasn’t sharing in his moment of opening up. “I miss him,” he said, staring resolutely down at the sandwiches. “Did you know him?”
"My heart?" Tony wonders, glancing down at the glass bubble. He never has gotten used to the sight of his own heart, beating away in his chest. He didn't explain the truth in
Steve, always intent on leaving as much of the suit intact as he could while maintaining Tony's comfort, merely ran his fingertips down the front of Tony's shirt while they kissed, and dropped his hands to Tony's belt, unfastening it with deft fingers.
By the time Steve woke in the morning, his internal clock functioning on a reliable schedule despite the lack of windows and sunlight, Tony was already up and at it. Steve turned over and found a cup of coffee and a bagel - sesame seed, his favorite - waiting for him on the coffee table, which had been cleared of Tony’s mess from the night before.
For whatever reason Agent May was here, her cover was clearly that she was in a relationship with Assistant Principal Coulson, given that the two of them were currently sharing a kiss.
As the two of them grapple with each other's clothes, Steve's coat and Tony's jacket hitting the floor, followed by shoes and shirts and trousers, to fall naked onto a too small bed in a cramped space, Steve can't help but be transported back to an earlier - easier - time in their lives, and he wonders if Tony is remembering the war right now as well.
“More likely he just didn’t know what it was,” Tony agrees. He grabs a prybar and drops it neatly into Steve’s hands. “Captain, if you’ll do the honors?”
The bedroom here is fairly Spartan in design and decor, but it does at least sport a larger bed than the one in Tony's cabin on the dirigible.
Stark is a little shaky on his feet, but manages to make it to the lab shower - usually reserved for chemical incidents - with Steve's help. While Steve lingers with Stark, Tony calls to the kitchen for food, and has an unappetizingly bland meal of chicken broth and crackers waiting by the time they are done.
“And in the morning, we’ll make breakfast for the kids, like good parents,” Tony added, grinning over his shoulder.
librarian; Steve was to be her assistant - who prattled on for a while in a friendly tone about how it was unusual to have a new hire in the middle of the school year, but it had been a special exception that caused the loss of their last assistant, and Steve came so highly recommended by Mr. Coulson ... Steve was glad he went to Tony's party, since meeting so many people there gave him an edge on introductions. He only encountered three or four faces that were newly introduced while making the rounds of the school, though he knew some others weren't actually present at the moment.
Tony, still slouched in his desk chair and feeling a bit dazed, looked up at him. "... where did I go just now?"
"I'm awake," Tony says, running his hand further up Steve's thigh. "Mm, someone else is awake, too."
That definitely did not instill Tony with a great deal of confidence. He took a breath, deep and harsh inside the suit with the speakers off, then he just ... went for it, retracting the armor’s helmet and revealing his face.
Steve followed Tony further into the workshop, which just seemed to keep going, into an area that was more a miniature theater than anything else, with a long couch and a couple of armchairs, a projection screen, and an extensive audio system.
Steve stood, adjusting the parachute that he did not plan to use, just as a burst of turbulence - they were under fire, it sunk in after a second - rocked the dirigible and sent him staggering.
Tony hesitates at his cabin door, leaning his forehead against the door frame and letting his mind drift from his sore ankle.
"I'm a friend of Tony Stark's," Steve says, trying to make himself look just as earnest and trustworthy as possible. "Steve Rogers."
"Huh?" Clint looked puzzled for a moment, before realizing that Steve must have been referring to the mission. "Oh. No, I'm just here to hang out with you guys for Christmas."
"I was just going to ... hit the showers," Steve said. He meant it to be an invitation, and wasn't sure it had worked until Tony reached up and pushed the cowl back from Steve's face as well.
Natasha paused after a sip of beer, and peered at Steve with shrewd, narrowed eyes. "And what else?"
Steve's heart sinks into the pit of his stomach, and he rushes to his pile of discarded clothes, to begin pulling them back on, bloodstains be damned. "What do they want with Tony?"
Drinking in excess had always been out of the question for Steve, even before the serum made it irrelevant; alcohol was an expense his necessarily frugal budget hadn't allowed, though Bucky had sometimes shown up with enough Scotch or bourbon left in the bottom of a bottle for them each to have a nightcap.
“Got it,” Tony grunted, metal clanging as a target glanced off the star at the center of the shield.
was still publishing, but did not feature quite so many fantastical stories. Iron Man had been busy working for the government since before the United States formally entered the war, just like Steve himself, while most of the country remained clueless to the fact that this functioning suit of armor even existed outside of the supposed Frank Finlay’s imagination. Ms. Potts sometimes joked that she would like to write Captain America into her tales, but they both knew that was unlikely to happen.
Steve leaned down and kissed him. "Good. You should get under the covers now, before you catch cold."
He took a deep breath, blew it out in a soft sigh. Tugged off the glove from his right hand, in spite of the cold, and stuck it out. “Private Steve Rogers,” he said.
When the doctor came out to announce the long awaited Anthony Edward was, in fact, Natasha Elizabeth, all eyes in the waiting room turned to the expectant father.
"I don't know." Pepper shrugs. "I was the only one stateside with him. I knew there was something ... different. The way he was acting ..."
doing vigilante planning things with Steve. Mostly because it involved Steve coming to Tony’s office after hours, hanging out while they ate and talked and planned, while Tony explained his tech and Steve listened with interest and asked genuinely curious and thoughtful questions.
If Tony hadn't let his personal vendetta get in the way and insisted on going after von Strucker himself, if he had
; if SHIELD had sent her alone, Tony might have remained none the wiser to their presence in town, although markedly less interested in any of their attempts to get close to him.
Tony's clothes came off much more easily, t-shirt and jeans falling into a heap on the floor where Steve's boots and trousers followed in short enough order. Down to their skivvies and barely accomplishing much by now thanks to their efforts to continue touching and kissing, they moved in an awkward, tumbling shuffle toward the shower.
Steve didn’t mention that the super soldier serum was meant to make healing easier as well. He was sure, being a genius, Iron Man knew already that Captain America was genetically enhanced.
The video reversed, and JARVIS slowed the playback to give Tony a slow-motion view. There was nothing the AI could do to improve the quality, though, so even a frame-by-frame of the footage showed the image of a dark silhouette in the shadows of an alley, foiling the robbery of an electronics store. Pretty small scale stuff, if you asked Tony, but the way the guy moved was anything but amateur: high kicks, backflips, and a very odd weapon of choice.
Steve's smile grew a bit brighter, and he leaned in to kiss Tony lightly on the lips. "I'm glad you understand."
"No." Steve sits up straighter, tries to control the racing of his heart, the way his hearing is nearly drowned by the rush of blood to his head. "I haven't seen Tony in two years. No one has."
Tony is reluctant to leave Steve behind, but the gateway is stable and he trusts Steve's judgment, so he just nods and squeezes Steve's hand before stepping through the portal alone.
Steve shifted his weight from one foot to the other, a little self-conscious. "I think it's pretty obvious that I thought we already were -"
Tony was silent for a moment, looking down. "Yeah," he said when he finally raised his eyes. "I am. I mean, it's a little lonely sometimes, you know? I was practically a kid when I moved here, and it's felt kind of dishonest to let anyone too close."
"I know what you mean," Tony says. "Anyway, I think I'm statistically less likely to get punched in the face by waking up my alternate rather than yours."
Tony shook his head. "Don't be," he said. "I'll be fine. I'm pretty sure Jarvis never thought I'd take his advice and run off for twenty-five years, anyway. He never said anything to me about it whenever we talked before he passed, but ... well, I could always tell he didn't exactly approve."
Steve shifted until his cock slid down between Tony's thighs; Tony made a soft, surprised sound as the head of it nudged against the back of his balls, but it quickly turned into a moan as Steve crowded Tony up against the shower wall. Steve picked up a languorous rhythm, and Tony brought in his knees and pressed his thighs closer together. The water made things a little easier, but the friction was still great enough to compel Steve into an unhurried pace.
The narration eventually tapered off into a series of scenes from an underwater camera, set to weirdly out of place synthesized music. Tony took this lull as an opportunity to strike up conversation, which had to be preferable to ... whatever this was.
Steve wasn't sure what to say to that, so he didn't contribute anything else; he knew better than to get carried away divulging his cover story to Tony, who had no real reason to
Tony declared that he rather liked it that way, anyway; that a memento to remind him of the hard times was a much better means of keeping himself grounded. And, he'd admitted, he sort of liked being able to look down and see his heart thrumming away strongly in his chest, free at last of the repulsor pump and the hundreds of volts of electricity that had kept it going for years.
not to take up the mantle of Captain America once he awoke in the twenty-first century, but at the same time he knew beyond a doubt that he
Steve carried everything but the tree into his bedroom, where he shucked off his coat and sorted through his purchases, leaving the gifts on the bed. They were already wrapped, courtesy of some charitable organization offering gift wrap for donations; Steve had only to add the appropriate tags, and he remembered easily which was which.
Steve's last glimpse of Tony before the medical team blocked his line of sight was Tony standing there, looking helpless, with Steve's blood all over his hands.
This would be Steve's second Christmas since waking in the twenty-first century, but it was the first where he actually felt like celebrating the holiday. All his previous Christmases before the ice had been spent either too poor to do much, or in the midst of a war, and while Steve knew that it was materialistic of him to feel that way, he enjoyed the prospect of getting to indulge in a little shopping for gifts.
Now, Steve wondered if he should skip the booze entirely, or drink and pretend to have a high tolerance (oh, if only they knew). He ultimately ended up grabbing a beer, and circulated his way through the crowd while nursing it. Oddly, things were becoming less fun for him, the more fun everyone else was starting to have. It reminded Steve of parties back in the 40's, when the Commandos would get rip-roaringly drunk in case it was their last night on Earth. The people here had no reason to feel the same way, so maybe it was really just a zest for life that Steve himself was having a hard time sympathizing with.
Tony laughs softly when Steve's socked foot actually teases at the inside of his ankle. "You're in a good mood," he says.
“Hey, I spent my last quarter at the lemonade stand.” Tony grinned briefly, but it was replaced by a serious expression soon enough. “Seriously, Steve. You wanna talk about it?”
“Iron Man uses stolen Stark Tech,” Tony said seamlessly, the same old line he had been giving Agent Coulson for years, except when it came to Steve, the words left a sour taste in his mouth. Even if it wasn’t entirely a lie; Iron Man
Tony looked reluctant, but he fished out his keyring and handed it to Natasha. "Just don't steal any of my stuff."
Tony looked away. “You kept asking me to join you in the field, and I refused, because I was afraid I was going to get someone else hurt.”
Steve sighs, resting his chin against Tony's chest as he looks up at him. "No, it's fine. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious, too."
Steve finds the house number he's looking for, and spends a little time skulking around the street before he simply walks up to the front door and knocks. Peggy would probably have a heart attack if she could see Steve's straightforward approach to spy work.
“I’ve gotta admit,” Tony said after a pause, “I’m a little surprised you aren’t kicking my ass right now.”
Agent Barton shifted in his chair. "Why would a rich kid like that go into hiding in the middle of nowhere?"
Steve gently plucked the card from Tony’s hands and looked at it; he took out the photo and looked at that, too, and whatever he was looking for in it, it made him smile. Then his gloved index finger ran down over the spot where Tony’s dad signed, and he exhaled a sigh, reaching up to push back his cowl.
Tony walks over to the table and places his hand down on the surface of it, next to Steve's. Ordinarily, he might ask what has brought Steve here - and Tony has a pretty good idea - but he finds himself interested in waiting to see where this will all go under Steve's guidance.
“Nah, right now, we’re just gonna be Clint and Steve,” Clint answered. He removed his sunglasses, as if to make that point more obvious, and gave Steve an expectant look.
The way Anthony stares up at the other Steve just ... twists something in Tony's chest. Anthony has his hand pressed against the glass, a longing expression on his face that Tony imagines he wouldn't be wearing if he knew he was being watched.
sex," Steve pointed out, keeping his voice quiet. If she was trying to get a blush out of him, it wasn't going to work.
The next thing Iron Man knew, he was being tossed aside like a ragdoll; of course, for all the fact that the Krampus wasn't bothered at all by the weight of an entire suit of armor, the cubicles on the office level gave easily under the impact. Iron Man crashed through office after office after office, particleboard shattering beneath the weight. By the time he finally came to a halt, he was half into a supply closet, with sticky note pads raining down onto his head and a group of H.E.R.B.I.E. bots beeping at him as they hovered overhead and tutted for the mess he'd made.
Tony offered a lopsided smile. “I don’t know, I thought I was a pretty okay villain. Okay, maybe more of a vigilante, antihero, Han Solo type.”
But then Steve would look at Tony the way he was looking at him right now, like Tony was the smartest person he had ever met. Maybe that much was true, but Steve’s opinion clearly had little to do with Tony’s IQ. He just ... he looked at Tony like he thought Tony could be
the romantic entanglement in peacetime - but he would have to be blind not to admire the captain's fine physique.
"I was in the Army," said Steve. "Enlisted right out of high school. Did a tour of duty in Afghanistan, came back stateside and used military assistance to go to college."
Tony’s fingers were cool and slick when the first one worked inside Steve. He moaned quietly as he was stretched, biting his lower lip to keep from being too loud in the stillness of the early morning. It was not often that he and Tony did things this way, although Steve loved it when they did; there was something about the way Tony opened him up, fingers skilled and careful.
Steve takes the comic book back from Tony, prying it gently from his hands. “I’m sorry. I don’t think it’s easy for them to replicate silver. I can write to Mr. Jameson, see if it can be fixed -”
"Yeah, me too." Tony sighed. "It was a stupid coincidence. I had this whole dumb indie movie thing going on, you know? The teenage roadtrip with my best friend after a life-changing event, trying to find myself, the whole schtick."
"Oh, God," Steve gasps, fighting the urge to tense up. He takes a deep breath and tries to relax, knowing it will only make things more difficult if he doesn't. It's been a long time, but Steve's body remembers this, and opens to the intrusion after a moment of Tony's careful touch.
"Right." Tony looked politely disinterested, but he gave it a moment before saying, "Well, I've gotta get to class. If I don't see you again before the end of the day, have a merry Christmas."
How Steve Rogers manages to sound scandalized by ill manners while being adept at sarcasm of his own, is beyond Tony’s comprehension.
"I have." Namor looks distinctly smug, to have gained the upper hand in their conversation. "I'm the one who took him to Madripoor."
Steve skipped the glasses - the lenses were non-corrective, and vision was one of the few areas where he
"Good. Now where were we?" Tony slid a hand around the back of Steve's neck and tugged him in for a kiss.
Jim sighs when Jarvis walks out, and he walks up to the side of the cot, reluctance written all over his face. "We got Zola, but ... Barnes didn't make it."
Inside the castle, Cap and Iron Man braced for an attack, but the place was eerily deserted. They shared a sidelong glance - Iron Man’s as subtle as it could be through that helmet, anyway - and continued on. It did stand to figure, from a certain tactical perspective, that defense of this location was only so strategically important. Major troop movements to guard what was supposedly a single item would call unwanted attention to the place.
It takes a long moment for them to get sorted out again, untangled and cleaned up as well as can be expected, and piled into bed in some semblance of order. Whether Anthony will stay the night with them isn't even a question; Steve and Tony just fold him up under the covers with themselves, and they all drift to an exhausted and satisfied sleep.
Tony shakes his head, laughing again as he turns back to his work. "I suppose after all these years, I should've known that mutually kicking Batroc the Leaper's ass would turn into a form of foreplay for us."
“Yeah, I’m good,” Tony said. He shifted out from under the desk and moved to stand, and it was that action that inspired the Captain to move the rest of the way into the office, as his strong, gloved hand took Tony by the elbow and helped Tony to his feet.
The slow pace that Tony took, long and deep and gradual, pulling out nearly all the way before he pressed completely back inside, had them both shaking with self-restraint. He was careful, gentle even, and Steve couldn’t even think of what they were doing as sex so much as Tony sweetly making love to him.
Tony paused, eyes flitting up to Steve’s face, and whatever he found on Steve’s expression (aside from heavy-lidded and deeply aroused) was enough to inspire him to stop, albeit reluctantly. He slowly pulled off, and tipped his head back to look questioningly up at Steve, his parted lips red and slick.
"As long as you don't have a Captain America poster hanging over your bed or something," Steve said, fighting to keep a straight face. "That might be a little weird."
Tony doesn't know that anyone can claim an allergy to sodium pentathol, at least not one like that, and his lie shows in how unconvinced Jim looks.
“While I think you all lack in adventurous spirit,” Tony says, “I’ll concede the point. Let’s move things to the lab and I’ll take a look there.”
"The kitchen is stocked," Natasha said. "And at least we know Stane isn't likely to be making much of a move in the area in this. He probably thinks his hired thug is bogged down by the snow and ice."
Tony bit back a groan of annoyance; he really did not want to be having this conversation right now. "All in a day's work," he said, trying to deflect the topic.
"I told you," Steve answers, "I don't expect any promises." He runs his hands up Tony's arms, back down his sides. "I'm happy to be here with you, now, and to take things one step at a time."
Tony has a corner suite, and Steve considers simply breaking and entering, but he is apparently already on shaky ground with getting Tony to trust him right now, so he settles for knocking.
Steve leaned over and kissed Tony softly on the corner of the mouth. “Makes it a little less embarrassing that Iron Man is mine, I suppose.”
Steve laughed, looking inordinately pleased with himself - and more than a bit smug. He glanced at his watch. "I think you're
"I haven't even been here five minutes and you're trying to get my clothes off," Tony complained, though he followed the words by shrugging out of his coat and handing it off to Steve.
It's awkward, at first, approaching this with more care than they had the night before. Steve kisses his way down Tony's neck, to reverently press his lips against the bubble over Tony's heart. In contrast to the warmth of the metal, the glass is cool to the touch, and Steve pauses for a moment, listening to the reassuring beat of Tony's heart. He's a little surprised to find Tony isn't wearing the cover any longer; Steve wonders if he needs to charge the pump more often, these days.
Steve finished the water, handed back the empty bottle, and dropped his head against the pillows. "And the shooter?"
Tony laughed softly in the space between them, the tension broken. Steve shifted around to brace himself on one hand so that he could begin to return the favor, unfastening Tony's jeans. They both wriggled their clothes down just enough to be out of the way, impatience taking precedence over the desire to see each other naked, and Steve settled in close, pressing himself along the length of Tony's body.
"And how can you be so sure?" Tony snaps. There's no mistaking the bitterness in his tone. He tosses back his entire drink and sets the glass down on the table with a clink.
Tony peered at him for a moment, his expression searching. "Yeah, I guess you might. So ... I decided not to tell anyone where I was. I'd already gotten an ID with a fake name, so I tweaked the age a little. Fake diplomas weren't hard to come by, though obviously I went a little more low key than MIT-educated, speed-learning genius."
Steve excused himself from the general assembly to stash the gifts in the car, and to generally give himself a breather. In spite of the noise of the party a short distance away, it was eerily quiet outside. Steve glanced up at the sky, and could see stars for the first time he remembered since waking up. He had considered taking a road trip before, getting to see more of the country he only briefly glimpsed while on his war bonds tour, but the timing hadn't been right. For all his misgivings in being here, though, the area didn't seem bad. The people were friendly, and it felt like a subtle enough place to get lost.
Steve checks his watch in the slant of sunlight coming in through the apartment's single, poorly shuttered window, and forces his feet onto the floor.
. Which was Tony’s entire reason for not being able to give up sleeping with him. Really. It had nothing to do with him being good or noble or kind or ...)
“Operating out of state, even,” Tony agreed. “Maybe after his run-ins with you, he isn’t interested in me or New York anymore.”
It didn't take long for Steve to figure out what had grabbed Tony's attention: in the parking lot, Agent Coulson was standing by a car, but across from him stood a dark-haired woman. Even in her heavy coat, scarf, and sunglasses, Steve recognized Agent Melinda May, but he couldn't readily fathom what might have prompted Coulson to bring yet another operative into the fray.
"Clint is just being a child," Natasha said, with a roll of her eyes. "He's upset that Coulson didn't choose him instead of you for this assignment."
"You and Cap have gotten awfully cozy," Clint said. He made it sound like a complaint. It probably was.
Natasha shrugged. "Obadiah Stane is a billionaire thanks to Tony Stark's absence. You'd be surprised, the lengths people will go to in order to keep their money."
In response, Dum-E tilted its claw in the same direction, and Steve caught sight of a camera lens that looked sort of like an eye.
Reed is even able to provide a glimpse for Anthony to his own universe, ensuring that all is well, and they slip a message through to the other Avengers. It turns out that the four Avengers have been gone only a few weeks, and while the remaining heroes in their world have certainly been worried about their absence, they have been handling things capably enough.
Any doubt that might have been in Steve's mind that Tony was simply humoring him was laid to rest by the way Tony kissed him, like Tony was worried Steve might be the one with second thoughts. Steve struggled to slow the kiss, a difficult but not insurmountable task even with Tony's tongue in his mouth, but he didn't fight the way Tony had rucked up the hem of Steve's ill-gotten shirt.
"I'd be happy to show Anthony over there," Steve says, smiling. "It's a nice day, we could even walk."
“The feeling’s mutual.” Steve led the way from the elevator when it slid to a halt, and down the hall toward their rooms.
The sound of one door loudly whacking against the brick startles them both into jumping apart a solid foot. Steve’s eyes widen a hair before he sags in relief on seeing who has just walked in, and Tony turns to see Jim Rhodes and Steve’s partner, Bucky Barnes, walk into the workshop.
By the time Natasha caught up with him an hour later, Steve had made the rounds, met a few of his 'fellow' teachers, and eventually followed the action out onto the dock and watched while the group launched the rocket into the sky. Natasha described the house and its decor - which seemed to consist of a lot of framed movie posters and other odd memorabilia on the walls and shelves - as 'nerd chic,' and slipped off to go snooping around the rest of the place.
Fortunately, Steve rarely seemed to worry about anything of that nature ... or, if he did, he never mentioned it to Tony; Steve was great that way.
-- Representatives of the United States Army announced today that after more than half a decade spent defending the American way, Captain America will be heading on a new mission: retirement.
“My life before this,” Steve explained. “I was a soldier. World War II. On the Allied side, don’t worry.”
"Are you sure it doesn't look stupid?" Steve wondered, as he checked his new haircut and glasses in the mirror for the third or fourth time.
A cheer sounded through the assembled crowd in response to the words, and Hyperion flashed a broad white smile at the camera before the screen changed back to J. Jonah Jameson’s mustachioed face.
"How do you do it?" Steve asked, feeling rude but having it outweighed by his curiosity. "Get to know so many people who won't be a part of your life once the mission is done?"
A part of Steve thrilled, in spite of his exhaustion and the numerous other things weighing on his mind at the moment. Getting to be in a
Namor's expression twists, and he leans forward again, narrowing his eyes at Steve. "And you would have me believe this has nothing to do with the fact that Tony Stark is living in Hightown?"
The crunch of footsteps in the snow preceded Agent May's arrival at their side; Steve was pretty sure she'd purposely made noise to interrupt the moment.
The other houses on the street seemed less deserted than they did the night of Tony's party; one family was out on their front lawn building a snowman, and another couple of kids were running around playing with what were probably new toys from Santa.
Barton sat down in the chair across the desk and, at Coulson's warning look, did not put his feet up. "Fine, but ten bucks still says that Uncle Sam blows it."
What Steve wanted most right now was to brush his teeth - his palate was permanently damaged, he was sure, by the fuzzy coating of sugar from all the cookies, hot cocoa, and apple cider - but his stomach rumbled agreeably at the idea of bacon and eggs.
Anthony runs a hand through his hair, ruffling it from its already messy state into something even more disheveled. "No, I was just having trouble sleeping. I should've realized you two would be, um - in the middle of something. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, I'm - I'm gonna go."
Steve actually startled at the voice, and as he turned to see Tony standing there, he looked really hilarious, like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar or something. (Tony had a lot of experience being that kid, though, and he didn’t think embarrassment or shame was ever anything
Cap nodded, and glanced around. Half a dozen H.E.R.B.I.E.s had hovered into the room; one, wielding a clipboard, floated up.
The journey to Madripoor is not inconsiderable by air, and even longer by sea, especially since Namor refuses to deploy the submarine until they are closer to their destination. Steve studies reports and writes letters to occupy his mind, and takes up pacing the deck of the fishing trawler in much of his free time, finding sleep hard to come by in the boat's tiny berth.
Christmas was a beautiful time in New York, and traditionally a quiet holiday, in that even supervillains tended to take a few days off; it was likely that many of them actually had families to spend time with. The same could even be said of a few superheroes: Jan went home for the holidays (well ... "home" was subjective; her family was from Manhattan, but the Van Dynes were spending Christmas in the Catskills) and took Hank with her; Storm accepted T'Challa's invitation to the winter celebrations in Wakanda; and Spider-Man went off to spend Christmas with an aunt and the girlfriend he insisted he had. Even Wolverine had roamed off to see the other X-Men.
“You see right through me,” Tony said. “It would just be a more ... subtle way of lending him a hand. Financially speaking.”
Natasha slid open the lid on the wooden box Steve had stolen from the castle. It was more of a miniature crate; inside, it was filled with packing materials, which padded a much smaller and very ornate second box. Steve scooted closer to have a better look, as Natasha reached inside and carefully lifted it out.
They do put their heads together and come up with ideas for the next three editions, at least: vague accounts of classified missions that Pepper can stretch and spin into something for her readers' consumption.
Steve sat up on his knees and tugged his sweater over his head; he was still sporting some heavy bandages from the hospital, but he felt only a little sore as he stretched out his arms.
correct, the room was empty save for crate upon crate of undoubtedly priceless items, stamped with markings indicating origin, destination, and coded hints as to their contents.
Tony sighs. "Steve, I might be flagrant with my regard for the law and social mores, but you're Captain America. Even if I weren't worried about my reputation, I have some regard for yours."
"He fits the profile," said Coulson. He set his files and his tablet down on the desk, and went to the filing cabinet by the window, where a single-cup coffee maker sat. He loaded a single serving coffee pod into it, set his mug under the dispenser, and pressed the button, trying very hard not to rub his aching forehead while Barton persisted.
"Admittedly," Anthony says, "I've never slept with Steve." He looks over at the stasis pods in the corner, something guilty but thankfully brief flickering over his face. "Not that I haven't thought about it."
Steve was grateful for Tony's peculiarity in that regard, as Tony scratched blunt nails over Steve's scalp, lathering up shampoo as Steve ducked down to enjoy the massage.
Pepper shakes her head and summons up a smile, and she spends a moment clearly casting about for a change of subject before asking, "So, where are you off to on your next assignment?"
Anthony smiles at them both. "Thank you," he says. "For the hospitality - and the amazing sex. I'll see you later."
Steve felt nervous, uncomfortably on edge, by the time he reached Tony's house and pulled into the driveway. The garage door opened as it had before, and Steve parked his car inside. Christmas decorations still bedecked the space, but Dum-E had traded out his felt antlers for a paper party hat that bore the year '2013' across it in foil letters.
“I couldn’t ever be embarrassed by my love of Iron Man,” Steve said. Somehow he managed to keep his expression solemn, despite the twinkle in his eyes. “In fact, you
The door bursts in moments later, but Tony is quickly slipping from consciousness, sagging in his bonds as his body finally goes still. The last thing he sees before blacking out is Jim's worried face, framed in the open helmet of the War Machine, hovering in front of him.
Tony’s bedroom door stood ajar, which Steve took as a good sign - an unspoken invitation - but it was dark and quiet inside. He knocked on the doorframe anyway before stepping in, and closed the door behind him with his heel.
"I'm getting the idea," Steve says, leaning in again. "But ... I might need a little more convincing."
have been heard by everyone else in the penthouse at the moment. As Tony went boneless against the bed, twitching with the aftershocks of his orgasm, Steve slowed his pace to a complete standstill, and leaned down to kiss Tony.
Tony was a lively teacher, even after nearly twenty years on the job. He received consistently high marks on evaluations, all his coworkers loved him, and he rarely missed a day of school. A more model teacher, no one could have found. The students loved him, too; they referred to him informally as 'Mr. Tony,' and most of them performed well in science with him as a teacher.
Anthony goes at it with enthusiasm, licking and sucking and going slack when he needs to, letting Tony thrust into his mouth, relaxing his throat until Tony can just fuck right into him, and the rhythm of Steve's hips helps, the way he moves with Anthony bringing them all rhythmically closer together. Steve leans over Anthony, and he's got Anthony's legs nearly pushed up against his chest, bending him between them, as Steve winds his hand around the back of Tony's neck and catches Tony's mouth with his own for a kiss. Tony cups Steve's cheek in his hand and returns the kiss, messy and dirty and
Suddenly bathed in the blue-white glow of the arc reactor shining from the center of Tony’s chest, Steve hitched a breath.
"Yeah. Well," Steve corrected. "Friend. She's really more like my sister. When she found out I was moving out here, she applied to the area, too. She's actually starting as the new guidance counselor next semester."
"You needed the full-face mask," Tony said. "Even the Red Skull couldn't miss that patriotic browline of yours."
Tony sits, and another pair of the soldiers drag his hands behind his back, tying them behind the chair.
Tony wonders if it can be so easy; as much as he hates to look a gift horse in the mouth, he didn't get where he is in life by not being a paranoid bastard.
"The car you saw the other night," Natasha said. "Clint ran the plates when he got back to New York, like he said he would. It traced back to a shell corporation SHIELD has suspected has ties to Stane, but we didn't have any solid links until now."
It is, for a moment, like Dr. Abraham Erskine's murder all over again, watching a man who holds a secret die right in front of him, victim to a Hydra bullet.
"I need transportation," says Steve. "A way into Madripoor without detection, and I know you still have connections in Buccaneer Bay. You can get me in without papers."
“I brought you dinner,” Steve said. He nodded toward the table, where the tray held a plate of pizza, along with some aspirin, a glass of water, and a bottled sports drink.
"I'm always prepared, in case of emergency." Tony opens his shirt and tugs a pair of wires free from the repulsor pump.
Steve's stomach sinks, and he stares hard at the hooded figure, desperately hoping that some shred of the man's personality has held on. "
Steve nodded, then he turned concerned, looking up at Tony. There were shadows across his face from the way his splayed fingers blocked the light. “Is it powering your heart?”
Natasha gave one of her secretive half-smiles. "I did. I'm afraid that, until we determine whether Stane has more eyes on you in the area, then it's for the best that you don't return home."
"Howard and Maria Stark died in a car accident in 1987, around this time of year," said Fury. "Their only son, Anthony, went under the radar a few weeks later. Shortly after that, Tony Carbonell showed up in Cedar Falls and took a position working as a teaching assistant."
"He's the last known carrier of the Zemo formula, Commander," Agent Drew says, her eyebrows furrowing in concern. "The knowledge of how to concoct the formula was lost when Baron von Strucker was arrested; he was the last remaining Hydra agent to know its composition, not even the Red Skull knew. In his last letter before his execution, von Strucker wrote that Tony Stark was the recipient, but it's taken us this long to break his code."
Tony was pretty sure he needed a lot more than aspirin right now, but it was the thought that counted, right?
This is the most uninterrupted time they've had to spend together, just the two of them, in all the years they've known each other, and Steve isn't quite sure what he'll do when it has to come to an end.
wind up having a spirited competition to see who can capture the best and most patriotic images of Cap and Iron Man together on the field of battle. Sales for both publications soar, and the division that prints Captain America's official comic book begins negotiations for inclusion of Iron Man in the tales of the Star-Spangled Man.
“Of all the ...” Tony muttered. “JARVIS, enact Dr. Jekyll Protocol, engage with the Captain -- defensive mode, and retreat. Take the long way home.”
“Come here,” he urged, until their bodies were in alignment enough that Tony could get his hand around both their cocks. Well, almost - but Steve was clearly adaptable, reaching between them to pick up Tony’s slack in a firm grasp.
Steve shrugged, and turned back to his task, feeding quarters into the machine. “I don’t mind doing it myself. It’s … soothing.”
It was probably a sign of how far they still had to go, that this was the first time they’d really stopped to talk about it.
Steve feels like the bottom has dropped out; he just got Tony back, now he's going to lose him again?
"Yeah," Tony agreed, still having difficulty finding words for what they just did. He decided to follow Steve's lead and leave it, for the time being. "Um."
Steve took the lead once they were further inside. Both he and Iron Man had studied the blueprints, and while Iron Man was armored, Cap was in a better position for close quarters contact right now, especially as the corridors narrowed and allowed the armor less space to maneuver.
Steve pulled his car into the driveway and idled for a few moments, waiting for the garage door to close again. He was grateful to have parked inside; it looked like even more fresh snow had fallen while they were having their movie marathon. The street in front of Tony's house was understandably quiet at this time of night - it was past 3 am - though Steve noticed a car parked along the curb as he pulled out of Tony's driveway. The dark sedan was conspicuous because of the tell-tale exhaust visible in the cold air, and as he drove by, Steve saw someone sitting in the driver's seat. Someone who seemed to duck down when Steve passed.
Ultimately, Steve can make neither heads nor tails of most of the documents. A few look like specifications for parts of the Iron Man suit, possibly doodled in idle time, since as far as Steve knows, Tony hasn't touched a suit of armor in even longer than he has spent exiled. It's easy to imagine Tony, sitting at that rickety table with a hangover, sketching his armor in the margins of a page.
Steve gets to his feet and helps Tony sit up. He goes through the room with Agent Drew, checking on the Hydra soldiers, tying up or handcuffing the ones who seem mostly likely to wake soon. Steve removes his own handcuffs from his other wrist, and goes to help Tony outside. He's a little worried by just how much Tony leans against him on the way out.
Reed comes over to help set up the equipment once it's finished fabricating, and when they've completed the last test necessary to be confident that Anthony will, indeed, get back to his universe in one piece, they assemble in the workshop to arrange the transport. Tony feels almost sentimental over the prospect of saying goodbye.
"Hold that thought," Steve says, oblivious to what Tony was about to say, as someone knocks on the door. He rolls out of bed and hops into his pants, stepping over to the door.
They have been through this before, more times than Steve can now count, and still they are no closer to reaching a conclusion about why Tony Stark one day left his Manhattan penthouse and was never heard from again. No one has reliably seen or heard from Tony since that day, though numerous sightings have been reported in the quest for the sizable reward Stark International is offering for locating him.
Steve’s other hand, big and warm, curled firmly on Tony’s hip, holding him steady while Steve picked up the pace, adopting a rhythm that was hard and deep and exactly what Tony needed. Steve was always happy to indulge, responding easily to Tony’s requests for
"I don't forget the favors I owe." Namor nods his head in the direction of the hatch, and Steve follows him down, to the cramped captain's cabin. The real
far into their cups; someone had struck up a rousing rendition of "Jingle Bells," out of sync with the music that was playing from the sound system.
Tony swallows hard, looking up at Steve. "I've never talked about Howard to anyone," he admits softly. "Not like this."
Steve moved further into the room and cleared his throat lightly as he awkwardly leaned against one of the student tables across from Tony, conscious not to put too much of his weight on it. "I don't mean to intrude, I just ... wanted to say I'm sorry."
"Are you about to break up with me?" Tony wondered abruptly. He wasn't sure why those were the words that came out of his mouth, but now there was no taking it back, and he was a little concerned that he had given Steve such an easy opening. There was nothing to do now but own it. "Because if you are, I mean, you don't have to ease me into it, I can --"
“Morning.” Steve took a sip of his coffee, before shuffling to his feet, taking the bagel along as he headed over to examine Tony’s work.
The handful of pieces that ultimately take up a corner of his lab space are Tony's first priority. The stasis pods were a lucky find, lucky for their inhabitants, at least, after Madripoor's tech failure that evening. Each of the units has a built in power supply, but those didn't make much difference against a complete shutdown of their systems; fortunately, Tony was able to get them up and running again on the way back from Madripoor.
May rolled her eyes and got to her feet while Tony spluttered about her identity. A near swarm of agents had flooded across the yard in the last few seconds, with more still running in from the house; from his place on the ground, Steve watched as his assailant was carted off in handcuffs and another agent - identifiable even with the cold weather gear over his suit - scurried past with the weapon in an evidence bag.
Steve shook his head as he climbed up the foot of the bed after Tony. "Shouldn't you be infatuated with the love lives of superheroes?"
"Anthony," Jarvis said, his tone quiet but insistent enough to compel Tony to look up. "I believe you'll do great things. You'll find a way of helping people with your robotics and your ideas; you needn't build weapons to leave a mark on the world."
," he said, moving his grip to Tony's ass and sweeping him up in one smooth movement, "I'm not sure it's a good idea."
Tony was too spent to even consider getting hard again, but he still felt a warm flush of arousal just in response to the erotic display. Steve was gorgeous, and quite unrestrained for a guy who grew up in a time when such a thing was still considered pretty taboo. That, really, just made it even hotter.
Tony stared at Steve for a long, solemn moment, and Steve stared back, searching Tony’s troubled expression, trying to reassure.
“Oh. Yeah,” Tony said. “Yes, I’m ...” He paused, surveying the damage to the lab, but his attention was drawn soon enough to the way the Captain’s touch lingered on his back. They had layers between them, armored gloves and a shirt, and an undershirt -- Tony’s means of hiding the arc reactor from public view -- and yet it was distractingly ...
Steve smiles. "It was fine. I know there's more to this whole Kashmir Vennema thing, but I have to do some more digging. In the meantime, I thought it was foolish to stay out in the field with no information, when I could be here with you."
"Romanoff, Rogers," Director Fury spoke up. "You two will be going undercover at the Cedar Falls middle school, with Coulson as your supervising agent. There are two open positions; you can fight amongst yourselves. Agent Coulson will give you the details."
Tony opens the door to a tiny studio apartment and lets Steve enter first. Steve glances around at the shabby furnishings and turns to raise a questioning eyebrow at Tony.
Dum-E made a whirring sound in response. Steve laughed, and tentatively patted the robot the way that Tony had just a moment ago. The whirring took on a tone that seemed almost ... pleased?
Steve reached his hand out, and Dum-E dropped a small remote control - a garage door opener, Steve realized - into it. He'd thought Tony was joking about his experiment into artificial intelligence ... or maybe the robot was just programmed to help show people out. Steve glanced back into the theater area, where Tony hadn't moved, and shrugged.
Sternberg raises an eyebrow. "Then you should know I am here in his employ, Commander. I am in Madripoor of my own free will, at the request of Mr. Anthony Stark. Does that satisfy your curiosity?"
Steve Rogers finishes skimming the story of his own retirement, and tries not to find the idea surreal. He lowers the newspaper to the table in front of him, as the rest of the column devolves into a puff piece about Captain America's many accomplishments; Steve remembers it all quite vividly, and has little interest in reliving his 'glory days,' so to speak.
At that moment, as he eagerly scrambled out of bed after Tony, Steve was relieved that Natasha had insisted he take the master bedroom with the bathroom attached. They indulged in quite a bit more shameless touching once they were in the shower, and Steve patiently waited through Tony's inspection of the now nearly healed bullet wound in his side. The mark was down to just a vaguely pink spot with shiny new skin stretched over top, and Steve was a little self-conscious of the fact that Tony paid it so much mind.
The Captain opened his mouth, and Tony prepared himself to hear the man decline, but his expression merely shifted beneath the cowl before he answered, “It would be my pleasure.”
“No, no, it’s ...” Tony shakes his head and holds his hand out for the comic again. “Have you read it, yet?”
When Steve sat down to dinner with Natasha that evening, he was already anticipating what her reaction might be to his news. Instead, he was surprised when Natasha led into the conversation with, "Coulson's brought May on board because they suspect Stane might be on to us."
"The Avengers," Tony says. "Iron Man, Cap - Commander Rogers, Thor, and a Banner who hadn't Hulked out yet?"
And somehow, even though they lost more and more clothes each time they met for a tryst, Tony managed to keep his shirt on and he never happened to find Steve’s wallet hanging out in the back pocket of his sinfully tight uniform (or in the inexplicable belt pouches, either), waiting to shed light on the guy’s identity.
Anthony - and that has nothing to do with ego, because the two of them seem different enough in practice, even if they have been cut from similar cloth.
The two of them never had taken too much time out to learn each other's bodies, which was easily enough explained away by the fact that they had also never made it to a bed. So far it had been all hands and mouths, stealing off down disused hallways or finding an empty office, and one particularly memorable encounter alone on the Avengejet with the controls on auto-pilot.
“About that,” Tony said, with a hint of chagrin. “I can’t go home again - my place is swarming with SHIELD agents. Hyperion took off my faceplate. The funny thing is, he already seemed to know I’d be Tony Stark under there.”
Tony shrugged, sliding his hands up Steve's arms, from wrist to shoulder. "Not really thinking about practicality right now, Cap."
Tony pulled a face. "Sure beats threatening your kids with a lump of coal in their stocking, I guess."
"Come on," Zemo says. He kneels down gingerly in front of Steve, and reaches up to tug off the hood, revealing Tony Stark's grimly smiling face. His eyes are bloodshot, rimmed with red, and his entire expression has a manic look about it. "I think we're on close enough terms you can call me
The focus moved in on a little girl standing in the crowd behind them, clutching her pet chihuahua. “Go Avengers!” she cried.
Given the perils of his double life, Tony was strictly not a relationship guy, and it stood to reason that a vigilante hookup should have been a hit-it-and-quit-it situation, but the universe seemed to have other ideas. Tony resolutely did not believe in karma, fate, destiny, kismet, serendipity,
The whine of the repulsor charging in Iron Man’s gauntlet was Steve’s cue: as Tony began to fire at Falcon, Steve threw his shield through the doorway to deflect the blast. Black Widow dove out of the way as Steve emerged from the back of the jet, catching the shield.
on that mission to take down Zola. (If he had been on that mission to take down Zola, an insidious part of Tony's mind adds, he wouldn't have faced von Strucker to such disastrous results.)
Not that Steve had ever practiced that kind of thinking. To the contrary of many of his fellow servicemen, Steve had been, well, too
Anthony steps out of the sleep pants and sits down on the edge of the bed under the guidance of Steve's urging hands. Tony settles in behind him, watching with almost as much fascination as Anthony does when Steve sinks down to his knees in front of them; Steve is showing off a little, Tony can tell, but he enjoys the show too much to call him on it.
Steve sighed, but it was a fondly exasperated noise. "One of these days, I'm going to do this right."
Steve couldn't help breaking away from the kiss to moan a soft encouragement when Tony's hand slipped inside his briefs.
Steve polished off the bagel in relatively short order, and sipped at his coffee again while he studied the information on the displays. “This is all good work,” he said. “What about the other three?”
"-- VERY, VERY NAUGHTY," the Krampus concluded, as they collided. The thing barely moved, catching Iron Man in its grasp. It definitely wasn't a living, flesh and blood creature, the armor's scanners registered at this range. As if the grip that was causing the sound of buckling metal beneath it wasn't enough indication of that.
Feeling like a creeper and really hoping that Steve wouldn’t take it the wrong way, Tony decided to walk inside, figuring that he’d come all this way and it was pointless to go back by himself. Maybe he could talk Steve into a cab, or call Happy around with a car.
He was just on the edge of unconsciousness, ready to embrace the blackness behind his eyelids, when someone knocked on the door.
“Temporal mechanics just don’t make sense where the Infinity Stones are concerned.” Tony sighed. “I hate magic. Or phenomenal cosmic power. Whatever you want to call it. But even those couldn’t make us someone we’re not.”
"The last person reported to have seen Stark was the family butler, Edwin Jarvis," Coulson answered. "Unfortunately, Mr. Jarvis passed away a few years ago. The memorial service was private, so we never were able to confirm whether Stark attended."
"When Hydra cropped up in Madripoor," she says, "we started to worry that he might be a target. But he appears to be there of his own free will, and as far as we can tell, Hydra is leaving him alone."
Steve followed Tony down to the garage once the rest of the team had dispersed, and settled himself down at one of Tony's workbenches to wait while Tony got out of the armor.
Anthony snickers, but they take pity on Steve and cease the running commentary at least long enough for Anthony to lift off Steve, though he settles back onto Tony without moving any further.
The fact that Captain America had an office in Avengers Tower was a well-kept secret, known only to a handful of people. Steve liked to insist it was more like a study, but given his tendency to retreat there to review battle footage or read reports, Tony felt the term office held up to scrutiny. The door was ajar when Tony got there, and he nudged it open a little further, expecting to find Steve there. He wasn’t disappointed; Steve was sitting on the squashy couch in the corner, reading something on his StarkPad.
Tony pressed closer, insinuating a thigh between Steve's legs while he worked at the front of Steve's uniform, ripping open fastenings and tugging down zippers. Steve shrugged out of the heavy outer layer of his uniform, and reluctantly pulled away from the kiss to tug the undershirt over his head.
Steve's sobs are gradually reduced to quiet shudders, and he finally leans back to sniffle down at Tony. "I'm sorry."
The kiss is brief and chaste, a quick, sweet press. Steve's lips are chapped from wind exposure, but Tony wouldn't change the moment for anything.
When Tony makes contact with the sphere, his fingertips brushing the cool metal surface, the thing hums to life, all the etched lines and symbols lighting up in an eerie blue glow. The light grows brighter, and brighter, until finally it explodes like the flash of a hundred cameras at once.
Director Fury swept out of the room, evidently having made an appearance just to impress the importance of the situation upon those in attendance. Steve had seen the behavior before in his superiors during the war, but found himself at a bit of a loss. He wasn't cut out for undercover work.
“Yeah, how about not pulling a stunt like that again,” Quill said. “You know what it’s like to look outside and see the Herald is someone you know? You nearly gave us a heart attack, and that was
Tony laughed softly. “Sorry about letting you sleep out there, by the way. I tried to wake you up, but you were pretty out of it.”
Tony remains like that the rest of the night, unable to find sleep of his own, but content to keep vigil over Steve. It feels selfish, even so; Tony can feel the door closing on this chapter of his life. Their time together is limited ... Tony doesn't know how many more times he will get to hold Steve, before the dark thing growing in his mind turns him into someone Steve won't recognize anymore.
“Even if you did interrupt my attempt to take care of you,” Tony said, and it was clear he was trying to keep his tone light, but there was still a complaint in the words. He took a step back from the counter and allowed Steve to steer their way from the kitchen.
There were a lot of confusing straps and buckles to the uniform, and Tony grunted his frustration as he pulled ineffectually at them. Then his back was hitting the soft cushions of the couch and he decided to go for what he knew - straight below the belt, that was.
By the time Iron Man found his way back to the conference room where this all started -- walking back through the offices was a lot more difficult than crashing through them on the direct route -- Captain America was delivering a final blow to the back of the downed Krampus' neck. Sparks flew as circuitry malfunctioned, and the entire thing went limp.
"I sent them out to the front room." She shrugs slightly. "Let's just say my superpower is ... being very persuasive."
While the bacon began to sizzle on the stove, Steve casually noted, "I'm going over to Tony's today."
He did feel a little ridiculous with only a haircut and glasses constituting a disguise, like he was Clark Kent hiding his secret identity, but the new haircut went a long way toward modernizing his appearance, and his hair looked darker as a result. Natasha's guidance in that area had been wise, and she had assisted him in purchasing a new wardrobe of clothes that were appropriate for a low level teaching salary. Coulson had provided a few collegiate shirts for Steve's supposed alma mater, as well as a worn gray sweatshirt emblazoned with the word 'ARMY' in bold black letters on its front.
At least she didn't make any comment on what he and Steve had obviously been doing, which was better than Tony could have expected out of some of
Steve shifts on the stool next to Tony's, but that is his only sign of discomfort. Tony changes the subject just the same, unsure whether Steve wants to air their business to this other universe's Iron Man.
Steve was impressed, watching Iron Man clunk toward the dilapidated castle entrance, that the armor had reached such a level of mobility. Since he first began to work with Iron Man, the armor had been streamlined down, shrunken a good thirty percent; in its earlier depictions in the magazines, it was even a few heads taller than it was back in 1940. Now, it stood merely a head above Steve himself, coming in at just short of seven feet high.
“I just ... like what I do, and how I do it,” Steve said. “Watching out for my neighborhood and the people in it. I don’t need more attention, or glory, or whatever it is that the Squadron is looking for.”
The only other agent left standing, this one a man, asks a question in German; the woman quickly responds with low-pitched words, after which Steve hears footsteps, the sound of something (a body, his mind supplies) being dragged across the floor, and the bedroom door closing.
," he commanded, rolling over and pulling the blankets over his head, but the alarm trilled on loudly. "JARVIS! Shut it off!"
"The world concept was my idea, but I've got someone who helps with the little story details." Tony sat down on the arm of Steve's chair. It was an awfully intimate move, unconscious of personal space.
Steve fastens on his holster, checking his handgun and his extra ammunition, and shrugs into his suit jacket. As an afterthought on his way out the door, he grabs the decanter of liquor that Tony had been drinking from the night before, and pours it down the bathroom sink. Tony isn't likely to be happy about it, and Steve doesn't delude himself into thinking that Tony can't get more, easily, but at least it should slow him down for a while.
Steve glanced around to see if recognition dawned on the faces of the other agents, but Natasha and Clint were blank. There was something familiar about the man in the photo, with his dark hair and eyes, and neatly trimmed goatee, but Steve couldn't quite put his finger on it.
It was more than Steve had, and that realization was enough to make Steve experience a pang of guilt - certainly not his first - about what he was doing.
. It felt odd to think that his first date in seventy years was going to be with someone he hardly knew, under very false pretenses. Then again, he supposed his blind double dates with the girls Bucky set him up with hadn't been far off from that.
On the other side of the room, the woman laughs. "By my count, Commander," she says, "you're out of ammunition. Come out, and we can discuss this like civilized adults."
They always went back to Tony’s place. They never discussed their personal lives beyond what of Tony’s was known to the public, but because he was rich and had a high profile in the tech industry, there was kind of a lot out there.
"Alright." Natasha shrugged, gesturing to her car, which was still running. "I'll take Tony's car back to his house and see if anyone suspicious turns up."
Tony looks away. "Don't be. You've got bigger things to worry about." He pauses, brows furrowing. "What are you going to do here, anyway? You stick out like a sore thumb - Hydra's going to have noticed you're here, especially if they're watching me."
Steve lowers his head onto Tony's shoulder again, snuggling in against Tony's side. They both remain quiet for a moment, then Steve volunteers, "My dad was an alcoholic."
Coulson raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. "As a native Iowan, you run the risk of having your cover blown." He politely refrained from pointing out that he knew that the law enforcement officer who came to deliver the news of Clint's parents' deaths was from Cedar Falls.
That was enough to smooth Tony’s ruffled feathers; Steve got a smile in return. “Sentimental,” Tony accused, teasing, his lips nearly close enough to Steve’s for them to touch.
"Maybe later," Steve agrees. He reaches for Tony's drink - just a glass of seltzer water and lime; Tony swears he's going to treat his liver right this time around - and takes a sip. "The weather's so nice here. I'm going to freeze to death when I get back to New York."
“So,” Tony finally said, “I guess if I can believe you’re a popsicle from nearly a century ago, you can believe I actually saw a glimpse into an alternate reality?”
Steve wakes up with his face mashed against his arm and a fly buzzing somewhere near his ear. He swats ineffectually at it and tries to go back to sleep, but his conscious mind processes a second later
After copying the address onto a new sheet of paper, Steve tucks it into his shirt pocket. He finishes up his search of the remainder of the room and turns up nothing else but a phone book with no pages that seem particularly well-loved or dog-eared.
Ahead of them, Nighthawk ejected himself from the cockpit of his craft and landed with deceptive ease on the windscreen of the jet.
Natasha did, at least, seem determined not to let Steve brood over it much longer. She met him in the kitchen when he returned, handing him first a glass of water - which he chugged down with enthusiasm - then a mug of hot cocoa with two huge marshmallows melting on the surface, which managed to drag a smile out of Steve. Everyone who didn't know her well - which was a lot of people - thought Natasha was just cool and calculating, but she was good at reading people, which actually made her pretty thoughtful and considerate, too.
"When you get a bit of leave and I get a break, I would love to show you my art collection back in New York," Tony says. "I've got quite a few pieces by the masters."
“Yeah.” Tony took a deep breath, and the next words left him nearly in a rush: “I just wanted to tell you that I’m glad we’re all okay. And that we’re together. And - I love you.”
Steve took his time at first, with slow but deep strokes, until he was finally building up a rhythm. He leaned over Tony and pressed kisses at the nape of his neck, nuzzling against the collar of his jacket and his shirt. Tony reached back and threaded his fingers through Steve's hair, pushing back into the motion of each thrust, working himself back onto Steve's cock.
"Geez, I'd think you weren't even excited I came to visit you this afternoon," Steve said. Tony couldn't see it, but he was pretty sure Steve would be wearing a teasing grin right about now.
were based on true events, if sometimes embellished for entertainment value (or toned down to avoid compromising information).
