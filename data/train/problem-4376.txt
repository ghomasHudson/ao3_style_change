SORRY!!!!! I know it's been months. I feel bad. Oops.
sorry guys, I know it's been a while I went to the beach and had no WIFI for the whole of the holidays, but I'm back now.
Castiel was bad, really bad. He hadn't left his bed in a week, cried a lot, and refused to talk unless it was important. His eyes were puffy and red, bloodshot. Dean was still missing.
One he arrived at the high school, Max all but ran to the Ute. “What’s the rush dude?” Dean chuckled as Max slammed the Ute door. “There is this new chick in my class, she just transferred, and she’s hot,” he gushed. The 16-year-old looked really pleased with himself, “…and she came and sat by me in class and then again at lunch.” Dean’s smile was knowing as he grinned at the flustered teen. He distinctly remembered the same sort of feelings himself and grinned, he even told Max as much.
Walking briskly through the door Castile watched as Dean slipped into his little headspace, his features becoming relaxed and calm. Dean looked up at the sound of his door closing seeing his Daddy standing there he wiped his eyes with the backs of his hands scrubbing away the tears.
It seemed as though he couldn’t wait to get out of his adult clothes as they were strewn between the door and his bed.
Gabriel snagged the phone of the bench, holding it between his ear and shoulder. “Unca Gabe,” with those two words Gabe’s full attention was on the phone, “Dean?” on the other end of the line Dean started to cry, loud blubbering sobs full of sorrow.
Dean opened his eyes as Cas walked into the room. He was lying in his cot, in his favourite paw patrol Pj’s on and Lemon in his arms as well as the stuffed rabbit Gabe had given him at some point. Cas reached the cot and hoisted Dean into his arms, the boy’s legs coming to rest around his Daddy’s waist. “Hey, bub. Can’t sleep?”
Castiel could feel the tears sliding silently down his cheeks as they drove after Dean. The shock of what Dean had said was finally sinking in. The words kept echoing through his head. Was he really controlling Dean’s life?
They spent the next few days hanging around the house. Dean managed to stay in a more adult headspace, however, Cas knew that Dean had been pushing back the urge to regress. Which meant that it was only a matter of time.
“Dean you really need to drink more water, especially if you are working” Castiel chastised while stirring one sugar into his coffee. Dean walked towards the sink while unscrewing the lid of his drink bottle to fill it up. “I’m not thirsty Da…Cas,” Dean grumbled.
Dean’s phone started ringing and he looked at it, it was Cas, of course. Picking up the damned device he turned it off, throwing it back onto the bench seat beside him. His eyes flicked up to the mirror and back to the road as he neared the intersection heading into town. Hopefully, the 200-meter gap would put a decent number of cars between him, Cas and Gabe.

Knocking on Cas’ bedroom door he walked inside putting the phone on speaker as he sat down on Castiel’s bed. “Dean, why don't you say hi to Daddy?” Cas gasped at Dean's name and again at Dean's antics on the other end of the line. “Daddy, Daddy, Daddy I miss my daddy! I want my daddy!” spilled from the phone.
One thing that constantly stood out to Sam was the toys that Dean was playing within all the photos. All of them resembled toys that Dean had expressed interest in as a child.  This shocked Sam as most of them were relatively inexpensive and that shocked him as most of the other things Dean had, seemed to be on the pricier side.

Thankfully, there were no issues with landing or moving through customs and baggage claim, and he moved quickly into the arrivals lounge. Cas had said that he would wait there, and then they would travel to Cas’ house. Dean was upset that he couldn’t come to the airport, however, he understood that it might be bad for his and Sam’s reunion to happen in a public place so that he did not regress in an unknown space if that ended up happening.
Cas was shocked, to say the least. Dean had never mentioned having a brother. Dean hadn't really talked about any family members at all. Ever. Back when Cas had first met him, Dean had flinched at a mere question about family, eventually, Cas had stopped asking so he didn't upset the boy.
After no time at all the bottle was empty, but even then, Dean continued to suckle. Cas slipped the bottle from between Dean’s lips and replaced it with one of Dean’s pacifiers, placing the nearly sleeping boy into his crib. Just before leaving, both father and uncle kissed Dean on the head, wishing him a quiet goodnight.
Castiel pulled Sam aside after dinner as he felt that it was best that Sam was aware that Dean would regress soon. Sam looked a little unsure but understanding.

Dean lifted his arms holding them in the direction of his daddy “uppies.” Smiling at his boy Cas bent down and picked up his special baby boy, sighing as Dean wrapped his legs around his daddy’s torso.
For the first time in weeks, Dean felt the need to ‘be big’. He was sitting in the cot looking at the latch that lowered the gate, but he was too tired to move. Just then Gabe strode into the room with a massive grin on his face. He walked over to the cot and dropped the barrier before reaching in and ruffling Dean’s hair. “Hey Gabe”, Dean huffed, this prompted Gabe to smile even wider. “Your back, how are you?’’ Dean yawned and replied while blinking the sleep from his eyes, “good, sleepy.”
p.s. if there are any mistakes blame the fact that it is literally the middle of the night.

Castiel spoke and it took a few moments for Dean to register, “How old are you, baby?” Dean held up three fingers, smiling sweetly. “Fwee Dadda,” Dean then found himself in his daddy's arms face nuzzled in Castiel’s neck. Gabriel walked in just as Dean was being put into a diaper. “Is the little one all right?”
Castiel’s raised voice rang up the stairs “Dean breakfast is ready” Dean stumbled down the stairs in a pair of jeans while holding his shirt, putting it on as he walked into their modern kitchen. Castile chuckled at the sight of Dean's hair sticking up in all directions, wet from his shower.
The door was opened quietly, and Gabe stepped into the room carrying a sleepy baby in a dinosaur onesie, and a bottle of milk.
“Thank you, Clifford, it's the least I can do. Would you like me to go and get Max from school?” Maggie stood and left the room to start the dinner prep, shutting the door leaving the two men to talk. “If you wouldn't mind picking him up, I’ll move the cattle.” Dean agreed and walked outside towards the old beaten up pickup.

The one thing that bugged Sam to no end was the inability to contact the blogger as there was no comment function. The blogger ‘Cas’ said that this was because of hate comments, Sam could understand this but the need to find his brother grew and grew but with no way of contacting this Cas person he was shit outta luck.
Rowena informs him that she doesn't have exact hours, something Castiel resolves to change; random hours will confuse customers, after all. Generally, she opens around ten in the morning and closes at five in the afternoon, taking a lunch break somewhere in between. The store closes early on Sundays and completely on Mondays. Castiel decides that, for the first month or two, anyway, he should be there for all business hours, get a true feel for how things operate, what times are the busiest, and so on. Later on, he'll reduce his workdays to noon through four, per Gabriel's insistence. His brother had been adamant that if Castiel was going to be working, it could only be for so many hours. Gabe is under the impression that once Castiel learns to relax on the beach, he won't want to work.
“I don't understand that reference.”
There's no hesitation when Castiel answers, no doubt in his mind.

Dean's hand stills, his eyes flying open and he pulls his face back to stare at Castiel. “What are you talking about?”

Castiel is beginning to understand why Dean would drop everything and leave New York.
“Dean, this is a menswear fashion show,” he whispers in awe, glancing around as Dean heads for a specific table. Versace, Armani, Valentino...
The man's face falls for a second, but he ramps it back up quickly. “Ah, yes, who
Huh. Well.
,” Dean can't find his words.  They are stuck somewhere deep in his throat, and he swallows hastily before something unfiltered can escape.
The next few hours are considerably dull, for Castiel at least. Dean, on the other hand, is passed around and handed off to countless consultants, and without any argument. Castiel would have a harder time letting people manhandle him in such a way, but Dean plays right along. Models are used to such things, although Dean makes a face when the makeup artist jabs at his eyebrows.
, in his case–and brought it all here.”
Come closing time on Friday, Castiel has convinced himself he's merely still upset over Dean startling him the other day upstairs. He takes out his feelings on the register, slapping the bills harder than usual. Rowena left nearly an hour ago to go get ready, and so Castiel was left to close shop. The front door opens and Castiel swears; he'd shut it but neglected to lock. If he hadn't just closed the register, he'd be happy for the business, but at this point, Castiel is still frustrated for no good reason and just ready to go home. “Sorry, we're closed,” he grounds out to the customer, not sparing them a glance. “We open tomorrow at–”
She gives his clothes a once-over. “Did you get dressed in the dark? They may not even let you in!”
Castiel blushes. “You think so?” he asks shyly.
? Shit, man, where do you get this stuff?”
At night... Trying to forget Dean is an entirely different story. Now that they've kissed, now that Castiel has become personally acquainted with Dean's yielding lips and his wet tongue and his strong thighs, he's taking lengthy showers every night. He feels guilty about wasting so much water, but he'd feel even worse if Mrs. Butters had to launder the bedsheets every day. So he spends his time in the bathroom with indulgence, all of the thoughts he's shut out during the day escaping freely as he thrusts into his fist. In his mind, Dean is the one touching him, sliding fingerpads across Castiel's skin, and he comes in hot spurts across the tub's porcelain, grateful for the spray of the shower head that washes away the evidence.
Dean wipes his mouth with his napkin and takes a sip of his wine to collect his thoughts. He's barely halfway through his first glass while Castiel is already on his second.
steps out onto the runway, Castiel's mouth falls open. Dean looks
Rejection doesn't happen often to Castiel, but it's happened before. He just brushes it off and picks himself back up, finds another willing participant for his bed that night, and never thinks of it again.
“It's not that simple,” Castiel growls for what seems like the tenth time this week alone. “Dean wants a relationship, and I'm leaving at the end of September. Why start something that has an expiration date?”
“'Course, Cas,” Dean replies, ignorant of Castiel's predicament. “Thank you. I appreciate that.”
Castiel's hips stutter into Dean's idle fingers, and suddenly, Dean's withdrawing his hand altogether from Castiel's pants.
“Well alrighty then,” Dean surrenders. “Let's blow this popsicle stand.”
Dean chuckles breathlessly and kisses his cheek. “I
Fergus's yellow eyes gleam in the dark room as Castiel climbs up into the area. The shades have been lowered, unusual since Rowena has so many plants and it's not even two in the afternoon, but the kitchen window allows for enough light that Castiel doesn't feel too weird. Is it ridiculous to think the darkness might have something to do with the demon cat?
The rest of the evening and all of Saturday follow a similar pattern. Castiel opens the shop on time, but he doesn't bother to prop the door open or even switch on the
“What I mean,” Castiel says, rising from the couch, Dean's hand slipping from his shirt. He reaches into his own pocket as he kneels on the floor before Dean.
At least. Not when he can help it. Not since he'd discovered that was

“Slow?” Castiel repeats, sinking back into his own chair.
Castiel wakes to a pounding headache and someone pounding on the front door, the noise banging against his skull even two floors up.
me to leave?” Cas challenges effortlessly, like he'll slip away and never mention this again if that's what Dean wishes.
Dean takes the hand caressing his face and guides it around, pressing a kiss to Castiel's palm.
Then, with a wink in Castiel's directions, he strolls back over to Gabriel with a whistle and thrusts the book into his chest before slipping out the front entrance with little more than a wave.
Castiel nods, recalling the contract Dean mentioned before. It's a shame he's quitting, Castiel will be sorry to see the suits go.
“I want you to come home with me.”
He texts Rowena, asking if Discount Tire is his best bet or if she has a better recommendation. In Chicago, he would have dropped off his car at the dealership, but this isn't Chicago, nor is it a car he's particularly fond of, so a big-name shop should do fine. She responds a few minutes later, replying that
Heat crawls up the back of Dean's neck, and his cheeks flare under Cas's scrutiny.
With a friendship established, Dean drops by the bookstore more often again.
By the time he gets there, Rowena has already unlocked the front door and propped it open, a practice by which she refuses to budge. Although technically her boss, Castiel doesn't desire to get into a fight his first month here, so he allows it. Mollified somewhat by her explanation that, by having the door open, the ocean air helps to actually
“Erm...”
“Och, you know him that well, do you? Think you're so smart,” she laughs bitterly, stalking back to her boxes. “You should give people a chance, Castiel. They might surprise you.”
“Don't get any ideas,” he mutters, debating on whether or not he should actually allow Gabe to run the place for a bit. Deciding it probably won't hurt their sales anyway, he leaves Gabriel to it, shooting one last wary warning at his brother before ascending the stairs.
“I still do not understand why you haven't called him,” Rowena presses yet
Cas doesn't disappoint tonight, inclining his head and popping off with a, “Smoke me a kipper, I'll be back for breakfast.”

Dean studies his face closely.
Castiel's heart swells. He never knew that.
“We can go somewhere else, if you want,” Castiel offers.
, his mind supplies.
“That's a fair observation,” he grants. “I mostly keep to the third floor, though. Mrs. Butters, the housekeeper, takes care of the other two floors.”
“The books?”
Surely, there are many more modeling opportunities in New York than down here.
, something I've never seen. You're watching movies together, and hell, you're even
“Yeah. I know.”
Before Castiel can ask, Dean remarks, “When I said I wanted to go out together, I was thinking more, like, an actual meal, you know?”
The front of the shop is finally resembling something closer to a bookstore than an attic, and although Rowena grumbles about not knowing where anything is anymore, she does admit the place looks more appealing. Castiel privately thinks the entire interior needs a complete face-lift, but the store is nowhere near being ready for that, so he keeps silent on the idea.
sound crazy, Castiel busies himself by tidying up the shelves. He keeps glancing at Dean from the corner of his eye though, watching as the man looks around, twisting on his feet and giving Castiel a perfect view of his well-dressed ass.
“Hnn.”
“That's great,” Castiel replies, uncaring. Whatever. He just wants to go home and crawl into bed. He's probably got a bottle of whiskey stashed somewhere. One bottle won't hurt.
Dean runs a hand through his hair with a sigh. “I'm sorry, too, Cas. I shouldn't have assumed you would stay here just because we were together. And...” He shuffles back and forth. “I shouldn't have accused you of trying to seduce me into moving,” he adds, flushing. “I should have known you wouldn't do something like that, even without knowing of your awful ex. I jumped to conclusions based on past experience.”
Strange, he's never felt bad about that sort of thing before. He chalks it up to sharing a bedroom with Dean while his dick is unattended to. By the time Dean emerges from the bathroom, Castiel is already tucked in. Dean putters around for a few minutes, setting his alarm and checking his phone. The city lights peek through the curtains and illuminate the white tee and maroon boxers Dean wears, yet another image for Castiel to file away for usage later.
The entire building is crawling with tourists and islanders alike, no space for Jesus in between, and Castiel immediately misses the spaciousness of the other location. However, Dean already looks more at ease, leading Castiel inside with a hand at his back, and though the hand is warm, he suppresses a shudder from the touch.
“Yeah, but...” Gabe whistles. “If what you've been texting is true, you've had what, next to nothing since moving here? I don't think you've had this much alcohol at once since... Hell, since you and Balthazar ended years ago!”
Then there are other times that leave Dean more confused, such as when Cas brings a collection of hexed Christmas ornaments over for Sam to lock away in a protected box. He dumps the tin container currently housing the dangerous trinkets into Sam's awaiting arms and marches across the library to where Dean relaxes in an armchair, watching episodes of
Dean's hand slips from his shoulder, smile drooping as the information washes over him. “So soon...?”
“A few days, actually,” Castiel confesses in a hush. “I'm leaving by Friday.”
Ten lengthy and lonely days later, Cas returns to the bunker with a potential case lead.
Then she abruptly hangs up.
know Dean?” he answers mysteriously. “He's around here somewhere, can't get rid of him. I'll help you look!” The man speaks of Dean discourteously, and Castiel immediately decides he doesn't like it. “I'm Aaron, by the way. I was the one in the black Valentino suit.”

“Cas! Been looking all over for–oh.” Dean stops short, glancing at Castiel's conversation partner. His eyes flick over to the hand on Castiel's arm. “Aaron,” he greets stiffly.
Those breathy moans make it extremely difficult for Dean to spend time moving elsewhere, but he eventually pries himself off of Cas, grabbing the angel's wrist and dragging him down the hall towards his bedroom. Well, it's not so much dragging as it is leading, since Cas proves just as eager as Dean.  He shoves Dean against the wall next to the bedroom door.
needs Dean to enjoy this date.
Castiel's first weeks on Galveston Island crawl by like snails.
It takes everything in Castiel's power not to throw himself into Dean's arms one last time. Otherwise, he may never leave.
“Wow, Ro, didn't know you had it in there,” he praises, grinning cheekily.
,” Gabriel reminds, discarding the bottles into the garbage. “You're supposed to be taking care of yourself, baby bro. Not damaging your liver.”
The woman sitting next to Dean is the only one to talk to them throughout the night.
Half an hour later, the Mercedes is parked out front and Jo calls him over to the desk to sign a few forms.
– to do with the way Cas had said
Gabe smiled softly and put his arms around the worried caregiver, he didn't often say it, but he was proud of his brother and the amount he had helped Dean, this was one of those times.
Dean had found a small farm looking for some assistance and had been paying his keep with manual labour and the like. Upon reaching the backdoor to the house Dean shucked off his borrowed gumboots and slipped quietly into the house. Walking down the hall Dean headed to the laundry to wash his hands and remove his overalls. The soap always made him sad, it was the same type that Cas bought, and it was a smell he would always associate with home.
After his talk with Sam, Cas headed upstairs to check on Dean, who had gone up just after dinner. Just as he had suspected Dean had crawled into his bed in the nursery and fallen asleep, with his thumb in his mouth.
Being on a plane heading towards Dean was surreal. After contacting Cas, he had started to have weekly chats with Dean over the phone. The first time that he had talked to ‘little Dean’ had been strange but not too weird, but Sam had had some time to process Dean’s predicament.
Sorry that I haven't posted in a while I procrastinated then got really sick. This chapter is quite short sorry. Hope you enjoy it.
The car pulled to a stop suddenly and Cas flung himself from the car, towards Dean. who was still jumping, and now squealing. Dean was enveloped by Castiel’s arms, and warm safeness wrapped around Dean.  Inhaling, Cas could smell a musk on Dean that wasn't normally there. Dean smelled like sweat, pine trees, and other outdoor smells.
“Cas I love you and so does Dean, without you, Dean would be swamped with emotion and would be unable to care for himself, you have thrown him a lifeline I hope you know that.” Looking at his brother Castiel knew that what Gabe said was the truth. “I love you too,” he replied, tears running down his face.
Castiel flinched as Gabriel laid a hand on his shoulder, giving a reassuring squeeze. “You, my dear brother, need to stop thinking about what he said and concentrate on getting him back home.” Castiel picked up his phone hoping Dean would pick up.
Maggie sounded as though she was trying very hard not to laugh, for fear of upsetting Dean again. Castile cleared his throat before speaking. “Hey baby, Daddy Missed you. Where did you go?”
○•○•○•○•○•○•○•○•○•○•○•○
Castiel frowned suddenly and began to speak, “Dean it's been five days, that's the longest regression in over a year.” Dean looked towards Cas a grim expression on his face “I'm fine Cas, really”. Dean looked down at his half-eaten breakfast to avoid his friend's eyes. Of course, Castiel was more than just a friend he was little Dean's Daddy and caregiver.
WARNING contains non-con
Castiel places the teaspoon into the sink and took Dean by the arm leading him firmly but gently to the stairs, giving him a small nudge towards the bottom step. Dean slumped down with a huff, staring past Castile’s hip into space. Cas looked at Dean for a second and turned to go back into the kitchen.
“So how is Dean?” Gabriel looked at his younger brother, Cas looked back with a grim expression on his face, “He is shutting me out again,” Castiel’s responded, the sigh behind his words audible.
Dean knew that this was going to happen eventually, he had been testing Cas today, not obeying rules, talking back, and ignoring Cas as much as possible. The only reason that Dean had come inside was to get the GPS that he had ordered the other day, to go into the Impala.
Castiel ponders on what to say, thoughts were flooding through his brain. “Dean has never mentioned having a brother,” Cas stated. Sam let out a sigh over the phone and Castiel could tell that he was deeply worried.
this is lemonade Dean's teddy.
What had started this? Castiel wondered as he took a sip of hot sweet coffee. He could hear Dean shuffling around on the stairs, but he ignored it. “Hey, little bro what ya thinking about,” Castiel flinched as his brother stepped into the room thru the side door, bags of groceries in his hands. “Dean’s being a little shit.”
Of course, Cas being Cas, he pronounces the
He lays a palm on Dean's chest to tell him it's all right, and then Castiel turns to Aaron. “If I was looking for a pretty face, I certainly wouldn't be coming to you,” he replies staunchly, and Aaron balks. “Dean is my friend, and we'll be leaving now.” He snarls at Aaron. “And that 'red-haired bimbo' is twice the person you'll ever be.”
“Don't listen to my brother, he already has a copy, several, in fact,” Castiel orders, causing the stranger to laugh again. Gabriel scowls, but before he can edge a word in, Bowed Legs speaks up.
“Don't worry, I'm sure it's wide enough,” Gabriel dismisses, grabbing some bags from his trunk. He pauses to smirk. “Probably.”
The server brings out the drinks, and Castiel says they'll require a few more minutes before ordering. Dean is staring at the menu, but Castiel notices his eyes are glazed, lost in his own thoughts.
“I mean, it's a nice house, from an architectural viewpoint,” Dean tells him as they climb the stairs to the third floor. “But it doesn't really feel like... a
sound like that.”
“I would, and I do,” Castiel announces glowering at the pair of them. “I care for Dean, and I'm here for him. Not to mention... Rowena, Sam, Bobby, Jo, and the numerous other people who care. You're just a manipulative asshole who's still obessed with her ex even though she touts having moved on. I wonder, does your new boyfriend
“You're extremely childish,” Castiel says. “But no matter, I'm going to start reorganizing the store tomorrow.”
“You know I didn't mean it, right, Cas?” Dean asks, pleading. “What I said that day... about you being dead to me.” Dean's eyes are shiny and wet, nostrils twitching as he swallows. “You know I don't mean that, right?”
?” he flirts, practically devouring the stranger with his leer.
He turns at the amount of alarm in Gabe's voice. His brother is taking in the empty bottles by the sink with wide eyes.
Rowena breathes a sigh of relief. “Good. I'm glad to see you've come with confidence because you're going to need it. The dark witch is here, too.”
are that invested in him!”
A terrifying screech is all the warning Castiel gets before there's a heavy weight on his shoulder, tiny claws scratching his chest and forcing their way between him and Dean. He hears Rowena screaming, “Fergus!” and Dean swearing, “Fucking Crowley, what the fuck!” before someone finally pries the insane animal off of him.
“You have nothing to feel sorry for, Dean,” Castiel responds, throwing on his boxers and buttoning up his shirt, and Dean is sure it says something that Cas is choosing to this the human way rather than mojo his clothes back on. Cas drapes the tie around his neck but doesn't bother knotting it.
Castiel shrugs. “Not like I haven't been drunk before.”
“Hi there,” Dean flashes a flirty smile at the concierge. “I need to check in. Reservation for Smith.”
Castiel thinks he might enjoy going backstage at a fashion show. “I'd like to come... if that's okay? They let random people behind the scenes?” That would never fly at the firm; it sounds like a security nightmare.
The image of Dean with a popsicle is too much, and he beats a hasty retreat to his car, the other man laughing at his back. Castiel
“What's kicking, little chicken?”
Dean's brows climb higher. “Probably?” he repeats in disbelief.
, but that can come later, so he obliges Cas's request with pleasure. He cradles the back of Castiel's neck, drawing him in to slot their lips together sweetly. He feels the remaining tension of uncertainly leave Cas's frame as he yields to Dean's touch, tilting his head in that familiar way, only this time it's done, not out of puzzlement, but out of certainty, bettering the angle as his hands grip Dean's forearms, pulling him closer and deepening the kiss.
Upon closer inspection, Castiel recognizes the Scottish Fold breed, unsurprising, and as he inches closer, the black-haired, round-faced feline hisses loudly.
“Dean, what's wrong?”
“Pratchett and Gaiman?” she challenges, sipping her tea.
A petite woman emerges from the doorway, and behind her, Castiel spies a staircase. This must be Ms. MacLeod, the Scottish accent fitting the name. Though she looks tiny and fragile, Castiel immediately senses this is not a woman to cross. Heavy makeup accentuates her face, her red hair piled high atop her head. She looks right at home there in the occult section, with her long dark gown, dangling earrings, and pointy boots.
Currently I am editing my DCBB story, so you all can look forward to that in the coming months!
Castiel smiles deviously. “It might go faster if you stopped staring and started helping.”
Castiel supposes Dean could be referring to a car show, but he already said it isn't for Singer Auto. Just what second job does Dean have? He doesn't get the chance to respond, however, when they pull into a Marriott hotel parking lot. Castiel's jaw drops. He isn't unused to glamor, but he isn't used to pairing glamor with
It's true: Gabe's first encounter with the feline met a bloody end. Fergus got in such a good swipe that they actually had to visit an Urgent Care for stitches.
It's a Monday, so he doesn't have work; the week of Christmas, they will be open the extra day since the bookstore has been busier with all of the holiday shopping, but today he is free. Castiel needs to pick up a few things from the store, though, things for Gabriel's visit and some groceries so he can self-provide while Mrs. Butters is on holiday in Dallas for the next few weeks.
“What!?” Dean looks positively terrified. “You can't be serious.”
. But again, he couldn't fathom being so attached to something that he'd sacrifice his entire livelihood.
“So, anyone want to tell me why Castiel showed up to a swanky event in pjs?” Dean asks, grinning from ear to ear craftily. “I sense a story.”
Would Castiel have been able to handle things as well as Dean or Rowena have?
He's chosen dark pinstripe pants with black shoes for the evening, paired with his deep gray shirt and black jacket. Underneath the blazer, he has a black waistcoat (too much black is never a negative, in Castiel's opinion). A red tie completes the look for just a flash of color. Rowena had nodded approvingly upon opening the door for him, while Meg animatedly licked her lips.
“Let's go somewhere else,” he suggests more strongly. “I don't really know the area, so why don't you pick?”
Hadn't Cas just agreed the sex was great, and now... he was regretting it? He supposes technically Cas had said
Although Gabriel was happy to simply enlist his brother in some sort of long-term resort where he'd never have to lift a finger, Castiel knew he would go stir-crazy without
Dean shoots her a lopsided (and completely unadorable) smile. “I'll be here at five to pick you up.” He pats Fergus's head once more. “Crowley.” He glances over in Castiel's direction. “Cas,” he nods.
Rowena gives his shoulder a squeeze and flaunts a sly grin. “Don't worry, dearie. You leave that part up to me.”
He very nearly chucks it into the bin by the door. But as he twists his hand to flick away the card, Castiel notices something written on the back.
The angel sends him a smoldering look. “I do
her, works with her. Surprisingly, he even likes her. He's not sure he could consciously engage in sexual conduct with her boyfriend, and he already made the astute observation not to get on her bad side.
“For you to leave.”
There's a
“Why would Cas need to get my attention?” he mutters, scowling at the appliance as if it had personally offended him. And in Dean's defense, it
“Uh... right.”
? I don't fall in love; I don't do relationships. People don't want that with me. Dean knows I'm not here forever, so he understands this can't go anywhere. Which means that he, like everyone else, just wants their fill and then they'll move on.”
They, too, are collected and hidden away with the rest.
And as Dean's hands trail over Castiel's body, there's an extra flare of passion in his gut at the twinkling of the silver band, the blue sea glass stones a constant reminder of their love for all the years to come.
“Wait!” calls Dean. Castiel looks back, and Dean is playing with his fingers nervously with a pained grimace.
“Garden Center?” Castiel asks. It seemed an odd shift from gardening to books, but it would explain all of the plants.

No, it doesn't matter. This is about Dean.
“Dude. There's always room for pancakes!”
Castiel's workdays are spent reorganizing the store. After determining that the few customers who
For the first time, Castiel catches sight of the cover.
Cas says nothing else for a while, and Dean is too embarrassed to meet his eyes so he just keeps his gaze focused on the rumpled bedsheets.
Now that Castiel knows Dean and Rowena have some sort of relationship, he predicts it's only a matter of time before they run into each other again.
Dean helps the store, too. It's his idea to invest in a coffee machine, and their profits for April increase nearly thirty percent as a result. Almost every customer buys a cup to-go with their purchase, and with the extra funds, they finally buy a new sign for out front, this one reading
“I think you look downright tasty, Clarence,” says Meg, one of Rowena's friends who is in town for the weekend. She has been stalking Castiel around the store since Wednesday afternoon, dropping heavy hints that she's interested, no matter how many times Castiel tells her he plays for the other team.
, they're an improvement upon his trademark scuffed boots. Black slacks hug his thighs and hips nicely, the material pressed and crisp. He's wearing a dark blazer over a white button-down shirt and–Cas's throat dries–a charcoal pinstripe waistcoat. The top buttons of his shirt are undone, drawing Castiel's eyes again to the smooth expanse of Dean's throat. His face is scruff-free, skin clean of all dirt and grease, and Castiel thinks his jaw might have landed somewhere on the floor.
Well, he has a theory.
“Or what, you'll attack me again?” the woman laughs, cold and chilling, and this must be Amara, Dean's ex-girlfriend. “That didn't work out so well the first time, did it?”
“Wow,” he interrupts with a huff, pushing down a flare of panic. “Who said anything about
“We're at a fashion show, and you're wearing something from, I don't know, Exchange?” he says with dismay.
Castiel doesn't realize how long he's been sitting there crying until he hears the shuffling of feet, the clicking of heels on pavement.
Two empty bottles litter the carpet next to his feet.
She bursts into tears at the sight of them.
“I didn't realize you worked here,” Castiel confesses, cursing Rowena. She set him up on purpose.
Rowena snorts. “I was going to say like a barnacle on the bottom of a boat.”
“What are those?” Cas asks, eyeing the small pan on the back left burner.
If had, he may have been able to put a lid on things before they got out of hand. Dean suspects it all began back when Cas's mind was turning bat-shit crazy and he kept spitting out facts about bees and monkeys, topics far more memorable than any random words of greeting he may or may not have given. Hell, Dean can't recall anything else from that one conversation featuring cat penises; he only wishes he could forget about male cats having thorny dicks, too.
Several people stop him and ask if Castiel himself is a model, and if he's not, he should be, they say. Women and men alike rake appreciative eyes down his tailored navy suit, and he has to fend off several would-be contenders and he makes his way around the party room in search of Dean.
Jo rolls her eyes. “Who do you think?”
told him, but in the mess of this week, Castiel had forgotten. “Erm. You two have fun,” he says, even though he has no idea where they're going and tells himself he's not interested.
Dean jumps at the loud
At some point, Castiel had started stroking his thumb across Dean's palm, and now that he's noticed, he can't find it in him to stop.
“Say, Cas.” Dean shifts until he's sitting more comfortably. “You never did explain why you've been avoiding me.”
He does stick around for dinner, although he doesn't actually eat much. Still, Cas sits at the table with Dean and Sam, listening with rapt attention to Sam's latest research find and smiling when Dean tips the leftovers off Cas's plate and onto his own.
Castiel makes his move, swooping in to grip Dean's shoulder and haul him away from both of them, pressing the man to his side and backing into the light of the party. Dean fights at first, but he goes limp at the sight of Castiel, eyes wide and awed. Amara and her beau have black looks on their faces, mixed with bewilderment at the sudden newcomer.
“Huh?” is the eloquent reply the man offers.
“Castiel Novak,” he says with a sharp nod, arms stiff at his sides. He's not sure what a 'grand moff' describes, but it sounds insulting. Nor does he want to guess where the stranger's hands have been, and they look filthy.
?” Dean yelps, eyes bright and beseeching. “No, Cas, I would never–I could never do that to someone. I took care of your car because despite us getting off on the wrong foot and your general displeased disposition, I like you and wanted to do something nice, with it being the holidays and all.”
He turns back to Dean, whose eyes are hopeful and teasing, bursting blues and reds and greens dancing across his face. He's beautiful, and Castiel is stunned. Dean is handsome to be sure, but never has Castiel thought someone
Castiel invites him up to the front door. “I pay for the upkeep in exchange for room and board,” he reveals, unlocking the door.
. Nothing between them has ever been trivial.
Dean is quiet for far too long that Castiel assumes he's fallen asleep, so Dean's voice startles him. “I'm really not,” Castiel hears him whisper.
The event looks smaller than the one Castiel attended before, with only two brands featured on the signage. He pushes his way through the throngs of people, glancing around in every direction for a glimpse of Dean.
Over half an hour later, Castiel is back on the road thanks to the help of a good samaritan. He's not exactly late, not yet, but he's pushing it. His clothes, however, emerged from the tire change worse for wear. When he pulls off the freeway for gas, he stuffs the grease-stained clothes into the trunk and throws on hastily-grabbed things from his duffel, a pair of lounge pants, a tee, and a maroon hoodie. He doesn't have enough time to change again, although he has a feeling he'll regret showing up to a fashion show in sweats.
“Well, you still got a few weeks left, right?” Dean buoys, clapping him on the shoulder, and Castiel soaks in the brief warmth.
the electricity bill, Rowena tries not to run the A/C often, and has instead set up several fans around the shop. Summer months, she tells him, yes, she runs the bloody thing all day. But once October settles in and the air is slightly cooler (though still warm by Castiel's standards), she opts to save money.
“So why quit?”
Versace is fourth to show, and when Dean
Castiel frowns. “You picked her up from here and went out for the weekend. You were...” He blushes and prays Dean can't see it in the glow of fireworks. “You were wearing a suit.”

until he's getting out of his car at the closest Target parking lot. Castiel swipes the little card from where it had been tucked behind the mirror on the visor. Squinting, he recognizes the Singer Auto logo and figures they must leave their business cards. A bit wasteful, in Castiel's opinion, leaving it where someone may not notice, and even if they do, there's a good chance it will go straight into the garbage can.
Gabriel parks on the street and pays the meter. “I should have known you'd pick a bookstore. You always were a fan reader.”
“You clean up nicely,” he says instead.
Sam looked to Cas, and they shared a look. Surprisingly Cas could see understanding and acceptance in Sam’s eyes. Cas got up and headed to the stairway to see what his boy needed.

Dean was also inhaling Castiel’s scent, nose and face pressed into Cas’ neck. Suddenly both Dean and Cas were enveloped by Gabe’s arms, Gabe held them tight pushing Dean and Cas closer together. When Gabe and Cas finally pulled away Dean had tears running down his face in silent streams. “I promise… to never.. runaway... again,” Dean cried. Cas pulled Dean back into his arms while whispering sweet nothings into the blondes’ ear.

Gabe spoke first, “Hi we were wondering if we could book two rooms for tonight?” Kate, according to her name tag, looked back to the computer screen before looking back up. “What are you looking for? I can give you two standard rooms, bed, and kitchenette for 140 dollars a night, for both.
Later at the dining table, Dean and Gabe chatted while Cas slaved over the stove, the smell of Smokey bacon and hash browns filled the kitchen. They discussed plans for the day, and it was decided that all three men would go for a picnic at the nearby lake. After breakfast Cas and Dean were put in charge of making the lunch while Gabe went out and grabbed some items from the grocery store. When Gabe returned the picnic-basket was packed and sitting on the kitchen counter.
That night in bed, Cas couldn’t sleep. He had been thinking about what Sam had told him about his dad, about how they were treated as children. About how Dean had looked after Sam as a child. Suddenly, it was all too much for him. Leaping out of bed Cas threw a robe on and left his room, heading for Dean’s.
They made it to the car where Cas deposited Sam’s bag in the back seat of the car. They then made the thirty-minute drive to the house. Dean was standing outside the door when they pulled up, meaning that he was instantly in Sam’s arms.

“Why do you keep calling me that?” he asks, following as Dean makes note of the tires.

Cas squints and tilt his head, like he's not sure he heard Dean correctly. At last, he sighs and looks away.
Castiel wants
“You mentioned Sam lives in California?”
It's definitely a good sign.
But Rowena shakes her head. “No,” she replies darkly. “She attacked
“Oh.”
Sam is out for his morning run, and Dean is making breakfast, skillfully flipping pancakes over the griddle when Cas finally shows his face again. It's been a few days since his last appearance, unusual since he's been dropping in more often than not lately, but he isn't harried or injured, so Dean doesn't wait for an explanation.
Rowena clearly worked hard to get where she'd been; how did she just abandon it all to come run a failing bookstore left to her by her father? Castiel can't comprehend it. He'd been forced into a year of 'taking it easy' by his doctor and Gabriel, and he'd nearly had an aneurism leaving Chicago. He can't imagine giving up his lifestyle permanently, to come do something as mediocre as
Castiel can make a cup of coffee; he's been doing it for the last twenty-something years. What he cannot seem to do, however, is make a latte, or anything other than black.
Castiel is spared a response when Rowena emerges from the stairs. She looks exceptionally stunning in a midnight blue gown with a high neckline and plunging back. Her hair, usually held up during the workday, tumbles down her shoulders in waves. If he were into women, Castiel suspects he'd be drooling over her the way Dean's starting to.
! You seriously think that wasn't the truth? Do you really think he wants you checking in on him so often?” As Castiel tiptoes closer, the figures come into view. Dean has his back against the wall facing down Amara and another, a tall, dark-haired man. Amara is sultry and gorgeous, and Castiel suddenly remembers why her name sounded familiar: the story made national headlines, Victoria's Secret model abused by boyfriend. Castiel never read those sorts of pieces, so he hadn't known Dean was the accused. It's no wonder Dean was so hesitant to share his past; the majority of the press and people alike had been on Amara's side.
“Or sooner,” Castiel clarifies dejectedly. “Whenever Gabe can get here. But don't worry, I'm not selling the shop, just leaving it in Rowena's capable hands.”
“Lucky for me you're here, then,” he replies, wetting his dry lips in anticipation. Dean's eyes track the movement, and Castiel leans in, nothing weighing his conscious down now.
To Dean, he quips, “What's shaking, eggs and bacon?”
“Dean.”
“Aye, just like that.”
Dean grins. “Well then, come on up!” Fergus screeches unpleasantly, but Dean merely picks him up and disappears back up the stairs. “Get up here, Cas!”
“Erm, Dean,” he whispers as his date buckles in, “why does your uncle have a gun?”
“Rowena told me a bit,” he admits, and Dean glances back at him. “Not a lot, just enough for me to understand what you've been through. I'm sorry you ever had to go through any of that. I would never want to pressure you into anything you aren't comfortable with.”
“I got the address from Gabe,” Rowena replies, licking her spoon.
🐝🍯🐝🍯🐝🍯🐝🍯🐝🍯🐝
and all, making the line sound less like a flirtation, and more like a bad attempt at understanding humanity.
He begins to form a plan.
His humor soon fades, however, as his mind returns to Cas's imminent departure. He wonders what line the angel will offer up tonight. Dean hopes it will be funny enough to distract him from the sight of Cas's retreating back.
Wary of what he might find inside, Castiel leads the way into the bookshop.
“No, I mean,” he gasps when Dean shifts his hand, “I mean... I need you... I need you to come back with me. To Chicago.”
“Err.” Castiel pulls two beers out of the fridge and offers one to Dean, who accepts it distractedly. “I bought the home, actually.”
“Or a weed on the sidewalk.”
Dean pants into the kiss, pressing Castiel's body as close as possible as his own hand scrambles beneath Castiel's boxers. Dean's name is a prayer on his tongue in between kisses, and Castiel doesn't think he's ever felt so cared for. No one has ever treated him the way Dean does. He never realized he was missing something from life until Dean pushed his way in.
Dean sighs, seemingly frustrated. “Let's just get this over with,” he groans in resignation, the door banging shut behind them.

be Mrs. Butters,” Gabriel charms, stepping forward to kiss her hand. “You must be her daughter.”
Gabriel grins. “I wanted to surprise you. Figured since you can't pass the holidays like we normally would, I'd spend a few extra days down here. Gotta say, wasn't expecting to find you hungover and skipping work.”
MacLeod's is only a twenty-minute drive, over in the Historic District. It isn't located on the famous Strand, rather a few streets over, but Gabriel claims it sees a decent amount of business during the summer months, according to the former owner. Castiel's year-long project will be to save this business from going under, and while it may sound like a stressful undertaking, Castiel and Gabriel both know that, if Castiel does find himself stressed and all else fails, they can just write a check.
“And why do you think that is? Because he doesn't want you, Dean. You're not worth it. You're nothing, less than nothing actually. Everyone you care about leaves. But I didn't, did I? I wanted to spend every moment with you, Dean, and look how you repaid me. Well, I've got a new man now, and you can't have me back. Not even if you beg. So tell me, Dean,” Amara drones wickedly, “just
“Is Sam your cat?” Castiel asks, following the conversation.
“Ah, yeah... Couldn't get one since I didn't exactly have proof she was harassing me, so instead, I moved. I try to stick to the Texas circuit these days, though she still shows up from time to time. Redid my contract to end it after this year. Would have quit sooner but Sam's still finishing school and we need the money.”
“My condolences,” Castiel offers, still unaware of social conventions and what he should or should not be saying.
“Love, peace, and chicken grease,” Cas salutes affectionately, and then he's gone.
“The first one, when you pushed me into the waves and kissed me even though you tasted like seawater.”
“Sounds romantic,” Dean replies sarcastically, freeing the top few buttons of Castiel's shirt. “What about it?”
Dean hands off the still-attacking cat to Rowena, earning a few scratches of his own, and then Dean's at his side, checking over Castiel with worry. “Shit, he got you pretty good,” he says, examining Castiel's chest that is covered in red, angry marks. “I don't think you'll need stitches, but two of these could use a bandaid.”
“I wasn't worried about that,” Dean assures quickly. “But, Cas... Are you okay with this?”
“No shit?” Dean's mouth drops open as he stares at Castiel. “No way. Castiel Novak... of

“First aid kit is in the bathroom upstairs,” Rowena offers, wrestling the cat at this point to keep him from escaping. She's able to shoot them a sly grin over Fergus. “You boys better grab some protection while you're there, seeing as you were about to sully the store.”
“Excuse me?” Castiel is at a loss. His car is very valuable, new, and has all the latest features, but Dean's acting as if he drives one of the hunks of junk from the salvage yard.
“So you were,” he replies noncommittally, eyes still searching for Dean.
“Personally,” Dean informs him, leisurely approaching while still keeping himself between Castiel and the door, “I think you should finish what you started.”
from spending a year away, not continue.
And Cas is patient, not recoiling in the slightest when Dean's fingers press hard enough to bruise.
Castiel doesn't see how a vacation here will improve his health, but Gabriel threatened to tell the CEO of Novak Corporation the full results of his health screening, which they both knew would lead to termination. The CEO, their mother, had actually fired her own husband after the man suffered a stroke. She is a tough businesswoman, but she cares about her family's health more. And Castiel really doesn't want to lose his job and the six figures a year that come with it, so he and Gabriel only mentioned that Castiel had been feeling a bit stressed as of late, and their mother agreed to the vacation immediately.
But Cas just sees right through him, as always.
“You're a student?” Castiel inquires. He'd assumed they were around the same age, and Castiel had finished college over a decade ago.
They spend almost thirty minutes arguing with security for Castiel's clearance badge, and Dean is running late. Dean is still insisting Castiel can do his own thing, but now that he's committed, Castiel refuses to back down. He's very good at getting his employees to do what he wants, so it's no surprise when Castiel wears down the security guard into handing over Rowena MacLeod's badge. Dean apologizes over and over, explaining how he'd already submitted Rowena's name before confirming she could go, and how it was his fault Castiel was stuck on a trip he didn't ask for.
“Of course not, Dean, I just want to take care of you,” he argues, heart clenching at the betrayed look on Dean's face. Why doesn't Dean understand that Castiel just wants to make him happy?
“Laugh it up,” he grumbles, but it's said halfheartedly. “I don't understand why... this is... so... difficult...” With each struggle, he grunts and becomes more aggressive with his movements. So much so, that he grabs one part a little too forcefully, breaking it clean off.
Castiel supposed he shouldn't blame her too much; the place had belonged to her
“What a view. You must come up here often,” Castiel says. He's not quite sure what to do with himself. He had sort of hoped Dean would snub him after Castiel never called. But he's also relieved, soaking in Dean's presence. Tonight he's wearing a flannel shirt and jeans. Although the jeans are tattered and old, at least the rest of him is fairly clean. Castiel prefers him like this, when he can stare at Dean's freckles uncovered.
Keeping his eyes mostly on the food, Dean raises one hand with a wave before Cas can start in with his latest, and Dean calls out cheerily, “What's buzzing, honeybee?”
“Yeah, but...” Aaron stutters petulantly. “I thought you were just looking for a pretty face to fuck.”
Turning his head marginally, Dean finds Cas staring intently at the pan of herring. If the angel wasn't resting his chin against Dean, he imagines Cas would have his head cocked in that adorably befuddled manner.
which follows this greeting, and he quickly abandons the pancakes in favor of looking over to see if Cas is okay.
in the same sentence, practically purring them with that gruff voice. Dean hasn't thought about it until now, but that is definitely a scene straight from one his late night fantasies.
“I hope you like tea,” comes Rowena's voice from across the room where the living area extends to a cozy kitchenette. “It's all I have.”
Dean has a stocking... Does he live here? Castiel had previously inferred that while Dean comes over often, he lives elsewhere. But looking at the fireplace now, he thinks perhaps he has been incorrect. And Samuel... Is this the same 'Sam' Dean referred to before when Castiel had eavesdropped?
“He doesn't hate wealth, but there are people in Dean's past who've hurt him, and he associates money with them. One person, really, his ex-girlfriend, a woman named Amara.”
Castiel doesn't ask who Dean is. He's not interested, nor is he proficient in 'small talk' and doesn't wish to attempt improvements now. He can't seem to push away his curiosity completely, though. “Crowley?” he inquires.
“Oh.” Castiel's voice is thick and rough, and Dean can't help grinding his hips at the sound of it. “
Yes, right... Castiel flounders for a response, but Rowena laughs him off.
“I sold my penthouse. I left my career and Chicago. None of it made me happy.” His hands cup Dean's elbows. “
when Rowena pops back to mind.
He wraps his arms around his knees and buries his face into his lap. Castiel will never see Dean again, not after that. Tears spill across his skin as he thinks over his words, thinks over Dean's words, and realizes he made some terrible assumptions.
Closing his eyes, Dean runs one hand down the side of his face, pointing the other at Sam.
Gabe smirks, because while he does care about his brother's well-being, he's also an older brother who loves to dish out shit. “Half-past noon, Cassie! You've been dead to the world for a while, it seems. Rowena mentioned she couldn't get a hold of you when I dropped by, so I figured I'd check here next.”
🐝🍯🐝🍯🐝🍯🐝🍯🐝🍯🐝
“Fun,” Dean echoes, his smile slipping. “Right.”
“Stop while you're ahead,” she advises. Her attention drifts to the book Gabe is still holding. “In need of Jesus? I'll say.”
Castiel takes Dean out to dinner the first week of May.
And what the fuck is Dean supposed to say to
is talking.
Dean's face colors as he takes in Castiel and his suit, and he casts his eyes to the ground with a shy, little smile that is possibly the most adorable thing Castiel has ever witnessed.
“You leave Rowena out of this,” Dean's voice responds, Castiel's heart soaring, and he can just make out the shapes of three people in a secluded corner.
Castiel has gone back to running the bookstore, acting as the manager with Kevin and a few others as part-timers. Rowena still helps out every now and then, but she's usually busy running the new gardening center next door. When the little candle shop had gone out of business, Castiel and Gabe both helped her secure the space, transforming it into a one-stop-shop for all the gardening anyone could ever need. Crowley seems to love the new space, and he can often be found dozing under the warm lights next to the plants.
“Och, that stubborn ass?” Rowena drawls. “He won't come out of his room; Bobby called me and asked if I knew anything, so I came to check in with you. Dean won't come out of that house until he's good and ready, and you looked like you could use a friend.”
Dean leads them back out into the hotel and across a skyway to the convention center across the street. Castiel is taken aback at the sight of hundreds of well-dressed attendees. Some have cheap suits like Dean, but most are wearing high-end brands. Castiel could almost believe he was back home at a bank reception. He feels all but embarrassed to be seen with Dean in his lesser threads, but at least no one here knows him; perhaps he shouldn't have worn his
The man looks up like a deer in the headlights, he'd been so far in his own head.
Dean's face closes off, jaw clenching. “I'm sorry you feel that way.” He stands abruptly and heads for the trapdoor. “My apologies then, Castiel, for wasting your time.”
Castiel narrows his gaze. “You didn't.”
. It's all for show, you know? And you said you can't even alter it. That's pretty restrictive.”
Sam could now see why Dean absolutely loved hugs form Cas, as it really was the best damn thing. It was warm and inviting and absolutely everything that Sam needed at that moment.
You lucky fuckers. sorry, it's been so long, life got in the way. I know it's not long but its something, right?
Castiel’s eyes sparkled with love as he placed his baby boy in his highchair, snapping the tray into place, he turned to start making breakfast. While his back was turned Dean became more alert, slowly gaining more cognitive ability. “I’m back Cas,” Dean said, giving the blue-eyed man a fright.
The boys had a lovely afternoon sitting on the picnic blanket and chatting about all the things that Dean had missed while in his little mindset. Dean was lounging on his back with his head in Cas’ lap. The open affection from Dean, really showed Cas how unsure Dean was.
He spent most nights Cas’ bed snuggled up to his Daddy's side. During the week, Gabe noticed how clingy Dean was, not that he wasn't snuggly normally. The blonde boy slept heaps, waking only to eat and have cuddles with Daddy and Uncle Gabe.

Holding one of the two handles loosely he took a short drink. Why on earth did Cas make him use a Sippy cup in the garage, while he was big? Wasn't it to do with breakages or something? Who cared anyway?
Upon entering the lounge, he saw Cas, he was wearing his signature trench coat, something that had become a bit of a joke between him and Dean. When he saw Sam, he stood and made his way towards the taller man. When the two were face to face, there was a small moment where they both stood awkwardly, before Castiel enveloped Sam in a hug.

But the little pink stuffie was back where she belonged, in the arms of one Dean Winchester. Dean had nearly cried in relief upon seeing the teddy, tears welling in his eyes, as he reached to take her from Gabe’s hand.

Gabe got out his cell phone and opened google looking for a place for them to stay. “There is a small place just inside the township that looks alright or there is another place but that looks a bit…” he trailed off. “The Damon inn it is. You can’t book online so we may have to stop in there on the way and book a room.” Cas nodded in agreement, sending his brother a smile.
When Dean became aware of Gabe’s phone he glowered and covered his face with both hands, accidentally making himself even cuter. This prompted Gabe to take even more photos. “Unca Gabe, stop it, wanna sleep!”

“Why have you only just contacted me?” Cas asked perplexed. “I’ve been looking for Dean since he went missing but I have only just found your contact,” Sam replied with a sigh. There was a long pause and neither of the men spoke.
In bed that night Sam had been unable to sleep thinking of the boy in the green dinosaur suit. At three AM he had given up on trying to sleep, getting out is laptop he tried to finish one of his assignments. This plan had not worked, however, and he found himself back on the blog. This is when he truly found out that the little boy was in fact, Dean.
Suddenly Dean asked, “How did Sammy find us?”
Dean has a bad dream. Daddy is there to help.

His hands were gripping my thighs, hard. I cried out, unable to move or fight. I know what is going to happen, yet I have no power, no strength. The blond man is stronger than I'll ever be, there is no way that I will be able to get away from him.

Eventually, they broke apart, only to see that Cas had his phone out and was filming them. This made Dean laugh, which in turn made Sam laugh. After breaking apart they all headed into the house.
So, Gabe told Dean of the blog and how Sam had stumbled across it. He then explained the almost ritualistic ‘manhunt’ for information that Sam had led to try and find Dean. At hearing this Dean burst into pearls of laughter, which resulted in tears streaking down his face. Cas was pleased to see the utter joy on his charge’s face.
The mug of coffee was warm in Castiel's hands, the bittersweet liquid helping Castiel wake. A distorted sneeze, through the monitor, brought Cas back to the real world, his baby was awake. Pulling back the blankets Cas left his warm bed for the second time that morning.

Gabe’s POV
Walking into the kitchen he greeted Caroline with a small smile, “hey little miss where's mum at?” The five-year-old smiled, “mama is in the lounge.” Dean smiled in thanks and walked into the lounge. Maggie was folding laundry and placing it into piles, one for Dean, one for each of the children and one for Clifford and herself. Just then Clifford walked in and clapped Dean on the back, “mighty fine job you’ve done in that barn ma boy,” he said jovially.
Dean smiled almost constantly during dinner, causing him to spill fried rice onto Daddy’s lap. Because their room at the Damon inn had no microwave, Gabe heated Dean’s milk in a pot on the stove. Dean looked on wide-eyed at the stove and pot. After decanting the milk into a bottle Gabe passed the bottle over to Cas.
Castile couldn't sleep, not with his baby gone. Gabe had been so helpful, cooking dinner and doing dishes while looking after Castile. Castiel felt useless but he had cleaned Dean’s room and nursery just to distract himself, letting the tears fall freely.
Castiel’s eyes shot open. The baby monitor relaying the sounds coming from Dean's bedroom told Cas that Dean was whimpering and by the sounds of things he was writhing in his bed. Shit, Dean was in trouble. Castile leapt out of his own bed and ran down the hall. As Cas approached the door, he heard Dean wake with a gasping cry.
Castile got out of the car walking around the back of the car to reach Dean who was sitting in the back seat. Strapped safely in his booster seat. The boy looked up sleepily, smiling at his Daddy then staring out the open car door, looking towards the house with longing.
Gabriel was surprised to hear a woman shushing Dean. “Hello, my name is Maggie, I'm not sure who you are but I'm assuming you know Dean,” she spoke just loud enough to be Heard over Dean's whimpering. Gabe took a deep breath, “yes, I am Dean's uncle.” The sniffles on the other end of the line where slowly becoming quieter. “We met Dean six weeks ago and he has been staying with us. Since then he's has cried almost every night and I have been very worried about him. I’m not entirely sure what happens to Dean, it’s like his mind shuts down,” she explained.
“Well do that” Cas said nodding as he pulled notes from his brown, leather wallet.

Dean was snuggled in Castile’s arms. They were back at the Damon inn; Gabe had gone into the small town in search of food (and milk). The boy had been quiet for a while, not asleep but thinking, if the look on his face said anything.

Unfortunately, these tears soon became those of sadness at the thoughts of how he had abandoned Sam. Dean clung to both Gabe and Cas for support, and while he did not slip into a little headspace, he was very subdued for the rest of the day. Even taking a nap in the couch in front of a shitty rom-com.
Cas took a few more steps and lowered the side of Dean's crib. “Can't find paci Caddy” Dean grumbled. Dean watched as his daddy moved the blankets in his crib pulling them down to expose a full body of fuzzy baby blue and a bright pink and blue pacifier. “Here you go baby,” Cas said while placing the Pacifier into his baby boy's open mouth.
Gabe made his way over to the armchair, bubba snuggled in his arms, head buried into his uncle’s neck. He looked almost asleep but not quite. Cas looked at his baby with concern, the boy was pale and was drooped over Gabe, clinging tight.
In the kitchen downstairs Gabe was putting together a small meal for both himself and his brother. Gabe looked up at the sound of his phone vibrating on the marble kitchen bench, unknown number.
He put the car in gear and drove back to the main road turning left, heading towards home. Or at least it used to be home. There was an ache in his chest as he drove past his road, continuing out of town. Reaching forward Dean fiddled with the dial on his radio trying to find some decent music to distract him from the turmoil he was feeling.
Sleepily, he replied, “Na uh, Daddy.”
Dean's thoughts were interrupted by the doorbell. Not many people visited so it was either Uncle Gabe or Bobby. Dean hoped of his barstool and walked to the door. The large door opened to reveal Gabriel. Gabe smiled and pulled Dean, his favourite and only nephew, into his arms. Dean hugged back, enjoying the human contact.
Cas took the bottle that was being offered to him, to give to Dean. Dean latched onto the nipple of the bottle as if his life depended on it, suckling the warm sweet liquid into his mouth with gusto. Dean looked up at his Daddy, smiling around the bottle's nipple.
“Hi Dean, it’s nice to see I have you back” he chuckled as Dean detached the tray that kept baby Dean in place. Dean sighed as his onesie encased feet touched the ground. “I’m going to change, is that ok?” Castiel looked up from the scrambled eggs giving Dean the ‘you know the answer to that questioning’ look. Dean was out the door and down the hall in seconds rushing to his bedroom, chucking his paci into his nursery on the way past.
Sam could not believe that after years of looking for his brother he had finally found him and was able to hug him. Dean’s hug was better than Cas’, being able to hold Dean was the best.
“Dean this is not acceptable, this is the fourth time today that you have disobeyed the rules and it will not be happening again, you are going to sit on the stairs and have a think young man.”
“Dean, you have mail,” Cas called from outside the garage which was odd as Castiel didn’t often bother him while he was working in the garage. Over mail no less, really? With a sigh, Dean put down his oily cloth and reached for his water bottle.
“I wouldn’t have pictured that as something you would read.” Cas laughed.
Cas walked over to the couch and sat down placing Dean on his lap. Dean’s heads fell onto his Daddy’s shoulder and his thumb slowly migrated to his mouth. As all parents seem to do, Castiel produced a paci from nowhere and placed it into Dean’s mouth after removing his thumb. Over the years that Dean had lived with Cas, he had noticed that Dean always sucked his thumb very aggressively. Cas had found it strange at first, but he had taken to always carrying a pacifier on him always.
“Sorry Sam, I didn’t think that Dean would like to hear your name, even while regressed.” Cas frowned. Castiel could hear Sam shuffling around on the other end of the phone, “No problem, could you tell me about his,” he paused, “… regressions,” he asked sounding uncomfortable.
He deletes the text, but he can't seem to exit the draft still directed at Dean's number. His glass is empty again, so Castiel takes a long pull straight from the bottle, enjoying the burn in his throat.
Castiel ignores the way his heart hammers in his chest at their close proximity. “Yes. Now I don't have to tell Rowena you're cheating on her.”
There's definitely a bigger story behind it, but Castiel can sense Dean is already exhausted from their current discussion. The fact that Dean told him all he did is a huge step in trust in Castiel's opinion. As for Sam's tuition, if Castiel gets his way, the Winchesters will never want for money again.
Not that he ever plans to return here, of course. Gabe had been thinking of himself when he mentioned the words 'vacation home.'
“Do you
Castiel blinks. “Just like that?”
There's a loud rumble outside, Rowena muttering about 'that infernal car,' and Castiel really hopes that means Dean is here.
“But Dean–!”
No one has ever looked at Castiel in such a way before. Maybe he's been wrong about Dean all along, maybe Dean's interest is genuine. It makes him feel... He can't fight the rush of heat rising to his cheeks. It makes him feel exceptional.
Cas doesn't stay, and although Dean feels that pull, something that plucks inside whenever Cas departs, Dean doesn't ask him to either.  He just walks Cas to the front door where he can disappear freely outside the building's warding.
. Knows that no one could ever mean as much to him as Castiel, not romantically. And while Dean isn't ready to unpack all of his feelings and swap girly moments with Sam, he
“I remember you telling Sam a bunch of lies,” Dean replies hard.
Castiel is anything but social. Events at the firm are ten times as crowded as the bookstore tonight, but it's easier to ignore employees talking business than it is for Castiel to brush off the customers trying to ask about his personal life. He keeps an eye out for Dean, but several hours pass without any sign of him. To his horror, Jo from Singer Auto finds him and asks if Castiel has met Dean's baby yet.
Obviously, this is
Fergus, sitting higher than normal on a large pillow, hisses a warning as Castiel makes his way to the kitchen. He retrieves his lunch bag, the fridge door closing with a thud. He's almost back at the stairs when he hears a muttered, “Damn.”
“Dean,” Cas huffs, melting into Dean's touch as he kisses his way down. “I do
Something flickers at the back of Castiel's memory, the name sounding familiar.
“And, erm,” Castiel adds, “I thought maybe you were trying to buy me.”
Castiel is still on his leather couch in the living room of his penthouse, completely and utterly alone.
Dean tries to hide his irritation under nonchalance. “Meaning what, Sammy?” He fails, of course.
“Which day?” Dean continues his worship of Castiel's skin, fingerpads and tongue tracing every inch they can find.
Then again, it's never been Castiel.
.” Done with her, Castiel finishes the last of his drink and joins the queue waiting to be seated.
“Why do you think he picked such a far away school?” Amara goes on. “Why do you think he left, Dean? Because no one wants you.”
“Whoa.” Castiel glances over his shoulder to see Dean's eyes wide with childlike wonder. “Your housekeeper is the pancake lady!?”
“Dude, I haven't seen you in weeks, since you called in sick,” Dean says, sliding down to sit properly on the stairs. “Did you catch the flu or something?”
“Any reason you're being incredibly fucking cryptic?” Castiel inquires with growing vexation.
“Huh? Oh, you mean Cas? Castiel is kinda a lot, don't you think?”
,” he summarizes, not wanting to detail their breakup, and Dean makes a face of understanding, “I figured... why delay it?”
he's not quite ready to name, he has no idea what to do with them. Past experiences dictate that he should ignore them, sweep everything under the rug and pretend nothing ever happened, chalk up Cas's behavior as little more than an oddity. But that, he knows, would be a disservice to Cas. Castiel doesn't speak without meaning to, he wouldn't yank Dean's chain for kicks. These encounters, however frivolous they may seem, surely have merit to Cas.
Winchester, and he'd certainly never imagined the man looking like
Thank you to everyone who reads, kudos, and comments.  I really enjoyed writing this, and writing from Castiel's POV was a nice change (I tend to favor writing Dean).  It is romantic and sappy, which is exactly what I needed in between working on my heavier, darker DCBB.  This was very different for me, writing the entire story before posting any of it.  However, I think these challenges are good, as they force me to finish in a timely manner.
They wake up at five to shower, eat breakfast, and dress. Although pressed for time, Castiel manages to take care of business, even if it means Dean hears muffled noises from beyond the bathroom door and bangs on it to ask if he's okay. Dean's dubious expression when Castiel leaves the bathroom looking far too satisfied is a necessary price to pay to ensure Castiel can survive the next twelve to twenty-four hours without a raging hard-on. They eat a quick room service meal Dean ordered of eggs and bacon, though Dean wolfs down more bacon than egg.
The housekeeping cook really sealed the deal. Gabriel banned Castiel from every kitchen in every state after the Scrambled Eggs Fire of '89.

is why Dean's always dirty. He's not slovenly, he's a
These days, Cas strolls into the bunker's kitchen while Dean is preparing dinner, nothing too fancy just steak and potatoes, but Cas slides his hips right alongside Dean's in front of the stove and says, “What's cooking, good-looking?”
While Castiel thinks it's probably true, he doesn't understand how Gabriel could know such a thing. He says as much.
, and Castiel feels a hint of pride as he admires the deep flush to Dean's skin and the faint mark on his neck. He quite prefers Dean's skin marred with bites than automotive oil. He looks down to find himself practically straddling Dean's waist, Dean's hands resting upon his hips, and he's fairly confident Dean can feel the press of his erection through their pants.
Dean is right; how could Castiel not stop to consider that perhaps Dean wouldn't
“They have food,” Castiel points out, looking at the flatbread section of his own menu. “I suppose it's more selective than other places, but the online reviews were full of praise.”
The kindness in that question breaks the pieces Dean has been holding together, and they come out in one hushed, quick breath.
“Well,” he continues, nerves acting up even though he's fairly confident, “I hope you don't mind that I took the liberty of... having it altered.”
Dean sloshes water all over himself at the sudden greeting, watering can clattering against the tile where he drops it. “Damn it, Cas!” But he's avoiding Castiel's gaze. “Rowena sent you up here, huh? Wants us to talk it out and whatnot?”
“Dean,” he says, and Dean shudders at the implications behind that one word, his name, how Cas always speaks Dean's name with such reverence. A warm hand slips under the covers to find Dean's thigh, the other pressing a thumb against Dean's lips.
. He was content in that stuffy house, working at an old bookshop for a fraction of his usual wages. He'd never enjoyed anything more than spending time with Rowena and Dean, especially Dean. He'd never cared for anyone so much, how could he have ever pictured life without him?
Gabe merely wiggles his brows. “I know wood stiffer–”
They don't always go out, though. Sometimes, they hang out in MacLeod's after hours, tucked into opposite ends of the couch in the secondhand section, knees folded and socked feet touching in the middle while they read individual books. Castiel pours through Vonnegut novels while Dean studies his mechanical engineering textbook, having explained he takes one online course a semester for certification in automotive restoration. It's quiet and not at all sexy, but it's an easy silence between two people who share a more profound bond, and Castiel thinks he wouldn't prefer it any other way.

He smiles, eyes crinkling as he blushes. “I could never forget. It was as blue as your eyes.”

before yanking it from the shelf. He settles onto the couch, and, with a deep breath, he opens the book and begins reading.
new look?”
“What does Rowena normally do?” he asks, because Castiel finds the thought of exploring the city by himself tiring, and he figures he's here more for Dean anyway.
Others...
“Because you always do.”
“I really mean it,” Castiel answers honestly. “I... haven't been in a relationship in a long time, so I don't know if I'll be any good at it... but I would like to try. With you.”
“Ah, yes, I've... been busy.” It's not a complete lie; he
Bobby steps closer and Castiel notices the man is clutching a shotgun.
Dean looks more at home in Castiel's bedroom, gaze sweeping over the updated furniture and Castiel's laptop and xbox console. “Wow, you weren't kidding about the no DVD player. But yet you have the latest in gaming?”
“I just want to make sure you're doing this because

Castiel swallows when the cat swivels its head back in his direction, and without bidding Dean goodbye, he races back down the stairs, lunch bag in hand.

“That was me on the phone, sweetheart,” Gabriel supplies smoothly, shaking her hand. “I'm Gabriel, Cassie's older brother. Single, too.”
Dean Winchester, he decides, is off-limits.
? That's like one of the top fifty wealthiest companies in the country!”
Because Dean hasn't heard that routine in a long while. Nope, not these days.
“Oh, erm, yes I like tea,” he replies, distracted, having just noticed the cat on the sofa.
After they finish ironing out a few more details, Rowena walks him back down to the store, where Castiel is relieved to find Gabriel had done exactly nothing while they were gone.
Castiel nods, and the conversation shifts as they finish their meals. They talk about Rowena and her friends, wondering what she's been up to. But all the while, the cogs are turning in Castiel's mind.
“Buying a car,” Castiel replies, and he tries to ignore the salesman's greedy smile at those words. “Why do you sound–”
The Target doors are whizzing open and closed, other shoppers passing by giving him dubious glances. But Castiel only has eyes for Dean's handwriting. Eventually, he realizes he still needs to buy groceries, and so, gingerly, careful not to lose it, Castiel slides the paper into the inner pocket of his coat.
“Three days?”
“He's been down ever since you left. He tries to keep it together, but he's depressed,” she says, concerned. “Promise me you're serious, that you're here to stay.”
They exchange soft smiles. “I'm glad, too,” Castiel agrees.
“Sunday?” Castiel repeats, confused.
“Okay.”
“Depends.”
“You gotta at least
“Ignore him.” Both men turn to see a short blonde heading over. “Dean only believes in cars and music that came before 1979. Besides, Galveston isn't exactly big; I doubt he's burning through miles.”
I did. I would never–I wouldn't do that to someone, having been a victim myself.”
“Take care, polar bear,” Cas bids, catching Dean's eye. Then he waves at Sam and slips out of the diner.
Dean directs them to a place on the seawall that is overflowing with patrons. They are forced to park a bit further out, as the main lot is already full with at least three more cars lurking for the next open spot, and as they walk to the restaurant, Dean explains The Spot is actually five restaurants in one. The titular Spot is the main eatery, with the other four venues offering mainly drinks.
“That's impressive,” Castiel muses. He wonders why Sam is off at an expensive law school and Dean is living down in Galveston working on cars. “Did you go to school there, too?”
Sam did not really have time to think about the circumstance before he had read the one given by the blogger, who went by the username Cas. Sam was not surprised to find out that Dean had many mental health issues, and that he had found an abstract coping mechanism. Considering that his close friend and roommate was studying psychology, Sam was pretty open-minded towards the whole ‘your brain is weird’ shit.
As the end of the semester approached, he had asked both Dean and Castiel if they wanted him to come and visit. Dean had instantly said yes, becoming overly excited by the prospect. So, it had been planned that Sam would fly out and Dean and Cas would pick him up from the airport. So here he was, on a plane, heading towards his brother.
Castiel was on the edge of crying with joy, a large smile plastered over his clean-shaven face. Gabe was sitting in the passenger seat of the Lincoln, also smiling. It had been a day since the phone call from Dean.
The motor thrummed as Dean pulled out of the driveway, and onto the quiet road. He was fuming, how had he let himself become so reliant on Castiel? Why couldn't he be a big boy and look after himself? Dean shook the last thought from his head as he looked at the rear-view mirror to see Gabe's car driving 200 meters behind his own, Cas in the passenger seat.
Castiel was sitting at his desk finishing some paperwork when the house phone rang. Reaching for the phone he glanced at the number on the display screen, it was not one he recognised.  He pressed the phone to his ear, “Hello, is this Castiel Novak?” The voice was unfamiliar to Cas.  After confirming his name, the man introduced himself. “Hi, my name is Sam Winchester I'm calling in regard to my brother.”
Dean’s hands were sore and calloused from holding the shovel as he had been digging for about two hours. Propping the spade against the barn wall he headed inside.
They ended up sitting in silence for over 20 minutes, only disturbed when Dean called down the stairs for his Daddy.
after finishing he mouthed, ‘it’s about Dean.’ Gabe promptly left the room again with a nod, causing Dean to whine and snuffle.
Sorry for taking so long. I feel like I'm always making excuses for why I haven't been writing. I am trying to get some writing done, my writer's block is gone finely.
On another note: I hope you enjoy.
Cas stood in the doorway and just watched his baby sleep. Dean always had the cutest face while sleeping, even more so when he was little. It was almost a relief to know that Dean had regressed, and he didn’t need to wait for it to happen, which means he might actually be able to sleep tonight. He picked up the clothes and dumped them in the basket by the changing table, on his way to the door.
Hi, I'm back. I think. I'd like to be back but at this point, I don't think anyone should trust me when I say I'm back. Because last time I said that was nearly a year ago and I posted once then left again. Oops.  I will attempt to continue writing, as I really enjoy writing this story. I just have good old ADHD that make life way more difficult than it needs to be.
Cas nearly laughed with joy as the two cars pulled up outside his house; Him and Dean in the Impala and Gabe in the Lincoln, his baby was finally home and safe.
Gabe and Cas go to pick up Dean.
It had been six weeks, and no one had seen or heard from Dean Winchester, he had disappeared off the map. Gabe had ended up calling his boss and working out a plan so that he could stay with Cas and still work. Currently, he was sitting at the table, laptop in front of him, typing furiously. As a writer, Castiel didn't have to worry about taking leave or calling his boss. he was his own boss, as he liked to say.
“He has age regressions; he regresses to a children's mindset”.
It had been years for Sam, His brother had been missing for years. He had almost given up when he had found Cas’ first blog. The blog covered Cas’ life from long before he found Dean. It had posts from early 2000 talking about university and studying tips. You could tell that the blog was just a hobby.

“hello baby how was your sleep?” Castiel’s blue eyes sparkled as he looked at his baby all bundled up in his crib in a blue-footed onesie cuddling his little pink stuffie, lemonade
Dean had ended up four towns away, Cas and Gabe had gotten up early and eaten a quick breakfast, then gotten straight in the car and started driving. “Gabe, can you try and find a place for us to stay for the night? I don’t think Dean would like to sit in the car today.”
Dean stood, cup in hand and slowly made his way towards the house humming the tune to the song that had been playing on the radio in the garage. The back door was open, and Dean made his way inside, walking to the sunny kitchen where he knew Castiel would be.
Dean packs a spaz.
“Do you know if that is why he ran away?” Sam enquired.
He greeted Sam as he walked into the kitchen. Sam looked up from where he was sitting at the breakfast bar, a book in front of him. “What are you reading?” Cas asked, coming to sit next to Sam. Sam lifted the book of the bench, angling it so that Cas could see the front cover. Surprisingly it was one of Castiel’s favourite cheesy romance novels. One of the ones where you know that the two characters are going to end up together, you just don’t know how yet.
While Gabriel was making his way up the stairs, he explained what happened with Deans regressions. He then asked if Maggie could pass the phone back to Dean, she complied without question. “Hey, Dean-o would you like to talk to Daddy?” The answer came as an excited squeal.

The signs read 20 km till the next town. Dean sat looking out the windshield at the slightly winding road, while he drove. After some time, Dean reached the small town, parking at a petrol station to get fuel. Reaching over he opened the glove box pulling out a wad of cash, placed there for emergencies. He filled Baby with gas and headed into the store to pay. Dean asked the shop clerk where a cheap hotel was located.
The sliding glass door creaked slightly as they stepped into the inn’s office. A bubbly looking woman sat behind the desk reading something on the old desktop computer, at the sound of the door she looked up, smiling. “Hello, welcome to the Damon inn.”
“Yes, I believe it is, I feel like he had a bad experience and that set it off, he doesn't talk about it and he regresses immediately when you push for answers. I think that sometimes he feels frustrated that he doesn't have an ‘adult’ way of dealing with his feelings.”
, and maybe he'd meant it literally, that Dean was only subpar. It can be hard to tell sometimes with that deadpan tone.
“Did you?” he asks roughly, throat catching. He's never really felt like this before, never really cared what other people thought of him. “Buy it, I mean.”
think I'd want something like that?”
. Nothing looks
Dean's out of the room and down the stairs before Castiel can do so much as blink, stumbling off the bed as he hears the roar of the Impala. No...
Throwing his coat on over a sweater and some slacks, Castiel punches the address for Singer Auto Repair and Restoration into his GPS. The sky is cloudy and dark, with rain in the forecast later. Castiel doubts winter here will be anything like snow days in Chicago, but he doesn't want to be out late nonetheless.
Dean's staring at the ceiling. “They don't let in just anyone, but I can get you clearance.”
“Damn cat, what have I told you–oh, hey Cas.”
“Och, come on, let's go inside and you can tell Rowena all about it.”
With a startled yelp, Castiel gets hot coffee all over his shirt, backing away before the liquid can burn more harmfully. Dean quickly unplugs the machine, grabbing a few paper towels for Castiel, but his jaw is twitching, biting his lower lip and fighting off a grin.
“Uh, no, she usually attends the shows,” Dean replies distractedly as they drive through the downtown area. “She claims she's there for moral support, but I know she secretly loves it.”
Weaving their way around to the back of the store and still finding no one, Castiel starts to suspect his new coworker to be an unreliable type. They'd phoned ahead, letting her know they would arrive soon, but the woman is nowhere to be found. At the very back of the shop is a secondhand section, along with a few chairs and a couch.
Dean is slowly piecing things together. Cas's outrageous one liners, the long showers Dean has suddenly acquired, the intense staring contests the two of them have engaged in numerous times. But the bigger picture falls apart whenever Dean remembers how Cas had jerked away from his touch, how he'd run and avoided Dean for weeks.
Cas grins. “After a while, crocodile.”
Aaron looks between the two of them. “You two know each other?”
His brother hums, far too innocently. “Nothing, nothing. It's just...”
“He seems to have developed a particular distaste for you,” Rowena muses fondly, although she does hold the cat back while Castiel accepts his tea. “Dean calls him
“Oh, you're an angel,” she squeals, pinching his cheek. “Flattery will get you everywhere!” The woman looks over to where Castiel stands by his car with caution. “And you must be Cassie!”
Her words suggest that working isn't all they do. Castiel feels a pang of irritation, but he stamps it down before it becomes something worse.
Then he kisses Castiel again, slow and honeyed, and Castiel thinks he may like these kisses just as much as the rushed and needy ones.
“Yes, Dean,” he replies, the response far steadier than his emotions. “I know.”
Dean gives a tiny smile. “I don't go leaving my number in every customer vehicle, Cas.”
Dean didn't mean to upset him. “I'm sorry,” he offers weakly.
At last, today, he's tackling the back of the store, where the secondhand books reside. And until today, Castiel had quite forgotten about the man he'd found asleep on the couch that first afternoon.
“You can watch the shop whilst your brother and I discuss affairs elsewhere,” she declares primly, slipping back up the long staircase and evidently expecting her new boss to follow.
He follows her gaze out to the garage, where Dean's bent over the engine of a white Corolla. Castiel's cheeks flush. But... why?
, who, may I remind you, is not a real person.”
Grabbing a book from one of the shelves at random, Bowed Legs crosses the room to a small occult section Castiel hadn't noticed before. Alarmingly, the man bangs on the wall, which snaps open a moment later.
“You trying to leave without saying hello, Cas?” Dean drawls, only half-feigning the hurt in his tone. “And here I was getting used to your bizarre greetings.”
Castiel frowns. Who is this woman driving Dean away from his career? But Dean looks uncomfortable as it is, so again, he doesn't pry. “Will you miss it?” he asks instead.
” he brags lowly as they head back to the house. “Let's just say there's no longer a designated section for the written porn.”
“The Treemont?” he asks doubtfully.
, every day for as long as he can have it.
He saves Dean's number without sending a message, throwing his phone onto the bed in frustration. Fucking Rowena. Yeah, Dean's probably doing a lot of that. Fucking Dean. That's what Castiel wants to do. He wants to fuck Dean, long and hard, quick and dirty. His mind provides tantalizing images of Dean bent over the hood of the Cabriolet, his jumpsuit pooling around his knees. Castiel struggles to remove his boxers without getting up, but finally, he extracts himself from the chair with limited mobility. He wavers on his feet a bit, hand clumsily palming at his own dick, and he shudders at the touch, imagining it's
“Nope,” the man replies. But with a wink, he adds, “The state of Texas did.” He dangles the book in Castiel's face, proudly displaying some sort of auto restoration textbook.
“Yeah, he's attending law school at Stanford.”
Water goes down the wrong way, and Castiel chokes. “You mean Dean?” he wheezes, and Gabriel slaps his back.
“Joanna Beth,” Dean warns, “don't make me tell your mother you snuck into that concert last week.”
Whatever the case, Dean and Rowena are out on a date, a date
me?” he cries, hurt spilling across his face. “Were you... Was all this... Cas, were you just trying to butter me up with
Although the auto shop keeps him busy during the week, he swings by for a quick lunch, and he spends hours there on the weekends. Rowena has that look, that she knows something changed between them, although she doesn't meddle again. She just smiles wisely and sips her tea, smirking every time Dean hangs around to spend a little extra time with Castiel.
of energy spikes through Castiel when he molds his mouth to Dean's. The man's lips are just as soft as they look, pliant and plump under Castiel's own slightly chapped ones. Dean lets out a little hum of contentment, angling his head to deepen the kiss. Castiel shifts in his seat, needing to be closer, and his hands wander into Dean's hair, tugging his face nearer. Dean sighs into it, his own fingers latching onto Castiel's jacket, and Castiel fluidly slides from his chair straight into Dean's lap. Dean gasps in surprise, but Castiel takes advantage of the moment, slipping his tongue past Dean's parted lips and licking his way inside. Dean quickly gets with the program, tongue eagerly pressing against Castiel's. Castiel curls his fingers around Dean's hair tightly, eliciting a moan, and he uses his grip to tilt Dean's head back, breaking the kiss and trailing his mouth down to Dean's bare throat where he sucks the skin between his teeth.
“Yoo-hoo!”
God forbid he ever has to provide directions to a tourist; they'll end up certainly more lost than before.
that merit is.
, his mind supplies, and Castiel turns his body enough to hide his rapidly-hardening cock from Dean. “It's fine,” he manages, hoping Dean doesn't recognize the need in those rasped words. “I'd like to come if you'll let me.”
“Do you really mean that, Cas?” he asks, eyes searching. “You're not just saying that to get into my bed?”
“You texted my brother?”
The guests are steadily filing in now, filling up the tables. Dean and Castiel are joined by six others, mostly fellow models who greet Dean, although they don't seem to acknowledge him aside from their familiar handshake. Once everyone is settled, a rep for the show gives a little speech and then invites everyone to enjoy themselves tonight before the real spectacle tomorrow.
Compared to the house, it isn't much to look at. Squeezed between a shop for fish bait and a hippie candle store, the business has two large windows, one boarded, the other showing off a shoddy display of seemingly random books. The front door has been propped open by a stack of hardcovers, and Castiel cringes at the thought of incoming bugs and an over-exerted air conditioning system, not to mention any damage to the books. The hanging sign above is marked with peeling letters, spelling out
He tries not to let his disappointment show, but Dean has always struggled to hide things from Cas.  He knows Cas will see the way his lips turn and the slight worry lines that form above his brow.
He hastily bids Dean goodnight, but before he drives off, Castiel leans out the window and asks, “Is it too forward of me to call you tomorrow? I, erm, still have your number.”
“You're shitting me,” Gabriel says when he visits again in late July. Castiel has taken his brother to The Spot, knowing Gabe would love it (he does, he begins jumping up and down at the milkshake options).
Dean spares a scalding glance for Castiel's Cabriolet. “Dude.”
“Of course,” he agrees honestly, though a bit thrown by the abrupt inclusion. “You look very lovely, Rowena.”
Castiel listens as she explains how Amara hurt herself and then lied, telling police
“It's just my shirt,” he responds, and even that isn't all the way off. “Besides, we're closed for the day.”
“Yes, and that's why I'm here.” Not liking the judgment being cast his way, Castiel drinks his tea out of politeness, pursing his lips at the black flavor, but it would be rude to ask for honey. “Tell me more about the store.”
Castiel opens the door for him. “I read it's very nice. I have reservations at the bar on the roof.” Dean's eyebrows go up, but he follows Castiel to the elevators. They are seated quickly, and Dean stares at his menu questionably. Castiel can agree the place doesn't offer a wide selection of food, but they have enough, and the dimly lit atmosphere of the rooftop is pleasant.
Castiel grows more embarrassed by the minute. “When you took care of the car bill,” he explains. “You paid for it and then left your number. I thought it was a bribe for...”
Dean shimmies out from underneath Castiel and sits at the edge of the bed.
When the old water heater needs replacing, Mrs. Butters concludes she's been washing the dishes too slowly, and Castiel doesn't bother correcting her.
“I need to apologize, don't I?” Castiel asks, even though he already knows.
Rowena sighs and wipes her palms on her skirt before joining Castiel where he is straightening the magazines. “Look, I understand. You're worried about dating the boy for several months, growing attached, falling in love and such, but–”
They sample all of Galveston's eateries, occasionally returning to The Spot or another one they prefer, but generally, they try a new place every week. They explore museums and visit Moody Mansion, Castiel marveling at the architecture while Dean snorts at the frivolity of the rich. And if he lies and claims the housekeeper is working late to clean the house so they can't head there after... Dean will never know, simply accepting it and inviting Castiel to watch another movie on his couch instead.
The contract, Castiel realizes. He wonders what that has to do with Sam, but Dean looks uneasy, so he doesn't press the topic.
“The alley?” Castiel echoes, glaring at his brother. “How is my Mercedes supposed to get back there without a scratch, Gabe?”
Gabriel, it seemed, had other ideas.
He does uber to the closest lot, which happens to sell a variety of pre-owned vehicles. The sales rep seems a bit too enthusiastic, and he wonders just what sort of condition these cars are in. Rowena calls as they are surveying an old, gold Lincoln.
Dean was asleep before half the bottle was drained. Placing the boy onto one of the beds, Cas placed a loving kiss on his baby’s head, kissing the sweet-smelling hair.
“Gabe pull over for a minute would you, we need to think about this,” Castiel said dropping his phone into his lap, Dean had definitely turned his phone off, yet Cas hadn't stopped calling. Gabe indicated, then pulled over into a parking bay on the side of the road. “Where would he be likely to go?”
The hotel he was directed to was shit, to say the least, but it was better than sleeping in the back seat of the Impala or wasting all his money on a better place to sleep for one night. Anyway, he had grown up in these shitty motels like this one. Dinner had been all right, takeaways had nothing on Cas’ cooking. Cas shit, Dean had been selfish, and he knew it, but it was for the best. Wasn't it?
