They stand in silence for a minute, John wondering, but not asking how a man with the world at his fingertips could be so pessimistic. Then the silence is broken by shouting coming from downstairs in the club. Sherlock takes off in the sound of the noise and John follows close behind.
“Hmmm, yes. I think we’re peaking," Sherlock looks up, "Music?” John nods his head in response, then watches Sherlock head over to the portable record player.
Sherlock puts the remote down and spreads out, resting his calves on John’s thighs without a conveying a hint of awkwardness or concern for personal boundaries. John tenses up for a moment, then lets himself relax. The next thing he knows, it's sunny outside. Seinfeld is still on the telly, but it must be a marathon. By the looks of it, it’s noon or nearly noon. His shoulders are cramped and his legs are asleep. He looks down at his lap and sees that Sherlock’s head is resting there now. John studies him for a moment and is suddenly overcome with warmth for his suffering friend. When he thinks of how Jim had thwarted his efforts to stay clean and possibly tried to kill him, the tenderness is replaced by anger and protectiveness.
Without speaking, John walks behind Sherlock and begins stroking his hair and massaging his scalp as Sherlock had done for him.
“I’m enjoying the texture of this glass right now, thanks,” John responds as he strokes the rim of his glass with his thumb, “Strange how you don’t really notice things like this normally, isn’t it?”
But there are also echoes of other '70s icons such as T. Rex, Cockney Rebel and Mott The Hoople in the Velvet sound. Holmes and his four bandmates, Greg Lestrade, Molly Hooper, Phillip Anderson, and Jim Moriarty have graced the magazine covers in Britain for the past 12 months.
John watches as his two friends walk to the middle of the room and wrap their arms affectionately around each other. He’s happy for them, he really is, but there’s also something about their happiness that makes his heart sink. He turns around to pour himself another shot of sambuca.
“Yes, well. I didn’t think I needed to tell you it would hurt,” John smiles and takes a clean flannel to dry Sherlock’s hand before applying the butterfly stitches. “You’ll be fine. Listen, Sherlock...what you did, it was stupid, but... Jim deserved it.”
John tries to stop his racing thoughts and focus on the morning at hand. He turns his attention to the music playing on the radio. It’s a familiar song from about ten years ago.
The other man’s eyes flutter, and Sherlock watches him for a moment before John blinks his eyes open and rubs his face, “Mmmm? Wha'ssit? ”
John strips down to his pants and looks over to Sherlock, who’s in the same state of undress, “Okay, you first!” he chuckles.
Greg overhears John and turns around to face them, “Go on, Johnny! A little bit won’t hurt. It’s safer than drinking!”
“Really, Greg? We were all naked together in a hot tub just a few weeks ago, now you’re embarrassed?”
It’s early evening but no jackets are required as the group walks along the streets of Amsterdam. The smell of flowers is in the air, and there’s a festive atmosphere amongst the masses. With no show today, the band have the day to recuperate after nearly a week of consecutive performances. Greg, Molly, and Anderson spent the day exploring, while Sherlock and Julien caught
After a few minutes, John breaks the peaceful silence, “Right, well… I think I need a shower, what do you think?”
“We don’t, really. I mean, we haven’t in the past. But she’s off...whatever she was on and has settled down with her girlfriend, Clara.”
though John can’t understand much of the text, it seems to speculate about the drummer’s relationship with the band’s enigmatic frontman. John’s lips tighten. He doesn’t think he likes Julien, though he’s not quite sure why. He puts down the magazine without closing it and walks over to the drinks table. There are loads of people milling about but he doesn’t feel like talking to anyone. The angry Grunge music playing doesn’t easily allow for conversation, anyway.
John stands still for a few seconds, eyes closed, fists clenched. When he opens them, Sherlock is standing before him, hand extended. He steps out of his trousers and lets himself be led to the sofa.
“John. This is oddly reminiscent of the night we met, though I’m sure I was in something more flattering than a hospital gown at the time.”
“What’s going on?” Sherlock shouts, taking control of the room as they run through the crowded space toward the bar.
The look of embarrassment is mirrored on John’s face. “I won’t ask. Lie down,” John commands, avoiding eye contact.
Sherlock, who is lying on the sofa, responds, “Oh, Mrs Hudson, you know, nothing like being drugged and having a gastric lavage to get you going. The withdrawal symptoms I’ve been looking forward to are beginning to set it," Sherlock says sarcastically as he tugs the cover up to his chin.
“I bet that does feel good. Molly, would you like to experience your first massage during euphoria?” Greg offers.
“I tried heroin for the first time about a year ago, right after I met Sally. My entire life, I’ve never been able to quiet my mind. For the first time, I was free from that.”
John snickers and turns away from the wind to light the cigarette. That’s when he sees her behind him. Sally is standing feet away, smoking with Anderson.
“I’m sure I knew that at one time, but I’ve tried to delete all the useless information I’ve acquired over the years,” Sherlock states.
John sighs with frustration and embarrassment before his thoughts are interrupted by the sound of shouting coming from below. Concerned, he jumps out of bed and runs down the stairs. John stops mid-step when he sees Sherlock in his dressing gown in the sitting room with Sally Donovan.
“Well, I’m here as your doctor, after all,” John laughs sheepishly, looking over to the hot tub, “Everyone seems to forget that, including me sometimes.”
“Actually, I’ve just given Sherlock something to help ease his withdrawal symptoms. Alcohol is certainly not a good idea, and neither is being alone in a warm bath.”
, the opening band. The club is underground, almost cave-like and is small and smoky. John feels quite alone and is tempted to drink himself into feeling less out-of-place. He wonders if the barman speaks English.
“Oh, I don’t mind! Mrs Turner next door’s got married ones!” She beams at John, “Anyway, what you need, Sherlock, is a nice bath and a hot toddy to fix you up.”
“I assumed you would,” Sherlock responds almost too nonchalantly, “I would be lying if I said I won’t ...miss having you around, but I understand. I want you to be happy, John. Do what makes you happy.”
“Don’t be surprised, Molly. Ecstasy increases your urge to show physical affection,” Sherlock smiles sheepishly, “Also, you’re one of my best friends, so there’s that,” He kisses her forehead. Molly blushes.
“Give me your arm,” John looks down at Sherlock’s extended arm and notices the scars for the first time. His nose flares and his lips tighten.  He takes a deep breath and tries to evoke sympathy rather than anger. “Why anyone with such a charmed life would inject drugs into their veins is beyond my comprehension.”
John looks down to Sherlock’s clasped hands and reaches over to take his left wrist, pulling up the sleeve of his dressing gown to examine the fading marks. “Please, Sherlock, take care of yourself. You don’t need this.” John looks sincerely into Sherlock’s eyes as he traces circles on the track marks dotting his alabaster skin. He lowers Sherlock’s arm and gently says, “let’s go to bed.”
Sherlock nods and walks into the bathroom, sitting down on the toilet seat cover. John unravels the paper napkin and holds out Sherlock’s hand, examining the damage. Thankfully, the broken glass hasn’t done much other than inflict some superficial damage.
“I never saw the point in having friends before,” Sherlock looks up at him, “Thanks to you, now I do,” he smiles weakly and John looks up to meet his gaze.
“Sally!” John shouts, “You've some nerve showing up here!  I know what you gave Sherlock yesterday.Can't you just leave him alone?”
“Fine. Really, I’m fine. I’m just glad Jim’s gone. He’s a good drummer, but a confirmed creep. John, maybe you could check on Sherlock. He hasn’t said anything, but I can tell something’s up with him.”
Sherlock gets up to flip the record, and they’re flooded by a distinctly 60’s sound, a slow melody and the whispering voices of a man and woman.
, he thinks, and instead, goes to close the blinds and turn off the humming record player before making his exit.
“Yes, I agree, Doctor Watson. But for now, at least, we know Sherlock will have nothing to worry about.”
“You two are proper mates now, aren’t you? That’s nice. Sherlock needs someone, you know, someone other than his bandmates.”
“Jesus, Sherlock!” John takes a breath to calm himself, “Ok, well, did you stop taking the Methadone suddenly?”
Minutes pass, and the room has grown a bit lighter when they both open their eyes again. “That was… good.” John whispers.
Sherlock ponders for a moment before he speaks. “I have fans, but few friends. I love what I do, I love the music, the performance. But fame, fans… it’s all vapid. Unimportant.”
The door slams in Mycroft’s face, but Instead of walking back to the sofa, Sherlock heads directly toward the bathroom and starts the shower, quickly closing the door behind him.
His fingers start lightly moving at the base of John’s skull where his head and neck meet. Then he begins massaging his scalp in slow, rhythmic circles.
“Shall I go get you some extra duvets?” John coughs as he tries, unsuccessfully, to divert his gaze from his friend’s silhouette.
John is inside and up the stairs before he can hear what Sarah was saying. As he enters the flat, he looks around for Sherlock, eager to warn him of Sally’s presence. He doesn’t see him. He walks over to the drinks table where Molly and Greg are downing a few shots.
“Well, don’t worry, symptoms of withdrawal should set in by this afternoon or tonight unless you’re very lucky. You really should eat now -  I’m not sure you’ll be able to keep anything down once the nausea sets in.”
“Fine? Jesus. I guess I should take that as a compliment coming from you? Anyway, what do say everyone comes back to mine for a few drinks?  It's still early.”
Sherlock is sitting on the floor, back leaning up against the wall, eyes shut. John looks down at him as he moves his fingers around on the feathery duvet.
“You’re not boring, John, but you’ll be much more interesting outdoors.” Sherlock walks over to the coat tree and retrieves two hats, “Here, put this on. I don’t want anyone to recognize us.”
Twenty minutes later he’s in a cab headed east and there’s nothing to do but think. He thinks back to Sherlock’s words from the night before, that there was nothing wrong with… what they had done. In theory, John believes this, he
John leans forward and pauses for a moment before taking Sherlock’s head in his hands, kissing him tenderly, aware of the unfamiliar taste of his own semen on his tongue.
John’s parts his legs a bit and Sherlock moves his hands up to his testicles and squeezes gently and releasing before moving two fingertips back to his perineum. John lets out a controlled exhale before nearly shouting, “Oh, God! I’m going to come soon, Sherlock! Fuuuck.”
Sherlock switches off the lights and climbs under the duvet. John walks to the bathroom and splashes his face with water. He looks at himself and bursts into a fit of giggles.
“So, what now?” Molly looks around at the others. With her fresh face, her hair pulled back, and her simple babydoll dress, she looks more like a seventeen-year-old than her actual age of twenty-seven.
Sherlock looks over at him dubiously, “You’ve been watching this for a quarter of an hour and don’t understand a thing?” John makes eye contact and shrugs. Sherlock frowns, then his lips curl.
John's nostrils flare, and he grabs for the package. Sherlock moves it quickly out of John’s reach. Without a moment’s hesitation, John reaches up to Sherlock’s wrist, deftly twisting him around, holding his arm tightly behind him. Sherlock’s back is now to John as he struggles to get free from the arm lock.
“We’re amongst friends, John,” Sherlock breaks the contact of their foreheads and looks over John’s shoulder, spotting Sally, “Well, mostly.”
“Definitely not," Sherlock chortles, "As lovely as she was, she wasn’t exactly the brave army doctor type.”
As he presses deeply into the skin on either side of Sherlock’s spinal column, Sherlock groans. At that moment, John realises that if he had any question about whether he was actually turned on by Sherlock or if Amsterdam had been a drug-induced fluke, he now had his response. With the realization, he feels like a pilot light has been lit in his groin. He pulls back abruptly. Sherlock turns over slowly, and they look searchingly into each other's eyes searchingly for a few moments. The moment is broken when the front door swings open abruptly.
Here in Britain, the lead singer is known simply as Sherlock. The band, Velvet, is simply the next big thing. In fact, Velvet are already huge - their debut album just entered the British charts at No. 1.
John isn’t sure if he wants to move, but doesn’t want to be selfish. In fact, he wants Sherlock to feel as good as he’s made him feel.
John sighs. “Mycroft, you don’t have to pay me. He’s my friend. Of course I’ll stay with him. But I really would prefer he stay in hospital for a few days.”
“Well, I’m tired and you’re keeping me from sleep, to start.” John sits down on the end of the bed, pulling his legs in underneath him.
As Greg attempts to shove Jim away, he slings the bottle in Sherlock’s direction. Sherlock’s able to deflect the bottle with his hands, and it crashes to the floor.
“Yes, and Rosemary. Shampoo,” Sherlock leans in further, pressing his forehead to John’s and bringing his fingertips to the hair at the nape of the other man’s neck. They remain like this for what feels to John, like an eternity. Every sensation is amplified and he wonders why people are afraid to make this kind of contact with other humans in their normal lives. The warmth from Sherlock’s forehead is like a hot stone, dampened by the rain. His breath is a cool breeze
“It doesn’t change anything, John. It’s fine. And you know how I feel about romantic entanglement, anyway. It’s not what I’m looking for now, maybe never. And nothing has changed, nothing
“Okay,” John looks up at Sherlock, “I’m going to ask you something, Sherlock. Is there anything going on with you and Julien?”
“It’s my pleasure," John stops himself, "well, I mean... it’s fine. It's all fine. You’re my friend, it’s what friends do. Plus, I am a doctor.”
“John, I’m-” Sherlock whimpers, “I’m almost there.” John increases his speed and Sherlock’s certain he’ll die right there on the sofa. It feels like drugs shooting through his every vein, igniting a fire in his arms and legs. John slows down as he feels Sherlock’s body spasm. Waves of pleasure take over as he comes hard in John’s hand. When Sherlock becomes aware of his surroundings again, he’s lying back on John whose sticky hands are resting on his thighs.”
“Haven’t seen him,” Greg looks around, “Say, Sherlock, would you be interested in doing a repeat of Amsterdam tonight? I have some more pills and--”
“Why did you do it, Sherlock?” John asks softly, his voice on the verge of cracking with anger, “I’ve never understood. You’re brilliant, you’ve got a promising career doing the thing you love, you have friends who care about you. Why did you ever need,” John waves his hand toward the loo, “that poison?”
“It’s water under the bridge. I’m just glad you’re staying clean. I have to admit when I didn’t hear from you the last two weeks I worried you’d started using again.”
“Yes, of course. You go on,” Sherlock scoots forward and jumps up. “I’ll make tea and go after you.” John gets to his feet, reaching for his pants.  “You should probably leave the tea to me.”
“Sherlock,” John looks serious and determined, “This doesn’t change that I’m not coming to America.”
“Yes. Right now, I just want to experience this moment - I’m not usually able to do that. You’re here with me, the world’s problems are not."
John’s not sure if he’s referring to the massage or to their close proximity. Sherlock’s fingertips are on his wrists, thumbs stroking small circles.
As the door opens onto the room, he sees Sherlock in the bed, hair a mess, drowsy looking, but awake. He perks up a bit when John enters.
Sherlock reaches out uncertainly and rests one hand on John’s neck, his thumb against his chin. When John closes his eyes and presses into his hand with a sigh, Sherlock is encouraged to lean forward and rest his forehead to John’s. He whispers, “I want to kiss you.”
“Oh, Sherlock! You’re one of my best friends too!” She squeezes his arm and turns to sit down opposite Greg. Sherlock takes her spot and reaches for John’s right foot this time.
Sherlock sighs and rolls his eyes, “I don’t know why everyone is so keen to have a label for everything, but yes, I’ve found myself attracted to various people of different genders. I have a theory that everyone is
“Mmmm,” John murmurs, “I feel like we should be solving the world’s problems together right now. I’ve got all this energy.”
John clears his throat, “I’m going to leave you another Ativan in case you wake up and can’t go back to sleep. I’ll be on the sofa if you need me.”
Every touch feels like energy is being pulled and pushed in and out of him by the magic of Sherlock’s fingertips. He moves his large hands down to John’s back, putting pressure on the lingering tightness there.
He lightly strokes his cheekbones with his thumb, matching the intensity he sees in Sherlock’s eyes.
“It would appear so,” Sherlock says evenly “And to answer your previous question, I’ve been relaxing, playing the violin, working on some new music.”
John tries to recall the name of the group, but he can’t. Is it meant to be an uplifting song? The lyrics are a little confusing.
“Okay, nevermind. When did you take your last dose? What kind of symptoms have you been experiencing?”
“Ah, John! Yes, you’re free to explore. In fact, the band left a few minutes ago to do just that. Of course, you have your pager if you’re needed.”
Sherlock moves his lips down to John’s, only making light contact. The sensation is staggering, too much and not enough at the same time. John exhales shakily, enjoying the electric connection.  Without thinking, he pouts slightly, increasing the pressure between the point of contact. Sherlock responds in kind, then tilts his head to the side, parting his lips. They both groan as John takes Sherlock’s bottom lip into his mouth. He sucks lightly and is overcome by an urgency to feel more. Sherlock’s tongue moves searchingly, and John offers his in return, savouring the feeling of wet velvet. Sherlock intensifies the kiss by sucking lightly on John’s tongue. He tastes like sweet earth and vaguely of tobacco - it’s intoxicating. Soon, they’re clumsily lapping at each other, both panting and moaning unabashedly. Sherlock purrs and it feels magical. It’s a sloppy, wet kiss, extremely sensual, yet not urgent.
“Can I… can I kiss you? Properly?” Sherlock looks into John’s eyes with serious focus, his pupils blown impossibly wide.
John sighs, “Okay, well honestly, I’ve been thinking about going to New Zealand. Harry’s local clinic is looking for a GP.”
As John enters his hotel, he shakes the rain off his umbrella and looks up to the lift in front of him. He had considered bringing Marika to the club the others were headed to, or back to his room, but found he couldn’t be arsed. In fact, at the moment, he wants nothing more than for the tour to be over...
Without hesitation, Sherlock walks up to the drunk man, catching his gaze and narrowing his eyes. “You think you can just do what you please to Molly? Is that what you think?!” Then without waiting on his response, Sherlock’s fist collides with Jim’s jaw. Jim gasps, then a painful groan escapes him when Sherlock’s other fist makes contact with his stomach. Sherlock steps back, looking around at the group that has gathered round.
He walks back into the bedroom and pauses for a moment before sliding into the empty side of the bed. Sherlock is lying on his stomach, and though the pills are definitely wearing off, he still craves touch.
A few strokes later, John is on the precipice, the burning feeling more smouldering than electric this time, but when it hits him, he’s able to luxuriate in the release. His whole body shudders as he continues stroking Sherlock, who follows just moments later.
“No, Thomas Wolfe did. But more to the point, I see your loneliness because I’m no stranger to the feeling myself,” Sherlock responds, looking ahead at nothing in particular.
“Are you his interpreter now?” Anderson rolls his eyes, getting up to leave. Julien downs his water and starts toward the exit.
“Bring your foot up so I can do yours at the same time,” John suggests, a soft smile on his face as he looks across to Sherlock. He obeys, and John begins mimicking the touches, pressing gently into the ball of his foot, stroking upward.
John moves his hands to Sherlock’s waist, his hips, then around to lightly rub his fingers over his cock and balls. Sherlock shudders and breaks their kiss. He brings his own hands to John’s hips before speaking, “John?”
“It’s fine,” Sherlock says as he grabs a cocktail napkin and wraps it around his hand. “Get that vile man out of here!”
“Ok,” John takes his wrist to check his pulse, “I’m going to give you a Beta Blocker first of all for the physical symptoms of anxiety. You can take them twice a day for a few days; that should help with your heart rate and the shakiness. I’ll also give you a small dose of Ativan to help you relax and hopefully sleep. You’ll need to drink loads of water. I can give you some IV fluids if you haven’t been able to keep down liquids.”
John stands and hands Sherlock a towel from the cabinet. Sherlock gets out and unabashedly begins to dry his body and hair as he walks into the bedroom. John follows.
“Right, I’m sure that’s what you’re interested in, Anderson,” Greg quips, “Actually, I’ve got a treat for us tonight, kids.”
Sherlock walks over to John and reaches out to grab his upper arm, looking at him questioningly. John takes a few heavy breaths, then clashes his mouth into Sherlock’s, moving his hands down to grip his hips. He breathes in the other man’s tongue in one movement and they drink each other in thirstily, nearly forgetting to come up for air.
You’re on the verge of fame. Everyone wants to know you. Speaking of which, why are you out here with me and not mingling with all your admirers?”
“Okay.” John stands to walk toward the metro, taking in the beautiful gardens and playing children as he goes. The newsstand next to the Metro station catches his attention. He can’t read French, but maybe there’s an English language section - something to keep him occupied tonight, barring any unanticipated medical issues. Looking through the glossy covers, he notices Sherlock’s image staring back at him- posed on a bar stool, one hand in his hair, the other holding a fag. There’s an unreadable expression on his face that John thinks he's seen before. It’s not the issue of
“Hello, boys!” Anderson calls out, “Anyone fancy walking over to the Red Light District? We’re not far!”
John smiles dumbly to himself, accepting the flattery. Sherlock sits up and takes off his shirt, before lying back down on his side away from John. John scoots in and brings his fingertips to the small of Sherlock’s too bony back and starts a slow up and down movement.
“I’d love to see the Eiffel Tower. I'm all about historic landmarks,” says the diminutive guy with a little too much enthusiasm.
if that’s the term we’re using - that it’s quite possible for nearly anyone to be attracted to another person regardless of gender. It’s insignificant, really. It’s almost a minor detail when looking at the whole picture.”
“Get him out of here!” He shouts, rubbing his knuckles. Then there’s the sound of glass shattering, and suddenly, Jim’s holding his broken beer bottle up to Sherlock’s face. There’s a collective gasp of horror.
he thinks. Perhaps he’s still coming down from Saturday, but he’s over the constant travelling and parties. He feels like he’s caught in Sherlock’s orbit and if he gets too close, he’ll burn. They’ve become quite close and it’s destabilizing. They kissed, for God’s sake! His current life is such a contrast from Bosnia, it’s a real mind-fuck. He has to to get his bearings.
John takes a deep inhale, “If smoking always felt like this, I’d definitely develop a habit.” John laughs and coughs at the same time.
“Yes, thankfully. I’m hoping there won’t be a repeat of that first night. He’s doing well. I’m proud of him.”
“Everything’s gorgeous to look at right now, isn’t it? I hope I’ll never see anything the same way again. D’you know what I mean?”
John eases his way up, trying not to disturb Sherlock. Still thinking about what he'd like to do to Jim, he looks out the window onto the street below before he walks towards the kettle to make tea.
“Get over here,” John says reassuringly, before bringing their heads together and planting a lingering kiss on Sherlock’s sweaty forehead whilst brushing away a damp lock of hair from his face.
John nods in response, and Sherlock slowly unbuttons and unzips before pulling down his jeans. Sherlock caresses John’s solid thighs, then plants soft kisses up and down their length. John tries to control his breathing, but it’s a losing battle. Sherlock looks up at John’s face then closes his eyes before brushing his cheek against the front of John’s pants, exhaling hot breath against his cock.
John takes a seat on one of the nearest benches. After a moment, Sherlock follows and sits next to him. “So, you speak French?” John asks, not looking away from the people picnicking and laid out on the green in front of them.
Sherlock moves his lips slowly down to John’s, stilling them when they make light contact. The sensation is staggering, and John exhales shakily, enjoying the electric connection.  After a few seconds like this, Sherlock moves his head up, then down, catching John’s lower lip with his top lip. Motionless for a moment, then he moves his lips along John’s, side to side - not quite a kiss, but very intimate. The dragging motion feels magnetic like their lips are joined by some unseen force.
“Yeah? It’s strange, isn’t it?” John says, leaning his head back into the pressure of Sherlock’s hands. “
“Fuck. Oh, Fuck!” He lets out a sound that’s somewhere between a moan and a growl and Sherlock purrs in response. The vibrations intensify the pleasure and John looks down at Sherlock on his knees in front of him. “You’re fucking incredible, you know that” he pants.
Sans his perpetual scowl, John notes how young and innocent Sherlock appears. His chest tightens. For whatever reason, this man’s well-being has become important to him. He observes Sherlock for another moment; his colour’s slightly better and he’s breathing rhythmically. He gently touches his wrist to check his pulse -
“A talking encyclopedia? Sounds familiar,” Greg laughs. “Listen, boys, I’ve had enough of a history lesson for today. I saw a little French dive bar over there. Might check it out.”
“Mmmm. It would seem so,” John looks up at Sherlock’s lips, then to his eyes. He reaches up and touches the full pout lightly with his fingertips, stroking down from his sharp cupid’s bow, over the damp slit, stopping on the plump lower lip.
John considers for a moment then replies, “I may do that. Cheers.” He looks over to Sherlock in the cooling water, “Are you ready to get out of there?”
John considers his options for a moment. He wants to see the Eiffel Tower, but as lovely as Molly is, there's also Anderson and Jim. Despite hating being told what to do, he decides to accompany Greg and Sherlock in the hopes of seeing as much as possible. It will be better than wandering around aimlessly as he had planned.
Sherlock tries to focus his eyes for a moment then responds, “Come in,” stepping back and waving his hand towards the room behind him. He walks slowly toward the bed and sits. John stands a few feet away, looking down at him.
“Well, Greg’s pretty good about checking his insulin levels, and Sherlock…I think he’s all right. I mean, I don’t think you need to worry about a repeat of a few weeks ago... hopefully.”
When John arrives to his room - bigger than expected and tastefully furnished - he settles in for a quick kip. When he wakes up about an hour later, mostly refreshed, he heads to Ricky’s room, still unsure of what’s expected of him today.
John follows Sarah down the stairs and onto the pavement. She lights up a cigarette and hands it over to John.
“Excuse me, Sarah,” John takes one inhale then stubs the cigarette out on the brick wall, “I’m going back inside.”
“Soft,” John murmurs, looking into Sherlock’s eyes again. “Everything is so fucking soft. Want to feel mine?”
“Well, that’s not going to happen,” Mycroft says shortly, “And, while we’re at it, perhaps you’ll reconsider the American tour? For Sherlock’s sake.”
“Right, I just mean…it’s just strange - you’re so different from what the press would have the world believe.”
After a silent ride home, the two men walk into 221B. John stands awkwardly, resisting the urge to put the kettle on while Sherlock puts on a record. Suddenly, the flat is flooded with Mick Jagger’s smooth voice and John feels a bit more at ease.
he thinks. He looks down the alley one last time, then back to the couple. This time, he makes out John’s face in the shadows.
“You’re not wrong,” John contemplates then looks over to Sherlock, “but I hope you’re not referring to drugs.”
“Of course. We’ve been rehearsing. It appears that Julien is going to be joining us on a permanent basis.”
“So, have you seen much of Molly and Greg since the last show? Or Julien?” John asks as they walk in Regent’s Park.
Sherlock reaches the top of his head and pushes in softly with the heels of his hands. John’s eyes roll back in his head and he moans with delight.
John brings his hands up to Sherlock’s lean chest, letting his fingertips gently stroke up and down before he flings off Sherlock’s shirt in one resolute motion. Sherlock groans and brings his hand to the back of John’s neck, pulling him back in for a kiss.
Sherlock jumps up to get a wet flannel, which he hands to John, then sits awkwardly, unsure whether to reclaim his position or to leave John to himself.
As he walks down the corridor toward his hotel room, he hears violin music coming from Sherlock’s next door. It’s high energy this time, not mournful. He’s in a good mood, he thinks, but then why isn’t he celebrating a successful tour with the others? He considers knocking but decides that being on his own is what he needs. He’s knackered and doesn’t even turn on the lights before taking off his jeans and getting into bed.
John sits and watches the band in the studio space. The new song is incredible - it’s austere, yet hopeful, and obviously comes from Sherlock’s personal experience with drugs and getting clean. Sherlock’s singing is heartfelt and full-on, unusual for rehearsals. He and Sherlock have barely spoken today and John wonders if they're just going to pretend like last night never happened, like the massage incident.
“Sherlock?” John calls as he walks into the flat later, arms laden with takeaway. There’s no answer. John sets the bags down on the kitchen counter and begins to fill the kettle for tea. He turns the switch and reaches up to get a teabag out of the cabinet. There, beside the box of Tetley’s is a cigar box that wasn’t there before. John opens the box, dismayed, seeing some sort of heroin kit. Presumably Sherlock’s.
There’s one more performance on the continent, then you’ll have your chance to see them in London before they embark on their American tour next month. Maybe you’ll be one of the lucky women (or men!) featured in
He walks over to the kettle to make some tea. He hasn’t seen Sherlock since the London show at the end of the tour, and he’s not sure whether to feel disappointed or relieved. He misses the excitement of the tour, the fun of hanging ‘round the band... Sherlock. However, he’s aware that his identity was getting too muddled up in all the chaos and his friendship with Sherlock. "
Sherlock stands and gently pulls a few inches away in order to look John in the eyes. He smirks, but it’s markedly more vulnerable than usual. He moves his hands to John’s lower back, pulling him in closer to press their bodies against each other. John, still influenced by his anger about the drugs, needs to regain control.
“But who are we going to find on such short notice? We’ve got a show in Nantes in two days!” Molly says as she tugs at her long hair anxiously.
“I’m sure it’s very interesting, Greg, but we were just about to have dinner,” Sherlock gestures to the takeaway on the counter.
“Are you following me?” He smiles and shakes his head, turning to descend into the metro without making a purchase.
John stares back for what seems like minutes before he looks away, contemplatively. Sherlock stares back defiantly.
John realises that seeing his friends naked and touching should be very strange, but the chemicals in his brain are making him immune to awkwardness.
He turns around. “Sherlock, Jesus, you scared me!  I was just looking for you. Sally’s here. Wait, you weren’t with her, were you?”
“Ahhhh!” Greg exclaims, feeling the burn. “He was chatting to Julien a few minutes ago. I don’t know where he’s gone now.”
“Better, I haven't been sick in hours. But to be fair, I don't think there's anything else to throw up,” Sherlock says as he sits down gingerly on the sofa beside John.
“John, are you sure?” Sherlock tilts his head, uncertainty creasing his forehead. It’s almost endearing, but John is too consumed with wanton hunger to smile.
John releases him and opens the box. He promptly takes the heroin out of the box and walks into the loo where he promptly flushes it down. He paces back into the kitchen and stands inches away from Sherlock who’s looking ahead at nothing in particular.
“This is amazing! I mean, I’ve always loved dancing, but it feels incredible right now! Cheers, Greg!” Molly leans in and hugs her dance partner.
. He hired me too. Not an old friend, though. Actually, not sure why he thought I was the man for this job. What do you reckon, am I in for a difficult few weeks?”
“Well, at least this article makes it look like you’re having fun on tour instead of just being an insufferable cock!”
Sherlock lets his head drop back and John brings his hands down to his shoulders, then chest. John is lost in his movements until suddenly Sherlock grabs his hands and stands up.
John stands and walks to the bathroom where he starts running the bath. Sherlock follows a few moments later and begins to drop his sheets and strip down.
“Of course. Julien.” John grimaces from the drink or maybe the news, “Sally’s here. She said she’s here to see you, Molly. I just wanted to warn Sherlock.”
“Well, fine. But Sherlock, you’ll need to stay in hospital for a few days. You’re going to experience some nasty withdrawal symptoms.”
John puts the two pieces of toast on a plate and hands it to Sherlock, then puts two more in the toaster for himself. “And here’s your tea,” he hands the steaming mug over to his friend.
“Well, I’d say that’s a wrap!” Greg exclaims when the new song has finished. “Nice one, Sherlock! I smell a hit. What do you think about the bass?”
“Yes, right back on the main road. Take the 4 to Barbes Rochechouart, then the 2 to Place de Clichy.”
He doesn’t really feel like sitting any longer, and he has an unprecedented yearning for human contact. He reaches for Sherlock’s hand and is pulled to his feet, immediately enveloped in his long, thin arms.
. Well, if you do decide to go on tour, you’ll have enough money for a plane ticket and the downpayment on a house, I assure you,” Mycroft looks down at his watch, “But right now, I must take my leave. Cheerio.”
Sherlock seems to be lacking his usual charisma. He looks as striking as ever, but somehow even paler than usual.
“Great,” Greg scowls, “I’d hoped it hadn’t affected my performance. It wasn’t the best show, was it?” Greg lowers his voice and leans forward, “Sherlock seemed a bit off as well, don’t you think?”
“Why not? Though I think we’ll need to reposition ourselves a bit. Sherlock, trade places with me!” They both stand up, crossing each other in the deepest part of the jacuzzi. Suddenly, Sherlock stops and reaches out to give Molly a brief and unexpected hug.
“Just listen, John. Please. Sherlock will not stay in hospital. I know he won’t. So, either you will stay with him for a few days, just until they leave for the American tour, and help him through this, or he'll go home alone where he’ll try to control his withdrawal symptoms by self-medicating.”
John just nods his head and looks back to the crowd of people, “Right, well. I think I’m going to head back. Is there a metro 'round here?”
They finish their breakfast in comfortable silence, then John pipes up, “You know, it might be nice to get some fresh air while you’re in good shape. Want to go on a walk?”
John lies in his bed, rubbing his temples in the early afternoon sun on Thursday, a bit hungover from Greg and Molly’s visit the night before. The last few days have been tiring with him moving his meagre belongings into the flat and organizing his flight and job interview. The late-night with Greg and Molly, who have unsurprisingly decided to pursue a relationship, was just the straw that broke the camel’s back. He hasn’t yet told Sherlock of his definite plans to go to New Zealand, and John had been actively avoiding him up until the impromptu gathering last night. Not that there had been much of a chance to avoid Sherlock; he'd been out of the flat constantly since his recovery. John wonders if he’s avoiding him as well.
“He hasn't left me alone all night! Then when I started chatting with... well, I don't know his name, he's gone, a friendly Frenchman - he put his slimy hands around my waist and whispered something truly horrible in my ear. When I pushed him away, the bloke I was chatting went toward him. That's when Jim started screaming something in French and the guy turned around horrified and left. Then Jim wrapped his arms around me and I just lost it," Molly recounts, obviously flustered.
Sherlock slowly brings his hand down and wraps his fingers around John’s shaft, gently stroking up and down. John mimics Sherlock’s movements, and soon they’re both stroking at a steady pace, not kissing, but breathing hotly into each other’s mouths.
The next thing he knows, there’s a knock at his door waking him. He ignores it and tries to go back to sleep. Then there’s another insistent knock, “Bloody hell!”
“I’ll go see if I can get her to leave, shall I?” says Molly, “Oh!” Molly shouts, already a little drunk from wine and sambuca. “After this song! This was my favorite song in primary school! Always a romantic at heart, I guess! Greg, would you do me the honour?”
John takes a shower, makes some more tea, and orders them Chinese takeaway. When they’re finished eating and John has done the washing up, he takes his place next to Sherlock on the sofa after turning on some music.
“Plenty of water! Yes, you’ve only said it a hundred times, mate!” Greg laughs and slaps John on the back.
John suddenly feels guilty. Sherlock needs him and he’s moving to bloody New Zealand in a couple of weeks.
John muses to himself as he looks out the window of the tour bus. He’s never been to Paris, and he hopes he’ll get to see a bit of the city. They’re about an hour away from their destination, and a day away from the band’s first gig of the tour. It’s early morning as John looks out onto the pastoral landscape, tinged pink by the dawn sky. Everyone seems to be sleeping, save the driver and John himself.
“You too.” They look at each other as though daring the other to go first. Sherlock breaks the tension with a passionate kiss, tucking his hands down the waistband of John’s pants to caress his naked arse. He lets go and swiftly removes his own trousers and black boxer briefs, standing fully exposed in front of John. John looks at Sherlock and exhales, “Oh, God.”
“Ok, well, good. There was that picture… I thought maybe you two had some kind of...thing. No?" John looks at Sherlock questioningly, "No. Okay, nevermind. ”
“What? No!” John shakes his head, “No! I’m offering to keep an eye on you, make sure you don’t fall asleep in there!”
John leans in close to whisper into Sherlock’s ear, “I’m an army doctor, I could break every bone in your body while naming them.” Sherlock stops struggling and his shoulders deflate.
A couple of hours later, Sherlock awakens to a light knock at the bedroom door, Greg poking his head in.
“Right,” John chuckles, “Says the man who’s afraid of nothing. Up there on stage baring your soul to thousands of people every night. With your cool clothes and your...cheekbones.”
It’s a cool, windy night and they can hear the leaves of the trees rustling somewhere in the distance. John looks up at the clear sky, the moon and the stars visible, “There’s Orion’s Belt.”
leaving.” John grabs his keys and storms down the stairs. Once on the street, he looks back to the flat.
Readers of Melody Maker, after just two singles, voted Velvet Britain’s brightest hope, ranking them third among live acts and sixth in voting for best band.
Sherlock continues his efforts until John feels electric pulses shoot through his body, “I’m going to - oh, god,” he rasps as he grabs roughly Sherlock’s hair with both hands. The orgasm is long and hard and John feels relief like he’s never experienced, years of lone wanking not preparing him for the intense sensation of orgasming from another person’s mouth. When he comes back to the present moment, he realises that he hadn’t had the wherewithal to pull out. He looks down at Sherlock, wiping his lips.
“You’ve taken care of her during a recent drug problem, not in New Zealand, I assume. She’ll have gone there for a fresh start. Recently. That, and in Paris you mentioned you don’t talk much.”
Sherlock looks up at John indignantly but smiles when he sees the playfulness in John’s expression. “So what about your sister then, is she in London?” Sherlock asks as John begins to remove the spent drip.
“Should I?” John tries to smile. Sherlock just kisses him in response, then drops to his knees and begins to undo John’s belt. “Alright?”
Sherlock moans with the increased pressure, and John begins incorporating his thumbs and the heel of his hands to work the movement up Sherlock’s neck. His face is hovering over Sherlock’s head, and he doesn’t resist the urge to inhale, curious if Sherlock still smells of the herbal shampoo. There’s a faint whiff of lavender, but no tobacco, which is replaced by a sweet musky smell. John is suddenly self-conscious and pulls back to begin massaging Sherlock’s middle and lower back.
“I could... give you a massage, if you like,” John clears his throat, “I do owe you one, you know, from Amsterdam,” John frowns then chuckles nervously, "but we don't have to talk about that right now."
In one swift movement, he spins Sherlock around, pressing him up against the wall with a light thud. He plants a chaste, yet rough kiss on Sherlock’s lips, before licking along the wet seam. The heat rises in his John’s cheeks as his tongue touches Sherlock’s again; teasingly at first, then firmer, more determined, as if seeking something he could only reach deep within. Their tongues roll against each other, and John swallows a groan of pleasure as he presses deeper.
John thinks distractedly. He’s actually so lost in his thoughts that he hardly notices the woman with long bright red hair speaking to him.
happened.” Sherlock leans back into the sofa, “You know I’m often bored with the mundane, and though I might not project it, I firmly believe we should take any pleasure we can squeeze out of life. Of course, as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone.”
“I’m honoured,” John is suddenly glowing with love for his new friends. Before he can say any more, Molly’s arms are encircling him, then he’s hit with Greg’s stronger embrace.
“I think it is,” Sherlock says dismissively, “I just think most people are too closed-minded to accept that.”
John’s eyes flash open, fixing on Sherlock’s intensely for two or three beats before he distractedly brings his attention back to the kiss.
“Could you scratch my back? Just lightly. It’s something my grandmother used to do for me when I was a child. That, is if you don't mind...”
Sherlock scoffs, “I wouldn’t say that. In fact, I’m quite afraid of failure, if I’m being honest. It pushes me to work hard, maybe too hard sometimes. Feeling like this right now, I can’t see the use of it,” He sits down next to John on the edge of the bed.
Sherlock looks back at the table behind him and sits, looking back up at his friend who is now approaching him.  When John stops in front of Sherlock, his gaze is so close that it shifts back and forth from Sherlock’s left to right eye.
John takes in her looks; she’s quite young, petite and curvy. Flirting with her could be fun, a good distraction from… what has him such in a strop, anyway? He doesn’t quite understand, or more aptly, doesn’t want to examine why he has such a bad taste in his mouth.
“I don’t read French, but the magazines seem to be implying it, and he has quite a reputation for drugs and debauchery and," John sighs, "I want to know if you're using with him."
“I’m not doing it for money, you berk. I’m doing it because you’re my friend,” John reaches out to pat Sherlock’s knee, avoiding eye contact.
“Remember, only 20 minutes at a time! We don’t want to run the risk of dehydration. And we’ll need -” John is interrupted as he, Molly and Greg stand waiting for the jacuzzi to fill up.
The commotion's by the bar. Greg is pushing Jim away from Molly as Anderson wraps his arms around her.
John starts at Sherlock’s shoulders, which are very tight indeed. He kneads lightly until Sherlock pipes up, “I’m not an invalid, You can go harder.”
John tries to follow the rest of the episode. He’s not sure he’s understood, but it seems as though Sherlock was right.
“You know, if I were capable of embarrassment, I’d be mortified by the frequency at which you’ve taken care of me lately.”
“Well, the idiot refused to stay in hospital, and we couldn’t let him go through this alone, could we?”
“And I’m supposed to believe that your military career is all there is to you?” Sherlock turns to fix his eyes on John's.
. The acoustics in the larger venue give their music a haunting quality, and the band really know how to play off the cheering audience, particularly Sherlock. For someone who makes it very clear that he’s often bored, on stage he’s the embodiment of charisma and charm. He sings and moves like he’s sharing his deepest secrets with close friends rather than thousands of strangers. His tight jeans and black fitted t-shirt are a sharp contrast to the others’ more grunge-influenced look, and John muses to himself that Sherlock’s lithe, darkly-clad figure wouldn’t look out of place in the 70’s punk scene - minus the pins and studs, of course. The music, however, is distinctly modern; moody, yet polished.
“Hmmm. Maybe I could get Mycroft to send his massage therapist our way. On second thought, that would require talking to Mycroft.” Sherlock smiles sluggishly.
John hesitates, then reaches forward to cup Sherlock’s face. Their lips come together, hard and rough for an instant, then soft and searching. Sherlock brings his hands down to the nape of John’s neck and they match each other’s pace.
“Not now, Mycroft! Surely you’re not thinking of business when your brother’s in bloody hospital! What's happened anyway?”
“It is!” he insists. “It’s full of double entendre and cynicism. And the rhythm's quite hypnotic, isn’t it?”
“Her name’s Harry, short for Harriet. She’s in New Zealand with her girlfriend. Clara’s from there.”
at Bagley’s and Jim was there with some of his cronies. He got to my drink backstage after the show, had to have. I've had another overdose on Rohypnol. Quite a lot of it.”
“Ah, yeah, that’s nice. Very soft. I didn’t know hair could be that soft. It feels like...flower petals,” He laughs at his poetic observation, though he’s lost all the self-consciousness he was holding on to. He leans over, closes his eyes, and breathes in.
John has never had any interest in kissing a bloke, but his desire is undeniable at this moment. Right now he wants nothing more than to feel the texture of Sherlock’s lips against his own again.
it’s not due to my posh public school. My maternal grandmother was French. I visited her in the summers growing up and we would walk the city. She was like a talking encyclopedia. Some of my fondest memories are here with her.”
“No... No, It’s fine,” John looks at Sherlock reassuringly, “Like I said, It’s all fine. Just talking. How are you feeling?”
"Of course not," Sherlock smiles, "But yes, that would be amazing. That is if you're sure you don't mind?"
There’s the familiar sound of the piano, the guitar melody, Greg on bass, and that voice. John sighs.
“Sorry to break up...whatever this is,” Greg says, startling John into snapping his eyes open. Molly looks down at the glass in her hand.
“Yeah, actually,” Molly chimes in. “I do forget. You’re more like an old friend. It’s like we’ve known you forever. You’re really lovely, John. And so kind!” She grins widely.
“Yeah, go on then!” John gets up and flops onto his stomach on the bed. Sherlock walks over and sits on the back of his legs.
“Yeah, well. I guess we’re all sort of mates,” John looks to Sarah’s hand, “Hey, I think I’ll have a drag of that after all.”
“No, I just,” Sherlock sits up and leans across John to retrieve the lubricant that they had used for the massage a few days before. He pours the liquid into his hand before taking John’s in his, slicking them both.
The next thing John knows he’s awake in the blue light of morning, feeling a bit disorientated. He startles for a second when he feels the warmth of another body next to him, but when he turns over to see Sherlock sleeping soundly, curls tousled and lightly snoring, the night comes slowly into focus.
John looks at his mug of tea, “I don’t regret it if that’s what you’re thinking. It’s just, this is not something I’ve ever… given much thought to.” John clears his throat and licks his lips, “I’m not gay,” John turns to look his friend in the eyes. “I know you’re not either, but it’s different for me. I’ve never even been... turned on by another man.”
Sherlock manages to eat a bit and is now back on the sofa covered with every sheet and duvet he could find. Mrs Hudson helps John with the washing up and excuses herself back to her flat. John walks over to Sherlock and places his hand on his forehead, “You feel a bit warm.”
“Of course,” John sighs and rubs his free hand over his face, “Of course I’ll be there. Where is he?”
“Well, looks like I’ve walked in on something. Do I need to leave?” Sherlock shouts from the doorway.
. Quite tongue-in-cheek. There’s a funny story about this song, actually. Serge Gainsbourg first recorded this with his mistress, Bridget Bardot, but when her husband got word of the liaison that inspired the song, Bardot begged Gainsbourg not to release it. What you hear is the second recording. The remake with his wife.”
Molly blushes and looks down at her feet. Sherlock turns to Greg with disdain, “Fuck off, Greg! You know how it is, anything to sell one of these idiotic magazines you seem to enjoy spending  money on.”
“Okay, your highness! Nevermind that I’m just here to check on you! You know, I don’t believe for a minute that you were drugged! I knew you’d be back at it. I’m surprised you haven’t called
John holds Sherlock’s hand over the sink and rinses off the traces of blood, gently opening the cut just to make sure there are no shards of glass or debris. Sherlock watches him intently as he works, eyes narrowed. When he sees that the wound is clean, he pours some rubbing alcohol over it.
“I’m going home, John. I know Mycroft had a word with you just before you came in. You’re going with me, yes?”
John’s hands go lax for a moment before he takes Sherlock’s cock back in one hand and his balls in the other, squeezing lightly. Sherlock cries out in pleasure and moves his free hand between John’s legs, using his fingertips to apply gentle pressure to his perineum.
John follows Sherlock up the stone staircase and onto the small street outside the club where Sherlock lights up a Benson. “Would you like one?”
“Well, I’ve never really given it much thought. My sister’s gay, I’m not. It’s always seemed kind of black and white,” John ponders silently for a moment. “So you would be just as likely to fall in love with a man as a woman?”
“Now, I’m going to go make us some tea and grab a book and I’ll be right back. Try not to fall asleep while I’m gone.”
,” John laughs. “At the moment, I’m just chuffed to see Paris. I’ve never been,” John says, looking wistfully out the window onto the grey highway at all the small French cars speeding by.
“Molly, do me the pleasure of being my dancing partner again?” Molly hops up and takes Greg’s hand immediately. John sits up to watch them, Greg in his green pants and Molly in her black knickers and bra.
After confirming Greg’s glucose levels are back to normal, he heads toward Sherlock’s room and knocks. The door opens, and John is taken aback - Sherlock’s hair is dishevelled, there are dark circles under his eyes, and a patina of sweat coats his face. He looks absolutely awful.
“I don’t actually smoke, that was sort of an excuse to follow you to the roof that night.” John grins ruefully.
“Yes, besides getting drugged by that bastard. Anyway, does he really hate you that much to… try to kill you or whatever he was thinking?”
A few minutes pass in quiet consideration, then Sherlock suddenly walks in. “We’re replacing Jim. That vile buffoon will never be around you again, Molly. Ricky’s talking to him now.”
John looks across the room to Sherlock, who’s stood by the drinks table chatting to Julien, “Yeah, noticed that. Do you think he’s all right?”
Sherlock jumps up and walks over to his brother, “Thank you, now I'm sure you're very busy, best not dawdle!” Sherlock says as he pushes Mycroft toward and out the door.
“Ok, take these,” he says, handing Sherlock the pills, which he swallows instantly without water. “You really shouldn’t do that if you’re experiencing any stomach issues! Water!”
“Yeah, well. I’ve been busy trying to figure things out, a job and such. Plus I didn’t want to bother you.”
“That’s precisely what I’d like to speak to you about. I’m sure he’ll fill you in on all the details, but what I need to know is, will you stay with him? As a doctor and his friend? As I’m sure you know, since the two of you have become quite,” Mycroft clears his throat, “intimate during the tour -”
John hesitantly raises his left hand and hesitates before bringing his fingertips to Sherlock's cheekbones.
“Well, that has been part of it for me, I suppose. But I’ve realized certain drugs not only hurt me, but my… my
“Too many clothes,” Sherlock mutters into John’s mouth as he gently pulls John’s layers over his head before leaning in to envelop him. Sherlock brings a hand up to John’s short hair and plants a kiss on his forehead before reuniting their mouths. John’s hands are back on Sherlock’s arse, massaging and pushing their erections together. Sherlock grabs the other man’s cheeks, grinding lightly, creating even more friction. He moans deeply into John’s mouth before whispering,  “Just let me make you feel good, John. Do you trust me?”
“Yes, well.” John looks up at Sherlock for a moment, surprised at the emotion he's seen from the man tonight.
“We’ve got to get rid of Jim. This isn’t the first time he’s been inappropriate with Molly, and he could have seriously hurt Sherlock tonight, or worse with that broken bottle," declares Greg.
Sally takes a few steps over toward John, “Piss off, John. I’m here to see Molly.” She takes a drag of her cigarette then flicks it to the ground before she turns back to Anderson.
“So you say, but you’re always -” John is interrupted as he closes the refrigerator door with a loud thud.
John closes his eyes tight and takes a deep breath. When he opens his eyes, Sherlock’s looking over his left shoulder at him, soberly.
Sherlock painstakingly makes his way to lie face-down on the sofa, and John awkwardly gets on his knees between his spread legs to have access to his back before squeezing the shiny liquid in the unmarked bottle into his palms. He rubs his hands together.
“Well, most of the city. Some vigorous exercise will be good for your condition, don’t you think? It will also help you recover from the hangover you’re so obviously suffering from today,” Sherlock quips, eyes sharply turning to Greg.
"How can you be so sure? Someone or something needs to scare the shit out of that little weasel! You should go to the police."
They don’t speak any more while John packs up the kit, but just as John’s zipping up his case Sherlock asks, “Want to watch some bad Dutch telly?”
“I was thinking about checking out the red light district…you know, there are a lot of historic buildings there,” Anderson responds seriously.
The following evening, John is backstage at the Bataclan with Ricky while the band do a soundcheck on stage.
He sits up and scratches his head before getting up and walking to the door. He looks through the peephole and sees Sherlock leaning against the doorframe. He flings open the door,  “I was sleeping!”
“Oi, Sherlock! You could share!” Greg shakes his head and laughs. The band, Ricky, and John are all backstage winding down after their final performance in Europe.
“Honestly, John," he says, rolling his eyes, "Didn’t we get past seeing each other naked in Amsterdam? I didn’t know you were able to delete memories as well.”
“Two nights ago, and I didn’t feel any adverse effects until last night when I woke up in a cold sweat, heart racing, and quite nauseated. I wasn’t able to sleep through the rest of the night. Today the gastrointestinal issues have mostly cleared up, but I feel anxious. As I’m sure you can see, I’m sweaty and I’m shaking,” Sherlock holds out his shaky hand, “I would really appreciate it if you could give me something to sleep.”
John’s anger resurfaces momentarily before he looks at Sherlock, who is obviously truly miserable. This softens him a bit. “Try me.”
“Oh, I’m John,” he grabs a beer and starts to walk away, then thinks he should be polite. He turns around to talk to her, hoping to improve his mood. “What’s yours?”
“Well, looks like hers have definitely kicked in!” Greg snickers, “But true enough. It’s been great having you with us, John. As a doctor and as a friend.”
, basking in the sensuous pleasure. Soon, Molly and Greg pick up their "we’re so lucky" conversation.
The water is gloriously warm and bubbly. John closes his eyes to take in all the sensations, vaguely listening to Molly and Greg, who are deep into fervent conversation about how lucky they are to be experiencing the kind of success that allows them to travel luxuriously around Europe. He silently agrees, then his thoughts are interrupted when he feels the most delightful sensation in his left foot.
John scowls up at Sherlock, “You think I seem like someone who doesn’t have any friends then? Right. Nice,” John looks down at his feet.
“I’m full of surprises, John,” Sherlock meets his eyes then smirks, turning up his coat collar against the Spring chill.
’s frontman, Sherlock Holmes has been breaking hearts (or at least breaking in mattresses) all over Europe! Sherlock has been spotted cosying up to bandmate, Greg Lestrade and an adorable mystery man (
He’s never considered emigrating, but New Zealand has a certain new world freshness that appeals to him. Since Harry wrote to him about her local clinic in Christchurch urgently seeking a physician, he has gone from completely discounting the idea, to seriously considering it. He’s been back from Europe for nearly two weeks now and job prospects are not looking promising. The one NHS clinic he felt really good about had called him for a second interview, only to choose another applicant instead. When this opportunity had fallen through, he briefly considered joining Velvet for their American tour. It would be great money, sure, but he’s uncertain whether it would be the right move for him.
Back in Sherlock’s room, John feels warm all over. It starts in his feet and travels up his legs, into his chest, neck, and finally to his head where he notices a fuzzy vibration behind his eyes. It’s too much, and he lies down on Sherlock’s bed where he suddenly feels like he’s under the sun, wrapped in a cloud. There’s so much energy coursing through his head and body that he has the urge to pour it out, like a teapot about to overflow. He sits up, sweating, but not unpleasantly - he’s hot and cold at the same time. He thinks about removing excess clothing, then realizes there is none; he’s only wearing his red boxer shorts.
“What?! Why? Is he all right?” John’s chest suddenly feels heavy and there’s a tingling sensation in his hands and feet.
John waves his hand in the general direction of the room and opens the door wider. Sherlock follows him in.
Sherlock smiles, “That won’t be necessary. Mycroft's had a word with him. He won't be bothering me again.”
he thinks, but he’s not sure if that’s what he really wants. This train of thought, however, gets him thinking that today is the last day he’ll see Sherlock in who-knows-how-long. Not just Sherlock, but Greg and Molly too. His heavy heart makes him wonder if skipping out on the American tour and moving to New Zealand is a good move, but it’s a bit late to second guess himself now.
When John shuts his eyes, Sherlock stands and moves behind his chair, bringing his hands up to either side of John’s head. His fingers are spread wide, and he presses down lightly, moving his hands up with a shampooing-like motion.
After a few minutes, Sherlock drops John’s foot and declares, “I’m going to take a shower. A bit overheated,” He gets up with a slosh. His usual alabaster skin is pink and his face flushed. John notices that both sets of cheeks have the same rosiness. He averts his eyes when he realises he’s staring.
Only at that moment does John remember the scar from Bosnia on his shoulder. For once, he feels no shame or self-consciousness, only gratitude to be alive to experience this physical and emotional connection.
“No, no, it’s fine. I’m fine. Go back to Julien. I just wanted to warn you that Sally was hanging about.”
It’s more hugging than dancing to the slow melody, and John leans into the sound of the organ, experiencing pure exhilaration with every note. He’s startled by the sound of a woman moaning.
The room is cool and empty when John wakes to the sound of rain falling through the open window. He checks his watch; it's 9 am. He’s got an hour before he has to be at the bedsit for the walk-through and to turn in his keys. He rolls over and rubs his face.
John hesitates a moment, then says reluctantly, “Mycroft, I’m actually thinking of going to New Zealand to work. My sister’s there.”
“I’m doing well - despite what you found earlier -  and much of that’s thanks to you. I’m going to stay clean. Well, you know,” He smiles, “stay away from heroin and Rohypnol at least.”
John looks down and brushes a stray curl from Sherlock’s head before withdrawing his hand. He looks at Sherlock with a tenderness the other man does not expect.
, This is the Day, a blast from the past - 1983 to be exact. Now, I've got something new for you!" The animated radio host announces.
). But that’s nothing compared to his intimate moment with Velvet's new drummer, Julien Delaplace. Rumour has it that Britain's hottest rockstar has left Sally Donovan from the punk band
“Hmmm. You can stay here, you know. I’ll be in America - even if I wasn’t. Until you leave for New Zealand, that is.”
They’re still for a moment, then Greg breaks the embrace, “Jacuzzi, anyone?” And before waiting for a response, he strips down completely naked and jumps in.
He looks back to the dance floor, then around for Sherlock. He’s still not in the flat as far as he can see. John walks over to the fridge to grab a beer to rid his mouth of the bitter taste. As he opens the door and peers in, he hears his name and jumps with surprise.
Sherlock looks down at him, a soft smile on his face. “Sorry, music.” Sherlock pulls away to change the album.
What’s sure is Britain's favourite frontman is having a great time and putting on one hell of a show all over Europe!
“Of course not, I’ve been tapering down slowly. I thought I had the exact schedule down to avoid any withdrawals, but obviously,” Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Even
John bolts upright from somewhere between sleep and wakefulness as Sherlock walks into the sitting room.
“Listen, I have a great idea. Hot tub back at the hotel!” Greg smiles widely, “Actually, I have the room intended for Sherlock, but this idiot prefers smaller rooms, apparently.”
The kiss is a frenzied and impatient, but also deep and lascivious. When John pulls back to look at Sherlock this time, his expression could be mistaken for a man on the verge of committing murder. Sherlock wonders for a second if John might actually strike him, but a quick deduction - tight grip, pulse racing, eyes nearly black, the hardness he feels pressing against his thigh – tells him that desire, not anger, is the overriding force guiding his friend.
