“We held a funeral,” James’ father finished the tale solemnly. “We burned their bodies and sent their ashes back through the portal to their own ruined earth. Can you understand now our mistrust? Can you understand why we tagged you, why we needed some form of control? They didn’t actually accomplish much—but they nearly killed James.” His dad turned his gaze to him, and James stared back resolutely. It had been difficult to listen to the story again. It was the first time they had really mentioned it since it had happened. After everything they’d thrown it under the rug, never to look at it again. It had been even more difficult to tell his part of it—that he’d run back in the house for Kate’s teddy bear, that widow had caught him, that he’d been dragged into the living room while a version of his own father grabbed him by the neck and counted down to his own death. But his father hadn’t wanted to speak for him, and had asked him to take over for that part. He could feel the looks of pity focused in his direction; he ignored them as best he could.
“No?” Tony asked. “Then you and I have very different definitions of the word ‘hero’. You’ve stepped in this house again and again and again even with the Alts here. And that—that takes a special kind of bravery, James.” James just shrugged, examining his gift instead. Tony put a hand over his. James reluctantly met her gaze. “I’m sorry, you know. About how you found out. If I’d known you were coming home, I would have warned you.” James shrugged.
“I was never in the boy scouts,” Steve said, his hands fumbling over the buttons of his shirt. He’d at least figured out at this point that there was nothing sexual going on. Well, there might have been, but if there was this was the oddest foreplay Steve had ever encountered.
“If the boot fits…” he trailed off, that familiar wicked glint in his eye. Only Clint would be so bold as to tease the Commander of the 3490 universe. Everyone else in her universe, and rightly so, was a little wary of him.
“GUYS!” Francis shouted. Finally Steve and Tony shut up. Steve looked at the boy, whom everyone was staring at. “Has, uh, has anyone seen Peter?”
“Cookies. We’re making cookies. You know. For Santa,” Peter intervened. Agent Hill arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow.
“Wanted to see what made Tony’s armor tick. I noticed you don’t have Extremis,” 3490 Steve said, still smiling. “I get it. But her lab isn’t to be messed with. You should get that.” Tony felt like he was six years old again.
“Oh. Oh, I’m sorry. I should have thought about—they said you all only had six Avengers back in your world, but I didn’t think about—you know, Steve, it’s a long story,” Bucky said, stumbling over himself. There was something different about him. Of course there would be—they were separated by universes and by years and years of age—but Steve felt like it was something
It was strange, hearing the loud, high-pitched alarm going off. For all the emergencies Steve had sat through in this universe, he’d never heard an
“Yes. It resembled the Tesseract, but it was much smaller,” Clint replied, demonstrating with his hands an estimation of the size.
“1990…26 years ago in this timeline,” Other Steve said slowly. She could see the pained look on his face. It was subtle, but it was there in the set of his mouth, the look in his eyes. It was yet another twenty years that he had missed in his universe. “The Avengers didn’t form immediately, then.” Tony nodded.
“Thank you,” his father spoke quietly, so quietly it was more of a vague deep rumble than anything else, almost mistakable for a quiet sound from sleep. But James heard it.
The kids were not, however, the only lively ones at the table. Thor always made breakfast interesting, considering that he could drink a whole pot of coffee himself and eat as much in one meal as Tony did in several days. On this particular morning, there had been only one packet of strawberry PopTarts left in the cabinet. It created a crisis situation in which Kate crossed her arms and stared at Thor until he handed it over. It was obvious that, while he was happy to do the ‘honorable’ thing and give the PopTarts to the young girl, it pained him to do it. James and Peter had nearly engaged in a fistfight over the last piece of bacon (which Natasha then snatched whilst they were arguing and smiled as she ate it, as if
“I’m ready to be done with all this,” Steve said with a sigh. All of the Avengers from their universe, with a plus one of Kate, sat in seats in the back of a SHIELD aircraft, already most of the way to Sokovia. The plan, as outlined by Fury, had been rather simple. Nobody was ‘playing 5D chess here’ as Clint had joked (whatever that meant). They were, instead, going to knock on the door while a small subset of them snuck around back.
“Seventy-six hours ago,” JARVIS replied. It was the first time Tony had heard the AI’s voice in the mansion.
to know about her father’s life before their family. Anything historical she could want to know was already inevitably written down in some biography somewhere, and the personal things were clearly just too painful.
“I didn’t mean to cut so deep, honey,” she said. “I’m just frustrated. Kate’s been driving me up the wall since you’ve been gone. I didn’t mean to fight with you. I don’t
“You know, the old Cap comics left out the whole ‘vaporizing guns’ thing,” Tony said through the comms when they arrived on the scene, just after a Hydra agent demonstrated their weapon on a nearby car.
“Do not concern yourself with such earthly problems, Captain,” the Red Skull spoke. “You and I are above such considerations. We are as Gods. We cannot be buried.”
is right here—is this one new, Fury? He’s new, isn’t he. Call off your dogs,” Other Tony told Other Fury, shoving the gun away. The agent shoved it back. Tony couldn’t remember the agent’s name, but she’d have to remind him of his place and his conduct later. It was
It was three in the morning when Tony heard the door to the library open and the subsequent cursing from his double upon seeing him inside.
“So you assume it’s bad news?” James asked. “Thanks, little sis. Glad to know you have such faith in me.”
,” Commander Rogers said emphatically. “Do you want to go? There’s the door, Stark. Walk right on out, I won’t stop you. None of you concern me unless you’re jeopardizing the safety of others. You want to leave, you go ahead and leave. Sure would save Tony and I on the grocery bill.” Commander Rogers stood, still looking monumentally pissed off. “I get that this whole damn universe must feel like a prison to you. But believe me, Stark, we want you gone more than you even want to go. If I could toss you all back where you came from today without risking a cataclysm I would
“Right, there’s your answer. Go do your homework,” Steve insisted. Peter put down the controller and got up off the couch.
Peter sat on the couch in the safehouse, his knees drawn up to his chin, his toes gripping the edge of the cushion. He wasn’t really seeing or hearing anything at all; he knew that Benjamin, Azari, and Francis were busy getting some of the younger kids to bed. Some of the kids closer to Peter’s age—Billy, Teddy, Tommy, Valeria, Franklin, Lyra—sat in the living area with him, though none of them sat directly beside him. Torrun sat at the far end of the couch, occasionally glancing over at him and looking worried. He knew that the Alt Avengers were crowded around the kitchen table, drinking coffee MCU Bruce had brewed and speaking quietly to one another. He knew that his sister was washing blood off of herself at the kitchen sink since James—far more covered in blood than anyone else—was in the only shower and the little kids were taking turns in the other bathroom.
“What, so the world can’t hear? So our team can’t hear or so the Alts can’t hear? Because I can guarantee they’ve been exposed to worse, we’ve already aired all our dirty laundry, what’s one more thing?” 3490 Steve said, and this time he seemed angry about something Tony didn’t personally understand.
kids. She did fine with kids. She’d stumbled her way through Peter and Kate’s childhoods, having had Jamie occasionally to practice on. She wasn’t a great mother, but she did ok. She loved her children, and Steve made up for her failings more often than not. But Peter had clearly been having problems at school that she had never noticed. Kate was having difficulties of her own that Tony didn’t understand. She wasn’t doing so great in the homestretch in raising teenagers to adults. She highly doubted she would do any better in a second round.
making weapons, because HammerTech, the only stuff we were left with, is crap as you know and our boys were getting their asses kicked out there for a while.”
—they might have been living, but were they separate, sentient beings? But these green guys—Thor had called them
“Ok, but I can guarantee even though you can’t get drunk you can still get high,” Kate pointed out before drawing another. Steve began his sketch of the tree, trying to feign some disinterest in the girl. She reminded him solidly of his own universe’s Tony, and if there was anything Tony hated more than being handed things, it was serious conversation. So he decided he must pretend not to care, at least a little bit, and maybe she wouldn’t notice that she was having a serious conversation.
saying something. But there was no doubt that falling into bed with his teammate, Tony Stark, after being dumped in an alternate universe where they were married to each other really took the cake. He’d marveled at it some when they’d laid in bed afterwards, when his heart was racing with that sudden anxiety of
“You were defending yourself, Peter,” MCU Steve said. “It was an accident, and you were defending yourself, your family, the people on the streets.”
“I expect so, if it’s anything like our Safehouse Three,” Agent Coulson said. “Expansion might be advisable.” There was a tense pause, though Agent Coulson for one looked as unflappable as usual. James couldn’t even see a single soot stain on his suit. Pepper looked terrified; her high heels dangled from her hand, long since removed. Jane looked exhausted, resting her head against Thor’s chest as he ran a hand through her hair. Agent Hill’s usually perfect bun was a mess, and she had a long cut across one cheek. MCU Bruce looked like he was doing his best to stay calm. MCU Steve, Clint, and Natasha were all in various states of disrepair. They were exhausted and worn out and James knew, looking at them, that not a single one of them would fight him on this. If he turned them away, they would walk away, weary and defeated, without ever raising a hand to him. Ultimately, though, it was looking at MCU Tony that got to him. Being a guy, he didn’t look a thing like the Tony he knew—except in the eyes. The eyes were the same. And those eyes were tired. If James turned them away now, weaponless, homeless, and friendless, it was practically a death sentence. Maybe he could have given that death sentence to the rest of them. But he wasn’t about to be the reason another Tony died that day.
“If I’ve overstepped my bounds, ma’am, I’m very sorry—” Steve started, feeling humiliation sink in his stomach. She knew. She
“I’m not about to get distracted by your ramblings,” Steve said, half amused even through his concern.
get a bad grade Mom threatens to stop letting me go to parties, or take away ballet lessons, or ban me from training with Francis and Clint for a month.” Kate flopped back onto her stomach. “Speaking of, our report cards are coming out soon and I’m probably dead.” She basically muttered that last, head stuck into Peter’s pillow. It smelled like her shampoo because Peter’s had run out a week ago and he was too lazy to buy more and instead kept stealing from her shower. Which probably explained the tampons thing.
. And Kate? Christ, what were you thinking just cutting and running on her? On any of us?” James asked.
“This area was evacuated last week,” a voice replied beside her. It was her father, staring at the building, expressionless. Kate felt goosebumps rise on her skin. “The only ones inside were Hydra. And maybe Peter. His last GPS ping came from over there.” Her father pointed just a bit of the way down the road. “And then we lost him. But Hydra was swarming inside this building.”
“I say we make a break for it,” Natasha said. All of the 3490 kids were in bed, except for James and Azari, who had gone down to the gym on the lower level. The safe house was small—it had three tiny bedrooms, two bathrooms, a little kitchen, a small living room with a couch and a television (unconnected to any channels, but there was a DVD player and a small bookcase of DVDs), and an equally tiny gym in the basement. It had clearly been designed for just a few SHIELD agents, and not for much of an extended stay. The 3490 kids had crammed into the bedrooms, leaving the living area for the MCU Avengers and co to settle down in. Steve wished James and Azari would sleep, but he figured they were too wound up to rest. Either that, or they were watching them on security monitors hidden on the lower level—given their little standoff at the entrance, Steve wouldn’t be surprised. James clearly didn’t trust MCU farther than he could throw them, and Steve couldn’t blame him. This was somehow their fault, Steve knew. He just wished he knew
of—of commitment, of a family—shit, you know, I knew Pepper and I were never going to work out anyway, but you should have
“I’ll try his cell, you sweep this floor,” Natasha said, whipping out her own cell phone while Steve swiftly made his way through the crowd and out into the hall. Despite it being one of Stark’s homes—Stark Manor, to be precise—Steve had never been in it before. Nevertheless, he knew the layout well. He walked quickly down the hall, checking room as he went. Empty. Empty. Empty.
It took Steve halfway through her rant to realize she was yelling in Italian. At most, Tony, Steve, and Natasha understood her. More likely only Tony and Natasha did. To everyone else, it sounded like she was spouting nonsense. To everyone else, she had just randomly started attacking 199999. To everyone else, this situation looked very
But not even Tony Stark could break the mood. The Avengers sat in melancholy, listening to the happy music of people laughing upstairs.
, but James knew that inevitably he would bump into him. Despite the fact that Tony and his dad worked constantly, it was always James’ bad luck that they were around when he didn’t want them to be. He pushed open the door and entered the mansion.

not,” Tony pointed out. “Can’t be sparring with me all that time, so there’s only two other explanations and I’d rather them not happen upon either one of them.” Steve blinked.
For everyone curious about what happened with this story, and what happened with me, know that I am fine. My life situation changed quite a bit. I will update the story and finish it at some point, but I have no idea at what point that will be. I sincerely apologize to every reader of this story who has been left hanging for quite some time now. I am unwilling to give a timeline and possibly create further disappointment in doing so.
“Excuse me?” she asked, inherently offended by the question. Her brain initially wondered if Other Clint was right, given her constant paranoia on the subject.
“Peter, it’s five in the morning—what are you doing up?” she asked. She didn’t sound scolding so much as baffled. The boy looked up, startled, and Tony found himself startled in turn by the boy.
“Done,” he said. Perhaps it was improper to bet on who your charge would bring home to sleep with next, but he didn’t honestly think Stark would care even if he knew. Besides, he and Nat had to have
“You’re very bad at storytelling,” he said dryly. Tony laughed, because it was something her Steve would say.
“I—you could have been going hungry or—or—starving yourself on purpose, or—I don’t know, I just wanted—”
dangerous. So I’ve got to follow you and make sure you’re not going to, I don’t know, start shooting up Harlem or something. Start a coup in Manhattan. Assassinate the president. Whatever it is villains are doing these days. But look, there’s really no need to be jumpy. I’m on a date with my wife, ok? I’m not conducting audio surveillance on your conversation.” He gave a lopsided grin. “Trust me, they don’t send the deaf guy for that job. I know you won’t, but you
“Just once, I’d like to handle the tourists,” Tony grumbled. Steve couldn’t help but grin. Some days he wished they could handle the tourists, too. But his grin faded as they continued watching the coverage of everything that was happening outside. Maybe tourists would be a nice, easy job—but there was nothing he wanted more right now than to help the rest of his team and the 3490 kids. They were still exhausted from the previous fight—they couldn’t keep this pace up forever.
and disarming the girl was easy. When he had her gun, he shot his web out to grab the other one just as the thug lunged for it. Peter shook his head and tsked, waving both guns in his hands, and then pointing them at the girl and the thug. Peter had never fired a gun before, and he didn’t intend to do so today. But
“Right,” Francis said. The uncertainty of his tone gave away his hurt, and Kate felt a little pang. “Focusing on the task at hand now, promise.”
“Ok. All right. Relax. Take a breath. It’s your show here, James,” Steve said quietly. James’ breathing slowed. His eyes flicked down to the kids on the floor before flicking back up to meet Steve’s. Their eyes were the same, Steve noticed with a start.
“Very well in fact I’ve been told,” Steve called after him. Peter shrieked and clapped his hands over his ears. The deep blush on Steve’s 199999 counterpart did not escape his notice, either, nor did the raised eyebrows of 199999 Tony as he determinedly stared at his tablet.
I’m a horrible mother, you called me careless and neglectful and—shit, Steve, maybe I am but that’s why I
I think that we all—we all take for granted what we have. We let tiny, petty things get in the way. Or we let big things get wedged in the way and forget that, at the end of the day, what matters most is love. And if you love someone… if you love someone, you work with it if you can. I didn’t always do that. Tony didn’t always do that—we’re all just human, in the end. We forget lessons we’ve learned and end up learning them over and over again, sometimes.
“Everybody’s all good?” he asked. Clint and Natasha nodded, Tony scowled, Bruce looked a bit too calm, and Thor just frowned.
It struck him at that moment that, though they’d been in a different universe for months, and though they’d been fighting enemies from various points of 3490’s timeline, he hadn’t even really thought about the possibility of traveling backwards in time until just then.
“Avengers!” Tony said. “We’re Avengers.” The young man regarded him coldly and removed the safety on the gun. None of the Avengers moved, hoping to soothe the situation before it escalated further.
“Welcome to Stark Tower!” Stark said as the elevator opened its doors. Steve was glad his sunglasses were still on so that the Senator couldn’t see how his eyes bugged out of his head. The penthouse itself was the very definition of modern. It was extremely rich, extremely fancy—all around an indulgence. But what really impressed Steve was the
“Hey,” Kate replied, staring down the shaft of an arrow with incredibly scrutiny, looking for some minute flaw Peter did not comprehend. She tossed it in the rejects pile.
“Never tried, after sleeping until four. Are you going to use the same excuse, or are you going to tell me that sleeping for seventy years was enough for you?” she asked. Young Steve—and that, Tony realized, was probably a more accurate description for him than Other, for he was identical to the Steve Tony remembered, in every way—looked a bit surprised at that, but then seemed to recall who he was talking to. He gave a small smile and shook his head slightly.
“Fat lot of good that’s going to do you. The collapse is exactly what the Skull wants,” he said. Steve sighed. He pulled up another old rolling chair and sat down. Natasha smoothly followed suit.
It had been a close call for Kate, getting back inside the house. Peter had found her on the way in and wrinkled his nose.
“Heard James was around, thought I’d come torture him,” Francis said cheerily. He played with the apple as opposed to eating it, tossing it from one hand to the other.
, he didn’t try to justify or plead or bargain—he just accepted it. Natasha was right, he knew—he was a mess. He was unraveling not at the edges, but at his very seams, the core of him coming completely undone.
If Peter had been thinking more clearly, he probably would have picked a less public location to test his new abilities, but Peter hadn’t really been thinking very clearly. Which was how he ended up on the ceiling of the gym, staring down at an upside down guy version of his mother.
“Woah, easy, we’re not breaking the kid’s bones to see how fast they heal or anything,” Tony said. “We’ve been doing surface tests, for one thing. He sticks to glass.” Bruce whipped around to look at Peter.
business? Ok, here’s one: where’d you get the weed you’ve got stashed in your bathroom behind the tampons?” Peter asked.
Like Stark, the interior of the plane was all about style. It was all very tasteful and very fancy, with leather seats, a flat screen TV, and even a dining area. Senator Stark sat in one of the large leather chairs, a brandy already in his hand.
It was chaos. It was hell. Tony didn’t know if she was going to make it out alive. She was fighting in armor that lacked flight capability, so even if her double managed to get control of her armor, he couldn’t take her up and drop her. She found her double through the haze of tear gas, entirely unarmored. He wasn’t fighting like the others.. He wasn’t in his armor. He was just alone, cut off from everyone else.
understand. Mom’s hands fell away from his shoulders and she went back to sit down on the couch, putting her head in her hands like this was immensely difficult for her. Peter looked to Dad. He couldn’t lie. He felt hurt. He felt
“Yes, perhaps it’s a hint from the heavens—superheroes should never marry other superheroes,” Tony commented. “They end up with bratty children.”
“I’m pretty sure you’re defying the laws of physics right now and it makes me angry,” Tony informed him. He headed back to the machine and used the one weapon he had reserved for this—a lower power laser. He started dismantling the outer casing of the machine. Cap just crossed his arms.
she even pregnant at forty-six? Tony guessed it must have to do with Extremis. It was keeping her body too well conditioned, maybe even slowing the effects of aging. She was going to have to look into that. But what did being pregnant with Extremis even mean? She’d been a regular human when she had Peter and Kate, no extra virus in her system. Would it infect the baby through her bloodstream? Oh, god—were they going to have a kid born with the internet in its head? That could control local electronics and accidentally turn things on or off every time it had a crying fit? A temper tantrum? Tony didn’t even realize she’d stopped walking in the middle of the hallway until Other Clint walked by, an eyebrow raised.
,” Natasha said, exasperated. Clint felt himself redden a bit. He was acting like this was his first mission. She sighed and rolled her eyes. “Well now he’s coming over, nice work Barton. Everybody smile.” Clint couldn’t resist—and why should he, at this point—looking at where his double was coming from.

was in trouble, the subject of his father’s ire. As usual. Well, James figured, at least he’d spared Peter from any additional attention.
the Director?” he said. He seemed unsure as to whether he was addressing his own Tony, or Director Stark. Tony felt her hackles raise. He’d struck a bit of a nerve.
“Don’t—!” Steve yelled leaping for the stone, but he was half a second too late. The space around the three of them exploded in bright blue.
some 5D chess plan, which this was not. Turned out, her instincts had been right. Swallowing her terror, she knocked more arrows. Explosives, again. There was no way, she figured, that they were going to walk out of here alive if Hydra kept pouring through the goddamn entrance to the great hall. Which, really, left her with only one tactic that she could think of. One she’d learned from the Mulan cartoon. There was no 5D chess in that play, either. She had three explosive arrows nocked and aimed up.
It was an echo, Steve knew. He’d heard that before—it came out of his own mouth. He wondered if he’d ever told James that story, ever used that exact wording—or if a younger version of his self, who was
No time to worry about it anymore—it was in the other Captain and Iron Man’s hands now. She looked out before them, at the field of Hydra agents fighting their own numerous forces, and grit her teeth.
“Then we’d all party on the bigger yacht all night, in international waters probably doing things that were only legal because of being international waters—why else go to international waters? I can hear her asking it. That would be more of Tony’s kind of funeral I think. But Tony… Tony was the least selfish person I’ve ever met. And Tony, when she planned all of this out years ago, when she made all the arrangements, she knew that she wasn’t going to be around to see her own funeral. She wasn’t going to be in a position to enjoy partying on a yacht all night. And she knew I wouldn’t want to be partying on a yacht after she died. She knew the
“You’re alive,” he said. He sounded disbelieving. He sounded…oddly relieved. Tony had a gauntlet leveled at him. They were designed for energy blasts, not for flight.
“Never have I ever done pot. Contrary to popular rumor,” Bruce said pointedly to Tony. Tony just grinned and took her own ginger ale shot as three quarters of the circle drank—including Bruce’s alternate.
in front of that bullet. I would’ve been dead. Instantly. And he didn’t even think about it. He just jumped. Even after all that.”
“No. I’m with you to the end. And the end is not today,” Peter said firmly. But even though his words had conviction, inside he had never known such fear. He felt like a scared little boy all over again, and he would give anything for Daddy to come and fix it all for him. But Daddy wasn’t here. “I’m not leaving you. And I’m not going to let you die.” James just smiled at him weakly. And then his eyes rolled into the back of his head. Peter could swear he felt his own heart stop. “James? JAMES! Come back! Come back, come on, you can do this!” Peter yelled at his brother, but he received no response. He moved one trembling hand to his brother’s neck to check his pulse, hardly daring to do it, too frightened of what he might find. There was one still, but it was weak. “James, you can
The alternate Avengers did not stir until well into the afternoon, which of course was not going to help their universe induced jetlag, but Tony couldn’t blame them—she herself had slept until four alongside them. She could have slept longer, but there had been a pleasant sensation at her neck, and she had woken, still half-asleep, to her husband’s kisses. All in all, it wasn’t a bad way to wake up. In fact, it was the way that Tony would prefer to be woken up every morning—but usually her alarm clock or villains plotting to destroy the world had other plans. Still, in that moment when Tony woke up, it was just her and Steve. There was no one else. Kate was not getting into trouble with drugs, there were no alternate avengers living in the mansion beside them—it was just her and Steve, in their own little world. They’d enjoyed themselves for a little while—too little a while, in Tony’s opinion—but eventually had to emerge to face the world. After all, Tony had a whole set of Avengers to send back home.
“It wasn’t meant to be subtle. They know we won’t sit by passively. The louder we are in our attempts the less likely they are to notice the actual work we’re doing,” Natasha said. She looked like she was going to murder someone. Clint understood how she felt. Natasha was really in charge of this whole operation on the Avengers’ side, and so far no one had show the levels of espionage capability they really needed on these ops. Rogers was all right, and Stark sneaky but mostly all guns and tech, but Thor was an oblivious teddy bear, and Jane and Pepper had brilliant minds but no knowledge of strategy. Bruce was the most promising, but his tendency to turn into a giant green monster under pressure was problematic. Clint knew Natasha was practically tearing her hair out working with such an amateur group as far as spying went, and it was not helping that they couldn’t keep in regular communication with the other three to apprise them of their movements. It wasn’t safe—they could text or email, but that would all be monitored. They could take walks together every now and then or have coffee, but Clint had no doubt that if they did they’d be followed or bugged or merely interrupted on a semi-regular basis.
“DEAD!” Peter heard Azari call from off in the distance, and sure enough, seconds later he heard him confirm that Tony was dead over the comm. Peter finally caught sight of Clint. From behind. The man was sneaking through the trees quietly, using them as cover whenever he could. It was clear he was headed towards their flag. Peter circled around, getting in front of him, and then, when the spy least expected it, Peter leapt forward, charging him, hoping to drive him backwards.
“He saved mine back there too,” James said. He still wasn’t really looking at Steve. But Steve could live with that. James was going to live. He’d be fine. That was all that mattered right now.
“How’s everybody holding up in here?” Dad asked. There were shrugs and murmurs of “fine” and similar sentiments. This safe house wasn’t underground—it was in what had appeared from the outside to be an abandoned building, but was really quite a lovely apartment. There were more bedrooms—though everyone still had to share with at least one other person—and enough beds for everyone to have their own. There were windows that looked out into the world, though technology prevented anyone from being able to see inside. It had been a while since they’d had any communication with the Avengers on the outside beyond a few short messages via an encrypted line.
“Yeah? And what the hell would the team do without your tech innovations? What would the team do if we were four on the ground and only

would have regretted the decision. But maybe, just maybe, a tiny part of Steve could admit that their arguing wasn’t about Tony flying off into danger (well, it was, but not
“WE’VE GOT A 757!” one loud and clear shout rang out from the smartpad. Kate felt all the blood drain from her body, her stomach dropping to her feet.
—and I don’t even know your first name. I can’t even google you, Giggles,” Senator Stark said, exasperated.
This was, apparently, a day of surprises for Steve, as when the limo stopped, he realized that they were on the lot of an airport. Out the window he could see a small, presumably private, jet. Special Agent Romanov stood at the bottom of the stairs up to the plane, waiting. Steve got out of the limo and removed his sunglasses.
“Dead,” Peter heard the voice of Alt Clint call. Peter headed in that direction. He could see lightning striking far off in the distance—Torrun and Thor, he guessed.
,” Peter said. He threw his ball up in the air. Kate glared. Kate punched him on the shoulder. He glared right back at her. “Ow.”
“Around that time I was looking into some old HYDRA files. They’d been quiet a while and quiet is never a good sign—usually means they’re plotting something. I didn’t like it,” Fury said. “I decided to check into it on my own. Picked out a few of their old hide outs. I sent some of my guys in. Nobody around here reported anything odd, but my contact in Germany said they’d hit on some strange activity in a
He did, however, have questions for him the next night. Steve was, for once, sipping coffee on the job. He was gratefully that Stark would not be able to see his eyes through his sunglasses—he knew from the mirror earlier that they were red with bags underneath. He hadn’t slept hardly any last night. Well, last morning. Too many nightmares, all about Bucky. Always about Bucky.
with Steve?It was perfect. It also happened to be the perfect opportunity to talk about the Alternate Avengers situation without fear of prying ears—either theirs or other members of SHIELD. And as romantic as Tony and Steve were—well, they were also pretty damn dedicated to their mission.
Steve’s words heralded the end of the meeting, and everyone seemed to know that it was time to dissipate. Steve implored Natasha to restore the surveillance. He was uncomfortable with cutting it in the first place as it would make 3490 suspicious, but with any luck they would understand their need for privacy and not think much of it.
. NO ONE REMEMBERED TO STAY BEHIND WITH ME. YOU REALLY THINK IT’S SAFER ALONE IN THE BUNKER THAN WITH A TEAM OF PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD?” MCU Steve demanded.
In order to keep his brain from rotting, Tony decided that morning to peruse the mansion’s library. He was pleasantly surprised to find that it had been updated—3490 Tony had filled it not just with the classics and antique books that their father had been so fond of, but also with hundreds of science books. He picked one up on the theory of the multiverse and got to reading. Maybe 3490 Tony couldn’t do anything, but maybe 199999 Tony could. He spent the morning reading the book while Pepper sat in the library with him, picking her way through a Jane Austen novel and sipping tea. It was a rare luxury for her, Tony knew, and he was glad she got the chance to kick back.
“I don’t need another therapist, Tony,” Steve said, belatedly realizing that he was using his sandwich-holding hand to gesture sternly, which made him look rather ridiculous.
“Ok, you can lie to yourself, but you’re not going to convince me. So anyway. I don’t do drama. You and Francis? Work it out on your own and leave me out of it, yeah?” Torrun requested.
a me. Just, someone vaguely similar who will drag you to parties. Clint could even drag you to parties. I just mean, you need someone to drag you into the world, is all—”
“Did you come to me because you need someone to moan at about the whole time travel thing and how much your life sucks because I’m really not the guy for that,” Tony said dryly. Steve’s jaw locked. He had a thousand things to say to this asshole and none of them were pleasant, except perhaps one, which was ‘maybe I did’. Steve didn’t know anymore. He didn’t have anyone to talk to. Did he need to talk? He would have talked to Peggy. He would give anything to talk to Peggy. He would make a deal with the Devil himself to bring Bucky back. He could talk to them. Sometimes he talked to Natasha. Or Natasha talked to him, or tried to set him up with women at SHIELD. But mostly he and Natasha just joked, or were busy running missions together. Natasha was probably the closest he had to a friend in this century. But Natasha wasn’t around.
James slunk down into the lab, almost dreading this encounter. Tony hadn’t spoken to him alone since the Kate Incident, and he knew what she was going to say. He felt a knot in his gut. He would deserve everything she could throw at him. Kate should have never been at House of M. James should have
Eventually the cantor stopped leading hymns and the priest stopped talking, and his father rose from the pew and ever so slowly walked his way up to the pulpit.
“Uh, well, it’s chickpea salad. Like chicken salad but with chickpeas instead,” Steve said, looking at the neat little wrap. 3490 Tony just continued to stare at him, so he kept talking. “Uh, it’s chickpea, celery, spring onion, mayo—”
,” James cried out, unable to help himself. Perhaps he should be brave. Perhaps he should be ok with this, with dying for the greater good. But all James could think about just then was that he was about to die and he wanted to
“Well?” Tony asked as soon as he arrived, but he seemed to be the only one who needed to ask—everyone else had taken in Steve’s expression.
“Ease up, Tasha,” Clint said, putting a hand on her lower back to reel her in as well as keep up appearances—they were supposed to be on a date, after all. “Who’d they send after you, Coulson?” Phil just smiled blandly, as ever, though Clint could detect just a
“Tony, what’s going on?” Steve demanded. Her fellow Avengers, surrounded by their children and families, looked at her expectantly.
“I should have clarified yesterday. I also meant, ‘Tony, I know we’re in Vegas, but please do not send
Unfortunately, he hadn’t thought of the fact that the various Avengers and friends would notice him crawling about outside. Rhodey stared as he quickly passed, Jessica Jones dropped her glass of wine. Bruce and Jane broke off their conversation. Peter crawled even faster, dizzy with adrenaline. He was a thousand feet in the air. When he glanced down, the people looked like ants, and the cars were even smaller than his
“‘Cause,” James said. “Then you’d—you’d see differently.” Peter didn’t know if his brother wasn’t making sense because of the pain or because he just wasn’t.
outclassed, which it is, or incredibly smaller in number—which it is—there’s no telling what my double’s tech could do. She could turn us against each other.”
“A team will be too much. They’ll spot a team in no time. I’ll go. Alone,” Natasha volunteered, but it sounded a lot less like an offer and more like a command.
Steve looked up in the sky where he knew he’d find Tony—sure enough, there was Iron Man, dodging a few shots of deadly blue.
There was no one consensus. Thor and Jane were headed to the lab downtown; Bruce had decided to go with them. Natasha and Clint wanted to get some work done in the gym, and Steve wanted to join them. Tony and Pepper had no plans, but would likely end up in the library. Or maybe they would go out into town and do something. It was all up in the air, really. 3490 Tony listened politely, and then smiled.
. He didn’t care if James kicked the crap out of him—he was about three seconds away from punching him in the jaw. But from the other side of the table, unexpectedly, came a sharp reprimand.
“You must be the new alternates,” Bucky spoke. It really was his voice, the same voice Steve remembered, and it tore into his gut. “It’s nice to meet you. I’m James Barnes—Winter Soldier, around here, or just plain Bucky.”
“ Over five painstaking years Columbia’s genetic research facility has fully mapped the genetic codes of each of these spiders. Armed with these DNA blueprints, we have now begun what was once thought—impossible—inter-species genetic transmutation,” the tour guide continued, leading them through the insect room and into another laboratory. Only a few, tiny boxes of spiders were on display, obviously being used in research.
“Hey, you know me, I’m shit at lecturing,” Clint replied, holding up a hand. “I just want to apologize, Katie. I was punishing you when I should have been there for you.”
“I know, I know,” Steve said tiredly. “It’s all the reasons I agreed to this in the first place.” Tony leaned up and kissed him on the cheek.
, they’ve just never gotten solid shots of our faces. Even if they managed it, there’s a blanket gag order on any information involving us. Nobody in their right mind would print it.” Steve was frowning.
“I never asked to be a mother, Kate. And I have never been very good at it, I know that. But I’m what you’ve got. And believe it or not, I am
“Doesn’t change the truth of it,” 3490 Steve said with a sigh. 3490 Tony rose from her seat and stood behind her husband, wrapping her arms around his shoulders and planting a gentle kiss on his cheek.
“Ok, scary thought. Look, Natasha is fantastically efficient. She has a great mind for tactics. She knows what she’s doing and I’m
. You don’t have to get shot at more than the other guys just because you’re a little faster and stronger,” Kate said. James shook his head.
to land directly in the middle of the SHIELD helicarrier. Or perhaps they had been aiming for another universe entirely—it wasn’t like she was expecting visitors today. The Other Avengers just stared around blankly for a moment. Other Tony was the first to snap out of it and speak up.
“I shouldn’t have acted the way I did after…everything,” Clint said. “I’m sorry, Katie-Kate. I should know better than anybody that sometimes we fuck up and that doesn’t define us as people.”
“Oh, so this is on me?” her mother demanded. “I don’t think so.” She handed the report card back. “Anything that’s not an ‘A’ I want to see improved at least a letter grade before I even
would always be with him in spirit and this was a reminder. James had been thrilled with the present. He’d worn his father’s tags for months under his clothes until his mother, worried that he would lose them, insisted he keep them at home for safe keeping. She had bought him the little wooden box to keep them in, and they had occupied a prominent place on his shelf for years. He used to keep the top open and grab them whenever he missed his dad, just keeping them in his hand. James knew every groove and divot on those tags. When he moved to New York, he brought the tags with him, but he’d long since stopped opening the box. He kept it on the shelf, out of the way. That was how he dealt with his issues with his father. He kept them out of the way so he could get about his daily life. Coming back to the mansion always meant confronting them again.
They went back to the mansion. The Alts were happy that Kate was all right. They’d all become rather invested in them, and Tony would be lying if she said the reverse wasn’t true—she’d grown quite attached to 199999. None of them treated Kate rudely over the matter, none of them even mentioned it directly, except to express their thankfulness that she was unharmed. The first day, Kate had rested. The second, she wanted to go to school. They let her; it was probably better that she get out of the house than wallow in her problems, probably better that she be seen by her friends before they got suspicious about her absence. Steve and Tony still had not decided on just
yet,” Francis said. Other Clint was looking steadily more horrified and it took all of Steve’s willpower not to laugh because, of course, Clint couldn’t know that Francis was pulling his leg. Other Clint attempted to formulate a response while Steve rose from his chair. He had other things to worry about than Francis causing a bit of mischief with the Alts.
“And I already took care of it,” Steve replied over the system as well. They were fighting Doombots. Considering that they were villainous robots that 199999 had fought before—and that it was rather difficult to screw up cleaning up Doombots—the 3490 Avengers had given them the task of cleaning up the streets of Doombots while they went after the real villains. Doombots were, as usual, just a distraction. But they were a pretty
“Ugh, no. That sounds like the least appealing thing ever. I do not want to associate chocolate cake with raspberry sauce with the
“For what it’s worth,” Tony said, staring at the red rug beneath them, the one he’d spilled coke on when he was six, the one that
. Look at him! He’s a kid. He’s Steve when we met in 1990 for God’s sake. He might be a big war hero but he hasn’t adjusted to this century yet. Clouds his judgment.”
“You loved him,” Tony said. He sounded almost surprised. Steve guessed that he hadn’t seemed the loving type during all this time with the Senator.
. Tony didn’t care because she was deliriously happy. She hadn’t had this much time with Steve in a good long while, and the supervillains of the world seemed strangely inactive. The few plots or incidents that had to be handled could easily be handled by other agents; there was no need to call Captain America or Iron Man to the scene. So she had spent the past couple of mornings waking up to her husband beside her in bed. On this particular morning, however, he was absent. It made sense—it was a Sunday, so he might have gone to an early morning mass with Kate or gone out for a run. Still, even his absence couldn’t overturn her good mood. If all went well, they would get to spend the day together. She thought, perhaps, they might even spend some time with Kate and Peter (and James, if he was around) playing board games or building killer robots or whatever. Steve would show up eventually, and then they could plan the day.
his tech-making ability… Actually, Mickey used a suit, too, didn’t she? Come to think of it, Peter wondered why his Dad hadn’t invited any of them. There was some debate between using Billy—who could have magicked himself a similar suit—or Azari, who would be able to fight against the suit with his electrokinetic abilities. Azari was picked in the end. The rejected team, Billy, Teddy, Kate, Tommy, and David, would watch and maybe get a chance to do their own scrimmage later.
“I won’t lie—yes, it was that in part,” Tony said. She smiled a bit, thinking about their courthouse wedding. It had been hot and stuffy and the judge was the driest personality on earth. Steve was content, but certainly not as blindingly happy as he would be later, at their third wedding, but Tony could do with content that day. She was too ill to notice the difference, really. Content seemed as close to happy as Steve had been since they found out, no matter how hard he tried for her. “Steve of course thought it was
you think someone with a cosmic cube might try to teleport you all out of your universe and into mine?” There was silence from the crowd. She didn’t genuinely expect some of them to know—Pepper was probably legitimately clueless, and Jane likely wasn’t any more in the loop, and even some of the Avengers themselves might not know the situation, but she could tell by Fury’s calculated, blank expression that he knew more than he was letting on. After a few moments of silence, Tony continued,
“Oh. Right. Woops,” he said. He started to get to his feet, and swayed. Steve grabbed his arm and sat him back down.
“You were both always assholes to each other, but you seemed happy that way,” Natasha said, a small smile on her face. She must have seen something in his face, because her smile disappeared, replaced by serious sincerity. “You were a good husband to her most of the time, just as she was a good wife to you most of the time. We can’t always be perfect, Steve. Not even you.”
for a little while, you know? Just mine. I guess that’s…I guess that’s stupid, and you know now anyway,” Peter said reluctantly. Alt Tony’s interest piqued.
“If you’re uh—if you’re done we should probably be heading back soon. Can’t spend hours here or they’ll get suspicious,” Tony said.
But for Tony it felt like hours. She was sweating like crazy by the end of it, and by the time she landed on the ground, she felt nothing but rage as she balanced on the knife’s edge of ‘fine’ and ‘panicked’. She was going to be fine, though. She was going to be fine, manage to compose herself, to bitch these crazy bastards out for stealing her stuff and crashing the party where they weren’t welcome. She was.
“Jamie?” Peter asked, dreading the lack of an answer. It was the sweetest sound he ever heard when his brother moaned in terrible pain. He was
“Thanks for coming to my rescue and all,” Peter said as they were lifted out of the basement. “I didn’t think anybody knew I was down there.”
“Peter and Kate and even James all know the trigger words,” Tony said, a crease forming between her eyebrows. “We talked about this before I brought them back, Steve.”
. It seemed too ridiculous for words sometimes. Then again, her entire life seemed too ridiculous for words a lot of the time. Tony walked out onto the command deck, nodding to a few important agents in acknowledgment as she approached the center. The deck was buzzing with activity, though it was much quieter than the propellers outside. Tony was happy to admit that, even after all these years, she was impressed with her own design on the inside of the Helicarrier as well as the outside. Old technology had since been replaced, the basic structure was still there. It looked rather Stark Trek to Tony—only
“Guess m’not dead,” James continued to croak. “Or there’d be beautiful women or fat signing babies with harps or something.”
A dozen other names and faces passed by Steve as everyone arrived for the meal—Henry Pym and Janet Van dyne (who Tony once again appeared to know the doubles of), Luke Cage and Jessica Jones, Storm and T’Challa, Ben Grimm, Johnny Storm, Henry McCoy. Steve had no idea how he was supposed to remember all of them. A woman named Wanda arrived with her husband Vision, a floating sentient robot apparently from the future, and their two children, and that one really threw Steve for a loop, but he decided to ignore it and ask another day.
“It’s not going to be big enough for everybody,” Azari told him quietly as they walked. Azari had never once broken stride with him as they walked. Occasionally he shot him concerned glances. Torrun likewise walked on his other side, her sword drawn and her eyes forever scanning around them for enemies. All of the Avengers’ kids walked behind them, and the MCU Avengers held up the rear. If the enemy attacked from behind, they would buy the rest of them enough time to run to the safehouse. Thing of it was, considering what James had witnessed on the field, he doubted whoever was behind this would be at all interested in a bunch of Avengers’ kids. They only had eyes for MCU Steve. James was just
JARVIS played Christmas music overhead, and everyone happily mingled—even Peter’s parents seemed to have reconciled. It was December 24, 2016, and Peter’s favorite day of the year.
. The crowbar had bounced right off, as if there were a real shield where the illusion was. “What..?” Tony just grinned.
floor, it was powerful enough to blow all the windows out. Given that Mom was in pursuit of a suspect, it’s likely that when the explosive detonated, she was at or near the epicenter. The amount of force required to blow out the windows—bullet-proof glass—is incredible. Mom’s suit can sustain a lot; it’s capable of entering into space, and withstanding up to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit…but there are explosives that can out-do that, heat-wise. Some plastic explosives like semtex would do it.
“HOW MANY’VE YOU GOT, KATE?” he shouted to her over the roar of the cannon finally going off. Kate watched as the MCU Hulk grabbed the metal ball with his bare hands and roared in fury. They wouldn’t have called him out—after all, this was a mission to
“I’m impressed you convinced them you two are dating,” Natasha commented. Clint had to admit, he was as well. Phil Coulson and Maria Hill struck
The first thing that anyone would notice was how worn they all were. Steve wondered if any of them had stopped fighting and taken any rest in 48 hours. Plenty of them were still covered in blood and dirt and gunk that had no name, or had a name but which was better left unsaid. Clint and Bobbie rushed to their kids, hugging and kissing them, glad they were safe and reunited. The other Avengers parents plus Susan and Reed did the same. James, Kate, and Peter had seemingly unconsciously gathered together in a group, all looking up with hope, with dread, at their father as they stood in a half-circle in front of him. It was horrifying for Steve to see such a broken version of himself. 3490 Steve just hung his head and shook it.
“That’s not the central idea behind the Avengers and you know it,” Dad said sternly. “What are you doing here?”
“I have things to do in town. I’ll see you this afternoon, Katie,” James said. He shoved Peter’s head down slightly. It wasn’t exactly painful, but it wasn’t comfortable, either. “Later, dork.” With that he exited the room. Peter just grabbed his bag off the floor.
“Should be back for dinner,” Kate said, eyeing him suspiciously. “Did you do something?” James frowned.
something?” Dad asked, exasperated. Peter tensed. He could see Kate doing the same in the corner of his eye. Here they went again.
“I beat you once, I can beat you again,” Kate said coolly. “It’s just not worth my time. Unlike you, I have a life outside here.” Ok. Kate could admit that last part was a bit mean. Jeanne might have rich parents to go home to if she chose, but Kate knew she would probably always be on a watch list for some of her past activities. After three years at the Academy, she could of course go back to a normal high school, but she wouldn’t
“Can you handle it or do I need to send out Captain Marvel and Falcon?” the Commander asked, sounding equally annoyed.
?” Kate asked. She sounded slightly hysterical. Steve couldn’t blame her. She’d been through more in the past two weeks than she’d probably been through in all her life—and she’d had quite an adventurous life as far as Steve could tell.
“I’m sorry, I forgot you’re allergic to concern and polite behavior,” Steve retorted. Tony winced. He deserved that one.
“Fine,” 525 Steve said. He turned back to Steve, his eyes as cold as ever. “You want to know why? It’s because Avengers are a
It was absolute chaos outside. Kate couldn’t believe that they were duking it out in the middle of Times Square. SHIELD hadn’t been able to contain everything—they were too busy trying to evacuate civilians—so they had called on the B team, the nearest source of aid. Where her father was she didn’t know—presumably off somewhere doing something to help find the infinity gauntlet. At least, Kate hoped so. After her mom, it was difficult not to contemplate other possibilities, but she tried not to dwell on it.
Tony couldn’t think. Tony couldn’t breathe. It was happening all over again. 199999 was the exact same as 525—they’d joined the fight and now 3490 was going to get crushed from both sides and there was nothing she could do to stop it. She felt her heart racing, felt the world getting smaller and smaller as nothing mattered but the pounding of blood in her ears. JARVIS was telling her something.
“Exactly,” MCU Fury had said. He sipped at his coffee. They had nipped into a diner for breakfast to talk business.
“That I did. We put that desk up and gave him all sorts of science books and gadgets and made it his space and then he didn’t
Steve got his shield back and resumed pummeling the nearest agents, pushing them all back towards the breach. He was still unnerved by the fact that it hadn’t closed—and the realization he’d just had, too.
Tony was startled when the spell over all of them was disrupted as Bucky abruptly wrenched open the door and shouted sharply,
“It’s a gamble either way,” Steve said. “I like our odds in this safe house better. Besides, if they do have trackers in us, I have to imagine we’ll be in more danger if we try to leave. If they’re playing some kind of game, and we stop playing along, well. I don’t think that will end well.” There was uncomfortable silence for a moment.
“I wanted to start off by—by thanking all of you for coming today,” he said. “This is ah, not the kind of funeral Tony would throw, I think. I mean, Tony planned all of this. Everything here today, she orchestrated years ago, when she had cancer, and we thought—well.” He cleared his throat. “But, it’s not really Tony’s style. I think if we—if we saw a funeral that Tony would have liked, we’d see something really spectacular. A viking funeral, maybe? Sail everybody out on her yacht, then set another,
“’Course I do, Agent Giggles. I’ve also got another place here in New York, a place in D.C., a place in Malibu, and a place in Dubai,” Senator Stark said, looking amused.
“We’ve been trying to herd the civilians toward eighth,” Steve explained. “The kids have been doing a great job of that so far, but every time I try to start in—” Steve was interrupted as he had to dodge the bullets from a sniper in a building above. A shot went off, the sniper fell, and James was stunned to see his little sister holding the gun that felled him.
“Then it’s decided. You’re our New York task force for the time being,” the Commander said, rising. “God help you.” The other 3490 Avengers rose with him, and they quickly vacated with just a few brief goodbyes to their children. Natasha continued to sip her coffee as she watched them leave. If they were handing over the defense of New York City to a bunch of green children and inexperienced Avengers, then either they were certain nothing major was about to happen, or they were certain that worse things were about to happen elsewhere.
“There, now you’ve got it,” Tony said, rolling his eyes. He packed up the papers and materials and stuffed them in one of the old metal filing cabinets. By the time he’d turned back around, Steve had composed himself once more. Tony was impressed. He looked, though, like he was holding back a laugh. Tony was almost offended. “
“Of course because of today,” Steve said. “Tony…they could have gotten all of us killed, themselves included. It’s not
to date, too. But clearly Francis had needed to be a little more clear on boundaries and expectations, because he’d ended up hurting her. Was it just because it was
“I’d like to hear that story, too,” Natasha spoke up. Steve didn’t understand why—perhaps, he thought, it was because 3490 Natasha and Bucky appeared to be together in this universe and she was curious. Steve supposed that made sense. Bucky just looked at her and nodded, and then 3490 Natasha curled an arm around his bicep and gently tugged him off towards their seats at the table.
“Ok,” Kate replied quietly. “But not here.” Francis visibly perked up at her ascent, a cautiously hopeful expression settling on his features instead of the clear misery that had been there moments before. Well, Kate would take it. She got up from the armchair and led the way back through the facility to her room. She shared it with Torrun, but fortunately the half Asgardian was still in the living area. Kate shut the door behind them, took a breath and folded her arms. She turned to face Francis, who looked at her with an open, vulnerable expression. Kate steeled herself. “All right. Let’s get it over with. Say what you want to say.”
, Kate. Dad would be so pissed if you knew before he did,” James said. “I’ll tell everyone at dinner. Assuming that they’re here, of course.” Kate regarded him for a long while.
“Too much,” Steve replied hoarsely. “And I think it’s—I think it’s time you and Kate understood just what. You’re old enough now.”
you know I’m always here to talk, so I must just not be the right person to talk with. Talk to someone, sweetheart. You’ll get through this, whatever this is. And you don’t have to turn to alcohol to do it, ok? And if it’s just because you like to party—Kate, I understand that. You want to have some fun. And a little fun is ok. Just make sure you tell your mother and I where you’re going and when you’ll be back, and make
“AZARI, NOW!” James leapt up, grabbing a branch of a nearby tree. Azari came from seemingly out of nowhere and a blue streak of lightning hit the pond.
“Never mind,” he said a little too quickly while Tony tried to figure out how a sandwich could possibly be something Steve Rogers would blush about. “I—I don’t really know what to tell you, Tony. If it’s something that…something that he should have known?”
“No. No,” he said, doing his best to play it off as nothing. His dad still regarded him a bit suspiciously, but thankfully let it go.
Fury had not been amused. He’d practically taken their heads off right then and there and threatened to do it, too, if they didn’t tell him exactly where they were from and what their mission was. Tony rather thought he was going a bit overboard.
Tony was angry with Steve, for some of the things that he’d said. But for the most part, she just wished he’d speak to her.
drunk yet. Still, the blue liquid was powerful stuff. His state of intoxication, therefore, was probably why he didn’t realize—why no one in the room realized—what was happening until 3490 Tony was hyperventilating, her husband in front of her and urging her to concentrate, to breathe as he did. Steve still didn’t understand what was happening. He didn’t understand why 3490 Tony and 3490 Steve suddenly were grabbing their coats and rushing out the door. He didn’t understand why Bucky—and it was so difficult to remember that he, too, deserved a label, had
“We might as well get this elephant out of the room now,” Tony piped up. “Yes, in some distant, far off universe, Steve and I have fucked. Are fucking. There is
He wished that he could. He would do anything to put Peggy back into his mind, but that was gone. He had grieved for the loss of what could have been before he had ever come to this universe, had come to terms with what happened between them as best as he could. He was dealing with it. But then he shows up in another universe and
Steve wondered if he’d spent so long worrying that James would be a bully that he’d forgotten to see him for how he really was.
But then there was another Tony. A woman Tony. A Tony who was all snark and humor but without the sharp edges. She was funny and vibrant and ridiculously intelligent (maybe Tony from his universe was too—certainly he was intelligent, but all his humor was used to tear others down, all his vibrancy was drained by the press constantly in his face). Her words and attitude were never cruel. She was obstinate, obviously still a wild card, but somehow she made it charming instead of irritating. And she was his double’s wife. His double, who had friends abound, who had clearly adjusted to this new century with ease, managed to embrace it and everyone in it, managed to move on and thrive. He worked a lot, but he didn’t drown himself in it. Steve didn’t like admitting it, but that was exactly what he was doing. If he was always at work, he didn’t have time to think about anything else. Now that he couldn’t work, he was at a loss.
for people who don’t even give two shits about it! I am so done with that! You know in the end, it’s just going to be me and Peter. Just me and Peter and no one else, because you’ll all be dead from incurable stupidity!” Kate could feel the tears falling onto her cheeks, but she didn’t give a damn. She didn’t care that James’ expression was one of shock at her outburst, didn’t care that she probably just sounded like a hormonal teenage girl on her period, didn’t care that the stupid alternate Avengers were a few feet away and probably heard their whole conversation. She just didn’t care anymore. She spun on her heel and stormed out of the room before James could say anything more. If she had stayed, she would have heard Tony mutter to his fellow Avengers,
“What? No, it’s not—she loved you. She adored you. She didn’t say a single word against you. I think it was pretty clear just by talking to her for five minutes that she was more in love with you than I’ve ever been with anyone in my life,” Tony said. 3490 Steve regarded him with an unreadable expression. “But—I just—I thought you should know that she was pregnant. Two months, I think she said. Or maybe it was three. I don’t remember.” 3490 Steve sat down on the bed. Tony felt awkward. He didn’t know what to do. So Tony did what he did best—he just kept talking.
“Or just be a dumbass, sure, whatever, that’s not at all the start of every Super Villain origin ever or anything,” Alt Tony said. Peter shifted his weight from one foot to the other.
know how, but I’m pretty sure I’ve got it figured out now I’ve got a better look at it. Cover me!” Tony said. He landed by the shiny metal machine. Instantly two aliens were on him, but he took them out with a couple of repulsor blasts—easy. He had to concentrate now, though, so hopefully Cap would take that last request to heart.
“Well. Actually…” those two words were the only things Antonella said, but it was enough. 3490 Steve’s expression changed from one of confusion to
beats. Shooting comes from your head. It’s all a mind game, Katie-Kate. The bow is an extension of your eye, not your arm. The bow is an extension of your perception, so you better be sure your perception’s dead on.” He drew the bow, and Kate’s heart leapt. There was no way he could make the shot again.
“I don’t disagree,” James said as amicably as he could, “but I think you also need to recognize that there’s a difference between personal gain and what Peter did. Was it petty? Yeah, probably, I don’t know what happened. Was it the worst thing ever? Does it indicate a problem with Peter, fundamentally, and his personality? No.” His father frowned.
“Do a sweep,” said his father’s voice, but it didn’t sound quite like his father. James looked around hurriedly. He tried to jump in a cabinet, but he wasn’t fast enough. The Black Widow caught him.
Tony could not shake off thoughts of her daughter after dinner. It had become impossible. She didn’t even attempt to work on the universe transporter—she was too afraid she’d do something wrong in her distraction. She worked on a busted repulsor on Mark CIX instead. She didn’t have to think much to finish that project. When she had finished that, she moved onto another nearly mindless task, and another, until Steve came down to fetch her. But Tony didn’t want to go. She smiled and kissed him and explained that she wanted him to sleep but didn’t think she possibly could, and he left without argument. Tony continued her work.
“Sure, sure, soldier boy,” Stark said, moving back to his holographic model. “But one of these days, I’m going to catch you off duty, and you’re not going to have that excuse anymore.”
,” 3490 Hawkeye insisted. Tony and Steve didn’t need to be told twice. Steve grabbed his upper arm leading him along their stealthy route behind overturned vehicles and other debris to Natasha and Clint. Steve didn’t even need to speak when they reached them, just gestured to move out and then they were all headed out and away from the disaster zone.
to Steve. They’d encountered their share of advanced weaponry, of course, even alien weaponry, but nothing quite so reminiscent of the science fiction movie as this.
He couldn’t respond. It was like he couldn’t remember how, like someone had accidentally deleted his source code, all the parts of him that hooked his mind to his body and let them work together. It was something Tony would say, he thought, an analogy that she would make. What would he have thought, before her? That he was like a car without a steering wheel? A typewriter with no letters on the keys? He didn’t know. He didn’t know anymore, because she was so inextricably a part of him now.
“I NEED MEDICAL!” James shouted, hoping someone would hear him. He took cover behind a car and set the man down. There was a lot of blood. James ripped the denim fabric off the man’s thigh. His blood ran cold at the sight. James would eat his own uniform if the man hadn’t nicked an artery. He tore the fabric into strips, fashioning a tourniquet around
,” Jane said firmly. She carried Peter, who had been asleep and still wasn’t fully awake. James carried his little sister.
“You don’t mean…?” Steve trailed off. He couldn’t bring himself to say it. There seemed to be a rather lot of things these days that he couldn’t quite bring himself to say.
“They’ll take care of it,” he said calmly, but Kate could see that his other hand was clenched in a white-knuckled fist, and his jaw was tense. Her heart pounded in fear and she could do nothing but watch, and listen on the comms.
“Oh, baby,” Tony said, not wanting to admit that her eyes were getting wet, too. She pulled her daughter into a rare hug. “Because I love you, that’s why.”
As if they’d been listening to Steve all their lives, everyone pealed off on his order. Steve sent the rest of them off in two different directions, hitting Hydra from the front and both sides, leaving them nowhere to go but back from whence they’d come. The breach was still open; Steve hadn’t seen a lot of them stay open for more than a split second, and it unnerved him to see it hovering there still, a rip in the multiverse just hanging open like a bloody, open wound, two worlds bleeding into each other and making it hard to distinguish which was which at the edges. Beyond, he could see buildings like the ones he remembered raiding back in the day—weapons factories, he figured.
“Need a hand?” an unexpected voice cut through their comms—it was 3490 Steve. Relief coursed through Natasha. She looked up—in flew the 3490 Avengers, or a small portion of them. Captain Marvel had hold of Natasha’s own double, and Falcon carried the Commander. There were two small planes as well, presumably carrying yet more back up.
“I don’t like them,” 3490 Natasha confessed to Tony quietly only three days after their arrival. “There’s something off about them all. Something insincere. They’re jumpy.” Tony had learned to trust Natasha’s instincts, but in this instance she just rolled her eyes.
“There’s a difference between using violent tactics for what’s right and using them for personal gain,” his father said, and James could hear the steel returning to his voice. Suddenly, James knew,
,” Fury snapped. Steve did shut up, but he frowned and crossed his arms and chose to stay standing instead, just Fury, Hill, and Coulson were. Tony didn’t mind just rolling his eyes and taking a seat by Pepper Potts.
“Peter?” Francis asked as he rushed past, nearly colliding into walls. No time. He made for the other bathroom and burst in the door. James was toweling off his hair and looked at him in alarm, but Peter couldn’t do anything but go straight to the toilet, emptying his stomach contents.
“Hey kiddo,” Tony said softly. “Can I come in?” Kate bit her lip and nodded. Tony entered the room. There was no other seating, so Tony took a seat on Kate’s bed and patted the space next to her. Kate walked over, her shoulders hunched and her expression resigned. She was sure she was about to be chewed out, Tony figured. Tony hated that. She drew up her feet so that they were on the bed, and Kate did the same. It took Tony a moment to find the words she was searching for.
did. And wasn’t that just ridiculous? They had never really gotten along in the first place—why was it surprising?
It was then, for Steve, that the penny dropped and the dam burst, and with a laugh that was also a half choked sob, he put his arms around his wife and pulled her close, his head falling to her shoulder as he cried. She ran a hand through his hair and gripped him back tightly.
Natasha had to admit, as she sipped coffee and eyed the older man, while she admired the brave face the Commander was putting on, it was pretty obvious that the cracks were beginning to show. He was emotionally compromised. He wasn’t fit for duty. And she was surprised that her own double had yet to pull him from the field. She knew, from a brief chat she’d had with the older woman, that her place on the team was the same in 3490 as in 199999—they acted as the check and balance to Steve’s command, the one with the power to yank him from duty when it was necessary. From observing her own double, however, who seemed to also have one eye on the Commander at the breakfast table, two days after James’ return to the safe house, she had to wonder if
“Last week Steve and I made a startling discovery,” Tony said as casually as he could, taking a coke from Pepper as she and Thor handed them out. He popped the lid. “Aside from the fact that Rogers here has a thing for being ordered around—“
If Steve was being honest, he’d have to say that he never would have thought that Senator Stark would run for
“Tony?” Steve asked, since the other man apparently hadn’t noticed him yet. Tony looked in his direction and then squinted.
“Uh,” James said. He held his position even as his stepmother swung the crowbar right at him—well, not at him, James knew, but at the projection. He was
“Would you rather hold out for a few days for the sake of drama?” Kate asked dryly. Brandon flushed. But he shook his head.
,” Kate scoffed. “I’m your twin. Everything’s my business.” Peter caught the ball and raised an eyebrow at her.
you might see combat. But I know that’s what you want. Why don’t we toast to you? You deserve it.” Steve grabbed a champagne glass and held it up. “To James—may he continue to strive for excellence and succeed in all he does. And may he…live long and prosper.” James rolled his eyes at that, and Steve thought he heard a chuckle coming from Other Bruce. He lifted the glass. “To James.”
“Come with me. Now,” Tony ordered. Steve was caught so off-guard that he obeyed without a second thought. Tony marched to the hotel’s front desk. He held out his credit card. “Give me a room, please. Whatever you’ve got.”
of the fucking in the form of children who share obvious traits of both parents. But that universe is not labeled 199999. Are we done now?”
“ALPHA SIX FORMATION!” James boomed across the gym. Considering that their safehouse was in an old warehouse, their gym was quite a substantial size. It allowed them to actually move around and get some real training in. For the past three days they had received no calls to head outside and had instead drilled formations and pre-formed plans over and over and over again. There were a lot of them, and Tony did his best to compartmentalize them all in his brain, tucking them away into the proper corners. Tony got into the Alpha Six formation (really, who
“I’m not asking you to feel better, knowing that we’ll get them,” Natasha said honestly, “I’m asking you not to rush headlong into shit too deep for you to handle.” She stood and kissed the top of his head. “Get some rest, Rogers.”
At 9:15, the search party returned to the mansion—there was no sign of him, nor any indication of where he might have gone. Looking in the middle of New York City was useless. Antonella informed them that she was giving it until midnight before waking up the whole of SHIELD and using every resource at her disposal to find him. 3490 Steve didn’t argue. For another tense half an hour, they waited. Antonella paced. 3490 Steve tried to soothe. At 9:45 Antonella gasped.
“Uh. Nope. This one’s mine. Yours is across the hall,” he supplied helpfully. Tony blinked slowly. He was obviously already quite drunk.
“I’ve got it,” Tony said cheerfully. Steve smiled into his cup. He wasn’t the only one who had needed the day off. Tony was more relaxed and happy than he’d seen her in two months.
As soon as the clock hit 6:45 exactly, all the kids were out the door—though where James disappeared to during the day, God only knew—leaving just the Avengers and their parents at the (far more peaceful) table. 3490 Steve left the table shortly after the children did to make a work related call, but everyone else still sat at the table, finishing coffee and making idle conversation.
“Ok. All right,” Steve agreed, taking a step away. “I just—you could have a concussion. Can I check, or?” Steve’s expression was so earnest and there was just the tiniest amount of hurt showing through. Tony felt his gut wrench again.
that it’s—“ Tony swallowed. “Steve, if you knew a secret, something shared with you in confidence, a secret that wasn’t yours to tell but that…that maybe someone else deserved to know…but telling them would only hurt them…and you can’t know if the person who
He set the leg. He was torn in how he felt about James’ lack of consciousness. On one hand, it was a blessing—setting that leg would have been enormously painful. Not only was he pulling a broken bone back into place, but all of that blood rushing back into a numbed area would be hell. It was good he wasn’t awake for it. On the other hand, his lack of consciousness meant that they were in the real danger zone. Bruce could lose him any minute.
“Convenient,” James said. Tony could see the glint of silver in her hand—a small knife she’d retrieved from God knows where. Tony didn’t want it to come to that.
By Friday that week the pain in Peter’s ribs had dulled, though he still felt stiff in the mornings and grimaced every time he caught sight of the black and blue bruise on his side. If only he’d even just inherited a
that I didn’t tell your father what you were really up to,” she snapped. “Now go to school, Kate.” Kate looked like she was about to protest, but she shut her mouth and turned on her heel, leaving the kitchen with a poptart in hand.
“I think we’ve all seen how overworked they are, even with the size of their team. I think we could go a long way in earning their trust if we could help them out every now and again,” Steve said. “We don’t have to show them everything. We can make non-life-threatening mistakes when we see the opportunity.”
Most of Tony’s weapons were kaput now after the lengthy battle—repulsors were pretty much all he had left. He scrambled for a gauntlet as the alien advanced—it was green and it talked and that was all Tony really understood—and Tony backed away. But just as he was thinking he was cornered and he wasn’t going to connect the gauntlet in time, he heard a
“Look—Tony—shouldn’t we—do I need to apologize for something?” Steve asked. And that, really, was what brought Tony up short.
“Tony. You’re the strongest person I know. If this is what you want, I know you have the strength. And I’m right here. And I’m
that I’m really hoping don’t…get back to normal.” Tony looked at him then, his expression somehow both guarded and a little hopeful at the same time.
“Your double said we’d be appreciated,” Steve pointed out. “When we first got here. She said we could take this as a vacation, or we could lend a hand. I think it might be wiser to lend a hand than to sit around and wait for them to make a move. Besides, if we offer to help out they might equip us—none of us have any real weapons.”
“The both of you make us all look bad,” Natasha commented as soon as they were out of the room. Steve looked at her in surprise, but she just raised an eyebrow and folded her arms. “We need to present a
“I have a bit of time at the moment,” Double Pepper said. “Are you going to introduce me to your guests?”
Kate had almost gotten used to this, this constant exhaustion, this constant fighting bizarre enemies from other parts of space and time. It didn’t mean she
. No super-soldier genes had graced his muscles, and thus Peter was a geeky, defenseless kid the same way Bruce had been. The same way Peter’s father—who had been an inspiration for young, elementary school Bruce—had been. He had none of Tony’s blustering confidence or arrogant charm, either. He had no defenses, not even emotional ones (though, his snarky attitude came close). Bruce was more than a little taken aback to find him able to flip down from the ceiling with all the grace and ease of any of the kids who trained at the Avengers Academy.
. Steve set down his coffee. There was no mistaking the injuries on his face for anything but a nasty right cross.
“You should probably know that there’s someone waiting on the other side of the door so they can’t be seen right now,” Natasha said suddenly. Tony didn’t know how she managed that. He could swear that to have her spy abilities she had to have a sixth sense.
“Ah,” James gasped just as he right himself and promptly fell backwards again, his eyes rolling back. Luckily Peter was there to catch him.
factor from his dad—but no, Peter had lost the genetic lottery in that regard. The only ‘superpower’ he’d gotten from his dad was his eidetic memory, and Peter wasn’t 100% sure that hadn’t come from his mother—she never
“And to you too, pumpkin,” James replied, rolling his eyes. He and Kate fought over shotgun for a minute before Francis made the executive decision that Kate could have it.
3490 Tony finished whatever she was doing on her tablet, then offered it out to Tony. She shook it a little.
“I don’t know, get court marshaled? Knock up a girlfriend? Got your degree from West Point revoked?”
“Even so,” Steve said slowly, “we should get working on a machine that could transport us home. But we can’t do it in either of the labs—there’s no telling what 3490’s reaction would be if they discovered us making a portal home. Jane, Bruce, Tony—take what equipment from the labs that you can. We’ll need to find a location to work on it that won’t seem suspicious, somewhere you can disappear to for a couple of hours every now and again.”
Unfortunately, as he was doing his research, the keys stuck to the tips of his fingers. So there was that. He had an inkling that this had to do with the spider that bit him at Oscorp. What had they said about the missing specimen? It was genetically engineered, Peter knew that much, but that shouldn’t affect
Alts. He felt rage building inside him. To hell with his mission, to hell with his father’s stupid orders—if he had any brains, he’d be shutting the door and sending them packing off to the AIM agents himself.
Then, it turns out, he has to work with Howard’s son who, in Steve’s initial observation, essentially typified the ‘rich brat’ persona and was nothing of the self-made man Howard had been. And it was incredibly odd to know that the man, older than him, was Howard’s son. He still had trouble wrapping his mind around it. And yet, he had to put away these musings, because the reality of the situation was in front of him. Tony was Howard’s son, but he was by no means a child. He might have started on third base, but Tony’d hit three home runs on his own since. There was a ghost of history of the could have been still haunting Steve, and Tony was weirdly still slotted into that picture—he just had to learn to blot it out, to blot it all out. He was having difficulty coping.
didn’t want to handle shit with Francis on top of that. It sucked. Francis was her best friend, her—well, there had been something there, she thought, but she guessed he wasn’t even technically ever her boyfriend. Was her anger and hurt even justified? They weren’t dating. Francis had never indicated that he
“You don’t like baseball anymore, do you?” he asked. James looked like he was trying very hard not to roll his eyes.
“I think I need to speak with a lawyer any time before I speak to you to hammer out the logistics, Tony. I know we’re in Vegas, but
If the team had been dumbstruck before, they were thunderstruck now. Electrocution at the hands of Thor could not have shocked them more. Peter, however, was calmly carrying on in the kitchen, rooting through the fridge.
them for their stupor?” Kate asked, she shoved him over, making room for her to lie down beside him on her stomach. She fiddled with his pillowcase. “I mean, that’s not something you can drop on someone and figure it’ll be all peachy.”
. One part of his mind tried to pull him in the other direction, but a stronger nagging pulled him forward still.
Steve caught his double giving Tony a mutinous glare. Their interaction always intrigued Steve. It reminded him very little of his own first encounters with Tony. Sure, they had argued and gotten on one another’s nerves, but this Tony and Steve attacked one another with an unprecedented vicious nature. They aimed for the jugular every time, with no thought to the damage they would leave in their wake. Other Tony was not ribbing Other Steve—he was insulting him, waiting for him to take the bait and come at him. Other Steve, of course, did nothing but glare. Steve just raised an eyebrow.
leave Kate and Peter and I—I can understand why you might think that, but it still hurts that you could and—“ Steve slowed and swallowed. He took a breath. “I’m not going to throw away ten years of happy marriage over this, Tony. If things—if things had gone another way, then maybe, I won’t lie, I—I, there are certain things I couldn’t forgive, but the situation being what it is, Tony, I won’t do it. I can’t. And I can’t throw away 26 years of friendship. I can’t. I love you, Tony. Unconditionally. Even if you gave me cause to hate you, I would love you still.” He sighed and shook his head.
“Mind if I join you?” James asked. She looked up. His eyes were red rimmed and puffy as well. He hadn’t been exercising in the gym. Kate latched onto him and cried into his shoulder. His arms tightened around her. She never heard him cry, but she felt his shoulders shake. Kate just held on tighter.
“And…did he explain this or…?” Tony asked. The more she stared at the numbers on the screen, the less she liked them. A growing sense of foreboding settled in her stomach. If those numbers were what she
It was three in the morning when she emerged from the workshop. She wasn’t tired, she just wanted a shower. She took one, and then, clad in a robe and her favorite silky nightgown (though not her sexiest one), she headed to the kitchen for a cup of coffee. She took a seat at the table there and propped her Stark tablet on the table, looking up the effects of scopolamine. It was a hallucinogen, which frightened Tony. She’d taken plenty of those in her life, and it hadn’t always been a pleasant experience. Not only that, but they were
“Shouldn’t he be in the Junior class?” Ava Ayala asked. Peter knew her tangentially. He had met her once or twice and knew that she was another White Tiger.
“Uh. I stick. To everything. I’m not 100% sure how to turn it on and off yet,” Peter admitted. “I took all the keys off my keyboard yesterday.”
Oh, who was Steve kidding. They were playing a very delicate game, and only time would tell whether or not it would end up a deadly one for either side.
“If you’re going to come back, please make sure no one wants to destroy the multiverse when you do it, next time,” Kate added. Peter elbowed her.
“The flight attendants will get pretty cross with you about that, I’m just saving you the hassle,” Senator Stark said, sounding a bit annoyed himself, which only further provoked Steve’s ire. What right did
“I’m sorry,” were the first words out of Tony’s mouth as Steve arrived upstairs. She’d been apologizing ever since the accident, and it broke Steve’s heart. She laid on their bed, looking utterly exhausted. Steve knew how much these attacks took out of her. He just shook his head and came to sit beside her on the bed. He took her hand in his and kissed the inside of her wrist (
. Apparently this one warranted it. Kate’s face had turned white. The news popped up on the television, and they could see the bright colored lettering of
before he’d skipped off to the kitchen to get some water bottles. Kate eyed the tablets on the table.
“If I’d wanted eggs, I’d have gotten them myself, Barton,” Kate said. Without looking she knew there was a pout on Francis’ face.
Bruce didn’t have anything to splint the leg with. That could wait, anyway, now that it was set and not blocking his circulation any longer. Now to attend to the puncture wound. Gently, ever so gently, Bruce had Azari help him move James onto his side. Bruce nearly breathed a sigh of relief. Unless there was somehow shrapnel inside, it was a clean shot; the bullet had gone right through him.
“Oh hell no,” Antonella said with a laugh. “I was twenty-nine and pregnant with my boyfriend’s child, a boyfriend who had
“You’re still a girl,” Clint muttered to him out of the corner of his mouth. Tony rolled his eyes. A few moments later Tony heard Peter before he saw him. He heard the hurried, heavy footfalls of someone coming down the stairs. Peter popped into the kitchen.
“A man walked into the conference room. Agent 81. He had a tiny cube in his hand. There was a flash of light, and then we were here,” Clint said. Of course it would be Clint to pipe up with the observation. Clint always had his eyes on everything. It was the quality she admired most about the man, above and beyond his marksmanship.
“You said the F word,” Lewis Barton said with wide eyes. “Daddy said never to say the F word. But he says it all the time anyway.”
“He’s just trying to look like another tourist,” Clint disagreed. “Hiding in plain sight is usually the easiest way to do it.” Steve realized just then that he was, in fact, leading the whole group, the one out in front as they walked. He figured he might as well take advantage of it—he moved off the sidewalk as he found a sunny, quiet spot. Pepper unfurled the blanket they’d brought, laying it out on the ground, and Jane started unpacking the picnic basket as they all sat down. It was unseasonably warm and sunny for November, which was why they’d chosen a picnic—outside they could be certain there would be no bugs or cameras, except those which 3490 might have planted on them.

“I am sure that it is, sir,” JARVIS said pleasantly. “I have advised Madame Kate that this course of action is ill advised and that instating you as a primary user on this suit will have repercussions. I advise you of the same. I cannot undo this programming, but know that I do not agree with the current state of things.”
terribly different, even with his experience. And not to say that yours isn’t actually innocent and everything but, man, let me tell you, with Steve? He might’ve started vanilla but once you get him going…” She trailed off, grinning like the cat who caught the canary. But the grin vanished quickly and Antonella gave Tony an appraising look. She sipped her coffee. Tony eyed her suspiciously.
“Shit, what happened?” the unknown Avenger asked. She had blonde hair in a pixie cut, a blue spandex costume, and an expression that communicated to Tony that she would fuck shit up if she had to.
Tony put a gauntlet back on, but before he could do anything to help the Captain, Thor flew overhead and took out a couple with lightning before flying off again. That was all the assistance Captain America needed. He’d made pretty quick work of those aliens.
“No, no, Tony, it’s not that,” James said, feeling choked with emotion. “It’s—you made this for me?”
“What happens when you rip out the shiny blue thing?” Cap asked, and even though he wore his cowl, Tony could see his raised eyebrows in the widened expression of his eyes.
Steve couldn’t breathe as he thought about it, his chest was so filled with pain. He wanted nothing more than to get back to his universe, to tear the whole world apart looking for his friend. He didn’t feel like he’d ever be whole without him, not now that he knew there was a chance that he was still out there, that he needed
He wandered away, hardly noticed, and took a seat on the couch (which had been returned to the penthouse on popular demand—the decorator had obviously not thought things through very well) next to Azari and Henry Pym. Azari was James’ age, but he’d always been cool with Peter. Son of Black Panther and Storm, he had inherited electrical powers and had limited control over the weather. Peter had often been in awe of him as a kid—hell, he still was. Azari nodded to him as he sat down; a now decades old Christmas movie,

“Are there a lot of…super humans?” Other Steve asked, his eyebrows creasing together. Tony recognized that particular expression—eyes slightly far in the distant, eyebrows together—it was Steve’s ‘processing the new world’ face, and Tony hadn’t seen it in years. Tony cocked her head to one side, examining the Captain.
“He’s not always right,” 525 Tony said hoarsely. “Don’t always—don’t believe him infallible. Stand up for what you believe. Fight for it if you have to. Question. Don’t just let it go.”
Unfortunately, Steve’s job required that he keep an eye on the billionaire genius playboy senator at all times, so Steve uncomfortably stood outside the door as the senator, uh, finished what he started. Steve’s cheeks and ears grew increasingly red at the sounds coming out of the coat closet. Eventually the two (now, thankfully clothed) men emerged from the closet. The blonde at least had the decency to blush, but Stark just winked suggestively. Steve did his best not to turn any more red, but he was not particularly successful.
that could be heard clear out into the hallway. Peter’s eyes were as wide as pool balls. Bucky got up like his seat was on fire and peeked into the window looking into the hospital room; Tony was fairly certain that it was his double who had done the smacking and not the other way around, but he was glad Bucky wasn’t leaving anything to chance.

“And a daughter, Kate. They’re twins. And a stepson, James, but he’s not around much. He’s twenty-two, so he pretty much does his own thing,” 3490 Tony responded. Tony was perfectly aware that everyone from his universe was looking at 3490 Tony with a dumbfounded expression—well, everyone aside from Natasha, but that was to be expected. Tony couldn’t even comprehend enough to get a dumbfounded expression on his face. He couldn’t get past the idea of himself
525 Steve did not have to hold a squirming boy, merely sit with James standing in front of him, facing his 3490 father. James knew better than to attempt an escape. He would never get out from under 525’s hold, and though he tried his best not to, he could feel himself trembling under the large man’s steely grip. James’ father’s face was incredibly swollen on one side. He couldn’t open his right eye. His wrists were cuffed behind his back with adamantium, and his legs were shackled just the same. 525 Natasha sat on the couch next to where he knelt on the floor, one hand gripping his hair painfully. He watched 525 Steve with a murderous expression.

“Rogers,” he said. “I didn’t take you for the type to frequent a place like this.” Tony was certainly right on that front. The bar was incredibly fancy. Beautiful people in beautiful clothes milled about having conversations about charity funds and galas and ‘summering’ on Cape Cod. The lights were dimmed low, and the air smelled heavily of expensive perfume and aftershave. Steve was incredibly underdressed in his khakis and brown leather jacket.
“Where are you picking these up from?” Tony asked. Agent Matthews pointed to the central console, where Tony had been standing just a minute before. Well, she was thrilled that she had moved.
“So, you know what I’m here for,” she said. “Is that it?” Kate just nodded and handed it over as her mother entered the room. She took it, took one look, and raised an eyebrow.
and Jeanne shouted. If Jeanne wasn’t going to play by the rules of sparring, then neither was Kate. Jeanne got out of her hold and managed to slam Kate back into the ground, sending tears to her eyes as pain lanced through her body. Bruised or fractured, her tailbone hurt like a bitch. Yet while Kate was in great pain, she managed to reposition them; the fact that Jeanne’s right arm was useless helped. Kate used her feet to kick Jeanne in the stomach, getting the other girl off of her with a satisfying “

“It would be better if I weren’t missing half of what I need,” he said, “and having to thus start from scratch.” Tony rubbed his forehead. “Dr. Foster has made a lot of headway but I can’t focus on the technical side of things until I know what universal equations we’re working with. So I have to help her on that before we can really get to
Peter didn’t say anything for a while, and Kate was content to just lie there and try not to think about all the classes she was neglecting. Her mother might have banned her from going out, but she hadn’t banned her from the internet or breathed down her neck while she finished homework. And after a long day at school and longer days ahead with no friends to hang out with, the last thing she ever wanted to do was more work. So she often spent her afternoons reading, or chatting on Facebook, or practicing her cello or devouring a television series on Netflix. She currently had thing for Apocalypse shows. All of that never left much time at the end of the night for school work, and frankly she never wanted to do it anyway, so half the time she just didn’t.
“You’re impossible. You’re worse than your double,” Steve said, rolling his eyes and opening the hotel door.

. A weird, tiny part of him that he didn’t quite understand, wasn’t ready yet to say goodbye to all of this. But then he felt Steve’s hand on his shoulder, a reassuring presence at his back.
“Of course she did. Tony always came back. And Tony—she showed up, looking like she’d just stepped out of a magazine shoot instead of a battle, and part of me wanted to start in on the lecture—I think some of you could recite the lecture back to me—but I was just so relieved, I yelled at her about how worried we were that she wasn’t going to come back from that. And she stepped in really close, and we were at the top of the Empire State Building, and I don’t think you could have scripted a better romantic moment. So what does Tony do? She says to me, ‘Cap, you know I’ll always come back—’”
“I’m a New York senator! Have to live in a New York for parts of the year to stay that way,” a voice called out. Steve looked up the stairs. Senator Stark grinned down at them. Seeing Steve, he lowered his sunglasses down the bridge of his nose. “And who’s Secret Agent Schwarzenegger here?”
Flash threw the other kid to the ground. Peter moved forward, protesting, but before he could say much of anything Flash landed a right hook to the side of his face. It sent Peter sprawling to the ground. Steve moved forward, but Tony just grabbed one of his biceps.
“Cap. Steve. Gauntlet time. You ready?” Tony asked, holding the gauntlet out for him and waving it. (Even in the thick of battle, Tony had to admit it was entertaining that the gauntlet had a wrist joint and as he shook the glove the hand waved as if saying hello.) Steve stared at him for a moment. He was covered in dust from the now destroyed Great Hall, blood from the battle, and splashes of mud from where the landmines had torn up the soft earth and sent it flying everywhere. He looked great. If the multiverse was about to end, Tony didn’t mind that being his last thought, or the last thing he saw. But Steve just kept looking at him. Tony shook the gauntlet again.
Tony turned off the holodeck, and the blue lights disappeared. He walked over to the mini kitchen area of the lab, going straight for his coffee maker. He put in new grounds and filled the pitcher up with water. He turned it on, and then turned to Steve.
“Why, did you drug it?” Peter asked. Though it was obviously a joke (or so James figured, anyway) there was no humor in his voice. It was like all the emotion had been wiped away from his little brother, leaving nothing but a shell behind. James wanted to go back to the gym and punch the damn bag until it split open and bled sand all over the floor.
“I told you we should have gagged him,” 525 Steve sighed. “Don’t let the Alt get to you, darling. You know better than anyone that what we’re doing is the right thing.”
“Good work, Iron Man,” Steve said. The words felt utterly inadequate—he’d have to come up with better compliments later. But for now— “Let’s finish this.”
“—yeah, spotted them trying to be all sneaky about it, coming in at different times, from different places. But I definitely saw them come in here—and they didn’t come back out,” spoke a young woman with brunette hair.
“As a non-superpowered person I’m siding with Natasha on this one,” Pepper said, to Steve’s surprise. “We don’t know what they’re capable of, or what they’re going to ask us for in return.”
“James,” Steve said calmly, soothingly, “what can we say? What proof can we offer you?” James eyed him suspiciously.
“Sure, Rogers,” Tony replied, and Steve felt a tiny pang at the use of his last name, not his first. “We’re good.”
“Does growing old scare you?” Tony asked out of the blue. Tony often had those moments, baffling Steve. She was unpredictable, and Steve thought that no matter how long he would know her for, she would always be a bit of a mystery in some ways. They laid under the stars, spread out on a picnic blanket on the beach and covered with thicker quilts as the rhythmic sound of the waves soothed them, and the cold water occasionally lapped at their exposed feet.
James had nothing on him but the clothes on his back and his gift from Tony strapped to his arm. He didn’t want to take supplies away from the compound. Besides, it wasn’t like
, I swear. Is that something that guys do with non-spouses? I don’t really know, but you should really take advantage of it anyway. And then maybe go for lunch? I recommend the SkyLight restaurant at the top of Four Freedoms Plaza. It’s really very beautiful and the food is amazing. Five Michelin Stars and everything. Great view.”
“I’m glad to see you here, son,” Steve said warmly as they settled down to dinner. Other Tony, Clint, Natasha and Pepper were arguing at the other end of the table, which was really stretched in its capacity now. They would have to start eating in the dining hall. He didn’t know what they were arguing about, though it sounded vaguely like car racing. His Tony was having a discussion with Other Jane and Thor about the multiverse. Kate was surreptitiously—or so she thought—playing Candy Crush on her phone between bites of chicken, and Peter sat next to James, sullen. Steve wasn’t going to bring it up; he already knew why Peter was unhappy, and it wasn’t something Steve could fix. He’d tried and failed too many times before. “How have you been?”
and James had no idea where he’d gotten it from. Eventually he landed by the group. At James expression, he showed him the little black device on his wrist.
Fuck, Steve, what am I supposed to tell our children when they ask me when you’re coming back? What can I possibly do to let Kate know that our fighting wasn’t her fault other than tell her that over and over? I can talk to her until I’m blue in the face, but whether or not she
“Au contraire! The Medal of Honor is only awarded for going above and beyond the call,” Stark said. Steve shifted uncomfortably.
“Oh,” he said, caught completely off guard. Bucky was such a private thing, these days. No one he knew anymore knew the name, knew about Steve’s life before D.C., before becoming a Special Agent. “Yeah, it’s a nickname but—where did you even get that from?”
, eighty-one?” The boy’s expression was slack, and a bad feeling was beginning to grip Steve’s stomach. Acting on instinct, he moved towards the young man. Agent 81 held out his hand—the little blue cube was at the center. Suddenly, there was a bright flash of blue light taking over the whole room, a horrible, sickening feeling like Steve was being squeezed through a soda can, and then—
much like the ones he had in Malibu. Even if their passwords weren’t the same, Tony was fairly certain he could hack 3490 Tony’s system and get into the lab. He just wanted to tinker. And maybe he a little bit wanted to see some of 3490 Tony’s toys. Ok, maybe he wanted that a
“James, please, Jamie, just let him go, let him go, Jamie, please—“ his little sister was behind him, behind the alt. She was crying again. But James still saw red even in the wake of his little brother’s wide-eyed expression.
“I’m not flying into the void, Capsicle,” Tony said. He was rolling his eyes and it was a shame the Captain could not see the degree of his exasperation. His exasperation level was at like, a thousand at least. They’d been fighting these aliens for quite some time now, and that portal wasn’t getting any smaller. “I’m shutting it down.”
“Here go the dramatics,” Francis heard Brandon mutter. Francis resisted the urge to punch him. He was a SHIELD agent. He wasn’t allowed to do that kind of thing anymore. Not unless it was sanctioned.
“I’m…kind of afraid of the answers, Dad,” Kate said quietly, but it was the loudest thing that James had heard in years. Their father put a single hand on his face, massaging at his temple.
But James knew there were other things to be done. His father might be wandering around in a daze, but James couldn’t afford to do that now. He had to find Peter, to find Kate, to get the hell out of dodge because the scene was too hot. He stood up and broke into a run. He spotted the MCU Avengers and headed in their direction—they must have some clue as to what the plan was, what the strategy was—what James wouldn’t do for an earpiece right now.
“Round Two and you can’t pin me,” Jeanne said. “You’re a talented fighter Kate. But you lack the killer instinct.” Jeanne said, just as she elbowed Kate in the back. Kate screamed in pain and fury. She had had enough. She turned and grabbed Jeanne’s broken arm, spinning to twist it behind her back. Jeanne couldn’t help but give a shout of her own, and Kate kicked the back of her shins. Jeanne fell to her knees, laughing.
Peter,” 3490 Tony insisted, shooing him out with her hand. Looking sorely disappointed, Peter ate the last bite of his pancake and then left the table, heading off after Kate.
“Why are you all looking at me like that?” he asked, bewildered. They all turned back to their breakfasts and conversations quickly. A little
where family ended up—in a broken pile of people, all hurt and angry at one another, tearing each other apart in the worst ways possible.
There were some general complaints from the crowd at large, all of which went ignored as the concerned parties—two by two—headed off in search of one of the bunker’s safe rooms all together. There was some general indignation from the gathered group (all of which went completely ignored) but the grumbling settled pretty quickly into hushed tones instead.
“I’ve run on less sleep than this before Katie,” her dad said, giving her the smallest of smiles to reassure her, to put her worries aside. As if that could. Kate felt anger building inside of her, bubbling up unbidden. “I’ll be fine
“Oh,” Tony said, blinking for a moment. “That’s not—well, I mean, of course you shouldn’t encourage your underage sister to go to a nightclub and use party drugs but—I’d rather you have gone with her than tried to get her to stay home. Kate’s not exactly one to take direction well. If you had stayed home, she still would have gone and—well, I don’t want to think what would have happened to her if you and Francis weren’t there. Tudo might have called an ambulance—or he might not have, because he was dealing E to a minor who shouldn’t have even been in the club in the first place. So. I guess, please discourage Kate’s risky behaviors when you can but, when you can’t, just—keep an eye out. I think you did fine. Kate’s responsible for Kate—and I’m responsible for Kate—that’s not on you.”
“There’s more, of course,” Natasha’s own double spoke. It always sent a chill down her spine to hear her own voice, aged decades and coming from someone else, like hearing her own voice on a recording from twenty years in the future. “We captured a few of the agents. We’ve tested their blood—they’re from

Torrun whipped past Tony, yelling no word in particular and wielding her sword like an expert. She slashed one of the flying bots clean in two, sparing Tony from its wrath. James groaned loudly in the background.
“Yes,” 3490 Tony replied, an eyebrow raised in his direction. “I fail to see what’s so amusing about that, though. You’ve got
So as James put his hand to the handle of the door and walked into the mansion for the third time in four weeks—a record, James figured, since summers in high school—he felt himself stiffen, felt a knot in his gut forming. He wasn’t even here to see

. I thought I might actually get out of work on time today, that I might actually see my husband for dinner today, if you can believe that,” Tony rolled her eyes, approaching the command center. “Hill, get me a blood kit from the med bay, and get me Banner, please. JARVIS put Richards on the line, on one of these four screens here.” There was no way she would be home in time for dinner. She would be lucky if she was on time for
“But—“ Tony continued to protest, though he wasn’t wholly certain why. His gut squirmed. Steve’s argument made sense. It did. But. The idea of it made him uneasy.
him run, and then pick him off with a well placed arrow. Peter chose option two. He turned around, not running anymore, and grabbed Clint, grappling with the archer and surprising the man. They stumbled backwards in this awkward embrace until they reached the clearing. Peter used his strength to throw the other man down to the ground. Clint, however, was ready for such a move and swept Peter’s legs out from under him. Peter didn’t mind—they were still headed towards the pond. He rolled out of the way of another blow and got up, taking the offensive and leveling kicks at the archer until he was backing up into the water. As soon as his feet hit the pond in which James and the Captain were already fighting, James screamed,
He walked to Paley Park and sat on a bench for some time. He stayed there until it was dark. When he looked up and could see the stars—stars that were more luminous now than he’d seen them in years, with most of the city evacuated—he realized that people would be missing him. They would be looking for him, maybe. Relieved of his command, Steve knew where he ought to go and walked back to the safe house.
“I love you three more than anything,” he said quietly. “I’m sorry I can’t be more for you, can’t be different for you. I’m sorry.”
“Well I wouldn’t tell your mother. I’d pity the poor kid who’d have to suffer her wrath,” Steve advised. Peter managed a brief smile before his father tossed him a wrench. He didn’t catch it—such were his reflexes. It bounced harmlessly off his chest and onto the ground. It wouldn’t have hurt, in normal circumstances; it had been thrown very lightly. Yet it hit his ribs and suddenly his chest was on fire, and he was doing his best not to scream at the top of his lungs. He wasn’t sure how well he kept his composure. Something must have shown on his face, because his father looked at him with scrutiny and concern. He opened his mouth to speak, but the door to the garage opened.
“Tell him yourself!” Peter demanded. He had no idea what James was talking about, but it was obviously important—the kind of thing you say when you’re
“Of course,” he said, getting up. Tony followed suit. 3490 Steve led him to one of the many bedrooms since the other rooms were occupied. Tony shut the door behind them.
“Kate, why don’t you come in for breakfast,” 3490 Tony called out, puzzled. There was a squeak of the floorboards and then a teenage girl appeared in the doorway. She was wearing black lace tights, a black skirt that was indecently tight and rather short, and a turquoise top that seemed to be mainly made of sequins and sheer material and showed not a small amount of skin. She had on heavy eye make-up, which was slightly smudged, around her bright blue eyes, and her glossy black curls were a frizzy mess. Now Tony could see why the girl had been waiting on the other side of the door—she’d been trying to sneak past, back up to her room. He could see a growing fury in 3490 Tony’s eyes. “Katherine.”
