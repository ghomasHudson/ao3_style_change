However...normalcy was craved. It was sought after, it was wished for and desperately needed. To be normal meant to be okay. It meant that the nightmares had stopped, that the PTSD from seeing flashing lights and loud noises didn’t keep them awake at night.
“Just...be careful, okay?” Sherlock scoffed again, rolling his eyes.
“I can’t stand thinking that he might’ve been in that diner, watching us eat, watching us talk and watching…” He let out a shaky breath, his shoulders slumping downward in what seemed like defeat. “Watching Rosie…”
Great never lasted very long for John.
He heard his therapist, Rachel, click her pen a couple times, an annoying habit that he wished she didn’t do. He lifted his head up slowly, finally meeting her gaze once more. She was a small woman, probably in her early 30’s with dark brown skin and thin braids that fell past her shoulders. She had kind eyes, the type that made you want to smile despite however you might be feeling. Her voice was a bit deep, but had a comforting warmth to it, maternal in a way. He’d found her immediately upon his return to London, far away from the city and near the countryside in an effort to shake the uneasiness he’d had in finding a new one. He hated to admit it, but he had developed a sort of dependence on therapy after all of these years. All in all, she was very nice; John really just wanted to yank that stupid pen from her hands.
“What do you think of them, John?” John blinked rapidly, suddenly remembering the phone in his hand before he cleared his throat loudly, leaning back against his chair.
John frowned immediately, reaching out to grab his arm in protest. “Sherlock, no!” He felt slightly hurt at the fact that his boyfriend had already begun turning and stalking towards the doors, but ignored it for the time being. “I’m staying to help!”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes a bit, although he looked the farthest from cross he could be before he gave a heavy sigh of defeat, his head falling back on the chair.
A beat. John definitely couldn’t breathe.
“Don’t let him win, Sherlock.”
“He’s not stupid!” Sherlock rolled his eyes, shaking his head.
“Hold on, you’re not allowed inside! They’re preparing for a private performance, mate!” Sherlock blinked at the man in confusion, taking in his uniform and probably well hidden taser at his side.
“Greg...he hasn’t replied to me all day. I know how he gets, I figured he was just being his usual moody self, but now it’s late and if you haven’t heard from him…” His voice faltered off, his mind racing through all of the potential places in London he might be in.
Sherlock groaned a bit at the impact, stumbling back slightly but John merely squeezed him tighter, sighing into his coat.
“I love you,” he announced loudly and Sherlock smirked, walking back over.
‘He’ had a name.
Sherlock still looked confused, opening and closing his mouth as if he wanted to say something. John merely turned his head down, doing anything and everything to distract himself from the look on his face. “Did you bring anything home?” he asked quietly, reaching over and gently pulling Sherlock’s coat from his shoulders. He let out a small breath of relief when he saw Sherlock shaking his head in response, moving his arms around slightly so that John could pull it off.
Sherlock relaxed a bit in his chair, his pale fingers tapping against the leather armrest beside him before clearing his throat and nodding once, looking fixedly at something in the kitchen in front of him.
“Oh, relax. You’ll see him soon enough.” Moriarty sidestepped around the chair, swinging his arms back and forth lazily as he began to pace, snaking his way around Sherlock. “Aren’t you gonna ask me how I did it?” He grinned, tilting his head slightly as he stopped on his left side. “Or have you already figured it out?”
He nodded once, not even sure if Sherlock saw it before clearing his throat, walking around the kitchen island.
“It’s just probably something you should let your clients know beforehand.” John was seething now, setting his notebook and pen down on the coffee table and sitting up straight, opening his mouth before he was interrupted.
“Okay Daddy!” As soon as her feet touched the pavement she was running off, already giggling excitedly at the prospect of playing with other kids.
“He used to have the time as a kid. He probably blames it on me now, but if I remember correctly it was our darling sister who was always provoking them,” Mycroft had mused, and John hadn’t been surprised. If he had suppressed all of the things that Eurus had done to him as a kid, why wouldn’t he forget about the panic attacks too? John remembered asking Mycroft when the last time he’d had one was, and the look of pain that crossed his face, too slow even for John to miss, was something he still remembers to this day.
“Calling a cab for us,” he answered simply, and John tried not to focus on the fact that he refused to look him in the eyes.
Sherlock had no problem balancing his job and the baby, and John was so very thankful his daughter was calm and collected most of the time. She was so curious, always wanting to know what was going on and Sherlock didn’t mind at all. He’d come home from work on multiple occasions to find the two of them doing experiments in the kitchen, Rosie hanging off of Sherlock’s hip from a safe distance as she watched him work with huge eyes.
Well...yeah, right now it was.
It was as if his brain was rejecting what his older brother had just told him, like an organ unfit for a transplant. The information was so vague, so skewed and yet Sherlock knew exactly what was said.
In the weeks that followed, nothing else involving Moriarty happened. John had expected it; he had drug out his past schemes for months on end before, this wasn’t going to be any different. Personally, John found himself wondering if the note had really been a fake after all, but the way Sherlock constantly carried himself now always brought him back to his senses. He had a new sort of air to him, one of constant alertness as if ready to attack at any moment and frankly, it exhausted John just to watch. Sherlock had been reluctant on going out in public with Rosie as much as they had before, but John argued that retreating further and further into Baker Street would just raise suspicions and attract more attention. So now, every time they went out John felt like he was walking with a bodyguard.
“Sherlock?” All he got in return were a few weird glances from passersby on the street, and he could feel the panic begin to rise within him like a fire.
Remaining silent, Sherlock merely glanced towards the direction of the front doors, another loud crack of thunder sounding out around them. He heard Moriarty cluck his tongue disapprovingly, sighing dramatically.
Sherlock looked up after awhile, meeting John’s eyes with a new expression, one of vacancy and weariness.
“She doesn’t have to tell us anything, Sherlock. Besides, all we’re doing today is walking around London. Greg gave you a profile, right?” Sherlock nodded, still looking displeased as John finished dressing Rosie. She immediately pushed herself towards Sherlock, crawling across the counter with loud giggles and he finally cracked a grin, setting her bowl down and lifting her up with one arm.
The town was littered with decorations, and John could tell why his parents loved this place so much. Everything was homely, and had tradition and character; something his own childhood had lacked entirely. Sure, they’d had Christmases, but it was in a new town every year. Being a military brat had its downfalls.
“Sorry…” he murmured, and Sherlock gave him a sleepy but cheeky grin, rubbing his eyes.
“Sherlock?!” John blinked in the darkness, struggling to make out where exactly he was as his eyes adjusted to the room. He reached behind him and tapped on the wall until he found the light switch, flicking it on quickly before his stomach sank like an iron weight to his feet.
John was absolutely stunned.
“Don’t change the subject. Come on, this is exactly what you need, a nice big case...we haven’t had one in months.” And it was true; the last big action they’d seen was the Culverton case, and of course the mess at Sherrinford that occurred after. It was a big step, in John’s opinion, but Sherlock seemed ready enough. He was tired of the excessive experiments in the kitchen, anyway.
“Sherlock?” His hands were shaking now, John could definitely tell, and he watched with his heart pounding against his chest as he stared at the note for a moment, crumbling it in his trembling fist before he dropped it on the table like it had suddenly burned his skin.
Oh, Sherlock.
“I...sorry, lost...my train of thought…” Sherlock narrowed his eyes, dropping his clasped hands down into his lap.
“You know there’s a lot of things I had my doubts about before, and they ended up being true,” he replied, turning his body slightly to face him head on. “But, Sherlock...I do believe you. I don’t know why and I don’t know how this happened, but...I promise I believe you. You’re not crazy.” He set the crumpled receipt down on the coffee table, reaching out to grab ahold of his hand. “Whatever this means, whatever chain of events this is going to set off...it’ll be okay. We can handle it, we always do.”
“I suppose it’s comforting to know I will be remembered as that rude asshole of a detective after I die,” he mused, breaking eye contact and glancing over to check on Rosie. John studied his profile for a moment, taking in his set jaw and slight frown upon his lips. He turned to face the splash pad once more, watching Rosie dart around in her bright yellow shirt.
“Good. I’ll meet you there.” John blinked, frowning before turning back around to face him.
“I love you too, bug,” he replied quietly, rubbing her back. “I’ll be home soon, I promise…” Reluctantly, he held the toddler out and gave her back to Mrs. Hudson, the gun in his pocket feeling much heavier than before. Before anyone could say anything else to him that might emotionally distract him, he turned on his heel and stalked out, jogging down the stairs before reaching outside, shutting the door behind him. It was still overcast, the humidity of the water in the air suffocating him slightly. He swallowed thickly and looked around, shoving his hands into his pockets as people walked around him, ignoring his presence.
“What? What is it?” He stood up straight, shooting him a concerned look and stepping forward as John merely shook his head slowly, placing his hands back in his pockets.
There was nothing else in that room; just the two of them. They were floating.
Lestrade eyed them in confusion before shaking his head. “I just wanted to say good job, great work, the usual…” He waved his hand absentmindedly and Sherlock rolled his eyes, leaning against one of the cars as John smiled at him.
He took a sharp turn at one of the street corners and nearly collided with the detective’s chest, gasping as he stopped himself in time. “Sherlock!”
“You’re absolutely right, love.” Sherlock grinned and closed the gap in between them once more, his eyes fluttering shut as his mouth met John’s.
John.
“Can I just...can I ask…” He furrowed his brow a bit, gaze darting back towards Sherlock and then at John once again. “Are you two, like...a couple?”
“Are the people haunted?”
“Have you eaten today? Or...in the last couple of days?” Sherlock finished swallowing, carefully screwing the lid back on before furrowing his brow slightly, like he always did before he lied to John.
“Why is it that you two can’t go 10 minutes without arguing?” He shut the door as Sherlock huffed indignantly, throwing his sheet off his body like a child.
“You can do whatever you want to me, but nothing’s going to change the fact that he’s dead.”
“I think you’re right…” John shifted his empty plate towards the side, finishing off his drink as Sherlock began to wipe Rosie’s face off with a napkin, looking up as their waitress walked back over to check on them, a bubbly girl of about 17 with blonde curls falling down her shoulders and bright blue eyes.
“You mean, like…” He cleared his throat again, blinking. “Like...visit their graves?” Sherlock looked at him almost stupidly, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world, which...yeah, he guesses it was.
“They died on the same day?” he asked almost uncertainly, as if he were afraid to, and John nodded in response.
There was an odd bit of silence for a moment, all of them seeming to realize that the last time they’d been sat like this had been when Eurus’ bomb had shown up. Mycroft cleared his throat and broke the uneasiness after a moment, going straight into conversation.
“Who knows? I thought they only existed in Mary Poppins,” he responded, and Sherlock immediately starting giggling, reaching over with his free hand to cover his mouth to try and stifle them. John snorted loudly, leaning forward and nearly colliding with the table before he started laughing, and he barely saw Sherlock roll off the table on the opposing side, only realizing he’d hit the floor face down when he heard a loud thud.
“I have some business I want my brother to look into. He’s been ignoring my calls and texts, unsurprisingly, so I had no choice but to come down here myself.” John fought back a smirk, instead nodding in agreement. He heard his bedroom door open down the hallway and looked over, seeing Sherlock pop his head out.
John barely has time to think about him tonight, for this nightmare wasn’t about his time in the war like usual.
“You raised such a wonderful son. I don’t know how he came into my life or why he ever decided to stay with me, but I just wanted to thank you for him. He’s the best person I’ve ever met, and...well, he makes me proud to be Sherlock Holmes. I’d never felt that before I met him.”
Sherlock eyed him carefully, as if seeming to contemplate talking, then looked away and made a beeline for a bottle of water sitting on the counter. Well, at least he was making some sort of an effort.
John turned his head back towards the doorway, staring across the hall at his opened bedroom door, back to his empty, unmade bed. This wasn’t right; nothing was right. Something had to change.
He turned around quickly and launched himself at the man now in front of him, dragging him to the ground in one swift move. He heard his head make contact with the hardwood, reveling in the noise it made before he sat up on his knees once more, balling his hands into tight fists and beginning to pummel at his face.
John nearly opened his mouth to yell again before Sherlock slowly began to set his tea down on the table, sitting back up and leaning against one of the pillows slightly, bringing his hands to his mouth as he usually did, giving John a long look.
“Yes, I’m doing better.” John smiled a bit before he heard the all-too familiar noise of Rosie crying from her room upstairs.
John finally cleared his throat, leaning forward in his seat and resting his elbows on his knees, clasping his hands together for no good reason besides the fact that he was still trying to comprehend what he said.
And after that, he didn’t speak until the police showed up.
Sherlock huffed haughtily, yanking his hand from John and turning his head away towards the wall like a child. He always did that, always deflected John’s words and stubbornly cut him off.
And really, it probably should’ve hurt him more to say that. John found himself closing the bedroom door behind him, eager to muffle out the quiet crying he’d just heard beginning from within. But it was late, he was exhausted and quite frankly, Sherlock had done this to himself. He wasn’t going to sit there and act like everything was okay when it wasn’t. It didn’t matter anymore; Moriarty hadn’t been the one to put the heroin needle in his hand.
For a moment, John swore time stood still. It was stuck like that; him and Sherlock simply staring at each other from across the room. John opened and closed his mouth a few times, pursing his lips as he tried to think of something to say. Sherlock looked bored; his face was nothing more than that of a stoic mannequin, waiting for his response.
Sherlock closed his eyes pitifully, tears sliding and dripping their way off of his nose and cheeks as he tilted his head down, breaking eye contact.
“Oh Sherlock, really?” He reached over quickly, slipping his hand into his jacket pocket and quickly removing his gun, quicker than Sherlock could even react. He sighed dramatically, twirling it in his hand while keeping his own aimed at the detective’s forehead. “Predictable. You’re just as ordinary and boring as you were all those years ago on the rooftop.”
If Sherlock had noticed John watching (which he was sure he had) he simply elected to ignore him and walk into the kitchen, Rosie still clinging to his shirt as if her life depended on it. John rested his back against the front door for a moment, listening to his flatmate shuffle around their kitchen, still murmuring to Rosie as he did. His voice was muffled and John couldn’t quite make out the words, but it still had that soothing, soft tone to it. The pleasant warm feeling that had overtaken him earlier was still there, his stomach doing a flip every time he saw their two silhouettes pass against the clear kitchen door.
When he looked up, he was looking into the face of the still slightly concerned security guard, who eyed Sherlock up and down for a moment.
“No idea. But it can wait. I have a better and far more entertaining idea in mind.” John raised an eyebrow, looking confused as Sherlock turned his head down towards Rosie. “Want to meet my stupid brother?” John huffed at him, Sherlock smiling brightly as he turned towards the door.
John looked up suddenly, frowning at the sudden shift of his voice. It was close to cracking, had gone up to a weird octave and sounded dangerously close to crying.
With every step he took, Sherlock felt the weight of the impending situation fall onto his chest like lead. He had no idea what was going on inside, what he had done to John...the sheer thought made him nauseous. Moriarty eagerly held the umbrella beneath his head, taking a step forward so that they were right on top of each other, noses nearly touching.
“Good God, you two are absolutely repulsive. They weren’t kidding when they said you two were exclusive now.” Sherlock really didn’t want to know who “they” were, and merely continued to keep his grip on John as Moriarty began to circle the couple, rubbing his hands together. “Now, before I start vomiting, let’s get this show started, shall we?” Sherlock turned his head just in time to see Moriarty pull a gun from his jacket pocket, cocking it with one swift motion of his thumb before pushing it directly onto Sherlock’s temple, smiling softly. “Time’s up.”
Mrs. Hudson immediately gasped, crossing over from her spot in the hallway where she’d been cleaning. “John Watson, what did I say about keeping an umbrella in the car?!” John shook his hair out and gave her a sheepish smile, Rosie quickly imitating her dad and shaking her head around randomly.
“Sherlock, please, just calm down, breathe for me…” He could feel how shaky Sherlock’s hands were on his arms, despite the fact that he was trying to cling onto them as tightly as possible. His breathing had sped up dramatically, his back rising and falling with his head still arched downward. John swallowed thickly, knowing damn well that Sherlock more than likely wasn’t listening to him, what with the haze his mind was probably in. Instead, John just sat perfectly still, letting things play out on their own instead of trying to fix it himself.
“Not really. I don’t deliberately ruin the season for anyone, I just can’t stand it.” John raised an eyebrow at him, scanning his face for any sign of joking but of course he wasn’t. He smirked a bit, shaking his head before turning around and lifting up the crime scene tape, ducking beneath it and walking towards the edge of the street, away from the house where they’d caught the stupid teenager.
Pause. The noise stopped.
He pulled Sherlock’s face down quickly, immediately pressing his lips to his as his eyes fluttered shut.
“Are you okay?” Sherlock’s breathing had finally evened out and he’d stopped sniffling. John moved reluctantly as he began to untangle himself from John’s grip, letting go of his waist and sitting up slowly, swaying slightly.
The noises got louder, and he was able to hear words. “No...stop...please...John…”
It was then he realized he really had no earthly idea where John even was.
John smiled fondly and leaned against the staircase, folding his arms across his chest and cocking his head to the side to watch them. “You know, if Rosie catches a cold it’s nothing. It’s Sherlock we have to worry about; whiny, whiny, whiny.” He smirked, quickly looking away as Sherlock turned abruptly to face him, getting slightly louder. “Such a drama queen; he’d be on the couch for days, demanding tea and blankets every few minutes.” John finally met his eyes, grinning at the sight of the detective’s slightly red cheeks and narrowed eyes.
Relief washed over him a couple minutes later as the detective’s head came to rest on top of his own, feeling a squeeze back against his hand. John smiled despite everything when he felt Sherlock’s lips press against his temple, his breath warm against his face.
Sherlock’s breath grows shallow and he tips his face back. This is what he imagined it would be like if John were to touch him. John would be confident and wise and handle him with perfect pressure because he’s a doctor and has a penis of his own and knows what feels good. Sherlock trembles slightly as his underpants are tugged down his thighs and his lips part, wettened by his tongue as the skilled hands stroke his expanding erection to full capacity. He cries out softly when he feels Ademar’s mouth, still warm from the tea, slide over the tip and suck deftly at the delicate folds of his foreskin.
His mouth opens to accommodate
You're the only person I know who corrects texts.
The unwashed man laughed. “Do you know how many favours I would be owed in prison if I told every one how I killed your kid?”
“Too much?” Sherlock asks with genuine curiousity, and everyone laughs except Ryan.  Shy, awkward Ryan who has no friends and can barely raise the courage to speak to the bus driver, opens his arms and launches himself around Sherlock’s waist. Sherlock is not a great fan of spontaneous affection but he can feel how earnest this hug is and gingerly pats the boy’s soft hair.
that small swirl of injury
I ever think of is him.
I thought it was a soon enough for Albion to experience how someone might hold him. Also – Lestrade has a horde of children. It was likely I could learn something.
“Right,” says John, who wants to put this ghost to rest. “Let’s see how long it takes us to get to Putney.”
“You will love John Watson, if he ever comes home. He had a little baby too, a girl baby called Ollie who Social Services came and took from him because his wife was – well, she was wicked. Worse than any stepmother. It was her fault they took Ollie away. I didn’t realise how bad that would be until I held you. When you have a baby, the last thing you want is for someone to take it from you. It made John Watson very heartsick, and he waited with me in hospital because his wife shot me, and then he had to take a very long walk to get better. He’s still walking.
Professor Amarita Crisp is one of the world's most respected cardiac thoracic surgeons. She trained at Brompton in the sixties, a sight for sore eyes with her thick dark hair and soft matte skin that seemed to absorb light and small strong hands and scandalously short skirts.. Every man in London at that time thought she'd make a great wife if she wasn't so much smarter than all of them.
Regrettably I am unable to describe exactly what I was doing there for three weeks, obviously because I was tripping balls. I do know I shared a foul smelling mattress a lot of the time with a girl called Adrienne and and she, at one stage, offered to remove my stitches for me with a nail file. As far as I remember, she didn’t. I remember also that she smelt a little like damp hessian, aluminium foil and Yardley’s English Lavender.
“Or she was already unconscious,” John says, and the thought makes him shudder.
“I’m not telling.”
Molly
“Why do you need to know?”
It spills out in an agitated stream. “Because. I haven’t had much experience with relationships and I thought that maybe I should try. In case you haven’t noticed, I’m not the most alluring of men. I repel people and I can’t always see why. My gift for repelling people wreaked havoc on my attempts to have relationships when I was young. I don’t see why I should miss out. Why do you date women? Because you enjoy the company, right? You don’t have a patent on loneliness, John.”
By your bravery and truth
Ademar has made tea and is sitting on the couch with Sherlock.  Today they are drinking from Doulton cups. Sherlock isn’t familiar with the pattern – he thinks it might be Autumn Leaves.
“Yes. Sometimes he stops crying and listens. And he definitely has very advanced skills in both reacting to voices and forming sounds.”
She laughs bitterly. “I didn’t sleep for two years after she disappeared.”
His anger is the colour of freshly hacked coal.
“And it would be good if you kept the sugar to an absolute minimum – he’d be getting sufficient glucose on the formula,” the doctor added.
Albion gurgled with a wobbly head when I kissed his little cheek. John Watson appeared at that moment, showered, dressed in a jumper not unlike Albion’s and clean-shaven.
“So we just pack her off to Switzerland forever?” Mummy asks. There is pain in her voice.
"So here's my treatment plan: I go to crime scenes. I like to take risks. I would like some company. I'd be more than willing to share all those likes with you and I'm certain you're willing too. I'm not sentimental and I'm not likely to ever remember your birthday or bring you flowers but I'd like - there's no reason why we can't continue to ... connect like we did last night. if you're amenable to that." Sherlock stops for a minute and finds himself admiring John's face. It looks so much softer in daylight. "I'd like you to join my war. This is a call to arms, Captain Watson."
“I do beg your pardon,” Sherlock says with great formality. “We’ll trouble you no further.”
“Well, John Watson is a boy’s name.”
"How did you know it want' dog hair?"
"John, please. Lovely to meet you. This is a great place."
“You lay a hand on my family and I’ll grind your skull to powder with my boot after I’ve blown it off your neck. DROP YOUR WEAPONS NOW.”
“Oh Sherlock! Look at your lovely toes! Did you do that?”
“I’ve got a baby,” I said to the world at large.
They take their leave quickly,  and drive straight to the court, where they wait for Lestrade.
(poem things, poems of John)
For he can hear their hearts.
"Look at the photo. No, better still, OBSERVE the photo."
Why?” John wonders out loud.
“Does the Prince have a name?”
So John watches Sherlock’s face reflected in the window as the cab inches across London Bridge. He knows he is being watched and won’t lift his eyes but it doesn’t matter. John knows the expression. It’s happiness, contentment, an expression Sherlock uses only when he’s sure that no one is watching.
Greg is standing next to John. “Why would she make the trip to come here?”
“What are you doing?” Sherlock asks as John gently lifts one wet foot from the tub. And then he realises – his pretty toes are being erased. He concentrates on masking his disappointment while working out the many interesting things he could do with nail polish remover.
"Got it!" she says triumphantly.
“When I was about twelve. Harry bought it home – I think someone at school gave it to her. Anyway, it didn’t like her. He spent all his time with me. I taught him to play marbles.”
My boy was making progress in other areas. He would now reach for something if I held it out for him (or put it within his reach) and he smiled at John as readily as he smiled at me. John had become as familiar to him as I was.
"You must have seen a lot of trauma. How long were you there?"
"Brilliant! I can't wait. Coming John?"
Surprisingly, Eurus settled quite well in Switzerland, largely due to Rudy’s immaculate planning, and Mycroft’s tender care of Sherlock. It turned out that Iris had a lovely apartment in Zurich, and the Holmes family stayed there for three months while Eurus undertook a battery of tests and quizzes at Ludwig’s clinic.
But slugs and snails and puppy dog tails.
Nothing.
I lifted my boy from his little nest of blankets and nuzzled his temple. “You are truly are quite exceptional, you know.” Albion grizzled his greeting and pushed his fat little paw against my lips. He likes to catch the words as soon as they come out of my mouth.
No things come in the right size.
They’re not sure how to proceed. While John pours a plastic mug of milk for Rosie, and Sherlock butters some wholemeal bread for her, they wonder who they should contact first.
The Warlock isn't pleased. "Man, this means that we have to get someone else to help with the rent."
“What are you hoping we might do?”
"Theft is my bet. Usually the shortest prison sentences are for theft."
“Why did he go to Cambridge?”
She tolerates his mindless stroking for a few seconds before batting him again. Its way past my meal time, Captain. Chop chop.
“If you mean with chemicals and bricks, no, not really. But if you want to experiment with me in there” – John leans his head towards Sherlock’s bedroom – “the answer is yes. Yes.” He holds Sherlock’s eyes and his face softens as he adds an important clause. “Except it’s not an experiment, is it? It would be love making.”
Greg and John notice for the first time that there is no sign Mrs Best had a daughter.
It was all unsatisfactory so he sucked up two fat lines and sent small bolts of fire back and forth along his synapses, stayed up all night and early the next morning on the second caseless day went out in his pyjamas for some milk. When he got home he realised there wasn't any tea so he went out again. There were more people out this time and more people stared at him which annoyed him slightly. There is no way to stop people looking at you but they shouldn't. It's bad manners.
Sherlock stood in the doorway, craning his neck slightly to follow him up the stairs, listening to the soft click of the door closing and the floorboards squeaking as John sat heavily on his bed.
Sherlock shakes his head. "I didn't even hear anything," he says, confused. Nothing like this has ever happened to him. "First thing I saw was the shot flare when the gun went off. Hit him right in the mouth. Perfect aim." Sherlock stops to consider what kind of a person the marksman must be. Calm surface, seething undercurrent. "You're looking for a hunter, maybe a military man, someone who's trained in very hostile conditions and probably has killed many times before. You should check gun clubs too" - but he stops short when he sees Mycroft, in the distance, bailing up John.
"I had no idea what to serve so we're just having everything."
Are you ok?
It arrived the day before Mummy left. Ludwig watched it, and thought it would be very beneficial for Eurus to have access to this material.
"A technicality? It would have had to have been intrinsically technical", says Sherlock.
Lestrade appeared a few seconds later, giving Moriarty a slightly smug but mostly disgusted look. “Thought we got rid of you years ago,” he said pointedly, earning a haughty laugh on Moriarty’s part.
* * *
How could he say this? Things were most definitely not okay, and John really shouldn’t be telling him they were. He was here, being held under Moriarty’s control, all because of Sherlock’s recklessness. Sherlock could do nothing but stare at him for a moment, feeling guilty at the way he so loved John holding his face the way he was.
It was weird, seeing Sherlock like this. John listened silently as Sherlock continued sniffling into the fabric of his shirt, any space between the two of them gone in the other’s embrace. He was clinging to John as if he were a lifesaver, seconds away from drowning and John wasn’t sure how to deal with it.
John broke from his reverie to glance at Sherlock again, who had suddenly frozen up in his spot, the looseness of his body from the alcohol disappearing. His mouth was turned down in a slight frown, his light blue eyes no longer staring into his, but rather staring at a fixed spot on the table. The temperature in the room seemed to have dropped 10 degrees.
“I’m sure you know the story of Romeo and Juliet; by the way, did you like my clever little line I used on the wall?” He aimed the question at no one in particular, and Sherlock kept his mouth shut, tilting his head downward slightly to stare at the ground.
“Now, shut up and kiss your boyfriend like it’s your damn job.”
Slowly, Sherlock pushed his legs back down so they were flat against the mattress once more, still refusing to look up. He sniffled a bit, staring fixedly at their hands resting in his lap. John bit his bottom lip harshly, not really knowing what to say.
This wasn’t the plan. This wasn’t the life that he and John had planned out for each other.
And really, he shouldn’t have been surprised that Jim Moriarty knew about his past suicide attempts. He knew everything about him, down to the very last detail but there was something different about having it aired out for everyone to see. This was a jab at him, a jab at something personal and difficult and...and John didn’t know about any of it.
“Robert, isn’t it?” Robert blinked for a moment, staring at Rosie in slight confusion before turning his gaze to Sherlock and nodding quickly.
John smiled into his boyfriend’s shirt as he felt Sherlock’s lips press a gentle kiss onto his knuckles, feeling him sigh softly.
“We all know the story of Romeo and Juliet, RIGHT?” he repeated, and Sherlock dared to glance briefly at John, who had gone particularly pale in the face, staring at the table in front of him as if trying to piece things together.
And, despite how much he hoped and prayed that it wouldn’t, John figured that the whole facade had to end sometime.
They’d stayed in Brighton for almost 2 years, when he was 11 or 12. He remembered bits and pieces; swimming in the summer, driving up to London with his sister and mother during the winter, nothing too special. He figures he’d subconsciously wiped all his good memories from this place away in his mind; after all, it was the place he’d had to bury both of his parents at.
John shifted slightly in his uncomfortable chair, feeling the edge of the wooden armrest dig sharply into his side, blinking stoically at the ground.
“Sherlock…” His voice faltered out. Sherlock clenched his jaw, gritting his teeth before he responded.
“John?”
He stared at him, this beautiful, sociopathic, curly haired mess of a man sitting in front of him, cheeks shiny and lips slightly swollen, his hands clasped together in his lap like a child waiting to be lectured to. This is who he’d chosen to fall in love with.
Sherlock whimpered in response, and John ran his fingers through his thick curls, resting his cheek against the side of his head gently. “It’s going to be alright, I promise you.”
Mrs. Hudson was enjoying the wine John and Sherlock had gotten her for Christmas a bit too much, and John quite literally had to walk her downstairs to her room as she hiccuped the entire way there.
“Beautiful performance...nearly convinced me that you two were in love.”
“Eh, was just a bad night…” he mused, walking over towards the cabinet and pulling it open, scanning the liquor bottles in front of him before turning around, raising an eyebrow. “There’s vodka in here…”
Sherlock’s merely staring at him, his blue eyes full of mostly concern but also a hint of sleepiness. His dark curls are a mess on top of his head, sticking out in odd directions from being pressed up against his pillow, and he looks very pale tonight, something John does well to remember and ask about in the morning.
“Drink it,” he demanded lowly, and Sherlock’s eyes widened.
His arms were around Sherlock’s neck in an instant, colliding into him with such force that he nearly fell back, although it was probably from all of the alcohol still swimming in their systems.
“This is different, John. Before, when he wanted to mess with me, you were my pressure point. Just you, and he knew that. That’s why he kept using you, to get to me. But now...now, I have two.” His voice cracked slightly on the last word and he quickly cleared his throat, trying to hide it. He blinked a few times, turning his head away and breaking the gaze in fear of letting his emotions break free for John to see. “This is completely different.”
“Clues, think about clues...what could he have left…” Sherlock blinked again, squinting his eyebrows slightly as he muttered to himself. There was the note; short and to the point. He’d spent hours upon hours the first few weeks after he’d received it analyzing the small piece of paper for anything strange, anything out of the ordinary, and had found nothing. The handwriting was a perfect match for Moriarty’s, no mistake there. He hadn’t let much room for interpretation; he said what he had to say and that was it.
But things usually never work out the way John wants them to.
“I didn’t know I was required to wear clothes in my own flat, brother!” John groaned at their bickering, but Rosie found it quite funny, giggling to herself as they got back downstairs. Mycroft was standing by the window and typing something on his phone, not paying any attention as they walked in. John peered into the hallway and saw Sherlock’s white sheet disappear into their bedroom before walking down and into the room.
“He’s void.” Completely, utterly void.
It was slow and steady and calming; everything a first kiss should be.
“How much do you love me, Sherlock Holmes?” His voice had taken such a dark turn it even scared himself. He wasn’t entirely sure what he was doing, exactly; it was just a stupid game. But he could feel his heart begin to pound against his chest, sweat accumulating on the palms of his hands as he stared his boyfriend down, his bottle of whiskey lying forgotten on the carpet near his feet.
Sherlock was definitely not a cuddler. He wasn’t a toucher at all, really. Despite being in a relationship he strongly insisted on keeping his own personal boundaries most of the time, and it made sense to John, really. Obviously, Sherlock had never been one for showing any affection in the first place, let alone doing something like holding hands in public. (John still considers that their first major milestone; Lestrade nearly fainted when he turned around to congratulate them on a crime scene and saw them holding hands beside the cop car instead.)
For a moment, the two of them just stared at each other, although John felt that Sherlock wasn’t really looking at him at all. His coat was hanging off his shoulders, his dark button up shirt wrinkled and halfway tucked into his pants. His large hands were placed on either side of the doorway to steady himself, as his tall frame was swaying slightly in front of him. He blinked slowly down at John, frowning slightly and looking confused, as if wondering how he had gotten there in the first place.
John laughed. “I think it’s it wonderful too. And I think it will get better and better.”
They stare intensely at each other.
And because Lestrade is kind, and because he holds Sherlock in high esteem, it makes him happy for them. Good relationships are rare. He figures if Sherlock can mate, then there is hope for every difficult person world wide.
Mycroft obviously wrote the brochure for that one. Meanwhile Mrs Hudson had a slightly different view.
“Shut up now. Enough squirrels. How long do you think we’ll be here? I have to be at the bank at two.”
“Hoo hoo!” she said by way of greeting. “Have you got a baby in there?”
It fills John with confidence.
“Are we going to wear matching suits?”
It was a fantastic game. England, as they all predicted, won easily. Molly had three beers, Sherlock kept eating chips until his trousers felt a bit tight, and Mike and Ryan hugged each time the home team scored a try. John had three beers and two whiskeys; he and Lestrade were avid spectators and made loud criticisms of the referee.
He couldn't come up with anything, although he made a substantial list of things he didn't like in people and wouldn't tolerate in a friend. This rendered the whole exercise useless and Sherlock found himself once again resigned to the fact that he would be alone on this earth for all time.
John and Heather both looked at Molly, who was looking back at them in shock. “This isn’t a set-up, if that’s what I’m being accused of!  I mean, well, John, I’ve seen you peeking, and I know Heather’s intrigued by you,”
“Having him monitored, are you?” Sherlock accused.
Rosie, whose father was a government trained sniper and who can, quite frankly, be a very dangerous man should the need arise.
He'd thought about it for days.  Spoke with Mrs Hudson, Molly, even LeStrade, and all of them were of the mind that if it would help him, he should try it. Mycroft blythely mentioned in an aside that he knew someone that could ease his “little problem” and that he might be in possession of a sample.  And then he’d shown up the next morning with a staggering amount of medical grade marijuana in huge nugs with truly obscene amounts of kush.
And this is the moment that Sherlock realizes what is going on with John,  what he's clearly thinking and imagining. He'd glanced up, pondering a, quite frankly,  ridiculous assertion about the cribriform plate,  and when he'd done so,  the first thing he saw was John's tongue glancing his lower lip just so. Which is equally spellbinding.
“Yep, you're back. I'm going to call Molly then. I'll get Rosie's highchair ready,” John replied, and pulled out his phone on the way into the kitchen.
“Rosie asleep?” he asked as he hung up his coat.
, but someone else will have his mind and body.  His heart.  He wants to give it away so desperately.  He was
Mycroft would not let sentimentality get in the way of service to country.  Not even for his tragically broken sister.
Mycroft stared at Sherlock for at least five minutes during which Sherlock continued to huff and flail about in his tantrum.  He took one drink of tea during his wait, thanking the stars that John bought PG Tipps instead of that swill Sherlock used to buy.  After Sherlock finally calmed, turned to face the back of the sofa, he finally spoke.
“No worries, really.  I’ve been so much better.  I’m here, yeah?  A month ago, I wouldn’t have been able to even consider pints with the Yard.  I’m good, Molly, and I really am happy for you.”
“Listen, love.  If the IQ doesn’t get you, the fact that she’s ridiculously beautiful will. Not that you’re not beautiful - !” Greg amended his thought, looking at Molly pleadingly.
Suddenly John is kneeling between his feet,  looking at him with such raw emotion that Sherlock has to suck in a harsh breath.  He's suddenly dizzy; this is not his area of expertise.  And John is cupping his jaw as if he's fragile and looking at him as if he's beautiful and Sherlock feels himself retreating because he Doesn't Know how to navigate this.
I was, just
“Maybe you should ask her that,” Molly said, looking toward the door.  Heather Love had just entered, standing a bit in the doorway, shaking rain off her umbrella, looking just as smart as usual in a fitted rain trench coat (Burberry, perhaps – living with Sherlock had given him the uncanny ability to identify designer clothing) and an immaculate (despite the rain) pair of nude Louboutin kitten heels.
“Sherlock? Are you alright?”
Sherlock had taken it from Mycroft when John had hesitated.  He'd hesitated for obvious reasons, the first and foremost being that British government was handing over what looked to be at the very least five ounces of cannabis - five fucking ounces! Mycroft had assured them that they would receive no trouble from law enforcement. He’d given John at least an ounce each of several different varieties, all clearly labeled, with an accompanying folio – leather, nice at that – of each variety, their uses, expected effects, where the pot was grown, complete with soil analyses and growth and environmental reports and other minutia that Mycroft had said he could read on his own.
And the newspaper - well,  John had to have known that Sherlock would know exactly what was happening under there.  Not a calculated move on John's part,  but not one he was denying,  either.
He’d been gaping.  Holy Christ, but she was even more beautiful than he’d remembered.
“Now, if you were in a serious relationship, there would be a photo of a man there, but there wasn’t.  Also, Molly and Greg were more than willing to leave us alone.  So that leads me to assume that you have no man in your life.”
That’s not to say that he quit looking.  Dr. Heather Love was otherworldly in her beauty.  Tall, lean, jet black hair pulled up into those messy buns, curls escaping at the nape of her neck.  Pale with plump lips and searing blue eyes.  Always dressed to the nines, she looked like Hollywood’s version of a hospital researcher, not the typical dumpy, bleary eyed scientists that he ran into in their usual, rumpled business casual and wrinkled lab coats.
John sighed and smiled eventually and said, “I have her number, Sherlock. She's quite lovely. I'm going to check my schedule and if all works out we are going to meet for dinner this Saturday. Are you happy?”
“But that brain, Mols!  An IQ above 170?  It’s right intimidating!”
“Not too far ahead.  Watching myself tonight.  Came with a bit of company,” Greg answered, his smile growing impossibly brighter as he looked toward the back-corner booth, a booth that happened to be occupied by his very own Molly Hooper.
(See the end of the chapter for
Mycroft sighed a little more loudly this time and continued, “ . . . and he seems to be making steady improvement.  I believe the threat of suicide has passed . . .”
Sherlock was still in the same position many hours later when John returned from his shift.  John said hello, told Sherlock that he was going feed Rosie and then they were both going down for a nap, that it had been a great shift, but he was worn out, and Sherlock heard none of it.  He was too busy solidifying his plan, lining up a queue of appropriate female acquaintances in the guest section of his mind palace.
She looked a bit crestfallen that she wasn't going to get the opportunity to chat with him (boring, but something he was counting on, and then . . .)
John appears to be having a difficult time covering up his feelings this time.   He looks flustered and then,  very abruptly,  lays the newspaper down so that it's covering his lower torso and lap and jerkily intertwines his fingers directly over his crotch.
Newspaper crumpled,  fists tight.
And then John says, "And I love you, Sherlock.  I killed a man for you the first day that I met you.  Even then the thought of not having you in my life was unbearable. I'd been so lost and then there you were,  the most mad,  brilliant, beautiful creature I'd ever seen. How could I ever go back to life without you in it?"
“It did,” he smiled, licking his lips.
“So why all of this, then.  The yearning and the lecture that I must secure John?  If you were so intent on breaking me, on using him, why the lecture that I must move?  Why do you even care?” He said the words with a poorly controlled rage, spitting as he spoke.
She and her parents had chosen Harvard because she wasn’t the first child genius who had gone there, not by a long shot.  She moved to Boston with her adoptive mother, who encouraged her to take her classes slowly and try to enjoy her college experience, despite being five years younger than most of her classmates.  She graduated in three years, when she was sixteen.
“You guessed it?”
Mycroft visits, giving Sherlock a progress report.  A plan is hatched.
“Really not a set-up, Heather, I swear it!” Molly persisted.
Mrs. Hudson had kidnapped Rosie when she found out that Greg had asked John to the pub.  She’d told him that Rosie was more than welcome to spend the night and gave John explicit instructions to get a leg over if the opportunity arose.
Sherlock assesses him again.   Yes,  John appears trapped,  but it's different than the times before.   He's not running away.  He's not defending himself in any way.  Other than the newspaper,  his usual walls haven't been erected.
Her eyes narrowed, as if what she had to say was difficult to understand, or possibly difficult for her to convey.  The resulting music was soft and yearning, romantic.  It was filled with want and need.
“Simple,” Heather answered, a little smile playing on her lips. “Stoned sex.”
“He won’t wait for you.  He isn’t capable of it.  He needs lust and sex – he needs to feel loved.”  She sneered again at the thought of that, as if it were something disgusting and beneath her. “And there is nothing that you want more than him.  Nothing at all.  Why do you think I put him at the bottom of that well?  It wasn’t to kill him, Sherlock.  I knew you’d find him.  You always save him, in your way.  I took him because I knew that if I had him you would come to his rescue, and to rescue him, you’d need to come to me.  You would do anything for him Sherlock, anything at all.”
John freely admits that his panic attacks and PTSD have gotten significantly worse in the year that Mary's been dead.  He felt tremendous guilt over his text-affair, which very likely could have become a true affair; very nearly did – very nearly did.
And then Sherlock and he'd been at St. Bart's and passed Stewart, that young, ginger EKG tech that sometimes moonlighted at the clinic and he'd realized that Stewart was high.  Not so high that his work would suffer, but high enough that he wasn't jittery all of the time.  But he most definitely was high.  He could smell it on him and saw a vaporizer in the back pocket of his scrubs.  He'd stopped him and pointedly looked at it and said, “Best keep that out of sight,” and Stewart had smiled and said, “Helps with the ADHD.  I function quite a bit better with it compared to any of the pharmaceuticals I've tried.  Hardly ever see the doctor anymore. Frankly, Dr. Watson, it's a miracle drug.  You should read up on it.”  Then he’d given him that look, the one that says, I understand, I’ve been there, it sucks but there is an end.
“Yes well, the last time we did I ended up puking all over the floor of a client’s flat and Lestrade had to bail us out of jail,” he retorted sourly, and John grinned at him, shrugging a bit.
Find John.
“I haven’t thought what through?” he asked loudly, over the rustling of plastic. John blinked in slight annoyance at the ceiling for a moment, before walking over and taking the bag from him, tying it shut.
“April 23rd…” He furrowed his eyebrows, looking up towards the now soaked man that was seething in front of him. “What’s important about April 23rd?”
Another pen click. John tried his best not to flinch, swallowing down a sigh before he sat back straight and looked up, Rachel writing something else in her notebook. John waited patiently, watching as she looked back up, her dark brown eyes meeting his.
John watched in amusement from his chair as Sherlock fought with his daughter for the utensil, Molly snorting into her tea every time he failed. She finally surrendered it after a few minutes, setting it on the tray as Rosie yawned. She was sitting in Sherlock’s lap now, her head resting against his chest as she lounged on him lazily, one of his large hands wrapped around her front to keep her from falling.
He was laying on his back, like he often did, his head resting sideways on the pillow so that it was facing away from John, his farthest hand resting on his torso and the other at his side, just a few inches away from John. He looked strangely calm and tranquil, words that John would have never used to describe Sherlock Holmes unless he was asleep or dead.
“I thought dummies were out of vogue.”
“No.” Sherlock is adamant. “If we do, we’ll either find the mother, and raise her hopes in a way that is too cruel to contemplate, or  - more likely – we’ll find a family of strangers who have no idea what we’re talking about, and then they’ll call the Daily Mail and we’ll be on the front page again, this time as ghost hunters.  Did you get the dream lady’s address?”
“I’m right here,” Sherlock answers calmly from the couch. “What do you want?”
"I was trying to work out how much my head would weigh with my hair saturated. Then I got to thinking about the weight of a human head after drowning. I thought I might also try and measure the coagulation speeds of saliva but then realised I was an idiot because" –
For he is my blessing.
"Are you his partner?"
"How do you know this?"
John smiles as the poem predicted he would, smiles at the sentiment and smiles at the thought that all Sherlock might think of is him.
He reads each one again as he clips the poems in place, stopping occasionally to hover over a favourite line. It is an extraordinary thrill, to read about yourself from another person’s perspective. John can’t wait for the next one.
“Why? What are they going to do? There’s nothing wrong with me. I’m an accountant at a good firm, I go to the gym – I have  a normal life, except this is actually happening, and I don’t -  all I know is that the child seems to be in trouble, and I can’t reach her.”
Ademar has no idea what this means. For some alarming seconds he wonders if John actually conducts electricity for Sherlock. “A conductor of light?”
“Formula. 80 grams with 200 millilitres of pure water.”
He looks happy, she realises, more happy than she's ever seen him.
“I’ve never seen rats and their young, no. And I don’t really want to so don’t bring any home.”
“It made sense, when I thought about it. I do like danger. I like to push myself to my limits. That’s what I want my romantic relationships to be like. It made sense that I ‘d sense those things about her and find them attractive. But then I kept wondering, why did she chose me? I used to think she chose me because, well, you know, she fell in love with a man who was a doctor and a soldier, and I thought she must have seen how much I wanted to settle down and start a family.”
There must be something .
Our relationship was still very new, and was juggled alongside a baby who liked to cry about nothing special whenever the fancy struck him, and for how ever long he felt like.
Sherlock is fiddling with his phone. “I’ve just booked them.”
John tapped the purple fish again and we watched it swinging aimlessly. “After they took Ollie away and told me all about her, I realised she saw a broken down man who was in mourning,  some bloke who was just desperate for any kind of comfort. She needed someone broken to dupe. I was exactly the kind of sap she was looking for.”
Everyone looks down at Sherlock’s pale creamy feet and the deep dark toenails. Tension and an unrecognizable fear knot John’s shoulder and neck muscles into hard little mats.
“The thing is”, says Greg, who drives today, “The roads would have been different, and the traffic would have been different. Not every one had a car in 1975.”
Which gives him a couple of hours to walk down to the High Street and pick up some things for Rhonda.
I found the love of my life and Anya seated at her small kitchen table, arm wrestling. Mrs Hudson, who looked up and smiled when I entered, was on the couch nearby, sewing a tapestry. Next to her was another unfinished tapestry. Thick streams of coloured thread hung from it, and a small thin needle was tucked through the embroidery. Mrs Hudson and Anya sew tapestries together. Those little things that you never guess or bother to learn about people are so important.  Quite unexpectedly my heart filled with love for them both.
Molly
Sherlock is smooth and menacing.
"Well, I haven't stolen anything from a hospital in ages, unless you count a couple of canulas last night and I don't. A cat would be an interesting thing to steal."
Sherlock observes. He sees everything that Mycroft has seen, and one thing extra  - the deep cloudy circles under the woman’s eyes. She hasn’t had decent sleep in months.
“Yeah,” she said, blushing and looking down at the table. “He’s a good man, John.  Wish it had happened sooner.”
The players had been chosen.
Pulse bounding in his carotid.
He waited.  He could feel that she wasn’t done.  She considered him, looked at the prison psychologist, who was hastily scratching away at the file that he had brought with him, with a sneer of disgust.  Smiled malevolently at the armed guard.  She then erased her features and turned back to Sherlock.
John watched the Yarders as she approached the table.  Anderson was also openly gaping until Sally elbowed him under the table, scowling, her eyes narrowed at Heather.  Heather looked impassively at them and then looked toward the back corner.
“He has made great strides, Sherlock, but we both know that there is still a good distance to go.”  He took another sip of tea.  Sherlock did not move, but he was listening.
Her glass went black.  The sound from her cell into his room was cut off.  It wasn’t the first time prison control had cut her off, not by a long shot.  She was taken seriously now; even the wrong movement would end their sessions.  It had never gotten this far, however.
Heather smiled a bit self-deprecatingly and said, “What did I tell you, Greg?  None of that really matters and I just get so damn tired talking about it.”
“One is actually for Heather – you know, Dr. Love, down the hall from me?  I asked her if she wanted to tag along tonight and she said yes!  It’s not often that I get her out of her lab.  We’re great friends,” Molly said.
“Yes, the nurse got your attention -” Mycroft said in his drool, bored disaffection.
“Do you have straight boy pain?”
You know Captain, you smell a bit like that coloured bird I gave you. Did you cook it?
“What happens if I want sex and you don’t?”
Detective Inspector Lestrade had organised for blood samples to be taken at St Barts. Lestrade had, while making this arrangement, spoken to Molly, and also explained to her how I obtained a profoundly beautiful baby boy. This spared me not inconsiderable grief. I hate disappointing Molly.
The boy is pitifully shy but makes an effort to return the greeting.
“You’re doing very well!”
“Well, lovers.”
Thus the furniture in the flat has been replaced. After the explosion, Sherlock initially sought to replace his favourite pieces with close matches, but John suggested that rounded edges and tightly locking cabinet doors would be better. Amongst the new pieces there are now a couple of important additions – a small, child’s armchair sits between his and John’s chairs, and over in the corner there is an equally small set of table and chairs where Rosie likes to work on wooden puzzles and crayon drawings.
Both the good doctor and I expected Albion’s crying to reach peak capacity when he was introduced to his nursery, but surprisingly he slept for six hours straight on his first night in his own room.
Billy Kinkaid, known by police, assorted criminals, families of the deceased and London journalists as the Camden Garroter, has been a free man for three days. In that time he has eaten three pizzas, four curries and eight servings of hot chips because if there's something you miss in prison, it’s good fast food. Right now, Billy has a hankering for a kebab.
Oh, Sherlock.
“Social Services are checking on me, Molly. Please come in. Ms Briggs, Ms Powers, this is Doctor Molly Hooper. She’s my moral compass and one of Albion’s closest friends.”
But of course, Mycroft texted back. Sherlock could feel his brother sneering and this pleased him momentarily.
“I didn’t steal him. He’s mine. I’ve got papers.”
“Albion John? Is that his full name?”
Billy obligingly lifts up his standard issue ash coloured shirt and looks around the surgery while John pushes the bell of his stethoscope around the old bony chest. He hears a healthy heart that thrums loud and strong.
"No," Matron says. We've had three therapy cats since I've been here and I've never heard that any of the patients have been distressed or hostile in any way to the them. Through here, now, the next room on your left."
“Did you want John to do this for you?”
“As long as that one?”
He slumps back against the wall and looks at his phone. 8.16pm. In 48 hours I should be dead.
“Of course he’s mine. Look at him. In any case, Lestrade’s making me get blood tests.”
“Oh! Billy! How is he?”
I was in hospital (or whatever they call it) for  a total of four months and three weeks. I understand the British Government paid my bills because (I deduced) Mycroft had represented my addiction and mental instability as being symptomatic of the work I did while I was dead and then having to come home and (theoretically) kill Moriarty, who is a marginally (alright, somewhat) interesting criminal with fabulous dress sense, a second time.
“I’m going to ask you one final time, for the record – are you certain you want to give up your rights as Albion’s parent?”
"Did you see where Sherlock Holmes went?" he asks.
"Sherlock!"
"Oh. You really are a doctor."
John suspects the postman.
My brother was immobile as the details were relayed, only lifting his eyebrows as John described the final moments. Mycroft was impressed by John’s bravery, and that’s saying something. He is utterly unmoved by just about everything.
“Right. Well, my final diagnosis, in light of my clearer understanding of the cause, is that your straight boy pain isn’t straight boy pain at all. You’ve got a bad case of inflamed genius detective stubbornness with slight mitral stenosis.”
Better still, things got done. I had clean clothes again because Anya washed and ironed everything, and there was milk in the fridge. The flat looked a little like it did when six striped shirts Watson lived here.
“No!” John said hastily. “He just doesn’t stop crying when we put him down, so he ends up doing everything with us.”
We moved on from my heart to John’s, and he explained the whole Mary Morstan saga to me.
"Yes. We both need a scrub."
John opens his eyes, his face immediately suspicious.
“Do you want balloons or not?”
The resident will take any crumbs he can get and talks haltingly about an older male patient who has non-specific abdominal pain and severe swelling. The resident thinks it's kidney stones.
“Sherlock,” everyone says, except Ryan, who is beaming at him.
Ademar smiles. He had always thought Sherlock Holmes would be far more sophisticated. He wondered briefly how the best friend John couldn’t be in love with this beguiling man.
"Looks good," is all John says.
“Yes. Well, I used to. Every week.”
He was teaching me too, just when I thought I knew everything there was nothing else to know about people.
John was gentle and precise as he leant over us, but the fury was still there. I could feel it, even as he smiled and spoke to us both in a soft voice, even as he swirled a washcloth through the water and stroked it over Albion.
John has made tea and carefully carries the cup to Sherlock.
“Oh, I’ve seen them,” Molly says from the front, “I’d love to get one but I’m useless at putting those things together.”
“You can have whatever’s left over,” John Watson promised. “When I’ve finished. Until I’ve finished, the paint is off limits.”
The nurse was exhausted and didn’t care. He had worked a fourteen hour shift and had not taken a meal break. He had to get public transport to work and he hadn’t had time to do his washing.
“Squirrels. They’re unpredictable beasts.”
“Good. Now shut up. The young Prince was raised by two well-meaning but very tedious people. They spent all their time telling the Prince that it didn’t matter if he didn’t have a heart and that that he wasn’t as smart as his brother. So the Prince decided that if he truly wanted to make up for the fact that he didn’t have a heart, he would need to be very smart indeed.”
“Do you think that’s an appropriate item for a baby to look at?”
“Yeah.”
“That’s what you called it, yes.” Sherlock tries a weak little smile. “Maybe you should have called it the Blind Consulting Detective.”
I felt John’s curiousity piquing. “Oh! Did he find his heart?
I concentrated on securing tabs and making sure Albion was comfortable in his clean pants. “When?” I asked casually.
There's nothing for christ sake get a hobby im too busy for this
“Does that still happen? Are couriers still a thing?” John asked the receptionist when she brought the letter to his office.
For he gives cheek in tonnage to Mycroft.
It slipped out. John squeezes his eyes shut in embarrassment, which Sherlock finds secretly adorable.
John nods. He was a little indifferent to psoriasis - there are other more compelling cutaneous diseases in his opinion - but by the time they've reached St Barts, Sherlock has more or less converted him.
Then my mother wanted to know all about the formula and whether I’ve played the violin for him yet.  (I haven’t, mostly because he’s in my arms roaring at the times when it would be most beneficial. Maybe when he ‘s a little older.)
Minutes later Lestrade and Donovan burst into the room as if the future of the free world is threatened. Sherlock rolls his eyes and is about to leave them to it but there is a clatter of furniture and the dull thud of a lifeless weight hitting the floor.
I calculate the agony he courted on the army cot,
Access to one begging finger or
After three weeks and two small cases, Sherlock asked John if he'd like to come down to St
John isn't sure exactly what he's supposed to do. Lestrade has walked out of the house, stopping at various points to talk with the forensic team that are now bent over the young woman's body, then with other officers who are walking around photographing the interiors, scouring through the debris looking for clues or standing in twos and threes, talking.
Sherlock allows himself a couple of seconds’ indulgence to think about sucking eggs, then makes his decision.
“I wasn’t expecting all this,” Sherlock says afterwards, still in John’s arms, measuring the volume of his lungs and memorizing his heartbeat.
“Look at this suspect,” John says. “Sizing us up and seeing which one of us he’d rob if it were night.”
It's true, and Sherlock knows it. He never feels so special as he does when he’s with John Watson.
John doesn’t think about what it might be until he splits the envelope and unfolds the fine cotton paper. He recognises the small, neat letters:
“I don’t know how I feel about this, Mycroft. It ‘s very sudden. And John can’t be expected to make a decision of this magnitude after only a couple of months.”
“When?”
“How do you know how to build cat things?” Sherlock wants to know of John.
"Yes, quite bright, but frail and completely detached from her present situation. Most of her conversation is based around people and events from about 1970. Have you met any people with Alzheimer's before?"
He thought of kissing Janine, shuddering as he remembered how cold his lips had felt afterwards as her saliva dried on the delicate tissue. John’s saliva would be warm and coat his mouth like honey.
The boys gather around her at the table. They eat straight from the cartons with plastic forks or chopsticks as required, because there are no plates.
Personally, I thought Albion slept more soundly because the stars made him feel safe.
“Every night,” she says, anguished. “I’m running through this old factory kind of place, and I can hear this little girl singing, and then she says, “I’m in here. I’ve lost my shoe.”
(While three’s no doubt Mycroft was impressed by John’s bravery, he used this phrase entirely for my entertainment. His tireless campaign to ensure my contentment is an ongoing burden and blessing.)
John kneels down and realises he doesn't have his cane. For a moment he is struck with a complete blank, wondering where he left it.
I haven’t kissed, or been kissed by, John Watson since that night.
“But he’s dead,” Donavan says, almost like a plea.
Then he lifts his eyes and sees John’s war wound. “Oh! Oh, that is wonderful. No, don’t put your hand over it, come here, show me, I want to see it.”
"Potential flatmates should know the worst about one another."
It was quiet for a few seconds. I have no idea what she does in there but I am certain it would surprise me.
Sherlock chuckles to himself when he reads through John’s browser history the next day. That it matters to him, that John cares so deeply about Sherlock’s personal history, is delightful.  It is also impressive how widely John read to better understand Sherlock’s college – it takes Sherlock almost an hour to wade through it all.
“Romantic. Like the poetry computer and the bird that hoards things.”
Two days after John moved in, he is sitting over breakfast reading the morning paper. There are detailed stories in each one about the death of the Broken Beer Bottle Killer. There's also articles on each of the dead dealers.
Some time ago, Sherlock nailed this to the wall in another empty room in his mind palace before he left and closed the door:
Every plan he made revolved around the roof of St Barts. He had thought of organising a large mattress, a bungee cord, a system by which Sherlock could jump from the roof and survive and John could be there to see him. Alive.
“Shut up. We’re at big brother’s house now.”
"How did you find her?"
“The client.”
John’s next date is Caroline, an aggressive little brunette obsessed with television shows and determined to marry a doctor. Caroline met John in the café where he buys his morning coffee and she is, John is certain, the type of woman who will provoke a strong reaction from Sherlock.
Rosie stares at him. She doesn’t want to be big and strong like Gegg.
I wished I could heal the whole scar with my hand. John, meanwhile, was making observations of his own.
Jenny shakes her head slowly, as if she can hardly believe it herself.
fulfill them through other people. In that respect Sherlock and John could not have chosen more wisely.
“Sherlock, you’re being a pest,” his mother calls especially to tell him. “Why can’t you just wait for the big day?”
For he understands the buttoning of coats.
Nothing happens.
It takes a long time.
“Handsome,” Ademar agrees. “So you started living together that day?”
Sherlock was running down the stairs before he knew it, Rosie clinging onto his neck tightly as she bounced in his arms. He kept his grip on her and immediately reached down for the baby monitor, furrowing his brow as he examined it.
An hour and a half later found them both on a train en route to Brighton, where his parents had resided and been buried at several years ago. Sherlock had returned from the shop with actual groceries and nothing else, which John found strange but remained quiet about nonetheless. The ride itself was only an hour, and although John was used to Sherlock’s usual silence it still struck him as unnerving that he did nothing but stare out the window the entire time. John leaned glumly against his seat, watching the rolling hills around them eventually even out and lead to the flat lands of the beach.
Sherlock hummed loudly in response, John feeling the mattress move beneath him as he turned off the lights and laid back down.
The rain kept steadily pouring, still maintaining its loud roaring noise against the concrete, but despite it all Sherlock heard the unmistakable sound of clapping. He lifted his head immediately, blinking through his tears to see Moriarty standing a few feet away, a smug smile on his face as he slow clapped lazily, still holding his gun in one hand.
John narrowed his eyes a bit, Sherlock’s face remaining nonchalant until he started moving, smiling happily as he listened. “Thank you.”
John wandered into the kitchen, running his fingertips along the cold granite countertops before reaching the fridge. He wasn’t hungry, but since he’d neglected to eat anything today he figured he should try to eat something.
"honey you're a patient man, living in the moment
“I guess you’re right. It’s haunted for me.”
“Well, that’s good. She’s got the best two men in the world watching over her.” Sherlock came back in with an entire bag of sugar, dropping it with a loud thud onto the table.
Sherlock.
“Are you okay?” His voice was drowned out by yet another loud crack of thunder, and Sherlock swore he felt it resonate in his chest.
John gently slid his hand from Sherlock’s dark curls and down his neck, beginning to rub up and down his back gently. His stomach lurched as his fingertips made contact with his bony spine, not wanting to think about how much weight he’d lost in the last week alone. He swallowed thickly, taking a deep breath before turning his head slightly, mumbling into Sherlock’s hair.
“Oh! I nearly forgot! Dr Watson sent me a post card. Would you like to see it?”
“For couples?”
His eyes pass over their lounge room until he spots Sherlock’s violin. Everything suddenly becomes precious and irreplaceable.
Chapter 2.5
“But it didn’t make you happy.”
he replies helpfully. Detective Inspector Lestrade deletes it almost immediately.
“Tell me more,” we both said at the same time.
At that stage I didn’t. “Really? Why?”
“What are you talking about?” Sherlock asks him.
He heads home as Sherlock is heading out.
“Obviously,” he answers curtly. “Follow me.”
“It could be really friendly too. Maybe they all like working together. People are people, after all.”
John starts to pull on the suit without any question. Sherlock waits.
John grinned. “Yes, I do.”
"Little pin prick," and John drains the syringe on the left side of the wound.
“Then that, my accomplished, employed Watson, is precisely what you will have.”
Eurus takes some time out from her medieval studies class to join mummy in the media room.
This struck Anya as highly suspicious and she didn’t answer. She and John shared some low grade semi-hostile staring out.
There's no time to sleep and no time to eat. Sherlock's mind is whirring, processing possibilities and theories and discarding them at the rate of knots.
Sherlock is succinct. “I want the largest plate of hot chips you can prepare, and a bowl of tomato sauce on the side. The rest of you should order whatever you want. They have hot things on buns and drinks and the sorts of processed foodstuffs peculiar to sporting events. It all goes on Mycroft’s bill, and he has more money than he needs, so eat up.”
The underside of his lip is the colour of cooked rhubarb.
I looked at it, and John read over my shoulder. Albion was currently trying to pull his hair, which required a more advanced skill because it was so short.
By the end of the week, Lestrade had laid charges against two of the three suspects, but only one with charged with murder. (The man who had restrained the victim during the attack  got aggravated assault and detain with advantage. I spoke briefly with the third man, who still was in shock from witnessing the murder. It was obvious he had no part.)
"I'm going to pop out for an hour or two," he says casually.
My heart pounded at the sight of John’s doubting face.
"It's only three days a week."
"Okay. I have to scrub up and get some iodine. Don't go away."
“How?”
“That’s one accomplished little ghost, Dr Watson, singing Schubert.”
"Thank you Mrs Hudson," he grunts under the fridge.
“Have you had counseling?
She hasn’t forgotten his cold treatment of her. “I do, yes,” she says quietly.
They push their bodies together with great urgency; John watches with glazed, adoring eyes as Sherlock holds his fingers to his lips and tenderly tastes each one, then leans in to kiss his scar over and over. You feel so good, John whispers, I love how you feel against me. Closer, darling, come here, and they stare into one another’s eyes as they align their hips and twine their legs. They rub their cocks together with perfect rhythm and as he comes, John imagines Sherlock blindfolded, moving his knowing hands over every inch of his body.
It looks different from his day but it's busy, like accident and emergency wards are always busy. Moans and sharp shrieks are coming from all directions, intercepted with dull beeping noises from drips or monitors. Two nurses are seemingly arguing at the nurses' station, a doctor rushes past, heading in the direction of an unseen female patient who is screaming behind a curtain at the end of the corridor and over there is an older doctor in blood smeared scrubs - undoubtedly, thinks John, the house surgeon.
Our progress has been unusual, partly because neither of us could be certain exactly what we were progressing, and partly because any kind of relationship , until Albion showed up, struck me with blind terror.
“Not bothering. Perplexing. Is that who we are to you?”
At work the next day John, a focused man who also loves agendas, spent his lunch hour watching instructive videos on You Tube. On the way home he stopped at a large Boots chemist and picked up some supplies. He made a final stop at Waitrose and bought some pasta and vegetables. As far as he was concerned, part of his brief in keeping Sherlock happy included keeping Sherlock fed. Unfortunately he forgot about the dead pelican until it was too late.
Renzo can't wait to tell John his connection with Sherlock.
Very early next morning, Mycroft sends Sherlock and John two emails. The first is the address of Corrine Best, who was treated on the NHS last September, and is in receipt of a government pension. She is listed as living in Hastings.
Sherlock wraps his arms around him and speaks into his hair.
“Helping you?” The more information John gets, the more disjointed he becomes. “Why do you need help?”
“This doesn’t sound like it has a happy ending.”
Lestrade and John expect Sherlock to say some thing unfeeling and unnecessary, but sometimes he can surprise everyone.
He is interrupted by John’s firm, steady hand on his shoulder. “Sherlock,” John says gently, “We won’t be calling any constables. I think you’ve made your point.”
It was a nice feed, that night. John held Albion and applied the bottle while leaning back against me in our bed. I had them both in my arms and felt rather smug. I wondered if all fathers felt like this when they have their family gathered around them.
