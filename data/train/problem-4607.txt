Dean asks if Eloise had made any new friends recently, or if she’d brought home any old books, perhaps with occult symbols on the covers.
She shone brilliantly but looked so different, had changed herself. Altered herself to bear more resemblance to a human.
Castiel returned to himself with a shake of his head and Dean felt a little like he wanted to puke. He stormed back into the building and bullied the attendant into seeing the security footage. Sure enough, there was Sputnik squeezing her way out the window—FLOP—down she goes, lead caught on the door handle. She struggles frantically with it for a few seconds and slips right out of her collar. Bumps her butt on the ground and shakes it off like a champ. Kicks her feet as if ridding them of dust, and takes off toward the bushes.
“Come on, man! I wanna hit the buffet in town before your thing!” Dean already had the wheelchair unfolded, wheels locked and waiting by Sam’s bedside. “They’ve got fried apples and all you can eat bacon on Tuesdays!”
Sam shut up and sat down, tried to take up as little space as possible with his giant frame, tried not to watch how Dean’s hands had begun to twitch.
Dean smiles—fails and grinds his teeth to keep his lip from trembling; “I can’t do it alone… I can’t—I can’t let Sam get near that thing, Bobby.”
Strange enough, Dean can’t help but think of His Cas leaning in close outside the professor’s office and asking if he can do other things to Dean’s balls. It’s the same tone, almost the same expression. Dean kind of wants to laugh.
Sam forces himself to breathe deeper, slower; “How the hell am I supposed to watch his back? People will remember. They’ll—I could get him killed if someone notices us! I’m a liability like this!”
“Seriously though,” Ellen said with a sigh, “Three days. Eleven-AM. No food or water after midnight.”
Sam glared at him, scowled so severely Dean could feel the hatred in it. Dean just smiled back-- "Come on. Let's go, Professor X."
The municipal building’s upper floors reminded Dean of a hospital. Stagnant, whitewashed hallways, same smell, old brown and silver water fountains where the water only dribbled up out of the spout like it had no will to even splatter. Dean felt as if he could sympathize with it.
Dean pulled a box of files off the shelf and bent to page through them. The dog stuck her nose in and he pushed her away. “Lay off!”
The dog is dressed in a little vest and chewing on a tennis ball on a cushion in the corner and the world seems right with itself.
There is movement and silence, Bobby works Castiel’s sleeve up and slides a needle into a vein, hangs the bag of fluids from a coat hanger hooked on the curtain rod. They eventually drift away and leave Dean sitting there gripping Castiel’s wrist and palm counting the too quick beats of his heart, focusing, trying to PUSH with his grace, trying to carefully feed more of it into him.
“I’ve got a lot on my mind,” He tossed back the solids and dropped the package with all the stripes into the cart. Sam usually got solids, but Sam wasn’t here. “Christ I hate shopping.”
Stable environment, they said. Stress-free. They couldn’t give him anti-depressants until his ‘Nutritional Issues’ were under control. Weekly therapy sessions—Oh, yeah, Dean would love that, blood monitoring and monthly scans to check his brain function, anticonvulsants until they cleared him or made a formal diagnosis. The word hung at the forefront of Sam’s mind like a noose and in his thoughts he could do nothing but curse and rant and throw things because it was the angels’ fault. Dean wouldn’t have been hurt if it wasn’t for them.
Castiel blinked around, “This building’s primary construction is iron, it’s unlikely a demon would come here willingly.”
Jo took half a step forward and the trickster/angel’s eyes snapped to her; “You! Knife Fetish, don’t move.”
They made it all the way to Pittsburgh before the lack of pain in his belly and his medication fully took hold. Castiel offered to drive before Dean took the hint and backed the Impala into a little copse of trees just out of sight of the highway. Sat there staring at his hands for a few minutes, with a dazed expression on his face.
“Or we could do that thing that they do in the old movies where they string up popcorn and hang it on the tree?”
The grave site Dean had risen from looked like the site of a small nuclear event, with all the surrounding trees dead on the ground in a perfect ring and the grass still smoldering slightly. There were absolutely no distinguishing details about the scene that let Dean know exactly where he was.
“Oh? How’s that?” Dean said, and Cas first thought he was being deliberately, mockingly flirtatious, but when he looked into his eyes, Dean seemed genuinely curious -- even a little sad, despite all the “it’s fine”s.
Of course, there were a slew of difficult moments, especially at first. Like the first time they went up against a demon, and Sam looked on in shock as Dean stood his ground, frustrating the demon’s attempts to fuck him over and throw him against a wall thanks to the protective symbols stolen from hell tattooed on his arms. There was the time that Dean forgot himself after a different demon got a little too close to Sam, and Dean literally scalped the demon in a furious rage before they could even question it. There were all the times Dean turned down food, and drink, and sleep, and Sam looked sadly at him, somehow surprised anew every time. And worst of all, there was the time Sam casually mentioned that his birthday had been the previous day and Dean realized that he had completely forgotten the significance of the day. Sam didn’t understand why Dean was so upset by that, saying that they never really did much for birthdays anyway, but Dean felt worse than usual for the next week.
“No there aren’t,” Dean said. “All the wholesome families already did this weeks ago. It’s just us degenerates, now. 2, 3, 4,
“I think it’s more complicated than that,” Sam said. “Have you ever heard of a half-demon, half-human child?”
“Your lack of respect is appalling,” Zachariah hissed. “Did you learn insubordination from your rogue buddy Castiel, or were you born this way?”
They were quiet again until they got into the town -- some random, mostly quiet place in Iowa. It had one motel, and Bobby headed straight there. They checked every person who had checked in within the last week, and one name jumped out at Dean for some reason.
“Oh.” Cas said. “No, it’s not. I’ll call you again in a few days. The first step will be to find the archangel Gabriel, who I believe is also disguised on earth. I found traces of him, but you’re not needed until I close in further. He is one of the few angels who have actually seen God, so I believe he will be useful to speak with. If not extremely frustrating.”
Castiel just kept staring, perhaps not knowing how to respond to that. His borrowed nostrils flared just slightly, and Dean could swear that he saw a break in his flesh vessel, a view of the skyscraper-sized celestial form of the angel he had first become acquainted with. But the illusion was broken as soon as it had begun.
would be as a dad, which was all kinds of inappropriate. Dean would probably be only slightly weirded out if he knew that Cas lusted after his body, but if Dean knew that Cas was so softly picturing him with
“No,” Dean said, pushing the bottle of whiskey towards him. “Here, try something with a little more of a punch to it.”
“Actually, I feel like I should say now, I love you, Dean,” Cas said. “‘Dating’ seems a rather flimsy term for what I want to do with you, and if that’s too forward of me, you may as well know about it now. I love you so much, Dean.”
The Christmas Eve drinking game Sam had referred to turned out to consist of Gabriel shouting out a random lyric to a Christmas song, and whoever came up with a sufficiently dirty way to finish the lyric got to pick a person to take a drink. It was a clumsily conceived game, but thanks to the general drunkenness of their company, Gabriel’s never-ending repertoire of Christmas songs, and Dean and Jess’s creativity, the game went smoothly, with Sam taking the vast majority of the drinks. They ended up calling it quits when Sam’s attempt to stand to get a glass of water ended with him on the ground, with drunk and cheerful “merry Christmas”s exchanged all around. Gabriel grabbed Castiel before he could complete his escape.
Cas took a sip, and fought the urge to spit it back out. If it was “barely alcoholic,” then so was pure ethanol.
“Oh, yes,” Gabriel said. “Castiel, can you please clear the panic room so that me and Sam can ‘talk’ without his ‘girlfriend’ hearing?”
“We should go,” Cas said, disappearing. Dean did a last sweep of the area, picking up a few weapons the demon ghosts had flung away from him, and headed to the impala. Cas was already in the passenger seat, tapping impatiently on the windowsill.
, and as he clawed upwards, he could already tell that this particular onslaught actually had an end. A close one, too, judging by how quickly his outstretched hands managed to grasp at air and push against the ground. He gasped as he pushed his head through the hole he'd dug, pulling the rest of his body out of the ground and spitting out dirt. Clumsily, he rolled over and pushed himself into a standing position.
“I’ve nearly found it,” Castiel said. “I will return to you soon. Keep your eyes out, and don’t draw unnecessary attention to yourself.”
“She’s helping me,” Sam said haltingly, clearly still shocked. Turning back to her, he said, “Ruby, maybe you should get out of here for a second.”
“Cas, you don’t have to,” Dean said, but when the other man wrapped his hand around him, Dean was unable to hide his positive reaction.
is you trying to be nice?” Dean said, stabbing the knife into the table he was sitting at. The wood was old and crappy, splintering readily into a large, jagged divet. “God, my memory of you was
“No, seriously, I feel like we should take a turn around the garden together, or something. Like, you’re really sweeping me off my feet here.”
“Yeah, of course. Gotta make Christmas morning interesting, right?” Dean said. “Anyways, what do you think Jo would want? And am I supposed to get Jess something?”
“I do miss living in the same city as you,” Cas blurted out. His tolerance was alarmingly low, and he found himself in one of those moods where there was nothing he wouldn’t say to get Dean to pay attention to him for a little while longer.
“Oh,” Dean said, scooting closer. As if still afraid he might be slapped away, he reached out with one slow hand at a time, cupping Cas’s face in his hands.
REAL, DEAN WINCHESTER, IT IS NO FANTASY. YOU AND I MUST ACT NOW, BEFORE LUCIFER CREATES MORE DAMAGE THAT CANNOT BE REVERSED. HE HAS ALREADY CHAINED DEATH TO HIM. THE DAMAGE THAT HE CAN DO WITH DEATH’S POWER IS UNSPEAKABLE. SAY YES, DEAN. THE WORLD DEPENDS ON IT.
Angels had no need for breath, apparently, but Dean quickly ran out of breath, pulling back and panting embarrassingly. Cas didn’t waste a second, moving his mouth to the side of Dean’s neck and sucking, so suddenly that Dean involuntarily let out a moan. When was the last time someone had bothered to kiss his neck? It had been over a century, he was sure, and he had forgotten that he even had nerve endings there, had forgotten that it could feel good.
Before he could lose his confidence, Dean pushed himself away from the tree and strode purposefully towards the group of demons. Getting closer, he could see that there was a large bonfire in the center of the circle, but he couldn’t make out much else. He needed to get much closer.
“Do you really think so?” Castiel said, sounding slightly amused. “Which part of this strikes you as… bull?”
“It’s fucking one AM,” Dean said, intentionally making it sound like he had just woken up so that if it was a telemarketer they’d feel bad.
“Such the optimist, Cas,” Dean said. “There must be some kind of hope, right? Or else why bother to tell us?”
Unfortunately, yes. I am really me. I believe the forces of heaven have spies everywhere. They likely spotted us and brought us here for… whatever this is.
“This is no average demon,” Cas said, breaking eye contact. “Dean, are you aware that the demon Lilith has died?”
“Michael sends his regards,” the angel said, in a light growl. Beside him, the second angel smote another demon, and the demonic ranks spread further, some running for the trees and others using their comrades as body blockers.
, no,” Cas said. “First of all, it is not safe to travel on commercial airlines with pyrophoric chemicals. Second of all, we are
And if he woke up feeling flustered that what had begun as a sex dream about Dean had accidentally transformed into a sex nightmare about Bobby Singer, well, that was his cross to bear.
“Sure,” Cas said, entertaining Dean’s delusion that all the Christmas cheer was only enjoyable to Sam.
Who will this devastatingly handsome, morally gray young man pick? Will he succumb to the allure of Lucifer? Will he start feeling righteous again, and pick Michael? Or will he, masochistic as ever, attempt to pick Castiel, and remain human as the world slowly slides into decay? Stay tuned to find out.
- Dean had accepted, even before he was first dragged down by the hellhounds, that hell was where he deserved to be, and where he would have ultimately ended up even if he hadn’t made the demon deal. He didn't even look for a way out.
“Stand and fight, you fools,” Alastair yelled, sounding for all the world like his father had, whenever Dean had done something stupid and failed to take care of his brother. The third angel landed in front of Alastair, drawing a huge sword that sparked and glowed in the night.
“Why would you want to know about hell?” Dean said, widening the pit he’d made in the table. “Hell is hell. The place sucks ass. You want to hear me complain about how I was trapped in a place that sucked ass for a hundred years?”
“Believe it or not Dean, there are others like me out there,” Ruby said. “Most demons have taken Lucifer’s side, but there are some of us who recognize that following him is a horrible idea, some who are spying for us.”
“No, it’s not that,” Sam said. “I guess… I guess I’m just used to you wanting to back me up when things get dangerous, that’s all.”
not be in hell any more. Hell could have coffins, and dead trees, and flat land that extended forever, and innocent people whose heads needed bashing, but Dean had never known hell to have cars. The demons were a little bit behind the twentieth century, still.
“He might actually find that useful,” Cas said. “That's a good idea. How about this water filter for Jo?”
Cas’s weird reaction aside, that had been a good day. Every time Dean managed to save someone, he felt like he was inching closer to evening the scale. He certainly wouldn't live long enough to actually atone for all the souls he'd damaged in hell, but as long as he was working on it, he was able to get through the day in one piece. So saving over a thousand people in one go let his conscious rest for a whole afternoon, during which he and Sam went to a pool hall (without Ruby, luckily), and dusted off their hustling skills. Sam had gotten much better during Dean’s time in hell. Dean had gotten much worse.
“Or better,” Sam said. “Because I could kill her the second she betrayed me, but this angel could be betraying you as we speak, and we have no idea how to stop it. We have no idea if it even
“We’ll be gone by then,” Castiel said, fixing Gabriel with a vicious glare. “I just need to know one thing, brother.”
Oh, Dean, of course I do. I want you to say yes to Michael. Until I defeat him in combat, he’ll never see that my way is the right way. He’ll never stop trying to destroy me. I wish he could see reason, but he can’t, so unfortunately, you have become a very important puzzle piece. I need you to fall into place. Can you do that for me?
” Dean said. He hadn’t thought it would be that easy -- but then again, a lot of things seemed to be surprisingly easy with Cas.
“So,” Dean said, rolling over and looking at Cas with a puppyish expression on his face, “What do we do now?”
“All of… who?” Dean said. He looked a little confused. Was he freaking out? Cas was freaking out. Cas was going to repress this memory for all it was worth, he was never going to resurrect this memory, he was going to take back everything even slightly incriminating that he’d ever said about Dean, in fact, he would never say anything remotely nice about Dean Winchester ever again.
“Okay,” Dean said, rolling over so that he was beside Cas. He uncapped the lube, and put some on his finger. “So, you just go one finger at a time. Like this.” He felt a little embarrassed trying to open himself up in front of Cas, but the angel appeared so genuinely curious that it was hard to remain embarrassed for long.
“Your dumb little powers won’t work on Alastair,” Dean said dismissively. Sam was constantly bringing his "powers" up, and looking at Dean like he was expecting him to start yelling at him just for
“Our death is almost certain,” Cas admitted grimly. “I apologize for soliciting your help in this death mission, Dean. I see now that it was wrong of me to condemn you to the same fate as I.”
“I get that you’re obsessed with me, Alastair, I really do,” Dean said, holding out his arms. “But I don’t see why you needed to rebuild my father’s body. Kind of pathetic.”
Alastair picked up one of Sam’s hands and kissed it, swiftly dodging Sam’s swinging fists. He geared up to kick him, but Alastair finally gave him the frozen treatment.
Sorry, you must not have heard my question! I said, do you have any idea who your final pick is going to be? I mean, you have some pretty incredible choices before you.
“That was great, Cas,” Dean said, pulling the other man up to kiss him lazily. Cas draped himself over Dean and let it happen, kissing back gently until Dean’s lips were sore.
“So, get this,” he said. “Siobhan’s friends said that a little under two years ago, Siobhan had a minor psychotic break. Said she claimed she was being stalked by demons. They wanted to send her to a mental hospital, but then once she found out she was pregnant with her son, all the demon-talk magically went away. Until yesterday, when one of her friends got a frantic call from Siobhan, claiming the demons were back.”
“Let me see,” Sam said, grabbing for the binoculars. Dean watched him scan down the line and realize the same thing Dean had.
“Looks like you got into… some kind of something there,” Gil said, and then, mercifully, moved on. Dean supposed he had probably seen worse. “I can’t tattoo over that skin. There’s too much scar tissue.”
Cas had been alone with Dean a lot of times by this point -- they weren’t yet roommates, but they were still good friends. But none of those other times had been like this. None of the other times had seen them skirting around each other quite this obviously. Cas’s eyes adjusted to the dark enough to notice that Dean was closer than he’d realized, and staring right at him. Cas couldn’t help but stare right back.
“You shut up,” Dean said, pointing at her. “Sam, we’re taking this case. You should stay back and let me handle most of it, but we’re taking it.”
” Sam said. It was apparent that this wasn’t the first time this conversation had happened. “And some people are allergic to dust, you know. If you can’t clean it yourself, you should hire someone to come in every now and then.”
“Oh, you mean the apocalypse? What’s the point of that?” Gabriel said, his smirk faltering slightly. “It’s our whole plan, you know. Stage a Big Bad Apocalypse, pit Lucifer and Michael against each other, cause so much damage we force God to come out of hiding. You ask me, it’s not going to work, but why bother fighting it, you know? At the end of the day, I’m a bleeding heart. I just want my siblings to get along, and if having a
that Cas could never be mistaken for a regular human. But when he wasn’t thinking so much, and when Cas was with him in some quiet moment, like this one, Dean couldn’t feel his power, and almost forgot who he was really talking to.
“Times change,” Dean said, backing up. He was essentially unarmed -- Sam still had the demon knife, not that it would have helped at all.
He was mad all of sudden, mad that Sam had just expected him to pick up where they left off before hell, mad that Sam couldn’t understand that things could change, mad that Sam had been choosing a demon over him this entire time all while trying to make it Dean’s fault. He hadn’t called Sam in days by this point, and now that he was finally talking to him, he was longing to be alone again for some reason. How he could be lonely in one moment and furious at his brother the next, Dean wasn’t sure, but he was feeling an unignorable urge to burn it all down, to make Sam as mad as possible.
“I approve,” Sam said, smiling again and nodding in some way Cas couldn’t hope to interpret. “Not that you need me to, but I do.”
“Such as Samhain’s rising,” Cas nodded. “The town where half the people were infected with Croatoan. The killing of the reapers. Unusual possessions. Lilith’s death. All the strange astrological omens.”
“Oh wow, the garlands look great guys!” Charlie said, cheerily coming over to where Cas was assessing their progress. “Sam will be happy.”
Of all the people Dean couldn’t remember from his life before hell, how strange that that boy had made the cut -- his face perfectly preserved, his name long since gone. Thinking of the boy, Dean took out the black nail polish he’d just bought and carefully painted his middle fingernail. It looked patchy and horrible. How had that boy gotten his nails to look good? Dean attempted to cover the rest of his left hand nails, but they all turned out approximately as bad as his first attempt. His hand looked wrong, now, but whether that was because the polish was so bad or because it existed at all, Dean wasn’t certain.
“I know.” Dean says, quieter than he means to. He reaches up, pauses. Brushes Cas’ sweaty hair off his face. Rakes his fingers through the thick brown strands; they stick up in a strange angle. Dean has a flash of memory. Heat and light and thunder as Cas strolled into his life, unflinching and alien.
If it had been simple as ‘give me the girl or I’ll throw you back in the pit’ Dean would have gone. He probably deserved to be down there anyway, maybe he’d be lucky and if he came back a demon Sam would just stab him with the magic knife instead of trying to Pull him.
“That’s… That’s very kind of you to offer,” Mr. Novak sighs. “But I would hate to burden you with my incompetence as a teacher.”
“Ok, everyone stay seated!” Dean orders and begins the recount as soon as they sit still. Still only 40 students and the chaperones. He looks at Cas and shakes his head. Fear immediately shows in Cas’ face at the news.
“Mr. Dean, you act the same way I act with my girlfriend when you’re around him,” Claire counters. “You’re about as subtle as a sledge hammer.”
The only bright side to all of this was that Charlie had been placed on the first bus with Cas. So if she was going to talk to him about not quitting, that would be the time to do it. He could only hope she would be able to talk some sense into him when Dean failed to do so.
The screen once showing the instructor for Biology 1010 clicks off and Dean grunts as he stands from his swivel chair, immediately drawing the attention of his small class of five. “Alright, you heard the lady. Go over the practice quizzes on Canvas before taking the test, and make sure you get that research paper done by next week and turn it in.” He gives each of his students a playful warning glance until he gets to one student in particular. Hayden Foster already had her phone out, as usual, and completely ignored Dean. Typically, Dean was much more lax on the “no phone” policy than the rest of the school, but even he found himself getting a bit tired of Hayden’s “creative” ways to pretend she didn’t have her phone out. He fights the urge to let out a loud sigh and instead points to a blonde girl who sat on the floor at the very front of the room. “No late work accepted this time around, got it Claire?”
“...I don’t know,” Dean sighs with a slump to his shoulders. Garth nods and gives him a gentle pat on the arm. As soon as the school’s parking lot comes into view, Dean becomes antsy.
Even his choices when it came to the academic and work side. Reading through agricultural Power Points turned out to be rather educational. In a short time, Dean became the go-to man for any plant related questions. His new knowledge was able to help Sam and his girlfriend Eileen as they prepared themselves to grow a vegetable garden. Any other fun facts were definitely put to good use by his mother and her various house plants.
“Maybe we need to check the drainage too,” Adam nods. “If all else fails I guess we could re-pot them. Or burn them. Depends on how I’m feeling later.” Claire nudges him sharply. “I’m kidding!” Dean bites his bottom lip to keep from laughing and looks over to Cas. Relief washes over Dean when he sees Cas has a slight smile on his face and looks pretty proud.
Their fingers were touching. Just the tips of their pinky fingers, but it was enough that it sent electricity down Dean’s spine. He did his best to act casual, as though they weren’t touching like this. He tried even harder to control his breathing when he felt Cas shift his finger slightly closer to Dean’s. He completely allowed Cas’ pinky to slide underneath his own. They stare at their interlocked pinkies before looking up at each other.
“Cas?” he says quietly. There is no response. Dean swallows a bit as he closes the door behind him. He hovers over the other teacher for a moment, until he hears a loud sniff. He gently places his hand on Cas’ shoulder.
“We have rehearsal for the musical after school,” Mr. Novak frowns. Dean groans at the reminder. “It did sound like they would mostly be focusing on the student’s choreography at the beginning… so there should be time to potentially continue grading. As long as you’re not needed and it won’t be too much of a bother.”
“...wha…” Dean’s brain rapidly replays the last few conversations he had with Charlie. “Lance… we were talking about a lance’s stat in D&D, Cas.” The agriculture teacher tilts his head. “Dungeons and Dragons, it’s a fantasy roleplaying game for nerds. We--” Dean pauses and quickly lifts his head to scan the room. No one else was in there, but he lowers his voice anyways. “Charlie was asking me to help her come up with a new character for the game at MacLeod’s.”
“Ms. Bradbury then.”  Soda sprays out of Dean’s mouth and onto the floor like the whale splashes the audience at SeaWorld. Fortunately, he hadn’t soiled any of the student’s work, but that didn’t stop Cas from pulling the stack of essays closer to himself.
“Well there’s nothing to t--wait,” Dean blinks up at them. “He talks about me?” Jack and Claire nod. “Huh…”
But before his breathing goes out of control again, he feels a gentle hand touch his  shoulder. Dean looks and there’s Cas, smiling. He gives his shoulder a gentle squeeze as he mouths the word “breathe.” Dean immediately does so. The stage manager signals for the Bomont group to get into position. Cas is right next to Dean the entire way until they have to get into their positions.
Dean is about five seconds away from throwing himself into the first lake he can find when something incredible happens.
Footsteps thud from inside and a second later Dean comes face to face with a dark skinned woman. Dean blinks in surprise. She looks at the poinsettias in his hands then looks up in suspicion.
“But nothing Cas! If you’re with someone who doesn’t respect you and always makes you feel like shit, then maybe something's gotta change or end in the relationship!”
“You… never had to say it,” Cas mutters. “Your actions have always spoken louder than words ever could. So… I’ve known for a while now.” Dean grew tense until Cas gently squeezed his hands. “And I just wanted to let you know that… I like you in that way as well…”
“Dammit Gabriel!” Cas shouts as he’s tugging at the door handle. Dean could swear he hears a loud howl of laughter from inside the house as Cas leans down to retrieve a key from under the house mat. A second later, Dean has caught up to Cas. He has to slam both of his hands against the door to stop himself from completely crashing. The loud slap causes Cas to shoot up and crash into Dean’s chin.
“Not that it’s any of our business,” Claire clears her throat. “But you obviously have the hots for Mr. Novak.”
“However!” Charlie chirps and promptly shoves Dean forward. He stumbles a bit towards Cas, but catches himself in time to
“My mother always signed us up for our church’s Christmas pageant,” Cas sighs heavily. “And Easter pageants…”
“Not usually,” Mr. Novak doesn’t bother looking up from his grading. “Since I have the door closed during class. I’ve also grown accustomed to the sound of the greenhouse fans.”
you to focus!” she says and her hands squeeze his cheeks a little. “Are you absolutely certain that you are going to be ok to sing these next few nights?”
“Totally,” Dean responds over a mouthful of his own doughnut. “I had some very reliable sources tell me that you’re doing a lot better. So why not jump into the next level?”
“Yeah any time. And like, I’m not here to judge you on your relationships or anything, but just know that you don’t owe anyone anything either ok? A relationship needs to be balanced if it’s going to work.”
“And geese,” Dean adds and Charlie groans. “But if you hand over my present from Cas that you kidnapped from my classroom, then maybe I can convince Gabe to be the chaperone instead.” Before she has a chance to give her usual "I don't know what you're talking about," the classroom door swings open and Patience leads Kaia and Ben into the room.
“Charlie?!” Dean gags. Cas abandoned his seat to gather up paper towels for clean up. Dean immediately drops down to the floor to help. “Dude that’s even
“Right? I tried to visit him a couple of times before and he was just on the phone and just looking to see where the hell those midterms were. He found them after he called the sub and that’s when he realized what had happened. He told the kids they all had to retake the exam and you can imagine just how ticked they were.
insightful," Cas explains during a rehearsal where the adults had a break and the students were reviewing choreography. "It helps me to better gage what are the key points of the subject and what is just overbearing and useless trivia."
whatever it was they had going. He didn’t feel so nervous and uptight around Cas anymore. Which made it easier for him to be a little more open about himself, and a lot more comfortable about singing. Cas called him a jukebox on more than one occasion, but he still tapped his toe and bobbed his head to whatever song Dean was singing.
He stares at Bobby John just long enough for it to start snowing again. Dean grumbles a quiet “Screw it,” and takes Bobby John to his new owner. He makes sure to cover the plant as best he can from the large snowflakes falling onto the ground. Giving his boots a couple of good taps from the toe, Dean takes a deep breath, and pushes the door bell. A minute passes, and he’s still outside. Maybe the bell just isn’t working… he decides to knock.
Cas glances away. “My brother is sort of giving me a crash course in major pop culture references… just so I can understand you a little better…” Dean can’t help the huge giddy smile that appears on his own face. Before Dean can say anything, Adam and Claire are right next to the two teachers.
“Oh, I didn’t mention that the new agriculture teacher is a part of the cast?” she asks innocently. “Yeah, he was the first one to sign up actually before I had to start looking.” Dean swallows hard.
It takes Dean a total of five seconds after pulling up to Cas’ house for him to realize what the hell he was doing. He was about to make a grand gesture of romance towards this dorky new teacher. Who may or may not feel the same way about him?
It turns out that Dean was an excellent guinea pig for Cas' lessons. Thanks to his limited experience with agricultural topics, being none whatsoever, he could listen through each presentation and read through questions as though he were a student himself. The main difference however was that Dean had permission to let Cas know when some wording didn’t make sense or when Cas was rambling too much on a particular slide. At first he worried that it would just lead to Cas feeling utterly discouraged forever. But Cas didn't see it that way.
“Maybe a little,” Cassie giggles as Dean rolls his eyes with his entire body. Dean might have been imagining it as they walked off to a practice room, but he could have sworn that Cas looked a little sad.
the word “cute” over and over again, Dean can only offer him a thumbs up. Mr. Novak looks at the stacks of quizzes and lets out a long sigh. “What should be done about all of these? They’ll immediately bring down the student’s grades.” Dean opens his mouth to reply but then slowly closes it.
“The copy lady said she hasn’t gotten anything from you since before Christmas break,” Kaia explains. “She says to try one more time.” Charlie grumbles a few elvish curse words under her breath as she goes to her small office space in the back of the classroom. The girls follow their Drama teacher to the small office, leaving Dean and Ben in the main classroom.
“No big deal,” Dean shrugs. “It was getting to that point in our relationship anyways. I-I mean, relationship as friends! You know? I’m not trying to imply anything is happening between you and me.”
“I told him not to wear those,” Cas groans. “I specifically begged him last night to not bring those monstrosities in.”
He frowns as Cas turns away and goes back to the phone conversation. This wasn’t quite how Dean imagined their “reunion” would go. But it was Thursday tomorrow, so that meant it would be time for their second period grading agreement. He offers Cas a wave that goes unseen before he trudges through the exit.
When he only focused on Cas, he felt alright. Worries and insecurities simply melted away. The familiar urge to sing begins to overtake the urge to vomit.
know better. And he could tell that Cas was purposely creating space between them. It was obvious from the moment Cas assigned himself to the first bus and placed Dean and three other parents on the second bus. There were only two buses going up for this trip. So much for needing a co-chaperone… It was nothing but dental horror stories from Garth the entire forty minute drive…
“Looks like we’ve got a straggler,” Dean calls out and pulls the flower out. “BOBBY JOHN” is scribbled on to the decorative foil wrapped around the pot. “Claire, I think this was yours.”
From quick conversations with Claire and Adam, Dean couldn’t help but begin to worry about the direction the agriculture class was heading. It was never ideal for a teacher to be gone during midterms, and it was especially not ideal when the class featured a very specific topic. The substitute had no knowledge of agriculture whatsoever, and Dean could only offer a little guidance based on what he remembered from the presentations he had proof-read. It should have been all review sections for their upcoming midterm exam, but the next time the ag students come in, they’re vocally frustrated and confused about the difficulty of the exam.
“No. People usually refer to me by my full name.” A smile appears on his face again. “But, you’re right. It does feel strange when your colleague refers to you the same way as the students do. So, Cas is fine with me.”
semester so the kids had no fucking clue what any of the material was. Most of the kids didn’t even know until the report cards came out, and then came the angry phone calls from the parents. Not for the sub though. For Cas, because when they all found out what happened, that’s when he was feeling better and came back.”
the one who offered to help run the cash,” she says. Dean sighs, but it’s true. Cas had simply said, “Could you--” and Dean immediately said yes. What he had agreed to was running the cash register while Cas left for a meeting with the university. Mostly to go over the basic requirements and procedures that was expected from Cas as he taught concurrent enrollment the next school year. Dean couldn’t stop from smiling as Cas explained why he would be absent that Friday afternoon. Much like the poinsettias the students were selling, Cas had truly grown as a teacher. And yeah, it still sucked that it was just Dean with Claire and a kid named Jack selling the army of red Christmas flowers for three hours after school… but it was worth it for Cas to keep growing.
Dean shrugs. “If it wasn’t for you, I would still be tripping all over myself in trying to talk to Cas.”
“But no,” Dean finally says with a shake of his head. “No, I don’t regret anything.” He smirks and gives Cas a subtle wink through the dark. “Sure helped me get to know you better.” Cas’ eyes widen a bit and then he looks down at the seat between them. Dean is chuckling until he looks down as well.
He tries to imagine putting this into words that Dean would understand. He tries to imagine how Dean would
“Look.” He says, rough. Ruined. He speaks more softly. “I don’t. I don’t want to take… advantage of you.”
The worst part is how instantly he feels the absence of Dean’s voice, and how badly he wants it back.
And if the rate of growth continues like this, it’s going to start encroaching on things soon. Things he doesn’t need, arguably (all this intestine for such a simple task?) but still.
It had been many years since Sam let himself believe in the luxury of black and white morality. The heaven-good hell-bad false dichotomy that had been spoon-fed to him and made him so wholeheartedly believe himself to be bad. Evil and corrupt and dirty. Unsalvageable.
That spell did that to Cas. Turned him into something Cas was never supposed to be, something dirty. And Dean went with it. Was swept up in what felt like permission from Cas. Felt like endorsement.
She nods, notebook pushed against her chest. She pulls her pen out from behind her ear as he walks away. He can hear her ask for the rest of the orders before the bell above the door jingles and he's breathing in the cold damp air.
Kevin knows that Dean and Sam always wear their boots around the bunker but the floors are, in all honesty, pretty clean, and his socks are pretty thick (the new ones he picked up on a Wal-Mart run with Sam) so he just sort of shuffles around like a cat.
“Cas… Can we talk?” He looks up, meeting Dean’s eyes with a raised brow. He bends down and fills his cupped hands with water from the sink. Swishes the water around in his mouth, looking more and more solid. His eyes are clearer when he straightens again. He takes the coat from Dean’s hands.
Cas starts making little rhythmic noises into the side of his neck, insistent and suggestive— and how could Dean say no to that?
They hit a pothole and Kevin has to brace himself against the seat in front of him to avoid sliding off onto the floor. They planned a whole talk to have with Dean (him and Sam) about seatbelts, but there hasn’t been an opportunity yet. A good opportunity, anyways.
Dean sighs. Rolls his thumbs over the broad edges of the man's hand. Breathes out. A kiss to save Cas’ life. Maybe if Dean loved him enough for the both of them it would work. Dean clings to that and leans in, brushes their noses together.
And now, during their sexual congress, Dean’s soul had gotten far too close, and dragged its fingernails across the furrows it left years and years ago. It gathered together Castiel’s trailing grace, like a magnet sweeping up fine iron filings. Alive and thrumming. A little ball of combined soul and grace, grace and soul. The bond between them was too strong. It might have been okay if this was the first time. It
“Er.” Shuffling of papers, like the guy on the other end is reading a report or something. “Approximately fifteen feet of intestine.”
Dean’s humming to himself, the song they had been listening to when they pulled over. He’s tossing change in the air, counting his quarters. Some lyrics slip through, “eyes that shine… hm hm mm.. Dreams of you all—“
“I have a knife,” Kevin says. He has had lessons, on what to do with it, even. He’s used it for things he doesn’t like thinking about.
that would be. There can’t be a patient running around without their guts. They’d be dead. And that ruled out pretty much everyone Henry knows and speaks to.
“Some organs? Like which organs?” There is a long pause that follows this question, in which it does occur to Claire that wasn’t the right response.
Cas is standing there, face hot with rage and eyes bright. This close Dean was reminded the sun was a star and the dots that freckled the sky weren’t cold naturally. Only because of their distance. And in this moment Cas was deep in his own body. Holding himself together within the sinews and the flesh. Strung his being around the bones of his vessel and
Clearly, Dean was going to have to do some research about what the qualifications of ‘true loves kiss’ were. Cas was
“Um, like Texas America?” Harris says. At this time, a child nearby shrieks, and they both turn to see a goose extending its wings in threat. And when they turn back, the bench is empty. Only the flimsy white cardboard of the cake box flapping sadly in the damp grey wind, plastic fork still stuck deep in the green icing.
“Okay that’s enough.” Sam shoots him a look and Kevin suddenly remembers how tall the man is. And wide. He doesn’t think he’s met a wider man.
“Yeah, well I’m gonna be posing as a visiting professor and, no offense— but I don’t think you could pull that off,
It startles him so much that he goes to stand, too quickly and the chair tips over and hits the battered linoleum, and before the waitress can speak, or even move, he’s outside, a whole state over, and feeling very badly the effects of flying while not at full capacity. It’s taking a lot of grace already to stay alive with a foreign object nestled in his body, especially one that demands additional resources.
The answer is sort of in the question. He throws his phone down on the mattress and glares up at the ceiling some more.
Dean bundles him into the passenger seat and tosses their shit in the back. By the time he gets back from the final sweep through the motel room Sam is out, snoring against the window.
Dean had a habit of carving little notches on motel bed frames, pulling free pieces of cracked tiles in the bathroom or peeling up the silicone where it was rotting away from the fixtures. When he was a kid he did this mindlessly, but as he got older, and started thinking about it, he realized he was trying to make marks places. He wasn’t gonna remember any given motel room, but this way, even if only for a short time, the room would remember him.
sorry (SLIME SPEAKING) i was moving all month and now i am physically and mentally destroyed and my meds dont work anymore. we bring you road trip boys and crying into soup!
Look at what Dean got from John. Makes sense his kid would inherit some of his own worst qualities, too.
A twinge pounds through him, real and twisting in his guts. Turning him inside out for a single second. That’s new. Cas looks around and deposits Leliel’s dead vessel in a poorly cared for rosebush before spreading his wings again.
That train of thought runs into a wall. He wants to shake himself out, but the feeling, whatever it is--it’s in deep. Embedded far under the skin. Thunders to the same beat of that chant, lingering in his bones.
“Boring!” Dean cuts him off, teeth glinting in an unsettling way. “Uninteresting and unimportant, Sammy! We are talking about current real life not that stupid Greek—“
Dean nods and suddenly the room is empty. He’s been able to avoid this the last few days. Sleeping on his own uncomfortable chair through the hours the others went to sleep. But now it’s him and Cas and a big empty room and the idea hanging over Dean’s head that their first and only kiss will be a confirmation of everything he’s ever been scared of.
Cas gives him a sharp, cold look, but leaves the door closed. “Dean. I understand that kissing a man is an— an ordeal for you. But it isn’t a problem for me. You know that. If that’s something you want to work through, I’d suggest not doing it with someone you're co-parenting with.”
Jack had insisted they all watch Frozen together a while ago. Maybe Cas came to the same conclusion they had.
It had just slipped out. The professor asked if there were any questions and… yeah. Dean had some questions. A
“Becca.” Harris tries to say it quietly, since she’s only a few feet away, but she flatly ignores him. “Becca. Becca! Psst.”
“What’s this?” He asks, already taking them and looking them over. Dean keeps a hold of one to toss into the backseat for Sam.
about understanding them. He imagines a crude joke, but he can’t really guess what emotion would be behind it.
“There are so many things wrong with what you’re saying—! I said it because Jack deserved to hear it!”
Cleaveland at night looks more or less indistinguishable from any other American city, at least to Castiel. The road is wet, but it’s not raining. It seems to have just let up, and the few pedestrians he spots are carrying umbrellas. He walks with no purpose, and no direction. There is nowhere to go. There is, distantly. Castiel has things to do, in the way he
This chapter is Spruce's baby with minor flavor notes added from Salt. I was crushed by my job and recurrent anemia, and had to take a break from writing. But it packs all the expected gore and love, perhaps even more so than usual.
Dean had huffed and yanked his duffle open, pulled on his sleep shirt and jeans. “Nah. Too tired tonight.”
Dean’s heart goes out to him. Guilt like that isn’t easy to erase, or even ease. Hell, Dean was still carrying his own, decades after the fact. “ Yeah, well. You’re a Winchester. You gotta believe the good you’ve done outweighs the bad. That’s the only way any of us get outta bed in the morning.”
The atmosphere inside is sterile, hypnotic. The space feels both at once crowded and awfully empty. Castiel drifts through aisles of bathroom products, tupperware containers, toothpaste and hair products. He stops in an aisle, attention caught by the hanging sign, which proclaims it to be “Baby Needs.” The things that babies need, evidently, come in white packages. Sometimes yellow, occasionally pink and blue. The things that babies need are manyfold, and most of them largely unfamiliar.
“We took care of it,” Cas says, and then to Dean: “Call if you need something.” He feels like he’s going to spread his wings and find himself unable to fly, but then he’s away. He’s on a street somewhere in Cleveland, staring at a telephone pole full of staples—blessedly far from the Winchesters. But not far enough.
“Very much not the end of the story?” Sam is getting frustrated after a single rebuff. That bodes not fucking well.
“Look. I’ll leave the room. Go sit with Jack for a bit. You have an hour, okay? Then I’m calling Rowena again. I know her price is high but…” Sam shrugs, his eyes lock back into Dean’s. “If there’s a chance.”
“Cas.” Dean hasn't moved his hand. He pushes through Cas’ hair again and the man lets his head be tilted with the pressure, eyes drifting shut.
. His fingers moved against the current of the shower and stroked over his marked neck. He feels his dick twitch at the memory.
Kevin covers his face and has clearly stopped listening. Dean grumbles and slips into the Impala from where he had been standing with the door open. Arguing with a teenager. His ass crinkles a little as he sits down. Oh. Right.
Dean comes in from outside, the temperature difference taking it’s time to sink into his skin. He gets to the table, eyes locked on Jack. Jack looks up from his massive pile of pancakes and gives Dean a hesitant smile, so much smaller than it normally is that it snaps Dean's heart clean in half.
“Uh?” Dean reaches over to where Cas is pulling on the handle and shoves the door closed, “A whole hell of a lot? I...” He pauses, before taking the dive, “I
“No.” Sam’s voice is patient. Patronizing. “But… I think they might have been connected. It doesn't feel like an unsafe bet, Dean.”
Because if Cas loved him his response to their first kiss wouldn’t be rage or frustration— even if that had been a follow up. That wouldn’ have been Dean’s gut instinct if he had found out Cas had kissed him. Even if it was to save him from a magic coma. Maybe a few hours later when it all clicked, but— god, if Cas had kissed him...
Kevin sighs and turns on Dean’s music, which sort of sounds like he’s forgiven for putting his foot in his mouth during class. Dean makes the mistake of glancing to the backseat, where Sam is looking baffled and smug at the same time. Dean gestures and mouths ‘what’. Sam raises his eyebrows incredulously and mouths back ‘crisis?’. Dean pulls the lever on the side of his seat and shoves the front seat back into Sam’s shins. Kevin’s hair swings with the movement, but his mouth stays firmly shut, eyes still locked on the pamphlets.
Sam puts on his stern parent face and turns back to Cas and Jack, still tight in each other's space. “You just had cereal!”
A bird call splits the dry humid air. He turns. Above him there are four magpies on a branch. He traces the limb down to the tree.
Sam makes this face when he gets indignant. Righteous and wrinkled with a twitch in his mouth and a swing in his hair. “In what way?”
Without Cas here— his breath hitches. Without Cas here, this was going to be impossible. Without Cas there was no one there to balance out Dean’s ugly but Sam. Sam was good, and Sam was kind, but he wasn’t enough to even the scales alone. Not without Cas.
Dean hates this because Kevin has startled him and made him spill coffee on himself three different times, but wearing shoes indoors is just… the effort, the discomfort, the sweatiness.
. Weaving its way into his tendons and slithering up his arms. It isn’t about the pent up energy coiled in his muscles and it isn’t about the vibrations he feels lancing through his bones every time he takes a step. Everytime his naked skin brushes against something warm or something soft or something living or—
, that’s what brought him into the diner in the first place. But the smell, the taste. Nothing about it is appetizing. Even the diner at large stinks too much of grease.
There’s a knock on his door the next morning. Dean sits bolt upright. He can feel the pillow creases on the side of his face, deep. He passed out hard for eighteen hours and hadn’t moved.
“Yeah, but I threw most of it out when you weren’t looking. It doesn’t taste good.” Jack states, matter of fact, half of his face covered by the lapel of Cas’ trenchcoat.
“Momma.” Cas repeats notes of surprise in his voice. Maybe not just that… There was something else in that tone, too.
“Is Sam gonna come help us clean up this mess, or...?” He isn’t going to get an answer about cleaning the clothes. For the most part Cas is constant, but sometimes his powers seem to… fritz.
, Sam? Our best fucking friend dying? Leaving Jack with us for the rest of his life? Alone against the whole world with only us idiots for his back up?”
Sheet cake. It has colors in it. Muted pastels, not unlike the ones in the baby aisle. Funfetti, the label said. Cas can see the reasoning behind the name. Humans can be surprisingly incisive when they least intend.
He’s crumbled some brown sugar on top of the flakey crust to add a bit of crunch when the turnovers come out of the oven and Kevin slides into the room— socks undoubtedly picking up dust bunnies Dean missed cleaning somewhere. Dean turns to put the tray in the oven but says over his shoulder, “Nice timing. Fresh baked goods in fifteen.”
His arms were pleasantly sore, as if he had gotten a massage from someone who had been just a little bit too overzealous, and he tried to sink into that feeling in an effort to avoid feeling anything else. He paced around the room for a while, trying to burn off some extra adrenaline. Eventually, he realized that there would be no burning off the extra adrenaline -- it was just
“It was Alastair,” Cas said, looking up and fixing Dean with an icy stare, as though he knew exactly how Dean was going to react to that.
In the distance, it looked as though hostages were switching hands and being arranged in some deliberate way. A large fire was burning in the center of the circle.
Cas is the only person in this stupid show you’ve trapped us in that I’d want to talk to right about now, does that answer your question?
“Yes, you can,” Cas said, his eyes boring into Dean’s. “I know you can, because I’ve seen you there.”
“It’s fairly serious, Dean. We will need his help,” Cas said, rubbing his temples with his fingers. Dean noticed that he looked exhausted, more exhausted than he’d ever seen the angel look. There was blood all over his trenchcoat, and a weariness in his expressions.
“Just used to pain,” Dean said. He figured it was better to say that then the truth, which was that Dean wasn’t even
“Yeah, I remember,” Dean said. As he spoke, a series of images flashed through his head -- a dirt lot filled with old cars, a house crammed to the brim with weapons and books, a grumpy, ill-shaven man in a worn baseball cap. The images were all positive, and Dean felt, more than recalled, that this man was important to him.
“Oh really?” Dean said. “Did you also mean something different by befriending a demon? Am I wrong about your meaning there too?”
As they finished removing the dust and dead spiders from the room Charlie would be claiming (and shoving the actual important things Bobby would yell at them for throwing away into the closet or under the bed), Castiel was filled in on the plan for the next few days. It appeared that Jessica, Sam’s girlfriend of a year, wanted to be with him on Christmas, but couldn’t be away from her family for the entire time. Therefore, she was arriving on Christmas Eve, giving them one more full day to get everything ready for her arrival. This, the 22nd, was reserved for removing and hiding as many concerning or incriminating items as possible. Tomorrow, the 23rd, would be for going into town, finishing Christmas shopping, and the purchasing and setting up of as many Christmas decorations as the house could realistically be expected to contain. Christmas Eve itself would be when Sam was scheduled to have a mental breakdown when the place inevitably still didn’t look half as nice as Jess’s parent’s house.
Cut to a sequence of shots of Dean and Castiel sitting on two adjacent park benches by a lake. Dean and Castiel sitting in the Impala. Castiel standing over Dean’s bed in the dark.
“He’s vanished, and yes, we should still find him,” Cas said. “Eventually. However, we have different priorities now. Sam told me about your conversation with Alastair, and I believe I know now why Lilith is dead, and what their plan is. My superiors... they seem to agree.”
Dean attempted to communicate that he should keep going without moving his mouth. Luckily, Cas appeared to get the message, reaching down to twine his fingers in Dean’s hair as Dean focused and breathed through his nose, keeping his jaw slack. Truly, he had forgotten what this felt like, but he was starting to remember that he liked it, as Cas continued to make small movements all while letting out a truly satisfying stream of compliments and moans. It occurred to Dean that Cas had never watched porn, had never had sex himself, so had no idea what he was “supposed” to say or do. The realization made the entire experience so much hotter, as Dean realized that everything Cas was saying, he truly meant.
Cas abruptly reached out to grab his heavy, neglected cock, jacking him quickly, so quickly that Dean came in surprise within a matter of seconds. The angel wasn’t far behind him, stilling abruptly and breathing heavily. He pulled out and collapsed next to Dean, who swung a lazy arm around his torso.
Sam’s eyes slipped open, looking almost blue in the strange, angel-lit night. He seemed out of it, but focused on Dean quickly.
“Fine,” he said, carefully fishing an ice cube out of his drink and taking the needle from Dean. He held the ice cube behind Dean’s earlobe and shoved the needle through Dean’s ear in one quick motion. “Can we talk now?”
“Sam is meeting us here,” Cas said. “You were nearly dead, so I had to remove you from the scene and heal you before anything else. By the time I got back, Sam had gone.”
“Interesting,” Dean said, momentarily forgetting to censor himself and act like he had already known about the handprint.
Cas walked over to join him, holding the blanket out as an offering. Dean shook his head, so Cas wrapped it around himself. The lamp did help some, but not enough.
“Again,” Sam said, turning to Cas and trying to win him over with a smile. “We really owe you, man.”
“Are you trying to ask me if I’m attracted to men or women?” Cas said. He was only messing up his tie further, the more he tried to pull it off, and Dean compulsively reached out and untied it for him, letting the straps drop back on his chest.
don’t know your brother like you think you do,” Zachariah said, surging forward to touch Dean’s forehead again.
“I don’t know how the fuck you think you can help me,” Dean said. “You can’t magically erase hell, so what can you do to help? Nothing.”
The sun was too much. It was so much that Dean couldn’t do anything at first but slam his eyes shut and cover his face with his arms. But after a few moments of confusion, he was able to straighten up cautiously, and assess his surroundings through squinted eyes.
“Okay,” Dean said, nodding. “Because, like, I don’t want to pressure you into anything, you’re a fucking
There had been a time, when he was younger, when Dean had legitimately believed that the worst thing about him was his occasional attraction to men. John’s influence, of course. Once Dean started hunting primarily by himself, before Sam left Stanford and joined him, Dean had gotten over that hang-up with an aggressive, fuck-you gusto, enthusiastically fucking men and women all over the country without a single thought to what his father would think. But he’d never done anything to change his appearance, never done anything permanent that would let his father know how far from normal his son had gotten.
“But I want to,” Cas said, carefully pulling Dean’s pants off the rest of the way and beginning to mouth at the tip of Dean’s straining cock. Dean gripped at the sheets.
“No, you dolt, it means that he’s even more of a coward than you are,” Gabriel had answered without looking up from his phone, as if it was so obvious that he hadn't even needed to think about it for a second.
genuine in his desire to defeat his brother, wasn’t just in it for the power trip. The poor bastard wouldn’t accept that his father was dead, and would monologue with touching sincerity about how much better the world would be once evil was stamped out and God’s Creation could exist in peace. Dean had tried to talk some sense into him, but it never seemed to work.
Cas barely had time to despair about the influx of people he was apparently going to have to deal with tomorrow, due to a call from Sam. He had reached the airport and Jess’s plane was landing any second now (early by twenty minutes, how nice), and the news caused everyone to simultaneously panic about the fact that they hadn’t even started on cooking or getting ready.
They spent the next half hour in the nearly-empty tree lot, painstakingly smelling every remaining Douglas Fir. The top two ended up being a normal-looking one that Dean claimed smelled “only kind of good” and a tree with a slight crook in the top that was obviously emitting the best smell of any of the trees on the lot.
They banged their heads against the figurative wall for weeks. Even low-level demon activity seemed to be dying down, for reasons unknown. It was getting difficult to find minor demons to interrogate.
“My brother,” Dean muttered. Memories of his brother still seemed hazy, like memories from two or three lifetimes ago, but they had slowly started to come back, the longer Dean spent topside. His most concrete one was of a boy, around seven years old, smiling up at him as they set off fireworks over an open field. When had that happened? How old was his brother now? Dean had assumed he must be dead, until he’d glimpsed the date back at the gas station and learned that it was only 2009.
“Oh, really,” Bobby said, sorting loudly through a drawer now. “You just walked right out of hell? Sounds right.”
“Why are you laughing?” Cas said. He couldn’t help but laugh a little too. Dean’s laugh was so infectious.
“We could play spin the bottle,” Gabriel said, winking at Cas, who began sweating a little. He had long since developed a Pavlovian panic response to Gabriel's winks.
“That reminds me!” Sam said, and darted off to begin lighting all the candles that Dean had correctly predicted he had purchased. Looking at one enthusiastically burning candle called “Christmas Blessings”, Castiel had an unfortunate vision of Gabriel setting something in fire “on accident.” He wondered if Sam would notice if Cas moved all the candles to higher shelves.
It turned out that the only way to handle the demon ghosts was to exorcise them, which would have been all well and good if they would have all just let themselves be herded into the giant devil’s trap Dean had made. Unfortunately, the demon ghosts seemed to delight in hiding in the most random of places, just out of range of where they’d be affected by an exorcism, and then jumping out and trying to kill Dean again just after he thought he’d finally gotten them all. Dean had gone through four rounds of exorcisms when Cas appeared, grabbing a ghost Dean had missed by its incorporeal hand and smiting it.
“No,” Dean said immediately. “The angels don’t take orders from humans. They pulled me out for some type of heavenly plan.”
Back when he was a teenager, probably sixteen or seventeen, Dean had had a brief crush on a boy at one of his many high schools who painted his nails black, had his nose pierced, and wore thick eyeliner every day. His dad had seen him say something innocuous and nice to the kid one day and given him shit for it.
“Well, we’re not calling it a ball, per se,” Gabriel conceded. “We’re calling it a holiday party with formal attire, music, and guests. Or something. But, you know. Similar end result.”
“Oh,” Dean said, nodding and sipping his beer. He didn’t seem to be freaking out. In fact, after they were done at the bar, he consented to crash at Castiel’s for the night instead of his motel, so clearly things were fine, right? Maybe Dean had magically failed to hear any of what Castiel had said.
“Dean,” Cas pleaded. “Did I not tell you that Lucifer had been freed? I thought I didn’t need to say that this is bad,
Such a shame, such a shame. He’s a huge fan favorite, you know. Incredible physique. Alluring voice. And, to boot, such a noble cause.
“Wait, you let Sam disappear?” Dean said. If he hadn’t felt awake before, he definitely did now. “Alastair got him?”
“I understand why,” Cas said. He ran a hand through his mussed hair, then seemed to remember himself and surged up to kiss Dean. Dean was certain that Cas would be able to taste himself on his tongue, but that didn’t seem to bother the angel, as he licked eagerly into Dean’s mouth. Dean found himself unable to do anything other than let it happen.
“Ah, this is your way of trying to seduce me, isn’t it?” Dean said, smiling salaciously. He knew he had Michael. “Do you know what me and Cas
“Did you kill Lilith?” Dean asked, in a lower voice than usual. He tried to move his arms, but found that they were up against what felt like an invisible wall.
He finally stopped in Bismarck, where he dumped the car and got a room at the cheapest motel he could see. His plan had been to clean himself up a bit and hopefully make himself look less suspicious, but Dean found that looking at himself -- his impossibly 29-year-old self -- in the blurry mirror was an unnecessarily uncomfortable experience, so he quickly abandoned any cleaning process that was too involved. He took off his sweaty clothes, clumsily rinsed the dirt off his skin, and put the clothes back on.
“Hey, I’m really glad you and Jess are getting along so well,” Sam said, looking a little too sappy for the occasion.
Downstairs, the chaos with the tree was beginning in earnest, as enough people had woken up so as to cause a chain reaction, forcing everyone else to wake up as well. Sam in particular was sounding shrill enough to induce even Gabriel out of the panic room.
“All right,” Sam said, kicking in the door. It came entirely off the hinges, falling back into the cabinets behind it.
“Is that good?” the angel said softly, voice so low and gritty that Dean felt a chill pass through his full body.
He bent down and sucked at the head, and that was the final straw -- Cas was coming in his mouth with a soft shout. Dean normally had to tell himself to pretend to enjoy this part for his partner’s sake, but Cas seemed so
Hmm. I see the problem. Now is not the right time, is it? Poor Gabriel. These family squabbles are so hard for him to bear. He just wants it to end.
Listen, Dean, I thought it might come to this. My brothers don’t know, but there is actually a third option.
- Dean was in hell, but the world above went on as usual, for the most part. Ten almost-normal months passed during the hundred years Dean was in hell.
“Some people prefer sharp blades,” Alastair said, thick spit dripping down his face. He didn't even bother to wipe it off. “I think blunt blades are so much more fun, though. Takes more time. Really lets you
They were seated on two adjacent park benches somewhere in Minnesota, overlooking a small lake where ducks and other waterfowl were swimming around and squawking at each other. It hadn’t even been a full minute, and already the ducks seemed to be taking an interest in Castiel.
They left the bookstore thirty minutes later, with the books for Sam and Dean, as well as a calendar of cute animals Cas thought Charlie might like.
“I don’t want to fight with you, Dean,” he said in an insincere tone. “We’re supposed to be on the same side.”
any of the pain he was supposed to be feeling each time the needles pierced his skin -- he only registered the feel of the gentle vibrations of the machine. If anything, the feeling of human contact each time Gil wiped away the excess ink or pulled his arm a certain way was actually pleasant enough so as to render the experience positive overall.
“Yes,” Cas said, all potential objections out the window in favor of observing the way the snowflakes looked when they got caught in Dean’s eyebrows and eyelashes.
Dean really did deserve more credit than Cas had been giving him lately. A part of Cas had still seen Dean the way he had been when they first met -- intimidating, cocky, overzealously committed to no commitment, and the type of person to always subscribe to arbitrary “rules” that would allow one to always keep one’s hookups at an arm's length. But Dean hadn’t been that way for a long time, it was obvious now. Dean had changed Cas, that had always been clear, but Dean had changed himself too.
