“Captain Rogers is pregnant,” The A.I. replies, completely unfazed by the information. She appears to be the only one.
This time Steve does look up at him. “You weren’t supposed to remember. You’re only supposed to mate with me and produce a pup. I’m only meant to be bred. I always have been. You were the chosen alpha.”
He’s tempted to call Tony back to properly explain the situation, but he doesn’t. If Tony could easily walk away from the team, from him, then there was no denying that he’d do it a second time and walk away from their baby.
“We’re having a baby,” Steve whispers. He trails a hand down to Tony’s flat stomach, resting his palm against the spot where their baby was growing.
Tony smiles and leans forward, his forehead resting against Steve’s. He trails his hands up and down Steve’s arms, rubbing them softly.
It was Sam’s idea that Steve get a job as a counselor and run his own sessions. Steve had been hesitant at first. His plan was to stay home with his children. They were still young and needed his attention. But when he brought the idea up to Tony, the alpha didn’t hesitate to give Steve his opinion. After discussing it thoroughly and thinking it over until his brain couldn’t think anymore, Steve made the decision to become a counselor and aid others like him.
“I do. Alpha...he’s a bad man, Tony. A very bad man. He’ll find me and…” Steve shudders at the thought of what’s in store for him. He had been punished when he escaped the first time-forced to stay in a cold room and birth his pup alone. The punishment could’ve been worse, but Steve had been lucky then. He couldn’t say that now.
“He’s fine,” Tony assures. He immediately senses his omega’s distress and he comes over to console him. “Honey, he’s okay. This is his room, remember?”
“Miss Potts,” the older man greets with a smile and he steps into the room. The other man with an arrow follows, piercing blue eyes scanning the area. “I’m Agent Coulson and this is Agent Barton and-” he waves a hand in Natalie’s direction. “-you’ve met Agent Romanoff.”
“T-Tony,” Steve chokes out, his eyes filling with more tears. He tries to speak again, only for another sob to escape him. Tony is at his side in seconds, dropping down to the floor beside him to hold him close. “Tony!” Steve cries, clinging onto him tightly and burying his face in Tony’s chest.
Steve brings Morgan close and places a kiss to her forehead. He allows his lips to linger against her soft skin, almost as if he’s afraid he’d never get a chance to kiss her again. His body is wracked with sobs again, the sound heartbreaking to hear.
“He’s going to help,” Tony assures while he rubs soothing circles along Steve’s back, “and then pretty soon you’ll be okay. You’ll feel like yourself again.”
“Is lying to the Avengers a good idea?” Tony raises a questioning brow. The last thing he wants is for his son to get a lecture from a super spy, an ex-assassin and a soldier. He doesn’t worry about Bruce. But the Hulk would be an issue.
“Shit!” Steve cries out and his hands slap down on the counter. His eyes squeeze shut and his legs wobble, threatening to give out. He breathes steadily through the pain, small groans escaping him when the contraction peaks.
Morgan decides she’s no longer hungry and she heads toward the kitchen. Her papa is in the middle of getting breakfast prepared. He shoots her a smile, only for it to falter when she doesn’t give him one in return.
Pepper sighs. “I know these past few months have been...difficult. You’ve been stressed and on edge. I know what happens when you get like that.”
One of the men has taken advantage and issues a hard punch to Steve’s face. The hit is what reminds him where he is and what he’s supposed to be doing. The strong pain in his stomach is once again ignored while he fights off his attacker.
“What?” Tony asks, brows furrowed in confusion. He wonders what he did this time. It’s then he realizes the wet stains along the front of Steve’s t-shirt. “Are you leaking?”
“Eh. I try.” Tony shrugs and accepts another bite when it’s offered. “So...the shower is at one. Anything you want to do before then?”
As soon as Morgan is back at the tower, she jumps out of the car and rushes for the front door, making sure to wave goodbye to Happy before dashing inside. The rule was to wait until Happy could escort her inside, but she was fine. She is all grown up now and didn’t require an adult to hold her hand. At least that would be the argument she’d use when her papa asked.
She keeps her eyes locked on his while she eats. Steve leans down to place a kiss to her head, not caring that she’s still covered in blood and other fluids from the birth.
Peter and Harley aren’t even in the living room anymore. Harley is sitting at the dining table while Peter takes over breakfast. Both are too occupied to notice her slipping out the front door.
Something about his encounter with Pierce didn’t sit right with him. He thinks about the omega currently waiting for him upstairs, and he wonders that maybe, just maybe he was the one Pierce was looking for.
“Tony?” Steve says, his voice cracking slightly. Tony glances up to meet his gaze, dark eyes full of confusion and fear.
Steve stares up at him, his blue eyes full of confusion. Tony wonders if the poor guy has ever had a positive human interaction in his life.
Steve hums in agreement. “Yeah. I guess taking in a dirty mutt from off the streets was a good idea, huh?”
Steve is the calmer of the two. No surprise there. He seems content. Tony wishes Steve would share some of that calmness with him. While Steve rests, Tony is restless, pacing the floor of the private room and trying to find a way to calm his nerves.
“Maybe I’m getting better at this,” Tony says and Peter nods his head while giving him a thumbs up. Tony chuckles and ruffles his son’s hair. “Slow down there, kiddo.”
I told myself I wasn’t going to update but then I finished the chapter and thought maybe spoiling you guys wasn’t that bad...right? 🤔
He should have known that he was pregnant. All of the signs had been there and he chose to ignore them. He should have taken better care of himself, of the child he was supposed to nourish and protect. He failed.
Peter looks around at the sullen faces of his family, hating how heartbroken they all appear. Bucky and Natasha have tears in their eyes, and it’s obvious Bruce and Sam are trying to be the strong ones.
Pepper offers him a small compact mirror. Tony takes a look at his face, frowning slightly at the sight staring back at him. He reaches up and gingerly touches the bruise on his cheek, wincing from the tenderness.
“I figured you’d want your sweatshirt back. I’m sorry for taking it,” Steve says and hands the article of clothing back to its owner.
Miraculously he makes it through the countdown. He’s left panting for air and his lower half burns. He lifts his head to ask about his husband.
They return to the restaurant they had gone for their first date. It’s just another sign that tonight could be the night Tony finally pops the question. Steve keeps his cool throughout the evening, but it becomes difficult when Tony orders a bottle of the restaurant’s most expensive bottle of wine, and when he doesn’t let go of Steve’s hand and continues to compliment him.
“Why? Because we fucked that one time or because you actually think I’m a good person? I’m gonna go with the first one.”
Tony cups his mouth when the sob makes another attempt to escape. It wasn’t Steve’s fault. The night of the party was when Tony should have come clean and told Steve how he felt. Steve only assumed what they did was a one and done kind of deal. Tony doesn’t blame him for thinking that. That’s the vibe Tony gave off.
Steve frowns and continues to run his finger on the line, following the trail. “You know I’d be doing this if I could. I never wanted you to suffer. I was willing to do it all.”
But no really I’m not. I just like throwing in some drama here and there. This story just happens to have a lot of it 😏
Happy just rolls his eyes and promises he’ll be nearby if he was needed. Tony thanks him and closes the door.
“Tony,” Happy takes control over the conversation. He presses down a little harder on the accelerator. “This baby’s coming now.”
Steve’s eyes fill with more tears and he sniffs, quickly reaching up to wipe them away when they escape. “My other pups...they’re…” he pauses and takes a deep breath. “Remember I told you I wondered what happened to them? The worst thing happened. They’re…”
Dodger seems pleased with that response and he runs out of the lab, barking when he’s not followed right away. Tony shakes his head and takes Steve’s hand, then they’re following Dodger.
He’s still slightly grumpy, but he sits up anyway and stretches his arms over his head. “What’s up, Fri?” He asks, hoping she had a good reason for waking him.
Steve’s face heats up at those words. Hearing those words used to make his stomach churn, but that had been when other alphas had said them. This was Tony saying them and Steve believed every word he said.
“You don’t need him. I honestly wanted to kick his ass when I found out what he did. You’re my best friend, Steve, and I’d do anything for you and this kid. I promise to protect him with my life. And unlike Stark, I’ll keep my promise.”
“Are you okay?” Pepper asks and when Steve nods, she adds, “I’m only asking because I wanted to check on Tony. He should be finished by now.”
But now Peter was feeling that jealousy all over again, and it wasn’t over stupid comics. Ned didn’t have to deal with morning sickness, angry parents, or having to tell Flash that he was going to be a father. Ned could still wake up every morning without having to constantly dwell or think about an unplanned pregnancy. Ned could finish high school and get into a good college. He could still have a life.
“Is something happening between you two?” Steve asks, and he waggles his eyebrows in a teasing manner. Peter groans and covers his face with his hands, wishing he could just sink through the bed and disappear.
“I know, kid. It’s getting cramped in there, huh?” Steve gets another kick in response, this time harder than the one before and he winces. “Okay, don’t take it out on me. We’re almost there.”
Peter nods and quickly rushes out of the apartment. Once in the elevator and making his way down, he loses his composure and cries.
Bucky doesn’t sit down in the chair, he makes room for himself on the bed beside Steve and holds him close. It reminds him of all the times he’d care for Steve when he was sick in bed.
Tony only chuckles. In the background he can hear Sarah giggling, Harley screaming and Peter joining in with his own ear piercing wails.
“Oh. Well then. I guess I’m talking to a bunch of family members. That’s a great plan, Tony. I mean that’s basically what I did for Trip, just more… efficient.” Steve sat down heavily on the sofa, a little stunned at how quickly the planning had gone while he had just stood there absorbing the feeling of Tony’s hand on his shoulder. He took a deep breath. “We also have to plan our own attack on the facility where they’re keeping Bucky.” He chanced a glance at Tony, who, surprisingly, didn’t visibly tighten at his words. He looked instead at Rhodey, who was still watching him. Rhodey didn’t smile, but he gave Steve the tiniest of nods.
After that, he and Tony grew even closer, and with Tony came Bruce. With all the time that Steve was spending at the Tower, he got to know Bruce a lot better. They had more in common than Steve would’ve thought. He was just as brilliant as Tony, in his own way, but he tended to move through life a lot slower, which Steve really appreciated. He lacked Tony’s impulsivity and boldness – he didn’t really have the luxury of either. Steve had his own moments of boldness, but they were usually a result of stubbornness, not impulsivity. They shared a love of tea and jazz, and Steve felt like he could be quiet with Bruce in a way he couldn’t be with anyone else. So much about this time period was too fast for Steve, so it was nice to slow down sometimes. Steve also used it as an opportunity to talk to Bruce one-on-one about training. “I know you’re not comfortable training with us, at least not here, but I’d like the opportunity for us to make the Other Guy,” Steve had learned that was how Bruce preferred to refer to the Hulk, “a real part of the team. It’s possible we’ll have to work together in the future, and I want to make that as easy on you as possible.”
“Indeed, this quinjet is not fit for immediate response,” Thor agreed. “It looks like Anthony landed here, and look, there is a trail. His suit must have been damaged in some way.” They followed the path apparently made by Tony dragging his suit behind him. They followed it to a barn with a very strong-looking lock around the door handles. Steve looked around. He hated to break in, but the suit path definitely led into this barn. He was just about to break the lock when he heard a noise be him.
Tony was fiddling in his workshop when suddenly a bag of Doritos and a box of Pop-Tarts plopped down in front of his face, startling him out of his trance. He looked up to see Clint standing there. “What the hell is this?”
“Nah. I mean probably, he’s a spy, so he’s suspicious of everything. But no more than anything else. He’ll either assume that you got fed up trying to learn the tech or that I SHIELD-proofed it because I didn’t want him spying on me.” Steve nodded. He was interested to learn how many people underestimated his brain. He’d thought that when he got the serum, people would stop underestimating him, but they just shifted their focus. Turns out, you couldn’t get rid of people’s preconceived notions about you.
“I know you wouldn’t ask without a good reason, but I like having my team in the know. We recently had an incident where some of the SHIELD hierarchy almost burned our team. They’ve bonded pretty intensely. Skye hacked SHIELD to get information on a classified op that Fitz and Ward were on. And you might think Simmons is malleable, but she didn’t have any trouble shooting Agent Sitwell when he almost interrupted.”
Tony bristled, but Steve smiled and responded first. “Sure, me too. But that’s not what this is. Besides, we wanted to verify that you were, well, really not dead, before we got their hopes up. Your supposed death hit them pretty hard. Clint in particular.” Steve knew Clint had nightmares about the agents whose death had resulted from Loki taking over his brain, and he wasn’t inclined to soften it for Coulson. Tony may have been prepared to go in guns blazing, but Steve, in his more subtle way, was just as angry.
“Fair enough. Thanks for the update, JARVIS.” Steve stepped off the elevator and everyone stopped talking.
Steve blinked at Natasha in amazement. “Okay, wow. No, those are all true. I never even thought about it.”
Steve chuckled. “I was Captain Fucking America. I pretty much did what I wanted, and Gabe was one of the best men I knew. To tell you the truth, I pretty much did what I wanted before I was Captain America, I just got beat up for it a lot more.”
Eventually, his solitude was disrupted when Natasha came and knocked on his door. “Fury would like to speak with you,” she said with no preamble.
Steve ended up spending most of the next day at the Schwarzman library on 5th Avenue. The building had apparently been there since before him, but he’d never been in. As it was a weekday, there weren’t very many patrons, and the group of librarians was more than happy to help Steve figure out the system. He checked out a dozen books along with several movies, including both versions of
“Clint,” Steve interrupted. “I need you to stop for one second. Take a breath. You did surprise me yesterday, I won’t lie. I’m not any good at it, anyway. But you didn’t surprise me for the reason you think. When I was growing up, no one woulda just said it like that. It was dangerous. Forget jail, it got you killed. But you absolutely do not have to worry about me being a bigot. I don’t know if you’ve heard, but I pretty famously hate bullies. When you said that Bucky was pretty, I thought it was amazing, how much things have changed.” He tried for a smile. He knew he was rushing, placing so much trust in his teammates, but he trusted his instincts. “Hating you would be a little hypocritical of me.” He waited as Clint’s eyes widened as that sunk in.
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony said with a smile. “You’re always right. I’ll get you a gold sticker later. Could you go away now please?”
“Yes to the audio. I’ve got a year of surveillance stored on-site and another ten years backed up off-site. I find it extremely useful in business deals, and it definitely came in handy after I became Iron Man. You wanna wait for the other musketeers or go ahead and get started?”
For the first time, Clint pulled his gaze away from Phil. “We already talked about this, Cap. Any call you want to make, I’ve got your back. You think we should bring him in, we’ll bring him in.”
He smiled warmly at her, trying to see the girl he'd known under the white hair and wrinkled skin. "Bit of a surprise for me, too, if I'm being honest," he replied.
Steve chuckled and Tony looked up from where he was working. He didn’t speak, but raised one eyebrow at Steve, who relayed the text messages. “Well, it’s nice that the spy twins are having fun. When will you leave for DC?”
“Who was he to you, really? His picture is one of only two personal items in your possession. I also want you to tell me what happened to him. Subtle isn’t your strong suit, Rogers. Whatever you feel about him runs deep, and it’s painful. I can’t explain yet, but I need you to trust me.”
“Damn, that’s probably true. Well, that just means I have time to come up with the perfect date.” Though her words were brisk, she rubbed one hand over his shoulders in comfort.
"Um, hi everyone. I have some… interesting news. I've been doing a lot of work scanning for events like the wormhole." At that, Steve noticed as Tony tightened just the tiniest amount, but he said nothing as Jane continued. "I thought, maybe, anything that showed the same energy signatures might be Loki. Thor said he escaped with the tesseract, which is how the original portal formed, right? So anyway, I've been looking for him."
“Whatever I think, he says. Like he’s all agreeable and malleable. Well I’m going to take you at your word and do it exactly how I want to. When are you coming back to New York?”
Steve laughed his way through another story about Gabe. This trip had been a good idea. He’d taken his bike down to North Carolina, hoping the drive would do him some good. He’d spent the first two days of his visit talking about Gabe during the war and hearing stories of his life after. It had been healing in a way he hadn’t expected. Gabe had led a full and wonderful life and was survived by the love of his life, a wonderful daughter, and a grandson who was on the track to living up to his legacy. Now, though, it was time to tell Trip (he’d been informed that only grandma got to call him Antoine) the other reason for his visit. “Ma’am, I appreciate your hospitality more than I can say, and I can’t tell you how much I’ve enjoyed talking to you, but would it be possible for me to speak with your son alone?”
“Excellent idea, Brucie-bear!” Steve could feel his insides freeze at Tony’s nickname for Bruce, but Tony didn’t seem to notice, because he continued without pause. “J, get her number for Cap.”
Spending time at the Tower also put him in the path of Thor. Thor was easy to like, and although he was clearly used to being in charge, he seemed content to follow Steve’s lead as part of the Avengers.
“Wow, that’s really good,” she said one afternoon, appearing over his shoulder to look at his drawing of Tony in the Iron Man suit.
Steve spent the next few weeks working with Natasha. She gave him scenarios to describe and they talked through how to tell the lie using pieces of truth. Eventually, he started to see it as a sort of strategizing. He practiced several of them with her, and then she set him loose on the rest of the team. “Start with Bruce. Training wheels. Then Tony, and wrap up with Clint.”
Steve cleared his throat. “Well, it is approaching dinner time. We were about done here if you guys wanted to get some dinner. I’m trying to figure out what food I like best. I’ve mostly been eating at the SHIELD mess.” He shrugged. “We used to boil everything, and didn’t usually have meat, plus we were rationing during the war, so SHIELD seemed like a big improvement, but according to Clint and Natasha, it’s maybe not as good as I thought. They took me to a Chinese restaurant yesterday, and we’re supposed to have Indian food tomorrow, but maybe you could suggest something else for me to try?”
As Steve walked away, his extra-sensitive, serum-enhanced hearing just picked up Tony’s chuckle. “Shit, he’d better hope that none of the villains figure out how scared he is of beautiful women. Aliens and Hydra, no problem. You walk into the room and he can’t escape fast enough.” Steve heard Pepper’s light laughter fade as he walked away.
Bruce frowned. “They don’t have anyone on record as being a prisoner, but to be honest, I’d be willing to bet at least some of the scientists are there against their will. They might’ve gotten in too deep before knowing what exactly they were getting into.”
“Alright then. Bucky is alive. He apparently got injected with some version of the super-soldier serum, survived the fall from the train, and was captured and subjected to some form of torture and mind control. He was turned into the Winter Soldier, an assassin who has been active for decades and who Natasha is familiar with. I’d like to find him, but believe it or not, it’s lower priority than what I’m about to tell you. You can’t share this with anyone on your team unless and until they’re cleared by us. Non-negotiable.”
"I loved it. I thought it was an amazing lens on Achilles' and Patrocles' relationship. And her writing was wonderful. Thanks for the recommendation." Steve smirked internally at Tony's obvious surprise.
“Oh no, I meant it,” Steve corrected. “I was just wrong.” He hesitated, unsure whether he could really
“Yeah, that seems reasonable. I never fell in love with Rhodey. And despite my obvious allure, he never fell in love with me. Although that could be because he’s straight.”
Steve just stared at her. He realized that she did look a little like Bucky’s baby sister. Maybe that had been enough to reach him. He thought this would probably be a lot more shocking if he hadn’t already been told Bucky was still alive, but he still had no idea how to respond. He’d already known he had failed Bucky, but a quick death was very different from decades of torture and brainwashing. He was saved answering by his new cell phone playing an unfamiliar song. After pulling it out of his pocket, he realized it meant someone was calling him.
“Boy, you sure had me fooled. Not only are you not a good little soldier, you are openly asking me to deceive your commanding officer. I’m so proud.” Tony paused to look at the object in his hand, where his tinkering had never ceased. “I’m not going to be your obstacle there, Cap. It’s Romanoff you need to worry about. I know future you is all about the team, but I don’t know if they’re all there yet. Thor won’t be a problem, and Bruce certainly has no trust for the man. But Romanoff is a spy, second only to Fury. They sent her in here undercover to get a read on me. You saw her with Loki. You’d never know she was lying to you. Never mind that her assessment is from when I was imminently dying. She seems loyal to Barton, and Phil’s death hit her hard, but I think Fury still pulls all her strings. Barton probably won’t be our leak, but he won’t stop her from doing it.”
Without Tony having to say anything, JARVIS immediately projected the recording. Steve and Tony settled onto the couch to watch. They saw future Tony fly in through the window to watch as their current (past? If Steve still got headaches, this would give him one) team threatened Loki. On-screen, future Tony scoffed, “Mr. Rogers, I almost forgot, that that suit did nothing for your ass.” As future Steve replied on-screen, current Steve turned to raise an eyebrow and smirk at Tony.
She let out a surprised giggle. “There are movie versions now. Several, actually. The BBC one with Colin Firth is my personal favorite, but the Keira Knightly one is great, too.” The rest of the Avengers and Rhodey were watching this exchange with interest.
Steve gave a half-smile. “Yes. Extremely symmetrical. I confess, I like my rooms a little better now that Nat and Clint helped me decorate it and it doesn’t resemble a sad retro hole, but still. Nothing there that I can’t move here. If I had to. You know.”
"Sure, I'll send someone out to get it in the jet." Thor and Bruce left to get started. "Anyway, you've given out assignments to everyone else, teacher. What are you planning to do?"
“That would be a masterful tactic, though,” Natasha argued. “Surrounding yourself with the enemy and making them trust you. Look, I want to trust Fury, too, but I think actually talking to him is too big a risk.”
Tony nudged Steve with his elbow where they stood behind a shipping container. “Look there she is. She’s glowing – they must’ve injected her with Extremis. We have to save her, Steve. It’s my fault she’s in this mess, and she’s my best friend.”
Steve felt a wave of grief for the Peggy he'd known. "Thanks, Tony. I don't want to talk to her in public, either, though. Any ideas?"
, on the other hand. He’s right. You did know what this would do to him. You recruited him. You listened to him when he wanted to break orders and recruit me. You’ve been the person we trusted most for
Steve sighed. “Yeah, Loki disguised himself as me. He did it earlier, too.” Steve frowned at the memory.
“He’s right. You were right. Barnes – Bucky – didn’t do this. Hydra did this. And I realized that that was only part of it. You said that you thought that future you didn’t tell future me. It just… it felt an awful lot like that other Steve picked Bucky over me, and I took that pretty personally. Which is crazy. The other thing Barton oh-so-helpfully pointed out was that if it was Rhodey, I would probably be pretty… let’s call it intense. Bucky is your best friend, and I should have been more understanding of that. We’re going to get him back, and we’re going to get Hydra out of his brain. I’m sorry.”
This chapter starts out in Tony's POV, then shifts back to Steve's for the duration. I hope you enjoy it! <3
“Agreed,” Steve said. “Natasha and Clint, I’d like you to work with Sharon, Fury, and Hill to do assessments of all the small teams. I don’t want to have situations where the SHIELD agents are overwhelmed by Hydra.”
A few weeks later, she asked him to get dinner with her. As they sat eating pasta, she decreed that they should skip the shop talk. He raised one eyebrow at her and she smiled in return. “So, tell me about Steve Rogers in the 21st century. You like your StarkPhone? What’s your favorite thing about it?”
“You always did process faster than I did, buddy. Thanks. Send him a text from me. ‘Come home. We found Rapunzel’s hidden tower.’ It’s a good thing Clint made us watch Tangled last week. He’ll get that reference.”
“So what, she loved you more than you loved her? You really did dig the blond secretary but you felt guilty?” This was the most flustered that Steve had ever seen Tony, and they’d fought aliens together. Steve wanted to fix it – he could see that confusion was a hard thing for someone as smart as Tony – but he was having a hard time actually saying the words.
“That’s a text message.” Tony tapped what looked a little text bubble from the comic strips Steve used to draw. “It’s like a… like a telegram, but instantaneous and directly to your phone.”
“No, I said Rhodey is working it from his end. They’re trying to trace the Mandarin’s signal. He’s going to different locations. So far, it hasn’t done much good. Anyway, yeah, your plan sounds fine. I’ll head to Tennessee. I’ll let you know what I find out.”
“Wait, why did she shoot you?” Bruce looked totally perplexed. Steve laughed and told the story of first picking up his shield.
they look like they’re probably sociopaths – CIA rejects, ex-cons, etc. – or they’re vulnerable when they're recruited and their handler is Hydra. Imagine you have nothing – no family, no friends, or not many, no real future, no one to turn to – and someone in a suit comes to you and says they’ll save you. They’ll give you a chance. How do you feel about that person?” Natasha’s eyes flicked around the room.
“No change. I’m actually calling because you have a visitor. She says her name is Maya Hansen. I was at the office, on my way out and she asked to talk to me.” Steve saw a flicker of recognition cross Tony’s face.
“Bruce, can you work with JARVIS to figure out what the hell these people were working on? I’m guessing they want Tony because they hit a wall and need someone smarter than them to fix it. Half-finished tech can still be dangerous, though, so I’d like to know what we’re heading into. Clint, can you and Nat talk to SHIELD, see if they have any information on Killian. They were pretty useless on the Mandarin, but having an actual name might help. See if you can figure out where they took Pepper. JARVIS, can you patch me through to Tony?”
Phil looked like he was about to speak, then stopped himself. Natasha said, “What we have to remember is that these aren’t just people operating undercover. They’re sleeper agents. The most effective method is to form genuine bonds with the people you’re deceiving. Play cards, go for a beer, or, in our line of work, risk your own life to save theirs. I know you’ve probably gone through a lot with your team, Phil, but we can’t let our vision here be clouded by emotions. People you directly recruited are probably sound, but they may not be ready for the level of deception required here. As long as Cap agrees, Clint and I are both fine with you telling May, with the understanding that she’ll tell no one. But you should come to terms with the fact that at least one member of your team is probably Hydra.”
One afternoon, after Steve had been coming by to sketch for a few months, Tony seemed more jittery than usual. He wouldn’t make eye contact and he turned the music up so they wouldn’t be able to talk. Steve knew he could wait Tony out, so he settled in on the couch where he usually set himself up. After a couple of hours, Tony cracked. “J, music off. So, um, I wanted to tell you something. I mean I don’t want to, but I think I should. I mean you should know, I just wish someone else would tell you. But I can’t think of anyone who would. Or could. Anyway, it’s about Aunt Peggy.” That was maybe the last thing that Steve had expected. “I don’t know how much you know about her life after you went into the ice. But, um, she got married.” Tony said all this very fast, and it occurred to Steve that he thought it would hurt Steve to hear about Peggy loving someone else.
“So this is going to sound a little crazy, but that’s apparently the kind of people I hang out with now. Natasha looked into you today. She wanted to make sure you weren’t a plant to lure me into some kind of trap.” Sam opened his mouth, but Steve shook his head and interrupted. “I did not think you were a plant. It would have been a stupid trick anyway. You are the first non-SHIELD person I’ve actually asked to hang out with, so the odds that I’d just talk to a random guy I met running were slim. But then she went and got Tony involved – ”
Natasha actually cracked a smile. “Gutter brain,” she said softly. It took Steve another moment, but then his eyes widened and he looked over at Thor, who looked rather smug at this reaction.
“Ugh, now I wanna take it back. Anyway, if you rescue Barnes, they’ll know you’re not Hydra and the game is up. We have to coordinate his rescue with the elimination of all the Hydra threats. We can pretty easily get the information on a coordinated attack to the main SHIELD locations – HQ, the Triskelion, the Hub, the Academy, the Fridge, the embassy locations we have in all active countries. The problem will be the little teams – ones like Coulson’s – where one or two of their trusted teammates is secretly Hydra.”
“What the hell, man? You can’t answer your phone after you fight aliens?” Steve looked up when he entered, but the annoyed- and concerned-looking black man didn’t even seem to notice him.
“Okay, how’s this. We bring their emergency contacts to the tower for an all-expense-paid ‘grand prize tour’ with the Avengers. No one would turn that down. Then we – and by we I mean Cap – talk to them. They can record messages of themselves talking with Cap, list the Hydra and non-Hydra members in each group, plus the planned time of attack, and then we have them all send them at once, and boom, we’re ready to go.” Tony threw his arms out in a mimed explosion.
"That Natasha?" Sam asked. Steve nodded. "I'd do what she said, too. Damn. Give me your phone. I'll put my number in. And hey, if you ever wanna come down to the VA, make me look cool in front of the girl at the front desk, I'd be up for that." He handed Steve his phone back, then winked and smiled at Natasha, who gave a feline smile back.
“Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you,” Tony answered cooly. Steve smirked, immediately flashing back to Tony telling him the same thing. “But this one he didn’t tell us. We were digging into an unrelated SHIELD issue and found you instead. You look pretty good for a dead guy. Not as good as Rogers, granted, but still. Pretty good. How you been?”
? You’re standing there, after I kicked you out of your home for three days, thanking me for being your friend?”
“Yeah. I mean she’s terrifying, but I guess she’s beautiful, if you’re into that kind of thing.” Steve smirked.
Her smile was bigger this time. “No, on second thought, I think you’ve done everything right.” She walked back to the living room. “Let’s go, Clint. I’ll let you buy me some ice cream.
"Actually, that's not why I called. I came to a location where I detected a similar signature, but it wasn't Loki. It was a stable gravitational anomaly… but then things got weird. I apparently disappeared for five hours, but it seemed like only a few minutes, and when I got back, this cop tried to grab me and everything sort of… exploded."
He had noticed that a lot of people expected him to be a lot more… hateful than he was. Things had changed a lot, but as far as he was concerned, it was mostly for the better. They seemed to have forgotten that he’d been fighting against bullies his whole life, and in his experience, there was a pretty significant overlap between bullies and people in power. His first major fight as Captain America hadn’t been against Nazis, but against his superior officers, who’d wanted to cut Gabe Jones and Jim Morita from his squad.
“Yes, I’m very concerned about how my ass looks in my alien-fighting pants.” Steve turned back in time to hear Scott Lang say that as far as he was concerned, it was America’s ass. They watched as STRIKE team, including Rumlow, came out of the elevator to take the scepter and future Tony explained to Scott that the whole team was Hydra, although they hadn’t known that at the time.
Steve sighed internally but nodded back. "Rumlow." He couldn't figure this guy out. Before the Battle of New York, Brock Rumlow had mostly ignored him, which suited Steve just fine. According to Fury, Rumlow and the rest of the Strike team were among the best SHIELD had to offer, but something about Rumlow just rubbed him the wrong way. "Things are great." He wasn't sure what to say – he and Rumlow had never been alone together. Luckily, he didn't have to do anything. Rumlow finished getting his things together and headed for the door. As he walked by, Steve heard him whisper two words.
“Wounded. I’m wounded. Did anyone else see that knife embed itself in my chest? I can’t believe you’d doubt me. Do I question your spy skills, Mata Hari? No. Leave the tech to me.” He shifted his gaze over to Steve. “Come by the lab later. I’ll let you… convince me.” With that, he swept off.
“Move it to the top. It’s an excellent movie, for all there are no women. It’s based on the story of how Eliot Ness brought down Al Capone. Now, Capone had bought a lot of the guys on the force by the time Ness got there, so he didn’t know who to trust. He teamed up with this older beat-cop, Malone. You know what Malone told him? ‘If you're afraid of getting a rotten apple, don't go to the barrel. Get it off the tree.’ Don’t look for allies just within SHIELD. Find your own people. I’d stay away from SHIELD academy – you can’t be sure whether Hydra has infiltrated the teaching staff. See if any of your Avenger friends have allies who aren’t SHIELD.”
“Keep it simple, Cap. I’ll give you a call in a day or two and tell you I’ve been working on some outfit upgrades. The one you’re wearing is clearly tapped out. I’ll come up with something for some of the others, too. Wouldn’t want them to be jealous. Now – ”
When Steve and Clint swung by to pick up Natasha, Steve saw the two of them exchange a loaded glance that ended with Clint giving a tiny smile and Natasha looking at Steve with a nod. He assumed that was Clint’s way of telling Natasha that they were cool. Clint had apparently succeeded in getting in touch with Thor because he and Bruce were waiting at the tower when they arrived.
Tony cleared his throat, seeming mildly surprised by Steve’s enthusiasm and easy praise. “You can’t have come down here just to ogle my toys,” Tony prompted again.
After the credits rolled, Steve sat back. He’d been unaware that he’d even leaned forward. “Well, you’re going to have a job topping that next movie night,” he grinned. “I look forward to the attempt.” Thor left almost immediately after the movie, thanking them for sharing the day with him, although in truth, it had only been a few hours.
responsible,” Natasha interrupted harshly, finally moving to stand behind Clint and putting her hand on his shoulder. “You had no control over that. None. None of the deaths were your fault. You have nothing to feel guilty about.” She turned to Phil. “
“Wait, consultant?” Bruce interrupted. “Like you’re a part-time Avenger they pay by the hour so they don’t have to give you benefits?”
“You invited a terrorist to your Tower in the middle of New York City. A building where hundreds of civilians work every day. You wanna tell me what the hell just happened?”
“Good way to keep things in the family. The world I grew up in was a mess. Way I see it, not that much has changed. Order isn’t a bad idea, Schmidt was just too loud about it. I don’t seem to have too much trouble getting people to do exactly what I want them to.” Steve used one thumb to pop the top off a beer that Kaminsky had placed in front of him and took a long drink, never breaking eye contact with Rumlow.
“And then that cycle came all the way around when he brought me in.” Natasha pulled him away from his grief with a nudge of her toes to his thigh. He smiled and wrapped his hand loosely around her ankle.
Trip looked surprised. “You mean besides the fact that it was the Nazi science division that captured my grandfather and that he spent his time in the war trying to dismantle? Plenty, actually. Why?”
Natasha, clearly sensing that Bruce was about to pull Steve up onto a soapbox in defense of both Tony and abused workers everywhere, attempted to get the discussion back on track. “SHIELD wanted Tony as an engineering consultant. He’s developed some things for us over the last few years.”
Tony shrugged. “Sure. So what we need is an introduction to Hydra that Cap has met and they haven’t. Someone from before their time.”
women – even when it got the shit kicked out of me. There’s a lot of bigots still out there, but I was kinda hoping you wouldn’t be one of them. I know times were different then, but – ”
“Shut up, we both know that’s a lie. You had to say some things – things Tony told you to say, by the way – and now you feel guilty. Don’t be such a martyr, Rogers.” She gave a tiny half-smile as she paused. “He also said to tell you that he’s going to use the transmitter you planted to get everything they have on Bucky. We’ll get him back. He told me specifically to tell you that he promises. By the way, does your type include brunets? Asking for a friend.” Steve sputtered, but she ignored him. “Now text your new friend. Get his address and tell him we’ll swing by to pick him up. He has 20 minutes to get pretty.”
When Steve tapped it experimentally, a tiny keyboard appeared. “What does he mean add his number to my phone? And damnit, how did SHIELD think I was going to catch up using the stupid old phone they gave me? Gradual isn’t useful when it comes to tech. I just have to keep unlearning and relearning everything. The other phone didn’t have a keyboard. It had letters on each of the number keys. And I never needed to type anything. Plus the screen was tiny. And black and white. Do they think I’m afraid of color?” he groused.
“You’re understandably uncomfortable with brainwashed killers, and I definitely meet that criteria, so I assumed you’d want me out.”
Oh. That was actually an easier question than he’d been anticipating. “Oh. No. Bucky was family. We were never like that. He liked men, I think, but he always liked women just fine too, and that was easier then. I think, for him, it would’ve been hard to fall in love with someone he was trying so hard to keep alive. He was always looking out for me, but in the way of a guy dragging his sort of annoying kid brother out of trouble. He would’ve given anything for me to stop picking fights I couldn’t win. I loved him, but I chafed at him taking care of me. I wanted to be his equal. I don’t think I could’ve fallen in love back then. I was too busy trying to fight everyone. Then, after the serum, there just wasn’t that much time. I mean I guess there were offers, but I always wondered if any of them really saw me. Maybe, after the serum, Bucky and I could’ve fallen into something, but then there was the war, and then he was dead. Or so I thought.”
And over the next couple of hours, Steve fell in love. He fell in love with the beauty of the sets and the man reading to his grandson and the storytelling. He was the perfect audience – tearing up when Buttercup thought Westley dead, gasping when they were attacked in the forest, laughing over Westley’s battle of wits with the Sicilian. He watched with rapt attention all the way through the end, as Westley told Inigo Montoya that he’d make a good Dread Pirate Roberts.
Steve entered SHIELD, wearing all the stealth and recording gear that Tony had made for him, prepared to see Director Fury, but hoping that he’d have the opportunity to see Pierce first. Luck was with him. Pierce was standing outside the elevator as Steve got off. “Captain, I know you’re very busy, but might I have a word with you?”
The day after meeting with Peggy, Steve went for a run. It was early, before dawn. He pulled out his phone and the fancy Bluetooth headphones Tony had talked him into and headed for the monuments. As he settled into the run, he called Tony.
Neither of them spoke for a moment, just breathing quietly. The longer the silence went on, the tenser Steve got. Suddenly, Tony started to laugh. Steve was rather taken aback. He hadn’t known what to expect, but it wasn't laughter. He straightened his spine, realizing he’d been leaning closer and closer to Tony as he talked. He’d started gathering up his things when Tony grabbed his wrist with one hand as he waved the other frantically.
Tony tried not to crack a smile, automatically imagining Steve’s response to Doritos and Pop-Tarts as a meal. Then he remembered everything he’d learned from Steve three days ago and the urge to smile fell away. “Where’s the coffee, Legolas? I can smell it.”
Clint was right. Steve loved the movie. After it was over, Thor left to meet Jane, and Steve talked the others into giving him some book recommendations – he’d only read non-fiction since he woke up – and Tony and Clint told him that he should watch some TV shows. Tony was angling for
“Well there’s not that many unions, to be honest. And I’m not an Avenger. Iron Man yes. Tony Stark no.” Tony didn’t glance at Natasha as he said it, but Steve rounded on her anyway.
“If you’re going with ‘but,’ you clearly have no idea what I’m thinking,” Steve cut in. “You do remember I’m the same guy who planned to drive a stolen Jeep behind enemy lines to rescue a guy who was probably dead, right? They came for Happy. Any idiot can see he’s your family. And if they fuck with you, they fuck with us. We’re a team now. So skip the apologies. What do you know?”
Author’s endnote: Okay, so here’s what you need to know from Agents of SHIELD (this note covers both this chapter and future chapters, so don’t read it if you’re unfamiliar with AoS and don’t want to know). Most of my inspiration/use of them will be from the first couple of seasons, so that’s what I’ll discuss here.
“J, pull up the pictures from SHIELD’s founding. I know Howard had some in storage. Cap, take a look. Anyone look familiar?”
“So Nat is trying to set me up on dates,” Steve told Clint over a beer and a baseball game a few days later. “With women. I know she said I passed intro lie training, but I doubt that’s enough to fool Black Widow. Do you think she knows I’m gay and is trying to get me to tell her?”
“Hey there, Agent.” Tony gave him a wry grin. Phil relaxed a little, then felt someone come up behind him. He didn’t turn, but heard them close the door.
Steve looked up from where he was taking the old tire off, only to see that the car was backing up. He saw Clint start jogging faster, waving his arms, but it was too late - the car was swerving out into the right lane of traffic. They usually got here after accidents. He’d forgotten how loud they were.
While the two of them were bickering about it, the elevator door opened, and both Pepper and Rhodey walked in. Pepper visibly faltered seeing the five of them spread across the room, but Rhodey took it in stride. Tony lit up at their entrance. “Back me up here, Rhodey. Cap needs to watch
Steve shot him a mild glare and tried again. “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Colonel.” He stuck out his hand.
There are a couple of lines here from Winter Soldier, but keep in mind that this is actually about a year before the events of Winter Soldier take place (actually during the time period of Thor: the Dark World).
In mid-December, Steve was making dinner one day with the news on his TV in the background. He hadn’t been paying much attention to it – he was mostly thinking about what exciting things he could do for Christmas at the children’s hospital – when Tony’s voice pulled him from his thoughts.
He could feel his heart pounding, wondered how Tony couldn’t hear it. Steve nodded. “Yeah. I just can’t imagine keeping anything from you. Can’t imagine a universe where I don’t have you on my side. Where I’m not on yours. Bucky means a lot to me, yeah, but it’s not like…”
“On your left,” he said as he approached, so as not to startle the man. He loved the freedom of running in his new body. Despite the years he’d lived in it, he could remember what it was like to struggle for nearly every breath, and it never seemed to get old.
Steve laughed. “That sounds like her. When we have more time, I’d love to hear all about what it was like growing up with her, but I’m afraid I don’t have all that much time for chatting tonight. I need your help, and I need you not to tell anyone, not even SHIELD.”
“I don’t know, man, I just work here,” Rumlow said with a laugh. “All I know is that we were supposed to take it to Dr. List. I’m sure he’s got all kinds’a shit planned for it. Weapons and experiments.”
Clint and Natasha both nodded. “J, start running pattern analysis on SHIELD agents, their missions, hobbies, smoothie places, favorite colors, etc. Let me know when something pops.”
Phil Coulson trudged up the stairs to his office after what had been a frustrating day for him. He opened the door and walked in, struck by the immediate sense that something was off. He tensed, his hand going to the weapon at his hip. Laying on his desk was a complete set of Captain America training cards, mint condition, all signed. His desk chair spun around.
"I never doubted it. You're a good man, Clint. I'm glad to have you on my side." Steve chuckled lightly. "The rest of the team may not come together so easily. Natasha doesn't seem like she trusts easily. Neither do Banner and Stark, for that matter. Don't get me wrong, it sounds like they all got plenty-a reason, but it is gonna make my life a little more challenging. I don't think I understood how much I needed this. Not the fighting, like Loki said. But the team. I got nothin' here. Now. Also, I didn't realize until I saw this place how much I hate my place."
Steve wondered how many more times he could stand to be shocked like this before he really started to crack. “Boy, it’s been a hell of a day. Helicarriers, aliens, portals to outer space, me from the future, and now this. Alright. JARVIS, do you think you could tell me where Tony is? I think I’d like to start by talking to him.” There was a long enough pause that Steve opened his mouth to rescind his request, but then JARVIS responded.
“You didn’t want to backtrack on how you motivated us to be a team. Well, guess what. You got what you wanted. We’re a team now. So here’s how it’s going to go. Pierce thinks I’m Hydra. Natasha is going to stay here for a couple of weeks before she comes back to New York. She’ll fill you in on all the details of what we know and how we learned it, and she has the means to communicate with us privately. You’re going to work with her to identify agents you’re sure of.”
“We’re telling you we can’t be sure he’s not,” answered Tony shortly. “No one really knows him. He keeps too much to himself. Case in point.” He gestured to Phil.
To anyone who has trouble keeping track, this chapter covers from a few weeks after The Avengers (May 2012) to a couple of months after Iron Man 3 (December 2012).
“Well, that’s a fair point. What about Sharon? We know she’s not Hydra.” He wrinkled his nose instinctively. “No, she’s related to Peggy. That’s a little creepy. But I know lots of women who aren’t SHIELD.”
“Yeah, no time for pleasantries. I looked into the info Cap got from Rumlow. His original SO is someone named John Garrett. Garrett has recruited a lot of agents. Some are already dead, some had pretty stable upbringings with no other red flags, and I’ve tagged several that are still active and should be considered as likely Hydra. One of those is on Coulson’s team.”
A couple of weeks after his chat with Rumlow, Steve was drawing in Tony’s lab (and if he was drawing Tony again, well no one needed to know) when he got a text from Natasha.
“It may be of interest to you to know that the individual you previously inquired about, Agent Triplett, grandson of Private Gabriel Jones, is currently serving with Agent Garrett.”
“He blew up Happy. In Malibu. Pepper just called and told me. He’s in the hospital. She’s with him now. I told them to put on
Tony cocked his head. “Come on, you’ve never kept a secret? Told half-truths to avoid giving it away? I know Captain America is all virtue, but I’m willing to bet young Steve Rogers had a few things he didn’t want anyone to know. Tap into that guy.” Clint’s eyes flicked back and forth between Tony, who looked all too knowing, and Steve, who had just the faintest blush. He hid a smirk behind his hand. “Besides, you now have access to the queen spy. I bet she’d be happy to teach you, right?” He finally broke eye-contact with Steve to look over to Natasha, but Steve was still thinking about what he’d said. Maybe he could do this.
Steve chuckled. “Might be a factor.” Steve caught himself staring at Tony and realized he was thinking about his obvious allure. He cleared his throat. “Anyway, you said you’ve been searching for him?”
“You can call me Steve,” he said easily. He told her an abbreviated version of the course of events: his future self had come back and convinced Brock Rumlow and others that he was Hydra; now they thought current Steve was also Hydra; he and the Avengers were trying to figure out who was trustworthy and who wasn’t; their need for allies. While he talked, he watched her. After he’d told her just about everything, he said, “You know, you remind me of Peggy. She watched me just the same way when I told her all of this. No reaction, just taking it all in. I admire that steadiness. I have trouble with it, on occasion. But if you’ve got questions, now’s the time to ask’em. We’ll have to figure out ways to communicate without SHIELD being aware, but I’d like to avoid as much of that as possible. When you don’t know who the enemy is, it’s tough.”
Steve laughed out loud. "Neither. I noticed when we stole that jet to go to the battle that most junior SHIELD agents pretty much do what I tell them to. I just explained that I'm more comfortable with paper copies and asked them to let me into the file room. I figured I should do at least a little prep work for our coffee today."
though he hadn’t started it yet. He knew Tony had been making fun of him in some way and figured the only way to understand what he’d meant was to read the book.
"Hey, Tony," Steve called warmly when they entered the room where he was waiting. "It's so funny that you called just now. Natasha and I were just having coffee and chatting. Before we get to any gear upgrades, I'd like you to hear what she was telling me."
"According to JARVIS, DNA matches, and he's got Agent Melinda May on his team. He said that would mean something to you, but I also remember she's one of the people you said you were sure wasn't Hydra," said Steve.
“He took her before Nat and Clint could get there. They’ve been following her trail from there, and we were working with JARVIS to trace the Mandarin. That led us here, but I’m guessing since the two of you are here and I heard armor fly overhead, that Killian isn’t here. Do you have any idea where they’re going next?”
“I’ve been listening to you talk tech for over a year and I still have no idea what that means,” Clint complained.
Steve frowned. “I don’t like the idea of lying to them. Clint might be used to the spy training methods, but Tony is sensitive to liars and Bruce is sensitive to spying.”
Bruce and Natasha both started to argue with him, but Steve’s tactical mind was turning all this over rapidly and he wasn’t really listening. “What if, instead of an obstacle, this was an opportunity?” Everyone stopped and looked at him. “We know Fury is requesting this, and whether or not he’s Hydra, this has got to be something Hydra wants. It might’ve even come down from Pierce. Let’s say you refuse.” Tony’s mouth opened to interrupt, but Steve cut him off. “At first.” Tony closed his mouth. “You refuse at first, and I convince you to build it.”
Steve realized what Tony was asking. "I had no idea. None. Even if I haven't proved that I'll tell you anything you want to know, you have to believe I wouldn't jeopardize our mission to get Hydra out of SHIELD. Coulson would be a huge asset."
As soon as Steve walked in, Clint and Natasha behind him, Tony started to talk. “Look, I know what you’re thinking, but – ”
“I’m not sure if that’s a pro or a con, honestly. I don’t really want to get set up with anyone. We’ve got a lot going on here.”
"Well the most recent person listed as recruited by Coulson is Skye – no last name, very 80s – a few months ago."
After they left Steve turned to Tony. "Alright, out with it. What didn't you want to tell me in front of the rest of the class?" Steve gave a half-smile that Tony didn't return.
“I’ve never been disappointed by the plans from up top. I’m sure there’s something that’ll pique your interest. Hey, cheers. To the future!”
When they arrived, they heard Killian yelling at a man in the War Machine armor, his whole body starting to glow. “What do you MEAN you lost him? The President dying in a very public execution is crucial to the plan.”
Trip led the way out to the back porch. “Gotta say, I’m a little nervous about what kind of shop Captain America wants to talk with me. Is this the real reason you came?”
Tony’s fidgeting increased. “Send him up, J.” While Tony fidgeted, Natasha grew more still. When the elevator finally dinged, Steve swore she wasn’t moving at all. Phil walked in slowly, but Steve wasn’t watching him; he was watching his team. Bruce was probably the calmest one – he wasn’t as close to Phil as the rest. Natasha still didn’t move, but Clint jumped up off the couch. He walked right up into Phil’s space, but couldn’t seem to speak. Steve watched as Natasha’s eyes raced all over Phil, cataloging any differences she could find. He decided to help clarify things before they got into the emotions of it all. “JARVIS, I know that you have more advanced capabilities here in the tower and can see beyond superficial differences. Is this the same Phil Coulson that has been here before?”
“Um, actually, staying here for a bit would be great,” Bruce said, clearly trying to change the topic. I’m not sure what exactly I’d like to do next. Thanks, Tony.”
Steve sighed again and decided that since he usually couldn’t walk away from a fight, it was about time he started this one. “Being a man.”
Steve sighed. “You seem to have forgotten a lotta things about me. I was also a soldier in World War II. It’s fine. Status?”
“Without having to deal with the security in this building and the possibility of other Avengers. Much easier to grab Pepper and wait for him to fly to the rescue,” Steve responded. “The question is, why do they want Tony? Just because he threatened the Mandarin?”
As they walked down to the lab, Tony squinted at Steve and gave an odd little half-smile. "So the indomitable Natasha fell in love with your best buddy. That weird for you?"
“Well I actually had an idea about that,” Tony responded. “I know I don’t generally play all that well with other people,” his eyes flickered over to Natasha almost too quickly to see, “but I think we have to commit to the team. It seems like things in the future get pretty shitty, considering my future self was willing to pull the pin on my arc reactor to get the tesseract. Maybe Cap’s right and we didn’t become a team fast enough. Bruce, I think you should skip globetrotting for a while and stay here in the tower. Come play in R & D, big guy. It’ll be the best time you ever had with your clothes on.” Bruce blushed and looked at the ceiling. “Thor, you can obviously stay here, since you don’t really have a home base on this planet. Jane, too, if you want. We’ll set her up with her own lab. Least I can do after you jolted me back to life. Then we have all our meetings here. Cap can go to Fury and tell him that I’d rather not meet at SHIELD headquarters. He’d buy that I’m petty enough not to want to go and diva enough to make Cap ask. I’ll take a little break from Malibu; Pepper can hold down the fort there – she goes back in a week or so. I can even get a gym and training center set up here. And Cap wants to have movie nights.” He turned to Steve with a smirk.
Tony, who'd been quiet up to this point, huffed indignantly. "Well, hell Romanoff. It seems we and our fancy new tech just got schooled. And we've discovered another victim of the big blue eyes. C'mon, you show me yours, I'll show you mine." Natasha relented and told Tony all she'd told Steve about Bucky, though she showed less emotion than when she’d told Steve. Tony listened quietly through it all, then turned to Steve and nodded.
“I can just. Peggy built SHIELD and the rest of you mucked it up. You let Hydra grow inside it right under your nose and you didn’t even notice. Getting rid of Hydra is my job. Now, as I was saying, we need you to help develop a list of agents you’re sure of. We’ve got a few, some of whom we’ve read in. We’ve let Coulson know, he’s been cleared to tell Agent May. Grant Ward on his crew is Hydra. We’re sure. Clint is spending some time with his plane. Sharon Carter knows. Everyone agreed we can include Bobbi Morse. I’m going to be meeting up with an agent who happens to be the grandson of Gabe Jones. Depending on what we find, he could be a useful ally. Your whole STRIKE team – you know, the one you so desperately wanted me to work with – is Hydra. So is Sitwell and John Garrett. We’ll keep you posted on the list as we come up with it. We’re also working on recruiting some help from outside SHIELD. You may be the director, but, as Tony would tell you, I’m Captain fucking America. This is how we’re going to play it. And when people get identified as Hydra, they’re out. This isn’t going to be like your goddamned operation paperclip, where you get to keep people if you think they can be useful to you. They all go. Oh, and you can tell Pierce that I somehow managed to talk Tony into working on those helicarriers you need. You should know he’s not doing it as your contractor. He’s doing it as part of our op.”
Steve thought he and Natasha were actually making headway as friends. She seemed to like teaching him to lie better than teaching him to fight. “You’re actually better than I thought you’d be,” she admitted after the lying exercises. “As long as you’re telling pieces of the truth, you’re doing well. I think if we come up with enough details for your background and cover, you can fool anyone you come up against.”
"Let me look into him, first, okay? We don't know how involved Jones was in his life. DNA doesn't necessarily determine who you are."
“I recently discovered that I like operating on this team, specifically because I can skip the protocol and clearance levels. If I’m keeping secrets from them, I’d like to have a good reason.”
Natasha smirked. “I appreciate that, but trust me, no one would take me any less seriously if you started stammering at me. Breaking men is what I’m best at. I’m going to head out. Steve, Clint, want to share a cab back to base?”
Pepper was opening her mouth to respond when a commotion approached. It was the other driver, an old man, who Clint was gamely trying to shepherd away from the car without touching him.
“You said no, right?” Bruce asked, fidgeting nervously. “I mean it would’ve been bad enough having SHIELD with that kind of tech, but now that we know they’re Hydra?”
“Aw, don’t be mad, Sourpatch. I told you after the battle that I was fine.” Clearly deciding that distraction was the best technique here, he ducked behind Steve. “Here, meet Steve Rogers. Cap, meet Rhodey. He’s been my best friend since MIT, and then he abandoned the vastly superior world of engineering to become Colonel James Rhodes.” He stopped talking abruptly when Steve saluted. After JARVIS had spilled the beans on the gay rights movement, Steve decided to prioritize finding out what other civil rights changes had happened while he’d been on ice. He was grateful for that now, or he’d have been unable to hide his surprise at a black man making the rank of colonel. He wished he’d understood his phone better last night – it would’ve made the research a lot easier. Rhodey, who had clearly been so single-minded in his frustration with Tony that he’d missed the super-solider-sized blonde, looked a little dazed. Tony smirked at the two of them.
"Lying on a marshmallow. Like I'm gonna sink right through to the ground. Yeah. How long were you in?"
After a moment, the car had finally stopped. Tony’s ears were ringing and he was a little bit dazed, but he thought that he was pretty much okay. The airbags had gone off, so it was another moment before they deflated enough for him to see out the windshield. When he could, he saw that the impact had launched the stupid backing-up-on-the-highway car back into the breakdown lane and a man with dirty blond hair waving him forward. Oh. Right. He was still in the right lane of the highway. Amazingly, the car seemed to still be running for the moment, so he eased his foot off the brake and let it stumble it’s last few feet until he was out of the way of any traffic.
was your assessment? I knew you went in undercover, but this? You blacklisted him, and then you and Fury said he can’t be an Avenger. Is he still not an Avenger? Did I get that right?”
"That's a pretty broad question, Cap. I know about the increased strength and speed, plus the accelerated healing. Did the serum give you the blue eyes capable of manipulating people, or were those available on the original model?"
“Okay, you two know SHIELD better than any of us, so I want you to make a list of the agents you trust without question. Don’t approach anyone. Tony, can you run a deeper analysis on the agents themselves? See who works with Rumlow and the STRIKE team, if there’s any sort of pattern?”
He heard the man mutter "Yeah, on my left, I got it." He chuckled at the man's frustration and, when he passed him again, let himself call out, "On your left," a third time. This time the man's frustration hit boiling point and he started to sprint instead of jogging. He was no match for Steve's speed, and fell back to his usual pace a few seconds later.
Steve stood up to approach the pictures and gulped. “All of them.” Peggy, Howard, General Phillips, the Commandos, they all stared back at him. Then his eyes came to rest on a less welcome face, then narrowed. “What the fuck is Arnim Zola doing in these pictures?”
Tony was right. Pepper was fine. He managed to take care of it, fixing things, as usual, this time with the help of Dr. Helen Cho. Dr. Cho also removed the shrapnel from Tony’s chest, allowing him to live without the arc reactor. Steve watched alongside Pepper and Rhodey as Tony headed into surgery.
Unlike Peggy, Sharon didn’t need him to pick her up. She knocked on his door promptly at 6 that evening. “You know, I don’t usually meet strange men in hotel rooms,” she said with a smile.
"So future you told you to trust me but not Fury?" This trust in her seemed to be the stickiest point to her. "Do you think he trusts me that much or Fury that little?"
"I can help you there, too. My great-niece is an agent. Sharon Carter. She's based here in DC. You'll have to look her up while you're visiting."
“If you agree to this, you quit your job, move to New York, and we stop the next explosion. I can’t say any more about it here, but I want you to think about it carefully. You got out for a reason.”
Tony. Home. He only realized he’d been staring at his phone, filled with emotion when Trip cleared his throat. “Everything okay, man?”
“I am not less confused, but whatever. No weird Back to the Future changes sounds good to me. You say don’t tell Fury, I trust you, Cap. I’m an excellent secret keeper.”
“Honestly, not that great. Neither of us are recruiters for SHIELD, and we both tend to work mostly solo,” said Clint with a huff.
Steve came abruptly to consciousness, his face pressed against the cool tile floor. He pushed himself up to his knees and looked around but saw no sign of Loki. The scepter, however, was on the floor next to him. “Damn. How long was I out?” he wondered aloud. Since he hadn’t seen anyone, he started when he received a response.
“Door open, okay?” Steve reminds, giving both teenagers a soft smile. He leaves, making sure the door is wide open.
“Honey, what’s wrong?” Tony asks, coming over toward his husband and laying a hand over his shoulder. “Morning sickness?”
The door to Tony’s side is being opened by none other than Happy. Tony breathes out a sigh of relief.
Steve bares his teeth and growls in warning when the alpha tries to touch him. The alpha surprisingly backs off and watches as Steve strips from the dirty clothing. He takes off each layer slowly, wincing from the action of moving his joints. The dirty clothes fall in a crumpled mess on the floor. The alpha kicks them away.
Tony sighs. He wants nothing more than for Steve to stop blaming himself. It wasn’t Steve’s fault that the baby had died. But Tony doesn’t tell him the truth. He never could.
“I don’t know why,” Clint grumbles and crosses his arms over his chest. Natasha sends a glare his way and he drops his arms to his side.
Steve doesn’t respond and he keeps his back to Tony. The alpha tries to coax him away from the cliff and back to the party.
“He was sick. Probably due to my past health conditions.” Steve’s aware of the tears rolling down his face and he wipes at them again. Talking about his pups hurt. It probably always would.
“What happened?” Bucky asks. He hasn’t moved from his seat since he first arrived, hadn’t spoken a word either. He stayed silent while Tony caught both him and Sam up to speed. He was broken and confused, that much Tony could tell. And he had every right to be. Steve was his best friend.
“Cool!” Peter smiles and comes over to greet the cat. She purrs when he scratches behind her ear. “Where did you find her?”
That catches Tony’s attention and he peers up at his mate. Steve can feel his gaze on him and he has to fight the urge to turn and meet it.
Tony nods. He just needs to lie down for a bit. Maybe take an aspirin or two. He’ll be fine in the morning.
Bucky nods and sniffs. He almost considers backing out and they do something else, but then he remembers his nephew and how much Peter had been looking forward to the party.
The alpha in front of him wasn’t going to hurt him. Steve knows this, and yet he’s still intimidated by his presence.
“You two can be excused,” Steve says, and once Flash has caught his breath, is led quickly out of the room and upstairs where it was safer.
For weeks Tony had been locking himself away in the tower like some kind of princess in a fairytale. Though he was far from princess material and didn’t require saving -Pepper would disagree- he couldn’t help but make the comparison. He needed some time away from the tower. He needed to breathe in the cool winter air.
Tony kisses Steve’s neck again, moving closer until his lips are near the mark embedded in Steve’s skin. The omega offers his neck, allowing Tony to kiss him on his bond mark.
“I’m sure.” Steve steps into the room and sits down on the edge of the bed. Peter notices a book in his hand and he furrows his brows in confusion. Before he can ask what it is, his papa hands it to him. “This was mine. But I figured you might find it helpful.”
A small whimper captures Steve’s attention and he glances up, his eyes landing on the young pup held in James’ arms.
Steve tucks Peter in for the fourth time, making sure he’s comfortable and has his favorite stuffed puppy. Peter smiles up at Steve and breaks free from the blankets to crawl into Steve’s lap.
Peter rushes out of the penthouse and down to the lab. Jarvis let’s him in as promised and Peter spots his dad hard at work. He stops when a familiar sound stands out amongst the noise his dad was producing. He’d know his papa’s voice anywhere.
He directs his gaze back on the ceiling, contemplating if he should try to sleep again or get up to ease his worried mind. He chooses the latter and quietly gets out of bed, careful not to disturb his mate.
That had been three years ago and Steve could proudly say that it was one of the best decisions he’s ever made. Landing the Valkyrie in the middle of the ocean seemed good at the time...he realizes now that that wasn’t his greatest moment. But getting together with Tony was hands down his best decision.
Bucky snorts and shakes his head. “Steve wasn’t a saint, Nat. I wouldn’t be surprised if his kid was getting into fights in alleys.”
Tony can only watch as their friends comfort him. The guilt washes over him again. This was all his fault.
Steve huffs out a laugh and wipes at his eyes again. “I was terrified. I wasn’t supposed to be pregnant. I don’t understand-the test was negative-I shouldn’t have-”
“I won’t hurt you,” her voice is soft and calm, nothing like the other alphas. “Clint,” she turns back to her partner. “Call it in. We found them.”
He relied on FRIDAY to keep him updated, and it wasn’t until she mentioned alerting medical personnel did Tony lose his composure. He didn’t want to believe that Steve had done anything to harm himself. That wasn’t Steve; he would never do that. At least, that’s what Tony wanted to believe. Steve was different now. He wasn’t the same.
“I wasn’t offering,” Natasha says and takes a drink. She sets the glass down and narrows her eyes. “You have a lot of nerve showing up here. Bucky could’ve done some serious damage.”
“What’s this?” Tony pulls away to fully take in his son’s appearance. His eyes roam over the suit they picked out just last week, then they’re traveling up to the styled hair and drawn on goatee. Tony smiles. “Wow. I swear it’s like looking in a mirror.”
Well now Tony knows. He's still an idiot for shutting everyone out. It's his own fault. Hopefully I can answer any questions you guys have in upcoming chapters.
He finds a bathroom first to relieve himself and fix his bed head, then he continues with his exploring. He’s seen the living room plenty enough and leaves it out of his tour. The kitchen is one of the largest he has ever seen. He doesn’t stay too long and keeps moving, his excitement only growing with every step.
The city is awake and bustling like it is every morning. The roads and sidewalks are jammed packed with its morning commuters. It definitely lived up to its name. It never sleeps.
With one agent down, Steve focuses on the other. Rollins takes a little more effort, but soon he’s taking a hard punch to the face and hitting the floor with a thud.
He allows his eyes to fall shut and listens to the soft breathing of his husband. He keeps his hand on Tony’s belly, dreaming of a little version of him.
Steve nods and lays Sarah down in the middle of the large bed, sitting down beside her to tuck her in and brush her blond hair behind her ear. The moment her head hits the pillow, she’s yawning and blue eyes are fluttering shut.
“Whoa, whoa. Who said anything about being romantically involved? We’re not even mates!” Tony hisses, eyes darting quickly in the direction of the closed door.
When Pepper finds him, he’s already drunk half the bottle and he’s surrounded by broken glass and unopened letters. The lab is quiet except for the sound of his cries.
He still thinks about the other alpha and the threat that’s still out there. He’d probably always be thinking about Hydra. The fear of being found and captured would never truly vanish. Hydra would stop at nothing to have him and his pup. But Tony promised safety, and it was a promise that Steve held on to.
Tony shakes his head, unable to believe her words. Why the hell would Peter want him? He was a screw up. He couldn’t do anything right, and when life got too rough, Tony hid and drank until he could forget. He wasn’t a good father. Peter deserved better.
Bucky releases another sob and turns around so that he can hug Sam back. “I don’t know if I can do this.”
Happy huffs and starts to drive again. They share a look through the mirror, a silent question being asked between them: was this a good idea?
“You’re hard to forget.” Tony regrets those words the second they leave his mouth. He clears his throat and shifts awkwardly. “Um...do you need...I can get you…”
“Good. Because between him and Barton…” Tony trails off, picturing the damage the tower will be in when those two team up. Maybe he shouldn’t have let Steve keep the dog.
“Everyone is already here,” Peter explains as they ascend to their destination. “Just be...um...careful with Uncle Bucky.”
Natasha luckily takes control of the situation and has everyone smiling again. “He’s the cutest Avenger I’ve ever seen.”
“I’m afraid that’s out of the question. I can’t have my prized omega distracted with a little one. You have other duties.”
“I don’t know! It’s what you usually do!” Pepper sighs. “I’m just saying. Maybe you need to take a break from these things.”
It was a struggle to get them calm enough to get into the vehicle, but they managed. They were comfortable around their mother and warming up to Tony. It was still a work in progress.
“You know-” Pepper begins and Tony just knows what she’s going to say next. “-married life would suit you.”
I think Tony is just stressed. That's no excuse for the things he said of course, but it's taking a toll on him too. I just feel for this little family. It will get better...eventually.
They stay a little longer than they should when saying goodbye to their son. Steve can’t hold back the tears that gather in his eyes when he sees Peter. He’s lucky enough to hold him, and he cherishes the last few minutes he has with him.
Sam’s smile widens and he cups Bucky’s face, using his thumbs to brush away the tears that have now left wet tracks down Bucky’s cheeks.
He’s relieved when no one follows him and he’s alone. He paces outside of the room, one of his fingers finding their way into his mouth and he chews away at the nail. His son’s crying is easily picked up from his enhanced hearing and it brings another wave of tears. Steve squeezes his eyes shut and backs into the wall, digging the heels of his hands into his eyes.
Steve stirs and Tony snaps his head up, eyes trained on Steve’s face, searching for any indication that he was truly waking up or if tt was just a fragment of his imagination. Then Steve is squeezing his hand.
“Dammit, Steve,” Tony curses and rests his head against the door with a thump. Morgan’s cries reach his ears and he’s forced to forget about Steve and focus on his daughter.
The first night with Peter is unlike anything Steve has ever experienced. He had gotten used to his stay at the hospital and the nurses caring for his son. It’s a huge adjustment being woken up every couple of hours, but he knew this and he was glad he had Tony to help him.
They're such a cute family. I had fun and will probably write more superfamily stuff. Who am I kidding? Of course I will! Thank you guys again!!!!
He rubs tenderly at the spot where the new life is growing. “I’ll protect you,” he whispers. It’s a promise he’s made to all of them, but this time he will do everything in his power not to break another.
Peter wraps his arms around his uncle and hugs him tight. “Come back okay? Please come back. He...he didn’t.”
“Hey,” Steve greets with a warm smile when he notices Tony entering the kitchen. “I made coffee and bacon. Just waiting on the pancakes.”
Steve kicks the alpha a few more times until he falls still. With both threats down, Steve is able to catch his breath and compose himself. He spins when someone approaches him, ready to issue another attack, only to realize it’s his mate and he freezes.
This time Tony glances up, meeting the eyes of Alexander Pierce. “Wish I could say the same,” Tony replies.
It was probably for the best. Steve and Barnes were a match made in Heaven. Of course Steve would choose his best friend instead of the asshole that fucked him and blew him off right afterwards. Steve didn’t deserve someone like that. He deserved so much more.
James is still showing apprehension, but seeing his younger brother wrapped around the omega eases him. He sniffs the air and leans forward to get a better whiff of Steve. The scent must be calming or familiar because he calms down and his scent becomes less sour. Steve hopes he recognizes his scent.
He’s forced down the stairs and into the living room where another familiar alpha greets them. At first Steve appears hopeful that it’s only Rumlow and Rollins, but then a few more members of their team emerge from the shadows, all of them with guns raised.
“You could never do that. Maybe one more night? I’ve just got a lot on my mind and you being here helps.”
He cradles Morgan in his arms and carefully lowers himself in the rocking chair. He doesn’t struggle anymore when it comes to feeding her and he’s able to get her calm and latching on in a matter of minutes.
Tony brings Steve close and connects their lips again. Steve moans softly into the kiss and teasingly swipes his tongue along Tony’s bottom lip, begging for access, and Tony grants it, parting his lips and allowing Steve to slip his tongue inside his hot mouth.
When Peter pushes the door to his bedroom open, he lets out a sad sigh and runs his fingers through his messy hair. He blows out a breath and steps further into the room, the space now unfamiliar and foreign to him.
Steve stares at the alpha. He has questions, but his inability to speak has been lost. Tony can read his mind and he comes closer until he’s standing beside the omega. He lays a hand over Steve’s shoulder and rubs the spot gently.
“Oh my God.” Tony breathes out. His gaze snaps up to Steve’s face at the scream he produces. Tony can’t help but wince at the sound. “I know. Just push. I can see the head.”
“It was a mission. I don’t know all the details. I guess there was some base in Russia or something with stolen weapons. I don’t even know what kind, but I guess it was serious. Papa’s job was to go in and retrieve them and shut down the operation. And he almost did. I sort of snuck in because I wanted to help.”
Peter smiles and wraps his arms around his brother, giggling happily now that they’ve made up. Steve smiles at the scene.
The scream Steve emits is startling, forcing Tony to push aside his panicking to assist with the birth. That thought alone is enough to get Tony’s anxiety rising again, but he doesn’t allow it to take over him completely. Steve needed him.
Steve wants nothing more than to go back to simpler times. He’d give anything to live through those moments again.
Peter doesn’t respond and glances back down at his untouched food. He pokes around at the egg, his stomach growing queasy at the thought of having to eat it. He pushes the plate away and takes the toast to nibble on instead.
Tony eyes him closely while he sips from his wine glass. Peter catches his gaze and then quickly glances back down at his plate.
A single tear rolls down his face and Steve curses himself for getting worked up. This was not the time or place for his hormones and issues to make an appearance.
This chapter focuses more on Tony and his grief, but I swear after this it will be focusing more on him and his relationship with Peter. They have a lot of work.
He huffs and leans back into his chair. He thinks back to that night and the fuzzy memory he had of the event. All he remembers was the brief mingling with the other guests and portions of the conversation with Pierce. He doesn’t remember chasing after any omega, but he remembers blue eyes.
“Don’t,” Tony points a threatening finger in his husband’s direction. “I know that look. You’re getting excited and I can assure you it’s for nothing.”
“N-nothing,” Tony stammers and he clears his throat. “I guess I forgot. Tell him I need to reschedule-”
Steve ignores him, walking out of the living room and toward their bedroom. Tony lets out a heavy sigh and rises to his feet, shushing Morgan quietly when she starts to fuss. He doesn’t chase after Steve right away, deciding to put Morgan down in her crib first.
The voice gets louder and louder, repeating those two words until it’s all Steve can hear. Morgan is still looking up at him, but it’s not enough. He needs Tony.
Peter stays for a few more minutes, telling his papa about the other struggles he was currently going through. It wasn’t just the relationship with his father that Peter was concerned about. He was worried for the rest of his family. He’d give anything to be fighting alongside them right now.
“Really? What about the others?” Peter’s eyes flicker in the direction of the many suits lining the walls. “What about those?”
“Is that a good idea, sir?” Jarvis finally decides to respond. Tony scowls and picks his tablet up again, hoping to use it as a distraction to keep himself calm.
Peter shakes his head. “I want the other suit you wear. Please, Daddy? I think you are the coolest guy in the whole wide world!” Peter exclaims, widening his arms to show Tony just how cool he thinks he really is.
“You can. Steve wouldn’t want you hurting like this, especially not on his birthday. He’s still here with us, Bucky. I bet he’s watching over you right now and wondering why you decided to get a cat.”
“No,” Natasha shakes her head. “I don’t want you to. I’m sure Bruce will agree with me. And of course there’s Peter. He finally has you in his life. Don’t let him down like you did Steve.”
Steve had been over the moon when he got his best friend back. Tony got that. He had a best friend too, and he’d do anything for Rhodey if the roles had been reversed.
Steve’s eyes flicker up to Tony’s face, smiling softly at him. He doesn’t want to wake him just yet, knowing that Tony was losing out on sleep too. It was difficult for him to find a comfortable sleeping position these days.
He shoots first and the alpha closest to him goes down. The other two have their fingers on the trigger of their respective weapons, but Tony is faster and he fires first, sending them both to the floor with painful groans.
Steve had complained about Dodger’s smothering in the past, but as of late he’s kept quiet and never voiced his complaints. That didn’t stop Tony from trying to get Dodger to hang out with him every now and then, but Dodger was stubborn and Steve was forced to accept that the remainder of his pregnancy was going to be spent with their furry friend.
The thick woods surrounding the compound comes into view. It was the only way out. Steve runs faster, putting as much distance as he can between himself and the Hydra agents behind him.
“You could,” Natasha assures. She glances down at Peter when he finally burps for her. More than just air escapes and Steve rushes to grab another cloth, grimacing as he cleans up the spit up milk.
They continue to drive until the city disappears behind them. It only fuels Steve’s curiosity. They never ventured outside of the city; it was their home.
Steve forces himself to ignore the extra attention, instead focusing on the pregnancy and making sure his son was healthy.
“You told me that you needed him, that you needed me. But the truth is I’m the one who needs you. You came into my life unexpectedly, throwing one of the biggest curveballs at me, but I don’t regret even a second of it. I need you, Pete. You make me want to do better, to be better. I don’t know what I’d do without you. And if you still want space, then I’ll give it, no questions asked. I just wanted to stop by and give you your birthday present.”
“He just…” Tony sighs again, one hand coming up to run through his hair. “I don’t know. So far he’s been himself, and to tell you the truth, I never thought I’d see him like this again. I don’t want to mess it up.”
Then Tony groans again and the sound goes straight to his cock. Steve shifts, wishing he wouldn’t get hard right now. They haven’t had sex lately, mostly due to Tony complaining about being tired or because he just wasn’t in the mood. That had also been weeks ago and now...now Steve was wondering if Tony would be in the mood.
“I guess it’s done a lot of altercations, huh? But I bet getting drunk isn’t one of the worst things,” Tony says and digs into his own food.
We finally get to know some stuff about Steve! He's not Captain America, but I made the story a little similar. I just changed and added things to make it make sense for my universe. Anyway, hope you all enjoy!
Steve smiles and lays his hand over his growing middle. His son moves for a moment before settling down into a new position.
He still didn’t know if he wanted to keep the baby or not. Right now he was leaning toward adoption and giving the baby to a good, loving home. He could never provide for the baby, not when he was a kid himself.
It’s not long until Steve has all the ingredients needed for the pancakes laid out on the kitchen counter. Peter is right beside him, standing on his Mickey Mouse step stool and waiting for permission to put the chocolate chips into the batter Steve has just finished making.
“I have an idea for something. Don’t worry about it okay? I need time to bring it to life,” Tony says.
“If you want my opinion-” Bucky says and Peter has to fight the urge to roll his eyes. “-then I wouldn’t even bother with him. He’s just a waste of time.”
“Really?” Steve frowns and rolls his eyes when Tony shrugs his shoulders. “This is ridiculous. All I wanted was for us to name him and you’re hating all of my suggestions. I don’t see you helping.”
“Take it.” Peter steps forward and offers the shield. “You deserve it. If anyone should be the next Captain America then it’s you.”
“And I will. In time. You’ve said enough and it’s been hard on you. Just take things slow okay? I just want you and that baby comfortable. That’s all that matters.”
I’m so glad you all are loving this story! I know Tony’s a huge pain in the ass but this chapter isn’t about him this time haha. Steve gets to be with his son and move on from Tony. Tony’s missing out 🤦♀️
Steve had made a vow to never try for a baby again. He told himself he didn’t need one to be happy. He didn’t need that simple life he used to envision.
“But…” Tony trails off, slightly hesitant to finish his thought. Steve is staring at him intently, his soft gaze urging him to continue. “You two can sleep here tonight. I bought a couple of things for him.”
But Steve is impatient and he crawls back into bed, mentally scolding himself for reeking from his workout and ruining the expensive sheets. He ignores it for now and crawls carefully toward Tony until he’s hovering over him. He ducks down and kisses Tony softly on the lips, each cheek, his nose and then lightly peppers kisses along his jaw, the stubble of Tony’s goatee scratching Steve’s skin in the best way.
Peter nods and holds onto his dad a little tighter, afraid that if he were to loosen his grip even just the slightest that his dad would leave him again.
“I need to know something,” Tony says and Steve peers up at him. He knows he needs to be careful when choosing his words. He doesn’t want to upset Steve in any way. “Are you-are you...pregnant?”
Only one alpha was around….or at least he usually was. Steve sits up again, eyes immediately drawn to the closed door. He shouldn’t expect Tony to come running every time he had a nightmare, but he’d be lying if he said he didn’t wish the alpha would. It wasn’t just his scent and warmth that comforted Steve...it was all of him.
Here’s when it gets worse so warning! If any of this is too much then please don’t read. I totally understand.
The alpha yanks Steve to his feet, ignoring the painful whimpers the omega emits. Steve looks around the room, his heart sinking when he realizes Tony wasn’t back yet. He can only pray that Tony was okay.
The room Steve’s been offered lacks the familiar scent of the alpha. Tony had been willing to give Steve the master bedroom again, but Steve declined. This was Tony’s home and he deserved to sleep in his own bed before anyone else. Alphas came first.
James mostly acts up when he’s not in the penthouse. He’s still timid of Bruce. Or at least that’s what everyone initially thought. Turns out he’s afraid of doctors and doesn’t enjoy being poked or prodded. Steve sympathizes with him there.
Bucky side eyes his nephew and then settles his fiery gaze back on Tony. He exhales sharply and the fist he has wrapped around Tony’s shirt loosens. Tony’s chest is rising and falling rapidly; his heart is close to bursting from how hard it’s pounding.
Tony can already picture everyone struggling to have a good time. He knows for a fact that he won’t be able to find any joy. The last party he went to was the one he’s come to regret. This was going to be another.
“Right on time for what?” Steve questions, a look of confusion forming over his face. It’s gone in an instant at the sight of his son. “Hey, Petey.” He smiles brightly for a moment, then his face shifts again, this time a look of concern crossing his features. “Is everything okay?”
Peter sniffs and shakes his head. She immediately pulls him into her arms, hugging him tightly and letting him sob into her chest. Her own eyes fill with tears.
Tony takes a moment to think it over. He’s actually been thinking about trying again. Maybe having a baby wouldn’t be the end of the world like he thought. Maybe he wouldn’t be like Howard and instead be a wonderful father like Steve would say.
to be gay?” There it is again; Rogers spitting out Cap like its always left a bad taste in his mouth.
“I—right,” Steve says blankly, “She’s a presenter. That’s how she got backstage. How did you get backstage, here?”
He grins as Tony continues on and says, "It’s at the Tower, by the way. Found the damn thing, but I’m only giving it back if you come and get it.”
Awards come and go. And finally, after what seems like an eternity, the presenters begin to announce the nominees for his category. Steve just wants to see his name pop on the screen, and then he’ll be satisfied—just to feel the honor of being
When Tony’s name is called for the Best Film Supporting Actor, Steve reacts faster than Tony does, by springing to his feet and all but pulling Tony up to stand. Tony blinks away his surprise fairly quickly, and hugs Steve tightly. Steve can feel the presence of Tony’s grin, and he laughs proudly.
“Oh my god,” Tony whispers as he lets go of Steve to actually wall up on the stage and accept the award. “I don’t have a speech prepared.”
“Uh huh,” Rogers says with such amused disbelief that it's hard to even picture what the expression on his face is. “And my
"Dance is a great workout," Steve recites, and from where Tony doesn't know. "So yes, I'm trying to catch up. Ballet is something, though. Real hard stuff, and I don't have the exact body type for it. Tap is fine, tap is good. Jazz is fun, unless I mess up. That happens a lot." He makes a face at himself.
"What is your problem today? Fury needs you, and we're in what may as well be a bar back alley yelling about your goddamned sexuality that I couldn't care less about right now. You're saying you're off-duty, and he's saying you aren't, so we're going to get this straightened out and then, do whatever. I don't fucking care, Rogers, newsflash!"
Since he took deliberately smaller steps than Tony, Tony easily caught up to him. He pushed Steve up against the wall that Steve had nearly backed himself into, and Steve’s back hit it with a loud noise that nearly made Tony’s hands drop from Steve’s body in apology and surprise. This was nothing new for Steve (minus the Tony part of the equation) so he didn’t pay attention to the slight pain flaring from his back.
“You mean Steve’s ability to rock the bloody murderer look? I think we covered that?” Tony jokes, because it’s true. They’ve spent the last hour talking about everything from their wide repertoire of roles and how Liam and Dominic were so far out of them, they’ve talked about their fellow castmates and how amazing it was to work with each and everyone one of them, they’ve talked about set and shooting, they’ve also talked about how chilling the movie itself was. But there’s one glaring thing about the movie that they haven’t talked about.
.” Steve had said before he had dashed into the bathroom in their bedroom. So by the time Tony had done the same, Steve was already in the kitchen cooking breakfast, because apparently it was four thirty in the morning and no one else was up.
And that is how the rest of the Avengers (and Laura) find them, kissing like their lives depended on it in the kitchen an hour later, after they’ve both eaten breakfast in the few minutes they weren’t kissing. Steve has his hands under Tony’s shirt and Tony has a hand down Steve’s pants as they’re tightly pressed together against the kitchen countertop, with Steve being the one who’s pinned. He seriously wants to know just how Steve can kiss like this, and what other party tricks he has.
Sooner or later, Clint and Natasha drift up to him and he's too used to it to even jump up in surprise.
"Yeah, and male?" Tony bluffs again, because Natasha had said that no one else knew and not to give it away. So he can't say anything.
For someone whose birthday is in a few days, Tony notices that Steve doesn’t seem happy at all. He looks incredibly pained and miserable, and Tony wonders what that’s all about. When he asks Sam, he just shakes his head and says that Steve has been like this ever since they raided the last warehouse. Sam asks him to try and get it out of Steve before he wallows in misery.
”And besides, I told you that you were good enough to have someone. You deserve it, Tony, don’t you dare turn this negative onto yourself,” Pepper warns, a fond tone in her voice.
Tony huffs a laugh. “Trust me, I remember that one,” he smirks. “I found the meme of you versus your character, remember?”
His is last, and as the narrator says, “Steve Rogers, for Centre of the World.” The scene behind is the one where Steve rises from the ground with a truly frightening expression after carving up a recent victim. People ask him often where he had pulled the expression from, and where he drew his inspiration from, but Steve has absolutely no clue. He didn’t really know that his face could do that.
"The Steve Rogers phenomenon?" Pepper repeats questioningly from the other end of the video call. Right, the video call with Pepper about how the Avengers thing was going, and how R&D was going.
“You belong here just as much as everyone else,” Tony says. “Come on, Steve, you know you do. Just... if you don’t want the Oscar, sell it. eBay, one cent. Go for it. You don’t have to keep it. Anything that makes you feel better. Steve, come on. Steve.”
The man points to the blond coming out of the bathroom and comments, “You know, everyone knows who Steve is.”
Tony stares at him with an unidentifiable look in his eyes, silent for the longest minute of Steve’s life. “No,” he says slowly, shaking his head. “I’m not. It won’t do anything but make you feel worse. I’m not doing that to you. Especially when you’re the only one that thinks that.” There’s a slight strain to his words.
Steve's eyes flicker on him with amusement. "Well, a) it's fun, b) I'm fantastic at it, and c) I don't think I would be able to pry you out of your lab every 24 hours, JARVIS and Pepper or not." Suddenly the song changes and he realizes that although the music doesn't call for any 'scandalous' dances, they call for some that involve bodies pressed very close to each other. And Steve doesn't look like he's letting go anytime soon.

Not literally, because on the outside he's talking and laughing with a popular Instagram influencer. On the inside, though, he wonders how he's going to look Steve in the eye without wanting to bang him right there and not picture this. He thinks he was better off when he hated Steve. Except maybe then he would have wanted hate-sex, and that was probably worse.
“Hey Rogers, you sure you aren’t a lost puppy?” he asks, too loudly. Steve has a feeling that Tony wants to get a phrase trending on Twitter about him being a lost puppy or something related to dogs at the red carpet. “We’re at the Centre premiere, just in case you haven’t realized.”
Tony really cannot believe he's being the reasonable one. Nevertheless, Rogers loses some of his tension, and he silently dashes upstairs, leaving Tony downstairs and wondering what the hell kind of day today is. When he finally goes upstairs, Rogers is nowhere to be found and the bartender just gestures out with a glare. Great; he's managed to piss this guy off too, and he made good drinks.
The man points to the blond coming out of the bathroom and comments, “You know, everyone knows who Steve is.”
Something on his face must show it, again, because Tony’s eyes immediately flicker back to Steve with a reassuring smile and says something about pictures and autographs. This, Steve can do on reflex, and Tony knows it. So Steve and Tony laugh and take massive selfies, pulling faces and keeping wide smiles alternatively. Tony does a couple individual pictures and themed ones; Steve takes the pictures and secretly basks in the surprise that come from the fans who realize that he can actually take a decent picture no matter the quality of the phone.
, but, well, there's only three people on there he wishes could still be on there (and for that matter, also alive). That list, he thinks, may soon be expanded to hold a fifth person. Even if said fifth person doesn't even realize that they're on it. Mainly because they aren't here, at the tower, more often than not.
“Yeah, yeah,” Tony waves off nonchalantly, “I just had an idea for... it’s not important, don’t worry.”
Tony looks around as discretely as he can and finds that no one meets the criteria that he already knows of. "Are you sure that you're not lying to me? Because there's no one here that I can see."
Steve lashes for a second and then deems the number of people watching perfect to start going through what he wants.
Natasha and Clint have a priority as SHIELD agents, and this Tony knows. He has a priority to Stark Industries. Bruce has one to his science. Thor has one to Asgard. They all have day jobs. So what does Steve have? Captain America isn't a day job.
“I’m doing the next one,” Tony states, and he pulls out one. “Whoa, all caps. Never have I ever screamed ‘daddy’ accidentally so loud than when I saw Steve Rogers with his fine ass beard and his body on that massive screen.”
Clint groans and signs something, before holding his hand out for the aids. As soon as he gets them, he bolts, with Natasha on his trail, determined to finish yelling at him. Bruce goes back into his room and suddenly, it’s the two of them alone again.
Rogers cuts in sharply. “Don't tell me that I'm half gay, or whatever you're about to say, and don't tell me that I can just date women and get away with liking men as well sometimes. I'm fucking gay and I can't fucking choose to just like girls; I've been trying for the past twenty damned-something years! And if you really don't know why I can't just be out with it, I really don't know what's to tell you, Stark. Thought you were supposed to be smart."
Steve shakes his head, though this is the first he has heard of this strange theory. “God, shooting it
Still no Rogers, and Tony’s disappointed his system has lied to him. He eyes the newly freed, bloodless stool right near the handsome bartender and decides he can use a drink. Tony orders and watches the bartender do a double take, rolling his eyes.
“This award is for every girl and woman who aspires to become a director. We need you to shape the stories from different perspectives, and we need you to represent, because you can do this. You can be right up here, same as I, as long as you believe in yourself. I believe in you; do yourself a favor and believe in yourself. Believe you can stand on this stage and inspire the next generation or female directors. All of you.” She smiles and gracefully walks off stage, escorted by one of the presenters. It takes a few minutes for her to reach the table, but when she does, she breathes a sigh of relief. Steve gives her two small thumbs up when she shoots him a look clearly meant to ask how her speech was. Peggy smiles again.
Steve blinks at that. “Wait a second,” he says in realization. “Is this all because Natasha made me take a photo with that Dorito? It’s my shoulder-waist ratio, the Dorito, right?”
considering we’ve known each other for nearly a decade. I don’t think either of us had to fake that, you know? It was kind of nice, if I’m going to be fully honest, because I would rather have done those scenes with someone I knew and could trust rather than someone I didn’t.”
And Tony leaves, silently promising to come back later at a better time for everyone, including himself, with the shield.
“Oh, thank god we got that right in one try,” Steve sighs after a second, looking relieved as hell. He’s sure that this will also make it into the one video, but it’s not like it’ll hurt him. After all, it’s just a brag that they got it right in one take, unlike Bucky and Sam, who had to try over and over again because of how uncooperative one was with the other. “Great!”
,” Steve’s face crumples at his name, “I'm so sorry but the Winter Soldier killed your parents and Jarvis.”
Steve huffs another laugh, another expelling of air that makes him feel like he’s breathing for the first time, suctioning air in and out of his lungs. It’s shaky, and unsure of everything.
He says it all in a thick Brooklyn (was part of it Irish?) accent that Tony never knew Rogers had. Actually, Rogers being this carefree and light, without the stick up his ass and without that permanent scowl was something Tony hasn't even imagined. He thinks he would more sooner believe this was a cheerier, possibly gayer, more carefree and casual clone of Rogers than Rogers himself. Seriously, the sexuality (because why else would Rogers be here at a gay bar like a regular and look so comfortable?) reveal was shocking enough that Tony wondered if he was overthinking it. Maybe Rogers was here as a friend or something... but Tony hadn't even known that Rogers was aware of the mostly accepted LGBTQIA+ community, let alone be someone from the 1940's who accepted it this well. He can't handle this information right now, and—
“I’m talking about the third of the movie that involved the two of you,” she says. The audience cheers loudly with approval and excitement. When they’ve quietened, she adds, “The movie wasn’t marketed as a love story.”
Steve rubs his face with a groan, looking apologetic and sheepish as he gets up. God, is this the same guy who served in a goddamn World War?
Clint smirks. Natasha is less than impressed. "Right," she says, voice void of any inflection. "And you're dumber than Hammer."
, aren’t we? Did Patty Jenkins not direct the third-highest grossing movie of the world in her year two and a half years ago? Did Ava DuVernay not direct a critic-lauded masterpiece? Did Kathryn Bigelow not direct one, but two award-winning movies in the span of five years that earned her accolades and acclaims from everywhere
Rogers makes his way over with a smirk, not noticing Tony yet. He laughs casually as he gives the bartender a good natured grin. “Rafi,” he admonishes with a roll of his eyes as he slides sideways in the space between two bar patrons. He leans against the counter with his back to Tony, arm on the table and propping up the left side of his face, still oblivious, and jokingly chides, “Y'know, one of these days you should stop tellin' people to come an' find me. I might start carin' an' chargin' ya for somethin' or another.”
"Who are you showing off to?" Tony asks slyly, starting his eyes around to try and see if Steve will blush at the insinuation. "Is there someone you're trying to impress?"
Tony eyes him speculatively, dropping the tweet and using his fingers to frame the so-called Dorito shape on Steve. “I’m not sure that they’re talking about your triangle torso,” he finally says. In Steve’s silence—which occurs because how does one even respond to that—Tony takes advantage again and steals another tweet.
Clint smirks. Natasha is less than impressed. "Right," she says, voice void of any inflection. "And you're dumber than the Hammer."
“I don’t know what to feel that you’ve read me this easy, glad or worried since I’m so open, apparently,” Tony tries for levity.
Tony just stares at Steve in the kitchen, waiting for him to leave. So he watches Steve brew his tea with all the movements of a guy who has just come out of a nightmare. It must have been a devasting one, for Steve to look so far gone and retreated into himself that he’s a ghost working off of muscle memory. Shoulders hunched, eyes glazed, face dark, chest rising unevenly, and shaking arms, he doesn’t look at all like the Steve he’s come to be.
”And I’m offering,” Tony says. “This is not an ultimatum for you to choose him or me. I don’t think either of us would like what that answer would have been, no matter which side you would have picked. I’ve had time to think this over, and I think I’d like to meet the guy who my dad either called a bastard or a good fucking man.”
decisions and experiences. This thing that Tony has, with the worrying about Steve and the wanting to do everything for him and the fishing his shield out of the bottom of the Potomac is like
Steve huffs a laugh, and then winces, and Tony instantly realizes that the painkillers are not high enough to do a single damn thing to Steve. He walks over and glares at Steve while pressing the button a few times. Before Steve can say something else, Tony glares again, and then leans against the door like he did last time.
"Anyone with eyes wants to fuck him in that suit," Clint bluntly says. "But you want to get him every other time too."
"What is your problem today? Fury needs you, and we're in what may as well be a bar back alley yelling about your goddamned sexuality that I couldn't care less about right now. Youre acting like it’s the center of my world or something. Whatever. You're saying you're off-duty, and he's saying you aren't, so we're going to get this straightened out and then, do whatever. I don't fucking care, Rogers, newsflash!"
“Looking around,” Tony shrugs, “Wanting a drink, maintaining a low profile, searching for you, finding you, oh you know, basic things.” He tries to steel himself at whatever is about to come next, but he has to face it. When it comes to Rogers, Tony is never prepared, and he's never fully giving as best as he could. He barely manages to give as good as he gets by means of insults and backhanded jabs.
“Like I said, congratulations. Stupid me of being careless, but I really had thought that you had better things to do than track my life. Was this what you wanted, Stark? My dark scandal?”
"This hasn't happened to you before. It dropped three times in such a short period of time," Pepper remarks with a smile. She was of firm belief that Tony's timer would zero out one of these days, and that his timer would firmly work. He supposed that it was nice to have someone else believe in you for you.
"Well, we are headed towards your bedroom," Steve says as the elevator doors open and he steps in. "For something that's probably better for you than sex."
to them somehow that they mean the world to you. Don’t wait until it’s too late. Trust me. Let them know so you’ll never have it as a question in their mind.”
He can't also believe that there's a chance that his tracker and app system is wrong, though. It's impossible to think. He just thinks that Rogers being actually at End Line is harder to believe. So he drives, and he's grateful he never brings anything but the cheapest-looking cars to SHIELD on days where he has new missions with the team. The rich and the vanilla get eaten for breakfast at a place like End Line, so virginal Steve Rogers doesn't even has a chance.
It takes a few minutes, but Tony makes it back to the table with a proud smile on his face. He grins and waves it excitedly.
can pull that off like a champ, and in all the worst ways possible. As a result, it’s often best to pull him out slowly, and not like what Natasha did.
“A virgin!” Tony crows gleefully, pulling the sticker off dramatically. He bites his lip and uses the card to cover his face as he starts laughing again at the expression on Steve’s face.
? I don’t think it’s seven. You’re... April, and I’m—” he coughs the month loudly, “—which means that closer to a few and a half years closer.
"You should dance with me," Steve suggests, a smirk on his face and a very flirtatious look in his eyes that's all but challenging Tony. "As a thank-you, you know. Heard it's the polite thing to do."
“Steve, I—” Tony wants to backtrack fast enough to be just like the enhanced that beat them earlier. This is him being a peak asshole, and he was wrong before about Steve not being able to hate him any more, because this is that. This is bad memories, and worst nightmares and two am conversations when both of them are down. He doesn’t want to know, not at all, and he wishes he wasn’t such a bastard.
Steve's eyes flicker on him with amusement. "Well, a) it's fun, b) I'm fantastic at it, and c) I don't think I would be able to pry you out of your lab every 24 hours, JARVIS and Pepper or not." Suddenly the song changes and he realizes that although the music doesn't call for any 'scandalous' dances, they call for some that involve bodies pressed very close to each other. And Steve doesn't look like he's letting go anytime soon.
Tony smiles and says goodbye to the latest couple and then goes to find Steve, who he thinks might make this night less painful.
,” Steve said, semi-faking a wave of pleasure while trying to stop his own anything. “Yes. Yes, yes, I
"I think Thor would have liked him better," Steve says, wrinkling his nose at the memory. "More of a feast and fuck type. I thought it was a causal hookup, and then he brought me to a local restaurant from his apartment, so I was wondering if he wanted to date, but then we went back to his apartment and then I realized it wasn't so... that's five questions by the way."
Natasha walks in, ghosts of her own, and takes a look at the remaining tea left in the pot. She pours it all for herself. It’s apparent that Steve hasn’t noticed her yet, for all of his supersoldier hearing. She seems to come to the same conclusion Tony did and talks to him.
"It's this..." Tony starts to explain, launching into a derailed explanation on how he's impacted everyone, including Hill and Fury.
“Hey everyone, I’m Steve Rogers and the idiot next to me is,” Steve says, waiting for Tony to finish the rest of the sentence like they had rehearsed.
As he says that, Steve pulls Tony into an elaborate Left Whisk that most people can't even recognize is a waltz step, unless they see it in the context of a waltz. He has to hand it to Steve for making a point boldly.
,” Steve says lightly, like he can’t breathe. There's a smile growing on Steve's face, reverent in a way that's never associated with Tony.
"No, he stands out plenty," Steve grins. "I don't think a lot of people have been able to take their eyes off of him."
He silently fistpumps to himself, finding something. “Question from itsstarsandstripes, asking where did you, or me, I guess, go for three months, five question marks. I went home, like, Brooklyn home, and I want to say that I’ve been a homebody, but that’s not true. I’ve been working on a new project that’s not seeing the light of day for a few months if we’re lucky, a year or never if not. I shouldn’t be talking about it though, oops. I’d be fired or something if I even breathed a word about what it was. So, shh. Um, and, I’ve caught up on so many books and movies and shows. And—”
He realizes he hasn't exactly left Natasha at the bar yet, so she follows his gaze to Steve and rolls her eyes. "And to think everyone says he's awful at flirting." She sounds a little pissed off, and he immediately can tell that Steve's thwarted all of her matchmaking plans for him just by virtue of being his unique self. He grins and wonders if she knows she's probably been looking at the wrong gender.
Steve snorts, though he deflates, almost like he’s remembering that he thinks he isn’t angry at Tony. “You are not easy, Tony Stark.” Steve blinks, too, like he’s finally realized where they are, where Tony is leaning against the wall for having taken too many steps backwards, and where he is, away from the bed he was sitting on.
Tony smiles and says goodbye to the latest couple and then goes to find Steve, who he thinks might make this night less painful.
”We’re coming to the Tower in a few days. Don’t do anything stupid, don’t die, or I will personally find a way to deliver an Iron Man suit to Hammer. Steve wishes you a Happy New Year, by the way, and he apologizes for the bad start.” She hung up right as he heard the sound of bullets. He pointedly did not think about what they were doing and why Steve had called at such an awkward time if he thought Tony was dead, though it was hard to keep himself from laughing bitterly at how Steve had apologized like it was his fault any of this happened.
"I am so sorry I wasn't there," Steve cut him off, full of remorse and apology. "I should have been, for you, I should have been there to help somehow and oh god, please don't ever do something like this ever again without calling for help. I thought you were—the news said you were—no one knew what had—god, I’m just so glad you’re not dead. And I, uh, if you need something, or someone, I'll be there, okay? Just call? I'll be there, and—hey, Natasha!"
dirty little secret.” His voice is mocking and harsh, especially when it comes to his superhero alter-ego.
Tony can hear Rogers scoff before he turns around and comes face to face with Tony. The casual, friendly asshole vibe from Rogers completely dissolves into one of a practiced neutrality. He stiffens and tenses so much that Tony realizes how relaxed he was just seconds prior. Because this abrupt transformation, this posture that Rogers is sporting? It isn't anything new to Tony. This is what Tony sees when he looks at Rogers everytime. This is, apparently, a complete lie.
They acquiesce to many of the photogtapher’s whims that they can hear. They face left and face right and look cameras dead on; they smile or they don’t or they smirk or make poster-worthy faces; they have their arms around each other’s shoulders or they don’t. And then come the dreaded single shots. Photographers make Tony take the photo spot next to Steve so that they can take pictures of just each of them. It unnerves him just a little, and he keeps sneaking glances over to Tony to see how Tony fares.
Steve is unimpressed. He’s already had the realization that tiddies mean his pecs, which people have told him at length about before, especially when drunk. Wishing he could say that this was the first time someone told him to get a sports bra, he crumpled the tweet from Tony’s hands and threw it in the bucket again.
“You're what, five years older?” Steve asks, even though he knows the exact number of years, months, and days thanks to a very boring afternoon they had spent together. “Six. Five? Six. Five and a half. Five and three quarters. Five and a quarter? Six and a quarter? It’s not four. Is it
“Don’t,” he says shakily, blowing out his breath in a vain attempt to steady his voice. He knows it’s futile to pretend that he’s okay under the weight of this stupid Oscar and the weight of his mother, but he tries anything. Steve ends up staring blankly at the Oscar. “Please don’t. I can’t.”
He pauses when he hears Tony’s footsteps right behind him, but tries to focus anyway. Lucky for him, the camera’s angled just so that the top 3/4 of anyone who walks in behind him and the sofa won’t be caught by it. Which Steve had thought would be enough, when he had planned for Tony possibly coming back early (even though the chances would be extremely slim).
“Never,” Steve denies. He looks into Tony’s careful eyes, those eyes that are quietly asking him if he wants to go somewhere else and finds courage he doesn’t have. He silently responds with a flick of his eyes that he’ll be okay. Tony’s expression grows daring, though it’s still calculated and careful. So Steve flashes a look to the crowd—on of those looks that Natasha always tells him makes him insanely hot
“Every time I book a movie I just want to call you and tell you everything that I can and you’re not there,” Steve says, “I just... this was you just as much as it was me and you’re not here for it. Centre of the World did so well and I wish you could have seen it. You would have been proud of me, I hope, that I did something out of my league. No one thought I should have taken the role, but you would have told me to take it. You would have loved the movie. Got a Golden Globe for it.”
“Oh,” Steve says, frowning because he wanted to avoid the question. “I mean. I was raised Catholic. Does that count?”
Namely, Tony, who keeps recommending shows that Steve has no clue how he has time for. Tony’s been on the same circuit that Steve has for the last year with this movie; how the hell has he had time to have an actual life and watch things? Steve doesn’t get it at all, but Tony’s also the kind of human being that actually can manage to live with four hours of sleep and caffeine in their blood. Tony’s also the kind of human being to make this press circuit a little more tolerable and definitely more enjoyable. He still hasn’t managed to get tired, unlike Steve, who’s ready to throw everything into a neatly wrapped trash bin and sleep in his own bed.
should be apologizing right now for yelling at you like that without understanding why. I still wouldn’t have agreed, but some of the things I said would have never been thought of.”
And just when Tony can't be anymore surprised by the fact that Steve sometimes does ballet and tap, he says, "But the salsa! Tango! Samba, rumba, jive, bolero, those are all lively!" His excited face changes into one of amusement when he continues on with, "And then someone at the place I go to tried to tell me that I should learn how to belly dance. I'm starting to wonder if everyone thinks that I don't know what I'm doing."
Tony sucked in a breath, his darkened eyes looking up and down Steve in a way that made Steve shudder again, and blew it out angrily. He smiled bitterly. “Last time was a one-off,” he firmly said, though the way that Tony was eyeing Steve said anything but, per the script. Only because of the script. It was ironic, that their characters couldn’t stay away from each other for too long without chance or hunger pulling them back together, no matter how much they tried to deny themselves. In real life, it was anything but, since the feeling Steve had for Tony, the burning hot torch he carried that wasn’t mutual.  “Just a one-off. We’re done.”
Steve—bastard—cuts him off halfway and stands right in his way. "I've gotten to her already," he says, making sure that no one else can hear in the middle of the room. "Tough woman, by the way. I didn't think she'd crack."
“You have any secrets I should know about?” Tony quips, staring at the room in Clint’s house that he was to share with Steve. As if the world wasn’t fucked enough already for him, without this torturous situation. As if Clint wasn’t laughing his ass off about the one room, one bed situation that he had put them in.
It's maybe nine at night and people are just beginning to have fun and loosen up. There's alcohol flowing freely from the bar that Natasha has ever so graciously offered to work, people talking and laughing everywhere, a game of billiards where Barton would be fleecing the others had they been betting money with how well he's playing, music playing thanks to JARVIS working his coded magic, and everyone having a good time. Except Steve, now that Tony looks around for him like a good host. Because he isn't there, not yet.
That stupid, stupid joke he always made around Rogers. And now it was coming to bite him back. Of course. Tony doesn't know how much of this he can take before he snaps himself and they walk away with more bruises than necessary, and perhaps a broken bone or ten on Tony's part. “Homosexuality isn't a perversion or a crime, Rogers, I think it's time to get up to speed.”
”And I’m the hypocrite who yelled at you for trying to come up with a solution for alleviating your goddamn nightmares! You think I don’t know what the end of the path means? We all die in your dream, don’t we? One final mission that ruins us and tears us apart because we weren’t enough? Don't apologize."
"They're definitely going to fuck, right?" Tony asks with a need for confirmation. "I'm not seeing that wrong?"
“Tony Stark,” Tony adds on with a charming, pearly white grin that has probably been the reason Tony has faint laugh lines that match up with the exact smile, “And this fool and I are doing the Wired Autocomplete Interview.”
Steve and Tony aren't friends, not by a long shot and both of them know it. The only things that have changed is that they won't yell at each other every time they talk to each other, and sometimes he'll listen to Steve on the field. Otherwise, they still hate and despise each other to some degree. But, it's possible that in the distant future, they could be friends. Maybe. Everything's still on paper-thin ice.
“Was it weird, kissing your best friend?” the same woman asks, laughing just like everyone else in the crowd, “Either of you.”
Steping onto the relatively clean floors of the entrance—that he knows get dirtier the farther in the bar someone goes—Tony is instantly caught by the smell of cheap, watered-down beer and sex. He glances at the musty wooden walls that enclose the bar, save for the chipped stone and metal one behind the bartenders, and then the unflattering golden lights that everyone knows used to be white. There’s something on the edges of the only two free stools that he isn’t sure is blood or not. Sometimes, he wonders how this place still manages to escape health safety, and then the owner of this place always pops into his mind. Talk about a manipulative, charming bastard.
So Tony does, and he's proud to say that he can more than easily hold his own with Steve thanks to all of those dance classes when he was younger. "Why are you suddenly helping me with this?"
"Neither of them know, do they?" he hears Sam ask just as the door was closing. Tony didn't know what he was talking about, but it seemed like Natasha did, as she only sighs.
“You love him,” Natasha’s voice says in front of him, forcing his eyes to snap to her. “Even if he isn’t your soulmate.”
But since he isn't Thor and he doesn't have another real choice, he finds himself mingling around and talking to various governors and senators and representatives and lawmakers who he hasn't even heard of before, most of them. Well, then and many influential people, most of whom were at the charity gala. Tony's starting to realize why Fury really sent them all here as the titles all fly through his head. Looking around at Natasha, Steve, and Bruce, he sees that they're all realizing the same thing.
For the most part, both Tony and Rogers—he's actually Steve now, since Pepper and Natasha basically forced them to work out a few differences—act like that day never happened. In fact, Tony's has all but physically erased that memory from his mind, had it not been for the fact that he didn't want to forget how Steve took his temper out on Fury. It turned out that Steve had been right about having vacation, and that SHIELD just wanted to make sure he didn't disappear. Basically, it was Fury trying to remind them who's fife they all marched to, except Steve had gone and put a dent in that.
"Yes," Natasha says, somehow in a mood to acknowledge all of his stupid antics. He's not going to ask about that either. "Yes, that is."
Natasha smiles at him sympathetically. He blanches, wondering what on earth he's done to deserve such a scary thing. Tony shudders as she says, "You're the host; tell him." She's completely dropped her bartender character. He doesn't to know what to think.
Steve doesn’t even seem to notice. “I have to tell you something,” he seriously says, “I should have told you of a suspicion from the beginning about HYDRA but I thought maybe it was paranoia and I didn’t realize just what or who had... and...”
Tony pretends to fan himself with his hand. “Rogers, who doesn’t remember the speedo and the shirtless scene?”
Steve smirks and shakes his head. "Your Pepper-ordained 'must socialize' list. I've been going through a few people who are lower priority on it, but then Lucinda Reyes got me for a dance, so I thought, why not?" He looks like he wants to say something else but, then apparently sees something out of the corner of his eye and then stops talking.
In that time, he feels Tony stop right next to him on his right, and kneel just like Steve is doing.
Steve shrugs, letting that finish the thought off. People can read into it what they will. “I know I saw too many questions about what caused that disaster. Since I disappeared off the face of the Earth, I kind of... haven’t answered that and I haven’t let anyone else answer that. Honestly, I wasn’t even going to go to the Oscars because I wasn’t exactly in the right frame of mind for that, but when there’s a very real chance you might win something, you’re expected to suck it up and go. Well, that’s what I told myself.”
He waits for Tony to pull back the last sticker, but Tony is still staring at him with his eyes wide, jaw dropped. He looks stunned to his core. Steve smiles awkwardly, waiting for Tony still to snap out of it.
“Oh,” her voice stops in shock and pity and sadness and oh god, he does not deserve the saintly goddess that is Pepper Potts, “Tony. Are you okay? Do you want me to post a search on SoulFirst? I’m sure someone has posted a zeroing already that might match yours. Where were you?”
So he actually opens up a mindless bubble game on his phone and waits for Fury to be done yelling. He bolts out of there, which isn't exactly uncommon behavior, and then heads into his car. This, he has to check for himself, because it's surreal enough he can't fully grasp it.
“Hey Rogers, we gotta make it actually onto the carpet,” Tony says after he’s done snickering and making jokes to the fans about Steve’s love of dogs. “You know how much trouble we’ll be in if ‘Ria and Pep don’t see us in that carpet for our movie?”
Steve and Tony aren't friends, not by a long shot and both of them know it. The only things that have changed is that they won't yell at each other every time they talk to each other, and sometimes he'll listen to Steve on the field. Otherwise, they still hate and despise each other to some degree. But, it's possible that in the distant future, they could be friends. Maybe. Everything's still on paper-thin ice.
"Please," Tony scoffs, because Natasha's eyeing him carefully and in a way that makes him a little nervous.
Kat nods, but there’s a strange expression on her face as well, as if she’s discovered something new. Maybe it’s because of what Tony had just told her. “How long did it take to practice that scene, then? To get every detail and movement perfect?”
“Steve and I started laughing at each other the second Peggy called cut on that one,” Tony reveals with a smirk. “The scene was supposed to cut off right as I said my words, and no one cut us off until about a minute after, so we just had to try and do something to fill in the gaps until she finally told us to stop and take five. But Steve and I kept laughing after that. We couldn’t film anything else usable that day. So, no, a lot of that was faked.”
“Yeah, Tony Stark, and he doesn’t exactly observe personal boundaries, so they looked into a bunch of your sealed military records, and I thought you said you were a pilot.”
Pierce laughed. “No. I can see why you’d be uncertain, though. It’s so helpful to have him swooping about like an overgrown bat. Draws suspicion off of me and mine. Speaking of which, how did you find out I was Hydra? I like to think that I play my part well.”
Tony shot him an annoyed look. “I’m telling you that the smart money is manipulating me from the background. Letting me do the dirty work and take the fall if things get bad. It would be a lot harder now, because I’m a lot more paranoid and cynical post-Stane, but they probably don’t know that. You should tell them it’s a mistake to recruit me.”
“No, it’s what I can do for you.” He pulled out a watch. “This is a monitoring system that will not trip any alarms and is cleverly disguised as a designer watch. You wear it whenever you’re undercover. We’ll be able to hear anything you hear. It’s not a great angle for a camera, so that you’re going to have to wear in the form of a sticker. Pins are passé. You’ll have to reapply it to whatever you’re wearing. I’ll be monitoring you from here.” Tony waved at a screen where Steve could see the video feed from the cameras.
Steve turned the tech over in his hands. “This is incredible. Is this why you’ve been down here all night?”
The two of them also stealthily joined the relief efforts throughout New York. Knowing that their appearance would cause the press to flock and slow down any work, they went in civilian clothes – Clint made Steve go shopping first so he wouldn’t give himself away with what he referred to as Steve’s old-man-clothes – and tried not to draw any extra attention to themselves. Rebuilding New York took most of the summer, and when fall rolled in, Steve found himself missing the feeling that came with helping in a non-fighting capacity, so he started volunteering other places when he found himself at loose ends: homeless shelters, soup kitchens, and the only place he wore his Captain America uniform – children’s hospitals. Sometimes he dragged the other Avengers with him to the hospital. Iron Man and Thor were always exceptionally popular, and he found himself surprised at how Natasha softened when faced with little girls who wanted to be superheroes just like her.
Steve spent the next few days working out excessively in the SHIELD gym, hoping to catch Rumlow. If he was thinking about the last time he’d seen Tony, well, no one else had to know that. On day three, he got lucky.
“You’re not wrong,” Steve responded, with a quick glance at Tony. “I think we should split up. Clint and Nat won’t be able to get here fast enough. Jim, will you go with Thor in the quinjet to save the President? I trust an Air Force colonel can handle a quinjet, even if he is more used to armor nowadays. Tony and I can go get Pepper and capture Killian.”
“Thanks, Tony. It’s amazing.” Tony started to wave his hand, clearly dismissing all he had done. Steve wasn’t about to stand for that. He touched Tony’s wrist gently, stilling his hand. “Tony,” he said, softer than before. “Really. Thank you. You’re a good man.”
This was a conversation the team had already had. “Don’t worry. I’ve got all the stealth gear you gave me, Natasha is already there, ostensibly on other SHIELD business, and I’ll let Sharon know that I’m in town for an undercover meeting with Pierce. Nothing is going to go wrong, and even if it does, I’ll have local backup until you guys can get there. Natasha said – and I agree – that one of you going with me would look suspicious. Pierce has to think I’m alone here.”
“You keep too many secrets, Nick,” Steve said, speaking for the first time. “It makes it hard for anyone to trust you. Although, to be fair, Phil thought you were clean from the beginning.” He locked eyes with Fury, not blinking and waiting for him to crack.
“Here’s a little holiday greeting I’ve been wanting to send to the Mandarin. I just didn’t know how to phrase it until now. My name is Tony Stark and I’m not afraid of you. I know you’re a coward. So I’ve decided that you just died, pal. I’m gonna come get the body. There’s no politics here, just good old-fashioned revenge. There’s no Pentagon, it’s just you and me. On the off chance that you’re a man, you can find me in the tallest tower in New York. It’s got a great big A on it. Pretty easy to spot. I’ll leave the door unlocked.”
Tony scoffed, and under his breath said “No, she wears a veil and tiara every Sunday. Do you think we could get him out of here?”
Both men stared at him for the briefest of moments; then Tony’s look transformed to dramatically betrayed, while Rhodey’s morphed to a smug sort of approval. “What do you think, Tony? Should we introduce him to the wonders of modern New York pizza?”
Steve grinned. Maybe she was ready for a team, after all. "We'll read him in. The rest of the team, too. We just -"
Steve frowned, but Pepper, who apparently understood whatever Tony was implying, interrupted. “Anyway, we just stopped by so Rhodey could say goodbye. I’m going to drive him to the airport.”
“Okay, so he’s one of the best and he’s on Coulson’s team. Clint, I’d like you to pay Coulson a little visit. Tell him what we know. Tell him we’re sure. Ward is Hydra. He can tell May but no one else. He could’ve spent his time on Coulson’s team recruiting. I want you there in case something goes down when I visit Pierce. Tony, if you could keep going through people that Garrett has recruited, keep building your web, that would be great. Nat, I’d like you to head down to DC now, settle in at SHIELD, keep an eye on things.”
Tony could obviously tell Steve was changing the subject, but he seemed amenable, because he answered. “I’m working on the Trojan Horse that’s going to go in the new SHIELD helicarriers. It’s a baby AI called the Stealth Nanobot to End A Killer. He’ll be mostly inactive on the helicarrier, because too much activity would open him up for detection. He’ll do some passive surveillance and can be activated remotely if we need him.”
“Oh, I’ve, um, actually already read it,” Steve replied. “That one’s actually older than me. It’s wonderful. I, uh, may have related to Lizzy straining against being told what to do because of things she couldn’t change.”
Hello all! Thanks so much to everyone who leaves comments/kudos. It really helps me write when I get discouraged :) As you may have guessed from the title, this will be a Natasha-centric chapter. Let me know if you have suggestions for Queen songs for any of the other Avengers! I have a phrase or two in Russian. I do not speak Russian! I got the words from the internet. I hope they’re right. If you do speak Russian, feel free to correct me. I put the translations in <> right after the phrase. Personal preference – I hate not knowing what’s happening when I read fics, trying to scroll down and get the translation and being confused, so I put it right after. Hopefully that works for you! Anyway, I hope you enjoy!
After they made it back to his apartment with their purchases, Natasha took charge. Clint seemed content to let her lead. Just before they left, she instructed him to set up Steve’s TV and told Steve to come help her rearrange the furniture in the bedroom. He didn’t see the point – they’d arranged it all already, but followed willingly enough. She surprised him by pushing him down into a chair  – which she wouldn’t have been able to do if he hadn’t already trained himself to regard her as a friend – and leaning so that she spoke directly into his ear. “Meet me for coffee at the cafe four blocks west of here tomorrow at 11 am. I need to talk to you.”
Tony gestured with his chin. “Ask and ye shall receive, Cap. Let’s go. Steve was hard-pressed to follow the fight as Tony continually jumped off of things only for armor to surround him midair. Steve fought several of the Extremis agents, who were confounded by his unmeltable shield. Suddenly, he heard Pepper scream and turned to see her fall through a space where the metal of the structure had melted. She had landed on a platform above him where Tony was trying to reach out and grab her. Steve watched, as if it was happening in slow motion, as she started to fall. He could hear Tony talking to her as a buzzing in his head as he eyed the trajectory Pepper would take as he would figure the trajectory of his shield. He started to run at top speed, which for Steve was exceptionally fast, then leaped and flew across the gaping chasm, just in time to catch Pepper before she fell into the fire below. He heard Tony yelling, both above him and through his comm. He could feel Pepper burning his skin, but he didn’t put her down – he knew she’d just melt the metal they were standing on.
"Oh ho ho! He didn't blush when he told me before. He's blushing because you're a woman, which means it's about a woman! Now we have to get him drunk and get it out of him. What d'ya say, Romanoff, wanna help me corrupt a national treasure?"
“That’s a you decision. I mean it’s safe, obviously. She knows I’m bi. And she’s a vault. At least if you tell her, she’ll be trying to set you up with people you might actually be attracted to.”
? “Make yourself useful and get us a couple’a beers.” Kaminsky nervously darted off to do as he was told. Rumlow settled them at a table with the other members of the STRIKE team. “So Cap, we’re curious. How’d you end up as Hydra?”
"Actually I was thinking movie nights." Tony and Natasha stared at him for a moment. "Look, we've done the whole forged in fire thing. More finely honed fighting skills will come with time. We need to get to know each other as people. I'd like us to start by bringing the rest of the team on this, but then, yeah. Movie nights. You guys pick your favorites to show Thor and me. We get dinner. Talk. Aside from Thor, none of you guys have really been on this kind of team. The bond that matters is formed off the battlefield. Then the battlefield reflects that. I know it's a lot to ask, but I'd also like help from both of you to find Bucky. I don't have any idea where to start. And if what Natasha says is true and he's been brainwashed into killing people, I don't know who I'll find at the end of my search."
Steve and Thor touched down in Tennessee at Tony’s last known coordinates. The ground was covered in snow and they found impressions where what looked like something human-sized had crashed into it. “JARVIS said that Tony landed in this area about 20 minutes after he left New York,” Steve frowned. “It took us an hour and a half to get here via quinjet.” Steve knew he’d been twitchy the whole flight, thinking of everything that could happen to a member of his team while he was too far away to help. “Maybe when things cool down I’ll see if he’s willing to help us upgrade.”
Tony slumped. “I hate logic. This is why I wouldn’t take Pepper’s calls. Fine. Tell him he can come back.”
There was pain there. “Yes. I’m sorry, but we’re sure. He’s Hydra, and he’s recruited several members.”
Clint, looking somehow both better and worse than the day before, whistled when he came into Steve's apartment. "No wonder you hate this place. It's awful."
“He’s going to make a move on Natasha?” Tony seemed a lot more confused than the situation warranted.
The faceplate on the Iron Man suit lifted to reveal a smirking Tony Stark. “I understood that reference.”
"Well he may be an ass, but he's not an idiot," Tony piped in. "My trust in him was shaky at best, and this certainly didn't help. We deserved to know."
Phil nodded, acknowledging the hit that had been, but decided to go with a redirect instead of a reply. “If it’s not a stealth B&E, what is it?”
Rhodey looked back and forth between the two of them with an inscrutable expression, then cleared his throat. “Well, I’m glad you called the Captain when you called me. We’ll need backup for what’s coming.”
“I know you’re right,” Phil agreed sadly, “but I have a hard time believing that of any of them. And are you telling me that you think Fury might be Hydra?”
“Tough love, man. Besides, you should consider yourself lucky. Me coming down here stopped Natasha from doing it.”
“I’m going to ignore your talk of the future and assume you have actual proof for accusing a man who turned down a Nobel Peace Prize and ask why it took the word of someone who is apparently our enemy for you to trust me.”
“You’re going to have trouble believing this, but I need you to give it a shot. I’m you from the future. I know, I know. Crazy, right? I was just saying the other day how much I miss the days when the craziest thing science had come up with was me. We weren’t supposed to change anything, but I’m sure I’ve already done that telling you Bucky was alive. I wasn’t lying about that, by the way. He is. I don’t have much time, so I’ll just tell you two things. The first is to prove I am who I say. You’re attracted to men. As much as you wanted to love Peggy, and as much as you might’ve grown to be happy with her, she was never your destiny. You’ve never told anyone, not even Bucky, but your first crush was on the boy down the street who lived with his family over the butcher shop.” Steve opened his mouth, but the recording continued, “Don’t interrupt. Yeah, I knew you were gonna. Just listen. The other thing I’m going to say is this: trust Tony. You won’t always understand him. In fact, you’ll almost never understand him, and by the time you’ve unraveled one thing, he’s already done five more crazy things and you can’t catch up. But trust him. Trust the team. And make sure you deserve their trust in you. What you started today can be the most amazing thing in your life if you let it. So let it. I have to go. Good luck. Don’t make my mistakes.”
Steve cleared his throat. “Well, for me, after my mother died and Bucky was about to be shipped overseas, that person was Erskine, and yeah, I’d say I felt indebted to him.”
“Then you have to call me Steve.” Rhodey looked a little awed that he was being allowed to call Captain America by his first name. Steve was starting to get used to this treatment – between Coulson and the junior SHIELD agents, he’d discovered that a lot of people were fans of the Captain America comic books and cartoons.
“Hey, Rogers,” came Tony’s voice through the speakers. “I hear you’re getting a crash course on the brave new world without me. My very delicate feelings are wounded and now you’re going to have to make it up to me. I want your feedback on suits for the team. Maybe field test some stuff for me. Come to the tower.”
Natasha gave the most genuine smile Steve had seen. He didn't love that it was sort of at his expense, but he'd take what he could get. "Look, it's not about a woman. And I can't get drunk. Besides, it appears that I never told you guys, or future me wouldn't have given it as evidence. It has to stay a secret."
“We do have a few, though,” Natasha said. “Bobbi Morse, for one,” she smirked at Clint, who rolled his eyes.
“I don’t have to. Much more to the point, he trusts me. And he can’t resist a mystery. You guys have big plans for the scepter?”
what this would do to me. I hardly slept for months. Everyone else I killed, that was bad enough, but to know I was responsible for your death –”
is Bucky Barnes? They didn't do him any justice at all in the comics. Musta had all the good artists working on you," Clint grinned. "Too bad. He was always my favorite. No offense. And I didn't even know how pretty he was." Steve looked up sharply. JARVIS had said it was fine now, but he hadn't been prepared to hear Clint just say outright that he thought Bucky was pretty. "I just loved that he was a sniper," Clint carried on without commenting on Steve's noticeable jolt. "Man, I thought he was the best thing since sliced bread. His picture can stay up. Hers too. Everything else in this depressing pit has to go." He looked Steve up and down. "Including your fashion sense. Come on Tash, it'll be fun."
