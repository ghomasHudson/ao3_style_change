‘I’ll leave Fang with yeh, Headmaster,’ Hagrid said, still staring menacingly at Karkaroff. ‘Stay, Fang.’
McGonagall's expression softened ever so slightly, but she didn't move. 'We're looking into it,' she said evasively.
They walked through the main street, past Zonko’s, which Cas gazed at mournfully, and turned up a side street, at the top of which stood a small inn. A battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door, with a picture of a wild boar’s severed head, leaking blood on to the white cloth around it. The sign creaked in the wind as they approached.
They spent most of the day chatting with Hagrid, until around half-past five, when it began growing dark.
‘You’ll get used to it,’ Sherlock said bracingly, his hands lingering for a touch longer than was necessary.
John had expended too much energy talking to Harry and Gabriel, so quickly fell asleep. Mrs Weasley passed Sherlock and pillow and a blanket, which he carefully arranged so John would be comfortable.
John winced. He didn’t remember anything at all from his trance in the Shrieking Shack. Only the dizzying feeling of being somewhere else, far away, and Sherlock’s voice calling him back.
‘Oh yeah,’ said Dean. ‘Worth it to give Malfoy a beat down if you ask me.’ He looked around and noticed a lot of Ravenclaws looking excited and triumphant. ‘What are they so happy about?’
‘Couldn’t have a better spot!’ Mr Weasley said happily. ‘The pitch is just on the other side of the woods here, we’re as close as we could be.’
‘Hey, insomnia buddies,’ Dean said, pointing at John, then sitting next to him. ‘What’s up? Where’s Sherlock?’
‘Whatever you wanna call it,’ Dean smiled, noticing the slight shimmer of Cas’s Shield Charm drop. ‘Come on, let’s go back inside. It’s cold, and lunch is nearly over.’
Umbridge launched into what seemed to be a well-rehearsed speech, and Dean's concentration disappeared almost immediately. He felt himself getting fidgety, so he looked around to watch everyone else.
‘He’s retired, used to work at the Ministry,’ said Charlie. ‘I met him once when Dad took me into work with him. He was an Auror – one of the best… a Dark-wizard-catcher,’ he added at Harry and John’s blank looks. ‘Half the cells in Azkaban are full because of him. He made himself loads of enemies, though… The families of the people he caught, mainly… and I heard he’s getting really paranoid in his old age. Doesn’t trust anyone anymore. Sees Dark Wizards everywhere.’
He took a few deep breaths and calmed himself as much as he could. As scared as he was, this seemed to be important and, after all, no one could see him.
‘How is it?’ John demanded, turning on him with wide, fearful eyes. ‘There are so many ways this power could go wrong, and now someone’s trying to force it to happen.’
Umbridge raised an eyebrow. ‘I trust that Madam Pomfrey has it in hand, or perhaps you need to go to St Mungo’s if it is as bad as you say.’
Sherlock, however, had his eyes fixed on the magical billboard that was floating across them. Gold letters kept writing themselves on the board, then wiping itself away, advertising different magical products, such as
'I can't see what it says, but it feels like bad news,' John said, squinting into the distance. 'Something to look forward to.'
‘Occlumency, in case Voldemort tries to read my mind, but the way Snape teaches it, it’s making it worse if anything.’
They climbed out from under the Whomping Willow together and Cas stopped to breathe the fresh air in the dimming light.
‘Yes, yes, of course. I was very sorry to hear about that. I met her a few times, Theresa was a wonderful woman.’
They finally reached their tents. Cas dashed into his to grab his potions. Bill and Charlie were waiting outside the Weasley’s tent, but Sherlock went past them too into his own tent He lowered John into one of the soft armchairs in the living room.
‘It’s the only way we’ll know for sure,’ Sherlock said. ‘We know someone was blocking you from the first task, if the curse is still in effect, you won’t be able to see the second.’
Sherlock stood in front of John and made him stop pacing. ‘Even if we couldn’t stop the attack, we’ve given them enough time to find him. I’m sure he’ll be all right.’
‘Actually, I don’t think I will,’ said John. ‘I don’t get many surprises, and I’d rather discuss it at the same time as everyone else, like a normal person.’
Mr Weasley hesitated. As angry as he was with Fred and George, he hadn’t truly intended to tell Mrs Weasley what had happened. There was silence while Mr Weasley eyed his wife nervously.
‘That sounds just ridiculous enough to be true,’ Sherlock said, squinting into the water for signs of Kelpies.
He was deep in thought as they crossed back through the Entrance Hall, so much so that he jumped violently when Moody passed him and said, ‘All right there, Watson?’
They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly-polished, dark wood floor. The peacock-blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming golden symbols that kept moving and changing. John thought that Sherlock would know what they meant.
Viktor Krum and the other Durmstrang students had dithered at the entrance, but eventually settled at the Slytherin table, much to Ron’s disappointment. They already looked more relaxed than the Beauxbatons students, taking off their furs to reveal deep red robes, and examining all the golden tableware, impressed.
They watched him, unable to make out what he was saying, but saw the girls burst into fits of giggles.
Harry finished describing how he had seen the attack, and Dumbledore conjured more chairs for all of them.
Madam Pomfrey siphoned a drop of Cas’s blood into one more phial full of clear liquid that turned jet black as soon as the blood touched it.
It was chilly and the moon was still out as they set off. Only a dull, greenish tinge along the horizon showed that daybreak was growing closer.
John then heard a faint whisper. Neither Cedric or Gabriel seemed to have heard anything as they started back towards the Hufflepuff common room. John looked around, searching for the voice, then he heard it again, a little more clearly this time.
‘Oh. All right. Goodnight, John, Dean.’ He nodded curtly and went through the portrait without waiting for their response.
Dean slowly made his way through his work, until a tapping sound on the window next to him distracted him. He looked up to see an owl sitting outside. He opened the window and it fluttered over to Sherlock.
‘It’s easy,’ said Fred. ‘Concealed door behind a painting of a fruit bowl. You tickle the pear and it giggles, and-’ He stopped and looked at her suspiciously. ‘Why?’
‘Use your brains, Ron,’ said Bill. ‘If they were really Death Eaters, they worked really hard to keep themselves out of Azkaban when You-Know-Who lost power, and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to torture and kill people. I bet they’d be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back. They denied they’d ever been involved with him and went back to their daily lives… I don’t reckon he’d be over-pleased to see them, do you?’
They ran back down the stairs, but Cas stumbled and fell at the bottom, no longer able to talk or move, desperate to keep his escaping power under control.
‘But there are only two extra people,’ said Harry. ‘Why’s Filch putting out four chairs? Who else is coming?’
Once back in his dormitory, he began to feel nervous, but pushed it down. He was careful not to crease his dress robes as he put them on, once again admiring the silkiness of the material. He stopped at the tie. He still had both the plain one and the one with the tiny rose on it. Sherlock was going with someone else, he told himself, but there was still a part of him that thought
Cas smiled at him. ‘Dean, this is exactly why you’ll be a good teacher. You can tell what someone needs to learn, and that’s the most important skill a teacher has.’
‘He had a moment of weakness,’ Sherlock continued firmly. ‘He won't allow himself that again. You missed your chance.’
‘You have all used a Portkey before?’ They all nodded and reached out to touch a bit of the kettle. ‘Good. On the count of three, then… one...two…’
‘Hey,’ Dean smiled, sitting on the bed opposite him. ‘Sandwich?’ He passed one over and Cas took it, but he just held it in his hand without looking at Dean. ‘What are you working on?’
The Veela had started dancing again, and by the time they stopped, Bulgaria were once again in control of the Quaffle.
'Wands away,' Umbridge instructed, and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to their bags. 'As we finished Chapter One last lesson, I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence "Chapter Two, Common Defensive Theories and their Derivation". There will be no need to talk.'
‘Okay, one more stop and we can go home,’ said Sherlock as they exited the shop with their bags. He tied the handles of the bags to the belt around their stack of books, making them weightless too.
Harry and John followed him down a corridor and around the corner, and through a pair of heavy oak doors. They emerged in a cluttered open area divided into cubicles, which was buzzing with talk and laughter.
Then there was a gentle knock at the door, and Ginny, Neville, Lavender, Parvati, Seamus and Dean Thomas had arrived.
A man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents. When he heard their footsteps, he turned his head to look at them.
‘Well, you know, they do work well on non-magical wounds,’ said Hermione fairly. ‘I suppose something in the snake’s venom dissolves them, or something. I wonder where the tearoom is?’
‘John, please,’ she said. ‘I love you and your sister so much. I don’t want you to go through the same thing he did.’
‘He’s in our compartment still. He seems to like the new basket I got him. At least, I think he does. He hasn’t escaped from it yet. Is she yours, John? I didn’t think anyone liked toads.’
John’s head lolled slightly where he was still sitting at his desk, and Ron and Hermione’s bickering took on a muffled quality. He stayed awake, however, as Moody’s magical eye fixed on him and held him in place, while his regular eye watched Harry, Ron and Hermione.
‘Professor Karkaroff is talking to Harry and Professor Moody,’ Castiel said, tall enough to see over the majority of the crowd. ‘He’s leaving now, though.’
‘Witness for the defence, Mycroft Holmes, Head of the Department of Mysteries,’ said Mycroft. ‘Must we go through this again, Minister? Surely we all have more important things to be doing.’
Fred, George and Ginny where nowhere to be seen, nor where Sam and Dean, though the path was packed with plenty of other extremely nervous people.
'The spells I use to help you read. Sherlock created them, but I can alter them and refine them for you.'
John pulled his hand away, half expecting to see blood, but there was nothing there. ‘Yeah, I just-’ He cut himself off, hissing through his teeth. ‘It hurts-
‘Wait out here,’ Dean barked to the others when they reached the hospital wing, shoving the door open and dragging the stretcher inside.
‘I think so, yeah.’ John took one last look around his room, now stripped bare. He took a deep breath, and started down the stairs to see who had come for him.
Dean looked around for a quiet place to talk to Cas, and saw a screen appear in a far corner of the room. ‘Okay, come with me.’ He walked towards it, tapping Harry’s shoulder. ‘I’ll just be a sec.’
‘Bertha Jorkins again?’ Sherlock whispered, but John had already been deafened by the vision. ‘Do we have any water?’ he asked those gathered around the fire.
They followed Harry, Ron, Hermione and the twins out of the Great Hall, listening to Fred and George planning their Ageing Potion, in order to enter the Tournament.
‘Hedwig turned up at the window,’ Ron told him. ‘She looked hurt so Harry took her to find someone to heal her.’
‘Funny you should ask,’ said Hermione, with a nasty look at Ron. She took off the lid and showed them the contents.
Dean shielded his eyes, and heard things cracking and crumbling around them. When it was finally over, Dean opened his eyes to see that Cas had curled up in a ball.
‘Thank you,’ said Dumbledore. He looked around at Professor McGonagall. ‘Minerva, I need you to go and wake the other Weasley children.’
‘Any news of Bertha Jorkins yet, Ludo?’ Mr Weasley asked as Bagman settled on the grass by the fire.
‘The more scared and upset he is, the stronger it gets, and you need it as strong as possible to help fight Voldemort. Well you can forget it.’ Dean was suddenly on his feet again. ‘Don’t think I haven’t seen what you’ve done to Harry and John. Well you can leave Cas out of it. He’s coming with me, and if you even think about going near him, I’ll blow your whole secret operation, and don’t think I won’t.’
Moody began beckoning students forward in turn and put the Imperius Curse on them. John watched apprehensively as, one by one, they did the most extraordinary things under its influence. Dean Thomas hopped three times around the room, singing the national anthem. Lavender imitated a squirrel. Neville performed a series of quite astonishing gymnastics he certainly would not have been capable of in his normal state. Not one of them seemed to be able to fight off the curse, and each of them only recovered when Moody had removed it.
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean saw Cas back away slightly, and discretely placed himself between Cas and Karkaroff.
John bit his lip. ‘Can it be delivered? We came by Floo powder and I don’t think a whole tank will fit.’
‘Some Muggle heard bangs and shouting,’ Mr Diggory continued, ‘so they went and called those what-d’you-call-‘ems – please-men. Arthur, you’ve got to get over there-‘
She flung her arms around Mr Weasley’s neck and the paper fell out of her had. As it fell, the headline became visible: SCENES OF TERROR AT THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP, complete with a twinkling, black and white photograph of the Dark Mark hanging over the tree-tops.
‘Oh, I’ll soon talk him out of that,’ Sherlock said furiously. He made to leave, but Dean caught his arm.
John took a deep breath. ‘There’s been a breakout at Azkaban. I didn’t see who, but I suppose we’ll find out in the morning.’
Sherlock took the letter, and Melly clicked her fingers, making the bags levitate before her, which she transported upstairs.
Welcome back everyone! Thanks to Pepipanda, hhhelcat and OtakuElf for the awesome comments. I had a really good time talking to you all last time. I hope you all enjoy this chapter and I'll be back again in two weeks!
‘Oh, really!’ Hermione spluttered, opening the letter from the grey owl. ‘It’s - oh, how ridiculous-’ She thrust the letter at Harry, which John reached over and grabbed from him. It was not handwritten, but composed from pasted letters that seemed to have been cut from the
All the people in the room started to hurt John’s head, so he finished his tea and left for the peace of his bedroom.
‘Just carrying Cas’s bag, Professor. Helping him with his work, that kinda thing,’ Dean said, smiling innocently.
John pushed himself up and drank two goblets before he felt any better. 'Well, that was fun,' he said once he was finished.
He took out his wand and gave a great sweeping wave with it, extinguishing all the candles in the room. The Goblet of Fire now shone more brightly than anything else in the Hall, the blue-white flames almost painful on the eyes.
The spell hit Dean full force and threw him into the air, spinning into one of the bookcases and falling to the floor with a thump.
Dean chose a spot nearby Hagrid's hut and used his wand to clear a patch of grass away. He set up the cauldron and had Cas sit in front of it.
John watched, amused as they all tried to get organised for photographs. He was just pleased that he’d gotten out of Potions for nothing.
John sat down with Castiel, Sherlock, Sam and Dean. ‘How’s Hermione?’ John asked Cas, who was pushing a small piece of pork and some peas around his plate.
When they got there, they found the others picking at what Hagrid called a beef casserole, but declined to have some when Hermione unearthed a large claw from hers.
John allowed his mind to wander while Trelawney performed her usual routine, predicting Harry’s imminent death.
Dean smiled, his cheeks warming. ‘All right then, we’re meeting in McGonagall’s classroom at lunch. But remember, it’s okay if you change your mind. I get it.’
First came Neville with Dean Thomas and Lavender, who were closely followed by Parvati and Padma Patil with Cho and one of her friends. Then Luna Lovegood; then Katie Bell, Alicia Spinnet and Angelina Johnson, Colin and Dennis Creevey, with Sam, Ernie Macmillan, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Hannah Abbott, Molly Hooper, some other Hufflepuffs that they didn’t know, the three other Ravenclaw boys in their year, Anthony Goldstein, Michael Corner and Terry Boot, Ginny and, bringing up the rear, Lee Jordan and the Weasley twins.
‘I’m sorry about your mother,’ Cas murmured, taking another sip. ‘It seems we have a lot in common.’
‘Yes, sir,’ said an eager voice, and John realised with a jolt that it was Percy Weasley. He was sitting right at the end of the row, eyes fixed on the parchment in front of him, a quill poised in his hand.
‘And stop spending so much time in bed. I’ll make you some tea, but then you should go for a walk and get some fresh air.’
‘After you,’ said Sherlock. He sighed quietly so that John didn’t hear, then followed him to Hagrid’s.
‘Aren’t you his best friend?’ Ron accused. ‘And I thought you were some sort of genius, or was that just your big mouth?’
Then, hysterical laughter erupted from several people at the Hufflepuff table. Heads all over the Hall turned to look at them.
Welcome back everyone! Thanks to hhhelcat for the comment :) I'm quite far ahead in writing it, but man is this book long. I've only just got to Hogwarts, there's certainly a lot to cover. Enjoy the chapter and I'll see you all next time!
John reluctantly finished his tea, thanked Hagrid, and exited the hut. He bit his lip, staring up at the castle.
When the desserts arrived, there were again a number of unfamiliar dishes, but soon enough, the golden dishes were cleared, and Dumbledore was on his feet again.
‘Here,’ said Kingsley, handing Mr Weasley a sheaf of parchment. ‘I need as much information as possible on flying Muggle vehicles sighted in the last twelve months. We’ve received information that Black might still be using his old motorcycle.’ Kingsley gave them an indulgent wink and added, in a whisper, ‘Give him the magazine, he might find it interesting.’ Then he said in normal tones, ‘And don’t take too long, Weasley, the delay on the firelegs report held our investigation up for a month.’
Dean and Harry then spent their morning lessons convincing Hermione that the Room of Requirement was legitimate, and tracking down everyone on the list to let them know about the meeting, without Umbridge noticing.
Squeezing Bubotubers was disgusting. As each swelling was popped, a large amount of thick, yellowish green liquid burst forth, which smelled strongly of petrol. They caught it in bottles as Professor Sprout had indicated, and by the end of the lesson, had collected several pints.
John watched as Sherlock moved among the bookshelves, fingers lightly brushing the spines as he went, occasionally taking one and putting it in a pile next to John. At first, John thought he was pulling them out at random, but once he looked at some of them, he realised that they were all either one of a kind, or first editions.
Cas caught him, Dean took off his shoes, and they both lifted him onto the bed next to John. Cas then drew the curtains around them. 'If these potions work as they should, he should be able to sleep through the night. He'll recover.'
‘Do not lie to me! I can always tell, Wormtail! You are regretting ever returning to me. I revolt you. I see you flinch when you look at me, feel you shudder when you touch me…’
‘All right, everybody, settle down,’ he called out, and the chatter died down as everyone turned to face him and Harry.
Dean lifted his arms to rub his face, but stopped when he saw blood all over his hands and wrists beginning to dry. His vision narrowed until that was all he saw, memories flashing through him.
John deflated, although he supposed there would have been more of a celebration if Voldemort had actually been caught.
'What are Veela?' said John, but his question was answered for him by the hundred Veela that glided onto the pitch. They were women. Beautiful in a superhuman sort of way, with pale skin that was almost luminous and white-gold hair.
Professor Moody was limping down the marble staircase. His wand was out and pointing straight at a pure white ferret, which was shivering on the floor, exactly where Malfoy had been standing.
Harry's potion had been congealing in his cauldron and Dean wrinkled his nose as it began to issue foul black smoke that smelled like burnt rubber. Snape swept over and peered down his nose at it.
“‘Third regurgitating public toilet reported in Bethnal Green, kindly investigate immediately.” This is getting ridiculous…’
‘Colin, I fell in!’ he said shrilly, throwing himself into the empty seat. ‘It was brilliant! And something in the water grabbed me and pushed me back in the boat!’
‘Go on, then, Potter,’ Malfoy cut in, drawing his own wand. ‘Moody’s not here to look after you now - do it if you’ve got the guts-’
‘That makes all the tasks, that - thing - you saw the other day, and Mr Crouch,’ Sherlock said, mostly to himself. ‘What’s the connection?’
‘Very well, Karkaroff,’ Crouch said coldly, ‘you have been of assistance. I shall review your case. You will return to Azkaban in the meantime…’
Hagrid finally spoke as they strode past the lake. ‘How dare he,’ he growled. ‘How dare he accuse Dumbledore. Like Dumbledore’d do anythin’ like that. Like Dumbledore wanted
‘Yeah, once he turned Mrs Norris invisible for a week. Filch was going spare when he couldn’t find her. Legendary,’ George said dreamily.
Cas didn’t look all right. It was hard for John to focus in his current state, but from what he could tell, the colour had drained from Cas’s face.
Harry groaned, but half an hour later, he was sitting in his regular seat next to Ron in the Divination classroom. Dean sat in his seat beside John, and noticed that John was looking quite nauseous.
John groaned, but there was nowhere to hide, and she came over to them sporting a dazzling smile, and shimmering slightly.
John spent much of his first few days in bed. His connection to Sherlock was tenuous at best, but with his senses dulled, his visions became muffled. The nightmares didn’t stop, but that’s all they were, and eventually, he sat his mother down at the kitchen table and explained everything that had happened the previous year.
‘I- I will, Goodbye.’ He tripped over his seat on his way out, and all but ran out into the courtyard. ‘Stupid,’ he muttered to himself. ‘Of course he has a date.’ He kicked at a pebble, which clattered across the cobbles, then actually made his way to the greenhouses.
At that moment, the door in the corner of the dungeon opened, and a man flanked by two Dementors entered.
‘I thought that one was fairly obvious, you did just have three Death Eaters attempt to kidnap you.’
Dean sighed. ‘Okay, Cas, listen to me. I don’t want to scare you, but if you ever do have to fight with a Death Eater, or a Demon, or something, you can’t hold back, ‘cause they won’t. You need to use every advantage you have, and I’d say you have a pretty big one.’
‘Of course not. You just need to be smarter in your approach. I still think I should look through his things-’
‘Fine, fine,’ said Mr Weasley, a little too heartily. ‘You - er - haven’t seen Healer Smethywick, have you?’
With no guidance from the teachers, Gabriel and the Head Girl began chivvying the Hogwarts students out of the Hall.
Dumbledore looked very seriously at the three of them. 'These incidents are all linked. The Ministry disagrees - as you may have heard, while waiting outside my office.'
Just then, Luna drifted over from the Ravenclaw table. Many people were staring at her and a few were openly laughing and pointing; she had managed to procure a hat shaped like a life-size lion’s head, which was perched precariously on her head.
Then Cas promptly fell asleep, though Dean struggled to calm his racing thoughts before he too finally drifted off.
He followed Harry’s lead distractedly. He couldn’t get the image of Sherlock flying across the Great Hall out of his head, and he was disturbed by the desperation pressing in on him from the vision, even now.
Dean caught up with the rest of the Gryffindors and made their way down to Care of Magical Creatures. Umbridge was there already, to inspect their lesson. Dean stood as far away from her as possible, at a table crawling with Bowtruckles, and he spotted the red rash on the back of John's hand.
‘Oh, Professor, look!’ Lavender squealed excitedly. ‘I think I’ve got an unaspected planet! Which one’s that, Professor?’
‘Thank you, Eric,’ Mr Weasley said firmly, steering them both away from the desk, and into a smaller hall that had at least twenty lifts behind wrought golden grilles.
John glanced over at Castiel, who was staring at his tightly clenched fists on the table. John nudged Sherlock.
‘Anyway, Pamela’s super awesome, but she was having a vision one day and she saw something that made her go blind.’
John slid down onto the stone floor, breathing heavily, waiting for Harry’s hearing to run its course. Mr Weasley paced nervously. Neither of them spoke. After a moment, Dumbledore came flying down the corridor, and into the courtroom, leaving a rather old woman standing outside with them.
John just gaped at him until Molly nudged him under the table. He cleared his throat. 'Yes, of course. Lovely to meet you, Luna.’ He shook her hand, but she just continued to stare.
‘Want one, Watson?’ said Malfoy, holding out a badge to John. ‘I’ve got loads, and you’ve probably already predicted Potter’s humiliating defeat. But don’t touch my hand, now. I’ve just washed it, you see, don’t want a Mudblood sliming it up.’
John groaned dramatically, leaning back against the chair. ‘I didn’t know either, it just sort of happened.’
They spent the rest of the lesson taking notes on the Unforgiveable Curses. John found himself to be particularly lethargic after his episode, so Hermione helped him once she had finished her own. They were silent until the bell rang and Moody dismissed them.
‘Total control,’ Moody said quietly. ‘I could make it jump out of the window, drown itself, throw itself down one of your throats… Years back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the Imperius Curse. Some job for the Ministry, trying to sort out who was being forced to act, and who was acting of free will.
‘Definitely. Kicking you off the team would probably be the single dumbest thing they could possibly do, and seeing as you’re all Ravenclaw, I’m pretty sure they’d go the smart route.’
‘Well, the class seems fairly advanced for their level,’ she said briskly. ‘Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the Strengthening Solution. I think the Ministry would prefer it if that were removed from the syllabus.’
'That's exactly what he thinks you're doing,' said Sirius, 'or rather, that's what he's afraid Dumbledore's doing - forming his own private army, with which he will be able to take on the Ministry of Magic.'
‘That was really good,’ Harry said, ‘but we’ve overrun, so we’d better leave it there. Same time next week?’
Sherlock was scribbling on a scrap of parchment. ‘I was assuming you wouldn’t want to be woken up again,’ he said, showing John the “Do not disturb” he had written on it.
'Yes, those with eyes too clouded by the mundane to See as I See, to Know as I Know… of course, we Seers have always been feared, always persecuted…it is - alas - our fate.' She gulped and dabbed at her wet cheeks with the end of her shawl.
Fudge gave an unpleasant smirk. ‘The boy believes himself a Seer,’ he said. ‘I thought we might be hearing something like this.’
‘This is a letter to Dumbledore,’ he said. ‘We may not know what his plan is, but at least Dumbledore will be alert to anything suspicious. You’re safe.’
‘Oh, I thought you would be asleep by now,’ Sherlock murmured, sitting cross-legged on the end of Dean’s bed. ‘I just came to check on him.’
He straightened up again, but when he blinked, everything fell silent. ‘What-?’ He looked around, everyone around him ignoring him with their heads down. Where the magical energy had been buzzing before, it was now more reminiscent of Grimmauld Place. The corridor was darker, gloomier. John bit his lip. He had slipped into a vision, that he knew, but of what and when? He looked back up at the fountain, but the golden statues were gone. In its place was now a gigantic statue of polished black stone. It depicted a witch and wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones, looking down at the Ministry workers toppling out of the fireplaces. Engraved in foot-high letters at the base of the statue were the words: MAGIC IS MIGHT. John swallowed, shaking his head. ‘I don’t like this,’ he whispered. He leaned closer to the statue, and was horrified to find that what he first thought were just intricate thrones, were actually carvings of people. Hundreds of twisted, horrible, naked people, pressed together to hold up the weight of the handsomely robed witch and the wizard. As John stared at them, he realised they were meant to be Muggles.
The Goblet turned red once more, causing John to be wracked with tremors again, and the name of the Hogwarts champion shot out.
‘Yes,’ said Trelawney, nodding impressively, ‘it comes, ever closer, it circles overhead like a vulture, ever lower… ever lower over the castle…’
‘I’ve used it against him,’ Harry said quietly. ‘It saved my life in June. But if you think it’s beneath you, you can leave.’
‘Why not? You were five, how could you know the difference between chia seeds and poppy seeds? I’m sixteen and I don’t know the difference. Cas, I’m telling you, it’s not your fault. It was an accident, and I guarantee that your mom wouldn’t want you to blame yourself either. Did you never talk to Gabriel about this?’
Then Dumbledore called out from the back row, where he stood with the other teachers. ‘Aha! Unless I am very much mistaken, the delegation from Beauxbatons approaches!’
Over the next half an hour, the box began to fill, and the Minister for Magic arrived with the Bulgarian Minister.
Cas didn’t look up when Dean hurried over to him, nor did he react when Dean pulled his feet out of the water.
Dean glanced up at him. He didn't want to talk about it, but Cas had already shown him such trust that day, it was only fair to return the gesture. 'I, uh, mostly dream about stuff that happened when I was a kid. My dad's an Auror, you know, so he used to take Sam and me around with him when he was chasing something. Mostly magical creatures that MACUSA didn't want to deal with. But there were Demons and werewolves and stuff too.'
Castiel was already on the train, in his robes and saving them a compartment. They dumped their luggage and hopped back down onto the platform to say goodbye.
'This is good so far,' he said, 'but this sentence here is a little backwards.' He circled it, then Roger blew his whistle, so he handed the parchment back to Dean and flew back into formation.
I’m afraid you’ll have to wait for information on motorcycles; we’re extremely busy at the moment.’ Mr Weasley dropped his voice. ‘If you can get away before seven, Molly’s making meatballs.’
'Yeah. Every single one.' Sam grimaced, then waved Castiel over. 'They sent me this as well, I think it's a list of potions that'll work on him.'
‘Winky was there too,’ Hermione said. ‘Crouch’s elf. She didn’t seem quite as pleased about working at Hogwarts as Dobby did.’
It took a moment, but Cas's Ravenclaw tie flew into his hand. He removed Cas's bowtie and tied the Ravenclaw one on him instead. 'Perfect!’ he said, stepping back to admire his work. 'Blue is your colour.’
Cas was sitting at lunch a couple of days before the end of term, admiring the Christmas trees, when Gabriel came bounding up to him.
‘I sense your powers have grown greatly since you were last here, young Oracle. But you have questions for me?’
‘You’ll see,’ said Charlie. ‘Just don’t tell Percy I mentioned it. It’s “classified information until such time as the Ministry sees it to release it” after all.’
‘And so you volunteer to go and fetch me a substitute? I wonder… perhaps the task of nursing me has become wearisome for you, Wormtail? Could this suggestion of abandoning the plan be nothing more than an attempt to desert me?’
‘Why don’t you just go now?’ Dean encouraged. ‘You can’t be learning much if you feel this bad anyway.’
John glanced up from his bowl of porridge, but dropped his spoon with a clatter at the sudden pain in his ribs. ‘Ow!’ he yelped, pressing a hand to his chest.
‘Well, it wasn’t giants who worried us most,’ said Hagrid. ‘We were more concerned abou’ the Death Eaters. Dumbledore had told us before we wen’ not ter tangle with ‘em if we could avoid it, an’ the trouble was they knew we was around - ‘spect Golgomath told ‘em abou’ us. At night, when the giants were sleepin’ an’ we wanted ter be creepin’ inter caves, Macnair and the other one were sneakin’ round the mountains lookin’ fer us. I was hard put to stop Olympe jumpin’ out at ‘em,’ said Hagrid, the corners of his mouth lifting his wild beard, ‘she was rarin’ ter attack ‘em… fiery, yeh know… ‘spect it’s the French in her…’
‘I bet some of them put it in last night after we’d all gone to bed,’ said Harry. ‘I would’ve if it was me.’
'But he cannot now give testimony, Cornelius,' said Dumbledore. 'He cannot give evidence about why he killed those people.'
They looked up and saw Castiel standing there. He was wearing his ever-present trench coat, only now it fit much better since he seemed to have grown half a foot at least since the last time they had seen him. The effect of such a growth spurt made him look painfully thin, but now he was the same height as Sherlock, if not taller.
Dean shook his head and took a deep breath, his heart hammering ever faster. ‘I wanted to ask you - um - well -’
'Yes,' Harry said furiously. Snape had already given them homework, and Harry was meant to be at Quidditch practice that evening.
'Well, I'd better get going, I can hear Kreacher coming down the stairs. I'll write to tell you a time I can make it back into the fire, shall I? If you can stand to risk it?'
Dean sunk down on the end of his bed, but nervously bounced his legs. ‘I have a bad feeling,’ he said defensively, ‘and so do they.’ He pointed at John and Sherlock, who were both already sound asleep.
my thing,’ said Hermione, her face pink from the cold. ‘Mum and Dad are a bit disappointed, but I told them that anyone who’s serious about their exams is staying behind to study. They want me to do well, so they understand.’
Lupin shook his head, taking off his jacket. ‘Molly was right, I couldn’t break through the enchantments around the house.’
‘This is nothing to do with Lucy,’ Cas snapped, shouldering his bag. ‘I have to go, I’m late for Transfiguration.’
John awoke the next morning to Sherlock shaking his shoulder. He sat up blearily and swayed. He groaned, feeling extremely dizzy and as if he hadn’t slept at all. He didn’t have the energy to get dressed, so he ended up being the only one is his pyjamas with a coat thrown over the top.
‘There were people listening in that pub. And let’s face it, we don’t know how many people who turned up we can trust… any of them could have run off and told Umbridge…’
‘Miserable old bat,’ Ron said bitterly, as they joined the crowds descending the staircases back to the Great Hall. ‘That’ll take all weekend, that will…’
Dean shook his head. 'It's ok. Why don't we find you someone to dance with? Hey, maybe Katie will be up for it,’ he said, looking around for her.
‘No,’ Dumbledore said calmly. ‘I have long said the Ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures.’
John bent down, ducked under the flap, and felt his jaw drop. They had walked into an old-fashioned, three-roomed flat with a bathroom and kitchen, and a strong smell of cats.
Just then, a door on the second landing, and a face poked out wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a very annoyed expression.
Cas bought them all a Butterbeer each and they sat in a less densely packed corner, passing Ron on the way.
‘None of your business,’ he said, a little more irritably than he’d intended. ‘Sorry, I mean, I can’t tell you.’
All the judges sat down at the velvet table, with the champions sitting opposite, and Ollivander standing in the space between.
John fidgeted guiltily, though he was sure that Dumbledore wouldn’t truly mind his own ventures into the Forest.
Dean too leaned against the wall. ‘He’s sleeping now. You guys should go. I’ll stay with him and find out what happened. ‘
‘Gabriel taught me,’ Cas whispered back. ‘He must have known that I… and that Father would see if he tried to read my mind.’
Moody walked away, and John and Sherlock carried on up to Gryffindor Tower. It was warmer in there, so John took off his cloak and draped it over one of the chairs, choosing to lean on it rather than sit on it.
It was horribly warm outside, with only a slight breeze to alleviate it. The leaves on the hedges outside their house had begun to curl and turn brown. John walked down the street, ignoring all the children running around, and giving the ones playing with a hose a wide berth.
Sherlock stayed with them for most of the evening, filling the time by practising the charms he and Cas had come up with for Dean. It proved to be a good distraction for Cas until he started to nod off.
‘I’m losing control, aren’t I?’ he looked around at the other two frantically, both of them wearing grim expressions. ‘The curse isn’t wearing off, it’s getting worse, isn’t it?’
‘He’s not here,’ said John, shoving some chips into his mouth. ‘Gabriel’s over there, though, you could ask him. He pointed his thumb over his shoulder at Gabriel.
'Yeah, I just gotta talk to Professor Dumbledore-' he tried to go around her, but she just stepped into his path.
John and Sherlock were not, in fact, spending quality time together. Sherlock had had a sudden thought during that evening’s DA meeting, and dragged John to the nearest empty classroom as soon as it was over.
‘It’s all right,’ said Sherlock, wiping away the nose-bleed. ‘You’re in my kitchen and it’s August, nineteen ninety-four.’
‘Perhaps,’ said Sherlock. ‘I am good at discerning the facts, but that is all. It’s no secret that I find emotions baffling for the most part, and I suspect being able to understand emotion is a key aspect of it.’
‘Would you like us to clean out your ears for you?’ said George, pulling a long, lethal-looking metal instrument from inside one of his Zonko’s bags. ‘Or any part of your body, really, we’re not fussy where we stick this.’
'Let's go sit down,’ Dean said in his ear, pulling him out to the edge of the room where the tables were. 'You're doing really great,’ Dean said. 'Do you want a drink? I can get one for you.’
John took a small sip of his potion at a time and his had gradually cleared of the screams and pain, though now all he could feel was a bone-deep weariness that made it difficult for him to lift the phial at all.
Once they were gone, the rest of the Weasleys dispersed, leaving Bill, Charlie and Hermione at the table. The rest of the boys took the empty seats.
‘You know what?’ Ron murmured, looking over at the bar with enthusiasm. ‘We could order anything we liked in here. I bet that bloke would sell us anything, he wouldn’t care. I’ve always wanted to try Firewhisky-’
‘It’s bewitched. If a Muggle looks at it, all they see is an old ruin with  sign over the entrance saying DANGER, DO NOT ENTER, UNSAFE.’
There was a crowd of people and cameras waiting on the edge of the woods. They all yelled all at once, but Sherlock pushed past them without answering any of them.
‘Yes, yes, we know about Quidditch,’ Hermione said tensely. ‘Well, the other thing to decide is where we’re going to meet…’
Two whole weeks passed before the subject of teaching came up again. In that time Cas had invited Dean to his Quidditch practice a few more times. He got to watch Cas's skills increase far beyond his natural ability with a broom, and as he became a sharp, decisive Chaser. It was a new colour on Cas, but Dean liked it and couldn't wait to watch his first real match.
‘You don’t need to apologise,’ said Neville, looking up from his book. ‘We all know you can’t help it.’
Dumbledore got to his feet. ‘I have given evidence already on this matter,’ he said. ‘Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater. However, he rejoined our side before Lord Voldemort’s downfall and turned spy for us, at great personal risk. He is now no more Death Eater than I am.’
Fudge said scornfully. ‘Why would there even be Death Eaters about? If there are any left, they’ve all been in hiding for years.’
But then Mr Weasley woke with a start and jumped to his feet, the Cloak slipping to the floor as he yanked his wand from his belt.
‘You received an official notice from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry that it is illegal to use magic away from the school grounds, did you not?’
‘Can I come too?’ Cas asked. His wariness of owls had lessened somewhat over the weekend, but his eyes still flickered upwards every so often.
John groaned. ‘Do you hear that ringing?’ he said, taking the handkerchief that Dumbledore offered him.
‘It wasn’t your job to save him,’ she said quietly, pulling away and looking him in the face. ‘It was everyone who was in charge of that stupid tournament’s job to protect him. Dumbledore’s for hiring that nutcase in the first place.’
‘You went poking around in dark caves looking for giants?’ said Ron, with awed respect in his voice.
'Actually, I haven't,' Hermione said coolly. 'You beat me in our third year - the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject. But I'm not talking about test results, Harry, think about what you've
His eyes were itching by the end of the lesson, but he ignored it, hurrying through dinner and down to the Quidditch pitch.
‘And the year before you lot joined, he managed to get itching powder into Snape’s robes. He was never even a suspect.’
‘It appears so,’ said Sherlock. He could hear the screaming distantly and tried to keep his face impassive. ‘I need water…’ He was passed a jug and goblet. ‘I think he might prefer it if you weren’t all staring at him when he comes out of it.’
Sam's mouth dropped open, ecstatic about their upgrade. 'Let's go, Dean!' he yelled, running into the entrance.
Sherlock had also joined them at their table, in his blue robes. His hair, usually extremely messy, appeared less so, and John squirmed under the gaze of his clear eyes.
'Good afternoon, class,' said Umbridge, once they were all settled in their seats, John slipping through the door at the last moment, still looking quite queasy.
John leaned against the wall heavily. He knew that Voldemort had killed someone and that he was after Harry. He was about to let the vision go when he heard Voldemort begin speaking again.
It worked for a while, until Umbridge looked up over her desk to survey the room and saw Dean sitting there.
‘It matters because we don’t want to draw attention to the fact that Harry’s having visions of things happening hundreds of miles away!’ said Sirius. ‘Do you have any idea what the Ministry would do with that kind of information?’
Fred – Bill, Charlie, Ron – my daughter Ginny. And let’s see, a whole group of friends. Sherlock Holmes and John Watson over here, the Winchester boys, of course, Sam and Dean. And, erm… Cas – Castiel, that’s it! Castiel Edlund, I believe.’
John pushed his bowl of porridge away, no longer hungry, and rested his eyes until he felt Sherlock sit beside him. ‘I don’t know where I was,’ he mumbled.
Tonks demonstrated, by screwing up her face, as though she were straining very hard, and changed her hair from turquoise to a violent purple.
Cas exhaled and went back to his books. 'If we can finish your History of Magic essay today, we should work on - on Potions tomorrow.'
Gabriel hesitated, looking between the twins and Mrs Weasley. ‘Mrs Weasley, your boys really do have incredible minds, which I’m sure you’ll agree.’
Sorry I missed a week, I was in hospital for a little while, but don't worry, everything's fine now! The schedule's back to normal, so I'll see you all again in two weeks.
Welcome back everyone! Thanks to OtakuElf, VegasGranny, hhhellcat, raingingcatz and Novak26 for the comments! See you again next time!
'I wonder what they've brought?' said Mr Weasley, leaning forward in his seat. 'Aaah.' He suddenly whipped off his glasses and polished them hurriedly on his robes. '
Dumbledore considered him for a moment. ‘I’m very sorry, John, but I have to ask you to look again.’
Dean reached into his robes, as did Cas, and passed her their pieces of parchment. Dean noticed Cas put his hand back into his pocket, and could feel his discomfort.
‘Signals are going up,’ said Moody. ‘Get your stuff ready.’ He stumped over to the front door, and waited for the others to join him.
‘No.’ Cas turned back to his breakfast, but didn’t eat much more of it, instead pushing it around with his spoon so Dean would stop talking to him.
The class was tense and silent for the rest of the lesson, and they all hurried out of the door, except John, who trudged after Umbridge to her office. He was followed at a distance by Sherlock, who did not make himself known to Umbridge.
‘Lovely,’ she said again. She snapped her fingers and the wizard with the camera turned and snapped a quick photo of John. ‘That’s everything I need. Thank you.’ Rita put her things back in her handbag and walked away.
A few days after the wand weighing ceremony, John was again late down to breakfast. As he leapt down the last few steps of the staircase, Harry stomped past him, red in the face, closely followed by Hermione.
‘Well, Hagrid,’ Umbridge said loudly, ‘I think I’ve got enough to be getting along with. You will receive the results of your inspection in ten days’ time.’ She bustled from their midst, leaving the Slytherins in fits of laughter.
Sherlock’s, on the other hand, was self-building. All he had to do was unpack it and set it on the ground, then it was up within the blink of an eye.
Dean sat close to Cas while he did his best to eat, and not saying anything when all Cas could manage was a few bites of a solitary piece of toast.
It soared towards them, pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses, all palominos, and each the size of an elephant. It landed with an almighty crash and the horses’ hooves, larger than dinner plates, hit the ground. The door of the carriage bore the Beauxbatons coat of arms, a pair of golden, crossed wands, each emitting three stars. The door opened and a boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage. He bent forwards, fumbled for a moment with something on the carriage floor and unfolded a set of golden steps. He sprang back respectfully, then a shining, high-heeled shoe the size of a child’s sled emerged from the carriage, followed by the largest woman they’d ever seen. The size of the carriage and the horses was immediately explained. As she stepped into the light flooding from the Entrance Hall, she was revealed to have a handsome, olive-skinned face and large, black, liquid-looking eyes. Her hair was drawn back in a shining knob at the base of her neck. She was dressed from head to foot in black satin, and many magnificent opals gleamed at her throat and on her thick fingers.
Moody escorted him from the room, and found Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville and Sherlock waiting outside. Hermione had her hand on Neville’s shoulder, who was looking at her, wide-eyed and horrified.
Hermione was bossier than Cas, but, to her credit, she didn’t pick at Dean as she did with the others. It was a very different style, but Dean found that he appreciated it just as much as Cas’s gentle nudges in the right direction.
‘Really? Awesome!’ Sam dropped some of his parchment on the floor in his excitement, and grabbed a quill and some ink out of his bag. ‘Okay,’ he said. ‘I only have a few questions for now, until I can talk to some other Seers. First of all, how often are you getting organic visions?’
'He says that counter-jinxes are improperly named,' Hermione said promptly. 'He says "counter-jinx" is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable.
Sherlock took a small tub out of his pocket and began rubbing some yellow burn salve on John’s hands. ‘What did you see?’
At his words, John was reminded that he and Mr Crouch were both Ministry officials, and found himself reluctant to demonstrate. It seemed that Sherlock too had realised this, and the two of them remained in the shadowy entrance.
‘He’s going up to the castle with her!’ Hermione said indignantly. ‘I thought he was waiting for us.’
Dean picked up food from the Great Hall again and hurried up to the hospital wing. Cas was already there, sitting with his legs crossed on the furthest bed from the door, bent over a book and a piece of parchment. Before Dean reached Cas, he could tell from the tension in Cas’s shoulders and the tightness in his mouth that he was in a terrible mood.
‘I also think we should have a name,’ she said brightly, her hand still in the air. ‘It would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity, don’t you think?’
The Yule Ball was announced just before the last week of term, but the only one that seemed remotely happy about it was Dean. He immediately asked Katie Bell to go with him, who agreed.
‘We told you to destroy them!’ Mrs Weasley said furiously, holding up what were unmistakeably more Ton-Tongue Toffees. ‘We told you to get rid of the lot! Empty your pockets, go on, both of you!’
He felt as though he was walking in slow motion, his hands began to shake, and he could feel himself sweating. By the time he reached Sherlock, he could hardly speak through the dryness in his throat. ‘Sherlock,’ he said, voice cracking.
They finished their dinner and John stretched. ‘Better go,’ he said. ‘Trelawney’s making me redo my homework. Apparently it wasn’t close to being accurate.’
John and Sherlock stepped forward, and as the heat from the fire washed over them, John felt himself fading again, so Sherlock grabbed hold of him and lowered them both to the ground.
A shallow stone basin lay inside, with odd carvings around the edge; runes and symbols that they didn’t recognise.
A sallow-faced wizard with a short black fringe and an elderly witch with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him, both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps, opened their eyes immediately.
'The hospital wing. I'm just getting some Murtlap essence for Harry, I have a feeling he'll need it.'
It happened immediately. Their feet left the ground and they sped forwards through howling wind and swirling colour, their fingers stuck to the boot as though it was pulling them magnetically forwards, and then-
'How are you about yesterday?' Dean asked while they waited. 'I'm betting it was pretty tough for you.'
'There's a surprise. Just what I get for trying to cheat,' John said, rubbing his eyes. 'Whatever it was, it was hot.'
‘It’s got to be a pretty boring life, hasn’t it, being a hat?’ said Ron. ‘I suppose it spends all year making up the next one.’
‘Blimey, this is heavy,’ Lee Jordan said, lifting it from the table Harry had set it on. ‘Open it, Harry, go on! Let’s just see what’s inside it!’
‘Are we almost ready to go?’ he asked, in a deep, slow voice. Something about him caught John’s attention.
Dean went around repairing the cracks in the walls of the pool, and in the taps, then knelt down beside Cas.
‘Shh!’ Hermione whispered suddenly, pressing her finger to her lips and pointing towards the compartment next to theirs.
‘That’s what I mean! You wouldn’t have needed practice. You’d know what the hell it is you’re meant to be looking at.’
‘Well,’ Angelina said to Harry, pulling off her cloak and throwing it into a corner, ‘we’ve finally replaced you.’
Sherlock led the way through the village, since he was the only one that knew he way. It was very quiet, with little traffic, and the atmosphere compelled the five of them to remain silent as they walked. Soon, they were outside the village and walking through the lanes that ran alongside lush fields and tall trees. The walk itself was quite pleasant and John smiled as they finally came to the house. As soon as he saw it, he knew the Weasleys couldn’t possible live anywhere else.
He was way more forceful with it than he should have been since Sherlock had annoyed him, so the book shot at him. He ducked just in time, and the book smacked the wall behind him, breaking apart. He glared at Sherlock, who gave him a smug smile.
Hagrid pointed to the mug from which he was drinking, one hand still clamped over the steak pressed to his eye.
My Lord, I do not say this out of concern for the boy!’ Wormtail said hastily, voice rising to a squeak. ‘The boy is nothing to me, nothing at all! It is merely that if we were to use another witch or wizard – any wizard – the thing could be done so much more quickly! If you allow me to leave you for a short while – you know that I can disguise myself most effectively – I could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person- ‘
Welcome back everyone! Thanks to hhhelcat for the comment! Hope you all enjoyed it and I'll see you all again soon!
‘Not forever, surely?’ Neville said kindly. ‘You’ll get better once you can control it. And you’ve got Sherlock to help you.’
‘I’ve been saving my pocket money all summer for this,’ said Ron as one of the salesmen approached them. Ron bought himself a dancing shamrock hat and a large green rosette, but he also bought a small figure of Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker. The miniature walked backwards and forwards over Ron’s hand.
‘Tell me something I don’t know,’ John grumbled, sitting up. ‘You think breakfast has started yet? I’m starving.’
Bill and Charlie decided to come and see everyone off at King’s Cross station, but Percy, apologising profusely, said that he needed to get to work.
‘Oh yeah… right y’are, Professor…’ said Hagrid, and he turned and disappeared  into the dark trees, Fang trotting after him.
then spoke over the roar of sound that was filling the stadium. 'Ladies and gentlemen… welcome!' he said, voice booming into every corner of the stands. 'Welcome to the final of the four hundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup!'
‘Sirius knows not to destroy your portrait,’ said Dumbledore. ‘You are to give him the message that Arthur Weasley is gravely injured and that his wife, children, Harry, John and Sherlock will be arriving at his house shortly. Do you understand?’
‘Quite astute of you, Sherlock,’ said Dumbledore. ‘Please do not concern yourself with this. I assure you, Harry is quite safe.’
John saw them leave, surprised that Cas had turned up at all, but soon turned his attention back to Sherlock, standing with Luna on the other side of the room. John had sat down with Molly for a drink, and now they were both watching him.
And moments later, the silver-ringleted witch had reappeared in her picture too. She sank, coughing, into her armchair and said, ‘Yes, they’ve taken him to St Mungo’s, Dumbledore… they carried him past my portrait… he looks bad…’
There were footsteps down the passageway and Hermione and Ginny came into the kitchen, both looking drowsy.
Umbridge pushed past him and stepped up to the side of Cas’s bed. ‘What is the nature of your injury, Mr Edlund?’
What seemed like a huge green and gold comet came zooming across the pitch. It split itself in half and flew across to each of the goalposts. A bright rainbow arched between them, connecting them for a moment before fading again. The two balls came together again in the centre of the pitch, merging to form a huge shamrock.
‘Who’re you writing the novel to, anyway?’ Ron asked Hermione, trying to read her parchment over her shoulder.
Cas took another shuddering breath, shifting himself into a more comfortable position. ‘I wasn’t supposed to come back to school this year,’ he mumbled. ‘G-Gabriel always convinced him to let me come, but - but now he’s gone…’ He pressed his lips together, stalling. ‘I ran away. I shouldn’t have, but I w-wanted to see you.’ He was trying so hard to hold back tears that it was constricting his already hoarse voice. ‘But I couldn’t stay forever. I had to go back and he was so
The four long house tables were filling up under the starless black ceiling, which was just like the sky they could glimpse through the high windows. Candles floated in midair all along the tables, illuminating the silvery ghosts who were dotted around the Hall. If Dean had been paying attention, he would have noticed the stares and whispers being aimed at Harry and John.
‘The moment has come,’ Dumbledore said, smiling around at them. ‘The Triwizard Tournament is about to start. I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring out the casket, just to clarify the procedure that we will be following this year. But firstly, let me introduce, for those who do not know them, Mr Bartemius Crouch, Head of the Department of International Magical Co-operation, and Mr Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports.’
‘Yes, absolutely!’ the witch said excitedly. She grabbed the toad and put her in a tank across the room. ‘Write your address on that bot of parchment and I’ll have her to you by tomorrow evening.’
‘Sorry, let me get that.’ The sales witch said from behind him. The weight was removed and the witch came around to the counter holding an enormous toad in her hands. ‘You don’t happen to want a toad, do you?’ she asked wearily.
'I didn't bother to put it back on when it started to wear off,' Crouch said. 'By then, it was already too late to stop me.' He laughed maniacally, before Sherlock finally collapsed.
John didn’t touch his, he just rested his head on his arm with Sherlock sitting next to him squeezing his hand.
It was a long while before the crowd around the Weasley twins finally dispersed, and even longer before they finished counting their takings from the evening.
‘Actually, I think we will,’ Ginny said, grabbing Hermione’s arm. ‘Come on, Hermione.’ She dragged Hermione out of the room, and they heard them both climbing the stairs with purpose in their steps.
Then he moved on to Hermione, the closest to him. She was sitting in her bedroom, surrounded by books, with
‘Well, I can certainly see why we’re trying to keep them alive,’ Malfoy said sarcastically. ‘Who wouldn’t want pets that can burn, sting and bite all at once?’
Ron made to stuff the robes out of sight, but Malfoy was too quick for him; he seized the sleeve and pulled.
'It's not lame,' Cas said, putting the Quaffle away and Banishing the broom back to his dormitory. 'I think it's endearing.'
‘Why don’t you, Harry and Hermione get some water, then-‘ Mr Weasley handed over the kettle and a couple of saucepans, ‘-and some of us will get some firewood.’
Ron spread his out on the floor near the fire, frowning at how much he had to do, while Hermione watched him with a mixture of concern and amusement, and John and Sherlock just lay together on one of the squashy sofas.
When the day finally arrived, a thick layer of snow blanketed the ground, and they all happily opened their Christmas gifts.
‘Been, yes. Term started two months ago. Another teacher has had to cover your classes. None of your colleagues have been able to give me information as to your whereabouts. You left no address. Where have you been?’
Nearly everyone looked stunned at the news, except Luna, who piped up, ‘Well, that makes sense. After all, Cornelius Fudge has got his own private army.’
John cleared his throat, wondering where to begin. He shuddered as the image of Voldemort flashed through his head.
just so you guys know, I just got a promotion at work. I'll try and keep up my current pace, but I don't know what the workload will be like yet. I'll do as much as I can and hopefully I'll see you again soon!
‘One more curse… my faithful servant at Hogwarts… Harry Potter is as good as mine. It is decided. There will be no more argument, now be quiet. I think I hear Nagini…’
‘Morning, Basil,’ said Mr Weasley, picking up the boot and handing it to the kilted wizard who threw it into a large box of used Portkeys behind him.
The familiar perfume of Professor Trelawney’s classroom filled their nostrils, as they climbed into her circular tower room.
‘Maybe,’ Hermione shrugged, ‘or it’ll have a Muggle-Repelling Charm on it, like the World Cup Stadium. And to keep foreign wizards from finding it, they’ll have made it Unplottable-‘
tell your other you’ve been gambling,’ Mr Weasley implored Fred and George, as they all made their way down the purple-carpeted stairs.
‘Fine, maybe I do miss you,’ he muttered, to the sound of laughter in his head. ‘Shut up, you’re making me look mental. Yes, ha ha, I look mental already, you’re hilarious.’ He leaned back against the brick wall he had sat in front of, and watched the clouds until they started to form shapes. He didn’t know what they meant, and he didn’t bother trying to interpret them. Instead, he just watched until the sun touched the horizon and he finally decided to go home.
‘Magical Congress of the United States of America,’ said Dean. ‘Anyway, let’s see. There are more Weasleys in here than I remember, who haven’t I met?’
'Foul!' echoed Bagman's voice. 'Dimitrov skins Moran – deliberately flying to collide there – it's got to be another penalty – yes, there's the whistle.'
Cas was the first to speak. ‘I’ve always loved the snow,’ he said, crouching down and running his hand through the fresh, sparkling powder, the Whomping Willow just visible in the distance, shivering in the cold.
‘I confess, I was quite shaken myself. The effects of the Imperius Curse are frightening. Of course, I knew about it already, but knowing and seeing are two different things.’
‘So,’ said Hermione, her voice high-pitched again. ‘So… like I was saying… if you want to learn some defence, then we need to work out how we’re going to do it, how often we’re going to meet, where we’re going to-’
‘Ready?’ Hagrid said cheerfully, looking around at the class. ‘Right. Well, I’ve bin savin’ a trip inter the Forest fer yer fifth year. Thought we’d go an’ see these creatures in their natural habitat. Now, what we’re studyin’ today is pretty rare, I reckon I’m probably the on’y person in Britain who’s managed ter train ‘em.’
‘Yeah, look.’ Fred pulled out a sweet in brightly coloured wrapping ‘It’s infused with an Engorgement Charm, so it’ll make the tongue grow. We don’t know exactly how long it’ll get though.’
Dumbledore’s office made John feel odd. So many magical objects strewn about the room made his head spin. He ran his hands through his hair, thinking about what he had seen. It was further in the future than he had ever been before, and Sherlock being blasted across the Great Hall replayed itself in his head over and over again.
Up at the staff table, Filch was adding more chairs, wearing his mouldy old tailcoat in honour of the occasion.
‘Yeah, awesome,’ Dean said distractedly. ‘All right, everybody switch,’ he called out. He moved away from Sam just in time to see Dennis miss Sam completely and hit Parvati Patil instead.
‘No, I don’t feel anything at all. Last time, I could feel that he was annoyed about something, but this is just nothing.’
‘Very well,’ said Madame Maxime, ‘will you please inform zis ‘Agrid zat ze ‘orses drink only single malt whiskey?’
It was a chilly morning, but the skies were clear, a weak sun shining in a pale blue sky. John tried the lake first and stood under the large beech tree. The Durmstrang ship was drifting around slightly with the current. John could just about make out Harry and Hermione walking around on the other side of the lake. He waited a few minutes, then wandered away, further out into the grounds, then sat down, not far from Hagrid’s hut
Sherlock dropped to his knees in front of the sofa and ripped the parchment from his hand, throwing it on the floor away from him.
‘Thanks for your help, Mrs Weasley,’ said John as he, Sherlock, Sam and Dean gathered up their things.
The last owl fluttered out, and Cas let out the breath he had been holding. He spooned some cereal into his mouth and noticed Dean staring at him fondly. ‘What?’
‘A detailed analysis of the ways the planetary movements in the coming month will affect you, with reference to your personal chart,’ she snapped, sounding much more like Professor McGonagall than her usual misty self. ‘I want it ready to hand in next Monday, and no excuses!’
‘She’s trying to make out Hagrid’s some kind of dimwitted troll just because he had a giantess for a mother,’ Hermione continued, ‘and it’s not fair, that really wasn’t a bad lesson - I mean, all right, if it had been the Blast-Ended Skrewts again, but Thestrals are fine - in fact, for Hagrid, they’re really good!’
'I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec-'
‘-I arose, I settled myself before it, and I gazed into its crystalline depths… and what do you think I saw gazing back at me?’
He sat up and rubbed his face tiredly. He knew he wouldn’t be able to get back to sleep for a while, so he quietly shuffled out of bed and tiptoed downstairs. At least he could sit in front of the fire, but when he got down there, he saw Harry asleep at one of the tables, his homework still in front of him, and John was curled up on the sofa, sniffling quietly.
Cas closed his eyes. ‘I made quite an entrance, I imagine the others will want to know what happened.’
some grave peril…' Trelawney pointed a shaking finger at Umbridge who continued to smile blandly, eyebrows raised. 'I am afraid… I am afraid that you are in grave danger!' Trelawney finished dramatically.
