In the midst of one dance, I found myself across from a woman who moved like a cloud in a moonlit sky.  It took me a moment to recognise Sherlock’s mother, although I’m not sure she recognised me.  When her line of dancers swirled towards the windows, she glanced over her shoulder with a subtle and secretive smile.  I looked about and found Sherlock’s father next to me, his raised hands turning with the rhythm and his eyes on the curves of his wife’s figure.  I felt a blush spreading up from my throat.  It was there for any to see: the heat from which Sherlock had been forged and the source of his grace.
They explained that Arthur had been their only child, a tall, fair-haired boy who had always wanted to go to sea and how, at the age of sixteen, he and his cat had done exactly that by joining the Merchant Navy.  After that, they only saw him every year or two, but when he could come home, he always brought them a memento of his travels.  Upon his penultimate visit, he had brought two black-and-white kittens which he’d said were surely sired by his cat, Merlin, on the first mate’s tabby.  Between visits, the occasional letter would reach them from some far-flung port-of-call.
“You took to being sequestered very readily,” he remarked and I saw him counting up signs that he’d missed.  “And you saw things I didn’t think you’d be able to see.  And you’ve learned very fast.”
“And this physical proof lent credence to the more ethereal claims that had been made about their son,” Holmes deduced.
“Woohoo, Sherlock.”  Mrs Hudson appeared on the other side of the garden.  “I’m glad I found you.  Detective Inspector Lestrade said you weren’t answering your phone, so he came over.  He’s in the foyer.  He wouldn’t even go up to the study to sit, he’s so anxious to speak with you.”
His fingers pressed further beneath the denim, chill and insistent.  I lifted my hips and he grasped my buttocks firmly, pushing me deeper into this mouth.
Two silhouettes appeared on the shades over Ms Swann’s bedroom windows, the man still with his cap on.  Ms Swann pushed it up and back until it fell down his back.  Her hand dropped to his shoulder.  She raised her other hand and rested it on his cheek.  They stood like that for a moment or two, then slowly leaned towards one another.  Ms Swann's arms folded around the man’s neck.  She kissed him.
When we were older, it had been cool to swagger close enough to the door to touch the brass knocker and if we sauntered a bit faster once we had, we didn’t call one another on it.  Well, not until we were older still and thoroughly drunk by the time we left the pub on the corner after a game.
Sherlock’s did not.  He had John fast against his chest.  “Can you continue not to look?” he asked when he had the breath.
“Ah, she’s stopped chatting with Reginald.  I’ll just pop over and try my luck.  I ask every year, you know,” Mrs Hudson said and was off.
I watched the muscles of his calf flex.  The stocking landed on the top of the heap of garments and he switched legs.  I caught a glimpse of what hung between his thighs.  The damned shirt tails kept me from seeing more.
John didn’t quite succeed in suppressing a snort.  Behind Sherlock’s mask, a smile flickered and went out.
I drew closer.  Warm air wafted over me, carrying the sound of birdsong and the buzz of insects with it.  Before me stretched the landscape of the stained glass, but for one thing.
Sherlock looked up from the bundle of post he was checking.  “You must be Alan, the neighbour with the row boat.”
“You are henceforth The King’s Pearl.  It is your title and your badge,” Oberon said and motioned to Mycroft.  “A fine conclusion to the matter.  We will announce it at court the next time we have a large assembly.”  He raised a forefinger at Puck.  “Mind you don’t lose it.”
“As a practitioner of the art yourself, surely you appreciate the pitfalls of relying on that,” he admonished with the hint of a smile.
I had checked that night after leaning Murray up against a lamppost because electrifying a fence along a public street was not on and I fully intended to report it, but it had been cold then as well.
The box shone where I had removed the wax and a pleasing aroma rose from the wood.  It was familiar, but I couldn’t name it.
“Oh, James.  You chose your path early and no one could persuade you to change direction.”  She lifted the hem of her robe, stepped over the sputtering border and glided, a few centimetres above the floor, to the centre.  She stared at the thistles beginning to flower beneath her feet. “It was never going to end well for you.”
I was listening to the voice by my ear saying, “Lie down in lavender,” while the confection melted on my tongue.
My gaze followed.  I leaned forward.  There, too, the tiniest dot of light.  I glanced back to the east.  The pinprick was moving.  Northwest.
My face grew hot.  “Yes, yes.  Sorry, Mrs Hudson.”  I kicked a wad of crumpled paper across the landing.  “I just can’t find something.”
It struck me, for a moment, with something akin to snow blindness.  Anyone would agree that Sherlock is pale, but the skin below those tantalising glimpses of his throat he provides, is so fair it is bright.  I rubbed my thumb along the top of the pad I was holding.  I wanted to test that that snowy skin was warm.  It looked cool, like marble.
The paper rustled as he turned it.  “Lloyd George at the Paris Peace Conference,” Sherlock read out, the curiosity plain in his voice.  “There’s a photo.”
He shook his head.  The droplets flew, sizzling on his shoulders.  “I’m too hot.  Sit back down, have some tea, it’ll only be a few more minutes before the last of your rings is done and then I'll cool.”  He tilted the bowl towards me and I saw that what he kneaded with his fingers, gleamed.
“Yes.  Keep beating.  For me.  Keep beating for me.”  I opened my eyes, pushed the matted hair off his brow, rolled him onto his back.
Mycroft tilted his head and raised an eyebrow, managing, due to his position, to direct the expression at both Sherlock and me.
I turned back to the garden.  Mrs Hudson had been right about the lighting being pretty.  Tiny gleams of blue and white and gold twinkled from underneath the foliage and about the fountain, which seemed larger from my new vantage.  I leaned further over the edge and squinted.  I did not recall the statues surrounding it, pairs of them it seemed, clinging to the central column which looked more like a tree to me now with the water gushing from somewhere amidst its branches and dripping down the backs of the statues.
I kept glancing to the side, but without leaning over the parapet all that was visible were the tree tops, mostly the bare oaks' branches with a sprinkling of evergreen here and there.  “Ouch.”  I hopped the next few steps.  “Was that a caldron?”
I hummed at the door leading from the front hallway to the rear of the ground floor.  It’s locked at night.  I’ve meant to ask why, but I always get distracted by the food or the conversation or both.  For a long while now, that hasn’t stopped me.  I’ve become very good at locks.
He completed a figure eight around the table with the wing laid out upon it and the one with the body.  “Anything else?”  He had snapped on gloves and stopped to stare intently at the corpse.
He had completely transformed.  His limbs stretched over John; wings with a greater span than a swan’s and feathers jewelled like a peacock’s tail curved around him.  Sherlock lifted his head.
I awoke refreshed to a room bathed in the pearly light of an overcast day.  I rolled onto my back and stretched; my entire body seemed to feel content with itself.  I glanced at my watch.  The morning was nearly gone, but there had not been much left of the night when I finally went to bed.
“As soon as the last parts of the design are finished, we’ll try.  And if we succeed, I’ll slow down your wheels within wheels.”
I felt colder than before.  I was not sure what he would say.  I knew what I would say should he ask.  I waited, looking out at the stars.
The admiration in Sherlock's expression when he had handed my knife back to me at the dock may have been contributing to my sense of well-being.
In the daylight, I could distinguish her colours:  the blue-grey of her upper feathers, the blush on the pale breast feathers and the intense yellow about her eyes, at the root of her beak and the full length of her clawed feet.  She sidled along the rail, the curl of her talons grasping it securely.
“I did.”  She set down the marbles.  “I’ll get the hoover and when we’ve got this all sorted out, we can have tea and I’ll show you.”
“Mm.”  He stretched over the bench and brushed his hand along the wall.  Several bits of stone fell onto the cushions covering the ledge.  Deftly, he plucked them from their tufts, waving the aromatic flask about as he did.
Baskerville is usually taken for his constitutional after dark, but he didn’t look like he could be patient much longer.
Sherlock glanced back at John for a second.  “That would be one possible explanation,” he said, returning to look through his camera.
I stared at him, pale and beautiful in the grey dawn.  “I’m glad you got to Afghanistan in time.  Both times.”
John stared out the window.  The day was grey and still.  He felt a twinge of what Sherlock felt when London was too quiet.  John teased Sherlock about his boredom, but knew he probably shouldn’t, because he, too, felt the restlessness creep under his skin on quiet days.  He attempted to hide it behind a book or a long walk ending in a glass of whiskey when he returned home.  It never worked; Sherlock always knew.  Fortunately for London, it rarely afflicted them both at the same time.
John had been absent when Sherlock first arrived.  He had made a cursory inspection, took note of the dwindling rose light emanating from the flue, sampled the blooming flowers on the boughs above John’s bed with satisfaction and decamped to the rooftop over the road.  John’s nest without John in it was unsettling.
“He wouldn’t be able to take off again from in here, and I’m not sure the posts are far enough apart for his wings in any event,” Sherlock mused, “and swans don’t engage in combat that often.  Their displays of power are usually sufficiently intimidating to scare other creatures off.”
Accidentally achieved or not, I couldn’t help feeling chuffed.  Who knew I had latent engineering skills.
I should have.  The number of steps I had taken were far more than had been necessary on my previous journeys.
Something cold slithered past my hand.  It was on the hilt of my sword in an instant, sliding the blade from its sheath.  An inky shadow reached into the boat, narrow and questing; its tip tilted upwards as though to scent the air.  It curled towards Sherlock's leg.  My sword hit the edge of the boat's side.  Something heavy fell into the bottom of the boat; the water by its side foamed, redder now.
I stared over the opposite gunwale, dagger in hand.  Several tentacles groped for purchase above the waterline, but failed to find it.  One by one, they fell back into the water.
I breathed in; my eyes opened wider and my nose wrinkled.  Floating corpses were not the worst of it.
“I scanned up and down the road in case he’d somehow sprinted off, but the number of pedestrians would have made that difficult.  There were more folks about than we’ve been seeing lately and no one was shoving people out of the way or weaving around them.  I crossed the road the second I could, which was fairly fast, and looked over the side because that was the only explanation that would seem to account for his sudden absence.”  John pursed his lips and sighed.  “Then I noticed the stairway down to the towpath.”
The manuscript over which I was pouring was primarily a treatise on ailments and injuries of supernatural genesis, although a few of the most common ills that flesh is heir to were covered, too, as well as when the one exacerbated the other.  Each section concluded with one or more recipes for antidotes or other treatments. Their pages had a number of stains on them that spoke of practical usage, and I wondered whether Sherlock’s experimentation had been the cause of some of them.  Lastly, the chapters ended with music to be sung or played during the preparation and administration of the medicines.  Sometimes, the same melody worked for both phases of treatment, others specified different songs.
Kit was one of the few Irregulars who liked to talk over a meal in the kitchen.  He always had a tale of some injured bird or stray cat he had rescued.  The Manor had no rats as far as I could tell and that may well have been Kit’s doing.  One of the bigger boys was his older brother, but I’d never made so bold as to ask him which one.
“He doesn’t often say where he’s been, but occasionally he’ll bring something back and it could be from Singapore or Southampton.  If the case is interesting he doesn’t care how far, but he won’t even go to Mayfair if he doesn’t find it interesting,” she said, sitting down and taking up her tea cup.
“There are preparations to be completed,” Sherlock continued, kneeling over me, a knee to each side of my thighs.  “But at this season, it would be unkind of me not to help you.”
“Mr Rathbourne has offered us his box at the Lyceum tonight.  Apparently, he had not fully expressed his gratitude for our recovering so many of those jewels prior to our trip to the Continent.  He is most pleased that I have returned from the dead so that he can resume doing so.”  Holmes nudged a bowl of grapes closer to me.  “Shall we accept?  Irving, Terry and company are back from a triumphant tour of North America and are playing
“Fragrant," I blurted out.  The memory came back to me with intensity.  I could smell it again.  “The room was fragrant.  Sweet, without being cloying.  A delicate scent.”
“Your nightshirt is in the satchel, along with your razor and toothbrush and fresh linen and hose for the morrow,” Sherlock announced.
I must have been scarlet up to the roots of my hair.  In all the time since, I’d never spoken of the unremitting desire I’d endured during those first weeks.  I didn’t want him to think my passion was only lustful.
A loud chirping made him open it again.  His mate groaned.  He lifted his head and surveyed every angle of the room for the interloping bird making the sound.
I snorted.  “When you said he should contact HR and told Lestrade to get on the phone and ask if anyone named Swann had been among the short-listed applicants for the directorship, there was an immediate improvement in his colour.  Does he know this Swann?”
I was surprised once more, but I extended my right hand, palm down.  Mycroft held his outstretched hand beneath mine, then brought his other up and passed it over mine without touching me.
“Redbeard,” Sherlock replied.  “Best dog that ever sailed the seven seas or the Thames, or the Serpentine, as the case might be.”
He pinched my lip.  I felt it sting afresh and then he kissed the sting away.  “I am not tired now,” he said between kisses.
I sat on the edge of the bench, blinking slowly, my eyes readjusting to the dimness.  I leaned against the wall, the bumps of moonstone in the clay familiar against my back.  Beneath me, the cushions rustled.  I rubbed my hand against the surface beside me.  Soft, dense fur slide past my palm.  I pressed down.  The straw padding beneath the fur rustled again.
, his first and last specimen for Grandfather’s album, and come to understand how permanent death was.
“If a motor accident hadn’t removed our father from our lives, she’d probably have stayed with him until he killed her in one of his rages.  She stayed with him too long as it was.  How sane could she have been?”
I glanced at Sherlock and he looked away from the river to me.  “That’s what it is now.  One of a string of them.”  A faint smile curved his lips, but didn’t brighten his eyes.  “You know where you are, then.”
“Then, the something beneath me pushed upwards, lifting me out of the water with a mighty splash.  The sky roared.  My throat felt as though I shouted, but I could not hear my voice.  There was a flash. For an instant, I saw what buoyed me up. When the darkness returned, the afterimage of the lightning was a faint red ghost upon it.  I could see nothing else, but I could feel the feathered beast beneath me and I locked my arms around its broad chest and pulled my legs from the water.  Its wings rose halfway on either side of me and the red-tinged darkness disappeared.  I felt the heat rising through the feathers, the muscles working the legs and the wide, webbed feet.  The sky bellowed.  I held my breath, waiting for the lightning, hoping it would not hit the water through which we sped.  And then I woke up.  Rain was beating against my windows.  The seagulls were screeching on the canal.”
“God, yes!” I pushed my bum up at him then bit the side of my hand to regain a little control.  “I still want an answer.  I’m not going to forget.”
“She didn’t leave anything in the end.  Said she thought it would be better to give it to you in person after all.”
“No, I imagine there wouldn’t be.  Madeleine is very organised.  I’m sure she had everything that could be arranged in advance all sorted out before she left.  I hope research for the new game is worth uprooting herself like this.”
“Oh,” I said as the dragon launched himself from the crown of my head and landed on the rim of the dish.  “I didn’t know…of course, I suppose, they’d have…”
“Of course not, but I wouldn’t mind sitting down whilst we wait out the next stage.”  We weaved through the crowd.  Guests stepped aside, smiling at us as we passed.
It was hot there, nearly every surface covered with a plate or tray of biscuits or cakes adding their fragrant heat to the air.
All the air went out of me.  I slumped, back against the pile of wood.  I took my glove off and returned my hand to the root.
John looked around the room.  “Last time something was taken from me I was sent away from everything else I knew.  This time, I did it to myself.”
Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver my soul upon the subject, but there was that in the cool, nonchalant air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a liberty.  His great powers, his masterly manner, and the experience which I had had of his many extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossing him.
I almost asked him, but the door was open and he through it before I could speak, so I followed him out to the edge of the roof.  After that, I lost my words for a while.
Sherlock drew several coins out of his pocket, placing three tuppence coins and two pennies on the man's palm.
“Oh, he did do well, didn’t he?” She put her arm around Kit’s shoulder.  “I told you you needn’t be nervous.”
I could feel the cold radiating off him.  “Frostbite?” I asked, feeling the tip of his nose and then his fingers.  “Tingling?”
I hurried to the bed, dropped my towel and dressing gown over its foot, slipped out of my slippers and between the sheets, burrowing under the heavy covers.
“We’ll have to postpone the grand tour until tomorrow, just his rooms will do for tonight,” Sherlock interrupted from the doorway.  “John, I may have to go off with Lestrade to see whatever crime has stymied the combined intellect of New Scotland Yard this time.   Hopefully, whatever it is will be worth the interruption and won’t take too long.”
I adjusted the willow against my shoulder.  Long and heavy as it was, I had found it easier to shoulder it than to continue to pull it over the uneven ground.
I had noticed a woman with a glistening face standing quietly among the applauding throng on the terrace.  I had thought it possible that she was shedding a tear for the recently deceased.
Behind the flap in the cover, there was a packet with one reed left in it and a soiled flannel.  John went to get a glass of water for the reed and an old vest to polish the wood.  He dropped the green flannel in the bin.
Behind me, Sherlock stepped out of the bath.  His reflection glided across the glass, half-hidden by clouds of mist.
She shook her head.  “Not so long before you came to us.”  She took a sip from her tea and set the cup back down.  “Some people step forwards when they step through.  The two of them did.”
“And from that you could know how the coffin-maker felt when his mistress moaned as he made love to her?” John asked.  He raised his hand and touched Sherlock’s cheek.  “Or are you denying that you dreamt of me?”
With every mile we travelled south from Paris, the sky grew bluer.  The passing villages and vineyards basked in the afternoon sun, even the stone taking on a golden hue.  Each station we approached looked like a charming place to disembark.
.   In it, Holmes looked emaciated and weak, and Holmes was certainly never that, not in frame, slim as he was, and certainly not in spirit.  I drew in a long breath.  It whistled out between my clenched teeth.
I hesitated to name myself his lover; it sounded so bold to claim the title, despite all we had done…
Sherlock peered closely, lifted the shirt gently.  He appeared to be waiting for Lestrade to arrive before making a more intrusive examination of the corpse, although perhaps he had seen enough to form a plan.
I darted to the other side, hands ready to explore.  This time it was a knot that depressed when my forefinger slid over it.  I stared into the cavity revealed, stretched my hand into the darkness.  Cool metal met it.  I felt cautiously with my foot and found the first step.
“Not a competent one at any rate.” I tried not to show how very pleased I was to have my usefulness in that regard acknowledged so openly.
He had stumbled in the middle of the stream, banged his knees and an elbow on the submerged tree trunk over which he had fallen.  Sputtering and shivering, he had followed the music to the farther bank, slipping down its steep side twice before scaling it by clinging to the exposed roots his scrabbling hands had found.  At its top, he had peeled off his soggy jacket and trousers, used the inside of the jacket to dry himself then tied it about his waist.
“Good,” I said decisively, but then added, “there were cauldrons for boiling oil up on the parapet."
He waved me away.  “Best not keep him waiting,” he said and followed the taxi driver round to the boot.
John dropped his clothes into the basket outside the bathroom, turned towards his bed, dressing gown loose.  He did not tie it.
John looked up from the open mouths of the waterfowl he was feeding and saw Ms Swann hurrying along the path on the other side of the boating lake.  The rest of the slice of bread he was holding was pulled out of his hand.
“I went to visit them about a month later.  There had been an exchange of visitor’s cards at the end of our gathering in Madame Willow’s parlour, so one afternoon, when a house call brought me to their neighbourhood, I went to see what time had wrought.”
“Or do you already know my name?” John asked, deciding to see where his mind took him.  His recent dreams had been so much nicer than the ones that had plagued him for months.
I gathered up my cloak with one hand, gripped the domed top of the nearer of two bollards for balance and stepped cautiously after him.  Even so, I landed more heavily on the wooden seat than I would have wished, the scabbard scraping the bottom of the boat and the crossbow and quiver thumping against my back.  The skiff dipped and rebounded with my clumsiness.
I stared.  Sherlock had said the creature would defend me, but I couldn’t see the connection between its actions and my well-being at the moment.
I took the flask and sniffed.  It smelled like all the flowers I like, some of which I’m quite sure shouldn’t be ingested, but I took a sip anyway.  I smelt honeysuckle and lilac, lily-of-the-valley…a favourite of my nan’s; a little violet maybe, but above all, rose.  I took another sip and the smells and the tastes converged.  It was every memory of spring condensed on my tongue, rising to my brain, then drifting away.  I wanted them back.  I tipped the flask up and let the brew flow down my throat.  I handed the bottle back empty.
One by one, I changed the places where my clutching hands held the fabric of his jacket and slid along the bench towards the other side of the skiff.  The boat creaked as he shifted his weight.
“Bonfire Night was like this, in the square near our house.  It never bothered me.  We helped make the effigy some years, Harry and I.  She burned my favourite shirt one time.  Swapped it out for the old one we’d put on it together without my noticing until the flames lit it up on top of the bonfire.  That bothered me.  Burning the Guy never did.  Grisly custom that it is.”
“You’ve been discarding strategies that posed too great a risk to me,” I continued.  “You think someone might break the rules and attack before we can dance the dance that could foil them all.”
John nodded thoughtfully, then took another drink of his tea.  “So, you took her case because of the feathers.”
That summer had been strange.  They had gone down early to visit their grandparents.  Father had not come with them.  Mother had been quiet on the train.  He and Harry had squabbled.  Mother had stood up and moved to another seat without saying a word.  That had got their attention.  She had not even looked at them.  He and Harry had fallen silent and the grey-green countryside had rolled past.
She nodded again and picked up another tart.  “Yes.  My parents really appreciated it.  I’d usually find my mother in here.  She was the Manor harpist all my life, until she moved to Australia…now, neither of them is here.”
I spared a quick look, but Mycroft was as I had already seen and I didn’t really care whether he was a centimetre off the floor or a kilometre.  My eyes returned to Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock remained with his head next to mine until I held out a handful of cut plants.  He took them and sat up.
Blue lights flashed, banding the black water and colouring one of the feet of the deceased.  Sherlock pulled me higher on the foreshore.  Lights glowed along the southern shore and the growl of a bus brought my eyes to the familiar, floodlit bridge that spanned the river to the east.
Two attendants emerged from the dimness behind Lestrade.  One fastened Culvert’s hands behind his back, the other bound Culvert’s legs at the ankles.  Lestrade tied a velvet band around Culvert’s mouth, and, drawing a silver dagger, much like my own, from its sheath, cut the bells from the jester’s hat.  One of the attendants collected the bells from the floor.  When he stood, Lestrade nodded and the two shouldered Culvert like a rolled carpet and turned towards the terrace doors.
Sherlock smiled at that and held out his hand.  It was full of berries.  More kinds than I’d noticed when I’d looked in the cap.
For an instant, Fucker looked ecstatic; head thrown back, mouth open, hands paused mid-clap and then he slipped from sight.  I stared at the spot where he’d disappeared beneath the water.  Ripples faded away.
This route had not been my solution.  I had suggested we follow the corridor west that I had seen between the walls of the library and the music room.  I was pretty confident that I had spied the way to re-open the door to the library and it seemed logical that there would be doors to other rooms along the brick-walled hallway I had glimpsed.  My answer had gained an approving nod and Mr Holmes had confirmed that it would have worked.
“I had heard you’d found a green one,” he drawled at Sherlock with a familiarity that brought my hand to the hilt of my dagger.  “But I could hardly believe it.  They are so terribly rare.”  He turned then to look at me much as one might assess a classic car or a racehorse, I supposed.
Even that limited view vanished when Mr Holmes shut the panel that had swivelled to allow us to enter.  The darkness was silent and my eyes and ears were adjusting to both when the room exploded into light and there was a loud noise of astonishment which had come from me.
The path widened.  A wave of speech and song washed over us as the trees gave way to trampled grasses.
I moved a quarter circle from where I had started retracing, heel at right angle to toes, jagged steps for a jagged edge, then stepped carefully between our designs in another line towards the centre, where Sherlock knelt.  Precision under pressure.  It was something I knew how to do, although I usually performed with my hands.  When I reached him, I had created two lines, straight as arrows, or the spokes of a wheel, pulsing green with the light of a glow-worm, a very long one.
I followed his line of sight and saw the patch of tiny daisies growing in the middle of it.  I glanced sideways at Sherlock.
He came back in two with a dead speckled snake in a box.  He dissected it and analysed the venom.  Then he synthesised and concentrated it.
The actor continued his speech, but my memory replaced his words with those Holmes had uttered to me on the night of his remarkable reappearance.  Words spoken as we peered out the dark window of that empty house upon what appeared to be Holmes's own silhouette on the shade of our sitting room.  I had whispered my amazement at his ruse and he had replied, “I trust that age doth not wither nor custom stale my infinite variety.”
Sherlock plucked a white rose from my plate and stood upon the cushioned seat.  “The ferryman’s back,” he said and held a hand out to me.  “Come.  You’ll enjoy watching them leave as much as I always did.”  He took the whole sweet into his mouth, dusted his hand off on his breeches and braced it against the casement.
She glanced at the dish of holly berries on the table.  “They look prettier with leaves tucked in amongst them.  Shall I bring you a few?”
“Things looking a little different from the last time I came down to the apothecary,” I said, looking at nothing but his sinuous movements.  Somewhere near I could hear water.
Sherlock looked down at the serviette, smoothing it over his knee.  “We’d go hunting for treasure together and he was always interested in what I found as much as in what he found.  He’d turn the rock or snail shell or bird’s feather over and sometimes see things I’d missed, like a streak of quartz under some mud or the beetle in the snail shell.  He taught me how to observe carefully, with all the senses.  He had the most wonderful sense of smell.
“I sent one of the Irregulars to Lestrade’s home with a message to pay us a call here in the morning,” Sherlock said.
I slipped the moon blade into my belt.  I wasn’t going to risk its being contaminated by his foul blood.
The pain was ebbing.  My shoulders slumped further.  I felt his knees against mine.  If the chairs had not been positioned so closely, I wondered if I might have slipped onto the floor.
My right hand moved from my side and Sherlock’s brows lowered.  I raised my left hand instead and he lifted his chin.
Baskerville rarely made the climb all the way to the bedrooms to find someone to take him for a walk.  “Ah, Mrs Hudson is off visiting with her neice today, isn’t she?”  I patted him on the head then threw the covers back.  “Have you been out there a while, boy?”
Mrs Hudson held up her hand.  “After Gabriel graduated, Lia moved in with Anji.”  Mrs Hudson pushed two fingers down.  “Then Anji graduated and Keiko moved in with Lia.”  Down went another finger. “They were all younger brothers or sisters of Gabriel’s or Anji’s friends, so I knew them a bit before they moved in.”  She took a breath.  “Then Lia graduated and Isobel took her place, Keiko finished and Fiona moved in with Isobel – I went to their wedding – it was lovely - then the flat was empty for a while and then you came.”  She looked at her hands.  “I may have lost count.  Seven or eight years seems about right.”
“That’s why she was so clever, John.  Basements are where people are unclogging sewage drains and checking gas pipes, storing and shifting crates and tanks.  She chose up here.  Less disruption.”  His light played over the beams and pulleys, ropes and shelves.  “There,” he said and dashed across the floor, grabbing a burlap sack from atop a pile of rough woven cloth on his way.  “Shine your light up here,” he said as he climbed onto a thick coil of rope.
From whence he had plucked it I did not know, but it was a beautiful long curve of wood that felt good in my grip.  It took the strength of both my hands to slip the knot into the nock.  My shoulder ached in protest at the effort.  I ignored it.
“I agree to remain…” I almost had said ‘on base’.  “…for an entire month and to be mindful of your experiments.”
“Excuse you,” he called after the man and spun around, elbows out, the second word still on his lips.
Outside my windows, the day shone brighter than its predecessor and the slant of its beams told me that I had slept even later.  I dressed and went out on the balcony to examine the courtyard by the sunshine that poured down on it.  Baskerville was snuffling along the periphery of the flowerbeds in a leisurely manner, the sunlight bringing out highlights of auburn in his dark coat.  At the nexus of the courtyard’s walkways the fountain played gently, its details clearly visible from my vantage.  They were of the modest proportions and design I recalled from my stroll through the garden, rather than the images I thought I had observed before sleeping.  As I finished my tea, I concluded that the view of it from my windows had been part of my dream rather than something I had actually seen before sleeping.
Sherlock glided closer to John, removed his gloves and lifted the trousers, studied the items left in their pockets, closed his hand about the mobile.  He murmured, set it down on the chest and circled the room, fingers smoothing over surfaces, eyes unaffected by the dark.  He wriggled into crevices, buzzed as he soared to the topmost shelves, stood still when he found the gun.  “Dangerous,” he whispered and smiled.  He stroked the gun, rubbed his forefinger around the curve of the trigger, crawled down the barrel.  “Angry and able to see more than you should.  No wonder you have bad dreams.”
Sherlock had one leg over the railing around the bandstand, but he stopped and lifted the camera again.  “Oh,” he whispered.
Without lifting the teapot lid, Mrs Hudson declared the tea ready.  How she can tell without looking I don’t know, but she’s always right.
Knot undone, I dropped the string and unfolded the brown papers.  No damp had ever reached these.  As I eased the brittle layer off, yellowed cotton wool tumbled down the steps and confirmed that my prize was indeed a long, wooden box.  I dropped the paper beside me and curled my hands around the box's domed lid.  The surface was greasy; someone had waxed it generously before storing it away.  I grabbed a handful of the cotton wool and began to rub the wax off.
So, I returned to my seat amongst the tree stump’s roots, between Sherlock’s long legs, and ate my fill of roasted meat.  And, from time to time, Sherlock would slip a finger between my shirt collar and my throat, and stroke my pulse point.
For two days straight, we danced.  That’s how it seemed anyway.  There were naps and meals in there somewhere.  Every few hours, irresistible food would arrive.  Clearly, I was holding my own as some inexplicable priority in the frenzied kitchen.  We would sit on a couple of the stools along the wall at the firing range and eat off the trays brought to us.  Well, I would eat, and Sherlock would nibble and talk about what constituted a well-executed dance of whatever type we had just been practising.
My dagger was in my hand before I had finished drawing in another tainted breath.  I sliced through seams and ripped linen.  Jaws firmly attached to Sherlock’s shoulder, a glistening, bloated leech wriggled in the air.  A filigree of grey lines was spreading outwards from where it adhered.  It should be too soon for the wound to be necrotising, but the stink of the other leech made me doubt.  Before my eyes, the leech’s hind mouth attached to Sherlock’s flesh.
Sherlock was progressing through the film slowly, almost frame by frame.  The audio had picked up little other than their own conversation, the occasional noise of traffic and the lapping of the water.
“My apologies.  Dean Bradley, allow me to introduce my dear friend and colleague, John Watson,” Sherlock said.  “Doctor Watson, George Bradley, Dean of Westminster.”
Against me, Sherlock began to tremble.  I unhooked my cloak, wrapped it around him and held him to me.
His fingers had returned to their fidgeting, twisting the black medallion dangling from the end of his watch chain back and forth.  I could see that the gold and black band he wore on his left ring finger had writing upon it, but I could not see more than a capital ‘R’ from where I sat.
The heavy stick was set aside, a notebook withdrawn from a coat pocket and set open upon the stone.  Something else was placed beside it which I could not clearly see, a pencil, I supposed.
An image of someone else holding Sherlock’s head down as I was made me choke.   It took me a moment to find my voice again.  “And they cannot have you.”
At the interval, he remarked that I appeared distracted, asked if I was fatigued and wished to leave.  I had shaken my head, unwilling to trust my voice, and we had stayed until both Antony and Cleopatra were dead.
The bedside lamps were unlit.  Other than the ambient light from the hall that I was mainly blocking, the light came from the floor lamp, which he’d moved to the far side of the bed. It poured faintly blue light over his skin and left the rest of that part of the room in shadow.  How well he understands effect.
Sherlock shifted and turned, dragging his fingers along John’s thigh as he rolled.  He stared up at John as he settled back into the mattress.  “I know you’ll always be right behind me.  I sense you there.”
I gazed at the wood.  It was a very big branch, but I shook my head.  “No, I think I should do, but thank you for offering.”
I panted, listing sideways on the cushions.  It wasn’t physically possible, but in my head, I wanted him again, wanted it to somehow go on and on.  “Extraordinary,” I breathed, my eyes on those beautiful, pale lips.
I held my hand over his head, poured more water into my palm.  It dripped through my fingers onto his hair, onto his face.  Red water.  It stained the sheets.
I could hear a bit of a smile in his answer.  “So, there’s a drawbridge and a portcullis down there?”
Once he had, I regretted not having stroked the blade once more before relinquishing it, to catch another glimpse of a Sherlock I could never know.
“What is this exactly?” I dropped my dressing gown on a cushion and unfolded the cloth.  It was light and soft.  Linen, most likely, the shade of green like that of willow leaves.  The single gold line that embellished its borders had an occasional leaf on it.  It was the soul of simplicity compared to the garments I’d worn to the ball.
He covered my hand with his; the tingling reached the crown of my head.  I held steady.  “A glamour wouldn’t work on these.  They require the real thing.”  His gaze lowered to my neck.  “Some volume was lost in transmuting the silver into gold.  He’s a slenderer, denser dragon now.”
I surveyed the guests with him and stopped at the Summer window.  Bert and Wiggins stood before it, clinking their goblets together.  They struck a sweet note, then drained them in one go.
Sherlock was disappearing under the trees, blending with the shadows.  I darted into the woods, picking up speed, heedless of the twigs snapping beneath my feet.  Here a flash of iridescent blue-black in a stray sunbeam betrayed where he’d reached.  There a darker shadow between the trees.  Always ahead.
“We will be right behind, if you would be so kind as to wait until our cab has arrived,” Holmes said.  “There are certain observations I can better make from an external vantage point and there is a stop we need to make along the way.”
John shook his head and held on more firmly.  “I accept your terms,” John said and the weight that lifted off him with that utterance made him wonder if he, too, might fly.  "I accept, Sherlock."  It felt better to repeat it.  "I accept."
My hands were clasped.  Before I could see who he was, my new partner swung me around so that I took his place in the innermost circle.  The music sped up and he rotated counter-clockwise away from me.  When Sherlock looked back, his brow was furrowed.  It cleared my head.  I half-smiled.
"Oh," I said and with a grin went to see into how many parts they had divided the creature and to make sure that none of them were still moving.
When I looked around again, the panel to the passageway was wide open.  I glanced behind me.  Sherlock did not appear to have moved, but I had been concentrating hard on plucking the right notes, so he could have walked across the room and back again without my noticing, I supposed.
“I heard you’ll be going up to Llandin this year,” Mrs Hudson said as she sliced a thick piece of cake.”
“The ones I started having after you began appearing in candle flames and such,” John said.  “When our backs heal, we can try more of those positions you imagined,” he added with a knowing smile.  He rolled onto his side, his hand returning to Sherlock's skin.
It is, with small gestures like this, that we nurture one another in our mutual convalescence of body and mind.  We are neither of us whole, no matter what brave faces we may put on it.
The image of making my way up to the hill alone flashed through my mind.  “With Sherlock,” I said very quickly.
Sherlock changed the angle of his body, gliding in an increasingly tight circle.  Over his shoulder, John saw a distant line of faint grey light.
“Oh, this one grows under the trees at the edge of the sward.  It’s doesn’t like full sun, but too far in and it doesn’t get enough light to flower.  Out over the drawbridge and straight ahead, but in the spring, they don’t bloom this time of year.”
As they watched, the swan opened his wings, rising out of the water far enough that his feet slapped at its surface as he ran forward and then took to the air.  Once aloft, he circled back over the bridge and flew west.
“He was a clever one,” Mrs Turner said.  “Dying in the dark days.  Mrs Hooper and Doctor Molly could bring him up entire.”
“Oh, but this,” she said, pointing to the last item I had added to the list.  This has to be gathered by the light of the full moon.  It also grows near the sward though, not too far into the woods.”  She handed me back the list.  “We’ll just have to make two trips.  Do you have a lot more to add to your list?”
Holmes’s eyes narrowed.  “And these highly unusual circumstances convinced you of the medium’s authenticity?”
I turned to the remaining parcel, grateful for the bracing draught along the floor.  The imperative of sleep was vanishing.
“Soon,” John reassured as he pushed gently.  “Very soon,” John repeated and grasped Sherlock’s hips.
I might have groaned.  I looked back at him.  I’m sure my eyes were black.  He was still on the coffee table.  It was the perfect height.  I might have licked my lips.  It’s an awful tell.
She nodded.  “Old Doctor Hooper.  He got me through measles when I was a wee one.  He only died a couple months ago.  In his nineties, at least, he was.  Kind man, always smiling.  His daughter’s a doctor, too.  Been working at St Bartholomew’s in the morgue for a few years now.”
“If Jim realised he hadn't landed on the floor, he would have been surprised..."  Sherlock strode back towards the centre.  “And he would have needed to improvise…”
She took it from me, tilting it towards the floor lamp to get more light on it and murmuring as she read.  “Most of these are growing up on the roof.  You should have Billy or Archie help you locate them though because they’re all over the place and it would take you too long to find them on your own.”  She started tapping her lips again.  “Ah, this one grows down by the river stairs.  You’d best go out the windows in the ballroom to get there.  They like very wet ground and you may have to search for a while because the swans and the geese like to eat them.”
“I didn’t see anything when I looked over the bannister.  I only heard the two of you talking, but when she stepped into the sitting room, I thought her coat was trimmed in feathers.  When she moved her hands, there seemed to be feathers waving about her cuffs.”
I managed not to shout and refrained from backhanding it; its fangs were too deep in my leg for that to work well.
She lifted her hand away and wiggled her fingers.  “It made playing last night so much easier, but that’s not all.”
I had feet up on the cushions of the window seat once again.  Feet up, head down.  There might have been an interval of light-headedness.  Sherlock might have dragged me over here.
think that Redbeard was a boy, it was just that he had been my companion since I was a baby and he was even more of a brother to me than Mycroft, but, of course, he was just an animal…”  Sherlock spit the word out with derision and started pulling the napkin to bits.
The chill midnight air was a balm on John’s flushed cheeks.  He left his jacket half-open and strode alongside Sherlock, destination undiscussed.  John hummed one of the melodies from the restaurant.
“I would have come to you, wherever you were,” I said, my whisper more intense than a shout.  “However arduous the journey.  I would have come, because with you was where I most wanted to be.”
A moment later, two people with torches emerged from the path and the horse was close behind.  The cart it pulled was small and narrow and garlanded with ivy.  Behind it, Bert and Wiggins brought up the rear.
Judging by the expression on his face, Kit was having similar thoughts as he stood to one side of her, closer to the balustrade.
“And, of course, we have to allow time for you to hear the herders in Tibet and make your own judgement about their music,” Holmes concluded.
He raised an eyebrow at me.  “Ask yourself why you were ready to defend Mrs Hudson and me against what you perceived to be the attack of a ferocious animal?”
The flames were orange and red; they licked and flickered along my veins, too quick to burn, teasing and bright.
“About a month before…you know…Sherlock paid two years’ worth of rent in advance...all of it…not only his share,” she said.
I raised my hand to my nose and smiled.  What soreness our antic pursuit had not inflicted, our later exertions had provided.  I inhaled more deeply and the last grogginess of sleep left me.  I could feel his mouth at my neck, the teasing drag of his teeth over my skin.  I lathered my throat and down my chest.  How well we had celebrated our success.
How he could recognise an individual in the dimness, I could only guess:  his gait, the outline of his raiment?
I felt a draft, fumbled for the covers to pull them up.  They would not move.  One-eyed, I looked over my shoulder.  The darkness curling over the foot of the bed was denser than the shadows in the rest of the room.  The blankets pulled taut on either side of my legs.  The hand on my shoulder was icy.
His arm came up and with one long motion he drew the bow over the strings.  The note was low and melancholy.
“As we approached them, the door was opened and a white-haired servant bowed us into a tastefully-appointed foyer where two ladies of middle years were already waiting.  We apparently completed the party, for we were all led through a curtained archway, down a gas-lit hallway to a high-ceilinged parlour of otherwise moderate dimensions.  Beyond its bay windows a small garden could be vaguely discerned in the deepening twilight.”
I paused at a place where two corridors crossed.  Down one, I could hear the slap of water against stone, a thump, then another, footsteps.  I pressed against the wall as two of the older Irregulars strode past, each with a wooden case balanced on one shoulder.  I glimpsed a word in an alphabet I did not know as they disappeared the way I had come.
As my eyes were shutting, I had half seen a word or perhaps a name on the packages’ wrapping.  There had been a hyphen.  My brain wanted to know more about this name word.  I took a deep breath and told it to never mind.
In front of me, the glassware on the workbench glinted in the light from the hall.  Bunches of dried plants hung from a beam above the workbench, the scents from their faded flowers strong in the closed room.  The wall, from which the workbench was carved, was solid and dark.
I thought he coloured a little at that.  “What did you think I was?”  It was becoming clear that he’d never thought I was entirely human.
The toe of Sherlock’s shoe bumped my heel and I stepped forward.  If his parents were waiting, I supposed that was our first destination.  I walked in that direction and hoped our perfumes were as efficacious as Sherlock claimed.
“And yes…” John said and paused.  He leaned back and waited for Sherlock’s eyes to open again.  “I can, and I do, forgive you.”
Corvus nodded and Sherlock led him away.  I grabbed the satchel from behind the door and followed them out.
I glanced at the sofa and drew in a quick breath.  Since I had last cast my eye that way, Sherlock had freed his right arm from his robe and rolled the sleeve of his vest up to his shoulder.  I hadn’t noticed him move and my peripheral vision is very good, but, as I have remarked before, he is stealthy and proud of it.  He appeared to still be reading from the medical journal.
"She checks the perimeter sometimes, but mainly leaves the area near the riverbank to one of the cubs I mentioned earlier and the heath to the other," he replied, stepping under the spray and raising his arms.  "You wanted to examine my ribs, as I recall."
“Like I said, it’s a frenzy in the kitchen and all over the Manor, really.  There hasn’t been a ball here in years.  Unlucky in the lottery, I guess.  And three days is nothing for what needs to be done.  No choice but to up the pace.  But stay clear of the kitchen if you can.  Mrs Hudson’s using words down there I ain’t never heard.
Sherlock smoothed over the scratches.  “Stitchers look like dragonflies - devil’s darning needles, some call them, but they don’t darn; they stitch.  And when their work needs cleansing, they fly out with it into the rain, the stormier the better.”
The air was colder on the other side, the moon brighter.  Its light revealed a narrow ledge ending in a single course of rough-hewn stones that did not rise above my shin, which appeared to mark the edge of the roof.  I stepped over the threshold.
I kept the statue in sight as I backed away after Greg and Sherlock turned and strode towards the nearest constable.  It may have been a trick of the light, but the sculpture’s eyes seemed to gleam as we retreated.
“It was the least I could do after that,” I said, my tongue darting about my mouth in search of any lingering morsels.
The vaulted ceilings felt as though they were pressing down upon me, although they were well above my head even where they joined the columns bristling with spears and pikes that supported them.  I was not sure I could see the far wall, but along the nearer sections of the side walls I saw all manner of armaments suspended from metal brackets embedded in the stone.  The dimensions of the room reminded me of where we fenced, although it would be a much more complicated matter to duel about so many pillars.  “Are we beneath the ballroom?” I asked, following as Sherlock moved further into the room.
He tugged me up the road by the lead that nominally indicated that I was taking him to the park for a run.  I believe he viewed it as taking me for an outing.  I cannot guess what the man whose face I saw pressed against an upper deck window on the night bus that whooshed past us made of our sortie.  More grist for the Manor legends mill, I suppose.
Yet I could not be certain that such had been his intent and I was loath to misconstrue.  So new was this aspect of our life that no routine had been established, no glossary of terms defined, no signs or signals agreed upon and although I have never considered myself a boorish lover, nor encountered any indication that my former partners had ever thought of me thus, I feared with Holmes that I could misstep and cause a door so recently opened, to be shut and barred.
Walking with an open vessel full of steaming liquid requires concentration.  I stepped off the final riser onto the tiles of the front hall and waited for the liquid to settle.
I couldn’t understand why Sherlock hadn’t dispatched this creature.  Perhaps it wasn’t polite to incinerate guests inside the house.
His eyes crinkled.  “A shampoo, a shave, clean teeth…”  He brushed down his chest.  “Maybe a damp flannel gently applied here and there.”
As well as the paths and shrubs allowed, I was fairly sure I was meandering roughly parallel to Melcombe Street.  The light grew brighter as the moon rose higher and I spied a gate in the perimeter wall.  A jasmine vine climbed over the rounded arch above the gate and three small steps led up to it.  I wondered if there was a terrace outside the walls or a fire escape.  I had no detailed memories of the buildings around the corner, my journeys in the area usually starting from the station and heading towards the park.  I was on the top step in a moment, more than a little surprised at the intensity of my curiosity.  The door possessed an oval peephole, but the mesh covering it was so closely woven that it yielded nothing to my enquiring eye.  I tried the handle and smiled as a latch gave way.  I pushed against the swollen wood and the door swung open.
John stepped on a pile of feathers.  Fleshy wings closed about him.  “Will it be long?” John asked, leaning forward, finding Sherlock’s shoulder.  He felt Sherlock turn.
She left us alone with our refreshments, but before she turned to leave, I saw her hand twitch near Holmes’s head and I think she only just refrained from ruffling his hair.
I plucked the regular pencil I had been using for the crossword out from under the newspaper and drew a right hand.  I didn’t need a reference photo for it either.  I know its length and its language.  I’ve been staring at it and its mate for years.  I drew it palm up under the heart, manicured fingers curving about it, not grasping, just steadying it.  I fit in a couple centimetres of wrist before the paper ran out.  I used the blue end of the pencil on the veins, a touch of pink on the bit of nail that was visible.
“Sure, right,” I said as I dragged the willow through the doorway.  The hall door swung shut behind me, as was the front door before me.  Bolted even.  But the vestibule was empty.
So, I chose another road without so much as giving him a hint of my intentions and I recall the self-satisfaction with which I presented him with my fait accompli.  I had proposed marriage to the first respectable woman who had given me any encouragement and she had accepted with alacrity.  I closed the book.  It was not the roaring waters of Reichenbach that should have haunted me.  I should have dreamt of his long, white hand stretching up and saying, “For me, there still remains the cocaine-bottle.”
“Ones that have been tested,” he answered, nodding.  “Judging by the different degrees of fading, tested repeatedly over decades, although not recently."
I limped towards the stairs and a wave of commuters swept me upwards, clutching my cane with one hand and the handrail with the other.  I was thrust through the barriers, up more stairs, and spewed out into the crowd surging into the station.  I dodged as best I could, my knuckles white around the head of my cane.  The urge to use it for more than lessening the weight on my aching leg was strong.
Had he concluded I had been hallucinating and wanted to see how wildly?  I sighed.  If I had been hallucinating, he should know.  It’s not good to have a doctor who sees things that are not there.  “A winter forest marching towards the horizon,” I said.
Unlike Sherlock and I, some had kept their torches and held them high.  The flickering of their flames shed an unsteady glow over us.  Faces blinked in and out of the existence as they passed.
I dropped my feet to the floor and managed to lift my head without keeling over.  “Debut?” I echoed, which wasn’t at all what I had intended to come out of my mouth.
Sherlock had stepped back fast enough to escape a head butting for which my skull and I were grateful.
Sherlock sat down beside me, his hand still tracing lines and curves across my back.  “The ones above your ears are rather close.”
Chewing appreciatively, I turned to examine the wall which formed the back of the bench on which I sat.  Here and there, the light from the candle flames reflected off something in it.  I ran my hand over the dark surface.  It was rough and dry.  I dusted off my hand and lifted the candle from the small table holding my dinner.  Not far from me, a rounded protuberance gleamed.  Holding the candle closer, I felt about the nodule.  It came away in my hand.
The dog quieted beneath its master’s touch, pressing against his leg, its head raised, mouth open, tongue lolling.  It looked more like a small bear than a dog and I thought of other stories, this time of the highly classified activities that were rumoured to occur at the military base at Baskerville, and I wondered whether my host’s placating tone had been for the beast or for me.
“To a police sketch artist, for example,” Sherlock clarified, “clothing and all.”  He crossed his legs then, settled more comfortably into the plush sofa.
Low in my belly, my body responded to the rhythm of the movements around me and I drew in a sharp breath.
A cloud of fragrance followed me from the bath to my room.  The curtains billowed in the breeze and on my desk the pages of the autopsy report I had been studying, before our steeplechase across Camden, curled away from the file folder in which it was secured.  I seized on it – on its distraction.  I smoothed the brittle paper down, eyes running over the headings.  Near the bottom, there was an annotation I had overlooked.  The writing differed from the back-slanting script of the doctor who had signed and dated the post-mortem examination report.  In pencil, almost faded away, someone had printed ‘blackthorn & wild rose’ next to the entry about the splinters broken off beneath the skin of the deceased’s hands.  Who had made note of the detail was unclear.  I grabbed a sticky note and jotted down yet another theory that might explain the scant facts about this old, cold case Sherlock had given me to study.
“When I reached Baker Street, I left him on the rug by the fire, swaddled in my scarf and sleeping.  Chapalu came up from the kitchen with Mrs Hudson, sniffed him out and they both adopted him there and then,” Sherlock said, unlocking the door with a huge, black key.
“I don’t fade away easily,” Sherlock said.  “I have something of a reputation for being indestructible.” He took a step forward, gripping my hand more tightly.
I glanced at the others.  Wiggins was snapping twigs off a long branch.  Charlie and Archie were having a quiet conversation.  Bert was nearing the fire, Kit in tow with an armful of dead underbrush, Midnight trotting ahead of them both.
With an effort, he got to his feet and walked to the shore of his island.  The music grew louder.  He drank and drank; he hadn’t drunk for days, and the water was very sweet, like music.  He slipped into the water and swam towards the sound.
“If that was a demonstration, I’m afraid I’m not up to the game,” I said, feeling a bit foolish for not having brought a ball or something that he might fetch.  I had not thought to ask anyone, but I was beginning to think that despite his size, Baskerville was a rather young dog.  I cast about for an alternative.  The fragrant, newly-mown grass was free of windblown debris, but away to the left there was a small stand of trees and I hoped a dead branch might be found beneath them.
I pinched the arrow between my thumb and forefinger and flexed my other fingers.  I understood muscles and their functions.  What in my hand could have told him that?
“More’s the pity.”  I tucked the knife in my hand back into my sleeve and bent to pull my silver dagger from the floor.  My serpent took the opportunity to leap onto my shoulder.  A moment later, I felt it coiling about my throat.  “It’s not true, what he said about the poison being in your blood, is it?”
“Then you could not have known that the interrogator’s wife was shagging the coffin-maker at the very time you were telling your interrogator about it,” John concluded.
“Turn your head,” the king said and when Puck obeyed, slipped the long wire of white gold through the hole he found there.  “There,” he said, taking a small mirror from his pocket.  “You may admire it.”
“The fellow dozing against the log over there, despite the fellows on either side of him singing what sounds like a drinking song.”  I nodded towards the group.
“Even those,” I agreed solemnly, then tilted my head to the side and looked at where his kneeling position had caused the legs of his trousers to ride up and expose his slender ankles.  “Only yours, Sherlock,” I added.
John pressed their cocks close, and closer still, skimming his thumb across the heads at the apex of each stroke, clenching his hand at the base on his descent.
I grabbed his jacket and draped it over his shoulders.  “They’re not labelled by blood type and they’re contaminated,” I said.
My hand found its way back to his knee.  The tingling wasn’t as strong as before and I stroked the skin, feeling an odd regret as the sensation ebbed away.  In his hand, the last gold band remained, still unoffered, the chains affixed to it chiming faintly as he flipped it around his fingers.
“I could.  I observe more than most people,” he said, untwining his fingers and pressing their tips together in front of his lips.  “I have enough information to make my decision.”
“But it would only last until they arrived in Hugh Town, unless they were clever enough to preserve their hopeful illusions by making some excuse of seasickness or expense and never putting any of it to the test,” Holmes remarked and began scraping out his pipe into his empty tea cup.
I turned to Sherlock.  Dismissed everything else in the room.  His head and shoulders were bowed.  His hands had dropped to his thighs.
“So, what’s so special about the book, other than it’s old?” I asked, hooking the bag on the corner of a desk chair.
“You must get to know Doctor Watson,” my host said soothingly, stepping past me to the animal’s side.
His shoulders relaxed.  “Yes, well, fairy gold is an illusion, a glamour.  It has its uses, of course, but that’s not what these are.”
She tilted her head downwards, eyes narrowed, as I have so often seen Sherlock do, and looked from Sherlock to me and back.  With an icy fingertip, she tapped my cheek.  “Heal well,
While Sherlock studied the room in the mirrors, I filled a cup with the mead that was flowing from one of the small urns balanced on the shoulders of several naked bacchantes that decorated the silver fountain nearest to me on the table.
“I wondered aloud whether Chalfont Court was built on the foundations of an older building and she said she’d see if Mrs Turner knew anything about that.  She is, apparently, keen on local history.  Very local history.”
Sherlock waved his antennae across John’s skin.  It was growing hotter and flushed.  He bit gently at the other nipple’s edge, more fiercely at the centre and more than once.
The colours in the window before me were mostly shades of blue and violet and grey.  Beneath a stormy sky, a naked youth sat on a rocky outcropping overlooking a lake.  He cradled a lute in his lap.  The glass of his skin was opalescent, that of his wind-tossed curls a nearly-opaque black.  Ravens’ wings sprouted from his sandals, a winged cap rested near to hand.  He was half turned away as though searching the water behind him for something or perhaps waiting for an answering song.
“You know,” she continued, patting her hip.  “It’s been feeling better lately and this isn’t usually the time of year when it does.  I wonder if the melody has been having an effect on its own.”
“You’re getting very good at that melody,” she said as she put the tray down on the coffee table.  "I been enjoying listening to it."
I was not sure his pronouncement was a compliment, but my capillaries seemed to think it was.  “The clarinet at school,” I answered, “and a bit of noodling on my own on a tin whistle someone gave me.”
“Yes, I’ll bring the sketches to the meeting,” she said into it, then paused.  “Yes.  Yes, sure.  Listen, my guests just arrived.  We’ll talk more on Monday before the meeting.  Yes.  No worries.  Enjoy the weekend.  Yeah, you, too.  Bye.”
“Excellent.  This could be an eight, or even better.  John, you’ll be an artist travelling with his model.  You accept commissions for nude portraits upon application from very exclusive clients only.  Anyone who has not heard of you is clearly not in the know,” he said, warming to the idea.  “That should attract the interest of the same people who attract other sorts of attention and the nudity could explain why no one will have seen your portraits displayed in board rooms or drawing rooms.”
“I’ll ask her.  If she does know anything about it, it’s likely attached to some long, family saga.  Her family specialises in long, family sagas.  They have shelves of photo albums and scrap books and diaries going back generations.  They’re thinking to put them online.  They’ve been inspired by your blog, you know, Mrs Turner and her mother.”  She tasted her tea and smiled.  “Ready for a slice of cake?”
“It is, dear, and I have a little information from last night,” she replied, peeking into the kettle.  “Would you like another cup of tea, John?” she called and filled it up.
Corvus nodded.  “How do you know he will be attending the service?” Corvus asked, his wide eyes fixed on Holmes.
And then I stood before him and finished undoing the shirt’s buttons, tugging the soft cloth from the confines of his trousers waistband and opening the buttons on the tails.  I took a steadying breath and spread the halves of the shirt apart.  I saw not a scratch.  I shifted to allow the coloured light to fall directly on his skin; it was not ideal for a medical exam, but the wounds I had glimpsed would not have required strong light to observe.
I raised both my hands.  “What could I make of it?  The Morrows were thoroughly convinced they had their son’s body back and I couldn’t see how anyone could refute their conclusion.  And why would anyone want to?  It gave them some peace of mind to have the mortal remains of their child tucked into the parish graveyard along with his forebears.”
“Whatever process was happening, was happening at a speed faster than that,” Sherlock said.  “It always seemed instantaneous to me as a child.”
“I had wondered, too, whether you’d want to stay in the grove,” he said quietly.  “Whether you’d say yes if I asked you to return with me.”
I rubbed my free hand across my face.  The backs of the rings were hard, cool and very real against my skin.  I peeked between my fingers.  The cloud was still drizzling on him, a warm rain I supposed because he didn’t appear chilled.  His lips were drawn in.  I hadn’t meant to offend him.
She bustled down the hall.  “It can get lonely without Sherlock around,” she said, opening the glass door and hurrying through.  “He takes some of the air away with him when he goes.”
The skewered leech released Sherlock’s flesh and raised its empty maws.  Smoke curled up from them and I thought I heard bells jangling.  When the smoke wafted past me, I gagged.
She ruffled his hair when she turned around with the milk jug.  “I’ll bring them up in a bit, but first I wanted to tell you what I gathered last night, other than that Mrs Turner’s cousin is not very good at bridge, so I’m hoping I don’t get partnered with him again tonight.  Also, he has a marble collection.”
I took a step towards Sherlock and stood very straight.  The closer I am, the taller he seems, but the difference was less pronounced at that moment.  The shoes didn’t have heels; they were more of a glove or a leather sock with ties, but there was a pressure beneath my arches which brought to mind the way Sherlock massages my feet when he feels he has dragged me through London rather longer than my mortal bones can withstand.
“Yes,” he said and I heard the smile in his voice.  “I use them in a number of preparations.  So do Mrs Hudson and Mrs Turner.”
The dancers collapsed, sweating and gasping, wherever they stood, except for Mycroft, who had finally come close enough to be drawn in.  He selected a tree stump, sat down and crossed his legs, smiling.
“Her hands were very soft,” I said aloud, “and she knew our names.  At least no one contradicted her.”  I extended my hand as though to mime our greeting.  “She was motherly, grandmotherly even.  Perhaps in her fifties.  Her hair was light grey and done up with small, silver combs.  Nothing ostentatious.  Demure, I’d say.” I felt my fingertips at my temple.  “But her dress was different.  It was a robe, two robes actually, one of heavier cloth, embroidered wool, I think, over a garment of a lighter fabric, silk probably.  The outer robe was also light grey, like morning mist, and the other turquoise that showed at the neck and on her forearms when the fuller, outer sleeves fell back if she gestured.”
I grabbed his hand, bit my lip and kissed the torn skin.  When I drew away, the scratches were gone.  When I looked up, he winked at me, tilted his head towards the river steps and disappeared behind the urn redolent with spring flowers.
“I'm hoping my niece, Flora, will come back to us.  It was a job interview at Kew Gardens that brought her to London the other day."  Mrs Hudson pulled a cap from her bag.  "They would be lucky to get her.  Flora has several gifts and one of them is a knack for making green things grow.  Just like her grandfather did.”
Sherlock hit pause.  “Note how sharp the other objects in the field are.  The auto-focus was working perfectly.”
I left the bath with an expectation of tea and I was not disappointed.  Accompanying it were several pieces of lemon shortbread and a dish of peeled blood orange sections.  My appetite reared its head at the first whiff of them and there was nothing but rosy juice left on the plate by the time I poured myself a second cup of tea.
“It’s your feast. That’s what you’re responding to; that’s why you’re insatiable.”  His touches were so light they were nearly ticklish.  “This is your season.  It’s your role.”  He grasped me firmly.  “John, they’re all going to want you tonight.”
A nutritional review seemed in order then, probably with Mrs Hudson.  I took the envelope and sat at the table.  “Thank you for the tea this morning.  That was a lovely surprise,” I said as she uncovered dishes.
She gave me a nudge in the direction of the front door.  “Go on, John, you don’t want to lose sight of the others.”
“Shouldn’t Greg be arresting him or something?”  I thought I had glimpsed Lestrade in a black velvet half-mask earlier in the evening.
“Right,” I murmured and poured the steaming liquid from the pot.  Even in the wan light, I could see the tea was red.  It smelled like roses.
If he was offering to model, I did not intend to keep him waiting.  On the lowest bookshelf, I found a large atlas, went into the kitchen and retrieved a big sweet potato.  I am rather fond of them.  I set both on the coffee table, shifted the stack of journals from the chair by the sofa onto the floor.  There were scraps of paper sticking out of several of them.  On another day, they might have piqued my curiosity.  I arranged an end table next to the chair and put my supplies on it.  Lastly, I fetched my rough sketch.
“Come get the hoover and the ladder and I’ll get our tea ready,” she said, turning again towards the stairs.  “I made lemon and poppy seed cake this morning.”
As promised, the door to the study was open.  I halted at the threshold assessing, a habit I doubt I will ever lose.  The lighting was not ideal for my purpose, the evening gloom barely dispelled by the glass-shaded reading lamps set well away from the door.  To my mind, it was more a library than a study, with shelves filled with books and bibelots rising to the high ceilings between the six tall windows overlooking the street and wrapping around other doors and the fireplace on the remaining walls.
