Castiel looks at Sam's back, unsure what to make of the conversation, and questioning his own presence in the room. It's a feeling he knows whenever Sam comes around. Rowena calls it an 'unhealthily close brother bond'.
"It's fine. I just—I was in thoughts. Met an old acquaintance of mine. He'll turn 18 next week."
Castiel blinks at him. "Why? I slept with all my allo partners. Why wouldn't I with you?"
"You could use a cutter for that or simply put it in the dumpster on the back," Dean suggests with a grin, and Castiel blushes. Dean would love to run his thumb over the pink on his cheek and find out how deep it is crawling underneath his collar.
Dean swallows hard. "There'll come a time when he'll realise I'm not what he wants." The silence that follows is heavy with the unspoken confession.
Castiel is a mean little shit, though, and slips the praise in when Dean can't protest, too deep in passion to pull his chain bridge up. Castiel loves how his reddened cheeks grow crimson when he calls Dean beautiful. How his climax enhances when Castiel whispers into his ear how perfect he is. How he squirms underneath him when Castiel tells him, "Come for me, love."
Sam exhales sharply. "You came out to the whole party as ace and took great effort to let everyone know that you take good care of all of your lovers. Sexually."
He watches Dean behind the till, flirting with a customer once more. She leans in. It's obvious that she's interested.
"We only worry about you, chief."
Castiel hugs him closer and nuzzles his neck. "Sure."
The retort comes quick like a shot and Dean is struck speechless for a way too long moment. Castiel starts chuckling.
Castiel can't fall asleep. Dean is quietly snoring above him, his chest rising and falling under his head, his heart beating underneath his ear. Now and then, he hears Charlie moving through the apartment. He hears the birds from the park, the wind rustling the leaves. It's peaceful, perfect. Just like the man holding him. But Castiel's queasy conscience doesn't let him slide into dreamland.
I may add a few timestamps in the future, so feel free to subscribe to the series. 💙💚
Dean presses his face into a pillow and groans. Castiel snuggles closer so that Dean can hide his crimson cheeks on his shoulder. "You looked as if you were enjoying yourself, love. Don't be ashamed."
Right until his eyes fall on his untouched lunch box.
"Hey, I called dibs on that." Castiel raises an eyebrow. That's the second time that Dean refers to marrying him. It's just a quip. He knows that.
Charlie looks at him with sad Bambi eyes. He hates it. She knows exactly what they are doing to him. "You'll see," he says, grabs his phone and keys, and storms out of the apartment.
Dean was right. He feels beaten up. He shrugs his shoes off and falls asleep, still dressed with his blue vest with the name tag 'Steve' attached to it. Dean found it hilarious, even though Castiel wasn't so sure why he made him keep it on. It's factually wrong, and it's not as if the customers addressed him by name.
But that's not how it went, and now he lives in a shared flat with his best friend Charlie, geek and nerd par excellence, and Benny, who is about to move out and in with his girlfriend. Well, better than living on the streets, for sure.
Dean laughed at his own bad imitation of Rowena. The vibrations of Dean's hearty laughs rectified all the crooked paths forged into Castiel's soul. He hadn't laughed freely in what felt like years, even before everything crumbled into dust. But with Dean, he was at ease, his inviting mirth strong enough to pull him in.
Dean grins at Castiel apologetically. "My roomie. She's setting up a board game night. But we need an even number of players. Hey, have you ever played
"Oh, what about it?" he asks, nervous anticipation building up in his chest. A year ago, they kept Christmas simple. None of them had much money to spare, and Castiel's private therapy sessions ate most of it. A thing they thankfully don't need to worry about any longer.
Dean shrugs. "I had business to do."
"Thank you, love. A wonderful man once told me the blue would bring out my eyes."
"Train, huh?" Dean chuckles. "Like a dog?"
Castiel shakes his head. "What makes you ask that?"
He jumps off the bed. "You rescued it?" He flips the box open and takes a stack of cards, neatly separated into bundles. A postcard showing Schloss Neuschwanstein in Germany is on top. He remembers it well. A Spanish girl had sent it to him when she visited it. She was one of the many wonderful people from around the world sending postcards to complete strangers, just to make them happy.
But this is a joyous day, and Castiel is already in conversation with Helen and Bobby again. It's a miracle how Castiel slipped into his circle of friends and family, how they made room for him. Castiel looks so good, happy, belonging. He's truly the best-looking person at this party. His eating and fitness regime is clearly paying off. Looking at his boyfriend, warmth spreads through Dean's stomach and…
"You surely must have ambitions beyond that," Crowley says.
"Um," Dean starts. "I… He told me about his postcard collection. Do you still have it, by any chance, or…?"
It's what Dean feels all of a sudden with Castiel's lips against his neck.
"And I didn't come despite all your efforts," Dean chuckles self-deprecatingly. Right now, he would love to have these lips wrapped around his cock. But he mustn't give in. Castiel isn't a sex toy.
but it would be at least something. Progress. A proof that he is better, no one to pity.
"Fuck!"
"Let's dress you first. The vest might work with your eyes," Dean says and winks at him. He doesn't expect the other man to blush, but a gorgeous pink crawls up Castiel's cheeks. Once more, Dean finds himself staring. He makes a mental note to avoid these eyes as much as possible.
"Thank you for your trust, Dean. That means a lot to me."
for him. But he can't. Because he wants him for cuddles and kisses, hand-holding and heads leant against shoulders, for picnics in the park and movie marathons on the sofa. He doesn't want him sexually, and Dean learnt the hard way that sex is what people think is a true sign of love.
Castiel shrugs. "I thought… I thought if I do this for you, then you wouldn't have to use sex toys anymore."
Dean fidgets with the paper napkin before he runs it over his mouth. Castiel finds his nervousness endearing. He has seen Dean flirt easily with women everywhere, but here he is, cheeks burning crimson, unable to meet his eyes.
Dean hits the breaks and shouts at the man who stepped in front of his car without looking. "Sorry, Sam. You said what?"
Dean is still catching up on what she just said. "People can be asexual as in not being interested in sex?"
"...and a good friend. Yada yada. I don't want to be strong, Cass. Or a
"Dean," Castiel tries to calm him.
"Yeah, no. Just a scrape. He needs to blow off some steam. He'll come around."
"You're tired. Let's curl up in bed and sleep." Castiel stretches out a hand, looking pleadingly at him. Dean doesn't want anything more than doing just that, being held by these arms for a last time. But he's been selfish for far too long.
It's a farce, really. What he used to welcome in the past, he wishes wouldn't happen anymore. Lisa had called it their lucky days, those times when Dean's erection didn't flag as soon as she 'tried to make him feel good'. The days when he got hard before she requested sex were few and far between. It's the first time that it's happening with Castiel. Castiel, who is very happy to never have to deal with sex shit ever again.
"Told you my hot dogs are the best," Dean says through a mouthful of food.
Dean shakes his head. "The couch is crap, buddy. But you could sleep with me." He blushes the moment the words leave his mouth. "I mean, in my bed with me, as—as in sharing."
The turn of a key in the front door announces Charlie's arrival, and Castiel calls out for her after he’s covered Dean with a blanket.
As soon as dinner is done, Dean excuses himself and flees to the hotel. A real one that Sam was kind enough to pay. It makes Dean feel only smaller and not good enough.
Dean curses himself. He never thought about Castiel's side of the equation. He was way too happy to have such a loving, caring man on his side. Castiel already put so much effort into the relationship, high time for Dean to do the same.
He had to sleep on the couch in the communal area, but he couldn't tell Dean that either. Or that he had looked up to the balcony of his flat from the park, wondering if he could just ring the bell, but then decided against it.
They enter the Gas-N-Sip together, Dean holding the door open for who he assumes is a customer. He wakes up a little when he receives a tender, close-lipped smile in return. It's sweet as honey, and Castiel's blue eyes light up together with his whole face. Dean realises that they stared at each other just a bit too long and shakes himself out of it. He returns a soft smile before turning his attention to the shop.
Dean hates how small his soon-to-be-ex sounds. "No. It's me."
"Did Dean tell you where he's taking us tonight?" Sam asks, ripping Castiel out of his thoughts.
"I needed time to think, and I don't want him to be my nurse." Dean takes a slug from his cola bottle.
She chuckles. It sounds forced. "Well, you two danced around each other for years."
Castiel's smile falters a little. "Better now."
"I'm just…" Dean groans.
Dean did everything in his power to get him so far and he can't bring himself to regret it. But he's still angry. Maybe he is anger, plain and simple. He's been angry since his mother died and his father gave a shit about giving his sons a home. This anger will probably never go away. It's good that Sam found happiness, Dean muses. At least one of them should.
As soon as Castiel sinks down on him, Dean closes his eyes. He knows that watching someone pleasuring him is a sure way to lose his erection.
Castiel is always so careful with him. Dean loves to unleash the dragon, though, to make his boyfriend lose his constraints. Castiel once told him that he never had the chance to show this part of himself in past relationships. Maybe Dean is a bit smug about it. Sue him.
Charlie gets up from the sofa, steps into Dean's way, and cups his shoulders, holding him in place. "There are couples that make it work. Some find ways to meet in the middle, some cut sex out of their lives, others have open relationships."
Dean watches in awe how his boyfriend starts glowing as he talks. Castiel is always beautiful but like this? He's radiant.
Two pairs of eyes move to the tall men and back to Dean.
"How bad was it?"
There is a long pause and then comes, "Dean?" This gravelly voice doesn't fail to move him. If Dean didn't decide to scratch the term 'witch' for his future sister-in-law, he would wonder if her stepbrother might be a witcher, too.
"For what? You've got everything you need!" Dean all but yells.
Castiel nuzzles his nose into the crook of Dean's neck, relishes the warmth and the scent of his boyfriend. It all happened so fast. Has it really only been a month?
"I forgot to take Lisa off the mailing list."
"I met your boyfriend. A handsome and lovely fella."
"That's one way to put it." Dean chuckles. "So, ever worked in retail?" Castiel shakes his head.
"That's impossible. And maybe it fades when it's finally taken care of."
Dean turns his head and looks at him, dumbfounded. "You do?"
Castiel chuckles without mirth. "Crappy."
"It sounds so easy when you put it that way."
Dean puts his jacket on the coat rack and walks quietly into the open living space. He can barely see his boyfriend's silhouette in the dim light.
Castiel leans against the kitchen cabinets and regards him for a long, painful moment. "You said you didn't want to lay anyone. That was… a surprise, as I had the impression you rather enjoyed sleeping with me. But I was delusional, I suppose."
"Even though they are one of the most dangerous dog breeds, in the right hands they are great family pets. You might be onto something," Castiel quips.
"But I need you. I need to feel you, babe."
Because that's what Dean is for him first and foremost. Love. Strong and burning, gentle and caring. Castiel adores the softness of Dean's stomach as much as the strength of his arms, the fierceness of his kisses just like the reverent brushing of his fingertips. But he keeps these thoughts to himself, knowing they'd be too much for Dean to hear. His boyfriend can process his deeds much better than his words, and that's okay. They'll get there eventually.
There will be fences to mend, texts with apologies and explanations to send. But they can wait. Now, Dean needs to feel that he and Castiel are truly good.
Dean hums. "You gonna bake today?"
let this happen between them. Never.
It's a weakness to crave it, though.
She shrugs. "I know nearly everyone in this room. And the only two men Sam ever mentioned were his brother and Bobby who I assume is the fella over there."
Dean chuckles. "Yeah. You can say that. I mean, it can be nice under the right circumstances."
"Where's Cass?" Dean asks, and Castiel's heart threatens to beat out of his chest. Sam steps to the side, and Dean's face lights up before it turns grim after a second. "Why am I here?"
Castiel runs his thumb over the scruff on Dean's cheek and his boyfriend leans into the touch, eyes falling closed, just like a smoochy cat. Castiel hums in agreement. Dean is sleeping way better after their night shifts since they've been together. But it's still not easy to get back into the rhythm after having a day off.
"Have you been drinking since our talk?"
to fat bumblebees. That's his job. He would get into a fight if anyone would say the same shit to his angel, though.
Dean shrugs. "Maybe."
Dean purses his lips. She's his best friend. He should be able to talk with her about shit like this. He has carried this secret so long with him. It would be nice to share the burden for once.
"Sure. Are we on for game night?"
Castiel chuckles. "You had two girlfriends. That's not a lot of mothers to sweet-talk."
"Yes," Castiel says cautiously. "I come from money, and I earnt well in the past. But this here—" he gestures to the Roadhouse, "is more than I have dreamt of for two very long years, Dean. And you are more than I have ever dreamt of in my
"And your mother didn't suspect anything?"
"Cass and I had a fight."
Castiel sighs quietly. He wishes he wouldn't be so uneasy with his own body. But it's hard when it doesn't react as it should. He can't trust his body to do the right things because it doesn't when it counts, namely in matters of the heart.
"No!" Dean answers. It's not that Castiel expected him to be happy to meet his stuck-up family, but the sheer force of this single word throws him off big time. Not even a moment of consideration. Castiel had hoped that he would be worth more than a two-letter answer.
Castiel stares at him as if he had never heard anything more ridiculous. "Of course you do."
"I'm really sorry."
Castiel smiles at her and brushes her tears away. "I'm happy to see you, too."
Castiel raises an eyebrow at the word and shows no sign that he got the movie reference. It's not the first time he reacts so obliviously. Dean shakes his head and huffs a laugh.
"What did you have for lunch?" he inquires.
"Yes. Just give me a second to cool off."
It's dry and clean and – most importantly – free. His paycheck won't bring him far. But it's a first step back to normality. He won't complain. He brought it all on himself. He and his stupid dick.
"I've had worse. How long did your party go on?"
"I shouldn't get hard. This is…" He fidgets with the bottom sheet and stares at the ceiling. He doesn't deserve that Castiel tucks his naked body tenderly in, covering up his once more non-cooperative dick.
And so he leans his head on Dean's as they drive through the night, raindrops painting gentle patterns on the windows. And Castiel is content. His grace sings like creation itself. It's peaceful and calm, soulful and warm. It's loving Dean, and seeing this love reflected, not in words, but in looks and gestures. It's loving Dean how he lets himself be loved, not in words, but in looks and gestures.
Dean sighs exasperatedly. "Charles, if you didn't fill up the engine oil when I told you, I swear…"
Dean smiles. "Yes, we are."
He's 38. He shouldn't act like a teenager whose crush just called them pretty.
Dean swallows hard and runs a hand over his face. "What happened last night?"
Castiel's glee slips off his face. "And I am the only one currently working there who has the commercial education to run a business," he bites.
"I'm proud of you that you came out to us. It must have been hard to keep this part of you bottled up. I'm sorry that it happened in a way you couldn't really control. We tried to shut you up, but…"
Dean frowns at him. "You still have more than an hour!"
Castiel's head is swimming, just like his gaze. He can't even stop crying when someone else is sitting down next to him.
"Dean, what's going on?" he asks, running a hand over his eyes.
The term is so new to him that it fills Dean with equal parts of dread and joyful anticipation.
"Doesn't sound too bad if you ask me. Unless she got you hooked on the booze as a kid as my old man did."
He has a boyfriend now. A man who many will envy him for. He already hears Gabriel's sexually suggestive comments, Hannah's warnings to take it slow, and Missouri's pep talk that he deserves to be loved. She may be his social worker, but that woman can read minds, and she speaks her own openly.
The young man straightens and beams at him. "Great, sir."
When they pass the estate's gate, Castiel breathes a sigh of relief. "That wasn't as bad as I thought it would be."
Sam squeezes his shoulder. "You could move here, Dean."
Castiel slows down his chewing. Time stretches until he swallows the bite. Unlike his boyfriend, he knows not to speak with a full mouth.
Dean clicks the ring box open. He hopes that Cassie is happy with whatever bastard is blessed enough to have her at his side. She still holds a special place in Dean's heart. And he loves that he can talk about her with Castiel, that there is no jealousy, just happiness that Dean once had someone who loved him, and grief that it wasn't meant to be.
"Me, too."
"I heard that, Sammy," Dean mumbles. "Leave my boyfriend alone. You have a mead delivery to take care of."
Castiel chuckles into the next kiss. "I'd think you were possessed if you ever swore off burgers."
Dean cards a hand through his hair. "I fell in love with the man you are now, Cass. I don't care where you're coming from. It's—a lot. I mean, I grew up in shitty motels and on the backseat of the Impala. But you're not judging me for that, are you?"
Dean's head flies around. "Whatcha talkin' about man? Why would I break up with you?"
"Castiel?"
"Are… are you happy?"
Castiel turns his head, just enough for Dean to be able to see the soft yet forced smile.
"Mind if I put these on the fridge?" He holds up the photographs and the drawing with a questioning, vulnerable look.
Dean deflates in the face of a deadline. "I really like him, Charlie."
"Hey, no one could know that he wasn't sick," Sam says and squeezes his shoulder. Castiel won't cry. Dean is okay. The doctors said so.
"Not really," Dean says, well knowing that he has lost this round, no matter what game they're playing.
“Sam,” Dean says again, chest pounding now, because, because -
Dean’s lung momentarily cease to function, before he remembers he's here to return a favour. To hash out the situation with Cas’ father until Cas knows what he wants to do, and that's it. He's not here for an explanation or a resolution to the tangled mess of their relationship. He’s not here for anything else. Not a damn thing.

“Sorry sir,” Dean drawls, continuing to tip his chair back onto two legs because he gets a certain sense of satisfaction from
He's never met anyone like Castiel. Weird and intense and… And nice enough to offer him an olive branch and honest enough to tell him the only reason he's doing it is because he's lonely and Dean's the only shot he's got.
“Where?” Cas asks. His bed head is flattened on one side with a pink pillow crease along his cheek. He has morning breath and hogs too much of the coffee and is just as grumpy as Dean when woken early.
When the sun starts to slant golden over Cas’ face they grab something to eat and pull into a motel for the night.
“Dean,” his voice comes out softer now, and his hand settles on his shoulder. It is firm and grounding and ushers heat down into the very core of him, pushing back against the cold. Dean is overcome by something like Grace. “I found you and I was yours. And you were mine.”
And maybe Dean did too.
And Dean realizes something.
I love you,
The final battle of their lives, a cosmic finish line to their entire existences.
Defeating Chuck had taken. And taken. It tore away all that made Cas an Angel; his grace, his wings, his feathers. The only place for him in Heaven now was his own world of memories and Jack, who was taking care of business but always made time to come visit his human family. He was left human and broken and bleeding but
But what there still is, is the feeling that someone he knows and who knows him is walking through the door.
“I’m so sorry I couldn’t save you.”
It had taken everything.
Dean lowers his head into his hands, like he did in the After. Sitting on the floor of that room and unable to move, unable to pick up the phone. Unable to do anything except give in to the wrenching sobs that rise up from his chest.
Cas just gives a soft huff, his laugh, and softly nudges his nose against Dean’s before backing off. Still smiling.
“Did you just - Cas, did you just
It’s like a prayer. Because someone should know. The world around him, the universe itself. Someone needs to know that Castiel was loved.

buying into that way of thinking makes his chest ache.
“Noted,” Dean says, “Was gonna kiss you before I totalled your phone.”
Last time Dean saw him was at his damnable bachelor party and then he had been flushed, a little dishevelled and fucking furious. They had a couple of conversations after that, but they were tense and curt, with Dean’s threat that he wasn’t going to come to the wedding hanging over them. All by text message. Dean had wanted to reread them, but Alastair had taken his phone six months after that and by the time he got his phone back, he was too saturated with everything else to consider it.

His hands are shaking. He’s messed the drink up enough that even Charlie won’t drink it, given its just vodka, rum and double the amount of gin it’s supposed to have, so he gulps most of it down instead. It’s awful and definitely would get him in the crapper if there was anyone here with the power to fire him.

“Hello Castiel,” Hester says, “Is there a reason we’re discussing your virginity?”
“I,” Dean begins, pausing before he beheads the squash with much more enthusiasm than when he usually chops up vegetables. “No,” He finishes, in what is possibly the least convincing attempt at shaming being in a good head space since the incident where Castiel met Sam and Jess at Trickster Cafe when they both believed he was a woman. “No.”

“Uh,” Dean says, not looking up from where he is frantically chopping up the marrow Castiel is quite sure was not in the fridge when Castiel went to bed last night. In fact, he doesn’t remember most of these groceries being in their apartment, which means that Dean has been awake long enough both to cook enough to fulfil an entire service worth of orders, and to go to the shops to buy the ingredients. “Hey.”
expression that he’s been well acquainted with over the years.
“Yeah,” Dean exhales, “It’s probably always gonna goddamn matter, but it doesn’t --- it doesn’t matter as much as
“Hmm. I help at Gabriel’s cafe, mostly. Not cooking,” Cas says, watching him carefully, “I am a terrible cook. I can, however, draw genitalia on latte foam, which is highly transferable skill.” He really, really, doesn’t meant to laugh again, but his delivery is just… too goddamn good. “And I write things.”
“No, they called me into the soup kitchen.”
It’s pretty domestic and fucking wonderful, considering that at the beginning of this trip Dean didn’t really know how to navigate a conversation with the guy without stepping on a landmine.
“Dean,” Castiel says, evenly, “What is this?”
“Dean,”
“Let’s talk some more about free will,” Castiel says, folding his hands together.
“Good,” Dean says, heading to the kitchen to swipe himself a beer, to find Sam still sat on the sofa staring with his shoulders clenched, poised to say
“Pinky promise, Claire bear,” Dean says, letting go of her hand to hook their fingers together and smile at her, dumbly. “You’re probably best asking Sam about the details.”
. It wasn’t brave, Dean. I told you because I was scared.”
could be presented with a job offer to take over and put Hannah in place as interim MP for long enough to change the bylaws, which resulted in Gabriel showing up on some random Tuesday with a ‘formal job offer from the board’ which had Cas blinking at him in something that looked a lot like disbelief. Now, Hannah is still in charge and killing it and any home improvements have to go to democratic vote of Miltons, which is why Castiel gets prissy at least once a week about things like ‘request for approval of a new coffee machine’. Still, Gabriel had heard that Michael was intending to purchase land in the surrounding area and turn it into a hotel resort and spa, so now Gabriel owns three of the neighbouring properties and Dean has been more convinced than ever that his family is pretty freaking simple, in comparison).
After Sam’s hung up, Dean scratches at the groove in the wood and exhales. He carved it there because he wanted some permanent record of the summers they spent here, and now Castiel lives in his apartment. They’re permanent now. Dean’s damned sure about that.
“Dean, are you sure---” Sam beings and Dean
(‘You like to be needed’ Cas said once, on the drive to Sioux Falls, and he does. He doesn’t like to be irrelevant.
“Yeah, Dean says, “Hannah is…”
, you will lose out, Dean. Telling someone that you love them is an incredible privilege.”
“What time are you off shift?” Castiel ask and the question’s almost too straight laced to be a come on. It’s Cas eyes that totally give him away because, yeah, Cas is definitely undressing him with his eyes. Only totally seriously and practically, cause he totally seems the type. Damn.
Castiel sleeps over at Dean's after every joint shift, and he has woken up more than once to Dean's morning wood pressing somewhere against his body. Dean, the perfect gentleman that he is, always rolled away as soon as he was awake enough to register it.
It's just a bug that Charlie put in his ear. He's not drinking
"Oh, crap, the one with the murderer?"
Castiel blushes.
Castiel laughs and the sound vibrates into Dean's heart, churning it in delicious ways. "You looked as if you were out to kill someone."
are," Castiel corrects. Michael rolls his eyes. "Don't think your job is more secure just because you worked longer here, Michael. The kid deserves to be addressed with their right pronouns."
"You destroyed my marriage."
"I'm beat. Let's get some sleep."
"Hey. Next time, you'll pay. No biggie."
Dean himself has even picked up cooking now, besides greasy breakfast staples. He hasn't eaten ramen for weeks. No, that's not true. Castiel showed him what the real deal is. Dean promised to never touch the instant stuff again.
Castiel rubs his hands over his jeans. "No. I haven't played any board game since
He props himself up on the roof terrace's balustrade and tries to sort through all his contradicting feelings. He hates it. It's all him. His fear to be left behind, for the only constant in his life to leave, like everybody else who has ever meant something to him. He's jealous and the realisation hits him hard.
Castiel nods. "All taken care of."
"Wake up, angel. We're there, sleeping beauty."
Charlie looks at him. "It's surely not that bad." She doesn't sound as if she believes her own words. "I mean, he didn't drink that much, did he? He barely had hangovers."
"What is in the box?" he finally asks.
"Maybe I shouldn't—what do you mean he's scared?"
It's not that Dean doesn't like Castiel. It is more of an I-swear-on-my-mother's-grave-I'll-kill-him kinda relationship. Because the thing is, Castiel set up Dean's little brother Sam and his stepsister Rowena and it isn't that Dean could say it out loud, but he is worried. To say the least.
Dean opens the door and looks at Castiel who opens his arms to embrace him. Dean shakes his head in amusement. "You're such a dork," he chuckles.
Take care! 💚💙
"Mmh. This is good. You made the dumplings yourself?" Castiel nods. "You're spoiling me, angel."
The angel looks out of the window and up to the night sky. He has seen the stars come into existence and still, their light was never as radiant as Dean's soul, never as burning as Castiel's love, and never as steady as the bond between them.
Dean huffs a laugh. It's wet and sounds ugly. "You're making fun of me."
"What?"
It's a rare occasion, and Castiel cherishes it. The blue-tinted night, Baby's rumbling engine, and Dean's head lying on his shoulder.
But what a month it has been. Instant attraction that he has never felt like this before. Secrets, revelations, their coming outs. And now, they will share a flat with Charlie. It's fast. Maybe too fast. But this time is different. Dean knows him.
He returns to the living room where the others have moved back to the sitting area again. He looks at the only empty spot next to Benny and decides to call it a day. The other's protest, but Dean just stares at him with an unreadable look on his face. He sees Castiel to the door.
"That's not far from us." Dean smirks. "We're living in the yellow house on Park Street."
Dean shakes his head. "There's nothing to explain. You promised me to give up fasting. I thought you understood how worried I was about it, because the way you did it wasn't healthy anymore. I could live with you skipping breakfast and going for a run instead, because I assumed you'd eat at work."
"Missouri isn't my roommate," he confesses.
He presses the palms of his hands against his eyes, hoping to force back the sting of tears building up in them. A warm hand lands on his shoulder, startling him. "You've done well."
Dean leans with his arms on Baby's roof and watches the reunion with a soft smile. Castiel looks as awkward as always when he hugs people, but Hannah doesn't seem to mind. She squeezes the air out of her brother's lungs.
"You don't seem uneducated, Dean," Hannah says.
“You’ll get your answer, Cas, I just find a little weird talking about my brother, butt naked in your front room.”
“Awesome,” Dean says, slumping down on the edge of their bed and picking up his journal, idly flicking through the pages until he stumbles across the words
“Cold,” Dean throws back, “You gonna tell me where we’re going or I gotta guess?”
?” Dean says, sounding a little hysterical, because it’s
soon, and the time between Dean arriving back at his apartment and Cas needing to be buzzed into his apartment block is enough to have him
It doesn’t matter that they run, holding hands, back up to the house to try and get out of the downpour, they still wind up with their clothes plastered to their skin, Cas’s book more or less ruined, drenched to the bone.
“Figured that you like it and you're marrying me some day, so clearly you have outstanding taste, so maybe I'd give it another shot.”
“Give yourself some time,”
“Yep.”
“Is Gabe there?” Dean asks, “Hey -
“Fine,” Cas says, the undercurrent of some sarcastic comeback being bitten back in the word. It’s not quite passive aggressive, but it still makes his stomach flip over. This rejecting help stuff isn’t
“Dean,” his voice is gravel and steel. As firm and righteous as he ever was as an Angel. Cas will always hold Dean’s name safe in his mouth.*
“I’m sorry, Cas,” he whispers into the empty air. Not quite a prayer, because can it count as a prayer if it’s just him, speaking out into the empty space between where no one can hear him.
They both stay.
And Dean knows.
They still haven’t talked about it.
He waits for the thunder, the rattling.
But eventually Dean starts to recognize the pattern.
Dean knows there will be more lines, years he will get to see.
When Dean cradled Cas’ living human body to his chest he couldn’t thank God, but he found himself whispering
The singer croons, low and melancholy, but with something like hope on his mind.
Castiel walks towards him, just as steady and sure as the first time he ever laid eyes on him. The real first time. When he had been a howling, twisted thing off the rack, and an Angel had looked at him and laid a hand on his shoulder and he’d known, he’d just known, he was meant to be saved.
But the question Cas asked was this, “Will you stay?”
But when he looks again, Cas is smiling, and it’s a quiet, comfortable thing.
And that’s how he died, saving Dean.
Neither of them spoke for a moment. He let the words sink in. Dean nodded, took a swig of his beer. Set it down on the table with a soft thud.
And it should have been him. It should have been him who went. Of all of them, Cas deserved to be saved.
In the morning Cas will watch the sky, with a hand that threads in his own in a perfect fit. Like it was always there. Always will be.
Cas loved him.
So Dean reaches over and takes his hand. The one Cas was resting on his thigh, idly drumming along to the music. So very human.
All along, it had been about saving him, hadn’t it? Everything Cas ever did, all he sacrificed.
over and over into the crook of his shoulder just the same.
But he can still feel the hollow in his chest, that’s been growing and growing. Some day it will consume him. The emptiness inside him. And this kind of empty isn’t from the trauma, the guilt, that gnawing, carving thing he’d carried within him out of Hell. This emptiness has a root, a root of black that stretches and twists through him.
And the answer will come.
An old folk song is playing on the radio. Dean makes no move to change it.
And Dean knows.
Because Cas loves him too.
Looking over, Dean sees Cas’ hair whipping up in the breeze like a tangle of feathers. Kind of how it used to look, so many years ago.
He doesn’t sleep much these days.
They break a part for air without really needing it. Just letting the kiss settle deep into their bones for a moment. Their foreheads press together as they share a breath. Feel their pulses beat in a way that says,
“Maybe you aren’t.” Sam’s head snapped up at that. Wounded, almost.
“I’ve wanted to do that for a long time,” Dean’s voice is a little hoarse, with too many causes to name why.
Then there’s a creak of wood, it makes Dean lift his head automatically to the door.
“Maybe you aren’t real because Chuck decided this, or maybe you aren’t because the possibility is enough for her,” Dean gentled his voice but continued on. Sam needed to hear this.
Now, when Sam looks over at Dean and Cas with bags over their shoulders and no particular destination in mind, he smiles.
Dean brought him home. And tucked him into a bed in the room that was close to his own. A room that had been Cas’ for years, but with a bed that had always been made, and lacking the small traces of a home. Such as the clothes that would begin to fill the closet and the drawers. First borrowed, and then wholly his own. Or the box of mix-tapes, steadily growing as Dean thinks of more ideas, more feelings he wants to show Cas through music. The pressed flowers in books he’s been reading, the small but growing collection of rocks and shells and precious things from nature. Or the open jar of peanut butter on the nightstand that Dean nags at him to
And when the smiles began to stretch too wide over his face, and Dean put blankets around his shoulders while his shaggy hair scattered against open books in the library, Dean knew it was time to sit next to Sammy with two beers and no words other than, “talk to me.”
Sometimes Dean catches Cas staring at the sky.
When Cas takes his hand and gently pulls him into the room, Dean goes; as simple as falling.
Dean sat quiet. Let him lick his wounds in peace. And he watched.
“But maybe you are. That’s up to Eileen to decide. You too, Sammy. You gotta lay out all the cards in the deck and make a call. And you decide if you’re real.”
I love you,
So he does. For the simple act of wanting, and everything more.
And when Cas smiles in a way that touches his eyes more than his face because he sees something beautiful, it won’t be the sky he’ll be looking at.
Dean has a strange, kind of unsexy thought: kissing Cas is a little like coming home to the bunker after a long, exhausting day, and settling into a bed that remembers him. There’s no Dean shaped void left behind when he inevitably has to get up in the morning, but there’s always that perfect space for him to come home to.
He gets to feel what shape Cas’ mouth makes as he whispers, “Hello, Dean.” Soft and real and completely perfect. He breathes them in, brushes them against his lips. Dean has never heard a more perfect sentence in his life.
He still is.
He knows, and it’s alright.
Sam’s been calling Eileen most nights, and staying over at her home even more.
And Dean would never have the chance to even say it back. Fuck, Cas deserved to know he was loved. He loves him so much it, it’s an ache that he carries, a physical thing that claws it’s way in first thing upon waking up and holds on until his last moments before sleep at night.
Cas’ lips are warm, and a little too dry. He parts them on an easy sigh. And Dean is drawn in further and further. He crowds in even closer, closer still. Cas is reaching for him too, his arms rising and surrounding Dean like this is the space he was always meant to fill.
Cas walks right up to him, just like he did so many years ago.
Two ravens will circle each other with their feathers rising effortlessly on the wind. They will be watched together.
, Dean thinks as he reaches out, cradles Cas’ cheek in his hand with all the wonder of discovering something not quite new.
But he spoke.
Eventually Dean has to turn his eyes back to the road, but he feels the weight of Cas’ gaze for the rest of the drive. It’s as familiar as his own heartbeat thudding in his chest or the draw of air into his lungs. A part of him.
Sam had just returned Dean’s gaze for a moment, and Dean watched as the denial and pain flashed over his face. Then Sam had hunched his shoulders, a towering 6’4” and ½ trying to be smaller.
Sometimes he’ll just glance over and Cas will be standing there, trench coat floating easy on a breeze with his face turned up towards the sky.
When he speaks, it’s a ghost of a kiss along Cas’ mouth. Like a benediction, like a prayer.
“Of course,” Dean answered.
“We could go someplace,” Dean says into a comfortable nothing over coffee one Thursday morning.
When the clerk asks if they want a double room or two singles, Dean answers instinctively and doesn’t regret it.
Of course.
Cas just doesn’t watch the sky. He watches the birds.
Because he loved him.
A yearning.
Dean wants to move closer, wants to kiss him.
, the kid tends to keep some stuff, the really difficult stuff, deep inside. And he deals with it by attempting heart-to-hearts with others. His failsafe is to ask what they’re feeling, trying his best to help himself through helping others. Throwing a life-raft when you’re already drifting out to sea.
Hell, it’s not like Cas hasn’t been vocal about his admiration of Earth’s beauty, or whatever. He’s witnessed Cas binge watching hours of those nature documentaries; the kind that even Sam has been known to yawn at halfway in. He’s seen Cas stare at a night sky dusted with stars, the amber glow of a setting sun. Dean knows that little smile Cas gets - that lives more in his eyes than his face - when he sees something beautiful.
He thought of watching Cas leave. Always leaving. But this time knowing it meant not coming back.
“I know.”
The radio stays on that station, and Dean’s hand stays in Castiel’s.
He doesn’t know how long he sits there, but he knows that the hours pass, because it’s dark when he finally raises his head to look around.
It was a long shot anyway, he knows that.
There’s no great winds, no shaking of the very ground beneath him. No lights exploding and sparks flying and a cosmic sense of awe.
They’re packed by late noon.
“Wherever,” Dean feels the corners of his mouth rising. “Anywhere.”
He thought of all the times they’d found each other, since the beginning. Not because of fate, but a miracle of their very own.
It never comes.
Before Dean left for his own room that night, Cas’ hand shot out and gripped Dean’s shoulder. Dean was anchored to the bed in Cas’ gentle hold. Once upon a time the question Cas asked might have been, “can I stay,” with the wounds of wandering that never really healed.
saying, “We are.”
But Cas is here. He’s here and alive and touchable.
I love you.
Dean takes care of him, in the ways he can. The ways Cas doesn’t just need, but wants him to. Not because Dean feels he owes him, never out of duty. But because Cas smiles at him and softly says, “thank you,” just for Dean making a peanut butter and honey sandwich. When he comes into the Dean-Cave with a stretch and a yawn and the sleepy comfort only truly found in someone who’s at home. When he turns back from the sky and finds Dean watching, and he smiles.
No longer flying, but coming home just the same.
It had taken too much.
He smiles, a slow, sunny thing. It crinkles his eyes and pulls on the lines of his face, the signs of age, of human exposure to time.
Castiel nods and brushes his moist hands over his dress pants. His last hope that his good interim employment reference would be enough just went out of the window. Heart racing, he meets Adler's eyes.
"Your son is working at a petrol station," Mrs Novak spits.
Castiel smiles at him, but it doesn't reach his eyes. He leans his head against Dean's shoulder. "I want them to like you, and you to like them. It's stupid. I'm nearly 40. I shouldn't crave my parents' approval."
"Don't say Sam finally dragged you to the farmers' market."
"Why's that? Roomie got someone over?" Dean wiggles his eyebrows.
There's never judgement in Castiel's eyes, just gentle understanding as if it weren't a big deal that Dean lashed out, exposed him, and was a frigging asshole back in the hospital and sometimes since he's been back, too. Dean isn't sure if he deserves his forgiveness, but he's too much of a coward to let go of the man he loves. If Castiel still kisses him after everything he's done, then maybe he should just trust that he won't get rid of him any second, simply because he's needy.
With a determination that Castiel hasn't felt for a long time, he walks back into town. He has no destination in mind and still, he ends up at Rowena and Sam's tea shop. Remembering his own words towards Dean, he pushes the door open. Sam will know what to do.
"Okay," she says, strangely calm.
"Thanks a lot, Liz. Way to destroy my happiness," Dean grunts.
Of course, Dean sees it as easy as that. Maybe Castiel isn't hiding him from his family, but the other way around. Maybe Dean will understand how deeply he has fallen when he sees Hannah's house, her perfect family, the BMW in her driveway. Maybe Dean will ask him why he chose to live on the street instead of moving into his sister's guest room that is bigger than his new one, and much more luxurious for sure, with an en-suite bathroom, a walk-in rainfall shower, and all that jazz.
"Me neither. Come on. Let's throw something on the stove, and we'll talk." He presses another kiss on Castiel's temple and pulls him off the sofa.
The young man turns to him. He looks even slimmer than the last time they met. "Castiel. What…? You're working here?"
Charlie raises her eyebrows. "Again?"
"See? Every time he goes back to his place I feel like shit. At least here, he'd have space for himself, wouldn't have to worry that someone steals his sleeping bag or—" Dean groans. Is he talking himself into this or does he really want his boyfriend to move in with them?
Castiel leans back. "If I didn't know better, I'd think you're missing me when you're off work, Dean."
She huffs a wet laugh. "I missed you, too. Welcome home."
And now, he has lost his love.
Rowena chuckles. "Oh, I can imagine. What did Castiel reply to that?"
Dean's hand lands tenderly on Castiel's shoulder and he can finally let out the breath he seems to have been holding for two years now.
"Sweet-talker," Dean murmurs against his lips.
Castiel murmurs something unintelligible and shakes his head. "Talk to me," Dean orders quietly.
Dean deserves better. He deserves sex. But maybe, if he lets him fuck him now and then…? Castiel knows he's good with his hands and his mouth, and Dean is someone he already cares deeply about. So it won't be as hard as with those other men. He can do this. It's a little price to pay for lying in this beautiful man's arms.
"Nah. Just give me a minute to freshen up. Can't look bad next to my handsome boyfriend."
He grabs his phone. Several missed calls and a ton of text messages await him. His eyes grow wider and wider as he scrolls through them.
"Good," Charlie says. "Then prove it."
"There you are," a too-familiar voice comes from behind. "I thought you left me hanging, man."
Dean shakes his head at these thoughts. That's how it always starts. He thinks someone is cute, feels the urge to kiss and touch them, and a few days, weeks, or months later, it ends in heartache and him being a little bit more broken than before.
Dean slams some bottles of beer on the table and plops into the end of the sofa.
He knows how awful this would sound if he spoke it out loud, but he really likes Castiel. He is funny and adorably weird. He's beautiful and incredibly kind. His kisses turn Dean's legs into jelly. He's so damn perfect, and even though Dean knows that there is inevitably heartache on the horizon, right now, he would spend a year in purgatory just to have him in his arms once.
"Sure thing. Just need a quick shower, babe." Another kiss on the cheek, and he's gone.
Dean shakes his head. "No. She said she needed space. It's gonna be fine, Sammy. I gotta go now. Your birthday cake is waiting."
"Leased. It's owned by an allotment society which I'm a member of now." He chuckles. "Never saw that coming."
"Sorry. 'M just tired," Dean mumbles.
Dean's blood runs cold. Doesn't Lisa know that he and Castiel are together? She must have heard it through the grapevine. Dean sure knows about the men she dated since they went different ways.
"Drop it, kiddo," Dean groans. "I'm just sick. Just let me sleep, and I'm back to normal in no time."
Dean furrows his brow and chews a piece of steak. "And he goes running instead?"
Dean wakes up with the hangover of the century. He's gonna die for sure. But his angel left painkillers and water on his bedside table. And a note. Dean needs a moment to make his brain work to be able to read it.
Castiel nods and smiles at him. This one isn't forced. He can't wait to be with Dean in chartered waters again.
Dean raises his eyebrows and swallows. "How bad is it?"
"Um, fine. Everything's fine."
"The pleasure was all mine, Mrs Novak." He sees Castiel smirk out of the corner of his eye. Such a smooth operator.
Dean's eyes stray to Castiel in the second row. He looks proud, too. But at him. Dean diverts his gaze, heat crawling into his cheeks. Why the hell does this wonderful man love him? He will never understand. But his shrink said that he's worthy of the love the people around him are giving him freely. He's not so sure it's true, but he decided to accept it anyway. Life is strenuous enough without questioning everything.
He covers Castiel like a blanket. Dean loves this, loves that his boyfriend is nearly as tall as him, so muscular and strong. He loves Castiel's messy hair and his stupidly blue eyes. And his lips. So he kisses him with all he's got. And Castiel opens up to him, lets out noises of pleasure that stir something in Dean's stomach, a low burning flame of arousal that he tries to ignore.
Castiel didn't think he could adore the man more, but here they are, kissing goodbye on the bus because his boyfriend only has about four hours to sleep before he joins a force that helps some underprivileged souls. Bless them.
Dean gets up and busies himself with the food on the tray. "She died when I was four."
Dean switches to a classic rock station. It's not that he doesn't like different music. His Spotify account proves otherwise. But when he's tired, he gets nostalgic, and this is the music his father used to play on their road trips.
Dean grabs his arm as he turns to leave. "No, I didn't mean the family dinner. I meant the flight."
Not that Castiel could ask anybody about it. Dean not only taught him how to feel, but also that talking about feelings isn't very manly. Granted, Castiel is an angel. He feels comfortable in his male vessel, but a man he is not. Neither a woman. He just is. Like the love floating through his body, human vessel or true form just the same.
Charlie pulls him into a side-hug. "Why's that?"
"They are. But it still does make a difference if they come from beer, bread, or bacon."
Anna? Oh, that's the future sister-in-law Sam raved about and Dean thinks he wants to set him up with. Well, that probably flew out of the window a minute ago.
"That's all?"
"The shrink said it's important that I function in everyday life. There's no use in postponing my return. And I need to pay my rent, and probably parts of the medical bill. So…"
Still. What if the kind of attraction Dean feels for him is connected to his looks? What if his intervention earlier is not born out of health concerns, but aesthetic reasons? He can't lose Dean because of a petty matter like this.
Dean pulls his eyes away and shrugs. "What? He's hot. Doesn't mean I wanna hit that."
Dean's cheeks dust a beautiful pink. "It's from Sammy's shop. The blend is actually named after me."
Sams laughs. It hurts Dean's head. "Better ask what didn't happen last night."
"I know. They didn't even know if I was still alive back then. Every last cent on my bank account was distrained, so I didn't use my cards anymore. I inflicted a lot of pain on my family." He gets up from the bench. "I'm sorry that I shouted at you. I know you just worry about me. I'll eat at the picnic tomorrow. I'll start the fast earlier to make up for it."
"I bet it is," Crowley says. He pats Castiel forcefully on the back, making him jolt forward. "Must be good for something these…"
"Cass, that's not necessary," Dean says, putting a plate on the drying rack.
And Castiel wants it to be true. If there is anyone worth giving up his comfort for then it's this man. The man who kissed him because he couldn't help it, who makes him laugh, and doesn't look down at him, who makes him daydream and feel nervous and happy whenever he simply looks at him.
Dean gasps for air. "Personnel? How loaded is your family?"
His boyfriend who just stormed out on him. Dean leaves Castiel a message, as he doesn't pick up. Where would he go if he is in distress? He has no other friends in town save those he shares with Dean. With anger, Dean realises that he never asked what Castiel's favourite places are, or encouraged him to make friends, or pick up a hobby.
Like with Lisa. But that was different. Dean still doesn't know what he loved more—her or the idea of loving her, the version of himself that he was at her side. It doesn't matter now. Castiel made all their pictures disappear, along with the memories in her and Ben's heads. He left one photograph of their little family on Dean's pillow, though. The one he crammed into his duffle bag and put into his bedside drawer in the bunker.
"Where is your collection now? Your room still needs decoration."
"It's our stop," Castiel points out, and Dean blinks at him several times before he nods and gets up. How could they kiss so long that the journey is already over?
Dean thinks.
Castiel sighs and pushes the thoughts of a happy future away. Nothing is granted.
Castiel's face lights up, putting the nearly full moon above him to shame. "I
Dean groans. "I don't wanna."
"I've been busy." Dean looks briefly at Castiel. "Very busy." He smirks.
Sam opens his mouth but snaps it closed again when Dean lets out a tired groan. He's next to him in a split second.
Garth leans against the customer side of the counter, seemingly flirting with Mr Blue-Eyes. Dean knows that he's happily married with twins on the way, but Garth likes people, is funny, and bubbly as a puppy. He probably wouldn't even call it flirting. Maybe it's just because something about Garth leaning towards the stranger so closely rubs Dean the wrong way. Or it's the stranger's smile that he seems to share with everybody.
"Honestly?"
Dean grins at him. "That would be awesome. Nora surely will find someone to fill in the one night."
"Yeah, just not really convinced about this whole wedding business. Don't you think it's too fast?"
Dean flushes red. "I didn't want to assume that you wanna share a bed, now that you finally have your own space again."
"I know, but—"
But Dean deserves him at least trying. "Sorry that I make things difficult."
He wasn't with April for long, but long enough to understand that even she, a professional, couldn’t fix him, couldn’t make him want. He never attempted therapy again after that. Probably a mistake, as his last boyfriend said that his loose screws needed fixing.
Dean pats him on his back and hurries into the house. He finds Castiel in the kitchen, talking with Eileen. Their hands are signing too quickly for Dean to understand, but both are laughing.
Castiel smiles at him, if a little forced. "Yes. I brought bread from the Sourdough Factory."
"You lost enough weight, Cass. This is getting out of hand. It's Labour Day. That means the old tradition of hot dogs in the park, Sam's infamous taco salad, and Charlie's S'mores cupcakes. Oh, and don't forget the new tradition of a picnic cooler full of soda. I ain't gonna accept no for an answer. You can change your eating window for once. Live a little."
Castiel chuckles. "I'll bake you so much pie that you'll get sick of it."
Nora laughs, pats him on the shoulder, and waves both men goodbye.
He feels the bed dip right next to him and a warm hand on his cheek. His eyes snap up to Castiel's. "I love them. I've dreamt of doing this with you."
"Cass!" Dean could hit himself. How did he mess this up so badly? "You don't have to lose weight. I like your little love handles."
She stops him with a finger on his lips. "I know. Just… When the hospital called me…" She looks at the closed curtains. "You still can't sleep during the day, can you?"
Dean nearly spurts his mouthful of coffee over the breakfast table. God, this family is worse than his own—spruced up facade and dirt all over the back, as it seems.
"...regrets that she was stupid enough to let you go. Of course, if you want to go back to her…"
Dean turns his head and stares at the outstretched hand for a very long moment. He has never danced with a man before. Not without a beer bottle in his hand and for sure not a slow dance. But he feels a pull to this man, who he hated with all his guts just a day ago. A man with kind eyes, a shy smile, and a patience Dean isn't used to.
"But maybe I'm gonna be a stay-at-home husband," he smirks, "when this one does the career that his boss held out for him." Castiel snorts a laugh.
"Merry Christmas, Cass."
Dean groans as he downs the hot coffee in hope of a tiny bit of an energy boost. He's so damn tired and he knows that won't change unless he finds a new line of work. But for now, he needs this job at the 24/7 Gas-N-Sip. Even more than a healthy circadian rhythm.
Dean puts a whisky and a water glass in front of them, and whatever Rowena meant to say stays on her tongue which she bites while grinning wildly. She pats Castiel's knee and stubbornly stays seated when Dean is finished with handing out the beer bottles.
Pride and shame. Castiel tripped over the first and drowned in the second. Still does. Though it's easier since he met Dean, has a job, a reason to get up every day—still, the feeling lingers in his bones. Maybe that's why he's trying so hard to make Dean happy, to feed him well, bake him a pie ever so often.
Dean's thumb running over his knuckles is unsettling. His boyfriend deserves better. He deserves to be taken on weekend trips, to be showered with gifts. But Castiel can't afford any of it. Not anymore.
"And why the hell should I leave you alone then? We're a team." Dean smirks at Castiel. "I'll charm the heck out of 'em. You'll see. Mothers always like me."
"Yes. Health insurance, for example. You could ruin yourself with a stupid accident while out on the run or something."
He can't suppress a smile when Dean comes into view. He's so handsome with the green Henley that hugs his torso in all the right places and brings out the colour of his eyes. The shirt's green bites with the blue of the Gas-N-Sip vest, but Dean will likely change into a long-sleeve shirt anyway. He'd catch a cold from the AC otherwise.
"I don't know what to wear," Castiel says, his whole wardrobe lying scattered over his furniture in strangely systematic looking heaps.
"What happened? Did I do something wrong?"
"Someone has worked up an appetite," Benny teases, leaning against the kitchen island. Dean just rolls his eyes at his flatmate, who grabs one of the fried bacon slices and shoves it into his mouth. "I thought you were done with fucking your coworkers."
Dean stares at the small paper. No bee doodles, no 'I love you'. And then, there's the fact that Castiel never goes out running on a Sunday morning. This is their lazy day. They sleep in, have sex, share a shower, and then walk to the small café around the corner offering scones and pie all day. Not that he would crave any of it right now.
"Wha… what do you mean?"
Castiel looks at him for a long moment. That didn't sound right. "No, I do like it."
That makes Dean blush. "You can't just say shit like that."
'Oh, shit. This is going to be tight tomorrow,' Dean thinks as he licks up Castiel's cock and takes the tip into his mouth. 'Why does Sammy need this stupid birthday cake from the other side of town?'
But he was wrong. Dean knows it wasn't anybody's fault. Both of them tried to do the right thing. Even Castiel as he watched him raking the leaves and decided to let him go. Out of love, even though Castiel didn't have the word for this emotion back then.
"No, it's not!" Dean all but shouts and pushes Castiel off him. He fishes for his pyjama bottoms and puts them on.
"Are you okay, buddy?" Dean's voice is so soft and caring that Castiel's smile falters a little.
This time when he exits their en-suit, he finds Castiel sitting on the side of their bed, staring at the new shelves. He turns his head slowly, a bright smile adorning his face.
Yes, Dean is too good to be true. On so many levels. Isn't it enough that he is a great kisser, good with kids throwing a tantrum in aisle 2 at 6 am, and the perfect pillow to sleep on? No. The man has to volunteer in his free time, too.
Anger mixes with regret as Dean switches on the floor lamp and sees Castiel's tear-soaked face. "Oh, honey."
"Dreamy," Charlie says, suddenly very soft.
Castiel chuckles. "He really does."
"You earned it," he says and stretches his arm over the backrest.
Dean is hot, but thankfully not running a fever yet. Castiel looks at the empty water bottles next to Dean's bed. He can't have drunk that much since Castiel left, can he?
"He promised to come over, warm up, and eat lunch with me every day till his birthday." Okay, 'with him' is a stretch. He means 'in my office'. But Charlie doesn't need to know that. He can fast without a squeezy conscience when he gives his food away. And dinner tastes so much better when he felt a little hungry before anyway.
Castiel shakes the offered hand. "I'm Castiel. I'm Dean's boyfriend. Nice to meet you."
She carries herself like a queen, and despite still struggling with the thought that she might have talked about him, Castiel takes her hand and presses a barely-there kiss on its back. "Pleasure to meet you."
"That's just petty larceny of food. You needed to feed your brother and yourself."
Castiel's eyes flicker around. He seems to be overwhelmed already. The guy is probably in his 40s, but he looks like a lost kid.
Castiel blinks himself back to wakefulness where he had fallen asleep leant against Dean's shoulder. Was this just a dream? Must have been. How likely is it that someone like Dean Winchester kisse—okay, Dean's kissing him now, chaste.
Dean stares at him for a long moment, wrinkling his brow as everyone falls silent around them. He bites back the words piling up in his mouth and grabs his water glass, even though the red wine in front of him looks much more tempting.
Dean knows his little brother way too well to believe this lie. "What happened?"
like cuddles, Dean?"
"About what?"
"Mind if I change the radio channel? That racket goes on my nerves," he calls over.
"Are you alright?" Dean asks as he watches Castiel press his phone against his forehead.
"Hangover. 'm fine."
Cooking. He has dreamt about it, literally. He used to love it, bought all the exotic ingredients, had themed weeks when he cooked only Indonesian or Polish food or whatever tickled his fancy. He won't be able to do that with the little money he makes, but a spaghetti sauce from scratch sounds like a three-star chef meal by now.
Between work, interrupted sleep, and his volunteer work, there is not a lot of time to meet with friends anymore. He visits his brother Sam and his girlfriend Rowena on his day off, at least. Their small tea and herb shop isn't swamped with customers. It's always fun to be with them and help to pack some of the online orders. They don't judge him when he's tight-lipped. A bit of loving teasing, and they leave him be.
Missouri gets up from the bed and walks to the door. Hand on the handle, she turns and says, "Your souls are good for one another. I can feel it. Don't mess it up with hiding who you are."
"Congratulations," she says and smiles brightly at him. Castiel feels so much better when he leaves to catch a bus home.
"Oh, yeah." Dean chuckles. "She's awesome. Is she a psychic? She's given off some supernatural vibes."
Charlie's smile morphs to a frown when she appears in the doorway. "Holy shit! You look like crap!" That makes Dean's eyes shoot open. Castiel tries not to be offended.
"There's nothing wrong about working hard to pay the bills," Dean says firmly. "Where were you when your brother had to do worse things to survive the next day than restocking the shelves, huh?"
"Yes, I am. I have never thought about how hard all of this must be for you. A new relationship with a man who has the same addiction as you, who you had to care for nearly from the beginning. You're far away from your family. I don't even know if you've got friends somewhere, or what your hobbies were before you…" Dean looks at his hands lying in his lap and sighs. "Thing is, I don't know much about you, and you don't know much about me."
Of course, there is another solution, but that's a bit presumptuous, and possibly would send wrong signals, too. But he doesn't know anyone else in the area, and the homeless shelter is closed by day. He ponders sleeping in the park, faking a nap. His back will probably kill him, though. And his work clothes might get dirty.
Dean walks through the bus and flashes Castiel a toothy grin when the other man takes his backpack off the seat next to him. Castiel's smile is brilliant. Dean takes a deep breath and tries to rein in the butterflies storming his stomach.
"Dean. Let us talk about it."
"Oh, I doubt that they will meet us before tomorrow. My parents are usually in bed at 9.30. Unless the Queen of Sheba arrives." He breathes out slowly and looks back at Dean. "Thank you for coming with me. I have no words to express how much this means to me."
Castiel's mother wasn't fond of Jewish people, but one got a pass, probably because he was Polish-born like herself—Joshua Heschel. She loved to quote the rabbi to her children, and her favourite was 'Self-respect is the root of discipline: The sense of dignity grows with the ability to say no to oneself.'
"I can't sleep without him." Dean leans his head into his hands. "I'm so pathetic. I've never felt so useless."
Dean used to wonder, sometimes, what it would be like to reach across the divide and touch Castiel. If he even could at all. Or if Castiel was already gone, and just waiting for Dean to catch up.
Cas no longer looks at him the way he looks at the sky.
And it won’t be the sky that looks back.
Bobby isn’t sitting next to him, this time.
They head West.
Sam was still staring at him, and Hell if for a moment he didn’t look like a kid all of thirteen, smart and headstrong and full of belief in his big brother.
