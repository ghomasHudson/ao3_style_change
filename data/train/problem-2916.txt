"The only thing I need you to do," Castiel says, as he dives down to capture Dean's lips in a soft peck, "-is make me feel good."
scent from miles away. But the questions remained. Why did his condo smell like coffee at half-past midnight?
He pulled away to lick stripes of spit up and down Dean's cock, drenching it as much as he could. Castiel stroked the base of Dean's cock with his hands, moving them in sync with his mouth, as he bobbed and sucked, moaned around the length and toyed with the slit, drinking in every last drop of pre-come trickling down Dean's cock.
"You're gorgeous, the best thing I've seen in a long while, and man, I have seen some pretty things," As if being struck with an idea, Dean's eyes widened, "-if I untie your mouth, will you beg for me, baby? Will you let me hear your pretty little moans when I fuck you?"
Dean shrugs, breaking the thread off his trousers as he answers,  “-Eh, nothing much, I've got some documents to go through. Sam called a while ago. Was tellin' me to check my e-mail and stuff— " The sound of his cell phone ringing through the kitchen catches his attention, and he stands up, "
"Dean," Castiel found himself whining, jerking his legs and rolling his hips to seek some semblance of friction against his leaking cock.
"You came?" Dean gasps, throwing the door open, stepping out and pressing his back to the  car, unable to move as he drinks in the sight of Cas. Still dressed in his horrible beige trenchcoat, and his usual blue tie. But somehow, he seems different. His face is smoother, somehow, and Dean realises just how beautiful he looks without stress lines creasing his forehead.
"Who is it at the door?" Castiel asks from a distance, judging by the muffled sound of his voice, and Dean tenses his shoulders to hover over Hannah, who steps back with a glint of fear in her eyes.
He ran, pushing people aside, shoving them out of his way, dashing out the door, where the noise of the music was muted, and the air was fresh, and didn't reek of alcohol and puke, and this was what Castiel needed— space. He needed space to breathe. He filled his lungs with the fresh, cool air until once again, the chill of the winter begun to crawl down Castiel's skin, and he wrapped his arms around his chest, blowing out a soft puff of air as he walked down the narrow pathway into God-knows-where.
"To turn it into an even beautiful place," Dean whispered against his ear, and pressed a kiss to his neck, away from Garth's eyes.
Dean replaces the prince's fingers with his own, and adds in a first finger, to which the prince lets out a deafening whine and presses his face into the soft pillows under him, moaning out a muffled string of Dean's name, as Dean adds a second finger. This time, he focuses more on stretching the tiny hole open, rather than simply pleasuring Castiel, as he pulls the rim apart, crooks his fingers, and brushes his digits against the prince's sweet spot. With every brush against the ridge, Castiel's breath stutters, and Dean relishes in the sound of it as he adds in a third finger to check if Castiel's wet hole can at last swallow him inside.
How? How can Cas say these things? Did he really see Dean that way? Why now? Why is he telling him now, right after he confesses a deal with the Empthy who will take him away. And there is Death coming after them both. Why now? Dean wants to hear the words, but now is not the right time.
When Dean opens his eyes, there is a warm light. It's not the place he closed his eyes the last time. Closed his eyes…There was a shot. He has been in a fight. He did it to protect Sam, for sure. To keep Sam safe.
“Good,” Dean smiles. His little brother deserves a normal life. Well, whatever normal can be for someone who lived their life. Saving people, hunting monsters, well, not Dean's business anymore. And thankfully not Sam's. He can have a future with Eileen. That's good.
Dean hit the floor hard. But there was no pain. Crazy but the scratch from that freaking rusty nail, who stabed him in his back before, hurts more than the bullet on his chest. There was blood, his slowing heartbeat and Sam's voice loud in his ears. Then quieter, then quieter…
Dean couldn't just jump in. Not even here in heaven. But the new realization and the feelings have grown. Grow like a flower, tender and beautiful. Now Dean can pick them and hand them over to Castiel.
No one else is here. Just him. The sunlight warms his skin while the wind whispers with a peaceful voice and the ocean showed a calm surface. There is grass and trees behind his back around hundret feet away. The trees growing in a full forest. Dean could see a hut. Maybe a tiny house made of wood but it seems deserted, even at this distance. He had to go and check it later. But no rush, he has time.
Only a few seconds later, the two turn around. Sam is here. He looked like the day Dean had seen him last. But how? So many years have passed by. Maybe only for Dean's heaven? Who knows? Who cares?
When Dean looks around, turns his head from left to right, he stops abruptly. He stares with wide eyes. That can't be real, can it? His heart stops for a moment, only to beat harder and faster the next second.
When Cas started talking, Dean was unable to process the words. “What?” was the only thought – the only thing his brain could come up with. Happiness, what a big word. What a strong feeling. Dean can't image what his happiness could look like, too. But Cas keeps talking.
Dean looks amused. “Well, you know, life is a bitch. My time was over, I think. I skipped death enough times.”
Dean stands up, slowly looking around. This place is bright, peaceful and calm. He feels safe here, even if he can't say why.
He’d think about it on hunts, driving through States, through towns, through neighbourhoods, wondering what kind of place he could see himself in, what kind of place Cas might enjoy.
Dean grabs his bag and follows Sam inside the room, dropping it on the bed closer to the door. Sam quickly disappears in the bathroom to change and Dean takes a second too long to rummage through his belongings before having to face Cas again.
It feels strange to be doing this for him, or maybe it feels strange that it doesn’t feel stranger, feels strange how much he wants to do it, but Dean swallows all of those weird feelings down, choosing instead to focus on making Cas feel better, passing his fingers slowly through his hair, making sure he’s washing every strand, taking the time to massage his scalp when Cas lets out a small moan that’s not pained for once. Dean repeats the movement Cas liked a few times, scratching his scalp front to back, letting his soapy hands rest on Cas’ shoulders for a beat, feeling the warmth of him, before reaching for the showerhead again.
His hands are light on Cas’ ankle, thumb rubbing on the bone. Cas visibly reacts to the touch, shivers, and when Dean looks up, their eyes meet, Cas’ already on his, intense and focused, the kind of gaze that told Dean his entire soul was bare for Cas to read back when he was an angel. It still hits the same even knowing Cas doesn’t have that ability anymore. Purposefully, Dean repeats the gesture. He wonders, briefly, if Cas has ever been touched there, if anyone he spent time with as a human ever gently pressed their fingers right there, if the skin is new, if the body is too. He wonders if the Empty rebuilt Cas somehow minus the grace before spitting him out back to Dean. He wonders if every single piece of skin he just touched in the shower was being touched for the very first time, if that’s why it seemed so overwhelming. A phantom hand burns against Dean’s left shoulder as he thinks back to Cas remaking him anew after his descent into Hell; Cas leaving a brand right there on Dean’s body, on Dean’s soul. ‘I touched him first,’ it said. Dean’s mind flickers back to the bloody handprint he never even tried to wash from his jacket… ‘I touched him last,’ the wound said. Dean finally looks away, rubbing Cas’ ankle again, fiercely imagining it leaving a thumbprint, wishing, beyond reason, that his touch could brand in the same way. Then, he slides the sock on Cas’ feet, one after the other, squeezing them once before clearing his throat and getting back up.
“I can have a look through Sam’s stuff for a book for you if you’d like,” he finally says after a long moment of silence.
“What?” Cas asks, laughing along with him without even knowing why and Dean shrugs, sheepish now, but still grinning, reaching across the table to take one of Cas’ hands between his, his thumb soft on Cas’ wrist.
That was hours and hours ago though, Dean’s legs and back stiff from sitting in the same position on the floor of Cas’ room for most of them. Suddenly embarrassed, he bristles. “You can talk.”
But he’s changed a lot since then, they both have, and Dean suspects he’s being obtuse on purpose, uncomfortable perhaps with the turn this conversation is taking. There’s a smidge of teasing, of sarcasm, in his tone though, because he knows Dean values the truth between them after there have been so many lies. Dean isn’t sure why it irritates him so much, but for a second he wants to argue back, like they always do, wants to be obtuse on purpose too. He wants to be annoying and tell Cas that yeah, actually, he’d like a lie right about now because it might make him feel better about the existential dread filling his lower belly ever since Cas got stabbed.
Dean laughs. There was a time Cas wouldn’t have cared about such trivial things. It wouldn’t even have occurred to him. And sure, the evident sarcasm in his tone hints at him not caring much about it now, but something loosens a little inside Dean’s chest anyway.
“I could have taken away your pain easily,” Cas says, closing his eyes and shaking his head, a frown pitched between his eyebrows. “Even with my powers fading the way they were, I could have… Before…”
“I can’t look at you while we’re having a conversation?” He knows he’s being obtuse on purpose, but it’s easier than admitting the fact that he’s afraid Cas is going to disappear if he looks away. Even for a second.
It’s as void of any personal touches as ever, but the sight of the obviously slept in bed makes Dean smile, half a grin, only a tiny thing in the corner of his mouth really. Dirty sheets and twisted blankets, one of the pillows on the floor, not to mention the glass of water and the bowl Dean left behind; all proof that it’s real, that Cas is really here.
. “Oh,” Cas whispers, realises. Dean thinks he might be hallucinating a faint glow around him as hope blossoms. “I…”
that undoes Dean completely. He swallows, hard. Trust him to do this all wrong too. “Yeah, yeah alright.” He agrees softly, squeezing Cas’ neck once before leaning away from him. “Here, let me help you,” he adds as he gets up to his feet, holding a hand out for Cas to grab.
Cas deserves better than that. Right now, Cas deserves all the gentleness in the world and that’s what Dean is going to give him. The softest towel, the softest clothes, the softest blanket… The softest touches…
“You gonna be okay in there?” Dean asks, watching with careful eyes as Cas leans his entire weight against the shower wall.
“You don’t mind, right?” Dean finally checks, too little too late, and he nods, relieved when Cas shakes his head.
“Just… tell me how to help, alright Cas? I’ll…” Dean trails off, the ‘I’ll do anything’ stuck in his throat. He doesn’t have to say it, even if he’d like to at some point. They both know.
Dean nods and carries on, instead of replying. “I’m just sorry you had to lose your grace for it,” he says, looking down at his own empty plate he never washed. “If I had known…” Dean shakes his head. Would he have acted any differently? Would he have been less selfish? Would he have left Cas to rest? He takes a second to imagine it, the rest of his life without Castiel: barren years where he’d try his best to carry on; an absence like a presence at his side; the ghost of everything Cas’ has come to mean to him as his only companion. No, Dean doesn’t think he would have been strong enough to let go. He’s always been weak like that when it comes to Cas, has always lost himself the moment he was gone.
“I know, Dean,” Cas interrupts, “I’ve always known,” and Dean, who has been haunted by Cas’ voice saying ‘the one thing I want is something I know I can’t have’ ever since he first heard it, doesn't think he does actually. But Cas carries on. “I could hear prayers, remember? But it was always more than that. Angels we… I could feel longing too.”
“Doesn’t matter,” Dean mutters, taking his hand away half-heartedly. The buzzing under his skin doesn’t seem so loud when Cas is at hand. “You look good.” He pauses. “Great, even.”
“Have you been sitting there watching me the whole time?” Cas asks, still half asleep, squinting at Dean from the bed, fuck knows how many hours later.
Dean swallows, hard, suddenly moved without fully knowing why. Naively, he thought maybe the fact that Cas has done this before would make it easier, but he’d be the first to admit that he didn’t exactly have an easy go of it. And this? This is worse, as per Cas’ admission.
“Careful with your eyes,” Dean instructs before starting to rinse the shampoo off, grimacing when the water sliding down his back comes out a little bloody.
Most days, Dean doesn’t think there is anything pure left in what he feels for Cas. It’s selfish and greedy. It’s hungry when he lets himself really feel it, half-drunk with a hand on himself. But not today, not now. Not anymore.
Except, instead of making his way straight to his bedroom to grab what he said he would, Dean leans against the cold wall of the corridor, exhaling slowly.
Next, Dean grabs soap and a washcloth to get started on Cas’ body. But he flinches at the touch of the cloth on his skin, too sensitive perhaps, Dean doesn’t know. He still hums in agreement though, dropping the cloth at the bottom of the tub straight away, soaping up his hands instead, careful when he tries again.
It gets stuck in his throat, it always gets stuck in his throat. Dean closes his eyes, tightening his hands into fists on the table, inhaling deeply.
Dean nods in acknowledgement. “Well, for what it’s worth, I am sorry. For all of it. And you… You never have to thank me for this,” Dean points towards the kitchen, their empty plates, words like ‘taking care of you’ stuck in his throat. “And I meant what I said,” he continues. “We’ll figure this whole….” Dean gestures vaguely towards Cas’ entire being, the sweatpants, the old henley, the bathrobe still wrapped around his shoulders. “This whole human thing out. Together. You can… You can hunt, or… you know…” he trails off, thinking back to the job application still on his desk, the small desire to do something
It takes them a while to get to the bathroom even though it isn’t that far, and once they do, Cas lets out a very long exhale. Clearly, despite the rest, everything is taking a toll. He presses a hand to his stomach, looking queasy.
For a second, Cas doesn’t say anything back and Dean fiddles with the pocket of his coat, looking for their key. Maybe it’s better this way, if they don’t hash it out, if Dean doesn’t say what he feels.
Still, after months of drowning in his sorrow, months of loneliness trying to rejoice in the face of his brother’s happiness, in the face of their evident victory, the reminder is more than welcome.
Cas looks shy, hands buried deep in the pockets of Dean’s bathrobe. But he nods, looking down at the bathroom tile for a beat before finally meeting Dean’s eyes. “Much.”
He hardens his expression before kneeling next to Cas on the floor, dismisses any traces of panic as he slowly presses a hand in the middle of Cas’ back like he’s a spooked horse; like they’re both spooked horses.
When Cas is done, Dean takes a step to the side, still close enough to catch him if he stumbles, before grabbing some mouthwash and offering it to him. Cas grunts his thanks before chasing the terrible taste out of his mouth.
Dean chuckles to himself. He’s being gauded into saying something, he knows, and he knows he's going to fall for it. “Yeah,” he admits, voice low but not quite whispering, afraid of waking Sam. He fucking wishes he felt tired. Then, maybe his brain would just…
“Cas!” Dean says, half a groan, half a whimper – he sounds more worried than he means to – before he runs to where Cas is wiping his mouth with a shaky hand, on his knees, one palm still on the floor, barely holding himself up.
Dean feels his throat tighten and his eyes prickle. “Yeah,” he agrees, taking another swig of whiskey.
“No,” Cas interrupts, waving him off as he makes his way to the table too, sitting down. “That sounds perfect.”
Not that Dean gives him a chance to argue back, opening his door quickly and getting out of the car before he’s entirely done speaking. He doesn’t want to have to explain himself, especially not when he doesn’t fully know what the fuck is going on with him. It
He’s asleep in less than a minute and Dean and Cas finally find themselves alone. Or as close to alone as they’ve been since his miraculous resurrection.
He takes a step forwards towards reception to get them a room, throwing an “I’ll be right back!” over his shoulder before he does something stupid like hug Cas again where Sam can see.
“Well, you clearly need the beauty sleep,” Dean replies, gruff, defensive, before turning the car off pointedly.
Dean startles when Sam knocks on his window and he frowns at him before opening the door and finally getting out of the car. “What?” he asks, a little shorter than he means to be.
“Hey,” Dean says, reaching for Cas’ wrist, stopping the movement. He tightens his grip for a second, a pulse of a touch, morse code on Cas’ skin that only Dean understands. “Why don’t we get you cleaned up? You’ll feel much better once you aren’t covered in….” Dean hesitates for a beat, before going with, “the Empty’s spit.”
Cas notices, of course, he does, because he’s Cas and he doesn’t need angelic powers to be attuned to people – attuned to Dean.
Cas just shrugs. “It seemed like a different type of stare. Like maybe there’s something on my face that shouldn’t be there. I don’t need to check in the mirror, do I? You’d let me know, right? I don’t have to make sure I look alright?”
“I’m gonna hit the shower,” Dean mumbles, feeling itchy all over, even stupid places like the back of his knees and down his sternum. It’s like there’s something about to burst out of him
. Like a compass pointing North, Dean has been orienting himself towards the angel who saved his life for a decade now, wanting and wanting and wanting. And all this time Cas could feel it?
Technically, they’re only a few hours away from the bunker, close enough that, under any other circumstances, Dean would push for them to drive through the night so he can be reunited with
Cas nods, still rubbing at his skin, with more intensity now, like he’s not even aware he’s doing it, like he’s trying to scrub himself raw.
He says the last part hesitantly and the weight of his confession settles over them heavily for the first time.
Cas shakes his head, eyes closed as he’s clearly hit with another wave of pain. Dean looks at him, really looks at him, and he feels his heart drop in his stomach. Without thinking he reaches for a bit of dirt near Cas’ temple, carefully brushing it off, wondering how something that is by definition void of
“Here,” Dean says, giving him both the room key and Baby’s, leaning back against the car while Sam goes to the trunk to grab their stuff.
“Alright?” he asks in a soft voice instead of shaking Cas awake in a panic like he wants to. He really still isn’t looking very good, and Dean is trying to find it in himself to trust Cas’ judgement on his own health and safety, but he can’t help the worry gnawing at the pit of his stomach.
Cas smiles back at him, a small crooked thing, the right corner of his mouth turned up, barely expressive but still looking pleased, like Dean’s worry is something to be treasured.
It doesn’t even take a second for him to feel the car shake when Cas closes his door and leans against it, mimicking Dean’s posture, their clothed arms brushing against each other, the slight pressure of Cas’ body against his so perfect Dean feels lit up from the inside. When Sam comes back around with both of their bags, Dean has to actively school his features into a neutral expression to hide the way his heart is thundering in his chest.
Dean’s not sure why it’s the one thing that finally makes him crumble, he’s not sure why he falls apart like this when he could burst with joy, but his face falls and suddenly, he’s sobbing into Castiel’s chest, the hands he kept on Cas’ shoulders tightening for a second before they fall to his waist, Dean hugging him closer and closer, trying to muffle the sounds of his sobs.
“It’s… nothing,” Cas replies, sounding uncertain, before raising a hand to scratch at his collarbones underneath the blanket that Dean wrapped carefully around him. “Just feels…” he trails off, looking lost for a second, and Dean wonders if he’s about to pass out or something when Cas grimaces visibly. “Itchy,” he finally settles on, seeming offended by the concept. “I… forgot,” he mumbles, mostly to himself.
that’s been growing ever since they got rid of Chuck and he’s been the only one steering the wheel flares deep in his chest. “You can do whatever you want.”
“Let me… You’ve already…” Dean grunts, getting frustrated with himself. He passes a hand through his hair, nervous, agitated. He wishes he had a drink, wishes he didn’t have to do this sober. He’s not sure what time it is though, and he’s pretty sure Cas wouldn’t approve of him getting drunk just to be emotionally vulnerable. He wouldn’t judge, of course, it’s Cas, but he wouldn’t approve. Besides, Dean feels like it would cheapen the moment somehow, even if it might give him the bravery boost he needs. Doing this sober makes it more real in ways he can’t quite quantify. “I’m not good at this,” Dean finally says instead of ‘I love you too’, laughing ruefully and shaking his head. “It took you leaving me for me to admit I was an ass and say I’m sorry, so of course it took you dying for me to admit  I –”
The light over their room door makes a slight buzzing sound and flickers a few times before turning off completely, but they can still see each other in the dawn when Dean finally meets Cas’ eyes.
After leaving his room – and he refuses to think of it as running away even though that’s absolutely what he did – Dean goes back to the bathroom, quickly cleaning the tub from the mixture of black goo and blood that still stuck after he helped Cas wash. Somehow, there are flickers of ‘Empty’ all the way up the wall and Dean makes a show of growling at the no longer animated substance on Cas’ behalf, a nonsensical, yet overwhelming sense of victory and poetic justice taking hold of him as he washes it down the drain.
“All I’ve done is rest since I’ve been back Dean,” Cas says matter-of-factly. “Tell me,” he demands, putting his other hand over Dean’s, the two of them tangled, and suddenly, it’s not enough, it seems so ridiculous how far apart they’re sitting, considering.
bed. But something is thrumming underneath his skin that makes his hands shake inexplicably against Baby’s steering wheel and it gets stronger every time Dean catches Cas’ eyes through the rearview mirror. He’s fine though. Cas is fine. He’s back. Like always. Except Dean can’t quite believe it so he has to look at the backseat again, and again, and the buzzing gets even worse, distracting and overwhelming. He’s not sure what he wants or, more specifically, what he needs – a drink perhaps? to touch Cas’ arm? to make sure he’s actually there? – but he needs it bad enough that the drive seems unbearable right now.
“I’m not in pain,” Dean says reassuringly, because he’s not, not a lot, and it doesn’t matter that Cas can’t do that stuff anymore. Not when he’s here. “Cas, it’s okay.”
“Alright,” Dean mumbles, putting the showerhead down to grab his shampoo, pouring a generous amount in his hand before touching Cas again.
When the door finally opens, Dean is struck once again with how empty, how void, of personal touches Cas’ room remained throughout the years, a stark reminder that Dean could have done more, could have done better, to get him to stay, to make him feel welcome. He does feel slightly ridiculous, stepping foot into the bedroom now, after avoiding it for so long. There’s nothing in here that was so terrifying for him to confront.
He’s about to say so when Sam and his impeccable timing come out of the bathroom in sweatpants and a t-shirt, trampling all over the moment. Might as well, Dean isn’t sure he wants to say that shit out loud.
“We’ll talk later,” he interrupts a little roughly, rougher than he intends, emotions bubbling to the surface as he leans away and starts fumbling with his bedding, making space for Cas to slide underneath. “Just rest for now,” Dean continues, pressing a hand to Cas’ shoulder, silently inviting him to lie down.
Dean feels it all the way down to his toes. Dean knows he’s not the most open of guys, he knows that, but surely Cas has to know. He has to know why Dean went back for him.
“What?” he says, half-whispers really. Cas thinks… Dean shakes his head, still frowning. How could they be misunderstanding each other so. “You think I went to get you to stop Chuck?” Dean finally asks, feeling a bit offended, though he’s not sure if it’s on Cas’ behalf or his.
But Dean has over a decade of arguing with him under his belt and he’s hardly intimidated by that tone anymore. “Cas, you’re a mess,” he says, aiming for stern but landing somewhere along the line of plaintiveness. Okay, not his best work, but he
And Dean knows that. Of course, he does, his hands are still tingling from the warmth of Cas’ skin against his fingers.
, his brain unhelpfully supplies, reminding him that he does, in fact, know. He dismisses the thought, as he always does when the topic of his time downstairs is brought to the front of his mind.
“That’s not a promise any of us can make Dean,” Cas says, matter-of-factly. Dean knows it doesn’t mean he doesn’t care, knows that it’s just Cas being Cas. It’s just his charming and disorientating, straight to the point, way of seeing the world that can be both hilarious and awkward at the same time. He knows that. But the nonchalance cuts through him like an angel blade either way.
“How to get you out of that Empty deal...” Dean finally says, though that’s an edited, simpler version of events.
They’re still taking cases, him and Cas – him and Sam too, though his brother likes hunting with Eileen more and more these days – but it’s with much less frequency now. And more and more, as he and Cas settle into this thing, Dean’s been thinking about a life beyond the bunker, a life beyond hunting.
“I was just thinking…” Dean trails off, thumbing his phone for a second before pressing it face down on the mattress, finally hiding it fully. They’ve been slowly easing themselves into this thing, this couple thing, enjoying each other between a case here and there, learning how to be better for each other, seeing how they fit, how they’ve always fitted. There is little that’s actually changed, apart from the physicality, if Dean’s honest with himself. Some days, he feels like he and Cas have always been like this. In love. A partnership. The only difference now is that Dean can say so. And Sam knows. But this? This is a big step… even if they’re already technically living together.
It seems rather unfair to leave him when they’ve been separated for so long, when they’ve been separated so often in their decade of friendship, but Dean physically cannot stay still right now without making himself sick with worry. He keeps opening and closing his fists while he stares at the sleeping angel – ex-angel – hands desperate for something to do, something to keep them busy.
After a while, he stops, stroking the back of Cas’ right ear with his knuckles before getting up and offering him a hand. Together, with Cas holding on tightly, they manage to dry the rest of his body, the gestures a lot more hurried, more methodical this time.
Sam’s going to move out soon. He hasn’t said it, but Dean knows the guy and he can tell him and Eileen are getting really serious, really fast. And they’re not going to raise his nieces and nephews underground; there’s no way. So maybe… maybe it’s time for the bunker to officially be a pit stop for hunters, a resource, and for Dean and Cas to have a proper home that’s theirs and no one else's….
Cas doesn’t laugh, thoroughly unsatisfied by Dean’s dismissal of his own suffering. But then, he always was; frowning disapprovingly every time a fake ‘I’m okay’ came tumbling out of Dean’s mouth over the years. Dean always wondered if Cas’ was too powerful to be lied to, or if he just always knew him too well and could see through the facade.
“I know I haven’t always treated you right,” Dean finally manages to say. It burns his throat on the way out. All he’s had since Cas last died for him, since Chuck was defeated, are his regrets.
. He won’t get angry when he’s scared. He won’t bristle when he feels so full to the brim with love that he’s choking on it. He won’t listen to the ghost of John Winchester in the back of his head telling him the only thing worse than having feelings for a man would be having them for a monster. But Dean is a fucking coward and a liar to boot. He’s made these promises to himself so many times and yet, here he is, almost ten years on, and Cas is comparing himself to
when he’s wanted to say sweetheart for years but never thought he deserved it, always thought Cas deserved more than that, more than him.
Cas is still shivering in his sleep, though Dean is doubtful it’s from the cold considering nothing is showing of him except small strands of dirty dark hair, his full body bundled under the covers.
For a second, Dean wonders if Cas knew it from the start, if he knew it in Hell, if he wanted back then before he truly knew what it meant. Did it creep up on him? The more he understood mankind? It certainly crept up on Dean, slowly and then all at once, until he understood he’d been there almost all along.
“But we don’t need to stop uh,” he mumbles to himself, rolling his eyes, and he startles when Cas chuckles in the back seat.
“What are you looking at?” Cas finally asks, looking over Dean’s shoulder, his voice even lower in the mornings, Dean’s favourite sound, soft but rough at the same time.
“Okay,” Dean replies, slowly turning Cas’ body towards the sink – closer than the toilet – just in case. “Just do what you gotta do, buddy,” he whispers, rubbing Cas’ back.
so he is nervous – but his entire body still lights up from the inside. Cas leans into him with a small hum, hands grabbing at Dean’s hips to keep him close when he tries to break the kiss.
“Yeah,” Dean agrees, fiddling with his car keys still in the ignition, trying to feel the exhaustion of the rough day he’s had. It should be here somewhere, but all he feels is that buzzing, that mix of anxiety and elation coursing through his veins. It’s like he’s shaking from the inside and it’s driving him a little mad. “Long day,” he add, mostly trying to convince himself.
– for him to be done before speaking again. “Seriously Cas, you scared me back there. How are you feeling?”
Cas eats in silence, clearly enjoying it while Dean enjoys watching him. He takes the soup first, carefully dipping tiny pieces of bread in it and humming happily as he eats them, and Dean tries not to blush at the thought that he did that, he made that little happy sound happen. Then, Cas eats the sandwich Dean made for him. Then, he requests a second one and eats that one too.
If Cas can believe in him enough to die for him, if Dean himself can tell God off for believing the worst of him, then maybe Dean can be the better version of himself from now on.
He doesn’t look like he’ll be able to take the blanket off his shoulders, let alone turn the shower on, but Dean isn’t going to hover. No matter how much his fingers hitch to do it all for him. There are some things a man – well, an ex celestial being newly turned human – is entitled privacy for. Cas deserves a moment alone, so Dean swallows back down his worry, his fear, his
now, not indulge the greedy selfish monster that lives inside of him, the one that orders his little brother around to protect him in his old man’s name, the one that’s so scared of being alone and will never say, the one that clings angrily and leaves claw marks on those he doesn’t want to let go of.
“Alright, well that’s good, right? Maybe… Maybe you just need to sleep some more, uh?” Dean offers, truly at loss.
He does end up telling Cas all about it. Around a plate of pancakes and a bottle of whiskey Dean managed to sneak into the diner, he talks about the hunt, about the kids, about Billie. He edits the peril he put himself into significantly and he doesn’t say anything about what it was like while Cas was gone – what it was like to miss him, to mourn him – but between big syrupy bites, he does talk about most of it.  Still, he doesn’t say anything about Jack either, though he’s sure it’s what Cas wants to hear about most of all. Any stories would be tainted by Dean’s own behaviour, his grief. He’s not sure he can examine any of it yet, especially not his change of heart. It’s funny how the whole Jack thing doesn’t seem so bad now that Castiel didn’t have to pay the ultimate price for the kid. Still, there’ll be much to discuss once they’re back to the bunker. Much to think about, much to plan for. But not tonight though. Not yet.
Cas hums. “Yes,” he replies, dark circles under his eyes. “I still feel…” he trails off, then shrugs, like the transformation and its effects are beyond words right now.
Instead of joking along, Cas reaches up to cradle Dean’s jaw, thumb soft, tender, against Dean’s skin and he has to close his eyes, suddenly overwhelmed by the gesture. After a second, Dean feels Cas’ lips press against the corner of his mouth, then his jaw, his other hand sliding under Dean’s shirt to reach his lower back where the skin is tender. Dean stiffens without meaning to, a small whimper, more pleasure than pain, shamefully escaping from the back of his throat. Cas’ fingers are light on Dean’s back, warm, and it’s barely a touch but Dean feels it like electricity through his entire body.
Sam nods, looking a little like a grumpy toddler. “Maybe this wasn’t such a bad idea,” he reluctantly admits with a yawn, awkwardly trying to stretch his long limbs over his head before opening the door and getting out.
“But… It wasn’t like this last time? ” Dean whispers and this is not something he particularly wants to revisit, old shame curling in his belly. Cas… Cas always deserved better than Dean could offer, he knows that. He knows all the specific ways he’s let him down over the years, the guilt of it never quite far from the front of Dean’s mind. Dean with his anger and the right words always getting stuck in his throat, the wrong ones spewing out of his mouth like bullets, the only language he ever learned to speak. “Are you… Are you sure there isn’t something actually wrong, Cas? You’re sure this isn’t like when Jack lost his grace? I mean, okay, you’re human, but you… you look ill, and –”
Dean tightens his right hand into a fist, trying to find the words to explain, trying to find words that aren’t too damning to express what it feels like when Castiel is gone, trying to find
If this were anyone else, Dean would choke on shame at this revelation. Has he been filled with anything but terrible longing for Castiel ever since they first met in that barn so many years ago? Ever since Cas first cradled his soul? Ever since Cas
“Would you like me to lie?” Cas asks, tilting his head in a gesture Dean has seen him do hundreds of times and suddenly, viciously, he’s reminded of who Castiel used to be, puzzled over humanity’s many quirks and customs.
“So,” Cas echoes, sliding his fingers into each other and letting them rest in front of his empty plate.
Cas swallows hard before nodding slowly. “I uh…” he clears his throat, loud, which leads him into a small coughing fit.
“Don’t ever do that again,” he finally says in a shaky voice when they’ve exited the car and started approaching their room. They’re only a few steps from the door and now is probably not the right time, but Dean doesn’t fully feel like himself, the truth on the tip of his tongue. He’s definitely not drunk, but he’s something.
It quickly becomes apparent that Cas isn’t well enough to make it there on his own, so Dean wraps his arm around Cas again and helps him in.
It comes out a little plaintive, a little desperate, but Dean can’t help but need reassurance that they
, that he’s going to have to face Cas for this. So he shakes his head, opens his eyes, and regrets it immediately. Cas looks
It’s easy like this. They don’t have to say anything, but Dean knows it can’t stay that way. He can’t let it.
“That’s alright,” Dean says as comfortingly as he can manage, taking a small step forward. “I’ve got you,” he adds, wrapping an arm around Cas’ waist to support him.
“You hungry?” Dean offers, though the memory of Cas’ being sick is still fresh in his mind. Instead of replying, Cas yawns very loudly, making Dean chuckle slightly. “Or maybe more sleep, uh?”
“It’s just…” Cas looks like he’s struggling for a second before settling on “growing pains.” Cas heaves once again – it looks painful – and, for a moment, Dean thinks he’s going to puke one more time so he slides his hand up, wrapping it around the nape of Cas’ neck in silent support. “I’ll be fine after I’ve rested.”
Once he gets to the door, he leaves his boots outside, silently opening it and peeking inside, reassured to see Cas is still deep in sleep. It seems peaceful too, no rustling under the covers or agitated turning back and forth the way Dean does almost every night. That’s good. The last thing Cas needs after everything is nightmares.
Dean shakes his head slowly. “Chuck is gone, Cas. He’s… He’s been gone a while now. He doesn’t have his powers anymore.”
So, cowardly in many ways, Dean sidesteps this landmine Cas laid on their friendship in his corpse’s wake.
“No,” Dean says forcefully, determined, interrupting Cas’ kind but irritating reassuring speech. He doesn’t understand, he never has, and Dean was always too much of a coward to explain, to tell the truth. He’s lost Cas so many times already and every time he gets him back, Dean thinks to himself
managed to roughen Cas up so thoroughly. Cas hums, leaning into the touch, and Dean is suddenly, violently, reminded of the Angel Castiel was, back when they first met, calculating and cold and powerful beyond a human brain’s comprehension, but orbiting Dean just the same, the two of them tangled together from the first second.
Usually, highly emotional situations rob him of his tongue, but now, nervous like he’s never been before, Dean can’t seem to shut the fuck up.
“Here,” Dean says gently, grabbing the glass of water he left on Cas’ nightstand and handing it to him, waiting patiently – okay, mostly impatiently, but Dean is
Once he’s better, Dean thinks, they’ll go on a trip. He’ll take Cas somewhere warm and nice, where he can lounge and let his skin pinken under the sun, somewhere with water to swim in, where they can be rocked softly, weightless, by the waves, by the beauty of the world they saved countless times but never enjoyed. Somewhere where Cas can eat good food, where he can
With most of the work he set for himself done, Dean exhales slowly, both hands resting on the machine, head bowed down, in his boxer, letting seconds pass until he actually starts feeling the cold against his naked skin.
The waitress catches his eyes across the room. She looks down at the bottle in his hands, then frowns disapprovingly. He’s not drunk or anything, but he’s starting to feel a little buzzed and he’s not quite in the mood to be schooled by a twenty-something who memorized the rulebook.
Cas looks down at himself, at Dean’s hand on his coat. He pauses, his face completely blank before frowning. Then, he looks back up at Dean and shrugs. He hadn’t even noticed, of course not.
Where they stand is on the edge of a precipice and Dean is working up the courage to let himself go, to
Their eyes meet in the rearview mirror again, the tension between them cackling for half a second before Dean looks away. He can’t help but wonder, not for the first time, if he’s the only one who feels that electricity in the air when they stare at each other a little too long, a little too close. He can’t be, right? Then again, Castiel is an angel of the Lord, no matter how many times his allegiances have changed. Who knows what goes on in that head of his.  Besides, it doesn’t matter. It’s not something to dwell on. Or, more specifically, it’s not something he allows himself to dwell on.
Dean makes his way across the kitchen in two strides, has his arms around Cas’ shoulders, pressing their bodies tight together before he even has time to decide he’s going to do it, Cas’ little ‘oh’ muffled against Dean’s chest as they hug.
He should probably text Sam back at some point too before he drives to the bunker in a panic that Dean off-ed himself in a drunken grief-fueled rage. No matter how much Dean told him he was
Cas closes his eyes, then sighs. “Dean,” he says, exhaustion in his voice the way only a celestial beam of light that’s lived through several millennia can express it.
“No,” he replies, voice more hoarse, more tender than he means it to. “Same handsome face, same ugly trenchcoat,” he teases, throat tightening a little on the word ‘handsome’. It’s true, but he rarely lets himself say it. A second passes, then another one, before Dean squints a little. “Although,” he adds, slightly uncertain, “did the Empty give you a makeover?” He reaches across the table to feel the fabric of the coat, a little irritated at the thought of a cosmic being messing around with what he’s long considered
They look at each other in silence for a beat, before Dean chuckles, looking away. This is his best friend. And he doesn’t know what to say. Luckily, he doesn’t have to torture himself very long, because Cas speaks again, a serious look on his face when Dean looks back at him.
Seeing Cas so vulnerable is harder than he thought it would be, it tugs at something in his lower belly, makes him shake with a fierce need to wrap him up in his arms and never let go again. Not after the Empty, not after all the ways he’s lost him before. Except Dean needs to take care of
Dean smiles softly, unable to stop himself, and if it’s more fond than he’d normally like to let on then that’s his business. “Yeah, welcome to humanity again pal. It comes with all sorts of discomfort.”
“There we go,” Dean continues to babble as he crouches down next to the tub, turning the water on, adjusting the temperature, fiddling a bit to waste time, trying to fill in the silence with as many inane things as he can in a vain attempt to be comforting.
. And he’s lost Cas before but this time, he saw the light that was Castiel leave his vessel, he saw the scorched marks of his wings on the ground, and he supposes a dead body is a dead body no matter what animated it before, but it felt particularly empty without the heavenly host. It felt wrong.
“Sammy,” Dean whispers, putting a hand on Sam’s shoulder, making a soft noise in the back of his throat when his brother gasps awake a little too abruptly. It comes to him naturally, almost forty years of soothing Sammy’s nightmares under his belt now. “Let’s get you to bed, uh?”
Dean nods, tightening his grip on Cas’ hand. “Of course. Once you’re properly rested, I’ll tell you everything.”
“It does,” Dean manages to say, choked up. He shakes his head, tightening his jaw as he looks away. Slowly, he passes a hand over his cheek, catching a tear. Why is this so hard? Licking his lower lip, Dean faces Cas again, nodding at him from across the kitchen table. “It does,” he repeats and this time, he lets himself smile back.
Dean watched Cas get stabbed and he had to try and carry on, coming to the unfortunate conclusion that he didn’t want to do so without him.
He doesn’t think there’s a word that’s been invented yet for all the things that Cas has come to mean for him. And if there is one, Dean, with his GED and his practical brain, doesn’t know it.
He’s not the one who is going to make that choice though, not after what Cas said. They fought so hard for their damned free will, Dean isn’t going to decide for both of them by not saying shit. He’s an option. He can be an option. As soon as he gets the courage to bring it up.
Once they’re done, Dean turns off the water and when he turns back to look at him, Cas has his arms wrapped around his legs, head bowed against his knees. For a second, Dean wonders if he’s praying, but Cas doesn’t know about Jack yet, doesn’t know about Chuck, doesn’t know anything that’s happened since he was taken. Though, Dean supposes, Castiel might not have killed the habit even after learning the God he spent so long devoted to was unworthy of it. Dean certainly never stopped praying to Cas, even after he died. He suspects he’ll pray to Cas until the day he bites it, even if he can’t hear it anymore. Watching him now, human and
Time isn't important in heaven. One day, weeks or just a breath. Time runs differently up here. Feels different.  A year can be a day. So Dean doesn't count time and doesn't pay attention to it.
“Do you have your Angel Blade?” Dean joked one time. Cas looked confused, he didn't get it. Nevermind. Dean kissed him and all other things are not important.
"This reminds me of a quote, you know," Castiel says after a while, and the knowing smile on Dean's face is no surprise.
A flurry of images zooms past the window where Castiel gazes out. Lights— red, green, blue, yellow; and buildings— small, big, short, tall— all pass by in a haze, as if in a film roll. That is when Castiel realizes,
Dean straightens, eyebrows knit together as he turns back to stare at the wall, the beer in his hand lowering with uncertainty.
of being untouched? God, I could smell you from miles away and knew you'd got a hole that's never been filled before. Don't worry though, I'll keep the fucking for later."
"Mh— De—" Castiel tried to warn, but with his mouth full of cock, he could do nothing but mumble as he came, painting Dean's hand white. Dean's eyes fluttered open and he glanced back at his hand, now sticky with Castiel's come, and smirked.
"She's beautiful," Dean whispered, and Castiel turned his head back to where Lisa had disappeared around the corner. Something felt strange in the air between them, and Castiel hitched his jacket, no,
With an uncertain coil in his gut, Castiel steps to the wall, leaning closer until his face is inches from the wallpaper.  "Hello?"
cares for, is his potential partner speaks, what they say, how they treat everybody around them. Needless to say, Castiel has high expectations from a partner. In essence, they need to be Castiel's friend before he would ever consider them as a lover.
Dean laughs, but his fingers reach up to his face. Mindlessly, he traces his thumb down the scar that runs down from the top of his right eyebrow to the bottom of his left cheek. The raised skin doesn't hurt any longer, but the touch of his thumb to the scar reminds him of a time he despised looking at his face. A constant reminder of one of Dean's deadliest combat experiences.
There's a rising irritation in Dean's voice, but Castiel reminds himself he's the one who started it and lets it slide.
"There's this diner, Donnie's diner, cheap, convenient, pretty empty in the mornings, hella’ crowded in the evenings. They got amazing burgers, Cas. Anytime I needed some grease, that's where I'd go. It’s a little far, not much, but we’ll get there faster with the car."
. Their tears fall to the ground, but their lips never part as Castiel drinks in the taste of his lover's lips, restraining a sob that threatens to rise at the back of his throat. A few long seconds later, Dean pulls away at last. Castiel steps back, not wanting to prolong Dean's departure, and watches as Dean leans back against his car.
"I— I saved up money, and I worked overtime," Castiel stuttered, his head hung down in shame and guilt, as his lips curled into a pout and he blinked away a few stray tears.
"Oh," She grinned, "-lovely. That's lovely." Her eyes dimmed for a moment, and Castiel watched as her shoulders loosened, as if she were dejected, "-The house could do with some laughter."
"I erm, I got your gift too. I was going to give it to mom, but she told me to give it to you myself."
At once, Dean falls back down on something firm, something moving, and he turns around, stunned to find himself sitting atop Castiel's chest, who simply fixes him with a stoic look, and with a soft, mumbled apology, Dean pushes himself up to his feet, right when Sam holds his gun up to the witch's head, and—
A laugh slipped past Castiel's lips unbidden, and before he knew it, there were broad, tender arms sliding around his chest, pulling him into a hug, and for the first time in days, Castiel let himself have it.
"Surprise, surprise, you're in love with the angel," Rowena scoffs, brushing her hand off as if the words she says mean nothing at all, "-honestly, boy, it's been a long time coming. I mean, all these years of dilly-dallying? Gosh, I'd rather go straight to town on the second date. Can't keep up with all the pining." She chirps and inspects her fingernails, an air of indifference exuding off of her.
"Couldn't have said it better," the man chuckles, and Castiel smiles at the sound, prompted to recall a fitting quote about their situation.
Right as Sam settles down next to him with his own bottle of beer, the sound of a door shutting in the distance has both brothers snapping their heads up towards the passage. Dean holds his breath for a second, watching as Rowena walks out of the narrow passageway, the bowl of a strange-smelling pulp in her hands. Her lips are turned down, a strange sort of confusion written over her face, and Dean shares a look with Sam before turning back to Rowena. She lifts her gaze, now aware of being in the brothers' presence, and eyes both of them with an odd suspicion, before setting the bowl down at the edge of the table and pulling a chair out for herself. Unabashedly, she grabs Sam's bottle, who appears to want to argue, but holds himself back, and takes a swig of it.
It sounds surreal. He can't leave. Not so out of the blue. Sure, yeah, Sam is right, Dean doesn't have a job— but it's for a reason. He wanted to take a few months off before returning to civilian life. And what does Sam care if he's dating anyone or not? Does he really think anybody would want to date someone with a face like Dean's?
Part of him knows better. Part of him knows it's best if they never meet. Besides, Castiel doesn't appear to be inclined towards speaking to him anymore. Not that Dean blames him. Truth be told, Dean wants to see Castiel just as much as Castiel wants to see him, but he knows it would only complicate whatever is between them.
In the void constricting around him, he manages to ground himself down, manages to remain strong, to keep fighting, for Cas, for himself, for Jack, for Sam, for love.
Before Dean can intrude any further, he hears a soft whimper from a few feet away, and at once, with his instinct on high alert, he freezes.
Dean let his mouth fall open as he turned to Garth, and sent him a wide, charming grin. He let go of Castiel's waist, and walked over to catch Garth's hand in a firm, strong handshake. Garth smiled, obviously charmed by Dean, for Castiel knew nobody was immune to Dean. Besides being an alpha, he was confident and self-assured, and Dean had such a big, bright presence, it was hard to not feel overwhelmed by his side.
"I can't risk you Cas, you're my- you're my everything. I don't care if I die, okay? But you, I can't lose you, or Sam, and Crowley? He's a sick son of a bitch. He'll kill me the same way he makes me kill the others. He won't touch me, Cas, not a bit, but he'll make me watch as he picks you apart, piece by piece. He'll make me watch as kills you. I'm not strong enough for that, Cas, I'm not-" A sob tears through the air, and Castiel turns at once, reaching to pull Dean into his arms as Dean squeezes him, "-I'm not strong, I'm not-"
"Fuck," Dean groaned, rocking his hips and fucking into Castiel's hole, making sure Castiel could feel every thrust and drag. He slid a hand up and crept it under his blouse, caressing his chest until he could feel the tiny nub of Castiel's nipple brush against his finger. At the first touch, Castiel let out a breathy moan, and Dean watched as his eyes rolled to the back of his head before fluttering shut. From where Dean was watching, Castiel looked nothing short of an X-rated movie star, body jerking with every thrust, mouth hung open, eyes shut and hands holding his legs open like the perfect whore. The thought only spurred Dean on, and he found himself going faster, harder— fucking into Castiel's hole with a newfound vigour and pinching his nipples between his fingers.
"Good boy," Dean smiled, and dropped a trail of soft, lingering kisses between Castiel's shoulder blades.
Rowena turns around, fixing Dean and Sam a dry look as she says, "-I see you're picking up on the Winchester lingo, eh? Not a problem– now, angel, I'm going to figure out what's wrong with you with a wee little spell, and for that, I need you to lie down, shut your eyes, and concentrate on your breathing. Can you do that for me?"
"No, what I'm telling you," Blue heaves a breath, his voice stern and resolute, "-is that despite these flaws, you deserve to be happy. You deserve to fall in love with whoever you want, you deserve to do the things you love, and you deserve to live life your way."
"God, such a slut for my finger, aren't you? I wish you could see what I'm seeing right now. It's gorgeous, Cas, gorgeous. If you'd'a told me you had such a pretty little hole before, and that it swallowed up my finger so
And then, after Castiel wakes up at three on the dot, every afternoon, he'll knock on the wall, yell out a ‘
Castiel gulps and slips his feet into his sneakers, waiting for the man to follow up on his answer. Instead, he goes silent, and Castiel takes that as a cue to brush past the topic. "My apologies, I didn't mean to pry."
"Fuck," Castiel panted, rocking back on Dean's fingers, meeting Dean's thrusts in-sync, his knuckles white from holding onto the edge of the countertop. Dean slid his own hands into Castiel's, while the other slid forward to wrap around Castiel's cock, pumping in lousy strokes at first, increasing his pace when he felt Castiel clench his ass on Dean's tongue. Dean pulled away, licking his lips to swallow down every last taste of Castiel, before pushing a second finger inside Castiel's wet, sloppy hole, thrusting them in to his knuckles, until the cold metal of Dean's rings rubbed against Castiel's pucker and he gasped.
Dean smiles. He loves hearing Castiel speak in the morning or late at night, when his words are easy and languid— like that of a young child.
So, he grabs a pen from a stand on the desk, and writes down his phone number on the back of the flyer, accompanied by the word
Sam seems to disregard Dean's taunt, continuing, "-Check it, right now. I sent you the documents in-case you want to move in this month, and there's a few notices from the neighbours, since it's supposed to be a quote-unquote, ‘
Dean's eyes harden, lips twitching in a frown at Castiel's tone. They don't touch their half-eaten burgers then, because Castiel feels his eyes cloud with tears the moment Dean's lips tremble.
The sound of fabric ripping drew Castiel's attention to it, and he glanced back to find Dean tearing through the cloth of his dark-green suit to free his cock from the confines of the fabric.
And now here he was, in Dean's room, which had been locked but Castiel had in a fit of rage broken the door knob, needing some semblance of an alpha scent to calm his nerves and put him out of his misery, but soon enough, once he'd spotted the messily made bed, he hadn't been able to restrain himself, and like an unhinged beast, he'd thrown his slick-soaked underwear to the floor, hopped up on Dean's bed, where Dean's pure alpha musk flooded his senses, and began fucking himself on his fingers, rubbing his ass over Dean's bedsheet, promising himself he'd do the laundry later.
Castiel's little secret. He was utterly, irrevocably in love with his best friend. What a fucking clichè, no?
A silence lulls in the air and Dean fears the conversation will end sooner than he'd like it to. This guy, Blue, he sounds cool. Like a guy you could share a couple beers with, sit with under the stars, and talk about life, and the universe.
"Dude, you just need to brush your hair and get some coffee. You're good to go. Besides, we're having so much fun at my place, it feels weird you not being there."
"Fuck," he groans, and slips his arms under Castiel's waist. With a measured breath, he lifts him into his arms and hauls him up. Castiel chuckles, wrapping his legs tight around Dean's waist, as he leans down to nip at Dean's ear. Dean glances up at Castiel in his arms, a wide, raunchy grin on his face as he carries Castiel to their new bedroom.
Dean's voice is soft, and their eyes meet in the rearview mirror when Dean laces his fingers through Castiel's and gives it a squeeze. Castiel lets his hand linger in Dean's, lets the warmth between them settle, lets the silence between them hang, and his eyes wander out the window.
"I won't say you did what you had to do, because you made a choice, Mr.Green, the consequences of which you must have known. All I can say is that we all do bad things. But life goes on, and though we can't ask for forgiveness, we can always choose to learn and grow."
"No, no, it belongs to an angel. The angel Cassiel. My mother was a devout Christian, and my father a hippie. They went crazy naming their kids. So I have brothers named after angels, Michael, Gabriel—"
At once, Castiel is picking up his feet and walking into the bedroom, and this time, he slams the door shut behind him, making sure Dean's confused yells and pleas of ‘
"Yes. I—." As much as Castiel would love to spend more time speaking to the man, getting to know him, understand him, laugh with him, he has work to attend to. "I have to leave now. My shift starts at eleven."
Castiel groans, and Dean feels his body twitching under him, before at once, Castiel is taking control of his own actions, much to Dean's joy, and pulling away.
Dean pauses, setting his knife down as he grabs the phone in his hand, eyes throwing a furtive glance at the stove.
"Need you to fuck me till I can't walk straight. Fill me up with your pups alpha, mark me up, breed me, use me,
"Now, boy, this won't hurt at all, it will tickle a bit, but I need you to remain silent at all times. It is imperative that I complete this spell. Alright?" Rowena asks and pulls away to grab the bowl set on the nightstand.
Mary Oliver? He recalls reading a few of her poems on the internet, and he has been meaning to buy one of her collections for ages, and this? This is precisely what he needed. A wide grin spreads across his face as he flips the paperback open, a peculiar urge inside him compelling him to hold the book up to his face and fill his lungs with the scent of the used book; the scent of the browning pages.
Castiel’s face remains unreadable for a moment before he gives a soft smile and looks away, towards the garden behind Dean, and it allows Dean a free moment to drink in the sight of Castiel's face
But even then, he'd ended up stumbling into Dean in their shared classes. Dean had smiled at him, and Castiel had met his eyes for a moment, before settling at the seat farthest from Dean. Of course, Castiel had felt Dean's eyes linger on his skin, before shifting, and the moment they turned away, Castiel was letting out a breath he never knew he'd held. Once the bell rung, he had shuffled out of the class faster than he could even say the word
"Oh fuck," Castiel hissed, as he let go of a leg, using his free hand to slide it under his skirt and stroke himself. He hooked his leg around Dean's neck, pulling Dean closer until their faces were inches apart, and the moment his blue eyes fluttered open, Dean dove down to crash his lips against Castiel's, not letting the man adjust to his lips before shoving his tongue into Castiel's mouth. Their bodies rocked on their own accords, and Dean found himself losing his senses with every passing second as he drank in every last taste of Castiel's lips. Castiel moaned and hummed into the kiss, rolling his tongue around Dean's and sucking Dean's lips into his mouth. Spit drooled down the sides of their lips, but Dean didn't care, he continued to taste as much of Castiel as he could, until Castiel's head fell back, and his eyes rolled shut.
"Bite me," Castiel groaned, expecting another slap, or perhaps even a punch, but it never came. His eyes fluttered open, and he found Dean smiling.
Castiel throws a wide-eyed glance towards Alicia who seems quite engrossed in her phone, typing away furiously with a blank expression. He turns away, inching his lips closer to the microphone as his face stings with heat, and his words quiver.
"Sorry, erm," Dean swallows, finding himself at a loss for words, as he helps Castiel sit up, and pushes himself up as well.
The melody breaks off as the loud whoomping noise draws both Castiel’s and his student's attention. At first, Castiel glances at his kitchen, wondering if something dropped from one of the shelves, but Jack nudges his shoulder, tipping his head
Castiel swipes up and presses the phone to his ear, pushing himself up on his feet as he strolls over to the window behind him.
, I need to know everything. So, who will it be? The handsome, tall one, or the love-sick puppy?" she grins, and Dean feels the exceptional urge to punch the grin right off Rowena's wicked, bright face, but he keeps his impulses in check, and resorts to a simple snarl.
With a sigh, Castiel grabs his earphones and searches for his phone, which he's sure he put on the coffee table some time ago. Maybe he'll catch up on a podcast; he's been trying to find the time for one for a few days now, but somehow, work always interferes. He feels fresh, having woken up from his sleep not more than three hours ago, which keeps him on his toes all through the evening.
"Not much. I'll practice the keys. It's been quite a while since I sat down at my piano. I'll watch a little television, read a page or two. I'm not sure. What about you?"
Castiel pulls away, gasping for air and swaying on his feet, before rocking forward into Dean's arms. Resting his forehead against Dean's, arms sliding around Dean's neck, he presses close into the heat of Dean's body.
Castiel doesn't comment. He simply grabs the remnants of his burger and chews. Dean pinches the bridge of his nose as he sighs, eyes shut and eyebrows knit in frustration.
“Just let me,” Dean whispers as he leans down, sliding one hand on the back of Cas’ neck, the other reaching down, blinding trying to grab Cas’ hand and landing somewhere in the pocket of the bathrobe he’s still wearing. Dean grasps the fabric uselessly as he presses their lips together and okay, it’s a little clumsy – he hasn’t done this with a guy, with anyone really, in…. a while, and it’s
He looks like the most amazing thing Dean’s ever seen in his entire fucking life and there aren’t any words to fully express that so he settles for something small and insignificant like
“I’m… not sure,” Cas admits after a while, and when Dean looks back at his face, his mouth is turned down in clear displeasure. At the pain or the weakness, Dean can’t quite tell. Perhaps both.
Cas is probably going to be a while and Dean is going to drive himself crazy if he just sits down and watches him sleep for hours, no matter how much he wants to. And fuck, he really wants to. But it’s an indulgence he won’t allow himself, not when there’s such a mess for him to clean up in the library.
Dean slides into the room carefully, barely pushing on the door to close it, making sure he’s as silent as possible. Though he’s pretty certain with how exhausted he is, Cas could sleep through the next apocalypse.
“Cas?” Dean asks, uncertain, and instead of replying, Cas lets go of his face and his back at the same time, the warmth of him suddenly, brutally, gone, even though he hasn’t even moved away.
“No,” he repeats, angry at himself for having called Cas his brother one time too many in an attempt to stifle his own feelings. “No,” he says once more, a whisper this time and maybe the third time’s the charm because he decides right here and there that he’s not gonna do this shit to himself anymore. He’s never going to witness Cas’ death again with nothing but regrets on his lips. So he reaches for that new trench coat he isn’t quite sure he likes, and he drags Cas into a biting kiss, years of yearning finally coming to fruition.
Dean nods to himself, passing a shaky hand through his hair before finally going to his bedroom, rummaging through his drawers for something good for Cas to wear. He tries not to overthink it too much, grabbing the loosest sweatpants he owns and a soft, almost threadbare, henley. Then, he gets a big fluffy towel and his bathrobe, just in case.
For a while, Cas stays silent behind him and Dean wonders if he’s misread this. If maybe… maybe Cas enjoys hunting and the bunker and doesn’t want to give all of it up the way Dean finds himself longing for more and more. Maybe… Maybe they’re not on the same page about this.
After what feels like an eternity of silence where Dean is too shocked to press the issue, Cas finally tilts his head, stops looking at the dirty floor, soiled with black goo and bodily fluid, and meets Dean’s eyes. The last time they looked at each other head-on, Cas died and Dean’s heart squeezes painfully in his chest at the reminder. For a long second, it feels like time slows down, then, Cas nods in answer to Dean’s question, a small, almost imperceptible gesture, and the moment is broken.
“Are you alright?” Cas asks carefully and when Dean opens his eyes, he’s looking at him like he’s always looked at him, intense and sharply focused, except now, Dean knows what it means, knows it means
At least one thing he didn’t fuck up today, Dean thinks distractedly, turning back towards his bedroom.
A myriad of emotions passes on Cas’ face as he takes in what Dean just said, what he implied, what it might
Dean shushes Cas comfortingly instead of saying so, his hand heavy on Cas’ naked back. Touching him anywhere but where his hand is pressed feels like a minefield and it’s such a stupid thing to worry about at a time like this that Dean hates himself for it the minute he thinks it. But he thinks it.
It’s like an angel blade between the ribs, precise and sharp, the pain of the matter-of-factly way Cas expresses his gratitude, like Dean is going out of his way taking care of him, like he’s doing him a favour, like Cas is some sort of
Cas is going to wake up soon. Eventually. He’s going to wake up and they’re going to talk. They’ll have to. After months of saying nothing about what happened, after months of Sam’s pitying glances, the unspoken truth tense between them like an elastic band about to snap, the thought is a little heady, a little dizzying. He knows what he wants, yet, when Cas looked at him
