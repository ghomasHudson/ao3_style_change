“Oh, no. It’s just…okay you’ll probably just laugh… but when I was at the shop I thought about all the things that you aren’t able to do and never will again.”
Sherlock waved with his hand.
When they both sobered John looked at Sherlock with a serious gaze. Then he stepped a bit closer to Sherlock.
“Anyway, I picked an Alpha for you. You’re going to meet him in four weeks and bond with him four weeks later. His name is Sebastian Wilkes and he’s a really handsome, thirty-year-old man. You won’t fight me or him. Is this clear?”
Sherlock reacted with a small half-smile. He looked relieved as he squeezed John’s hands. “Thank goodness. I love you, too.”
Everything worked really fine and Sherlock almost felt like he got everything he had wanted but something important bothered him.
Sherlock woke up with a weird feeling.
Sherlock let his heated gaze sweep over John’s whole body and John felt like never before, having all the attention on his.
“Don’t be that childish, dear brother. But this will lead me to my mean concern. Did you even think anything of all this through? You are depending on Dr Watson. If he dies you die too.”
Sherlock looked like a deer in the headlights, skittish but frozen and unsure, while John turned slowly around, his face a dangerous red colour.
When he was about to step out of his room he froze.
“I’ll make it. I’ll bring you back into life.”
Everyone in the room froze, including the DJ. The music stopped.
He cleared his throat.
“Because of the same reason why you’re still here, listening to me. You believe me.”
Sherlock just acknowledged that with a nod.
He dared to crack his eyes open. The room was dim. That was very good for his eyes which burned. They started to tear but he didn’t want to close them again. He was alive. He was really undeniably alive and back. Admittedly he felt really bad but that was okay because this was a proof for his liveliness.
They were brilliant, the most clever family I have ever known.
The coat was dramatic and the collar let Sherlock look even more mysterious.
“Just blame me. She’ll understand.”
John heard his heart pounding loud in his ears. Now was the time, he would see Sherlock’s body.
“Yes, Mrs Hudson told me about that. She said you were really excited. But wait…a consulting detective?”
Evolution had made the mankind weaker and weaker, burying their instincts under layers of rational explications. Unlike animals. That was a challenge worth accepting – fighting with animals. Against them and for them at the same time, trying to re-learn from them the essence of being alive.
After he went shopping at the grocery store, he went back to his house.
He raised a hand and offered it to Sherlock who just looked at it unbelieving.
“Um…where do you want me to sleep?”
After tea being served his mother began to speak and he blended her and anyone else out as best as he could.
After a while of begging the bangs stopped. He opened his eyes. Nothing. He was alone.
What was he now?
John flinched although he didn’t feel it. He heard Lestrade gasp and so Sherlock put his hand back and looked expectantly at Lestrade.
Sherlock hesitated a moment but then began.
“I see - and what do you do for a living? I mean, do you even have a job?”
They reluctantly let go of each other first sighing and then chuckling. Then John felt the need to finally say it.
John reached out and put his hand on Sherlock’s cheek.
John went to the kitchen to clean the used cups when he saw how Molly approached Sherlock who was reading in some documents Lestrade had given him.
“Can I ask you something?”
Sherlock turned his head so he was facing him as well smiling.
John yawned and then opened his eyes.
Sherlock beamed at him.
Another bang.
“Whatever it is, please tell me. It’s my father we are talking about.”
“I mean what you said to your brother. Did you mean it that I’m the main reason you wanted to be alive again?”
Lestrade was just walking through the entry of Scotland Yard when he heard the familiar voice of Sherlock who was lecturing Anderson about the simplicity of photosynthesis.
Then John nudged him and laughed.
“Was that necessary?”
He was looking forward to it.
That made Sherlock almost chuckle but he winced before it could come out.
Currently, Sherlock was standing awkwardly in their kitchen and looking anxiously at the Alpha who was watching him very suspiciously.
“I should have known. My father, your grandfather, always warned me about such men.”
He walked to John and hugged him.
“That- John, was the missing part. I found it. I solved it.”
Without meaning to Sherlock barred his teeth and snarled. This reaction shocked him that much that he was back in reality, blinking.
John cleared his throat.
Hearing that sound John walked into the room.
Sherlock then leaned himself against the wall next to John. “So…are you alright?”
John chuckled at that and went to his bed to sleep like a baby.
“Right. Okay. Let’s see… I would wander through this city, look what’s different and check in my homeless network if everything is still all right. Then I would buy some cigarettes and smoke them all. Hm… oh then I would get my violin and play it.”
But Sherlock knew that this wasn’t possible.
“John!”
They reached the door this time and opened it unchallenged - only for it to collide with someone on the other side of it.
“Tell me how you would know that?”
“Ah, you’re home! Great! Now make yourself a cup of tea and sit down! We have a lot to discuss!”
Sherlock grabbed his hair, pulled and groaned.
“Could you please not vanish as soon as you’re feeling uncomfortable?”
John found his father sitting alone at one of the tables along the edge of the dance floor. He hesitated, but pushed on and sat down next to him.
John laughed but went to help him. This time they didn’t need that much time to manage the stairs.
They were incredibly proud of her and couldn’t help but visit London more often than they should.
“So… okay were where we?”
“No! It’s not. Do you know how I found out about your death?”
“What is it?”
Instead, he disappeared in his bedroom.
Today he knew that he would never be able to stop thinking about him but he had been unknowing.
“Are you sure? I mean, I don’t think that your father wants anyone to know. It’s just bad luck for him that I can read people that easily.”
Sherlock just shook his head determined and so John took the steps with him. It took them almost twenty minutes until they reached the bathroom where John made Sherlock sit on the toilet lid.
As soon as they entered the room, John and Sherlock froze. John stood in the living room, the ruined jumper in his hands, while Sherlock was standing in front of his microscope in the kitchen, burned material under the scope.
“Look, it was all a bit of a shock to me. But I thought about what you said, and I think that maybe you’re right.”
They now lived happily in a cottage in Sussex, Sherlock was keeping bees and John had published their cases as a book.
Sherlock shot him a ‘really?’ look and sighed.
First, he had a terrible nightmare and then the bangs happened. He was overwhelmed by panic again but this time he stayed in bed.
He sat down with her and she insisted on him to call her by her first name Francesca. Then he told her everything that had happened but she dismissed it as a result of stress.
Sherlock opened his mouth to object again but John pulled him into a kiss.
“Welcome to my world, John. Oh and you passed it by the way. But please let us talk about something different than my insufferable brother.”
That made Sherlock stop mid-walking. He shot John a curious look. When John had sobered, he asked him why he was laughing and when he had explained to him, Sherlock’s corner of the mouth lifted.
“I’m so happy for you!”
John pursed his lips but nodded.
But they had never belonged to those who bought Omegas like their friends in this class of society always had done.
He didn’t understand how someone that arrogant in other areas could be that shy in such things.
“But this doesn’t mean that you’re a ghost. Maybe you’re just a normal human.”
“What?”
John beamed at him and then started laughing.
“Oh, my apologies. May I… er, wash my hands? Or perhaps you need to…?”
He could taste himself on John and it was amazing but he needed more.
John urged him to keep talking.
“Oh…I see. So you I don’t know… just slept with her?”
That was it. John just stared at the body in front of him.
“No. I can only touch things that aren’t alive.”
Alone the thought that he was erect due to causing Sherlock pain made him nauseates.
“Sally, nothing has changed as I see. Anderson is still sleeping with you when his wife is out of town. What can I say? Everyone needs a hobby.”
Sherlock started in a detached voice and a blank expression on his face.
Sherlock felt almost giddy thinking about that.
“Of course I do. I spent my whole day with you.”
Still handcuffed John arrived with Lestrade at his house. It was clear that the second man was still convinced that John was, in fact, guilty and that he hoped that he would find some evidence against him at this place.
Ten minutes later he came back just looking expectantly at John.
Now Sherlock looked uncomfortable.
Great moment to realize that, applause for the detective, he thought.
“Do you just say that because you don’t want to hurt my feelings or are you honest?”
John’s eyes went wide.
“Do you want me to help you? I mean with the clothes?”
Sebastian let him go and began to dress again and gave Sherlock’s mother a charming smile what almost caused the Omega to vomit.
“You mean after so many awkward monthly dinners, where they tried to show us how accepting they are?”
“I don’t high-five.”
“There’s absolutely no need to raise your voice here, darling. Your whole behaviour is absolutely inappropriate for an Omega and you know it. I let you your freedom as long as I still had hope for you to become reasonable. But even I have reached my limits.”
John thanked her, and as soon as he’d finished the chore, he sifted through the mail - and nearly fainted.
Sherlock laughed. “Sure. We had a really hard case to solve, with a lot of bodies, and I was really frustrated so I yelled at a few incompetent police people. Then  I suddenly had a breakthrough, came to a sudden realisation, and  just told everyone what happened and solved the case. And when I looked around, everyone looked completely baffled, but John was just staring at me with this weird look on his face, and then he marched up to me, grabbed my face and kissed me. Then he fell on his knee and asked me if I wanted to marry him. For a moment I was so perplexed that I couldn’t say anything, and then I recovered and said yes. The end.”
“Your husband? May I ask what happened?”
“Liam Bellamy.” He mockingly offered her a hand she couldn’t shake, paralyzed in an unnatural position as she was. For the first time since he shot her, he looked briefly into her eyes and crouched over her intertwined legs.
“Why not?”
John was beaming at him and Sherlock was avoiding his gaze, feeling uncomfortable about his own outburst.
“What did you do?!”
When he came back that day Sherlock was indeed still there, pacing while muttering with himself.
John woke up with a groaning.
They knew the only reason they were invited was that everyone wanted to see their daughter.
His hand didn’t shake.
Hereby I’m giving you my blood for the gift of life,
“I’ll explain later.”
Sherlock took a deep breath and looked in his flatmate’s eyes.
Sherlock nodded.
Slowly everything that was sunken in got fuller until it looked like a sleeping person except for the greyish skin.
Lestrade inclined his head in acknowledgement. “Anyway, we need to go through a few details again with the police. Would you come with me?”
His eyes started tearing against his will and he tossed the supplies into the dirt.
John had to laugh even harder at this but sobered pretty quickly.
Sherlock’s “eyes” were made of silver-blue buttons but the other one got dark blue ones.
Sherlock craved his touches and although he loved being intimate with John, he loved the quiet days even more.
Today was the day where he would meet Sebastian Wilkes.
Good God, the thought alone Sherlock could have been that desperate for companionship that he picked a young naïve Omega and seduced him or her ,made him shudder until this day.
“What does that mean? Are you saying that we’re a couple now?”
He was standing up now and walking towards the living room.
Sherlock laughed.
John deserved a perfect Omega.
He wiped his eyes with his arms and stood up.
“Why? What did they say?”
“Okay… so I found your Liam Bellamy and everything you said about his wife and daughter is correct. He was a zoo veterinarian back then and that explains how he could get that equipment and how he could be such a good shooter with it. Well… the problem now is that he’s no longer living here. He migrated to Africa four months after everything happened - I know pretty cliché-like. Mr Bellamy lives now in the city Balfour in the province Mpumalanga which is in South Africa. It’s a bloody one-horse town!”
“I think it’s time to go.”
“No! No! Please no! Stop it!”
Sherlock just gave him an unimpressed look and continued staring at himself at the mirror in disgust.
His shoulders were tense and so although his face was neutral, it was obvious.
I won’t let you lock me up somewhere because I like it here and enjoy my life as a free man way too much so no thank you for that.
Then Lestrade said that he would tell them if he found something new and they all said their farewells but Molly.
Now he was definitely losing his mind, there was no doubt.
His dad swallowed and tore his gaze away from John, focusing instead on Sherlock.
Across of them sat his nightmare with a smug smile on his face which twisted Sherlock’s stomach uncomfortably.
“So, you said ten years ago. Your daughter must be a pretty young lady by now, hm?”
Sherlock froze and John noticed and gave him a reassuring smile.
“So where’s your ghost?”
“Is everything alright?”
Yes, he could smell it.
Sure he had had a bit more mood swings which had made for him no difference because there had been no one to share it with and there had been some body parts that had been growing immensely.
It was torture to see how his partner was becoming slowly smaller and smaller.
“I actually don’t believe in ghosts.”
John decided it was time to return to work and so he called his workplace to let them know that he would come back.
But this one here had a smile. They had used a lot of little stones for him.
“Really?”
“Oh, how impolite of me not to introduce myself. I’m Mycroft Holmes and this was once my house so it isn’t farfetched that I still have a key for it. But now to the reason why I’m here. I tried to visit my brother’s grave only to find it empty. I have to admit that I was indeed shocked by that and so I watched all of the material of the security cameras.”
As soon as John opened his eyes after a better sleep that he hadn’t had for a long time, he felt a bit anxious.
Then he climbed down until he stood next to the coffin. He took a deep breath and unscrewed the coffin.
“John and I went to the zoo the first day we were here and what was the new attraction, the big highlight of it? The pandas. So if you combine every information we have, there’s only one solution.”
That was the reason why he waited a half an hour after John went to bed before he crept to his room.
Pacing and nodding Sherlock answered.
Mycroft broke the spell by clearing his throat.
And never mind that it would have been in public.
Carefully he got dressed and opened the door which was actually not closed which let him frown.
As soon as Mycroft closed the door behind him John was walking so he was standing in front of him.
They both didn’t really speak with each other, both lost in their own thoughts.
Lestrade just looked resigned, and sighed.  “Yeah, I thought as much. So I already talked to them.”
“So… do you think that he could work with you again?”
“Yes, I know but it was worth it. And… are you going to put charges on me?”
He walked to the stairs but then a thought occurred to him and so he went back into the living room.
Sherlock caught that gaze and his pulse sped up again.
During his second sentence, he looked at a dark-haired man who was now really angry looking and the woman named Sally had a dark-red coloured face now.
“It’s true. I couldn’t make something like that up. I’m not that imaginative. I didn’t even believe in ghosts, so I was really shocked when I realised that I’m living with one. Please believe me.”
. Even the name of the liquid had a soft sound, somehow.
The shop was called “Yen-Cave” and the owner of it was a self-proclaimed psychic who was only called “the Woman”.
John couldn’t help but laugh at that and even Sherlock chuckled.
He couldn’t restrain a moan. His eyes snapped open. He hadn’t even realised he had closed them. His erection was stubbornly still there but he refused to ruin the water he was momentarily in.
“I…yes I’m able to do a handstand. And you?”
He couldn’t help smiling softly at her plain realization.
Gasping for air John only came as far as asking “What-“when he took a deep breath.
“Yes.”
“In no way, I’ll let you get him and lock him up in some of your institutions!”
“You look so adorable when you’re mad.”
So why did he feel like there was something? Like energy that was only between them.
“I understand that. I had the same wishes. I mean you know that I had a special dream about you a while ago.”
“Ms Wilkinson…”
“So? Now you don’t have to wear it. You’re welcome.”
He shook his head.
“What?”
“John… I really don’t know.”
The second thing had been telling Mycroft and his parents.
“What he did, with the - you know, with the body, it was impressive.”
“It’s not funny! Look what I’m wearing! He knows that I detest ties! Detest, John! And the colour! Horrifying!”
He could feel what John was feeling and so could he.
After a while, Sherlock whispered,  “You should go and talk to your father.”
John pretended not to notice it and went to make breakfast. After he finished eating he sat down in the chair across from Sherlock.
The enthusiastic explanation he’d prepared about his current experiment died on his tongue. Instead, he focused his considerable powers of deduction towards  John.
He felt already different, they were one now.
Another bang.
Then he walked away and Sherlock was again just focused on John.
Sherlock had never before slept in a bed with someone else.
By then Sherlock had his beloved suits and John had to admit that he looked obscenely well in his coat and his suits.
And he had been happy for the first time in his life until John had come to him with all the marks his father had left on him.
John froze.
John actually growled at this and Sherlock had to stifle a retort as Lestrade interrupted.
“I’m not trying, John. Besides, I already said that I’m sorry, and I really want to make it up to you.”
He would help him.
He could see a figure that was standing behind him.
He was losing his mind.
The man before him frowned and for a while they both sat there in silence. John was surprised that his father broke it; his father looked even more surprised. The words poured out of him like a secret long-kept; quiet, afraid, ashamed, angry.
“Mrs Hudson, the reason why I’m here is that I wanted to ask you if something happened in my house. I mean what is the history of it? Who lived there before me?”
First John wanted to laugh because of this reaction but then he couldn’t because his breath was caught when he noticed that their faces were only inches apart.
An hour later said detective stood in the living room. He looked expectantly at John because Sherlock was nowhere to see. John chewed on his lips and shrugged. Then he called.
John saw the concern in his eyes, and he felt so much warmth in his chest because of his love for the man in front of him. It took him a moment to remember that  Sherlock was waiting for an answer to his unspoken question.
John was frowning now and when Sherlock still didn’t answered he started to withdraw his arm under Sherlock which yanked him out of his rigour.
Sherlock’s eyes grew wide. He sometimes couldn’t believe this man.
Mrs Hudson smiled warmly and nodded.
Then the years had passed by and everyone himself included had come to terms with the fact that he would have died alone and had a lonely life.
The other man just stared at him for a while until he recovered and just looked worried.
Sherlock licked his fingers clean and nodded.
Now they stood across each other, way too near for Sherlock’s liking but he forced himself to stand still.
“You were dead. I saw your body. Did you fake your death? Did you have problems?”
John caressed Sherlock’s neck and chest with his lips, dropping kisses on every bit of skin. He kept moving steadily down, slowly, tantalising, until - at last - he could also place a kiss on Sherlock’s length. Sherlock’s breath stuttered, and only started again - irregular and heavy - as John  moved up once more. He licked his way from Sherlock’s navel until he reached his nipple, and sucked on it the way he knew Sherlock liked it. It lasted only a few moments, until Sherlock dragged him away, pushing on his shoulders, with the gasp “If you want me to last, John, you have to stop doing that!”
On Friday they worked on a case all day and Sherlock solved it as usual.
When he heard Sherlock, he looked up and smiled at him.
“Um… okay…I believe I know why you reacted so frustrated when I told you about my first kiss and my first time.”
The next morning John didn’t see Sherlock until he finished breakfast and was reading the newspaper in his chair.
He turned the lights on and checked every room but there was no one but him. Again.
“Thank God, she’s fine.”
“Are you serious? You just woke me up after five hours of sleep, which is nowhere
Days went by and he was watching the family making the first preparations for Christmas.
“I wasn’t even in the country at the time!”
Sherlock just frowned, still shocked.
To explain this, his parents had always been rich and had held a high status in society.
The Omega made a sound of approval while still kissing John.
Sherlock’s eyes widened and John didn’t let him speak.
As soon as John got rid of the last piece of his clothes he crawled over Sherlock and started to kiss him.
John looked thoughtful for a while and then he smiled and looked back to the Omega.
John snorted at that and Sherlock grinned.
“Because… you’re….you’re you.”
This sounded like he already had one at the moment and this train of thoughts was way too dangerous at the moment and so John did the only thing he could do at the moment.
When it was finally time to go home he hurried home.
Mycroft didn’t bear to live there anymore after that and so he moved away and sold the house to me. Before that, I was just a neighbour. He doesn’t even visit the grave of his brother often.”
He breathed out huffing and turned his back to the mirror.
“But I need you to know that I’m not only attracted to you, okay? I mean Sherlock- that is bloody obvious. But I have truly feelings for you and that’s the reason why I would never leave you except you wish me to.”
“Liam Bellamy.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened once more, his heart loud in his ears while she continued unbothered by her obvious panicked son.
“I’ll have to meet people that hate me, John!”
“No, I’m about to go to my family. Today I’m going to meet my…future Alpha.”
He felt lonely.
Then she went and John felt an urge to find out what kind of relationship his flatmate had with this woman.
He thought about how proud his parents were when he went to the army as an army doctor and always showed off with him as the proud parents of a man who wanted to serve his country.
This brought a huge smile on Lestrade’s face and so all he could say was:
He walked to the living room where John was sitting, reading the newspaper.
Sherlock chuckled at that and John joined him. They stayed at the bar, and  Sherlock entertained John with deductions about the other guests until dinner was announced, purely to see him smile.
John took a deep breath.
“No, I’m not interested in her! I just wondered if you were single that's all.”
He looked a bit flustered and feverish.
“Because she’s clearly besotted with you.”
Their legs were also totally entwined and Sherlock felt like he was still sleeping.
John sighed and thought about it.
John gave up and decided to just drop the topic.
“Sorry. What?”
“What? Why? He’s my friend. Why would I leave him?”
It had been torture.
John noticed that Sherlock was blushing.
Now she smiled at him a really big smile and John knew suddenly that this girl was in love with his dead flatmate.
John’s laugh.
“I’ve apologised to her. She accepted it, but it’ll need time until we can talk to each other in a normal way. The mistakes I made are in the past but we need to rebuild her trust in me. My mistakes regarding you are more recent, so I hope that you’re able to accept my honest apology. I mean, I’m still learning... I can’t promise that I’ll always react in a perfect way to… you know, things concerning this topic… but I can promise that I’ll try.”
Sherlock’s eyes widened and he looked genuinely surprised.
All his schoolmates and teachers had found that funny and laughed and whispered about him as if he hadn’t meant it the first time he had said it.
“Please, more.”
With these last words, he let himself fall into his chair and sobbed silently while swiping his face.
“You’re brilliant.”
When this day came, he saw the children walking towards him and he prepared for his possible death.
But before he could say something, the phone rang.
John felt frustrated but at the same time determined. He fell asleep thinking about his mission.
“Okay… well, I was thinking about… if there could be any possibility to get him back to life?”
Now Sherlock laughed and it was clear that it was a mocking laugh.
“John, please. Now.”
Harry just nodded, but looked like she was going to cry.
John prepared everything and looked into the mirror to shave. He dropped his razor. For one moment he saw a man standing behind him.
“So what will you need? A shovel? A rope? Oh and obviously you only can do it at night. Everyone would get suspicious if they saw a man starting digging.”
Everyone who didn’t recognize how beautiful the detective was had to be blind.
“No.”
Sherlock pressed himself impossibly closer.
After that John finally ordered some food and then went to bed. Sherlock didn’t say even one word to him.
They went together to college and Sebastian always had wanted him.
“Sure, sure… which ones?”
Mrs Holmes only gaped at his eldest son but then turned and stormed out.
She just sighed and looked at him.
That got his attention.
The door to the office swung open and banged to the wall while the detective strode in wearing a black coat.
“Hellooo? John to Sherlock…please. Hello?”
“So…uhm…good luck?”
John felt like he was hit with something. His eyes widened and he froze.
With the results in his hands, John went to Sherlock who was still sitting in John’s office.
“No, no. I would turn around, pin his hands over his head and shag him senseless! which,  by the way, I’m doing very often. He’s my boyfriend. So ladies, I don’t think that he will call you! He’s mine.”
The Alpha began now to scent him earnestly which was uncomfortable but this wasn’t the whole problem.
Sherlock never fitted somewhere in.
“Ah, John. Goodto see you! I’m glad that you could make it. Everyone,his is my son.” he announced proudly, tapping John’s shoulder.
John reached for the nightstand to get the lube, and coated some on his hands, settling comfortably  between Sherlock’s thighs.
And most important he wanted him.
Sherlock frowned.
“I’m sorry, Harry. After what happened to you, I couldn’t tell anyone that I was bi.”
go to the toilet for a moment? Hm? Can I?”
With that, he exposed his incredibly long neck to John which he just couldn’t resist and so he leaned forward and began to kiss and suck at it.
He couldn’t move away with Sebastian holding him and so he couldn’t do anything than helplessly hold still.
It was hopeless. What had he achieved?
With one last wistful smile, he took his coat and scarf and went out of the flat.
He also had completely no idea about what John expected from him.
John’s deeply concerned expression remained, so Sherlock stood up decisively, placed his tea on the table, and took John’s face in his hands.
“So I’m here now. What is it you want to talk with me about?”
“I won’t let you speak to my mate further like this! You don’t know anything about us! And surely you aren’t able to look into the future to tell what I may have done!”
Lestrade raised his eyebrows.
If he bonded with him, his life would become his personal hell, he was sure of that.
“As I said before I don’t have any experience so it is possible that I misread some things and I’m perfectly aware that some people see kissing as something to do for fun and as nothing serious. So…I don’t know what to expect. Did this mean something?”
One that wanted to be cared of. One that was soft and sweet like a typical Omega. One that would love to spend his or her life birthing children and taking care of the household and his or her Alpha.
John let his gaze wander over his parents and Harry, and Sherlock, who put his head on John’s shoulder, and he smiled widely. He felt, for the first time in his life, truly happy - and with Sherlock on his side he knew, he would be able to face everything in his way.
So the only safe solution for this problem is obviously to bond with you.”
Sherlock smirked.
Lestrade looked at John who shrugged and put his hands to his face, and then he sighed.
“Sherlock, would you like to work again? I mean helping me? Visiting crime scenes? “
John laughed proudly.
It only needed two more thrusts and then he was coming inside of his partner as well.
“What? That’s your brother, right? Why?”
“In case you have wondered, of Mr Wilkes is being cared of. You won’t see him again. And congratulations to your bond and to your pregnancy. I hope you two will allow me to visit my niece or nephew.”
“Uh… it’s a guy, right? This is getting better and better.”
“See you in a minute.”
It was the first time that he could taste something and this was remarkable. He couldn’t stop a moan.
First, he gently removed the jacket and let it fall to the ground, and then he grabbed the jumper John was wearing that day and put it over his head.
“That was my brother’s way to make sure that I’m alright and that your intentions are good.”
The beginning of the day had been so nice and now he was almost stomping through the supermarket.
“Oh it would obviously be interesting to see to what conclusion I would come. But I wouldn’t be able to make that experiment without memories… oh forget it… where were I? Oh right… I don’t think that this will happen. Don’t worry. Or worry about you! In the worst case you get caught and locked up while I remain dead.”
“You were dead a few hours ago. You should get a bit rest. Besides, I’m afraid I’m dead tired- no pun intended. So please try to get some sleep alright?”
After a few hours, there was only half of Sherlock left and he hoped that he didn’t feel any pain anymore.
Sherlock frowned for a moment and then his eyes widened.
He deduced every dark secret from his unwanted admirers which always let John feel the pride of him.
John’s touch when he held him.
Sherlock knew it was pathetic but with John’s scent in his nose he calmed down immediately and fell asleep against the wall.
“Because of the right reasons?”
Then he went to the bathroom to get a wet flannel with that he cleaned them carefully.
Suddenly John began to move in his sleep and Sherlock knew that he was beginning to wake up.
“I’m human again.”
Lestrade frowned for a moment but then shook his head.
“Please John.”
It was never his thing. Showing what he felt.
But then he had met John.
“Really? Are you sure? What…? How…can I do that?”
“Why not? It would be worth a try.”
He felt his breath at his crotch and that was it.
“Really? That is the best you can do? Okay… blue. And yours?”
“Git.”
If Lestrade wouldn’t know better he would say that the Omega was against his own morals the opposite of detached and was an emotional wreck but he would never say that to Sherlock.
John just stood there bewildered.
John cut him off.
His gun waited ready for him.
“Why have you never said anything?”
He would never do what an Alpha says to him. At least not willingly.
Sherlock looked highly concentrated and after a while, he spoke.
His knees hit the cold ground.
Right, aver she had finished high school, she had bonded with Lestrade’s and Molly’s son with whom she had been together for a year before that.
She laughed a mocking laugh in return.
His thoughts were cut off by the fantastic feeling and he let his head fall back on the pillow with a moan.
“What?”
It seemed like he cared.
John had been beaming at Sherlock because of what he had said but now his attention snapped back to Mycroft and he had simply enough of all that. He slammed his fist onto the kitchen counter which made both brothers look at him.
“Sherlock? Lestrade is here. Could you come?”
“You’re very welcome.”
John let out a shaky breath and fell into his chair again.
A while later when he finished his dinner he decided to just ask him so he went to the living-room where Sherlock was sitting in his chair, arms in praying position under his chin, eyes closed.
John froze, shocked, and stared at Sherlock while he tried to comprehend everything.
“What the hell was that?!”
Sherlock definitely didn’t know what he was doing or why.
She looked at him intensively.
“Same.”
“Do you want to move out?”
Then John rose to stand in front of him.
For a moment John was too perplexed to say something.
“Okay, so Friday it is. But… look I think we should consider everything… what is if… you won’t remember a thing of your time as a ghost?”
“You know that Sherlock and I have been together for eleven months now - nearly a year…and we… we are going to get married.”
Sherlock felt the sunbeams cutting through him and he began to have difficulties to concentrate.
John swallowed.
He felt cold beside the mild temperatures outside.
Sherlock nodded.
“Here?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock joined his laughing and shook his head.
His father was the obligatory patriarch of the family. His word was rule. So when he said that he didn’t want a daughter that was such an abomination, and refused to talk to her until she behaved normally, everyone -
Lestrade looked genuinely worried.
“Of course, dad.”
What had he done? Why did he punch him? He hadn’t expected to be raped before the bonding ceremony was being held.
Behind the glass door of the bar, Liam stared attentively at the child and shifted away as his mother entered the bar sighing.
There was only one person he knew who could give him answers. So he ate breakfast and went to his landlady who lives just across the street.
When Harry found Clara during college, she stopped the drinking, but she also stopped contact with her family. She had no choice. Except for John, no family members came to their wedding.
“No…it’s not like that. I mean I know that she has feelings for me and that was always useful in the past but I would never…”
They both groaned at this but John held still for a while before Sherlock was adjusted to the stretch and gave him the signal to move.
John sighed and kept looking through his clothes.
His skin felt way too sensitive for clothing and so he began to undress without any conscious thought.
He let his thumb wander over the sharp cheekbone.
He felt her urge to put her wet hands in front of her to avoid to fall on her face. Reflexive tears filled her turquoise eyes when her chin hit the dusty sink board with a loud
“Yes…”
“Oh, you want to ask me something. Something that bothers you. Hm… interesting. Okay, go ahead.”
His father squinted his eyes, directing his narrowed gaze at Sherlock, who just stared back with a blank expression. John swallowed.
“The next thing I know that after a few days of my death, I was suddenly here. At first, I was just confused but then I realised that I was dead. That I was dead and a ghost. I couldn’t leave the house and many other things.”
“Of course I am. Why wouldn’t I? It wasn’t that bad.”
“What?”
Those made John stop.
“Hi, how was it?”
Sherlock breathed out.
He wished she was…
John frowned but looked determined.
“Alright… I’m just going to change into my sleeping clothes. I’ll be right back.”
Luckily, by now, everyone was used to his sense of humour. Everyone laughed, and John could finally relax.
Then he winked at Sherlock whose corners of his mouth turned up although he was still frowning.
Why had he done that? Ah because he was an arrogant git which John told him often enough.
“Why should I do that? As far as I know, you could just be a psychopath who wants to kill me as soon as I’m alone with him.”
“I understand completely.”
John smiled back.
So he had watched him a bit- not stalked! - And had finally decided that it had been time to go shopping.
“But you said you didn’t want to bond with me.”
“No, it’s not! You can’t honestly think that’s how mates treat each other. You deserve better. You deserve someone who would cherish you. Someone who wouldn’t lay a hand on you. Someone who would make you happy.”
Sherlock stroke over to John’s side and they stood shoulder to shoulder in front of Mrs Hudson and Mr Watson.
“Oh hello, can I help you?”
“I should go to bed.”
John had to laugh at that and after a moment Sherlock joined him.
John choked on his tea that he was just drinking.
“It’s either that, walking in pyjama bottoms or naked. Your choice.”
“I know but I … there’s no possibility. It was nice to talk about that but it’ll never be reality. I’m sorry. I want to be alone for a while… sorry.”
He used his whole body weight and finally the killer lost his consciousness and landed on Sherlock who fell with him on top on his back.
“So let me tell me what your team did wrong.”
With John’s chest pressed to his back, they both came and at the same time John’s teeth penetrated the skin at Sherlock’s neck.
“Sherlock! What have you done?”
“I see, I see.” His father took a sip of his drink.
He was pressed against another person.
On such days they just sat on the couch and watched TV and John had his arm around him and Sherlock laid his head on John’s shoulder.
Lestrade laughed a dry humourless laugh.
Everything in his mind was screaming John.
He put his hands into his hair and considered everything. Then he finally found a solution.
“Um…I guess then there would be nothing I could do for you.”
It was morning. His t-shirt was damp from tears and his bad leg hurt.
“Okay. At the beginning, the house belonged to a family. Their name was Holmes. They were nice although a bit odd, but who isn’t, right?
With that, he grabbed John’s arm and started to pull him to the entry.
Sherlock looked genuinely confused.
“I can do whatever I think is the best thing for you. I’m responsible for you and you can’t live forever like this. I mean you’re thirty-five, Sherlock and don’t let me even start about the fact that you’re living together with an unbonded Alpha! You should be bonded to an Alpha and have a lot of children by now. But no you chose to
They went to the living room and stood in front of Sherlock who was sitting on the couch surrounded by the files.
“I mean the one with the teddy bears.”
“Oh…what do I smell here? Were you a naughty Omega, Sherlock? Letting an unbonded Alpha this close or even closer? Hmm? You know what? It doesn’t matter. I like naughty ones, they aren’t that prude in bed.”
“Oh, they had a car accident. It was terrible. The boys were twenty-five and eighteen that time and it was just too much for them. The older one plunged himself into his work and the younger one plunged himself into drugs.
So he reluctantly turned his head away to speak.
“Okay. Interesting. Now you.”
He closed his eyes.
“Sherlock? What is it? Are you okay?”
He smiled at Sherlock who just still looked shocked.
John blushed at that but Sherlock continued.
“Well okay… you see the killer, Liam Bellamy had once a wife and a daughter. But his wife died in childbirth and so he was a really loving and caring father for his daughter. She was his whole world.
“Hello, I heard that you want to speak with detective inspector Dimmock.”
She held her hand up to stop him and what he hated the most- successfully.
John was about to stand up and speak but didn’t get farther than “Sherlock what-“
There he opened the drawer of his bedside table.
Now she seemed annoyed.
Sherlock just gaped at John wide-eyed and just now realized the obvious signs of arousal on John.
“Do you really think that? So do normal humans often just appear in front of you? That would worry me if I were you.”
But even he could be wrong sometimes.
They stood across each other and looked at each other uncertain for a few moments.
“How?”
His life began ordinarily. Children made him, laughed and went away. He thought it wouldn’t be special. He would just stand there and wait until he died.
Mr Watson avoided her gaze and looked at the floor. She cleared her throat awkwardly.
With that, he lost his consciousness.
Sherlock’s head had snapped towards him, watching the tense lines in John’s face and his worried look.
“Yes?”
The little twelve-year-old Sherlock with the knowledge that he would present as an Alpha in the future was listening to the explanations of bonding.
Suddenly the door opened and a reprobative sound was heard which belonged to his mother.
Lestrade narrowed his eyes and pursed his lips again. After a few moments, he sighed.
He was young. Probably not older than twenty-five.
To say John was surprised would be the understatement of the century.
John groaned again. Sherlock gave him a questioning look.
“The way you acted after I was kidnapped and before you went today…this was sentiment.”
John shuddered a bit at the thought where this scar came from.
Then suddenly Sherlock jerked and gasped for air.
John choked again on his tea.
Sherlock nodded while John made notes.
John didn’t want to let him out of his sight although he was in desperate need for a shower.
Naturally, John didn’t have to be told twice.
John smiled at him and he smiled back.
John was just putting some clothes into their washing machine when Mrs Hudson arrived at their flat.
Now Lestrade had the need to interfere.
John took her hand and waited until she was ready to continue.
John laughed nervously and distracted himself from that image in his head by making tea.
It was like being filled without knowing that there was something missing.
“You know what? I think maybe you’re wrong.”
“John. I’m sure. I want it. I want you.  More precisely I want you inside me.”
First, he searched partly ridiculous stuff like “How to revive something dead” or “How to bring someone back from the dead” which didn’t bring him any success.
John raised his eyebrows and Sherlock just scowled.
These facades dropped the day before the trial.
Mrs Holmes laughed into John’s face.
He asked one of his colleagues out on a date.  Her name was Sarah.  She was really nice but they were too similar. They agreed on being just friends.
Sherlock watched as many emotions crossed John’s face.
Now John had to look pained because Sherlock hastily talked further.
“Of course I am. You can’t accept me to tolerate your lifestyle forever.”
Hoc postulo ego meum sanguinem pro dono vitae do,
He savoured the taste of him although he lost count of how many times he had already tasted it.
He wished…
John laughed.
Weirdly he even hadn’t been able to stop thinking about him after that either and so had had to see him again.
He was choking while almost dropping his cup.
He opened his mouth to swallow the shy grin that was trying to spread on his face and to give a proper answer when she cut him off. Again.
He grabbed the bags and put it on Sherlock’s lap who looked through it immediately.
This move made the blond man growl and Sherlock gave him a wicked smile in return.
“No, I’m obviously clean and so are you.”
He cried and screamed.
John rolled his eyes and sighed but did as he was told. Then he prepared their breakfast and put it on a tray and carried it upstairs.
Another bang.
John stared at his father, breathing heavily. He stared back, speechless..
He didn’t even notice it at first but the body was filling itself.
John sighed and sat down next to Sherlock.
With that, they were on their way to the morgue.
After a while, Sherlock gestured him to ask a question.
But the main point was that he was indeed breathing.
“Then I know exactly that I’m not crazy. Thank you so much, Mrs Hudson.”
They also visited Mrs Hudson grave who had passed away eight years ago.
Sherlock nodded.
John gave him a little smile and looked at Sherlock, who also grinned a bit.
Then Lestrade bid his farewell. As soon as he was gone, Sherlock groaned.
He started to fill the bathtub with water and turned to Sherlock who just looked exhausted.
They had this power. They had made him and they could destroy him. It was simple.
Sherlock smirked. “It was bad luck for him that I was here today. Otherwise, he probably would have succeeded; it looks like an accident.”
He slowly pushed one finger in, and then gradually added a second, and eventually a third, and by then the slow speed was beginning to get to him. He could tell it was getting to Sherlock too -  his lover’s length was pressing hard into his stomach.
How could someone like him, someone, who was rude and being honest most of the time didn’t even care about the others?
“Guess what I would do if he tried to try that.”
Speechless John stared at Sherlock.
“I don’t want to go, John.”
John was perplexed.
His behaviour hadn’t changed that time towards the others just because he had become sexually mature which was why he always had repeated his opinion since he was twelve.
John would have nothing against it but suddenly there was an uncomfortable sounding harrumphing coming from Lestrade.
“I can say honestly that I’m not looking forward to it and under different circumstances, I would avoid it like the plague. But I really love you, and I can’t bear to see you so unhappy.”
Sherlock snorted.
While he was reading he began slowly to clench his right hand over Sherlock’s body so that there was blood dropping everywhere.
Then he helped Sherlock to the bedroom and put him to bed.
His eyes stopped at the bond bite that was now there.
“Come. We need to pack.”
After he finished eating he sat at the table a while thinking about everything Sherlock told him.
“Um…I think that maybe in college, or some time,, your father was raped by a man.”
He caressed his stomach and chest, fingertips running over smooth skin and coarse hair, without stopping the kiss.
He took off his coat and suit jacket and sat down in his chair.
Sherlock buried his nose into the crook of John’s neck, smelling, scenting him.
“A life? Do I have to kill someone for this? Do I have to kill myself for this?”
Sherlock followed him smiling and let himself fall on the bed and they began to eat.  After a while of silence something occurred to John.
It landed a few metres left away from him on the ground.
The day John had come to bond with him had been for outsiders relatively normal looking.
“It’s not my fault that you believe me anything. Um… yes, I think I’m going to grab the least gruesome ones.”
John kept a slow pace although he had to pull himself together to do that.
“Good morning and happy birthday.”
He felt different. Should he even feel different? At least he did.
John was sitting in his chair, reading one of his tedious crime novels.
“Alright.”
Meanwhile, John wanted to help him and so reached with his left hand between them to stroke Sherlock’s length painfully slowly.
John let him lead him upstairs in Sherlock’s old bedroom which they changed a bit and made it into theirs.
Mycroft would finally believe him. Mycroft would maybe even finally realise that he wasn’t a child anymore and that he was able to take care of himself.
“And you did that?”
Sherlock joined him and then he kissed John.
He started with the tie which he gently removed and the other one stared at it like it was going to bite him. Then he removed the suit jacket. Sherlock hissed a bit when he had to stretch his arms for it.
“I thought you like me.”
The pheromones were still in the room but it was obvious that the heat was over.
He stood barely an inch away from him and for a moment John felt paralysed by the intense gaze. Then he hesitantly started doing what he had said.
“So let’s see…she died of anaphylaxis, or a severe allergic reaction. You can tell from the swelling around her face and neck, and there are signs of suffocation. But what caused it?
He shook his head and focused on Sherlock who still sat in his chair. He looked annoyed and frowned at John who cleared his throat.
“As I said the family was odd.”
Now Sherlock took a deep breath in, and gave an answer that was neither the relevant truth, nor a lie.
But he knew it would be unfair to force Sherlock to go with him, knowing the delicacy of the situation. So he breathed in and nodded.
Lestrade tried to conciliate but the three of them just glared at each other. After a few moments, a sniffing sound broke the spell.
They had been a couple for four months now, and had known each other for six months - but John still couldn’t believe that he could call the man before him his own.
The wedding ceremony was the next day. Both were dreading it, and desperate to survive everything.
After a few moments they had to stop because of the need of air but John didn’t go far.
He was formed by six clumsy hands which belonged to the children that lived in the house behind him.
“Okay. Um… well… I thought about something and now I’m feeling stupid because I didn’t think about that earlier. “
“I must say you’re still looking as good as I remember. That’s a good thing, I wouldn’t want to be seen with an ugly Omega.”
Usually, such moods could only be cured by John but the DI was confused to notice that he couldn’t find him anywhere.
Now everyone was staring at John. Everyone looked shocked, beside Sherlock, who looked frightened and - just to the one who knew him well - aroused.
He flinched at every noise he heard and he was shaking. He was a doctor. He knew what was happening to him.
With that, he was gone and Sherlock was still leaning bonelessly to the wall half undressed.
Then John made an inviting gesture. Sherlock looked confused.
Sherlock was sitting, knees tight to his chest, sleeping with his head against the wall.
It was the moment Sherlock had realized two things.
Another bang.
John only nodded and shifted back until he was between Sherlock’s legs.
His father still showed no reaction, so John continued.
“Molly? Is everything all right?”
Sherlock beamed at him.
The Alpha had taken over Lestrade’s job then and so it was perfectly obvious that they would work together.
He couldn’t quite figure out what was that distressing to John.
First, he had been curious about this young man who just had happened to be an Omega.
John looked at his watch and nodded. It was almost midnight now.
If wearing his best suit as some kind of armour would be helping his situation.
John chocked on his tea and took a breath to answer but Sherlock cut him off.
“Sherlock Holmes.”
John swallowed. He hadn’t thought about that.
John’s smile grew impossibly wider and he just nodded and went upstairs.
“No, just answer. Yes or no.”
With a sigh, he stood up and began to make breakfast.
The ladies toilet looked different, somehow. It took him a moment to notice the new huge bin under the sinks. It was oddly large and narrow.
He didn’t know what to do. Sherlock was breathing evenly but he didn’t wake up.
So it had been downright a scandal for them as Sherlock had told him that he was going to bond with a seventeen-year-old Omega.
Then Sherlock turned to his side and kissed John and lived happily ever after.
After an eternity the sound of water stopped but Sherlock didn’t come out.
“What the hell, Sherlock?! You can’t just disappear for about four weeks and then show up bonded!”
“Because it can scare the other one away. I mean in the worst case.”
A few moments neither of them said anything and they sat in a comfortable silence.
John sighed.
With that they entered Lestrade’s office, John chuckling.
His eyes snapped down and he felt it even before it was visible.
John froze. He couldn’t face his family, after all this time he’d spent managing to avoid them all, by himself.
“John…”
He had never felt so comfortable than in these few moments when he held Sherlock, feeling his breath on his own neck.
“Hello, can I help you?” She asked of the man waiting on the building’s porch.
“Good night, Sherlock.”
“Bloody hell, John. You know that digging up a body is a crime right?”
John was on top of Sherlock and they were both giggling for a moment.
He gestured Sherlock to ask something.
All of them turned around to see a small looking woman who was staring at Sherlock and crying.
“Never heard of that name.”
He always had thought that it becomes boring-a domestic life with a mate who was always there when needed.
He felt her pulse and breathed out feeling relieved.
It was always as incredible as it was the first time.
His legs felt limp.
“You know… I have always believed that something supernatural was in this house. I mean no one wanted to live here for long. And then you John came to me and asked me all this questions and this just confirmed it.”
John raised his eyebrows.
“No, no. It’s my decision and I want to help you. So let me go.”
“Are you serious? Can you imagine how wonderful it would be to have you here in human form?”
Sherlock sighed.
When they got divorced, she was at least allowed to visit her family a few times a year.
Sherlock considered everything before he answered smiling.
“Oh John, is something wrong? Can I help you with something?”
John folded the newspaper together and stood up his arms swinging anxiously at his sides.
After a few quiet minutes, she looked at them both and demanded an explanation which John gave her. He told her everything that had happened.
She took his hand and pulled him into another room, where they were alone. As soon as she let go of his hand, John was desperate to know what his sister was so keen to tell him..
After two hours he was satisfied with his work. He had dug a hole that was almost two metres deep and two metres wide.
John was only thinking about one person. “Did you talk to Harry?”
He looked at the crowd of people and police officers and waited for someone to volunteer the answer. He was met with silence, and after letting it stretch somewhat uncomfortably, he sighed, frustrated.
He had realized then that he had been depending on John and that he even didn’t know how to stop it- or even more important- if he even wanted it to stop.
“Look at me.”
“Okay, let’s go.”
So he had been right. His heat was indeed coming earlier which was really bad timing.
Sherlock let his gaze sweep over John’s body and then smirked.
He had two floors. The kitchen and the living room were downstairs and the two bedrooms and the bathroom were upstairs. He really liked it.
As he got Mr Bowtie out of the bag, he almost saw Grace Wilkinson squirm. Panic and triumph (
“For God’s sake, Cody! Stop chewing that damn gum like a…”
Keeping it there was pointless. He stood up and flushed the water with his fingertips, not really knowing what to do next.
Sherlock took his hands and let his boyfriend pull him on his feet.
He looked at everything outside with such a fascinated gaze that the older one couldn’t help but smile.
John let the files that he had been carrying fall and almost dropped his phone too.
“What are you talking about? There are no such things as normal colours. That’s completely illogical.”
But Sherlock was staring at John’s hand and then at his own. Then he frowned.
Still confused he stood up and began playing his violin to clear his mind.
“I don’t know. Maybe because I’m a nice person? Maybe because I like you? I don’t know. Maybe because I’m an idiot.”
But obviously, John wasn’t interested in him, didn’t want him as his Omega. Who could blame him?
“Thank you.”
He turned it off and closed his eyes for a moment again.
John chuckled. “Um…well, Sherlock…do you want to tell the story?”
Sherlock tried to turn around but it was too late.
Both stared at each other.
“Oh do you?”
Although it was nothing sexual about this or it shouldn’t be, he felt John’s gaze on him and that let him shiver.
It was the second time that he had the fortune to see Sherlock’s erect member but for him, it was the first time he had seen John like this.
Once again, it was unnecessary. No one had ever been surprised before at a man with a white rifle-like thing under his arm.
John escaped his home, and his father, by joining the army. After that, he never returned to his family, choosing to stay in London.
“Okay, see. I can’t touch living things.”
Sherlock just looked expectantly as Mycroft turned to him.
Lestrade looked at him as if John was the stupidest man he had ever met.
“We have a million moments like that ahead of us. But yes… I know what you mean. It’s a perfect morning.”
As soon as he got out of the cab he stood in front of an impressive looking shop. It had a glass front where you could see some books which you could buy. None of the books seemed special. Over all of it was “Yen-Cave” in massive letters written in dark red. John squared his shoulders and got in.
Now Lestrade basically growled.
He was tall and had a blue scarf and John was instantly captured by the colour of his buttons.
This had baffled him.
He was a broken man with a cane and who was mentally ill.
Mycroft texted him that the car would be there in five minutes.
This made the other man helplessly moan and after a few moments, he relaxed completely.
Everyone just stared at Sherlock. He, again, was just focusing on John.
“Ah… right. I brought you some clothes but your suits will take a few days so you have to live with that until then.”
There were a lot of “oohs” and “aahs” and “awws” to be heard and even Sally couldn’t help but smile which Sherlock almost returned until Anderson spoke.
“I said we go now.”
He let his fingers where they were and waited.
“Yes.”
“Oh, you brought the perfect dressing gown! Thank you.”
John knew it was a mistake when it happened.
“John, please tell me what my blood type is.”
When the door closed behind Lestrade, John sighed.
“Cody…” she whined, frustrated. “You already ate two at the stadium twenty minutes ago. I’m definitely not buying you another one. So stay there, keep quiet and…” She was hissing now and preparing to turn away. “Don’t talk to me till we get home. It’s getting more and more stressful every time we go to the stadium on Saturdays.” She whispered furiously. “You know, you should learn from my students. They’re so much mature than you.”
Lestrade sighed.
He never told them that he just went to the army because of the adrenaline and the danger that awaited him there.
John laughed and nearly choked on his tea in the progress.
You couldn’t just scent someone.
John thought for a moment about that. “You said that she was working at the zoo…and that she recently broke up with her long-term boyfriend.”
Her name was Maddie and she was mute. When she was eight years old she was on an overnight school excursion, she had no friends and was bullied.”
He knew he had to act rapidly from that point – the main door was not locked and besides, he was supposed to suffocate her before the Lysthenon could kill her first. That would have been a great waste of energy, in that case.
John called cuddling but Sherlock would never something like that.
It appeared that the killer had hit John with something hard on his head because there was a laceration which coloured his hair.
“Alright. I’m going to see what I can do. I’ll let you know when I know the answer. Okay, I should go. It’s good that you’re alive, Sherlock. Bye, guys.”
enough by the way, and now you’re trying to seduce me?”
Now Harry took his both hands.
John breathed in loudly. “So… now I think it’s time for us to go. Congratulations, guys, and sorry for the outburst. It wasn’t my intention.” He smiled thinly at the happy couple, turned, and went to Sherlock. The room behind them stayed silent; everyone was still in shock.
John had to laugh and Sherlock nodded and chuckled.
But then his father spoke.
“Hi boys, I got some of your mail,” she called. As soon as she found John, she smiled. “Ah, there you are. Here.”
Sherlock was speechless. He needed a few long embarrassing moments until he could stutter an answer.
The sudden physical contact pushed an involuntary moan from John’s throat. This only encouraged Sherlock to go further, and so he let one of his hands wander under John’s t-shirt.
Sherlock stared into John’sdeep blue eyes,feeling warmth spread in his whole body, from somewhere in his chest to the tips of his fingers.
He cleared his throat.
Then he sighed.
“I love you.”
John ignored her and she went on.
She had never seen Sherlock this relaxed or happy.
He had followed her…
John turned around and lifted the gifts once more on his arms, and between them, they juggled the gifts down the stairs to the cab and set out for John’s old house - the house he grew up in. His parents had invited them for Christmas this year.
John had had no nightmares since then too and it was also always an unbelievable event for Sherlock to walk up next to his mate.
Sherlock’s bedroom was since their first kiss their bedroom and he actually had to admit that he loved sleeping with John-just sleeping.
So it was a huge surprise as Sherlock asked him to bond with him and just a very tiny spark of hope.
When he finished he panted and drank the rest of his water. With one final look at Sherlock who was still unconscious, he stepped out of the grave.
“Go ahead. Deduce me.”
“So… Harry. There is only one question left now. Please...would you  be my maid of honour?”
While preparing it he heard a delighted sound from Sherlock.
Soon he sucked at Sherlock’s bottom lip and let his tongue explore.
“You know?” He repeated as her figure slid rapidly on the toilet floor. “You really do know, don’t you.” He stated flatly.
"So'' I say. "How in the bloody hell did you make it out alive?''
After the ambush in Afghan I returned to Londen with my spirits down and my future bleak. Now one year later I still find it hard to look back at the events that found, place that one dreadfull night. The paining screams of my fellow soldiers, the look in their eyes as they meet their dead. More and more people are starting to doubt about the concept of hell. Thinking it is a myth but believe me when I say, that I have seen it that night. Still, I wake up in the midnights screaming and sweating somethimes still hearing the sound of the bombs, the raging sound of a gun, shooting down my men. I can't help but let out a sob every now and then. The things I have seen will haunt me forever.
With a sigh he pulled it out, not minding it getting dirty by frog blood.
I'm baffled by the man and can't help but wonder who this fellow is and how in lords name he is still alive and well.
"Maybe? It is the only other possible reason besides being a-''
"You...'' Sherlock tries but goes silent again.
But still, there was something about that boy, something Sherlock couldn't qiut put his fingers on.
Those cheekbones
The man in quistion looked briefly at him, taking John's schedule out of his hand, looking at it before returning it to the sandy blonde.
“You weren’t supposed to see that,” says Sherlock while placing his hands on his hips as his face slides off to something guarded. He looks towards the door, grasping for a distraction. “I am thinking we can go down town, maybe eat some-''
"I realise now that you may be upset about-''
"Think it's starting to rain'' Anderson says as he looks into the sky.
Richard squeezed his eyes shut, cowering into the protection of the door opening, turning away and clutching at the lapels of the too long coat that hugged around his shoulders. He should get a coat that fits, but what is the use if the summer is almost near he thought to himself. As John opened his eyes once more he saw something strange man wandering around the cornor on the other side of the street. It can not be. Can it? The man looks an afwul lot like... John cleared his throat, dipping his chin down to his chest in an attempt to breathe, to not breathe, to anything. He let out long breaths through his nose, only barely sucking them in again. He shook his head, no. No, there is no one. He didn’t open his eyes. He is dead. Not only Sherlock, but everyone. All his soldier friends, dead. And he did nothing to help them. He ran away like the cowerd he is...
'' Not until you calm down, your blood is clearly already pumping and I don't want to be the cause of your heart attack since you already got a poor diet, bad condition and a bit off stress going on at work-''
"Sigh'' I let out a huff and look my companion in the eye for a second. ''Fine you got questions. But before I anwser them I should tell you I am rather in the unknown myself and that I don't answer to idiotic or boring questions. Now shoot'' I say while walking over the base while John is trying to keep up with my long pace.
A shocked look came upon Sherlock's face ''Trust... you?'' He sounded unsure.
"So uhm'' John clears his throath "Wanna go to Angelo's? I'm starving"
"Alright, that is alright. Just so you know... I am here and you can always talk to me'' John says with a little smile.
"Wait!'' John says as he quickly picks up his back and paces behind Sherlock
I reply with a hum.
Sherlock glares at John from the cornor of his eyes. He should tell John what is going on... He has the right to know. But now is not the time... He will freak out, run away, yell at him, be afraid of him, think of him as the monster he so clearly is... He can not tell John. Not like this.

"Wha? no, no sod this! sod this Sherlock! Just don't put them in there!'' John almost screams.
John stood up and made his way to the front door after giving Harry a pat on her head.
"Morning, John'' She says with a fond smile on her face ''Got everything for your first day?'' She asks as she plants John in a seat at the table and gives him some of her famous eggs.
"Are you sure?'' she asked, her expression concerned and caring
"My friend, I don't even know what is going on myself, but surely we will pursue this conversation once we are on safe grounds!'' he almost hissed.
"What are you going to do, John?'' She asked, her arms crossed around her body, probably because of the weather getting colder by the day.
His eyes widen and he looks at me like i've gone mad.
"I left with some troops when we noticed that there was no way of saving the place... god if I had known you were still alive I would have-''
John took this as a blessing and started walking off into the great unknown.
Hello guys! sorry for not updating for a while here is the new chapter! tell me what you think!
As Sherlock stepped into the good old 221B he could hear John upstairs shouting at someone. Who can it be? Misses Hudson? No she clearly went out for some new shampoo, Gravin? No he can only hear one voice and clearly Graham wouldn't take the shouting without having a say back. Phone? That's probably it.
"What do you want'' Sherlock says with an irritated voice, still walking as fast as he can without making a run of it.
He would start his new school within just a few days. School year had already begun and he was very gratefull that St Benedicts could see to let him in, this all ofcourse thanks to his aunt, who worked there as english teacher.
"Yes, ofcourse I do. It's not like I meet an immortal every day."
"What?" the stranger says while looking at me in disbelieve.
"SHERLOCK!" I shout again.
I can't help but say that I am rather astonished myself about the event. I can already feel my strenght regaining and before I know it I'm now standing on my feet looking down upon the strange man who tried to safe my life. My mind starts their deductions. Short blond sandy hair wich points out he's from the millitairy, obviously, why else would he be here? Bags under his eyes say lack of sleep and problems with his familie. There is also something else in those stormy blue eyes... what is it? Oh shock that's right...
''Arrgh!'' I let out a cry of pain as I feel the bullet wound that was formed in my chest. Slowly but surely I can feel darkness overtake me.
~1881~
In front of the class, Mr Brooks only shook his head ''Be quit, Sherlock''
Pov John, few hours later
The day was light, and the sun bright. John's pace was relaxed he wasn't afraid of getting lost but as time flew by and day became night he could feel a sence of unease in his gut. He should have been back by dinner time, that should have been like a hour ago already, going by the state that the moon is already shinning in the night, leaving a shadow looming ahead of the lone traveller.
"What is it?'' John asks.
"Are you alright?'' the man doesn't seem to be able to speak but his eyes are more aware now.
John looks up at sherlock and throws the Phone on the table "What the hell Sherlock! You ran away from the crime scene and were gone for hours!''
"Oh right'' he says looking away from me ''not much really. I live with my sister and her afwull excuse of a husband and devil childeren. Still looking for a job but for the rest, nothing special really.
He takes a breath and thinks back at the events of a few nights back. He still couldn't get that boy out of his head, that stare, those red shinny eyes, what was he? Sure he did some research on the internet, going by the state of what he saw that night the internet threw all vampire shit at him. He never believed in vampires and he wouldn't do so now. There must be another explaination.
"you- you think so?''
"Mom-'' he tries but can't quit continue as he is almost out of air ''Mom!'' He says again pushing her away a little.
"You are looking around the room the whole time you have been here, are you expectiong someone?''
"Oh don't be such a baby Sherlock it is just a little bit of rain, it won't do you any harm'' John says trying to be symphatic.
Maybe mike knew the boy? Should he ask him about it?
Sherlock blinks at him, not knowing what to say at first.
Quite the opposite, actually, but that's besides the point. He wouldn't deny the existence of love, friendship or sentiment, as he called it- but he was proud to announce that “that particularly appalling parasite of frivolous emotional attachment” did not have its grip on him. He regarded sentiment as a waste of perfectly good minds, addling the brain of its hosts and hindering all that was good in the world. It was a plague, an animalistic desire tearing down humanity for the sheer purpose of- of nothing, really. It was just a disease. Atleast that is what he used to think. but now. now he is not so sure while he lies on his feather mattres. It has been one year since the ambush in Afghanistan. He can still remember it to the smallest detail. it was late in the night as he first heard it. The screams of his fellow soldiers. Sherlock shudders at the thought of it as he lets his mind once again wonder off to that faithfull night in 1880.
Once I was able to stand up I made my way out of the ruined base as quickly as I could. After wandering in the desert for what seemed like days I came to a village where they offerd me food and a place to rest. But my heart longed for home, for London. So after many attemps to get in touch with the british army I was able to return to Londen after 4 months. Once I was back home I had no other choice but to move in with my half sister for a while since London on an ex army pension wasn't quit affordable. Well for a while, after 8 months I'm still in this god forsaken place of hers with all of her 4 screaming kids to count in for, a husband who clearly has an affair with the woman next door wich my Incomprehensible sister is still trying to deny. And ofcourse a cat who isn't even capable of catching a single mouse. It's tedious to say the least.
He heard the scream again, he was sure now, that it probably belonged to some kind of animail and he became curious.
John wasn't used to any of this.
"Hey!'' a soldier said as he slips down next to me '' are you alright?''
"Sherlock you are literally almost standing on the body, move'' Lestrade says.
As Sherlock strides through his apartment he anxiously looks at the calander. Tomorrow it starts again. Just like it does every 4 years. God! why does this has to happen to him? Why not Mycroft, the idiot deserves this. Sherlock takes a deep sigh. He will be fine as long as he wont be near the water. It is just for 7 days after all... How hard can it be? The last time it happend he almost had some slip ups but the week had passed by quickly and no-one had found out his secret. Beside himself only Mycroft and his parents knew about it. Well in defence, his parents HAD to know about this because it was going on since he was 4 years old. It had been a burden ever since... And now he was a grown man. He couldn't hide in his apartment for the whole week he had a job to do... certainly it was getting harder and harder for the worlds only consulting detective to keep his private life in the dark now that he was getting more famous by the day... Almost every day the same old story. Journalists approuching him asking him all sorts of questions. Sure he enyojs the attention and that his intellectuel display is being admirred by so many people but in times like this it is just a pain in the arse. Nobody can know about him... nobody can know what kind of a freak he really is. People will start to repel him if they found out... and John... god John he would never want to talk to him again, ever. He would be disgusted by the man Sherlock really was and what he was, was a monster. It is in times like this that he feels depressed... He had been in love with his best friend for over a year now and he knows John could never feel the same for a monster like him... He could never love the thing that he really was. All these emotions all this sentiment is getting to much. All the people who ever called me a freak, all the beatings as a teen on my boarding school just because I was different, all the drugs I have taken to feel only a little bit more human, to feel, to be alive... but what hurts me the most is knowing that John... my John will never feel the same. Oh, if you could just see how bad I am doing right now. All the pain. In a world turned upside down nothing is how it is supposed to be John... And a heavy sadness fills my soul. I keep falling deeper and deeper within myself. And it feels like nothing, not even your funny little ways and your smiles, can show me out. It feels like it is always nighttime and nightmares and never morning. And mostly I try not to think about it, and try to get by, trying to survive. I've gone to Ella and had many secret therapy sessions with her. And by now I have heard pleanty of promises how things will get better but push hard enough and sooner or later the promises all turn out to be empty. I do not want the world to be pulled out from under me again like it did with the drugs oh so many years ago. But at the same time I lack the energy to move on. I feel like im trapped, trapped in my life of secrets. I feel like I am drowning John... All my life deep waters have followed me and I feel like I can not keep my secret life any longer for you... But knowing you will leave me when you know, breaks my heart. And I wish I could tell you all of it and that it wouldn't matter but who could ever love a mermaid.
