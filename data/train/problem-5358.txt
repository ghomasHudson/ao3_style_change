as Sammy might say.
It’s hard to put what he’s feeling to words, and it’s even harder to express them, but then again he’s never been good with feelings anyway so bite him. “I just - I - ah… It’s just that you - when you… y’know… angel blade…the other you, y’know… aagh…” Dean flounders, waving his hands in the air in a cheap imitation of the fight in the shack.
A ghost in front of him.
“I don’t think we’re in a civilized area at the moment,” he said, looking at Dean as if he had grown a second head, “If you see any restaurants or other signs of life, though, then let me know.”
Both Dean and Sam start, but Chuck just laughs. “I like your spirit, kid. But you can’t hurt me.”
He waits for her to quiet, watching her stumble over unintelligible words, her shoulders jerking violently. When she finally manages to settle into soft, hiccuping sobs, the renewed screech of the awakened angels tears a violent scream from her lungs. She claps her hands over her ears and melts down into a litany of
More to come!
No sooner than he agrees does he feel a chilly hardness entering him, twisting and pulling, in and out. He cries out in surprise, eyes still obscured. “Cas, what the fuck?”
way to run it, for the first time in millennia. There was no one left to tell us what to do, not even the archangels, and that’s why we vied for its control.”
He stops in his tracks.
“If you count taking my booze away, then yes,” Dean shoots him a tired grin. Sam replies with a well-timed bitchface that lacks any semblance of irritation. He coughs, the sound dry and harsh. “Mainly just bruised my ego a crap ton.”
“...Go on,” urges Chuck.
Everyone they’ve ever known is invited. Kelly. Eileen, Bobby. Jody and the girls. Adam. All those people from the other universes that Jack restored to life, all those years ago, refugees-turned-friends-turned-family. People that have been here for longer than all of that time combined. Even Chuck got an invite, now that he's made it up here himself; it’s clear that there’s no more malice left in him after a lifetime of trying to own up to his mistakes.
“What makes you think you can change my mind, anyway?” Chuck asks instead, thinking back to all the times everyone else had tried to and failed. Even
The reunion we've all been waiting for.
to do anything. Au contraire, he’s the one
The formality both excites and discomforts him. Trying not to preen under that gaze, Dean settles for blushing like a schoolgirl instead. “Hey, what are friends for?” he grouses, turning away to disguise the frankly embarrassing display of emotions flickering across his face.
from me…” She’s beginning to hyperventilate again, her artificial breaths coming out in quick, short bursts. “Use it to build your little sandcastles, mess around with everything without any regard for anything else, you — you …”
“Why not?” The tone appraising him is cool, buzzing with power underneath. “After everything that has happened, everything you’ve done, can you really say that I have no right to judge you?”
“What did you hope to achieve by calling me here?” he repeats, by now out of real genuine curiosity and not disdain.
“Let’s talk about that later,” Castiel said severely. “You’re extremely injured and I think I made it worse. I didn’t want to move you too far but you would’ve drowned or washed out to sea if you’d stayed where you were.”
“Sam’s going to take the kid out for a drive over to Kelly’s later,” Dean murmurs, thoughtful, resuming his ministrations a moment later. “But he’s literally God, so he probably already knows about this whole surprise thing we got planned.”
after realizing he’s just called Castiel his.
“And then you want to cut a deal with the Empty so that you can exchange your life for the lives of everything that’s ever died and ended up there.”
But here Castiel is now, standing in front of him. Maybe it’s just the residual hurt or a bit of alcohol Michael had somehow missed, but Dean can’t stop trembling. It’s as though all the fear and sorrow he thought he’d managed to push down and suppress has surged back up full force.
So Dean goes to the kitchen and makes himself a hot cup of coffee, pitch black like his cold dead heart, and sits down at the dining table. A poster bearing the Stanford insignia leers up at him knowingly and he sighs, picking it up so he can place it face down next to him.
“Dean,” Adam says, sounding far away.
Could it be amnesia?  “Okay, let’s work through this,” Dean says placatingly, “What
. All by his own design, a beautiful reality of his own making.
A large wave crashed over him suddenly, enveloping him whole and filling his nose with burning water. When it receded, he was left coughing and sputtering weakly, jerking like a half dead fish. Maybe he ought to get further away from the water.
Amara hums, a downcast note to her tone. “So.. you’re just going to …?”
Dean can only hope he didn’t make himself look too much like an imbecile in front of this guy. He fights the strong urge to bang his head against the wall.
What he doesn’t expect, however, is the two of them,
He’d not expected a huge welcome party upon his return, but the scene in front of him is just disappointing, just like it had been when Amara had brought him here against his will
“I’ve put everyone back. Just like you asked.”
But he’d neglected them. Let them grow into something he can no longer control, not reliably. Now, they’re just going to find new ways to defy him, every time he tries to set them up the way he wants, and this cat-and-mouse game will continue with no end in sight.
“Please tell me I’m not alone here…” the voice said from somewhere behind him, almost to himself. It was deep and full of gravel, unmistakably male. Maybe the guy had face planted here too, eaten a bunch of sand or grit when he did -- maybe that’s what made his voice so deep and baritone. It, Dean reflected gravely, might also be the last voice he would ever hear.
I’m absolutely terrible at ending chapters;; sorry
Earlier in his tone there was fury so hot it could have set water aflame, but now the man in front of him is just tired. Exhaustion leaks from his features like the sludge from a Leviathan’s vessel.
He hears Cas moving around and rummaging through something and impatience overtakes him. He opens his mouth to speak, but decides against it when he sees Cas stand up, a hard set to his jaw and nothing to betray the stoic expression on his face but the mischievous twinkle in his eyes.
“S’fine, Cas,” Dean slurred, waving it off. The man flinched slightly at the nickname, but seemed to accept it. “Now what do you need me to do, doc?”
“This is
“But now,” Barachiel says with shining eyes, “now we will all do as you say, and everything will return to peace and harmony, because you are the — “
She pulls him into a tight hug and it effectively cuts off anything else he had to say. They stay like that, whether for minutes or hours he doesn’t know, but Chuck allows himself to revel in her warmth one last time. How comforting the darkness can be.
“Now I know that I have been … absent, lately,” he starts, and everyone quietens so that they can listen.
she hisses.
His vision fuzzed over, and even as he fought to keep his eyes open they began to slip shut. His ankle wasn’t hurting so much anymore. Now that he thought of it, nothing really hurt too much anymore. Maybe…
Nature was always her favorite part of any universe, so he chooses a wooded park, the trees green and rustling as the afternoon breeze runs its fingers through the leaves. It’s the same one Amara had taken him to, back when she’d attempted to convince him of how beautiful the world was.
Right before it all ends, Chuck lets his sister out for the last time.
the two of them, unarmed and wearing matching, defeated expressions as they make their way down the center aisle and slide into the pew next to him like the entire world hadn’t just disappeared and they’re all just attending Sunday mass together.
“But...why?”
“What happened?”
She turns away, smiling sadly to herself. “You were always so willful, little brother, so keen on creating and building and breathing life into things. You were both beautiful and infuriating, you know that?” Laughing, blinking, disbelief. “And so
“As appealing as that sounds,” Chuck muses, checking his fingernails, “I don’t know what to expect from you boys. Thought that was pretty obvious.”
“Maybe.” Chuck says, uncrossing his arms and rubbing at his chin thoughtfully. “Tell me more.”
Quirking her brow at him, his sister frowns. “That doesn’t sound good,” she quips. “What have you decided upon?” Then she looks around, and, on noticing the familiar hustle and bustle of people around, her discomfited expression morphs into one of considerable relief. “I take it you’re not intending on destroying this place anymore.”
And just like he’d done back home, Sam insists on keeping a calendar, just for the routine of it, and no one dares speak ill because of how happy it makes him, watching the days of an eternity tick by, marking them down as they go and getting to love every passing minute of it without a care in the world. By his count, if they were still on earth then today would be Jack’s fifth birthday, nearly two years after his rise to godhood. It only seems fitting, then, to throw him a giant party in true Winchester fashion.
Okay, maybe there’s still a little disdain there. They
there’s nowhere to sleep, nowhere to go…There’s

“Wait. What are you saying?”

“Listen to me, Michael,” and ever the dutiful child, Michael shuts up and listens. “You are going to do a
“But you wanted to try anyway?”
Dean laughed, a short, hysterical sound. “My ankle, probably. M’ not feeling too hot.” He couldn’t really see his legs from this angle, but then again, neither could the other guy.
Except for the guy, facedown on the dark asphalt of his driveway.
The guns are loaded in the back seat.
“I vastly,” Castiel growls, steadying his grip on the blade, “prefer them to angels.” Dean stays quiet, but his mind supplies a little cheer.
After fiddling with the screwdriver and the device for what seems like an eternity, the guy’s head snaps up and a jubilant smile appears on his face. He wiggles his fingers happily.
“Somethin’ funny to you?” demands Dean.
It’s over in a few seconds and fades out slowly. When he opens his eyes again, Castiel is looking over at him in concern. He winces apologetically. “... perhaps I should have told you to shut your eyes.”
The hand over his eyes lifts and light comes to the world again. Dean tries not to dwell on the fact that he’s just come untouched while being fucked on the hilt of an angel blade, because damn, that’s not something he expected to happen to him, like, ever. So he puts that thought aside and busies himself with carding his hands in Castiel’s hair as the angel idly kisses his face, his lips, his eyelids.
Dean frowned. “And what about you? How’re your eyes?”
“That’s for me to know and you to never find out,” Dean says, but of course they would find out. The guns are loaded in the back seat.
Castiel looks unbothered, though. He beckons to Dean, who follows him around the side of the ship to a raised, square shaped marking on its underside rim. The plate is covered in some kind of runic lettering. If Charlie were here, assuming she hadn’t freaked out already at this point, she’d be hopping up and down with delight. Linguistics is totally her thing.
The finger breaches his entrance as Cas goes down on him again, and Dean’s back arches. Son of a bitch, it stings, but he welcomes it as it moves in and out of him in a pleasurable motion.
pleading internally for him to understand. “Please, Cas, don’t go.”
Their lips slot together; at first, Cas’ eyes widen almost comically, but then he’s quickly taking the lead and pulling them so they’re lying down face to face on the bed. The angel blade lays at the foot of the bed, forgotten as Castiel ravages Dean’s mouth with his own, sucking on his bottom lip and nipping at the corner where neck meets jawline while his hands work to relieve them of their clothes. Nimble fingers work to unbutton his flannel shirt and his jeans are unfastened and discarded.
She dumped him —no, Dean dumped
“You were willing to let my nephew, your
, he notes with a twinge of satisfaction.
even.
“I’m sitting here now, aren’t I?”
One finger becomes two, then three, scissoring and pulling and stretching and so deliciously wet. Castiel eventually finds his prostate, and when he brushes it, it makes Dean arch and gasp even more as the blinding white flash of pleasure overtakes him.
“That’s my business and not yours.” Dean’s smile could be wiped off his face with a wet cloth given how drawn on it feels. How it must seem to them. He keeps up the act. “Besides, I just wanted to celebrate a little since we saved the universe ‘n all.”
when he finally grew a pair and realized just how much of a bitch she was being. She’d come to him knocked up, used the kid as a bargaining chip during their increasingly commonplace spats after he was born, and acted like
Amara sighs. Chuck’s told her time and time again that if she keeps frowning like that, it’s likely to stick. Eons and it already has. “But, brother, I don’t understand. What brought this on? Why did you change your mind?
“Dean?”
“And you’re right about Adam too. We coulda busted him out at any point, hunted down Death again and tortured him for it if we really wanted to, but,” he scratches the back of his head as if he means to break the skin there, “we didn’t.”
“Well, I still can’t see, if that’s what you’re asking.”
he scolds it, but the arousal remains a niggling pressure in his gut.
“You’re probably wondering why I’ve bothered to show my face around here again,” God says to the crowd of curious angels. Awe radiates off their face like the gleam of sunlight on water.
Cheers!
“No, well,” Jack backtracks, running a hand through his hair. “Yes, actually.” His expression shrinks, no doubt in remembrance of the multiple times Chuck had snapped his fingers and threatened to end his life before, in a similar position. How he’d even succeeded that one time. “Sir.”
“Come again?”
Sam and Jack are back home, living the life that they deserve to live. Together, happy, free from the puppetmaster at last. A family waiting for Dean to come home. They think he’s out on a hunt somewhere, as they do sometimes when the bunker starts to feel a little stuffy. He wonders what they’d say if they knew what he was doing now, barely hanging off the arms of an archangel that’s looking at him with so much contempt he feels like he’s back in hell again, and maybe he is, because there’s so much pain and anger inside him and Cas isn’t here and —
There are tears in her eyes. Her voice comes out hoarse when she says, “I just wanted to go to
“And you were...aroused.” Cas states.
“Quite loudly, might I add,” now Michael chimes in. “No one else remains on earth to answer but me.”
As if on cue, again come the uproar of heated denials, the bootlicking. The pandering that had driven him away in the first place.
The gates to Hell are locked, every demon and errant soul trapped inside — Rowena and Crowley (who woke up with the rest of them when Jack’s alarm call blazed through the Empty) somehow have managed to put aside their differences and are working to keep it that way. On the other end, Earth seems void of anything angel related, so Michael must’ve done the same up in Heaven. He comes around, sometimes, to tell them of any pressing news, but otherwise he stays away.
you?”
“Yes, Dean.” Cas’ hands are firm as he grips Dean’s hips, aligning his lubed-up cock with Dean’s hole. “You’ve been so good for me, so patient.” Dean tries not to laugh, because he’s been neither of these things and he’s one stroke away from coming all over the both of them, but he does anyway and it comes out a hysterical half-groan.
“Yeah, that’d be nice, Sammy.”
They clink their beers together, Eileen coming in with hers as well, content to just enjoy the moment.
She’s still muttering it over and over when he finally manages to bite back his hesitation and get closer. The distance is both miniscule and eternal, but he crosses it anyway. For the sake of making things right.
bright and chirpy mere moments after rousing him from an extremely satisfying slumber.
“And now we can,” Castiel says shyly, pulling his hand away from Dean’s cheek to link their fingers together. Heat rushes to his face. Had he said all of that out loud? “That is, if you’ll have me.”
“It was just some really bad shit,” Dean says evasively, trying to diffuse the situation. There are still some things he’s not quite ready to spill just yet. “The point is, I’m good with a gun. And at scaring people. Or … things. Basically whatever it is that needs scaring or shooting at, I’m your guy. You don’t need to worry about endangering my safety, ‘cause I can handle that just fine on my own. Scout’s honor.”
“You want to.” Amara stops short in disbelief. “Take my powers.”
“Initially that was my only motive,” Chuck admits. “But this whole thing...the way I’ve been acting, the way I’ve gone about writing this story and tried to keep it going past its prime. Maybe I’ve lingered here, in this universe, for too long. Enough to consider myself physically a part of it.” He laughs tonelessly, but there’s a newfound liberation to it that he’d never had before. “And after a while that got me thinking, maybe... it’s time for my own story to end.”
Sam gives him a brief, jittery smile, the one he reserves for outsiders, mostly, or for when he’s thinking about something unpleasant but is too nice to say it out loud. The muscles in his cheek twitch, staccato and featherlight. The suspicion in his face makes it clear to Chuck that Sam knows exactly what he’s doing, but the younger Winchester goes along with it anyway. “Great. I’ll, uh, be right back then.”
That elicits a reaction out of Dean. “I’ll say,” he snorts, before clamming up. Chuck has been trying to wipe their slate clean, toying with their lives since before they had even been born and here Dean is getting chummy with him like it’s all water under the bridge.
The archangel hims contentedly, not really listening as he shimmies upward to press lazy kisses along Dean’s jawline, around the shell of his ear, nibbling at the fleshy lobe. Dean shudders, lies still for a bit and lets him without protest. Castiel feels his heart rate quicken beneath his palms.
“You know I can’t promise that.” But the response is good natured, and something in Dean knows for certain that they won’t be needing to anymore. Dean drops his arms, grabs Castiel’s free hand with his and laces their fingers together. Past him would be running for the hills at how cheesy he’s acting right now, but he can’t find it in him to care.
Castiel gives him a meaningful look. “I shall have to decide that on my own,” he says simply.
“Did I tell you that you could come?” He demands, and Dean reluctantly lets go of his dick.
Hope you enjoy this next chapter!
I wrote the first chapter almost two years ago holy shit. I’m back. Still awful with updates as always, but I’ll get work done.
Looking at them now, all so earnest and childlike and eager to put his mistakes behind them, that’s what they were, weren’t they? Children, anxious to please and obey and be loved
“Come on, Cas, enough talk.” He grins weakly. “Now fuck me, you bastard.”
This is a terrible persuasion attempt and he knows it.
“So it seems.” He’s staring at Dean full in the eyes now, something fierce. Dean clears his throat awkwardly and looks away.
No one moves. No one even breathes.
“You don’t think so?”
“Pardon me as I speak out of turn, my Lord!” stutters another angel as he steps forward, dark haired and blue eyed. God manages to coax the name Barachiel from his memory. Interesting that this might be the boldest that he’s ever seen him. Not that he’s seen much of him in the last few millennia, but angels seldom change. “But… you can’t say that about yourself! You will always be worthy to oversee our Holy dominion, as our Father and Creator of All Things and — “
In which Dean finds a mysterious stranger in his front yard.
Cas frowned. “You misunderstand. I am no doctor.”
“And I get it. Believe me,
“It would be better to just make angels and demons unkillable, but that’d give the humans an unfair disadvantage.” As usual, Chuck chooses to completely ignore the most glaring issue in his idea. He waves his hands with a flourish, then claps them together. “Got any good name ideas? Purgatory is already a thing. How about Purgatory 2?”
And then Dean’s saying,
“Well, no shit, Sherlock,” Dean retorts, then snaps his mouth shut. Cas regards him warily, but doesn’t seem too bothered by the fact that Dean has a murder kink or something. Instead, he wets his lips. A slow grin stretches across his face, revealing shining teeth and gum. It’s hot, and dangerous, and Dean is
“Still, it hurt you,” says Dean, self-deprecation ripping the last vestiges of breath from his lungs. “It hurt everyone I cared about, and now…”
“But that’s not how it is anymore. Because the truth is, Chuck, in the end this wasn’t your greatest failure,” Sam says, and is received with a confused squint. “You made life, the world, the universe. Hundreds, thousands, maybe
of it.” His voice breaks a little. “I just wanted this little family we’d made along the way, y’know? Just wanted everyone to be okay and safe, and
“There was a
“Sorry to interrupt, but what of my existing position?” calls out a domineering voice.
.” God waves him off again. “I know.”
“Wouldn’t you like to know,” Dean mutters, so quietly that even Chuck with all his omnipresence can barely hear him. His face is gaunt and sallow, cheeks sucked in so tight he might as well be a pile of bones with a layer of skin stretched over them. His eyes are a puffy, mutinous red.
in that statement, “but that doesn’t mean we still aren’t family.”
Not to mention his eyes. There is no way human eyes could be that shade of blue, with rings of pure gold blurring into their edges. They’re almost too hypnotic to look away from. Dean can’t look away. What the fuck is this thing?
Castiel shakes his head and doesn’t answer, eyes closed and brows furrowed in concentration. After a while, there is a soft hiss, then the air suddenly twists and changes, kind of like when there’s a barbecue and the air sizzles around the grill. A sudden, blinding flash drowns Dean’s vision and he squeezes his eyes shut, yelping.
“Don’t worry about that, man,” Dean says easily. “Just focus on getting back onto your feet first. Anyway, now that you’ve seen the place, you can pick any bedroom you want. I don’t, um. Really use any of them except for the one at the very end of the hallway.”
“I know you love it here,” Chuck says to the wind. “I’ve seen you, the way you come alive when you interact with what I’ve made. That’s why I’m asking if you want to experience it to the fullest.” He cracks a smile. “I’m told that, for what it’s worth, the human lifespan can be very rewarding.”
“Do you know if anyone came after you?” he asks instead. “Did you see anyone around when you first crawled out?”
The other man was scratching his head. Blue eyes came to rest at somewhere above Dean’s left shoulder. The waves crashed around them thunderously. “Must’ve hit my head when I fell. In any case, I can’t really tell what you look like.” There was not an ounce of concern in his voice - he said it as though he was merely relaying the weather.
“Are you even supposed to do that to someone who’s broken something?”
Maybe there’s hope for them yet.
The hand over his eyes lifts and he’s staring into the angel’s blue, blue eyes. “I promise you, Dean. I could never hurt you. No harm will come to you when you’re with me.”
“Can you walk?” he asked.
“Morning, sunshine,” Dean murmurs.
Billie said that this vast, endless void would be different after Jack exploded the Empty, and it still is. Even now, he can hear the distant, almost metallic screech of everything he helped create, gears in the background of a purposeless machine. He’d always preferred a reality with noise, though he can admit that noise on this scale after an eternity of quiet is bound to drive anyone insane.
Dean’s eyes opened, and clarity returned to them for a brief, blessed moment. He raised his head weakly. “You what.”
Groaning, Dean closed his eyes. His head dropped back into the sand, the impact harder than he thought it would be. It sent shockwaves of pain lancing through his body. “R-right back at ya, buddy.”
“You...you saw me kill myself, in the other universe.” Cas says. Dean looks at him for a long moment, then nods hesitantly. He’s suddenly at a loss for words.
Castiel doesn’t frown. “It was over before I knew it. The next thing I knew, I woke up in a field in Wyoming with nothing but the clothes on my back.” He pulls away for a bit, looks apologetic. “I’m sorry it took me so long to come back to you.”
“He looks all right,” Eileen says as they start to move him to a chair. Dean waves them off with trembling legs. He still hasn’t noticed Castiel, who’s standing there with the chair pushed back, motionless. The lines on his face have become much more pronounced, deeper. He looks like he’s aged ten years in three weeks, a deadened shadow over his features.
No one dares to speak, staring at him with matching cowed expressions.
“Now, where did you say your ship crashed?” Dean says, as he opens the front door and lets the alien out before him.
“Now, do you trust me?” He asks, sounding businesslike. And what else can Dean do but nod, because if it’s gonna get him off and finally let him come (which he’s gonna do harder than he’s ever done in his life, and that’s saying something), then why the fuck not?
Now that he thinks of it, this could come in as a close second.
“You love me for it,” Castiel shoots back, and the fingers in his hair pause. Without opening his eyes he can feel the soft, emerald warmth of Dean’s gaze on him. Now that he is fully powered again, courtesy of Jack pulling him out of the Empty and funneling archangel grace into him, humanity’s emotions come to him in waves. He can feel Dean’s once again again in all their glory, radiating off of him and bathing Castiel in light and contentment.
Nothing about him stands out to Dean on first glance. He looks little more than an unmoving smudge of wild brown hair and spandex on black tar. Would’ve been camouflaged perfectly against the pitch if Dean wasn’t observant enough.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes,” Castiel says simply, “We are.” And then he’s pushing the blade into his counterpart’s chest as far as he possibly can, watching dispassionately as Nazi Cas’ eyes burst with blue light as he lets out a guttural scream and then slumps over in an unceremonious heap.
Can he even claim ownership over them anymore?
“Chuck?” Sam probes.
he’d said, without giving Dean a chance to ever say it back.
“Thought you were the dungeon master,” remarks Dean tiredly, glancing at him. “Aren’t you the one pulling all the strings here?”
“Saying something like that and dying on me,” he murmurs, diving back into the curve between Cas’ neck and shoulder, too tired and too relieved to force any anger into the words. “Why the hell did you think that was a good idea?”
Working up the nerve to go outside, he gets out the gun they keep in his drawer — not that he has any ammo left to use it with, but no one has to know
A tiny whimper escaped his throat. He was going to die. He was only twenty eight. He was…
doomed.
A sudden, furious rush of wings has four pairs of eyes snapping up to identify the commotion. There in the center of the room, just in front of the interdimensional-telescope-that-no-longer-works, stands Michael, looking quite bored.
He guesses no one really saw the breakup coming, least of all Sam. Then he went off to law school like it said in the script, promising emptily to visit weekends and holidays and whenever else he could, and Lisa hightailed it with Ben not two weeks after, so now it’s just him in this big old house he’s frankly got no business living in.
And now he’ll never be able to.
“I’m a real fuckin’ piece of work, aren’t I,” Dean laughs, feeling it resonate like shards of glass in his throat. “I was happy to let Jack die so we could get our happy ending. Hell, the place I was in, I probably would have done him in myself, if — ”
It takes a few glances exchanged between moose and duckling, nervous on one side and reassuring on the other, before Jack reluctantly concedes, coming to sit on the other side of Dean so he’s furthest away. Sam opts for the substantial amount of empty space between himself and Dean, sitting in the middle of them like they’re all going to alternate between reading verses and discussing the football match during sermon.
They sidled up the gentle swell of the sand to a rock face a few meters up the slope. Dean had been facing the ocean from where he had been lying, so he hadn’t seen the lush green flora that covered the island like a blanket. Tall palm trees dotted the shore, and further inland lay a wide sprawl of ferns, grasses, and sturdy jungle trees boasting curled, coquettishly-petaled flowers and brightly colored fruit above a thicket of brambles and dried brush. A seagull squawked once from its perch unseen, then took to the sky and disappeared into the sun’s glare.
Castiel shakes his head no, then lapses into a contemplative silence. He stares at the coffee mug as if it has personally offended him. Dean wonders if they have coffee in outer space.
He shifts, shallowly fucking back on Cas’ cock and making him groan quietly. “Do I look like I want you to stop?”
“No, Jack,” Sam pleads. “It’s not your fault.”
get it, and you should get that I understand you because we both know how it feels when things don’t go our way but,” he takes a stuttered breath, one that brings out the raw suffering on the lines of his face even more. “Please. I hope you try to see it from our perspective.”
Now that the weight of the world is off their shoulders (and for good this time), Castiel hopes that Jack can live as normal a life he pleases. There was always something unsettling about letting a three year old child run around with that much power, putting so much of a burden on him to do right and fight and spill blood. Of course, they’ll have to skip over a bunch of things children can enjoy, speed through others considering he doesn’t look the part, but it’ll all turn out well in the end. Castiel’s sure of it.
“Was this your plan all along, angel?” Dean’s sultry voice goes straight down to his core, his pupils blown wide. With his gaze, Castiel follows the path his tongue takes as it flicks out, wetting his lips. “Tempting me like this? And here I thought you were keepin’ me in bed to sleep.”
“You ruined him.” Chuck says simply. “Turned him disobedient, just like you, and I had nothing to do with any of it. I might have cracked his chassis, sure, but you went and sledgehammered it apart and that poor guy was whipped for you, up until the very end. Though you don’t need me to tell you that.”
He kind of regrets not doing it sooner. They’ve had so many opportunities to get together, so many missed confessions, so much love between the two of him. It’s kind of ironic that it took Cas technically killing himself for Dean to get his shit together, but better late than never, right?
“I was stuck in the Cage with Lucifer for a thousand years,” Adam starts, his voice barely a whisper. “I had to listen to him flay your brother alive, for a while.”
An uncomfortable pause drapes between them, though Castiel seems to be rather unaffected by it. He continues to stare. God, someone needs to say something. If he doesn’t break the ice he’ll drown under it. “I’ve got a question,” Dean says slowly.
“I know what this is about, Dean. You’re normally much feistier than this.” Amusement comes out in a huff. “Look at you now, giving up so quickly. It’s disappointing. You think you’re
Fondness blossoms in Dean’s chest. Castiel’s awkward politeness is extremely charming. He fights the urge to tell him that it’s not necessary here. The alien is already much nicer than most people Dean knows; it’s refreshing, in a way.
He watches Castiel sidle toward the door when it suddenly occurs to him that this could be what he’s been looking for. He’s been moping and lazing around his house all alone like some unwanted stray for
“Do you think we’ll be able to get back home?”
“Right, as I was saying, there are a few more things I need to get out of the way…”
But Dean had to focus.
“No more sacrificing yourself, okay? For
“Did you like that?” Cas sounds hesitant, shy almost. His voice is an octave deeper than normal, sounding thoroughly wrecked.
“It’s not about that.” Amara stares at him.
Off to the distance, the sounds of some distant brawl echo along the streets, and he suddenly can’t find the words.
It’s Sam taking the lead, Sam who bumps shoulders with him like this is all one big joke and they’ve made plans to go out to lunch in a couple of hours.
“Hey, don’t get all sappy on me,” Dean says gruffly. “Lemme show you around, and then we can get down to business.” He turns around in favor of ignoring the starry eyed, awed nod that Castiel gives him in response.
Both of them go quiet at his words, thinking. Dean’s mind runs in circles. If someone had been following Castiel, they might still be around. What could he have been running from? Is Castiel hiding something?
, Dean’s traitorous mind says, but he pushes the thought away.
Death is dead (ironic, right?), Amara is gone, returned into him, the Empty was satisfied with its tribute courtesy of Castiel’s sacrifice and is unlikely to intervene in their business any further. Michael is nowhere to be found. The only human beings left on earth are Sam, Dean, and Jack, so they’ve got no major players on their side anymore — not counting Jack, who barely knows what he’s doing on a good day.
“It is repugnant that a Sword of mine has sunk so low,” Michael interrupts, his voice whip-sharp and cutting through Dean’s thoughts like a blade, “so as to lose himself in vice and corruption.”
He curls into his husband’s side even tighter, grumbling, his head tucked away beneath Dean's chin. Angels do not need sleep, much less an archangel like him, but it’s a luxury Castiel has found incredible pleasure in, especially now that there’s another warm body to share it with. “Five more minutes,” he says, throwing an arm around Dean’s chest, and feels the soft press of lips to the crown of his head.
“What the Shadow doesn’t know won’t hurt her,” he says mischievously. “The only caveat was that she be allowed to tear my grace out herself.”
When he turned his head, he was met with a clear view of the guy’s face. White sand peppered a shock of wild, dark brown hair, giving him a somewhat older appearance. It was a ruggedly handsome face, framing a pair of ocean blue eyes. They were blindly regarding the open air behind him, nestled under quirked, severe-looking brows. His chapped, flat mouth pursed in confusion at the remark. He looked to be Dean’s age.
“So, you gonna give me your schtick or what?” Chuck asks after a few more minutes of brooding silence, because he needs to move this along. “Your rationale for why I shouldn’t wipe the slate clean?”
Chuck laughs.
“Whoa, easy. We just want to talk.” Sam holds up his hands like he’s trying to calm a panicked horse.
nowadays.
“I can’t stop you, can I?” Amara interrupts. Chuck glances over at her, the leftover words dying on his lips. She gazes down at the ground. “Never could.”
The stranger shakes his head furiously. Pointing at his mouth, and then at the device again, he growls in a decidedly non-threatening way. And Dean’s watched too many sci-fi flicks with Charlie to not understand what that means.
“You got it, Sammy,” Chuck flashes him a tired smile. “I’ve just...I’ve realized a few things.” That’s all he can really say. “Maybe I’ve been wasting my time here. Yours too.”
He will not dare to hope that this is real. Because God and Fate are cruel sons of bitches and this may very well be a fever dream, Chuck’s last cosmic joke, the final big fuck you to end all others. Dean crosses the room slowly, like he’s afraid one of them will disappear. His legs feel weighed down with lead. “That really you?” His voice is hoarse from weeks of disuse.
It’s Jack’s turn to beg for his life.
“Let him speak,” comes a thunderous voice. God snaps his head to the side to find Michael, still stone-faced but having come forward with purpose. “All of your questions will be answered soon,” he murmurs. Though he doesn’t sound too convinced about it — rightfully so — he steps back, nods once at the empty air and goes back to giving everyone the silent treatment.
Castiel gave the space of sand next to him an irritated look. “To check if the bone was shattered or broken in two or anything. It’s not, by the way.”
There’s a stick that’s conveniently lying on the pavement next to where he stands. Gripping it tightly, he approaches the body with bated breath. Some part of him is screaming at him that he should really be calling 911 instead of fucking around, but he ignores all rational thought in favor of getting closer.
“Where are you from, then?”
, and were it not for the way Castiel is gripping the base of his cock, preventing him from coming, Dean would have thrown in the towel a long time ago.
Maybe one day, she can meet Cas in person. That would be nice. Dean looks up to find Castiel softly murmuring and clicking as he runs his fingers across the plate in a circular motion. “You good?” he asks.
That evening, Dean ignores the beer and goes straight for the proof liquor like he’s done day in and day out the entire three weeks Cas has been dead. He’s spent his time, all those hours getting so plastered that he forgets he exists, sidling along seedy alleyways and getting into brutal fights when he means to, barely able to see straight and so heartsick it leaves him hollow. This bar in particular is loud, cacophonous, perfect to hide the tattered shell of a man drinking himself to death in its midst.
Cas’ breathing is just as ragged as his, and he wishes he would take his hand off his face so Dean could see him in all of his glory, in the way his mouth parts in pleasure and the way he throws his head back and moans, blue eyes flashing with power and lust.
“ —what am I?” Castiel finishes for him. Blue eyes glimmer warmly, golden edges flickering with amusement. “Well, I’m not from this planet, as you might have guessed. So no, I am not human.”
looks at him. Castiel’s pupils are so dilated his eyes are coal black and he’s breathing heavily, like he’s run a marathon. His deep blue eyes peruse Dean’s, looking into them and reading them for all he’s worth, and Dean balks, feeling naked and open under his scrutiny. He can see the promise etched into Cas’ face, can see the desire so vividly present there, and it scares him.
Sam elbows him, Jack glancing over in alarm, but the ire in his expression doesn’t waver. Chuck wipes a tear of mirth from the corner of his eye and rubs the back of his neck.
“Well, I would -- “ Castiel moans appreciatively as Dean does something incredible with his tongue. “I’d carry your soul across the celestial plane, down to earth. Almost -- almost like a vessel, but not quite.”
The mailbox is positively stuffed full with all the shit he hasn’t bothered to take out of it — looks like it’s about to explode, but Dean puts it off for yet another day, shuffling over to the couch and passing the large window that overlooks the front yard while he does. He freezes as something odd occurs to him and draws his attention outside.
“Michael,” repeats Adam from somewhere, sounding sad, but Michael is a cyclone, fierce and unstoppable, his very words infused with grace and rage. The wrathful, proud archangel of decades past hadn’t been whittled down by his time in the Cage after all, Dean thinks distantly. Unchanged.
So what more do you want from me?“
guy himself, but he’d watched a couple episodes of that show with her upon her insistence. Either way, he can’t resist. “So, your ship… is it bigger on the inside?”
Dean only laughs.
he reminds himself. Just another blatant reminder of how he, the writer, has failed to control the direction in which his characters have gone.
“Maybe to you.” The bitterness filling the air is almost tangible. Dean barks out a derisive laugh. “I don’t know
It’s been years since he’s lost it so completely, sobbing like a child. Like the air in his lungs has been sucked away, like the first time he’d lost Sam or Mom or anybody he’s ever loved in his life. There was a point of no return, he’d thought. At some point he figured he’d lost the capacity to care this much about somebody
Chuck grins. “Haven’t tried to kill you yet.”
“I didn’t mean for this to happen,” he says quietly.
He feels Castiel’s sharp intake of breath, feels his heartbeat quicken beneath his palms, and continues, softly, “I love you, Cas. All that stuff you said to me about not being able to have the one thing you wanted, you were wrong.” The world around them has ceased to exist. “You’ve had it all along, but,” with just a touch of self deprecation, he adds, “I guess you weren’t the one who had to figure that part out.”
“Cas-“
Confusion quickly turns to alarm. “Dean, you have a child!?” Then, mild annoyance when Dean chuckles at him. Then finally, awe at the shiny, pristine-looking 67’ Chevy Impala sitting parked in Dean’s garage.
to die. Sacrifices are
over his own species. It’s all too much, and the whole thing has caused his downstairs brain to start working on overdrive.
“Our ships are controlled through a mental link,” the alien explains patiently. “I feared that my amnesia would cause mine to reject my attempts at control. But thankfully, it didn’t. And the mass redistributor is fully functional, as you can see,” he holds out the disk again, “so I can bring it to your home and repair it from there.” He looks concerned and slightly sheepish. “If that’s all right with you.”
“Okay,” she says, pulling away and dabbing at her eyes. “Okay. I’ll do it.”
“Patience, Dean,” he says, not unkindly, “I know what you want, and I will give it to you. But you must wait.”
Somewhere out behind a cluster of nondescript buildings, Dean thinks about setting the handprint aflame.
Castiel doesn’t actively seek him out until they’re past the rift and back home safe in their own universe. And it’s not like Dean’s wanted him to, either. He’d never admit it to anyone, but he’s been avoiding Cas. He can’t look at the guy without remembering what happened back in Apocalypse world. Can’t think of what Cas would say if he found out why Dean had been acting so weird in front of him that day.
“I am listening,” he says quizzically.
Sam might want to know about the dead guy in their yard, but Dean decides against telling him. The younger Winchester has enough on his plate right now already and Dean doesn’t want his little brother to be any more stressed out than he probably already is. Especially about the possibly dead guy on their driveway.
He averts his eyes, hating himself more and more by the second, but Castiel’s restrained tone brings him back to reality. “I — I just do not want you to be hurt.” He looks up into fevered, conflicted eyes, clouded over with gold. “There might be something dangerous after me. I don’t even know who I am or what I did to provoke it … if in the process of seeking me out it injures you, or worse… I would not be able to forgive myself, especially after all the kindness you have already shown me.”
God has failed him in more ways than he would once have cared to admit.
“Like a dog on a leash,” Dean remarks, and it draws out a laugh from him, the sound of gravel and dark honey.
“Noted.” Castiel replies gratefully. They’re back in the living room. A picture of Mom hanging over the mantle catches the alien’s eye and he stares at it vacantly. Dean fidgets for a bit, uncomfortable, and is thoroughly startled when he continues talking. “Regarding my vessel.”
“She’s beautiful, Dean.” Castiel’s eyes reflect the glimmer of her paint coat pretty nicely, if Dean could say so. He wisely keeps his mouth shut, though, and averts his eyes quickly to avoid coming off like any more of a creep. Then he resolves to stop thinking about stuff like this entirely. For all he knows, Cas could have heard his intrusive thoughts loud and clear. And these feelings Dean’s having are too dangerous, especially for someone like himself.
“Who the hell are you?” says Dean, gun at the ready.
“Hey.” Dean calls. “Listen.” Castiel frowns.
“Jack likes nougat,” Castiel says to him, stroking along the stubble of Dean’s cheek with his thumb and bringing his attention back to him. “We could go down to Earth, pick some up for him, sightsee for a bit while we’re at it…”
That piques her interest, though her beady eyes are still leering and suspicious. “
He is going to smack himself. Mom raised him better than this, bless her soul.
Shocked, Michael says nothing, gazing at him with wide, imploring eyes. So unlike the proud, capable warrior he both is and no longer is.
Jack wouldn’t stop them from visiting their old place - hands off means hands off. “I’m an archangel. I imagine I can bend the rules on occasion.”
“Dean and I were having an interesting conversation just now,” Chuck says. “Hear you have a few things to say to me too.”
had failed, and she is currently somewhere within him, brooding as he taps into her power shares so they can destroy the known universe together.
“That’s — you know what, never mind.” Dean rolled his eyes. It was easy to, because they were already on the verge of rolling back in his head. His legs throbbed insistently, and his chest caught on each inhale. “Mind if I close my eyes… for a bit?”
He doesn’t look like he’s breathing.
“Wait…” Dean frowns. “What does this mean?”
plot. Tell me, is that really so bad?”
No one moves. “What are you going to do?” Jack asks, eyes wide.
“You okay?” Dean asks worriedly, and Castiel gives a shaky nod, lifting his head up to look at Dean again. “Uh, what do you mean by that last part?”
Love that burns in them now, true and bright and something Dean won’t push away this time.
Michael raises an eyebrow. “Self pity will get you nowhere wi —”
“Gee, thanks for the ego boost.”
you were there, I never stopped believing in you!” and other glowing exclamations of awe and delight.
No, I don’t believe it. He’s planning something. I ain’t gonna rest easy until I know for sure.”
That gets Chuck’s attention. “Yeah?”
And it’s not like Castiel is resurrecting Dean again, putting him back in a new mortal body, one he’s rebuilt atom by atom, cell by cell like he did before…
A nervous look graces his features, and his gills --
Happy tears are a luxury Dean is just now learning he can have.
He doesn’t quite ignore the clamor of praise, the new round of tears and awed expressions at his declaration. With a wink and that little, awkward half wave, he snaps his fingers and leaves heaven for the last time with a smile on his face.
“Everyone woke up when Billie sent Jack to the Empty. The Shadow was beside herself with rage.” He pauses. “But you probably already knew that.”
Dean flinches. “And forgot about you.”
Dean turned his head to stare at him. His head was throbbing again, and the stress of the movement had thoroughly exhausted him. “Thanks, man.”
Castiel tilts his head at Dean with a meaningful expression. “He did bring everyone back.” He shakes his head as if to clear something up within himself, then takes a breath. “Because of the deal I made with her, the Shadow was, ah, fond of me. Wanted to keep me like a ‘pet’.” There are the air quotes he loves so much, hanging around the last word. This is Cas, in the flesh. He’s really here.
The weight pinning him against the mattress is briefly lifted as Castiel goes, presumably to retrieve the angel blade he had thrown aside before. Dean watches him with half-lidded eyes, watches as the sharp ridge of his spine makes itself apparent, jutting out as he bends over to retrieve the item.
There’s a random guy out there, probably dead for all intents and purposes, and literally all Dean can think about right now is getting arrested.
Didn’t seem to be worth it, though. Not like he could, anyway.
Bewildered, he snaps his head back to the window. Everything seems about right; the lawn’s a bright summery green, clipped tidy, the azaleas out front have seen better days but are still pulling through, and nothing seems out of the ordinary at first.
“It’s Eileen,” he whispers, sounding strangled. “She just sent me a text. She’s okay. She’s
Dean stops in his tracks. “Huh?”
The cliff was small and plateaued at the top like a small table, with small pebbles littering its base. After gently propping Dean up against its incline, making sure to carefully straighten his legs out in front of him, the stranger sat on the ground next to him with a huff. His gaze was unseeing.
“Wh — and that’s it? No catch?” Dean manages to stammer out after about a minute of thunderous silence. Shock turns into burning suspicion. “What the hell are you up to now?”
Several minutes later, wordlessly — because what more is there to say? — Dean allows Michael to press two fingers to his temple and take him home.
Castiel kisses the shell of his ear in response and begins to move.
“I dunno, man.”
So he gave up, laying back with a pained huff. He was going to die here, anyway.
Dean forces himself to speak, and when he does it comes out hoarse and a little high pitched. “Y-yeah.” He clears his throat. “Yeah, Cas.”
And he hears Cas smile somehow, hears his mouth spread wide as he commands him. “Come for me, Dean.”
A twinge of guilt escapes him like the first sparks of a flame, but he puts it out before it can spread any further. “Hey,” he wheedles, with a little half smile and a wiggle of the fingers.
“I can’t tell what’s going on with your left leg, but it’s safe to say it’s probably just bruised or something.”
“I need you,” Dean is saying through heaving, stuttering breaths, burying his face deeper into Castiel’s shoulder. He smells of ocean water and earth, of grass after rain and morning dew. “I’ve always needed you, I was so fuckin’ wrecked without you, please — “
“Of course, how could I forget? You want to use our combined powers to build a
Small crabs scuttled beside his limp form busily, distracting him from his morbid thoughts. A bird wove in and out among the sun bleached clouds like a kite. The sky was blue and serene. It would be the last thing Dean would ever see, he thought as he listened to the ocean waves crashing upon the shore.
No, he can’t be.
That throws him over the edge, and with a strangled cry he’s spilling all over them, rivulets of cum dripping onto the mattress and around the defined ridges of his abs.
“Billie said that,” he whispers, the sound stifled and hollow, “when I died, she was gonna throw me into the Empty, since I wouldn’t stay where I was supposed to stay. So I figured…”
“Hah.” Sam says. “Right. Anyway.” He looks like he is readying himself for the worst. “Is it too late to ask you to leave us alone? No strings attached, no special favors. Just you go off to wherever and we go off to wherever, so we can all live our own lives. And,” his voice turns small, as though he were a kid asking his parents for an extra cookie before bedtime, “can you please put everyone back?”
He turns to look to his right, where Michael is standing, stiff as a board. Emotionless, impassive outwardly, but God can feel anger and the beginnings of anxiety gnawing on his firstborn son’s innards just as if the feelings were his own.
A few more thrusts and he can’t take it anymore, teeth grinding as he struggles to hold it in. “Cas, baby, I’m gonna...I don’t think I can…”
“Adam?” Dean tries to say, but it comes out sounding jumbled up like
The Shadow freezes as he places a hand on her shoulder.
“Jack will appreciate it nonetheless,” purrs Castiel without preamble, stretching out into Dean's arms. “He’s a good kid.”
. Whatever.
In their last few years on Earth he’d forgotten what his favorite soul had looked like. That, he thinks as he blindly draws symbols into Dean’s bare chest, had to have been the worst part of losing his grace, being human for the time that he was.
Even now does her praise affect him more than he would care to admit. ”Thanks, sis,” he says gruffly, and he finds that he means it more than ever. She comes to sit next to him, one leg swept over the other and her hands folded neatly in her lap.
Smiling sadly, God shakes his head. “No,” he says, shoving a hand into the pocket of his windbreaker. An all too human gesture that he was especially fond of back on Earth. “No,” he repeats, “I’m not fit to rule Heaven any longer.”
“Do not interrupt me.” Cas growls. Dean falls silent.
, Dean thinks to himself.
“Say, have you ever… wanted to be human?” Chuck asks her. “Like,
Heaven is … less bright than it was when he left it. Despite being entirely metaphysical, its structures are in disarray, like a great big house in the sky that’s been left abandoned, its floorboards left to rot and cobwebs dusting every conceivable corner. Broken windows, leaky pipes, et cetera. He hadn’t cared enough to pay attention on his last trip here, but now it’s all he can see.
Of course, they haven’t stopped looking for him. Everyone who’s ever worked with the Winchesters knows to call them if they catch any glimpse of a trenchcoat-wearing angel with too blue eyes, if something suspicious pops up on the grapevine. Days and days pass with Dean struggling to keep his eyes open as he sits by the phone, waiting for something —
He considers calling Charlie up again. She’s been his best friend since literally day one, and absolutely would drop everything to hear his sorry ass out as she has on multiple occasions, especially in this past month. He loves her for that. But then he remembers she’s off in Spain honeymooning with her wife; he’d much rather tough it out like a real man than even think about interrupting those two lovebirds.
have crossed my mind,” whispers Castiel, and snakes his hand around the back of Dean’s neck to reel him in for another kiss. After all, things can wait now. They’ve got all the time in the world.
Dean bit back a scream. “I think so, but not — not for long.” His bones lurched and jarred against themselves. He clenched his teeth in agony.
Chuck waited, not saying anything because that’s precisely what they are.
“Yeah. Problem?”
Adam looks annoyed. “You were praying.” His face shifts then, his eyes widening for a moment before his expression schools to something much more clinical than should be seen on a guy still in college.
“The Righteous Man, who possesses the purest soul in all of creation, the true Sword of Michael, falls at the sight of his savior and charge murdering his extradimensional self in cold blood,” Cas says in a sultry tone.
The pause that ensues is almost tangible, painful and hanging on Dean’s throat much like the burn of alcohol does. Yet it does nothing similar to take his pain away, his chagrin at the truth of Michael’s words. Even Adam seems to say nothing in his defense, shocked into silence. It’s not like Dean ever deserved it in the first place.
Dean shrugged, then remembered that he wouldn’t be able to see it. “Beats me.”
Castiel can’t move. He tries to will his traitorous human legs to work but they remain frozen to the spot. He can only stand there, rooted, watching with bated breath as Dean slowly, surely, carefully works his gaze upward, to the opposite side of the room, and those dull green eyes fixate on him.
“I’m not gonna pretend like I’m one hundred percent prepared for any danger that might come at us,” Dean says, grimacing slightly, “but. I want to be here for you. Even if it might be dangerous. I can hold my own, and I won’t hold you back, either, if that’s what you’re worried about.”
“Don’t ask me,” grouses Dean. “This was Sam’s idea.”
“What if I …” Chuck frowns, sighs, then tries again. “How would you like to be one? ...Human, I mean.”
“Hey, gross,” Chuck smiles weakly, trying to lighten the mood. Still, his stomach twists at her words. “Don’t get all sappy on me. I'm sitting right here.”
Dean pauses, like he is mulling this over. “...I can’t,” he says finally.
“Oh, nothing like this,” Dean says in awe, rejoining Castiel in the living room. He can only hope that people will be able to come up with tech like that in his lifetime. He considers asking Cas if he can share his knowledge with people, but that’s probably not a good idea if the comic books he reads are anything to go by — people suck. He grins. “But we do have sweet rides in our own right,” as he gestures to the garage.
“Human,” Dean echoes faintly.
He turns to look at Michael. “My last request,” he says, aiming it solely at him, trying to fit in thousands of years worth of regret and missed birthdays into his tone. He wonders if Michael will ever forgive him. Wonders if he even deserves it. “Is that you try not to start anymore apocalypses like I did.”
You could never do as you were told, unless it was your dad doing the telling.” He laughs. “But I guess I made you that way. Both you and your angel.”
“Well, Chuck happened.”
He’s in his room, polishing his gun when the door creaks open. Blue eyes peer at him from around the doorframe and he pauses.
Shaking his head warmly, Castiel starts the trek back to their house, Dean swiftly at his heels despite the brisk pace threatening to take the breath out of his lungs again. “I, ah, will be needing to use your tools again,” the alien says to him after a while, apology coloring his tone. “If that's all right.”
“So you wanted to give everyone in the Empty a second chance?”
human?”
“And who better,” Cas hums, “to take up the arduous task of bringing you to orgasm,” he twists the knife into Dean’s skin, drawing a thin bead of blood from the indent he makes, “than me?”
slick, brooding and moping and chugging enough alcohol to drink an elephant under the table for your ‘brother in arms’.”
“Hm?”
Sam smiles that uncomfortable half-smile again. “It’s why we prayed to you to meet us here. Will you hear me out?”
Sam places a grounding hand on his arm. “Maybe we shouldn’t look the gift horse in the mouth, Dean,” he says meaningfully.
“There’d be no one left in here but you, just you.” He scratches his beard, then jams his hands into his pockets, looking uncertain. “Just you, and me.”
Dutiful, obedient children that were abandoned, thrown away, and had to pick up the pieces of a metaphorically broken vase all on their own.
“Your ship… will you be able to make it back okay?” Dean asks. He hates himself for how transparent he’s being. Luckily, Castiel doesn’t notice.
“I’m not bleeding. Just bruised a little.”
when it comes to what you want." There's a subtle jolt in her shoulders. "My wonderful, special little brother.”
Out of sheer habit, Chuck looks at Dean to find that he’s looking back at nothing. The easy smile he’d been wearing fades. Quiet falls over the church once more, darkness shifting in, as the sun slides lower into the sky. On the carpet, a lit up cross is stretched out and distorted.
Chuck raises his head skyward, to where the window is casting the last glimmers of evening light into the church, and finally asks himself the burning question: What is he doing?
Cas holds him through the rest of it, carding gentle fingers through his hair and waiting for his breathing to even out. Dean relaxes into the touch, and after an eternity and a half he pulls back, red-eyed and awestruck, staring at Castiel like he’s the most beautiful, precious thing in the world. Because he is, and Dean never got to say it before, or even show it.
A few heartbeats later, when he’s managed to catch his breath and his eyes aren’t burning as much, Dean lifts his head. “...You’re right,” he manages as his voice cracks. “Everything you said. You’re right.”
The archangel sighs, unceremoniously dropping the giant lump he’d been holding. It hits the ground with a muffled string of curses. “I found him on the outskirts of town, half-dead from alcohol poisoning,” he drawls. “Consider this a favor. And keep a better eye on him next time.” His gaze travels to Castiel, stiffening just a fraction, and then he nods at him before turning away. “Farewell.”
“I get it, Dean. I understand why you chose him and not me,” Adam says sadly. “I get why you did what you did. When you live like that and need to look out for the only family you’ve ever had, making tough decisions is the only way to survive.”
“This is how it’s gonna be, isn’t it?” Chuck says, a slight, vacant smile on his face. “No matter how hard I try.” He shrugs. “Okay. You win.”
change in plans,” Chuck grins.
“That obvious, huh.” Dean says sarcastically, and Cas deflates a little.
But Cas is different, though. Something about him makes Dean feel … free. And open, somehow. It makes him want to push forward despite the lingering urge to shut down entirely. “I spent a lot of my childhood doing … things that a kid shouldn’t even be thinking about, let alone do. It was … tough, to put it lightly.”
“Who knows.”
The guns are loaded in the back seat. Chuck is gone, everyone is back.
“Cas?”
“Y-yeah?”
“I’m here now, Dean,” he murmurs, over and over. “I’m here.”
They listened to the crescendo of the ocean waves beating rhythmically against the shore. Dean looked out at the beach around him and saw crystal clear waters humming gently, the bright teal closer to shore gradually fading out into a darker, richer blue further away from the island. The rustle of palm trees in the air, and the cry of a seagull snapped him out of his reverie.
But the call never comes.
Cas’ startled words remind him of Ben for only a second before he’s pushed that train of thought away entirely, no thanks. Instead he focuses on the baby he still has —Dad had given the car to him when he’d turned eighteen, as a birthday present. She’s driven him across state lines and away from law enforcement on multiple occasions. She’s got the scars of their childhood, his and Sam’s, etched into her upholstery. Been in the family for decades, and Dean’s put his blood, sweat, and tears into getting her to run just as smoothly as when they first got her. It’s clearly paid off.
the making in all cases.
“I’ll admit other…
He stabs it a bit harder, more insistently. The mass squeaks suddenly, an undignified noise, and flips over onto his back.
“Do you not want to be?”
“Sam did.”
“You gonna fridge all three of us in one go?” Comes Dean’s voice, low and guttural like a chainsaw through shattered concrete. “Is that your plan?”
It was funny how he’d been more afraid of airplanes as a medium of transportation before today. Dean had vehemently forbade Sam to book him plane tickets, instead choosing to travel in a cruise ship because there was no way he was gonna go on one of those “flying metal tin cans of death” ever again.
“Uh..” Dean said quizzically. Was this guy messing around? “Y-yeah, will do.”
“But… it’s not just a story anymore,” Sam says. “And I think you know that.”
But the guy nods again, more vigorously, and he breathes a sigh of relief.
” now it’s his turn to pull out the puppy eyes. “Don’t we deserve that much?”
“I killed their mother, all of those angels. So many people. If anyone deserves to be punished for everything that’s happened, it’s me.”  Then he turns back to Chuck. “Take me instead. Please, leave my family alone.” There's so much conviction in his face, so much willingness to protect them despite the obvious fear coming off of him in waves.
of times over. Sure, even if all the other ones might have been… imitations, of the real thing, you said it yourself,” He grimaces. “None of it could ever compare to the real thing.”
“Oh, of course. It's about where you go afterward, isn’t it?” Chuck laughs without a care in the world. “Not to worry, sis. My replacement up in Heaven is going to be a very effective one. And I can tell him to pull a few strings for you, if need be. You’ll continue your existence there, of course, with the angels and other souls. I’ll make you one… a soul, of course, if you agree.”
Wheezing softly, he hurries to catch up to Castiel, whose brisk pace has left Dean in the dust. They’re in the middle of woods too shallow to get lost in, but deep enough that no one will easily notice the large, smoking wreck in the middle of the clearing. Well, unless they came in far enough.
“You’re wrong,” Jack says as his eyes flash orange-gold. He hasn’t called the bluff. “When I went to the Empty, it changed me. Something’s wrong with me, I can feel it. I — “ His face tilts upwards, slowly, until the beseeching, angry puppy dog look is turned on Chuck full force. “She told me I was different.”
his alter ego, it comes back with full force whenever he’s even around the angel. It sounds so fucked up when he thinks about it, but he’s left spectacularly hard and breathless when his thoughts wander to what Cas could be doing to
The angel smiles. “Oh, I’m not bothered, Dean. In fact, I’m flattered.
Sam nudges him and shoots him a signature bitchface. “Sorry about Dean,” he says to Chuck, ever the pacifist. It’s strange to see him do such a one-eighty, though, considering they’d been out for his blood not three days ago. Is this their way of conceding defeat? “He’s, uh. Y’know. A little broken up about everything that’s happened.”
“Uh, yeah,” Dean scratches the back of his neck,” How can you understand me now? Did you understand me before? Are you an alien? What’s your name?” The words seem to come out of their own volition, and he snaps his mouth shut before he can make any more of a fool out of himself.
“Tell me what I did wrong, Dean,” he pleads, placing his hand on Dean’s left shoulder. The angel-hickey Cas left in the form of a handprint has long since disappeared, but he feels something nonetheless, a sudden, spine-tingling heat which shoots straight into his dick. He hisses quietly, and Cas pulls away like
“They’re waiting for you,” Adam murmurs, seeming to have read his thoughts. “They’re worried about you, too. Michael hears them now. So go make it right.”
“The mass redistributor. It allows me to change the size of the vessel to anything...well, anything within the regulations set by this planet's gravitational field.”
“Oh, everything’s j-just fine!” Dean exclaims, discreetly lowering his gun as he tries to cover up the painfully obvious tent in his jeans. Castiel follows the movement with his eyes, but says nothing about it and Dean inwardly sighs in relief.
“Just like that.” Chuck confirms.
He is a writer. The characters, the plots, the settings. Everything is his.
They hold each other in the silence of the room, just lying there, basking in each other’s warmth.
As happy as he is for everyone else, It’s a testament to Dean’s shit luck that, despite every single demon and angel to have ever existed coming back to life in one fell swoop, the one he’d wanted to return to him the most still hasn’t shown his stupid mug.
he urged himself, but even to him the command seemed futile.
Just shows how far he’s come with the whole loving humanity thing. Even if it has screwed him over.
an ending that they’ve deserved from the start but was never guaranteed.
Everyone snaps up when Jack speaks. “I can kill you, I think,” are the first words out of the boy's mouth. The nephilim says them with childish uncertainty, but his hands are gripped into loose fists. “If it comes to that. Or at least, I can hold you off long enough for them to get away.”
Swaths of water licked at his aching body in cool, stinging ripples. The clothes on his body were torn, damaged beyond repair. His mouth tasted of salt and iron. Dean spit out a glob of something unidentifiable onto the sand, grimacing.
Bewildered, Cas gapes at him. “I...I don’t…” His eyes trail down Dean’s body in bemused appraisal until he reaches the part of him that’s now perked up in interest once more. His eyes widen in understanding.
They both ignore the words that go unsaid.
And then the damn ship had crashed somehow, he didn’t know where, but the sea had generously deposited him onto this island, the name of which he couldn’t even begin to figure out either. If anyone else had survived, he didn’t know. All those people, too. A railspike of nausea stabbed through his gut and left him heaving silently.
world, and
“Might wanna hear me out before you say that,” God insists. “I’ve got a feeling you’ll like what I have to offer.”
“But what will an apology do?” the Shadow shrieks, tossing her head back and forth, Everything about her is frazzled, jump-started into restless action. “Everyone is
Dean’s not sure which one of them sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose, but he wants to bet money that it’s still Michael. “If I hadn’t come, how likely is it that you’d have given yourself some buckshot to the face by the end of tonight?” That’s Adam. Guess he was wrong.
“That some sort of...translator or something?” Dean says uncertainly, pointing at his own mouth and emphasizing the syllables to imitate speaking. The guy nods slowly, seeming uncertain. “And, uh… is it broken? Do you need help fixing it?” Dean mimes fixing something the best he can, unsure if the message is getting through.
Sam waits for Dean’s fidget of affirmation before he starts speaking. “You keep treating us, like — “ Sam’s hands clench and unclench into fists before him. Overhead, the stained glass windows are beginning to reflect deeper reds and greens and blues in through the window, throwing a kaleidoscope of colors onto the carpeted floor. “Like characters, in a story. Things you get to control and use.”
Glancing sideways, Dean frowns. “Oh,” he says.
“Dean-“
Just because they don't operate on the same principles of time doesn't mean Castiel forgets dates. He also doesn't care
“You do not know what you are saying,” Castiel says to him sadly, making Dean pause. But then his gaze brightens considerably, the gold receding back and letting the blue bleed through again. They glow at him with newfound gratitude. “But I thank you, Dean Winchester. For your bountiful kindness and hospitality.”
“I want to make you a deal,” God repeats, gentler still. His hand remains poised above the Empty’s shoulder, unsure of what to do. He never was too good at offering physical comfort.
He grins at her. “It's a funny story, actually.”
Cas relaxes. “Oh, it’s you, Dean.”
“I suppose we do have a Mother,” says Castiel. “She lays the eggs, which are fertilized by drones that are only used for that purpose. They die soon after, so we never get to know them.”
,” he punctuates this by grabbing hold of the back of Dean’s head, burying his fingers into his hair, and pulling him closer so their foreheads are nearly touching, “my sword into his body?
“Lord our God, Father of All,
“Perhaps I was too hasty in seeking shelter with you,” Castiel says quickly. “If my suspicions are correct, then I might be endangering you by staying with you any longer. You have my deepest apologies.”
God continues gratefully. “I have decided,” he commands, “that Michael, here, is to succeed me as the true ruler of heaven.”
Dean’s not sure what he’s gotten himself into, but there’s nothing he can do about it now, he reflects, as they walk deeper into the house.
Speechless for a moment, the elder Winchester swiftly recovers, his tone hard. “Yeah, well, he’s gone now. So it doesn’t matter.”
“We didn’t know how to run heaven before,” adds Naomi solemnly. “There was no
A cold steel tip to the spot just under his jawline makes him start violently, but Castiel’s holding him back so he can’t move out of the way. Tugs his hair gently, and Dean’s suddenly looking up at the ceiling while his best friend’s got an angel blade at his throat.
place for all those dead things to go, before you go and be dead in their place.”
“Eileen’s whipping up something nice for him in the Roadhouse kitchen,” Dean continues, oblivious to Castiel’s inner monologue, “sounds like it’s gonna be Angel food cake. Is that kismet or what?”
“Yeah?” He hasn’t even mentioned Castiel by name yet, and already Dean is angry, just like that. “What do you know about me and Cas, huh?”
Chuck rolls his eyes. “Don’t let me stop you,” he mutters.
— forgive me if I leer at the idea that you might actually see him that way — die to further your cause.” Dean flinches at that one and has the decency to look ashamed.
least of all me.”
“Yeah?” Dean asks nervously, licking his own.
“Hmm, yeah?” Dean asks, attention diverted from whatever he was doing. “What is it?”
Castiel looks uncertain. “Well, I recall learning that humans, being highly social creatures, lived in groups known as ‘families’. Yet you are alone. Why is that?”
“The Empty?” Sam and Dean ask in unison.
He pulls out slowly, then fucks in even slower. His pace is slow, torturous; while the other men Dean have been with were fast, sloppy even, Cas takes his sweet fucking time, gradually increasing his pace until he’s slamming into Dean so hard that his jaw quivers and his body jerks.
Chuck finds, with steadily increasing dismay, that they're starting to work on him.
Dean is staring straight ahead, a hard edge to his jaw that’s markedly different from his usual brooding. Mulling it all over. Jack, on the other hand, is smiling along to Sam’s speechless delight like he’s only just realized what is going on.
Overhead, the church steeple shoots up like an arrow bursting into the sky, surrounded by vacant suburbia. It’s like a graveyard after dark, or a ghost town. What makes it eerier is the fact that there’s no one around anymore. A place of his worship seems like the best place to end this saga he’d put so much care into spinning.
Dean chuckles dryly, trying to hide the sheer elation he feels at Castiel’s acceptance. “Like I said, Cas, you’re welcome to stay for as long as you need. Since we’re … friends.” The taste of that word is nice.
“So let’s do it.”
“Glad you finally noticed,” God smirks, ignoring the tilt of her head. He gazes around at the infinite expanse of nothingness around him, taking it in. “I’ve given myself a little upgrade.”
Wind rustles the grass and turns the lawn into a glimmering emerald sea. The stranger’s hair ruffles in the breeze, but the rest of him remains eerily still. From this angle, Dean muses, his skin looks almost bluish. Is it too late?
boy,” Dean mutters, pacing in front of his window as the gravity of the situation sinks in, “This is not good. Not good at all.”
“Maybe,” Castiel hums. Dean feels the wild urge to gather him up in his arms again. There’s nothing stopping him from doing what he wants anymore. No one to control him. So he goes in for another embrace, unafraid about what it’ll mean for the first time in his entire life, and Castiel melts into it without any hesitation. “The Shadow wanted me to suffer with them for all eternity. But God …
“Now don’t you judge me, feathers,” Dean growls. “You don’t get to.”
“Hello?”
Dean nodded absentmindedly. Sitting in one position had made his ankle stop throbbing so much, and things were much clearer when the haze of pain was reduced to a low thrum from the loud roar it had been. “Yeah, maybe.”
“I want to make you a deal,” he says.
Michael’s eyes are suspiciously red. The small, trembling quirk of his lips are also suspect. But he nods.
“But how are we going to move you?” Castiel asked. “Should you even be moved right now?”
“After you just got back?” whines Eremiel from the back.
They’ve just finished saving alt-Charlie and that asshole Ketch when Dean realizes that Cas is no longer following him. Sawed-off shotgun at the ready, he creeps back into the shack they went in and crouches low, whispering for Cas to get his (not-so) feathery ass over here before Michael’s reinforcements arrive.
“So you mean to tell me,” he croons, leaning forward slowly and taking the gun out of the hunter’s hands and placing it aside on the nightstand, “that you liked seeing me pin myself against the wall? That you liked it when I
“Cas,” Dean grits out, as Castiel sets to the task of delicately tracing each and every one of the freckles which mottle his pectorals, “Can we get moving, please?”
Dean waited for him to continue wearily. The stranger looked alarmed for a minute, but seemed to regain himself.
“That’s only the start of what I had to say,” winces God. Now the sounds of demons and angels alike are too loud for even him to ignore, an unending, unified screech of pain and pure regret. “What if I told you that you could go back to the peace and quiet?”
“You don’t have to be sorry for anything,” Dean insists before he can say anything further, the tears threatening to take hold again. He leans back, presses his lips against Castiel’s temple, letting them rest there. “If anything, it’s me who should be sorry. Letting you go like that, letting you think I didn’t feel the same way about you — “
He powers through, ignoring the denials of said absence from most of the crowd surrounding him. There are maybe ten or fifteen angels left, tops, none of whom God can immediately remember by name. Has it really been that long? “I know that I left specific directions to you all before I left. And certain events ….” he cringes inwardly at the thought of all those failed plotlines, “made it impossible for you to fulfill them. Multiple times.”
Cas seemed to remember something, standing up slowly. His black suit was dusted with a thin film of powdery sand. “Well, we should probably find shelter before night falls.”
The world seems to move in slow motion. Chuck snaps his fingers, watching as all three of them jump forward in alarm, the beginnings of a unified shout escaping their lips — what else
Castiel says, “you’re sure about this, then?”
while you get your bearings back together, uh. It shouldn’t be a problem. You. Staying here. With me, I mean.”
Naomi preens under his gaze and offers no comment.
That’s all I wanted to do, that’s all I ever asked or wanted or needed from you but you
“Need something, Cas?” he asks, keeping his voice casual, although his heart thrums within his chest.
“What sort of ‘things’?”
flutter strangely in agitation. God, Dean’s never gonna get used to those. “I...do not seem to remember where I’m from.”
A face came into his view, blurring and hazy at the edges. It slipped in and out of Dean’s focus. “There’s a problem,” it said, concerned and sounding strange even to his waterlogged ears.
“What about your mom?” Dean asks incredulously, “Or your dad?”
“If aliens exist, how come they never visited earth?”
Damn it. He’s ruined.
Pleasure mingles with pain and Dean mewls with contentment as Cas thrusts into him harder still. “You like that, don’t you?” Cas mock-asks, nosing at the taut line of his neck. Dean finds himself unable to say anything other than the endless litany of
“I figured, hey, maybe it’s not too bad, kicking the bucket now. After everything that’s happened…” he heaves a parched sob. “Maybe Sam and Jack would have a shot at being normal without having me around to fuck it all up. N’ maybe…”
“Please, Dean.” Chuck shoots him a condescending smile. “I could have gotten Jack back here myseIf if I wanted to. Heck, I could have gotten the whole Impala in here and crushed you three in it with a snap of these.” He wiggles his fingers. “No, I just wanted to have a little one-on-one chat with my best pal.”
Never in a million years had Castiel thought this was the way it was going to play out, him and Dean, alive but technically dead but also
Something has changed, but Chuck can’t put his finger on what. Jack is looking at him with concern.
Because this thing, this twinge of arousal he had felt watching Cas
Sam comes into the room and claps him on the back. “Trust me, Cas,” he says, beaming down at him as Eileen slides her arms around his chest and gets up on her toes to kiss him. “Dean’s been pretending like nothing’s wrong for the past three weeks. He goes out on hunts for days and comes back and holes himself up in his room. If we try to talk to him about anything he just clams up.” His face dulls a little, and Cas hopes after today he’ll never have to see that look on any of them again. “And he hasn’t been picking up his phone.”
“Even if you couldn’t get the ending you wanted for us, because
Deep in thought, the alien frowns. “Well, no.” At Dean’s questioning look, he shrugs. It’s another disarmingly human gesture. “My species only reproduces in dire times. We live astonishingly long for an oviparous species. There is really no need for “families, as a result.”
He makes sure to hit that sweet spot within his ass
“You shouldn’t be here,” the Shadow growls.
There’s another problem too, because now all he can think about is the way Castiel pinned the other Cas against the wall like that, how fucking
And it scares him.
As intent as he still is upon sticking to the plan, he has to admit that Dean’s words have struck something in him, a tiny, insistent voice in the back of his head that won’t abate. So the least he can do is humor it and listen to the rest of whatever they have to say before he does, in fact, go through with it.
“Bullshit. You’ve got us all in a chokehold and you know it. You know exactly what the hell we’re doing here and you aren’t going to budge. So stop dragging it on and do what you want to do already.”
“I think Sam and Dean are right,” the nephilim says, glancing at them and back at him nervously. “I think … they deserve some peace now. After everything.”
Dean gets the guy sitting down at the dining table, telling him to sit tight as he goes to look for the toolbox. He doesn’t know if they’ll work, but it’s worth a try, right? He also gets to see the visitor sniff at the cup of coffee he’d left out earlier in his haste, recoiling slightly at the smell. Warm amusement curls up in him as he creeps out of the kitchen.
Cas doesn’t answer, and the answer comes to Dean suddenly in a blinding flash of realization.
, wet lips pursing as they close around it.
There is an awkward pause. Dean doesn’t know what to say. That one kind of stings. “Don’t you have families back at your place?” He asks wearily, choosing to avoid the question entirely. He’s too tired for this.
“I’m tired, Amara.” He sighs. “Every story has to end. I tried to keep it going, only wanting to end it because it felt like the story was coming apart, cause the characters weren’t listening to me but,” he lets the leaf he’d been holding drift away from his fingers, watching it twirl to the ground in an easy dance. “Maybe I was going about it in the entirely wrong way. Maybe it’s time we let the stories end themselves for a change, no higher powers involved.”
There’s that odd clench in his chest again. “I’ve decided,” he says, taking a deep breath, “that Heaven is going to fall under new management.” A wave of hushed whispers go up in the air. Even Michael seems surprised.
Fuck you too, Lisa.
The corner of Castiel’s lips quirk into the smallest smile. “That much is true.”
Dean sucks in a breath. The ship is a bit bigger than a tank, disc-shaped and plated with a strange chrome that shimmers a pale, insistent blue. It’s incredible. Instantly he is reminded of Castiel’s eyes. The vessel is lodged in the earth in a way that leaves the entrance (if that’s what it is) partially buried and the rest of it leaning upwards out of the dirt like a billboard. There’s no way they’d be able to get inside.
He’s gone before they can get another word out.
After a monumental effort, and pain so intense it had him sobbing breathlessly into his enclosed fist, Dean found himself lying on his back, eyes shielded from the blinding sun by an arm thrown haphazardly over his face. His legs lay still and vulnerable, and Dean found that while one of them responded weakly to his motions, the other fell alight with searing pain at the base and refused to yield, even when he tried to kick and claw and gain traction against the liquidlike sand.
Maybe things are going to look up from now on. They’ve got the rest of their lives ahead of them to figure it out.
“C-colder,” Dean slurred. A trickle of saliva threatened to dribble down his cheek. He licked most of it away, then wet his lips uncertainly. “You’re by my, uh, left leg.”
Someone had attached lead weights to his eyes. Dean fought to keep them open, but he was failing fast. “No, I don’t think so.”
Quietly, Sam and Eileen exchange a glance before leaving the room, taking Jack with them. Footsteps echo in the hallway and fade out, but all Dean can think about right now is the grounding weight in front of him. The floor is theirs. They’ve got all the time in the world.
Seeing him is all it takes for Dean’s voice to crack, pressed under the weight of grief, and it’s all falling to pieces and he closes that distance into a warmth he never thought he’d feel again beneath his fingers. Castiel grasps at him like he’s an anchor, fisting his own hands in the sleeves of that jacket Dean would never think about taking off again, because the handprint left there was going to be the last thing he’d have to remember Castiel by, and he promised himself he was going to die with it, right where it belonged.
Castiel has been with them - him and Sammy - since the beginning, ever since the breaking of the first seal. He pulled Dean out of hell, for Christ’s sake. He’s looked at the Winchesters, looked at Dean with nothing but love, and forgiveness, and adoration. And hell if he doesn’t deserve the same affection in return.
“Everything in the clear?” he quips.
“You humans are...all so different,” Castiel says thoughtfully, “So colorful in your thoughts. But my brethren…while our appearances are dissimilar, our minds are all the same.” He turns to look at Dean, and there’s a fondness in his gaze. “There is no individuality, no dissent or any differing opinions. Only assimilation.”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “Don’t be crass, Dean.” But the thought makes him smile anyway. He shifts as Dean’s thigh straddles his legs apart, as those soft fingers ruck his shirt up and come to tweak a nipple between them.
“I did,” Dean says quietly.
“For starters, this.”
Sam and Eileen rush to Dean’s side, heaving him onto his feet and checking him out. “Did he hurt you?” Sam demands, the beginnings of fury beginning to erupt on his face.
Cas takes the box with something akin to reverence. He runs his fingers over the box like it’s a long lost lover, opening it and pulling the tools out with the kind of care Dean reserves for his baby. This is so fucking
“I am.” Chuck corrects himself with a grimace, “or at least, I was.”
The nephilim, unsurprisingly, goes about it in a completely different way, more polite and subdued like the way his chosen father had acted. Everything about him, from squinty eyes to the cheekbones to floppy, permanently-mussed hair, the quirk of the brow, suggests nothing about him having ever been Lucifer’s. It’s as though he’s looking at a younger mirror image of that infuriating angel of Thursday, but the idea somehow fails to annoy Chuck more than he thought it would.
It was getting harder to keep his eyes open. His vision blurred, then dimmed. “Hey, if you get out of here...”
“Yeah?” Dean grins, “I guess we can be pretty cool.”
that’s coming out of his mouth and can only throw his head back and take what he’s being given. The vice grip Castiel has on his hip is going to leave bruises on him for tomorrow but he finds that he doesn’t care anymore, just wants to be allowed to come because tears are pricking at his eyes and god he wants to let loose but he can’t.
“It means I’m going to stay out of your hair from now on. You win,” Chuck repeats, defeat settling into his bones. “This has gone on for too long, and I’ve just now come to the conclusion that I’m too tired to give a crap anymore.” He won’t let them see any more of the crushing shame he’s currently feeling. Wouldn’t let them win
to think anymore.”
The look on Castiel’s face is both alarmed and upset. “It means that I was being pursued.”
That’s what Chuck had thought, going into it. Now, he’s been made to rethink a few things. Which is strange, considering he doesn’t get
He doesn’t take the jacket off.
The pair of eyes staring back are bluer than they’ve ever been. Dean wants to bask in them, hold him close and drown in them, never look away again. They’re clearer than he remembers, the kind of bright that burns through him and pins him there, capable of so much warmth and love that he did not — still does not deserve.
Without bothering to answer, Castiel tightens his hold, his legs parting Dean’s, tangling them together into one big messy pile of limbs that Dean has no hope of escaping from. He feels the inevitable sigh of surrender and smiles to himself.
“Castiel.” The man said without looking up. His gaze was focused on a small seashell lying by his feet, although Dean doubted he could see it at all. “And you’re welcome.”
, it hurts, and Cas better hurry the fuck up and get over here or Dean’s gonna disobey and jerk himself off.
Why does he want this so badly?
If Cas really was being chased by something then whoever — or
Ten or fifteen pairs of eyes shift over to Michael, who sends a shocked, questioning look back at him. A chain of gazes, of approval.
A pair of warm hands grab him by the shoulders and lift him up with surprising strength, but there is nothing to support him once he’s up. His legs have stopped working; if not for the arms keeping him suspended, he would have keeled right over again. Bile threatens to rise up in the back of his throat, mingled with the sour taste of alcohol. The world is muddled and bizarre shapes are sliding into each other in his peripherals.
The guy’s head perks up as Dean beckons him, and his eyes shine almost like a puppy’s would. It’d be really cute if Dean knew what the fuck he was. He trails Dean almost hesitantly, as if he expects to get jumped the minute he lowers his guard.
“Might you know where we are?” Castiel asked suddenly, without looking at him.
The man guided him shakily to his feet. Excruciating pain followed Dean at every slight movement, scorning his every step. His muscles ached, arms sore as he was drawn up to lean on his left foot, the other hanging loosely off to the side. The man supported Dean’s weight without flinching.
“Cas…” Dean whines as Castiel sucks a bruise into the side of his neck. He’s being so gentle, and slow, but Dean can’t do either of those things right now. He bucks up insistently into Cas’ hips, and feels the hardness there mirroring his own. Cas stills him with a hand.
“You’re an ass,” Dean laughs.
“I’m going to need you to do that again,” Castiel laughs breathlessly, and grabs him by the lapel of his jacket to pull him back in. “Just to be sure.”
“What makes you think I would do that?” Chuck asks slowly. “I’m primed and ready to pull the trigger on this crapfest. My greatest story turned biggest failure.”
“Hey, hold it.” Dean interrupts, green eyes flashing. “What’s this about ‘they’? This is very much a
“It can be, depending on the size I set its outward dimensions to,” Castiel’s voice echoes from the other room. A pause, and then, “do you humans have any such technology on Earth? I am not sure how … advanced you are as a race.”
he pauses, fiddling with a loose thread on Dean’s jacket, “convinced her that a mortal lifespan trapped on Earth with everything I had helped put away would … straighten me out.”
“Either I get you out of bed or the dog will,” Dean laughs into his hair, heated breath tickling his scalp. As if on cue, they can both hear the insistent scratch of nails against wood, a low, keening whine from just outside the door. “Besides, we gotta head to the Roadhouse soon. Today’s a special day, remember?”
At first, he hadn’t believed her, because your sister is legally obligated to give you nice feedback and he figured that maybe she was just trying to butter him up. But maybe she was right about some parts, he thinks, as an oak leaf drifts from the tree, still mostly green to its tips, and into his hands. There’s beauty in the little things, that much he can acknowledge. The vein patterns on the leaf. The wind in his hair, the smell of cut grass and fresh mulch wafting through the air.
He watches her, helpless as she shudders in that uncanny way of hers. She pauses to look up at him, disdain plain on her face.
Whatever tension was building up between them has coursed out of the situation, the moment broken. Castiel stands up, slowly and certainly. There’s a sort of grace in the action that has Dean gaping. “In any case, I think I have taken up enough of your time. Thank you for allowing me into your home and allowing me access to your possessions.”
“Wh —“ Dean starts. Castiel starts to walk past him and away, so Dean scrambles in front of him and holds out his hands. Call him creepy or clingy, but he won’t let this guy slip through his fingers that easily. “Now hold on just a sec, Cas. Slow down. Where will you go?”
“Yes.”
And so they went.
“You woke everybody up,” Chuck says, nodding along. “And you atomized her with the celestial-nuke, even if it was temporary. So,” he mulls this over, pulling at his scraggly beard, “you’ve absorbed some of her powers. Theirs, too.”
Castiel sighs happily, holding out his hand. In his palm is a small disk, humming softly. The woods are free of broken alien tech once more, a decently sized crater the only evidence that anything happened there. He closes his fingers around it and pulls away. “Fortunately, it was able to remember me.”
you that we are. And I’m worried about you.” Adam’s eyes are pleading. “Pretty sure Sam and Jack are, too. Where are they, anyway?”
But he does, grabbing Castiel’s arm before he can hoist himself up off the bed. “Cas, wait,” Dean sighs, waiting until Cas comes down to sit next to him again. The angel obeys, a question in his eyes.
“Well, I remember my ship landing somewhere in the woods behind your house, and then crawling over here,” Castiel muses, “but then I fell unconscious due to the trauma I sustained from the crash.”
Dean’s eyes widen. “You can speak English?”
Around them, life moves on, blind to everything they’ve had to go through. It was like God, the Darkness, the Empty, — none of it had ever existed in the first place. Jody and the girls are up in Sioux Falls, still hunting on occasion but less out of necessity than ever before. Bobby’s opened up an auto repair shop down south, Charlie settled down with her girl. Eileen’s moved into the bunker full time, and Sam smiles more than he ever has in his life, his own little nuclear family ready to go, now that Jack’s fully human again. Maybe they can have a normal life this time around.
“You are a disappointment, Dean Winchester.” Michael says with finality. “The only reason I haven’t smote you where you stand is courtesy of the brother you neglected to save.”
Dean doesn’t bother to answer that with words —after all, he’s never been any good at those — instead opting to kiss him. Castiel’s mouth is soft beneath his, full of awe and wonderment. A delighted sound escapes his throat. Before the ex-angel pulls back, before he can get too far away, Dean leans forward and pecks him on the lips once more, grinning. “That enough of an answer for you?” he rasps, realizing how disgusting they’re being but feeling too blissed out to care.
He leads them inside. “This concludes the tour of mi casa. You’re welcome to help yourself to anything I’ve got here. I’m usually off at work on the weekdays - that’s the first five days of the week - but I’m 100% yours all day Saturdays and Sundays.” And then he blushes furiously. What the hell is his deal.
The Shadow stops for a moment as she takes him in, what he’s just said. “You … are different,” she says suspiciously, now a bit calmer over the resounding, shrill wail in the background.
The angel watches him curiously, head slightly canted to the left. “Is everything alright?”
thinks Chuck with a peeved smirk on his face, ready to smite them with a snap of his fingers, but the look on Dean’s face as he comes in next to Sam gives him pause.
Castiel frowns again, taking in his words. He thumbs at the ship in his hand and fidgets, all nervous energy. “Are you absolutely certain that you are fit to defend yourself against any threat?” His voice lowers. “Even if it is one of my own? Even if they own vessels and weaponry larger than this?” gesturing to his enclosed palm.
“Oh boy,
to me.
“Don’t worry,” Jack pipes up before he can say another word. Both the brothers halt in place, the question hanging in the air. “He meant what he said.”
“I’m sorry.”
It hurt to move. It hurt to think. Everything hurt.
God turns to look at the blond angel that has spoken, the one who had been in charge thus far. A glint of challenge lights up her fierce eyes. “I will get to that in a moment,” God says, “though I have to say you’ve done remarkably well running the place in my absence, Naomi.”
The heavy sound of his footfalls echoes through the church as he leaves the two of them alone.
“Which one?”
Chuck stops what he was doing and looks at him. The Righteous Man, soul so bright it could take your eyes out, hell’s miasma notwithstanding. Now, in front of him, that bulb has dimmed considerably, like the gleam of an emerald slow-fading to camouflage.
There's a pause. “I’m sorry, too,” Jack tilts his head, frowns like Castiel, a squinty, confused air to it. “For messing all your plans up. I really didn’t mean to do that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sorry, kid,” Chuck says to him, feeling like he ought to apologize. “For, y’know, trying to kill you all those times. Don’t worry about me coming after you anymore.”
“We should, uh, get going. Sammy and the others are waiting.” He says shakily as he turns away from Castiel, deliberately angling his body away from his friend as he tries to saunter out of the shack with as much dignity as he can muster. He hears Castiel follow, and the walk back to camp is awkwardly silent.
The Roadhouse is almost completely unchanged from how it was on Earth, same creaky floorboards, the faded paint on the sign down to a tee. Aside from the new traffic of old faces that come by, once a week or more to share a drink and split hairs - all good natured, of course - over things that happened in their pasts, it’s got the same old feeling etched into its walls.
“I think we should at least give him a call and tell him about … about me,” ventures Castiel, uncertainty clouding his features. “I imagine seeing me again will be a dreadful shock.”
“...If it all goes according to plan, your fallen brothers and sisters should return to you in a few hours,” God is saying thoughtfully, “and since there are going to be so many of you, I doubt everybody will end up getting along.”
“So — what does this mean?”
Chuck has already thought up every possible plot twist, every discernible way that he can plunge the knife deeper into the Winchesters’ proverbial guts for the sake of the story. He wonders what harebrained scheme they could come up with this time to try and defy him, as if they could defy God himself.
It’s a little disconcerting to see Cas dead again, even if it isn’t his Cas, per se, but still disconcerting nonetheless, Dean thinks, then hastily amends the thought with
you won’t — “ both Dean and Jack nod solemnly at this — “you aren’t writing a story anymore. We’re real living people, in a real
“Yes?”
The cum and heat inside him warms the hilt even more as it moves. Gotta hand it to Cas, he learns quick, because apparently he hadn’t forgotten where Dean’s prostate was judging by the way he’s nailing it every single time with scary accuracy.
“What do you mean?”
Miraculously, Castiel allows him his chick flick moment and
“Just like that?” She’s apprehensive.
“More than anything,” she whispers.
A hysterical laugh bubbles in his throat, but he forces it down, feeling an odd mix of dread and excitement churn his stomach. This is the most eventful morning he’s had since, like, middle school.
“It’s crossed my mind once or twice.” Amara takes a deep breath. “Seems like it could be interesting. Why do you ask?”
“Cas-!” Dean yells, and Castiel withdraws his fingers. They catch on his rim and leave him feeling empty, but Cas is quick to return to him, the intense warmth making both of them shudder.
(See the end of the chapter for
His half brother sets him on his feet with minimal effort, mild disgust clouding his face. Dean sways and nearly falls forward. Adam catches him with an arm and holds him there like he’s made of leather and string.
Innocent as always. He's a good kid.
Stepping aside the now glassy-eyed, empty vessel and gracefully over the crackling embers of its wing imprints, Castiel turns, still tense like he’s heard something. Dean forgets he’s even standing there until he notices the angel glancing at him.
“How did you even get back?” Dean asks him. “Are you fully juiced up again?”
“I should be able to relocate it just fine, but I recall that it was damaged beyond repair during its entrance into your atmosphere.” His eyes narrow, the rings of gold around his irises flaring prominently. “Why?”
“Okay,” said the other man, not losing focus. Warmth curled around his left shoulder, squeezing uncertainly. “I’m gonna lift you up now. Bear with me.” The stranger’s voice hummed with reassurance. It was soothing, and warm. So warm.
“Huh.” Can’t say he forgives the guy for everything he’s put Dean and Sam and everyone through, but it’s a start. “Maybe he wasn’t entirely bad after all.”
introduced to them the concept of free will, autonomy. He’d left this realm behind and come back to it like the ones he’d left it to hadn’t staked their own claims on it in the meantime.
“Yeah, you don’t. I’m
“This is the best deal you’ll ever get,” God says as energy courses through his physical form. Briefly, he allows his eyes, one brilliant blue and the other the blackest night, to flash at her, a promise. “So like I said. You get me, the one who screwed everything up for you in the first place, and you get Amara — well, her powers, anyway,” he adds. “And you let everyone else go.”
“I, uh, can’t see.”
“He heard everything you said.” Michael says, but suddenly he looks unsure. Around, the angels are hushed, respectful. Murmuring amongst themselves. “Father, I — “
The archangel continues to gape, wide-eyed.
“We’re very … ah,
Watching from a safe distance in the corner of the room, Dean pauses his brooding to watch him, and he can’t help but crack a smile in response. God, he can’t remember the last time he did
“I don’t think that’s normal,” Dean mumbled. The mishandling of his legs had been enough to jolt him awake, but his head still swum dizzily.
did you change your mind, is the question I should be asking.”
about it,” is Castiel’s reply. “You humans don’t take changes to the status quo very well, as many of us have gathered.”
“I said it once already, but I’ll say it again as many times as you need. I’m
Jack turns to him. “That’s not true,” he says instantly, his tone sharpened by purpose. “Dean, I’ve done nothing but hurt you. Both of you, for as long as I’ve been alive.” The matter-of-factness in his tone forces Chuck to recall, uncomfortably, that the boy is only three years old, very much a baby and yet forced to bear such a burden this young.
“Name’s Dean,” he replied wearily. “Where’re you from?”
Conceding, Dean shifts slightly and begins to speak. “Look, I’m sorry that I wouldn’t play your part, okay?” He does not sound even remotely apologetic about this, but Chuck lets it slide. “But I just — this isn’t what I wanted. None of this. Not you, not Amara, not the friggin’ Empty,
“Yep.”
“There’s a lot of shit you don’t know about me,” Dean starts, then stops nervously. Barely met the guy and he’s already gonna go and tell him his whole life story.
“Tell you what,” God cuts in. “You were right. About me interfering in the Empty, screwing around in here too much even though we agreed that this would be your realm, taking things from you, misusing your kindness. The whole nine yards. And I’m sorry.”
It’s home.
“This is good to know,” Castiel says without missing a beat. He turns serious. “But please, do not allow my presence to interfere with your daily life. It will be, ah, as if I am not even here.”
“No one’s coming back here when they kick it. It’ll be quiet forever,” God smiles. He watches the Shadow glance up at him. “That’s what you want, right?”
Now all three of them are looking at him with equal parts concern and unease. Sweeping his gaze over the three unkempt, haggard faces sitting beside him, it finally hits him, full force like the universe has restarted again without his input.
In which they go to retrieve Castiel’s ship.
“You loved him,” Adam says softly as he once again reads Dean’s mind with scary accuracy. Is that Michael’s doing? He ought to tell them to stay out of there, for their own good.
“You threw your own brother into the Cage and forgot about him,” continues Michael with ice in his voice. “You returned multiple times but still it did not cross your mind to help him.”
Around him, the trees rustle as if in agreement. He looks down at his own hands, these weary old opposable thumbs that have helped shape galaxies and quarks, supernovas and newborn stars and plants and animals and
His heart was in his mouth. Something inside him was broken - it felt as though a red-hot brand had been taken to his chest. He swallowed another mouthful of thick, syrupy blood with a grimace.
He feels the cool touch of two fingers to his head and then he’s suddenly much more sober than he’d like to be. “Why’re you here?”
“J-” Dean fought another hack from erupting out of his throat. Blood pooled in his mouth again but he forced it back down, ignoring the unpleasant taste. “Just peachy. What d-does it look like?”
“Kind of like bees,” Castiel echoes with mild amusement, “but we are far from a hive mind. Though I must admit that we are much more likely to be attuned to similar ideas and concepts than you humans are,” he adds dryly.
he’s gone.”
He looks back at the alien to see the smallest of smiles gracing his face and thanks his lucky fucking stars. “Wanna head back, or you got anything else to do here?”
Dean doesn’t blame him. If he found himself on the street in the state he’s currently in, he’d be jumpy, too. He hasn’t shaved or showered in days -- there’s a scruffy five o’ clock shadow cast on his face, and he’s pretty sure his face just constantly reads ‘if you touch me I will fucking eviscerate you” nowadays.
Cas sucks hard and fast, head bobbing wildly, his tongue lapping at the slit to get at the salty beads of precum that have pooled at the tip of Dean’s cock. He lines butterfly kisses at the underside and his teeth just barely scrape against Dean’s skin, making it impossibly hotter still. Dean’s so blissed out from the blowjob that he forgets to be surprised at the intrusion of a warm, lube-slicked finger probing at his entrance.
“You, on the other hand.” His gaze steels. “You gave me
But there’s no joy to it now.
Just like that, thinking about how deeply they know each other, he’s stiffened beneath the covers. Castiel swallows, adam’s apple bobbing, and Dean dips his head to mouth at the jut of it. “So how would that work?” he asks, letting his breath ghost across the skin.
cool. From the description it kind of reminds him of the spaceship from that time travel show Charlie likes so much. He’s more of a
“Uh, Cas?” Dean asks nervously, but the angel shushes him by scratching a thin line down the length of his neck. It makes his breath hitch again and come out in puffs, and he nearly moans again when Cas puts the very tip of the blade in his mouth and
saved you?”
Dean laughs. “No, you go first,” he says.
But Cas caves. “I - I suppose you’re right.” Dean watches the hesitancy on the alien’s face morph into something else. “If...if it isn’t too much of an imposition, I may have to take up your offer… for a time.” Castiel now has that wondrous, slightly sheepish expression on his face cranked up to full intensity. Dean shrinks back, embarrassed.
Sometimes he forgets about those little things that went into his creations. Maybe he deserves a pat on the back sometimes. Maybe he wasn’t entirely washed up and burned out like he’d thought.
A cool hand covers his eyes; everything darkens suddenly and Dean starts, but Cas shushes him gently. Dean feels his hot breath at his ear. “Do you trust me?”
Dean kisses him. “Wherever we go, sweetheart, we’ll go together.”
The understatement of the century. Okay, Chuck will play along. “Haven’t got any secret tricks up your sleeve this time? No macguffins you think you might be able to take me with?” he demands. “The kid. Where is he?”
Cas quirks an eyebrow at him, but he complies, thank god, pushing in slowly, inch by burning inch until he’s bottomed out and balls deep. Dean loves this feeling, of fullness and security and the heat. He’s never been so satisfied before, and he realizes, with a twinge of sadness, that if this is the one and only time they meet like this, he may never be again.
Then, when he’s lowered his guard just enough, Dean turns his head so that he can capture Castiel’s mouth with his, flipping them over in a sudden flurry of movement so that he’s on top of them, the length of his body boxing Castiel’s in on all sides, skin against skin.
Sam’s phone rings. It echoes in the stupefied quiet of the church, resonating off the walls, a shrill, three-note wake-up call. Slowly, the younger Winchester seems to come to life again, as if he’s returning to flesh from stone. Sending Jack and Dean a sideways glance, he pulls it out of his pocket with no small amount of hesitation, his lips moving wordlessly as he reads the name flashing across the screen.
“Listen, Dean,” Adam says, “I might still be a bit steamed about you leaving me and Michael in the Cage,” ignoring Dean’s subtle flinch, the way he raises an eyebrow at the
Dean can’t see his face from this angle, but he notices Cas tense, sees his body go rigid for a moment.
” Dean grits his teeth. “I’m so sorry. I don’t know if there’s any way I can make it up to you, the way we neglected you — “
“My point is,” Sam interrupts, glancing uneasily at him, “We can’t be pawns on your game board any longer. We shouldn’t be.” He shifts on the pew, which is hard and uncomfortable. “After all this time, decades and decades of …
“Kid.” Chuck won’t call him by name. “What now? You got any closing remarks for me?”
He is just a child.
Maybe he’s just a bit shaken up by the whole situation, Dean thinks, and echoes this sentiment to Castiel. But the alien shakes his head.
“Dean.” Castiel says, soft and firm as he raises his hand to caress Dean’s cheek. The smile on his face is heartbreaking, the same one that had blossomed across his face as he was swallowed up by the inky black sludge of the Shadow, drawing him away from Dean for what had seemed like the last time. “I knew already. I’ve always known. You’ve never had to say it.”
But they weren’t in the Midwest anymore, in a seedy hotel with his dad and kid brother and a whole bunch of first aid equipment and shady parental advice. No, somehow Dean had managed to get himself washed up on the shore of an uninhabited island with no food, no supplies, and another man just as banged up as he was, if not worse. His luck was truly spectacular.
“Did it turn you on? Are you aroused, Dean Winchester?” Cas murmurs roughly, flicking his eyes up to meet Dean’s own. They’re so pretty, Dean thinks. And bright.
His mind, then, wanders to the house. It’s way too big for just two people, especially since one half of that pair is currently dorming at a prestigious law school in south California for the foreseeable future, but Sam disagreed. Said it was “spacious, and perfect for you and Lisa and Ben to live in when I go off to college, Dean.”
He doesn’t miss the way Dean’s eyes sparkle. “So what you’re telling me,” he says as his lips trail around to the side of Castiel’s neck, and he swears he can feel them curve into a smile, “is that I get to be inside you for our little field trip? The whole time?”
He should be encouraging this. This is supposed to happen; this is how it's supposed to end. They’re supposed to be sacrificing themselves, down one by one like bottles in a line, set out for target practice. Someone
“Yes.” Castiel steps into the room, closing the distance between them with two quick strides. Dean’s breath hitches. “You’ve been avoiding me,” he says earnestly. And Dean’s gonna have a word with Sam because the puppy eyes he’s getting right now could make a steel beam melt and damn if his brother hasn’t been teaching their angel a few things.
“Don’t go,” Dean almost
He lets the guy go first before following him into the house, allowing himself to look back for only a second before the door closes behind them.
“If Michael had been less merciful…” Adam trails off. “If I hadn’t had him keeping me safe
“Possessions? Oh, you mean the tools.” Dean scratches the back of his head, sheepish. “Yeah, no problem, man.”
“Go to sleep,” Chuck says. “Just supercharged-me and the Empty, alone together, forever. Unless you wanted to come with.” All he needs to see is the slight twitch of her nose before he knows her answer, loud and clear. He smiles bitterly.
“Anyone can understand me when my translator is intact,” the man-thing says, but there’s no scorn or mockery in his tone. “You must have many questions for me.”
And what would Sam say to all of this? How would Sam even react to the fact that there’s a real living, breathing alien in his house? Dean is tempted to call him up, right now, and tell him, just to see what would happen.
What he finds surprises him. Cas is standing there like an attack dog, back facing Dean, with his angel blade out and ready at the throat of the Other Castiel, pinning him against the wall. Cas is snarling something Dean can’t quite hear into his ear, so he inches a bit closer until he can, gun still pointed at the two in case everything goes to shit, which happens a fucking
The room erupts into chaos again. With all the lively chatter, it’s hard to believe that the number of individuals in the room are only a small fraction of the original hundreds that had been.
He watches the glow of his lighter dance along the brick walls as he clicks it to life, swaying from toe to toe like a tower in a rainstorm. Thinks about that last bit of smoldering fabric floating away to the breeze, wondering if it’ll burn away the aching hole in his core. Night chill hits the little slices where his skin is exposed, but Dean pays it no mind. If the cold manages to kill him, get him pneumonia or frostbite or something, then it’s for the best.
“Now, Cas. The moment we’ve all been waiting for.” At Castiel’s confused expression, he beams widely. “Let me introduce you to my baby.”
He manages a shaky nod and a grin. “Y-yeah, Cas. Yeah. Do your thing.”
In which Dean learns more about the mysterious stranger in his front yard.
He’s pretty sure now is the time that he should call someone, maybe Sam, or even the cops. But the man -- alien?? behind him doesn’t seem dangerous, more confused if anything, and Dean can hold his own if he needs to, though he suspects he won’t. He doesn’t need Sam or Charlie or anyone to live his own life, damn it.
Several minutes later, Sam dips beneath the low hanging arch as he enters through the doorway, followed closely by an apprehensive Jack toddling behind him like an imprinted duckling. Truth be told, sometimes he forgets that the kid is his grandson. It’s all too easy to treat him like a plot point, what with his innocent dopiness and the unprecedented amount of power the union of human and archangel has buffed him with.
did I stutter?” The sound of a bottle being uncapped breaks the low hum of the room, and Dean stifles a gasp as Cas takes his entire length into his mouth
Castiel sighed, and Dean could hear the palpable relief in his voice. “Well, that’s good.” Suddenly, he gripped Dean’s ankle firmly, not cruelly tight but still hard enough for Dean’s vision to white out for a good ten seconds. With a yelp, Dean went slack.
He puts his face in his hands, but no tears come out this time. He’s done. Dry, empty, and done.
Castiel is by no means a morning person. He never has been, never on Earth nor Purgatory nor here. Even in the artificial daylight of Heaven’s walls he finds these early hours irritating. The sun is harsh, the chitter of birdsong too grating to his ears. The world has no business being
“I need to go back and assess the damage. Hopefully the mass redistributor has not received the brunt of the impact.” Blue eyes turn to face him severely, a hint of grief swimming there.
Dean sighs. “Okay, come with me.”
For just a moment, the impassive expression on Castiel’s face slipped. “No, it’s not.”
with that angel blade.
“Oh, nowhere close by,” the alien says noncommittally. “At least, I do not think so.” His face screws up for a minute, almost as if he’s in pain, and Dean starts in concern.
Pacing around their bedroom door, the dog barks and barks and barks, but is ignored for at least another hour or two until the two of them emerge to start the day, their voices merry in the crisp morning air.
” She grabs fistfuls of her hair, contorting her limbs like she's in her death throes. “That little half-breed of yours popped in here and woke
“God, Cas, you don’t know,” Dean stammers desperately, but Cas silences him with a glare. The bastard is so dominant when he wants to be.
“I’m here now,” Castiel repeats, and Dean can feel his soft smile against the side of his head. “And I don’t intend to leave your side again.”
“Are you changing your mind?” Sam asks gently, hopefully. His arm is curled around Jack’s shoulders in a tense, protective embrace, something that Chuck had somehow failed to notice earlier, but now it’s the only thing he can see.
Castiel shakes his head, looking forlorn for all of a second before the soft joy returns to his expression, full and open. “I’m afraid I’m as human as they come.”
