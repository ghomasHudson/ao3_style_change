“They were a purple limited edition,” Sherlock explains as if that were the best justification in the world.  He’s serious, too.
“Nearly £175.”
Sherlock hummed in assent, and John insinuated his hand between them so he could gently trace the tight, stretched rim of Sherlock’s hole.  “That’s,” he said, trying to find the right words, “that’s fucking perfect.  I’m in you.  Just the way it looks...it makes
His public entries were mostly links to interesting medical journal articles or quick, meaningless posts to prove to Harry that he was coping.  At first he wasn’t even sure he wanted to keep the blog, although he did enjoy writing.  It wasn’t like the whole world was reading it anyway.  There was Mike, who’d always been a bit of a computer geek, and who’d found it right away after John told him that he didn’t use Facebook.  Unfortunately, he made the mistake of mentioning it to Mrs. Hudson, who promptly subscribed, told Molly about it, and invited her friend Mrs. Turner as well.  Sarah subscribed and always commented with animated smiley faces.  He wondered if Ella still checked it, he was sure, even though he had called her to say he was discontinuing therapy.
John took a moment to collect himself, his own cock hard and straining against his belly and leaving little smears of pre-ejaculate everywhere, before dismounting and settling at the foot of the bed.
“That’s pretty standard stuff,” he said.
John apologized again later, first with words, then with lips and tongue.
John shut the fridge and slipped into his jacket, leftover takeaway forgotten.  They raced down the steps together, into the busy streets of London and the rest of their lives.
“A...cottage?”  If anything, John thought perhaps Sherlock had been offering to share digs again.
“Well, there goes that appointment,” said the manager.  “And she was here for the the full monty.  Damn.”
His shoulder gave him the occasional pang if he were up on his hands and knees for too long, but John found that flat on the bed like this, Sherlock’s strong body above him, was more comfortable than he had suspected it would be.  John didn’t like being fenced in; he never had, even before a soldier’s training made him wary of tight spaces.  Somehow, however, he occasionally craved Sherlock’s weight on him, and there was something very sexy about the way his lover wrapped his arms under John’s own, holding him tight, or grabbing his hands, twining their fingers together as he thrust into him from behind.  Sometimes Sherlock took his time this way, moving slowly, undulating himself against John’s spine and backside before turning them both to their sides and reaching around to John’s front so they could finish nearly together.  Tonight, though, that slow lovemaking was apparently not on Sherlock’s agenda.
“Those cardigans will have to go.”
in the notebook before closing it.  “She joined the police,” he said. “She’s an excellent officer.”
“You’re usually so
He ignored what Sherlock was saying in lieu of trying to find some food in their still mostly-empty refrigerator when he heard Sherlock shout an exuberant “YES!” from the next room.
.  That’s not to say that they didn’t see anyone, someone
John passed the post office on his way to Marjorie's bakery, which reminded himself to contact Owens.  John had met the postman on several occasions and had never found him particularly sociable.  He was an unassuming and somewhat skittish man in his late fifties.  Owens had never married, and lived just outside of town.  John had to pass his rustic cottage every time he came to and from town, so he figured he’d just leave a note in Owens’ letterbox when he returned to Holmes Hall.
“Except a massage.”
“Um,” said John, swallowing again.  “OK.  That’s...”  The blood that had flushed his face was now travelling south at an alarming rate.  “I, uh.  Well.”  He seemed to have lost all capacity for rational speech.  Jesus.
He has the lube.  He reaches down between his legs, tugs my cock from where it’s nestled between his cheeks.  He makes me wet, then gently rubs the head of my penis over his hole.  I shudder.  “There you go, love.  Mmmm, go slow.”
They looked like they were having a whale of a time, actually, thought John.
“It’s funny,” said Sherlock.  “I love puzzles. Locked rooms.  Mysteries, crimes, whodunnits.  Nothing stimulates my mind more.  But this.  This isn’t fun.”
John wasn’t paying attention. “You were
“You wouldn’t dare,” John says, sitting up.  Sherlock likes the way John looks in the morning, waking up in his bed.  He leans in for a kiss, which Sherlock readily accepts.  As it turns out, John’s lips are perfect for kissing.
“Molly.  Molly and I.  We’ve been cleaning it up and…”
“Yes,” said John.  “Yes.”
“Halth ob thith ith chcolate thyrub,” Sherlock said after licking his finger, rubbing it on the wall, and sticking it back in his mouth.  No one batted an eye.
“Ha! No.  You don’t prune ivy.  You hack at it if it gets overgrown.  Bloody stuff clings like a limpet.”
The rest of April seemed to fly by.  John worked two extra days at the clinic one week while Sarah was laid up with a sprained wrist.  He still hadn’t asked her out, wondering whether or not it was a good idea to mix business with pleasure.  She was enjoyable company and they frequently ate lunch together.  John thought he recognized a spark of interest there.  His libido hadn’t returned, though, a fact he still lamented.  He missed orgasms.  He couldn’t imagine trying to explain that to Ella.
“But there is no happy ending here.”  Sherlock continued to inspect the shelves, his long fingers trailing over the spines, eyes flickering back and forth.  “Ooh!” he said at last, “British authors.  Bronte, Hardy, Forster.  Austen!  Now here’s a possibility:
you to make me feel.  No one else.”
“It’s furnished,” he explains.
Sherlock rolled his eyes back into his head and flopped back down.  Then he
John’s nearly out of  the door when he hears his friend speak: “Don’t worry.  I’m fine.”
The sound came again; this time the hairs on John’s arm stood at attention.  Jesus.  It sounded like someone was dying.  And God knows he knew what that sounded like.
We fall into bed, facing each other.  John is asleep almost instantly, mouth parted against the pillow.  Sometimes John’s breath smells a certain way.  It’s hard to describe, really.  I can’t seem to come up with appropriate metaphors or even specific adjectives to categorise it.  But sometimes it smells sort of sweetish, and I get hard in a manner of seconds.  Then again, sometimes his breath smells horrible (prawn cocktail crisps) and I get hard just as quickly.  He hasn’t eaten anything in ages, or brushed his teeth, but his breath comforts me and I close my eyes and fall asleep smiling.
John had already taken a crowbar to the door that housed my libido, and the rusted hinges have fallen off.  Right now, it’s raging.  My heart aches, I feel high as a kite, and my prick is positively throbbing.
“Look!” he called, holding it up.  “Dinner!”
“Hmm?”  he murmured, listening to the night sounds of London and Sherlock’s breathing.  It felt strange, being in Sherlock’s room instead of his own, but the bed was comfortable and it felt so good to be home.
“At university.”
John gave him a look.  “I know, and of course I liked it.  Obviously.  Shit, I bet Mrs. Hudson heard me.  But I wasn’t sure I would.  Then.  Maybe you wouldn’t like it.  Or that I’d fuck up a blow job or that you’d not find me attractive or that I’d say too many romantic things or make stupid noises or that this was some elaborate experiment you’d set up or that you’d be really into kinky sex…”
the human entire.  The brains in vats thing is bollocks.”
He told the Harry in his head to stuff it, but knew she would be right.  He’d never been a coward.  Intimacy was difficult for him.  He found it difficult, talking about his feelings.  But he was too old to hide, and time was of an essence.  He couldn’t stay at Holmes Hall indefinitely, and as for Sherlock…?  He’d be off to wherever life would take him, and John would be stuck in a beige flat in Leeds...alone.
“I don’t know,” said John, and was going to throw the boot towards the shore when Sherlock suddenly dropped his fishing rod and took off his own clothes.
“Mycroft didn’t let on, but it might be an opportunity to acquire some useful background.”  Sherlock took another sip of wine and stared out of the windows for a while.
“You just did.”  She smiles softly, takes a sip of wine.  “You’re not half bad.”  She raises her eyebrow, flirting.
“Um, thanks?”  The air feels a bit charged.  John is distinctly aware that he’s got  Sherlock’s giant instrument between his legs and that they’re discussing lips.  It seems sexual in a way, almost flirtatious.  John wouldn’t call it obsession, but he’d be lying to himself if he didn’t recognise that their friendship solidified very quickly and that he’s never been so content.  Sherlock is certainly infuriating, but he makes John feel alive, and he’s already made the short list of the people John loves and holds dear.  Sometimes John wonders if there’s something more there, more than simple friendship.  Everyone assumes they’re more than work partners.  He doesn’t know why he gets so defensive about it, but then again he remembers the experimentation he did with Daniel, the boy three doors down, when he was twelve, and how his father nearly disowned Harry for her choice of partner.  And then there was Sholto.  What was between them if not love?
“For now,” Rosie concedes.  “But in a couple of years…”  She wants to study abroad, and as much as John hates the fact she may end up halfway across the world, he knows she’s inherited his wanderlust.  They’ve discussed it, but no decisions have been made.  She doesn’t press.  “I’m just saying that I’m not going to be here forever.”
“No.  These boots would be all wrong for gardening.  A gardener wouldn’t wear them.  John, think.  Why would anyone fill boots with rocks and throw them in a pond?  Why not just bin them if they were unwanted?”
“Oh no you don’t,” he said to his already drooping penis.  Sliding his fingers out of himself, John focussed on teasing his rim while his left hand brought his dick back to life, and while Fantasy Sherlock didn’t reappear, he managed to work himself to orgasm.  At just the right moment, he pushed his fingers back in as far as he could and pressed up.
Sherlock looked wary.  “Why?”
.  I’m not disappointed, you twat.  Not in the least.”
Smiling to himself, John put the rest of the toast on his plate and handed it to his patient, who wolfed it down.
Sherlock shivered as John traced them with his free hand.  “No.  Sympathetic nervous system discharge.  Lovely.”
Mycroft nodded.  “My brother’s brain is his sword and shield.  When in battle, everything else defers.  Becomes negligible.  Collateral damage.”
“That’s how she did it, then.  Inserted the needles without anyone knowing.  Got the client very relaxed, massaged them with some kind of numbing emollient, and then inserted the needles.  The client, face down and blissed out, would never know.  The drugs do their magic as she finishes the treatment.  Addiction is a side effect, one that conveniently keeps patients returning.  In Brian Holleran’s case, one too many times.  He died of serotonin syndrome, basically an overdose of neurotrasmitters.”
“Oh come off it,” Sherlock said, following, “I was perfectly safe…”
“You know her?” asked John, going to Sherlock’s side.
...John’s eyes fly open, blinking away water, as he bends his knees, aims, and paints the tiles with his come in
Sometimes, John imagines what Sherlock would have looked like strung out, lost in a drug-induced oblivion.  It isn’t pretty.  John’s seen addicts, watched drugs destroy a body: sacrilege.  If Sherlock’s brain was his god, John, as his one and only friend, refused to let him destroy the temple.
“What evidence would he have left behind?”
“Well what?”
“No.”
“He was a traffic warden in Leeds.”
“I hate my job.”
“Well, it’s a bit complicated,” he said.  It came out easier than he expected.  For all the times he’d denied it, insisted on two rooms, rolled his eyes at the assumptions, the truth was horribly easy.  Fancy that.  “We’d really just like to keep a low profile, if you get my meaning.  You know, keep the mystery going.”
John checked his appearance in the mirror after combing his hair.  His own lips were still red and puffy and he was pretty sure Sherlock had bitten him on the neck a bit too hard in places.  “Like a bloody teenager,” he muttered to himself, but as he hung his towel on the rack and reached for a fluffy white towelling robe, he found it impossible to keep a soppy smile off his face.
“And what?”  Sherlock took John’s hand and rubbed the back of it with his thumb.  It felt lovely.
“It was still standing when he was found, yes?”
“Wait!” called Sherlock.  “Is there the other one there?”
John waited for a sense of shame or guilt to wash over him, but it didn’t.  He felt a certain connection with that small plot of land, not as if it were actually his, but that he belonged there just as much as its previous tenders did.  He stood as well, lifted his head so he could meet Sherlock’s eyes and squared his shoulders.
“You disagreed.  With...”  John nodded to the magazine in Sherlock’s lap.
For there, standing much like a guilty child, was all six feet of Sherlock Holmes, in nothing but black pants and randomly-placed strips of sheeting that were somehow attached to his body with something sticky.
There is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well,
“Don’t you dare.  Now, you do it.”
“Really?  Wow.”
Jesus.  Was Sherlock just mining for data?  John didn’t think so.  “I haven’t given it much thought,” he answered honestly.  “Not really
“Of my mother?”  Rosie takes a deep breath, blows it out.  “A bit mad, wasn’t she?”
And it is vibrato, he wants to say.  The only times his hands shake is when the hypoglycemic shakes set in after too many days of being strung out.  He’d be lying, however, if he said he wasn’t afraid of her.  Intrigued, yes, in the same way one finds moray eels intriguing.  Her mind is a terrifying machine, intricate and faceted and far beyond sanity.  He’s repulsed and fascinated equally.
Mycroft had texted John several hours later to let him know that Sherlock was fine, had ended up at Bart’s, and was likely doing something untoward to a liver or pancreas.
or something.”
Breathing deeply, trying to tamp down a building orgasm, John pushed, felt resistance, looked for reassurance, found it, and kept going.  It was so tight - John was afraid of hurting Sherlock, and watched him carefully for signs of pain - but the oil helped and then John was
John’s latest blog entries were set to private.  He wrote about the garden, about the things he’d learned about plants and flowers.  Sometimes he wrote about loneliness, formless poems that were for his eyes only.  He wrote about the people who were now in his life, and sometimes he wrote about the people who were no longer in his life.
“You do realise that any of those things you were taking kill brain cells, right? Bit counterintuitive.”
“How delightful,” said John, tracing the flower under the glass.  “The colours still look fresh.  Does your mother enjoy gardening, too?”
“Depends.  These here are fairly new plants.  Not like the stuff on the front of the house.  Need napalm to get that off.  Been there for decades.”
“What I’ve observed about relationships,” Sherlock continued, “is that most of them change.  I suppose we’ve gone about things rather backward.  There are important things we ought to discuss.  But not now.  I find myself feeling rather satisfied with life at the moment, and I just want to exist.  Here, with you.  Ruminating about the future is pointless, John, and only breeds worry.  The point is, we’re here now.  You know I do not believe in fate or soulmates or any other such nonsense.  I’ve
“And tobacco ash,” added proudly.  “My favourite.”
“Oh, that’s not going to…”
“My father was an unkind man.  He’s...he’s not right.  He never touched me, never me.  But Maggie and Suzanne.  I didn’t know, I didn’t even suspect,” she continued, “and my mother refused to notice.  Maybe she couldn’t deal with it.  Sherlock told me.”
“All of these people, going about their daily lives.  And they see everything but observe nothing.  Nothing!  Why do they even have eyes?  Ugh!”
The old walls of Holmes Hall had seen some interesting things in their time -- political plots, family drama, the private joys and griefs of servants, a scandal or two.  They had never, however, seen two grown, wet, naked, and
“I’m trying to determine the method of hair removal, John.  A recent waxing would leave traces on his skin, so it’s not that, maybe some kind of chemical depilatory... ” -- he paused to sniff dramatically – “Skin smells very faintly of lemon.”
“Don’t look at me like that.  Of course.  Just because he’s…” --Lestrade flapped a hand as he searched for the right word-- “...idiosyncratic... doesn’t mean he doesn’t feel things like the rest of us.”
“I don’t know.  I’m not saying I’m not creative in bed, because I am,” he said pointedly.  He was a good lover, and he knew it.  “Creativity is fine.  Creativity is good.  I just don’t like surprises.”
“I’ll be right with you, Mrs. Jenkins.”
“That?  No.  That’s because he’s an idiot.  All those brains and no common sense.   He’s smart as a whip.  A graduate chemist, you know.  And he solves puzzles.  Not the kind with a million pieces, mind you.  Real puzzles, mysteries.  Never could figure out his father’s death, though.”
Now that his libido had decided it was no longer dormant, John decided it was high time he started dating again.  He wasn’t exactly sure where to start.  Internet dating?  Not really his thing.  He felt too old for nightclubs.  There was always old reliable, the pub, and so when Mike invited him out for a trivia night, John agreed, hinting that maybe Mike could bring a single friend along.
“I had a banana at 10 ish.”
John blinked, looked at Molly, who was still blushing furiously, and shrugged his shoulders.  “Sorry,” he muttered.  “He’s a right prat.”
“A fair share.”
“Well,” she said, “it’s not as if you’ve talked of anything else since you moved to Yorkshire.”  John could hear the smile in her voice.
The smile faded from Sherlock’s face, all traces of levity gone.  “We were close once,” he started, but then must have decided that was all he had to say about the subject.  John got the feeling the conversation had come to a close, but he wasn’t really ready to leave.  He enjoyed spending time with Sherlock, even if it was just sitting in front of a fire.  Sherlock was magnetic and enigmatic and interesting.  John liked him immensely, even if he was self-absorbed and brusque.
“How could I?”  John felt an itch of irritation bloom somewhere in his chest.  “You never tell me anything.”
, the sign he had been looking for?  Hardly romantic, or dramatic.  It would be just like Sherlock to save a declaration of love for just the wrong moment, like the next time they were kidnapped or facing certain death.  Just how did one cross the threshold from friends to lovers?  Would it happen organically, during a cuddle on the couch, perhaps, or should he plan the event, think of the exact words to say?  He didn’t know.  Yet.  Not tonight, at least.  John had …bigger… things to think about.
“Look, I’m not going anywhere.  I just would really like to have sex once and a while.  Skin-to-skin contact.  Without you mucking it all up.  Never mind.  Forget I asked.”  John stood and cracked his back.  “I’m going to bed.”  He’d nearly reached the stairs when he heard Sherlock say something.
.  Don’t stop.”
“I’m not sure you want to know.”
me.  Let Mycroft scoff at that.  He is alone by choice, and I am no longer willing to live as he does.  He has not loved and lost, as both John and I have.  He does not know the strong bonds of friendship, of affection, outside of the ‘duty’ he feels toward me.  And if he does, or has, he has not shared that information with me.  I pity him, sometimes.  Insufferable wanker he may be, but he is still my brother and, I suppose, he deserves someone interesting to render him a bit more human.  No one looks at him the way John looks at me.  No one snores against cab windows when he returns home.
Drowning might not be the right word for it.  He had plenty of oxygen, and his lungs were working just fine - heaving breaths in, expelling waste gases out.  Drowning, thought John, also might have negative implications.  Surrendering, then.  It felt like that, being completely submerged in something so intense he didn’t bother to fight it, didn’t even want to fight it.  So he embraced it, then.  Let himself be a vessel for overwhelming love and intense pleasure.
“It’s just hair.”
“I like your arse.”
“None of that was my doing.  I’m not going to keep tabs on him for you.  I understand he’s not the most congenial person on the planet, but if you’re that worried about your brother’s well being, how about you, I don’t know,
John had nothing else to say, so he kept his mouth shut as Mycroft let himself out.  He no longer felt like reading, so instead he changed into his old jeans and a lightweight jumper, thinking he would finish weeding the flowerbed he and Lestrade had worked on the other day.  He was nearly out the door when he remembered the key to the locked garden.  He retrieved it from his nightstand and tucked in the front pocket of his jeans.  Mycroft wasn’t the only one who could keep secrets.
, John.” He wrinkled his nose at this.
They left their mismatched teacups in the sink and made it to the pool, unbuttoning shirts as they went.
Starting at one corner and working his way around seemed like the best idea, so he chose a sunny spot close to garden door, spread out the tarp, tried to find a position that wouldn’t trouble his leg, and started weeding, every once and while consulting the pocket guide to gardening he’d brought with him to make sure he wasn’t digging up anything important.  Simple grass seemed to be the most obnoxious and pervasive interloper, and he had to hack at it with a weeding fork until the clumps loosened and he could pull them out by the roots, a task that was nearly impossible in Lestrade’s borrowed gloves.  They were too big, so eventually John pulled them off and found his bare fingers much more adept at the task.  Three hours of solid labour later, his shoulder aching, the spot he was working on still looked fairly unkempt, but the different plants were finally discernible and a mound of pulled-up weeds lay wilting sadly on the tarpaulin.  He was momentarily bothered as to what he was going to do with them.  Lestrade would surely notice if his compost heap was suddenly filling up, so John decided the far corner would have to do for a makeshift compost pile for now, and he dragged the tarp across the gravel path to dump it.
“Connected,” corrected John, lifting up his head to kiss Sherlock’s perfect mouth some more, running his tongue over that impossible cupid’s bow.  How did a man even
“Dangerous?”  John was actually looking forward to some action - it had been a while since they ran anyone down on foot, been beaten up, or shot at.
She’d opened her mouth and then shut it again.
John had had his share of awkward first kisses, as well as those that just seemed to come together flawlessly.  He’d never kissed a man before, much less a naked one, a wet, naked, gorgeous, brilliant one.  At the moment, however, his brain had discarded every other kiss in favour of this strange and wonderful moment.
John stood, holding the pillow in front of him in and grinning.
“What was it you said?  Just now.  About the article.”
“Your phone.  You’re a soldier recently invalided home.  This model of this particular phone is a year old now.  It’s been used without a protective cover...see these scratches?  You haven’t had it long enough to put them there.  So it’s been kept in a handbag with keys and coins.  That, and the general lack of care the device has had indicate that whoever purchased it didn’t find the device as sentimental as it was supposed to have been, as it was obviously a gift. The engraving on the back,
“If you did have a relationship with this person it would be rather...unconventional.”
The crowd parted to let the ambulance through.  Some officials from the race had joined the scene, too.  They, too, were covered in coloured powder, but were distinguishable from the racers by their caps, radios, and what-once-were-red polo shirts.   “Anaphylaxis,” John told the paramedics as they helped Barbara onto a stretcher and attached a blood pressure cuff.  “Allergy to pistachios.  Although I can’t imagine she’d ingest one while...”
“Sammy?”
“It would take me far too long to go through all of these,” Sherlock was saying.  “I’d say you used a fairly thick volume to press it originally, or even a flower press.  But you keep it somewhere special, don’t you?  Somewhere...sentimental.  After all, we don’t just toss mementoes under beds or into cupboards.  No, we treasure them, protect them.  And in your case, hide them.  Let’s see.  Ooh, look, you’ve organised by genre!  How clever.  Here’s American literature.  Like Mark Twain, do you?  And Hemingway?  And here are some classic Greek dramas.  Rather scandalous, those, if I remember correctly.  No, you wouldn’t have kept it in
“Never mind.  I’m moving your underpants.”
He leaned in and John did his best to hide his distaste.  He had a fairly decent poker face and he employed it now as Leybourne invaded his personal space.   “You wouldn’t, say, be interested in writing a little something about your weekend with us, would you?”
It was nearing evening when the police finally left with Lillian and Robert Leybourne, who created a great deal of fuss and indignation about the whole matter.  Sherlock shut him down in his typical condescending fashion, deducing him publicly in front of his father, who had become a horrified weepy mess, weeping into his G&T about who was going to save Willow Cross, how would he afford the upkeep on the horses, and that all his hopes were lost.  John did his best to pacify the poor man and suffered through another hour’s worth of questioning and paperwork before Sherlock announced to the whole lot that his involvement was no longer necessary.
“You’d probably make more money.”
An odd feeling of disappointment bloomed in John’s gut.  Sherlock flopped back onto the bed and resumed his impersonation of a starfish.
, and why did he have these fluttery stupid
“Hmm?”
“Oh.  Right.  Um, Webster.  Dan Webster, right?”
“Do you think,” she asks, “that you two would have stayed married?”
“Do you know, Sherlock,” he said, smiling, “what you do when you don’t speak someone’s language?”
Under his fingers, John felt Barbara's pulse strengthen, and her gasps had lost their desperate quality.  She attempted to speak.  John had to kneel closer to hear her.  It took him a moment, but there it was: one word.
Above him, Sherlock moaned.  “Touch it,” he whispered.  John tried to ignore the ache in his balls as he mouthed at pebbled nipple, inching his fingers closer to where Sherlock wanted them.  It was an awkward angle and Sherlock was working hard, keeping himself raised on one arm while holding their cocks together between them.  “John,” Sherlock groaned, breath heaving in and out.  “Now.  Touch it.”
Greg gave him an odd look, then nodded at John in a sort of congratulatory way, and headed out.
“I’m contemplating the futility of existence.”
John forgot about the violinist.  The rest of the concert he marvelled at his friend, his bizarre, complex, brilliant friend, completely losing it over...music.  Sherlock was emotionally responsive to music, John knew, but not like this.  He wondered whether his flatmate wept when he played in those dark and haunted hours of the morning, if the music quieted the riot of his brain, calmed the raging beast, or if it were more invigorating, like opening a floodgate that Sherlock had trained himself to keep closed: emotion -- repress at all costs.  Was it the piece?  Was he remembering something from his childhood?  A former lover, perhaps?  Maybe a music tutor?  John hadn’t the foggiest, and he was suddenly sad that he didn’t know, that he wasn’t privy to all of Sherlock’s secrets.
“Hm.  I think it’s time to do a bit of research on Ms. Lillian Gleason.”
John closed his eyes again.  Jesus.  Murray, his friend.  He forced his eyes open.
“I know this is supposed to be relaxing,” said John as James got out a few towels and a bottle of something from the cupboard, “but do you mind if I ask you about some things while you work?  I’m a doctor, and I’m a bit embarrassed to admit that I’ve never had a massage - well, except when I knackered my shoulder.”
John tried to ignore the sad but true implication: Sherlock liked him more than he liked Molly.  More than he liked anyone else, according to Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade.  It filled John with a sense of wonder and pride, but also made him feel uncomfortable.  He might not like people, but many people
He breathed in, out.  In, out.
“What’s the matter with it?”
“Give me five minutes.  We’ll ride.”
Years later, when they would look back at this particular event as one of their...more interesting...sexual experiences, John would maintain that he really didn’t plan for a particular object to see a bit of Holmes-Watson shenanigans.  He certainly didn’t
“Hmm, go on...” I murmur against his skin as I bend down to get closer to him, maybe mouth at his testicles a bit; they’re drawing up, so tight and full, his legs are beginning to shake.
“Yes,” he replied, panting.  He was truly working now, sweat gathering at the nape of his neck.  John could smell him, too, the somewhat metallic tang of clean sweat mingled with chlorine and sex musk.  “I can feel you
“Ask who what?”
“A bit...smoked,” John says, trying to make light of the situation.  They smile at each other as they stand in the sitting room.  Sherlock is overwhelmed by fondness and relief.  “Oh,” John says, reaching into his jacket pocket, “I’ve got something for you.”
_______________________________________
“Mine,” said Sherlock.  John hopped down and poured the water.  “And yours.”
I spin out the fantasy in my mind of what would have happened had we not been interrupted (don’t think about what will happen yet - let it happen naturally, with no preconceived notions):
“Um.”
“Look,” he said, and pointed.  There, on the ivy that climbed the garden walls, was the robin, singing her farewells.
Something in his tone ignited something within John, something dark and unruly, and he gave the ladder a good jolt, shoving it quickly forward and back.
Harry actually laughed.  “Look, Johnny, you’re thinking about it too hard.  Just stop thinking about it.   Isn’t that what granddad always said?”
He’s trying.  Sherlock has assured him a hundred times that talking to one’s daughter is critical to healthy relationships.  John knows he’s right. He never talked to Mary.  Not really talked, not about the things that mattered.  It’s the least he can do.
“Yeah.  Quiz night at Mike’s local.”
, John thought.  Probably the second day he’d arrived, withdrawal be damned.
“Please just read the answer, John.  Aloud, if you would.”
attracted to you.”
“Morning,” John mumbled.  He settled himself back down, adjusting a pillow under his head so he could reach over and play with Sherlock’s hair.  Perhaps this was an overly affectionate gesture, but the side of Sherlock’s mouth quirked up under his fingers at the touch, so John let his hand remain.  His lover’s eyes remained closed, but had stopped moving behind the lids.
“Melissa, see if you can clear up something for them tomorrow,” she said.  “A two-hour couple’s block, if you can get it.”
Even damp, cool, and tasting rather like pool chemicals, John delighted in the feel of Sherlock’s lips under his, their soft plumpness, the dip of his philtrum.  John tipped his head so he could get better access to Sherlock’s tongue, which, in contrast to his lips, was hot and still tasted slightly of spicy wine.
“Yes, we must,” agreed Sherlock.  He looked down.  “Might need to take the rug, too.”
Here in the darkness, it’s another world, a ghost world in which the veils of time can be parted.  In the dark he can see himself pottering around, fixing things, playing fetch with a dog, reading in a deckchair.  Rosie could bring her friends, head to the seaside.  One day, maybe, her husband.  Grandchildren.  Sherlock surely would let him use it whenever he liked.
Again, these are written very quickly.  But it's better than not writing at all, right?  LOL
“Memorising.  This entire weekend.”
By the time Sherlock realised John’s intentions for the evening, it was already too late to back out.  Longing spurred him forward.
“It’s supposed to be symbolic.  This whole ‘honeymoon suite’ business.  A couple enters into a new relationship and then consummates it behind closed doors.”
In the soft lamplight he could see, along with his own spunk and sweat, hundreds of short, blue-grey hairs, and the beginnings of what was going to be a spectacular case of hives, from chest to cock.
_______________________________________
He finally cycled up to Holmes Hall around 5pm, pedaling around the side of the house to put his bike in Lestrade’s garage.  He stopped his bike when he heard it: a violin playing.  Sherlock’s window was open, and coming from it strains of music.  He’d come back.
They were quiet for a while.  The wind blew gently, making leaves on the trees whisper to each other.
“God, I’m dying for one.  Does my brother know you’re here?”
“Sherlock is difficult.  He’s made a career of pushing people away and walling up his heart.  You, of all people I believe, know something about walls.  You wear your heart on your sleeve, but there’s a dark part of you that you keep carefully locked away.”
John awoke too early, finding Sherlock’s erection nestled happily in the space between his thighs and buttocks.  He pressed back, experimentally, and found that this, too, could be fruitful.
“As I was saying,” continued Sherlock, straightening back up and taking a cotton swab and plastic evidence bag from his jacket, “it was the powder.  May I?” he asked Barbara, who was getting ready to be put into the ambulance.  She nodded and Sherlock gently swiped her cheek and chin before putting the swab in the bag.  “Motive.  Revenge.  To start with, I don’t think this was a case of attempted murder, so you can cross off what you just wrote down, Anderson.”
Oh!  And there’s a case.
“Well what?”
“And you were asleep under the hedge the whole time.”
Sherlock sat up and looked across the room to his evidence wall.  “It doesn’t seem likely that he would do so years afterwards, but it’s worth looking into.”
Sherlock used the opportunity to recapture the handwarmer.  “Don’t worry,” he said after John eyed the thing dubiously, “I’ll be gentle.”
Molly stared at him.  “The horses!” she said, finally realizing that John hadn’t a clue what she was talking about.  “This one’s Sam,” she said, going over to the big chestnut that was currently eating hay in the farthest of the four stalls.  “And Josie’s the black one.  She’s outside.  Gets a bit claustrophobic,” she added, as if revealing the horse’s deepest, darkest secret.
John shed his coat and offered his hand, which she shook.  Her hands were warm and soft.  “Martha Hudson, dear.  The housekeeper.”
Sherlock was completely nonplussed.  He swung a chair around, sat in it, crossing his legs, and smirking at his brother a moment before addressing Mr. Leybourne.
Sherlock was quiet and withdrawn when they returned to Holmes Hall.  John was exhausted after getting very little sleep the night before, so he said goodnight to Sherlock, who decided to find out as much as he could about Miles Donovan.
Sherlock scrunched his eyebrows together.  “I think you may have broken my brain,” he said with mock-seriousness.
“Jesus Christ, Greg,” he laughed.
Sherlock leaned forward, resting his forearms on the casement and clasping his hands together.  He shook his head.  “A legacy, yes.  But it’s not
He had, three days ago when they’d first met.  But he’d said nothing about sounding the musical equivalent of a foghorn
“Sex should be had in a proper bed,” continued Sherlock.  “At least for the first time.”
Finding his bravery, John continued.  “I found the key.  And then the door.  And we’ve been…”
John gets his mojo back, and finds something hidden.
That’s it.  John groans, a full-throated thing, and comes.  I love to watch him spurt, to see the ejaculate fly from the tiny slit of his penis and land across his hand, chest, and stomach.  I can’t keep my own groan in any longer, and I try to keep my fingers still as his muscles contract around them.  Overstimulation makes John very uncomfortable, and I want to give him this, a moment where is relaxed and sated.
John took his cock in hand, gave himself a few strokes to oil it up, and then and positioned himself appropriately.  He ran the head of his penis over Sherlock’s perineum a few times, just to enjoy the eroticism of it and momentarily tease his lover, until Sherlock shuddered and pushed back, effectively impaling himself.
that!” he all but yelled.
At 55, Joyce had been in charge of Willow Cross’ linen cupboard so long she probably remembered when the staffroom pot pourri still smelled of lavender instead of dust. Sam, 30 years her junior, told anyone who’d listen that unlike Joyce, she was getting the fook out of Staffordshire as soon as she’d saved the train fare, and found the deposit for a flat, a decent job, a man, and a home for her seven rabbits. In other words, she’d be stripping beds, gossiping about the guests and cackling away with Joyce until the latter went to the great laundry room in the sky. Or at least, until Leybourne found a company mad (or desperate) enough to take on the housekeeping contract.
“How many days has it been?”
.  Common objects seemed more phallic than ever; even the bananas on the counter with their gentle curve seemed to taunt him.  One afternoon it seemed as if every cloud in the sky was shaped like a dick.  When John changed the toilet roll, he found himself looking askance at the metal rod that held the cardboard tube.  He wondered if he were developing a complex.
Sherlock looked down to where his cock was still proudly wearing a fur coat and, in all seriousness, declared, “I’ve never fucked a muff before.”
But as John looks at Sherlock now, sitting relaxed across from him, he realises that while those adrenaline-filled days were filled with the vigour of a budding friendship, they were often tumultuous and sometimes ugly.  He still feels Sherlock’s two-year masquerade as a dead man as one of the great tragedies of his life.  It wasn’t until after Mary’s death and the nightmare of Sherlock’s sister that they’d found themselves back on solid footing.  This, whatever they have now, he supposes, is what they had always been heading toward.
“Your ‘embouchure’ made me see stars, you berk.”  There’s a lazy silence.  “Why haven’t you been playing?”
.  Of course he was.
John made a soft, encouraging sound and tried to ignore a mild itch that was troubling his belly.  Sometimes it took Sherlock a while to get it out.  That was okay.
“No, really.”
John suddenly remembered a newly single Harry, drunk on grief and cheap Chardonnay, as she ruthlessly chucked everything that reminded her of Clara out of their house. In the process she’d lost her degree certificate, her favourite childhood teddy, and a birthday card she’d written to their mum when she was six.  He didn’t want Mrs Hudson to have any regrets.  So he resigned himself to helping, sorting items into Give Away; Trash; Keep; and What-the-Hell-is-This.
“OK.”  Sherlock was certainly okay with touching someone else, thought John, for all the times he’d been physically moved by him -
Then, during the third movement, a tiny sniff.  And another.  Mesmerised by the beautiful young soloist, John barely registered the sound. How on earth was she doing that?  Music seemed to emanate from her whole body, not just the instrument, and Sherlock was missing it all.  John was ready to elbow him in the side.  Daft git.  Dragged him out here, so excited, and then...oh.
It was an intense orgasm to say the least.  Maybe it was the novel position, maybe Sherlock was hitting something inside him that had never been hit before, but John felt like even his very
Sherlock’s grin widened.  “Made in 1987,” he said.  “May I see the stones?”
“It was a very nice chihuahua.”
“Shush now.  Honeymooning couples are always a bit creative.”
Sherlock turned it this way and that, studying it.  “I don’t know, John.  It’s...dead. May I?” he said, closing the little notebook.  John nodded, and Sherlock put it in his trouser pocket.  “Go and get cleaned up,” he suggested, leading John out of the library.  “Let’s eat breakfast.  They’ll be here at noon.”
“What?”
John had always been physically small compared to his friends, and his stature, long before his army training taught him to size up every man the room: who was boasting, who was truly vicious, and whom he could neutralise if necessary.  It was his self-confidence and his ability to hold his own that kept his hands steady in the face of physical danger.  That, and his natural proclivity for reading people, is what rendered Mycroft Holmes’ ability to intimidate and most of Sherlock’s insults harmless.  But like any man, John looked after his testicles.  Oddity of biology, testes: the very place reproductive cells were produced, the most, biologically speaking, important cells in the male body, dangled outside in a thin, defenseless sac.  There was a reason why soldiers removed their helmets and used them to cover their nuts - forget the brain; better death that than flack to the testicles.  Men had rules about their balls: you didn’t hit below the belt in a fight; if you had a great mate that you wanted to pester, you could snap a towel in the general vicinity of his groin and hope you got him good; you could casually rearrange them if the need arose in the presence of other men; you could complain about how cold or hot they were. The size of a bloke’s cock might be impressive, but it was his balls that other men respected.  John’s were of perfectly average size, but any one of his army mates would testify: John Watson may be short, but that fucker’s got
Blink, blink.
Sherlock was lying in his bed, still in his “life is futile” pose.  He was wearing the same clothes as he was the day before.
John gaped at him.  “How on earth did you know that?” he exclaimed.  “She just phoned yesterday!”
“Yes, of course.  What, figure it out by her shoes or something?”
The photo is of Sherlock’s backside.  His rather glorious bare backside, on display.  His legs spread open as he kneels on the bed, testicles hanging loosely between them, his weight on his elbows.  John’s not an expert with the camera on his phone.  He knows little about taking photographs in low light, and this one’s not as clear as it could be.
John bent down to see more closely.
“I can’t wait any longer,” she announced in a shaky voice.
“Is it possible that your father knew about the girls earlier?  That maybe they told him at one of his story sessions, maybe asked for help?  Maybe he tried, or alerted the police and started an investigation or something, angering Sally’s father…”
James ran both of his hands over each of John’s feet a few times, rolling them this way and that, stretching them out and relaxing the muscles before taking John’s right foot in his hands.  He started at the heel, using this thumb to inch his way up along the outside of the foot.  John had expected something slippery and oily - this was more of an odd, dry pressure.  “I’m just feeling the tissue,” said James, “going through each zone, checking for changes in density.”  He got up to the little toe, did something like pinching it a few times, and then started back down in the middle of John’s foot, working his way up again.  John was feeling pretty ambivalent about the whole thing until James hit something under his middle toes.
John stowed his tools under the stone bench and draped the tarp over it to keep out the rain before surveying his handiwork a final time.  He’d done well, he thought.  A clump of larkspur and a patch of foxgloves, still only six inches or so high yet, now had room to grow.  Tomorrow he’d go after the roses with the pruning shears.  It was rather late in the season for it, he knew, but maybe if he cut the dead growth, the stems that had managed to sprout leaves could actually blossom.
Lillian explained the spa’s mission and various health philosophies in the manner of a superior holiday rep as they were steered past numerous bathing areas, each more ornate and inviting than the last.  John inhaled the warm, humid air, watched the ponytail swing, and tried especially hard not to imagine Sherlock’s perfect buttocks stuffed into tight, black Speedos.  He could daydream a bit; no doubt Sherlock was picking up every watery fact and would recall them all later.
“Hmm.  Funny.  It’s when I knew, too.”  He laughed softly.  “God, you in those jeans.”
Sherlock crossed his arms over his chest and surveyed his childhood room.  “Bit of a mess,” he admitted.  He wove his way through the boxes and disappeared from view; John followed round to find Sherlock pushing the heavy, brocade curtains away from the tall windows.  He unlatched one and opened it, leaned on the casement, and took a deep breath of cool night air.  John shivered and sidled up next to him.
Sherlock’s expression faltered; John watched as the predatory gleam in his eyes faded away, almost as if he forced his emotions back so his brain could work at optimum processing level.
“Oh, thank goodness,” Mrs. Jenkins breathed.  She collected her handbag and dashed off without even a polite good-bye.
“I care for my brother as well,” said Mycroft, sounding sincere.  “Although he attracts dangerous people.”
“Hmm.  It was boiling hot that summer, I remember.  Lilly was pregnant with you.  Not very far along, but she was exhausted, I remember.”
“Not going to work, John.”
“I spoke with him.  When he’d come to London. He spoke of you constantly.  I haven’t seen him this interested in anyone since he developed a fixation with the mummified body of Lindow Man.”
That should pass the time nicely.
“You,” said Sherlock.  “Only you.”
“Hmm?” asked Sherlock, who was contemplating where to put his skull.  He tried the bookshelf, then relocated it to the mantle where he rested it on the antique edition of
“It was delicious.  Complex flavour, with just subtle added spice, an exotic aftertaste.”  He pulled back the duvet so John could see what he was doing.  John struggled to keep his eyes open as Sherlock prepared to take him in mouth.  “John,” he rumbled, eyes looking up under dark lashes, “how do you like a hint of
John found himself more relaxed than he’d been in a long time.  Sherlock’s stories were interesting, and in spite of the man’s infuriating quirks of personality, he was exceedingly good company.  More than once John found himself laughing at something or shaking his head in disbelief.  Time seemed to fly by.  Dessert was eventually set in front of him, and he ate it, occasionally pushing the plate toward Sherlock, who actually took a bite or two of the delicate layers of tiramisu.
Sherlock doesn’t move.  That’s not so bad.  It’s not as if his entire unit were half a foot away from John’s crotch, hoping to kiss it.  Or maybe they were.  That was worse.
‘Still’ is a funny word, John thought.  It was a word connected to ‘calm’ for John, related to ‘peace’ and close kin to ‘quiet’.  ‘Still’ was the feeling he had long ago when he was young and still a believer, sitting small and unmoving under the eaves of his parents’ church.  ‘Still’ was the desert in Afghanistan during the summer, when the horizon shimmered with heat and his platoon sat idle, waiting for the next skirmish.  ‘Still’ was a quiet bath after a long, stressful day.  ‘Still’ was the only word that he could think of to describe the feeling he had the moment he closed the door behind him.
foot.
John put his hand on the door before Sherlock had a chance to burst inside.  “Just how bored are you?”  he asked, Watson Damage Control instincts kicking in.
“Oh for God’s sake, John, just shake the ladder.  I’ll catch myself.”
“It’s not plausible,” said Sherlock finally, sitting back in his chair.  “But your father is the only suspect we have so far.  Do you know where he might have been in 1989?  We were 13.”
Whatever Sherlock felt for him in return was more than enough.
Sherlock looked up and saw John, momentarily losing his concentration.  The barman landed a right hook right on Sherlock’s cheekbone; the skin split.  Sherlock touched it, his mouth open in shock.
“What on earth are you doing?”  John asks, balancing between extreme annoyance and complete bewilderment.  He’s too tired to figure it out.
It was at that moment, when John was lying on the table smiling to himself and Sherlock pouting and turning himself around on the stool that the masseuse came in.
.  It’s a place to live, to build and share a life.  Together.
John’s first attempts are hilarious.  Instead of producing the sonorous, mellow notes that Sherlock does, John makes the instrument sound like a Viking blow horn.  He tries “Mary Had a Little Lamb” just by using his lips: it’s not even close.  Whereas Sherlock can vary the volume of his playing, John has one setting: deafening.
When it’s finally over, they are both giddy with post-case adrenaline, Sherlock riding the high of his own genius.  The door clicks shut and then both collapse, jackets still fastened, on the sofa.
Lillian Gleason was a highly trained acupuncturist but didn’t broadcast it; she’d created a specialty package that only she provided and that cost an exorbitant amount of money, but clients were more than willing to pay for the euphoric feeling they had after treatment.
He tried to see beyond the curtain a bit more; Sherlock wasn’t in the salon area there.  The place had three floors, however; he likely was somewhere else, having wormed his way into this strange wonderland of feminine smells and sounds.  John continued trying to busy himself with products - it was only a matter of time before the pretty salesgirl would be back - when he found himself in front of a section entitled “massage”, written in pretty lavender script on expensive stationary set next to a little pile of smooth stones.  Somehow the bottles, dark in color with fancy labels, reminded him of beer bottles.  He wouldn’t mind a nice cold lager right there and then.
“We had a bit of a bet on this,” said John to James as he settled back down.  “Sherlock doesn’t think that a foot massage could possibly have health benefits.  To be honest, James, I’m kind of a sceptic myself.  I’m completely open to complementary medicine, but reflexology seems a bit of a stretch.”
John isn’t deterred.  “What were you two talking about?”
“How do you know her?” he asked.
“Perhaps,” continued Sherlock, slowly, deliberately, “he should try consulting the daisies.”
John stroked Sherlock’s face, temple to chin, before leaning in for another gentle kiss.  “I can handle it.  Let me see you.  Touch you.”
Sherlock’s breathing quickly grew ragged.  “Can I come on it?” he gasped in John’s ear.
“He what?”
“Mmm-hmmm.”
“Sure.”  John smoothed Sherlock’s hair away from his forehead and ran his finger over his eyebrows.  “Why? Did you traumatise her in your youth?”
“His feelings.  Sherlock’s?”
Intrigued, John scrolled down.  The third entry read:
“I helped.”  Sherlock pulled a bottle of Pinot Noir from the wine rack and set about opening it.  He poured them both a glass and they sat down.
“Mmmmmmm?”
to that particular piece of anatomy came floating back to him, and he blushed a bit.
PLEASE for the love of all that's holy DO NOT PUT SPOILERS IN THE COMMENTS!  Thanks guys!!!
They kissed leisurely as Sherlock slowly guided them back to the steps.  When the water was shallow enough for both of them to kneel, Sherlock took both of John’s hands and planted them firmly on his arse.  John, knowing when to take a hint, kneaded the muscles and ran his fingertips over the cleft, causing Sherlock to grow squirmy and more insistent.
Sherlock was quiet for another moment, as if he were pressing some mental ‘save’ button, before inhaling deeply, opening his eyes, and reaching for his tea.  “Just after I masturbated in the shower.”
John was out the door at the first sound of a scuffle.  He watched, amazed, as Sherlock bobbed and ducked.  He fought well.  He had obviously trained in some type of martial arts, and while the barman had significantly more upper body muscle mass than Sherlock did, he had yet to land a debilitating blow.  John aimed to keep it that way.
John turned his attention to the rest of the contents - it was full of elegant gowns, but not the kind a woman might wear for a night at the opera.  It finally dawned on him.
John ran a fingernail over Sherlock’s scapula.  “Feel that?”
John decided to leave the conversation for later.  “What fantasy was that?” he asked.
“You love it.”
“It’s none of his business what I have delivered,” Sherlock countered.
__________________________________________________________________
Molly nodded.  “I’d like to work on it with you,” she said.  “But I’m not here again until Friday.”
?”  Then there was wet heat, suction, a hint of teeth and the bite of fingernails on his hips...
______________________________________________________
“Come here.”  John reached down and bodily hauled Sherlock up on top of him.
“You could have played the bagpipes.”
“No.  Henry even mentioned that Adam would be a good person to speak with; he liked my father quite well, too.  I can ring him tomorrow.”
“Beats me.  Maybe for sports, a swimmer, perhaps, or bodybuilder, but that doesn’t explain the complete removal of his pubic hair – or that of his unfortunate anus.”
Makeshift weapon at the ready, John crept along the wall heading south toward the kitchens and main hallway.  He hadn’t had any reason to explore the upper floor of the house, and he paused at the base of the west wing stairwell.  It was very dark, so he went back to his room to get a torch before continuing. Once at the top of the stairs, John started down the west wing corridor, pausing every once and a while to listen.  Nothing but the wind.  He stopped at the end of the hall, where an old painting of a surly-looking bearded old man stared at him from the beam of his small torch, before turning around to face the length of the velvet blackness.  All seemed quiet.  Methodically, he paused door to door, listening briefly before moving on.  Eventually the west wing met the main hall, and it turned abruptly to the left.  Here the hallway was wider.  His investigation yielded nothing, however; he was stopped by a plastic tarpaulin that covered the entire east wing hallway.  John listened intently.  Nothing.
“No, John.  I need hair.”  He waved his arms around in a flourish.  “I’m going to devote a page of my blog to it.  I need to begin gathering samples immediately.  Human only, of course,” he added, as if that would make John feel any better about the strangeness of the whole thing.
“Just for a minute, love.  You can wash later.  I can barely stand.”
Expecting dinner to be some kind of formal affair with more table settings than he could count, John showered, shaved and put on his best shirt with his green trousers.  It turned out, however, to be a fairly casual event.  Mr. Holmes was apparently running late and wouldn’t be in until the morning.
A soft tap on the door interrupted his thoughts.
Lestrade had been griping about having to maintain the pool since no one used it, so John had taken over the task of checking the chemicals since he seemed to be the only one using it.  He liked the space, too, the high, glass ceiling, the quiet lapping of the water, the beautiful mosaic tiles on the floor.
Rosie shrugs assent.
“Yeah.” John couldn’t deny it.
“I knoooow,” Sherlock drawls dramatically.  He sounds drunk.
“I want to check his criminal record before we go looking for him.  Let’s eat here and then head home.”
“Oil?  Bloody hell.  It’s oil.  What were they doing?  Making a plate of chips up there?”
Sherlock made a noise of distaste.  “It wouldn’t work on her.”
The first thing that John noticed was that the flat smelled wonderful.  Like caramel and honey and tea.  The second thing John noticed was that one of Sherlock’s Egyptian cotton sheets lay in shreds on the floor.
“Have you been tested?”
Sherlock was quiet.  “If I fall, you will catch me,” he said eventually, quietly, almost to himself.
Tears pricked in his eyes.  “Can I have a moment?” he managed.
Sherlock’s eyes went wide and he windmilled about.  John immediately let go of the ladder as Sherlock’s feet pushed it forward and braced himself to catch Sherlock himself as he toppled backward.  The ladder clattered to the ground.  John’s shoulder protested at the strain of catching a heavy body; he bit his lip against the pain and kept Sherlock from knocking both of them over.
It was at that moment, with his mouth hanging open, that Anthea chose to speak.  “Holmes Hall is a grade II listed building with origins back to the 12th century, although both the east and west wings were built in the 1800s.  The property also has two guest houses, although your quarters are in the main hall.  There’s a stable for the horses as well.”  She finally looked up from her mobile.  “Do you ride?”
Keeping his left hand on his cock, John slipped his right down between his legs, shivering as his fingertips flicked over his anus.  Perfect.  He kept at it for a few minutes, pleasure coiling deep in his groin, his pulse rising and breath coming faster.  “Beautiful,” said Fantasy Sherlock, who somehow managed to talk and lick at the same time.  John removed his fingers long enough to drizzle more lubricant over them.  “I love kissing you here,” rumbled Fantasy Sherlock.  “Look how your legs shake.  God, I want you, to be inside you.  But first, my fingers,” he said.  “Just one, just to start, yes, relax, just like that.  You’re so tight, John, such a tight little hole...”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him and entered his room, making his way to the table to switch on a lamp.
O I say now these are the soul!
“What about men?”
“Not much to investigate, dear.  Men run drug cartels; men fall from ladders.  He hit his head on a bit of concrete and died instantly.”
“Thinking, I told you.  I’m finding it very difficult to concentrate on two stimulating things simultaneously.  I’ll learn how.  I’ll have to do a little renovation work.”  He made a hand gesture near his skull to indicate
he said to himself.
“Company that doesn’t answer back?”
Sherlock shook his head and flopped dramatically into his chair, tucking his feet underneath him.  “She’s fine.  It’s harder to track when a person is motivated by greed.  Greed is stealthy.  People who are truly greedy buy their time, make plans.  Cover their tracks.  Love, however, is a more vicious motivator.  Love causes people to overlook the obvious, to make mistakes.  Love affairs are all passion and stupidity.”
Poppy seeds actually are kidney-shaped.  Google it.
are killing me.”  He stared at Sherlock, trying to communicate his meaning with his eyes.
John struggled through his own shower, washing with cold water as quickly as he could.  His cock, while not fully erect any more, hung plumply and in want of attention between his legs.  He avoided it and scrubbed the salt from his body in record time before shaving thoroughly.
“Indeed. He was rather too fond of a music-hall singer named Tommy Timms. They had to get rid of him before the papers found out.”
“Why didn’t you?”
He stayed the better part of an hour, getting a sense of the place and making a mental map of the flower beds.  He also took a few pictures of a few plants he didn’t recognise: tall, spiky things with bell-shaped flowers and a low-growing fragrant groundcover.
“So sentimental,” John laughed.  “No, really.  Bodies age.  Minds can be lost.  Spirits can be broken.”
Sherlock shrugged, then sighed, and turned so he was facing the garden.  “This is yours now.  All these are yours.  To do with as you wish.”
Sherlock smiled, light from the fire catching on his cheekbones.  Night had fallen as they talked over another marvellous dinner, and now they were stuffed on roast lamb with passionfruit jus, potatoes dauphinoise, and lemon and lavender syllabub.  Sherlock complained that he would be digesting for a week as John opened the whisky and they both settled in to two chairs by the fire, which, even though it was gas, still threw off enough heat and light to make the place feel homey and comfortable.  It was almost as if they were back at Baker Street, except that their chairs were moved a bit closer together, Sherlock was wearing only a robe, and John lounged in pyjama bottoms and a vest.  Sherlock had insisted it was John’s turn to tell a childhood anecdote, so John told the saga of his failed attempt to run away from home, a story that occasionally was hauled out at Christmas dinner.
“Are you going to let me in?”
John took another sip of his beer.  “Don’t I know.”
“Tell me to fuck off?”
Later that night, John looked up Sherlock’s website on the internet.  Sherlock really was a consulting detective after all.  He’d written numerous treatises on a wide variety of forensic sciences.  He’d done some extensive research into tobacco ash, apparently.  There was also a significant index of soil analysis and a guide to recognizing over 300 types of women’s perfume.  It was impressive.  Sherlock wrote up each of his “cases”, as he called them, in a side blog.  John read them all, and found himself smiling at his hifalutin diction and pretentious tone.  He’d often dismiss the few people who dared make comments on his posts outright, calling them “common idiots”.  Yet something about the entire website struck John as not really a red flag, but a banner of sorts.  A call, a summons: please, pay attention to me!  He noted the counter on the blog: only 257 hits.  Curious.
Like her private grotto, Lillian’s office was perfectly tailored to her tastes, an eclectic blend of Western modern and Eastern exotic.  John noticed right away the absence of diplomas on the wall; most professionals framed and hung theirs.
John smiled wryly.  Point taken.  “So I took a very scientific approach,” he continued.   “You would understand, of course.”
Sherlock shot him a look and a frown.  “One does not have to be homosexual to be a considerate lover.”
“She’s a very highly-trained acupuncturist,” corrected Sherlock.  “She has a BSc from the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and she’s licensed with the British Acupuncture Council.  She spent five years in China between 2003-2008.  She holds certificates in reflexology as well, but those are significantly shorter courses of study.  Clean criminal record.”
John was equally mesmerised, but in his case, by pure lust.
“Oh my God, Dad,” she says.  Her eyes are, at the moment, smeared with mascara, but she laughs.  “It’s Rosie.”
“Shhh.”  John wrapped his arms tighter around Sherlock’s waist.  “Neither do I.  Rather rubbish at the whole relationship business myself.  But it’s fine.  We’ll figure it out.”
“Not a problem.  Just let him know.”
“It’s hardly a castle.”
Less than a minute later, he heard both his and Sherlock’s phones chime simultaneously- a text from Lestrade.  He’d just sent the autopsy report via e-mail.
Sherlock actually looks hurt, and quickly tries to cover his gaffe.  “Fine, whatever, it was just a suggestion.”
“It’s a very lovely place.  Had a foot massage.  It was...interesting.”
“Oh, why, yes of course, John.”  A smile played at the corners of her mouth.  “Quite good, really.”
“John!  John Watson!”
“Oh, this thing,” said Mrs. Hudson distastefully, holding the hand warmer.  “Never used it.  A gift from an admirer.  There was a matching coat at one point.”
John glanced at his watch.  Damn.  He took one last bite and folded up his paper.  Mycroft busied himself with whatever paperwork he’d brought with him.  Discussion over.
Still shaking but feeling much, much better, John turns off the water.  There, on the fifth tile over and the fourteenth one down, a bit of his own semen defies his attempt at removal.
“Bloody hell,” exclaimed Lestrade once he hung up the phone.  “I guess he’s human after all.”
carrying it for you.”
.  Something suspicious is definitely happening down in the spa; get anything you can on Lillian Gleason.  I found something in her office,”  he continued, holding the phone in the crook of his neck as he took out the tiny test tube.  “Something in a medical vial, unlabelled.  Jesus, Lestrade, I think she’s drugging them.  How did the drugs get into his system?”
“Wow.  You’ve been busy.”
Well, that was surely interesting.  It might not be so bad, after all.  John suddenly had a mental image of Sherlock’s hands tied above his head with one of John’s best work ties, and he added it to his rapidly growing fantasies-that-must-happen.
Burnett Thwaite itself was not necessarily unique among Yorkshire’s rural villages.  Beside the run-of-the-mill small grocery and petrol station, it boasted a small art gallery, a B&B, and an antiques store.  Russell Chapman, one of the town’s oldest residents, owned the antique shop, and John found himself popping in once a week or so to say hello after working in Leeds in the morning.  Chapman was long-sighted and had a mole on the side of his forehead that John thought should probably be biopsied.  He was friendly enough, in a reserved, respectful way, and let John poke around the shop in peace.  When John asked, though, Chapman would launch into a long-winded tale of how he acquired each object and what it was worth.  John liked him.  By the end of his first month in Gargrave, John had met Marjorie Gant, the owner of the tea room and baker of excellent chocolate pastries; Charlie Shuttleworth, the librarian; Adam Owens, the postman; and Jackie Metcalf, who ran the pub.
“One like ours?  No.”
“You called about the room.  My employer is interested in meeting you.”
“Feel better?”
just under the surface.
John smiles at him.  It’s warm, and pleasing, and Sherlock smiles back, keeping his lips together.
Mycroft’s gaze was intense.  “Be the key.”
he thought.
John had his shower.  He had a fast but sordid affair with the conditioner and nearly bit a hole through his lip when he came.
“Yeah, well.”  A range of emotions crossed Sally’s face before settling on indifference.  “No more snakes, Holmes.”
“And you’ve hated every minute, haven’t you.”  There are tears in her eyes now.  “Don’t you deserve to be happy?  I love him, too. Why can’t you just admit it?”
“I’ll be there with him.”
“Well,” said James as he began an inspection of John’s feet, “men’s foot massages are more about relaxation than therapy, although you can certainly have a reflexology massage if you’d like.  Women’s feet have all sorts of issues from their shoes, so I spend a lot of time relaxing muscles and stretching tendons.  The feet carry the weight of the body, and it’s amazing how much pressure they take.”
“And John?”
John appreciated the view as Sherlock left: wet, tight black pants, long, strong legs, and a pale expanse of back dotted with freckles -- and one green strand of pondweed.
Sherlock says nothing.
James’ large hands became Sherlock’s , his feet became an extension of his dick and all the messages got crossed.  “Oh God, that’s
Sherlock looked up.  “What?”
Against his better judgement, John used the shampoo, praying that he wouldn’t go blind or break out in hives.
Maybe it was his own adrenaline rush, but John felt instantly annoyed.  “She obviously had a reaction to something.  It makes sense.”
Unlike my dog, I have never made a habit of judging people by sniffing their genitals.   That would be a bit extreme, even for me.  But Redbeard knew how to distinguish the scent of home, knew the smell of his master.  Sometimes I plant my nose in John’s crotch and just breathe.  He pets my hair and I wish I had a dog’s nose to categorise everything my feeble human one cannot detect.
.  “You’ve already bribed him with nicotine patches, I hear.”
“I’m not here to save you.  Or change you, for that matter.  I made that explicitly clear to your brother the night we met.  You are who you are.”
Sherlock finished his tea and left the cup on the table beside the chair.  “Good night, John,” he said.  And with that, he was gone.
Sherlock nodded, lost in thought as they walked along, approaching the stump of the plum tree.  “My father would have liked this,” said Sherlock as he looked at the spot, his hands in his pockets.  “He would have liked you.”
“...But it was just a stick in the water…”
“You’re an evil person,” said John, who, once again, was on the way to sporting a hard on.  God, how he loved this man.
Mike opened the door to a room marked “Lab 4” and switched on the lights.  It was a small standard classroom, with several workstations, two chemical hoods on each side, and metal stools surrounding a central lab table. It was clean and gleaming, newly remodeled.
, the head of his penis having fully passed that tight ring of muscle, and moments later, he was fully sheathed.  John had never had a panic attack from joy or lust before, but right now, he was close to hyperventilating.
“Thanks Molly.”
“I only have one, John.”
This is for Wearitcounts (Sherlockedup), who also has a fart story, and who promised me that I posted mine, she'd post hers.  Hold her to it, folks.
Maybe it was because he hadn’t been intimate with anyone for so long, or maybe it was because he was kissing an incredibly sexy man, but whatever the reason, John was as close as he’d been to coming in his pants since his teenage years.  They’d stop and get their breath back, noses rubbing against each other, foreheads bumping, a press of lips to an eyebrow or cheekbone, and then go back to it, lips meeting and parting, tongues swiping wetly against each other.  Sherlock seemed to enjoy soft, closed-mouth kisses as much as the intense, sloppier ones; his big hands framed John’s face, brushing his hair off his forehead, cradling the back of his neck.  He was vocal, too, little groans and sighs escaping those perfect lips.
“Does it grow quickly?”
Now, with the case concluded, simply being close to John like this, even with him snoring like a freight train, his head tipped back and mouth comically open, is enough to remind me of what I’d been physically missing.  We’d had one frantic encounter in a hotel in Leatherhead, while we were meant to be perusing CCTV images in an office no bigger than a cupboard, but besides that, we haven’t managed a proper shag.  I’ve grown to really quite like sex.  But my body is exhausted, I tell myself as the cab pulls onto Baker Street.  And a tired John is a grumpy John.  The sex can wait.
“Might have won it, actually,” laughed Lestrade.  “Pretty messed up case, though, eh?” he asked, changing the subject as a waiter approached with a tray of pastries and fruit.  Sherlock grabbed an apple and bit into it as aggressively as he could.  Only Sherlock could make the simplicity of eating an apple into an act of hostility.
“I’ve been offered a job in Leeds,” he said.  “Part time, three days a week, morning shift, the occasional on-call weekend.”
Their ride back to Holmes Hall was considerably slower than the ride into Leeds, and John felt much more comfortable.  Darkness fell, and with it, the temperature.  He leaned forward, against Sherlock’s back, and closed his eyes, enjoying the cool breeze and the solid presence in front of him.  Within an hour they were back home.
“He’s so talented,”  Mrs Hudson said wistfully.  “A natural.”
you of him, something dealing with gardens or nature.  Fairy tales?  Did you tuck it away in Hans Christian Andersen, like Maggie did?”
Neither could Sherlock, who was lost in the dual sensation of the soft fur of the muff and the hot velvet of his lover’s erection against his own.
“No, John.  You arrived.”
John likes just about anything in the bedroom but particularly enjoys slow and languorous fellatio that ends with my index finger teasing his hole.  My favourite is when John takes me from behind, when I can feel his balls slap against mine.
John looked back, raised an eyebrow.  Sherlock glared back at him.
“I think I’d like to sit down,” he said quietly.
He emerged from the bathroom to find Sherlock hunched over his computer.  “Looks like we should call Lestrade,” he said as John dressed.
Sherlock looked disappointed at John’s insistence they shower separately.
Navya agreed. They had worked hard for the past few years to rescue Willow Cross, a local landmark and--more importantly--the biggest employer in their part of rural Staffs, from what appeared to be imminent death.  Lillian had been talented, although no one liked the favouritism, and most of the staff felt greatly underappreciated.  Navya knew Leybourne was far more interested in horses than people: he hardly knew their names, much less anything about his staff’s family circumstances or outside interests.
Sherlock’s breath on his ear -- and the words, oh God -- affected John immediately: the waiting area became instantly too hot.  His face flushed and sweat prickled under his arms.  He swallowed hard as Sherlock leaned back into his own space.
he thought.
“You want to go work on that fountain in the courtyard?  I could use an extra pair of hands.”
Yet he
Sherlock groaned (oh God), but then released the cock in his mouth and drew a shuddering breath.  John struggled to lift his head and look up.  Sherlock’s cheeks were flushed and his face was covered with his own saliva.  He looked completely debauched, eyes dark and lips swollen.  He grinned, wiped his face with his hand, and then hunkered back down, wrapping John’s legs around him as he made a pillow out of John’s lap.
He stroked the fur a few times with the palm of his hand.  It was soft, exceptionally so, its various shades of grey, very light silver to nearly smoky blue, pleasing to the eye.  Chinchilla, then.  He held it to his nose, breathed deeply.  No foul odour -- slightly dusty from being in storage, but kept away from damp.  He held it to his cheek, savoured its softness.  He plunged his hands inside it, held it in front of him like a proper lady.  His hands were too big; it was meant for small, delicate digits, but the silk was so smooth and the inside was so warm and suddenly Sherlock was overcome with a compulsion to see how the rest of his skin would react to the sensation of soft fur gliding across it.
“I don’t,” says John, but the carol was his childhood favourite, and he’s in such good spirits tonight that he couldn’t help leading the chorus.
“I’ve heard roses are finicky.”
Sighing, he went into his room, washed the dust from himself in a hot shower, and fell into bed.  He fell asleep smiling.
It was nearly dark, twilight fading from dusky purple to the lush velvet of night as John followed Sherlock around the property, torches slicing through the shadows, stopping here and there to examine rocks and stones.  There was decorative gravel to the side of the greenhouse, but it wasn’t a match.  Two more locations proved fruitless as well.
men chase each other down the hallway.  Thank goodness Mrs. Hudson had indulged in a herbal soother before she went to sleep, or she would have seen (and later heard) things that are better left to the imagination.
John dragged the other chair over to the fire and sat down.  “Tea taste all right?”
“We’re a completely motley crew, Har.  I mean, the landlady’s a bit of a nutter who’s got a secret stash of pot growing in the greenhouse, the gardener is a burnt-out copper, the manager is a right bitch, the girl who does the horses has better conversations with animals than with people, the owner carries an umbrella and walks around like he has a stick up the arse, and now the security guard-- that’s me, by the way-- can’t even shoot a pheasant if his life depended on it.”
“It would make sense,” said Sherlock.  “If no one answered the door, Owens would have known my father well enough to know where to find him…in his garden.”
John only had one more question for the time being, but it was a critical one:
“Oh, John, please come quickly.  You’ve got to stop him.”  She is generally capable of handling anything Sherlock can dish out without batting an eyelash, but Mrs. Hudson sounds truly distressed.
“Text me if he turns up,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock loved him, but he’d decided when Sherlock had initially asked about John’s feelings back at Willow Cross that it would be fine if Sherlock never wanted to express it aloud.  He figured that if he did choose to, it would be followed by words of caution:
“Yeah,” replied John.  He found it endearing that Sherlock still asked.  Something about sex rendered the man practically polite.  John usually reacted just the opposite: arousal took control, made him more demanding and more likely to direct.  He had occasionally enjoyed a bit of power play in the bedroom with a few of his previous lovers, but he wanted the sexual aspects of his and Sherlock’s relationship to unfold organically, and so far Sherlock just seemed to be getting comfortable with his own reawakened sexuality.
John frowned at him.  Mycroft continued, as if having a detailed file of a potential employee were an everyday occurrence.  “You’re currently undergoing a course of physiotherapy and seeing a counsellor for your depression and PTSD.  How’s that working out for you?  I see you’ve missed your last two appointments since you’ve been staying with your sister.”
Eventually, Sherlock broke the stare and slumped back a bit in his chair, defeated.
Chapter 1
) that John couldn’t help but oblige.  All of which were usually followed by Sherlock panting, “my love, oh, my love” as he teetered over the abyss.
John didn’t keep track of how long Sherlock was at it this time around, but it was long enough to make him hot enough to abandon his blankets, for he threw them off himself violently.  John shivered at both the loss of contact and the cool air hitting his wet backside.
John tucked his feet between Sherlock’s calves and did exactly that.
John instinctively reached for the towel and pulled it to cover the scar.
She took a deep breath as a woman who was clearly the manager came from behind the velvet curtain, eyebrows drawn up in concern.
“I can’t possibly believe people do that.”
people on your property all the time!  No one pays them any attention; they come and do their business and nobody's the wiser.  Like the refuse collectors.”
Ding Dong Dell
He reached the first room on the right and tried the door: it was unlocked, so he let himself in, prepared for anything.  It was completely empty, void of furniture or mysterious people.  The next three rooms on both sides were also empty.  He continued on until he reached the end.  The last room, however, was actually furnished.  As far as John could tell through the small beam of his torch, it was a room someone had actually lived in.  Feeling oddly compelled, he stepped in for a closer look around.  Books lined a shelf.  He glanced at the titles -- a mix of mathematical texts, popular bestsellers, a few gardening photography books.  There were photographs, too, hung on the walls: a family portrait of a man, tall and thin with a kind face, and woman with long blonde hair.  She had a face like a fox: clever and mischievous, cunning, even.  She looked proud of her family, though, and she had her arms around her two sons, one a tall teen, the other a small, bored-looking boy with a mop of curly black hair.  There was a photo that was obviously a younger Mycroft Holmes in his graduation robes, and a picture of an Irish setter with the curly-haired boy, the his arms around the dog’s neck.  At once John felt like an intruder, realizing that the room must have belonged to the late Mrs. and Mr. Holmes.  He quickly left, closing the door quietly behind him.  Nothing there but old memories.
He held his prize aloft: a dripping, slimy boot.
“Did you take it?”
“In,” he murmured.  “Slowly.  Let me feel you.”
After breakfast, John put on his trainers and jacket.  He would have to remember to ask Mrs. Hudson if there was a pair of binoculars somewhere he could borrow.
Sherlock swallows.  Annoyingly, his mouth keeps going dry.  He relaxes his facial muscles: give nothing away.
“Just a moment.  I’ll see if she’s available.  She actually gives some of the speciality massage packages herself.  May I mention your friend’s name?”
“The tuba, you idiot.”
“How do you work that out?”
“Too bad.  It’s been a long time since I’ve held such a beauty in my lap.”
“We don’t have to...right now,” said John.  “I mean, I’m game, always, but this is a big step and… I don’t even think I have any…”
“Wow.”
“The action, the challenge.”
“Yes.  Well, I say friend.  Helps me think, sometimes.  Having someone to talk to.  I like company when I go out.”
“Navya Kapur,” said Sherlock.
“Oh!  Sorry.  Molly.  Molly Hooper.”  She made to stick her hand out, remembered that it was dirty, and abandoned the shake in a strange, shy, finger-waggling wave.
“Yes.  Myself, of course, my son, Robert...the catering manager, the hospitality director, and, er...several of the therapy people.”
“Have you two...?”  John inquired, just to make sure.
“What about cigarettes?”
“Sherlock?” he asked.
It was raining, and the smoky weak light of morning filtered through the curtains, interrupted only by the soft, yellow glow from the lamp.  In the years since it was built, 221B had witnessed the lives of all sorts of human beings with all sorts of interesting lives, had been the home to families, friends, and lovers, had survived fires and tasteless decor, and had housed the newborn and the dying.  John wondered, as he closed his eyes to Sherlock’s bedroom, if the four walls that held them now had ever seen anything as beautiful (and slightly scandalous) as what was happening in it now.
“Christ, I knew you’d want to know.  Fine.  If you want to stick it under a microscope, go ahead.  I just don’t want to know about it.  No spreadsheets.”
“Perhaps you should drop anchor in my port,” replied Sherlock, causing John to dissolve into another fit of giggling.  Perhaps the wine was more potent than he’d thought.
“The fuck I will,” stated John, breathing heavily.
“But the blog was entertaining.”
He must have felt the questioning stare of three people, for he cleared his throat.
“Let’s go,” said Sherlock, standing up and brushing himself off.  “You’ll want to see the Japanese Garden.”  The closeness they’d shared a moment ago had completely evaporated, and John found Sherlock back to his normal, aloof self, as they slipped quietly out of the abandoned castle ruins and back onto the main path.
After, my heart is back where it belongs, my cock a simple penis once more.  John lies on his back, arms under his head.  I curl to his side, place my head on his shoulder.  I can smell him best this way, can listen to the thump of his heart.
The choice of tune is obvious as soon as John gets through the door: Mycroft’s there.  Great.
Turning the shower thermostat to a comfortable temperature, I realise that I want nothing more than to reverse my steps and finish what we’d started.  Every moment I’m away from him, even if separated by the mere thickness of a bathroom door, is an opportunity for him to change his mind, to remember all the times he insisted what we had was nothing, to reclaim the words, “we’re not like that,” and retract what he said in the pool.  (He won’t.  You
He slept the two and half hour journey -- the rocking of the train somehow reminding him of military transport over uneven terrain.  Transport was frequently one of the only times when he
They sat in silence for a while before Sherlock said, “I didn’t know you cared that much about my appearance.” A smile played across his mouth.
John’s eyebrows came together in concern.  He’d seen patients with the flu who looked better than she did.
“Now,” he continues, “the real trick is to use your lips.”
Slowly, they followed the gravel path toward the garden door, their arms brushing together.  John wondered whether Sherlock would enjoy holding hands and was contemplating whether or not he should go for it when they both noticed the roses.  Sherlock turned to John, smiling, his eyes shining and full of fondness.  John rummaged in his pocket for his penknife.  He gave it to Sherlock, who cut a stem with half-opened flower.
Since moving in with Sherlock things are starting to get better.  Between the adrenaline and the insanity, he’s made a friend, and while his unusual flatmate isn’t exactly tactile, at least he is another human to live with, and sometimes John manages to get off with someone he likes well enough.  ‘Sometimes’ being the appropriate modifier.
After a few minutes of simple, gentle touch, Sherlock shifted behind him, took his arse in those big hands, parted the cheeks, felt with his nose and lips along the cleft until his tongue found what it was looking for.  John sighed into the pillow, shivering not from the chill but rather from the still-illicit feeling of Sherlock’s tongue against his hole.  It was filthy and perfect, and from somewhere under the blankets, Sherlock groaned too.
John squirms a bit.  Surely one is not supposed to have conversations with one’s daughter about  intimate relationships.  He and Sherlock have danced around it for years.  It’s reached a lovely equilibrium at last; they are fast friends, they share silence and space and even hug.  They don’t tell each other they love each other because it is an acknowledged fact.  They have never kissed, although John would be lying to himself if he denied thinking about it.  He thinks about it more than he should.  Sherlock is family.
Sherlock was waiting for him by the lift.
“Take the 12:49 train.  Bring your things; if you are suitable you can take occupancy immediately.  I’ll meet you at the station.”  And with that, she rang off.
John was awakened by the feeling of proximity.  It was not an uncomfortable feeling, but one that he noticed, even while asleep.  He dragged himself out of a pleasant but unmemorable dream, up through the cobwebs of slumber, and opened his eyes.
The world looks a bit funny at 4am.  John knows all about the psychological effects of sleep deprivation, knows that his perception is altered.  Sherlock’s not immune to it either, try as he might to redefine the body as transport.  72 hours without sleep would send anyone right round the bend.  They’re starving, exhausted, and giggly.  And at the moment, nothing seems more amusing than the fact that the detective, the posh tosser, actually smells like hell, that expensive deodorant finally failing.  He hasn’t brushed his teeth, there are real bags under those mercurial eyes, and his hair is a wreck.
“Anyway, it was too much like hard work, so I moved into town to be closer.  Next to Margie,” he added, suddenly looking like he’d revealed too much.
“Whatever.  If you’re not interested, then I’d better be getting back to work.”
“Stay with me,” said Watson.  “Focus.  Breathe.  You’ll be all right.”
“Yes.”  Sherlock looked at the ladder and climbed up to the second to the top rung, then outstretched his arms as if he were pruning an invisible tree.  “Shake it,” he said over his shoulder.
“And what’s up with choosing
John nodded.

thought John.
John thought of Owens, who had, after they had left him, turned himself in to the local police.  The Holmes brothers decided that while Owens had certainly been negligent, he had never intended to kill Archibald.  He had already served a self-imposed twenty years of seclusion and was not a threat to himself or the community.  Sherlock had intimated that Mycroft met with Owens at some point, but John wasn’t privy to the extent of that conversation, nor did he want to be.
“Granted, I don’t know what year they were made just by looking at them,” he said.  “They’re old, that’s certain, but the leather’s decay would be accelerated by being submerged.  I’ll have to examine the soles and insoles. The size of the shoe is a general indicator of the wearer’s height, and width helps determine weight.  Tread is very important; wear patterns can reveal what type of work the wearer might have done, or if he had any particular walking habits.  The heels, for instance.”
John didn’t attempt to ask for more.
“I don’t care.  Yes.  To whatever.  Please.”
“Can we do it without the flirtation this time?”
“You cried,” said Sally.  “Your eyes went like saucers” --she mimed Sherlock’s expression--- “and then you started crying, right there in the mud.”
John kept his touch light as he spread the oil; Sherlock’s cock leapt in his hands.  John marvelled at its weight and heat.  Gorgeous.  Simply gorgeous.
“Did you talk to your sister, Sergeant Donovan?”
Thanks to Bettyswallocks for the British betaing.  I find the subtle differences in phrasings and idioms a continual source of amazement.  Fascinating.  Canolacrush wields a whip while betaing, striking out my convoluted passages and sometimes awkward phrasing.  And Scullyseviltwin let me know that this chapter was not too fluffy or sappy (soppy, says Betty).
.  For the love of Christ -- MYCROFT!” he bellowed.
“You're smiling,” said Sherlock.  “I can tell.”  He extricated himself from John’s arms and turned around.  “Did I say something funny?”
“Wow.  Well.”
Neither man noticed.
thorough.  It’s not exactly legal, but...”
John waits.  They have both learned patience.
“What about here?”
Sherlock develops a cough for the rest of the week and doesn’t touch the tuba once.
“I’m sorry, boys, but I’ve got to get going.”  She stood and regarded Sherlock warmly.  “You’ve grown up so handsome,” she said.  “I wish your father could have seen you now.”
“Not a big deal.  My fiancee is constantly amused that I’m saving for our first flat by massaging other people - but she never laughs when I turn these magic fingers on her.”  He waggled his ‘magic fingers’ mysteriously.
“We are.”
Somewhere above him, Sherlock swore, a fluent string of filthy words.  John would have smiled if he could have, but, for the first time in his life, he had a cock in his mouth.
And with that, Sherlock was off, following Lillian into the pool area and out of sight.
John began perfunctorily stripping before he thought too hard about it.  Sherlock swallowed audibly and turned around.  “Would you like me to step out while you undress?” he asked quietly.
He pointed a finger at Ella.  “Past tense.”
Sherlock jerked away, taking John’s hand with him.  “This was a stupid idea,” Sherlock muttered, scrambling to get away.  John was momentarily afraid of spraining his wrist.  He managed to retract it from Sherlock’s trousers before he broke something.
Owens turned his gaze toward John, who shrugged.  He
“Need more data,” the detective eventually announced, abruptly swirling around and abandoning his introspection.  “Molly,” he began as he collected his belongings, “where do you get your, oh wait, of course you don’t.  Not with your stagnant social life, frankly awful taste in men, and obsession with cats.  Probably not appropriate to ask anyway, never mind.  John, give me your phone.  I have to make an appointment.”
“Hope he confesses?  Appeal to a guilty conscience?”
They’d been up all night, and now that the case is closed and they are heading home, the transport is making its demands known.  Hunger, while usually the first of his body’s cries for attention, isn’t currently on the top of the list.  He’d eaten earlier -- John had handed him something in a Pret a Manger bag (perhaps some kind of a cake?) -- and his stomach wasn’t protesting as it usually did.  No, at the moment, he really wasn’t thinking about food.  High on post-case adrenaline and buoyed by John’s praise, he allows himself to experience another kind of appetite. Something he’d long ago suppressed: desire.  Of the sexual kind, that is.
Sherlock considered it, drawing his feet up under him.  “Fine,” he said, then turned his attention to the fire.
theory,” she says to herself.  “Let’s have it back now.”
Sherlock collected his things and wrapped his scarf around his neck before turning his attention to John’s phone.  His eyebrows came together as he scanned for something before he nodded decisively.
That was until one night, when his sleep was interrupted by the chattering blades of Mycroft’s helicopter.
“Why?”
“You could use it to write down the things you don't like to put into spoken words. Your anger, for example.”
“Dancing?”
“Wow.”
.  Romantically,” she clarifies.  “I told her you weren’t interested.”
Sherlock gave him a blank look.
Chapter One: The Only One Left
“God yes,” he breathed.
“You what?”
“Yes!” John practically yelled.  It was his turn to look out the window.  “Or at least you’re mine.”
“Oh, Sherlock,” he said, finding those strange, grey-green eyes and holding them.  “With every fibre of my being.”
“Payback,” he muttered, shifted a bit in his seat, and let one slide.
Sherlock shrugged.
going to get the hate mail.”
As he wiped sweat from his brow, he looked around the garden and realised that restoring it to its former glory would be beyond his ability.  But the one corner, he thought, that could be his, and he could tidy it up and maybe get some flowers to bloom.  He hated being idle.  Military life had always afforded him some type of action; even when there weren’t waves of battle casualties, both soldiers and civilians needing his expertise, there was always something to do.  He felt needed, something he never felt growing up, always forgotten, pushed aside in favour of Harry’s drama, his mother’s depression, and his father’s inability to hold down a job very long.  As a doctor, it was his job to put things to right, to heal, stitch back together that which was broken and torn.  In some strange way, the garden seemed like a patient, like someone whose muscles had atrophied and had to begin the laborious process of learning to move his limbs again.
Sherlock concentrates on breathing.  Does he want to kiss John?  It’s becoming clearer that he might.
Sherlock exhaled, fiddled with his fingers for a moment.  “I’d love a cigarette,” he said.
“I’m sorry, Mr. Owens,” he said, not knowing what else to say.  “I’m sorry.”
“John?”
Eurus’ eyes flash.  “Ooh!  You didn’t like it.  Her body was all wrong, wasn’t it?  Too petite, she didn’t smell right.  Clever, clever, clever minds. It would be so much nicer if you could just fuck with your brain, now, wouldn’t it?  Just put your skulls together and let it happen?  You liked her brain.  But you don’t need any more brains, now, do you?  Granted, Mycroft’s ability surpasses your own, but you’re quite content with what you have.  You think you’re clever.  Be careful.  Pride cometh before the fall.  And you know all about falling, don’t you?”
The uncharacteristically warm weather continued.  John sweated on the train and dealt with a few patients who really needed to shower more than once or twice a week.  He worked three days straight in which he spent most of his free hours thinking.  He even considered calling Harry, but never got around to pressing the green button that would connect his call.
“Gets a bit drafty,” Mrs. Hudson continued, “but if you cover the windows at night it’s not too unbearable.  Fireplace has been converted to gas, so you just flip that little switch there.  I put a kettle in the cupboard there for you.  No use going all the way to the kitchens for a cuppa.  You’ve got an ensuite bathroom, too.  Thought you’d appreciate some privacy.  Some of the rooms on the first floor share one.  It has a lovely view, too.  Come look.”  She waved him over to peer out the windows.  The weather had deteriorated into a slow, steady drizzle, but he could see the woods in the distance and a vast expanse of lawn.
“I’m sorry, my friend,” said Mycroft, who did seem genuinely apologetic  “I had not wanted to mention anything to you until I was sure something was indeed amiss.  It was not my intent to ruin you.”
“I don’t think so, Sherlock.”
“Please,” the woman whispered.
“Yes,” said Sherlock.
“Maybe your father gave it to her, as a token of friendship.  Could it have been his buttonhole for the day?”
“What’s in there?”
“It’s all tangled,” Sherlock said at length, whispering into John’s neck.
“Twelfth century,” Sherlock said quietly.  “Look around you.  What do you see?”
“You’ve quite a list.”
and a whole group of children would just sit down and listen.  To Dickens!  Ha!  He had this really deep, beautiful voice, he did.”
“Must have been a heck of a job.  I can’t imagine how overgrown it was.  Have you shown your brother yet?” asked Lestrade when Sherlock wandered back over.
“And I figured that you wouldn’t mind a bit.  Being” - he made a distasteful face - “massaged.”
“I know you rub your feet together when you sit in your chair and before you fall asleep; I know you have at least fourteen different shades of hair on your head; I know your smiles and all the lines of your face; I know how many times you lick your lips a day.”  He paused, swallowed, and continued.  “I know when you are truly angry with me; I know when I’ve hurt you.  I know you hate it when I don’t eat; I know you worry about my health.  I know you care for me very deeply.  I know I have acted foolishly, and I know I have avoided this.”
“Suit yourself,” said John, shrugging.  “Unattached.  Just like me.” He didn’t mean anything by it, just stating a fact, but realised that his words may have been misconstrued when Sherlock’s expression shifted.  He looked a particular way when he was deducing, John realized.  Tiny muscles twitched in his face before finally settling on a combination of both surprise and confusion.
Sherlock scrunched his eyebrows and scowled.  “I give you an opportunity to ask me anything and you choose to ask about my taste in dessert?”
Riding with Sherlock was by far the most exhilarating thing John had done since he’d been home.  Shooting pheasants had been cathartic, but there was something freeing in letting someone else have control for once.  Sherlock took the rural back roads to Leeds, winding through lush, green pastures still covered with morning dew.  Their circuitous path added time to their drive but generally avoided traffic.  He drove faster than he probably should when they hit open stretches of road, taking off too quickly and rounding corners just a bit too fast, just enough to get John’s adrenaline going a bit.  Perhaps being cooped up for so long made Sherlock reckless, made him feel the need to push the boundaries a bit. Something told John, though, that boundaries didn’t mean much to Sherlock in the first place.
Sherlock steadies himself.  “...I’ve bought a cottage.”
He looks at John’s swollen, red lips.  “Maybe.  You’re not completely hopeless,” he replies, smiling fondly.
“I also happened to notice that you have a few loose slates on your roof.  You might want to think about a repair before it begins to leak.  I’d offer to help you myself if you have a ladder handy.  That is, if you could hold it steady.”
He carries it in his jacket pocket for a long time, clenches his hand around it.  He does not tell Ella.
“Go on,” said John, sitting up again and watching Sherlock, still gloriously nude, sit up and check his phone.  John sipped his tea and appreciated the long expanse of his lover’s back.  Everything about Sherlock was slim and long.  His feet, his legs, his neck, his forearms, his... well.  That too.
Owens licked his lips.  “You can press them,” he offered, to John’s surprise.  “It’s not hard.”  He got up then, disappeared for a moment, and returned with a ornate metal frame, which he handed to John.  Inside was a flattened thistle.  “That was my mother’s,” he said quietly.  “My dad gave it to her when they married.  She was from Perth.”
“Oh, no,” said John, smiling, “We have a mutual friend, so I was hoping to drop in and say hello.”
“It made you uncomfortable.”
Thanks to the usual suspects for betaing and cheerleading.  Love you guys!  And thanks to all the readers who have left such nice comments.  I can't believe it half the time.  Thanks so much.
Navya tried not to think of Sherlock and John “enjoying themselves” and sighed.  “Maybe a bit of a scandal is what this place needed, after all. Reception says the phone’s been ringing off the hook with new bookings all afternoon.  Who knows?”
“It’s just that I’ve been wanting to tell you…”
John furrowed his brow and stared at the man in the picture.  “You’re pulling my leg.”
Sherlock nudged under John’s ear with his nose, licked at his neck.  “Get on that chair,” he demanded before climbing off the bed and heading for the bathroom.
John checked his watch.  “I’ve got to work in the morning.  Let’s get dinner cleared up and you can get started.  Maybe you can at least find how old they are tonight and see if they’re even from the right time period.  I’ll call Stamford and if everything looks good, you can come into Leeds with me tomorrow and use the lab while I’m at work.”
“Yes!  Of course.”  He hoped it was something agreeable.  One never knew with Sherlock.
“My father had a particular habit.  He wore a flower in his buttonhole every day.  Without fail, John.  Every.  Single.  Day.  Mummy tucked one in his lapel on the day they met and he’d done it ever since.  Usually it was one he’d grown himself, outdoors or in a hothouse, but sometimes in the winter months when nothing was blooming, he’d go to a florist and buy a bouquet just so he would have one every day of the week.  It was the first thing he did, every morning, right after breakfast.  He was a meticulous man. He didn’t have a flower when Mummy found him.”
beautiful: cellulite, stretch marks, blemishes, hair, and all.  The
The crowd parted to reveal a woman on the ground, gasping for breath.  John wished he could see her skin, but she was completely covered with coloured powder.
?  Why are you looking at me like that?”
Encouraging Sherlock to reinvestigate his father’s death, though, may be overstepping his bounds.  He somehow felt propelled by a sense of urgency; once the house sold, a chapter of their lives would be closed: the garden would belong to someone else, and there would be nothing to keep any of them in Burnett Thwaite.  John knew that if Sherlock didn’t find out now, he never would.  And John knew he could do it, knew it in the marrow of his bones.  Sherlock had only been 13 when Archibald died, and his mind, while certainly brilliant, surely hadn’t fully developed to its current capacity.  However, the case was so emotional, so personal, and as Sherlock was always so keen to say, sentiment clouded his logic and rational thought.  It wouldn’t be an easy case, or, as Sherlock said, remotely enjoyable.
“John, no.”
“It’s not like you’ve never, Sherlock Holmes,” said Lestrade, who was taking the opportunity in a break in traffic to change lanes.
“Johnny,” said Harry at last, “I do love you.  I’m worried. Just get better.”
“You know those aren’t even true petals,” said Sherlock, picking another one of his own.  “The flowers are actually the yellow things, here.  And these,”  he ran his thumb over the white petals, “are ligules.”
O I say these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but of the soul,
Sherlock nodded, but said nothing.
“John, I think I might have a solution to your problem,” said Sherlock, rearranging himself more comfortably on the warm ground.  “May I?”
The day after the face-slapping incident, John returned home an hour later than he’d hoped from the surgery to find Sherlock glued to his microscope.  He was still in his pyjamas and dressing gown, and it looked like he really hadn’t gone out, although he was clean-shaven and his hair tamed to its “I’m going out” perfection.
John smiled.  “Yeah.  You too.”  Time stretched out, and John was struck by an odd feeling, like he should invite Sherlock in for a drink, or something.  Something
“I do hope that’s not included in your definition of ‘kinky sex.”
Thankfully, John was busy the rest of the afternoon after his lunch with Mycroft and was able to put his unease aside.  He swapped shifts with another doctor at the surgery so he could have four uninterrupted days in which to assist Sherlock, and on his way home he stopped off at Boots and purchased two different types of personal lubricant and a box of condoms.  Sherlock had promptly (and unabashedly) informed John that he was free of any “infectious or otherwise unpleasant afflictions” their first night together, but John thought he should best be prepared just in case things went in that direction.  The prospect filled him with a delightful nervous anticipation the likes of which he hadn’t felt in ages.
The morning went by quickly, but his afternoon paperwork was dreadfully boring, even if it was punctuated with brief texts from Sherlock throughout.  John wrapped up for the day around 4pm, got himself a latte at the cafe on the corner by the surgery, and walked to Jimmy’s.  August was right around the corner, and the late afternoon heat was enough to make him reconsider purchasing a hot coffee.  He had been so wrapped up in the case the past two days that he’d nearly forgotten the fact that Holmes Hall would officially go on the market in just under a week.  Even if the house sold the first week, there would be enough paperwork and official business during the conveyancing process that the buyers wouldn’t take ownership for a few months at least.  Both he and Sherlock felt the pressure of finishing up, of figuring out what exactly happened to Archibald Holmes.  The house had always been a summer place for Sherlock, associated with long, quiet days, blooming flowers, heat. When summer went, the Holmeses went with it.
“The man who got out of the helicopter with you.  Can I be of assistance?  He didn’t look well.”
John doesn’t answer.
He was lying on his side, and there, not three feet from him, was Sherlock, who had pulled up a chair and was crouched in it, arms wrapped across his knees, staring.
Willow Cross?”
“She hit me!” Sherlock said dejectedly, raising his hand to his cheek.
what I’m trying to say at all, John,” grumbled Sherlock, irritated.
“Dangerous even in your thleep,” sad Sherlock as they lay face-to-face on a brand-new sheet.
