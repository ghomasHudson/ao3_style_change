He shouldn't have gotten himself so worked up about it. His master might be spoiling him with treats but that didn't mean he was going to get everything he wanted.
Castiel picked up the spoon and dragged it through the porridge, drawing circles that slowly faded. "He asks...he asks me to get him hard first. With my mouth. Then tells me to lay on the cot. Then..." Castiel made a crude gesture with his spoon. It was obvious enough what he did.
Gabriel took off into the house.
Dean sighed and relaxed. He pulled the blanket around himself and after a few minutes, went back to sleep. Castiel gave a quiet snort of amusement. He doubted Dean would even remember the incident when he woke up.
Castiel sniffed. He knew he wasn't a beta. Before he had been told to leave all the other children at the schoolhouse had made sure he never forgot that.
Castiel scoffed. Honourable? They were thieves to begin with and now they were liars. He should have never trusted Dean. He should have known better.
His master carried him to the bedroom. Dean was gently placed at the bottom of the bed. His master sat down beside him and stretched his tails. Dean carefully watched where the dagger tail went.
Castiel relaxed into the mattress. Dean wasn't upset about it. If anything, Dean seemed happy to have his mating tail wrapped around him, holding him tight.
Gabriel winked at Castiel. "See? We're notorious sinners."
He was trapped.
Dean didn't see him for the rest of the day ‒ there was still miles of ship he hadn't mapped out yet ‒ but his master was back twelve hours later. Right on time for dinner.
Evan trailed his fingers down to Castiel's chest and stomach. One hand curled around Castiel's hip while the other slid between Castiel's thighs.
"Two loaves of bread," Castiel said before thinking. He fought back a self-deprecating cringe. He could have said more. He could have said
"Was he as good as they say he is?" Michael called out to someone behind Castiel.
Dean glanced up at his master. Was he being traded for a younger pet? Was this a play date?
Castiel tugged his cloak tighter around himself and reached for the door. For a moment his mind raced in panic. What if the door was locked and he had to come back when people would see? The door opened as he pulled. He breathed in relief. He stepped into the dark bakery. It was already uncomfortably warm despite the cool early morning. In a few more hours it would be stifling hot.
His master went to a counter and opened cupboards above it. If Dean stood back a few feet he could just see the top of the counter.
Castiel didn't care that it sounded so close to begging.
His master snorted.
Castiel sighed. A warm glow spread through his chest. Virginity was overrated, he decided. This was far better. He could see why even the elders had all been tempted when they were young.
desperate. A little external stimulation wasn't that disgusting really. It would really only be genuinely unsanitary if he let his mating tail unfurl while his pet had his mouth on it; all those human bacteria getting into his reproductive organs.
It wasn't the weirdest thing his master had done and Dean doubted it would be the last weird thing his master did.
The walk back to the market had Castiel's stomach in coils. He knew the reason why people wouldn't sell them things was because of him. Because of the brand on his face that they put there.
Dean pressed closer to his master. He knew the ship wasn't shaking apart as it plummeted towards a planet. That was just him shaking in his own skin.
And then you had me dragged through the village square as a whore. You don't get to be family." He picked up the wooden cup full of water from beside the bed and hurled it at Mary Winchester. "Now get out! And don't you ever come back here!"
His grandmother waved her walking stick dismissively. "Another week or two and someone will be caught stealing or sleeping with their neighbour's wife and the priest will have a new sermon. They'll forget about us again."
Castiel laughed softly. Dean was always the one who got caught for their adventures. He was forever confined to his room for the things they got up to.
tasted like chocolate. He grabbed it and dug in. He wasn't going to turn down a treat.
Castiel was pinned to the bed, lying in sweat and slick. He didn't care in the least. His thighs were trembling and his heart was still racing. The aftershocks of his orgasm still had him twitching. He could feel his hole clenching around Evan's cock.
A soft little gasp escaped his lips. What if they were waiting for the baker to find him? What if they were going to keep trying to ruin him and accuse him of stealing the loaf of bread?
Anna looked up at Castiel. Her eyes went wide. Castiel could feel her eyes tracking over the brand. Anna flushed red and snapped her gaze back down to the baby. Castiel angled his head away to hide the brand.
When the priest had come to the schoolhouse to talk about mating they'd both been sent home. They were sirens and shouldn't be tempted. None of the other children had ever said a word about what the priest had talked about and after that day few would talk to them. It wasn't long after that they were both told they shouldn't be in the schoolhouse with the others anymore.
Dean shook with laughter. "Thanks, nice to know what you think of me."
He made it inside without getting chopped in half but his heart rocketed into his throat anyway as soon as he saw who his master was meeting with.
His master ‒ maybe ex-master ‒ pet his head once more then left.
Castiel pressed his head back into the sheets. Pleasure burned through him from his hole and cock. His whole body was tensing up. He was going to come. No one but himself and Dean had made him come before.
Michael begged.
A life unfolded before Castiel's eyes. Dean had come back. They'd be mated and married. No one would call him siren whore anymore. His grandmother would shame the whole village for what they'd done to him. The priest would beg forgiveness and
His grandmother glared at Gabriel.
Castiel felt his face flush red in embarrassment. He had been so naïve that first heat, he had thought his slick was Dean's come. And he was still a naïve idiot that didn't know how to whore himself right.
Warnings for: birth scene and survival sex.
His grandmother turned his head back. She unwrapped her scarf and fussed with it until she had it tucked into Castiel's jacket; sheltering Deidre and soaking up the milk that leaked from his breasts.
Castiel looked over the row of cages in dismay. Did he really want a second-hand pet? It would come with all the problems of its previous owner.
all over his hand Castiel pulled away.
"But it's hurt since then?" his grandmother asked.
It was gross. His
He drifted off to sleep with Dean wrapped around him making his content human noises.
treats and was still going to pout about it.
Castiel wrinkled his nose at the suggestion. The more water he drank the more slick he made. He sat up. Sweat trickled down his forehead. He wiped it away. "I hate this."
Castiel clacked his claws together in agreement. He had assumed the way Dean frequently wrapped around him was bonding behaviour but he was glad all the same to have someone confirm it.
Castiel seethed. He hated them all. Not one person in the village had believed his story once John Winchester had made up his own. He picked the Winchesters out in the crowd. He glared at them; keeping his eyes from the brazier and brand heating beside him.
Dean rolled on top of him. He grinned. "You think I'm a siren?"
Dean touched the collar. "Okay. So you're not getting rid of me." He gave his master's leg a quick hug then grabbed the other human's hand and let himself be led into the home of a dragon. He craned his head over his shoulder and called back to his master, "See you later, alligator!"
His therapist had sternly told him that it wasn't communication he needed. He needed
Two of them were nowhere near sexually compatible with him and one, after he read up on the species and their sex acts, would probably result in his death even if he was careful.
Dean was his usual grumpy self about being bathed. He'd twist away or chatter darkly at him while eyeing the sanitizing clothes like he wanted to bite them.
Castiel stood in front of the bakery and tried to imagine bringing home food rather than what the baker's hands would feel like. Daven Hills wasn't a field labourer but he didn't shy away from hard work. Castiel had seen him heft bags of flour as big as Anna and watched him pull loaves of bread from hot ovens with his hands when his baker's peel wasn't immediately at hand.
His grandmother sighed with soft sympathy. She sat down beside him and explained about using his fingers to get himself ready. Castiel listened silently, too embarrassed to ask questions. He had thought he knew so much but he hadn't even known he could make slick outside of a heat.
Dean thought his master would either come stomping after him and carry him back to the bedroom or at least growl out a few
Dean bit his lip and shivered. "Should I keep...?"
When the basket was full Castiel made to pass it to Gabriel but his grandmother stopped him.
Castiel gently pressed the tip of his mating tail to Dean's mouth. "Lick."
Dean quickly burrowed into his blanket and sighed happily, apparently having already forgotten how much he didn't like baths.
Castiel drowsily accepted the water and mouthed at a lump of bread. He was just so tired. He felt his eyes sink shut. He dozed in and out of consciousness as his grandmother and Gabriel took care of things.
I'm doing!?" Castiel yelled back. He fisted a handful of blankets and bore down. He groaned and panted until the contraction stopped. He slumped down into the bed and growled, "It didn't take this long to put it in there."
His master made more soft hissing sounds and clicked his claws. He bent down and picked Dean up.
"That's it." His grandmother said. "All you do now is spend the rest of your life worrying over which god heard the plea." She watched the smoke go up. "Not every god is something you'd want favour from."
He didn't let go even though he knew he should. But it wasn't as if he was using his
"Be still." Castiel tugged at the leash to get Dean's attention. The leash wasn't tight enough to keep him in place but it seemed to remind him to not squirm so much.
Dean pouted at him and chattered incessantly while Castiel sanitized his hand. It was far from the first time he had gotten Dean's saliva on him. Dean had a tendency to drool in his sleep. But it wasn't exactly hygienic. It was frankly disgusting. He had seen Dean use his mouth to open things or tear things apart. The plethora of bacteria a human mouth housed was why he brushed Dean's teeth so frequently.
Evan breathed heavy against his ear before finally pushing himself up. Castiel hissed as he pulled his cock out. Come and slick dripped from his hole. Evan sat back on his knees and looked down at the come on Castiel's stomach.
those damn doors were a safety hazard. He stalked back up to the door and kicked it. "Stupid fucking doors."
He pushed open the third door on the left. Evan Fawkes's room was small and spartan. There was a dresser and a bed and room for nothing more.
Dean glanced up. His master was sprawled in his chair in the corner. His dagger tail flicked at him. Dean sighed. He scooped up the last of his breakfast and licked his fingers clean— nobody ever gave pets spoons. He got up, shoved his bowl up onto the counter, and went to his master.
At the end of the day he fed Dean again then carried him to the bathroom for a bath. He knew his pet would try to avoid baths if he could. Making sure he was sleepy with food and carrying him to it made things go smoother.
at him, laughing as they ran off.
when Dean cautiously reached out again. The scales on Castiel's back started lifting in arousal.
"You're a noisy little thing," Evan commented, grinning. He pulled out and snapped his hips forward, making Castiel groan again. "Daven didn't mention that." He started thrusting at a steady pace, slowly picking up speed. He reached between them and stroked Castiel's cock. "Or does he not bother with you at all?"
"I don't mind so much." Castiel said. He had thought he'd be angry forever about what had happened to him but once spring had come he found he wasn't. He knew what the village said about him was a lie. And besides, half the women in the village had asked him to nurse their children. If they wanted his milk they'd treat him with more respect.
Gabriel snorted.
"Please, dude. I don't know what I did wrong." Dean put his hands up and backed away from his master. "But I swear. I'll never do it again."
Dean stumbled back and pressed himself up against his master's legs.
"It's slick," Castiel explained. "It's like how women get wet."
The baker nodded. He pointed to the far corner of the room. Castiel looked over his shoulder to see a tiny cot tucked away behind bags of flour. His heart started to race. His face flushed red. He turned away and started for the cot. He could hear Daven Hills following behind him.
Castiel glanced between Cepheus and the door. He wanted to push, to try and persuade Cepheus, but he didn't want to put him off either. He'd rather have the small amount Cepheus paid him on occasion than nothing more at all.
Deidre squirmed against his chest. She was wrapped in blankets tucked inside his threadbare coat with the cloak over them to cut the chill wind. He shifted her around to his other breast and grimaced at the wetness that leaked from the first. Kervin Fawkes strolled by and spat the words
"People call
Rachel Goodson looked up, confused and tired. She glanced out the window then back to Castiel's grandmother. "All morning."
"Good Dean," Castiel said absently as he drifted at the edge of sleep. "Good pet."
He thought that was probably safe. He didn't feed Dean his dental treats with his mating tale since it was something that had to be chewed— he didn't want to encourage biting anywhere near his mating tale.
Castiel huffed out a laugh. He wasn't going to miss having mashed carrot in his hair. He wiped the worst of it off himself and fed Deidre what was left of her breakfast.
His grandmother grabbed his wrist and pulled him over anyway. She folded his fingers up and slid two inside Rachel. His eyes went wide.
"I prayed!" his mother whimpered. "I prayed so hard!"
Castiel didn't want a pet but his therapist had suggested it since he refused to hire extra crew. The entire
"It's not any different from you two fixing things in the village," his grandmother said. She tapped Deidre's nose and made a face at her. "Is it, DeeDee?" She turned back to the rest of them. "Hurry up. The day waits for no one."
"Fuck," Dean swore. He pushed more. His thighs shook. His cock pushed further in. "Fuck. Fuck, is this...?"
Dean swallowed his mush. "Dude, if you're that worried about me biting you, you could just give me the bowl back."
planned on throwing out the used sex toys when they were done with them so what did it matter if Uth ate them instead? He shrugged it off and messaged Uth back. He'd buy edible-for-Hflips eggs.
But Gabriel was wrong too. Castiel had meant the curses he'd uttered. He'd meant them with every bone in his body.
His grandmother snorted in amusement. "
"Qech is a house." He pointed to the dragon and pat its leg.
had fondled his mating tail. He knew it was innocent. Dean didn't know any better. He was just a pet looking for the warmth of his master. But a
Castiel looked over his shoulder again. People were still watching. He doubted they'd help him. He clutched the loaf of bread in his hands. He had it. He could run back to his family in the market. It wasn't as though Sam Winchester could come after him and call him a thief.
His master strode out of the bathroom at a slow pace. Dean had to jog to keep up. For every step his master took he had to take three.
He flicked his eyes open before his head could start playing the re-runs of being shoved into a clear crate ‒ all so giant monsters could see the contents ‒ and that horrible growl of a cargo door opening into empty black. The monsters had shoved crate after crate out into the nothing on entry orbits then closed the cargo door behind them.
When he reached it he didn't hesitate to pull open the door to the Silver Head and go in. He breathed in relief when he pulled the door closed behind him. He might be there to whore himself but at least the village wasn't staring at him.
He added finding partners for a day or two to his list of things for his next stop.
The employee puffed up in worry. "That one might not be suitable to travel. It's something of an escape artist."
"It'll be a while yet before we have another Blackdog." His grandmother said. "We need to clean your face up in the meantime."
The room filled with a garble of noise. Dean wasn't sure if it was supposed to be music or a newsfeed. Dean settled in for a few boring hours of being a lap pet and having a headache from the jumble of noise.
"It's real." Gabriel said, passing it back to Castiel's grandmother.
Deidre chose then to squirm in his lap and smash her hand into the bowel of mashed carrots that made up her breakfast.
He was panting and sweating with pain when Daven Hills finally shoved forward and groaned. The baker slumped on top of him, crushing him to the cot. Castiel breathed hard as the pain started to lessen with Daven's softening cock.
The employee encouraged him to interact with the humans before leaving to help a family that needed something from a high shelf.
his master scooped him up again and carried him to his office.
Castiel frowned at the dusty road that led home. The villagers never forgot what they called him.
Dean breathed deep before nodding. He leaned in. Castiel opened his mouth. Dean took the invitation. A groan tore from Castiel's throat. He never imagined that kissing would feel like this. Gabriel had never explained and he wasn't about to ask his grandmother.
His eyebrows furrowed. He looked over his shoulder to his baby bundled up in a basket a few steps away. He wondered which god had favoured his child. He hoped she had fared better.
"So how's little Deidre Dean doing?" Gabriel said in a burst of joviality that no one believed. He strode over to the basket on the table and peeled back the blanket to reveal the baby inside.
The priest shouted from beside Castiel. The priest bent down and whispered into Castiel's ear. "Scream pretty for me, whore."
"What about Kali?" Castiel asked. He knew one day Gabriel and Kali would marry and mate. And on that day Gabriel would leave.
Castiel shook his head. He hugged Deidre tight to his chest.
"I wasn't spying. They were—" Dean cleared his throat and imitated his grandfather. "
Castiel worked fast. If he could just get through brushing Dean's teeth without incident he'd be happy to praise his pet for a job well done even if his pet had sullenly sat there and glared at him the whole time.
Maybe the grass was closer to blue than green and rounder than it should be. And the trees looked more like giant broccoli. And those were definitely not ducks in the pond or squirrels in the trees. But it was the closest thing to Earth Dean had seen in ages.
He got a single curt message back from the other spur. It was enough that Castiel knew he wouldn't be amicable to sex.
"Ah...yes...I...I
Castiel turned onto his side and wrapped his arms around Dean. He tugged him over until Dean was spread over top of him. The sun beat down warm on Dean's back despite he spring chill in the air.
Castiel lazily pushed down. His grandmother coaxed him through it until a wet feeling passed out of him. His grandmother wrapped whatever it was in a cloth and set it aside before placing a cool cloth against his hole.
Then a couple of days ago he had woken up to his master's second tail bandaged up and wrapped around him. Ever since then his master had been happy to pet him with it and give him extra snacks almost every time he begged for them.
Castiel's eyes flicked over to the hallway. He could look into each room and see if Evan was already in one. He could pretend he wasn't there to be a whore.
Castiel's eyes narrowed. Anger coursed through his veins. "Dean
Castiel held back a sigh and made for the door. He came up short in the front room. Gabriel was waiting for him. Gabriel had only been home a few weeks and had barely left Kali's side since then. If Gabriel was here something was wrong.
to spend a day or two with but at this point Castiel would be happy with anyone that wasn't his pet. Another spur wouldn't be much better than masturbating on his own but Castiel couldn't afford to be picky.
"Yes."
"Evan would pay you in coins," Daven said.
He didn't feel like this after Daven. He hadn't even felt like this after Dean. He hadn't known he could feel strung out and exhausted after and that it would feel this good.
Castiel felt the scales on his chest and face darken and rise with embarrassment as he watched.
His grandmother took the cloth away. She grimaced at the brand on his cheek. "It won't heal well."
Castiel felt like Mary Winchester had slapped him. "You want..."
"Castiel, you shouldn't bleed after. It shouldn't hurt," his grandmother said. "Even when you're only doing it for trade, it shouldn't hurt. That's now how it's supposed to be."
His master bumped his back with a claw and pushed him towards his tail. He repeated the command.
human into the foyer.
She wasn't as picky as he feared. She clamped her gums on his breast, hard enough to hurt.
The second tail touching was new. Sometimes his master had used his dagger tail to heft him up or pull him closer but ever since that day Dean had been jerked awake by his master yanking his second tail away from him the second tail had been kept carefully away.
about it when it was all said and done but mostly he just felt empty. It was all rather anticlimactic for nine months of pregnancy and village rumours.
"Don't stop," Castiel pleaded. "Don't stop."
Conflict tore at Castiel's mind. He had been training Dean to do this. This was what he had intended all along. But now that he was faced with the results of his training he wasn't sure he could do it. It was perverted and unsanitary. He needed to come to his senses. He should tell Dean
"Take two." Daven huffed. He pushed himself up. "If you come back next week, come earlier."
. Too different to be a beta even though I look just like them."
He munched away on it while his master pet him and a made those soft noises.
Castiel refrained from laughing bitterly. The pleasant exhaustion faded from his skin. He would have been saved a lot of trouble if omegas couldn't come with their cocks.
He watched his master talk to the purple puffball. His master rubbed his knuckles on the back of Dean's neck then passed his leash off to the big purple puffball behind the desk.
Castiel tugged at Dean's hands, guiding them under his shirt. He swore he could hear the slide of Dean's hands over the fine barely-there hair on his chest. Castiel whimpered. He tugged at his shirt until he had his arms out and the shirt pushed around his neck.
His grandmother let out a growl from deep in her throat. "You know damn well John Winchester isn't an honest man and you know damn well that it wasn't him that got Castiel with child!" His grandmother shouted. "I should curse
Castiel breathed hard. He squeezed his eyes shut. He griped the side of the well. His stomach twisted in pain. He groaned.
"What does Daven pay you?" Evan asked. He slid his thumb out of Castiel's mouth. He stared down at Castiel, appraising.
His pet that trusted him with everything and only ever wanted to please him. And there he was fantasying about what it would feel like if Dean licked at his mating tail.
He honestly didn't know why he was so against getting a pet in the first place. The human was easy to take care of, companionable, and quick to obey. Dean didn't have the same sleep rhythm or eating patterns as him but there was a certain charm in having his pet curl up beside him and nap or get excited about its meals.
Dean bent down and kissed him again. Castiel shivered as those kisses trailed down from his lips to his neck and back up again. He let his eyes slip closed. No on wonder people enjoyed kissing.
He followed Qech into his kitchen and kept his opinions on Qech's bizarre choice in decorations to himself— there was Oueyi baby talk covering his doors and walls. The humans chattered among themselves. Dean was surprisingly exuberant in his chattering. Not that his pet was lethargic on his ship but he had never seen Dean
He jerked his mating tail away from Dean. The human lurched awake. Castiel rolled off the bed. He stared at Dean. Dean stared back at him, confused and startled. Castiel doubted Dean had any idea what he had done. He was just an innocent pet looking for warmth.
Castiel froze in mid scrub. His scales stayed aroused and stuck up. His eyes flicked between his mating tail and Dean's mouth. He shuddered at the memory of Dean's tongue flicking over his hands.
"I'm surprised actually," Castiel said. "Dean doesn't usually take so well to having his hands restrained."
"He'll be fine!" Mary Winchester yelled.
Castiel looked over his shoulder to where the priest had been. He didn't want to ruin Gabriel's good mood by talking about the priest but it would surely ruin Gabriel's mood if the priest led another mob to their home.
"I call her DeeDee." His grandmother added. She handed Hannah a large white basin and told Castiel's sisters to go out and see if the hens had laid any eggs.
His master walked through the door like he belonged there. Dean cringed as he followed beside him and stepped across the threshold. He had managed to swallow his fears about the ship doors chopping him in half but this was just some random alien's house. What if this guy didn't keep everything in as good condition as his master?
His master clicked his claws and hissed then stripped his clothes off. Dean rolled over to the far side of the bed. It had made him nervous the first few times his master had stripped down in the bedroom. He had heard of masters buying pets for
Every passerby at market stared. Castiel pulled the hood of his cloak closer to his face. The coarse fabric brushed against the brand making his cheek burn.
A few more people stopped and watched.
Castiel hurried forward, worried something had happened to the baby. Instead he found himself staring down the priest from across the greenway. He looked furious.
Qech chuffed again and shook the human off his head. The human started babbling out terrible Ipix and flailing its hands. Qech bumped it back towards his legs. The human squeaked with excitement. It rubbed up against Qech's genital slit.
"That's it?" Castiel covered his nose at the smell.
He startled when Dean's lips touched his own again.
"Deep."
His grandmother narrowed her eyes at him. They flicked rapidly back and forth. A little gasp of angry disgust escaped her. "Is he taking you dry?"
It was harmless really. Dean was fed and happy each time ‒ he was still confused about Castiel's mating tail outside of meal time ‒ and he got to enjoy some pleasant time with his pet.
It wasn't
"Why did I have to come to market?" Castiel asked. He stared dejectedly at the crates that made up their table. "It's so cold. What if Deidre gets sick?"
The puffball stopped halfway down the hall. Dean flinched as a door opened in the wall. The puffball unclipped his leash and nudged him through the door.
"Kali's back, I see." His grandmother commented. "Are they finally getting married this year?"
He knew Daven Hills would be one of those people. Up early and baking bread for the day.
"I know, I know. It sounds ridiculous but they really can manage some limited speech. It's not enough for a conversation but they can communicate their base needs," Qech said. He opened the door to his lounge and motioned for Castiel to go through the door first, Qech followed in behind him. "They're much smarter than what we give them credit for."
And he doubted he was even succeeding in training Dean to lick his mating tail. His pet rarely showed much interest in it unless it was time for a meal. A little push against his mating tail proved his point.
Castiel caught his arm and pulled him back. "It's not your fault."
Castiel stiffened and froze. He turned to see Michael Goodson and three other men from the village watching him and laughing. They had seen him walk into the alley with Sam Winchester. Castiel pulled at his hood and turned his branded cheek away from them.
A soft frown appeared on Evan's face, as if he was thinking some deep thought. He rubbed a thumb over each of Castiel's nipples until they were hard numbs. Castiel shivered. He didn't make milk anymore but his nipples were still sensitive.
An hour before he docked at the station he got a message from Uth asking that if he hadn't already bought the fake eggs could he make sure they were edible for Hflips?
He tapped the door.
"Where does he eat lunch?" Castiel asked. He took out the square of cloth he used to wrap up the bread.
"Go on, Dean. Eat." Castiel nudged the bowl with a claw.
Pacing the kitchen wasn't enough either.
"This will help you make more milk." Castiel explained.
When Qech's pets were done eating they carefully stacked their bowls beside the counter then took Dean's hands and pulled him over to play.
"Who are you looking for?" Cepheus asked without looking up from his ledger.
Gabriel grabbed a crate and swept the protection charms into it. "It's time to go." He carried the crate to the cart.
His master tapped his claws along his chest and studied Dean. Dean jumped in surprise when the second tail curled around his leg. His master made the gentlest sound a giant lizard monster could then slowly reached out and scratched a claw through Dean's hair.
Castiel marched along beside it; growing more and more certain with each passing step that blood had leaked through the cloth padding his crotch and into his pants. He was thankful for the cloak. His grandmother said he'd bleed for a few more days but that it would stop soon. Castiel wondered how many pairs of pants he'd ruin until then.
Castiel panted and cried and laughed. His grandmother's deft hands swept over the baby, tied the cord, and cut it. Gabriel covered them up with the softest blanket they had.
Michael shrank back. He gulped. Castiel's grandmother let go of his hand. He pocketed the chain. A tremble went through him. "Please hurry. She's in so much pain."
"That's it?" Castiel watched the herbs curl up black and turn to ash. "That doesn't seem like much."
A deep rumbling growl came through in the jumbled noise his master was listening to. Dean shuddered. The growl drudged up old memories of being snatched off Earth with a bunch of other terrified kids.
Dean huffed. "Sure. Whatever. Just hurry up. I'm hungry."
His grandmother sighed again. "You aren't a beta."
Castiel growled. "I'm a siren and a witch!"
Gabriel shook his head. He took a note out of his pocket and passed it to her. "She doesn't want anything."
"Babes aren't fussy about breasts." His grandmother said. She went back to work, cleaning up and saying spells over the afterbirth.
The humans chorused out a sound that was eerily similar to
He kept at it until he was nodding off between each roll of the ball. He must have fallen asleep eventually because the next thing he knew his master was scooping him up and snuggling him in bed.
Castiel stared and shivered. He was sorry for that too. They'd kept everything hidden from him. They had listened to the priest and told him nothing so he wouldn't be tempted. Now look where he was because he didn't know what a heat was and had never before heard the word slick until Gabriel had shouted it in front of the fireplace.
"We've had some problems with teeth cleaning." Castiel gave Dean a second dental treat. "The cost is worth it. And besides, they're more thorough than I could ever be."
He got another series of hisses that he was pretty sure meant,
His grandmother came back around with a small pouch of sunflower seeds. She dropped a handful into her mouth. She offered some to Castiel. She shoved the pouch at him until he took some.
"Twenty eight."
Guilt rushed through Castiel as he tugged Dean back down to the bed with his mating tail. Dean looked up at him. Castiel waited to see if his actions had upset his pet. Dean chattered at him again but didn't struggle to get away. Instead Dean wrapped an arm around Castiel's leg again and nuzzled into his side.
The priest pointed one fat accusing finger at Castiel's belly. "Then how, pray tell, did this come about?" He turned and leered at the crowd. "Would you have us believe this a miracle?"
Castiel licked his lips nervously.
Castiel grimaced at his bowl of porridge as the aftershocks of pain rippled through him. He hadn't offered an explanation about where the bread was coming from each week and no one had pushed for an answer. They didn't talk about it but he knew his family must know what he was doing at the bakery so early in the morning. He didn't have anything else to trade.
He hated space. He hated ships. He hated flying. He could ignore it if he didn't see it. As long as the gravity worked on a ship he couldn't tell the difference between ground and a flying death trap. But the moment he saw all that black fear flooded through him.
Dean darted forward and wrapped an arm around his master's leg. "Come on, dude. Double rations. You forgot my dinner last night."
He was expecting another unplanned treat for doing absolutely nothing when his master called him over to the bed. But instead of another green cookie his master had a collar waiting for him.
Castiel moved to turn over on his stomach. Evan caught his knee.
His grandmother reached up and pushed the hood back. Castiel turned his face away to hide the brand. His grandmother turned his head back.
know?" Dean asked. His eyes went wide. "Have you? Before?"
She rolled her shoulders and pointed two hands at the display next to the humans. "Maybe a siren is more your speed."
His grandmother made a dismissive motion, as if what the baker asked for was nothing unusual. She eyed him and the careful way he was sitting on his chair. "He didn't hurt you?"
It was evening by the time his grandmother patted his arm and told him she'd done what she could for his face.
The priest called. He jabbed his finger at Castiel's belly. "Speak the truth about your sins!"
Nothing in the ship moved.
"Hey!" Dean yelped. He twisted in his master's lap. "Come on. I didn't mean it."
Castiel watched him for a moment before deciding this meant he should undress too. He wriggled out of his clothes and left them in a heap beside the bed. He sucked two fingers into his mouth then reached around to rub at his hole. He knew how to get himself ready fast. Daven never wanted to wait long.
He tensed, getting ready to stand and follow Hannah and Anna outside, but his grandmother broke the silence.
Castiel's chest ached. If Gabriel married he'd leave home, leave
"No. This way," Evan said. He crawled onto the bed pushing Castiel onto his back. He knelt between Castiel's legs. "I like to do it this way."
Castiel nodded then curled over his stomach as a contraction pulsed inside him. When it was over he shoved his freezing feet under the heavy blanket at the end of the bed. He hadn't felt the cold so much while he'd been in the village square. His anger had warmed him.
''You mean she won't know the village calls her father a whore." Castiel growled. "I'm not a whore." He kicked the loaf of bread towards her. "Or a thief. And I'm certainly not a
"Sorry." Dean curled into his blanket. "Please don't lock me out again."
They were on the lonely road that led up to their home at the edge of the village when Gabriel spoke up.
"Fuck off!"
He rubbed at his face as he ambled down the corridors to the bathroom. He eyed the counter where his master gave him baths while he took a leak. If his master would just let him brush his own damn teeth...
after dinner. His family was clustered around the fireplace, each making a small protection charm they could sell at market.
It didn't open.
Maybe if he was extra cuddly when his master woke up he could get that extra ration tomorrow.
"Did it hurt the first time?" she asked. She nodded towards the village. Towards the
Castiel clenched his jaw. His father had come home without a bride price, packed his things, and left with his name. The Milton home had turned into the Blackdog home once more. His mother was still sure he'd come back.
His grandmother watched the blood drip into the bowl. She nodded when she deemed it enough. She let his hand go. She tossed the contents of the bowl into the fire.
Castiel tensed up with another contraction. He clenched his jaw and waited for it to pass. He huffed and panted when it was over. He looked up to find Gabriel watching him curiously.
Anna stuck her tongue out and took Kali's hand. Hannah took the other one. The two of them dragged Kali off in a whirlwind of whispers and laughter.
"I want it out!" Castiel snarled.
He was carried into his master's bedroom afterwards and deposited onto the bed. He stretched out while he could and wrapped himself up in his blanket. He sighed into the blanket, it smelled like home. Dean's eyes flicked open. He frowned at the ceiling. He didn't want his current master's bedroom to smell like home. He wanted home to be on a planet with a master who had other humans and didn't forget to feed him.
It was gross.
Castiel stared in shock. He couldn't be a midwife. He couldn't—
The words didn't make sense but the rhythm was all Dean needed to hear to understand what he meant.
to have a pet dragon.
Daven tugged at his hair until Castiel lifted his head from his cock. He slid down the cot to make room. He waved at Castiel. "On the cot on your stomach."
Castiel braced himself as Evan reached under him and pressed his fingers along Castiel's hole. Castiel could feel his slick leak out. Evan didn't shove his fingers in.
The door in the kitchen opened and closed. Castiel was surprised that his mother would come back so soon. She had barely wanted anything to do with him since his father left.
Castiel glanced over at the woods. He had gone with his grandmother to collect food from the forest before but never because they needed to. It had always been for variety. Or to agitate his mother when she and his grandmother were fighting.
and took off back the way she came.
He stopped a few feet away, out of reach of that nasty long tail with the dagger on it. It twitched a few times then pointed at a pile of tools further away on the floor. There were a few growls and a click. Dean sighed. He'd figured out that word last week,
Her spines smoothed out. She stepped closer and touched the panel that separated the humans from the rest of the store. "Never had one before?"
"He did," his father growled. "He's a little thief like the rest of his family!" His father snorted in disgust. "Well there's nothing to do for it now." He turned on his heel and strode from the room. He slammed the door shut behind him.
His humans lined up in front of him. He started speaking in Ipix. "
Qech let out a sad sigh. "Ah. That's unfortunate. They do so much better in groups." He pointed his head towards Dean and his pet. "And you get to watch more of their natural behaviours."
Reluctantly, he put Dean's bowl down on the floor and tied Dean off to his pet bed. A well behaved pet was more important than satisfying an urge. He went to his chair and caught up on the local news. Dean whined and chattered at him for a short while but eventually he wrapped himself in his blanket and settled in to eat.
A cold feeling settled into Castiel. His milk had been bringing in enough in traded goods that they weren't always worried about starving. What would they do once Deidre was too old to nurse and his milk dried up?
They circled around to the front of the cart, Castiel did his best to hide the smug smile that wanted onto his face when two children were quickly hushed by their mother for pointing out the whore. He'd nursed their baby sister three days ago.
"Not for a while." His grandmother said. "Dampen a cloth for me."
The bed dipped down. Dean shuffled over so he didn't get kicked by huge clawed feet. He debated on not curling around his master just to show him how much he hated bath time but he was sure lashing out now would just get him punished.
His master slowly eased closer, like he expected Dean to run away and hide. Dean squinted at him as he tried to figure out what exactly his master was doing. His master had spent weeks tying him up and ignoring him when he gave him something to play with but now he was incredibly interested? This was weirder than that time that his master had just stood statue still in the corridor for hours.
"Next time then," Castiel said.
into the village.
The priest glowered at her. He looked between Castiel's grandmother and Adam Winchester. "It seems to me that you're taking misguided vengeance on the Winchesters by beating their youngest."
"You don't have to—" Castiel started but Evan reached for his cock and started stroking. Castiel's back arched up into. Evan didn't relent. He kept stroking Castiel inside and out until he was a desperate writhing mess. It was like that first time with Dean. As if he had to have this. As if he
A light filmy blanket settled over him. His master hissed something long. Dean caught his name at the end of it. Dean turned his head to his master. Two green-yellow eyes stared down at him. There was more hissing. His master tapped Dean's head with one claw and hissed again.
Hannah smiled softly. "They do like to pick on each other." She stepped under the yolk and settled it on her shoulders. "I don't think they could give that up."
‒ that fed him. Well. Fed him most of the time.
tight."
Castiel stroked his pet's head then tapped his claws on his chest again. Another wave of guilt washed through him as a thought occurred to him, Dean was only a pet and didn't understand how people mated but pets could be trained.
"Your pets are very well behaved," Castiel complimented. "Dean's not a problem pet but he has his moments. He can be impossible sometimes."
Michael Goodson drew a long gold chain out of his pocket. "It's all we have."
Castiel nodded. He'd make it worthwhile for the baker. He wasn't sure how but he would.
"Stupid fucking doors," Dean muttered, giving the door the dirtiest look he could muster. The stupid things had been terrifying him since day one.
to masturbate. His mating tail was warm and snug in the sheath, the unfurled opening was safely away from Dean.
"John Winchester is a thief and a liar!" Castiel growled. He placed his hands protectively over his belly as gooseflesh broke out over his skin. "Dean Winchester got me with child and ran off! And now his family is lying and refusing to pay reparations!"
His father jerked back. "
Dean didn't know if his master came from a weird species or if his master was just a weird guy all on his own.
They wouldn't starve
Castiel huffed in amusement. Qech didn't.
when it suited them. Michael Goodson was doing just that in the kitchen. His wife was in labour and they couldn't afford the village's doctor so he'd come to the Blackdogs for a midwife.
The baker looked him up and down before scowling. "I'm closed." He repeated. "And don't think you can come and beg for charity when no one is looking."
want?"
"What?" Castiel looked around the room. His mother was staring at him like he was dangerous. His father was glaring at his mother. His sisters were curling in on themselves like
The crowd shifted and murmured. A flicker of hope flared up in Castiel's chest, warming him against the cold. The crowd
He narrowed it down to two. One with striking red hair and seemed eager to get closer to him and another with tiny spots speckling its skin that was curious though reserved.
Castiel gasped in pain. His legs trembled as he fought to hold himself up.
Dean took the bowl more carefully this time but still licked it clean with gusto. Then without warning he bent forward and licked the paste from Castiel's fingers.
For a moment he debated on being outraged that Qech would presume that the liberal sexual practices of Helodem included zoophilic threesomes but instead decided the best course of action was to bolt from his chair.
Castiel shrugged at the crates.
in his mating tail.
"Put it in water and drink it the morning after the new moon. Your breasts will start to fill up as the moon does." Castiel had taken it himself for months now. It was how he could feed his daughter along with so many others.
"For your baby." His grandmother explained. Michael reached out for it. His grandmother caught his hand in hers. Her fingers clenched tight around him. "If you squander my gift to your child the gods will ruin your house."
Dean followed him to the kitchen, bouncing along excitedly by his side. His excitement was infectious.
Castiel flinched at the sound of his voice. "I'm not‒ I mean‒" Castiel stopped himself and took a breath. "Evan Fawkes. I'm looking for Evan Fawkes."
"How old is it?" Castiel hadn't thought to ask before. What if he was buying a geriatric pet?
Castiel's back arched again when Dean changed positions. He licked up the side of Dean's neck and found that if he worried Dean's ear with his teeth Dean would squirm and gasp.
"Only the finest things." Castiel licked his thumb then wiped at a smudge of dirt on Dean's face. "What were you rolling in?"
The other human put his hand out and wiggled his fingers.
Castiel stared back, confused by his pet's behaviour. Dean flailed his arms and chattered for a few moments before returning to the bed. He stopped in front of Castiel's knees. Castiel tensed as Dean reached out and touched his mating tail. He kept perfectly still, he didn't want to spook Dean from paying attention to him.
His master had left him in a
"Or I guess we can keep doing this," Dean said dryly. He leaned in and licked the other half of the mush up.
She shot an apologetic look at the baker. "He's teething!" She yelled over Adam Winchester's screams. "Sorry!"
"You're just a curious little pet, aren't you?" He scratched Dean's head. "You'd probably just wondered why you'd been banished to the floor if I ever brought mates to bed."
Castiel looked down when he realized the chattering had tapered off. He hummed in pleasure. Dean had fallen asleep, cuddled against his leg. Castiel finished up his project then picked Dean up. It was rare that their sleep schedules lined up but it was always pleasant when they did.
Cepheus tucked his cock back into his pants. He waited for Castiel to stand before offering a glass of water along with his payment.
His master's head tucked down. The green-yellow of his eyes turned more yellow than green. He shifted Dean off the soft spot on his belly then cradled his dagger tail around Dean.
He spent the rest of the day testing the commands he had taught Dean in the morning. Dean happily obeyed and only once brought him the wrong thing. Castiel wasn't too hard on him. He wasn't entirely sure Dean could hear the whole word. Part of it was right at the lower range of human hearing. He modified the command after that and Dean didn't have any more problems with it.
"I'd wager to guess Sam Winchester is an alpha," Gabriel whispered back. "Or, at least, someone accused him of it and the priest decided it was true."

with his pet. He let Dean lick his mating tail and enjoyed the warm buzz of arousal but that was it. He always stopped before his mating tail unfurled. It
He slowly took the brush from Dean's mouth. Dean started chattering at him. Castiel ignored him in favour of tossing the toothbrush aside and turning away. He rolled his shoulders and forced his scales back down. The rush of arousal slowly faded.
"We can," Castiel said simply. He rolled to his side and reached for his clothes on the floor. He slid off the bed and took out the rag he had brought to clean himself up with. He wiped at the come and slick between his legs before moving on to the come on his stomach.
Castiel shook Dean's hands off his mating tail. His pet whimpered at him. Castiel sighed and gave Dean the bowl. His pet stared at up at him in confusion. Dean glanced between the bowl and Castiel's mating tail. He gave Castiel a wary look.
His grandmother shuffled down a ways. She pulled back the blankets and crawled onto the bed. She parted Castiel's legs. Castiel flinched when she stuck her fingers inside him. She tilted her head and thought. "Hours yet."
up at bath time."
"You pig fucking priest!" Gabriel snarled. His hands settled gently onto Castiel's shoulders. "Come on, Cassie. It's over. We need to get you home."
"Getting yourself ready should feel good," his grandmother concluded. She grinned at him. "Good enough to do it without them." She pointed at the bowl. "Work some of that inside yourself. You'll feel better in a day or two."
Castiel tugged the cloak tighter around himself as if it would stop a mob from dragging him away. He knew it was foolish. The cloak wouldn't stop them. They hadn't minded dragging him through the streets when he was pregnant. They would mind even less now.
Castiel tugged his shirt on the rest of the way. He had bread for the week. The hens were laying better now that the days were longer. He'd go with his family to gather plants from the woods later today. They wouldn't starve.
Brianne hesitantly took the packet. She slipped it into a pocket.
Castiel went to the basket and picked it up. He caught up to his grandmother on the path. He followed her inside. She pointed to the table. He sat down, the empty feeling didn't go away.
Qech looked up to find Castiel staring. He rumbled out several deeps chuffs at him. "I thought Helodem weren't squeamish about sex?" He cast a significant look down at the blue stains on Castiel's arms and then towards the kitchen where Dean had last been. "Any sex it would seem."
The priest stared at her aghast. "You would threaten to curse a
In the morning Castiel fed Dean with his mating tail again. This time he didn't let himself linger on his doubts. It was just a bit of external stimulation. He probably got more stimulation to his mating tail from his day to day work routine than he did from his pet. It wasn't as if he was going to have
Castiel did his best to keep his demeanour blandly pleasant. From the messages they had exchanged in the last day he knew well enough that Qech was a
He filled Dean's bowl as he usually did and was halfway to his chair with his pet in tow when he stopped. Dean was being excessively clingy. Would he only be encouraging Dean to continue the behaviour if he kept training him at meal times?
"So...?" Dean motioned between them. He kissed at the edge of Castiel's mouth.
It took Dean three days to realize the ship hadn't been damaged. He had been punished for snubbing his master.
"Lick."
His master rolled a ball the size of Dean's head around in his clawed hands. It was some kind of transport sized sanitizer unit. Dean had seen them before with other masters but none of his previous masters had been big enough to just carry one around like a toy.
He reached the corner. Daven told him to strip. Castiel pulled his things off and set them aside in a heap. When he was done he looked up to find the baker equally naked and sitting on the edge of the cot.
He flinched in a surprise when Evan reached out and cupped Castiel's jaw. Castiel stared up at him as Evan tilted his head this way and that. Evan paused to rub his thumb over Castiel's bottom lip. He pressed his thumb between Castiel's lips. Castiel slowly took it into his mouth.
"How'd they...?" Dean asked, embarrassed but curious.
human.
He tossed and turned for an hour before grumbling in frustration and giving up. He got up, washed, dressed, and went back to pacing the kitchen.
He glanced over at Dean.
His master fed him half the bowl like that before giving the bowl back to Dean and dropping him down on the floor with a
He was two feet from the corridor that led to his master's bedroom when the bulkhead door slammed shut in his face.
Dean stuck just about anything in his mouth and rolled around on the floor, that wasn't something to get aroused about.
Dean buried his face in his master's hard chest and waited for those huge dragon-teeth to bite into him.
"By his own admission he's guilty!" The priest called out.
"Come here, siren!" One of the men shouted at him. "I wouldn't mind a bounce in my step either!"
Castiel tucked his bundle of bread under his arm. "Is he expecting me?"
Castiel nodded, still too shocked to speak.
"Did you meet any alphas coming home?" his father asked.
Castiel took half a step forward then stopped. He was an omega - a siren whore - alone with someone in an alley. He knew terrible things happened to women who went into allies alone with men. He wasn't a woman but he was an omega. And Sam Winchester wasn't a man yet but he wasn't a boy either. Castiel looked over his shoulder. People were watching curiously. Castiel wondered if any of them would help if Sam tried to accost him.
He woke to little ceremony when Dean shoved off him.
He laid in a sweaty heap, come and slick drying on his hands, and tried to nap. If he slept through his heat maybe it wouldn't be so bad.
Dean grinned at him. He nodded. He dropped his hand down to give Castiel's cock a few affectionate tugs before kissing him again and springing to his feet.
weeks to do this again."
The employee let out a single sharp click. "There's no accounting for taste." She pushed the panel open and motioned for Castiel to go in. "It comes to Dean, although it's not the most trustful of strangers but it warms up to people quickly."
Castiel reached up and framed his face with his hands. He let Dean push his tongue into his mouth and explore. He sighed when Dean pulled back.
Dean grumbled about it but his master carried him to the bathroom anyway.
He stuffed the last of his toast into his mouth and started clearing the table.
care than a human. Sirens were used to long periods of time in solitude. He wouldn't have to pay attention to it if he didn't feel like it. And it would be more than capable of being taught to feed itself. It was the perfect pet for him— if he was staying on planet and had unlimited access to water.
"You aren't the first Blackdog to get that brand and I doubt you'll be the last." His grandmother told him. "My great aunt had one and so did three of my cousins." She pat his arm again. She looked to Gabriel. "I'm going to take a nap. Wake me when it's time." She shuffled out of the bedroom.
He dug into his breakfast. Which was the same mush as his dinner and snacks but breakfast was flavoured with something sweet. Out of all the weird stuff his masters had fed him over the years it was as close to a favourite as he had come.
There was always rumours that Cepheus would let
my daughter." Castiel said flatly.
Dean's hips slammed forward, he groaned. Castiel screamed as his body lit up like a lightning strike and his cock pulsed come across his chest.
"Cas," Dean whimpered. His hips started jerking forward. "Cas. Cas. I'm gonna...my dick is...I'm gonna..."
In fact, from now on he'd do all his resupply remotely. His therapist would hate him for but if it meant never—
Dean looked between his master and the ball. He had, had masters in the past that would try to trick him into misbehaving to prove a point but this master was usually straight forward, if a little weird. He didn't think he'd purposely set him up to be punished.
Castiel backed up, as if he expected a mob to burst through the door at the mere mention of the priest.
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry." Dean chanted. "You're the greatest master I've ever had. Really. Please don't let it eat me."
Castiel shrugged. "People aren't always wrong."
Castiel said he'd consider it.
his daughter a great deal more when she wasn't splattering food everywhere and throwing up on him. Or pulling his hair out.
He counted off seventeen steps and tapped the wall. Nothing happened. He backed up a few steps and tapped again. Still nothing. He went ahead a few steps and tried there but nothing opened.
His bladed tail twitched in disgust. What if Dean fondling his mating tail was just the beginning? What if Dean was entering a breeding phase and would only become more sexually aggressive as time went on?
"Here's your ball-stick thing," Dean said.
Castiel licked his lips nervously. He tugged at the strings of his shirt and let out one of his small breasts. He brought the baby up to his chest.
Hannah looked between their grandmother and the priest. A smile ghosted across her lips. "Possibly, sir." She held up the letter opener. "Did you perhaps forget selling him this?"
"We aren't trying to steal from you." Sam said. He started down the alley towards his mother. "She just wants to talk."
"They just can't make the sounds or thoughts to speak." Qech curled his hulking form onto a large pillow in the corner and motioned for Castiel to choose a chair that fit his own shape. "That's why they use their hands mostly. They're visual speakers."
When he woke the next morning he didn't feel any better for having snubbed his master. He was cold and achy from sleeping on the couch instead of in his master's warm bed. He should have known better. He had been just as achy that time his master had banished him to the couch for a week.
Castiel grabbed onto Evan's arms. He tried to answer but all that came out was a gasp.
Castiel touched his lips. He looked at Dean. The silence stretched between them. Dean's face began turning his own shade of red.
He picked his pet up, intent on carrying it through the door, but it squirmed to be put down. Castiel dropped it to its feet. It huffed indignantly at him then slowly approached the door.
"We got everything, grandma." Hannah informed her. She moved her cloak aside to show her satchel bulging full.
It took him a few minutes to gather up the courage to try to go through the giant guillotine that some alien genius thought would be a great ship feature.
His master turned around and picked him up. He settled Dean on his hip. Dean wrapped his arms around his master and shook. His master trailed a claw through Dean's hair and started hissing and growling right along with the dragon.
Dean rolled out of the bed and went to the door. He looked at Castiel expectantly and fidgeted on the spot. Castiel hit the button to open the bedroom door. Instead of his pet racing for the bathroom to relieve himself Dean stood at the threshold and stared at him.
Castiel looked up at him from his seat on the bed. A nervous feeling settled into his stomach. He wasn't sure what to do. Daven Hills told him what to do. Evan Fawkes was just looking at him. Was he supposed to do something? Was he supposed to say something? To wait? To go? Did Evan Fawkes even want him today?
After dinner Dean found his way back to the bedroom and curled up for the night.
Castiel cocked his head to the side. "No. Why?"
"Gran's waiting for you." Gabriel said. He pulled one of Castiel's arms over his shoulder. "She's got your bed ready. She was dead set your baby was coming today."
At the last turn before the door to the cargo hold Dean started counting his steps. The door was about seventeen steps from the turn. He had tried making marks on the walls to show where the doors were but nothing ever stayed. The marks were always gone in a couple of hours.
Castiel could feel the little puffs of air Dean was huffing out in nervous excitement. Castiel's skin prickled. He shivered as a curious feeling sparked up around his nipples and something fiery pooled between his legs. He tensed when he felt his cock starting to fill. He gasped softly when he felt Dean's cock against his stomach.
He backtracked to the bathroom then started for his master's bedroom. He had been sure the two corridors led to the same place but apparently not.
"Witch!" The priest sneered.
Gabriel smiled. "If she's anything like—"
No one spoke English. The most common language in the group was badly human-accented Ipix, which meant they could really only point and say a handful of half-words that were mostly nonsense. But touch didn't need words.
He read over one profile of a Narsiaan trio a few times, debating on whether he was desperate enough to have sex that he'd agree to being hit with half a dozen love darts from each of them. He quickly decided that while he was desperate he wasn't so desperate that he'd risk a hospital visit for sex. Negotiating sex outside of species was always an interesting task to say the least.
"Hmm, no plan," Castiel sighed. "Today has just been perfect."
His grandmother snorted. "I didn't ask to be old."
"Deidre." His grandmother said. She eyed him suspiciously.
His grandmother stepped in front of him with the baby. She passed the baby to him. "Nurse her for a bit. Rachel needs to rest a moment." Castiel frowned down at the baby in his arms. His grandmother prodded him. "Go on."
"I‒ I've seen..." Dean dropped his eyes back down to Castiel's chest. He rubbed at his neck nervously. "I've seen animals before but...it's different for people." He glanced back up to Castiel's face. "Right?"
They sighed. Castiel felt himself drop off; wrapped around Dean with Dean buried inside him. He would have been content to stay that way forever.
"Wait!" Mary Winchester called out. She thrust the purse towards him. "Wait! I want to talk about your bride price."
"Now what?" Dean asked. He glanced down at Castiel's cock standing up from a thatch of dark hair. "...when animals do it they...they
Castiel took the rag and wiped the come and slick from his thighs. There wasn't any blood. There hadn't been since his grandmother had told him how to do it right.
Sam held it out further, offering it to Castiel. "He's over charging your family, you know?"
He was a very entertaining pet if he said so himself.
An exuberant thrill went through Dean. Was he going to get to go back to the park again?
Castiel flicked his tail in acknowledgement. It seemed backwards but then, humans had evolved on an unusual planet.
Castiel sighed. He knew it was overdoing it. Dean had gotten his reward. But when Dean started chattering away and nuzzling his leg like that it was hard to say no.
Castiel turned his head to find Gabriel sitting on the other bed.
His master carried him to the bedroom after and set him down on the bed. Dean gave him a pointed look, took his blanket, and went to the kitchen to sleep on his couch.
"No. Nothing actually," Castiel said. "And I'm leaving the planet shortly. That won't be a problem?"
Castiel froze in the doorway to the kitchen. He had found Dean. And he was busy slobbering his mouth all over one of the other human's genitals.
Castiel's grandmother leaned close and whispered, "He's worried but everyone screams like they're being gutted."
"I think you deserve a treat." Castiel pet Dean's back. Dean chattered at him excitedly. Castiel snorted in amusement. Dean had learned the word
"What are you doing bringing the
Gabriel peeled her hand from Adam Winchester's coat and shoved him towards the priest. "I think one of your flock is lost. Why don't you see him to his parents?"
he spat. "What did he do to you?"
Castiel gave Dean two more dental treats and let him join the other humans.
It was late into the night before his grandmother declared it time. Castiel was sure it had been time hours ago. He was dripping sweat, the bed was soaked, and the pain was joined with anger.
"No." Mary repeated. She held up the purse again. "But we know your family is on hard times. Your bride price could help with that."
He hated having a heat. He hated what he was. He wished he was a beta like everyone else in the village.
"Kali!" Castiel said, surprised. "Gabriel didn't mention you were back."
He stripped down and got into bed. He pushed Dean aside so he could stretch out. Dean grumbled about being moved then wrapped himself around one of Castiel's legs.
The shock of the delicate soft tongue flicking over Castiel's skin was enough to make him freeze at first but once he realized that Dean was putting his
Castiel's mother took one look at Castiel and hurried the girls out of the house. His grandmother grabbed his other arm and helped Gabriel haul him to his room.
sex. And it didn't harm Dean to do it. If anything he'd say Dean seemed to
"I- I was-" Castiel's face flushed as red as Dean's had been earlier. "I was with Dean today."
He looked at the purse; his bride price. If he had it the village would know that the Winchesters had admitted what they had done. Everyone would know that they'd lied. Everyone would know that Dean had run off instead of being mated. They'd know he wasn't a whore, that he hadn't bewitched and seduced John Winchester. He felt cold and sick. He turned icy eyes on Mary. The Winchesters didn't care about him. This wasn't an apology. This wasn't Mary Winchester admitting they were liars.
"Got it!" Gabriel bounded back into the room carrying a basket. He set the basket down. He looked between Castiel and his grandmother. "So when do the celebrations start?"
Evan laughed and shuffled closer. He leaned over Castiel. He reached between them and guided his cock in.
"Guess you weren't lying after all. Looks like that Winchester boy's little omega cock wasn't big enough to take your purity." Daven said. He grabbed a rag and cleaned his cock off then started pulling on his clothes. "Hurry up and get dressed, I want you out of here long before I open."
"I fed Dean before we left," Castiel said. He reached into a pocket on his coveralls to pull out a small package of dental treats. "But I have some treats for him to snack on."f
"Oh god. I hope so," Dean muttered. He wouldn't have to get back onto that horrible ship. Maybe someone who lived on a planet would buy him next.
His father sucked in a deep breath. "I told you!" his father burst out at his mother. "I told you the priest was an idiot!"
bleeding three days later. All because no one in the village had deigned to tell him what he was but now - now that he was exhausted and ruined - everyone was glad to do it.
"Don't be greedy," Castiel scolded. Dean whined at him and dropped his gaze down as if Castiel was about to punish him. Castiel sighed and gave his pampered pet the bowl.
Or give him another reason to lock him out of the bedroom all alone.
"I'm always willing to trade." The baker said. His eyes raked up and down Castiel. He leered. "I heard sirens get wet like women."
His grandmother sighed. "If you stay angry forever, my sweet omega boy, you'll burn up faster than a hay fire."
"What're you doing?" Castiel asked. His mother had never allowed any of her children to do spell work unless it was making charms for the market.
Gabriel had been close to fighting the priest over it but Kali's family had suggested he come with them and find a more willing priest in the city. Gabriel was torn. He wanted more than a simple mating bite but he wanted his family to be at the marriage ceremony.
Evan brought his hand up and stared at the slick on his fingers. "You oiled yourself already?"
"The priest saw me feeding one of Brianne Shields babies." Castiel admitted. "He looked angry but he didn't come over."
try to use his pet like that. It wasn't fair to his pet. He had been a terrible pet owner for training Dean for it in the first place.
"But sometimes they
The villagers needed a butcher, and very occasionally a midwife, but they didn't need a witch. Castiel had learned the lesson quickly after packing up from market day twice having sold nothing.
Dean drew back. He looked Castiel over. He trembled. "...do you...do you want to do it?" He flushed red again. "Have sex?"
Castiel breathed deep and let out a long guilty hiss. It felt
He was still twelve days out from his next stop and he was spending it torturing himself with pent up sexual frustration. His pet's delicate licks and a barely satisfying warming sheath were poor substitutes for partners.
Dean's eyes flicked back and forth between Castiel and his mating tail. He chattered at Castiel again, this time sounding mildly upset. But his lips brushed against the tip of Castiel's mating tail making Castiel shiver as the scales on his back lifted higher with arousal.
His master snorted at him. Two long claws lifted the blanket off him. Dean looked up and had never been happier to see a giant lizard monster in his life. He scrambled to his feet and flung his arms around his master's legs.
A quick flicker across the room made him turn his head. Dean's heart started pounding. His master had turned on an outside view.
"Some people are sad after." His grandmother said. She'd told him he might be and that there wasn't much to be done for it but get on with life. "And you have more reason to be sad than most."
He had watched his master stand stock still for two hours once. They had been walking along the corridor when his master had just stopped dead. No matter what Dean had done to get his attention his master hadn't budged. He had freaked out a bit about the prospect of being trapped on a ship in the middle of space but then his master had sprung back to life and wandered down a different corridor like nothing had happened.
"Yeah. Really funny." Dean muttered, fake smile on his face. "Love it when dumb giant lizard monsters just grab me and haul me off without warning."
The door to the bakery opened. Mary Winchester came in with her son Adam clutching at her skirts and her son Sam at her side.
that was hissing and growling in the foyer.
Evan let go of Castiel's cock in favour of shoving his hands under Castiel's ass. He yanked him up as he thrust in. Castiel's eyes went wide. His back arched as he moaned. Come splattered across Castiel's stomach. Evan grunted out a pleased noise and kept thrusting into him at a frantic pace.
Castiel sighed. From the research he'd done he knew a siren
Dean stared at his nakedness. Castiel did the same. Castiel sucked in a sharp breath as his eyes swept up and down Dean. Dean was perfect. Today was perfect.
stay in the Silver Head if they paid him well enough.
Castiel squeezed his eyes shut and let the next contraction pass. He was exhausted. He didn't know how his mother had done this three times.
He cast a wider net, opening up the personal ads from any species he thought
He fought the urge to cover himself; his cock hanging below his belly and the small puffy breasts he'd grown. His nipples prickled and hardened in the cold.
Castiel pushed away from the table with a frustrated growl. He stalked into his bedroom and snatched up the wooden cock.
"And lured our dear honourable neighbour John Winchester into his clutches." The priest declared as if the entire village hadn't been whispering about it for months.
Brianne stared at the packet. She shook her head. "I don't have anything more to trade."
Castiel stared at the message. The idea of
Castiel didn't think Dean's face could get any redder but Dean proved him wrong. Castiel worried he might catch fire.
Cepheus nodded. He picked up a ledger from the side table and went back to work.
His grandmother's shuffling step stopped outside his door. She knocked. She poked her head in. She shuffled in and closed the door. She made her slow way across the room and sat on the bed.
his heat. He pushed himself to his feet and went to his bedroom.
Castiel backtracked. He didn't want to offend his host. He already couldn't go back to the pet kennel after the fiasco with the receptionist. He needed to let his pet socialize as long as possible if he didn't want him underfoot every waking hour to the next stop.
When Dean woke up and started begging to be fed there was no indication that he remembered in the slightest what had happened. Castiel made sure to keep his mating tail wrapped around himself just in case but after a few days it was apparent Dean didn't care about his mating tail.
were in trouble. His grandmother was staring at him with sad pitying eyes.
Dean caught the drift that he definitely wasn't going to be eaten and that Qech was the dragon.
"You do a lot of travelling I take it?" the employee asked. "Global or deep?"
His grandmother stroked his hair back from his eyes. "I'm sorry, my beautiful omega boy. I'm sorry I let your mother and father raise you."
Dean leaned forward. He felt his master tense underneath him before saying the command again. Dean carefully licked half the mush from his master's tail. He felt his master tense up even more.
He understood now why people bragged about their pets even if he was loathed to admit it. Although he hadn't sunk so far as to be taking pictures of Dean and sharing them with strangers.
Castiel squinted at the description. He had read up quickly on the more mainstream sex acts Hflips practiced. Most of it was simple enough; pressing genital patches against each other and secreting different mating fluids to prompt self-fertilization or impregnation. What Uth was asking for didn't seem too outlandish based on that, though Castiel didn't know why they were so focused on his arms. Hflips didn't have anything remotely similar to an arm so Castiel doubted Uth actually found his arms attractive.
"I didn't!" Castiel snapped. He shifted from one foot to the other. The cold stone underfoot was freezing.
Dean's face rippled with confusion. He looked between Castiel and his mating tail. He chattered, clearly confused by the lack of food being presented.
"It always hurts," Castiel muttered to his breakfast.
His master passed him a bowl with the same amount he always got. Dean sighed but took it. He'd have to get better at reminding his master to feed him. He knew they weren't on the same day-night cycle for sleeping and from what he could tell they weren't on a similar feeding pattern either. He'd only seen his master eat a handful of times.
"Are you looking at buying today?" the employee asked.
His grandmother puttered around the kitchen, filling a brass bowl with this and that. She made a throaty noise when she was satisfied. She motioned for Castiel to follow her to the hearth.
That was probably for the best. He wouldn't be burdened with a pet for most of his life if he didn't want it.
His master went on absently stroking him.
Gabriel took a white cloth and dipped it into a stoneware jar full of water. He handed it over.
Castiel flinched. He shook his head. "No."
"That one." Castiel pointed to the red haired one.
Mary Winchester's chest heaved in anger. "How could you do this to a baby? Don't you want her to grow up with her family?"
Dean went red again. "They do it?
Dean glanced at Castiel's mating tail again. Castiel snorted with gentle amusement. He was right. He'd succeeded in training Dean in associating his mating tail with being fed and not much else. He scratched Dean's head and wrapped his mating tail around his pet's chest. Dean smiled at him and started eating.
"Hannah, turn his pockets." His grandmother commanded.
Castiel's grandmother tugged at his sleeve. She led him up a flight of stairs as if she knew where she was going.
Castiel balked. It was just an infant still. He wasn't sure what was worse. An old pet or a too young pet.
Two days later Castiel decided to move the pet bed back to the kitchen. He had just been over-reacting to an innocent mishap. He had a spoiled little pet that liked to cuddle and nothing more.
"Grandma?" Castiel asked lightly. "What was your great aunt's name?"
She shooed them out the door then turned to Gabriel. "So? What does she want?"
priests.
It was one thing to have someone manhandle him through a bath but something about his master brushing his teeth for him really dug under his skin. He'd never had a master who had thought he was this useless before.
Dean bucked his hips against Castiel frantically. Castiel tangled his fingers into Dean's hair and drove his tongue into Dean's mouth. Dean groaned. Castiel wrapped his legs around Dean the way he'd seen Kali do it.
Dean let out a sob. He
Dean sat up and looked down at Castiel's mating tail. He chattered and trailed his fingers along where the warming sheath ended.
Dean's hand shoved between them. He grabbed Castiel's cock and stroked it like it was his own. "Cas. Cas. I'm gonna... It's gonna be in...
"We're aware." Castiel said. Sam pushed the bread into his chest. Castiel hesitantly brought his hands up. His fingers curled around it. If they had this and the other loaf they might not need to dip into their savings again this week.
Castiel stepped in. The human stepped back and eyed Castiel's bladed tail warily. Castiel wrapped his bladed tail around his leg and crouched down to the human's level.
The store employee bustled back over when she saw that he was trying to decide.
Castiel glanced out the back door. It would be hours before it was noon. He'd have time to go home, drop off the bread, then walk to the Silver Head.
Dean huffed a soft laugh against Castiel's neck. "Me too." He nuzzled his nose against Castiel's neck. "Did you have this all planned? Take me up the mountain and sweet talk me into giving up our virginity together? Dean, you're a hairy monster, now kiss me."
He chattered at Castiel in a rhythm and tone Castiel had come to think of as Dean being pleased with himself.
"Beating?" His grandmother scoffed. "Do you see a mark on him?"
Castiel waited for her to finish up with some elderly wisdom. His grandmother sat quietly beside him and watched the people walk by. She hopped down when someone stopped to buy a charm then puttered around their cart, organizing things for the walk home.
Dean squirmed in his master's arms. The blue stuff staining his master's arms was sticky and smelt like tomatoes. At least, Dean thought it was tomatoes. He hadn't smelt tomatoes since before he'd been grabbed off Earth.
She had pushed him into his room after and left him with the box. He had opened it to find a polished wooden cock. He had stared at it at first, not sure what to do, then his body had flushed with desire and it had all become so very clear.
"What's going on?" Castiel whispered. His mind refused to put it together. There hadn't been any alphas in the village in decades and there had never been any
He knew it was a terrible idea. Going out during his heat was why he had a brand on his face. And his heat was the only time he could get pregnant. They couldn't afford another mouth to feed because he was being rash.
"Did my mother do this for me?" Castiel asked.
Castiel's brow furrowed. A rank smell came ahead of the mob.
"Just don't slice me open again," Dean complained.
Castiel watched his grandmother hop out of her chair and start gathering things. She pointed to Castiel then pointed to a basket. Castiel rose at the silent command. He got the basket and followed his grandmother around the house as she tossed medicines, charms, and supplies into the basket.
Terror shot through Castiel. What did he say? What if Daven had been lying? He squared his shoulders and tried to look confident. "Daven said you might have some coins for me."
Castiel studied the baby talk on the door. He had thought that Qech simply had a very unusual taste in decoration but apparently it was for his
His pet yawned and sleepily chattered at him. He pulled his blanket tighter around himself and snuggled himself against Castiel's leg. Castiel snorted gently at the innocence of his pet then went back to the warming sheath. His bladed tail twitched when his pet's small hand reached over his leg and touched the warming sheath.
His grandmother tapped the fingers of her free hand on the table, her other arm occupied with holding a squirming Deidre on her lap. She watched him drag his spoon through his porridge and eat the occasional bite.
The angry red flush left his grandmother's face. She shook her head and cursed at herself. She sighed sadly.
His master stared down at him with his creepy yellow-green eyes. He carefully balanced the bowl in the palm of his hand. It looked like minuscule surrounded by his master's claws.
"Nothing to worry about." His grandmother said. She smiled faintly. Whatever it was it had to have been cruel. "She left. She isn't coming back."
He found a personal ad from a Hflip. They weren't particularly attractive by his own people's standards ‒ far too much fur to overlook and too many oddly shaped eyes ‒ but from what he read he was sure they could give each other what they wanted.
Gabriel slowly dragged his eyes from the sack. He nodded at the lump on Castiel's chest and smiled. "Is she enjoying her first adventure?"
They had called him a whore and liar. The Winchesters didn't care about him. Mary Winchester wanted something. He just couldn't understand what it was. They didn't care about his silence. No one blamed John Winchester for what had happened. They didn't care about their reputation. No one believed a lying whore.
Castiel followed behind it and waited, letting it get acquainted with the door. When it had decided the door wasn't a danger it came back to his side and waited patiently.
Gabriel flinched and turned red. Castiel had never seen him look embarrassed before. He kicked at the ground and ducked his head.
"She's been quiet." Castiel said. He pulled the hood of his cloak back up and wrapped it more tightly around him until he was covered nearly head to toe.
"Uh huh," Castiel moaned. He shoved his hips down. Dean's cock slid in the rest of the way. Castiel's back arched again. "Dean. Please?"
"I know where it is," Castiel said, taking two loaves of bread and wrapping them up.
"Twice. They thought I was asleep," Castiel said. He had woken up to soft grunts coming from the other bed and had watched in fascination for the briefest moment before tucking his head back under the covers in embarrassment. It was
"What do you have?" His grandmother asked.
"They're freckles, Cas," Dean teased. "They don't come off."
Dean wondered if he had accidentally alerted his master to a tumour or something in his second tail like those stories about dogs back on Earth. The thought made him laugh every time. He was happy to let his master think he had intentionally saved his life if it meant getting fed on time.
He carried Dean to his bedroom and placed him at the bottom of the bed. Dean snuffled, half-awake, and reached for his blanket.
"Dental treats? Those can get expensive," Qech said. He rattled the spines of his tail to call his pets over.
in Ipix. Qech chuffed happily and gave out the bowls. The humans politely took them chorused something that sounded a little like
The crowd murmured. Castiel watched a space suddenly appear around the Winchesters. The crowd was fickle.
His grandmother disappeared down the hall with Deidre and came back a few moments later with a clean shirt.
"Dean, lick," Castiel commanded.
it. "Stop!"
The new human smiled broadly at him. "Welcome. Thank you. How is blue?"
The crowd murmured in agreement. Castiel felt that hope snuff out. The crowd had turned against him again. He shivered, it had little to do with the early winter. The skin of his stomach crawled.
Castiel stared at the purse, bulging with coins. How much money was in that purse? His eyes flicked up to Mary Winchester. "It would." He admitted. "What do you want for it?"
He shuddered. What if it had bitten him? Through taking care of Dean's basic needs he knew human saliva wasn't inherently dangerous but Dean had bitten him once by accident and the bite had swollen up for hours after.
"No more," Castiel said firmly.
be more what he'd want. They were from the same planets humans came from so they were hardy. They were a great deal more affectionate than a human but needed a great deal
Despite his worries the human followed easily. It looked this way and that as they walked through the city but it didn't pull at the leash or make a trouble. It seemed he had lucked out and bought a well behaved human.
Then a tiny human head popped up from between the dragon's legs.
The priest glowered at them again, haughty and red faced. He took Adam Winchester's hand and dragged him through the small crowd they'd drawn.
"Yeah. I'm awesome," Dean said sarcastically. He reached over and wrapped an arm around his master's leg. He got fed faster if he was affectionate back. "As thrilling as the ball-stick thing is maybe it's time for breakfast?"
Castiel's eyebrows furrowed. Of course it was their house. It was the Goodson house and Michael Goodson lived there.
He had Dean in his lap and the bowl in his hand when he hesitated. Why was he still doing this? Dean was a pet. And he was training him to lick his mating tail. Revulsion rippled through him as he realized just how disgusting it really was. He was putting his mating tail in pet food and then letting his pet put its saliva all over him. When he put it that way he wasn't sure what he was more disgusted by. His pet's mouth? Or the pet food?
"God's tits, Cassie!" Gabriel spluttered. "You walked home covered in slick!?"
"Every time?"
Mary Winchester put him off again. The baker huffed in anger. He came around the counter and picked Adam Winchester up. Castiel watched out of the corner of his eye as the remaining loaf of bread on the counter disappeared into Sam Winchester's jacket.
Castiel stopped in the arch way. His family was staring at him. He stared back in confusion. He looked down at himself. His face turned red. His pants were soaked—
Evan chuckled smugly and thrust in harder and faster.
The kitchen door opened and slammed. The house shook. Castiel jumped. He drew his knees to his chest and buried his face in his arms. He didn't know what just happened but he knew he was in more trouble than he'd ever been in his life.
Castiel hummed in surprise. Everything he had heard about humans said they were brazenly confident, almost to the point of self-destruction. That was why they were better companions for space. They didn't comprehend the dangers like some pets did.
"It's not supposed to." Castiel panted. He doubled over his stomach again. He groaned until the contraction passed. He gasped when it was over. "How long? How long before it comes?"
"And how do
He picked Dean up the next night and put him in his bed. He left the pet bed in the bedroom in case Dean acted up.
He couldn't spite a child.
Castiel paused; shirt half on. Evan was Kervin Fawkes' brother. Kervin was always more than happy to sneer sinner and siren and whore at him but he only ever saw Evan in passing.
"It picked a wonderful day." Castiel laughed coldly. He staggered along beside Gabriel - naked, in pain, and shivering - until they reached their little home on the edge of the village.
His grandmother gave a low hum, encouraging him to continue.
"We didn't sell anything again." Castiel said as they carted their things home.
"What happened?" his grandmother asked.
"You're not going to come back nine months later and demand a bride price and a mating bite?" Daven asked him.
His master pushed his tail into Dean's face and repeated the command.
"You'll come." His grandmother said. She took her cloak from a peg on the wall. "An omega is just as good of a midwife as a beta woman. It's time you learned about labour from the other side."
"Here, Dean." Castiel tapped a claw against the floor.
"What the hell..." Dean stared at the dragon. Maybe it wasn't going to eat him after all if it let a kid just climb all over its legs.
"Good pet," Castiel praised. He rubbed his knuckles under its jaw. It hummed with pleasure and leaned against him. "Good Dean."
Anna grinned and cackled. "Another one?"
Castiel sat up and winced. Daven tossed the used rag at into his lap. Castiel took it and wiped the come from his hole with shaking hands. The rag came back bloody. Castiel trembled and tossed the rag to the floor. He knew some women bled after having sex the first time. He didn't know if omegas did and he didn't know if it happened again the second time.
Adam Winchester took three steps in, sat down, and started to wail and cry. Mary Winchester dropped to her knees and started trying to sooth him.
His master snorted and pet him then went to the counter again. Dean slid off the chair and followed him over. He kept his head down, careful not to look at the emptiness on the far wall.
"He's just a little cranky today!" Mary yelled back.
Castiel tapped his claws on his chest. Dean was a
Castiel gave her an icy look. "Oh?" He sat up straighter. "Why don't you enlighten me, Mary? Who
He flinched when the first huge wipe glided down his legs. The cold cloth made goosebumps rise up on his legs. He cracked an eye open. "What do you do? Keep them in the freezer?"
Mary Winchester took a step back. "No." She clutched the purse close to her chest. "No, I want you take the bride price and I'll take my granddaughter home. She won't grow up in the middle of all this...nasty business. She won't have to know anything about it."
Castiel brushed his thumb along Dean's cheek. His heart fluttered. He didn't want today to end. It wasn't anything special - he and Dean had spent most of it lazing around on the mountainside - but it was perfect. The rush of the breeze over the spring grass, the sun warming his skin, the blue sky dotted with clouds, and the smell of spring and Dean filling his nose.
Warnings for: branding, public humiliation, mpreg, birth scene, and postpartum depression.
Castiel glared at her but slumped down to the bed. He ignored the probe of her fingers around the rim of his stretched hole. Two contractions passed before she was yelling at him to push again.
It didn't hurt anymore either. Now it was simply a few uncomfortable minutes where he rocked his hips back because Daven Hills liked when he did that. It guaranteed him two loaves of bread instead of one.
Anna bounded ahead, leaving Castiel alone with his worries.
He went back to the bedroom to find Dean where he left him. He stared down at his human and tried to think of a way to train him not to touch his mating tail. He came up with a blank. Dean had never shown interest in touching his mating tail before and unless Dean started showing an interest in it Castiel wasn't sure how to train him to not touch it.
Another couple of hisses and claw clicks caught his attention.
could speak?
Dean gave the disk between his master's claws a sniff. It smelt like it was probably food. He gave it a quick lick before taking it from his master. He groaned. It
One of Qech's humans wandered in as he thought it over. He watched the human scurry over to Qech and make itself at home, pressed up against a pair of Qech's legs.
Castiel snorted in amusement. His grandmother and Gabriel fought from time to time but more often than not it turned into affectionate teasing.
"What's wrong?" Castiel asked. Dread filled him. "Is everyone alright?"
His pet seemed to forgive him for the horror of only getting two treats after it had a nap and another meal.
loaves of bread. He could have said anything he wanted. Gods, how had he thought he was anything but stupid and naïve?
His master brought his tail closer to Dean's face. He said the command again. Dean figured it probably meant
"What?" Castiel asked. He glanced between the sack and Gabriel.
He pulled his pants on and glanced up. Daven was staring at him. Castiel did the buttons of his fly up and reached for his shirt. "I won't be long."
Castiel buried his face in his hands and cried. His grandmother sat down on the bed beside him. She eased Deidre Dean from his arms. She bundled her up and cradled her in her lap. She reached out and stroked Castiel's hair.
Castiel tugged at the hem of Dean's shirt. "No clothes."
"You didn't mean it." Gabriel said. "You didn't mean to actually curse the priest. And Castiel didn't mean he wanted to curse the village either." Gabriel wiped sweat from his forehead despite the cool winter air.
He turned to find Cepheus Redwood sitting in a chair in the corner of the room. He had a ledger open in his lap. He didn't look up.
to his ever increasing list of things to do when he made his next stop. Hopefully there would be other humans there that Dean could play with and get the excessive behaviour out of his system.
Castiel huffed. He squeezed his eyes shut. He pushed up from the well's edge. His head throbbed to the beat of his heart. His stomach clenched again; more liquid leaked out. He put a hand to his stomach and groaned. His grandmother had told him this would happen.
Castiel stared at her in disbelief. Not too hot? He felt like he was on fire.
Castiel's chest heaved in anger. "If John Winchester is such an
His grandmother pat his knee. "We'll finish up with your face then get you as comfortable as we can."
Castiel felt his face go pale with shock when his grandmother stuffed her fingers into Rachel Goodson's cunt. She took them out and motioned for Castiel to come closer and do the same.
Castiel slipped the coins into his pocket first then took the glass. He gulped the water down, washing the taste of come from his mouth.
Dean recoiled, sure he was about to lose a limb. His eyes flicked between the ship and the hall to the station. He wasn't sure if it would be better to make a run for the ship or if he should try to run away and hide on the station. He didn't know why his master was suddenly furious with him. And not knowing why a master was angry was always bad news for a pet.
Castiel jerked his head back up and glared at the priest. "
Gabriel dropped his side of the cart. Anna yelped. Gabriel spun on his heel and pointed an angry finger at Castiel's grandmother. "No you didn't! Not if you want to eat. Not if you want to stay in your family's home! Not if you don't want the priest bringing another mob to our house to drag you out to the village square!"
Dean poked his head out from under the blanket and watched him curiously through it all.
Castiel dropped his mating tail to the bed, careful to keep it as far from Dean as possible just in case.
"...yes." His eyes dropped back down to his cold breakfast. He nodded again. "...there's blood after."
She pat his thigh and hobbled away from the alter. "Get little DeeDee there and bring her inside. We've got more to do before you mother comes home."
In the morning he went on the hunt for his master. When he found him his master made him run through a bunch of commands before carrying him to the kitchen for breakfast.
It bared its teeth at him. Castiel jerked back and arched his bladed tail. He'd read about human bites. Their mouths were disease ridden. Left untreated a human bite could cause some of the worst infections.
week.
instead of keeping him shut up on the ship. It made his chest fill with affection every time he thought about it. He hadn't thought his master would ever do something like that for him. His master had only started remembering to feed him on time in the last few weeks. Now his master was letting him run around in a park with other humans.
His grandmother shushed him. "This isn't their house."
The store employee hissed in amusement. "Don't worry. It wasn't going to bite."
A human voice called out to him.
His master nudged him forward and clacked his claws at him.
There were shouts from the crowd,
The next time bath time rolled around his master gave him a sharp look and shoved a nasty looking metal thing into his mouth to hold it open.
Evan slammed his hips forward and stilled. He groaned and let his head fall back. He rocked his hips forward lazily and let go of Castiel's ass. He slumped down on top of Castiel and heaved a sigh.
He got another pat on the head for his displeasure.
A shadow fell over them. "What is going on here?"
Dean leaned into it because that's what pets were expected to do. "Yeah. Thanks. Great. Just don't claw me with those things."
Castiel wrapped his arms around him. He squeezed Dean tight with arms and legs. He didn't think he'd ever be able to move again. He yawned against the top of Dean's head. "I wish today would never end."
He sat up and looked into the box. There was a mix of blueish-green balls about the size of a softball. He glanced up at his master. His master was busy putting away his work clothes. Dean looked back to the box. He flicked his eyes to the bed.
He would have thought Qech's claim was outlandish but he
"Dean, follow," Castiel said, leading the way.
"Fuck. I hate flying," Dean moaned. "Why'd you have to own a ship?"
His master repeated himself but this time he pushed his tail towards Dean's face.
He went to his office and brought up Dean's bill of sale. He scanned through it. He breathed in relief when he saw a small note at the end that Dean had been sterilized at the shop. At least he didn't have to worry about Dean getting loose on some planet and producing a bunch of kits with other humans.
His master clicked his claws at him then took the bowl of food away.
"My father says they're monsters." Castiel reached up and traced the outline of a cloud overhead. The grass shivered with the breeze. Spring had come early but it was still cool. According to his grandmother early springs were good for the lamb season. He wasn't sure if she knew that, because she was old or because she had seen something.
"Gabriel said they talked about it." Castiel sat down beside her. He reached out to stroke Deidre's wisps of hair. "Maybe in the fall."
Castiel stood in the road and watched the cart move ahead of him. Gabriel was right in saying that it was pride that had made them demand that the Winchesters pay a bride price or reparations if they couldn't produce Dean. It was their pride that had made them refuse to stop and let the village think he was loose and immoral.
