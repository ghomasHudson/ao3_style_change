Scene 19: int. Supercop Courtroom. Day.
Dean moans.
Dean doesn’t bother to correct him; it was better if the customers didn’t know too much about how things worked behind the scenes. “That’s the idea. But it’s fine if you don’t like me talking. Why don’t you talk to me instead?” Dean proposes, standing up straight and fixing his hat on his head. “Tell me what you want your boy whore to do for you.” Most men liked it when he called himself that. Dean watches Castiel’s pupils dilate. Him, too.
“He shouldn’t pressure you like that.” Cas moves to his pack and starts shoving clothes and things into it.
“Charlie said that?”
“Drink your tea.”
“But you write so good.”
“Oh, shut up. I haven’t had to listen to hour-long sermons from my holier-than-thou brother about how there’s nothing wrong with that, and how you’re the noblest whore in the world, providing for your worthless father and poor, downtrodden siblings for you to sit there and feel sorry for yourself.
Anyway this chapter IS a Dean confession regardless, he just doesn’t. You know. Use his words like a grownup. He’ll get there.
“Okay.”Dean’s a little dazed. He leans down and kisses Cas, softly sucking on his bottom lip, humming a little himself.
“I like the ugly ones, too. ‘Specially the old men. They can be real sweet. Grateful, I mean. Didn’t used to be boy whores in Abilene, you know. Benny’s security, really. Just picks up a few johns up on the side. I’m the proper first.”
He doesn’t even warn him, just presses his arm firmly to Dean’s upper back and Dean goes down without thinking. Cas pushes him all the way, all the way until his chest is against the table. Then Cas stands behind him, one arm solid against his shoulders, his other hand massaging Dean’s ass.
“Okay.” Dean nods and stares out the windshield, as if thinking something over. Cas hopes he isn’t going to try to talk him out of speaking to Raphael. “Listen, Cas,” Dean continues. “I’ll do you this favor, but there are ground rules.” Favor? Ground rules? “Rule one: not a word about it, d’you hear? Not to anyone, not to Sam, not even to me, got it?”
“Yeah?” Dean tries to keep breathing.
Well, shit, if you put it that way.
“I’d rather you didn’t.”
Cas isn’t so delusional as to deny it. Dean’s words aren’t open to interpretation, after all. Dean had been perfectly clear about the nature of their arrangement, and yet Cas can't help but hope anyway. Every day, he hopes: for touch, for words, for feelings. Every day, he takes whatever scraps Dean throws him: little miracles of pleasure, anticipation, ecstasy, maybe a joke, a towel, then goodbye.
“Ground rule two,” says Dean, taking his overshirt off. “You want me to stop, just say so, okay? I’ll stop. No big deal.”
“Will it?”
Dean smiles cockily against Cas’s lips. “Not feeling used now, are we?”
“I meant— I meant to give you a line, or something. You done made my brain go all fuzzy.”
Cas blinks, coming back to earth, and meets Dean’s eyes. “You’re right. I’m sorry.” He reaches down and pumps Dean gently.
Dean’s asleep before he can say it proper.
Dean’s mouth quirks with the satisfaction of power. He did love fingering Cas. “Say ‘please.’”
“Can I talk now?” Cas asks. He reaches a hand up to touch Dean’s shoulder lightly.
There’s a moment of silence, then, “Thank you, Dean. How do you feel?”
And Dean has no one else to talk to. Charlie is dead. His own fault. He has only his ghosts for company; them, and the Darkness herself. When he looks in her eyes, everything is okay, because he doesn’t feel haunted anymore. He doesn’t feel lonely. He doesn’t feel ashamed. When he looks in her eyes, he doesn’t feel anything at all.
“Didn’t prove nothing, sweetheart,” Dean responds, quiet and calm because Cas was still there, talking to him, and surely he should have left by now. “Told you we got lucky.”
“No,” Dean says, leading Jack down the hallway to the stairs by his tiny hand. “Why do you ask?”
“Yeah?”
“Need to shave it.”
Cas scratches his fingers through it. “Don’t shave it yet.”
“Would you consider most of your clients to be handsome?”
“Cas,” he begs finally.
that’s— oh, God, oh
“I didn’t see the appeal,” says Cas, looking irritable now.
“That’s blatantly untrue.”
“You gonna tell me what it is you want with me, darlin’?”
Cas calls again.
But, I think you’re maybe, actually, a good writer.
“Me, too.”
Cas turns and glares at him. “Of course I want you to, you dumbass. You absolute buffoon.” Dean would laugh at the word, but Cas is looking at him as seriously as he’s ever seen. Cas comes to him and puts a hand on his shoulder. He speaks quickly and emphatically. “I want you to come along, and impress Garth, and get signed into the contract with a starting bonus, and then spend the next ten weeks with me on the range, and keep me warm every night, even though it’s hot. And if that goes well we can ask him to send us farther north and west, to a place so far out there no one will care if we’re together ever again, and people like Fergus and my parents won’t be able to find us, and we can just be ourselves. And I want us to save up enough to buy land in the rockies and build a little homestead, and—“
“Shouldn’t I be?”
“I don’t have any big plans.”
CHUCK
“I enjoyed that comic in the Dallas Times Herald, of her stealing men’s wives.”
It’s good news.
Y'all knew it was coming. Let me know what you thought<3
He sits on the bed. Close. He brushes against Cas with his thigh and shoulder. He’s a fucking teenager.
Dean winks. “I know it. Now turn around.”
“You prayed to me earlier tonight, as well,” Cas tells him softly. “You welcomed me home.”
Dean walks up to her, hat in hand.
Dean can’t answer. Cas catches on.
He relaxes.
“Just the one,” says Cas, mouth quirked.
Dean stops, suddenly unsure what to do. Only air and Sister Jo between them, and it feels far too close.
“You are, Dean.” Cas leans down and kisses his exposed neck. His deep voice rumbles through both of their bodies. “Look at you. You are so good. My good boy.”
“Just a suggestion,” he says, blasé.
Dean rolls his eyes.
“I want you to do something for me, Dean. Now that you’re cuffed, you have permission to talk to me. Tell me how things feel. Tell me what you’re thinking, what you want. Do you understand?”
“Alright, alright. I can play along. I can.” Then again, maybe he couldn’t. Dean immediately becomes distracted by Cas licking him up and down, like he’s some sort of lollypop. Cas is making a display of himself, sitting on his heels, mouth wide open, lips pink and pretty as anything, tongue lapping hungrily. “You look good, there, darlin’, you know that?” Cas pauses to kiss at Dean’s tip again, staring up at him inquiringly. “Where’s—“ He finds Cas’s hat first, and puts it on himself while Cas swirls at the tip of his cock. “Hell, I— come here.” Dean bends down and lifts Cas’s chin. Cas comes up to meet him obediently, rising up onto his knees and kissing Dean sidewards so he doesn’t knock the hat off. Dean revels in it for a moment, salty and sweet, before pulling Cas gently off him and holding him by the chin. He glances down, taking Cas in, the curve of his stomach and the fullness of his cock, his mouth pink and panting. Dean leans in close again. “Will you please suck me off, darlin’?” he asks, holding Cas nearly against his lips.
“I’m sorry that he—“
A week later, he gets a letter addressed to Dean, courtesy of Josephine Anael, from C. Milton. He locks himself in room three to read it.
Dean finds a sprig of grass to chew and sits on the steps. The preacher had oh-so-kindly left the door open, not for Dean but for the boiling July air to flow through, so Dean can hear them talking inside, just barely. Shit about how John had served as a soldier, had raised six kids on his own, had done his best, had done everything he could, even though life got hard. Dean wonders if it’s true.
“You can borrow some of my clothes tomorrow if you want,” Dean tells him, impossibly calm. How could Dean be so calm? “We can head over to Walmart, get you something for yourself.”
Dean wanders alone through the empty, but it’s different from before— he passes various ANGELS and DEMONS but also HUMANS kicked out of heaven (all in groups, all awake).
“Love you, too, baby.”
He sneaks into the dark bedroom, strips, and slides into bed with Cas. There isn’t room enough for the both of them, really, but Cas rolls onto his side so Dean can fit. Cas has stolen one of Dean’s shirts, and so he’s cottony and soft as Dean snuggles around him and holds him close, like they’re one person instead of two.
“About what.”
Dean sleeps.
“You see, you stupid skank? You didn’t answer my question earlier. That was disobedient of you. If you disobey, you get nothing. If you obey, you’ll get what you want. When I say so. Do you understand?”
“You got a gun, Dean?”
They both just stare.
Cas kisses his cheek. “You must know that’s not true. Of course it’s not.”
“Dean.” Cas is looking at him like he’s being a total jackass, probably because he is.
“…What?”
Cas has left Dean’s hat hanging around his neck, and he tightens the string now. “You’re
“Uh, no.”
“You think so?” Cas raises his hand and pets through Dean’s hair.
Cas groans into his neck, and it tickles. Dean shivers.
“Yeah.”
“About what’s bothering you. Michael.”
Dean can’t stand still. “Leave us alone if I beat him black and blue.”
“Look at me, Dean,” Cas instructs.
CHUCK
“Leave?” Cas frowns, like Dean’s said something confusing. Like he’d never considered it. Like he doesn’t even know the meaning of the word.
“What about them?”
It sounds vaguely familiar. “That’s a band?”
“‘Morning, sunshine,” Dean greets.
Cas leans down and groans into Dean’s shoulder. Dean was hardly affected at all. Maybe he should give up and go take a cold shower, as the expression went. Maybe that would cure him.
“My dear,” says Balthazar, approaching Jo and giving her a pleading look, “If you could please spare me this torment. I've a coupon.”
Dean pets Baby’s nose.
“I’m sorry.”
“No, Dean.”
“Tell him to tell Fergus I’m not interested in whatever he’s selling.”
“Uh. Good. Got some shopping done.”
Suddenly it’s easy to talk. It feels good.
“Didn’t mean to snap at you,” Dean whispers.
Dean glances at Cas again, but he’s playing something fast-paced now on his own while Balthazar watches and comments.
“Wait, wait, wait,” says Dean, still catching up. “You done made that picture?” he asks, pointing at Cas.
“Dean,
“Uh-huh.”
“GERONIMOOOOOOOOO!” A kid nearly crashes into him as he throws his little toy Indian violently onto the floor under the bar. “Bang bang bang!” He follows it up with a little cowboy, this one staying in his hand until he’s only an inch from the floor before getting thrown too, the kid’s head almost colliding with Dean’s knee in the maneuver. Dean has to shift so he doesn’t brain himself.
Dean groans. “You’re gonna get me hot ’n bothered.”
She meets his eye. “Well, do you ‘might’ need to talk to me now, or do you ‘might’ need to talk to me after my bath?”
Dean hums in satisfaction and ruts harder against Cas’s ass. There’s too many layers of canvas, too much friction and heat, but he gets to close his hands around Cas’s this way, feel Cas’s body shudder and lean into him. “You want me to call you anything, or is this fine?”
“Bathrooms?”
Cas gives an approving hum against Dean’s thigh. “Is that what you needed?”
Dean wavers, then sits, glaring at Crowley.
Dean amends, silently, to himself. Dean pulls back, looks Cas in the eye. He looks confused, scared. Not far off from where he was in the brothel. God, he’s probably hating this. The hell was Dean doing.
“You don’t no more?”
Bobby stares at them, then sits. “Dean,” he says, like he has to explain something very serious to a little kid, “you might want—“
“Cas—“ Dean grabs his arm. “I didn’t—“
“You can do this, Dean. You had a bad day, but tomorrow will be better. I’ll have one of the girls bring you some water. You just sit tight.”
Dean looks down at himself and realizes he’s nearly covered in black dusty residue. No wonder Sam had treated him like some sort of disaster survivor. “Ah, shit. Guess I need to shower.”
“Four weeks.”
“Good.” They stare at each other for a moment, the room weirdly silent without the sound of sketching, then the sound resumes. “Hey, Cas?”
Dean doesn’t understand at all.
“I ain’t buying,” Dean tells her. “It’s for my client.”
Cas shakes his head.
Dean’s frustrated. He’s screwing this up.
“Yes, darlin’.” Dean moves his arms back, lets his weight fall harder onto his chest and face.
Dean shuts up, though it didn’t matter anymore; the sheriff goes on reading. He reads the whole damn thing. Every single letter. Every word.
“So what?”
Cas grumbles.
CHUCK
Yeah.
All that angel wants is to know what he wants.
“Word got home to daddy.”
Dean frowns. “What?”
“Better make good use of it, then.”
“Are you gonna talk to the cowboy?”
“Believe me, he’s fine with it.” Dean finds a chair and collapses into it.
“How did she die?”
“You.”
Dean backs off of Cas and sits there awkwardly for a moment before deciding to make himself useful. He grabs a fresh towel, wets it, and, with a low “Here,” uses it to clean Cas up, stubbornly avoiding eye contact as he wipes angelic skin clean. Cas seems to have come down from his high pretty quick; he thanks Dean quietly, soberly. Dean would swear he can feel Cas’s eyes on him as he finishes up, but he refuses to look. “So, uh—“ Dean tries to break the awkward silence as he returns to the sink and washes his hands. “Why’d you say that thing? About killing us both?”
“And what do you want to happen next?”
(Scared, hopeful)
“Shit,” says Dean.
Cas doesn’t respond, just keeps rubbing at his palms until long after they feel better, until Dean grabs his hands and holds them there. Cas looks up in surprise, eyes wide and innocent. Like he had no idea at all what he was doing to Dean.
He hates it.
“Do you sell photographs?” Castiel asks.
“I guess.”
Balthazar sighs. “How am I supposed to be a mess when you two are being messes? It isn’t fair. You’re supposed to be the responsible ones.”
“It’s a huge responsibility. Jack won’t be an adult for eleven years. You haven’t even seen me in almost as long.”
“That’s why I never said nothing. I am John Winchester’s kid, Dean. Blood don’t change that.”
“Oh.”
“So long as neither one of you shoots the other one.”
So they win… and then what?
“I could go to Earth and ask Sam to hold a seance, if you want to talk to him.”
“That’s what I want to do.” Had to get this stupid man to relax somehow.
“I make him mad like nothing else. He ain’t never beat on nobody the way he did on me that day, and if those kids get caught with me, they— they’re in a lot more danger than if the laundry don’t get done. Understand?”
“This look like your daddy’s house?” Dean asks.
“We got everything we need?” Dean grabs his gun and his machete; they’re useless toys against the Empty, but they make him feel safer.
A bit of a smile cracks through. “No.”
“Can I have a hug?” Cas asks hoarsely, and it takes Dean a second to realize he’s asking Jack, as Jack slides off the chair and climbs into Cas’s lap, wrapping his tiny arms around him tightly.
“Hey. I’m alright, darlin’. Look at me. I’m doing just fine. Sitting… pretty as twelve acres of pregnant red hogs.”
“No.”
“Dean,” Cas complains, a low rumble.
“It’s not in any particular order.”
“Cas, I need—“
“Shh.” Dean moves back over to Cas, and the water sloshes behind him. “Hush, now. You’re all right. Look at you. Safe in the tub. That’s what you wanted, right? Nice warm bath. Handsome whore boy to calm you down. Here you are.” Dean pets Cas’s hair gently as Cas stares at him. “Here I am. Enjoy it a bit. Done gone and spent too much money, now you get to enjoy it.” Cas reaches his arms up to grip Dean’s sides. His eyes close as Dean talks. “There, now. Here, I can prove ain’t nobody trying to manipulate you, you know how?”
Cas’s hand stills against Dean’s hole. “What are we
“It don’t?”
“I have a counter-offer.”
—But it doesn’t come.
“Ain’t you lucky.”
“Hm. You can’t. We have a busy day today.”
“Goodnight, Dean.”
Isn’t it beautiful? We’ll have TWO suns. Like Tatooine. And a robot maid for each house. And no one will have a soul. No rebels here.
How long would Dean let him get away with this?
“Yeah.”
Hell.
“No doubt the events of the last few decades will be the starting point of many new religions,” Cas supplies.
“Thinking how happy you’d be, when you heard how good I did.”
“Uh, yes.” Cas lifts off again, making Dean grunt with frustration, and they reapply oil before Cas mounts him again, moving a little more confidently this time, probably too quickly, but he’s on Dean and Dean isn’t complaining. He’s too busy keeping his hips still, fighting the urge to just fuck Cas, fuck Cas til neither one of them can feel anything anymore. He makes himself talk Cas through it, tell him how good he’s doing, and Cas moves slowly down and keeps going, goes all the way til he’s mounted directly on Dean’s hips.
Bal shifts forward. “Would you believe it’s because it makes me
“So impatient.” Cas kisses his shoulder. “Ready to stand up?”
He goes to Jo’s office, but she’s not in there yet. He tries her bedroom, knocking on the door. “Boss? You up?”
“Of course.”
“It’s expensive, and there aren’t many in town who can afford that kind of service.”
“Reckoned I’d try making an honest living.”
8. Monkey peas or peaballs (England)
“I didn’t mean to add to your anxiety,” Cas clarifies, feeling suddenly very anxious.
“Delightful. What, not even an apology?”
With the word
He kisses the baby, gobbling his face up and making him laugh.
flirting. Very badly. And stupidly proud of himself for it, too. It takes Dean a moment to process. He isn’t sure if he should laugh at, flirt with, or kiss the hell out of Cas. In the end he just asks, “So we’re really doing this, Cas?”
“Shit.” Dean gasps shakily.
It’s late afternoon when Dean reappears in the library door, jacket on and car keys in hand.
“I have to talk to Balthazar.”
“—I am
“Okay?” Cas asks.
That word again. It’s not
(Emotional)
“Yes, Dean.” Cas does, and Dean tries to collect himself. It’s hard, with Cas naked in front of him. Dean slides his trousers off, finds the water skin and takes a drink.
. There is too much frustration, anticipation, need. Cas gives in to it, flexes his hips, pushes into Dean just as Dean comes down on him, and—
“How do you know your daddy ain’t gonna send his own man, though?”
“Cas, you know we don’t have to do this, right away.”
“Nope.” The word comes out shaky. Shit.
“I mean it, Cas, I’m never getting out of this bed.”
“I just, you know. If I look like how you say I look, then that means I was happiest when the world was ending, and you died, and Jack was gone, so.”
Cas reaches his other hand up to touch Dean’s beard tentatively. “I like yours, too,” he says.
I love you.
It’s been a few hours since Billie left. Michael is still crashing against the walls in Dean’s head, each
“Well, then, help me out, would you?”
“I missed you, too,” says Dean honestly, settling lower onto Cas’s lap. “You damn dirty Yankee. Can I tell you something?”
Cas turns and strides past them both towards the door. Dean and Balthazar start to follow.
“No french press?” Cas muses.
The small smile stays on. “I made a list.”
“Very.”
“How old are they?” Cas asks.
“Alright, alright. Let the poor boy breathe.”
“Mm,” says Dean, just about the only syllable he can manage.
“Tell me to go, then.”
“—No talking, remember?”
Dean winks, takes his plunder, and heads back to the room, carefully turning the key in the lock and letting himself in. Cas looks up from where he’s sitting on the bed, sketching. Dean holds the goods high, letting them clink victoriously.
“Shit,” says Dean, meaning it bad, meaning Cas might as well have just thrown dirt down on Dean while he stood in a grave of his own digging.
“Hell no. Reckon she’d fire me if you asked.”
We’re still on Dean’s face. Cas made him feel better, feel hope again. FOOTAGE.
“Sure, babe. Whatever you want.”
Cas stares for a moment with a not-at-all aroused look on his face. “You can’t be serious.”
“You were?”
“But you’re fine.”
Cas tilts his head, and their lips brush again. It’s not a kiss, not really; nobody’s lips are moving. It’s just that same old Cas head tilt but up close and personal.
“What was that?”
Cas draws back when he sees the look on Dean’s face.
“Chrissakes,” Dean curses. “I take back everything I ever said about you making for a good whore. This is the least sexy thing ever happened to me. When we get to Santa Fe I’m reporting you to the sheriff on the grounds of— on the grounds of—” But Cas is back on him and he’s lost his train of thought. “Fuck.” Cas hums around him, bobbing on his cock for all the world like he likes the taste, then he pops off again and spits. “Fuck you. Rude as hell.”
So he worked hard, and he wore his hat, and he made men happy, and at the end of the day he had money left over to send home.
Cas gasps as he comes inside Dean and Dean squeezes around him deliriously. He’s been so close for long, he can barely control himself, can barely think. His cock twitches desperately. He’s little more than a fog of want and sensation. Cas is panting against his back, pulling out of him, and Dean squirms at the sensation, not happy to have Cas gone. He wants to come, but he also wants to fuck all night. Fuck forever.
“You did.”
“And the others? What are they like?”
he pulses hard in Dean’s mouth, moaning and gasping for air against Dean’s cock.
“Reckon I might be.”
“I ain’t exactly thrilled about having a psycho archangel in my head,” Dean admits.
“Look at me.”
“He ain’t gonna marry you off,” Dean says. “No matter how bad the ranch is doing.”
Balthazar leans forward. Dean leans down to meet him, elbows on the table, ass in the air.
, the wish that Dean would respond in kind. How Castiel wishes.
(Furious)
It happens several more times.
An elbow presses between his shoulder blades. Cas leans down over him, breath tickling in his hair. “Can I spank you?”
“Yeah, Cas.” Jesus Christ, did that mean Cas had never gotten a blow job?
“It’s y’all’s day off,” Dean points out, letting his hands wander lower to grope Cas’s thighs. “Let him sleep.”
“So you’ll take her?” Bobby asks dryly.
Dean gropes him softly, over the pants, trying to elicit that sound again, but Cas only gasps this time, then whispers, “Dean.”
“Anytime.”
“Just wanna know you’re alright.”
“You’re all pink.”
“Oh.” Dean swallows, shifting. He realizes he doesn’t have his hat on, and scratches his head awkwardly. “So, I guess. Guess I’ll see you then?”
Sam looks from Eileen to Cas to Dean suspiciously. “Dean, are you—
“How did you know?” the man asks in a Yankee accent. “We just got in to town; we’ve been riding all day.”
“Yes, Dean.”
“Yes, Dean.”
“Oh, come on, Castiel. Don’t plotz. This isn’t Boston. No one cares what you do out here. That’s
Dean sighs and leaves the bedspread alone. “I like
while I’m gone. Got it?”
Oh, yeah? And what do you suggest we do, Sammy? Huh? How do you suggest we fight the all-powerful being holding an icepick in our brains? Huh? How are we supposed to fight him if he’s willing to just—erase who we are?
“You wanted my fingers inside of you, opening you?”
Chuck is excited, ready to continue monologuing, but Dean isn’t having it.
double the prices. Triple them, even.”
April 8th, 1890
“Hotcakes,” Cas confirms.
“Which hole you want it in?”
“Sure. That’s what you college types call vacation, right?”
Cas had started haunting him years ago. Dean was freshly broken, then. A younger man. He’d had fewer ghosts, and a better handle on them, though it had felt overwhelming at the time. He’d let himself be tempted, and Cas had kissed him, and Dean knew he’d never forget it, much as he tried. The ghost of Cas had shadowed him since, in dreams and in waking. It was everywhere. It was in the dark of night and a bottle of whiskey, in the glint of a monster’s eye and the brush of a stranger’s mouth, in a chill touch of wind and the shiver it sent up his spine. Cas was behind his eyelids, dominating his mind with a penetrating stare, an unspoken accusation filling Dean’s gut with shame.
“Cold,” Dean gasps. “And they got to keep warm.”
Bal shakes his head, the look in his eye dark and knowing. “You don’t get it at all. What Castiel should have done, when our father kicked him out, is move to an apartment in Brooklyn, get a job at a factory or a newspaper or somewhere, find a nice Jewish boy to fuck, and let me rot in my hole on Mott Street. He should not have pulled me out of there, and he certainly shouldn’t have listened to my drugged-up ramblings about freedom in the West. Because let me tell you something about my brother. Once he’s taken on a cause, he doesn’t give up. He’s stuck with me for life.”
says Dean.
Dean shakes his head, biting his own hand in anticipation.
Just another minute.
“That… is a sapient point.”
“Huh.” Dean plays with Cas’s hair thoughtfully. “You like it?”
Even as Dean watches, Cas reaches a hand down to touch himself. He nearly pulls his fingers completely out.
“Alright.” Cas takes the towel.
“Don’t do this, Cas,” Dean starts following him, walking swiftly down the street, heartbeat starting to escalate into panic.
says the jackass part of him again, but Cas, being Cas, doesn’t explain himself, and Dean, being Dean, doesn’t ask. He eyes Cas’s fingers instead. He isn’t wearing a wedding ring. Did Jewish folks wear wedding rings?
“A not-ungratifying experience.” Cas wriggles around on top of him and goes back to kissing his ear. “Did they get married?”
“There’s nothing to say.”
“Yeah?”
Warnings: explicit, graduated to like proper porn this time, rimming, roughish sex but not really, lack of verbal consent, dubcon if you don't consider prayers consent. Par for the course level of angst. Also includes total plagiarism of That Scene because wow there was way too much going on to paraphrase it.
Dean crooks his finger, and Cas moans. It was so easy.
He watches as Cas’s shoulders rise and fall, a deep breath. “The people here,” Cas asks, “they know what you are?”
“Just for the room. Not your share, if you don’t want it.”
He’s still the same way, though the hour that constitutes ‘early’ has changed. He gets up right away, though, has to do something immediately or else he feels like a mess.
They both stare as Balthazar leans in and smells Cas’s shoulder.
“You’re humiliating yourself,” says Cas.
“I thought it was going well so far.”
he asks finally, frustrated.
“It’s exhausting being used all the time, isn’t it? They’ll happily throw you at a rabid archangel, without so much as a ‘thank you’ after. Not even a fag and a coffee. It’s absolutely despicable. I’ve worked my way up the corporate ladder in Hell, and I can tell you honestly that there is no job in the universe less rewarding than running errands for that pumped-up, ungrateful, shotgun shell of repression and his holier-than thou brother.” Cas doesn’t know what to say to this; it rings a little too true. He’s a relieved when Crowley keeps talking instead of asking his opinion.
“Go wait there by the door, alright, Josie-Jo? I won’t be a minute.”
“Kosher?”
He dries off and drinks more water.
“No,” Cas replies, sinking down onto him. “No.”
“That’s alright,” Cas consoles him softly. “You’re being good now, aren’t you? My good little whore.”
Cas meets Dean’s gaze to find nothing but sincerity and the implications are too much. Dean wants him, wants him to do things like
“I didn’t. When it wasn’t true.”
Dean laughs weakly. “My bad.”
“Or were you attempting to procrastinate?”
Dean shifts awkwardly, getting his feet up so he has some leverage, then he lifts his torso up slowly, then back down again, so slowly, feeling Cas drag and shift and twitch inside of him, enjoying the power of being on top, of having Cas beneath him, of being able to take him so fucking deep and slow and good—
“Incorrigible.”
still feels so new to Dean, and suddenly there’s so much of it and all he can do is grip Cas tight in his hands and think thoughts too humiliating to speak aloud.
I feel. I have a lot of feelings right now.
“Thank you. Thank you, darlin’.”
“No, there’s”—he’s interrupted by the POP! of the cork—“no need to waste it on me,” Cas finishes dryly. Dean spits it into his hand.
Dean whistles. “Like getting a cat to lick you after you just bathed in dog soup. Impossible. Best thing ever happened to me. What?”
“All due respect, Dean, I ain’t the bad guy here, and I’d appreciate a little truthfulness from you. Now what sin goes on inside this house I don’t concern myself with, because Miss Anael is a good citizen, and she gives to lots of charities around town,—”
“I done the math,” Cas confirms.
“You finally catching me up? Yeah. Hotcakes.”
“Just wanted you to be armed, is all.”
“What’s this like?” Dean asks, as if he doesn’t already know. As if he can’t see Castiel’s arousal plain as day between his folded legs. As if the sweep of Castiel’s eyes over his body doesn’t make him feel the memory of teeth pressing into his skin.
“Not unless you want to. Maybe everything I’ve said is irrelevant. I still don’t know. You haven’t said.”
feel good, sweetheart. It’s your night. Could dress me up, tie me up, bruise me up. I got a trick I do with a black mask and a clothes hanger. It always gets a standing ovation.” He winks, but Cas doesn’t laugh.
“A-around my cock.”
Cas’s eyes widen. His entire expression changes. “You do?”
“Look, just call him, will you?”
Dean just pushes past her, out the door, then Benny grabs him, and Dean turns to give him a glare. “I got something I need to do,” he says, voice low and mean as he can get it, “alone.” And Benny lets him go.
Dean nods. He watches Cas carefully. There’s something different about him, and it isn’t just the humanity. He seems… fragile.
“Me, too,” Cas whispers. His hand brushes down Dean’s beard gently. His eyes trail across it and Dean’s mouth. “I’m going to have to draw you with this before you shave it.”
“My heart,” says Cas.
Dean frowns at the sky, shadows of grey smoke obscuring the stars. “You need something stronger than tobacco, amigo.”
“Sit down, Dean, and we can talk about this.”
“Hell yes, Castiel.”
Maybe?
Cas had left; that’s all there was to it.
Hey, Sammy? Can I ask you something?
Something shines out of Cas’s eyes at the word. He pulls Dean closer and kisses him. “Good boy,” he rumbles. Dean can feel the words in every muscle of his body. “Get up and dry yourself off,” Cas orders. “Get out the oil, and wait for me on the bed.”
“Yes, Dean.”
Cas breathes a breathy sort of laugh. “Let me— let me, first. You. Later.”
Dean hides his little book back in his saddlebag like it’s contraband, and goes to answer.
He calls Cas as soon as he’s left alone.
What kind of trouble did you think I was in?”
“In my way, nothing. I already got Donna to cover me tonight. Just gotta finish up some laundry. Rest of the day’s yours. What d’you want to do?”
“No. Just stay within a visible distance.”
“Sexy,” Dean finishes for him, a strange expression on his face.
Cas stops sucking. His hand misses a beat. “Pretty?”
in the middle of a hotel bar, so they both just think it to themselves, then Cas frowns. “You could have found me,” he says. “Crowley was advertising his products across the country. Garth knew where I was, too. You could have reached me.”
The preacher won’t let him into the church, so Dean has to talk every single goddamned Winchester down from yelling at the preacher before he decides he won’t let
“Yeah, we found her outside. Must’ve wandered back to town on her own.”
“I’m sorry.”
Cas looks up at him. “Not like this. I only have one more night like this.”
“Cas, he ain’t nothing. He ain’t worth thinking on.”
Motel it is, then. Dean decides to stop for burgers on the way as well, even though he just ate. He has a feeling Cas hasn’t been getting enough hot food. He orders himself a burger and swallows it down so that Cas won’t feel self-conscious, and watches to make sure Cas finishes his own. Then he drives them to a motel with a vacancy sign and gets them two queen beds for the night.
Which meant Cas had been shot.
Dean slides himself onto Cas without waiting for instructions. Cas hisses beneath him, letting go of Dean’s cock and putting his hands on Dean’s hips instead. Dean works himself all the way down, taking Cas to the hilt, so fucking deep. “Fuck,” Dean whines happily.
“There’s a trick to this,” he tells Cas. “Do you wanna know?”
“You think you're the only one rolling snake eyes here? Me and Sam, we had her. We had Kelly and we lost her.” Oh. Maybe that was it. Forgiveness in the knowledge that they were all flawed. Dean had used a similar argument before;
Dean smiles wider. He raises again—no reason not to. Tagg, after deliberating, calls. So does Cas. They show their hands.
“Right in here, actually,” Dean answers, attempting to be smooth, despite his twitching lip. His blood is boiling. The air is too thin. “About ten times a day.”
God, couldn’t Michael shut up long enough for Dean to enjoy himself before—
“Are you sure about that?” The angel hits him with this doubtful look that actually has him questioning himself.
“Reckon you like a challenge.”
“You’re the one who found him?”
There’s dirty talk welling up in him—Dean is not a naturally quiet lover—but he swallows it down.
Cas takes the jug back and takes another drink. They both breathe. Dean keeps petting Cas’s hair.
Hell. Cas starts talking. “I know it’s a lot to ask. I know it’s your decision, but Dean, I don’t want—“
“My point is—“ Cas takes a deep breath, releasing it slowly. “My point is, we can do anything. You control your own body.”
Cas is just breathing now, they’re still so close, almost a touch. Dean can feel the heat of Cas’s breath and the spark of his grace and maybe a tiny bit of stubble.
“That means—“
No. You can’t hear it.
“Is this real?” he whispers.
“I don’t know what else to say.”
“‘M a good little whore.”
Dean taps on his leg a few more times, examining the heavy canvas of his pants before finally letting his fingertips rest there. His eyes hurt when he looks up at her. “He could be beating on her right now. No way of knowing.”
“I don’t know.”
“Am I supposed to lie? My clothes aren’t particularly alluring.”
“Bullshit,” Cas agrees instantly. “Complete bullshit.”
It takes Dean a few hours to fall asleep.
“How y’all hain’t gone and wasted away is beyond me,” Charlie mutters as Dean sits down across from her at one of the parlor tables and clinks down two glasses, letting the peanuts roll onto the table in their shells.
“He really hates me, don’t he? Adam.”
Okay.
“Just a bonus, darlin’,” Dean assures him. “Just a bonus.”
There’s a new voice in the hall.
Cas looks back.
“I want everything, Dean. I want to see all of you. Especially your chest, and your penis.”
“Shit. Shit, Cas.” Dean says it with a breathy laugh, but it’s hot, fuck, it’s hot, and he starts pushing at Cas’s lower back with his legs, grinding up on him harder.
“I’ve been trying to think of ways to compliment you that you’ll like,” Cas says. “I haven’t come up with much, but I think I have something.”
“You remember his name now?” the sheriff asks.
—Or maybe it was me tampering with Dean’s memories.
But they don’t work as distractions now, not when every other line reminds him of something Cas would say, about Jim Crow or Denis Kearney or Indian reservations.
He loved Cas, too, the way he’d look over and watch him even when they were both busy with their own business, the way he’d serve Dean his supper and then clean up after like Dean was his guest, the way he’d sit and draw him every night by the light of the fire, even when Miguel noticed him at it and began to tease. He kept on drawing like Dean was the only thing there to look at and drawing was the only thing to do.
Cas looks at Dean’s hand on his shoulder.
Dean shrugs. “Won’t be the first kid I raised up wasn’t mine. ‘Sides, I kind of owe it to Bal.”
I ain’t talking about John!”
“Fergus,” says Cas, turning his head to almost be able to speak properly, “likes you.”
Cas gets the list.
“I’m rebelling.” Dean grabs the corner of the blanket and puts it over his face.
“Is that good or bad?”
Chuck can read Sam’s mind. He really does think so.
Dean groans against Cas’s neck and his hand speeds up. Cas matches it.
Dean flinches. “How are you feeling?”
“You got a gun?”
is creation, not that Disney rip-off outside. It’s like you said, we’re just figments of your imagination. Of
“I know, Cas. We’ll figure it out.”
Dean gets increasingly frustrated as he speaks. Sam is still calm. He is CONTENT (not happy) with this Heaven after a long, boring-ass life. At least he’s with another person now. (It’s a strange thought to have, but he doesn’t want to examine why.)
Eileen?
“Y’all don’t owe me nothing.”
“You ain’t a client, Cas.”
“Yeah, you— you’re right.” He quiets down, shuts his fat mouth. “You know, I— I bet he would’ve liked the idea of you going to school, if he’d’ve thought we could afford it.”
“What?”
“I don’t think the owners would appreciate it, no.”
he’d explained. Cas is only in a shirt and pants, but that will be plenty once Dean’s in nothing at all.
(A little louder)
Cas stares at him, eyes cool and dark in the barn. “You just said yourself living in Abilene wouldn’t solve all your problems.”
I promise there are less-depressing chapters in the future. I also promise they will fuck again.
“Thank you, Dean.”
“Whiskey?” Dean asks.
Charlie snorts.
The first night they’d met, Dean hadn’t thought twice about stripping down and wearing ladies’ underwear. He’d worn that stupid hat everywhere, too; thought it made him invincible. That past Dean doesn’t seem real anymore. Current Dean knows he’s mortal, knows heartbreak, and knows what it is to be figuratively and literally broken apart. But in many other ways, he’s more solid, now. He knows himself and his worth. He owns two properties in Abilene. He has his siblings back.
They pass the bottle around and actually work up a cheery sort of mood; Bela stops by, and Benny, too, but then it gets late and they have to work, and—shit, Dean thinks—he could be working tonight to take his mind off of things, but even he can tell he’s too shit-faced to do it, now; Jo would send him right back. He tries nonetheless, comes on into the parlor with his hat on, pretty as anything, and kicks up a fuss when Jo gestures at him to head back. Benny ends up near carrying him to bed, and Dean leans into him, thinking how nice he was, how big and warm and caring, and how Benny had done just what Dean said to do every step of the way.
“Yeah. I also read Kit Carson and Buffalo Bill stories.”
9. Pishamares (England)
“Feel better?”
Cas answers quickly. “Of course. Of course, Dean, I—I’d love to have you.”
“We just been talking, mostly,” Jo admits.
“Dean, I— you’re so—“ Cas is panting, needing, wanting.
“—Dean. I’ll listen better. And I forgave you. And now you’ve promised not to hurt me again, so let’s move on, alright? I don’t want you feeling guilty for four weeks. I’m not mad.”
This chapter is for you.
“Shit.” Dean blinks up at Cas, who’s caressing his face and hair gently.
“What, six of you?” Cas hands him the robe and the wet shirt, which Dean hangs on hooks. The wet shirt wouldn’t like it too well, but Cas doesn’t object.
Dean pauses at that. He doesn’t like the word
Another flash of FOOTAGE of Cas.
He slides off Cas’s cock, then pulls his fingers slowly out. Cas pants there on his bedroll, lying still and relaxed. “Amazing,” Cas says warmly, and Dean feels it deep in his soul. “You’re amazing, Dean.” Dean closes his eyes and absorbs it, tries to hold it inside, all of it, as he grips Cas’s knee and catches his breath. A moment later, he crawls forward and lies on top of Cas, wrapping his arms around him and listening to his heart in his chest, pumping out a victorious rhythm. Five years of sucking cock was worth it, if only for this. He listens to Cas’s heartbeat, to the wind in the leaves, to the empty sky beyond. Cas’s hand rubs his back. Dean tightens his grip.
Okay so sorry if there are typos, it is because this is 18.4k words long and i am one human. Every time i edit this it only gets longer so I'm cutting myself off and the mistakes will simply have to get published. Either settle in or plan for breaks.
“It ain’t about—“
Dean smirks at him. “I should hope so.”
“Ain’t one thing John said today was true, Dean. There ain’t nothing wrong with what you are. You may be the best man I ever met.”
Whole goddamn family was broken. Dean needs a drink. A drink and a cigarette and maybe a night in one of those opium dens in New York. He chokes it all back. “I’m sorry,” he says. “I am.”
“That’s right.” Cas kisses his cheek. “You were wonderful. Dean, I’ll give you whatever you want. What is it you want?”
“Yeah.”
“Not your asscheeks,” Cas scolds. “Your trousers.” Had Cas really not noticed them before? Dean’s a little insulted. “How were you riding in these without splitting them?”
The corner of Dean’s mouth twerks up, confused, like he wasn’t expecting that word from Cas. “Yeah?” is all he says.
CHUCK
“Sure I am. Kids don’t gotta be.”
Dean grins at Cas as he chews.
Balthazar keeps on talking. “He’s strange, but competent. All the cowboys know him; it’s like a requirement around here. You do want to be a cowboy, don’t you? You seem to enjoy the banality of it all.”
Shit. Cas groans. He reaches out and balances himself on Dean’s shoulder. It was so good. It had been so long. It was
“What should I—?“ Cas asks.
“But I love it when you talk, Cas, darlin’. Don’t you want your boy good and hard for you?”
“I’m not sure.”
I’m not sorry, Dean.
“Is this alright?” Cas asks, resting his chin on Dean’s chest in order to look up.
“What about him?” Dean slams his door closed.
Mohinder.
“Other than that.”
“Don’t you say that.”
Ruby puts her whole body into rolling her eyes. “—That’s
“No, no. You figured Jack out before we did. I meant, before you took it, we— you played me good.” It comes out accusatory, because it is. And here he is anyway, despite the hurt, wrapped in Cas’s arms. Completely hopeless.
That makes it better.
“Need— your— cock,” Dean manages to get out in between gasps, and Cas flies off him and onto his lips, rising from the floor and onto his knees and knocking Dean’s hat askew. Then they’re fumbling at each other, lifting Dean’s leg, lining Cas up, the bed so low they can fuck just like that, and a second later they are, Cas pushing into him and Dean moaning and squirming at the awkward angle, trying to move his torso back and his hips forward even while Cas, groaning and kissing at his chest, starts pumping into him, but it’s not deep enough, and then Dean upsets their balance and they’re falling, with a thud, onto the wooden floor.
shut up?”
“Beautiful,” Cas says without hesitation.
Okay. On three. One—Two—
Cas takes another sip. “I do. At maybe three, four in the morning. Then I go back to sleep.” There’s something delicious about Cas’s voice in the morning, even lower and grittier than normal, but more vulnerable, too.
Cas’s hand finds Dean’s cheek, and Dean looks up into Cas’s eyes, dark and vast and unknowable. What did he see.
“You get off on saying it?”
“You’re worth the world,” says Cas, not a hint of a joke on his face. Dean shifts beneath him. He was going to have to get Cas to lay off the sweetness. But there was so much more to deal with, in the meantime.
“I mean, not so much.” Dean looks down, meaning to look at the results of him getting carried away, but Cas’s chest is clean. There’s nothing there.
Dean opens his mouth and nothing comes out. He closes his mouth and reaches out with a hand instead. Cas, hesitating, not sure if he’s misinterpreting somehow, takes it. This calms Dean. When he speaks it’s with relief and something approaching happiness.
But instead Crowley hits a lever on his seat and falls back in it roughly until he’s almost laying flat, and then turns on his side, facing away from Cas. “You’re depraved,” he whines pitifully. “You need psychiatric assistance.” And then, mercy of mercies, he pretends to sleep for the rest of the tape.
“You taste like sweaty horse.”
“Lorna, have you met my buddy Cas yet?” Dean asks.
DEATH
“Cas, darlin’?”
“Four of us will attract undue attention. Besides, you hardly need my help to take care of some vampires. I’ll stay behind with Jack.”
“You was real nervous, huh?” Dean asks.
“Which is why I’m paying him. Why am I paying you, Dean?”
“More or less. I’ve never heard it put that way before, but yes, it’s like tarnish. It’s a chemical reaction, usually of a silver solution with the light.”
Cas doesn’t answer. The bed sinks behind him.
Never do they face each other.
“—Is that what they’re calling it these days?” the man asks suggestively, putting his drink down on the bar before leering at Dean. “He’s very talented, isn’t he? Very… vocal.”
“You’re not as stupid as you look.”
Dean knows better than to answer that.
“You promised, Cas, darlin’. You said you’d open me up in front of God and man, make me scream your name.”
“You mean, we?” Cas asks.
Castiel chuckles vaguely, eyes still closed. “No, can’t say that I have.”
The next day he receives Cas’s reply:
“You ever see it in anybody else?” Dean asks.
“You’re good at a lot of things,” says Bobby, and Dean has to fight not to roll his eyes to the sky. “You’ll do just fine.”
“Is he—“
“You take good care of me,” Cas says, as Dean works him.
“Shit,” Dean curses. Though it’s just Cas’s tip it’s much larger than two fingers, and it burns, but Dean’s afraid to imagine too hard, to make the sensation go away; he wants to feel Cas, know it’s him there—
“Trying to do better,” says Dean weakly. “Hey, Cas?”
“—Boys, boys, BOYS” says Charlie, putting her tiny body between the two of them. “Ain’t the time for fighting.”
“Have you ever seen something so beautiful you wanted to smash it?”
“You ain’t mad over Cas, you’re mad over Ruby—“
“Jo, I ain’t skipping town.”
“What, no hate for the man who enabled me?”
Cas pants, his eyes on Dean’s cock. “My apologies.”
Cas is silent, his thumb wandering to Dean’s lips. Dean kisses it, then sucks on it, holding it on his tongue as Cas presses into him, in and out. Dean matches him, moving his own finger to Cas’s rhythm, in and out, and they moan together softly.
“—And never to write me again.”
From his face, cut to:
Dean looks around at Cas’s home. Cas clearly hasn’t gotten to planning any sort of interior design yet; the walls are all white. The room they’re standing in has an arched ceiling, a television, a long white mantle covered in photos, and a recliner. There’s a coffee table with a few books and DVDs on it, a stereo in the corner, and a couple of paintings sitting on the floor, leaning against a wall. The rest of the room is empty, floor bare, too large for just one guy.
“Stay,” Cas orders. “Let me look at you.” Dean falls still, relaxed against the mattress. Dean’s still panting, still flushed. Cas watches his chest heave hungrily. There are a few bits of come spattered onto his stomach, and his penis, which is still half-engorged, is flushed bright pink like Dean’s lips. “Can I come on you?” Cas asks. “I want to come on you.”
Cas turns to look at him. “Dean, I—”
The shy but handsome one—Castiel—shoots his brother a glare, one that very clearly says
“Shut up, Edgar,” Jo snaps back at him. “My finger’s itching. Go stew in your whiskey and remember I can hit a man’s ballsack through his trousers at 50 yards.”
“That’s great. You’re doing so good. God, Cas. You alright?”
He’s trying to adjust to the sight of Cas “Smiley” Milton, the gruff cowpoke best known in his hometown for shooting a man in cold blood, in bed with a kid who obviously trusted him over anything else in the world.
“Hats. Worn to express humility before God.”
“—This ain’t none of your business, Cas. This is family. Understand?”
Cas meets his eyes. They stare at each other for a moment, then Cas shifts, climbing up the bed and over Dean. Somehow in the night Cas had gotten him facing the right way. Dean tilts his head for a kiss, but it doesn’t come.
“I ain’t no liar, Cas.”
They all head to a pretty stuccoed inn called Casa Bonita, a name Dean remembers from the address he’d sent one of Cas’s letters to, and go to board their horses out back. Dean gives a little kiss to Baby and a dollar and a mean look to the stableboy, just to be safe. He starts going over how to correctly brush her down until Cas leads him out of there with a hand on the small of his back. Dean slows down on purpose as they walk back around to the front of the building, making sure the others are far ahead.
A few minutes later they leave the store weighted down by paper shopping bags. The sun had set while they were shopping; Jack and Sam must have eaten dinner by now.
“My God, these are tight,” says Cas.
“There you go!” says the brother loudly, reaching into his pockets.
The sheriff leans forward over the chair. “It ever occur to you that the person you ought to be protecting is you?”
“They do, actually. In abundance.”
“Well, I am, and I have no money. Buy me dinner.”
“Don’t,” says Dean sharply, bringing a finger up to Cas’s face. “I ain’t finished yet.” Cas keeps frowning, but shuts up. “So, the point is— the point is, it ain’t us, right? It’s him. It’s his feelings. They need someplace to go. So if a big, strong cowpoke comes and knocks him flat, now he’s even more angry than he was before. See?”
“What kind of pie?”
“What could you feed me, darlin’?”
Hopeless man. Cas takes his hand. Dean looks down at it. “Let’s go celebrate.”
Instead, Cas is quiet for a moment before asking. “How are you? Your family?”
Cas thinks, as he breathes Dean’s scent through his sleep shirt.
They toast. The first verse of CARRY ON WAYWARD SON plays as we PAN UP, past the window, through which we can hear SOUNDS OF MERRIMENT, past the roof of Miracle Motors, up to a blue starry sky framed by the silhouettes of pines.
that shuts Dean up. He swallows his protestations. They’d just have to disagree on this. He rubs his thumb down Cas’s. “I’m sorry I went and told you to get gone like that. Wasn’t fair. Didn’t mean to torture you. Or, maybe I did, but not for so damn long. Six weeks of stupid.”
“No.”
The rope loosens. “Thanks, buddy.”
“Not you?”
“Charlie’s in jail,” Cas points out.
“If you don’t want— If you don’t want this, tell me. I’ll stop.”
Dean thinks.
Cas lets himself be inspected. Dean looks him over thoroughly; his shoulder where he’d pushed him, his wrist where he’d held him, his spine, where Dean had forced him to the rug. Only the last was red and swollen, going to bruise, if Dean had to guess.
It wasn’t a joke, but Cas doubles up laughing, hardly making a sound, just shaking against him and making Dean smile, too. Cas stills and moves Dean’s hand around, kissing the palm now, mouth still wide in a smile, and Dean stares up at the moon, thinking Balthazar was wrong. In this moment, even homeless, as it were, he feels totally secure. He feels better than he’s ever felt in his life.
were mountains.”
“When?”
What’ll never happen?
Could he rope. “Reckon I can rope a mite bit better than ‘city-boy-Smiley’ here,” says Dean, causing Cas to scoff and push off away from him to a chorus of “oh’s” and laughter from the men.
Cas sighs and bites the bullet.
“Quiet, Dean. Just a minute.” The key jangles in the lock and Sister Jo appears there in her nightgown and robe. “I was just explaining to Sheriff Buchanan here how I lock y’all in every night.”
Cas’s eyes are red. “To manipulate me into coming back and spending more money.”
Chuck stops walking, turns to face Sam
“I’m being sincere. Most of the things my father hates about people are things I’d consider their more positive features.” Cas sketches a little, flips the page, sketches more. He thinks for a minute. “I suppose he’d hate your kindness towards me the most.”
“Please fuck me, Castiel. Please fuck your little whore boy.”
For one hundred dollars.
Fuck, not yet. Please.
“You bastard,” Cas says, “you goddamn son of a bitch.”
And that, more than anything else, is what makes him hate himself. He hates himself for being happy, away from the kids. He hates himself for wanting this, for thinking it could actually happen. He hates himself just the same as Adam hates him, for getting out.
Dean inserts his index finger, and now he fucks Cas gently, in and out a few times, listening to the rhythm of Cas’s breath follow the motion, then he resumes working Cas’s rim slowly, parting his fingers and bringing them together again.
Dean unlocks the cabinet under the bar and grabs them a bottle and two glasses, sliding a quarter into the cashbox.
Cas shakes his head.
“Dean?” Cas whispers.
“You wanna know I been thinking ‘bout you. And I wanna tell you, darlin’, I do. Wanna tell you all the thoughts I been thinking about you, about the two of us, what we can do together. But Sister Jo don’t like it when people get too—” Dean runs his hand down Cas’s vest again, letting just one finger trail along his shirt— “personal, in the parlor, you understand?”
Next up: Cas comes back to life! A happy chapter god bless
CHUCK
Inside of Dean, Cas’s finger sweeps from side to side, then presses deeper and sends shivers up Dean’s spine. “Fuck.”
“Cas,” he says. Cas looks up from where he’s fetching them biscuits and jerky. He walks over to where Dean is sitting and offers him some, as if that’s what Dean had wanted. “The hell is this?” Dean asks, holding up the notebook so Cas can see. Cas’s expression doesn’t change.
“I want— your mouth,” says Castiel.
Dean forces himself to look up as he hands the drink over. “Never heard of him.”
“Yeah! Uh. Yeah, okay. Deal.” He’s smiling.
He has to.
“Mm.” Dean slides over and kisses Cas, resting his arms around Cas’s strong shoulders. He had the best job in the world.
Dean stares at her for a moment. Behind her is a tall, wide-chinned man with a thick mustache and a tan hat. Behind him, still in the open doorway, is Sam. “‘Mornin’, Sheriff,” says Dean. His eyes slide immediately back off him to Sam, who’s giving him an intense look he can’t figure the meaning of. “Sam.”
There were a lot of things that could set a barn in West Texas alight. A cigarette was one, smoked furtively where the family couldn’t see, dropped at God knows what impetus onto a pile of dry hay. A lantern was another, resting on a surface where it ought to be safe, til someone who oughtn’t be there, who was a little too drunk and a little too reckless, bumped into it.
Dean rides back to Sister Jo’s with two horses, a hat on his head, and a big, fat grin on his face. By the time the sun has risen, he’s made it back to the house and he’s riding Baby in a tight circle out in the street, hooting and hollering and sending Sue-Anne skittering back. Cas is the one who opens the front door, and Dean pulls Baby up in front so he can see her full beauty.
Maybe it’s a mistake; it certainly earns him a deadly look from Ruby, but he wants to be able to look at his picture. He wants to talk, too, so he talks with Donna about him, and she swoons, and says all the right things, too sweet for her own good, and Dean gets to brag a bit. Charlie finally comes by one day and Dean talks to her about his Yankee cowpoke with the blue eyes and the voice of an angel. Meg joins the conversation and even has a nice word or two to say about Cas. Dean didn’t even realize she’d met him. He forgets to ask them what, if anything, they know about Judaism. Abilene doesn't have a public library, so Dean figures he’ll just have to wait and find out more from Cas directly.
Dean swallows everything down and kisses Cas’s spent cock as he lifts slowly off. Cas collapses onto the tarp beside him, just slightly off kilter from where he had been. He pumps Dean’s cock slowly in his fist, hot breaths hitting Dean’s skin. Dean reaches a hand over, just wanting to touch Cas and finding his ass. He palms it, playing with it as Cas kisses his dick again.
“I’d rather step out with a cowpoke than a huckster. But ain’t nothing that would keep me from stepping out with you, not even that greasy bunko artist in there. Not even if you was taking pictures of naked men from here to Kalamazoo.”
Sweet thing.
Cas nods almost imperceptibly. He’s confused by Dean’s outburst. There’s a little hope stirring in him but he doesn’t trust it yet. He waits.
At that, Cas kisses him, kisses and rubs him until Dean’s moaning with it, wriggling under him in frustration, hating how empty he feels. “Please, darlin’, please—“
“Ride me til I can’t see straight?”
“Yeah. Yeah, I—“ Dean shifts up to kneel in front of Cas; he puts a hand on Cas’s shoulder. “Can I touch them?”
“A ranch?”
Hell, if they ain’t wet already, it’s a miracle. Dean closes his eyes and tries to remind himself that he’s a professional. “Anything you want, angel. Anything.”
“Dean. Dean, I’m sorry—“
There’s a familiar fluttering sound and the room is dark again. Dean’s leaning against Cas; the room is spinning. He’s breathing heavily. Cas is gripping him, holding him up.
“Can fuck my mouth if you want,” Dean murmurs. Rolling over is too difficult— just moving his hips is too difficult, but he can keep lying here still while Cas has his way with him. Assuming they don’t fight over it again.
“Yeah,” Dean agrees. “Yeah, I think so, too. Here.”
It’s so good, so big and full and good. Cas goes slowly, dribbling more oil onto them, moving slowly in and out while Dean quivers there, egging him on with eager sounds as they get more and more slick, each movement coming easier, Cas sliding into Dean as easy as if it was God’s own will and driving Dean crazy with how gentle he’s being. Soon—thank God—Cas pulls Dean’s hair, lifts his head up and fucks into him harder, harder,
“I— will you kiss me?”
“Bad?”
Cas stares.
“Nah. Those things’ll kill you.” His momma had smoked, when none of them was looking, though she’d call cigarettes ‘coffin nails’ in front of the kids. They had killed her father, in the end, and Dean had spent more than one sleepless night wondering if they’d been the thing to kill her, too.
Bobby raises an eyebrow at him.
Dean takes the card. It has a personal telegraph number simply labelled McLeod, Boston, MA. “What he done, this guy?” Dean asks.
“If you want to get technical.”
Cas gives him a look like he’s the stupidest man alive.
I mean, yeah. I know that. But we’re already stuck in Chuck’s plan. Doing nothing means being trapped here forever. At least until he gets bored and gets rid of us.
“Freedom is fragile,” Cas agrees. “Perhaps we can only truly appreciate what we have, once it’s lost.”
