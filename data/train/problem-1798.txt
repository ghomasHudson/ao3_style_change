John even suspected him of eating the wrapping paper, because that was the only explanation for how quickly it seemed to be disappearing.
He leaves his laptop on the sofa table in a wordless invitation to crack the password and use it for whatever it is that Sherlock does with laptops during the middle of the night.
He labels his kitchen appliances clearly. With short, precise threats of violence should they come near any disgusting experiments. They both know that this is pointless, but the ritual feels comforting.
“But just think…” John said. “A whole week of total immunity. We could do anything in the world. No consequences. “
"She was one of the top dogs in this organization. She would've remained so, if she hadn't panicked at the murder of her sister, gone underground and contacted me, wondering why her boss had wanted her dead."
And John rose to his feet and dragged his giggling husband to bed and figured that this would probably all work out absolutely fine.
“Ah, well, the night is young,” Sherlock said as he shifted beneath John, his whole body relaxed and his voice languid.
In the end he has it narrowed down by going through the information he copied from the USB-drive. Either she’s going to the Hotel Cecil in Morocco or to a club with no name in Geneva.
“Anyway,” John continued undeterred, “whatever it is, it’s a bit clever. It’s about how Santa always tells you to be good all year, right? But then there’s this whole week at the end of the year which is after Christmas but before the new year. And maybe…well, the wording sort of suggests that this week doesn’t count, doesn’t it? You can do whatever you like without any consequences.”
"Right. Should I call him now, do you think? "Hi, John, this is your best...man, Sherlock. I'm just calling to tell you that I'm not asexual. Tootles!" Something like that? Please, feel free to criticise. This is your script, after all."
This little voice makes the same suggestion every time John makes a decision. It's been whispering in his ear for years. Should he buy yoghurt or regular milk? Well, either is fine - or he could just go home and shoot himself. That sort of thing.
"What does it matter, John?" John jerked in his chair as Sherlock threw down his precious notebook. "What people
That seemed enough for Sherlock, who allowed his eyes to flutter shut and seemed asleep in seconds. John rubbed his temples on his way out to the kitchen, and wondered if he should be calling Mycroft. John
What he didn't know was that Sherlock put two sleeping pills in the tea; that would keep him sleeping for a couple of hours. As they continued to stroll to ‘Molly’s office,’ Greg began to sway, then stumble, and then completely tumble over.
Should I do it? I begin to climb over the fence that separates me from the world. I look down at the water again. It waits for me, its icy hands beckoning me to come closer. I close my eyes. If I jump I’ll never see John again, but if I don't I’ll live a life of misery.
I was too late. John tries to approach me but I begin to slowly back away. Why does my chest hurt? I see the pain in his eyes. Those brown eyes that I loved. I begin to run. I hear John call for me but his shouts sound like whispers. Tears run down my face. It has to be a dream. John would never do this me. Their kiss replays in my head over and over. John loves me. I see his hands touch her body. I keep running, wiping my tears and covering my ears.
The wake is two days later, and I almost don’t go, but Mrs. Hudson drags me with her. I can’t even look at him. I cry the whole time, but the thing that hurts the most is when Mrs. Hudson looks me straight in the eye and says, “John, it’s okay. You couldn’t have done anything. It’s not your fault.”
For the next few days I can’t eat or sleep or think of anything else but that look of heartbreak on his face. I can’t stand to be in the flat anymore; it just reminds me too much of him. It feels so empty without him and his questions. Mrs. Hudson stops by and tries to get me to eat, but it just makes me feel sick. I spend a lot more time outside, and my clothes no longer fit. It is all my fault. Sometimes I think I see him in the crowd with that look of heartbreak. I always chase after him. It’s never him.
We all tell him thanks and goodbyes. I am the last to go up. Everyone watches as I walk up to his casket. The world seems to move in slow motion. When I finally reach it, I can’t help but let out a sob. It hurts to see him like this. I look at his curls, his face, his lips. I try to memorize everything.
A sudden tug on the shoulder brings me out of my trance. I cross the street and almost get hit by a car.
Why hadn’t I thought of it before? It seemed so easy, so logical. There was only one thing left for me to do before I joined him.
John went on his toes and kissed Sherlock right on the tip of his nose. Sherlock then bent down and grabbed his head in return. They stayed like that for a while  in their embrace, breathing each other’s air, and did not break apart.
“John, the reason I was so upset was because I thought I’d lost you forever. That kiss, I thought it meant more than it did, and it broke me. The reason I went looking for you was because I was ready to tell you… ”
I waited for Sherlock all night, but he never came home. How could I have been so careless? I never meant to kiss her. It just happened. When I saw him there, I could see his whole world fall apart. I said that I would explain, but could I really? I had kept my relationship with Mary a secret from him, but why? Whenever he  asked where I was going I wanted to tell him, but the words just wouldn't come.
I see police lights in the distance. I wonder what happened. As Lestrade drives, we head towards the lights.
It was a dream. How stupid could I be? Of course it was. But why does it still hurt? I touch my forehead; there's a bump. I must have hit my head and passed out. Why did it have to be a dream? I look over the edge of the bridge again. Why do the cold waters seem welcoming? It offers an escape from this world, this cruel world of sadness.
Sherlock also watched the people who would come, look at the animals, take pictures, and then leave. They would never stay long. Sherlock came back the next day with a journal, not wanting to miss anything. He looked at the way his light brown fur shone when the light touched it, and he wondered what it would feel like to put his finger through his rough short hair. He sketched out every detail he could, even the huge sweet, chocolate eyes that made his legs feel weak when he gazed straight into them. He could see the sadness within them. All Sherlock wanted to do for Hamish was make him happy. That day he ran home and began to make a plan. He was going to get Hamish out if it was the last thing he would do.
“Why did I never go after you?” I whisper as I sit curled up in his chair, trying to hold on to whatever is left of him. I wish I could hear his voice one more time, feel his touch one more time, and to see his lips one more time. I wish I could do what I have always dreamed of. It’s all my fault.
I wish I could tell him the way I felt. The way I would melt when he looked at me with those crystal blue eyes. The way his laugh would bring butterflies to my stomach. The way his touch would send shocks through my body. That only comes from love.  A love I wish the world could see walk down Baker Street. A love they could see walk down the aisle. A love that would last forever.
At night I cry on and off with the smallest things. When I look at his chair, his clothes, his desk, it all hurts so much. Eventually I would have to tell people what happened. What would they think of me then? I don’t tell everyone what happened till the next day. When they ask for details, my throat closes up and I can’t speak. Every time this happens, I hear his words: ”John, why?”
Sherlock had a plan, but he needed some supplies first: a uniform, keys, and a really good excuse for taking a camel on a walk. He observed the keepers, following one in specific named Greg; that was who he was going to impersonate to get Hamish out. Sherlock also managed to see that on occasion, the keeper would take some animals out of the exhibits and show them to the people. That solved how they would get out. Sherlock smiled at himself as his plan began to come together. Now all he needed to do was carry it out.
John came back and saw the article a couple days later and showed Sherlock. He never told John the real story: how it was he who had taken Hamish out, how he had fallen in love with him, and how Hamish had rejected him. John insisted that they go see it, but Sherlock refused, calling the creature dull, and saying that it had no use but to entertain the people who had yet to see a camel. It hurt Sherlock deep down inside the recesses of his soul. It made him cringe as he said the vile words. Sherlock never did have another forbidden love for an animal as he did with his dear Hamish, and Sherlock never returned to Colchester Zoo.
I grab his shirt and pull him towards me. We kiss. At first, he is stiff, but it only lasts a second. He begins to kiss back. It feels as wonderful as I have imagined. I dont want to, but I pull away. I have to tell him something.
After Lestrade drops me off at the flat, I don’t know what to do. I feel numb inside. I just go and lie on Sherlock’s bed. His smell only makes me cry again. It’s all my fault.
He just parks the car and gets out. I walk behind him as he flashes his badge to go look at what happened.
Sherlock rushed over to the camel exhibit as quickly as he could, somehow managing to avoid the staff members that had arrived. Once he arrived he realized something; he had twenty-odd keys that all looked the same. He didn't want to waste much time because anyone could come back there at any moment. It took him about six minutes to find the right key and realize that he would need a harness for Hamish.
Where would John go? The park. I can't think of anywhere else he would be. As I run, I scan the crowd looking for his face. I have to tell him before he slips away. The song plays over and over in my head. I run faster.
I never understood what they saw; to me, he was my best friend. But now I can see what everyone else did: the way he seemed to stand taller when I was beside him. The way he would always try to impress me. The way that he would look at me with those eyes. The way he got so protective towards me. The way his face would light up when he looked at me with that smile I loved.  And the way he would refuse to let me have a date without his company.
"Perfect!" Sherlock whispered to himself as he dragged the body into the bushes and switch their clothes. Step one - complete.
Hamish was in The Times the next day. The officers interviewed Greg; however, he could not give a good description of the man who had drugged him and left the officers to a dead end. They called it The Great Escape. Hamish made it all the way to Wellington Place and stopped at St John’s Woods
Hamish became aggravated with the strange and lanky Sherlock. All he wanted to do was explore the world. Hamish nudged Sherlock out of the way with his majestic head and began to run. He heard the loud, pained cries of the strange man but never looked back. Sherlock stayed kneeling on the floor, watching as the majestic creature runs off toward the world that is unknown to him.
Sherlock woke up and searched around the room. What had just happened? There was a camel..? He looked to his left to see John looking incredibly handsome in a deep slumber. Sherlock sat up in bed and ran his fingers through his hair, wondering what the hell was going on. John felt the movement of the bed and woke up slowly.
When he finishes, the people who stopped to listen applaud, but I am frozen. The song told a story of how a man let his love go hoping she would return, but she never did. He was never able to let her know how he felt about her.
Sherlock, I know you can't read this now, but I want you to know that I love you, and we will never be apart. Now, let's go have another adventure. I'm beginning to twitch again.
"Lestrade, have you seen Sherlock? He hasn't returned home since last night, and I'm getting concerned."
I let go of the ledge and the last thing I feel is the Thames River's fingers wrapping around me and giving me my escape.
Sherlock stood in the living area looking out of the window, wondering if a case would come in ever. John had left for his honeymoon with Mary and wouldn’t be back for awhile, leaving Sherlock with no one to bother or drug. He had considered conducting another experiment, but what? He couldn’t bring any more body parts into the apartment since Mrs. Hudson had begun to complain, and Sherlock didn’t like to anger her. As he watched the world pass, an idea came to mind. What about an animal? With nothing else to do, he flagged a taxi and went to Colchester Zoo.
Of course John wanted to know. He needed to know how this stood. He needed to get his friendship with Sherlock back on track. He felt like this travesty of a marriage was keeping him from focusing on the future, like he was stuck. And pretending it wasn’t there wasn’t proving as easy as it should be.
At least the risk of discovery – Sherlock has a feeling that there are all sorts of other risks here that might be much greater. But he is now far past the point of no return. The bridge is standing behind them now, the flames reaching for the night sky. The only way now is forward – wherever that may lead.
Sherlock's breathing has sped up a bit and it makes John pretty terrified to realise that even Sherlock is afraid. Crap.
Signs of infidelity. Boring. Pedestrian. Typical. The secrets most of the population carry with them usually are. Sherlock has almost stopped noticing them.
And he had the nerve to stop there. And not say anything more. Just hinting at the fact that John was also married. Alleging, without so many words, that John was cheating. Cheating! On him, no less.
“Come on, Sherlock. We’ll talk in the morning. Or later tonight. Whenever you wake up. Okay? Up you get.”
Hopefully, he decides, this is simply a side effect of him not having had sex for months. That can seriously mess with your head (and John would know - he was in the army).
Typical. Just when John thought his wedding couldn't have been more fake, it turns out that the maid of honour was the sister of the generation's most twisted criminal mastermind.
"Certainly," he says. "So many interesting things you said yesterday. At least eight clues about your future destination. Four about your past. Traces of your real accent, now that I know to look for it, can found in certain words. You probably spent ages on your "S", didn’t you?"
Mostly, he's been picturing everything like it was. There's comfort in that. Almost like they can rewind, and go back to the way things were before the Fall. Take-out on the sofa, joint grocery shopping, arguments about mundane things. Crap TV.
“Within reason,” he found himself saying. He'd long since learned the wisdom of not giving any open promises to Sherlock. And then he regretted the words as soon as he saw some of that interesting light in Sherlock's eye go out.
He is therefore not quite as impressed as the regular person might be when Mary slips into the seat next to him on the tube the next morning, as if she’s just managed to magic up his location in all of London and can stroll up to him like it’s the easiest thing in the world.
“Hmm, let me think. Over the last few years the best Christmas I’ve had was the one where I got dumped on Christmas Eve and where our Christmas party was then interrupted by a trip to the morgue. Not a fun, work trip, but a trip where you knew the dead person personally.” John frowned. “Well, we thought you did, at any rate. And
“Right,” said John. “Just couldn’t think why you’d be here, except to tell me that someone had. Died, that is. Shower, then.” He points to the towel that had landed on the sofa, next to Sherlock.
“Friends apparently behave in all sorts of ways,” Sherlock says, and John’s fingers twitch a little, where they rest in the crease where Sherlock’s thigh meets his hip. Sherlock can feel himself give an answering twist and hates himself for it.
Sherlock came out of the bathroom, his curls damp and his skin flushed, just as John carefully moved the hot cookies from the sheet and on to a plate. He’d put on some Christmas music, the kettle had just boiled and he’d set the table for two.
He can feel the mattress jerk when Sherlock turns to look at him. Can hear his mind working as he examines evidence he probably didn't bother examining when he crawled into bed.
If it was something really urgent, Sherlock wouldn’t have drunk himself into a stupor; he would’ve called John, would’ve put on an elaborate disguise and thrown himself into solving the problem.
John didn’t know where to look or what to feel. The slow suction, the leisurely licking threatened to drive him mad, while the sensations below the belt were nothing like a simple hand job had a right to conjure.
Well. Divorce is the wrong word. He isn't sure if there is a word for what happens to a marriage where one of the participants turns out never to have existed.
There was a silence on the phone, lasting several seconds, no doubt intended to allow John to ponder the foolishness of his entire existence.
And John had done these things before – or things similar to them. But he’d never really noticed it before. Not like this. And he felt sure that Sherlock was noticing it as well. He could see a faint blush on his cheeks when John helped him tape his cast before showering. He could feel him hold his breath as John supported him.
They ate in silence, and John drank wine and looked at the person who could without a doubt be called the man in his life. His partner, his flat-mate, his best friend, his husband. The subject of all his writings and the would-be focus of most of the stories he'd tell when old age had managed to wipe most of his memories away. After weeks of unease John could almost feel the tension leave the room with every bite of food, every sip of wine.
“It’s pronounced “meme,” John. The es are like the ones in “genes.” We’ve been over this. I can’t have a
His voice is raspy, like it hadn't been used for a while. Or if it has been used, it's been misused.
"I thought that was what a relationship was supposed to be?" It’s out before he can stop himself. He’s failing miserably in his vow not to engage with her. "That’s what makes a relationship. A personal connection and a… A sexual connection." He hardly stumbles on the last words – but he does and he knows that she notices.
He’s still tired – so tired – from the last few days and would very much like to be left alone. But here she is. Again.
Handholding hadn't ever really been on their list of appropriate gestures. Except when handcuffed together on the run from the law, of course.
No, John snaps at one of the nurses. It's something innocent - he's not even sure what sets him off. If it's her alluding to the sad demise of his wife (she's one of the ones who sided with Mary during the long weeks when they weren't on speaking terms. She doesn't believe John ever deserved her or deserves to be upset at her supposed death) or if it's her clumsiness, her poorly dyed hair or her frankly annoying shirt.
John was never one to deny himself something delicious. He took careful aim with the slipper and hit Sherlock right where his thighs met his arse, no doubt making his blood flow to all the right places.
He stands up and leaves the tube carriage, grabbing the outraged neighbour’s notebook with him as he goes.
Apparently Mycroft’s mystery assistant didn’t only hate John and Sherlock but also held an intense dislike of otters. That was the only explanation for condemning this poor bugger to live out the rest of his days in 221B.
"I know," said John. "I happened to get married there myself. Lovely place, excellent polar bear, top-notch snow mobiles. Would recommend it to a friend. Sorry you couldn't be there."
"Oh, whatever you want," Sherlock said, still not looking up. "They usually believe whatever tripe you feed them."
Sometimes he suspects that being numb is really the default state of John Watson. Brief interludes of life, laughter and excitement are the exceptions.
To top it off Sherlock was in a right mood, breaking cutlery, torturing his violin and sleeping more than was healthy.
John doesn't consider it "his area" either. Not when no women are involved, at least. Certainly, he's tried things. He happened upon a threesome or two in Uni (who didn't?), but he's never done anything with a man in a one-on-one setting. If sleeping with Sherlock doesn't count. Which, John thinks, it doesn't.
“Sherlock?” he rasped. “I’m going to… I should probably tell you that this is kind of the point of no return, right about now. This will change things. I’m …”
Sherlock considers this. "Paying the rent? Probably not. I doubt it. Can't remember when I last paid a single bill, honestly."
But John would never suspect Sherlock of tricking him into binding agreements just for his own satisfaction. And he felt a bit sick to think that Sherlock would think it of him.
He can almost smell the coals, the lamp oil, the filth of the nineteenth century – which is not a comforting smell on board a small metal tube that’s supposed to carry you high above the ground for thousands of miles.
He wasn’t unusually dim, but living with Sherlock Holmes meant that you tended to be three steps behind.
“Me? Mean?” Sherlock waved a hand, as if wounded by the mere suggestion. “I’m just trying to educate you.”
"Mycroft, get on with it," Sherlock said through thin lips, his eyes still fixed on something John couldn't guess what was outside the window.
. PTSD can result in all sorts of problems in that area that he, apparently, has been spared. That's good.
There it was again. That flicker on Sherlock’s face. And John was suddenly very aware of how close they were sitting to each other. The tone of the conversation had changed and John wasn’t quite sure why or how. He didn’t know what game they were playing but he decided that his next move had to be a calculated gamble.
John chuckles. Lowers his eyes, as Sherlock has seen him do countless of times as he flirts with nameless women in nameless pubs. “Yeah, I’m not really talking about the work, Sherlock.”
"Do - do you mean long term or short term," Sherlock manages to gasp out, a smile playing on his lips.
“I’m sure…” John cleared his throat. “I’m sure that you’ll be able to find a loophole. You usually are. Somehow. In this case I’m guessing you’d be able to persuade the relevant parties to your way of thinking. Maybe about the Santa immunity actually being universal. For those seven days.”
be this tender with his one night stands. Surely he doesn’t cradle their faces like this. It is inconceivable that he’d also make these fragile little noises as he kisses
And then he stalked upstairs to his bedroom. He had some serious thinking to do - but first he needed to take care of an urgent matter in private.
He wants to know which movements elicit which sounds from John. He wants to know what gets him off quickly and how to draw it out. He wants to explore
Of course he'd registered, on some level, that this was way beyond what normal flatmate did. Obviously. He wasn't stupid.
"You're cute when you're all dramatic," she says with a smile as she wraps her scarf around her neck. "Oh, and for the record?" She glances over her shoulder. "We've never really tried the hardcore BDSM stuff, so I wouldn't know about the handcuffs. But given a little more time I'm sure he would've been willing to try a bit more than the traditional blindfolds and ostrich feathers." She winks at him and disappears down the stairs.
was better than the one right after you jumped of a building to your bloody and horrible death…” Sherlock winced but John kept going. “I also seem to remember one where I was recently engaged and had recently discovered that you weren’t dead after all and I was both furious and elated but I had no idea which parts of my life I was furious with and which made me feel elated. So yeah, not a lot of warm fuzzy feelings about Christmas. So I’m reclaiming them. With my list.”
The possibilities are endless, and the fact that Sherlock doesn’t actuallyknow Mary all that well is all encompassing. If he knew her as an agent (“polite term”) he’d have a better idea of her motives, her strategies. But he doesn’t know her. Not really, and that stings a bit.
That's something, he supposes. He had, after all, wondered. What Sherlock’s presence might bring. He hadn’t worried, but the thought had occurred. He'd wondered if there was a reason why Sherlock hadn't gone back to Baker Street. And all in all it is preferable that no mad criminals might turn up at his door. No others than Sherlock, that is.
At this short notice they can only get business-class seats, which is just as well for such a long flight. John is quick to order a drink while Sherlock makes do with peanuts.
"Well, it turns out," sighed Mycroft, "that the lawmakers of your hosts made a small clerical error."
He could remember holding his mum's hand on a number of occasions. The first day at school, in the crowds downtown before Christmas, when walking on the beach during some holiday. But he could  never remember holding his dad's hand. But there - at the end - he had. When his dad seemed beyond both hearing and seeing and was slowly slipping away, John had held his hand. Just to reassure them both that he wasn't facing the journey ahead alone.
If she is going, then she'll go and there is nothing anyone can do to stop her. It was, after all, painfully obvious that she'd never be happy playing John Watson's housewife in the long run. So it's better this way.
"I know." Sherlock still didn’t seem to find the conversation more interesting than the bees. It was starting to get on John’s nerves.
Most of the business class is asleep, including the woman across the aisle. There is plenty of room between the rows. The engines are loud. The risk should be minimum.
"In prison. In America. Unlikely ever to see the daylight again. The CIA was most pleased when Mycroft returned her to them."
He just stood there, waiting for it to happen. His lips might have parted. His head might even have tilted upwards a smidge.
John sounds reasonable. He doesn’t sound drunk, he sounds confident and cocky. Like he has seen something he wants and he’s – finally – decided to take it.
Sherlock’s lips were warm, his tongue soft and his taste… Christ, John prided himself on having a way with words but his brain was going offline.
His eyes glide away from John, these days. Always focusing on something just to the side of him, a little bit behind him.
It doesn't help. Sherlock stiffens, and John becomes very aware of the fact that he's practically standing in Sherlock's arms.
But he doesn't succumb to the suggestion. Not right now, he whispers back to the voice. Maybe in a bit.
"A favour to John?" She smiles almost sadly. "I'm not sure John will see it like that. He'll probably wish he could've snapped the handcuffs on me himself, once he finds everything out."
It's not a date, he tells himself. He's just being nice. He's thanking Sherlock for taking care of him for the past few weeks.
Another option, a little voice whispers, is to go for the nightstand drawer. To go for his gun. To take the option that would neatly solve all of his problems, once and for all.
But he doesn't kick Sherlock out either. When night falls John turns off the telly, goes to a closet and recovers a blanket that he hands to Sherlock.
The wedding night was spent in a high chase on snowmobile. The next afternoon they flew back to London, pleased with a job well done and a handsome fee from Mycroft in the bank. The event was hardly spoken of again, except in jest, when fighting over money or household chores.
He thinks he can see a flicker of hurt flit across her face at the mention of the pregnancy. But only for a moment.
. Could you just... I don't know. Don't be a prick? I wouldn't want to have to put you on my naughty list.” John winked at Sherlock who ducked his head and... Blushed?
Something was wrong. And he had a feeling that a sober Sherlock would be even less informative than the drunk one.
Obviously - in retrospect. Lots of things became obvious, when the last agents in Moriarty’s network used their final efforts to produce mass-panic with that little broadcasting stunt.
It isn't much. Clothes, mostly, that he fits in suitcases (he really perfected his shirt-folding during his short stint as an urban cyclist). Kitchen appliances. Books. And in the smallest box of all he fits his wedding album and a small, white teddy bear. As he tapes the box shut he isn’t sure if he'll ever open it again. But he'd like the option.
Oh, god, oh, god, oh, god. His hips are pressed stupidly close to Sherlock and it wasn't a problem a few seconds a go, but now that he has realised, it's very, very quickly becoming a problem.
So John tried again to broach the subject he’d been dwelling on all night. Because he needed to wrap his head around it somehow.
Sherlock had stopped pretending to be confused and now looked honestly confused. "You want to tell people because we…
Of course he told them that Sherlock was his husband. In this instance it was both a useful and relevant fact, and no need to feel shy around it. It was practical – and John Watson prided himself on being a practical-minded man.
The next morning Sherlock is gone and John doesn't know if he should be furious or relieved. Like so often these days, he settles the matter by not feeling anything at all.
"A post-nup, then,” John clarified. “Isn't your brother supposed to be clever about these things? I’m sure he could rig something up. You're much better off than I am. What if we fall out before the whole mess can be cleaned up and I decide to use the divorce proceedings to fleece you to the bone?"
The flat was dark when he stumbled in and he staggered into the kitchen and sat down. He didn't know if Sherlock had gone out or was simply hiding in his bedroom. It seemed unlikely that he was asleep.
Now that they both know that this isn't a temporary arrangement, it feels even more intimate. It's lovely. Domestic and... Comforting.
He snuggles into the pillow, inhaling deeply. It smells of nothing much, but he imagines that he can detect a trace of Sherlock's shampoo.
John chuckled. This was nice. Just sitting here, teasing each other, drinking questionable tea and listening to Christmas music. It had been one hell of a year, but it was almost over now and it looked like they’d make it through it okay. More than okay. Back together in Baker Street.
And John glides his hands into Sherlock's hair and this is all so wonderfully simple - not complicated at all, not something that makes everything messy, but something that helps John make sense of everything else.
Three continents, John thought distantly. Countless relationships. A marriage. And still – still this felt new. And exciting.
He was rewarded with a whimper. This time there was no doubt about it, sherlock arched his back into the blows, offering up the underside of his bottom.
John now flattered himself that he knew a thing or two about loving someone. A big part of it was helping your loved one when they were struggling. To make the hard things easy for them. Sherlock had already taken them this far. He didn’t need to take them the rest of the way by himself.
"Seriously, I don't know why you insist on coming to have these talks, Mary. You clearly don’t require my input for them."
Well, yes, he did. He knew his way around a hospital; as a doctor, a family member and a patient. So he read Sherlock's file, he fiddled with the bed-settings, he sent texts to Mycroft and Lestrade updating them on the situation (“upsetting but not dire”). And then - then he waited. He sat there and waited next to the man he'd just declared his husband.
It varies, how good John is at ignoring the little voice. He recognises that he might not be in the best frame of mind right now to deal logically with it.
It’s tricky, touching John to his heart’s content at the same time John is touching him. The sensory input is overwhelming.
John grit his teeth and carried on. He found a recipe he liked the look of, he went to the shops and he gathered the supplies. He also placed in his basket a tiny, stupidly expensive box of chocolates that he intended to place on top of the refrigerator as the promised reward for good behaviour.
“Why?” asked Sherlock, not even pretending to ask what John was referring to. “You didn’t do anything wrong.”
"I want everything," Sherlock whispers against his mouth and his hands are everywhere, stroking John's sides, ghosting the top of his arse, gently twisting his nipples.
The man in front of them has completely given up on his Sudoku and appears to be taking notes from their conversation.  A wannabe writer, then. Delightful.
He nods as he heads for the shower. When he gets back, Sherlock has already ordered the Chinese food.
"Nightstand," Sherlock gasps. His eyes have closed and his head is thrown back, and John has started to wonder if he'd be able to come from nipple play alone. But that's a theory to test at a later time, now he wants to get Sherlock out of his pyjama bottoms. He wants to smell, he wants to touch and possibly even taste.
There wasn’t really room for the hand to move up further. It was pretty high up to begin with, and Sherlock can – to his shame – feel himself hardening. A blush steals over his cheeks and he shakes his head.
“I married Mary Morstan,” John says evenly. “Then it turned out that she wasn’t actually Mary Morstan, but she was okay with being Mary Watson. She promised. The woman we’re following now is not Mary Watson. We’re not following the woman I married.”
"And that, my friend, is suggesting asexuality." She winks, like they're a couple of schoolgirls, snickering at a sleepover. "But you're not asexual, Sherlock."
And he hated that he was thinking about it, he was thinking about watching naked men because of his conflicted emotions towards the man he lived with, and simultaneous thoughts about Sherlock and nakedness didn’t lead to anything good.
And that's how they end up squeezed together in the wannabe Mafia's wardrobe. While ritualistic killers hold what sounds like a routine staff meeting.
“I know they do,” John says with a smile. A wild, predatory smile that is so out of place in this conversation that Sherlock’s teeth hurt.
"Sherlock!" John is speaking through his teeth, battling the urge to tear at his hair. "We agreed. No aiding and abetting criminals! No matter how interesting the puzzle!"
“Sure I can. I have someone who I understand is at my beck and call.” Sherlock smiled. “I’ll remote control you.”
He was getting good at therapy. He held nothing back but rather told her, in an organized manner, everything about the touching and the tea making and the Tinder-fiasco and how being not-divorced from Sherlock was somehow very different from being not-married to him.
John made quick work of the belt, the button, the flies. And he didn’t even hesitate, before tugging Sherlock’s trousers down, John-not-gay-Watson couldn’t wait to get his hands, lips, mouth on what was underneath.
"Would the two of you grow the fuck up and stop acting like a pair of toddlers?" John could sometimes muster the patience for dealing with people who seemed stuck in a 30 year old relationship rut. This was not one of those times.
There was no conflict in this. Nothing foreign or alien. Just joy and relief. And arousal. Quite a bit of that.
But that's not the thing that really gets John. The thing that really gets him is the look of... relief? Like the other shoe has finally dropped.
"So, Mycroft has Janine, the whole thing has been shut down, and no member of the Moriarty family is any concern of ours anymore?"
There's the evidence that Sherlock... Well, that Sherlock is truly interested in this. That Sherlock's "transport" is just as fickle as the next body, that Sherlock can be a slave to the baser emotions just like the rest of us.
“Nothing. Just one of those memes on Facebook.” John was slouched low in his chair, his new tablet in his lap. It was quiet in 221B Baker Street, the fuss following Christmas had died down and in its place was a cosy calm. John Watson felt pretty content about things. He was even optimistic about getting the hang of using the tablet before the year was over.
But Sherlock persisted, even though the alcohol was clearly about to overpower him. For a recovering addict he had a surprisingly low tolerance. “Promise, John? It really wasn’t my fault.”
He wasn’t really that surprised to find a black car waiting for him outside the clinic at the end of the day.
Sherlock grins, draws his legs under himself and ducks his head. "Oh, John, you wouldn't believe how clever."
Of all the things that should’ve been dwelling on – this is the thing he voices there in the darkness. And feels like the world’s greatest prick the moment the words leave his lips.
“Sherlock, we agreed. I’m making an effort. Is it really too much to ask that you sit down for four fucking minutes and eat a bloody cookie? Seriously?”
The pack was almost over, he’d switch back to his regular old PG tips soon enough and the thought was bittersweet. Normality and routine was nice, but this had actually been the best Christmas John could remember. He’d miss it, in the greyness of January.
John Watson. Even on his worst days he can provide simple, practical insights that Sherlock never would’ve reached without him.
And John can't help it, he smiles widely as he pushes his hips upwards, and who cares about being gay or straight or whatever? Sherlock wants him. Wants him just as much as John wants him, if the licking and kissing of his neck is anything to go by.
Only, in this case they could poke as much as they liked and would find everything as perfectly legal and proper as anyone might wish. It was of no matter to them if John and Sherlock were the type of couple that didn't hold hands.
He won't be able to talk to John until she's gone. He can't look him in the face and pretend that he doesn't know that his world is about to crash.
John wasn’t all that hungover the next day. He hadn’t been all that drunk. But he was still consumed with a vague but unmistakable feeling of guilt, the sort he usually only experienced after an epic bender, when he didn’t quite remember what he’d done, but guessed he had some pretty serious apologising to do.
Maybe Mary would even agree. Actions must have consequences. She abandoned John, she drugged Sherlock – she went behind her words. Maybe she’d even agree that she has no claim on this moment.
John moves up the bed, to slump next to Sherlock and they look at each other - John still covered in come, Sherlock red-faced and flustered. And then they break out in giggles - like they have so many times before, but never like this. And this shared moment of joy, more than anything, convinces John that this will be okay. This will be more than okay, this will take their previous friendship and amplify it. It will strengthen their bond and it will - well - it will most certainly provide John with the best sex of his lifetime.
"I've done that," Mary says, echoing his thoughts. "I was with him, before. I can tell you what he needs."
John considered making him count, but frankly, he had more sensory input at the moment than he knew what to do with. Right now, he just wanted to focus on getting through this thing.
As John finished speaking their eyes met and something shifted in the room. Something in the wording, something in the touch, something tilted.
"But I'm fairly certain that the flat remains as it was. Mrs. Hudson would hardly evict me without sending as much as a text."
Maybe - John thought - maybe this urge had also something to do with the whole "husband" thing. He felt like he'd scammed his way to this hospital bed and he needed to keep up his cover so that no one would suspect him of trickery and look too closely into things.
It felt strange – body parts didn’t belong in people’s mouths. It went against something primal – but it also felt absurdly right. John struggled to make everything fit, to keep moving and keep sucking and not making a total fool of himself by choking. He allowed one of his hands to slip behind Sherlock and he grabbed his arse. He could feel Sherlock’s muscles straining, like he was fighting the urge to thrust – to fuck John’s mouth – and that was even hotter than all the rest.
Probably the unprofessionalism, he tells himself, but he's a bit worried that the other parts might also play a part.
How dares she? Sadness? How can she act like a devoted wife heroically admitting that her husband loves another, when she herself has never uttered a true word within their marriage? It’s absurd.
“Yeah, but I’d like your help.” John purposefully didn’t use the word family, but it was there, just at the tip of his tongue and he imagined that Sherlock could sense it lurking there.
“John, I probably should've said... I should've said sometime today that I'm sorry.” Sherlock broke eye-contact at the words. Words he normally used so sparingly but offered now.
Sherlock didn’t open his eyes. But he nodded. They were so close that John could smell his skin. He could feel his shuddering breath, he could see the flush on his cheeks.
He doesn't care for this constant comparison. He doesn't like thinking too much about what things were like for John while he was away.
“I'm not. I'm merely pointing out the factors that are already in place, clear to steer the whole thing into its inevitable destruction.”
A flight attendant walks past them and eyes John’s hand warily. She’s approximately 35 years old, has been doing this job far longer than she initially intended and has started to despair that she’ll ever hold down a “real job” on the ground. She has no future here, no future down there and if there’s one thing she isn’t keen on it is giggling city boys intent on joining the Mile High Club.
surprised to find Mycroft and Sherlock both inside, Sherlock staring at the floor, Mycroft looking annoyed. Even more annoyed than usual. John couldn't actually remember seeing the brothers in quite this close proximity before. It was unsettling.
They go, solve the case, get the sample, and a good time is had by all. (All apart from the poor sod who was murdered with a ballpoint pen, obviously.)
Sherlock's skin is warm under his fingers, and John cradles his best friend’s face, his thumb stroking his chin.
He doesn't remember any of the journey home, but he knows that when he gets there he's furious to find the flat empty.
He pulled back from the kiss, and Sherlock responded by drifting down to his neck, kissing, licking and biting until John’s knees threatened to give out - and John wasn't even the one recovering from devastating injuries.
Sherlock is certainly overwhelmed. The kiss, sweet and soft is also incredibly erotic, what with John’s hand being just millimetres way from Sherlock’s straining erection.
The following morning John felt like he was acting in a boring, hyper-realistic indie film as he and Sherlock sat in silence at the kitchen table, rigidly going through the motions of a shared meal without speaking.
“Can you dismantle a USB drive like that?” John asks, gesturing to the A.G.R.A. stick as he hangs up on Molly, who has – rather pathetically – said that she has nothing on for the next few weeks and can take Rosie whenever. “Without damaging it, I mean?”
He heaved on Sherlock’s arm and managed to raise him to an upright position. This close he could see every line in Sherlock’s dejected frown and John felt the tug of real worry. Sherlock had a flair for drama – especially when it came to his brother – but most of it was bluster. He didn’t usually look this… defeated.
“John,” Sherlock grabbed John’s wrist like a vice. “John, you must believe me. It really wasn’t a scheme. I didn’t know! I know you think I always know everything…”
He reads the news sites, takes a shower, nibbles on whatever he finds in the kitchen. And then, in the silence, he comes to a decision.
Sherlock was looking at John over the rim of his book and John realised that he’d just chuckled out loud.
But... They didn't. They didn't touch. They weren't the sort of matey friends who kept grabbing each other in one armed hugs, doling out slaps on the back like they were nothing.
Only, they don't let go. They don't let go of each other's fingers and John isn't sure if it's Sherlock holding his fingers or John holding Sherlock's fingers but there they are, holding hands across the bed in the darkness.
He made fun of the chocolate chip cookies - and then proceeded to eat them all during the middle of the night.
Sherlock was making. Christ. They were sounds of disbelief, sounds of interest, sounds of greed. Of course Sherlock would be greedy in this situation, John thought with a gasp, as Sherlock’s lips locked over his pulse point. His eyes fluttered shut and he moaned helplessly when Sherlock slid a hand under his jumper and over his skin.
They were sitting in their chairs, like so many times before, when Sherlock spoke. John was deeply immersed in his novel and hadn’t been thinking about phones, women or sex so he needed a moment to make sense of the sentence.
John and Mary had spent quite a bit of at Baker Street both before and after Rosie’s birth. Sherlock wasn’t used to people in his personal space – at least not people other than John. But it had been… good. Different than before, but good.
"Let's go out. Angelo's. My treat." John has, after mulling things over, decided that erections aside, he should try to step up his game in the friend-department. He hasn’t been a very generous friend for the past few weeks and he wants to start changing that.
Naturally, John muses, this unexpected good night-time behaviour might have something to do with the fact that Sherlock hardly ever sleeps. So maybe he just stays awake all night, concentrating on not being an annoying bedmate?
When he walks into his living room and finds a dirty, dishevelled consulting detective on Mary's sofa he simply rubs his temples, gives a short nod and keeps on going into the bathroom where he proceeds to have his customary post-work shower. When he walks out again, he finds Sherlock still in the same position on the sofa.
“John, I'm... I'm terribly sorry to have to inform you, but Father Christmas...” Sherlock faked wiping a tear from his cheek. “He... He didn't make it. I'm sorry. The… It was the laws of physics that got him in the end. It was… It was ugly, I’m told.”
The clock took bloody ages to inch towards five, when John finally felt justified in taking a stiff drink himself.
Sherlock's leg was much better. The cast on his arm had come off. He no longer needed intimate assistance. They hadn't stood this close for days.
And Sherlock is glad that he's made it to John’s pectorals before John’s small hand slides into his underwear. Because from that moment on, Sherlock cannot think and cannot act. He shivers in John’s half-embrace, kissing him blindly and his fingers, always looking for something to fiddle with, can busy themselves with John’s nipples. And John doesn’t seem disappointed that this is all Sherlock can do. On the contrary – John sounds perfectly pleased about the development.
John had never spent much time thinking about cocks. He didn’t know what was considered normal, what was considered desirable. He’d never got around to looking at that gay porn, after all.
They walked up 221B in silence and didn’t talk about it. John made a point of not being in around dinner, so the idea of sharing a meal wouldn’t come up. He sat alone in a dingy pub and munched on soggy chips and felt sorry for himself.
Sherlock can’t help but wonder if this is the sort of kiss that John has long since perfected for first dates. Intended to reassure and excite in equal measure. The thought upsets him more than he would’ve guessed.
And behind those secret thoughts are the ones that Mary whispers in his ear. The filthy thoughts. The ones that suggest that John would be everything Mary promises. That Sherlock could, somehow, have everything John Watson has to offer. That Sherlock could taste him everywhere and learn all his sounds.
“THAT THEY’RE NOT BARBARIANS!” Sherlock bellowed with unexpected force and then deflated just as quickly, looking young, lost and very, very, drunk.
And he's off. Describing digital tracking, mad chases, endless deductions and a fiery showdown, where Janine (Janine!) was apprehended, operating the whole thing from her cottage in Sussex Downs.
"Mary, you do actually know who my brother is," he says later that night when she turns up later that night. "And what he does?"
But still. Still - John couldn't stop looking at those long fingers, usually engaged with something or another, now slack and idle. The palm open, like it was waiting to be filled.
"Do you think that's likely," asks Sherlock and John has to agree that no, it doesn’t seem likely. Although it will probably take a while to get the flow of baked goods up to previous levels, if he's been financially starving an elderly widow, maternal relationship or not.
are you trying to ruin Christmas?” he asked. He took care not to sound mad, because he didn’t want to start a row, just curious.
But all this wondering makes his head hurt. Thinking about Sherlock suggests that he should be thinking about a host of other things that he's been ignoring. John really can't deal with any of that at the moment.
John grabbed one of the kitchen chairs and slammed it on the floor with a loud bang when he repositioned it. Sherlock twitched at the sound.
It's shock and joy and shyness all wrapped into one, making it impossible for John to do anything other than shifting until he can wrap his lips around it, flicking his tongue over it while Sherlock makes shallow gasping sounds again and again.
“It’s a bit like making out on the sofa when you’re a teenager,” John says with a relaxed grin as he allows his hand to sneak under the Belstaff. “Or maybe the back seat of a car.”
John wonders, then. He wonders about his friend, as he hasn't allowed himself to wonder about anything for months. He wonders what Sherlock is thinking when he comes into John's bed every night. He wonders what he does in the day. He wonders about Moriarty and the work and 221B.
"Yes, well, not everything is within my control, Sherlock. I might have been able to warn you if you'd told me of this scheme before you carried it out, but after the fact..."
He jolted when he felt the hesitant touch of fingers near the hem of his jumper. His breath hitched and his own hands reacted before he could make a conscious decision. He fumbled for Sherlock’s shirt, timidity quickly giving way for urgency.
But he doesn't go back too late. Both because he needs to get up early in the morning, but also because he doesn't want Sherlock to go to bed without him. If Sherlock has gone to his bedroom and - and even closed the door - what would John do then? Knock? Or go upstairs for the first time for weeks?
She continues. "You know that you love him, don't you? And that he loves you? Utterly, completely, wholeheartedly, the lot of it? And I really don't mean that in a platonic sense."
“Odd topic, for a conversation, wouldn’t you say?” Sherlock asked and as he spoke, John could see his teeth and a hint of a pink tongue.
At least not if Rosie’s regular daytime nanny will be promised as well, making it possible for her to go to work.
He's even sent Nurse Idiot a letter of apology, at Ella's suggestion. Sarah called him later that day, seemingly overjoyed to get some sign that he hadn't gone completely round the bend. She’d clearly been worried that she might never reclaim this particular member of staff.
was, by far and large, the best Christmas I’ve had recently. The one where you murdered someone in cold blood wasn’t really special. I think it might’ve been worse than the one I spent in my bedsit and looked up ways of killing myself after being sent home from Afghanistan. And even
John was not good at making tea. If he stood in the kitchen and watched the pot his patience would usually give out too soon and the tea tasted like hot water with a hint of tea. If he allowed himself to wander out to the living room to kill the time before pouring the tea into cups – well, then he usually got distracted and ended up with over-steeped tea, strong enough that you needed shovel it into your mouth with a spoon.
And in a move that was the most outrageous thing John Watson had ever done – he reached out his hand and touched Sherlock’s cheek with his fingertips.
Not John Watson, it turned out. The dough didn’t rise and then the Youtube videos about how to actually make the naan proved beyond him, but they had some frozen ones that turned out okay when he put them in the toaster.
He'd understood the playfulness in their interaction. Been intrigued at Sherlock's obvious interest in punishment.
"Yes, I imagine he loves you still," he says, his sentences as stiff as his posture, there upon the roof of 221B with the woman who won John Watson's heart and tried to murder Sherlock.
"Oh, Sherlock. I'm a professional through and through." And she grins like a very self-satisfied shark.
(Mary would've liked that, he thinks as he gathers everything up. Would've said it's out of character, though.)
His overwhelming sense of relief when John slides back into his seat and does away with the armrest between them is slightly embarrassing.
So John tries not to think about it too much. It's rather disturbing and he tries to avoid things that are disturbing these days.
John had never really understood the phrase about going weak in the knees – but he did now. The sheer relief of it was mind-boggling. It felt like they were releasing more than a century of pent up emotion and desire. He felt dizzy, overcome – and incredibly, overwhelmingly aroused and happy at the same time.
And John could see it coming a mile away. The words gave him fair warning, the fingers that slowly inched under his button-up, the lips that carefully moved closer, all giving John all the time in the world to move away.
He managed to drag Sherlock to his room, and dumped him on the bed. He pulled off his socks, and pulled a blanket over him, and was about to head to the kitchen for a much needed cup of tea when Sherlock grabbed his wrist.
“Like what?” Sherlock asked, sounding like a petulant child, his head cocked to the side. Like he was suggesting that there was nothing John could do to him that would matter one bit. Like there was nothing John could do that would matter to him.
“Santa,” Sherlock said, “sounds, in this case, more like my brother than any benevolent distributor of judgment with questionable dress sense. Which is a chilling thought.”
His annoyance flares again at the sight of her - clearly Olive ran straight from the room to tattle. Little idiot. Sarah is wearing an expression of soothing understanding and is clearly ready to talk him down from a towering fury. Like he’s an over-excited school-boy.
But those thoughts are - as they've always been - forbidden. But now even the very awareness of them is tainted. They, the most private of musings, feel as if Mary has her fingerprints all over them.
"Fine.” John closes his eyes and counts to ten. Tries again. “Hey, Sherlock? Let's stay in. Instant noodles. My treat."
(John objected to that wording, as it suggested that he had at any point been either of those things. Ella said that this was standard phrasing in cases of people who'd thrown more than one cup of hot liquid within the span of one hour.)
Reginald the otter munched on his herring, grabbed his favourite stone and decided to take a short nap as the humans had finally left him alone. Then, he thought, he might start plotting his escape from this blasted cage. He was sure he'd heard somewhere recently that these days there was some sort of an immunity deal going on.
“But hasn’t there been…anyone?” John suspected he was messing this up, but asking Sherlock straight out seemed impossible.
“I told you what I expected of you, I told you why this was important to me, and in return you were rude and inconsiderate,” John told Sherlock. “You also highlighted that there isn’t much I could do to you that you wouldn’t just completely disregard. So I’m not going to give you a chore, I’m not going to make you sit on the naughty step, I’m not going to take any of your things away. You’re right. It wouldn’t work. So we’re dealing with this right here, right now.”
But for now John’s hand rests in his and he has vague promises of a future to tuck into the most secret parts of his mind palace.
“Yeah, sure, it’s a thankless job trying to civilise me, I’m sure everyone wishes I could be just a bit more like you, eh?”
He once thought they could be friends, he and Mary. He liked her, like he so rarely liked people. He'd even admired her, when he realised how thoroughly she'd duped him - him! But then he realised that she would leave. And his admiration and his liking of her evaporated. Although he can still see the traits that he admired, he can’t find much warmth in his heart for Mary Morstan.
Sherlock's arm slips around his waist and tightens there, and they both hold their breaths as the wannabe-mafia members file out of the room, not one of the bothering to open the wardrobe.
He wonders how long she’s been lurking at the station just to make this supposedly grand entrance. He finds it a bit pathetic – and that cheers him up quite a bit.
His trembling is now worse than ever - both in his bad hand and everywhere else. He can see a few options. He could get started on ruining everything in this beige hell that reminds him of Mary. He admits to himself that this will probably result in a house fire. He takes that into consideration and files the suggestion for later.
He just cares about the fact that John Watson is unbuttoning his jeans under Sherlock’s coat and inviting Sherlock to join him underneath it. Sherlock is allowed to touch John like this, is allowed to circle John’s cock in his hand and experiment.
"Off," he mutters and pulls at the shirt, and Sherlock complies easily, seemingly not wanting to do anything that might delay matters.
Not into John’s room, he notices. Sherlock piles everything in the living room, as if to allow John himself to decide the next step. Like he’s unsure into which bedroom he should move John’s things.
Before Sherlock dashes off with his meeting with Mary, he tries to offer John some words of comfort.
It had taken John a long while to realise how vulnerable his friend really was, but he knew that Sherlock was afraid of many things. He was afraid of being alone, of being abandoned. Afraid of people suspecting that he actually had feelings. Afraid of being vulnerable.
Well. He might be ready to give up on love. Maybe. But he isn't ready to give up on sex just yet, thank you very much.
John hadn’t thought about it much before now. Not at all, really. But now he found himself wondering about it. How long had it been? Short – he was sure of that. Had any parts of them touched other than their lips? He couldn’t remember. He wasn’t sure if either of them reached out a hand to the other one’s face. Or if the kiss had happened in a half-way hug. Had there maybe been a tentative hand on his waist? He wasn’t sure.  When he thought back to the moment all he could remember was their shared mirth, the twinkle in Sherlock’s eye over how outrageous they were, how audacious.
His hand was already in the air, flying downwards for the fifth smack when he fully registered that he was hard.
And he could list all the thoughts that came up in his head. About how this could ruin them, could ruin their friendship, how John had never done anything with a man before and might mess this up and how Sherlock was probably horrible relationship material and….
John shrugged it off as he winced in sympathy as Donovan struggled past them, looking vaguely green and heading for the loos.
Sherlock knows all about surveillance. He knows how tedious it is, how time consuming, how – sometimes – downright humiliating it is.
“I didn’t?” Sherlock asked and John could feel his heart clench a little bit at the tone of voice. The surprise.
And when they finally touched, when their lips finally met, there, in their own kitchen, far away from any bearded men and long-dead polar bears – then John felt sure that they had never kissed before. Because surely – surely – this was no repetition, because John had never felt anything like this from a single kiss. Every point of contact between them was electrified, his hands frantically grabbed at Sherlock, with one going for his neck and the other one sliding around his back.
Sherlock continues. “She was quicker than I was to figure it out, and finding Janine. So while she wasn't a part of this particular plot when it started, she joined Janine in the end. Mary always knew when to change sides, if needed.”
“Wait, so law enforcement is in on this immunity deal with Santa?” Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “The plot thickens.”
"I get it," she says after a while, “that you're not ready to talk about this to other people. But, Sherlock? You
He nuzzles John's skin, he sniffs his most private spots, he both nibbles and kisses the flesh. And John has certainly tried -
John had probably never rolled his eyes as hard as he did the day Sherlock told him, that due to “unforeseen circumstances,” they needed to get married. Within a glacier. With a stuffed polar-bear in attendance, the ceremony officiated by a mumbling, bearded man in a primitive-looking robes.
They’ve never talked about why Sherlock isn’t staying at 221B. John has assumed that some unhappy friends of Magnusson might be dogging Sherlock’s every step, waiting for their opportunity for revenge.
“It’s been good, this,” John says to him in a low voice. Sherlock feels sure that no one can hear them over the din of the engine but he still flinches at the words and scans their neighbours for listeners. “It’s been good,” John continues. “Being together, again.”
He stands up once the cigarette has been smoked down to the filter and returns to the flat. Surely there is something in his inbox that can distract him for a while. At least going through the incoming cases will kill some time.
What he does is drag off most of his clothes, swallow a couple of his sleeping pills, and crawl into bed. Not on his usual side of the bed, but on Mary's side. What has, very recently, somehow become Sherlock's side of the bed.
"Christ, Sherlock," he pants, as Sherlock moves up the bed and a lube-slicked hand slides in front of him and grabs his throbbing penis.
Only… The dots didn’t make any sense. Why would Sherlock worry that John would suspect him of purposefully trapping John in a marriage they couldn’t get out of?
He makes a grab for the nightstand, rummages about for the bottle of lube and as he twists away from Sherlock, he can feel him go for his back.
But Sherlock doesn't answer, but rather moves quickly, flipping John onto his back, looming over him with wonder in his eyes.
After Mary – after John moved back to 221B – he started drinking Sherlock’s tea again. Now, when Sherlock was injured, he felt irritable and frustrated whenever the urge for a cuppa came over him. Sure, Mrs. Hudson was more than willing to fuss over them, but it wasn’t the same. She brought up the tea when
"As I was saying," John said with an exaggerated sigh, "I know some things, but not much. For example, I was thinking...since I met you, you've never gone out with anyone."
"I'm heading to bed," John says with a deliberate head-tilt towards Sherlock's room. And then waits.
"So, to paraphrase - No." He huffs a humourless laugh. He doubts she’s told John about the baby either.
Sherlock always follows him to bed. Sherlock, who hardly needs sleep, always goes to bed when John does, and stays there the whole night.
to get us sorted," Sherlock said. "That was the whole point of him. He promised to get this undone. Quickly."
Grown men aren’t supposed to feel phantom aches at the sight of their... Damn it, he doesn’t even know what to call Sherlock in his own mind.  Aren’t people supposed to leave this sort of drama behind in their teenage years?
But still, this felt like he was touching Sherlock for the first time. His fingertips tingled where they touched the warm skin.  A soft whimper escaped Sherlock when John allowed his fingers to trace his jawline all the way back to the thin, sensitive skin of his neck and then glide into Sherlock’s curls.
The hand on John’s arse certainly wasn’t motivating him to get up and move anywhere, but he still struggled to his feet, tugging Sherlock with him.
He can recognise what he's doing. He can watch himself avoid thinking about the main topic that's crowding his head. He knows that he's focusing on Mary because that allows him to ignore the big issue. The thing that he spends most of his time thinking about how he shouldn't be thinking about it.
“You seemed to think that I’d assume you’d somehow…” John fumbled for words. “That you’d somehow planned this? Despite knowing what would happen?”
Obviously she's expecting to shock him, by suggesting… That. She's hoping for him to jerk his head up in surprise, to gasp to deny the feelings she's assigning him.
"Right," says Sherlock softly and John illogically feels as if he's just thrown a mug full of cold tea in his face.
But it is. It really is. Because John seems happy to be there with him. He doesn’t look like a man with no conscience, he doesn’t look like a man hell-bent on revenge. He looks like Sherlock’s John Watson, smiling and aroused. And Sherlock can’t keep up with all the new micro expressions on John’s face, they’re flitting across it faster than Sherlock can catalogue them. And right now it doesn’t really matter if this will never happen again – Sherlock feels sure that he’ll be able to survive on this for the rest of his days. The memory of this will be enough.
He snorts. "Favour. He is, as a courtesy to John - and therefore as a courtesy to me - giving you a little head-start. Make no mistake, I'm sure he'll give his foreign counterparts all the information he's gathered on you to aid them in your capture, but he's not going to make the arrest himself. Not if he can avoid it. And he can't avoid it if you insist on hanging around on his doorstep. So Mary?" He steps into her personal space and whispers in her ear. "Scoot!"
"Things will be more complicated for John this time around." She looks worried. Honestly worried - as if John is any of her concern. "Sure, the last time he was plenty conflicted. Survivor's guilt. And lots of... " she waves her hand almost dismissively, "feelings."
Perfectly natural, if a bit embarrassing. Especially if you're sleeping next to the world's most observant man.
They are silent on the way to Baker Street. John realises when he sits in the back of the Cab, the traffic gradually slowing the car down, that he hasn't been to the city centre for months. And he's missed it. It feels easier to breathe here. He can feel his focus expanding a bit from his personal hell.
Honestly – everyone agreed that his first marriage had been a royal fuck-up. Was it too much to ask that his second one would unfold in the manner it was supposed to?
That first touch of lips is enough to tell John everything he needs to know about what sex with Sherlock, a relationship with Sherlock, a life with Sherlock will be.
Sherlock seems to understand the phantom of candles in the room, though, when he looks at the table John has set for them. His eyes linger on the table, as if to figure out what is missing.
Surely the city’s exterminators were in on the thing? He'd heard the Thames was lovely this time of year.
It had now been a whole day of knowing that he was married to Sherlock Holmes and John had no idea why he felt so unsettled. Why it bothered him more to learn that he was married to Sherlock than the actual wedding ever had.
All he knows is that John is kissing him – finally. And it doesn’t feel like horniness or revenge. It feels soft and full of promise.
Something had been changing between them for a while. Something unspoken, something inevitable had been on the brink of happening for weeks. Months, even. Perhaps years.
"Me staying never would've been enough for him." As if she's suggesting some fault with John - John!
He moves a bit and puts his hand on Sherlock's arm, to steady him. (John might be royally pissed at Sherlock, but not enough to want him to go through a silent panic attack. Especially one that might actually get them both killed).
“I think,” sighed Sherlock with a small huff of a laugh, “that this might have been a new record in processing a sexual identity crisis. Excellent work.”
This got away from me and I was unable to reach the smut in just two chapters. I remain hopeful for the third one ;)
Looking around the living room in 221B, nothing seemed to have changed. John was in his chair, Sherlock in his. There was fire in the grate and a whiskey in his glass. And yet…
“And will you come with me?” Sherlock leered, even though the distress was still plain on his face. “Husband?”
"Oh, don't get your knickers in a twist. I’m not going to lecture you about technique. I’m sure Google has all the information you might need."
John is smiling and making sushing noises, encouraging slower movements and more languid kisses. But Sherlock doesn’t care – he’s almost certain he can talk them out of an indecency arrest, although it would obviously be an unfortunate complication. But if this is the only time he can have this, then he damn well will. Because it’s been
John is calling him. The phone is set to silent, but Sherlock watches the screen flash in the darkness of 221B. He does not pick up.
. He would know within seconds and that would give him all sorts of wrong ideas and that would be Not Good. So John wasn’t in any position to look at the gay porn. Even if he’d wanted to. Which he didn’t.
Clearly he wouldn't bring her home to 221B, lead her through the flat, past Sherlock and up to his bedroom. That would be
“No, you didn’t. And I’m sorry I…I’m sorry about yesterday, okay? We’ll just wait this out. It’s not as if either of one is in a relationship right now – never mind one that is going to end with a wedding. I’m sure Mycroft will have figured this all out by the time it will ever matter. And until then, we can just pretend it didn’t happen, okay?”
So John didn’t feel too bad about waiting. Sherlock wasn’t in any particular danger. He was in the flat with John, so he couldn’t be safer, really.
“No, it’s just us,” John started to say at the same time Sherlock continued: “Because I can leave, I’ll just…”
But then again that family was maybe broken beyond repair when John and Sherlock boarded this plane?
"Well, the pickings in my inbox were slim. And we needed one last case." Sherlock is rifling through some papers on a side table, occasionally snapping photographs with his phone. They’re in a creepy old warehouse, and this appears to be a staff-room of sorts. Other parts of the building house weapons, stolen goods and some forgeries. John is actually rather impressed with the ambition of these criminals – they’re not afraid to branch out, apparently.
