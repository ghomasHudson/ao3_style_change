“Ok,” Cas lie down, but still extremely stiff.
Dean walked the short distance to his room and grabbed a pair of sweatpants, boxers, and an old AC/DC t-shirt out of his drawer. He went back to Cas’s room and opened the door, only to find him stark naked, sitting awkwardly on the bed. Dean didn’t want to admit it but he may or may not have taken a few seconds to “not notice” Cas so he could check him out. The way his thighs curved just the right way into those sharp hipbones and an area between his legs that he didn’t want to think about due to the fact that he may or may not already be slightly hard.
“Stakes, iron, silver, salt, a knife.” Dean points to each item as he lists them off, “I mean, we’re pretty much set to catch and kill anything I’ve ever heard of.”
Dean was so engrossed in the song, that he hadn’t noticed that Castiel had started to doze off. He tried to stop himself, he really did, but he couldn’t help himself. He leaned over and placed a kiss to the angel’s forehead. He smiled fondly down at the angel and crept to the door.
“It’s weird but I feel the same way” They slowly leaned towards each other, but Dean snapped out of it and awkwardly coughed. “Well, this is your room. Tell me if you need anything. My room is right here on the right and Sam’s is right across the hallway. There should already be sheets and a toothbrush in there, but I need to get you some more clothes. We can go get you some clothes sometime this week, but for now, my clothes should fit you. I’ll be right back.”
“Is it normal to progress so fast in the ‘turning into a human’ thing?” Dean asked.
“Yes Godammit!” Sam goes silent, knowing that he has lost this battle. There’s an awkward silence before Dean speaks again.
“I said he has-”
Sighing, Sam got up from the spot on the floor he was occupying and headed to the bathroom to wash his bloodied hands. When he returned, Dean had stopped peering at Cas and gone back to his research, but Cas was still blatantly observing Dean like it was his lifeline.
All Dean can see is darkness. That’s it. Nothing more, nothing less. He frantically pats down his pockets for a flashlight or a lighter and panics when he comes up empty-handed, only to sigh in relief when he finds the lighter in his jacket pocket, the one he didn’t search.
“Oh no, I don’t want to be a bother.”
Just as he’s about to sit down for a rest, Dean spots a gas station not far ahead. He probably would have jumped for joy, if not for the fact that he felt as if he was going to pass out any second.
“I just couldn’t sleep. I am an angel and have never actually slept before, so I was wondering if you had a technique for sleeping. I went to Sam first because you have already done so much for me and he told me to try counting sheep, but I can’t for the life of me find any sheep anywhere in the bunker.” Dean chuckled at that and went through possible solutions for sleeping.
“Just once,” Dean rushes to clarify, heart pounding in his uncertainty. This kind of conversation is uncharted territory for them. “Haven’t heard from him since.”
that gets a proper reaction out of Cas, all pissed off and possessive and totally sure of himself, confident that he has more to offer Dean than anyone else could ever dream of. Constantly being reminded that Cas wants Dean all to himself, Cas demonstrating that utter confidence that Dean is his… that’s the kind of thing he can’t get out of his head for days, even weeks afterward.
,” Cas replies in frustration, voice dipping into a growl and goddamn, that’s so hot, Dean’s just as weak for that voice as ever. Cas keeps shoving forward insistently, cock riding so close to where Dean really wants it, like Cas wants inside
“I’ve already done
Dean feels a surge of pride when their shelter holds up, even as he starts to hear rain splatter against the palm fronds.
When he starts up again, Dean barely get the chance to bite out, “Close,
“I’m okay,” Dean answers reflexively, and it’s not entirely a lie. Well, okay, Dean might be freaking out just a little, but Cas’s touch is soothing, and just having him here lets Dean clear his head enough to have a little perspective. He’s soldiered through way more difficult situations than this one. Everything is under control. “Let’s do this,” he says, managing a smile for Cas before following Charlie.
Dean kind of wants to climb on top of Cas right now, doesn’t know how he’s held himself back this long. But Cas’s unwavering stare keeps him rooted to the spot, staying put because he likes the way Cas is rising to his feet, likes the intent, predatory way he stalks over to stand in Dean’s personal space. Dean’s heart pounds at their proximity, and Cas pulls him into a kiss that has him moaning in relief.
And taken an interest, no doubt, if Dean had to guess by his tone. “What for?” Dean wonders aloud.
“All right.”
“Kinda,” Dean mumbles. He feels a little silly and a lot vulnerable – he did with Rhonda too, and yeah, he may be a lot more comfortable with Cas, but it’s still a bit nerve-racking to be doing this because
Cas tenses, so minutely that Dean wouldn’t have noticed it if they weren’t wrapped together so close.
He pulls Cas’s arm around him more tightly, gratified when Cas snuggles in closer. He just lets Cas hold him for a minute, a trace of a grateful smile on his face that Cas can’t see, but hopefully knows is there. He glances down at Cas’s hand resting against his sternum, gentle and tan and huge, and he almost gasps at the sight of it, the reminder.
A completely ridiculous plan that he rejected immediately, not that it slowed her down any. To Dean’s utter dismay, it seems like no matter what he does, Charlie is not going to let up on trying to sell him on her latest bright idea – her taking Dean and Cas on a ‘fun night out.’
The idea of it still makes his eyes prickle, and he can’t chalk that one up to being a sappy drunk. “Well,” he says after a beat, clearing his suddenly hoarse throat. “When you put it that way.”
“Wait,” Dean says far too soon, pushing Cas back slightly.
Fuck. He just— he
“And you—” Cas says, forging on. “You’re so beautiful when you let go, when you allow yourself to give into your desires. Your soul is always so bright then. To be a part of that is…” he trails off, searching for the words. “I feel so in tune with you. So connected.”
Cas hums indulgently when he feels Dean press against him, but he doesn’t lose his focus. “You get so worked up so quickly—you’re so
The idea of Jones trying to…
“Not from her,” Cas fires back, leaning down to claim Dean’s mouth with a heated kiss, probably to get him to stop talking.
It occurs to him how usually when they go out he tries to downplay his relationship with Cas for the sake of his own comfort, and here he finds himself tempted to flaunt it. Maybe he’s overreacting. In his experience, a move like buying a drink for a guy would be a blatant proposition or something, but it’s different here—probably not in a bad way, but he’s still adjusting. There are a lot of confusing, even conflicting feelings pulling at him at simultaneously and he’d really like to filter out the negative ones and mold this evening into a positive experience. Maybe a drink would help. The point of this, according to Charlie, was to lighten up and have a little fun. He still has his doubts about that, but he can at least
Dean’s brain sort of short circuited at the time, if he’s being honest – the idea of it, the
in Cas’s words is… yeah. Wow.

And he
push the beds together to get a little more room, but that would be such a pain, of course. Totally not worth the trouble.
Dean pulls him in for a kiss, his eyes stinging. He savors it this time, as if this one is their first. He’s overcome with a sense of contentment and completion, feels butterflies in his stomach. When he pulls back he doesn’t let Cas go far, just whispers into their shared space before he loses his nerve. “Me too, okay? About everything you said, I just—I love you, too. Dreams are fun and all, but this is better. You and me.”
this is precisely what gets him distracted. Castiel is patient, kissing Dean slow and heated, wondering idly what set Dean off. It can be the smallest thing sometimes. Dean has quite the active imagination with this, and Castiel can almost feel him struggling to stifle the thought. Or, the more difficult task, actually talk to Castiel about it.
*   *   *
Dean’s half out of his mind with desperation, could easily reach down and at least ease some of the pressure with his own hand, but he doesn’t even try, can’t stop clutching at Cas’s thighs, begging for him instead.
Cas furrows his brow. “I’m sorry, did I startle you?”
“Oh, I know you heard me,” Charlie says brightly, undeterred by his repeated efforts to shut the conversation down or make a swift escape. “But I don’t think you’re listening.”
Cas’s eyes are wild as he stares Dean down, and Dean suspects they’re both shocked by the desire they’re feeling, entranced by the desire they see reflected in one another.
It’s still not always easy to tell what that motivation will be, Dean thinks, side-eyeing Cas, simultaneously wishing Cas could just read his mind and praying that he can’t. Something like the whole mess with Scott would probably do it. Not that Dean can count on that kind of luck actually presenting itself just because he wants it. And he’s getting pretty tired of waiting for a prime opportunity like that one to fall into his lap.
incredible.”
Cas is glowering at him across the parking lot. “Why don’t you put our things in the car? I’ll drop the keys off,” he volunteers.
It makes him feel alive.
Dean opens his eyes again when he’s worked up a steady pace, meeting Castiel’s gaze. It’s a wonder Castiel can ever last long through this, Dean’s mouth hot and soft around him, Dean looking up at Castiel, cheeks flushed and eyes glassy as if he’s the one experiencing the almost unbearable pleasure he’s giving Castiel.
Dean takes a few steading breaths, sagging into Cas’s arms, but doesn’t intend to stay idle for long. It’s been weeks since the incident when Dean played vamp-bait, but Dean hasn't forgotten how Cas rocked hiss world but Dean hardly got the chance to do anything for Cas. Ever since then he’s been dying to return the favor somehow. He would’ve dropped to his knees in that filthy alley in a heartbeat if Cas had let him, feels almost
Dean’s not sure if Cas is just trying to anticipate his needs or he’s starting to get eager himself. He considers Cas’s question, and, well.
“That’s interesting, isn’t it?” Cas asks, perfectly mild, face giving nothing away, head tilted, eyes squinted and
Castiel shoots him a look.
on board,” he mumbles.
“I think I’m in love,” Dean says, playfully, cracking an eye open, but he finds himself pausing when he looks at Cas. He’s never said anything like that before, not even as a joke, and, well, the thing is, maybe it’s not so much of a joke after all. “I mean,” he says, hastening to clarify, clearing his throat awkwardly. “Not just saying that cause you totally rocked my world.”
Dean turns and glares at her, but Charlie just gives him an unapologetic smile, airily taking another sip from her glass. He knows she’s just trying to get a rise out of him, but it’s only a few minutes later that the bartender swings by with another drink for Cas from an anonymous admirer. Dean wonders morosely if he’s invisible or something, but he’s not really sure if he’s bothered by the fact that the drinks aren’t being sent to him, or the fact that the people here seem to think Cas is a free agent.
Dean shrugs, aiming for casual, wanting to be careful with his phrasing so he doesn’t give too much away. “Anything, I guess.” He knows this is a longshot borne of desperation, and he’s scrambling to prove to himself that, rampant lust aside, this romance novel bullshit isn’t coming from his own brain, because, well, why would it? Okay, sure, he’s enjoyed a sappy movie or two in his time, but he doesn’t want to be
Cas’s fingers slip free so Dean can answer, and he tries not to whine at the loss. “Don’t stop,” Dean pleads, bucking his hips back against Cas, trying to get him moving again.
“Yeah,” he murmurs as Castiel gets up from the bed, hugging the now-available pillow close to his chest, eyes slipping closed again. “See you then.”
* * *
“And it’s terribly fun for me, I suppose?” Castiel replies, not bothering to suppress his sarcasm.
, staring up at Castiel looking almost shaken. Castiel wasn’t able to see this last time, Dean’s candid, wide-eyed expression of pleasure. He didn’t expect Dean to gaze at him in such thrall, actively seeking eye contact with something like desperation, overwhelming need he can no longer keep hidden, giving himself over to Castiel completely. Castiel is awed and empowered by the sight of him, the way he clutches Castiel’s shoulders to bring him closer, making a soft noise when their mouths meet, arching into it.
Dean inhales shakily, hands clenched at his sides. “It was bullshit, Cas,”
That’s what Dean had been expecting. Looking forward to, even.
Castiel itches to soothe his worries, doesn’t wish to let Dean fly into a panic and close himself off. He won’t let Dean run away just because he thinks Castiel is going be the one to do it first. He holds Dean’s face carefully in his hands and Dean lets him, actually relaxing at the touch of Castiel’s fingers, leaning into his cupped palms, finally meeting Castiel’s eyes, unafraid.
, but he’s still aware of that undercurrent of power that Cas carries himself with, goes pliant for Cas’s insistent touches, all too glad to be at Cas’s mercy.
caring of Dean’s pleasure, of course, but unusually focused on his own, rolling his hips with rising urgency and speed, a display of uncontrolled passion that only fuels Dean’s own arousal.
It occurs to Castiel that Dean isn’t just trusting him enough to let him explore, but actively craving the attention, willingly – eagerly – ceding control. “You love this,” he thinks aloud, only a breathy whisper, mind fuzzy with arousal, alight with discovery.
“Good morning,” he replies, composing himself. “Did you sleep well?” It’s not like he doesn’t already know the answer, how peacefully Dean rested with Castiel keeping an eye on him.
at him. There’s obvious lust in his eyes as he glances at Dean’s mouth. The affection in Cas’s gaze is one thing, but this is something that Dean definitely isn’t used to. Not yet, anyway. Feeling slightly out of his depth doesn’t make this any less exhilarating.
He savors these thoughts as if they’re his most indulgent fantasies, but they’re only a familiar reality. Same old, same old. Dean can’t fucking wait.
Castiel’s drawn from his trance by the shrill beep of the coffee maker, both of them glancing in its direction. “Sit,” he implores Dean. “Let me get some for you.”
, but he doesn’t love the idea of auto-tune and synth bass pounding in his ears all night and
Dean blinks at her, frowning. That’s…
“Hey, you came around. Eventually,” Dean teases.
It’s certainly a more productive way to apply his mind than letting it run wild imagining what exactly is behind the side-long glance someone sends Dean’s way or the particular lilt to their voice when they speak to him. Harmless flirtations feel a lot more harmless when he can channel his pent-up energy into fantasizing about what he’s going to do to Dean at the soonest opportunity, then actually do it without worrying that he’s acting out in an undignified or unhealthy way, once he’s had a chance to settle down. And then afterwards he can catalogue every detail of the lovely picture Dean makes when he’s pink-cheeked and pliant from pleasure, recall it when ugly, near-obsessive thoughts start to creep in, remember how content Dean was in his arms.
Dean gets over his reluctance quickly enough, Cas already under the covers looking warm and inviting, drowsy smile on his face, reaching out a hand as Dean passes by. And yeah, fuck it, he doesn’t see the point in torturing himself, just climbs right in and cuddles up to Cas. Sam will probably find them tangled together in the morning regardless. Dean doesn’t have a whole lot of control over that in his sleep, knows he’ll just gravitate towards Cas out of instinct even if he starts off huddled on the far end of his side. Besides, it gets cold around these parts this time of year. Gotta utilize body heat, and all that.
There’s no way Dean’s telling Cas anything he doesn’t already know, as rational as he is, but apparently that hasn’t been enough to get a handle on his knee-jerk jealousy. Dean’s seen Cas the picture of calm in the most dire of situations – that’s pretty hot too, in its own right, Cas totally unshakeable in matters of life and death– but
Cas chooses to abruptly pull away at the exact moment Dean’s hoping to move things along a little. Dean fails to stifle a noise of protest, but he does manage to stop himself from literally pouting over the interruption, so he at least maintains a small amount of dignity.
, it really, really is. He blinks back fresh tears, glancing down at their joined hands, the matching bands on their fingers. “’Til death do us part, huh?”
Just as Castiel finds his place, she and Dean appear outside, Dean backing further into the alley while she follows, watching him hungrily. Castiel’s sure she wants to devour Dean in more ways than one, that the sexual interest she’s exuding isn’t a feigned ploy to draw Dean in. She looks like the kind of creature who likes to… play with its food, intent on having a bit of fun with Dean before sinking her teeth in. Castiel almost can’t blame her, finding himself somewhat distracted by how good Dean looks in his element, alluring but ready to strike as soon as he gets his chance.
Cas’s hand slides into Dean’s hair, tightening into a fist and tugging – not hard, just enough to make sure Dean’s paying attention. “I asked you if you deserve a reward,” he says, voice calm, authoritative but infinitely patient. “Do you?”
and damn, Dean would be way into that if he thought they’d actually be able to do something about it anytime soon. It’s nice not to have to hide the small, innocuous gestures of affection anymore, but a lack of time or space for anything
. “Judgment free zone, right?”
Dean thinks the subsequent awkward pause is enough of an answer, but he still follows up with, “Nope, you really don’t.”
After a lifetime of roaming all over the country, exploring hidden paths and wandering into the wilderness, Dean’s been to his share of beautiful places, but he rarely takes any time to appreciate them.
to look out for the people he loves. It’s a role he’s taken to heart, but not one that he’d chosen for himself. That sort of kindness should never have come at the expense of his own well-being and self-worth.
There’s a small, scared, petty part of him that wants to dismiss that – what does Cas know about that kinda thing, really? – but Dean guesses he understands better than most when to leave something behind, even if it’s all you’ve ever known.
*   *   *
He shuffles into the kitchen, yawning. He could banish that lingering fatigue with nothing but a thought, but nowadays, he prefers to do that with coffee. His grace is more effective than caffeine, of course, but taking that route would deny him the ritual he’s come to treasure – sitting and chatting with Dean over their morning cup, Dean still blinking sleepily, voice slow and deep.
“Let me see it,” Cas interrupts him, reaching out.
he’s suffering. But this evening’s already getting close to ending in a barroom brawl, and they ought to tread lightly. Divesting people of their hard-earned money always ruffles a few feathers, and he can see this guy’s face grow stormier with each increasingly effortless shot from Cas, the dawning realization that he’s been thoroughly played. Dean doesn’t really want to risk
” It’s kind of a weak narrative to start with, and he’s lost track of how many ‘I saw a ghost!’ stories have turned out to be a dumb hoax, or a poorly thought-out cover story for something unfortunate but still of this earthly plane.
If Dean were a bit further in denial, he might blame the swoop of his stomach on revulsion. But that wouldn’t explain the way his pulse has suddenly skyrocketed in excitement, or why he lets Cas peel him out of his clothes, breaking out in goosebumps as his skin is bared. He feels warmer already, with Cas wrapped around him, his surprisingly hot hands wandering up Dean’s chest, a flush traveling down Dean’s neck.
Cas grins. “Does that mean you’ll stop running out of the room every time you see me?”
Cas, and he knows the feeling is mutual – Cas isn’t exactly subtle about that kinda thing – but for the moment he’s content with just this, just gazing at one another and breathing each other’s air, relaxing and soaking up their shared warmth.
Dean knows what Cas is angling for, and he’s too blissfully sated to be anything other than honest. “Want you to,” he concedes, helping Cas slip out of his boxers – and god, he really does, can’t believe how strongly he craves it even though he’s already thoroughly spent.
It takes a second for Dean’s brain to catch up, to realize what Cas is getting at. He’s panting and squirming and utterly put out that Cas had the audacity to stop. “Think you’re a pain in the ass,” he hisses, feeling bratty over being denied. That earns him a smack from Cas’s hand, the impact sharp against one cheek. It startles him into a moan that tapers off into a breathy laugh. “Ow,
“To drink? You had like one beer yesterday.”
Castiel had an inclination of what Dean’s deepest desire was then. It was like Sam said. Dean wanted everyone safe. Everyone in the world. And under this spell, he had to make it happen. His end goal was everyone safe, no monsters, no pain ever again. There was only one place Castiel knew of where such a thing was possible. Paradise. And what way did Dean have available to him to bring Paradise to Earth? Only one. Like it or not, the witch had said. It has to be done. No matter if the path leads through Hell.
Sam stilled when Dean yelled out
“I wasn’t going to put you to sleep,” Castiel says, because he feels it is important the man understands. Castiel
. I haven’t touched things in so long.” Jimmy laughs.
“Oh, if it would have fucked up with your mission, that’d be shit,” he says. “Wouldn’t wanna break your little agenda.” He brings one of his arms up and pushes at Castiel, clearly expecting some sort of a result, but he just ends up with his hand wrapped around Castiel’s shoulder, pressing at it. It’s the same arm that Castiel’s wing is burned to, so there they are, each holding the other’s arm, though the odd image is only visible to Castiel as no one else in the room sees into the angelic plane.
“Hey Castiel,” Samuel Winchester says. “I didn’t know you ate breakfast.”
, Jimmy suddenly pitches in.
as you can, even though it’s not true. You have some of Crowley’s bureaucratic appointments planned. Crowley chuckles again, for some reason deeply satisfied with your answer.
“You do anything fancy on Saturdays?,” Dean Winchester asks. He is looking at the book over his adoptive father’s shoulder. His hand is still around the blade hidden by his jacket.
“Uriel,” Castiel warns the younger angel, raising his hand imperceptibly to rest on his blade. It already exists. No force of energy will let Uriel know when Castiel summons it because it is already here. He will not expect it.
Joshua says, his eyes alert on every moment of the siege.
It does seem to affect the human eyes a little again. But, oh - its true form actually recoils. Takes a step back, as much as it can without the human body moving.
the man continues in a whisper.
“Yeah, cause the sex is nothing.”
“Who are ya?,” Bobby asks gruffly. Ruby puts on a look of complete helplessness.
Castiel asked again.
, Cas says. Cas in Dean’s body raises the pieces with his grace, and there is Ruby. Still alive. Then Cas in Dean’s body comes to Sam. Sam needs answers. Sam needs answers more than he needs air.
“What, you don’t drink or somethin’?,” Dean asks him. Everything he has said to Cas since they came into this house has sounded like a defense. Prickly. Quick. Volume going slightly up at the end sentence.
“Yes,” Cas needs to leave. Dean is adequately distracted. Cas needs to leave and dematerialize the blade before Dean remembers it.
“I have extended my Grace when your father was parking, to get a sense of the terrain and to learn of any possible complications. We will need to implement many new wards to truly keep you safe from demons,” Castiel takes a step forward and Dean takes a step back. Castiel puts his hand on the wood and feels around the walls, looking for the best places for the sigils. “I will require the house owner’s blood for some of it,” he adds.
The witch spit out some of the blood.
Castiel says.
and then froze.
“You’ve been here with the angel all this time. Sure you know where it is in my office. Third from right is the casual one,” Singer says, promising him death through his eyes. Jimmy knows they won’t do anything to him. They need Castiel too much.
“I have told you, Dean. Sam has friends now that Heaven would rather you didn’t associate with.”
So the world turns. So the wind blows. Something must happen.
“When he’s not here, of course, when he’s actually doing something,” Jimmy adds. This does not help the confusion on Singer’s face. Jimmy couldn’t care less about that right now.
That’s Michael. Castiel wonders why he can hear them, before he notices that Dean’s defense from fulfilling the spell is calling his name.
“We’re in New Delhi, India.”
Castiel speaks to him not like he did when he was a garrison leader but more intensely; he has never felt this kind of anger before. A special charge like Dean Winchester must provoke special emotions.
Most mornings Castiel sits at the small table. This morning, however, is different, because his chair is taken by a recently awakened Samuel Winchester. The demon blood within him beats more quietly, which means he will need to find a demon within a day. He does not seem eager to do it immediately, which means Castiel’s seat is taken. The angel stands in the doorway.
“That’s your problem,” Jimmy spits out. The Winchester flinches.
He remembers the steady flow of the spell through his body and he remembers wanting to say ‘
Castiel stands up.
“We have fought together many times, in close companionship,” Castiel adds, but human languages cannot translate what he and Balthazar are. They are siblings, created alongside one another. They are one and the same in the Host. They are separate beings while in vessels, but who remember the shape of the other with minutiae details. They are as close as the Winchesters, and more, and yet less, and differently. “He’s my brother.”
, he says and walks towards the entrance.
“I do not know how you perform at sex. I also do not know how the Virgin Mary performed. You are familiar with the meaning of immaculate conception?”
“Dean,” Castiel starts, but the Righteous Man cuts him off.
No need for praise like Zachariah. No desires for calm like Joshua. No distaste for humans like Naomi. No doubts like Michael. Only complete devotion.
Dean continues walking. Castiel stretches his wing. He looks at Uriel’s vessel’s eyes, because he cannot do anything else. Uriel looks at Samuel with disgust.
Castiel stops listening to their conversation. He needs Balthazar to repair the sigils before he leaves, or they never will be fixed, given Castiel’s new orders.
Dean can hear Bobby getting up behind him, but if he can hear him then Cas - just-killed-an-Archangel-with-a-snap-of-my-fingers Cas - can hear him too. So Dean stays on his knees, damn it.
What he needs to do now is convince Uriel this can be reversed. To convince Uriel to stay. Uriel is young; maybe he does not know how terrible this is. If it was Zachariah he would be gone and telling Michael already. If it were Balthazar - if it were Balthazar he would help. But Uriel; him Castiel does not know well.
“Oh, Cas, you’re here,” Dean Winchester says. Cas stops in the middle of the kitchen. This is not Bobby.
“No, I’m going to talk now,” Dean says, taking a step towards Cas, clearly expecting him to walk back. “You know my brother was -“ Castiel does not let him finish. He marches towards Dean, and unlike himself, Dean walks backwards on instinct.
Updates will now happen (a) more often (b) be shorter (c) which makes for more chapters!
When he returned with Sam and Dean minutes later, Bobby was no longer in the room. Someone has moved him - either a coincidence, or his kidnappers were powerful enough to feel that an angel broke through their protections. From then on, Sam and Dean did everything they would have if it were a normal hunt, but with more tension in their bodies. Castiel knew, because he has stayed with them. He was suspecting this might have been some angels’ doing, but he was wrong. It was djinns. Djinns whose father the Winchesters once killed, and who had dedicated a good part of their life to finding the creature that killed their parent. Castiel could not help but see the similarity in their life stories, although the djinns were, of course, abominations.
“Of course I’m glad to see you haven’t been harmed in my absence,” he says. Dean’s eyebrows rise immediately. Cas feels he is expected to continue. “I do not own a gun. I would not know how to use one.” Dean continues staring at him, strange things happening on his face. Cas feels like he is still expected to continue, but he has answered Dean’s questions and he absolutely cannot mention the blade, so what else can he do? He stares at Dean, hoping he were allowed to just read his mind. No matter how hard he tries, he cannot glimpse Dean’s thoughts. He would have to extend his Grace, and it cannot touch Michael’s Sword unless he is in cosmic danger.
The eyes are back on his.
, the man says, and smiles. This is not Dean Winchester. Castiel just left Dean Winchester on a park bench, but an anomaly, a fracture in the continuity of time in the same park in which his charge was has called him back. He arrived, and saw this man. And this man saw him, smiled widely through tears, said
Castiel says and goes.
“Yeah, that’s what I’m saying, they have that demon there!”
“No,” he shouts back, matching Dean’s voice level.
The man raises his arm, and seems to freeze. He looks at Castiel, looking for - for permission? Castiel tilts his head and the Older Dean’s eyes shine with pain and a small laugh escapes him. His hand lands on Castiel’s shoulder.
“Well, is that a demon-killing gun in your pants or are you just happy to see me?,” he says.
‘No,’ Dean stops him. ‘No, let’s search this place. See what toys Crowley’s been hiding. We have time. He’s not gonna come back so quickly, he has Raphael’s buddies to busy him, don’t you think?’ That’s what he says, but what Dean thinks is - he’s not gonna come back because he was satisfied. Because Castiel asked
Dean immediately tries to run to help them, but Cas still has his wing over the man. As far as a human can see, Dean is literally stopped in his tracks.
“Hey, hey, hey,” Dean interrupts him. “You are speaking of-“
Jimmy asks immediately, but there are more important things. Castiel silences Jimmy for the time being.
Castiel said, and he heard his voice as if it were coming from far away.
It does not feel right to Castiel that they should think he did something wrong, so he speaks out loud in English as well.
At that, Dean’s head turns. His eyes are bright blue.
“This is the end of your little trip.”
Another silence, another instance of Dean opening and closing his mouth without sound.
Michael is worthy of attention. More worthy of attention than the saving of the Righteous Man, and Joshua does not know why so Joshua forms his own thesis.
“I’m sure Uriel will find whatever information on the demons she has.”
“How is Ruby? Is she okay?”, he pleads, like an addict who can see the subject of his addiction within an arm’s reach. Like a lover.
“To - to Jimmy?,” Dean says, exhaling and taking many steps backwards. He hits the sink, next to which are his forgotten whiskey glasses. He takes one up and grips tight.
you, caught you the way he would me. And you let him. I don’t really know how it works in the angelic world or whatever. In ours, I had to say yes. In theirs maybe you just needed to trust him. But you gave him your permission. In your arm, that’s his Grace.”
Now Michael is watching a man flying a kite in a peaceful garden. It is not in any way an exceptional man, nor an exceptional Heaven, however the angel Castiel favors it. Michael muses on this failing. To have favorites is to have preferences; to have preferences is to love unequally. Angels should love in extremes - all and none at the same time.
“I need to wash my hands,” Castiel says to excuse himself from Dean’s further questioning. Nobody answers this. Castiel marvels that they haven’t yet realised he could just clean himself up with his Grace.
, Jimmy thinks,
“You’re merged,” Uriel says. Out loud. Like he wants the humans to know. Like he revels in them knowing Castiel made a mistake.
“You were saved from the depths of Hell because you did not deserve to be there. Your soul shone above all the others -“
“Go hop on some cloud, Angie” Dean sneers at him, his face an unpleasant expression. It strikes Castiel. Dean’s soul has shone as bright as the biggest stars, held onto Castiel’s form with the gentlest, unexpected touch, and did not want to let go even to return to its own remade body. Dean has never sent such ugly emotions towards Castiel before. Even after he forgot Hell, when he was looking for whoever raised him, Dean has called towards him with awe, however guarded. This was new. Castiel did not like it. He would not suffer it. “Bobby, I don’t like this,” Dean finishes. He turns his back to Castiel, as does the other man.
Dean laughs. He puts his palm over his face, pulls it down and quickly walks away from Castiel. Immediately, Cas starts to go after him.
, Dean gritted through closed teeth.
This time speed will be encouraged in procuring Bobby’s blood, and much more effective than the stealth Castiel used before. Castiel can approach him, cut his hand, collect the blood and remove his memory in seconds. It will be imperative to ensure he is silent throughout the process and that nothing warns the man in advance. Castiel materialises his blade into this realm, so that once he’s in the kitchen no light or shift of energy could let Bobby know something is about to happen. Similarly, he cannot enter holding the blade so he - he has nowhere to hide it, he realizes. His - Jimmy’s - coat does not have enough space. There is no pocket big enough. Castiel needs to go NOW, and Jimmy seems to realise Castiel is annoyed with such a human obstacle in his plan, because he offers a thought:
‘He’s not gonna be fooled by this display for long,’ Bobby says and moves towards the exit.
Castiel feels into himself, finds the corner Jimmy Novak is in. Quiet, listening, observing. Interested.
“What the fuck do you mean?,” the Winchester throws back at him.
“Castiel,” Castiel reminds him. He tilts his head. Is Robert Singer’s memory weak? It wasn’t long ago they introduced themselves.
“It’s his choice,” he says out loud to Balthazar.
If Sam is vomiting the demon blood instead of processing it, he is not ‘fine’. But Castiel cannot say it.
“Why would it be a lie?”
“Super weird,” is what Dean decides on.
The sentences played on repeat in his mind but he stopped them from coming out. They grew louder and louder.
“Dean?,” both of the remaining men yell with worry, throwing themselves towards him. Dean Winchester is holding his right hand over his left bicep and squirming. There is something - something - there is something in that image that intrigues Jimmy. Something that pulls him in. He knows this feeling, he’s felt it before, but he can’t name it. There is something in the Winchester’s arm that makes him want to get closer in it. Something impossible to resist. Something -
Another thing that kept on destroying their moods - or rather, Dean’s - was the fact that Castiel would no longer leave him alone. If Dean went to the toilet, Cas would follow him and stand guard outside. If Dean wanted to grab a beer from the fridge, he would feel Castiel’s eyes on his back the entire time, until he sat back down in his chair. If Dean went to sleep - and here was a moment that caused a loud argument - Castiel would follow into his room. The first time he did so Dean didn’t notice until they were standing in from of his door and Cas wouldn’t turn back after Dean said “Guess I’ll hit it.”.
But he is standing and looking at his hands. Castiel stands up and looks at Samuel. The fresh blood beams through the boy’s skin. It entered his system no longer than four hours ago.
Once he has all the information he needs, Michael stretches himself across the world and reverses time.
Cas asked.
Castiel has broken the one and only rule. Castiel has laid a claim on Dean Winchester before Michael could. Castiel has spoiled the Holy Plan. Castiel will be damned for this. If the other angels know, he will be hunted.
You look at it, and it’s the most beautiful creature you have ever seen. You can see its true face, somehow, even though you’re not sure demons are meant to see that face. You’re pretty certain it’s meant to burn you with its goodness and its purity, but instead of evoking anger in you, it calms you. It gives you an inclination of what peace might feel like, what it might be like for all those souls that are allowed into their precious Heaven, not that you’ll ever go there, not that you’ll ever go there.
Cas’s fingers are still tense on Dean’s shoulder as they walk back to the car. Dean knows Cas is fighting the urge to put his hands on him in a less appropriate way, and he’s probably not going to hold off for much longer. He might not even last until they get back to their car. Dean kinda hopes that he doesn’t, briefly indulging in a completely unrealistic fantasy about Cas bending him right over the hood. As dark and deserted as this parking lot is, they might even get away with something like that. The thought is enough to make him greedy, even though he’s already feeling pretty damn good about his prospects at the moment.
Dean peers up at Cas’s face, gets a glimpse of a faint lazy smile as Cas threads his fingers through Dean’s hair. Cas lets his head loll back against the pillow, giving Dean more access as he kisses his neck again, steadily working his way down, Cas’s skin warm and smooth beneath his lips. Cas sighs and arches into it when Dean scrapes his teeth against a nipple, rolls the other between his fingers. Dean runs his hands down the length of Cas’s body, skimming over his ribs and settling on the sharp cut of his hipbones only briefly, sliding beneath Cas to get a handful of his ass because god
Cas pulls back and catches Dean’s eye, just enough of a question in his gaze for Dean to know he should nod his understanding, his assent. Cas looks pleased but says nothing further, fingers briefly sliding into Dean’s hair before trailing all the way down his back as he saunters off.
“No, I—” Cas cuts himself off, sounding uncomfortable. Dean can feel him shift restlessly, thumb tracing a nervous back and forth pattern against Dean’s stomach. About time the shoe was on the other foot. “I didn’t know this until I started sleeping regularly, but I tend to…
again, head tipping back as Castiel pushes one finger forward. Castiel can just barely detect a faint trembling, chest rapidly rising and falling, seeming to give up on continuing these proceedings himself now that Castiel has gotten involved.
Dean tries not to think about the burdens he’s been forced to take on, because acknowledging them means facing how heavily they weigh on him. But it doesn’t seem as hard when Cas is here with him, and instead of getting defensive over the sympathy in Cas’s voice, he lets himself be comforted by it.
Castiel certainly sympathizes.
, I don’t think that.”
Problem solved.
It was never exactly fun when he and Sam would get mistaken for a couple (they’re
dreams, at least, and the alternative for Dean usually ain’t so pretty. But it’s better this way. Eventually things will go back to normal and Dean can stop feeling like a prisoner in his own home, waiting for the other shoe to drop.
much of his self-consciousness is being stripped away, but it’s been a long time since drinking like this made him feel flushed and giddy instead of vaguely miserable, so he’s willing to roll with it. “Those guys over there are doin’ it,” he babbles on, indiscreetly pointing to two men kissing in the corner who look over when he starts gesturing in their direction. Charlie reaches over and lowers his arm, waving at them apologetically. “So, y’know. We totally could.”
Dean blinks, much more awake, trying to process that. “What?” What the hell is that even supposed to mean? “You been talking to Sam or something?” he asks, racking his brain for how Cas could have heard about this.
, just before it’s too much. “Fuck,” he gasps, blinking back more tears, hands clenched into fists. “Cas.”
He has no idea how to read the look on Cas’s face, or what his own expression might be revealing at this very moment and okay, yeah, he can see where the uncertainty factors in now.
“Remember that case we worked in Indiana?” Dean asks abruptly, feeling nostalgic. “That night you hustled those guys playing pool,” he adds, humming contently as Cas presses his lips to Dean’s cheek, his jaw, his throat.
“What do you want, Cas?”
a vegetable.”) Cas is a lot more dutiful than Dean is about following the list to the letter, but as far as Dean’s concerned, if Sam’s gonna be so anal about semantics then he can do the damn grocery shopping himself.
personal one at that, given the way Dean’s blushing. Cas gathers him close, noses at his jaw, presses a kiss to his pulse point. “Will you tell me about that?” Cas asks gently, lips brushing Dean’s ear. “Tell me how they make you feel.”
Christ, if he thought the situation with Cas was delicate before, he’s got a lot to look forward to. Fantasiz—
it, maybe even more than Cas does. Eventually he lets Cas hold him still and chase it, thrusting up into Dean’s pliant, willing body until the moment he hits his peak, going rigid, and Dean takes over again, rolling his hips insistently, right there with Cas as he shudders and gasps and bites down on whatever bit of Dean’s skin he can reach, growl rumbling deep in his chest.
him to Cas of all people should be laughable. It is, in a way – the threat there is comical, hardly the bombshell that Jones seems to think it is – but Dean feels a sting of humiliation all the same, finds it weirdly upsetting that someone’s trying to use a very private, very personal aspect of his life to try and hurt him.
Cas isn’t agonizing over what the next step is or when it’ll happen. He’s just savoring it, Dean realizes, enjoying these moments for what they are as they experience them.
a job well done before parting ways, and something must show on his face, because Cas watches him suspiciously as Dean chats on the phone, catching up with some casual small talk.
Dean still can’t take his hands off of Castiel, not that Castiel is in any particular hurry to do so himself. Dean graces Castiel with a smile. The fear has left his eyes, but he hasn’t built up the typical false bravado in its place, just genuine ease and confidence. “You’re gonna spoil me.”
in Cas’s low burr. “I thought—” He hesitates, not sure why he’s entertaining Cas, really, but it’s easier to find the words when Cas palms his ass, mouth drawing nearer to where Dean really wants it. “I thought oh
Castiel starts to find his rhythm, spurred on by the noises Dean’s making, the way his fingers dig into Castiel’s hips, his shoulders.
Dean shudders in anticipation at the thought, his own dick throbbing in sympathy. Jesus, this always gets him going, Cas’s cock sliding between his lips, the taste of it leaking onto his tongue. He reaches down to touch himself – he’s so
His sly comment elicits a snort of amusement from Dean, lips quirked on one side. “Just go slow. It’s…” He trails off for a moment, expression turning more serious. “It’s been a while.”
. Otherwise known as the Saskatoon serviceberry.”
There’s just way too much chest and shoulder on display for Dean to handle this early in the morning.
Dean’s perfectly aware of what that vague question refers to, and he can only make an embarrassing noise and nod, praying that Cas won’t make him ask for it out loud because he’s not sure that he can and oh
And it turns out that talking about it may be a little awkward, no doubt nerve-wracking to acknowledge that side of himself out loud, but it’s not unbearable or humiliating. Not with Cas. Dean doesn’t know what it’ll be like going forward – probably Cas diving into more research, or putting what he knows to use now that everything’s out in the open, now that Dean is vocally expressing a desire for this, for
Castiel holds his gaze steadily. “You want me to?”
Cas digs his fingers into Dean’s hips, suddenly thrusting up off the ground and meeting Dean halfway. Dean cries out, pitching forward and rocking back even harder, letting out a desperate whine.
Cas tilts his head, considering. “It wasn’t what you wanted.”
, it just felt right, the most natural thing in the world, everything he’s been missing out on.
Dean swallows nervously and reaches for the shower curtain, shifting it aside and stepping into the tub with Cas right behind him. The feeling of Cas’s hands on his bare skin is overwhelming, even these mostly innocent touches, his fingers brushing Dean’s arm, his waist, the small of his back. But innocent or not Dean’s greedy for the attention, and while the idea of
Cas forges on, unmoved. “I could take my time with you,” he muses. His words have taken on a more intentional tone of seductiveness. He’s probably picked up on the way his words are making Dean fidget, the way Dean’s fingers have wound tighter in the fabric of his t-shirt. “Get you so overwhelmed with lust that you’re panting and begging. You like that too, don’t you?”
He puts those thoughts aside because the most important part is that he’s the one who gets to have Dean like this and not that
“Yeah,” the guy replies loudly, undeterred by the way Dean’s sending a murderous look in his direction. “You can keep that
, those vulnerable moments when they’re lost in a tender embrace, breathing heated confessions against each other’s skin. The kind of stuff Sam’s not supposed to see.
Even Cas needs a moment to think. “I like making decisions and knowing they’re good ones,” he says eventually, slow to start, but more confident by the end of his sentence.
Dean’s eyes follow Cas’s until they land on the man in question, who visibly perks up when he realizes that Cas is looking his way. Surprisingly, Dean has a sudden moment of empathy – he knows how overwhelming it is to have Cas’s focus on you, even for a second – but his petty side takes over real quick and he squares his jaw, scooting closer to Cas. The blooming hope on the guy’s face evaporates, and he visibly deflates in disappointment as Cas turns his attention to Dean instead.
“Look,” Dean says, pointing to the box, “‘Fiber and whole grain,’” he quotes proudly. “And they’ve got ‘apple’ right in the name. Totally healthy.”
Dean would’ve been on board for more drinks at home, especially after their evening took such a nosedive, but it turns out Cas has other plans. They don’t even get around to cracking open a beer.
Charlie hides her own smirk behind a sip of coffee. “No, you’re not.”
“Cas?” Dean mumbles. His brain’s not completely online yet, but his body’s getting up to speed pretty quick and he sighs reflexively at the attention, gently pushing back against the familiar hardness behind him – he was more than half-hard when he woke up too, and he’s getting all the way there in record time.
A thrill shoots through Dean’s body, his fingers tightening in Cas’s collar, but he still pauses, sneaking a glance at the dishes piled in the sink behind him.
Dean stops for a second and takes a deep breath, calming even further when Cas hangs back beside him.
—Just couldn’t stop thinking about it,” he says, voice so quiet it’s almost inaudible. “And I just—” Dean catches his eye then, and Castiel doesn’t know what Dean sees on his face, but it makes him falter, lapse into silence and drop his gaze again. When he finds it in him to lift his head again, his face is determined. “Cas,” he says, surprisingly sharp. “You get it, right? Why I invited you out here?”
They pause for a breather just around the time Charlie comes sauntering back to their table. She looks triumphant and a little dreamy-eyed, but she snaps out of it when she registers how thoroughly entwined Dean and Cas are. “Uh,” she blinks. “Okay, I’m not gonna ask you where your hand is,” she says, glancing at Cas, “But I am gonna remind you both that this is a classy joint and they
Castiel shoots Dean a look this time, but very charitably does not mention that Dean was the one rushing him to watch in the first place. He allows his gaze to linger, the ghost of a smile creeping onto his face as Dean flushes ever so slightly under the scrutiny, even while stubbornly directing his attention at the television.
(See the end of the chapter for
memories. “Took such good care of me before,” he breathes. “Please, c’mon.”
“Right,” Dean says abruptly. “Better get back to it then.”
, no, that’s not—” The urgency Dean hears actually helps find the nerve to look Cas in the eye again. Cas seems genuinely flustered for a moment before he composes himself. “What I meant was—” He squares his jaw, reaching out and untangling Dean’s arms, taking hold of Dean’s left hand and sliding the ring on. Dean must be Cinderella or something, because it’s a perfect goddamn fit. “That’s what the ring is for,” he says at last, eyes soft. “I thought that would be enough – to symbolize our bond, what you mean to me,” he pauses, gaze heavy, and Dean’s heart rate speeds up again. “That we belong to each other.”
. “Now what are you thinking?”
and he’s not sure why he needs to be watching a second more of this, why he should let this abomination have another chance to put its foul, unworthy hands on Dean, when he could be swiftly putting an end to this asinine scenario instead.
Dean’s panting, sweat beading on his hairline, and it should be humiliating that he’s a mess and Cas still looks so put together, but he’s come to rely on that in Cas, needing Cas as an anchor when he feels like falling apart.
is what gets to me?” He’s surprising
The fog of arousal clouding Dean’s mind lifts just enough to realize that Cas is poking fun at him. “What?” he says defensively, the impact of his surliness undercut by how breathless he is at this point in the evening.
,” he adds, but the griping is all for show. Sure, there’s a lingering sting warming his skin, but doesn’t exactly have a problem with that. He’s already contemplating what he can say to make Cas do that again.
“I will. Thank you.”
Cas touches him greedily, winding his fingers in Dean’s hair and pulling until he has access to his mouth, to the sensitive skin of his throat. Dean’s babbling a string of profanity and pleas that he’ll be mortified to remember later, an endless stream of
“Good,” Dean says, sighing happily when Cas’s lips ghost along the back of his neck. “Just had to check. Been having a lot of crazy dreams lately.”
Dean knows he didn’t imagine the hint of tension between them—the anticipation—when they decided to go back to the cabin. But the walk is so long that by the time they return, whatever air of suggestion transpired between them has mostly dissipated, and Dean’s trying not to shiver as the early spring weather finally starts to get to him.
That wasn’t so bad, seeing Cas again. He didn’t make a complete fool of himself. Sort of.
“Definitely,” Dean laughs, a thudding in his chest that has nothing to do with the lingering adrenaline and everything to do with the inescapable rush of affection he feels for Cas in that moment. “Lead the way.”
But by some incomprehensible miracle, they didn’t. And that’s a relief, of course. More than a relief – considering what played out between him and Cas, Dean’s feeling pretty damn pleased with himself for his ill-advised choices.
Cas’s expression softens as he seems to pick up on Dean’s frustration. “I don’t want to hurt you,” he says gently.
Dean’s getting into it now, stroking himself fast but steady, trailing his other hand down and nudging between his legs. He just barely teases himself open with the tips of his fingers, hissing at the pleasant sting – fuck, he’s still a little sore, Cas really gave it to him
all night?”
The bed’s comfortable enough, but he’s not exactly relaxed as he gets under the blankets. Sleep is the last thing on his mind. He looks over when Cas moves, stretching over to put his phone on the nightstand, and holds his breath when their eyes meet. Cas smiles at him, the same soft expression that he seems to reserve especially for Dean. Dean licks his lips, wondering if Cas is going to say something, if Cas is waiting for
Almost sooner than should be humanly possible, Charlie replies.
Dean thinks it’s kind of nice, actually. It breaks the mold a little bit (at least, Dean can’t think of a time
Cas’s smile widens. “We can do that.”
When they part again, Dean is thoughtful, quiet, maybe more than Castiel has ever seen him. He’d sort of expected Dean’s playful side to return without the fog of lust clouding it over, but it seems as though he was wrong. Castiel can see the air of restlessness, but knows instinctively that it isn’t a bad thing, isn’t regret or discomfort. This is Dean realizing his guard is down, that he’s letting Castiel see him this way, wide-eyed and soft and vulnerable, and Castiel will handle this moment, handle
He’s so fucking glad he talked Cas out of that trench coat before they came out tonight. Then Cas had upped the ante, of course, by taking off the jacket too and rolling his shirtsleeves up, and there’s here’s still something so thrilling, so illicit about the sight of Cas’s bare forearms, the feel of skin and muscle beneath Dean’s greedy fingers, tie loosened from Dean tugging at it, reeling Cas in as if he’s the one in control here.
“Well,” Dean says carefully, licking his lips because he knows just how intently Cas is watching. “You play your cards right, you might just get me to come home with you.” Dean, on the other hand, has no qualms about playing coy.
Castiel shifts onto his side and Dean goes with him, still clinging, still urging Castiel closer to kiss him. Castiel indulges him, only breaking away for a brief moment to hastily clean them up, dragging the blanket down from the couch to cover them.
When Dean comes, Castiel feels it too, Dean’s body drawn taut as he spills over Castiel’s fingers. His back bows off the floor, grip tight on the back of Castiel’s neck, and the sound he makes nearly undoes Castiel right then. The rush that he feels bringing Dean to orgasm is unlike anything he’s ever known, and he wants to do it over and over and
Castiel undoubtedly has some pent-up energy to burn off, even more so since being alone with Dean for the last few days. He chops far more firewood than is necessary, but it feels good to do something physical, make use of his hands and his body while his mind is otherwise occupied. He pauses for a moment to glance at the cabin, spotting Dean through the window. There’s a palpable air of serenity from Dean, the picture of peace and contentment as he putters around the kitchen. Castiel’s unprepared for Dean to look up and catch his eye, and his heart skips a beat or two when Dean smiles at him.
“Cold?” Cas asks as they part, soothingly stroking Dean’s arms, head tilted in concern. The water may have gone chill, but Cas’s hands still feel hot against Dean’s skin.
“God, you’re
Dean smirks to himself as he fills it in – hey, he had five and nine down right after all. “Knew you’d know it,” he says, grinning wider at the pleased smile on Cas’s face.
The conversation inevitably turns to the endless list of cinema that Dean is insistent that he watch, and apparently the Indiana Jones series has been on Dean’s mind for some time.
“Dean,” Cas says behind him, voice sharp. Dean could keep going, pretend he didn’t hear or just blatantly ignore him, but Dean’s not
your dreams, I—” He hesitates, looking sheepish. “I thought they were mine, at first.”
Or that’s what Dean thought, at least. It’s been a while since either of them has really indulged like this, and the alcohol’s going to his head a lot sooner than expected.
Castiel’s tempted to do exactly that right now, with Dean’s rapt attention focused on his hands, even more so than usual. Castiel lets one finger trace the length of Dean’s cock just to see him gasp and buck up into it. He drops a few more lazy kisses on Dean’s hip bones, sensing his impatience before it’s even voiced.
“That sounds more like it,” Cas says with a note of approval that settles warmly in Dean’s stomach. He’s got Dean spread open now, breath ghosting over him intimately – he’s
Cas hums again, and the sound of it gives Dean goosebumps. “Dean,” he says, amusement creeping into his voice. “Are you suggesting we share body heat?”
Castiel isn’t particularly proud of his reaction the other day at the hotel. He’d always considered himself above such things, capable of more civilized ways of working through an uncomfortable situation. That kind of behavior is unseemly, foolish, and it ultimately accomplishes nothing, but no matter how many times he tries to convince himself, tries to talk himself down rationally, it never works.
Cas feels so fucking far away. He always has, Dean realizes, in a way, so maybe he oughta be used to that. But now that he knows what it’s like to have that closeness, he craves it so completely that it almost surprises him, surpassing want altogether and landing on
“Okay,” Dean murmurs, visibly relaxing as Castiel puts his feet up again and settles in more comfortably.
Dean looks at him sharply. “You’re not seriously apologizing for that, are you?” he asks in disbelief. Like
that he couldn’t properly discern yet, a newly discovered need that answered to Dean’s, almost had him abandoning the plans he had for Dean and losing himself in the heat of his mouth instead.
hands on Dean and return his thorough attentions.
– about Cas’s life before, about Dean’s life too. Shit he’s never talked about with anyone. Stuff not even Sam knows. It just feels easier here, removed from all other distractions, and things come pouring out. His secrets, his fears, memories of his childhood and his dad that he’d buried deep, never heard himself say out loud before.
No one night stand has ever made him feel like this. No fling’s been invited into his home like this, into his
on his lips.
Turns out Scott’s on a case and in need of a little assistance. Dean’s first instinct is to decline, refer him to one of his contacts that’s closer to his area, but the look in Cas’s eyes has him changing his mind.
He stares at Cas’s name in his contacts, thumb hovering over [CALL], but he loses his nerve, opens up the messenger instead.
by what he sees. “I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself,” Cas says, still so soft and sincere, even in the middle of something like this, thumb teasing at Dean’s spit-slick bottom lip.
angle, his knuckles brushing against just the right spot – the twin sensations slam into him at once, magnifying each other and coursing wildly through him and
When they part, Cas gazes at him fondly, gloved hand cupping Dean’s cheek. “That’s a much better reward than a sack of gold.”
There’s a flippant innuendo on the tip of Dean’s tongue, but he stops for a second to think. Everything after they got home was fantastic – it always is – but he’d be lying if he said it was the only highlight of the evening. Going out with Cas like that, allowed to be somewhere together without fear or paranoia was more rewarding than he’d expected. Like with so many other things in his life, he didn’t realize what he’d been missing out on, what he’d been foolishly denying himself, until he actually got it. “All of it,” he says eventually, and maybe he’s not just talking about yesterday – it’s everything with Cas, every single moment, good or bad or some confusing mix of the two, that Dean wouldn’t trade for anything in the damn world. “You, uh,” He lifts his head up so he can look Cas in the eye. “You make me really happy,” he adds, determined to keep his voice steady.
“Dude,” Charlie interrupts him again, putting her hand over his. “It’s cool. It’s not like that was gonna be a fun trip down memory lane for me. Just wanna be on the same page.” Dean seeks out her eyes, comforted by the kindness there, the understanding that makes him treasure her as a friend. “You all right?” she asks. “Did something happen?”
He has no claim to Dean. He knows that, and he knows Dean would never be unfaithful. It’s not really about that at all. He trusts Dean, and even though a committed relationship might be new for him, Castiel has never questioned his loyalty or doubted his feelings. But it doesn’t seem to matter if he knows that Dean’s not receptive; It still unnerves Castiel to see people making advances, and the thought of anyone else
Cas reaches out to frame Dean’s face between his hands, giving Dean his complete focus, which is still kind of a lot to handle, even at the best of times. “I’d like to hear about her,” Cas says, tone neutral, giving nothing away. Dean reads between the lines; even if Cas already does know, he wants to hear Dean explain it.
,” he mumbles. There’s no real way to phrase that delicately.
Dean moves his hand out of the way and curls it around his cock, stroking languidly, his other hand clutching at Castiel’s bicep. Castiel adds another finger, tentative, exploratory, filling the emptiness. Dean shifts restlessly until Castiel goes along with the insistent motions of Dean’s rocking hips, angling his hand just so until Dean hisses
He has to force himself to take his time with it. He wants Cas
“Good morning.” Cas looks like he’s been awake for a while. Dean wonders idly if he slept at all, if he just spent the entire night holding Dean. His stomach flips at the thought of it, and screw morning breath, he’s gotta kiss Cas
Dean wants Cas in a thousand different ways, but the one that presses at him the most as he settles onto the mattress and stares into Cas’s eyes is the uncontrollable urge to get as close to him as possible, even in an entirely innocent way. He has far less innocent desires, for sure, but he’s probably wanted this for even longer, and needs it even more. It’s embarrassing how many of his mind’s conjured scenarios of them in bed together are just this.
It’s undoubtedly bizarre that Dean, of all people, would stall at this stage instead of forging ahead to get out and do the
Dean’s in a similar state right now, feeling constricted even in his sweats, cock aching. “Cas, c’mon,” he mumbles, but it falls on deaf ears.
But Dean’s not listening, doesn’t even wait for more information on Cas’s whereabouts, just beelines it to the garage to check for himself.
Dean gasps and rocks his hips and suddenly wakes, a sweaty mess tangled in his sheets. He groans
. It’s less novel now, but still exhilarating to catch sight of Dean and experience such abject want, taken over by the inescapable urge to do something, sorely tempted to stop whatever he’s doing and get his hands and mouth on Dean’s bare skin as soon as possible.
Cas is with him in this, and thinking about how they’ve got this secluded (kinda romantic) cabin to themselves for a while definitely gets his heart and mind racing, and he’s restless with anticipation all over again. But it’s not a bad sense of anticipation, for all that it’s still kind of terrifying. Looking forward to good things is a novel experience for him.
Dean hastily complies, as he always does when Cas pulls out
The playfulness has vanished from Cas’s face, and Dean marvels that even as he feels like prey in Cas’s grasp, Cas still handles him like he’s something precious.
, and no one’ll even give them a second glance.
They part eventually, only a fraction, still breathing each other’s air. “Did you enjoy that?” Castiel asks, pushing his fingers through Dean’s hair.
for tonight.
Cas removes his own ring and holds it out for Dean to take. Dean’s stunned silence must go on a few seconds too long, because Cas adds, “…If that’s something you want, that is,” a hint of uncertainty creeping in.
on that stuff, but—”
Dean’s whimpering freely now, is so fucking hard that he struggles to keep still and not rock his hips into the inadequate pressure of his pants stretched across his lap.
“You are,” Dean replies, no hesitation. “It is. Just—” Castiel is poised to push inside him, doesn’t even have to wait for confirmation before Dean is breathing, “C’mon, please.”
Dean turns his face and presses his lips against Cas’s collarbones, his chest, as if that distracts from the way Dean’s trembling against him. It’s not just that, though – he wants to make Cas feel good too, even if he can’t begin to adequately repay everything that Cas has done for him. “Hey,” he says, voice muzzy as his fingers wander to the waistband of Cas’s boxers, “You want me to…?”
good to see Dean smile, to see him look at Castiel with fondness, anxious to have him alone again.
That get Cas’s attention, his head nearly whipping around so he can seek out Dean’s gaze. “Of course,” he says, emphatic, unflinchingly sincere in that way Cas does so well. “Of course I do.”
, Dean thinks, throat dry, he and Cas aren’t even doing anything, really, and god knows Dean’s not trying to attract attention – is that how fucking obvious it is, that some stranger can tell just by the way they stand next to each other, the way they look at each other?
Dean wonders how many dreams it took before Cas put the pieces together, what exactly gave him away.
As soon as the door is shut, Cas backs Dean into it, closing the blinds and securing the lock with one swift, casual flex of his grace. Then Dean finds himself pinned to a flat surface once again, Cas keeping him in place with barely an inch of give between the door at his back and Cas’s sturdy body. Cas has Dean utterly at his mercy, one solid thigh shoved between both of Dean’s, only allowing him enough space to helplessly grind into the tantalizing pressure of that thick muscle pressed against him. He undoes a couple of Dean’s buttons, just enough to slip his fingers under his shirt, tease one of his nipples just the way Dean likes. The spike of arousal pulls a pathetic sound from Dean, one he tries to muffle by pressing his lips against Cas’s. He bites back another whimper when Cas tugs at his hair, skin breaking out in goosebumps, cock aching.
“Look,” Dean says, cutting Castiel off and then gets quiet, looking so much more serious all of a sudden that it jars Castiel’s thoughts away from any burgeoning fantasies – as compelling as those images are, he can always put such things aside if Dean needs a different kind of attention. He holds Castiel’s gaze steadily, something meaningful, imploring in his eyes. “I get that you’re trying to… I don’t know, be better? Or have self-control, or whatever it is. But…”
and decided to organize the armory instead.
When they break away they simply hold each other close for a while, breathing each other’s air, foreheads touching, giddy smiles on their faces.
to do.
The first couple of times that things fizzle before they can get interesting, Dean figures it’s just a coincidence. Unfortunately, it’s not long before those coincidences solidify into a pattern.
but it still makes him want to move closer, be more obvious about the fact that they’re together.
Dean frowns. “Well it’s not like you
Cas lets out an appreciative sound of his own as Dean’s moans reach a crescendo, as he comes, gasping, pitching forward. He rests his forehead against Cas’s collar bone while he rides it out, whimpering Cas’s name, hips twitching helplessly, Cas’s strong fingers stroking his back until he settles.
hard.
Perhaps there are other elements that Castiel hasn’t uncovered yet, but he imagines that’s only a matter of time.
*   *   *
That still catches Dean off-guard sometimes: Cas making himself at home, getting
Cas’s smile softens. “We did,” he agrees vaguely, his expression inscrutable. “Would you like to do it again?” he asks, eyebrow raised, clearly picking up on Dean’s unsubtle hints.
Dean just has to kiss him again, has to pour everything he has into that one simple gesture because his throat is tight, his heart is pounding, but he doesn’t know what else to say.
Cas’s smirk lingers. “I think you traumatized him.”
Cas looks down at him, a smile slowly forming on his face. “But I don’t have to speculate anymore,” he adds. “I’ve committed every perfect inch of you to memory.”
The marks elsewhere on Dean’s body are covered (Castiel wants to see those too – but he doesn’t – but he
Dean can’t help but get into it with the way Cas’s hand slips beneath him, firmly gripping his ass and guiding them into a rhythm, grinding their erections together until Dean’s panting. When Cas draws back, starts to sit up, Dean follows without even thinking about it, rising from the pillow and chasing Cas’s mouth.
For the moment, Dean’s too overwhelmed by an unexpected wave of arousal – and what that leads to once they’re behind closed doors – to put together a coherent theory about what’s really gotten under Cas’s skin. But he concludes later, bite marks on his collarbones and a possessive arm around his waist, that Cas
Dean runs his hands up and down his own thighs, fingers twitching. “Can I…?”
Dean catches himself then, realizing his train of thought is getting out of hand, that there’s a low thrum of genuine arousal coursing through him, his dick stirring in interest. He’s embarrassed by his own neediness until he crosses the room to the enormous window, and Cas watches with interest, unmistakably checking out his ass. Dean glances at his face and yeah, there’s no hiding it – Cas may
Dean knows that all he has to do is bide his time. It’s essentially a guarantee, he figures, bound to happen one way or the other because he’s seen how ingrained, how instinctual this side of Cas is, easily drawn out in the right circumstances. For all that Cas can be a wild card, he’s also fairly predictable to someone who knows him as well as Dean does, and if anyone flirts with Dean or even glances at him with what could be considered
“I mean hey, wider net—couldn’t, hurt, right?” Before Castiel can further argue how absurd that is, Dean slaps his palms decisively on the table, pushing back in his chair. “Think I’m gonna shower though,” he says quickly, already rising from his seat. “You get started – I’ll catch up.”
“Don’t need you to be better,” Dean says, suddenly feeling vulnerable under Cas’s gaze. “Just need you to be you.”
kind. But he’d look into Dean’s gorgeous green eyes, find them dark with arousal, and Castiel would see what he was meant to see, as Dean confirmed it aloud – yes, yes, that’s
mind right now. Cas would probably share, in excruciatingly filthy detail, if Dean found the nerve to ask.
“You’re blushing,” Cas remarks, sounding a bit surprised and even
There’s no way Castiel, observant as he is, would miss it, the way Dean’s gaze briefly meets his own and then dips almost imperceptibly lower, only to retreat, skittish, self-conscious. Castiel’s suddenly so tired of dancing around this, refuses to squander these opportunities any longer when they’re so few and far between, so quick to slip away. Castiel could be gone by tomorrow, and he knows that takes a toll on Dean. Castiel hates to do it. The departure takes its toll on him too, not knowing exactly where he stands with Dean, what it is he’s leaving behind, but being absolutely certain that he
Cas’s appreciative groans send Dean’s arousal flaring, the way he tightens his grip in Dean’s hair, groaning Dean’s name, so guttural it’s hardly recognizable. It spurs Dean on, makes him redouble his efforts, sucking in his cheeks, adding a filthy flutter of his tongue on every pass, eyelids drifting shut. Then he gets greedy for it, opens his mouth wider, pushes the limit of how deep he can take him. The inevitable ache in his jaw is well worth the promise of Cas spilling down his throat or smearing hot on his lips and cheeks, dripping onto his chin – proof that Dean was the one to do that, to give him that pleasure.
Dean laughs to himself.
Dean would be perfectly happy to stay like this for a while, but the cops could show up at any second, and being caught tangled up in a sweaty, half-naked mess would probably not do them any favors.
wants Cas – damn near out of his mind with it right now in particular, leg jostling compulsively, fingers drumming on the steering wheel, fidgeting at the memory of Cas’s defiant eyes as he stared that motherfucker down – and like hell is he ever gonna stop wanting him.
He’s vaguely aware of Cas reaching behind him for the shampoo and popping the cap open. “Turn around,” Cas murmurs, and god, Dean’s sure he doesn’t mean anything overtly suggestive by it, but just hearing those words in Cas’s deep, rough voice, he hardly knows the difference. Either way, it’s not like Dean’s gonna say no to that. He stifles a satisfied groan when Cas’s fingers thread through his hair, working the shampoo in. He could get used to this, Cas’s strong hands massaging his scalp and down the back of his neck, the feeling of him pressed up behind Dean. He’s not so close that the contact is as scandalous as it could be, but he’s close enough that Dean can’t stop thinking about it – Cas taking that last half step forward until they’re aligned head to toe, the tangible proof of how this is affecting Cas impossible to ignore. Dean’s own arousal surges at the idea of it, but he isn’t able to get too caught up in his imagination before Cas maneuvers him under the spray to rinse his hair clean. Though Cas handling his body so firmly, so confidently, doesn’t exactly keep the lust at bay.
Dean fidgets under the scrutiny. “Gonna
Castiel is captivated by the undisguised eagerness on Dean’s face – his eyes too bright, flitting between half-lidded and opened wide, mouth slack with pleasure. Castiel can track every tic and response, the pink flush suffusing his cheeks, traveling down his neck.
“Hey, it’s okay,” Dean says soothingly, reaching out to touch Cas’s arm, running his hand up and down the length of it. He never wants Cas to feel bad about this, about getting
“I can see that,” Dean replies vaguely, eyes helplessly wandering to Cas’s biceps straining the fabric of his shirt. He instinctively tries to stop himself before he remembers that he’s
Dean licks his lips. He hopes he’s not being too obvious, but Cas never misses a thing. Dean catches a glint in his eye, but he merely circles to the other side of the desk in front of Dean, leaning against the edge of it and crossing his arms. “Do you know why I called you up here?” Cas asks with a slight curious tilt of his head.
hurt a little bit, uh,” he pauses, knowing there are some nuances to sex that – for now – Cas doesn’t quite get, “Sometimes that feels good too.”
There’s no use beating himself up over it, of course, because it obviously doesn’t mean anything. Dreams are weird as hell. He’s got no control over all that subconscious shit. None of this is his fault.
It’s thrilling to see Dean like this, lost in arousal. Castiel had caught glimpses years ago, accidental stolen moments before Castiel fully understood boundaries or decorum – popped in unannounced but undetected only to catch Dean in a private moment then flitted away, contrite, when he realized what he was intruding on. He didn’t think too much of it at the time, and even later, when his feelings for Dean had undeniably changed, he tried not to dwell on it, tempting as it was. Whatever he might have seen was never meant for him.
“But I wasn’t wa—”
“That’s it, Dean,” Cas repeats, almost comically put-together compared to what a frantic mess Dean is right now. “That’s it,” he murmurs, gentle words interspersed with the swift, repeated impact of his hand.
“Are you ready then?” Cas asks, smile audible in his words as he lets his hand drift lower.
Dean fidgets, clenching his jaw, unable to look Sam in the eye as the images from his dream flood his mind. “It’s personal,” he mutters and yeah, dammit, he can definitely feel his face turning red.
or anything, and he doesn’t seem confused that Dean doesn’t either – but it all comes crashing down on him again when they turn in for the night.
If his jealousy is easily sparked and he wants to glower at too-friendly strangers and then spend the evening ravishing Dean to the point of excess… why shouldn’t he?
He doesn’t care much for the taste of beer right now – doesn’t taste it much at
He rolls out of bed, not expecting Cas to join the world of the living for at least another hour, and wanders into the kitchen. He finds Charlie seated at the table, and bless her nerdy little heart, she’s made a fresh pot of coffee.
Dean tenses, thinking Cas must be fucking with him. He glances over his shoulder warily. "What?" He honestly never thought he'd hear those words out of Cas's mouth, no matter how often Dean has been
. Another part of him has a feeling that he could ask Cas to come to bed with him, in any sense of the term, and Cas, accommodating as he is, would go along with it.
Dean upturns the box and they both start to spread out the pieces, already in sync. It’s silly, maybe, but it feels good to Dean this this is something they can work on together, not against each other. There aren’t any winners or losers here.
Dean licks his lips, considering. “Well, uh,” he says, trails off for a moment. He’s nervous,
He clears his throat, louder this time, and Cas looks up again. “If you don’t hurry up I’m gonna start without you,” Dean says, arching an eyebrow. He licks his lips and Cas tracks the movement, eyeing Dean’s mouth. Dean feels victorious now that he’s caught Cas’s interest – that only turns him on more, planting his feet wide and running his hand up his thighs, letting the warmth in his belly pool between his legs, spurred on by his own impatient touch.
Charlie gives him another funny look. “What?”
as soon as possible.
when he’s mad. It takes Dean back to when Cas first came into his life, radiating some kind of unfathomable cosmic power, terrifying but hopelessly intriguing. Dean didn’t know what to do with it then, what he really wanted from Cas, or what Cas wanted from him. What Cas was capable of. He definitely knows now.
Dean readily tilts his head to give Cas better access. Cas slides his fingers back into Dean’s hair, just resting them there, and Dean murmurs, “Yeah, you can—” melting into a pitiful whine when Cas acquiesces, winding his fingers through and
Cas huffs and rolls his eyes good-naturedly. “If you keep using hyperbole like that, I might start to doubt your sincerity.”
Dean had always thought that he and Charlie saw eye-to-eye on a lot of things, but now he’s starting to realize that they have very different definitions of the word
By now, Dean’s intimately familiar enough with Cas’s body, with the rising urgency of each gasp and groan, to know that Cas is so, so close. Dean fights to hold still so Cas can get there, even though he’s vibrating with impatience, shamelessly eager for Cas to spill down his throat, but Cas wrenches his head back, replacing Dean’s mouth with his own hand, watching Dean and quirking an expectant eyebrow.
after stuff like this, but he gets it now. It’s a two-way street; it’s something that makes Cas feel good too.
Cas is sitting behind his desk when Dean enters his office, looking on impassively as Dean closes the door behind him and steps forward. He doesn’t offer Dean a chair, so Dean stands in the middle of Cas’s excessively spacious office, trying not to fidget under Cas’s enigmatic gaze.
Keeping clean, as tedious as it seemed at first, is a part of that. He shuts himself in the bathroom, brushes his teeth while the shower heats up, undresses and peels back the curtain. Standing under the hot spray, he tries not to let his mind wander, as it sometimes does, as it’s done only more often lately—more time spent living like a human, perhaps. Or just more time spent with Dean. It’s tempting enough being alone with Dean and having him so close, even harder not to spin that temptation into fantasy at this particular moment, when he’s so aware of his own body,
“Good seeing you again, man,” Dean attempts as they pass, hoping he sounds casual and friendly.
so faintly that Castiel’s not convinced he’s even aware he’s doing it.
Now the moment’s finally here, and Dean has to force himself to breathe, keep himself in the moment even as he feels like he’s about to climb out of his skin, mind rapidly jumping ahead.
Castiel’s seen that inner turmoil quite a bit by now, those moments when Dean looks at him and so obviously
“Sorry to wake you,” Castiel says, keeping his voice low, almost intimate. “But Sam’s ready to leave. We were just waiting for you.”
“Good,” Dean says too quickly. “Great. You know, hanging in there. Same old, same old.” Oh god, he’s babbling, when did he turn into such a disaster, what is wrong with—
But the surprising thing that Dean always come back to, what he spends more time daydreaming about than he could’ve ever predicted, are Cas’s hands. His beautiful, absurdly giant and elegant hands.
What the hell is he supposed to do about this?
Dean laughs, a bright, sudden burst of sound, his embarrassment fading away. “Nah, can’t help you with that one, sorry,” he admits.
if he wants to be cheesy about it.
Cas echoes Dean’s sigh. “And a bribe might help?”
Unfortunately, that’s just the way emotions are – horribly unpredictable, impossible to control. Castiel had been much better at handling them before Dean came along.
Of course, seduction’s not really necessary when it comes to Cas. Cas smiles at him with undisguised interest and goes in for another kiss, but this time it’s softer, slower, a hint of what’s to come. Suddenly Dean thinks he might be the impatient one here instead of Cas.
Dean is just too impossibly lovely to ignore. Castiel used to liken the intrigue he felt to scientific fascination, but it was so much harder not to stare once he knew exactly why he was so interested in doing so. And now that he knows what Dean looks like with a soft, private smile, or flushed and panting, lips bitten, Castiel’s loathe to take his eyes off Dean for even a moment. He especially has no chance of being discreet now that he not only has Dean’s tacit permission, but his implicit encouragement as well.
“I mean—You’d stop if I asked you to, right?” He wants to confirm it out loud, even if he’s sure there’s no way in hell that Cas wouldn’t listen if Dean said he needed to tap out. That’s how he’s always been when they’re together – constantly checking in, making sure Dean’s enjoying himself. Dean can’t imagine that Cas would push him too hard. Unless Dean wanted him to.
But Cas is unmoved by Dean’s lack of subtlety, simply reaches back down and starts to work Dean back up, his touch steady and sure. He doesn’t even need to be told when Dean’s close, just eases off and resituates himself further up Dean’s body, knees tucked up against either side of Dean’s chest, his cock tantalizingly close to Dean’s mouth. Dean tries to part his lips and lean in but Cas threads his fingers through Dean’s hair and grips tight, keeps himself just out of Dean’s reach. Dean whimpers at the tease – he wants to pull Cas closer, dig his fingers into those gorgeous thighs and relish the feeling of Cas sliding hot along his tongue, but he resolutely keeps his hands where they are and doesn’t press his luck.
“The hell is a promposal?”
His head lolls back again when Cas’s free hand touches his sternum, travels languidly up his chest, resting huge and possessive against his throat. Dean doesn’t realize how
But the need is still stronger when Dean is physically near to him, when Castiel is able to look at him, get even closer and
something that seemed so scary before.
Cas shoots him a look, one that says they’re both aware of the answer to that question. He leans in further, fingers grazing Dean’s cheek, and responds anyway. “Because you like it when I tell you what to do.”
This is enough, for the moment, Cas’s tender kiss, his hand in Dean’s hair, the intangible, indescribable feeling of everything fitting into place, something going right for once in his miserable life.
Being reminded of his own arousal brings Dean back into focus a little, noticing the way his cock is straining and leaking as he thrusts into the friction offered by Cas’s firm flesh beneath him, feeling the building pleasure in his gut suddenly coiled tight as he chokes out Cas’s name.
He can tell Cas is really into it too, the way he drops onto one forearm braced beside Dean’s head, his movements more urgent, his breath heavy as he curls closer and touches their foreheads together. Dean sighs Cas’s name, tapering off into a gasp as Cas kisses along his jaw, scrapes his teeth against Dean’s throat.
Dean’s not really hoping for a chance to test that theory, but she could very well be right. “Thanks,” he says sincerely, not knowing what else to say at this point, even if that one word doesn’t begin to cover his overwhelming appreciation. He knows he’s not magically cured of all his fears and insecurities, but he feels a hell of a lot better actually addressing them, knowing he’s got someone to talk with again in the future.
he’s turning from Cas’s hand, face instantly flushing deeper to match. He lets out a broken moan watching Cas’s palm make contact with his ass, the noises escaping Dean’s lips growing louder as he surrenders to it. He closes his eyes again, overcome.
, and nothing bad happened. If that was what this evening was all about, then he’d have to call it a success.
Whatever was in Cas’s eyes starts to slip away too, and Dean can’t begin to imagine what the look on his face is supposed to mean. “Okay,” Cas says after a few beats, expression shifting into mild curiosity again.
The storm has long since passed by the time they get back on the road.
“You want coffee?” he asks after a few beats of comfortable silence. That’s about the furthest thing from his mind, but it’s a force of habit at this point.
“Uh—” Dean clears his throat, his eyes averted, a fetching blush staining his cheeks. He still has his hands on Castiel, but without the blatant desperation. “Morning,” he mutters with a quiet, self-deprecating laugh. “Didn’t know where you went,” he adds after another beat of silence.
For a few moments they just try to ease down from their high, Cas holding Dean close, Dean’s ankles crossed behind Cas’s back.
that feels good, pleasure bubbling up with sudden swiftness and insistence.
Cas gives him a look, fond and exasperated. “I’ll take care of the dishes. And Sam will call if he needs something from you.” He cradles Dean’s jaw, tilting his face up to look him in the eye. “My question was, what would you
“Are you letting me win?”
, and he keeps it close to his heart, guards it jealously like all of his other vulnerable secrets.
Of course, he has no idea how Cas will feel about all this, but Dean’s forced to admit that there’s only one way to find out. And even if Cas isn’t into it, Dean’s comforted by the knowledge that he’d at least hear Dean out and wouldn’t even dream of judging him. So as much as Dean would like to put the blame elsewhere, he knows that, as usual, any hang-ups or obstacles here are totally on him.
Dean had gotten used to from Cas, he’s definitely not getting it anymore. Which, he has to say, is a little weird.
It’s second nature for them now, almost automatic. A pattern well-worn and well-enjoyed, no frills, no frivolous detours.
So, okay, obviously he was wrong about the solution to his dream problem, which… complicates things.
, too close for Dean to not have it constantly on his mind, like he always does when they share a room.
The sound of Charlie clearing her throat – not for the first time, probably – cuts through the fog, and they pull away with palpable reluctance.
And he’s willing to bet that Cas could have some fun with it too, if he lets himself, because he knows he’s not the only one who had a shockingly amazing time in that filthy bar bathroom, but apparently Cas has gone ahead and convinced himself that he shouldn’t have. Dean can’t help but want him to get over it, because the idea of Cas getting a little…
“I’m fine,” Dean snaps, collapsing on the sand, exhausted.
Dean is the one to finally break the silence. “So,” he says, drawing the word out, pointedly making direct eye contact with Castiel. “Think I’ll go to bed.” He waits a tense beat before adding, “You coming?”
Dean thought he’d feel more closed off to a question like that, but he’s more open to this kind of discussion than he would’ve expected. That doesn’t mean he’s any better at articulating why this whole submission thing really does it for him. “It’s uh,” he attempts. “It’s, y’know. Fun. Exciting.” And that’s true, there’s an element of certain things just turning someone on like nobody’s business, in a primal, almost irrational way. There’s definitely more to it than that, though. “I… I dunno how to explain it.”
Then one night as they’re heading to bed, Dean’s en route to the dresser to dig out something comfy to crash in when Cas catches him by the wrist. He reels Dean in close, kisses him slow and thorough, pulls back just to look at him, expression thoughtful, thumb tracing Dean’s cheekbone, his mouth.
It doesn’t quite hurt on impact, at first, and Dean suspects that Cas might be going easy on him. A plea for Cas to give it to him
at the realization, a frisson of emotion that’s not entirely embarrassment or worry.
He complies with Dean’s request, moving incrementally deeper, as slow as he can manage and still be moving. He vigilantly tracks Dean’s reactions, every twitch of muscle and eyelid flutter, categorizing each gasp and moan – he knows the nuances of them so well by now, but Castiel’s exhilarated to realize that there are still new ones to discover.
Dean knows his question seems out of the blue, but Cas, predictably, doesn’t mind. “I remember,” he murmurs, still focused.
Castiel kisses him briefly, humming into it before withdrawing, just enough to show what he brought back from the bedroom. “Is this what you were looking for?”
to see. Maybe Dean wants him to see too.
him that Cas isn’t gentle. Well, he
It’s dumb, but those stubborn insecurities Dean has about always being the one whose devotion and loyalty aren’t quite reciprocated, who will inevitably get left behind, are a little quieter in those moments when Cas is staking his claim. Dean knows that he loves so fiercely and doesn’t always express it in a normal way. It’s like his tendency towards deep, borderline excessive emotions has met its match with Cas.
to see this.
Dean sucks in a breath, heart hammering beneath his ribcage. His eyes start to burn.
Cas looks away for a beat, schooling his intent stare into something more professional, but Dean notices the way he clears his throat before speaking, that there’s still a slight strain in his voice when he replies. “The only feasible way for a

if Dean wanted to seize it. He can’t even be mad at the presumption, can’t find it in him to be self-conscious about being found out – because it’s an honest-to-god relief that Cas sees right through him, knows what’s in his mind and, Jesus, in his
*   *   *
Cas raises an eyebrow. “Which frustrations are those?”
When Cas is close enough to touch, he stops and raises an eyebrow. “Did you enjoy your drink?”
And even more humiliating, it’s like they’re all torn from the pages of a trashy paperback. That whole
“Easy,” Castiel murmurs, thumbing at Dean’s sharp cheekbone, wiping away the tears threatening to spill.

He certainly remembers Dean saying as much, and he’s glad to see that Dean’s actually made the effort of putting on comfortable clothing before doing so.
he is, and in a brief moment of sleep-addled weakness he indulges his arousal and rocks down into the pressure. He loses himself in the promise of release before his higher brain function kicks in and he recoils, ashamed. He flops onto his back, staring into the darkness, wondering how this got out of hand so quickly.
, huh?” Dean teases, as if Castiel’s the one who’s palpably eager, as if his intrigue isn’t plainly written on his face.
, Dean actually moans aloud at the feeling of Cas’s strong fingers rendering him immobile. “You like that,” Cas says with dawning clarity, “When I hold you down. Don’t you?” Dean can only look up at him, wide-eyed, squirming just to feel his grip tighten, which might be answer enough, but Cas still leans in, nosing at his cheek and whispering, “
Castiel understands the feeling. “Good night, Dean.”
, longing for touch even if it’s just his own. He glances at Cas, hesitating, not even sure why he does it, but it’s a comfort and a thrill when Cas smiles, encouraging and a little bit smug, and murmurs, “

,” Dean scoffs. His annoyance is all sarcastic exaggeration, but the smile he breaks into is completely genuine.
“I’m good,” Dean finally replies. He starts to relax into the mattress, but he can tell that Cas is still tense behind him, so focused on doing this right, taking such good care of him as always. Dean couldn’t even imagine being with anyone else like this. Maybe the amazing part isn’t the act itself, it’s putting his complete trust in Cas and being rewarded for allowing himself to be vulnerable – it’s a sappy, embarrassing thought that Dean would never dare utter aloud, but in the buried parts of his psyche he acknowledges that it’s nothing but the truth.
“Ain’t much to tell.”
He could be content just holding Dean like this, enjoying the moment and watching over him while he gets his rest and some much-needed peace. But Castiel chooses to close his eyes too, impatient to spend tomorrow with Dean. To spend a lifetime with him.
“You got something to say?” His creepy grin is actually faltering now, and Dean would be proud of Cas’s display (and kind of turned on, to be honest) if he weren’t so worried that this is about to get out of hand. God, he just came here to unwind and have a few drinks, he doesn’t want to deal with a bunch of buzzed 20-somethings at
Castiel doesn’t
Cas holds him gently, kissing his cheek as he comes down from it, shaking all over, heart pounding, breath labored. But Dean doesn’t settle for long, starts up his movements again, kissing Cas fiercely, determined to make this good for him.
“Cas.”
Castiel knows that Dean will want to shower soon but not-so-secretly revels in this for the time being, so Castiel spends a few long minutes kissing him languidly, aware that Dean needs that intimate contact. They both do.
Castiel smiles wider. “So.”
Dean wakes up with surprisingly vivid images of fooling around with Cas, and it takes him a couple of sluggish blinks to realize that oh,
, that wasn’t a dream.
He places his hand on Dean’s shoulder, almost taken in by the desire to increase the pressure of his fingers, let his touch slide up Dean’s neck and into his hair, massage the tension and aches away.
Dean hesitates, almost seems to reach for Castiel before pulling his hand away at the last moment, swallowing hard and averting his eyes. “G’night.”
Sam excuses himself with a laugh and more heartfelt congratulations, the affection on Dean’s face growing warmer and softer now that he and Castiel have true solitude. Dean fists his hands in the collar of Castiel’s shirt and drags him in again, presses their mouths together slow and heated. Castiel savors the taste of him, his sweet mouth even sweeter from sugar and vanilla, the faint tang of liquor.
,” he says bitterly. Fuck, he should know better than to underestimate Cas, especially when it’ll keep him from nervously rambling on like a complete asshole.
“I mean, I usually—” Dean starts, before his brain catches up with him. Cas is so close all of a sudden, right in Dean’s space. “Uh,” Dean says intelligently, no idea where he was going with that—or what the hell is happening here, really.
“I did,” Cas says with a touch of mirth. “Eventually.” Dean wonders what went through Cas’s mind at the time, what made him decide he’d had enough of Dean’s bullshit and was going to do something about it.
Dean deserves nice things: simple pleasures, time to do what he wants – for himself, not what he thinks he needs to do. Castiel supposes he could use a bit of that too. And he can’t think of anything he’d rather be doing than spending time with Dean.
“They are, but not as much as some in the genus,” Cas informs him, stepping into Dean’s space to look with him. “Several species are so deadly that they’re colloquially referred to as ‘destroying angels,’” Cas mentions casually, leading them back onto the path while Dean does a double take.
Once they’re outside, Cas and Dean climb into the Impala while Jones starts up his cruiser. On most jobs, Dean would just hitch a ride to the crime scene with someone in the department, just to make things simpler, but Dean’s got no interest in spending more time with Jones than he has to.
if they were really equipped for that.
. Castiel is starting to understand how Dean could wear them with pride, how they were earned through an act of passion, not violence or hatred – the fact that Castiel could have truly hurt him, and easily too, but used his strength to give pleasure instead. They’re a reminder of what they’ve done, where Castiel has
Dean laughs again, mostly to himself. “Starting to think maybe I could use a push sometimes.”
Still, for a moment he hesitates, the same concerns crossing his mind as before, accidentally hurting Dean when he’s too overwhelmed to control himself. But now that the thought has entered his mind there’s no expelling it, and he can’t deny he likes the idea of it, making Dean come when he’s so full like this.
, there’s the undeniable proof of Dean’s pleasure staining Castiel’s fingers, smearing their stomachs, Castiel’s name a sigh on Dean’s perfect, pink lips.
“Which one is that?” Cas asks. “Is it this one?” he attempts, pitching the timbre of his words low and intense.
He turns out to be right about that.
God, he doesn’t know what the fuck he’s doing. Maybe he’s wrong about this whole thing—maybe it’s not worth risking what they have. Because what they have is good. Scary, complicated, but good. That’s enough, right? He could spend the rest of his days with things exactly how they are and be perfectly content.
again, far too soon.
But soon Castiel realizes that although he’s treasured their time here, there’s really nothing special about this place; this is all coming with them when they leave. His love for Dean has always followed him everywhere, through time and space, into death and back again. They may be nearing the end of their trip, but it’s only the first chapter in their lives together.
Castiel keeps Dean close afterwards as they doze off, tucked up behind Dean, pressing a kiss to his shoulder. Castiel’s proud of Dean for taking the steps to get them out here, grateful they’ve had this wonderful opportunity. He’s reluctant to leave, impossibly tempted to stay in this cozy little bubble they’ve crafted.
Jones sniffs. “Must be.”
He’s not sure what those
Castiel’s come to realize just how badly Dean craves affection, being touched with gentleness or just being held. He wonders how long Dean’s been needing that but forced to go unfulfilled, unwilling to ask even if he were presented with an opportunity. Castiel can think of no greater honor than to provide him with that. It’s profoundly rewarding to give Dean that comfort and protection, to know that Dean will let him, will enjoy it. Castiel’s made mistakes in his life, but being here like this, keeping Dean safely wrapped up in his embrace, he knows he’s doing something right.
They’re both breathing heavily when Cas pulls back and gazes into Dean’s eyes. Dean gets lost in it for a moment, almost –
Castiel nods, finally rising from the bed. “I’ll be outside.”
Dean snorts. “Dunno if it’ll look as good on me,” he replies, effectively playing the self-deprecation card while still paying Cas a compliment – and hopefully deflecting from how the idea of wearing Cas’s clothing interests him.
“So what’s this?” Dean asks, indicating the tree trunk he’s pinned against.
It doesn’t always feel that way to Castiel, but when Dean says it, it’s easier to think that could be the truth. If Dean can look at him the way he’s looking at Castiel right now, then he must see something worthwhile, and who is Castiel to question his judgment?
But when she huffs an impatient, “
To Castiel’s surprise, Dean doesn’t cue up the next film right away. “Supposed to get pretty cold tonight,” Dean says after a few beats, staring thoughtfully out the window. Castiel can hear the forced nonchalance in his voice and waits patiently to see what’s on Dean’s mind. “Maybe even snow.” He turns back to Castiel, biting his lip, squirming slightly – from nerves or anticipation, Castiel’s not sure. Perhaps both. “Might be nice to get a fire going.”
“Maybe we should head back,” Dean suggests. He’s mostly content to stay pinned underneath Cas like this, but he wouldn’t mind doing it somewhere more comfortable.
Dean opens his eyes, seeks out Cas’s, and he feels the tension drain from him almost immediately. There’s still some doubt, some lingering shame, but it’s overpowered, as usual, by the reminder that
. Cas seems to back off at the sound, until Dean hisses, “
His other hand wraps around his cock again – he has the feeling Cas was about to tell him to do so – and he tries to slip his finger deeper, crook it at the right angle. It’s shamefully gratifying to have at least
“My TV’s better,” Dean insists, but the almost imperceptible waver in his voice tells Castiel all he needs to know about how this ostensibly casual offer is anything but.
Dean’s only managed to shed his overshirt, suddenly overwhelmed and too distracted to make a real effort, and he can’t just blame the rising steam for the way he’s starting to sweat, t-shirt clinging to his skin. He tugs half-heartedly at the hem of it, vaguely aware that he should just take it off, but he stops dead when Cas locks eyes with him and steps closer, his hands finding Dean’s and helping him to peel it off, his fingers sliding up Dean’s stomach and chest.
“Yeah, I can—” Dean stops and swallows when one of Cas’s buttons pops free, and he has to collect himself for a moment, starkly reminded of straddling Cas in a pile of hay and all but tearing his shirt open. When he notices Cas staring at him, he clears his throat and turns around to open a drawer full of shirts, eager to change the subject. “You can’t just go digging around in someone’s dresser, all right?”
at the same time. Cas feels so damn good,
gasping an endless stream of, “Yeah,
“I know,” Cas says gently. It wasn’t too long ago that Dean would’ve thought that Cas wouldn’t understand something like this, but Cas has been so supportive, so enthusiastic about all of it, that Dean can’t help but ask for more. “But I have to be sure,” he says, one hand sliding down Dean’s back to his ass and resting there. “I need you to tell me.”
, feel so good in me, Cas, love this, please, want it harder, harder, god,
with him, has no desire to leave or look for anything else. Cas has told him that so many times, showed him even more often than that, but it still comes as a surprise to Dean that he’s actually started to believe it.
He must space out for a minute there, actually, because when he snaps himself out of it, schooling his features into something more neutral and turning back to the sheriff, he can’t help but notice a change in Jones’s demeanor when they lock eyes again, something even nastier than before. He doesn’t look so bored now, definitely paying Dean more attention, but there’s nothing friendly about it. There’s something dangerous there, cutting through the air of arrogant disinterest, watching Dean like a damn hawk, and Dean prays he’s imagining it, but he doesn’t feel so lucky.
Their kiss starts out almost sweet, but there’s still a fire coursing through Castiel’s veins and just ending the vampire’s life wasn’t enough to mollify it. He needs to erase that creature’s vile touch with his own. He has a fleeting thought about trying to slow himself down; they are essentially in public for goodness’ sake, and that might be passable privacy for a monster to its satiate its perverse appetites, but that is
“I do find you very distracting,” Cas admits, still caressing Dean’s cheek. “I wish I could kiss you all the time. Your mouth is so…” he trails off and leans in to demonstrate instead.
The room falls into darkness, but Dean’s too wired to sleep and just lies there stiffly, staring at the ceiling and listening to Cas’s gentle breathing.
Cas studies Dean in silence for a moment, before squaring his jaw. “You’ve been avoiding me.”
Dean’s thought about this, tried to cobble together some fantasy image based on what little pieces of information he’s collected throughout the years. But his imagination really didn’t do Cas any justice, didn’t fully represent his sturdy frame or his tan skin. He could look like anything, really, the point is that it’s
, how the gentle reverence in Cas’s touch made him feel special,
To Dean’s further chagrin, Cas backpedals and pokes his head into Dean’s room. “Did you say something?”
Castiel surges forward again, because for all the temptations he’s faced over these past weeks, Dean’s mouth was truly one of the hardest to resist, one he plans on eagerly indulging in now that he’s been given the chance.
“You got it.” Scott actually
Dean’s losing it, his unattended arousal blooming into something he could actually get off on if he had enough stimulation. He wouldn’t need much, but Cas doesn’t even allow any give for Dean to roll his hips up and seek out some relief. He tries to grind into the heat and pressure of Cas’s solid form between his legs, his thighs tensing, squeezing to get any kind of friction, and he manages to work up a rhythm that actually gets him right on the brink, embarrassingly close considering he’s fully clothed and barely been touched.
Castiel’s ashamed of himself for hesitating to put it right, the way he’s withdrawn, letting himself be stunned into guilty silence. He wants to reach out and pick up where Dean left off, massage the soreness out of his tender wrists, his legs, but he
Dean’s consistently swept up in the softness of Cas’s lips, the passion Cas always pours into this, whether it’s methodical and sweet or almost overwhelmingly intense, sloppy with their shared eagerness. There’s, well…
to stifle a moan when Cas takes over, using only the barest movements of his arm, but goddamn, it’s incredible.
Cas’s jaw clenches. “You—”
Cas, like he does almost everything nowadays, that’s a more recent twist, a new layer that quickly became integrated into the lifestyle he knows so well.
Because Cas has made it perfectly clear where his priorities are, and they’re not at home with Dean. And why the hell should they be? Dean knows it wouldn’t be a picnic to be saddled with him, especially with the way he’s been behaving lately.
“Couldn’t even stay still like you asked,” Dean mutters, more to himself now, turning his face into the pillow.
want, Cas?”
As much as Castiel would be perfectly happy to stay here, he doesn’t want to stare too long. Dean should be allowed to rest. He’s relieved when Dean doesn’t stir at his touch, hardly reacts even when Castiel carefully climbs out of bed. Dean must be exhausted from yesterday, on a physical level no doubt, but, even more trying for someone like him, on an emotional level as well.
“You’re entitled to your ignorant beliefs,” Cas says, perfectly neutral. “But I’m asking you politely to watch your mouth.”
Dean scrubs a hand over his face, looking away, flustered. “Fuck, I don’t know, I… never mind, just—Sorry.” He pretends he doesn’t hear Cas say his name. He’s already out the door anyway.
The heat rushes back to Dean’s face full force. “Um—”
“Yes,” Cas agrees, hot in Dean’s ear, “Very nice.” Feeling Cas’s presence behind him is giving him honest-to-god goosebumps, the air thick with unrealized potential in a way it hasn’t been since that first time.
It’s crazy to think that such a simple thing set them on this path and changed everything. The long term effects of it are what he treasures most, but the situation at hand – Cas’s stubble against his neck, one muscular thigh wedged between both of Dean’s – reminds him of the more immediate aftermath of that kiss, the tension between them finally shattering, losing themselves in one another with unrestrained fervor. “Yeah,” Dean says, fingers winding in the fabric of Cas’s shirt. “Then we, y’know—” He falters, licking his lips. “…Did other stuff.” It’s not the sexiest phrasing he could have chosen, but he can’t really be expected to be articulate when Cas’s fingers are circling one of nipples through his shirt.
And Cas has the nerve to roll his eyes before he stalks off, as if Dean’s the one ruining
Eventually, Dean sinks back to earth and sags against Cas, letting out a slow, contented sigh. Almost too soon he feels the cool tingle of Cas’s grace wash over him, cleaning him to a more presentable state – but not entirely immaculate, Dean can’t help but notice, clothes still rumpled, collarbones still shining with sweat.
Then a thought occurs to him. “You...” He hesitates briefly, “You knew what the mistletoe meant,” he says carefully.
Dean seems to be gravitating further north, and they find themselves booking the last available room in a converted beach house on Cape Cod. They stay for a week, spending a few lazy mornings eating breakfast in bed; in the evenings, they walk along the shoreline holding hands, salt water tickling their bare feet. In another life, Castiel thinks, they could have stayed here forever.
Dean almost wants to laugh as he smiles back at Cas, a wave of affection hitting him that’s so overwhelming his heart might burst. That doesn’t even scare him anymore. There was a time when this freaked him the hell out – the way he felt when he looked at Cas, when Cas looked at
“I believe I’ve already said it,” Cas replies, unflappable as ever. “Do you need me to repeat myself?”
It’s almost too much to bear, but Dean doesn’t dare look away, couldn’t even if he wanted to, held in the approaching figure’s thrall; all at once he realizes he
Dean had a similar experience, had just barely gotten to the point where he could own up to thinking about Cas that way and then there he was in all his glory, ridiculously gorgeous and all Dean’s to touch. He still remembers how much closer he felt to Cas, skin to skin, nothing hidden between them.
He feels utterly betrayed when Sam turns to Dean and suggests it: “Dude, she likes you. Go talk to her before she sets her sights on someone else.”
Dean doesn’t know what Cas is apologizing for – waking Dean up, the unintentional dry-humping, maybe both – but Dean isn’t complaining one bit about the proceedings. He just wants Cas to be, y’know,
to get his hands on all that sleek muscle, needs to touch Cas almost as badly as he needs Cas to touch him, to undress him, to get Dean ready for his cock.
This stuff happens behind Dean’s back sometimes, but Cas never misses a damn thing. Dean doesn’t know if these guys said or did something while he was pre-occupied, but whatever it was, it’s obviously gotten a rise out of Cas. Cas curtly ends the interview, not that these people were much help anyway, and the next thing Dean knows, he’s being pulled down the hallway, around a corner, and into an empty office. It’s only “empty” in the sense that no one is currently in the room and the lights are off, but it clearly belongs to someone who could come back at any second. Cas doesn’t seem to give a shit about that, and Dean decides he doesn’t either.
Dean’s not sure why Cas is telling him this. He doesn’t usually bother. “How long?” he asks, before he can stop himself.
Dean’s struck with another dose of déjà vu as Cas unbuckles his belt and eases his zipper down, gets him just undressed enough to get his hands on Dean properly while Dean scrambles to return the favor. That was all they could allow themselves that first time, but now he doesn’t have to content himself with whatever he can get in the shortest amount of time, and he needs Cas naked right this goddamn second, greedy for every bit of skin.
, Cas, Jesus.”
Dean needs that, the promise of having Cas to rely on, to ground him, because he feels like he’s falling apart, cock throbbing and leaking beneath Cas’s fingers, his every nerve a livewire, about to burst at the seams, and Cas is there to see him through it.
Dean usually likes getting into character playing FBI, feels more in control and protected donning a suit and carrying a badge, but that armor’s useless against someone like Jones. The only authority he respects is his own, and Dean might actually admire that if Jones weren’t such an asshole on top of it. Dean’s not intimidated by him, not really, but if Jones sees something in Dean that he doesn’t like, he can’t really be counted on for civility. This could get ugly pretty fast.
“Hey, Sammy!” he breaks away long enough to holler, no idea if Sam can even hear him from wherever he wandered off to, “Guess who just got hitched?” He can’t even wait for a response before Cas hauls him forward for another kiss.
“No,” Castiel deadpans, not even looking away from the tome he’s flipping through. He intends it as a joke, but there’s no denying the underlying truth.
“I’m fine,” Cas replies, tone inscrutable.
,” Dean whimpers, still working himself over, pleasure steadily mounting.
, that’s what Dean wanted.
“Cas,” Dean gasps. Castiel can read the urgency in his voice clearly, how he’s so worked up already, just from the thought of what’s to come. He rolls his hips to meet each stroke of Castiel’s fingers, needing Castiel to give him more. He can’t stand to be teased anymore, and frankly, Castiel can’t take this for much longer either.
where no one’s gonna be a dick about it.”
written off as nothing, knowing that given Dean’s confused, conflicted feelings, his actions might not mean what it seems like they do. But if he opens his mind up to the possibility, he thinks he understands that look now, recognizes it because it’s no doubt the same expression he has on his own face whenever Dean is around. A certain yearning and affection, some unbearable mixture of misery and hope.
a nice day…” he says with a sigh, faux skepticism seamlessly transitioning into a genuine spark of intrigue.
so he keeps his arms at his sides.
“Fuck no,” Dean promptly cuts in, grinning slyly at Cas, grinning wider when he gets a smile in return.
Stupid, stupid,
right under Dean’s nose. He used to picture Cas hunched over a dusty book when he wasn’t around, and now Dean’s going to have a drastically different image in mind—one he shouldn’t dwell on, especially when Cas is right in front of him.
He rolls over towards the wall, able to make out a few stars through the windows. He tries to slow his breathing when he hears Cas come in and shut the light off. Dean’s hyperaware of Cas’s presence between their beds, and in the dark and quiet, he allows himself to wonder what it would be like for Cas to get under the blankets and settle in beside him.
It just wouldn’t be right to try to rope Cas into anything more… serious. He’s dreamed of Cas as a freakin’
It’s been another late night on the road, another run down motel in the middle of nowhere, like countless others he’s stayed in. That’s been Dean’s life almost as long as he can remember – killing monsters, long stretches of highway, a brief reprieve before starting the cycle over again. Doing it with Cas,
