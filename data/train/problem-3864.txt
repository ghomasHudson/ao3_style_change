Jack grabs his teddy and bounces off and out of the room. A beat passes of just tense, prolonged eye contact, silence. Jack’s footsteps echo and fade out.
The dinner’s at Dean’s house, because they collectively agree that if the cooking is left up to anyone else, it probably wouldn’t be that great of a time. Eileen comes to help out, though, because she’s a capable human being who knows how to take care of herself. That can’t be said for anyone else attending the dinner. There’s not much else to do but wait for the burgers to fry, so Dean and Eileen chill in the kitchen and talk.
Castiel steps forward some more, and holds on to a cell bar for support. He’s having a hard time standing.
Sam heaves a deep sigh. Oh, to be the only one with a brain cell. Cas stares at Dean firmly, while he averts his eyes. Jack’s oblivious, as always.
The Impala rolls into the dirt outside the abandoned warehouse. It’s their usual gig. There’s little fence left to block their entry into it.
make this world better. You’ve done good, Jack.” He hears a sniff from the side of his shoulder, and suddenly he has an armful of crying
“I don’t need more of you!” the Empty pleaded, gesturing vaguely at Chuck and Dean, black tears streaming down its face. “It’s too loud here!”
Cas, I- I’ve been trying to get you back. I’ve tried everything, I’ve done everything to… I’m so sorry, Cas. I’m so sorry.
Sam waits for Dean’s answer. He’s definitely talked with Eileen about this beforehand, she knows his answer.
Dean looks at Sam, shakes his head, and grimaces. The “I’m probably gonna die,” speech buffers in Dean’s head before he starts talking.
Sam just gives a LOOK. Yeah, he knows. And no, he did not ever mention any so-called “feelings” for Cas, which Dean is now just noticing. His face falls from anger.
Yeah... recent events, y’know, what’s the point? Lie to yourself, feel more manly, feel like shit, never give the one person- never give him a chance.
You were never my father. And I was meant to bring paradise... but I failed. With my real father’s help. So I won’t help you. Not with anything.
CASTIEL is sitting on the side of the bed, quietly staring into the wall. Surprisingly, he’s not wearing his trenchcoat, but Dean’s AC/DC shirt and sweats. Dean stirs and slowly shambles up, blinking, confused.
Like this, I get away with kiddy stuff more. Like Jerry, he believed I was clueless. And I like being goofy. I like being a kid, like you said. It’s less... heavy.
DEAN and SAM walk into the library, Sam losing patience, and Dean just angry. Dean paces back and forth while Sam slumps into one of the wooden chairs.
And how do you even know he swings that way, mister? He doesn’t seem all that interested, in my opinion. Now if you were harassing a federal agent-
They just... touched them. And they were out like a light. I ran as fast as I could. I-I don’t know... Somehow I escaped.
“Actually, uh, dad. It’s not a joke,” he says, avoiding eye contact. His voice comes out with the volume of someone who knows what the fuck they’re doing, but that idea is immediately contracticed with his voice dripping with uncertainty and nerves.
The Empty’s a little too distracted to deal with something as small as me sneaking in. Which is, of course, how we’re going to sneak you out.
“Watch your next words, Dean,” John growls. And inside him, the child he never was is still there, flinching away from John’s next hit, but Dean straightens up, trying not to listen.
Valeria turns to Castiel and smiles softly. Amp up the creep music, we’re realizing what she wants with him.
Don’t- this conversation isn’t about that, okay? I’m pissed. You died on me, and expected me to- to live on?
Eileen signs “awake.” Sam shakes his head and looks down, before gazing at Eileen guiltily. He signs back:
“You… don’t?” Dean’s never seen Cas this uncertain before, and it’s a little adorable but mostly concerning.
Dad did the best he could. And since when is this a problem? Jack’s been fine on his own, like we were fine on our own.
Looking at Cas, Dean sees barely hidden righteous rage. He knows he’s- or probably John’s- in for it. “Dean.” Cas grabs both sides of his face. “You didn’t deserve to hear that at such a young age. No child should hear that their love is sinful. Chuck didn’t care about sexuality and we are the
Sam walks over to watch the burning with Dean, looking at him questioningly. With the fire lighting up the brothers’ faces,
Dean stands up and turns around. Castiel is standing by the edge of the yard, watching a Fake Dean rake leaves. Dean walks to the back of Castiel to stand and watch with him, disbelieving.
Castiel was never very cultured in the unsaid. He doesn't hear, "I love you," he doesn't hear, "I want you, I need you." He hears the words and thinks, at least you don't hate me, at least I'm useful, at least I can do this for you.
Castiel rolls his eyes, then a creaky door clicks and slams shut. Dean looks around frantically for something to defend himself with, but comes up empty. Cas just struggles against his binds some more.
Robert shakes his head off and tries to get up, then there’s a figure. A flickering ghost, in pastor’s clothes - PASTOR JOHN.
Oh, honey, I don’t get jealous of repressed, depressed, and pitiful lumberjacks with crushes on Angels. Tell me Dean, after all this time, have you even made a move? One little, itty bitty, peck on the cheeks kiss?
, you can sit down and we’ll have a nice, civil dinner while you pretend not to be homophobic. Clear?” Cas growls, and Dean shifts in his seat- when did his pants get so uncomfortable?
“Dean!” Mary jumps right into Dean’s arms for a warming hug that relaxes Dean a bit. Not much, but he’ll take it.
I don’t know. She said her name was Valeria. But my heart hurts, it's beating so fast and I’m so scared, Dean. It was so dark there. Empty.
It’s around now that we realize SHERIFF HANSON has been standing there the whole time. Sam clears his throat and shakes hands with the sheriff.
WIDE SHOT now on the entire bar atmosphere, tables thrown and glasses shattered, plates and food everywhere. There are a few bodies slumped on tables, some of them stabbed to the wall to pose. There are some glowing signs that let us know we’re in an LA bar. There’s blood spattered on that too.
Dean pauses at the threshold of the War Room and the Library. CLOSE ON Dean’s face as he starts to tear up. He rubs his eyes, then continues out. ON Sam, sighing.
Dean’s the one that leans back in for a proper kiss. It starts getting heated, and when Dean’s thinking about taking it further- adding tongue and all that- Cas just steps back like he’s been burned.
I’ve done a little research, and there are no signs of Chuck’s meddling, at least not that I can see. We have no reason not to trust Amara, right?
You make out with him once. You know, it’s been years since then, right? Years. We’ve been through hell and back together and you what, wanted to fuck him? What a deep, touching love story!
Dean kisses the fuck out of him, and doesn't say it, he can't. He hopes Cas will hear it when he hugs him tight- I-can't-breathe-Dean-tight. And he does. Castiel hears, "I love you," so loudly as it rings through Dean's head. He hears, "never do that again, I love you, please stay," and finally he believes he's truly, truly wanted. Loved.
Dean’s eyes widen. Meg goes back to singing and The Empty covers its ears. The screaming, whispering, and murmuring of other dead things in the Empty starts to get louder.
Oh, and yours is? You were a douchebag to him from the start. It’s a wonder he could even stand you. As I recall, he smiled the most when it was little old me taking care of him in the koo-koo closet. Who cares how long you had, he wouldn’t be happy with you.
“Now I know you don’t mean that, boy, so why don’t we continue having our nice, civil dinner without you pretending to be a fa-”
Cas reluctantly lets John go, eyeing Dean suspiciously. Immediately, John punches Cas only to learn what Dean did 12 years ago,
Castiel, I know. Quite frankly I don’t know why you bother. He’s dead, he’s alive, he’s crazy, he’s God... he’ll be back anyhow one way or another.
Dark goo- all too familiar- started forming behind Chuck. Dean kicked him in, leaving no time for Chuck to react, and jumped after, hearing shouts of protest echo away. It was Chuck, Dean, and this newly formed dark figure, slowly turning into Meg’s last meatsuit.
Yeah, I want to have him here. He’s always coped with deaths by throwing himself in hunting, and I just got him back but... What he’s doing seems a little more healthy, even if it is a little weird.
If I don’t come back from this, you can move on. You’ve done it before, you can do it again. But if you don’t come back? What happens to Eileen? And Jack?
Jack looks at Dean with irresistible puppy dog eyes. Dean lets Jack down slowly, who runs directly over to Miracle to hug him. Miracle’s gentle with Jack, because god, what a perfect dog. Sam straightens from leaning down to pet Miracle, and looks at Dean with a mix of pride and confusion.
I’ve set up a spell of sorts. Chuck and I... our power is being slowly distributed into the universe. By the time he notices, we’ll be human.
There’s a reason you were pulled to here, specifically. The Empty is weak around this spot. I’ll be able to tear open a rift. It won’t last long, given the Empty’s current state of affairs. I-
Dean continues carrying Cas the rest of the way as if nothing happened. Sam giggles, then signs to Eileen:
Okay, add that to the list of vague shit my brother has said that clearly affects him that he won’t talk about.
"Don't do this, Cas," he says, and Castiel finally hears it, the unsaid. "Don't do this to me, I love you, please stay."
Sam, Dean, and Castiel walk into the bar (sounds like a bad joke) with their Fed suits on (Castiel is still sans trench coat), flashing their badges and ducking under some police tape to make their way to who looks like the sheriff.
“The Empty.” Jack explained, too knowingly, to Sam. “It would come when he was truly happy… and- and it must’ve been able to kill Billie.” Jack was solemn. They were reserved, repressing, not crying just yet. It seemed they weren’t really present. Taken like a true Winchester.
Dean’s half up, and gives a little “well what the fuck” look and chuckle at Cas before sobering up a little, shocked.
Sam’s got his little (ish) body spread across one of the motel beds while Dean prepares his guns on the bed across from Sam.
Big fucking difference it makes when you leave me, just- just there, alone, to deal with the shit you piled on to me! How could I- What the hell do I even do after that, Cas?
No, man, he was just like “oh, tea party’s done, guess I’m being kidnapped now,” like Jesus, what a kid.
“Shut it, Sam. You knew as well as I did. Never that smart, that good a hunter, and now we find out he’s-” John glances at Cas with more than a little fear in his eyes. “...Gay.”
Glenn looks at Dean, betrayal and anger seeping through. John advances on Glenn and lands a punch to his jaw.
You’re brother’s right. The Empty is vast, dark, and confusing. I can’t help you there, and you can’t bring Jack.
Dean starts running with Cas hooked over his shoulders. Cas hobbled a bit, slowing Dean down. Cas looks back at Meg, who smiles and continues singing Mamma Mia. What a relationship.
Dude. You look like a love sick fourteen year old. Did you talk to him? Why do I feel like it didn’t go well?
I’m not gay, if that’s what you’re thinking. Women and men, if that’s gonna save my fragile masculinity.
Oh, Lucifer turned him that way. Got mad or something. I’m thinking that’s why this little peeper’s out of the Empty, huh bud?
Sam’s pacing between two tables, his phone framed in the foreground of the shot, quiet. Then it buzzes and lights up. Sam hastily walks over to it, smiling. On it, a message.
At that point we see Castiel doing air quotes from behind his back in chains. Dean almost snickers. Sam’s still rolling around in his cell playing with cushions.
SAM’s cooking bacon (real bacon) and eggs. EXTREME CLOSE UP on the bacon before we PAN OUT. Then, FULL ON the room, EILEEN walking into the kitchen in one of Sam’s baggy t-shirts and her own sweats. She makes her way over to Sam and leans against him, both smiling.
You humans can go in. I’ll be waiting to pull you back out. It won’t last long, though. If you stay in there for... I will still try, but I doubt I’ll be able to bring you back, with your angel.
“No, no, no, NO!” the Empty cried. “I wanted him to suffer! I want him asleep! But you woke him up, and now I want you both out!”
Cas isn’t in a cell. He’s in the center of the room, made up of soft looking white chairs and stylish modern tables. Dean squints at Cas’ position: he’s laid back on one of the reclining chairs with his arms tied behind it.
He’s a kid. Always has been, even if we didn’t let him. I’m what he’s got left, with C- him gone. I’m the worst guy for the job, but I’m not going to- He’s not going to hunt. He’s gonna be a goofy kid.
Then, in purgatory, having lost Cas, Dean can't stand it anymore. Can't stand the unsaid, the thoughts always bubbling beneath the surface. So he says what he can in a prayer, "I should've stopped you," "You're my best friend," "I hope you can hear me," I hope you're not gone already. Then when he sees Castiel again, he decides. I'm going to say it, I'm going to tell you I love you, but Cas stopped him. They moved on. Dean thought, you don't want to hear it, that's okay, you're here and I love you and that's all I need.
LOW ANGLE on a puddle of blood, next to a face stabbed through the mouth, eyes wide open and empty. We can see more bodies scattered across the bar, but they’re blurry and hardly in frame.
. Dean whips around and finds Cas just standing there, awkwardly shifting on his feet in his stupid, adorable tax accountant get-up. Dean feels warmth in his cheeks and his mouth is unwillingly pulled up into a smile. Dean runs at Cas and crashes into him with a hug. Or embrace, or whatever’s most romantic.
Amara raises her hand sadly, about to- but then Jack runs up to Dean and hugs him, dropping his teddy along the way.
Note: for the dream atmosphere, boost the blue colors and lower contrast. Like deep under a faded ocean.
"I love you," Castiel says, with the spear of Michael poisoning his body, "I love you all." What's left out is "I love you, Dean. I'm in love with you and you changed me." Without those words, Dean chooses to believe it's family love, because that's what he knows. He doesn't know how to be in love, and he doesn't think he deserves to.
He’s cut off by footstep sounds. Dean’s entire body tenses while Sam and Jack get ready for Cas’ arrival in a normal person way. CASTIEL walks into the Library, holding his damaged trench coat instead of wearing it.
Dean comes out of the bathroom, rubbing his shoulder covered by the sleeve. Then comes Jack and Sam, briskly walking somewhere. As they nearly pass him, he looks at them confused.
Dean nods to himself more than to anybody else and smirks, humorlessly. “Look, I could internalize all those fancy little words you’re telling me. I could hate myself for being what I am. But I did that already, and gotta say, not super jazzed about the results. Them being: oh, you know, hurting the people I
love you, and that’s all that matters. If he believes that merely because it’s homosexual love that it’s inherently sinful, I can quietly glare thoughts that he should go to hell. Not literally, of course, I don’t truly believe he deserves eternal torment. Though, under Rowena’s control…”
It’s, uh, it’s the scar that Dean got when Cas pulled him out of hell. Cas healed it, like, a year later, but I guess it’s... back?
Dean turns a funny shade of red and chokes on his own spit. Sam cackles and Castiel looks at least a little ashamed.
Sam looks reasonably shocked. Castiel rolls his eyes. Dean’s being dramatic. Pump up the lover’s quarrel music. And with our little team free will staring at each other dramatically as always-
Dr Ackles winks and that’s about when Dean snaps. He drags Cas away from Ackles by the arm and gives the meanest death glare imaginable.
They sit and wallow in their angsty thoughts together, before Dean inhales sharply, getting Castiel’s attention.
Dean looks at the two nuns sympathetically. They don’t advance on him or do anything other than hold hands and nod.
Dean walks over and ruffles Jack’s hair. He sits down next to him and sighs deeply, rubbing his hand over his hair. Anxiety.
Dean walks out the motel door, shutting it behind him, without further word. With the click of the door,
Oh, friend’s house. Having a sleepover like a normal little tween. Anyhow, I rented Tombstone for tonight, you’re gonna love it.
What led up to Jenny’s disappearance? Anything out of the ordinary, cold spots, strange smells, was she maybe acting suddenly different?
“John, go. You need to leave.” Mary squeezes John’s shoulder, but it’s less of comfort and more of a threat. John listens.
Jack, I forgive you for that, okay? I-it was terrible, and I’m still angry, but you’re just a kid, Jack. And I care about you, I’m... I’m not faking it.
Yeah. So I’m figuring we bust in there, I try to get the victims out, and you salt and burn the guy.
“Oh. Okay. Noted.” Cas nods seriously, like he’s gonna need this information for the test on Friday. Dean snickers and leans against Cas some more.
Well, I was thinking, hit up the witnesses to double check, then settle in a motel to check out where they could be hiding.
Dean gets up and runs over to Pastor John’s grave, and opens the casket. He tries and fails to light his lighter a few times, swearing under his breath. It catches, then, EXTREME CLOSEUP ON the lighter, with a SEAMLESS CUT to:
Dean glances behind them, hearing the goo, and picks up the pace, trying to haul Cas along as fast as possible.
If you’re referring to the deal I made with the Empty, might I remind you it was fulfilled in saving your life?
he’s got no clue) finishes and the credits roll, Dean’s got a shake in his hands that is slowly getting stronger. Cas takes Dean's hand and kisses each fingertip, then looks at him with concern.
Hey, missed Monday update but who cares! There's like four people who've read this! I appreciate those of you who've made it to here, it really means something that I can share my trashy fanfic.
Cas shakes his head, disappointed. “Jack has to meet with Rowena to deal with some demonic rebellions, but I’m sure there will be other ones for him to join us with.”
Well, I looked into the other victims a little. While you were zonked yesterday, I also had time to interview another witness.
Weird. It feels, y’know, good. But for him, I mean, no time passed. He’s acting... y’know, because of Cas, and now his fatherly instincts are taking over... He didn’t live without me like I did with him, it's just... I don’t know, weird.
Valeria caresses Cas’ face softly with her hand. Castiel jolts back but is still tied down, helpless to her.
“In the beginning, it was only Chuck, Amara, the Empty, and maybe Death. So they can coexist, and we just kinda gotta hope they’ll stay. Chuck has no way to get out, and we have this spell that can attempt to give the Empty no way to Earth either. It’s not foolproof, but-”
Sam chuckles, then signs the interaction to Eileen, who laughs heartily back. They keep driving. Series of cuts on each of the team, slowly getting more tired, but Dean’s getting more determined. It gets darker outside.
Sam is torn between a bitchface and absolute terror. He waits on Dean to explain what the hell’s going on.
Dean Winchester. The fuck do you want? There’s no way in hell you’re FBI so what are you doing here?
Intensely aggressive support. Like, I want to go shout out “my brother is bisexual and out!” so hard I’m barely resisting the urge.
Sam nodded, wary of what Dean would need to do to connect with the Empty, afraid that it would break him even further. But then there Dean was, leaning against a bookshelf, clearly a little more than tipsy.
Dean shakes his head, and looks to his shoulder. The Bloody Handprint. He turns back to Jack and puts a hand on his shoulder.
Eileen gives two dorky thumbs up, and Sam leans in for a kiss. Dean would tease them, he really would, but... not right now. He smiles bitterly. He’s happy for them.
Glenn pauses, considering, but no one’s safe from Sam’s puppy dog eyes. Glenn trusts the Moose, and nods slowly.
Whatever. But thank you, for saving my husband. Out of curiosity, did you ever come out to your dad? The one who...
In the church. But something’s been bothering me, y’know, why just disappearances? Why wouldn’t the ghost kill them?
Y’know, a little advice? Whatever you’re fighting over, whatever is coming between you two, people who fight like that really love each other. This thing, it’ll all seem like nothing when it’s over.
Dean clutches his shoulder and the handprint’s glow subsides. He lets out a long sigh, then pauses briefly before responding.
Uh oh. Dean’s starting to turn into one of those people that cry when they get angry. Meg nods, knowing not to push any further.
Glenn’s absolutely speechless, and so is Dean. They lean further in to each other, and GAY KISS. What? Dean Winchester? Kissing a guy? More likely than you might think.
I mean, nothing, mostly. I just... When Chuck decided I should live on, I had a hard time without you, Dean. I just want my brother back.
“What? Not my fault he was obvious. So what’s the problem, he clearly loves you back, right?” She faces Dean with an expectant expression.
Dean gets up and starts walking towards the map room where he can access the hallways. He stops at the threshold.
Dean looks up and to his right, and there Castiel - in his old, season 8 trench coat - stands above a kneeling, praying FAKE DEAN with a knife held to his throat. Castiel looks desperate and afraid.
An uncomfortable silence ensues. Jack’s oblivious, of course, just enjoying his eggs and bacon. But Sam and Eileen look at each other, then back to Dean, who pulls out a flask from his sweatpants, about to drink from it when Sam snatches it away.
Yeah, that Sam. Look, you know we’re not feds, but we’re here to help. Now, the only connection I see between your husband and the other vics is that you’re all queer.
Styrofoam Plates by Death Cab for Cutie is the song of the episode, which I got from looking up "daddy issues songs." Pretty effective, right? I had a great time writing this episode. Saileen or bust. Jack should've been a real baby, sorry Alexander Calvert. I love the handprint scar.
You can’t, you can’t do that- he- I thought it was just an alliance, Valeria. Not a romance, not a real marriage.
Maybe they’re on a joyride tour. Lucifer’s got his wings, it’s not like transportation is a problem.
“I don’t, um. I am devastatingly in love with you. I don’t… sex doesn’t appeal to me. With you, I...” Cas swallows. “With you it may be different. But I may never be able to do that for you. I don’t- I don’t know.
“Dean Winchester has-” Michael had been driving for a while, but breathed suddenly, and his eyes glowed. Sam guessed Adam wanted to step in. Adam cleared his throat. “Well, Dean is- was- connected to Cas. Again, I’m… I’m really sorry. But Cas is in the Empty now, and Dean’s here, on Earth...” Adam trailed off, a guilty look on his face.
Finally, a moment to breathe. Dean stands fully up and shucks his sleeve back down. Sam opens his mouth, but grimaces and taps Jack’s shoulder, indicating that he should probably explain. Jack’s jolted out of a staring match with the handprint scar.
Cas passes out on Dean’s shoulder again. Sam starts laughing uncontrollably, and Eileen joins in. Jack just beams like the little ray of sunshine he is.
Dean’s in the middle of a drink when we cut to the scene. He’s out of his fed suit and into his usual flannel with the addition of the Bloody Handprint jacket. The bar’s moderately filled. From the side, we can see a blonde woman - RUDY - eying Dean. She walks over and sits next to him
“So, hey Cas. I hear you’re, y’know, not dead.” The wind is as good encouragement as any for him to keep going. “I, uh, wanted to talk to you. Y’know, ‘bout what you said before- you- you
What- what about Chuck? How... there’s no guarantee he’s not gonna come back and mess with us. Or someone else. Or the world. Amara-
Look, Jenny came out as a lesbian to me before our parents. I thought we could convince them that it wasn’t a sin, that Jenny was who she was but...
Dean and Sam look up to see DJINN ONE standing a few feet across from them, pacing slowly and in proper disney villain style.
The Impala pulls into the dirt next to the barn. It’s worn past when we last saw it, a few sheets of the roof have gone. Dean gets out of the car first, and we have a solitary shot of Dean standing there, looking out at the barn.
Jack winks exaggeratedly at Dean, facing away so the three Djinn don’t see it. Dean, Sam, and Eileen share looks of confusion.
CUT BACK to Lucifer, grinning with his eyes glowing and holding how his hand for his superpower shoot stuff. Y’know.
“I swear on our child, Cas, if you finish that sentence with something even resembling emotionally stunted or repressed I will-”
Sam’s looking between Glenn and Dean. Dean’s looking at the floor guiltily, and Glenn’s glaring directly at Dean. Sam huffs.
While the signing conversation is happening: Blurry in the foreground, Jack, Miracle, and Dean are talking, muffled and quiet.
“Is he dead?” Jack managed to get out, their voice breaking through every word. Dean just nodded slowly, carefully.
Sam and Eileen sit at the motel table, laptops and books out in front of each of them. Sam taps Eileen to let her know Jack and Dean have entered. Jack’s still groggily clinging to his teddy bear, while Dean is looking angry. Well, like always. Jack shambles over to the bed and faceplants into it.
Dean lifts up the sleeve of his shirt to line his hand up with the handprint scar, and he sniffles, determined not to cry. He flops back first onto the bed and stares at the ceiling. He’s lost, empty, blank.
I don’t know. I could float the pencil but I can’t fly, can’t do anything else, really, but sense this- this thing. Maybe I’m glitching, maybe it’s nothing.
he found again. Sam, of course, was still canoodling around on Earth. Dean liked that. Because of his heroic nonsense in defeating Chuck, the whole world got to live. To find happiness. Everyone- everyone except-
Then, a MONTAGE of shots: Nothing fully visible. Knives, slicing into faces. The scream that follows. Feet kicking shins and knocking someone down before a fist connects with their face over, and over, and over again.
God, what do I even say when he wakes up? Sorry? By the way, love you too? What the fuck do I even say. What the f-
Look, I’ll tell you all about it later. I just came here, saw Jack, asked him what the hell, and here we are. Do not wake him up, he deserves this.
“I hope you’ve come bearing gifts. We’re kind of…” the words faded out, having left the rest of the sentence for everyone’s imagination. Screwed. Hopeless. Fucked.
Dean and Cas are now exiting Cassandra’s room, in the hallway, looking back through the window at Cassandra, still grieving her legs.
“Okay?” Deans still really confused, but then he nods with a silent little “o.” “You’re asexual? Sorry, for being full-on gay for you I’m not very. Y’know, versed in this shit.”
Dean hops and holds his foot, carefully taking the glass out of it before throwing it off onto the floor. He then flops down on the bed face-first, groaning.
"All of you! OUT!" the Empty shouted, the shrill voice echoing through the void. The figures started shambling toward the portal, and Dean quickened his steps, trying not to be caught in the path of any of them.
I, uh... I was gonna tell him how I felt, too. But there wasn’t time, and I didn’t think he could even feel for me.
Dean leaves one last lingering look to his (alive) family, turns back to the portal, and steps in. The portal closes around him, stitching itself back up in the same halting and flickering way.
.” Cas sighs, staring at Dean with unbearable fondness. “You have saved me from a lifeless existence, taught me love, and brought me happiness. So I vow, Dean. I vow to save you from anything that dares threaten you. I vow to teach you anything you’d like to know. Bring you anything you’d like to have. I am no servant of God, but of you. I will do anything and everything for you, Dean Winchester, I already have. I vow to love you endlessly and unbearably for the rest of my existence. I love you.”
Dean looks at Glenn sympathetically. He knows a little about going back to the flask. Hell, he has one in his Fed suit now.
Dean chuckles, reminiscing about Old Cas and how stuck up he was, but also how dorky and naive. FLASH CUTS of footage from LAZARUS RISING, the handprint, Cas tilting his head, “you don’t think you deserve to be saved.” He takes his hand slowly off of the scar, then closes his eyes to pray again.
Sam and Eileen get out of Eileen’s Car in sync, both dressed up in Fed suits. They start walking up the sidewalk to the average, but kinda broken up house. There’s a noticeable amount of paint peeling off. Eileen turns to Sam and signs:
It’s a beautiful place. Sterile, tasteful wall patterns and stylish furniture. There are people - clearly wealthy people - walking around, relaxing, talking to people at the front desk.
When Castiel is human, he dies, however briefly. Dean says "Cas," and "Cas!" and "CAS!" He means, "Cas, stop it, stop dying, Cas! I don't want you to die, CAS! Please, I love you, stay alive." Castiel comes back, and Dean says "never do that again." This time, Castiel hears what he means. He hears "don't die on me, Cas," he hears "I need you," and for Castiel, being needed is enough. He doesn't know that he's wanted. When he hears the explanation that Dean had tricked the reaper into saving him, he says "you lied." Because one of the first lessons he received from Dean was that when you lied, it's because it's something you really, really want. Then he knows he's wanted, and he cherishes it.
EILEEN is standing next to the map table with a duffle bag, grinning and posing with her arms out in a “ta-da!” Sam signs Eileen’s name sign to her as he speaks.
Fine. I needed you to get that nephilim, to get those Winchesters up and in action, and to the Empty, to get Castiel. Now-
Cas had heard vague mumblings, but was edging in and out of consciousness so much he couldn't tell which were dreams. Something about good to have you back, memory foam mattress, and I hope you don’t mind this bed, I assume we’ll be using it together. It was Dean’s voice, but clearly Cas was dreaming about his regrets, because those words used together implied something that Cas could never have.
Dean and Jack get up to circle Djinn One, who looks around at them, panicked. He knows he’s no match for the Winchesers. He turns to Jack, and yells.
Sam’s whole body language practically says “dude.” Dean rolls his eyes and broods his way out of the bar.
Sam, Dean, and Eileen carefully step over some broken glass in the warehouse. Distantly, they spot the abducted people strung up and being fed to the Djinn, who are nowhere to be seen.
Cas shifts- Dean glances over, concerned he might be nervous or… But then he sees the expression on Cas’ face. Full smiting power at the ready, staring directly at John. Hell, Dean’s surprised his eyes aren’t glowing right now. John notices and immediately straightens, sizing Cas up.
CASSANDRA LEMMINGS is looking out the window mournfully when we see her. Unsurprisingly, and totally unsubtly, she has dark hair and blue eyes.
Dean stands and just stares at Castiel from afar for a hot second. Sam is not having a good time being witness to this eyefucking. But then-
Jack lets go of Dean, then runs over to give Sam and Eileen quick hugs. Dean shakes his head disbelievingly and scoffs.
Dean looks at Jack fondly. Then CLOSE ON Dean’s jacket, The Jacket, with the bloody handprint. Sam eyes it suspiciously.
Dean can’t handle staring at the blue eyes that came from Cas any longer, so he hugs Jack tight again, whispering “I’m sorry.”
Cas doesn’t get to finish his thought. The Empty’s goo starts racing toward them on the ground, behind them. It bubbles up and flows like a turbulent river, but is far enough away for them to be safe for now.
Sam starts full-on sobbing then, looking far smaller than the 6’4” man he is. He hugs Eileen tightly. He can’t let go of her too.
I remember you saying we weren’t family. And you never... you didn’t treat me like this after - after what I did to Mary.
More flashing and spinning cuts, now Dean’s laying on the ground, holding on to the bloody handprint on his jacket.
They were supposed to taunt Chuck into showing, then open that rift to the Empty with Dean’s prayers, chuck Chuck in, and leave it, sealing the rift forever, never letting anyone from the Empty ever return. But if no one could return, Cas couldn’t return. He’d be stuck there, forever, having never known- never known that- he could’ve- it didn’t matter. Cas was coming back.
But I can show you the truth. Years of being in the business of granting wishes, making dreams come true, making people happy... gives a little insight on the opposite, misery. And you’re miserable, Castiel.
Just then, HARD CUT to the doors of the Church, being kicked open by Sam and Dean, carrying shotguns. Pastor John whips his head around and retracts his hand from Jenny’s chest. A salt bullet spray goes through him, and he’s swept away like dust.
Oh! There was a girl, wasn’t there? Her name was like... uh, Stacy. Yeah. Did something happen with her?
Dean starts running for him. Meg leisurely follows. Dean kneels down next to Castiel, turning him onto his back, shaking him.
Jack’s sitting watching scooby doo with attentive fascination, petting Miracle absently. It’s very Cas, which stings Dean right in the heart.
Sam, Dean, and Eileen step out of the Impala and walk around it in sync to get to the trunk. They pull out their silver blades covered in blood and nod at each other, ready to set their plan into motion. CUT TO closer on the warehouse, with Sam, Dean, and Eileen stalking towards a door half broken off its hinges.
“Mary, you’re in on it too!” He chuckles. “Oh, boy, now that was a hooter. Most adrenaline I’ve seen since I’ve been dead! And that includes my soul banging its way out of hell.”
He’s awake, Dean thought, relieved. He searched the surprisingly (and by that he means totally unsurprisingly) empty landscape for Cas, who suddenly appeared laying down a few feet (whatever that meant here) away.
You could say he was dragged to another plane of existence. It’s too late. All I’ve got is his son now, and I’ll do it right for him. Otherwise... I’m just hanging on.
Dean’s still in firm denial. He wasn’t mistreated, he wasn’t hurt, he’s fine. See? He’s tearing up and on the edge of a breakdown. Totally fine.
Especially. When you were gone- he was just exhausted. Didn’t care about things the way he normally did. So we- he- is glad you’re back.
Means that whatever your little rag-tag team of heroes did, it annoyed the hell out of the Empty. It’s loud, as you can tell.
I saw people get murdered, right in front of me, and I’m lucky to be alive but- but all I can think about is that I’m never going to move again. I-I’m never going to get to swim, or run, or even walk and it’s not like I did that all the time either! I just- You take a thing for granted, y’know? And now...
Michael shook his head, disgusted. “A human you sent me to hell with has been kinder and more sincere to me than you ever were.”
Eileen’s watching Sam from the passenger’s seat to read his lips with an understanding and concerned expression on her face. Sam seems kind of heavy-hearted.
After that, we took her to the old abandoned church. Thought some time alone with prayer would do her good, that maybe god would forgive her for her sins.
Dean stumbles off the bed as he drinks more, shattering a beer bottle and crushing a can with his feet.
“Oh, hi guys, didn’t expect to see you so soon,” he chucked, appearing out of nowhere, waving and moving so casually, like he hadn’t just ended everyone else’s world. Chuck surveilled the people there, eyes going first to Jack, then Sam, Dean, and finally Michael. “Oh hey kid, funny seeing you here.”
Yeah. I don’t know, why don’t you go talk to Jack? He’s seen Lucifer and the Djinn Queen last, might as well see what he knows.
“Well, not so much anymore. But the majority of them were set on starting the apocalypse in 2009. And in 2013, Metatron tricked me into making them fall to Earth where they created gangs of themselves, taking humans as vessels and uncaring of their survival. Dean likes to say they’re…
That never had to be your job, you know. You tried, you failed, we all do that. I ever tell you Cas tried to be God one time?
Sam, look. It was the nineties. I kissed a queer boy at school. Dad did what any parent would do back then, beat the shit out of me, called me a fag, it’s no big de-
Kind offer, but I’m married, and not particularly interested in minors. Sit down. Do you have a... binder, notebook, or writing utensil?
Jack said he’s, uh, “feeling” something with his powers. Don’t know what yet, but there’s something in the bunker.
“Dean,” Cas said, their tone walking the line between thankful and regretful. “You don’t have to change your behavior because of what I said before I died.”
Dean turns to the class and gives a blonde girl - STACY - a big wink. Then the camera turns to the guy sitting next to her, rolling his eyes. Dark hair, blue eyes - GLENN HARRIS. Then back on Dean, who looks away as if he wasn’t checking him out.
The Djinn nods, motioning to the bloody handprint on Dean’s shoulder. He looks at it, confused, and goes back to the Djinn. He schools his expression back to macho man aggression.
Sam, Eileen, and Jack turn to greet Dean. Jack jumps out of his seat and hugs him. Dean grumbles and hesitantly hugs back.
It wasn’t on a whim. I needed fruit from the tree of life for the spell to locate Jack- maybe two years ago? But I needed to barter, and that was the price.
Meg leans toward Dean to taunt him. Dean rolls his eyes. He does not want to deal with this right now.
A newspaper, blood dripping over it. A hand comes into frame, swishing a knife back and forth, until suddenly A FUCKING DEAD GUY drops onto the table and is stabbed immediately, grusomely, through the heart.
It’s hardly a kiss, really, not what you’d see with Dean making out in closets with the girls at high school. Just a cute little peck that makes them both pull back blushing.
Jerry sighs and gets out of the car, looking in the window. ANGLE IN to see Jack, playing with Marvelous Marvin the Talking Teddy, setting up a fake tea-party looking game. Jerry looks amused that this supposedly vital creature is a toddler.
Blinking his eyes open, Cas found Dean silently watching from a chair pulled out from a desk. “Hey Cas, welcome to the land of the living.” Dean smiled and flushed. Cas was going to question why, but more important questions needed answering.
No one knows what to say, then. It’s different, with Jack being little. He can get away with a lot more. Dean aggressively scoots back his chair and starts walking out, regret evident on his face.
, man. I- That’s not a killer set-up for a good time for me, by the way. I-” Dean looks around, and as expected, no one’s there yet. He sighs and looks down. The phantom grief pulls at his ribs.
The Impala rolls into the driveway, sluggish, with Dean driving and Sam in shotgun. They’re in their Fed suits. The house looks well kept and utterly average. Sam and Dean get out of the car in sync. They leisurely walk up the stones leading to the door.
THEN: Newspapers, clipping, websites, all and any news articles talking about brutal murders with a certain Lucifer and Valeria plastered all over it.
Look, I don’t know if your buddies set you up to this, but it’s not funny. You’ve been following me around for a week. And if I recall, you fled the moment you heard I was gay. So either get straight to the bullying, or leave me alone.
It’s especially hard when the people around you aren’t really there for you, y’know? They can say they understand, but they won’t, not really. And they might not even... think to care.
The beginning of the apocalypse, which never came to pass. It’s a story for another time. What would you like to do now?
Then, when your dad came home, he yelled at me. Let your dad punch me, told me to get the hell away.
“Oh, sorry, Sam,” Cas says, “We’ll catch up with you after your meeting with Eileen.” Cas smiles and nods at Sam for him to go. Sam steps in for a quick hug first, squeezing tight then letting go.
that he’s alive, or as alive as he can be in heaven, you know. Are you gonna tell me how that went down?”
We need to get you a swear jar, but for “get this.” You know you say that practically ten times a day.
Jack stands up, pouting only for a moment that he has to abandon his tea party. Then he picks up Marvelous Marvin the Talking Teddy and walks out the door calmly. Jerry is left blinking and clueless, but he shrugs and decides to go with it.
Wonderful show, adorable, really. But Castiel is never going to believe you’re really here to save him. Genius on my part, right? Tortured him with time after time of you here, just like this, coming to get him. He won’t go with you, not that I’d let that even happen.
The door clicked open, and hushed murmurs were exchanged. It was Sam and Jack, no doubt. Dean didn’t care though. Cas was- he was- he- Cas-
Dean sighs. “It’s not that simple, Jo.” He downs the rest of his whiskey glass to give him time to figure out what to say. “I- We’ve been through a lot since you guys died, okay? A lot. I’ve hurt him.”
Dean wretches the stone cover off Pastor John’s grave and tosses the slab onto the ground beside him. MATCH CUT with:
“Go get your man, you dumbass! And don’t you be coming back here until you do!” Ellen whacks Dean with a bar towel and stares. When he doesn’t move- not Dean’s fault he was in shock- she raises her eyebrow and gestures towards the door. “I gotta tell you twice?”
Dean walks Robert back to the front door, then Robert looks at Dean hesitantly. With a “go ahead” nod from him, Robert knocks on the door.
Eileen, Sam, and Jack get out of the car. Jack’s still holding his teddy. They each make their way to stand next to Dean.
I’m here to help. I meant what I said in heaven, I am truly sorry that Castiel has met this fate. So I have a plan.
Okay, so Dean died on a hunt. Eileen got erased- she’s back, don’t worry- I had a fake old person life, we went to Heaven-
Castiel unfolds it and gives Dean an earnest look. He remembers why he fell in love, and smiles sheepishly looking down on it.
Every now and again after that, when Jack wasn’t busy, they’d have family dinners with him, Cas, and Jack. He was going through a dinosaur phase, Dean learned. It caused a shiny warmth in his stomach every time he learned something about the kid, because he was still so innocent in many ways. He asked about what to do as God and that’s definitely not in the parenting books, but…
The door slamming sends the room into a silence not unlike the final scream of the dead. But then suddenly, Mary starts quietly sobbing and holding her head in her hands. Dean takes that opportunity to race up the stairs and into his room, where he can fill a quiet place with his cries, too.
Dean’s eyes reflect the flames, but this time his gaze is resolute. This time, he knows he’s doing the right thing.
Castiel closes his eyes and winces as his hand, puppeted, is forced to stab into Fake Dean’s throat. Castiel’s hand retracts, still holding the blade, mechanically. Another glimpse at Real Dean’s face, confused.
This is the time when Dr Ackles decides to show up. He comes from behind Cas and puts a hand on his shoulder.
Sam signs the “I missed you,” in ASL, facing Eileen. Shestarts grinning at him, and takes one of his hands off the wheel to hold in between them. Sam smiles, shyly, and looks away.
. I- I can’t help but love you, I don’t think Dean can either, but- we aren’t proud to have you as a father either. And I wish-” Sam clears his throat, tears forming in his eyes. Dean struggles not to join him in the waterworks, holding on to Cas’ hand.
Sam gets up from the couch and walks up the stairs, sending Dean a clear look of “don’t piss them off, please.” Dean and the Browns look at each other with a whole bucket of tension.
Hey, Cassandra. I’m agent Irons and this is my partner, agent Krussen. Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?
Dean slowly loses consciousness. The music starts fading out, leaving only his sobbing sounds. When his muscles fall limp,
What, uh, what Chuck said was that he kept trying to get us away from each other. Had to... kill you off. Do- do you remember that? It’s all fuzzy and fake in my head.
Dean’s only half joking. He chuckles deliriously. Jack puts down Marvelous Marvin the Talking Teddy, and looks at Dean, trying to soothe the beast.
Dean still hasn’t talked to Jack. And he really, really wants to, so one day, he leaves a note in his and Cas’ house saying he’s going out. And he goes to the same field to pray.
bad stuff, but strong enough to get a buzz in heaven. Apparently, getting blackout drunk is not the goal of this whole paradise thing. Dean has other plans.
Dean’s fond smile turns into a coughing fit, alerting both Castiel and Jack. Jack smiles. Castiel - well, gay panic is in full force.
Cas is the one to start to pull back, and Dean lets him. “I- your prayer, you don’t have to say anything. I’m content. We can- carry on. As... normal.” Cas smiles awkwardly, though it looks like he’s in pain.
Jack shook their head. “The Empty has no power over Chuck and vice versa. And how do we know, if this does work, that the Empty wouldn’t just spit them back out like it did with-” Jack coughed, cleared their throat, and opened their mouth to finish the sentence. They then closed it, shaking their head.
Jack sits on the side of the bed patiently, with Miracle already sprawled out and ready to sleep on the edge of it. Jack is staring pretty blankly into Marvelous Marvin the Talking Teddy’s eyes as he holds him.
As the bridge of the song plays, ANGLE ON Sam, Eileen, and Dean. They take turns cleaning guns, sharpening blades, and looking up lore. They get three silver knives dipped in lamb’s blood and grab their stuff, preparing to head out.
“I’m serious, Dean. We are your friends, you know that right? You’re clearly working through shit and it’s heaven. Want me to take it up with the big man upstairs?” Jo tilts her head over to try and catch Dean’s eyes.
The door opens, Sam walking in with Eileen following behind him. She closes the door behind them, and Sam turns to her to talk.
WIDE SHOT of: Dean’s carrying Castiel’s unconscious body across the dirt to the Impala, Jack, Sam, and Eileen following behind. Amara’s already standing beside the Impala. PAN CLOSER as TFW gets closer to the car.
Dean feels heat gathering in his cheeks and hopes to G- Jack that he’s not actually blushing like a highschooler. “Well, uh, yeah. Is that important?”
They’re still in the same positions, but Eileen yawns and Sam stretches out. Jack bounces Marvelous Marvin the Talking Teddy unenthusiastically before setting him down.
“I can’t believe it! You married CAS? And you didn’t tell me?!” Sam looks halfway between joy and absolute rage, which is pretty impressive. Dean has no idea what to do with that. He backs off a bit and leans into Cas accidentally, but maybe a little purposefully.
“Of course.” Jack nods seriously, and Dean has no idea how the kid used to remind him of Lucifer- there’s not a drop of blood in his body (if God has a real, bloody body) that isn’t entirely Cas’ son.
Castiel falls unconscious onto Dean. Dean pulls Cas into his lap and checks him over, then looks at Sam, wide-eyed with a sliver of hope.
Cas has that same look in his eyes the day he was taken by the Empty, but with so much more satisfaction, joy, and unfiltered
I know. I know how it is. I’m sorry it ended the way it did. Now whatever you’re doing to help the missing people... thanks. But I- I think I need to be alone right now.
Dean breaks out in hysterical laughter. Castiel chuckles low and quiet. Sam enters and has a reasonable amount of confusion on his face.
Jack tilts his head in an oh so Cas was it makes Dean’s anxiety ridden heart melt. “You’re not alive.”
It’s great that you’re showing you care, really, but you gotta take care of yourself too! You’re breaking down every day, wearing the same damn bloody jacket you won’t even tell me about!
Dean runs a hand over his face to collect some kind of dignity in protest of the wet steaks down it. “Turning the guilt outward, huh? Guess I know where I learned that from…”
Glenn rolls his eyes at Dean, then looks at him with the “you know what you just said, bitch” glare.
It was dad, wasn’t it? I get the feeling there’s more to the story than Glenn told us. Or that he even knew.
Then he came back, we were a family, his son did some stupid shit, and we fought. It was bad for a while... Then I told him I forgave him.
Sam doesn’t even flinch or look to her, just nods. Brief ZOOM IN on the carved names. They’re all dead, all except Sam.
Shit, sorry. I know you’re concerned about it being real and I haven’t given you the full story, then assuming we’re still, y’know, together I just-
Little Jack has puppy eyes staring at Dean, who grabs the remote and turns off the TV. Dean’s tearing up, running his hand through his hair.
“See, nothing can stop such a great being as that. Light and darkness and all.” Adam gestured vaguely upward. “But we can get them outta here. For, well, probably some time.”
"C'mon Cas, let's go. Let's get outta here." Dean picked Cas up bridal style, and started meandering toward the little rip in the Empty 's blackness.
“Hello!” Jack pops up in front of Dean with a wide smile on his face and his little wave. It warms Dean to the heart- a heart that is beating very quickly right now because he wasn’t expecting such an immediate response.
Your daughter came out to you, and you brought her to an abandoned church to leave her there? For god to forgive her for her sins? I’ve seen monsters, and man you’re-
“Speaking of- I’m engaged to Castiel, the man, the myth, the angel!” Dean announces with clearly fake glee and humor, grabbing Cas’ hand and holding it up.
Dean comes out of the bathroom with spiky wet hair and a new set of clothes - except for the jacket. He kept that on. It’s starting to become his signature look.
“I’m fine.” See? Exhibit A of being fine. Dean tips his head down to stare at his hands, fidgeting with the glass.
Yeah, I remember everything up until I died. Don’t remember my soul going anywhere though, heaven or hell.
She’s gone. Lucifer looks around, sighs and drags his feet as he begins to journey through the vast Empty.
Cas slumps, relieved. “Yes, I believe that’s a partially accurate term. I’m sorry, you may change your mind about- me, but-”
You’re right. It’s weird, and three Djinn with all those victims are not going to be easy for us to handle.
JUMP CUT to Dean, kneeling on the bed, putting his hands together. Tears are streaming down his face, drying up.
Did she make you sign a prenup? Are you exclusive, or polyamorous? How many “I love you’s” have you exchanged-
Dean comes out of the gas station store to see someone in a beige trenchcoat, facing away, on the phone. It looks like Cas. He rushes over to them, only to turn them around and see a stranger, looking back at him with confusion. Dean looks like he apologizes, then backs off, staring longing at him.
Dean’s plan included jumping into that rift himself and either bringing Cas with him or never leaving Cas again. It wasn’t much of a plan, he knew the Empty was a vast space where nothing could be found if it didn’t want to be, but Dean didn’t care. Fuck all of them, fuck everything, I need to tell him I- It didn’t matter what Dean felt or how thought out this plan was.  Cas was getting back and that sonofabitch was going to live and be free and happy whether he liked it or not.
“Father,” Michael spat out with disdain. It could’ve been funny how similar he and Dean sounded when talking about their dads, you know, if not for everything going to shit.
Sam sets down the bag and the crinkling causes Dean to start shifting. He has his face buried in the pillow. He says some muffled garble.
She went on a hunt with Jody and Donna, remember? She told you, like, half an hour ago when she left?
Yes. Be- be gentle, though. Her legs... they’re paralyzed. The attacker stabbed her through the spinal cord, and she’s, well, she’s not going to walk again. She got the news a few hours ago, so expect some coping.
Djinn One squares up with Eileen while Sam gets up to come to her defense. Dean fumbles to a stance then rushes over to Jerry, stabbing him through the heart in the back. The body slumps to the side of Jack, who Dean fusses over for a second.
“I’m a fuckin’ wimp, aren’t I?” No one gives him an answer. He wasn’t really looking for one, anyway, though. Sighing, Dean hops into the driver's seat of the Impala and turns the ignition, smiling at the familiar rumble. “This time, we’re gonna find him, Baby.”
Dean sticks out his hand to sign, shakily getting his thumb and index finger out, but then his hand is snapped to the bar and he grunts with the impact. Dean’s eyes well up. He’s silently crying.
for you, and ask you to stay with me, for us. And finally, I vow to you, myself. I am yours, Cas. I’m yours.”
Glenn breaks his pencil lead from pushing down too hard, and fixes Dean with a hellish glare, just silently staring. Dean backs off a little.
Dean throws back the rest of his whiskey and motions for another while Rudy is only about halfway through hers.
Robert and Glenn pull back from each other and share a soft kiss. When they pull back, we look over to Dean, awkwardly staring into the distance. Robert and Glenn hold each other by the side.
No really, it’s adorable how you just thirst after this little fallen Angel. You’re not worth him, you know.
“Boy, you really had me going!” He heaves another surprised laugh then calms down slowly, letting out small bursts of guffaws every few seconds before he stops entirely. “That was one hell of a prank, Dean. I believed it for a second! Man, so one night stands only? Still that man-whore you were like in your twenties?” Disturbing mirth dances around in John’s eyes, and some sort of twisted pride.
“Son,” Chuck sighed out, “Working with the Winchesters. You know,” Chuck pointed, not really to anything, “these guys used to be my favorite. But they’re so frustrating. Now you? My most loyal child?”
Dean scoffs. It may be true, but when has that ever stopped the famed Dean Winchester from good-old-fashioned denial?
Cas, no. Naomi’s long dead. It’s over, okay? You’re in the Empty. You gotta wake up, we gotta get out of here.
“I sat there for hours, you know. Hearing your speech over and over again. I hated- I still hate myself for not saying anything back.”
Another turn where Pastor John is waiting slashing at him. Robert has to lunge to get out of his way. He starts running then down into the-
BLOOD, KNIVES, AND EVERYTHING (not) NICE on the News Broadcast, showing Lucifer and Queen Valeria on their murder-fest. TFW 1.0 shares a grim, terrified look, before we-
“There’s way too much to tell, Dean,” Eileen says and signs. Dean has no idea what the signs means and can’t really follow both at the same time, but he appreciates the opportunity to learn. “We had long lives.”
A beat passes, Glenn staring at Dean a little differently. Then, it CLICKS. He immediately stops glaring and just stares wide-eyed. He sees something new.
He was telling Jack a story, we didn’t get the chance. Now fill me in, do we know where Lucifer and Valeria are?
Dean doesn’t look away from Jack. His face clearly says “no, everything is not back in order. This fucking sucks.”
Dean’s back in bed, awake suddenly. He sits up again to look at the spot where Cas had been sitting. Dean sniffles, shaking his head.
Dean whips around at the ready, and then there’s Meg, standing with her hands on her hips, her typical playfulness there.
Yeah. Because of that shit he put in my head... He died thinking he couldn’t have me. I was his. Fuck, I could’ve made him happy. I could’ve-
“You’re gonna bring him back. Now!” Dean yelled desperately. He thought, absently, that if Chuck really did bring Ca- him back, he’d collapse into that angel’s arms and never end up saving the world.
“No, that couldn’t… Dean,” Sam said Dean’s name all caring and worried and shit. Like it helped. Like losing someone like Cas could be fixed with a little worry and comfort.
Jack settles in for the story, pulling Marvelous Marvin the Talking Teddy close to his chest and looking just bright and excited.
Dean’s mouth snaps shut again with the invisible force, and a piece of duct tape flies out from nowhere on to his face. Queen Valeria glares at him. Dean grabs on to the bars and does his best to communicate with his eyes. Then, looking at Sam (who’s basically asleep by now) he gains a little brain cell.
TFW’s smiles, Castiel sleeping, Amara satisfied. But there’s a small black liquid dripping from a hole in reality, where the portal used to be. It’s small enough that we wouldn’t notice, but the camera focuses on it.
Then Valeria and Lucifer grin at each other, menacing and devil-ish. Dramatic music as much as we’d like- this is not going to be good. Then-
And we were once connected, Dean. I care for you, and I know what you feel for Castiel. I felt it, when our souls were bonded.
Cas shakes his head, caressing Dean’s face with tenderness despite his calloused fingertips. “He doesn’t hate you. He hates that you made him realize what he’s done.”
“Yeah, well, you can have it. Me. Or whatever…” Dean trails off and scratches the back of his neck. Is it just him, or did heaven get hotter? Is he blushing? Can you blush in heaven? When he finally looks up to see Cas’ reaction-
Cas couldn't help but smirk a little. "Why don't we find out?" Dean sucked in a breath, and what they “found out” was their business.
Cas faces Sam to address him with that serious energy he’s always carrying around him. If Dean was a weaker man, he’d totally think it’s hot (Dean is oh so weak). “Good morning, Sam. Welcome to heaven. What’s wrong with Dean?”
Pastor John advances on Dean, still against the pew struggling. Pastor John grips Dean’s throat and starts digging his nails in. Dean struggles to grab his candle holder. He manages to get his fingertips on it and bring it close to swipe it through Pastor John’s ghost.
She cackles, then grabs Sam’s hand to hold. A brief CLOSE UP on that, then it blurs to the foreground as we see Dean reach the Impala. PAN OVER to Dean opening the Impala’s backseat and laying Cas down there. Amara steps closer to Dean to chat. (Sam, Eileen, and Jack are having an indistinguishable conversation in the background.)
Dean half-heartedly gestures, shrugging. Like that explained it. Sam contemplates for a moment, then thinks he’s got it.
SAM’s walking through the hallway, head slumped to look at his phone. He’s typing again, happily texting somebody. (We all know it’s Eileen)
“Huh,” John grunts, and starts eating. With his cue, everyone else starts to begin on their burgers and fries. Cas just picks at it, since he doesn’t need to eat, but Dean’s filled with pride that he likes it enough to have
It’s for you, dumbass. I uh, I took a while picking it out. Y’know, figure I’ll have to see it all the time so- not like I care-
Dean sets up the tv. It’s up to the set dressers to make this historically accurate, quite frankly, the point is that the movie’s on. While Dean’s doing that, Glenn goes to the mini kitchen, and comes out (haha) with popcorn.
Eileen and Sam end their kiss, but remain close to each other. Eileen tilts her head to the side, resting a finger on her chin. She’s thinking.
Glenn rolls his eyes, then exasperatedly hands Dean a pencil and some notebook paper. Dean raises an eyebrow, but accepts. Glenn turns back to his own work without a further thought.
Then we PAN OUT and rotate further, and there’s another figure behind Lucifer. A woman, brown hair, tan skin - QUEEN VALERIA stands with her arms folded in front of her. She’s wearing a dress suitable for a business meeting. There are GLOWING BLUE TATTOOS all over her, classic Djinn.
Sam gives his signature bitchface to Eileen, who smiles despite, well, the entire situation around them.
Lucifer’s eyes turn red, and Jack steps back in fear. The energy thrumming from him becomes the jack-using-angel-power-noise.
“We belong here, not in harmony, and not destroying an Earth you built so beautifully. I’m sorry.” Amara seemed at least a little apologetic, but not very. She seemed happy with what she was doing. She was brought into the black goo in peace.
Dean, you dumbass. She cannot hear you, or read your lips when you face away from her. The silence stretches for a bit. He looks over to see Sam waiting for him to realize, and Eileen just waiting for an answer. Facing them now, he repeats.
They had most of the spell ingredients. All they needed was a powerful connection from someone on Earth to the Empty, the power of Death, and Chuck and Amara’s gullibility.
“I do, Cas. Look, I was raised to be a man’s man, and not in the fun way. I wasn’t- y’know, I was supposed to like women.” Dean sighs, rubbing his hand on the back of his head. There’s a lot… just,
Jack starts shifting, making disgruntled noises and waking up. Marvelous Marvin the Talking Teddy falls off the bed as he sits up. Sam and Dean are snapped out of their little man-off stare-off, and Dean walks over to him to fuss. He pushes something out of Jack’s hair and picks up Marvelous Marvin the Talking Teddy to give back to Jack.
That’s enough of that! I’m very happy for you, I’m gonna go see my wife, you work out. Uh, that.” Sam motions vaguely to Dean and Cas’ entire bodies, which are way closer than Dean thought. He takes a step back for polite company, and clears his throat.
Castiel runs. Of course he does, he could hurt Dean like this, he can't do that again. He says "I need to protect the tablet from Heaven and from you," and means "I need to protect you from Heaven and what they've done to me, I need to protect this tablet because Heaven will use it to hurt you, and I love you."
In the foreground, a blurry Castiel and Jack are sitting on the ground and playing with a wooden train set and transformer action figure. ANGLE ON the doorway, Dean walks over and leans against it.
He steps out of the car and breathes in the crisp, cool air. With the exhale, Dean pushes the door closed and starts walking out and into the field.
Look, man, I’m not gonna bully you or anything, okay? I just wanna say we got off on the wrong start and I wanna fix it.
Castiel’s turn for the queer panic. Wide, very surprised eyes and a stare directed at Dean. He looks back. Sam suffers through more prolonged eye contact.
I don’t know... I’ve signed myself up for a shrink, but I don’t know how talking about how much this sucks is gonna make it suck any less. But I’ve got family, too. They’re on their way.
Sam and Jack are still sitting on the library table, just quietly, but then - Jack’s eyes shoot open and start glowing orange.
“Will what?” Cas says, with the steely gaze of someone who can kick ass and knows it. “What can you do to an Angel, Dean?” He steps closer, leaning into Dean’s personal space. He’s so close Dean can feel his subtle breath on his lips. Despite Cas being shorter by around an inch, it feels like he’s being loomed over. It’s hella intimidating, and
After all I think we both know who’s more important to him. I’ll give you three guesses. The kid he’s been raising for eh, three years? Or the kid brother he’s looked after, raised, fed and changed his little diaper, since he was four.
Dean sniffs a little. He’s ashamed to say so, but he’s tearing up and definitely in for a good cry. But he feels like he needs it, and… well, no one’s ever told him that before. He knew, rationally, he was fine but…
“Ow! Cas! There’s nothing wrong with me!” Dean pushes him off after a particularly painful pinch to the cheek. Like a grandma.
Dean groans. Castiel looks relieved as hell. Sam walks into the doorway and pauses, staring at Cas and Dean just sitting and staring at each other.
!” Dean runs his hands through his hair and looks up to see their reaction. He finds the expected wide eyes and dropped jaws of surprise. From Jo. Ellen just nods and smiles bittersweetly.
“As I stated before, you don’t have to say anything, Dean.” Cas looks at him, tilting his head and giving him regretful baby blue puppy-dog eyes.
Dean throws his whiskey bottle across the room. It shatters against the door, the pieces falling in a pile next to it. Dean pouts and groans.
Dean’s driving, Sam shotgun, with Jack and Eileen in the back. Eileen’s holding Jack’s teddy and making little cooing noises while Jack chuckles. Dean’s still in just his t-shirt, which is weird, so little layers, but just so we can see the handprint peeking out.
Cas decides this is the perfect time to interject. “Well, John, my father was god and we defeated him. Do you really think you have any power here?”
That night Dean and Cas are having a little movie night. Neither of them really cares about the movie, and their thinly veiled excuse of “movie night” is quickly turning into “we-both-know-that-we-just-want-to-sit-on-the-couch-and-cuddle-so-put-on-something-I-guess.” Well, Dean’s not complaining.
"I will get you back, Cas. I love you too, and you're not going out like that you stupid, stupid son of a bitch."
Eileen can’t hear them, and is still on lookout when another Djinn knocks her out with a baseball bat. Then FLASH CUTS to Sam and Dean, struggling against their respective Djinn. Sam manages to flip his around once, but is immediately thrown onto the ground and knocked out. Dean gets on top of his Djinn for a few seconds struggling, before it overpowers him and clocks him in the face. He falls unconscious.
Anyways guys, since you’re weak and frail and I have you pinned against a wall, d’you think it’s time for a big villain speech?
Can we talk about this, Dean? I mean, you can’t just keep- look, the more you keep it in, the worse it’s gonna get.
Wow. He’s never seen Cas that wide-eyed, not even in the brothel he took him to. Cas is in disbelief. It’s kinda (
Cas closes his eyes and breathes deeply for a long, long moment to regain his composure. “Okay, Sam,” he says, very solemnly. “There must be something deeply wrong. Dean, who have you married? I can’t believe you would do that to me.” All deadpan.
Dean plops down on the seat next to Glenn suddenly. Glenn jumps in his seat, causing his knees to bang against the table. A notebook and some pens to fall to the ground.
So it’s just Dean and Cas then... They stare at each other for a long, long time. Because that’s what they do.
Dean... you were supposed to live on. Fight Chuck, beat him, finally live for yourself. And you- you killed y-
No, but family members have their hunches and urban legends. There’s no way it’s some regular joe going around kidnapping these guys, not in this town.
I want you to promise to never go after Sam, Dean, or Jack again. Do not let Lucifer go after him. Protect him. and...
Sam takes a drink out of his whiskey glass, grimacing as it goes down. PAN UP to see Eileen leaning against a column, looking at Sam sorrowfully. She’s wearing some dorky pajamas.
I will say it’s interesting that they fear her more than you. I think I’ll have to applaud her before we slaughter her next time we meet.
The room is then plagued by an awkward silence. None of them really know how to act around each other, or what questions to ask. Small talk, or the big things? Dean himself is having an aneurysm trying to decide whether to apologize on behalf of Jack for him killing Mary, and looking at Cas he seems like he’s in the same situation. But whatever. They’re together, a perfect loving family.
“Death?” Dean asked, appalled. He'd sobered up a little but really wasn't in any state to be doing world-saving. Due to the alcohol. Only the alcohol. Dean took his time glaring at every one of them. “Death.”
Sam, Dean, and Castiel enter the motel room. Dean sheds some layers. (Go crazy, horn dogs!) Sam sets some stuff down on a table and opens up his laptop.
