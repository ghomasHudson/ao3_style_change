“This is the best idea you’ve ever had. They’ll look so cute,” Cas mumbled into Dean’s neck before he pressed a soft kiss into it. “Thank you.”
“Do you want to go to bed now?” Cas asked after a while.
“I would have, if it hadn’t been for Jack,” Cas explained.
As long as Cas was with him, he could deal with everything. Cas was his solid rock. Always there when everything became too much, when the world seemed to crash down around him. He made Dean feel like he was worth it.
But it had been truly worth it. In the end, they had too many to even count. There were the yellow bee ones; red ones with black dots that made them look like ladybugs; orange ones with brown tiger stripes, and green ones with white and yellow dots to make them look like they were a meadow sprinkled with daisies.
From the place where they were sitting, they could easily see the reception counter.
Other than Dean, Cas and his tax accountant costume - which he insisted was supposed to portray Constantine - fits right in with the crowd. He constantly smiled and was relaxed. Dean wasn’t relaxed at all.
Cas was the first to find his voice again.
“Don’t be such a grump,” Charlie slapped him on the arm. “I wanna spend some time with you. I haven’t seen you all week.”
“Good night, my love,” Cas replied sleepily and Dean felt him moving a little right before soft lips found his, pressing a gentle kiss onto them. They both fell asleep within minutes.
With that, she turned to Castiel – a devious smile on her face.
If he could have chuckled, the Mistletoe would have.
When Mick turned his gaze in the direction Castiel was looking, the Mistletoe saw his smile fall. Looking around himself, it wasn’t hard to understand what had caused the sudden change in his mood.
“Cas, please calm down. I’m not here to take your place or anything like this,” Jack tried to soothe him.
His smile widened. Of course, his bee-loving husband would paint yellow Easter eggs as bees. Chuckling about Cas’ dorky but adorable fondness for those little fluffy balls, he sat down on the opposite side of the table. “Well, in that case, I think we need more details.”
“Mick,” Dean almost hissed, “That slimy git.”
“So…” Dean cleared his throat. “Does that mean you don’t have to leave again? You can stay here… with me?”
Knowing how the new Heaven worked, Cas closed his eyes and tried to picture a place where they both would feel comfortable to meet.
Through the door they could all see a tall
The Easter Egg Hunt was a complete success. Since they had contributed a lot more eggs than the average, Dean and Cas had to start hiding them way earlier than the other donors. But it was worth it. Above all, the bee eggs – which they had hidden in the branches of flowering bushes – were a hit with the children. And the organizers had already persuaded Cas – much to Dean’s amusement at his husband’s expanse, who could never say no – to take part again next year.
“I am,” Jack agreed.
Step one he achieved only after a few weeks.
Charlie grinned at his unsure-sounding apology, shaking her head at him. “You got nothing to be sorry for, Cas; Wouldn’t exactly expect an angel to be the most skilled in the art of seduction – and Dean was as blind as a bat to miss all the obvious signal you were sending his way. But seems like he got there eventually, right?”

Dean was gonna throw up.
And then it’s Cas’s turn to make Dean freeze up in disbelief and stare at Cas wide-eyed, because he chuckles warmly at Dean’s statement and tells him, “I suppose that makes me stupid too, then.”
* * *
Castiel grunted, picking up his half-emptied beer bottle and taking a quick swig. “In my defense, your brother is much more well-mannered than Gabriel. How was I supposed to know it wasn’t you?”
He supposed the only saving grace was that maybe, just maybe, he’d get to see Cas again.

“Dean, you don’t have to-,”
And so now… now they’re left with this impossible-seeming task that they somehow have to do within a time limit of anywhere between a month to only

The blade slipped away from Cas’s neck, held loosely in Sam’s hand as he stared down at

“I think the answer to that question is fairly obvious,” Cas’s answer is scathing, dripping with levels of sarcasm that Dean didn’t think angels could even reach.
It feels like Castiels gaze is burning straight through Dean, peering right down into his soul, and Dean doesn't trust his voice to stay steady right now. Castiel is yet to move, staring at Dean patiently as the seconds tick by before finally, Dean gives a stiff nod of his head.
“Wait a minute,” Dean started, pulling out and instantly missing the warmth of Cas around him. Cas whined at the empty feeling, reflexively grabbing for Dean to try and pull him back. Dean pushed himself up, rocking back onto his knees and leaning on the back of his calves. He grabbed at Cas’s outstretched arms, pulling a confused Cas up until he too was sitting.
Castiel knew there was nothing he could say to help alleviate Dean’s guilt. This was just something he was going to have to feel. So, instead, he reached out across the table, pulling out one of Dean’s crossed arms from under him and intertwining his fingers with Deans. “We can’t change the past, Dean.”
“I was quite certain from our conversation on the phone that it was not possible,” Sergei replied with a shrug of his shoulders.
“I went to you,” Castiel maintained. “But you couldn’t see me. I kept myself hidden. I… I couldn’t bring myself to tear you away from your new life. For once, you looked at peace. You had, miraculously, found a way out of the Hunter’s life. And I couldn’t bear to be the one that brought you back in.”
“I’m dead, am I not?” Castiel answers his question with another question. “Where else would I go?”
Sam almost laughed. Almost. “I’m not too sure about that just yet.”
Castiel’s honesty caught Dean off guard. Dean’s eyes met Cas’s briefly, finding nothing but the honesty his voice had displayed. Dean’s eyes dropped back down to his glass, letting out a breathy sigh before taking another sip of whiskey.
"What are you getting at, Cas?"
Castiel didn’t have time to focus on that now. Dean was just about on the edge of life and death, holding on for longer than most would. If he didn’t hurry, there would be a reaper standing by his side in just a few seconds.
Seeing his older brother like this was heart-breaking.
Dean chuckles around the lip of the beer bottle. “Looked like an idiot talking to myself in Baby, I guess.”
Dean slowed his pace, placing his middle finger next to his index and pushing in, moving slowly against the resistance. He continued forcing his way in when Castiel didn’t complain, pushing forward until both were in all the way to the knuckles. “Fuck,” Castiel cursed sharply once Dean resumed his previous pace, his brain going into overdrive from the sensations of Dean’s rough, calloused mechanic hands rubbing up and down the sensitive skin of his dick, combined with the pleasant stretch of himself around Dean’s fingers. Yet, at the same time, his body wanted

“He took Jack’s place in the Empty. Except, the Empty decided it wanted to be a dick about it. It would only take Cas once he ‘experienced a moment of true happiness’, so…”
"And you know what? What if it is. What if this whole time, its been Chuck that's pushing us together?"
Castiel took a seat on the comfy, well-worn couch pressed against the wall, the still-wet blood covering his trench-coat immediately staining the couch.
“Because?” Sam encouraged Dean gently.
What he
In the back of his mind, he realizes he can’t feel his legs.
“Who doesn’t love a good surprise,” Dean shot back with a grin, throwing an arm around Jack's shoulder and directing the young God towards the door. “C'mon, take a look at the spot we picked out. We'll find the perfect spot for you to stand for Cas to get a clear view of you. Can't wait to see the look on his face…”
“Balit qaa ol om Enochian,” Ash replies simply with a knowing smile before his attention is diverted back to the computer in front of him. “Oh, and the stuff you were saying to Dean in that beach dream? Raunchy stuff, dude.”
“If I have this?” Castiel says, squeezing Dean’s hand. “I have

“This is…” She whispers to herself, eyes slowly widening as she realizes what she’s holding.

"Hell," Castiel answers for him, an unusually pale color appearing on the angels face. "This was Dean in hell."
grin, leaning back with a belly laugh so out of nowhere that it nearly had Sam reaching for his pistol.
Dean was content to stand here and drink him in forever. Claire’s and Cas’s pace down the aisle was leisurely, but a part of Dean wanted it to be slower – not because he wanted to prolong his bachelorhood, no, but because he wanted to take as much time to ingrain this moment into his memory. He wanted to be old and drooling in a care home, most of his memories gone but
“Hey, so long as you don’t write all of us into a life of pain for your entertainment? You’ll be doing better than the previous God,” Dean said, clapping the side of Jack's arm with a grin. “And… y'know, try not to destroy the world?”
“Good.” Dean grunted, reaching out to his bedside cabinet and pulling out his trusty tape player. “That means you’re not gonna be a creep and watch me sleep tonight, right?”
One week before the wedding, things were… calm. Like there wasn’t even going to
life, this life
He is not awake or aware, and it is but one last curse upon thousands that angels cannot dream.
No one has ever looked as out of place in Donnie’s as this man does now. He’s wearing a suit, with a blue tie and a crisp white button down that looks like it’s never seen a day of wear in its life. The only part of him that looks a bit lived in is the tan coat that hangs to about his knees. His shoes are the shiniest black that Donnie has ever seen outside of a church.
The sixth grade class eventually gathers up to leave but Dean slips away to stick around until close, indulging himself in the weightlessness that infinity presses upon him. When he finally thumbs his way home after dark, Dean tugs Sam out of bed and sets him up on the hood of the impala and introduces him to the stars. He grips Sam’s hand tight between them in a selfish hope that his wide-eyed little brother will admire that glittering velvet canvas but choose him and this smooth chrome-cold anchor and stay.
The shorter one is practically steaming when he bites:
But Donnie had never dreamt of being some big-time chef or anything like that, he just liked people. And a roadhouse in the middle of bumfuck nowhere Kansas was sure to host a lot of interesting people. And one of them was sitting right in front of him.
There’s a tear on Cas’ cheek but all Dean can think about is how gently he’s saying all of this. As if whatever fucked up
“I didn’t bring a car.”
Dean is starting to slip sideways and his other hand reaches clumsily to grab a chunk of tan fabric at waist height. Somehow, Cas doesn’t move or brace himself, despite the added weight as Dean rights himself.
Someone's touching him again, and all he wants to do is fall back into the warmth of oblivion, but there's a hand on his face now and it's incredibly disruptive. His facial muscles scrunch in displeasure, and it's the first he's moved in what feels like eons and his eyes flutter open, briefly, directly contrary to Castiel's will.
"It's a one time deal, lady." Dean grits his teeth right back, his trusty false bravado pushing him forward. "Either you take it, or I leave here the only one alive."
Dean straightens, gripping his knees with his hands. “Good.” He chews his lip for a moment before adding: “Me too.”
The coffee was good.
“Cas, I -” is all he manages to get out before his lips are quivering too hard to speak so he lets Cas guide his head down and tuck him against his crisp white collar. Dean’s own hands betray him and they wind themselves into the warm fabric of Castiel’s shirt as he lets go.
while Dean is trying his best to
is the infamous crack in his chassis, the slip of the pen in his blueprints, the price he pays for freedom, and the rope he chooses to hang himself with.
“Lots of thoughts tonight?” Dean can see the smile sparkling in his eyes.
A weight drops heavy into Dean’s stomach and he struggles against it.
Dean thinks he might throw up and he stops his hand just short of gripping her tunic in desperation.
Cas frowns and the book catches fire, turning to ash before Dean has time to swear. He shakes the gritty powder from his hand and grasps Dean’s other hand with his smudged palm. It’s surprisingly cool to the touch.
“Look, Dean,” there had been a constipated expression on Sam’s face that meant he was trying to avoid saying anything offensive, “
"Your husband," Dean snaps louder, hating that he has to say it again.
More squinting. Finally, Cas grates out:
Dean was in sixth grade when he went on his first and only school trip. Now so many years in the past; he doesn’t remember the specifics. It was some mid-western state, and John had found a real job; or at least he was gone for a regular 10 hours and stumbled through the door smelling more of sweat then of beer, with dirt caked under his fingernails instead of blood.  It was one of the longest times they stayed in one place as a family, together, and for the first time, Dean found himself taking a real interest in school. Not just the social aspects of finagling cliques and charming anyone and everyone who could give him an advantage; but the actual course work. The science unit this term was outer space. There was something so wonderful to consider that there was some place
Looking at Cas over the rim of his coffee mug? Even better.
Cas is leading him to the middle of the room and they can hear Billie through the door.
Dean took another sip.
"C'mon, man, you gotta wake up."
"You stayed," Chuck says the words like they aren't the salvation Dean had long given up praying for. He sounds disappointed, disgusted even, like he's fucking sick of the fact that Cas won't do what he's told. Like Cas is a some thrill-seeking toddler who won't stop sticking their fingers in the electrical outlet.
By a miracle most likely born of exhaustion and inattentiveness, John signed the permission slip for the local planetarium. Measly and unimpressive by today's standards, but Dean stared at the huge mural of the planet and imagined it getting smaller and smaller, the red YOU ARE HERE pin stuck in the belly-swoop of America becoming a pinprick. No responsibility, no father, no little brother, just limitless space and blazing balls of gas to light his way.
After a gruff thank you, Cas hustles Dean out the swinging doors and as Donnie turns the key in the lock 5 minutes later, he stares out at the empty parking lot and shakes his head.
“Yes.” Castiel’s answer is sure after a few beats of silence.
It’s only later, when his throat is wrecked from sobbing and bile and when a headache has lodged itself firmly behind his eyes and he’s declined enough calls from Sammy that he’s given up ringing, does Dean remember his plan.  His stomach lurches, and he heaves, dry and empty, hanging his head between his legs uselessly.
Billie slams on the door again, and Dean can see the sigil faltering over Cas’ shoulder.
A couple of years ago that thought would have had him bent over the  bowl of some gas station shitter heaving out his guts. But, here and now, Dean just cleaned the bunker’s washroom this morning and the toilet bowls are the kind of white that sparkles and Dean’s goddamn proud. And honestly, the nausea isn't that bad. It still catches him up every so often, but it turns out that years of swallowing shit down emotionally does have it’s uses. Sam’s been out of the bunker for nearly a month now, but it feels like longer. He’d started out taking longer hunts; driving halfway across the country to meet “a hunting buddy” (didn’t take Cas very long to point out this had probably been Eileen the entire time, but Dean was embarrassingly slow on the uptake). And then, once the hunt was done, for some godforsaken reason (that is all too clear in hindsight), taking the scenic route back towards Lebanon. He was probably trying to do some sort of immersion therapy or whatever; where you force the fucked up person to confront their fears for longer and longer periods of time until they get used to it or their reactions settle into something more stable. That’s humiliating in itself so Dean never asked, but that would be something Sammy and his goddamn hippie mental health bullshit would do.  So in a way, those absences are blurring into this one, and Dean sometimes finds himself sitting up in the middle of the night fighting his sleep-confused brain to figure out where Sam might be on the road toward home.
Cas hovers over a variety of answers he can give to that statement but finally settles on the most succinct.
“Get up for a sec.” he holds out his hand as if Cas needs help standing from the bed and Cas takes it.
Cas was alive,
Eternal Rest.
Cas assures him that they will be taking the impala back themselves.
Maybe there are some dreams worth waking up for.
It’s a good thing Donnie already has hands on both their collars because the look on Dean’s frozen face is indecipherable and he isn’t about to have to clean blood out of the cracked floorboards.
Dean thinks he feels the birth of something small and sparkling behind his sternum and he smiles.
Cas is searching for his wallet. Dean swings an arm up to land on Cas’s shoulder, landing closer to his friend’s neck than he probably intended.
“How did you know?” His voice is rough and dry.
As the only respectable watering hole in a 15-mile radius, Donnie’s bar was keeping pretty steady business. A pile of wood and cladding set up sometime in the early 20th century, which had spent some of its life as a bastardised postal office only to be returned to its gospel purpose under a more liberal government and had spent the better part of its later years booming. Well, booming was probably a bit of an exaggeration, what with the combined population of the two nearest settlements being below 500 persons. Esbon itself could never seem to break that 100 mark, hovering around 95-99 for the last handful of years.
There had been times in Dean’s life when he felt like that same vacuous void, whose mere existence could only destroy, wandering through the universe helplessly reducing stars to dust and emptiness. The very touch of him corrupts. But somewhere in the past, sometime after Jack arrived and Cas came back from the dead (again) Dean had forgotten what that felt like. Somehow it had disappeared, whisked away on the wind of Cas in a cowboy hat, and Sam singing along to the radio with Mary in the backseat, and quiet fishing trips with Jack. The feeling had tried to resurface when Jack died, but Cas was still there and Cas had
“Did you ever want to kill him?” Dean can almost feel the frown on his friend’s face as he decodes the question. He picks at a blister on his palm, waiting for the answer.
Now it's too late and the tears come silently, streaming hot and salty down his cheeks.
“So, you’ll come by tomorrow morning then? You’d better lock up whichever car you’re leaving behind.”
, is the only thing on Dean’s mind as soon as the adrenaline stops whiting out his thoughts. He barely registers Cas fumbling in his pockets but he definitely recognises the sigil he’s drawing on the door, dark red and dripping, when he turns around. Clearly, there would be no flying out of here. Dean’s not sure if that’s permanent or he needs some time to recharge his wings, but he shoves that to the back of his brain.
Cas says goodbye.
Dean’s managed to force upon him were anything more than death, humanity, hunger and frailty. But he lets Cas speak his mind, because some sad, aching, lonely part of him wants to hear Cas’ voice forever.
His heart is racing, every vein and artery crying what Dean can’t bring himself to say.
But there’s nothing there. Nothing to hold onto, nothing to grip with his hands or tear into with his teeth. Just a nauseating wave of dark and a gentle hand on his shoulder.
forgive him.
Dean Remington. Definitely had introduced himself as Todd the first time he walked in, but the next time he’d been Dean, and again, and again, and for the last three years Donnie had never called him on it. People are, and always will be, fucking weird.

with Cas. As if there was any
“Why does this sound like a goodbye?” He hopes Cas hears the challenge in this question, the underlying rage of
There is a pressure on his arm and blurs of colour, and voice in his ear saying:
With an annoyed sigh he gets up to take the proffered seat, sitting sideways so that their knees knock together. Really, it was Dean’s fault for miscalculating the distance needed between the couch and the chair, and Castiel makes sure to communicate that when Dean raises his eyebrows.  Dean shifts to sit with his knees wide, bracing his elbows on his thighs, cradling the steaming mug in his joined hands. Castiel takes a moment to mirror him, adjusting the trench coat out of his lap with a rustle of canvas.
He startles as a man pushes through the doors. After he hung up he must’ve fallen asleep on his feet because there is no way anyone could have gotten there so quickly.
This is it. This is all that’s left for them, he realises, with a moment of still clarity. And he’ll be damned if he lets Cas go without being heard. And if he’s the first to go, then, hell, he’ll go out listening.
and when was the last time a Winchester really died anyways?
Like a bad omen, Cas interrupts this train of thought, his voice as gravel-filled as Dean remembers.
Sam left because he wants that weightlessness, that infinity, that space to be and exist and explore; and on top of all that he has someone who wants to do it with him. Eileen is good for him that way. When they left the bunker for the last time she hooked her arm in his and Dean knew she will keep him from getting lost in all that vast darkness, from getting trapped in the orbit of some other strange planet, and she will do all this without dragging him back down through the atmosphere and burning them to death.
at Dean.  There’s a taste in the air Dean hates, and he thinks that’s the reason his throat is sticking. Cas keeps on talking and it barely registers over the buzzing in Dean’s ears and the pounding of his pulse. There’s something mesmerizing about watching your greatest fear unfold before, and Cas is doing it so sweetly that he can’t tear his eyes away. Something awful is happening and if they can make this into an argument, maybe Cas’ll stop being so… complacent, resigned. So goddamn
“Hey, buddy.” His voice is slurred from where he is awkwardly caught in Cas’s arms, but Donnie can see his soft expression.
for a second Dean could come up with a plan--
Dean’s soul is iridescent with brightness but he keeps his grumpy façade in the frown between his brows. With a great show of effort, he uncurls his left hand from the heat of the mug and gestures for Castiel to come closer. At his hesitation, the hunter rolls his eyes and stretches out - joints popping loudly - to hook his foot around the leg of the nearest chair. The cacophony of noise splits the air as the chair reluctantly grates against the rough grain of the floorboards and Dean surprisingly has the wherewithal to look apologetic. He’s dragged it out in front of the couch, and adds a gruff “Sit.” to the sudden silence.
All these years of unspoken words between them and this quiet sunrise could change everything. If Dean ever had any balls at all this could be
“Yes. That is my name.” The stranger says in all seriousness.
They're outside, and it's overcast. The moonlight is barely filtering through a thinner layer of clouds. Dean's flicked on a flashlight, the beam bouncing along the ground in an effort to keep them all from tripping, and even though Cas can't make out his face behind the brightness of the LED blub, he knows he's smiling.
There’s a knock at the door and Dean grunts in acknowledgement as Cas slips in. Dean resolutely keeps his head down, unwilling to answer the question waiting in the angel’s eyes. If he wasn’t so exhausted he’d give Cas a gruff “I’m fine”, but instead when he opens his mouth all that comes out is:
, like he doesn’t have to worry about how they’re getting out of here.
"There you are."
It makes sense that she's his wife.
He doesn’t want to move but he nudges his friend as he stands.
Cas reaches up and pats Dean’s hand against his face, eyes crinkling with a tight smile. “I love you too, Dean.” He gently tugs Dean’s hand away with his own.
"My what?" Her voice is filled with incredulous laughter.

Dean wants to say “That wasn’t you” or “You’re not the same”. Instead what comes out is:
She doesn't look anything like Dean expected. She's beautiful, he guesses, but in the way in which the clear brook in an autumn forest is beautiful - a type of other-worldly splendor that's he's only glimpsed once before.
There's blessed quiet. Then-
Cas himself was real- with all his earnest smiles, terrible taste in cars and and inability to take a goddamn compliment. With all his pride and self-loathing and downright annoying hero complex. With all his shitty emoji texts that Dean complained about incessantly. With his unfathomable knowledge of the universe that he carries and that never shakes off when his shoulder bumps Dean's in the supermarket juice aisle.
He can't meet her eyes. "Your husband," he mutters. His throat clicks and he fights the urge to clear it.
That voice is warm too, but Castiel hates it. Fatigue claws at his limbs desperate to pull him back under.
He accepts the only birthright his celestial nature can afford him.
He squints at Donnie, drool shining in his stubble, tongue thick as he tries to say something. Donnie has no capacity left for bullshit and at this point he’s so dead on his feet he might as well get murdered.
"I've come to offer my life as payment for those I've taken."

Not letting go, Dean moves to pull the book from it’s hiding spot and hands it over wordlessly. He doesn’t need to read over Castiel’s shoulder to know what it says.
He briefly considers calling Dean a coward - what, he thinks he can just get off the hook with a smart quip and a devastating smile? - but he's
"A death wish?" She sits back into the shadows. "Astonishing." Her flat delivery chips something away in Dean's chest and his throat tightens. He keeps silent in response.

Cas takes back his card and Dean’s hand is now curled softly against the side of his face. Donnie can only see Dean’s profile, but he watches as Dean opens his mouth and he swears the world slows down.
Well, Dean gets the feeling that this might just be the best day of his entire god-forsaken life.]
He flexes his fists and feels the dried blood pull at his skin and crack. There's some on his collar too, turning the edges of his flannel brown and stiffening the neck of his tee where it scrapes against his collarbone.
Dean is already reaching back for the bottle the previous four fingers having miraculously evaporated. His face is stony.
Cas is smiling even as he rolls his eyes. Dean hunches awkwardly to busy his mouth with another sip of (truly awful) coffee to avoid beaming back and giving wings to the butterflies in his stomach. It too early in the morning for this fucking nonsense, but here was his best friend back from

moment,
"Please." He pushes the word past trembling lips; he was so close.
Two words mean absolutely nothing to Chuck now- he's just another 10-cent writer with a publisher deadline, and he's desperate to get to the end. Maybe he does know- and this revelation is just another ploy to throw Dean off his game. He's ashamed to say that it works.
“Do you want a hand?” Donnie gestures to the snoring drunk and figures he might as well help haul his friend into Cas’s vehicle. The man seems confused narrowing his eyes.
“No, Cas, no, I love you.”
for any of them. This was it, the End of Days, and they’ll all die either fighting or failing.
“Then how did you get here?” Did this motherfucker walk the 10 miles to Esbon? Surely he hadn’t waited for hours for Cas to arrive.
"Mm, maybe later."
If there's a second state that is inherently linked to the nature of humanity, it's frustration.
"I cannot bring him back," Dean ignores the naked pity in her eyes, "but we have been," she searches for a word, "whole, so I can give you the most faithful approximation to himself."
"For him," she repeats the same word again, "so that he may be loved even in memory." She reaches a hand toward his upturned face as if in blessing, and Dean slips away into her daydream.
Romeo & Juliet Act 3 Scene 2
Donnie signs his own death warrant and asks again, a little bit louder.
Donnie briefly debates letting the bastard sulk alone but after the recent ruckus the bar has all but cleared out. Sally and Doug were probably fine for the rest of the evening and Charisse had no problem barging into personal conversations to demand another cosmo.
Castiel takes a moment to reminisce back on a time where these sorts of orders were reversed.
And anyway, no one had ever come back this way, not by themselves, not from
If there's one state that is inherently linked to the nature of humanity, it's exhaustion.
But Dean knows where Sam is now; or at least he knows who Sam is with - Eileen. They’re doing some sort of nomad hunting trip across America and beyond, only staying in one town long enough to gut a monster and send photos to the family group chat of whatever funky airbnb they’ve rented for the night. Dean’s surprised he’s taken so well to this “on the road again” type of lifestyle but as it turns out, they are very different people.
“You don’t fucking say.”
was what Cas wanted, the fragile, fucked up human that an angel couldn’t leave behind. He hated himself for that hope, but in the stillness of this moment he let himself revel in it.
. He feels like he’s burning and frozen at the same time.
The floorboards creak and the mattress dips unexpectedly as Cas takes the empty space beside him, knees wide and hands clasped between them. Dean was pretty sure he had meant for Castiel to sit in the sturdy armchair by the door, but as the heat from Cas’s body seeps into his left side, Dean finds himself unable to protest. He lifts his head from his hands to mirror Cas’s position, pressing their knees together as he shifts. They don’t look at each other - both focus somewhere in the middle distance and Dean is eternally grateful. Dean knows he should convince the angel that everything Michael said was false and that nothing about their friendship was born of compulsion. Billie’s visit weighs on him, and bits of stardust slowly wink out of existence. Instead of reassurance, Dean asks a question.
“You never know,” Sam tried to stay optimistic for the sake of his brother. “There’s always a chance, right? Maybe we can find something to help fix your legs in our research, too.”

and the fact that it’s for
“Whichever Reaper dies after Death is killed becomes the new Death…” Dean fills in the gap.
Castiel narrowed his eyes at John, wishing there was still enough grace left inside him to track John’s pulse and see if he was lying or not. “Good…” Castiel finally breaks the silence the three were in. “Because I intend to be by Dean’s side every second he’s here to make sure you do, indeed,
They were sitting at the fireplace nearest the Mistletoe now and Castiel seemed to be on edge. He was reading a book but every other minute, he looked up to check the time on the old grandfather-clock near the entrance to the main hall.
Dean’s eyes went wide and Charlie could hardly keep up with him as he took quick steps back to the wellness area. There was a devious smile on her face and a gleam in her eyes.
“No,” Meg wailed, “we already did that last week.”
Dean rummaged through the box containing all sorts of arts and crafts materials that Cas had put on the dining table. He was searching for something that…
“Jack, what are you doing here? Why am I awake? I am awake, aren’t I?” Cas asked confused, still trying to process what was happening.
“Hello Dean,” he said hesitantly.
But before panic could settle in, Dean felt Cas leaning into him. His heart took an excited jump when Cas’ arms wound around him and he finally returned the kiss.
They had spent a lot of time together, enjoying the day’s events and drinking at the bar until late into the night.
It gave Dean the courage to lean in further, barely leaving any space between them. After a heartbeat, Cas closed the last gap and finally, after all these years, their lips met for the first time.
, he thought triumphantly when he pulled a roll of shimmering blue ribbon from the box. It was slim and so fine it was almost translucent.
The older folks – five of the group – didn’t arouse much interest. They spent their days with walks around the resort, card games, and reading at the fireplaces. But the younger ones were a social potpourri.
“Let me see.”
“Uncle Dean, can you please go outside with us to play? Daddy says he and Mommy don’t have time but all the other kids are already outside and there is so much fresh snow-”
Barely three hours later, a fuming Dean – clothed in just a bathrobe – stormed into the main hall and headed straight to the bar. He talked to the bartender and a few moments later, there was a tumbler of whiskey placed in front of Dean.
“That is totally different. Sledding is much more fun,” Meg insisted.
“Yeah, and what are you doing here? Like…
That night the heavens opened and the already snow-laden landscape was covered in a white blanket of even more powdery snow. The Mistletoe had heard the staff of the morning shift talk about the fact that the streets were almost impossible to get through.
It was supposed to be a quiet day, filled with lazily floating in the pool, relaxing in the brine bath, and maybe a massage. In short: completely boring for the mistletoe, who wouldn’t be able to witness anything that might happen between these two lovesick idiots.
When Cas’ eyes softened and didn’t make a move to step back from Dean’s obvious advances, it was all the confirmation Dean needed. He raised his hand to put it on Cas' neck at the same time as he leaned further toward him to finally lay his lips on Cas’.
“Are you waiting for something?” Mick asked, an amused smile on his face.
He straightened up and asked with a tense smile, “Who is Mick?” The curiosity in his voice was almost palpable.
“Sweetie, I told you we can go outside after lunch. Mommy and I have something to do first and they haven't even had enough time to clear all the paths yet,” Sam answered, the annoyance in his voice noticeable, even for the Mistletoe.
else.
Charlie nodded.
“Great. Get ready to go. We will meet at the front door in ten minutes. While Cas and I work, you both can build a snowman for me since I didn’t see the one you built last week. Okay?”
"You can’t expect that no one else would try to make a move on Cas. Even I have to admit that he’s insanely hot. Not to forget that he’s also kindhearted and fascinating and surprisingly very much…
“Don’t exaggerate. It’s just Easter eggs,” Dean laughed and gently broke away from Cas to look him in the eye. “You’re welcome.”
“Let’s go back in, it’s getting cold.”
“Jack?” Cas asked incredulously.
“Okay, I will just wait here then,” Cas said with a soft smile.
yourself – I died a little, too. I drank and I raged out on everyone. After the last time, I told Sam that we have to move on – live our lives – to honor you. And I tried. I really did. But to be honest, when that vampire pinned me on that thing, I was relieved. It was finally over. I didn’t have to pretend anymore.”
Cas smiled at him. “It’s no problem, Dean. I know you don’t like crowds like this.”
“Yeah, you’ve mentioned it now and again,” Dean finally replied in an amused voice, but his eyes betrayed him.
“YES,” both kids exclaimed.
“Here you go, dig in.”
“Let’s get you a real drink.”
The children of Eileen and Sam Winchester – or
, aren’t you? You’re not something that this place cooked up for me, right?”
At first, he had feared he might lose Cas if he didn’t return his feelings - but Cas had proven over and over again that he would always be there if Dean needed him.
Suddenly, Cas could see the darkness around him thinning until two figures nearby became visible.
His lips were as soft as Dean had always imagined. They moved smoothly against his and their noses brushed when Dean tilted his head to get a better angle. Even though Dean’s heart was racing, the kiss wasn’t heated or passionate; rather slow and gentle.
They both stopped talking and grinned at each other. When Dean leaned in slightly, the Mistletoe got excited.
“I wanted them to look like bees,” he stated matter-of-factly and just then, Dean noticed that Cas had in fact only colored the yellow-coloured eggs with the stripes.
“Okay, let’s do this,” Castiel agreed. He looked at Dean with a fond smile.
Suddenly Dean's decision was made. He couldn’t go on with the uncertainty. He had to know if he had a chance.
Everytime their lips parted and met again, Dean could taste in Cas’ breath the sweetness of the cocktail he had taken from him earlier. But other than before, the flavor wasn’t unpleasant; mingled with Cas’ very own taste it was downright addictive.
Dean continued his game with the twins and after a few sips of his coffee, Castiel was awake enough to participate in normal conversation.
the Mistletoe pouted as he watched after their retreading backs.
?” Dean's voice sounded friendly but the Mistletoe sensed the subliminal frustration in it.
the Mistletoe thought gleefully.
Cas always seemed to know what Dean was thinking and he always knew what Dean needed. Everything was better when Cas was with him. Together they made their way to the kitchen counter where the makeshift bar was located and Cas poured Dean a whiskey. Dean would have been absolutely content with spending the rest of the night with Cas at the bar - with whiskey constantly flowing - but they soon had to go elsewhere,the constant stream of other guests coming in for a refill soon getting too much.
Dean turned around and walked through the door, leaving Cas behind.
“For helping me. It was my idea to donate eggs for the Easter hunt and you spent your whole day with it,” Cas explained, sounding as tired as Dean felt.
That was, until Mick apparently decided not to give up on Castiel just yet.
Dean swallowed visibly – well, not for Castiel who was already focused on his coffee.
Charlie smiled brightly. “Oh, nothing really. Just slept in and relaxed. They have a really nice wellness area here. You should try.”
On their way out to the Impala they simply waved goodbye at Charlie, who was standing on the opposite side of the room with a huge smile on her face.
“He is alone here and knows no one. He just wants some company and yes, he
Where they stood now, the music was really loud. They could barely hear themselves. Dean tried to read the words from Cas’ lips but he was too distracted from his thoughts of how soft they would probably feel on his. He really wanted to kiss them.
Dean was already falling asleep, his eyelids drooping, when Cas mumbled those words into his chest.
“I got you, buddy.”
“How are you here?” he asked. “You are
“No!” Cas exclaimed, startling Jack. “No, you can’t do this. You can’t make a deal to get me out of here,” Cas’ voice almost cracked. “You’ve seen what all those deals brought us. Only pain and sorrow. I don’t regret making that deal for you but it would’ve been in vain if you sacrifice yourself for me now.”
“Yeah, let’s go.” Dean grabbed his flanel from the counter and took Cas’ hand.
“I’m sorry for being grumpy earlier. I promise I’ll try to be more sociable.”
Dean and Castiel shoveled snow – the latter admittedly with significantly less eagerness – while the children built a snowman as promised.
to know that I…“ he struggled to find the right words; to get them out. “Ever since I’ve known you… Every time you died –
“We only went sledding on Saturday and you still want to go back now,” Castiel pointed out.
Instead of actually smiting him, Castiel just strolled casually over to the kids who were still throwing snowballs at each other. He dropped his shovel, bent down and grabbed two handfuls of snow. While he formed the snow into a ball, Castiel talked to the kids and glanced over his shoulder toward Dean – a devious gleam in his eyes.
“Because… first, Cas and I have to shovel the way to the storage room free,” Dean explained with a mischievous glance in Castiel’s direction.
“You are,” Jimmy confirms.
“But what if it was your brother?” Castiel challenged, gathering enough courage to look up at Dean from his bottle. “If it had been Sam your father was throwing out? Would you have said nothing? Sat back and watched it happen?”
“Any chance we can track down the witch?” Eileen asks. “Maybe she’d be willing to help?”
“Apologies. Please continue with your story about how we become a couple that argues all the time.”
He doesn’t know

"Then I could have pretended it wasn't true, and leave this
"Um...." Sam began awkwardly, looking to Castiel for help. "Not exactly..."
“I’ll be careful,” Dean assured him, placing the condoms on the front seat but keeping the bottle of lube in hand. Dean squeezed a generous dollop into his hand, grateful that the warm night had saved the nightmarish experience that was cold lube. He guessed California’s uncomfortable weather
“Now what we have here… is a rare occasion. The second I’ve seen. Most of humanity believes angels to be God’s messengers… there to pass on the good Lord’s words to those that are meant to hear it. Some believe them to be God’s minions, there to dish out miracles when God is… unavailable. Neither of these are true. Angels are
Sam’s shaking breaths may have given away his nerves, but his hands were as steady as a rock as they took the vial of blood that Eileen handed to him. The dark liquid dances around the glass vial, staining its sides with streaks of bright red as Sam carefully removes its lid.
help. Nothing is stopping him from telling Cas to ‘stop treating him like a kid’, to rush in there and let more Vamp heads roll. Instead, Dean finds his feet frozen in place, watching with mouth agape as Castiel works.
Sam glowers at the Russian, but lowers his gun down none the less – though keeps a firm hand wrapped around the handle. “You’ll have to forgive me. Last we met, you nearly killed me for your own gain.”
Jack was right. How had he not noticed? Had he been
"Have
would I go about explaining any of this to a shrink, huh?
“Seriously?” Dean sat back down on his stool, leaning back against the wall behind him. “I’ve seen you drinking before though? Why’d you bother if you can’t taste it?”
Because he doesn’t know if this is the last night they’ll ever get together. He doesn’t know if this is the end. If the world was ending.
He can’t
“Yeah, man. I’m his big brother, it’s my job to tell.”
Eileen’s gentle touch on his shoulder pulled his gaze away from Dean. He turned on the uncomfortable plastic chair to face her, giving her an appreciative smile as she handed him yet another cup of coffee.
"I'm inclined to believe it was the latter."
“No.”

And he had no idea what he’d done to warrant such a reaction.
A thought crossed Dean’s mind, though it’s one that he had frequently thought of recently. He had been about to take another sip, the glass of whiskey raised to his lips as the thought passed over his mind. He placed the whiskey back down as he asked Castiel what was on his mind. “How are you okay with all this, Cas? I mean me, I… I’ll admit, I haven’t always treated the kid right. Even knowing what he did to… to mom, everything else, even what
I couldn't help but ask for you to say it all again,

And he was gonna try. No matter how much Cas's loss left a hole in his life. He was gonna carry on. He was gonna pull himself out of bed, he was gonna greet Miracle every morning with the cuddles she deserves (along with leftover scraps that Sam didn't approve of but couldn’t seem to find within himself to scold Dean for), he was gonna get himself a job, a

It was Cas’s pleading tone in his head, the pain he heard in that usually strong and resolved voice, a pain he knew Cas was feeling because of
Oh, Cas. Oh, Cas, Cas, Cas. He had listened to what he had said, but he hadn’t really

“Woah, Woah, wait – Sammy!”
Things are different now. It feels like there’s no time for anger. Especially not towards Cas, and especially not
in his face that’s both awe-inspiring and terrifying, and Dean can only be thankful it isn’t aimed at him. Cas pulls himself off the rebar like it’s no trouble, like the blood soaking through his pristine button-up shirt doesn’t matter. Dean knows he should be focusing on the Vamps breathing down his neck, but he

“I thought the direct approach would be better this time. You know, with me dying and all.”
Dean nearly snorted into his drink. “Yeah, you can say that again.”
Dean blocks off what’s likely to be a multitude of questions from Cas on his little musical secret, coming to a stop in front of Castiel’s room. If it can even be called that… it was a rarity for Castiel to use the room. Which, to be fair, is understandable when Dean considers the fact that Cas is an angel and, as such, does not require sleep. Still… it always hurt to walk past the room when the door was left open, seeing the bed bare and the room empty of any…

They had been dropped right in the middle of a fairly ordinary-looking suburban neighborhood. A beautiful day as far as the weather, deep blue sky with perfectly fluffy white clouds floating lazily past up ahead, no sign in the least of any rain to come.

“Eh, I guess so. We’ve always been busy with
“No. It sure as hell ain't.” Dean said, finger tapping anxiously at the side of his cup. “I’m fresh out of ideas, and Cas…”
The silence Dean got from his head was enough for the light-hearted smile on his face to slip away.
"You can do that?"
Castiel was
He’s shaking again. Or had he never stopped? He’s not too sure. It’s making it hard to talk.
too tiny. His face scrunched up in discomfort, pinching at the bridge of his nose in the hopes that it may alleviate the headache he could feel settling in right at the front of his brain. Usually, he would at the very least of popped open the lid to a cold beer and have that resting on the table to help dull some of the boredom and pain research tended to bring.
Claire was so frozen in place that Kaia, who had been following just behind, nearly ran into the back of her. Kaia’s eyes widened upon seeing them, partly hidden by Claire with a hand hanging onto Claire’s sleeve as what could ever be a comforting gesture for Claire, or an attempt to ground herself.
Before Cas can respond, Dean reaches out his hand to grab Cas's empty one, nodding at the file in Cas's hand, gesturing for him to place it down on the table.
“What I said I would do,” Rowena answers, sauntering over the armchair Claire was occupying not long ago and dropping into it like it was her own home. “Imagine my surprise when my demons pick up on an angel's grace on Earth that’s not occupying a vessel. I sent some of my men to investigate and… what do you know, they report back to me that the Winchester’s are involved. I could only assume this is a part of your little plan to save the angel?”
to. Sam was right, there was always another way. They’d find another way. It didn’t matter he knew full well they had a minute at most before that door came down. It didn’t matter that he knew, deep down, that Cas’ plan was the only one they got.
“I know. I know that, Sammy. I’m not denying he’s gone, I just… I miss him. Guess I always assumed we’d win this thing together, you know? ‘Paradise on Earth’ and all that.”
Cas rolled his eyes at him, snapping his fingers once more. The blood vanished from the surface of the couch, along with his trench-coat returning to its usual clean state of being.
Sam pressed the angel that was possessing his brother into the bed with one hand on its shoulder, holding the angel blade against its neck. The thing using Dean’s eyes glances down anxiously to the blade, the angel’s hand on his arm insistently pushing him away. Eileen stood nearby, checking the door to make sure no one would come into the room.
It wasn’t fair.
“Another guilty pleasure,” Dean said with a sly smirk. “Dad was always embarrassed to admit he liked these kinds of tracks, too. Guess that passed on to me.”
“And I wrote my number on the trees –
Dean’s not much one for interior decorating, but he had to admit, this place was certainly something to behold. At least, it was something to look at while they waited in this agonizingly long line. “I swear Sammy, this coffee better not be more than five bucks…”
It was… it was
“How long is long?”
That hurt a lot more.

Kelly smiled sweetly at the two’s reunion, looking over to Jack as she asks, “It’s time, huh?”
“No, it was not,” Castiel agrees. “I was not jealous of you… I was jealous of Lisa. It’s wasn’t your place I wanted to take… it was
“I’m telling you, it’s true!” Dean shot back; his voice laced with his own laughter in response to Castiel’s disbelieving chuckles at his story. “I was nineteen, on my first leave! I was only looking for a quick fling, something simple and… vanilla. But then I met Rhonda Hurley…”
Miracle had already made herself comfy on Dean’s bed, looking up at the two with half-moon eyes, tail thumping lightly against the bedsheets. Sam gave her a good ruffle on the head, sighing to himself as he glanced around the room.
a family. That I was part of your family. And now, these past few weeks… you’ve given me more to smile about, Dean.”
Dean’s finger stilled at the file he had reached, feeling a kick of hope burst in his chest at the title: ‘Angel Exorcism – Exorcising An Angel Whilst Leaving The Vessel Intact.’
Watch me mess up again and have to include a part three lmao
love with Cas may always be a huge ordeal in his mind. But deep down, he knows it’s all the little things that make up their love.
That was basically their catchphrase by now, wasn’t it? Keeping secrets from each other seems the norm. But it’s not like he didn’t
was trying to kill you?”
Dean cursed sharply, the single word echoing between the cars parked around them. He brought his fist down into the ground in his frustration, feeling the familiar sting of his knuckles splitting as they hit the hard ground of the parking lot. Sam knelt down by his side, one hand on the tipped over wheelchair and the other wrapped securely under Dean’s arm, ready to help him to his feet.
The doctor cracked a warm smile at his words. It must be nice to be the one to sit down with a family member and give them
Sam continues, eyes fixated on the swirling glow of the grace in the vial Eileen held. With the slightest of nods from him, Eileen is uncapping the vial, directing the seemingly alive Grace towards the bowl.
And as those words lingered in the air between them, Dean let the thoughts in his mind run free, knowing he’ll never have the balls to speak them out loud:
. When he was trying to contact you, he was back on Earth, right? Cas is… he’s in the Empty. The only being with enough power to get him out was Jack, but-,”
“You should have told us earlier,” Dean broke their embrace, squeezing Cas’s arm more in frustration now. “We could have figured something out, Cas. Got you out of that deal somehow…”
"Oh..."
Jack. But that doesn't mean it was
With the click of his fingers and a grin on his face like he was the cat that got the cream, Castiel was stripped of his usual wardrobe. His trench coat, suit, and formal black shoes were long gone; replaced by an obnoxiously hot-pink Hawaiian shirt in the same style of Dean’s, along with a similar style of swimming trunks- although his pair were colored a deep and familiar blue which matched the steely eyes that were sending daggers Dean’s way.
hidden in all these files, otherwise I… I don’t know what to do…”
Heaven wasn’t heaven because it was
Dean grinned at the scowl Cas sent in his head.
"Twelve years, man." Dean whispers to him.
“He didn’t want to. He didn’t want this any more than me. But we both agreed that life should return back to the natural order of things. No more second chances, no more crossroad deals… The reapers are already having a tough time trying to readjust to all the changes that have happened recently, especially with how many The Empty disposed of when she was trying to get Billie’s attention… This way, Jack hopes that the Earth will become… more peaceful. Thankfully, Rowena has agreed to the terms in Hell. Crossroad deals are no more. The only souls headed to Hell are those that have been rightfully damned. And those that have lived a good life… they come up here.
wrong. The rebar… it was like he could still feel it impaled through his chest, could still hear his gurgles, choking on his blood.
Dean hummed thoughtfully, swallowing down a mouthful of beer. “Yeah? Tell that to the dumbass newbie at work who decided he didn’t need to put the oil cap back on after changing the oil… oil
Castiel paused at the old wooden doors, taking a deep breath to ready himself before pushing on the doors as hard as he can, raising the machete in preparation as the doors creak and groan at him. He takes a few steps into the barn, barely registering the glass crunching under his feet, ready to face an onslaught of prepared Vampire’s that were most likely waiting for the other Winchester brother to show up when…
“We had asked Rowena if there was something she could do to bring her back, remember?”
Sam nodded, keeping his eyes focused on where the chair was going. “Yep, Just take it slow, alright?”

“Dean, it’s okay-,”

Cars passed by him on the road, a blur of taillights and obnoxiously bright LED’s. So many strangers whose only experience of him is a brief image of a soaked man walking in the rain, never to know of the stories he held, of the lengths he went to ensure they get to experience their lives without the pain he holds.

“Dean… you know we wouldn’t be doing this usually, but… with the hunt so local and so many people already dead…”
For the people taking a trip to the coffee shop who are kind enough to ask someone if they want something while they’re there, and they respond with ‘I don’t care.’”
Pure. Black. Coffee.

Sam was partly right about the ‘stumbling home in the dark’ thing. Okay, he was

There’s going to be times where Dean doesn’t want to look in our direction, times when he lashes out, and we’ll handle all that, okay?”

“Says the guy who’s going to a park for their first date.”
respond. Not for a while, anyway. Nothing but silence – in the form of crackling white noise – emitted from Dean’s speaker, stretching on long enough that he had to take his phone away from his ear and check the screen to see if the phone was still connected.
“You can’t do this, can you?” Rowena’s eyes flicker over to Dean at his crushed words. Considering Rowena had attempted to kill both him
wants to see. Had he seen Cas cry before? He isn’t sure. Not even when Jack died, he thinks. Perhaps because Cas refused to believe it. Perhaps because, deep down, Cas knew Jack would be back. He had smiled, then.
It didn’t matter what Cas said – he
“I’m going to touch your upper body now, okay Mr. Winchester? We just need to get an idea of where the paralysis starts.”
"Cas..."

Dean slowly uncurled his fingers out from his clenched fist, closing his eyes and letting out a deep sigh. Sam had remained silent- perhaps sensing that Cas was talking to him – his grip around Dean’s arm loose but still there, still ready.
“The book…” Sam mutters at the realization. “We still have Chuck’s book! I mean – Billy read it again, didn’t she? After the plan changed, once Jack came back? Maybe this is part of the book, a new plan to end Chuck!”
“Yeah… just got to find a way to recreate a body that belongs to an angel which was destroyed by a being older than God himself. Sounds easy…”
“What about your parents?”
And heaven knows no one wants it to
“Now? Now, I’d check them out of that hospital, buy them a cold beer and thank them for planting the idea in my head. Coz all them years ago… it seemed crazy even then to know an angel, let alone realize I was starting to care for him. Then, eventually… I would fall in love with him.”
Dean nearly spat out his mouthful of coffee, frantically shoving his flannel sleeve back to check the time on his watch. Yep, just as Sam had said, his watch blinked back the numbers ’12:23’ at him in bright white lettering. “Huh… would you look at that…”
Castiel shakes his head in disgust at John, who looks torn between keeping up his mask of rage or cowering away from the centuries-old being so fervently defending his own son. “For all of that? You deserve much worse than a single punch, John Winchester.”
“Hi, uh…” Sam raises his other hand to rub across his forehead, choosing his words carefully. It wasn’t too difficult to amplify the tremble that was already in his voice. “I, um… I was walking my dog through a farmer’s field and I heard screaming coming from this barn. My dog pulled me towards it and… there’s a bunch of bodies here.”

The interior décor of the room matched the signs outside. The walls were painted with a pale blue color that was easy on the eyes and, most impressively, the clouds also appeared to be hand-painted just as they were on the sign was outside. These clouds weren’t just a plain white but were colored with soft shades of oranges and reds and yellows, giving the appearance of the sun glinting off each and every one. And the blast of air conditioning that greeted them upon entering was enough to earn the shop the title of ‘
“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Dean cuts Castiel off with a roll of his eyes. “Coz he’s
“As I said before - I’m not too sure on what happens. Either I’ll simply burn away, or… I am forced to take control of you. Which is why there’s something I need to ask of you, Dean.”
* * *
Castiel goes quiet at that, the tenseness of his body under Dean’s hand only going to prove his previous statement right. And yet, he still asks Cas, “Am I right?”
His body has just… shut off. No more emotions. No more
“And Gabriel. And Michael. And Raphael. And every other angel,” Castiel added.
“Apparently…” Sam sighed, glancing around the bunker’s interior, a concerned frown etched on his features. “Huh, usually she’s-,”
“Cas… What are you doing?”
Dean gladly followed his command, pulling his finger back until just the tip was left, then pushing back in. He quickened his pace once he felt Castiel begin to relax, matching the speed of his hand with the other that was still stroking Cas.
an angel, four observers spanning across two centuries watching as an experiment fails quite spectacularly.
Sam’s phone buzzes from within his jean pocket. Two short vibrations – a text message, not a call. Sam sighs quietly to himself, not ready to face anyone just yet. Still, he digs in his pocket for his phone, pulling it out from its confines and swiping his thumb across the screen, waiting for it to light up.
“Show off…” Dean muttered, swinging his legs back onto the hammock and stretching out before relaxing back into the soft material. “Wait – do you seriously never sweat?”
Dean and Cas fell silent for a few moments, content to sit in each other’s company and gaze upon the stars overhead. Dean couldn’t help but think back to that night – or at least, the fake one in his dream - where they were sat like this on top of Baby. That night had been the beginning of their relationship, but this night? This night was the beginning of the rest of their lives.
. Right here in front of him, alive and warm under his hands. His future was back, looking right at him, and for once in his damned life it felt like everything was going to be
dumb.
“Having an angel riding shotgun does that to you.”
to get Sam and Eileen back to safety, that he didn’t even notice the familiar barn that the Impala rumbled up to in the middle of nowhere. Desolate in location, its aged wooden exterior looking about ready to fall apart at even the gentlest blow of the wind. This was a barn that Castiel absolutely

“Guess we both got too much respect for our dads, huh?” Dean tried to joke, but it fell flat. “You gotta admit that God was more of a disappointment than my dad though, right?”
printed out in sleek black ink, along with a phone number.
Castiel knew there was nothing he could say to help alleviate Dean’s guilt. This was just something he was going to have to feel. So, instead, he reached out across the table, pulling out one of Dean’s crossed arms from under him and intertwining his fingers with Deans. “We can’t change the past, Dean.”
His injured hand is cradled in his other, resting on his lap. He stares blankly down at it, smearing the slowing flow of blood across his pale skin. He was almost expecting to find Castiel by his side, gesturing for his injured hand.

Universe – and all the other Universe’s to ever have been created.”
“Rowena. As Samuel over there just stated.”
The hinges to Baby’s doors creak as they’re pushed open, followed by the dull thud of it being closed much softer (and with more respect, if Dean’s being honest with himself) than he had. Dean hears the soft, padded footsteps of shoes against the asphalt, then the feeling of the hood dipping as an extra weight is added. He can feel the warmth of Cas’s body bleeding into the cold air next to him, only mere inches away. Of course he would… That was his thing. Plenty of space to stand or sit, and Cas always chose to get as close to Dean as humanly possible.
"Our way is a peaceful way," she sits back up, the impassive mask suddenly falling away, "but many would argue you do not deserve peace." Her bared teeth glow threateningly in the eerie light.
Affection consumes him so suddenly he feels uncontrollably giddy with it and in a moment free of self-doubt he fits his mouth against Cas’s, if only to forestall anything more embarrassing like a hysterical laugh or a sob. When Cas kisses him back there are tears on his face despite his best efforts, and when they pull apart mere seconds later it's definitely not because Dean can’t stop his lips from trembling.
