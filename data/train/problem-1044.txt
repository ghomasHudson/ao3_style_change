"Great. I shall see you after third, and you at practice." John said nodding to the two as he was being lead away towards their class.
"Come on Sherlock, we have potions." Molly said, pulling Sherlock by his robes.
"GUYS, I'M LEAVING! SOMETHING HAS COME UP." John shouted up at the crowd still floating about the pitch on their brooms looking shocked as John left with Sherlock grabbing his hand and pulling him from the stands now. John groaned in frustration, knowing full well that to shut Sherlock up he was going to have to allowed himself to be pulled along.
Sherlock knowing that he was being ignored huffed again and left Molly to her studies. Molly sighed as she heard a pile of books slam to the floor and Sherlock yelling at someone to move out of his way . She could hear the muffled voices of John and Sarah asking him if he was okay, but all they got in return was a shout at for being stupid again and not knowing anything. Molly closed the book and moved the parchment from her lap and waited for the silence that would indicate that Sherlock had left the library.
"True. When we were younger we watched our grandmother prepare elderberries and it seemed very pointless to consume something that took so long to prepare. It was very delicious though." Sherlock hummed as he looked back at the reports. "The sexual relationship though seems a bit odd." Sherlock hummed as he looked at the report, his face still flushed brightly.
“Yes, Sherlock.” John replied with a soft kiss and smile to his lips.
John grabbed Sherlock's hand, interlocking his fingers with his, keeping him close and tight. Mrs. Watson looked down at Sherlock and looked down worringly at him. Sherlock knew that he was going to have to talk about what happened in the room, and that something bad may happen to him as well. Sherlock squeezed John's hand tighter and nodded at Mrs. Watson who took them over to the floo. Harriet went first, then Sherlock, and John. Mrs. Watson took a moment longer as the kids waited on the otherside, looking sorrowly at the golden statutes of the waterfall in front of them.
"Thank you John. How ever did you get it though?" Sherlock asked obviously impressed.
"Cute." John whispered to himself with a warm look to his face, probably thinking that Sherlock hadn't heard him.
"It's probably the reason why Sarah constantly tries to leave marks on John, though he never really seems to enjoy it." She said looking at John up in sky smiling away handsomely.
“You’re one of the few people in this world who understands me.”
"Wow, how did you know that I was new here?" John asked in excitement.
"Oh, he just really needs as a case, and the way to get the information he needs is to either talk to his father or ask Mycroft." Molly explained.
John was almost bouncing on the spot he seemed so excited about the prospect of this case. John laughed to himself after a moment knowing that Sherlock wouldn't ask either his Father or Mycroft for the information, as I would be detrimental to his belief that he could do things himself.
Sherlock needed John. John set everything right in Sherlock world, and if he was lucky the man would be here with him forever.
“Thanks, Sherlock.” John deadpanned.
“So articulate, John.” Sherlock chuckled.
"How could you?! How could you?!" The drunken man spat in John's mother face.
"What do they usually say?" John asked.
"Yes, I wonder too." Molly sighed sarcastically to herself, knowing that John would catch on quickly.
"What's happening?" Sherlock asked, feeling a little excited about the idea of a case.
Sherlock felt himself collapse against John in exhaustion, his hold of John's wrists loosening into a limp hold. John and Sherlock breathed in heavily together on the table, Sherlock listening to John's rapidly beating heart. He could feel John's shifting slightly underneath him, his hands burying themselves into the dark curls on top of his head lovingly. John wriggled again uncomfortable, signalling that he was starting to get very stiff and sore on the table. Sherlock shook his head from his orgasmic bliss and removed himself off John's, helping him off the table as well. John quickly rearranged his jumper, trousers and pants, tucking himsef delicately back in. Sherlock walked over to the sink and washed his hands as John fxed himself.
"Possession, that's the thing. Possession. What's the girlfriends name Molly?" Sherlock grabbed Molly by the arms in excitement.
"How about I get this for you Sherlock, as long as you promise not to cause anymore trouble for the rest of week." She winked as Sherlock beamed enthusiastically.
“You know what I mean.” John huffed as he threw the blanket off his head, making Sherlock chuckle again at his irritated look.
"Well you obviously come from scottish heritage, as your hair seems to take on a little red tinge in the light, though if you were to stay out in the sun long enough I would say it would go completly blonde. Your skin is normally fair, but you currently have a slight tan to it, so you must go outside to play frequently, something a wizarding child rarely does, unless they have their own property, or their parents watch them constantly if they're in front of muggles. Your family is well off, but from the smell of it, your father is a bit of an alcoholic. The smell has still lingered on you. Your Mother is a witch, thats how you came into your magical inheritence, but she didn't tell you until you recieved your letter to school I imagine. You have an older sibling, most likely a brother considering the bruising on your forearms, indicating rough housing, or a lot of fighting, and considering the hand spread I would say a male from that. Did I leave anything out?" The child finished staring at John with pride.
Sherlock has been very irritating and depressed for awhile now, as you are fully aware of. I found out today that Auror Lestrade is doing some work on Geoffery Graves suicide. I know It's out of line, but would you mind to terribly if you could send over some of the information about the case and couple of the photographs so Sherlock could give it a look over. I reckon it would cheer him up immensely to have a case to pour his brain over.
"Sherlock, calm down." Molly laughed, as his excitement was on overload.
When John Hamish Watson and Harriet Watson turned eleven years old, they were thrown into one of the biggest changes of their lives. They both recieved a letter saying they were to be admittied into Hogwarts school of witchcaft and wizardry. Their mother had taken them into John's room and explained to them, how important this part of their lives would be. She took great care telling her children, that when she was their age she too had recieved a letter that said she would attend this prestigious school, and that everything leading up to her life now was a result from it.
Sherlock noted the nervous tick and left the subject closed, knowing that it was most likely a touchy subject that he was thinking about. Sherlock looked back down at reports and flicked them around in his hands before placing them back in the parcel carefully. John quickly removed his shirt and tie, when Sherlock looked back up at John in slight concern. John's face was constricted tight in thought, his lips pursing slightly. One his shirt was fully removed John stood there with his Quidditch shirt in hand as he began shaking his head, removing the thoughts. Sherlock flushed at John's tanned chest and buried his face into John's bedding, trying to ignore the older boy now putting on his shirt and changing his pants.
1987: The Geoffery Graves Case Part 2
"That's rude." John said as he stared in surprise at the boy.
As John moved to place the bacon and eggs on both of their plates. Sherlock saw a soft glow fleck of light dance into the kitchen from the living room window. It landed on John’s face when he placed the plates on the table with a soft smile. Sherlock looked over to the window and back at John. the colour dancing across him again.
In 1986 Sherlock started Hogwarts, he was more than keen to start and excell above all the other students. He already had a sound understanding of the school and how it ran because of Mycroft. He understood all of the teachers, and their teaching behaviours, what they wished from students when it came to marking time and exams, and above all John Watson was there. Sherlock wanted more than anything to see John. He was the only person in this world that Sherlock believed to be, not dull. Which confused Sherlock greatly. The boy that Sherlock had met all those years ago would now be in his fourth year of Hogwarts, and would have a much more sounder knowledge of magic then when he first learnt it all those years ago.
Mike started talking about his Ancient Runes essay over with Sherlock seeing if he could help him with any of the information that he could have possibly missed. Mike was often in trouble with this class, and Sherlock had no idea why Mike was taking the subject if it troubled him this greatly. Sherlock pointed out several mistakes along the page to Mike when a screeching could be heard over head, indicating the daily mail was in-fluxing into the the Great Hall. Sherlock looked above as what appeared to be hundreds of owls were flying above them, each looking for it's own master. Sherlock could see John's barn owl with an incredibly large manila envelope, happily flitting down next to him. John took the package off him, and gave the owl a little scratch on the head while feeding him a couple crumbs of toast to him.
John left his place on the floor and crawled over to the bed. Burying himself under the covers. He closed his eyes and started to breathe in deeply, trying to calm himself completely. He thought of Rosie downstairs with Mrs. Hudson and smiled a little to himself as he remembered her waving bye bye to him and Sherlock before they left on the case. Thinking of Rosie being safe always calmed him down. Her little curls in teal bows that Sherlock had struggled to do. Her chubby arms waving excitedly at him. John had known that Sherlock would always come back to him and Rosie, it still hurt though to watch the man he cared most about have a gun pointed at him. John could still hear the ringing of gunfire echoing around in his head. If he had just be in the know of the situation at hand he probably wouldn’t be so angry at Sherlock. But he fact is he wasn’t told the plan, and he had to watch the man he loved be shot at.
Sherlock loathed 1987.  He was in the middle of his second Year at Hogwarts, and it was also the year John got a girlfriend. Though mind you it only lasted about the first half of the school year. John had started to ignore Sherlock's needs for this Sarah's, and that was just not on, in his opinion. She was nice enough Sherlock understood, but she just had to be stopped. She was putting a halt on plans, on lessons, on puzzles and on the bloody cases. Whenever Sherlock was sitting with John in the quiet of the library, reading and writing down all of the work that John was currently working on, and that Sherlock was craving on learning. She would come sauntering in with a shake of her hips and plop her stupid hufflepuff butt right next to John and distract him with her stupid shiney smile.
Sherlock had a run in with Peeves in the beginning of the year that still upset him to this day. John had warned Sherlock of the poltergeist's fondness for creating cruel names and songs, but Sherlock believed he could entice the poltergeist in some sort of deal when it came for help around the school. Needless to say it didn't work. Peeves had tormented Sherlock with any chance he got when he saw the young boy in the same corridor as him.
“No, let me finish, John. You’re not simple. You’re difficult to understand. You’re incomprehensible to me. I see something in you that I want. I need. And when I saw you dancing there with Rosie, I felt everything just grow. I’m really not good at this..” Sherlock said with a bright blush over his face.
“John, I love you.” Sherlock shouted over to the retreating figure of his lover.
"Well, I'll always be around to curb what you say. You can't survive without me." John laughed boisterously as Sherlock, waved his arms flabbergasted trying to defend that he could survive without John to come to his aid.
"What are you doing?" Sherlock asked eyeing John as he checked his watch.
1986 was one of the years that Sherlock had committed to his mind palace, it was spaced near the first time he met John, the last time he saw his beloved Crup, Red Beard, and the fall of the Dark Wizard, Lord Voldemort, by Little Harry Potter. It was the year that Mycroft was promoted in the Ministry of Magic, and was in the middle of helping the current Minister delgate punishments for known Death Eaters. Which was one of the most exciting things Sherlock had ever heard of his brother doing.
"As much as it pains me to agree with you Sherlock, yes this assignment in particular is incredibly painful and stupid." Harry muttered, earning a bright grin fom her friend.
1985-1986
Watching John move around, and hearing Rosie shuffle around in the next room quietly babbling to whatever toy was in her grasp, was something Sherlock thought he would never hear or see. He was more than happy at the outcome of John moving back into the flat with Rosie, and even happier when he managed to cross a threshold in their relationship he thought he would never be able to cross. Sherlock looked over at John again. He was standing at the counter with his hands on his hips, waiting patiently for the kettle to reach the boiling point. John’s greying hair fell flat on his head, except for the stupid cowlick that always managed to stick up at the back of his head. The cream coloured atrocity he was wearing looked warm and inviting on the smaller man. Sherlock sighed slightly, silently pushing his experiment away from him. He still had trouble believing that John and Rosie were in his life like this. He imagined that all his lies and his difficulties would have forced John away forever, but somehow the man was in his life, closer than ever.
As they waited for the potion to finish brewing, which according to Snape was something that could take a bit of time. They copied notes of the board and some in the books, on different properties of the billywig stigs, and what they could be used for in different potions. Sherlock already knowing this information from John's notes when he was in second year, wrote down little extra pieces in his book that Snape left out. Once he was finished Sherlock closed his eyes and driftied off into his own mind.
“But we can learn with each other.”
John flew over closer and hopped off his broom in front of her Sherlock. He smiled happily down at the beaming boy, and the blushing Molly, who looked as though she had lost the function to breathe. Sherlock grabbed John robes and started pulling him along in excitement to continue on with the case.
1982 was a year that changed John's life. He and his sister left on platform nine and three quaters on an old red steam engine. He travelled across a huge lake, with a terrifying giant squid inside it to reach his school, while he was directed by a man who was almost the size of his house. He was sorted into Gryffindor with his sister right ahead of him. He met some amazing friends called Mike Stamford who was in Hufflepuff, Charlie and Bill Weasley, brothers both in the Gryffindor house. Charlie was a few year older than him and Bill as well. He also met Sherlock's snobby older brother who was in Slytherin. He was a posh old git and was in his fifth year and refused to give anyone the time of day except for a former student who kept coming back to discuss his internship with something called the Aurors, with Professor McGonagall and Headmaster Dumbledore.
It usually took about three weeks before Sherlock cracked, and he would have to take control of the situation. It was usually close to Christmas, and John would have decorated the flat with garlands and wreaths. He seemed to like the more contemporary colours that had come out in more recent years. Sticking to copper, gold, silver, black and turquoise, little wooden LED lights hanging delicately, the house looked festive and vibrant. The black christmas tree in the corner of the flat, baubles shining brightly from the stark contrast. John had obviously chosen the colours he liked for the theme, with Sherlock in mind. Cold colours mixed with warm ones, both standing out side by side but complimenting, it just felt like them on a christmas tree. Sherlock being the cold blues, silvers and blacks, and John the warm coppers and gold, even the small wood LED snowflakes were a warm reminder of John.
“You promise this.” John asked.
Sherlock insulted Sarah whenever he got the chance to do so. He would nitpick about her slight behavioural keys, that he learnt from observing her with John, he would sneer at her when she tried to suggest an observation on one of their cases, and would roll his eyes when she would whisper something provocative into John's ears, which caused John to become a stuttering mess, and completely droll. Sherlock loathed this woman so much it almost hurt to physically look at her.
"They will probably all get eaten before one of them comes over again." John laughed patting Sherlock's chest.
“I knew I was coming back, John. Didn’t you trust me enough to come back. I will always come back for you and Rosie.” Sherlock tried reaching the door handle again.
“John, I would do anything for you and Rosie.” Sherlock whispered grazing his lips along John’s cheek, earning a passive grumble.
“Well I don't know what it is, Sherlock.” John said, feeling Sherlock’s face edge closer.
"I don't know. Nobody knew for certain. Graves liked to keep to himself, thats why a lot of people assume it was suicide." Molly said, wincing at the grip Sherlock had on her arms.
"Fine." Sherlock said, looking back down at the reports. "By the looks of the body it does seem like a suicide. But it seems to clean to cut, almost perfect in the way the body looks. Almost as if someone has done research for this before it was done." Sherlock hummed to himself as he listened to John take his robe off, trying hard to concentrate on the paper in front of him.
"Leave him alone Dad!" John screamed, tears running down his face as he turned in the mans grip harshly. His arms encaving Sherlock's skinny frame to protect him from any harm.
“Why shouldn’t I be.” Sherlock said, his voice muffled in John’s neck.
“Mmm.” Sherlock hummed towards John, trying to focus more attention to the experiment again.
Sarah walked over to them smiling, looking down at the parcel in Sherlock's arms, obviously having observed that John was the one to receive it at breakfast. Sherlock nodded to her with a slight smile, and John kissed her cheek softly as a welcoming hello. Students started flooding out of the Great Hall indicating breakfast was finishing and that classes were about to start for the day. Sherlock looked over to see Molly smiling happily at him as she walked from the hall finding him with John and Sarah.
"I could have you kicked out of here you know. Nothing to stop for requesting a password change." Harry said, eyes now focusing on the paper in front of her.
"Sherlock it's rude to stare." Molly said uncomfortably as she figured out that Sherlock was fixated on the couple.
John remained quiet under the covers, his eyes open looking at the warm glow of light from under the covers.
"Graves? I think Lestrade is on that one. Molly tells me he was here the other day."John said, ruffling the back of his head, trying to figure out how to stop Sherlock sending the letter to his father.
“No, Sherlock! There were other choices. You just chose to ignore them!” John turned and yelled back at the man before storming off into their bedroom and slamming the door on the younger man’s face.
"You asked Mycroft?!" Sherlock exclaimed.
"Oh, yeah. The Graves kid. I thought he just transferred and thats why his friends were crying." Sherlock said.
"She'll deal with it I imagine. Just let me break for Quidditch practice though." John laughed as Sherlock nodded.
"I'm sure they will." John chuckled, removing himself from the ground. "So what's bringing you up here?"
“John, you love me?” Sherlock shook his head out of his stupor.
“Is everything alright?” John asked, obviously worried about Sherlock.
"You have to ask to Sherlock. He was in Ravenclaw after all." John sighed removing himself off the bed.
"Oh, and whats that?" The boy asked as he to looked over John's shoulder.
"Professor Trelawney has given us a constellation essay. We have to figure out what will be said in our star charts for the month." She responded as Sherlock snorted to himself at the ridiculousness of the class.
Mrs. Watson was lying against the floor in disbelief. Sherlock quickly followed John to help Mrs. Watson, up and noticed the way she looked at John. She was scared and impressed all at the same time. She had obviously never witnessed something like this in her life as well, and would know all to well what the possibly concequence for something like this could be. Harriet ran over to all of them and wrapped her arms around her mother tightly. She grabbed John's hand in hers and shook her head, crying with relief.
They later went into several book stores to pick up their standard books for the first year, all their equipment, and their mother had decided to pay for an owl for them to share. John fell deeply in love with a muddled brown barn owl. His feather were soft and siken, his eyes were deep and dark, and he danced around hooting, playing John right under his wing. Harriet wanted a cat, se loved the small little black kitten staring up at her with curiousity, meowing slightly, as she tried to reach through the cage with her dainty fingers to pet it. Mrs. Watson eventually caved in and both her children a pet each. John named his owl Gladstone. Harriet named her cat Lilith.
"No. Well elderberries can be, but you have to boil them, cook them, actually quite a lot of things before you can consume them. I think Taro is more common in asian countries, but you never eat the leaves. But everyone knows you're not suppose to eat toadstools. That seems like common knowledge for everyone considering the colouring."John explained.
"Colours that compliment each other." Sherlock answered, causing a confused look on John's face.
“Why?”
"Well, I can't say that, Mum's right over there. You did however get one thing wrong." John smiled as he looked over his shoulder.
"Geoffery Graves was in a sexual relationship with a person that wanted to own him solely?" Sherlock questioned to himself.
"Only yours, Sherlock." John spoke softly, placing a small kiss across Sherlock's swollen lips.
"My names John Watson. It's nice to meet you." John extended his hand the boy.
“I’m sorry, John.” Sherlock spoke softly through the door.
Sherlock snapped this year when John has just finished frying up a batch of honey bites. Sherlock watched as John took one of the bites and popped into his mouth with a crunch. John hummed happily to himself in bliss as the sweet flavour bursted over his tongue. Sherlock had been trying so hard not to jump John when he smelt cardamon on the air and the sweetness of orange blossom water, rose water and red gum honey that Sherlock had gotten from an australian client.
John looked down at Sherlock with slight chuckle, knowing that he was trying to be polite not to say anything on the matter of divination classes. Though it did go notice by Harry she just sighed into her paper and looked up Sherlock.
“Tea?” John asked from the sink.
"And are these common muggle foods John?" Sherlock questioned.
“But, I love you John. And Rosie. Both Mycroft and I thought this was the best possible outcome for everyone's safety.” Sherlock continued.
John watched as Molly walked of the library heading of down towards the hufflepuff basement . John knew there was a lot that Sherlock was hiding from him lately. It had a lot to do with the fact that him and Molly were getting so much more closer than normal as well. Perhaps there was something there? John thought to himself. He quickly left the library without even a goodbye to Sarah, in his haste to owl Mycroft for some information about the Graves case.
“God, Sherlock.” John moaned, his hand fisted hard into the dark curls.
"What's the case." John's interest piqued.
"Hold on Sherlock, I can't just leave the team in the middle of practice." John frowned over at Sherlock who was twirling in a mass of excitement now.
“John, you open this door now!” Sherlock growled grabbing the handle and throwing his body weight into the door now.
"You take them away. You allow them to pracitice that nonsense and make them into something abnormal. How could you?!" He shouted as he pointed to John.
"Mum? What about Dad?" Harriet cried as she looked over at her father.
“If we ever have to face this kind of danger again, I will tell you, John. I won’t make that mistake again.”
Unfortunatly it was also the year that John's mother divorced his father, and he began drinking more to cope with what his children were. John fought constantly with his father, trying to show that he was not scared of who he was, and what he could do. It was also the year his mother moved to London, causing a huge rift between the lines of his family. The only person John talked about this to was Sherlock.
There was brief moment where Sherlock lips brushed up against his. John felt his eyes close at the touch, his arms encircling around Sherlock’s waist to keep him grounded in the feeling. Sherlock’s nose brushed up against his gently, lips now tenderly pressed themselves along his cheek, and into the crook of his neck. John sighed into Sherlock’s shoulder, as them man buried himself further into the crook of John’s neck. Inhaling the smell of soft cotton, tea, and Rosie’s baby powder. He crowded John into the counter, pressing him up against it. Feeling the smaller man’s hands run up and down his back slowly.
"When the girls talk about in the dorms it usually has something to do with the fact that people feel an odd sense of possession when in relationships." Molly said, now looking up at the quidditch pitch.
"I suppose you're right John." Sherlock said looking up at John when he noticed he stopped moving, and seemed to be in deep thought. "John, are you alright?"
Sherlock’s mouth left John’s chest, the older man whining at the cold air now brushing against his skin. Sherlock unbuttoned John’s jeans as quick as he could and shoved them down his waist, down to his knees along with his briefs. Sherlock looked down at John’s dishevelled form. He looked a mess of hot red flushing skin, his greying hair fuzzed in different directions from the blankets and pillows, blue eyes darkened with desire. He was mouthwatering. Sherlock kissed softly down John’s stomach, forcing John’s thighs as wide as they could go with the jeans pooled where they were.. Sherlock moved against John’s length, his teeth scraping against his thighs. A hand slowly encasing itself around John in a tight warm hold, he could feel himself pulsate in Sherlock’s hold, his mind going blank at the feeling of fingers moving up and down in a lazy movement. A wet glide suddenly surrounded itself around John, his body jumping a little in surprise at the feeling of Sherlock’s tongue moving against the tip of his cock. Then there was suction, hot, wet suction.
John huffed a laugh at the man in front of him. It was unbelievable that to some extent that Sherlock had become a romantic in their relationship. Though half the time John knew that Sherock saying these things was just a way for the man to try to figure out what John was. After all these years Sherlock still had found John interesting to be around. That he was somehow more entertaining than the other people they encountered in the world.
"John, ask Mycroft? That's stupid." Sherlock huffed. "Molly stop suggesting stupid things."
"Of course, why wouldn't I?" John asked in confusion.
"Mum do you have a pen?" John shouted over at his mother frightening Sherlock slightly.
“Hmm, you have to cook dinner for the week. And it can’t just be toast with honey on it: John chuckled at Sherlock’s grimace.
“Fine. But I get have you anyway I want tonight after we put Rosie to bed.” Sherlock said with a little smirk on his face.
"Did you just see that though." Sherlock asked.
"You won't be seeing him for a while, you probably won't be able to see him again." She sighed, standing up and taking her children's hands.
“Fuck you, Sherlock!” John raged from behind the door. Sitting in front of it throwing all his weight into keeping it shut like a child in a tantrum.
Sherlock groaned and jumped up from his chair. He took quick strides over to the kitchen and stood over John. John gulped the last bite in surprise and smiled, small little innocent grin as he grabbed a bite and offered it to Sherlock. Sherlock leaned in and took the offered bite from John's fingers. The sweet honey glaze and burst of orange bloosom cascaded over his tongue as he crunched into the bite. Sherlock raked his tongue over the honey coating on John's fingers, softly sucking the tips of them. John's pupils dilated, and his breathe deepened as Sherlock stared down at him intently as he gave one last suck to the fingers, before releasing them. John launched himself at Sherlock lips as soon as he finger were released. Sherlock grabbed the back of John's neck, plastering him to the front of him. Sherlock raked his tongue over John's bottom lip, earning a groan from him. Sherlock was feeling so high, the taste of honey and rose water on John, the soft emitted groans from him. It was all so intoxicating. Sherlock pushed John up against the table, lifting him up to sit on it. John leaned back, feeling overwhelmed as Sherlock dominated the kiss. Sherlock nibbled John's bottom lip softly, his hand burying itsef into the back of John's hair, the other grabbing him around the waist pulling him in close. Sherlock moaned as he felt John wrap his legs arond his waist creating pressure against their groins.
“Good. It has to be what I want, it can’t just be toast with the ‘good’ honey.” Sherlock smirked over at John, who was chuckling.
"Any reason why?" John chuckled as he placed the tea on the coffee table.
Sherlock pushed John further against the table his hands running down to John's belt, his mouth now moving against John's neck, sucking, biting, pretty much just devouring as much of John as he could. Here against John's neck was the taste of sugary, buttery dough, most likely had gotten some smeared there during the cooking process. Sherlock felt as John's hands were now at the hem on his tight trousers, pulling the black slim fit shirt of them, as he was quickly un-zipping John's trousers and trying to pull them down along with his red pants that he seemed to favour. John had now slipped the buttons of Sherlock's shirt, exposing his chest. Hands ran down to the trousers again and quickly made work of the button and fly. He cupped Sherlock's cock, teasingly tracing against the seam of his pants, near the head.
"I didn't know Grave's had a girlfriend." Sherlock answered dismissevely.
John learned his love for potions, even if Professor Snape was a bit cold and demeaning. He loved defense against the dark arts, herbology, flying, history of magic. The only thing he grew bored of was Muggle studies. But the best thing was that someone other than his Mum wrote to him all the time. Sherlock Holmes, the boy with a million thoughts running through his head, and a million answers to give if anyone had any.
Molly hummed a thanks of appreciation over to him, and looked over to see Anderon struggling with it as well. Molly looked at Sherlock expectantly, hoping he would help him as well. Sherlock huffed in irriatation and just grabbed the product from the boys horn from his hands. Anderson about to shout something, stopped when he noticed Sherlock shaving the horn for him perfectly. He handed it over to Anderson with a scathing look and sniffed at Molly who smiled happily over at Sherlock.
The only thing that John could really remember was how angry his father was that day. He had never been told about his wife's secret life, he was never told the potential his children could have, or the fact that their was even magic. He became distraught as he watched his wife bring magic into their house, and the children would watch in delight as she would transfigure pots and kettles into birds of many different colours, or charm the dishes into washing themselves. He yelled and screamed for answer to her secrecy for days, the only reply she gave was that she had to hide her magic for so long because of the current war.
"And John's relationship with Sarah is?" Molly chuckled slightly, while Sherlock threw her a filthy look.
"Why?" John asked looking over at the blushing boy.
"You little Shit! How dare you talk to me like that. What gives you any reason to talk to me like that?!" Mr. Watson raged loudly.
“When I first met you I saw a fire glow.” John spoke softly.
Sherlock stayed alongside Molly for four months of John's dating. Helping her with her work, watching as she played around in the herbology labs, following her into her library, to escape the stupid faces of John and Sarah kissing each other in the Great Hall. It wasn't until Sherlock became so fed up with it that he shouted in anger into his pillow and groaned that he finally started to think up of a plan to remove this girl from John.
Sherlock never heard of anything to do with Mr. Watson again, unless it was when John was remeniscing about something from when he was a child. Harriet changed for a short while after the incident as well. She was a lot calmer and a lot less boisterious, but soon came back to her normal self. John, was still the same, but not at the same time. There was always something hidden in his mind when he talked about what him, his sister and mum did during holidays, or when he talked about home in general. Sherlock knew that John was blaming himself for something, but he never inquired about it, because he knew it would be 'a bit not good'.
Sherlock pushed the pages back in the parcel shaking his head in disbelief. He wrapped his arms around John quickly and hugged him tightly without even realising what he was actually doing. Sherlock coming to on what he had done pulled away quickly and coughed in discomfort as John looked at him in slight shock. Usually he was the one to initiate some sort of physical contact with Sherlock.
"Sorry Sherlock. I only know the chemistry that makes up the human body, and how to heal it."
“How about not putting yourself into that kind of situation, Sherlock.” John mumbled.
John quickly folded the piece of parchement and placed it into envelope with Mycrofts name and address. He waved over to Mike, who was still struggling to comprehend what has happening on his paper, and headed off down stairs into the common room, bidded a quick hi and bye to Harriet again who looked perturbed at John going in an out. John exited the portrait and headed over to th owlery in the west tower of the school.
That year was 1982. The year that John crossed all barriers of his known life and became a wizard. John was both scared and enamoured by the prospect of something new. His mother always said that the unknown and dangerous always excited John, and the idea of magic was certainly new and dangerous to him. He finally understood why he accidentally made his sisters things dissapear, or why when he yelled and scream at her, his voise would suddenly go mute without reason. It was also the year that John's father began drinking to cope with the new addition of weirdness in their life.
"That would be nice, I guess. You're not nearly as dull as other people." Sherlock spoke softly.
Quidditch practice was always dull in Sherlock's opinion. Though it was a delight to see John so happy doing what he knew he could do well. Gryffindor was flying around the pitch in a blur of red and gold.  Every now and then John would stop and give a young student on the side lines a few notes. Sherlock had heard his name being mentioned a few times by John and Molly. Something Wood... He seemed very enthralled with the game, very passionate whenever John would give him pointers, he was still too young to join the team though.
"Yep, but you're only allowed to play with it if I'm supervising. I don't think your parents would know to much about this." She laughed as Sherlock bounced up and down excitedly.
"Just choose you Idiot!" The boy yelled at him.
"Alright Molly, I'll ask Mycroft for the information. I doubt he would deny me the request, as it would put Sherlock in a better mood. And I know for a fact that he is getting sick of his surly behaviour lately." John laughed.
John failed to keep his promise the next time he saw Sherlock they had gotten into his father's case files. Sherlock had been very intrigued by the work his father was currently progressing through. The victims in question had been poisioned by acromantula venom, but there was no record of any acromantula ring in Britain at this current time, the only one he could find was in Spain. Sherlock flicked through the pictures with John, constantly asking him questions about the bodies,. But John really had no idea about any of it at all, though he was very excited to help Sherlock in his quest. When Sherlock's father brought home a big round egg, the size of a soccer ball. Sherlock of course took it upon himself to hatch the creature that dwelled within it. Of course it only took Sherlock a few minutes to figure out what to do to progress the egg to hatch faster. Needless to say it only took a couple of hours for the creature to be released and John to be sent to St Mungo's first floor for Acromantula poisioning, and for Mr. Holmes to recieve and inquiry of his own at work. Sherlock never stopped apologising to John the entire time he stayed in hospital, which of course was only a couple of days. Mrs. Watson decided then that boys should be doing visits at her house instead, saving another trip to the hospital for future cases considering the Holmes line of work.
Sherlock watched as Mrs. Watson tried to pull the man away with all strength, as he inched closer to John. Harriet took her oppourtunity to run into the kitchen, trying to pull Sherlock with her. But he wouldn't budge. Sherlock stood his ground behind John, his eyes flickering over the man's dishevelled appearance. He could see the obvious signs of alcoholism etched into every corner of the mans enraged face. The red spider veins climbing on his nose, the bleary blood shot look in the eyes. numerous crumbs and stains on the mans skin, indicating he was not even aware of what was clinging to his face, and the staggering violence he was emitting from the focused look he had on John.
"Ah, well I hope they enjoy it." Sherlock responded, feeling a little miffed at the idea of John buying other people presents.
"It's getting late Sherlock, and what kind of Prefect would I be letting students walk the corridors at night." John said as the reached the steps.
"Yeah, sure. Ask Mycroft. I'm sure he would love to know his crazy little brother wants to solve a case." Sherlock chuckled disdainfully to himself.
“There’s something here. Something I can’t find.” Sherlock answered, feeling John’s voice break whatever hold he had been in.
Robes were the next thing to come by, Mrs. Watson only purchased basic robes, but saw fit to the children being fitted. Harriet explained to the woman measuring her that she wanted to stand out at school, be popular and the queen of the entire school. When the woman asked John what he wanted, he just explained he wanted to be as normal as any other child there. Mrs. Watson smiled at her son, and chuckled at her daughter sweetly for her enthusiasm. They left bags full to brim of items for school, and stopped quickly for an icecream.
"Well I don't know Sherlock, it's rude to even ask someone that." Molly hissed softly trying to Sherlock from looking at the couple.
“Honestly I’m surprised you said it first though.” John chuckled as Sherlock was still standing in slight shock.
“Yes, Sherlock.” John answered.
"It's in their nature Hamish. They can't hide it. They can't ignore it. It's what they are. They are special children." She spoke loudly as she tried to move her way in between the children.
"Mrs. Watson is that a muggle potion kit?" Sherlock asked pointing at the display.
Sherlock cried as John choked and struggled against his father. He felt something tingling against his body where John was holding him tight. He felt something like this before from his brother, but not as intense as what he was feeling now. He could feel magic building around him, encloving him and John. This was incredible. John was unconciously building his magic for something huge. Sherlock continued to struggle with Mr. Watson's hold on the boy. John gave out one choked scream and everything exploded in a loud bright bang. Sherlock's entire body was wrapped in John's arms. John had forced with all his magic into a huge explosion. His Mother and father had flown across the room on one side, and Harriet had been pushed back. The wand in her hand dropped to the floor in fright. Sherlock felt the warmth tickling his body, it was unbelievably intense. He had never felt magic this strong in his life, not even his brother could have produced something like that intentionally. John looked down at Sherlock, who was looking up at him in awe. John was freaking out, he arms were burning, his body was aching and his mind was muddled mess. He looked around the room and saw his mother trapped underneath his father. He quickly released Sherlock who felt the buzz of magic leave him, and pulled his unconcious father off his mother.
Sherlock walked along with Molly in tow. He quickly deposited off the package in his dorm in his trunk to hide, and grabbing his potions books before heading off to the dungeons with Molly. When they sat down at their tables bringing out all the little piece of equipment from the potions closet, they started looking over the black board to see what today's potion was going to be. Sherlock grimaced as Anderson next to Molly when he brought out his equipment, and started going over the list of ingredients. Molly pulled out her belongings as well and looked over at Sherlock, who now seemed to be sporting a small flush to his face. Molly shrugged it off as just him being irritated with having someone that he didn't really like sit with them again.
Mr. Watson sneered at his daughter as she continued to point the wand at him. His hands tightened around John, encaving the boys throat. Harriet looked at her Mother, who was still trying to pry the man's arms away from John's throat. The grip around John's throat squeezed him severily. Sherlock was now fighting at the man's hands, using his nails to dig into the skin hard, even going so far as to bite the mans arm when he could see the pressure force on John's throat. Harriet started hyperventilating, her mind muddling in fear at her father. She mustered a huge amount of courage and started to think of a possible defense spell to fly her father away, but nothing was coming to mind. John looked down at Sherlock, biting his father's hands, clawing at the fingers, trying in vain to free him. He could feel his mother tugging hard behind his father, trying to fight against the weight and strength of her ex-husband. John could see Harriet freaking out in front of him, trying to find something in her head to use against her father.
Sherlock looked shocked as he saw John on the ground with Bee now nibbling the blond locks of his hair happily. Sherlock nodded and walked towards them, noting that John just gave a small smile when he approached. Bee flew over to Sherlock landing against his shoulder, now starting to nibble and preen through Sherlock's curls.
"Or Mycroft could find out, and it could be worse." John laughed again, wrapping his arm around Sherlock, scaring off Bee from Sherlock, as he tried to usher Sherlock out the door.
"Then why don't you meet there?" Harry asked as her friend was still snickering.
"I asked your brother last night. You have been so moody lately, that I thought a good case would make you happy. Plus Mycroft has some sort of power over Lestrade so I knew he could get it easily." John explained happily.
After potions Molly bidded Sherlock goodbye as she went off to herbology with the Slytherins, and he went off defense against the arts. The irritating feeling of tightness did fade away eventually. That was until he thought back to John from this morning, and the heat would come back to see cheeks again. He would just shake his head clearing his thoughts as quickly as possible and looked to concentrate fully on the rest of the classes for the morning.
"Well, this time, I have a feeling that we could be caught, and I know for a fact that Filch is going to be very irritable tonight considering Peeves has put gum in all the locks of the surrounding corridors." John said, looking down at Sherlock.
Sherlock growled in irritation with John's hands and grabbed both of them quickly and placed them above his head against the table. He confined them into one grip tightly, the other wandering down John's chest, pulling up the thick bulky sweater and shirt. Sherlock, placed soft kisses against the newly exposed skin. John struggled against Sherlock's grip slightly, as he felt lips against one of his nipples, and a hand now pulling against his cock. He whined slightly into his throat as Sherlock ran the tip of his thumb against the head smearing pre come over the head. Sherlock started thrusting slightly against John, trying to relieve the pressure in his groin.
“I love you.” Sherlock said, taking himself and John by surprise.
Sherlock wasn't too sure what had happened after in entire thing, he told his peace to the minister about what happened and then was forced to go home with his parents before he could find out what was to happen with John and his mother. When he asked John a couple of hours later, he was told that he was allowed to go to school and nothing too bad had happened. Though Sherlock knew otherwise.
He headed off to the Gryffindor common room to see Harriet talking to one of her friends on the couch. She was cosying closer to the girl who had her arm wrapped around her comfortingly. John quickly said a hey to her and ran up to his dorm to find Mike on his bed concentrating throughly on the Ancient Runes essay they have to have done by tomorrow. He quickly grabbed his ink and quill, with a small piece of parchment and jotted down a note.
Even as John began his teenage years he still stayed with Sherlock, which was something the boy couldn't comprehend. When John turned fourteen and Sherlock eleven, Sherlock was still certain that he would stop communication with him. The thought of John doing that hurt, but it was always present in his mind. The idea that Sherlock was too young, too annoying, too troublesome was always on the forefront of his mind. But John took it in stride, and told him when he was being a bit not good.
“You’re in an oddly good mood this morning.” John said as he relaxed into Sherlock’s hold.
"Get John to ask him then." Molly said as she looked down beside her  for the anatomy book John was lending her.
John looked over at Sherlock, after feeling his gaze upon him. He smiled gently over to the man, soft blue eyes locked on his. Sherlock smiled bashfully back and awkwardly played with the dark mess of curls on the top of his head. John looked backed down at the kettle, still with a slight smile tipping the corner of his lips. Obviously pleased he had caught Sherlock looking at him. Sherlock always seemed to be stuck in time when John looked at him. Everything seem to move slowly around him and his heart would be the only thing he could hear or feel in some cases.
John ran over his thought of what could possibly be irritating Sherlock lately, but nothing was coming to mind. He seemed to be horrible to everyone lately, and whenever he was excited about something, he would get irritated later again when John explained he had plans with Sarah. John was aware that Sherlock had a slight issue with Sarah. She wasn't like him or Molly, or anyone Sherlock really got along with. She was popular and preppy, clever, but not too bright. She was normal. She did have some faults that he was aware of. She put too much time in her friends and thinking about parties in the Great Hall that they could throw. She was sweet, maybe a little too sweet. It got a little irritating to be honest, especially with other guys. Sarah wasn't really aware when she was being hit on, and the fact she just went with it unawaredly annoyed him greatly. She didn't like adventuring out with Sherlock on cases, which was something John missed doing alot. She was just happy to snog in the common room, or join in at a party with one of her friends. She didn't really like Sherlock all that much either come to think of it. Everytime he spoke she would roll her eyes, or mumble something under her breath aout it being strange, but she would never call him a freak. John grumbled a bit thinking about it again, and shook his head trying to eliminate the negative thoughts he was starting to think about Sarah. She was nice, she was sweet. Her and Sherlock would just have to get along if they wanted to be involved in his life.
"It wasn't hard. I just spoke about your current attitude, and that you having something to look at, or a case to go through would pick you up." John smiled, as Sherlock thought back to last night with a smile.
The next few times Sherlock and John tried to stay out of trouble. Though nearly setting the house on fire for a cookie experiment, and cutting off the hair off Harriet's dolls, just for something fun to do. It wasn't exactly keeping out of trouble, it was good enough for the boys. Mrs. Watson absolutely adored Sherlock's quick wit and observational skill just like her son did, but knew when to draw the line when he asked probing questions about her married life. Whenever they were out an about Mrs.Watson watched them like a hippogriff.
"Well, you must really like it to do that." John laughed scratching the back of his head. One of those irritating quirks he did when he was embarrassed.
“What’s wrong, Sherlock?” John asked softly, trying not disturb the man too quickly.
“So you really love me?” He asked again.
Mrs. Hudson really enjoyed John at this time. He was a lot more allocating to her meddling in the flat. She would hover over him every now and then, telling him which kind of chocolate would be best for this simple dessert, or what brand of butter was more "buttery" out of all of them. The only time Sherlock had some sort of input on this whole thing, was when John would grab an inferior jar of honey for the honey cakes. Sherlock couldn't have that happening. Sherlock wouldn't be surprised during this time if he found John and Mrs. H floating around the kitchen with a pot of tea steeping in the corner of the counter, and her hovering over John as he creamed butter and brown sugar together.
“I don’t care Sherlock.” cried into his arms
"No time John, we need to fire call Mycroft for the pathology report." Sherlock shouted in delight.
John sighed into the soft kiss, unwrapping himself from under the blankets, allowing Sherlock to be closer to him. Sherlock brought his hand to John’s face, his tongue tracing John’s bottom lip. John allowed the kiss to deepen, feeling Sherlock move his hand from his face to his hip. He grabbed hard at John’s hip grounding the man against him. John moaned into the kiss. Sherlock’s tongue delving deeper, lips sensuously moving with his. John was feeling completely consumed by Sherlock. His body feeling like it would burst into flames with just the slightest brush of their bodies. The younger man moved over the top of him, his hands briskly moving along his thighs, john shuddering as Sherlock pulled them around him.
“If dinner is good, I’ll think about giving you a treat.” John smiled as he jumped out bed of bed.
"And as much as it pains me that you agree for me for once, I still hold my opinions on divinations and why only fools take it." Sherlock chuckled smugly, earning a glare from Harry from across the common room.
“What I did, I should have thought about. I should have thought about how you would feel.”
“You can’t do that to me Sherlock! Not again!” John yelled as he stormed into the flat.
"But Mother will say no if I ask for case files. Maybe I could ask Father, but he would just get suspicious again." Sherlock spoke more to himself then to Molly.
December 1987:  The Geoffery Graves Case Part 1.
“John open the door now!” He bellowed again, now pounding the door with his fist.
"Perhaps we should ask some of his friends if they knew he was dating anyone?" John said, ruffling his fingers through Sherlock's tangled curls.
“John, stop being stupid you know there was no other way to ensure yours and Rosie’s safety.” Sherlock bellowed at the door, trying hard to open it.
"What about your brother, he could get them for you." Molly suggested as Sherlock puffed out a laugh of air.
"Well Grave's has been in a sexual relationship, that much I can tell." John replied with a bright blush on his face looking back at the toxicology. "Also these posions are a bit strange for wizards or witches. There has been cyanides and amatoxins found in his system, and traces of taro leaves, elderberries and their leaves and toadstools. That really strange." John said looking at Sherlock, who also looked perplexed and slightly flushed at the mention of the sexual relationship of the victim.
"Sherlock, one day you're going to say something so wrong and John's not going to be there to save you." Harry yelled out at the retreating figures.
Sherlock removed his mouth from John's chest with a sharp nip, earning another soft whine from John. He smirked down at John's flushed face a glazed eyes. He let go of John's length and pulled himself out of his pants. Sherlock grabbed himself and John into his hand and started thrusting and stroking in time. John moaned underneath him again, trying to break free of Sherlock's grip to at least grab a hold of him. Sherlock slipped his fingers across there heads, fluid leaking copiously out of them now. Sherlock could feel his hips stuttering against John now, his breath almost puffing harshly out of him. He couldn't stop looking into John's dark eyes. Sherlock felt theat building up intensly, he knew he wasn't going to last any longer, and by the looks of it neither was John. He brought his lips down to John's, completely consuming him. Sherlock thought John was trying to suck the life away fom him in the kiss. Their tongues slipped over each other, John's teeth grazed over his lips. The taste of honey and rosewater pulling him under, nearly drowning him. John groaned long and hard as he spilled into Sherlock's hand, his body pulsating and trembling with release. Sherlock chased after John, cresting in pleasure as he watched John completely slip in his control.
"The freshness of the bruises on his neck is something to consider, also how quickly after there copulation did he consume the vial, or what did he think the vial was for." I need more than a toxicology report on this, I need the pathology one as well. I need the levels of dopamine that was going through his body. Any fluids found. I need more information than one Mycroft sent John." Sherlock stood up bringing Molly with him.
“John I’d promise anything you ask of me. After all this time you think I won’t give you anything you asked of me.” Sherlock said to the lump under the covers.
The only good thing about this whole cooking thing was the fact John got softer. Not only in demeanor. He was softer everywhere. He would gain this small amount of fat on his stomach and behind that seemed almost luscious. Sherlock would be transfixed for what felt like hours as he watched John sway around the kitchen, high on life as he mixed something in a bowl and then looked down into his cook book, re-reading the same method for the third time. Sherlock would have to surpress a little groan when he saw John bend over the oven to check on whatever thing was baking in the over. The way his pants would be a little more snug when he bent over was like Sherlock's little personal hell. John, so unassuming and so innocent in his little cooking world, would never dream up the little illicit fantasies that Sherlock was concoting in his mind. Sherlock would sit at the kitchen table, pretending to read whatever report was in his hands, as John hummed away in the kitchen. Sherlock would watch as John licked his fingers free of melted chocolate, wipe away flour from his face, and smile over at him when he caught Sherlock gazing in his direction every now and then. John was intoxicating in the kitchen. He would always smell of whatever he baked of for the day. Usually John smelt of black pepper and bergamot from the shampoo he used in the shower. But during winter, it was cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla. It was the warmest smell in the world. Late at night when Sherlock would crawl into bed right behind John, he would nuzzle up so close to John and still smell the seductive spices lingering on his skin.
Sherlock quickly pulled away from John, and started freaking out in his head. John looked completely stunned by the remark. He looked like he also was having trouble processing the words that had been said. Then a smile cracked over John’s face. A beautiful, soft, shy smile. The colour was glowing in fractures across the both of them, the song had changed to another 80s song that Sherlock only vaguely remembered, John reached up and pushed a few of Sherlock errant curls out of his face and pushed up and met Sherlock’s lips in a quick chaste kiss. It like everything about John, was somehow extraordinary. When John pulled away from him, he offered the quirk of a smile and chuckled at Sherlock stunned expression.
Sherlock released his hand from John and unbuttoned his tight pants and took himself in hand. He took John’s cock as far as he could into his mouth and swallowed against it. John groaned and started fisting the sheets below him, Sherlock mouth torturing him in slow deep movements. He could feel the bumping of Sherlock’s hand against his leg, as the younger man pumped himself slowly. John’s eyes flew open when he felt Sherlock’s tongue move against the underside of his cock, his hips moving in time with the motion of Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock grabbed John’s hand from the sheet and moved it to his head, making John guide him at the speed he wanted.
Sherlock grabbed John’s hand tightly and moved back closer into John space. He leant down and kissed John softly again, taking advantage of it this time. Gently grazing with tender motions, until the both of them were left a little breathless. Sherlock pulled away from John, offering a unsure smile.
“No! You can’t keep doing this Sherlock! Every time there’s danger you can’t always throw yourself in front of it. What if that man had actually killed you! You wouldn't be here! What would I do? I can’t lose you again!” John sobbed as he threw his weight back into the door keeping Sherlock out.
"He is a little freak John. I have see enough to know a freak when I see one." Mr. Watson echoed through the house.
"JOHN, I NEED YOU NOW!" Sherlock shouted happily, smile splitting his face in half almost like a mad man.
"Nothing, Sweetie. We will get it all sorted out." She said sweetly as she grabbed his face and pulled it against hers.
Mrs. Watson looked over at the little kit and smiled down at Sherlock softly. The boy loved anything to do with potions. He was curious about life and death, could observe nearly every little particle on a person an know nearly exactly what was going on in their life, and still want to and needed to know more. The only thing that Sherock seriously lacked in knowledge was social interactions between people, and the solar system.
"Time to go Sherlock, you're causing too much trouble again." John laughed at Harry looked up from her paper in annoyance at the younger boy.
"Well, Lestrade from the Auror's office came down the other day again. Apparently there has been something happening, but not directly in the school." Molly said as she thought back to a couple of days ago.
Sherlock watched John as he walked into the kitchen. He kept his gaze low, pretending to be more interested in his failing experiment in front of him than the man in the cream coloured jumper. Sherlock slumped his shoulder slowly and let his eyes flicker back to the experiment in front of him as John moved to the fridge. He listened to the man groan in disgust at the morbid contents on the bottom shelf, before slamming the door of the fridge a little harsher than was necessary. Sherlock smiled to himself at the disgusted look on John’s face as he walked over to the kettle instead to fill up.
"You want to be freaks? Is that it?" He bellowed, only now taking notice of Sherlock standing behind John. "Is that one of them. One of those freaks!"
"Shameful, Selfish, Sherlock." were some of the things Peeves would jeer out.
“John, please open the door.” Sherlock spoke softly.
Sherlock turned back around at John, who was now all pink cheeked and smiles. He watched as John moved closer to him, kissing his cheek softly, as he tucked Sherlock back into his pants, chuckling to himself. Sherlock picked one of he honey bites off the counter an popped it into his mouth.
John was still writing to him every week. They met up under the watchful eyes of both their parents to talk, play, just do anything together, but what Sherlock loved most of all was the fact that John loved danger. Sherlock was danger incarnate. John's first time in meeting up with Sherlock again was in the Ministry of Magic, and they wiggled and wormed there way into the Department of Mysterys. Hiding at any opportunistic time when personnel drifted by, and they found themselves diving into hidden archives of magic more wonderous than Sherlock could have hoped for. Sherlock's mother worked as an Unspeakable at the time and her job was in located in the time room. So Sherlock had a theory of where everything was when it came to finding each room in the department. His mother liked to talk in her sleep when she was worried or something at work was causing her distress. Sherlock dragged John in the multiple layers of the department, investigating room after room. When they were found in the archive almost a full two hours later, reading some really questionable dark magic. Unfortunately for them, Mr. Lucius Malfoy had found them in the archive, and he was certainly gunning for a promotion in the ministry. Sherlock's mother faced an inquiry at work for Sherlock's behaviour, and John had never seen his mother so angry in his entire life. He promised himself never to run head first into anything Sherlock said ever again.
Molly sat herself on the stands next to Sherlock, her notes from potions class tucked neatly at her side, in case some the practice went for a little longer han what she was used to. Sherlock looked over her work and helped her with some of the harder questions that Snape seem to set to make sure the students were paying attention, and were going over some of the notes on the potions that only older students would know. Molly said it was Snapes excuse to cause some point losses for other houses.
Sherlock continued to play with the set every time him and John were together. Despite them getting into hundreds of shennanigans over John's summer and winter holidays, they were usually found expanding their minds in Mrs. Watson's kitchen. John with his biology books open, or one of his many assignments for school, and Sherlock reading one of the many chemistry books that John had borrowed from the library in town.
“John, I’m sorry.” Sherlock spoke softly, looking at the lump under the covers.
"I suppose, but no giving this one here tips about what we were doing." John laughed nudging Sarah shoulder jokingly.
"No Sherlock, Cause I wasn't staring." Molly coughed uncomfortably.
Sherlock quickly handed him the report after he was done with it, and looked down at another report that was going through the crime scene. John noticed several plant ingredients that were highly toxic with human congestion, but these weren't even remotely wizard like. These were poisons of wrongly consumed food. John shook his head in confusion, seeing a combination of taro leaves, elderberries and the leaves, and a weird mix of toadstools. So two of the poisons were cyanide and a kind of amatoxin. If untreated these would naturally cause death in anyone. But the death would be horribly painful.
"Piss off." The boy said softly, causing John to laugh boisteriously.
"Ok, Sherlock."
“John, I don’t understand you. You seem simple like most of the imbeciles in this world.” Sherlock began.
"Well, Geoffery Graves comitted suicide over the holidays as you know, but Auror Lestrade was here the other day, enquiring McGonagall and Dumbledore on some information that could have possibly be left out. So, of course Sherlock wants to know and find out a bit more about the case." Molly said.
"I'll see you after third period in your dorm?" Sherlock asked.
"Cool. Sherlock I will meet you there as well?" Molly asked, smiling over at him.
"Just a study I have conducted recently." Sherlock says taking his tea and blowing. Smiling over at John who looks at the tree and grinning happily.
“No.”
"The bruises on his neck, would you say that they are fresh or old?" Sherlock said.
"I suppose so. " Sherlock sniffed, watching Sarah grab for John's hand to lead him away to class.
“I can’t promise it won’t happen, John. You know the kind of life we live. But I will never leave you again, John. I promise. I will fight with everything I have to be with you and Rosie. And if i have to go away on a case for Mycroft, i will call, I will message, I will remain in contact so you always know that I am coming back.” Sherlock said softly.
"Any idea what that was just about?" John asked in confusion.
"The gift I was getting was for you Sherlock, I know you will enjoy it immensely. But don't open it up in the Ravenclaw tower. Come to me when you want to look over it a little more and talk to me about it." John said.
Sherlock looked at the picture of the body closely, examinging any slight differences, or trauma that could have been missed by the medical report. John looked over the report again seeing that the patient had slight abbreations against his back and arms, there was also small bruising along his hips, and neck. This indicated to John that Grave's was in a sexual relationship, and that they were slightly harsh with one another.
"Well, Sarah might get a little bored, and it could take a while." Sherlock shrugged as he looked over to the Great Hall, noticing said girl was coming out of it looking for John.
He could see John smiling brightly over at him again as he was handing him the parcel, and could feel the stupid hug he had given him in over excitement. Sherlock shook his head stupidly, feeling his face go hot and red as he thought about John again. His chest tightly restricting him again. Sherlock ran over the possible ides of why he could be feeling like this. Molly looked over at Sherlock, who was still currently shaking his head, obviously trying to remove something from his mind.
Lestrade usually hung around a little more at this time, and Mycroft too. Sherlock's annoyance at there presence could be felt all across London. Lestrade would knock on the door in guise of apparently having a case for Sherlock, usually it was a cold one he dug up somewhere. He would sit on the couch as John fed him cake, biscuits, or a slice of tart, with either a coffee or tea to compliment the flavours. Mycroft, would just come to show his "concern", when really all he wanted was whatever baked good John had whipped up in the kitchen that day. It would take at least two to three slices of whatever cake or pie that was cooling on the counter for Mycroft to leave. There would even be a subtle request from Mycroft for the next time he came over, and John stupidly enough ended up cooking it for the bastard anyway.
Molly who was also in hufflepuff, and one of Sherlock's less than dull friends, would listen to him complain all day about that Stupid Sarah, and her stupid face. Molly knowing all to well, that Sherlock was just a little jealous that John was now giving his attention to someone else, just nodded and sighed in agreemement. Molly liked Sarah. She was actually a really nice person. Popular, smart, cute, and an amazing flyer when she played as one of the chasers on the hufflepuff Quidditch team. She also helped Molly out with a lot of her work.
"The chemistry set?" John asked in confusion.
"Then perhaps you should look in the mirror. Your staggering appearance tonight tells me that you have been drinking most of your hours away. Your eyes are blood shot, you are exuding violence, the stench coming off you is interminable, and will most likely cling to you for the rest of your life. The fact that you have come here and started threatening your family, and insulted someone you don't even know, shows the inteptitude you share for people of our nature. If I were you, I would feel like a pathetic jealous muggle." Sherlock cracked as he pulled himself away from behind John.
"We have to go to the ministry John. Even with this being in defense it is still illegal for you to use magic at this age." Mrs. Watson spoke softly as she looked over to the man beside her, still unconcious to the world.
"Harry may be the oldest, but it's like by five minutes. She's also a  girl. Just has big hands, and a mad temper." John laughed again at the dark haired boy who shook his head in disbelief.
Students would later join in the taunting and jeering after realising Sherlock was a little different from them. They would close in around him and call him names. Sherlock would just stand there and take their abuse with a snide comment or a shrug of his shoulders, but John knew better on how it was affecting Sherlock. He would chase after the humilitaed boy, and wrap his arms around him. Mumbling just to forget everything he heard, and the he wasn't a freak, he wasn't a sociopath. He was remarkable, brilliant, funny, and above all his best friend.
John removed his hand from Sherlock’s head and let the younger man crawl over the top of him, trailing soft kisses against his neck once he found the place he wanted to nuzzle into lazily. John smiled happily at the feeling of Sherlock’s lips gently kissing the nape of his neck. John ran his fingers through Sherlock’s hair lovingly as they both lay there, blissed out at the feeling of pleasure and love between.
They were very much like the christmas tree standing in the corner of their flat he noted again. The warm golds, coppers and natural woods were John shining out, complimenting Sherlock's cold silvers, blacks and turquoises. Sherlock smiled to himself as he looked back over at John bringing him a mug of lemongrass and ginger tea over to him.
"Good." Sherlock hummed as he grabbed the plate and took it over with him to the couch.
Sherlock opened the parcel gently, looking over at John curiously. Sherlock pulled out one of the many thick pages out halfway and gazed down at what appeared to be a case report on the Graves suicide. Sherlock's mouth open stunned as he looked over to John who was still smiling excitedly at him. Sherlock flicked through a couple of the pages to find pictures of the crime scene, information about what had been at the crime scene, and a report from a mediwitch who had gone over the body.
“It was heavy on my mind.” Sherlock mumbled.
"Yeah, he said he had a girlfriend." Molly shrugged, looking uncomfortable at Sherlock.
Sherlock watched himself standing in the doorway of the flat. John was swaying along in time with some music that was on radio, Rosie was in his arms and smiling and babbling at John. He was singing as well, completely unaware of anyone else in the room with them. Sherlock leaned against the door and John chucked Rosie into the air, she squealed happily in delight as John caught her and kissed both her cheeks. Sherlock wasn’t too sure what the song was, but it sounded like something that he had often heard in his youth. Some 80s rock rock or pop song that would have been popular at the time. John favoured music from the 80s, it reminded him of his youth. Sherlock watched as suddenly flickers of electric indigo danced along John and Rosie’s skin. The light had caught a the coloured glass ornament that was hanging in the window. Something Sherlock had bought on an outing with John and Rosie. Rosie had squealed in delight at the colours dancing in the wind, and Sherlock had to buy it. Anything that had made her that happy Sherlock had to buy.
"So what do we know about the Graves kid suicide?" Sherlock asked, eyeing the girl with mild irritation.
John loved the excitment and danger that Sherlock created when they tried to figure things out together. It bothered both their parents and Harriet to wits end, but there was no stopping them when the two were together. Harriet had always despised Sherlock, and John's relationship, finding it annoying. She always told John that Sherlock was too young to be friends with him anymore, what would people think if they saw him hanging out with a first year when entered Hogwarts. John just responded with 'people will just talk I suppose'. Harriet did everything she could for John to see reason in her claims, but he kept shooting her down. Whenever she talked to her mother about it, she would just sigh at Harriet and explain that Sherlock was the first ever wizarding child that John got to know, there is an emotional attachment for him there, and age shouldn't affect a friendship. When Harriet told her father about John's friendship with Sherlock, he sneered and told her not to talk to him about some strange child that John is now friends with.
"Close. I'm a nurse. I work on muggles and what can heal their bodies." Mrs. Watson continued as she looked at the set with a smile.
"Yes Sherlock. That's a chemistry set. It's very similar to potions, but uses acids and bases to find a cause or to create an effect. All life stems from the ideas and notions behind chemistry and physics. Muggles find differnt ways through these to find out the mysteries of life. It's even been known to help solve police and auror cases." Mrs. Watson winked as Sherlock looked back in awe at the Chemistry set.
“What it gonna take?”Sherlock asked with a little chuckle.
"Not a lot. I wish I could have learnt more, but Mum is teaching me stuff about the human body and how it works, it's really cool." John said as he looked at his mother.
“I love you, John.” Sherlock mumbled, softly bringing his lips against John’s.
"That was bloody amazing. I can't believe you knew that all from just looking at me." John beamed at the boy.
Molly quickly made her move and flittered down to the entrance of the library, finding John looking staring where Sherlock must have left and Sarah trying to get John's attention back on her. John closed his eyes and sighed, leaving Sarah's arms moving a little closer to Molly's concerned expression.
"Isn't it fascinating John. Muggles have found a way to involve potions into there lifestyle." Sherlock grinned happily at him.
"Well Grave's wasn't exactly stupid Sherlock, he probably knew what he was doing, and I reckon people who contemplate suicide often think about it before doing it." John said. Slowly looking down at the ground and stopping his movements.
"I thought I would send a letter to father. I'm enquiring about a case he could possibly be on." Sherlock said.
"How can I calm down now Molly, I need more information, I need more." He kissed her forehead in his excitement and looked up at John who was frozen on his broom in shock from the display of affection Sherlock just shown.
Sherlock walked down into the Great Hall for breakfast, finding his way to the Ravenclaw table, sitting next to a some kid named Anderson. He looked over at the Gryffindor table to see John animatedly talking to his friend Mike, and chomping into his toast with great appreciation. Sherlock gazed over to the Hufflepuff table to see Molly munching on something while still fixated on the anatomy book John had given her, and Sarah looking over at John, trying to get attention somehow. John seemed completely oblivious to her trying to get his attention, as he was now looking over at Sherlock smiling widely. Sherlock could feel that tightness increase in his chest again as John waved him over to join him and Mike for breakfast. Sherlock scowled a little into his chest as he tried to repel the compressed feeling, while walking over to John. John moved over so he could sit in between him and Mike, and reached over for another piece of toast and a sausage.
"These are delicious, John." Sherlock mumbled wit his mouth full.
John reached the owlery and found his owl, Gladstone sleeping on a little perch next to Sherlock's spectacled owl Bee. John smoothed his finger against the soft feather of Gladstone, before rolling up the letter and placing it into the little carry tube on the owls leg. Gladstone gave John's fingers a little nip as John told him to be careful on his trip to Mycroft's. John looked over to little Bee, and scruffled the feathers a little while the bird hooted happily at the affection.
Sherlock shuffled down further on the bed on his side and looked at John’s now tired looking face. He smiled and wrapped an arm around John, trying to pull the stockier man closer. John grizzled slightly and allowed himself to be pulled over.
"Sure, we can go over it through to lunch, and then I have to go for Quidditch practice. You can meet me there again afterwards if you like." John nodded as he let go of Sarah.
"Now you can write to me if you like." John smiled brightly at Sherlock who just looked back in surprise. "Mum. If Sherlock write while I'm at school can you tell him where I am staying, or does the post cover that?"
Electric Indigo
“I’m coming in too.” Sherlock shouted as he stampeded his way after John.
"We don't want to hide it either." John spoke up bravely, forcing Sherlock and Harriet to stick behind him as the larger man approached them.
The colours spun around the room with John and Rosie, who had finally noticed Sherlock standing in the doorway with small smile. Rosie giggled happily as she looked at Sherlock, the colours still glowing against their skin. John smiled over at Sherlock watching as the man now stalked over to the both of them. Sherlock grabbed Rosie out of John’s arms and gave her a quick hug and kiss and set her into her little playpen they had off to the side. Sherlock grabbed John and pulled him into a tight hug. His body lining up perfectly with his.
"John, what are you doing?" Sherlock asked.
"Getting ready for Quidditch practice. Might as well get changed here since you're still prattling on." John said pulling out his quidditch from his trunk.
“You’re not forgiven yet.” John huffed a little laugh.
"I know." John chuckled as he did up the button and fly on Sherlock's trousers.
John looked beside Sherlock in alarm. He had obviously had enough of being insulted and decided to take things into his own hands. Unfortunatly for Sherlock, was that he didn't really know what he was dealing with, and he had no control over any of his magic as well. He wasn't legal to perform anything to defend himself with. John took Sherlock's hand in his hands and pulled him behind him forcefully again, and gave the boy a angry look, mentally telling him to shut up. Mr. Watson grabbed John by the collar, trying to yank him away from Sherlock. Mrs. Watson now had a hold of her ex husbands torso and was trying to pull the man towards the door as hard as she could.
