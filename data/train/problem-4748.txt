"Which would mean no more vibranium bomb casings," said Tony. "But that's still not gonna be the limiting factor, Pete. The biggest hurdle here is—"
"Okay, babe, I think we've gotten all we can from here," Tony said as he entered a few final commands into the workstation. Steve gave a stiff nod, their rather terse conversation with Peter a few hours ago still echoing around in his mind.
"Oh, it is. Trust me," Grandma said wistfully. "Your grandfather Joseph was definitely a heartbreaker. And Steven is as well, as I'm sure your father would agree." She chuckled at Peter's obviously confused expression. "It just means you're extremely good-looking, dear. Nothing more ominous than that."
And then, once he got his own suit perfected, he was going to build one for Steve, no matter how much he tried to protest. Having to listen to his husband fight hand-to-hand against some maniac with a personal vendetta was just too much for Tony to take.
"Well, your instincts are usually pretty spot on when it comes to company matters, so once you decide on something let me know as soon as possible," Pepper said. "If I need to have Beck's computer codes cancelled I don't want to give him any warning. As an R&D Supervisor he's had his hands in a lot of pies, so—"
“Yeah, and you're the smartest kid in it, aren’t you, Pete?” Tony said.  Apparently this Mr Reeves person had been there before.
"Tony, I got it," Steve replied. He tapped his compass, holding his breath as his nanite helmet closed over his head. "I'm ready."
"Clear your head, right?" Bucky finished. His eyebrows knitted together as he eyed Steve over his bottle of superwater. "You've been trying to do that a lot lately, Stevie, but from what we've seen none of what you're doing actually seems to be doing you any good."
"Goddamnit!" Dad exclaimed, slamming his fist down onto the panel as a bright red light began flashing. Peter jumped at the sound, letting out a hard shiver as the blow resonated along the long panel over to where he was standing.
Peter sighed in relief as Ned finally turned to face the front of the bus, sticking in his AirPods. He did feel bad that Ned didn't have a special someone like he did, but at the same time, his third-wheeling was getting really annoying.
"Look, I promise that if you don't end up liking it, I won't make you wear it. But I am almost a hundred percent sure that you will. Yours and Pete's suits are both about as different from mine as you can get, and I'm still making one for him."
Steve cleared his throat, glancing furtively at Tony.  “It’s always a pleasure seeing you, Mr Reeves,” he said.  “Have a wonderful evening.”
"Okay, but… what about?" Peter asked with a frown. "'Cause it looks like you're about ready to pee your pants or something."
Gibberish spilled from Steve's lips as he wove his fingers through Tony's silky hair, his fingertips gently pressing on Tony's scalp as Tony practically swallowed him down. Tony had told Steve not too long after their first time that he loved giving Steve blowjobs, loved to watch Steve's face as he surrendered to the pleasure that he gave him, knowing he was the only person to ever see him that way.
"I am detecting a heartbeat, Captain, but I am currently unable to give a further assessment of Captain Barnes's condition," JARVIS said. "Please be advised, the aircraft landing gear apparatus has been severely damaged, including all backup systems. I will attempt to keep it level during the descent, but I'm afraid the landing will not be smooth."
"I know, Papa," Peter said, just barely able to suppress an eyeroll. Papa had already told him that about a million times. "Ned and I will be waiting for you, just like we talked about."
Heading down the hallway, Steve paused just outside the door to Peter's room, his mind swirling with what Sharon's cryptic words could possibly mean. What sort of mitigating circumstances could exist that would be murky enough to prevent a child from getting a potentially life-saving surgery, especially if he was as bad off as Sharon made it sound?
Even so, as much as Steve liked to contemplate the possible 'what ifs?', all of that would have required him to have been in two places at once, since there was no way in hell he would trade his current life for a theoretical one where he hadn't spent decades encased in ice. Even thinking about it was a moot point, and therefore simply a waste of time. He was constantly telling both Tony and Peter that it did absolutely no good to dwell on things that couldn't be changed, and, despite what his nightmare may have indicated, it was impossible to be in both the past and the present at the same time. Steve had heard Bruce, Tony, and Peter all corroborate that at some point or another, and if three of the smartest people on the entire planet all agreed on something, then Steve was well-inclined to believe them.
"Okay, so, back to the torn sheets," Tony said. He glanced nervously around the massive room, hoping like hell that no one was trying to eavesdrop. "Ahh, you're sure it's safe to talk about this stuff in here?"
"Shit!" Bucky exclaimed as he suddenly swooped up, twisting around to line up his guns. "Why the hell's everyone bullying Stevie today?"
“Oh, really?  It’s not a good look?” Tony asked, wishing with all of his might that he could scream what he was about to say next to the entire world.  “Well, you know what else isn’t a ‘good look for the company’?  Finding out that its CFO is selling weapons under the table to the very same insurgents that Steve’s team was sent in to stop!”  Tony held up his hand, halting Obie’s protest before it could begin.  “And
Or, in this case, after watching one of his best friends get killed by Thanos, along with his brother. Steve had once thought it impossible that he could ever feel any sympathy for Loki after what he'd done during the Battle of New York, but from what Bruce had described, both his and Thor's ends had been brutal.
"Oh, really?" Tony said, his own grin matching Steve's. "Care to share any of those master plans there, master planner?"
"And I know Hank will be extremely grateful for your good graces, Cap—Captain Ameri—Steve—I mean, Captain Rogers, but—"
“So, you don't worry about leaving Peter by himself at night?” he finally asked, nearly kicking himself as soon as the words left his mouth.  Everything he’d seen up to that point pointed to Tony Stark being a pretty attentive—if not overworked—father, and the last thing Steve wanted was to make it sound like he was criticising him.
"I'm sure he thinks that you did, mo grá," Steve said. "And I'm just glad I was there to witness it."
When no further response came, Tony dove down, skimming along the underbelly of the ship as Sam followed at drafting distance, guns at the ready.
"Course we are, buddy," Dad murmured sleepily. "If Papa was too damn stubborn to die when he was frozen in ice for over sixty years, then he'll be too damn stubborn to die now too."
But with this… there literally was no room for error. If he and Bruce were off by even the tiniest fraction of a percent, then the team would lose. That was all there was to it.
"Yeah, well, that was a long time ago, and during wartime, I might add," Uncle James said. "Wartime tends to… speed certain things along."
"A six-year-old who's just had a major, life-threatening operation, Howard," Maria said. "And six isn't the same as sixteen, you know. There is quite a bit of difference."
Justin Hammer had been chasing after Tony's coattails for as long as he could remember, a proverbial thorn in Tony's side from the time he took over as CEO of Stark Industries until the day he shut down his weapons manufacturing. Not only did the man remind Tony way too much of his father, always quoting Howard whenever he found himself in front of a camera, but also had never, ever failed to hide either his jealousy or his disdain for Tony, even going so far as to try and date a few of the women Tony used to run with in the social circles.
"See? 'Cause you're a smart kid," said Uncle Bruce. "Did your dad tell you that I'm gonna be going with Thor and Loki once we finally get this ship ready?"
The first trip had had Steve reliving the day Director Fury and Agent Coulson presented him with the mission to rescue Tony and Peter in Afghanistan. Steve had been only a few days out of the ice then, and still so confused and sad about nearly everything that was happening that he'd been unable to sleep, scared that he would somehow wake up and find himself back in the ice. Tony had felt awful after that one, telling Steve multiple times that he had intended to capture the time where Steve discovered them in the middle of the desert when he'd saved Peter's life, but his calculations had been just slightly off. Steve had brushed him off, telling Tony it wasn't his fault, but it had been more difficult to let go of than Steve had wanted to let on, making his already-touchy mood even more so.
And now that it had, Tony was at a loss as to how he was going to be able to prevent a similar threat. He could only refine the drone stun beams to a certain point, and he couldn't exactly have them firing at every single ant, fly, or mosquito that happened to wander into their range either.
Steve's cheeks immediately flushed and he coughed, prompting Bucky to snort. "What, you don't think so?"
"Pretty much," Steve agreed. "Sam, you and Tony will start at these two towers and work counterclockwise while Nat, Clint, and I take position here, by the entrance. As soon as the towers are clear, Clint'll take out any remaining guards by the entrance and we'll all head inside. Bruce will stay here with the jet on standby, either for a code green or to assist with evac if there's a problem. Any questions?"
It did make Peter wonder how Papa could even afford such a house, as even his Air Corps housing allowance shouldn't have been high enough to cover it, but Peter figured that it probably had something to with how the three of them helped save the planet.
"Um, I s'pose I can ask him, but it was kinda just supposed to be another date for me and Gwen, so—"
"Um… okay," Peter said, frowning. "You know I'm not three years old, right? I can handle you guys standing a few metres away."
Steve smiled at Tony's forethought as he opened the drawer, finding the small bottle Tony had stashed there. For as how often as they were intimate, Steve was still hesitant sometimes to—as Tony liked to put it—fuck him, nervous that he would somehow hurt him, and thankfully Tony didn't push him to do so more often than he felt comfortable.
“Hey, buddy.  It’s time for bed,” Tony murmured as he gently shook his son’s shoulder.  Peter woke with a start, his head snapping up so fast that Tony heard his neck crack.
Steve's full lips curled into a slight smile as he wound his arms around Tony's waist, pulling him down and rolling over so he was half-trapped beneath him.
And if Steve was still alive, if he hadn't somehow drawn the short straw like Tony, then how in the hell was Tony ever going to face him again, knowing that he'd allowed Peter to die right in front of him?
Thank you so much for all of the kudos and kind comments!  I’m so glad you’re enjoying the story!  💖
Steve had shaken his head, pressing a soft kiss to Tony's forehead. "No, it's not because I pitched it to them. It's because it's the right thing to do."
"Bug man?" Scott asked, frowning. "I'm Ant-Man, and ants are not the same as just your average bug. In fact—"
Steve gave his head a hard shake as he retrieved some leftover homemade ravioli and garlic bread from the refrigerator and set about reheating them, including enough for the two of them since he knew Tony was more likely to stop and eat if they could eat together. Steve's stomach gave a rumble as the delicious scents of oregano, Parmesan, and marinara sauce permeated throughout the kitchen, and he smiled as he recalled how much fun he and Peter had preparing the meal the previous night, as if they were just a normal family making and eating dinner together.
Steve thought, stamping down the shame that immediately welled inside his gut. Of course Tony would believe it was worth it, sacrificing one single man in order to save the universe.
"Oh my God, Peter!" Papa sobbed into Peter's hair as he dragged them away from the burning building, finally collapsing about ten metres away. "We thought we were gonna lose you!"
There’s only one thing he is sure of.  Too late to confess his feelings to Tony or not, Steve no longer cares.  If he’s going to die down here in this miserable place, he’d much rather do so with Tony in his arms than three metres away, wallowing in his own misery and guilt.
"I'm fine, Papa. It's hopefully not gonna take that long anyway," Peter said, only a bit impatiently. Steve could tell that he was nervous, with his bouncing legs and his long fingers pleating and unpleating the blankets, and also that he was otherwise trying really hard to hide it.
"In here," Shuri said as two guards opened the doors to the palace into a wide, ornately decorated hallway. "My lab is just around this corner."
"Me either, honey, me either," Dad replied. "But we'll get to the bottom of it. We always do. Whatever it takes."
"Just a few bites, maybe three or four," Peter answered. He looked up into his father's worried eyes, kicking himself for not being stronger. This was not going to help ease his fathers' paranoia at all. "And then I threw it all up."
Steve shushed him with another kiss, sloppy and wet as he kicked off his pants, pleasure shooting through him like bolts of lightning. "You still haven't told me what you want, sweetheart."
A knot rose in Tony's throat, and he tried to pull away, held fast by Steve's strong arm. "I should've figured this out a long time ago, Steve, but I was just too damn arrogant. I never thought—"
Steve grinned, almost involuntarily. He and Sam usually ate breakfast together after their runs, with Tony and Peter joining them most of the time as well before they brought Peter to school. Just another way to ensure that Tony ate something other than coffee every now and then.
"All right, all right, I get it." Tony wound his arms around Steve's neck, eyeing him pointedly. "No more secrets, okay? I'll admit that I've got a couple of my own that I need to divulge too, so you're not the only one, but I mean it. We can't do this if we're gonna be keeping secrets from each other, Steve. I won't do it."
"What the goddamn hell is he doing here?" shrieked Tony. Rage flooded his body as he pointed an accusing finger at the man who in his mind was completely responsible for Peter's deterioration. "This is all his fault, Colonel, so if you think that now's the time for some goddamn reconciliation or something, then you're out of your goddamn mind!"
"Okay, so the moral of the story is, the phrase 'better late than never' absolutely does not apply here, hmm?" said Bucky.
“Yeah, you heard me,” said Tony as he pulled a schematic up on his monitor, something he’d been tinkering with off and on for the last few years.  “And I want whatever drug trials we were involved in restarted ASAP.  Like, yesterday.”
It was on the tip of Steve's tongue to continue to protest, but one look at Tony's pale, drawn face and he decided against it. Tony had needed the routine they had developed while caring for Peter down in Miami, likening it to caring for him as a premature baby after he was born, and Steve knew he was going to need that routine again, for his own peace of mind.
They hadn't been waiting long when Peter felt the wind suddenly pick up near the surface, throwing huge clouds of red dust into the already thick, stale air. A few seconds later the red dust gave way to a bluish-black portal, out of which stepped a giant purple dude.
"Well…" Once again Steve was at a loss for words, and it was more than a little unnerving. He'd never visited a kid before who wasn't immediately impressed with the fact that he was a pilot. Most of the time the kids' mouths dropped open as soon as they laid eyes on his uniform, but judging from Peter's attitude he was almost repulsed by it.
"Aye, Captain," Scott said, offering Steve a salute that he quickly waved away. "Um… so does that mean that I'm—"
was it a sight to behold. As far as Tony was concerned, there was nothing more beautiful in the entire universe than the sight of Steve's gorgeous face twisted in the throes of pleasure.
"Yeah, I can't fault you there," said Peter. "But I wish you could've seen my papa's face when I told him that the theme for this year's Decathlon was the Cold War. You know how much he loves history, so—"
Pressing a kiss to Steve's forehead, Tony tightened his arms around him, begging the various deities floating around up in the heavens to let his man get some decent rest for a change, free from the nightmares that caused his beautiful face to screw into expressions of such unimaginable pain that it nearly caused Tony's heart to crack in two.
"No, no, no, Птер, now's not the time to give up!" cried Bucky from the bed. He tucked Peter to his chest, giving his cheek a light slap to try and keep him conscious. "Stay with me, kiddo, you need to fight this!
"You've got me," Steve answered as he started fumbling with the button on Tony's pants. He was so hard it was almost painful, and his desperation wasn't helping his shaking fingers at all, which once again Tony seemed to notice as he stilled Steve's hand.
books!”  Peter pulled out the box, showing it to Dad as he pulled up to a red light.  “There were only fifteen of ‘em ever made, and that store owner had one of ‘em!”
Steve was so completely awestruck by his beloved that he barely noticed when Colonel Phillips appeared at the front, shooting Peter an affectionate wink. Not even three seconds later Bucky stepped forward, taking his place off of Peter's left-hand side as James stepped up next to Peter's right.
Steve's eyebrows knitted together, and he glanced over at Tony with such anguish in his blue eyes that a lump rose in Tony's throat.
"No, I do not," he said. "If the Battle of New York hadn't happened, that doesn't mean that nothing else would've, so having an already assembled team that can take care of the big threats like that makes a lot of sense."
"Nuh uh. Tonight it's my turn," Tony murmured as his lips closed over Steve's left nipple, gently teasing it with his teeth. Steve groaned, biting down on his lower lip as Tony kissed his way across his chest to his right nipple, nipping and teasing it with his teeth and tongue. Then he lifted his head, his brown eyes shining as he slid his left hand down Steve's abdomen, skirting his fingertips along the waistband of his sleep pants.
"Hey, hon," he began, quickly clearing his throat when his voice caught. "You know, normally in times like this I tend to put my foot in my mouth and say something totally inappropriate, but I'm afraid this time I'm gonna have to disappoint you and just tell you how I'm feeling. So… here goes." He paused, tapping his armoured fingers against his thigh. "The truth of the matter is, I failed. I missed signs, didn't read the room correctly, whatever you wanna call it. I just failed. And because of that, our son, our sweet, precious boy, the boy you brought back to life lying there in the desert sand, is—is gone. And soon enough, I imagine that I'll be gone too, 'cause this ship's pretty much dead in the water up here, so… The blue and green madams and I tried to fix it, but… it was just too beat up. I'm guessing we have less than a day's worth of air left before—well… I know I don't have to tell you what I mean."
"Hmm," said Thanos as he took another step. "This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission."
As soon as the elevator doors closed Tony brought Steve's hand to his lips, kissing his knuckles. "Why don't you go and get changed, babe," he said. "If we're gonna be here for awhile, then… you're gonna want to be more comfortable."
"That," Tony finished. He let out an excited gasp, his body literally buzzing with adrenaline. "Oh gods, Colonel, Steve is really coming home!"
"Tell me what you want, sweetheart," Steve murmured as he trailed kisses all along Tony's cheeks and jaw. "How can I please you?"
"In an emergency, yes, Captain, I can," snapped Dr Strange. "But seeing as how I have had the ability to do so for the better part of a year now and have not made any such attempt, then suffice it to say that I only use these powers when absolutely necessary. Such as right now."
The stupid throat tickle that Peter absolutely despised suddenly roared to life, and he doubled over, clutching his abdomen as he tried to get through it without his heart rate spiking too high. He had a strong feeling that Grandma would report his every single move to his dads, and he didn't need them worrying about him any more than they already did.
"Oh, yeah, I'm sure it does," Gwen replied. "Thank you, though. My dad would've flipped if I would've broken my computer only six weeks into the school year."
“Uh huh,” Peter said.  Taking the backpack’s strap from Tony, Peter turned, preparing to swing it onto his back, just like he always did.
"But it is fucking necessary!" Tony yelled, his heart lurching when Steve jumped back. He knew better than to yell at Steve, or at Peter, for that matter, and yet had been doing so far too often lately. His face fell as he reached for Steve's arm, relieved when Steve didn't try and pull away. "Honey, I'm sorry. You know—you know I'm not upset at you. I'm just—I need to get on top of all of this shit that's been going on lately, and you know I don't believe in coincidences, so—"
"If I have to," answered Peter, letting out a frustrated groan when Gwen rolled her eyes. "Okay, okay, I was joking."
"It won't hurt at all, Uncle Bucky, I promise," Peter added when Bucky hesitated. "And it only takes a second."
A huge thank-you to my awesome betas, allthesinnersandallthesaints and jehbeeeh.  This story wouldn’t have been the same without you! 💜 💜
It took nearly an hour for them to mingle with the various groups assembled across their deck and back lawn, absorbing all of the hugs and well-wishes that they possibly could. Peter was so exhausted by the time he kissed Steve and Tony goodbye and left with James and Carol that Steve highly doubted he would even make it through one movie, much less two. But he supposed that was a good thing. Peter's sleep, which according to Tony had never been particularly good, had grown even worse during his prolonged hospital stay, and despite him now being healed it still wasn't the best. Frequent bad dreams, an irrational fear of the dark that reminded Steve a lot of Tony, and such an overwhelming aversion to silence that it had forced Steve to try and hunt down some kind of noise machine after only their second night in the new house. Unable to find such a device, Steve had actually ended up borrowing a spare heart monitor from the hospital to tuck into the corner of Peter's room until Tony was able to build him an actual noise machine.
“Okay, point taken,” admitted Tony.  “But that still doesn't answer my question as to why you were looking up drug trial info in the first place.”
"Well, if you're sure," Gwen said, her tone suggesting that she thought otherwise. "But don't forget that I'm here if you want to talk about anything. And I'm not trying to be pushy, I just—"
Tony's trembling hand raked through his hair as he pinched himself hard on his side, making sure that he wasn't still dreaming or something.
"I am unsure as to what else we could consider, sir," JARVIS said. "Unless you feel that a possible target might suddenly possess inanimate qualities the very moment it is targeted, then there is nothing else I would recommend."
Peter launched a web in the direction of the oncoming sentry suit, gripping it tight as it yanked him up out of the sand and into the air. The monster immediately lunged for Peter, grabbing onto his ankle as Peter struggled to hold onto the web rope with his sand-slicked hands.
"This will unlock the cell," she said, touching the device to the window. Peter couldn't help but let out an amazed, "Whoa!" as the not-glass immediately began to dissolve right in front of him, creating a hole just large enough for him to get through.
"You are no match for me!" Thanos snarled. "No matter how big your army grows, mine will always be bigger! You have lost!"
“And one of the best ways to not forget history, hmm?” said Mr Reeves.  He handed the World War II history book he was carrying to Peter, who proceeded to ring him up like he’d been working at the store his entire life.  “Far too many wars have been started because people didn't learn from history.”  He glanced up at Steve as Peter handed him his shopping bag.  “Captain Rogers here sure knows what I’m talking ‘bout.”
They arrived at Ma's behind Bucky and Sam, who were already almost done unloading Sam's car. Steve planted another kiss on Peter's head as he slid them both out of the backseat, carrying him up the front steps to where Ma was waiting.
"Shit, baby, you're just too damn sexy for words." Tony cupped Steve's face in one hand, bringing their lips together in another deep kiss as his other hand curled around their cocks, stroking them together. "More?"
Steve’s eyes are swimming with tears as he makes his final lunge for the touchpad, blowing water out of his mouth as he’s carried into the wall.  Then he sucks in a huge lungful of air, death-gripping the gutter with his right hand as he slowly turns to look at the clock, searching for his name.
Silence fell across the classroom, as it usually did whenever a question like that was asked. Not too surprisingly, Gwen raised her hand about three seconds later, clearing her throat.
"I know we'd all appreciate it if you could personally oversee the transfer and arraignment of these prisoners, Chief Stacy, until we know better who else we can trust," Sam said. "I can ask Natasha and Clint if they'll go with you for extra security if you'd like."
Tony thought as a sudden thought popped into his mind, one that caused his heart to start hammering against his ribcage.

"Mmm…" Steve muttered, tossing Bucky a sharp look. He didn't especially enjoy being reminded of how scrawny he'd been as a kid, or of how many times Bucky had had to come to his aid on the school playground.
"Well, that's the thing. Scott said that he didn't get snapped," said Steve. "He said that this whole time he was stuck in something called the Quantum Realm. And that once he got out, he could've sworn that only ten minutes had passed."
“No, honey, you know that’s not true.”  Twisting in his chair, Dad took Papa’s face in his hands.  “Look at me, Steve.  You are strong enough.  Anyone who’s been through what you’ve been through, who was able to look the person responsible for all of this shit in the eye and tell him exactly where he could go is more than strong enough to do this.  I know it, Pete knows it, and Sam and Bucky both know it.  All you need to do is believe it!”
And so Tony sat, carefully clutching Steve's bruised left hand as Helen completed her examination, including blood tests and X-rays of pretty much every single bone in Steve's body. Bucky and Sam, accompanied by two of Happy's guards, had taken Peter to the hospital cafeteria to get something to eat and were then supposed to have him try and get some sleep, so Tony knew that he was in good hands.
"Honey, Bruce is right," Tony said, gently but firmly. "And really, even if the thing malfunctions somehow, the chances of getting so-called lost in there are minimal. I've programmed the GPS with the same frequency as the nanites in the suits, so if someone misses a check-in, all you'd have to do is search out that frequency and you'd be able to find 'em."
"Nope. Shouldn't hurt a bit," Dad said as he came back to the centre of the lab. "JARVIS, whenever you're ready."
Unless Peter was just completely misreading her signals, which he admitted was still a possibility, it definitely seemed like Gwen like-liked him.
“Uh huh.”  Hurrying into the stall, Peter strips off his clothes and pulls on his swimming trunks, grateful that they still fit since they’re his same pair from last summer.  Then he tears his brand-new goggles from their packaging and grabs his towel, draping it across his shoulders as he comes out.
"Honey, please, just stop, okay?" pleaded Tony. "None of that matters anymore. You're back, Pete's okay, O'Brien and his goons are all locked up, and tomorrow we'll get to take Pete home. I'm not sure how else I can frame it, but that all sounds pretty good to me."
"Nah, it can't be just a coincidence," said Sam. "Based on what we know about the Wakandans, this smells more like an assassination attempt to me."
They ended up staying outside until almost 0100, eating and chatting about various things. Steve learned that Tony's favourite colours were red and blue, his favourite animals were polar bears—which helped explain why Peter loved them as well—his favourite television show was a cartoon called Clone Wars but that he hadn't actually watched it in years, that his mother had died when he was sixteen years old after a long illness, and that he'd had a guardian of sorts named Mr Jarvis whom he had loved like a father.
Tony gave a single nod. "I love you too, babe. 'Cept now we have to get cleaned up before we end up getting stuck together."
Out of the corner of his eye, Peter watched as Gwen glanced back at him, whispering a concerned, "Are you okay?" as soon as Ms Warren's back was turned. He gave a quick nod in response, earning one of her
"No!" Steve shrieked as he bolted upright in bed, the tattered remains of the bedsheets clutched in his white-knuckled fists. Air whooshed from his lungs as his eyes flitted around the dimly lit room, trying to regain his bearings, his heart thudding so madly it was as though it was trying to escape from his chest.
"Because the Стиви I know would never back down from a fight, no matter how steep the odds," Bucky said firmly. "Even if they seem insurmountable."
And a huge thank-you to my wonderful betas jehbeeeh and allthesinnersandallthesaints, and to therollingstonys for the incredible moodboard! 💗
As much as Steve had always disliked the bright streetlights that used to shine directly onto his childhood bed in Brooklyn, he had quickly grown used to the light blue glow of Tony's arc reactor once they started sharing a bed. To Steve, the constant blue light emanating from the centre of Tony's chest was comforting, a signal that his beloved fella was alive and well, and there with him.
“I don't know, Nat,” Steve says with a shrug, one that sends pain shooting down his left upper arm.  “I just don't know.”
And he had. Thanks to Tony's ingenuity and determination while being held prisoner, Steve and James had managed to find them in the middle of that massive desert, and with not a moment to spare. In fact, it was Tony's desperate pleas for Peter to stay with him that had finally alerted Steve to their location. Peter had stopped breathing only seconds before, and his blue lips and freezing-cold skin as he laid limply in Tony's arms were Steve's first clues that he was in very serious trouble.
The thought came barrelling towards Peter like a crashing freight train, and he raised his head, barely blinking as his frozen fingers danced across the keyboard for about fifteen minutes straight, inputting the final commands that should override the stupid Ultron thingy for good, and hopefully—
"Shh, buddy, it's gonna be okay," Tony murmured as he carefully guided them over to the couch, whispering reassurances into Peter's curls while he cried himself out.
"So, what you're saying is that HYDRA's probably got Papa in a building that's pretty much invisible?"
Gwen giggled as she leaned closer, so close that their lips were almost touching. "Well, now I'm hoping that we'll get that question in one of our competitions, seeing as how you already know the answer. Nothing like impressing everyone else in the room, right?"
The arrival of their homeroom teacher saved Gwen from having to answer, and Peter shot her a grateful smile as the teacher began reading the morning announcements, reminding the class that school pictures were being taken the following week. Peter realised that he could sometimes seem a bit two-faced when he could lament his family's crazy lifestyle at the same time as he wished he could join in on it more, but thankfully Gwen seemed to understand.
"No, not exactly," Tony muttered under his breath. "But we all know Pete's a far better kid than I ever was, so—"
A split second later Steve yanked back on the throttle and shoved the stick to the left, skimming so closely along the DMZ line that he could've sworn that he saw his Meridian mirror pilot's eyes go wide.
“Uh huh,” Peter said as he stepped over to the workstation.  While Papa was perfectly fine with going ahead with the experiment, the day before he had broken down and asked Dad if he wouldn’t mind sitting with him and holding his hand while it ran.  Of course Dad had agreed, which meant that Peter was now responsible for activating the interface and monitoring Papa’s vital signs, with JARVIS serving as backup.
"Eh, maybe," Tony admitted. "But it's not like anyone else can keep up with us tech-wise, so I wouldn't worry too much about it."
"All Phoenix aircraft prepare for takeoff on my mark, fifteen second intervals," Steve said over the comm. "Takeoff in three… two… one… mark!"
But Thanos didn't answer. He simply raised the gauntlet, which was smoking, like it'd been burned onto his arm, and disappeared through one of his portals. Steve groaned, panting for breath as he pushed himself up to his feet, his legs screaming for mercy as he forced them to bear his weight.
Wordlessly, Tony pecked Steve's lips again and crawled off the bed, grabbing their discarded t-shirts from the floor and handing Steve his. Then he took Steve's hand, leading them down the hallway towards Peter's bedroom.
“Thanks,” Dad said quickly, his eyes never leaving Papa’s face.  “Okay, honey, this is exactly what’s supposed to be happening, yeah?  Sam said that identifying what triggers you is one of the best ways to help with your recovery, so what do you say we blast the hell outta this damn trigger and then get the hell out of here, yeah?”
"Not necessarily, Buck," Steve said. His eyes flicked over to Tony, giving his hand a reassuring squeeze. "It's just better to be on the safe side here. I'm sorry about the short notice."
Tony hadn't thought it possible for Steve to blush any harder, but like he’d been a lot of times lately, he was completely wrong.  Steve’s blue eyes widened to the size of dinner plates as his lower jaw dropped slightly open, his cheeks and forehead so pink he looked like he’d been out in the sun for too long.
"Thanks for the ride," Tony muttered as he slid out of the car. He activated the handlamp, following the bright yellow beam as it led him towards the front door and hoping the noise from the lumbering vehicle wasn't loud enough to wake up his son.
"Clint's fine at the moment," Natasha cut in. "He and Pietro are playing cards in the living room. Or napping. One of the two." She leaned forward, placing a comforting hand on his upper arm. "Do you feel like talking about it?"
"Oh no!" Gwen exclaimed as one of Peter's favourite characters in the whole movie, Chirrut, bravely made his way through a barrage of enemy fire to flip the switch that Bodhi needed to activate the communications array. Peter gave her hand a reassuring squeeze, biting his lip to brace himself for what he knew was coming.
Quill barked out a laugh as he stepped up next to Gamora. "Oh yeah, that's a good one. 'Cause it's completely right. There's not a single ounce of feeling inside this massive, ugly-as-hell body of yours, is there? Or at least not for anything besides genocidal mania!"
He just had to make sure that Papa didn't die in the meantime. So far they could thank the super soldier serum for keeping him alive, but Peter assumed that not even the serum would be enough to keep him alive forever.
"Sounds good," Tony said as he made a couple final adjustments to the GPS unit, fitted onto the left sleeve of his suit. He and Bruce had based a lot of their design of the quantum suits on Scott's Ant-Man suit, but Tony had insisted on completely redesigning the helmet, as the 1890s deep-sea diver look had never done much for him.
The procedure itself had been excruciating; his entire body feeling like it was getting forcibly stretched while being blasted with enough intense radiation to make the Battle of the Continents look like a house party. But once it was over, and he had emerged from the test capsule almost a foot taller and a hundred pounds heavier, Steve was convinced that it'd been worth it.
Gwen stared at him for several heartbeats before finally nodding. "All right. But what're you gonna do when I'm not here to change the subject for you? Are you just gonna avoid thinking about everything for the whole summer?"
Tony had only been in there for about three seconds and he was already claustrophobic, but this wasn't about him.  He needed to find Steve.
looking forward to the inevitable questions that would no doubt lead to yet another lecture from his dads.
"Some of 'em," agreed Tony. "He ended up telling Sam later on that he thought they might've been trigger words or something like that. Words his handlers used when they needed him to go on a new mission."
"You're right, Nat," he added. "But I just… I just don't know if I can rid the world of this. It's just… I just don't think that I can."
"You goddamn sick son of a bitch!" he screamed as he tried to blast one of the guns with one of his shoulder rockets. But the ship seemed to be made out of the same kind of material as Thanos' blade weapon, causing the rocket to bounce harmlessly off.
And if it worked, then the therapeutic possibilities would literally be endless.  Dad had already told Uncle Sam that he would allow his counselling clients access to the device free of charge, and had already begun exploring options for a small-scale mass production, once Dad could make absolutely sure there was no risk of it falling into the wrong hands.
And the pain was so excruciating, far beyond anything that Steve had ever before felt, that he had no idea how Tony was able to remain conscious, much less stay coherent.
"That's very noble of you, Chief Stacy," Steve said quietly. "And I know Peter appreciates your… understanding. None of these events have been his fault, and in fact—"
"Me too." Gwen took his hand as she pushed the exit door open to find Mr Stacy already there, sitting in his unmarked patrol car.
He was everything that was pure and innocent in a world that seemed to be on a lightning-fast track to hell, and Tony…
“Yeah, I bet,” said Ned.  “It’s funny how much you don't realise you use your pinky finger for until you can’t anymore, huh?”
Tony ran his fingers down his goatee, thinking.  “Eh, let’s start out with something simple, hmm?  Something like aspirin?”
With another furtive glance at Steve, Tony stepped over to the computer station where Bruce and Natasha were working, listening as Natasha translated the Russian text.
"Yes, baby," Tony whispered as Steve suddenly sat up, his free hand slipping between them to grip their erections. Tony cried out as pleasure shot through his body like an arrow, forcing himself to open his eyes so he could watch his beautiful husband's face as Steve threw his head back with a loud groan.
"Yeah." Tony got to his feet, carefully tucking the drawing on top of his pile of papers. "It's never gonna leave my sight, honey."
Steve gave his head a quick shake. "I wasn't informed of the exact process by which Dr Erskine arrived at his decision, sir, only that he did."
"Then you've got me," Tony said as he glided his palms up Steve's strong arms to his shoulders. "And it sure as hell beats sleeping in my office, so—"
"You don't need to worry about anything, Pete," he murmured into Peter's hair. "I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, and neither is Papa."
"That's a pretty bold promise, Your Highness," Steve said as they took their seats near the head of the table. "But judging from how you were able to fend off the attack from space, I guess I shouldn't be too surprised."
"And it looks like she did an excellent job of it," Papa said, brushing some non-existent lint from Peter's shoulders. "She taught me how to tie a tie right after I got fitted for my first Air Corps uniform."
"Only three?" Tony said, his left hand clenching into a fist. He had asked for all six of them to be converted knowing that the leadership would then insist on only four, which was all that he really needed anyway. But with only three of the aircraft available it would be a lot more difficult, requiring more alterations to each one of the components than he had initially anticipated, which would then take even more time that Peter didn't have, and—
Bruce tapped the keyboard again, bringing up the picture of a lanky brown-haired and bespectacled man who appeared to be in his late thirties to early forties.
"Yeah," Tony said quickly, huffing when Steve raised an eyebrow. "Yeah, I'm fine. Actually more than fine. Just… trying to take it all in, is all."
"Uhh…" Steve stammered. From what he could tell, T'Challa didn't appear to be upset. More like… curious.
"All right." With a nod at T'Challa, Steve, Thor, and Bucky all made their way towards the palace, pausing about ten metres from where the Soul Stone lay buried beneath the ground's surface. As soon as they were in position, he tapped the star in the middle of his chest, his heart quickening as his suit generated something that resembled a radar image, the location displayed as a bright yellow blinking dot.
"Eh, I wouldn't count on that quite yet," said Sam as he slid into the driver's seat. "From what Colonel Phillips told us, now that they're allowed to actually report the news, the news people probably won't stop hounding you guys for awhile."
Again he was silenced, this time with Tony's lips against his. "Don't be sorry, honey," Tony whispered. "Let's just get this done so we can go home, yeah? I mean, not that you don't look damn good in that uniform, if I do say so myself, but I can say that I've just about had enough of HYDRA's lack of hospitality, and I know Pete misses us."
"Oh, I'm pretty sure this lady's got a crush on him or something," said Ned. "And she thought it was weird that he was just walking around the city like nothing had happened after being gone for months. She thought she would've heard that he was back in town."
"Jesus, Pete, be careful!" Tony admonished, grimacing as Peter shoved at least half of the doughnut into his mouth. "You're gonna choke!"
"A time machine," Steve finished. He shook his head, breathing in deeply. "Scott, I'm sorry. But you have to understand what that sounds like."
Steve watched from the door as Tony walked down the street to his car, not turning away until he had disappeared around the corner.  Then he hurried back to his room, scooping Ashes into his arms as he raced over to the window to catch a glimpse of Stark Tower, beautifully bathed in the light of the full moon.
Steve gave a grim nod. "When it's quiet, yes. I think we'll still be okay while the music's playing though. From my experience the communications equipment doesn't enjoy a lot of background noise."
Phillips glowered, grunting as he received another message. "Looks like it's not only the aircraft," he said as he turned the datapad towards Tony, showing him a live feed of a weapons locker. "Missiles, guns, grenades… all copies of our Langaran tech."
he thought bitterly. If anything he was even more stressed out now than he'd been before they started, not to mention how he was now going to have to order some poor cadet to go and fetch all of the baseballs
"Tony, Peter begged me to tell you about him as soon as possible, and I promised him that I would," Steve said. "I was going to tell you tonight, actually. I was going to offer to drive us both up there so we could visit him together."
"Just… I'm gonna need you to do a cross link with Pete's suit, yeah? If at any time you get the sense that he's in anything remotely resembling mortal danger, you activate the Instant Kill. Got it?"
"Nothing!" Steve said, a bit too emphatically when Sam raised an eyebrow. "We've all been a bit off lately. Losing a teammate tends to do that."
"It's okay, little guy, I'm almost there!" Image Steve said as he arrived one level below where Image Peter was hanging, dropping his shield and raising his arms. "You'll just drop right into my arms, okay?"
Surprisingly, Dad and Papa hadn't given Peter a hard time for wanting to go with Gwen alone. He had prepared an entire argument complete with written rebuttals in case they tried to play one of their whole overprotective-dad cards again, but to Peter's shock, when he finally got up the courage to bring it up at dinner the week before, his dads only had one of their silent, eyebrow-quirking conversations and then told him yes, as long as Peter promised he would be extra careful.
But if Steve had his way, she was going to have to get used to it.  He’d barely been away from Tony for three minutes and he was already craving him.  The smooth touch of his skin, the intoxicating smell of his hair, and the beautiful sound of his laughter.
“Yeah,” said Peter.  “And I’m also thinking we should order from Antonio’s tomorrow night.  I can ask Steve what kind of pasta he likes before you pick us up.”
had made as it sank into the freezing Arctic water, back in 1945.  A sound that despite Steve’s best efforts to purge from his mind, still managed to regularly find its way into his nightmares.
But there was no stopping it. There was nothing to stop the shattering of Peter's heart as if it had been made of porcelain instead of flesh and blood. There was nothing to stop the fact that his actions had managed to kill not only his dads, but his beloved Auntie and Gwen as well.
“You don't need to say it, Tones,” Rhodey said.  “Just… take care of yourself too, all right?  And I’ll see you guys at lunch?”
But not even three seconds after hearing Peter's voice, sick and weak as it was, Rhodey was practically a new person. His shoulders were more relaxed, the lines around his eyes and across his forehead were fainter, and then, only another second later, Tony even heard him laugh for the first time in weeks.
"It's probably 'cause the drug companies are just greedy," Peter added before Steve could come up with anything else. "They know people need the medicines they make in order to live, so they think they can charge whatever they want for 'em."
"Pete, just get him inside!" Tony yelled as Peter pushed backwards, landing onto the hard floor with Strange still in tow. Tony quickly sealed the hole closed, collapsing onto the floor next to Peter once it was done.
I can’t wait to see what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit that kudos button and leave me a comment!  💖
"Yeah, and all that's even weirder when you realise that that very same government just dumped Uncle Bucky like a hot potato, just 'cause he got hurt," grumbled Peter.
Several heartbeats passed while Steve waited for Tony to answer, his bottom lip trembling. He knew that trying to push Tony into answering before he was ready often got him nowhere.
Steve sniffed, swiping at his near-useless eyes. "I'm—I don't know, sweetheart, and I'm—I'm so sorry. I didn't—Tony, I'm—" He lifted his head as the emergency vehicle's siren began to sound, whisking his best friend off to the hospital. Steve had felt him breathe in as he'd carried him out of the aircraft so he knew Bucky was still alive, but he had no way of knowing how badly he was hurt or if he'd ever be able to fly again.
Steve yelps as he leaps up, punching the air just as the swimmer over in lane one finishes his race.  As he splashes back down again, he notices Schmidt frowning as he glares bullets at the clock, like he’s daring it to change or something.
“You’re welcome, bud,” Dad murmured into his hair.  “And how ‘bout we get you a haircut tomorrow, hmm?”
"Oh, shit," Dad muttered. His frightened eyes met Peter's, his unspoken words as loud as if he'd broadcasted them with a megaphone.
"That's what we're trying to tell you guys," Clint said with a sigh. "JARVIS was able to amplify and adjust his speech so we could understand him, but Sam told us to keep him contained until we could talk to you, so we did."
All of HYDRA's anger and hatred, and all of their frustration over not yet achieving their ultimate goal of control through fear, it was all about to be channeled directly at Papa.
"Mmm. Well, that hasn't changed at all," Peter muttered. "Papa's never liked talking about what he was like before he got his serum all that much, only when I ask him something specific, and he never liked for me to see him when he got hurt during missions and was in the hospital. I guess he thinks it makes him look weak, but—"
"No, no, that's fine," Steve answered. He sank down onto a chair, wincing as a sharp pang of guilt pierced his heart. Here was Natasha, who after watching her surrogate daughter fade into ashes was still working her ass off trying to keep everyone else's spirits up, while Steve might be reunited with his missing family in only a few short hours and was still so anxious that he could barely stand.
"Oh, gods," Steve repeated, squeezing his head between his hands. His ma had told him that Howard had worked for the Langaran military's SHIELD division before the Battle of the Continents, but hearing it as a child and seeing it on an official Langaran military database were two completely different things.
"I love you, sweetheart," Steve whispered, his warm breath against Tony's ear sending a shiver down his spine. "It's all gonna be fine."
" he demanded. "You're telling me that my boy's been suffering for over eight years just 'cause his fucking government wanted to keep playing war games? Were we ever gonna have peace in our time?"
Clearing his throat, Tony schooled his face into his usual I-don't-give-a-damn-what-you-think-of-me expression that he always wore when dealing with members of the government or press as he stepped inside the room, blinking against the explosions of camera flashes as he made his way up to the tables set up near the front, with Steve right on his heels. At Rhodey's suggestion, Steve was dressed in his full Army dress uniform, and he cut such an incredibly handsome figure that it had taken nearly all of Tony's self-control earlier that morning to not grab him by his perfectly pressed lapels and drag him back inside their apartment.
Gwen huffed, her shoulders sagging as she picked up her trigonometry textbook. "Yeah, it probably was. Sorry."
"We'll have the Quinjet on standby, so as soon as the signal's received Bruce, Bucky, and I can be on our way," said Sam.
But even with all of his planning and preparation, he'd never dreamed of how absolutely mind-blowing it could actually be until he experienced it. Sex with Tony was always incredible, whether it was a quickie after a mission to help them both wind down enough to sleep or the longer, more languid lovemaking that he preferred, Steve had absolutely no complaints about their sex life.
Arriving back at the main building, Steve bypassed his and Tony's private entrance and headed directly for the gym. James had offered to check in on Tony while Steve was out running, an offer he insisted that Steve take when Steve tried to decline. He didn't like people thinking that he needed help with Tony, even though James and Natasha, and even Bruce, on occasion, had all recommended multiple times that he take a break every now and then.
"Now c'mon, Tones, we've talked about this!" Rhodey had said as he dragged Tony down to the cadets' locker room and shoved him into a shower stall. "I swear, the next time I have to do this I'm gonna put you in a plebe's uniform!"
"All right," Steve said grimly. He found himself wishing yet again that Howard Stark had just left the damn thing down in the ocean, where it had fallen from the
With a heavy sigh, Tony swiped away the hologram.  Now that he knew the machine worked, he had some hard decisions to make.  Keeping the designing part secret was one thing, but there’d be no way he’d be able to keep Obie from finding out about it once he started building them.
A loud knock on the bathroom door startled Peter, nearly causing him to drop the phone. "Peter?" Gwen said through the door. "Are you all right?"
"There ya go, honey," he said as he propped Steve's feet up on his spare pillow. The hospital had cut Steve's flight suit and undersuit from his body while they'd worked on him, so he was now dressed in the same kind of scrubs worn by most of the medical personnel. "I'm gonna go get you something to eat now, okay? I'll be right back."
Peter's left arm was tingling with pins and needles as he snuck another glance up at the clock, his heart quickening when he saw that he only had forty-five seconds left before the bell rang. His right foot started tapping on its own volition as he counted down the rest of the seconds, bracing himself for the shrill ring of the bell.
Steve dug the pads of his fingers into Tony's scalp, smiling when Tony let out a soft moan. "Howard knew how smart you are, sweetheart, I'm sure of it."
Something about the tone of Papa's voice, the way it quivered ever-so-slightly, was eerie enough to send an ice-cold shiver down Peter's spine, the shiver he'd come to recognise as his Spider Sense. Something was badly wrong.
"Oh, yeah," Rogers replied. "I'm—I mean, I'm not usually out wandering around the hallways after blackout, but—your office still has lights?"
“Tony, I can’t believe that incredible young man calls me ‘Papa’,” Steve said as Peter and Bucky began shadowboxing, causing Sam to burst out laughing.  “How in the hell did I get so lucky?”
"Actually, Uncle Bruce is like Papa and Uncle Bucky," Peter muttered as they headed for his locker. "Enhanced after the fact."
"Yeah, I might've noticed. Kinda hard not to when you're tearing the sheets to shreds every other night."
"Okay, Pete, let's just try and stay on task here, yeah?" Tony said with a sigh. "Now, as I was saying, we only need to get the gauntlet off, and I think between all of us, we should be able to—"
"Pretty sure we've got bigger things to worry about at the moment!" Peter said as he swung back across the street. "What's this guy's problem?"
"Ahh…" Tony trailed off as his heart began to quicken. It sure seemed like they were ready. They had the quantum suits, the compass—
"No! Don't give me the same stupid excuses that you always do just 'cause you guys are scared! I'm not a child—!"
"Except your healing factor is not due to a mutation, correct?" Shuri asked as she placed a third cloth, this time covering Tony's neck and right cheek. "You were… made?"
Tony gave a curt nod as the various senators disappeared from his monitor, rolling his eyes once the screen finally went black.
Tony tipped his forehead onto Steve's chest, moaning softly when Steve's palms glided up his back. "Hell no, we're not. The absolute last thing we need is for Senator Davis to start poking that pointy nose of his where it don't belong again, and that's exactly what would happen if Spider-Man suddenly reappeared after vanishing for months."
"Sir, I am afraid this data is being protected by several layers of high-level encryption that have yet to be identified."
The buzz of his phone in his pocket startled Steve so badly that he let out a soft grunt, pressing one palm to his chest as he retrieved both it and his list.  The buzz was just another text, one that he ignored like he had all of the others, but now that Tony’s visit was over, he needed to cross it off the list before he could move on to the next item.  He picked up the pencil he kept next to the register, biting down on his bottom lip as he drew a straight line through his hastily scribbled words.
“Mmph!” Steve hissed through his clenched teeth as he squeezed his eyes closed, pulling up the mental image he’d just spent the last hour sketching.  Imagining the plushness of Tony’s lips as he kissed them, the softness of his olive-toned skin as it slid against his own, and the way his lithe body would fit perfectly into Steve’s arms.
Peter watched as the patrol car drove away before climbing into the backseat of the truck grinning like a fool, which he realised a few seconds too late when Dad shot him a questioning eyebrow.
Another series of machine-gun blasts drowns out JARVIS’s response, nearly sending Steve’s heart into his throat at their intensity.  He grits his teeth, taking out three more soldiers with his emergency pistol before jumping from the jeep, rolling to a landing on the frozen forest ground.
"I said, it's not unfair," Peter repeated. "Papa didn't ask to be frozen like he was. He thought he was gonna die when he crashed that plane."
The remainder of the presentation passed rather quickly, the pilots maintaining their rapturous attention as Tony ran through the rest of the X-302's systems, the anticipation inside the classroom so ripe that Tony could practically smell it.
“I’m sure whatever configuration of launch calculus you come up with will work out just fine, Barton,” Tony replies.  “Just so long as the guards keep dropping.”
"Peter!" another voice suddenly cried, the panicked shriek raising all of the hair on the back of Peter's neck. "Peter, help me!"
"Shh, buddy, I've got you," Dad murmured as he ran his fingers through Peter's hair. "I'm not gonna lie to you and say that everything's gonna be fine, 'cause those HYDRA creeps are a bunch of pretty sadistic motherfuckers, but I also know that there's no way in hell that Papa's just gonna sit there and take it either."
Tony ran his finger across his chin as he studied the blue hologram hovering in midair in front of him, walking slowly around it as he checked for any holes or other errors. After being awoken during the night by yet another nightmare, he'd made a sort of breakthrough in his thought process for the design, and was very eager to see if it was working.
"Thanks, Papa," Peter said, his eyes going wide as they took Papa in. Dad had told Peter so many times how hot he thought Papa looked in his uniform, and Peter did have to admit that Papa was very handsome in it.
"Look," Peter interrupted, suppressing another shiver. It was time to try a different approach. "Do you like to read? Books? Before they brought you here, did you ever like to read books?"
"On your left!" Steve snapped as he passed a group of cadets out for their morning jog, led by their squadron commander. Sam, his usual running buddy, had bugged out on him three laps ago after Steve refused to slow down to a more human-friendly pace. After getting a less-than-helpful response to his inquiry as to what was wrong, Sam had informed Steve that he didn't particularly feel like barfing up his lungs that morning and would see him at their pre-flight briefing.
He tightened his arms around Tony's pillow, wishing so badly that it was Tony instead, and was then immediately wracked with guilt at the very thought. Because he knew exactly why Tony wasn't in the bed with him.
"Right," said Steve, nodding towards Peter. "Dad and I need to discuss something for a second, little guy, okay? We'll be right back."
"Really," Steve answered as he pressed a kiss to Tony's scalp. "It's one of the first things I noticed about you."
And, while Gwen had assured him that she wasn't going to break up with him because of it, he still couldn't shake the fear that she would fall in love with someone else while she was over there, someone with a cooler accent than his subtle New York drawl, and that would be it for him.
Now, though, they were gone, somewhere out in the vastness of space. And all he had left was their picture.
"Huh?" replied Quill, looking up from where he and Gamora were huddled together a few metres away. "What'd you say, Mr Man?"
Steve’s smile widened even more, sending another bolt of heat down Tony’s spine.  “Well, then I’m definitely looking forward to it.”
At Steve's suggestion, the team had taken almost the entire summer off to rest and recuperate. He'd realised once he got home from Georgia that they had been going nearly non-stop for almost four years, and with most of the former HYDRA agents currently on trial and the rest being tracked down by SHIELD, Steve finally felt that they could take a very well-deserved break.
Especially while being tailed with a security regimen that would rival that of any President or other head of state’s child.
After watching Natasha pad back to her own area, Steve boots up his computer and checks his calendar.  He only has one meeting scheduled for 2pm, to go over the latest equipment requisition with the basketball coaches, and then his blocked-off time between five and seven for Peter’s swimming practise, leaving him the rest of the day to finalise a couple more grant applications and put together Peter’s workouts for the rest of the week.
"Nope, I've been standing here the whole time," Peter said. He gave Tony a rather eager smile. "Are you really gonna build one of those nanotech suits for me?"
He likely would've been able to free Steve from the ice eventually, but would Steve have survived? Especially if he'd had to get Peter indoors first?
Tony nodded, pulling off his glasses so he could tuck in closer. "Steve, you just gotta promise me that you'll be careful, okay? After what happened today I have to admit that I'm starting to get a lot more twitchy about things, and now with Rhodey saying that you've gotta meet with the general, I'm just—"
“It appears that the STRIKE team chain of command ends with Agent Rumlow, sir,” JARVIS finally said.
"It's gonna get really bright now, Tony," Steve warned, his arms pebbling with goosebumps as the familiar whirring noise of the radiation machine began its thundering crescendo. As the basement grew brighter he attempted to cover Tony's eyes, only for his hand to be batted away.
So he simply tightened his arms around his husband, whispering another, "I love you," into Tony's ear and closing his eyes as Tony threw his leg across Steve's lap and tucked his head under his chin.
"Huh?" Blaster Guy cried, gaping at Green Lady like she'd just asked him to detach one of his limbs. "Don't tell me you actually believe these assholes?"
"Did you live with your mom at your old house?" the boy—Simon, apparently—asked. "Is that why you moved?"
Scott bobbed his head. "Um… okay. So, then, T-Tony, I'm really sorry. I'm an engineer, but I still don't understand much of anything about this stuff. Hank just said that as long as I didn't mess too much with the regulator on the suit that I'd be fine, so…"
Settling on one of his nicer t-shirts and a pair of dark grey pants, Tony grabbed some clean underwear and headed towards the bathroom he shared with Peter. His throat tightened as his eyes landed on Peter's shampoo bottle sitting on the shelf in the shower, tipped over onto its side like it always was. His washcloth was still there too, draped over the faucet, and the rubber duck he'd had since he was three, sitting just where he'd left it.
A lump rose in Peter's throat, and he grabbed his milk, draining the rest of the carton in three large gulps as he tried to come up with a response that didn't sound too snarky. Peter had heard plenty about survivor's guilt from not only Papa, but Uncle James and Uncle Sam as well, so he knew it was a real, legitimate thing, but it still irritated him that someone could be so quick to judge his papa for something that wasn't his fault and that he had no control over.
“Yeah, but I’m not the only one who thinks you need to take it easier!” insisted Peter.  “Uncle James says so too.  And so does Pepper, and Happy, and—”
"How in the hell did you get back up?" he asked as he patted his shirt and pants pockets, looking for the damn comm device. He'd been right in the middle of another test when he'd apparently dropped off, but as far as he knew nothing had happened in the meantime, so—
Watching them go, T'Challa turned his attention back to Tony and Steve. "Have no fear for your son's safety here, gentlemen," he said. "You have my solemn promise that no harm will come to any of you while you're within our borders."
Steve became so engrossed in Peter's artwork and their conversation that it didn't even occur to him to check the time until Sharon knocked on the door with Peter's evening meal.
The twins had also told Peter and the rest of the team that after their father was killed, HYDRA burned his body rather than risk having him fall into someone else's hands for possible study. Following the massive battle against Justin Hammer's HYDRA suits, Gwen's father had been crucial in helping the twins locate the area of the bunker where their father had been killed, allowing them to gather up some of his ashes to take with them.
He stopped short when Uncle Bucky's face drained of colour. "Holy shit, kiddo," he whispered. "So you're saying that Meridia, or whoever the hell is in charge of Meridia, now has access to all of the Phoenix satellites?"
“Ah, sorry, but you're gonna have to do a lot better than that,” snapped Tony.  “If this place is as unstable as you say, then who’s to say that this agent’s even still yours?”
"Captain, Mr Stark," he said, glancing furtively at his partner who was still waiting for their order. "Gwen told me what's been going on, and I've been following along with some of the senate debates. I just wanted you to know that my family is here if you ever need anything. Even if it's just to pick Peter up from school, all you need to do is ask."
For a second or three, Tony was very tempted to lie to his son, something he had sworn he would never, ever do.
was going to be interesting. Using the portable repulsors to fly had sounded kinda fun when he'd first thought of it, but now that he was getting close to actually doing it, he was more than a little nervous.
"Another new suit?" Steve said as they exited the lab. "Tony, none of my uniforms are even close to being worn out, and—"
"You know I will, mo grá," Steve said with a relieved smile. He quickly popped the rest of his croissant into his mouth and got to his feet, reaching for Tony's hand. "Shall we?"
As soon as he was alone Steve dropped his chin to his chest, gripping his head between his hands. He had been trying to hide it from his friends, but Riley's sudden death seven days ago had thrown him for a pretty big loop, one that he hadn't yet managed to shake. It had been just another routine mission, scouting the skies above Langara in the new X-301 aircrafts with Sam and Riley, something they had all done too many times to count, when, while testing out the banking arc, Riley had pulled back just a split-second too late, ending up just a hair over the hardline DMZ.
"I know that!" Peter yelped. He shot to his feet, fighting the urge to stomp as he started to pace around Gwen's tiny bedroom. "But then my papa goes to Africa and gets attacked by one of the very same assholes who just spent an entire month torturing him, and as he's attacking him, he starts taunting him by saying that I'm just some scrawny kid who's afraid of my own shadow. But I'm
that. But as much as it sucks, we've known for awhile now that HYDRA's known about Pete since way back in Afghanistan."
"Do it now!" Carol yelled as she landed next to Peter, taking his free hand between both of her own, her entire body glowing in blue and yellow. "Stark, do it now!"
Tony scrubbed his palm down his face as he poured himself a fresh cup of coffee.  Knowing Obie, he’d probably forget about the printers by the end of the day, aided by a few double-shots of Scotch and the fact that they weren’t generating any active revenue.
The last several months, however, were a very different story. For even when Tony wasn't in one of his deep, incapacitating depressive moods, he still hadn't shown any interest in doing anything beyond cuddling.
"Oh yeah, I knew I recognised you!" the guy exclaimed. He leaned closer, eyeing Peter conspiratorially. "So, how cool was it that Iron Man got to ride on that spaceship? Was he really fighting more of those badass aliens up there? And what about Cap? I heard that he went up against the biggest alien of 'em all!"
And he had to stay awake, for Tony's sake. He had to make sure that when Tony woke up, Steve was the first person he saw.
"I'm not trying to babysit you," Steve cut in. "I just… don't want you to be alone right now, okay?"
And when they woke up the next morning, sticky and sweaty and still curled up together, Steve found that aside from some slight residual soreness, most of his pain was gone.
, Peter thought as he drifted off, only to be awakened three seconds later—or so it seemed—by his phone alarm, the sun barely visible through the fog in the distance. It was time to catch his boat.
"I'm fine too, as you can see. No permanent harm done," he said. "And, if it's all the same to you, I've just about had enough with the three of us taking turns getting hurt." He hadn't quite thought about it like that before, but there hadn't been a single one of their more epic battles where at least one of them wasn't either presumed dead or seriously injured, and that definitely needed to stop.
"You're gonna stay with me for the rest of my life, and you're gonna love me," Tony said as he began trailing kisses all along Steve's neck and chest while Steve fumbled to turn on the shower. Steve caught his wrists in his hands, stopping him just long enough to get them inside, backing Tony up against the tiled wall.
“Yes,” answered Fury.  “The main manifesto of HYDRA is to induce chaos, and there aren’t many places that have seen more chaos than that area.”
“Why?” he asked, before he could stop himself.  In the grand scheme of things Steve knew the ‘why’ didn't matter at all, but he felt he at least deserved an explanation.
he exclaimed as he squinted up at the guy, who appeared about as stunned as Tony felt. "What the hell are you made from, iron?"
"It's all right, Captain, we can do the surgery without a general anaesthetic," Helen said. "It might take all the lidocaine in the entire state of Georgia to keep you numbed up, but I'll make sure that Dr Wright is aware of the Captain's metabolic requirements."
There was a loud growl as Fake Man got to its feet, its armour scratched and dented where it'd hit the floor.
Tony huffed, tearing his gaze away from his husband's piercing blue eyes, shining like the dotted lights in the distant skyscrapers. "Well… yeah, I s'pose I could have, but after I upgraded the locator chips, I just figured that I may as well upgrade your suit too, 'cause it gets to the point where it's just easier to make a whole new one. So I changed up the Kevlar a bit and made a few other changes that I think you'll enjoy."
Natasha immediately planted her feet and launched a Widow's Bite from each wrist, catching the creature on its midsection and causing a brief hole to form.
Steve yelped as he whirled on the doctor. "You mean you can open one of those portals directly into my
"Um…" he said, clearing his throat. "My Uncle James is here, actually they both are, so… I need to get going."
He also had a strong feeling that Mrs Leeds and her friends weren't the only one spreading goofy conspiracy theories around. The press conference Papa and the rest of the team had held a few days ago had been so brief and vague that it had probably raised a lot more questions than it had answered, and the news people had been having a field day ever since. Peter understood why they had to keep things a secret, the general public just wasn't ready to hear about giant purple aliens trying to snap away half of all life in the universe, but… yeesh.
Tears welled in Steve's burning eyes, rolling down his cheeks before he even realised they were there. "But—but… fathers are supposed to be strong, and—"
Gathering up his papers, Tony pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose and exited the office, making his way over to the hangar. He purposely averted his eyes as he headed for the simulator section, where he found Carol and Sam Wilson waiting for him.
Steve gave an emphatic nod. "Absolutely. I love him, Buck, but he told me that he needed time to think and I need to respect that."
"But you said that shouldn't be a problem," said Phillips. "That the new power sources wouldn't need to be swapped out."
"Like that, babe?" he whispered as he pressed another kiss to Steve's hipbone and climbed back up his body, feeling quite self-satisfied. Steve huffed as he curled his arms around Tony and rolled them over, dipping his head to kiss him.
Dad scoffed. "Yeah, well, pardon me if I don't exactly trust Fury and his vetting process too much at the moment. Especially since he just sent Steve and the others right into another fucking ambush." He winced, glancing at Peter in the rearview mirror. "Sorry, bud."
Tony huffed, slumping back against the couch and crossing his arms. "This isn't how I meant to tell you."
There were just far too many unknowns. Steve had never liked having to strategise without all of the variables, as it just left behind too many ways that things could go wrong. Battles by their very existence were already barely-controlled chaos, so any sense of control that Steve could add through his strategising would only help keep the chaos to a minimum.
Before Obie could say anything else, Tony hung up the phone, grabbing his glasses and sweeping out of the room before he could call back.  It was amazing how easily Obie could completely obliterate the good mood he’d been in with only a few choice sentences.
"It's not unfair," Peter muttered, so softly that he was surprised that Flash even heard him. Flash blinked, chewing another mouthful of pizza as he leaned closer.
"Yes, I'm well aware of how that came about, Captain," said Davis, not missing a beat. "And as to the question of adding more members—"
"Yeah, Sam, we're good," answered Steve. He took Sam's outstretched hand, hoisting himself up to his feet as Thor and Natasha came into view. "Nat, you still got that biological?"
“Yes,” Steve whispered.  “Sam Wilson.  He works at the VA On the Mall in D.C., and he helps… people like me.”
Not that he should've expected otherwise. Unlike Tony, Peter still believed there was something resembling a human soul buried somewhere down deep inside Howard's aging body, but then again, Peter had an uncanny ability to sniff out the good in just about anyone.
"Well, I hope you're right." Steve got to his feet and placed his hand on Peter's shoulder, squeezing it gently. "You try to get some good rest tonight, okay?"
Peter did wonder if Papa and Dad realised yet that by telling him that much, they had just handed him his strongest argument for officially joining the team. Especially since Dad had named Peter an Avenger while still on the ship.
If Tony had his way, he would probably wrap both him and Peter in suits of armour anytime they left the house. Or were out of his sight.
A knot rose in Steve's throat at the mention of Bucky. He and Tony had just visited him at the hospital the previous night, and while he was thankfully in a bit less pain than he'd been the day before, Sam had told them that the shock of losing his arm still hadn't fully sunk in.
He had no doubt, though, that if Mr Jarvis were still alive, he would do whatever he could to help them. While he had never been too overtly vocal about his dissatisfaction with the Langaran military government—because most intelligent adults knew that anything they said could be used as ammunition for a possible sedition arrest—Tony had been able to glean enough from what Mr Jarvis did say to know exactly how he'd felt about it.
"Ah huh," Steve said, glancing at the clock which read 0327. "And how much coffee has he had since then?"
Tony's gorgeous brown eyes twinkled as he pretended to ponder. "Well, now I gotta think a minute here, 'cause that's a tough one, you talking about whisking my son and me off to some sunny Mediterranean paradise. But since you're so damn cute and all, I s'pose I'll just have to get over myself and allow you to do it."
Not that they likely would've done it if he'd asked anyway, but it still might have helped to ease some of his guilt.
"This has to be it!" Peter croaked past his dry throat. He knew that HYDRA had stolen the designs to Dad's Iron Legion, so if they had managed to build some of their own using the Chitauri tech, then…
"There's not much about Earth that we do understand," said Gamora. "Only that Thanos was intent on defeating the Avengers."
Peter’s cheeks flush hot as the assistant smiles and stands to her feet, indicating for them to follow her.  “Of course.  Mr Rogers is waiting for you both in the conference room.”
Little Steve murmured as he checked the bright red handwritten price stickers in the upper right-hand corners. The sketchbook was five cents and the pencils were ten, which meant that he could buy—
"Well, if there was one database like that, then who's to say there wasn't more than one?" said Peter. "And if the bad guys had access to whatever Dad had on his computer, then they could've programmed some command into JARVIS to tell him to turn off as soon as Papa activated the tesseract."
"How's Тони doing?" asked Bucky as they stepped into the guests' dining hall, which was set up like a huge buffet. Steve's mouth was watering before he even picked up a plate, the sights and smells of the spiced meats, sweet pastries, and colourful fruits causing his stomach to go into overdrive.
And when it was over, when the last of their combined cries of pleasure had bounced off the walls of the room and they had managed to drag themselves into the tiny bathroom to clean up, they lay back down on the bed, curling up together under the sheets with Tony's arm draped across Steve's waist and his chest pressed up against Steve's back. Most of the time it was the other way around, with Steve being the "big spoon", as Tony liked to call it. But on this night Tony just knew that it needed to be different, that it was Steve who needed to be held while they slept. That he needed to feel Tony pressed up against him, infusing him with the strength that he felt he was lacking.
"Yeah, a bit." Hill jerked her head in the direction of an armoured truck parked off to the side, leading them inside and tapping a large viewscreen, on which a glowing yellow map appeared. "From what we've been able to discern based on forensic evidence, this attack was not designed to take out the Wakandan king. In fact, we're now doubtful that the perpetrators even knew he was here."
"Babe?" he said, jerking his head towards the tablet in Steve's gloved hand. "What're we looking at here?"
Which made the possibility of her leaving him next summer to go to England seem all that much worse.
have the operation that he so desperately needed, the very operation he should've had way back when the doctors first discovered the problems with his heart. Problems that had grown steadily worse with every single one of his growth spurts.
Tony frowned. Steve was right, of course, but leave it to Steve to worry about him when he was the one all banged up. Tony could afford to go without food for a day, and before Steve he often had, getting so wrapped up in his work that he'd literally forget to eat. But he'd already witnessed what could happen when Steve tried to go too long without eating, and that wasn't anything that Tony needed to see again.
"Thank you," Peter said with a gulp as he slid into the chair at Mr Stacy's left. He awkwardly cleared his throat, taking the dishes of grilled fish and seasoned green beans as they were passed to him and very much aware that his face was likely the colour of an overripe tomato. Again.
I swear this ass of yours was sculpted by those ancient Asgardian gods Thor's always going on about."
"No, it's not," Uncle Bucky said, so softly that Peter barely heard him. He let out a heavy sigh, a single tear rolling down his right cheek that he quickly swiped away. "Sam's the best of the best. There's no way I could do better than him."
"No!" Peter cried as he swooped down from his perch, launching his webs at Thanos' face. The webs landed across Thanos' eyes, disorientating him enough to allow Peter to kick him hard in the head as he swung across. A second later Drax and Gamora jumped from their hiding places, Gamora drop-kicking Thanos in the head as Drax struck him hard in the legs.
Tony gave him a shrug, one of those nonchalant shrugs he often gave whenever Steve gave him a compliment. "It's for Pete too, babe, so don't be trying to give me more credit than I deserve."
What had started as a cockamaime way to bribe the government into saving Peter's life, Project Phoenix had somehow managed to transform not only their planet, but Tony's entire life as well.
Steve frowned, and Tony had to bite down on his tongue to keep from laughing. This whole thing was starting to read like something that Peter and Ned would make up during their Minecraft games.
"Yeah, we'll see," Tony muttered, rolling his eyes when Steve's worry wrinkle immediately sprang into action. "Sorry, hon. It's kinda like a reflex."
"Yeah, hon, I know." Tony winked as he tapped the device on his wrist, activating his helmet. "I'll see ya soon."
"What the—?" he stammered as his belly gave a violent swoop. Across the front of the woman's uniform was the very same symbol displayed on the pager. "Who are—who are—?"
"Very good, sir. Oh, and there is also a message from Senator Davis, wishing to inform you that the final Damage Control convoy departed from Washington D.C. as scheduled."
"He is," answered Steve. "Shuri said we should be able to go home tomorrow, as long as nothing weird happens."
The cave. The Malibu house bombing. Project Insight. The streets of Queens. The Miami bunker. The Compound's lake. The movie theatre. The invisible HYDRA bunker.
"Um, with all due respect," Scott said, raising his hand. "Don't you guys think I should go first? Since I'm the only one who's been in there before?"
"Is he?" Steve whispered, so softly it was barely audible, his eyes flicking up towards Peter. "Are you sure he's—?"
But the man only coughed again, sending a geyser of the slimy fluid shooting out of his mouth and splashing down onto the blanket. Steve shrank back as Tony leaned closer, almost right into the man's face.
"You know that I do," Steve said softly. "But I'm an adult, Tony, and Peter isn't. And he shouldn't have to be worrying about his father so much."
It wasn't until three days later, in the middle of watching his favourite cartoon show, that Tony discovered the truth.
Which Steve was also trying to do, even though it was harder than hell. His serum-enhanced libido aside, Steve desired Tony as much now—even more so, actually—as he did when they first met, and the thought that maybe Tony didn't desire him back anymore… well…
“Ah, seventy-two inches, according to my last physical,” replies Steve.  It was on the tip of his tongue to say sixty-four.
It took nearly all of Steve's strength to unwind his arms from around Tony, holding onto his hand until the last possible second. His heart was in his throat as he watched Tony make his way towards the observation level, turning to wink at him just before disappearing around the corner.
"That kid of yours is gonna turn out to be even more sickeningly sweet than the two of you, isn't he," Clint grumbled as he rolled his eyes. "I should've known."
“And it was ‘cause of an explosion, right?” Peter asked.  “The building his team was in was destroyed in an explosion?”
With a final kiss to the leaking tip of Tony's cock, Steve pulled his fingers out and reached for a spare pillow, sliding it under Tony's hips. Then he crawled up over him, fusing their mouths together as he lined himself up and pushed inside, the two of them groaning in unison once he was fully sheathed.
"Well… at least there's that," Tony grumbled. "Look, Pete, I don't know what you and Grandpa have talked about and honestly I don't really want to know. But if he tries to tell you anything negative or doomsday about your… condition, then I want you to tell me about it right away. Is that clear?"
the entire area lit up by a single beam of yellow so bright that everyone in the Control Room yelped in pain.
.  The bone-chilling, blood-freezing, and lung-seizing kind that Steve had experienced only twice before.  Once during the bout of pneumonia he’d had when he was ten, when his fever climbed to over forty-one Celsius and his teeth chattered so hard that he chipped one of his incisors, and the second time when he’d slipped into the frigid water of the Arctic, trapped under three hundred tonnes of massive airplane.
But before Tony could even answer, the water level in the lake suddenly dropped about a metre as the fog began to rise straight off the surface, swirling counterclockwise as it coalesced into what could only be described as some kind of water monster. Once it was fully formed the creature let out a roar, one so loud that Steve was forced to close his eyes against the pain in his frozen ears.
"Captain Rogers is ready for takeoff in Phoenix One," he said into the comm as he fired up his engines. "Call it out, A-shift."
"Check on the calendar of Quentin Beck, one of the R&D supervisors. I need to set up a one-on-one with him regarding his holographic proposal."
"I don't—I don't believe him," grunted Tony as he struggled to break free from Steve's ironclad grasp. "Steve, let go of me, goddamnit! I need—I need—"
"And once we do, I've got some friends in the FBI who are ready to help," said Stacy. "As well as myself."
"Good." Uncle Bucky got to his feet, patting Peter on the top of his head. "Try not to worry too much, okay, kiddo? We're not gonna let Stevie die up there without a fight. I promise."
Unlike Papa, Dad was pretty good at hiding his emotions. But even with his mask firmly in place, Peter could still see right through him.
But since he’d actually dozed off in the shower more than a few times recently, he forced himself to resist the temptation.  Maybe he could close his office door and catch a catnap after he showed Obie the simulation results.
Adjusting the backpack strap on his right shoulder, Steve tightens his grip on the bar as the train lurches forward, rumbling on towards its next stop.  Empire State is ten stops away from his tiny Brooklyn studio, but thirteen stops away from the physical therapy centre, which means by the time Steve exits the train, the pain in his shoulder has ramped up from a dull ache to a sharp, stabbing throb, prompting him to reach for the bottle of ibuprofen he keeps in his backpack as soon as he steps out onto the street.  He frowns as he sees that there's only enough left for two or three more doses, groaning at the thought of having to make yet another trip to the pharmacy in the next day or so.
"Nick Fury," Davis repeated. "And may I ask how it was that Mr Fury had enough influence with my predecessors to demand your involvement in this agency?"
Tony bit his lip, taking Steve's bandaged hand in his own. "Our government won't go for it. We've tried—Colonel Phillips and I—we've tried so hard over the last six months or so to convince them, and they just won't. They won't consider any options that would lead to peace unless it's an unconditional surrender from the enemy."
“I know it seems real, honey, but I promise you, it’s not,” said Dad.  “You're right here.  You're with me and Pete, and we love you so damn much, honey.  You are
“Has anyone ever told you how incredible you are?” he asked.  “‘Cause I gotta say, that was pretty damn amazing.”
"Pietro's with Clint on the jet, Steve," she whispered as her eyes filled with tears. "But Wanda, she's—she's—"
With a heavy sigh, Tony climbed out of the car and headed towards the house, hoping that at least Howard would be passed out or something so Tony wouldn't feel compelled to acknowledge him. He'd only decided to brave going home in the first place because he didn't feel like going on his first date in almost a decade wearing a two-day-old cadet's uniform. Such a gorgeous man as Steve Rogers deserved for Tony to at least smell like he hadn't been living in his tiny office for the past two weeks.
don't!" Steve pleaded, his blue eyes so filled with worry that it stole Tony's breath. "You need to take care of Peter, okay? Make sure he's safe."
It was something that Tony could at least understand, having so much experience with it himself, but that still didn't mean it was the truth.
Gwen let out a sigh, brushing her thumb across Peter's knuckles. "Well, I guess it's time to eat now."
So, a piece of random trivia:  spiders don’t actually have compound vision like most insects, instead they have eight separate eyes.  Since Peter is still mostly human with some spider DNA, it’s always been my headcanon that his vision when unfocused tends to warp into something resembling compound vision, which is exactly how he was able to “read” the HYDRA documents.  😎
“It’s just some father who wants to meet with me about coaching his kid in swimming,” Steve says quickly.  “Nothing more than that.”
"That's it, sweetheart," he said as Tony's mouth dropped open, his grip on Steve's fingers tightening. "God, you're so beautiful, I wanna see you come for me!"
"Ohh," Peter said, wincing. The thought of his beloved Papa being even remotely connected to that horrible general was almost too much. "Um… if it's any consolation, I'm really glad that's not who you married."
Back when all they'd had to worry about were deciphering Peter's emerging enhancements, and the occasional tabloid cover.
"Steve?" Tony asked, his eyebrows knitting together. "Hon, I gotta say that you're starting to freak me out a bit here. What's going on?"
"Yes," Shuri said firmly as they arrived inside her lab, which to Steve seemed more like some futuristic movie set than a workspace. She quickly directed Steve to lay Tony down on a table, one which Steve was only semi-shocked to see was suspended in mid air. "He will live as long as I work quickly."
"Yes, mo grá, I know that," Steve said, way too evenly for Tony's taste. "But there are plenty of other ways we can find out what we want to find out that don't include you having to talk to him."
"Now, now, now, I thought we'd decided we weren't gonna do that anymore!" protested Sam as Tony took off, his wings flying open a second later. "I'm pretty sure you have an unfair advantage there, Iron Man!"
"And Wilson's wings, and Barnes' arm," Tony said. He slid his hand into the crook of Steve's elbow as they continued towards the bedrooms. "I'm sure Nat's stuff is perfectly shiny already, knowing her."
Tony huffed, wishing so badly that he could confide in Steve. But they had only been together for two weeks, and Tony wasn't quite sure if he was ready to pull him into his whole let's-take-down-the-government plan just yet.
And Steve absolutely loved that their entire team was so close by. Even though Clint and Nat were stationed up at the Compound for the school year, they were still only about a fifteen minute flight away, which made it all that much easier to coordinate training sessions and missions.
"Oh, yeah?" Steve said as Tony's hand grazed down his chest and abdomen to wrap around his cock. They groaned in tandem as pleasure shot through Steve's body like a rocket. "And whose fault is that, hmm?"
And then, after surviving for over sixty years frozen in the Arctic ice, he'd managed to find Tony and Peter in the middle of that Afghanistan desert using the same wits and instincts that he'd used to bring down HYDRA during the war, a feat that not even the very Army he'd thought he'd given his life for had deemed possible.
"Don't listen to anymore of that bullshit? It's just gonna make you mad, honey, and it probably won't matter in the end anyway. I'd rather you go down to the gym and bust up your knuckles again than listen to those idiots blathering on all afternoon. JARVIS will let us know if anything important comes up, you know that."
"I'm already on your six, Tony," Rhodey said, his words interspersed with HYDRA repulsor and rifle shots as he broke through the hole in the roof, widening it just enough for Sam to fly through with his wings expanded. "And it looks like they're taking the bait!"
"Sir, I'm afraid there's nothing more we can do!" the man protested, which Steve ignored as he clambered on top of the aircraft's nose, the blazing hot metal quickly burning through the soles of his boots as he attempted to wedge his fingers down inside the canopy's seal.
"That's very true." Steve tipped his head back as Tony's lips attacked his neck again, their hips rocking together in the erotic dance they had perfected over the last three years. "But then I didn't bother with any underwear, so—"
"You'd be still running your own company," Pepper said with a sly grin. "And who knows where we'd all be then. I'll see ya later."
"Or… we could go on a holiday," Steve said, and Tony's head snapped up in surprise, his eyes going wide as he tried to figure out if Steve was joking or not.
"Probably within the next couple of weeks, little guy," said Steve. "The last time he spoke to us about it Colonel Phillips seemed pretty eager to get going, so I doubt it'll be any longer than that."
Tony had confessed to Steve not too long ago that he was only the second person that Tony had ever bottomed with, with the first time being such an unpleasant experience that he swore he would never do it again. And yet, even in the days leading up to their first time Tony instinctively knew that despite Steve's obvious strength and their differences in size, that he could trust him. That Tony could trust Steve to take care of him.
"I'm pretty sure we can both play at this game, sweetheart," Steve said as he claimed Tony's lips. The kiss was hot, wet, and sloppy as he carried Tony over to the couch against the far wall, depositing him down in a tangle of limbs as he ordered JARVIS to lock down the lab.
"Captain, Mr Stark, welcome," T'Challa said once they stepped inside the massive hall. The king was dressed in a set of very classy-looking navy blue robes embroidered with intricate golden threads, and standing next to a girl, perhaps a bit older than Peter, with elaborately braided hair. "Please allow me to introduce my younger sister, Shuri. She is in charge of all of our technological research and equipment here in Wakanda."
"I'm the Captain, Tony," he said. "So that means I can't afford to do anything that'll shake the team's confidence, and especially not when we're so close to eliminating HYDRA. Once that's done and I know Peter is safe, then maybe I'll think about it, but I can't do it now. I can't do anything that might split my focus."
But on a night like this, when he could take his time and make sure that Tony was completely relaxed and ready for him, it was heavenly.
“Well, I guess it’s good that no one else’ll be in there with us,” said Steve.  He huffed out a sharp breath as he tucked Tony close again.  “I love you, Tony.  I love you so much, and—and I don't know where I’d be without you—”
"I can talk to Sharon, Peter's nurse," Steve said. "I know she'll be willing to help us. She's one of the good guys."
"Oh, 'cause no one's ever gotta lean around your head, right?" Bucky said, smirking as he tapped his datapad to life. "You seen the instructor yet?"
, and I didn't know where the hell you were or if I'd ever see you again. Just getting to sleep next to you again has been a gift."
"Yeah, that too. But seriously, Steve, you know how perceptive he is, so he probably already knows or can guess most of what's going on, even if we don't wanna admit it."
“Hey, Dad!” Peter exclaimed before Tony had even had a chance to get through the door.  Peter was sitting behind Steve’s counter with a small bag of Doritos in one hand while Steve was helping another customer, an older guy who was looking for something in the History aisle.
"I'm sorry, but who the hell are you?" Sam asked as he stepped out from behind Steve, his arms crossed in front of him. "And how did you know where we'd be—?"
he thought desperately. He had no idea what had happened to Papa after he was taken away, but Peter had a bad feeling that it wasn't anything good. Papa was in such rough shape that Peter couldn't understand how he was even still alive, and he knew they had to find him as soon as possible.
“Dad, this was all Obie’s doing,” Peter said.  “He made the deal with Justin Hammer to have Regina start working for Stark Industries so they’d have an easy way to send information back and forth, but then… after you and her were—”
As always, I can’t wait to hear what you think!  Please don’t forget to hit that kudos button and leave me a comment! 💗
"Not true," Steve cut in. A single tear rolled down his cheek, and he sniffed, swiping it roughly away. "That's not true and you know it. And you also know that I don't like it when you put yourself down like that."
“Yeah, okay, but Steve’s told me he used to run missions there all the time,” Peter interrupted.  “He was Special Forces, but Special Forces are still Army, aren't they?”
Hammer clicked his tongue as he shook his head. "Now, now, Steven, where are those legendary Depression-era manners that I've heard so much about, hmm? I have to say, you are really disappointing me!"
Slowly, Steve looked up at the masked face of the man he loved more than life itself, begging with his eyes to not force him to do what they were being forced to do.
For someone who had been so inexperienced, Tony was convinced that Steve now knew his body better than he did.
"All right, buddy," Tony said, ruffling Peter's hair. "Then just sit back and try to relax, I'm sure Uncle Bruce'll be ready soon."
"Nope," Tony stated. "You've officially used up all your buts. No more until you've been disconnected from all of this stuff and had something to eat, yeah?"
“Yeah, Tony!  I kinda figured that out!” Steve snaps, a bit too harshly when Tony’s eyes go wide.  “Sorry, I didn't—I mean—”
"Yes," she said, rather shyly. "I was hoping we could go together, do you think your dads will let you?"
Tony huffed, reaching for Steve with grabby hands. "Then get back down here, hot stuff. I need to touch you."
"Then how 'bout I call you 'Uncle Sam'?" Peter asked. "And Uncle Bucky? You're both like brothers to my papa anyway, right?"
The only explanation Peter could come up with that made even a bit of sense was that it was all about control. First with Grandpa, because he'd obviously been onto something that would've changed the world for the better, and O'Brien couldn't allow that since it didn't fit in with his own plans. And then with Dad it'd been pretty much the same thing. Identify the really smart people who are otherwise unfit to serve in the military, and then force them to work for the military instead, threatening them with the lives of the people they love if they dare to set one single toe out of line.
"You guys need my help," he added, just as the alien smacked Papa square in the chin, sending him flying into the side of a building. Then he picked up Dad in his hand, tossing him off to the side as he wound up, preparing to throw his hammer.
"I'm fine, Tony," Steve said, trying not to sound impatient. He hadn't been finished yet, but he had a feeling that Tony was going to insist that he was.
Then again, knowing Phillips like he does—or at least used to—Steve figures he’ll be watching anyway, the very same scowl on his face that Steve couldn’t forget in a million years.
He was interrupted by a knock at the door, and once again his jaw practically hit the floor as it opened to reveal Sam Wilson pushing Bucky Barnes in a wheelchair, his entire left side from his shoulder to his hip still covered in white bandages, followed closely by Sharon the nurse.
"Okay, so, how 'bout you come inside and tell us some more about it, hmm?" Natasha cut in. "No offence, but you look like you're about ready to fall over."
, Tony, and that's what's killing me," Steve said, so full of agony that Tony's heart nearly cracked right down the middle. "But I can't take any chances, not with either of you. I'm pretty sure that you'll be okay while I'm gone since you'll be there at the base surrounded by people who can protect you, but Peter—sweetheart, he
"That's exactly what I was planning to do, Tony," said Howard, rather proudly. "And I've also adjusted the dose of the serum a bit as well. It should just be enough to heal his heart and lungs and any possible brain damage from his hypoxic events. We're not looking to make another super-soldier here."
"Well… it's a pretty competitive internship, so I'm guessing they need to interview a lot of people. And there's five slots, so that probably means more interviews too."
"They are all gone," Mantis said sadly, shaking her head as her antennae curled downwards. "This must mean that Thanos has won."
"So then it should be fine," said Sam. "The guy will be gone, the drug will be destroyed, and we can all move on."
In the middle of another giant sip of milkshake, Peter could only nod his head, squeezing his eyes closed when a brain freeze suddenly attacked. After finishing the
"Yeah, okay," Peter said. "But if you change your mind, I definitely don't mind talking to my dad about it. I'm sure he'd be thrilled to have such an intelligent intern on his staff."
and he just couldn't seem to help himself from enjoying them whenever he had the chance to take one out.
“Um… Pete?” Dad said, nearly sending Peter straight to the ceiling.  “What the hell are you doing in here?”
Peter gave a nod, both surprised and grateful that the lemon drop did seem to be calming his stomach a bit.
Tony shot him the goofy, lopsided grin that he adored.  “Well, I can’t say that I don't love that sentimental streak you tend to have,” he said.  “Just as long as it’s the happy kind.”
Steve let out a heavy sigh, his fingers trailing up and down Tony's spine. "I know. But now, once he's better, he can have both. He can have whatever he wants, just like you. You both have more than earned it."
"Looks like we're gonna be up to Hufflepuff5 soon," he murmured into his polar bear's neck. "And probably even more than that."
"Um, you might wanna rethink that there, hon," Tony murmured as he slid his hand down to palm Steve's crotch, pulling a choked gasp from Steve's throat. Steve let out a growl as he captured Tony's mouth again, nipping at his plush bottom lip as Tony tapped his ass, urging him to climb onto his armoured feet.
"Papa?" he said, his full lips curling into a stunned smile. "Papa, you're—you're home! You made it home!"
When Tony doesn't answer, Steve clears his throat.  “Tony?  Do you have any ideas on where we might be?”
"Tony," Steve whispered. "It's gonna be okay. No matter what happens to me, both you and Peter will be safe, and to me that's what matters most."
"Oh God, Tony," Steve groaned as Tony pushed lightly against his shoulder, indicating for him to lie on his back. It was almost frightening sometimes, how well Tony could read him. "You don't—you don't have to—"
The king nodded, clasping his hands in front of him as Steve gestured to Tony and Peter. "This is my husband and son, Tony Stark and Peter Stark-Rogers. You may better know Tony as—"
"All right, I'm on it," Steve said. He locked eyes with Bucky, nodding as Bucky reached his metal arm towards the hatch's handle. "Three… two… one…"
"As you were," Steve ordered as he returned the cadet's salute. "And no, I'm just here to do some research."
Which they hadn't. Thanks to Helen Cho and her top-notch medical connections, after an extremely delicate and complicated surgery followed by a series of very bulky—and annoying—casts, Steve's foot was technically completely healed, with no traces of any lingering injury visible on X-ray or MRI.
"Um… well, I s'pose it would depend," Peter stammered, giving Gwen what he hoped was an appreciative look. "Papa would never do anything specifically against the wishes of another country's government, so—"
"No, I'm better now, thanks," Peter replied. He decided to forgo putting on his pyjamas and brushing his teeth, and instead just crawled underneath his covers, clutching his polar bear to his chest and trying to stop his teeth from chattering.
The woman nodded. "It was a long time ago, back in what you would call the year 1995. He… helped me figure out a few things."
Tony huffed, mentally kicking himself for not remembering. "Ah, yeah, if she—if she doesn't mind. And tell her thanks for me, will ya?"
The rest of Sam's reply was lost in a barrage of fire from three Wakandan aircraft as they looped back around. Swerving to avoid being hit, Tony screeched to a halt just in time to witness Scott Lang, who was roughly the height of a five story building, take out another of the ugly-as-hell flying whale creatures with a single left hook.
"Tony! Sweetheart, please, you don't have to do this!" he pleaded. "They've got you under some kind of mind-control, let me help—!"
Steve's eyes immediately went wide. "Were you—?" he started, snapping his mouth closed with Phillips raised his hand.
I don't require your permission to ogle my husband," Tony shot back. "In fact, I'm pretty sure I don't even need his."
“Ah, here we are, sir,” JARVIS said a couple minutes later.  Tony blinked as the first page of a file appeared on his screen, frowning as he noticed the harsh black lines striking out most of the text.
Steve's belly gave a hard swoop as Tony flew over an overpass and the lake came into view. Even in the dim light of the quarter moon Steve could see the huge chunks of ice bobbing in the water like miniature icebergs, and the ripples emanating out from a point in the near-centre, likely where Peter had been pulled underneath the surface.
"Protect the stone!" T'Challa called as he leapt from the top of one of the destroyed gears. "We must protect the stone!"
"Hmm," Tony said, warily eyeing his father. "So that's it, right? The dude went from being half-mad to completely cuckoo afterwards?"
"Okay," he murmured, his pencil flying around his thumb as he read over the lines of code. Just as he'd suspected, everything that he'd programmed since Dad had installed JARVIS's initial matrix was perfectly fine, which meant there had to have been some monitoring program installed on Dad’s computer way back before he first started that had somehow flagged the program as something someone needed to look at.
"Got it," replied Natasha, approaching one of the computer terminals as Steve headed for the first set of doors, again breaking the lock easily with his shield.
"Aww, thanks, Gwen!" Ned said with a wide smile. "I'm so glad you guys are looking as forward to this as I am."
“Oh, you're welcome,” said Pepper.  “And again, I know I’m probably way off base here, but Happy’s noticed the same thing in your son.  He told me that Peter’s guards have noticed that he seems happier than he’s been in a long time too, so… whatever you're both doing that’s been different, it seems to be working pretty well.”
Tony hesitated for only about three seconds before setting down his Thermos. He still didn't believe that he'd be able to actually sleep, but the thought of curling up next to his boy for a couple of hours did sound pretty nice.
While they had literally just finalised a plan to save the universe, if Steve hadn't known any better, he would've thought that the team was celebrating something for how lively they were over dinner. Cracking jokes, trading stories about favourite movies and books and sports teams, and then dragging each other over said favourites, it seemed like the team, although incomplete, had finally found its rhythm again. That they had finally gelled back together as a family, rather than just a group of superheroes who happened to work well together.
And then he had turned on his heel and walked out of Obie’s office, slamming the door behind him so hard that the wall had shaken.
"Yes, mo grá, I get it," Steve said softly as he cupped Tony's cheek in his hand. "But couldn't you have just upgraded the chips in my old uniforms instead of making me another one?"
"Yes, I know he does. Steven was always very gung-ho about the Air Corps, always telling me that he wanted to grow up to be a pilot like his papa." She slumped back in the chair, her blue eyes sad. "The fact that Bucky always said the same thing made him even more determined, and I never had the heart to tell him anything that might've dampened those ambitions. There were way too many times where those ambitions were the only things that kept him alive."
"Oh, okay. Thanks, Mr Stark. I'll… um… is it okay if I try again tomorrow? Maybe I can catch Peter when he's awake for once?"
Tony gave a nod, glancing up at Steve through his eyelashes, his heart stuttering at the glorious sight. It had been such an exhausting day that at the moment Tony wanted nothing better than to crawl back under the torn sheets on Steve's bed and sleep for the next three days.
Which made perfect sense. He had just hoped that once they got started with the quantum tunnel, maybe things would improve a bit.
"Time to squash the spider!" Thanos sneered as Dad flew towards them, only to be knocked backwards by the purple Power Stone, slamming him into Drax and Dr Strange.
"Well, nothin' wrong with that." He made a move towards the kitchen exit, but Peter grabbed onto his hand, halting him.
Steve grunted as his head began to slip forward again, managing to catch himself just before it dropped. He was so tired that he could barely keep his eyelids open, and had already managed to wrench his neck three separate times trying to stay awake.
"I bet it kinda sucks for you though, being a kid in a house full of superheroes, doesn't it?" asked the guy. "Don't you ever get jealous? I know I would if it were me."
But even then, during that awful time of uncertainty, Steve had still been able to see them, to talk to them and touch them and hold their hands, even when they couldn't respond. Steve had always been a very tactile person; one of the many reasons why he was always so affectionate with his beloved boys. He craved the way Tony's strong body moulded into his, the feel of the bare skin of Tony's back against his chest and the scratch of his facial hair as he held him at night, and the touch of his lips against his. And with Peter, Steve never passed up an opportunity to give him one of his papa-bear hugs, to ruffle his downy-soft hair or clap a hand on his shoulder.
Breaking the thick lock on the heavy metal doors took only one hard swing of the shield, and then they were inside, walking down a set of stone steps into what appeared to be a research lab, not too unlike other HYDRA labs they'd encountered. Long counters were lined with computer stations and scattered bits of paper, some still with blinking cursors, and towards the back of the square-shaped room were two sets of double doors, one on each side.
"Thanks, Ms Sharon," Peter said as he carefully manoeuvred his IV tree over the tiled floor. "I'll just be a few minutes."
But this, sitting in Tony Stark’s penthouse playing chess with the sweetest boy he’d ever met in his life after indulging in the absolute best Italian food he’d ever eaten and getting to sneak glances at the most beautiful man he’d ever seen, well… he could definitely do this all day.
"Nah, it's okay," Tony said quickly, trying to hide his disappointment. Getting to talk to Peter would've helped boost Steve's mood a bit, but he knew Steve would never wake him up just to talk on the phone.
The look of awe on Peter's face once they arrived at Gwen's house sent another stab of nostalgia straight into Tony's heart. Tony had to admit that she looked very pretty in her emerald green dress that matched her eyes, with her blonde hair curled and swept to one side to brush across her shoulder.
"It's not out of the realm of possibility, Tony," answered Steve. "Stane and Killian did manage to break into the Tower, so it's entirely possible that they were able to plant spies here as well. Do we know for sure if the sceptre is still contained?"
"And over the course of the next several months, you then proceeded to begin a relationship with Mr Stark, is that also correct?"
"To be honest, sir, at the time I wasn't really prepared to deal with choices. It was quite a shock, being suddenly thrust into the twenty-first century, and I honestly wasn't in the right frame of mind to make any life-altering decisions at the time."
"And do you still think you'll be able to go on the Decathlon trip? I mean, the competition is in just over a week, so—"
Steve’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed.  “But… what if—what if I’m not… fixable?  Tony, what if… we
Coming face-to-face with his best friend, who he thought he’d lost back in 1944, and having him turn out to be a brainwashed HYDRA assassin was something Steve was still coming to grips with.  If it weren't for Tony and Peter, and Tony’s incredible generosity with helping to not only search for Bucky but also fully funding those search efforts, Steve isn't sure how he would be coping.
He wondered how long it would be before one of them decided to act on their feelings, since from Steve's perspective, Sam was just as smitten.
"So, like I said, my father was also an Air Corps pilot, and, like many pilots, he was rather highly regarded in society. And because of that high regard, it was… shall I say,
And that just wasn't going to work. Tony wasn't about to allow Steve to lose another battle with his fear demon now, not when they were finally getting all the pieces together of what exactly they were up against.
Gwen's pretty green eyes flicked nervously around the hallway before landing on Peter's. "Yeah, actually. I got a letter in the mail yesterday, inviting me to interview for a summer internship."
"But it's not sleep, Птер, don't you see?" said Bucky. "It's like stasis, where there's nothing but a bunch of nothingness. You can't see anything, you can't hear or touch anything, and most of all you can't feel anything. And that's what they want. They want you to not feel anything because that's how they control you. You're nothing to them, just a mindless drone doing whatever they command you to do, and then when they don't need you they just stuff you away, back into the nothing."
Obie sighed into the phone.  “You know, it’d be a lot easier if you just sent a car or something to pick up the kid instead of always worrying about it yourself.  It always worked just fine for Howard.”
Steve shook his head, his eyes filling with tears as he fiddled with Tony's fingers in his lap. "Tony, it was—it was… oh God, it was
"You've got me, honey," Tony murmured. He quickly kicked off his own shoes before fumbling with the buttons on Steve's uniform jacket, launching somewhere in the general direction of the chair. "Want you naked, babe. Like right the hell
"Probably. Like I said at the hearing, I specifically made sure to fulfill all of my existing military contracts, but once that was done—"
"Thank you, sweetheart," Tony heard Steve say quietly, punctuated by various grunts as he and Thor took turns dodging huge chunks of rock being levitated by one of the Voldemort aliens.
"Tony, let me go with him," Howard pleaded as the medics loaded Peter onto their stretcher. "Please, you need to finish your work, you know they won't let you—"
"Yeah, that's her, she's our team Captain," Peter answered. "You've both met her, and I'm pretty sure you've met her mom too, or at least seen her a few times. And her dad's on one of the Damage Control crews in the city."
"Master Peter is currently sleeping peacefully, Captain, with his vital signs within his normal parameters," JARVIS replied. "However, he did experience a short period of restlessness approximately forty-five minutes ago."
"What do you mean, what am I doing here?" Steve gently admonished. "Tony, I've been waiting for you to wake up. I haven't left your side since you came home!"
Steve stepped into the lab to find Tony surrounded by several holographic projections of varying shapes and sizes, a few that resembled the security drones stationed at various points around the Tower, and others that looked a bit different, more mechanised. He was obviously engrossed in his work, not noticing Steve's presence until he set the coffee cups down on the counter, his eyes going wide as they swept across him.
"Yeah, that's normal," Tony replied, his hands settling into their usual spots on Steve's biceps. "It took me a few tries to get used to mine too, and you know Pete's still working out the kinks in his, so…" He paused then, chewing nervously on his bottom lip. "You're still gonna try to get used to it though, right?"
“Yes!” Peter exclaimed, launching himself out of his chair and right into Steve’s arms so fast that Steve barely had time to catch him.  Then he buried his face in Steve’s shoulder, his skinny body shaking with happy sobs.  “Yes, Papa,” he said.  “I
Gwen's cheeks flushed even deeper as she fiddled with the corner of her napkin. "Um… no. I'd actually love to work for Stark Industries someday, as one of their scientists. I was thinking of applying for one of their summer internship positions since I'll turn sixteen in the spring, so…"
"Ahh, who's she got reading it?" Dad asked. "'Cause it better not be someone that Steve and I don't know."
"But Tony, I don't think destroying any one of the stones is gonna do any good," said Bruce. "Thanos doesn't even have them all yet, and he's still the most powerful being in the universe. The stones will just make it easier for him to do what he wants to do."
"Hell no!" shouted Tony, wincing when Steve startled in his arms. "There's no way I can be sure, because a split-second later I saw that my kid had just up and disappeared! But you cannot tell me that what happened out there was just some kind of natural phenomenon, 'cause that's just a bunch of bullshit!"
button on his iPod and lifts his head, glancing around the room at his competition.  There’s Bucky, Steve’s Team USA teammate who beat him at the Olympic trials to take the top spot in the 100 free, the freestyle slot on the medley relay, the lead-off position on the free relay, as well as the second slot in the 100-metre butterfly.  Other than the fact that he beat Steve in the trials, Bucky seems like a really nice guy.  An Army vet who decided to go to college on the GI Bill after his four years were done, Bucky started swimming to strengthen his left arm after it was injured on one of his tours, and the rest, as they say, is history.
“Yeah!” says Clint.  “‘Cause I’m convinced we’re spending more on duct tape to fix the goddamn targets than it would cost to replace ‘em!”
Tony’s lips twitch, and he idly pats Peter’s back, who, after a pretty impressive freakout when they were first brought aboard the jet, proceeded to conk right out next to Tony on his gurney, his skinny arm tight across his father’s waist.  Like Thor said, the poor little guy was so worried while Steve and Tony were missing that he hardly slept, instead helping Bruce and JARVIS decipher the Tesseract data which allowed them to build the tether that Thor used to retrieve them.
"Tours of the new X-302s will begin in the northeast hangar tomorrow during your normal briefing hours, which your current patrol schedules have been altered to reflect," Phillips said once Tony was finished. "Unless there are any further questions, you are all dismissed."
"Steve?" Tony blurted out, all attempts at professionalism temporarily forgotten. "Steve, are you there?"
"I am all for the eating of large quantities of pizza," said Thor as he came up behind Peter, clapping a hand on his shoulder. "In fact, young Starkson, I do believe that you in fact challenged me to some sort of contest the last time we indulged in eating pizza together?"
"We know because the containment vessel that I built to carry the thing is made from a metal that absorbs vibrations," said Tony. "It's the same metal that's powering the space-faring X-302s."
"All right, Tony, I get it," Steve said quickly. "And for Peter? I'm assuming you're making something for him as well?"
Dr Strange raised a skeptical eyebrow, glancing between Peter and Dad. "You're telling me that your son… is an Avenger?"
"Not sure how you expect me to say no to that, you big tease," Tony whispered as Steve took his hand, intertwining their fingers.
"He's still fighting it, Steve!" Natasha said from the anteroom. "None of them can believe it, they've never seen anything like it!"
Three strokes later and Tony was there, throwing his head back against the pillow as his body arched into Steve, his beautiful face so etched in pleasure that Steve couldn't help but follow him over the edge.  He cried out his trembling climax into Tony’s shoulder, finally collapsing half on top of him as all of his remaining strength seeped from his body.
But he couldn't. He had spent too much time and overcome too many hurdles to get where he was, and there was no way he was going to jeopardise it now.
As most of their vacations did, the week passed all too quickly, and soon Steve and the rest of the team were already packing to head back to New York. And while Tony would likely disagree with him, especially since King T'Challa had flat-out refused to give them any information on their defensive technology, Steve was still very grateful that they had made the trip. Not only had Peter been able to truly relax for the first time in months, thanks largely in part to his instant friendship with T'Challa's sister, but the entire team seemed to be rejuvenated. Clint and Natasha had even taken the opportunity to travel out to the mountains for a couple of days, leaving the twins behind for the first time since they had come to live with them. Bucky and Sam had embarked on an excursion as well, exploring the far western border of the country and camping out under the stars, something that Sam had enjoyed when he was young.
"Okay, okay, I don't need to know anymore about that," Steve said quickly. He grabbed his leather jacket from his locker and slipped it on, sliding his small sketchbook and a pencil into the inside pocket and hoping against hope to make his escape before Bucky decided to share any further details about he and Sam's sex life.
"What?" exclaimed Steve. "But the trial mission was still sanctioned by the government, so I don't understand how—!"
Like nearly burning his skin off in a shower that was way too hot. Or trying to box against his vibranium shield.
Which was good, because Steve knew how much Tony adored those cuddles. And how desperately he had missed them during the year Peter was missing.
"No, it's okay," Peter said, even as his heart fluttered and a hard lump rose in his throat. "Y-yeah. That—that's the one."
And as always, I can’t wait to see what you guys think!  Please don’t forget to hit the kudos button, and drop me a comment!  💖
"Ah, well, since we'll be moving in a parabolic orbit, breaking it too soon would mean the aircraft would be travelling through the atmosphere at too steep of an angle," replied Bucky. "Which means that the heat shield wouldn’t be aligned correctly."
"Dad?" Peter said as he frantically scanned the barren, dusty rock where his father had stood literally seconds before. He let out a hard shiver as the all-too-familiar ice bolt raced down his spine, telling him that something was very, very wrong.
"After our previous discussion, I took the liberty of placing a tracer on the server," JARVIS began. "That tracer was just activated approximately three minutes ago, meaning someone was accessing the server at that time."
For some bizarre, unfathomable reason, Steve absolutely loved the mess of scars on Tony's chest. Loved to trace them with his fingertips while they laid in bed together, loved to kiss and caress them while they were intimate. He said they were a visible reminder of Tony's strength and tenacity, whatever that meant, but when it all came down to it, there was just no way that Tony could deny Steve something he loved.
"Yeah, sure," Peter muttered. "I'll come back in here when I'm done, see if you need anything else."
Peter thought, biting his bottom lip. Both Dad and Papa looked about as exhausted as he felt, and the fact that they had refused to tell him anything about their meeting down in D.C. could only mean that it hadn't gone well, so…
"Do you even have to ask me that?" came Tony's stuttered response, muffled in the pillows. Steve smiled, kissing his way closer and closer to where his fingers were waiting for Tony to give him the go-ahead.
He’s not doing anything here that he hasn’t done hundreds of times, so his fear can just go fuck itself.
“Hang on,” he said as an idea suddenly burst inside his mind, not too unlike the sparks he’d just created.  Setting down his coffee cup, he stepped over to the hologram and enlarged it, narrowing his eyes as he attempted to focus in on the area just past the fuel valve.
"Or what they managed to accomplish. I mean, for all we know all they managed to do is cause another huge mess that'll have to be cleaned up."
"Uh huh. Love you too." As soon as the screen went blank, Peter flopped backwards onto his bed, only narrowly missing the corner of one of his textbooks with his head.
"Scott told us that both Hank Pym and his former apprentice suffered brain damage from using the particles too often, and I'm not going to allow you to risk that," Steve said firmly. He swung his right arm, testing the feel of the new nanite suit. "Especially if there's no need for it."
Phillips might even include a nice something in his post-race lecture, since Steve is the first swimmer he’s ever coached to an Olympic gold.  Maybe that will finally be enough to earn a break from his usual grumpy critiques about Steve’s stroke form, and his turns, and his touches.
They all entered the restaurant to find John Sheppard and Cam Mitchell already seated in the back, where the wait staff had pushed two tables together.
"JARVIS, launch Pete's nanite suit from the Compound!" he heard Dad say, sounding like he was under water.
"Okay," he gasped under his breath as he gripped the back of the chair next to where he was perched. Yanking it free, he twisted slightly and launched it directly at the flaming pile, blowing a hole through the weakened wooden doors that was just wide enough for the people to get through if they went single file.
"Just about, Pete." Tony tapped in some more commands as he glanced furtively at his son, who was flipping the pen around his thumb so fast that Tony could barely see it. "You sure that Bucky's the anxious one here, though?"
"At ease, Captain," said Phillips. Then he walked over to the door and pulled it open, stepping back as one more person entered the room.
"Okay… well… this one's simple," Tony insisted. "We draw him in, pin him down, and get what we want—"
But unfortunately, at the moment he still needed to figure out a way to get to the bathroom and back without causing a scene.
He was just on the verge of sleep again when a sudden piercing noise blared through the otherwise silent room. Tony startled, bolting upright on the bed before he even realised what he was doing.
"Yeah, well, give the guy a break, okay, Sam?" Steve said, grinning. "He is almost a hundred years old, you know."
"You got it." Steve squeezed his eyes closed as he sucked in a deep breath, flinching as another grenade exploded about ten metres behind them that was immediately followed by a chorus of panicked screams and shouts. He could only imagine how frantic Tony must be already. "All right, we'll go on my mark. Three… two… one… mark!"
"Shh, my love," Steve whispered as his lips closed over Tony's, the pleasure that had been lapping at him like the warm waves of the Mediterranean suddenly spiking as their tongues met and danced together, condensing into a tight ball deep inside his gut when Tony nipped at his bottom lip. Tony's free hand dropped from Steve's back to try and sneak between their bodies but Steve pushed it away, wrapping his own fingers around Tony's erection and stroking him in time with his thrusts.
