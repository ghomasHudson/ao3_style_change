“One of the most prolific species of rideable dragon in the European continent, the Lesser Ridgeback (pictured) has become the standard breed in most European countries for its typically favorable temperament and morphological diversity.” John read in a little note box next to the big picture. “While other local breeds are still present in Aeries across the continent, as well as other species of dragons altogether, the Lesser remains popular overall.” John looked from the page to Hyperion and back a few times, holding it up in front of Hyperion for comparison.
John reached down with his other hand and started stroking Sherlock’s cock, still hard and ready below him. Sherlock hissed at the contact, pushing into the hand eagerly to take his mind off other things, moaning lightly until John reminded him with another sharp swat to his backside, “I didn’t say you could move.” And the pain took him out of the pleasurable buzz again.
“She looks while I think, asks questions now and then,” Sherlock said, taking a drink.
“You’re just saying that cause you’re bored,” Sherlock said.
“Sherlock?” John mumbled, looking down the long hall in the direction of the flat. The phone vibrated in his hand again prompting him to look as another text popped, “If inconvenient come anyway. SH” As if from far off he was reading John’s mind. Food would have to wait a bit longer; if the urgency of the text was any indicator Sherlock could be in some sort of trouble.
“Sorry,” John apologized, rubbing at his temple with his fingers.
“Memories are so good,” Sherlock groaned into John’s mind, wrapping his own around John’s and giving John a lovely warm blanketed feeling even though he was the one covering Sherlock.
“Master Lestrade, what is it?” He asked roughly, there was definitely noise going on in the background.
John saw the belt he’d used earlier hanging from the back of the saddle and grabbed for it; if she was going to fly he wanted to be attached. It would be tragic to lose two riders trying to save one. John couldn’t do that to Greg.
have you chipped and locked up. I’ll send you back to the home planet if I have to,” Mycroft threatened, drawing his posture even straighter.
“You keep saying ‘his type.’ What is he, if you don’t mind me asking?” John asked after taking a bite out of a half unwrapped egg salad sandwich he’d picked up from the now open counter.
“You, er,” John wagged a finger at his own forehead.
Upstairs the kitchen door sat open to reveal Sherlock poking around inside the open suitcase on the kitchen table. He appeared clean and wore a new button up with the sleeves rolled up and yellow kitchen gloves as he fished floppy pieces of eggshell out of the slime and deposited them on a towel nearby. As John stood there watching Sherlock absorbed in his work he noticed a trio of round patches on one arm.
“John,” Lestrade sounded tired.“I need you to stay inside the Aerie. Don’t follow Sherlock anywhere, don’t take any cabs, just stay put.” John could hear voices in the background; it sounded busy, wherever he was.
“It’ll heal in the morning,” Sherlock said, John feeling his baritone rumble through the skin contact. Sherlock picked up John’s other wrist where it rested in John’s lap; he stroked a thumb over the pale bite mark shaped scars there. “Remember?” he said quietly.
“Of course, how else do you expect to get across London in a reasonable amount of time? Now quit being an idiot and and climb up,” Sherlock said impatiently, when John stopped right next to Bellamy’s neck.
like me,” Sherlock mumbled into his leather clad knees.
“Sir?” Lestrade asked.
“As far as I’ve seen and heard, yes. What he sees in Jim is an even bigger mystery, one I am not willing to invest any more of my time in than that.” John didn’t know what else to say, really, if Sherlock was convinced that Moran wasn’t a threat then he’d have to take the genius’ word on it, Sherlock had been living in London Aerie his whole life, he’d be the one to know if something was amiss.
“Master--Master Lestrade, you do remember what happened last time you grounded him, right?” Henry asked frantically, leaning forward to look down the table.
“There’s nothing wrong with you, just a busted up shoulder and some scrapes and bruises.” She calmly patted his blanket-covered leg.
He thought, hand stilling on Hyperion’s jaw. Hyperion replied with an affirmation, nudging into John’s hand, but he wanted John to go home, go home and be comfy too. John couldn’t really argue with him either, it was Christmas eve and the sun was nearly down, more and more strands of festive lights were coming on all over the Aerie as night approached. Both him and Sherlock should head home and have dinner.
By the end of the week John was particularly restless, wanting to get up and move around out of his bed. A nurse was the first to come to his aid; she began unhooking him from anything still attached, mostly just fluids by that point. By the time he had got his legs swung over the side of the bed there was another nurse there big enough to catch him if he fell. Once John was on his feet he teetered, the other nurse had his arm in moments steadying him as he regained his balance. He shuffled around a bit, just short steps at first after a week of not using his legs, before he started taking proper steps and got walking around again.
should be asking
John didn’t know what to say to that. He really didn’t know if he would be transferred once Hyperion was healed, there’d been zero talk about it if it was going to happen. He didn’t want to transfer away either, he wanted to stay with all the people he’d grown familiar with, wanted to stay with Sherlock too, and wasn’t that laughable after all the people who’d told him to stay away from him at the start. He’d gone and fallen head over heels for the mad bastard.
In reality John was simply lying there, his body fine from the exterior, paralyzed by the drug to the point that one could mistake him for just a fish tank full of jelly if it weren’t for an occasional minute twitch. Paul picked up his phone and sat back down on his stool; Billy took his seat as well, stashing the bottle and syringe back in its box.
“No,” John chuckled pushing outwards into Sherlock’s hold, “It was actually a strangely fond remembrance.”
“How long have you had her?” John asked first, that one being the most tame and least likely to make the man choke on the piece of bread in his mouth.
John was left to ponder what sorts of books the Aerie had as Lestrade began the tour. Much of the thing was driving, with only a little walking in the halls that were too small for the car. The Aerie as it turned out was set up much like a lopsided bicycle wheel. The larger dragon sized halls spiked off from the airfield like spokes, but the field was not dead center of the Aerie and sat situated closer to the south, like the yolk of a fried egg skewed off to the side.
“But you still got the rest right, that’s pretty remarkable,” John said trying to make it right again, the rest had been fascinating, a bit baffling at first, but fascinating, and John was willing to bet had he not stopped Sherlock earlier the man would probably still be going right down to his study at St. Bart’s Hospital and beyond.
“Fine!” Sherlock hissed, “would you rather hear that I enjoy your company again? It wouldn’t be a complete fabrication at least,” Sherlock bent to bring his mouth closer to John’s ear, continuing to speak quietly, “but I will get you skyward John. Mark my words, you will fly. You are going to let Hyperion fly again in the near future and in order for that to happen you need to be in his saddle. So you can either go easy or I could sedate you and strap you to your harness until you give in.” An unnamable thrill shivered up John’s spine at the whispered threats.
John thought as he clicked another one.
Sherlock seemed to gravitate to John, who hadn’t gotten to removing his coat and gloves just yet,  and set about removing them for him, carefully stripping John of the layers that had kept him warm from the snow over the last few hours. John hadn’t even noticed that the items were damp until he was exposed to the warmth of the room without them. Sherlock hung John’s coat next to his own on the rack, making a mildly humorous image of the two of them with sherlock’s tall coat next to John’s shorter one appearing to stand next to the door.
“Sir, I brought Mr Holmes for you,” he said, pulling on Lestrade’s sleeve to get his attention. Lestrade’s gaze went right to Sherlock and John could see an almost desperate slightly panicked look in his eyes.
“Hmm?” Sherlock replied around the last of the treat in his mouth.
“I’m at Roland-Kerr Further Education College. I need you or someone from the Aerie here, now; Bellamy is on the warpath. Bring police too.” John didn’t wait for a reply before hanging up the phone and taking off into the halls of the school.
“Shh,” John hissed again wishing Sherlock weren’t quite so loud about it as they left the field and walked on into the somewhat quiet halls of their division.
“Never been really into that before,” John confessed, letting out a small moan anyway as Sherlock gave up with his mouth and pinched with thumb and forefinger.
That Sherlock would actually let the color disappear so soon after they’d been in contact so intimately was not a good sign. Usually Sherlock would actively carry John’s stains with him for as long as possible, like a badge of pride. John had even once heard Sherlock think, ‘these are my mate’s stains, I have a mate! Me!’ when he caught a human sat next to him on the tube curiously staring at the orange blotches on his skin. Sherlock had caught himself and quickly closed the mental door to those thoughts with an embarrassed feeling that made John chuckle at him and squish a little closer to his side in affection.
“What about him?” John asked, resisting the temptation to crawl back into the box with Hyperion and go back to sleep. Sally laid a hand on his shoulder.
“It can’t have been that bad, he does actually seem to care for you,” John said remembering the first time he’d ever met Mycroft, with Damir peering at him through a window.
“Well you’re going to for now, you can’t leave him at my home like the last one,” she snapped.
“It’s only one of the most fun jobs in the Aerie, especially in the summer. It’s a bit rotten in the winter cause the water’s warm but everywhere else isn’t. You’ll see soon, it’s lots of fun. I’ve been told it’s like a day at the beach only without all the sand, which I think is fine since we get plenty of sand anyway,” she rambled, waving an arm at Hyperion’s mostly untouched sand pit.
“Well I’m not going to be naked all the time,” John said turning around with a hand on his hip.
That forced a small laugh out of John, “I’ve had a long day,” he said before trying to relay what happened: Sherlock, flying, murder, the hatchling, Mycroft, Bellamy. Too complex to work across the bond, John started to just tell him out loud, explaining the adventures of the day.
John continued to wind his way through the aquarium, he could still hear Sebbie behind him. But it was only a matter of time before another bullet whizzed by. The shot hit the fish tank next to him, piercing the thick acrylic front and sending water spraying forth, catching John in the mess and making him stumble and fall.
“I need to analyze it.” Sherlock replied.
“No one said you had to do it right now,” Tom said, following him, not taking the hint that John wanted to be done with the topic. “But you’ll have to take him up eventually; his kind are meant to fly. The Masters and the teachers will help you--”
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” he said, standing and quickly insinuating himself into John’s personal space. “Do not make me repeat myself, I find it rather tedious.” Sherlock’s icy eyes held John’s even as he approached, forcing John to look up as the man crowded up against him in the doorway, stopping short of smearing blood on John’s robe. John took a small step back; he didn’t have time to reply before Sherlock was off.
“You know what I mean,” Sherlock said, burying his face in John’s neck.
Sherlock directed Bellamy to go right to Sally and John got to watch all of the scales on Melinda’s body bristle slightly, like hackles on a dog nearly all of her scales suddenly curled at the tips making her look even more vicious. Her movements had been on the side of twitchy, as Bellamy approached Melinda stilled except for her tail which began vibrating, it’s golden yellow tip dancing as though all the energy in her body had concentrated down to that one small part.
A while later he arrived home to the empty 221b, hair neatly trimmed into his prefered military shortness, with Angus carrying the few groceries and things he’d purchased. John had worried how he’d carry his shopping home with cane in one hand and still injured arm not quite ready for carrying much of anything. He’d been pleasantly surprised when the cashier had pulled out a bag with handles so that the little dragon could carry it. After Angus had set the stuff down on a clean bit of counter space John thanked him and gave him a pat on the head. “You tell Mrs Hudson I said thank you, too,” John said, scratching his fingers under one of the folded frills and noticing that Angus was actually fairly cool to the touch compared to Hyperion.
As the car wound through various tunnels and halls, John, unused to the massive Aerie, quickly lost track of where they were going. He was distracted wondering where Sherlock had been headed and what might happen to him. Hyperion stirred on the other end of the bond, not completely rising out of his nap, but waking enough to send John a thin feeling of concern ‘you’re still okay?’ John wasn’t lying when he said that he still was, though he tried to reign in the thoughts of what might await him at the other end of the car ride and the dragon drifted back off.
It took a second for John’s brain to wake up properly and realize: there was no blue glow of aquarium tanks, no sound of water, no hard surfaces. He was in a soft bed, in a nice warm room, under a fluffy duvet, with Sherlock clinging to his back. The nightmare was over, no more fish and transformations. John took a deep calming breath and reached for Sherlock’s hand on his stomach, pulling it up and clutching it to his chest as he let the breath out again. Bed, he was in bed at Baker Street.
gushed across the bond as John chuckled and hugged Hyperion’s face, rubbing his bare hands across pleasantly warm scales.
“Does the Aerie look like the sort of place that has droves of people wandering the halls singing?” Sherlock replied with his own question.
The sight could only make john pause for a moment before he lunged forward; creepiness be damned, he needed to get that book away from her. The moment he touched it, her eyes locked onto him and with an almost supernaturally ear-piercing shriek she backhanded him, clutching the open book closer to her chest. He tried again barely fazed by the hit, Jim was no Sebbie, she didn’t have the same brute strength. This time he managed to get a grip on the book. Even as she wailed at him both with her voice and her clawed hand, John struggled to get the thing away from her.
John began to scrub. Dirt that blended into Hyperion’s natural sandy mottled pattern coming away in the water in fine clouds. The water immediately around Hyperion began to turn a slightly dingy color as Hyperion was surrounded by people rubbing him clean. The wrinkles of his wings held onto a surprising amount of dirt and the scrubbing the leathery appendages received revealed an extremely faint gold eyespot pattern across their backs, similar to Bellamy’s butterfly pattern but much less detailed and clear.
“Did you hurt yourself?” John asked quietly, once Hyperion had relaxed a bit. He was aware the dragon had his injured shoulder in the sand; he’d clean it once he got Hyperion back up and moving. Hyperion nodded, a shaky thin feeling of uncertainty accompanying it, ‘I don’t know, but I’m feeling poorly’ John interpreted. He looked up the length of Hyperion’s body to the scabby wound partially covered by a folded wing. No blood was running from it, so he must not have ripped it open, but still a hurt was a hurt.
“And you thought Mycroft, Grand Master of the Aerie, would be on that list?” Sherlock said sounding incredulous.
“Shit,” John muttered, his pace accelerating, reaching for the tag with a speed that nearly unglued the eggy case from the table. Thankfully Sherlock’s laptop was still in the sitting room, since John’s was completely dead and unchargeable without its cables. He nervously tapped at the table as he waited for the computer to power on, looking back at the last text of ‘found killer’ with a fearful knot beginning to grow in his stomach.
“You mean he’s done that before?!”
“Have it with me, I can’t read your mind like her, I saw my flatmate about to commit suicide. What was it then?” John asked. Thinking about it again made him worried for Sherlock. So few people seemed concerned about what he did, what were the chances of a rider becoming depressed or even suicidal to the point of acting on it?
Sherlock bloody Holmes had knocked on his door at bloody five in the morning, told him that he’d taken matters into his own hands, and furiously began to pack up his stuff. Apparently, Holmes didn’t wait for anybody, especially John. With a hurried explanation and a less than excited demeanor, Holmes had managed to get John dressed and ready for a moving day.
Mary gets the treatment that they can’t afford. Whenever John visits, she assures him that she’s getting better. Sometimes he’ll bring the baby and Mary will hold her. They are happy for a short while. But John sees through all of it.
When his score played out at the wake, Sherlock internalized the soft vibratos and lilting decrescendos that was his father. It was painful to hear the last note cut off. Sherlock wanted the song to keep going, but he forced himself to believe that everything must end in its time. He thrust himself into his coursework, then his experiments, then the drugs.
Holmes groaned softly, “This water is divine.”
“I’ve got to introduce you to somebody.” Mike tossed the apple into the air. John caught it deftly and took a bite, “Come on, then.”
“Why do I even bother?” Stamford asked.
John was swept up in the moment for exactly seven seconds. You’d have to be blind not to realize that Holmes was one of the more attractive rowers in the sport. He’d been a household name ever since he won single sculls at Henley and second at World’s. He’d been on the cover of Rowing Magazine twice. Then there was the whole fiasco with ex-trainer, Victor Trevor.
Prick.
She would’ve loved Sherlock, she takes after him in that way too.
all the rowing stuff in the beginning - basically irrelevant, if you're curious, go ahead and ask but it's not going to prevent you from understanding where the story is going.
“I don’t kiss and tell.” Bill said.
John could never forget (it literally played over and over in his head) the Great Personal Space Invasion of 2017 when Holmes brushed his lips against John’s ear when reaching for the tea (which by the way still hadn’t been moved from the top cupboard). Bletchley Park didn’t have a fucking chance against this sort of shit.
“Tea?”
Mike laughed and introduced him to Sebastian Moran. John knit his eyebrows, why was he here again?
“My grandmother could carry that box up faster.” Holmes said, “God rest her soul.”
What a pretentious dick.
“You alright, Pres?” Kav came up to him, hair shaking as he rubbed a towel against his head. He held out a towel to John. John took it without hesitation and quickly wrapped it around his waist.
“Potential flatmates should know the worst about one another.” Holmes replied, fishing a phone out of the tight trousers he was wearing.
“Not now, Mrs. Delancey!” John shouted.
“Oi!”
Off-keys were outcasts in society, infinitely lost and indefinitely empty. Without their music playing in the halls, they walk around dazed, a faint memory of what they had once been. The loss of the music means the loss of everything. They ended up on the streets, peddling for food and money, never to return to society again.
Holmes’ brow furrowed.
“What?” John said through a mouthful of apple, “Right now?”
John usually woke up at four o’clock am, on the dot nothing less. He’d get up from his bed, stare at his desolate flat and sigh. After getting dressed, it was time to tiptoe through the hallways of the building, hoping to dear god he doesn’t come across anyone from downstairs. Sometimes (well, one time), he’d get up even earlier for something special.
“I need it! Come on, I’ve got a hot date tonight.” Kav pleaded.
“Who did you end up sleeping with, Mike?” John muttered.
In the same moment that John’s little body fell to the tough and unforgiving ground, not to move for the next nine minutes, his music began writing in the village hall. The concertmaster was pleased to tell his parents what he had written as, “A beautiful harmony! In the key of C! I can assure you, your little John is perfectly average.” John was fine, if not mildly concussed, and his parents spent more time being excited about his presentation than smothering him with concern.
Sherlock continued to sulk for the rest of the week. He’d still settle in next to John when he got tired and he’d stay near John when they were fish, but Sherlock would be grumpy about it and act like he didn’t want to and make excuses for why he decided to use John as a pillow. John watched Sherlock shuffle through his case e-mails and become flustered by his inability to go to the ones that looked genuinely interesting. His heart went out for Sherlock, he knew after weeks living with him how easily bored Sherlock got, the new discovery of being able to occupy his mind with the coding had been wonderful. John still fondly remembered the kisses Sherlock had showered on him.
John thought, sighing, and turning to the kitchen for a drink.
“And waste time while your people ruin the crime scene and the killer gets away? I only need five minutes,” Sherlock said, staring the officer down.
The video channel seemed to be a fan page: not all of the videos were from the same person, some were better quality than others, and some didn’t have audio at all or were just videos of Bellamy streaking across the sky. John was hooked.
“Oh er, Hyperion,” John said, looking up at Hyperion who was nearly eye-level with Shaw’s head.
Sherlock didn’t say anything and they continued to watch the snowfall over the Aerie. A light breezed touched the snow now and then, nothing harsh, and made the flurries swirl on their way down, like being in the snow globe on their mantel back at the flat. They watched as Snö’s harness was removed, lights and all, and the giant white dragon curled up under the warm glow of the string lights, taking on the appearance of a mountainous snowdrift at one end of the field.
“That’s about the best I’m going to get out of you, I expect. Say hello to Bellamy for me, I’d like to see the dear sometime soon,” she said with a small smile. “Anyway, carry on with what you were doing, and stop disturbing my charge.” Josie waved a dismissive hand towards Sally and the shoe before turning and going back out into the sand.
“Good, that’s good,” John said. “You had me worried that I was missing out on some kind of major bonding ritual.” Tom laughed his mood brightening again quickly.
“They wanted you,” John said just as quietly, like they were sharing secrets and someone might be able to hear their mental voices. Sherlock hugged a little tighter, feelings of sadness seeping across their contact.
“Mary, get down from there!” Sally chided, getting ready to get up and pull her off.
Right near his position, ducked behind the crown of the dead dragon’s head, a body dropped out of the sky, landing in a great huff of sand with a wet organic thump. John saw that the corpse, in its small crater, less than twenty feet from him, was the shattered remains of an enemy rider. He had been ripped from his harness and the remains of the belts still hung around his torso in tatters. Large tooth marks bled profusely into the sand from where a dragon had torn him free and slung him from his mount, not a common tactic, but one John had seen enough times to recognize the always disgusting result.
Mary had Hyperion put her down after that; she seemed to realize a moment had just passed between dragon and rider. She unhooked herself and put the hoop away before she started rolling the ball with him.
“That’s not what I meant and you know it,” John said realizing Sherlock had only mentioned Anthea in her position as First Officer to Mycroft, not as a closer romantic partner.
Sherlock suddenly lurched forward and John found himself wrapped up in long arms, Sherlock’s face inches from his. There was only a moment of hesitation as Sherlock’s eyes flicked from John’s mouth to his eyes and then the gap was closed. John felt soft lips press to his, slotting with his own mildly chapped ones. Sherlock’s head tilted and he sank further into John, holding him a little tighter as his lips tugged gently at John’s, repositioning with a sharp inhale and taking in as much of John as he could in that moment.
“Item one: there are more than twenty recorded instances of you landing outside of designated landing zones, including a few where your dragon flew unaccompanied. There are several counts of both minor and major damage to civilian property due to these unacceptable landings; the latest accounted for is the most severe on record. Item two: you have neglected your duties for the last several weeks and have only completed a handful of the tasks assigned to you since your last disciplinary hearing. Item three: a rather astonishing list of complaints from Aerie residents and riders that has only been growing longer as time passes.” Lestrade held up a thick folder of papers with little bits of sticky notes and tabs littering the edges. “These complaints include reports of unauthorized entry and interaction with another rider’s dragon while in their pit, destruction of Aerie property, vehicular theft, and multiple complaints of verbal abuse and slander.”
John thought, taking into account that the ceiling sat open above the pit beyond the window.
John felt like he should be insulted on Hyperion’s part at the tiny barb from Sherlock, even as he gave the bond they shared a nudge and found that the dragon was dozing again. Not completely asleep, but not awake enough to have caught any of John’s thoughts about the shards of information Sherlock had shared about his past. He decided to leave Hyperion to his rest, John would share it with him later.
“I would have liked to know what was in that book,” Sherlock said, watching the couple beyond the glass.
A massive yawn on Sherlock’s part broke the moment and caused John to chuckle before the contagious yawn caught him as well on a smaller scale.
“You’re just trying to butter me up,” John replied, relaxing under the pressure with a mental purr.
“The one at the top window with the long hair? She’s been here before, seems to like the sharks - and me,” Sherlock replied, toweling his hair dry.
John soon found out what ‘papercuts’ meant. For the first time since he’d been captured Paul opened the medical bag and John felt cool air hit his skin. Normally the fresh air would have been a lovely feeling, a cool balm after being too warm for too long, but under the effects of the drug everything was amplified to a ludicrous degree. The air felt like someone had stuck ice against his skin. Everything was overwhelming and John had no way to escape it.
“Internet, Sherlock.”
“Mmm, yes that would be a sound idea,” Sherlock murmured as he leaned across John to flick the dim table lamp off, plunging them deeper into darkness, the glow of street lamps the only illumination left.
“--Lover,” Sherlock said at the same time, both of their mouths snapping shut as they looked to one another. John watched a light blush start to rise on Sherlock’s cheeks and felt a matching warmth rise on his own face. Mrs Hudson simply looked pleased at the pair.
“Not in the slightest,” John replied, grinning up at him as he gripped onto Sherlock’s waist and held him still as he fucked hard upwards into him, giving him that ‘faster’ he’d wanted before.
“Shy Death?” John remembered the name of the poison well, he’d even taken some time to read up on them along with a few of the other toxic and corrosive things Sherlock liked experimenting on in the kitchen.
Sherlock sprinted, shouting directions back to John as he turned corners, down back alleys and dodged traffic a couple times.
John was a little shocked by that, the idea that if anything happened it almost instantly somehow got around the Aerie, but then it made him wonder, there were people that were interested in what Sherlock got up to?
John was startled awake by his own belly grumbling for food; he hadn’t eaten anything that morning beyond a small packet of crackers that came with his breakfast, and it was coming back to bite him. Frightened as he was, his body still complained for food. He crawled out of his safe spot to get to the cubby of food the crewman had showed him, and instantly regretted it. There was a sudden shift, which flung John into a (thankfully, padded) wall.
The woman standing at the door waved with a small, nearly inaudible, “Hello.” She carried enough equipment to nearly cover her; she had on a lab coat, lightly dirt-stained,with a small hip pack underneath. She carried a bulky backpack over one shoulder and a tool belt over the other, and she held a large sealed bucket in her free hand. The moment the knock came Hyperion’s head went up, staring right at her with a disconcerting intensity. John had to commend her on her bravery for still approaching with that severe of a gaze upon her.
Sherlock pulled John forward, heading right towards the black dragon that made John cower moments before. “Sherlock, I don’t need to meet it,” John protested, making an attempt to pull his wrist from Sherlock’s grasp.

“Watch me.” Sherlock doubled down on his threat. “I want to fly freely beyond the walls again, whether you do or not.” Determination shone in his eyes and that pleasant trill traveled John’s spine again as he barely licked his lips. Not quite sure what to say, but not wanting to give Sherlock the last word yet again, John held his stance. A not so small part of him liked having Sherlock so close.
“So what do we wanna do with this one?” the weaselly voice man asked above him, prodding at John with his shoe like John was some massive beached jellyfish to be poked at.
“Well, hello?” he mumbled, confused, propping himself up against Hyperion’s neck to look at the kids. They were staring at him now; they’d been chattering away right until he moved. John could hear little snippets: whispering. “That’s not Victor,” and “he’s got a new rider, guys.” Finally one voice piped up, a pair of hands appearing at the edge and another head pulling itself up to see him.
“If you don’t mind me asking, where did that phone come from?” John asked. Lestrade looked at him, as if he were surprised for John to ask him anything.
“I’d argue otherwise, but that’s not the question. I’ve got a person who wants to know how they can be a
Task finished Bellamy took a few steps forward, making to continue on her way with Sherlock still looking mildly flustered in the saddle. Her head swiveled to glance at Hyperion and she let out a very low juddering sound, a sweep of her head in the direction they were headed made it clearer to John that she was calling Hyperion to come along, and Hyperion did so, walking along nearby. The bond flooded with pride after a moment of them walking together; obviously having John on his back and the cooperation and communication with Bellamy had lifted Hyperion’s mood significantly.
“There must be a choir group around here somewhere who uses it,” John thought out loud.
The moment he got that belt on she crouched and lept. No moment to prepare, nothing, just an instant of a crouch and suddenly she was rocketing into the air, her breath bellowing out of her chest as she worked into the sky from a single jump. John clung on for dear life, scared and, quite frankly, helpless strapped to the back of the enraged dragon. Bellamy’s silver skin was hot to the touch as he gripped her neck and tried not to look down. She was off, like a hunting dog searching a fox; she knew where Sherlock had gone. John’s heart thundered away in his chest as he tried to breathe. He reminded himself he had to do this to save a man’s life, to save
“You know morse code,” Sherlock replied as though that answered John’s implied question.
“They really want to hear about you and Bellamy,” John said, as Sherlock sat peering down the microscope he had placed on their kitchen table.
“Yeah, usually the small amounts they can’t taste it, but when we have to up the dosage they tend to do that afterwards,” Tom said, coming up beside John. “But you see, he wouldn’t hurt you ever during a feeding.” He scraped one of his grimy hands down the side of John’s face, trying to help rub off some of the crud from the meat. Unfortunately it was sort of matted into that side of his hair already, along with the sweat of being active for the first time in a while.
“You wicked fish,” John murmured with a smirk of his own, still rolling his hips to the rhythm Sherlock set.
John sat and grumbled at the morning light for a moment before grabbing his robe and shuffling downstairs for a morning coffee. Sherlock was energetic, tapping his heel restlessly against the rug as he sat in his chair watching John make coffee.
“What are these for?” John asked lifting the blankets in his arms. He realized Sherlock was setting up blankets to sleep on the mat next to Bellamy.
“‘Cause I was there when you didn’t.”
“Hello John. I heard you were looking for me,” Helen said. He could see her better now; she had a lovely face with a dark complexion and long black hair streaked with grey done back in a ponytail, and she was smiling at him.
“Come on Hyperion, she’s not going to hurt you,” he told him gently, raising his hand towards him, even though Hyperion held his head rigidly far out of reach. That was all John could do, with no training on how one would make a dragon do anything it didn’t want to do. He looked over to Lestrade for guidance. The Master only gestured for him to continue.
“Thank you, Angelo, I’ll make sure he gets it,” John said, picking up the handles and heading off.
John just swung his other leg over and let himself slide down Hyperion’s back to dismount, keeping a steadying hand on Hyperion as he walked around him more for his own comfort than Hyperion’s now.
Neither of them had changed out of the day’s clothes yet but John doubted that would have stopped Sherlock from just grabbing his coat and wondering out. Weeks together had so far shown him that Sherlock’s modesty levels were almost hilariously low. The bit with the barely covering towel in those first days had not been an act exactly, he’d come downstairs a handful of times already to find Sherlock lounging wrapped up in only a bed sheet, or sitting at the kitchen table with a sheet pooling down in his lap and his lean bare back to the door, or sitting in his pyjama bottoms in odd places around the flat. John had watched him throw his coat on over a pair of pants and an undershirt and button it up to walk out of the flat, John only hoped he was only making a quick trip to see Bellamy.
A squeeze from Sherlock brought John’s mind back to the present.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “I’ve seen your arse, your ankles, and your scar. You have tan lines from your pants and your shoes and your head, neck, and forearms have a slightly darker tan than the rest of you. No idiot wears their clothes to a tanning bed, and you don’t seem the type to use one anyway,
“The belt, Sherlock,” John spat at him, still fighting to remain calm.
Sherlock’s eyes refocused on John. "No, I merely saved a woman’s life, I didn’t catch her captor,” he said.
John remained right at Hyperion’s head as Molly continued her work once the anesthetic kicked in, stitching the open wound back together with an extra large curved needle. Hyperion’s face eventually did go lax; though his breathing remained a little on the quick and shallow side and he refused to watch Molly now, golden eyes more content with staring unhappily at John. John continued to talk to him, plying him with comforting words and quiet praises. Molly taped the large strips of gauze over the stitches, creating a smaller covering than what Kandahar had done. She checked the area over one more time then hopped off, giving Hyperion’s side a pat as she went.
John hoped.
“Relax for me,” John said, hooking an arm under one of Sherlock’s knees and pushing it up towards Sherlock’s chest, exposing him a little better. Sherlock’s deep chuckles continued at the tiny bit of manhandling, his other knee drawing up as well.
There will be a one-shot sequel featuring Leopard Seal!Jim and Tiger Shark!Sebbie. I can't say exactly when I will get around to writing it, but it is in the works.
He leaned up and pecked Sherlock on the cheek.
He pulled the trigger and the grey haired man stumbled and crumpled to the ground. John’s fear for Sherlock’s life diminished greatly the moment he saw the killer fall, but he couldn’t see if Sherlock’s hand was empty. The shot had startled the detective, but had the pill pressed to his lips been swallowed?
The room went quiet for a moment and John chose that time to make his presence known. He wasn’t quite prepared for the sight in the sitting room. A slightly fat man sat on the couch with an open first aid kit by his side. There was a tall skinny man sitting on the cleared coffee table covered in smears of bright red blood. His curly dark mop of hair was plastered down with it. The fat man was cleaning a cut across a pale swath of the back of his shoulder. Stunningly blue eyes turned to him the moment he stepped around the door, locking onto John as though reading him like a book the moment he laid those icy eyes on him.
Sherlock let out another larger sigh and settled in, laying down a little more comfortably on the curve of the log bench. John smiled at him, thankful that Sherlock wasn’t putting up much of a fight, a testament to how tired he really must be feeling.
It wasn’t that John wasn’t upset about his means of communication during the daytime going back to nil, just that he didn’t see much of a point getting as physically huffy about it as Sherlock. He kept his anger inside for now and focused on getting Sherlock to settle for the night. If John had the chance he honestly felt he would love to slap the elder Holmes with his tailfin. Seeing as that was unlikely to happen though, John simply sighed and dragged Sherlock away from their tank and settled in elsewhere in the aquarium to eat their nightly ration of fast food.
“He’s just a bit upset is all; you’re delaying the bonding time and that doesn’t usually happen so he might be a little confused and gloomy about it, but just keep to your promise and come back and he’ll be happy as a clam again.” John could tell that Omar was definitely trying to make John feel better again, but that wasn’t really helping; if anything it made him feel slightly worse. “Besides, you’ll have your chance to sit and bond with him all you like over the next few days and during your flight home.” He grinned at John.
“Tickled you,” John finished with a small smile.
“No, Hyperion’s got some rehab to go through, but we have gotten back dragons with worse injuries than him and kept them. Yes, we do have transfers, but usually they are of their own volition.” He shot a quick glare at Sherlock over his shoulder before returning focus to the wide empty hall.
“Want me to rut on you with my big human cock?” John said, unable to keep the glee and laughter out of his voice even as the swell of a well endowed penis grew from between his legs prodding insistently at Sherlock below.
“This is Dr John Watson, sir, we’re here looking for his dragon.” John’s escort replied for him. “What was his name, Dr Watson?”
“Yes, now, line up and wait patiently for further instructions,” she ordered in clipped tones. The whole group scuttled to obey; the small girl ended up at the back of their line.
John was aware of another human touching him and wanted nothing more than to beat the hand away. “Sherlock,” called a voice, “Sherlock get over here!” it shouted making John’s mind reel again at the proximity and volume. A mind suddenly met his own. Not the vague feelings from human touches, a whole Mollisian mind. The mind shied away after the first contact and John clung to it, begging it not to leave him to the pain and screaming again.
“If that works for you,” He chuckled, getting back up off the bed. “Say it again.” John ordered as he went to get the box where their toys were stored.
“I’m still mad at you,” John’s thought spoke through their connection; to anyone else they still looked like a pair of smushed together jellies.
“You’re not a berk,” John said, still staring ahead, no longer really watching the kettle but just letting his eyes go to the green tiles of the backsplash.
“You’re just going to release them into the wild?” John asked skeptically. Off the top of his head he could think of a few ways that could go spectacularly wrong, not least of which would be if they decided to venture towards civilization and attack people.
Sherlock shot him a worried glance. “I can fix that.”
“But what about the connections?” John asked back, ignoring his stomach.
Omar seemed to notice and slowed a bit to fall back next to John, “He’ll be okay with us, you know, we’ve been taking good care of him,” he told him, trying to sound reassuring as he clapped John on the back.
“Sherlock?” John whispered at him trying to sit up, but pinned in the taller man’s arms. A small snore greeted him. In the moment’s after Sherlock’s head hit the bench, he had passed out asleep with a silly grin on his face and John in his arms on what certainly was not the most comfortable bench. “Well, great.”
"He's been an perturbing presence for ages, long before you arrived, how could I not investigate further?" Sherlock said, staring off into the sand of Bellamy's pit, where she had begun to partially bury herself. A cool blue eye glanced down at John, "it's like you don't know me at all, John," he added, lightly nudging John's shoulder.
“How old is Bellamy?”
“And.”
John knew the heavy penitent feeling wouldn’t last very long. Sherlock would bounce back to his usual self soon enough, but for now he lazed under the warm contact. Sherlock’s mind was washing over his own with soft feelings of apology and affection, joyful at John’s submission letting Sherlock touch him so thoroughly, short of getting inside of him.
Hyperion’s end of the bond rang,
“You might not have said it but you sure seem to be trying awful hard, and I’m staying put.” John honestly liked the flat: it was nice and cozy, Mrs Hudson and Angus downstairs were good company, and Sherlock, for all his oddities, was fascinating to be around.
Sherlock didn’t seem to have an immediate answer for John’s question as he continued his tending. “Bored, thinking,” Sherlock replied, “contemplating when I should approach you about installing more greenery in Hyperion’s pit,” Sherlock expanded further, as if he knew what John was about to ask.
“I was out having breakfast with Mrs Hudson and picking up groceries this morning,” John replied, quickly realizing that Sherlock had probably not noticed John was gone and just made a note to thin air. It was nice to know that Sherlock was talking to him, but it all became moot if John wasn’t even around to hear it.
“Good morning dear, you’ve had people asking after you all morning, I was hoping you’d be by soon,”
“You are his lapdog now; I don’t want your interrogating,”
Then it clicked: the fact that Sherlock wouldn’t say Victor’s name, that he insisted that John stay away from his room, his attitude when John touched him. Hyperion was awake on the other end of the bond, his mind watching John’s emotions shift, seemingly ready to push a blanket of calm comfort onto John should the situation need it.
The call was indeed short: after the initial shock of hearing John’s voice on the phone Harry had started yelling at him to get his arse back home, sounding a little slurred. John managed to finally tell her that he was home, that he was at the Aerie. When she asked rather sloppily what he was doing in one of those big firey lizard places he finally told her he was a rider, that he had a firey lizard of his own now. There was an extremely long silence, the only way John knew she was still on the line was that he could hear her breathing and it sounded like the telly was on in the background. She suddenly sniffed really loudly and John heard a muffled sob before the call hung up. John looked at the mobile for a moment, a little stunned by the sudden and strange hang up.
If John hadn’t already been the subject of some crazy mystical shit over the past few months he would not have believed what happened next. She began reading something off the pages, a language John couldn’t even begin to recognize, but he could see the shark man’s face fall as she started, a look of horror crossing his eyes.
albino one.”
“I couldn’t very well let you die, and to hell with your brother. I don’t care if he’s a Grand Master. ‘Love is a defect’, what rot is that? I bet he cares very much for Damir, bet he cried like a baby when he bonded with him.”
“You didn’t think I’d notice when you went quiet in the middle of a conversation?” Sherlock said arching an eyebrow.
“Well, you’re still sporting some impressive morning wood there,” John replied with a mildly wicked chuckle, pushing his arse back into Sherlock’s hips.
“Not when they are in over their heads, which is almost always, and what they’re claiming is suicide is in fact a murder,” Sherlock smirked, pushing the door open and stepping through. John followed him in, the reveal that Sherlock had involved him in a murder investigation and the dragon resting on the other side of the door shocked him into crying “murder?” as Sherlock pushed him through and shut the door behind him.
John was drawn along with him. It was almost impossible not to with how deeply they had twined together. His own orgasm hit him in throbbing pulses making all his extremities clench, toes curled and hands fisted into Sherlock’s skin as he tightened around Sherlock capturing him in a hard hug. It was all a bit like experiencing a multi-staged firework exploding, a pause as the shell reached its apex, a great earth-shaking boom, followed quickly by a series of smaller intense cracks; then the echoing wave of sound afterwards in the silence.
John knew for a fact that it wasn’t impossible to get out of a medical bag if one fought with it hard enough; they weren’t impenetrable force fields or anything quite so high tech. However, fighting his way free of one meant that he needed to be clear of whatever drug these men were using on him. John’s skin gave a faint ripple; he didn’t want to feel like he had when that first dart hit him ever again.
“Don’t you dare,” John snapped at him, taking the towel from him and finally wrapping it around his waist. Much as he wanted to continued drying Sherlock off, he wanted something between his arse and the cold slimy concrete.
John’s eyebrow rose, “Yes?”
John finally emptied his duffle and looked at the final piece he’d need to hide, his gun. He’d smuggled the Browning home hidden amongst his clothes and things and had not thought about it the entire time he’d been in the Aerie. There was no evidence that anything would happen to him within the Aerie’s walls that would even begin to warrant the keeping of the gun. He’d felt perfectly safe beside Hyperion, and yet John felt he needed it around now that his dragon was out of sight. He shoved it into the bottom drawer of the bedside table and covered it with an old shirt.
As if in apology for disrupting their snogging with his stomach John leaned over and kissed Sherlock again once he was clothed, wrapping a hand around the back of his skull to hold him close, weaving fingers into the short hair at the nape of Sherlock’s neck. John continued to let his hands wander through Sherlock’s hair even after they parted for air.
“Oh god, I’m going to have to go through that feeling like I’m having a heart attack again aren’t I?” John said with a groan, suddenly remembering what turning into a fish had entailed last time.
“I can do it myself, you know,” John said a little indignant at the manhandling while also a smidge conscious of where Sherlock’s hands were on his body even through layers of clothes.
Thank you all again so so much for reading this silly fishy fic.
“He’s stiff from staying in one position for too long, and any painkillers he had at Kandahar have most likely worn off long ago,” Lestrade replied, walking around Hyperion’s legs. “He can make it, just take it slow. He can rest and lean on a wall if he wants, no laying down again until he’s in his pit. I get a feeling once he’s down he’s staying there for a while.”
Sherlock responded by flattening himself even further over John, melting onto him as much as possible without completely encasing John inside himself. They looked rather like a jelly ravioli like this, a pale yellow exterior with a red filling. The various analogies to earth food that their physical appearance and contact looked like were not lost on John, who rippled a little pushing upwards into the blanket that was Sherlock.
“What on earth is it, Sherlock, it’s the middle of the day! Shouldn’t you be out at your classes with John or something?” He asked as Cherie came skittering out and around Sherlock’s ankles, the small dragon finally settling for grabbing a trouser cuff in her mouth, tugging till he shook her off.
“I am on a case, you are my assistant.”
“You try though, petulant blotling,” John teased.
Next thing he knew, Tom’s big arm was around John’s shoulders. “Hey, it’s not a big deal,” Tom said quietly. “I’m sure we can help you out, and you’ve got Hyperion himself too. Bet you’ve only flown regular passenger flights; I’ve been told those are nothing like flying with the dragon you’re bonded to.” Hyperion had felt John’s distress and the bond lit with comfort, ‘it will be okay’ and ‘you can do it’ reassurance. John pulled his hand away and looked over to see Hyperion paying attention to them rather than seeking out food smells.
“I-I really wasn’t hurting him I swear,” John said, covering his face with a hand in embarrassment at what he was about to admit. “Just was tickling him to get him to talk to me, s’all,” he mumbled.
“Well, he’s in the family. Hummers are just what we call the little ones about his size, they’re the hummingbirds of dragon-kind. Course there are some even smaller than him in the books now, but they didn’t know about them when that nickname came about, and it's just sort of stuck,” she said “There are others here if you look for them,” Mrs Hudson added directing John to look out at the still fairly full late lunch crowd. John hadn’t noticed them before, but she was right: there were at least a handful of draconic faces tucked around the legs of their respective humans. Most of them looked very different from Angus though a few he spotted looked similar.
“Well, best be off, classes to do,” he said quickly not looking at John.
He stayed there for an immeasurable amount of time, floating between a rock and the wall trying to stay away from prying eyes. Food did rain down at some point and John ate none of it, the other actual fish gobbling up squid parts and pellets perfectly happily.
past lovers,” Sally said calmly, with a certain level of acidity ingrained in her words. Both Sherlock’s and Bellamy’s heads sharply turned to look down at her as Melinda proceeded to walk away out towards the open field, a small cluster of sheep scattering before her.
John shared what happened while Sherlock was out cold after they finished eating. Sherlock was still a little groggy from the chloroform but otherwise paying attention.
“Now, you’re going to stay here and bond for the next couple of days. The farthest you’re allowed to get from him is the public bath down the hall. You can bathe in the fountain over there if you want, we’ll shut the doors, you’ll both have privacy--” Lestrade started listing off what John would be doing for his first days at the Aerie, when Lestrade’s phone beeped in his pocket. He paused and pulled it out.
“Er, you’d be able to tell better than me si- Greg.” The Master should know these things better than the novice.
His driver chuckled at the stunned expression on John’s face, “You’ve never been to an Aerie before have you?” he asked, grinning.
John thought.
“Mr. Holmes! Mr. Holmes!” John looked up from his lunch at the approaching nestling sprinting as fast as possible through the crowded chairs and tables of the cafeteria. The young boy reached for Sherlock’s arm, tugging on his coat sleeve, a bit winded but none the worse for wear. “Mr. Holmes!”
“... clothes got picked up by lost n’ found again,” John heard the man grumble, his deep baritone carrying even as it roughened with a cough at the end. He quickly slunk forward to move behind the nude man.
“Master Lestrade said he needs you, says it’s urgent,” he said. Sherlock sniffed and started to turn back to the sandwich John had picked for him. “He said I need to bring you now, drag you there if I have to, I know you’re a rider but Master’s orders,” the boy’s fingers clamped onto Sherlock’s coat cuff, already starting to pull the attached arm with him before Sherlock could stand up.
“Calcium powder mostly, with a few more vitamins mixed in. Dr Hooper’s blend for the dragons. They all get this in their diet, Hyperion’s just getting a bit extra for now. Easier to give it all at once.” Tom led John towards Hyperion with their load between them. Hyperion didn’t snap at the offering; the hunger crossing the bond had lessened significantly and in the presence of John’s brief bout of nerves Hyperion appeared to be moving extra slowly just for him, gold eye trained on John rather than the biggest chunk of meat in the meal.
John had charged up the stairs ahead of them and was in the kitchen, stripping himself of his clothes now that he was in the confines of his own home and deforming into his natural state, not caring if Lestrade saw. He set about angrily making tea, tendrils and limbs extending off of his primary mass to slam down a full kettle to boil while reaching for the tea bags and mugs.
“No, damnit, no!” John shouted from his place on the floor, writhing against the ties at his wrists. No way was he just sitting there and letting this happen, Sherlock was coming home with him as a man, fuck if he had gills and they were stuck at the aquarium, at least he would have a human form.
a horrible part of him whispered. For all John knew Sherlock was still sitting in a petulant ball at 221b and the only other hope he had would be if Mycroft had a wild hair and checked the CCTV cameras nearby.
“Well, um, well, er, not good to stress him and try to fly too soon, right?” John fumbled for any excuse that could work beyond, ‘I’m bloody terrified of leaving the ground on his back!’
John thought,
“No, no, we’ve never had anything like this before. Just your run of the mill bomb threats.” Lestrade replied, rubbing his temple tiredly, “We have to treat the possibility of explosives as a real threat on the Aerie. Traffic stops, nothing in or out, that kind of thing. This woman could be anywhere, packed into a shipping container rigged to explode midair or wherever they land France, the US, China, we have people flying out all over the world. We just don’t know. And the fact that Sherlock’s a loose cannon in this situation makes it even more difficult.” Lestrade pulled out his mobile.
John’s brain hazily supplied. He tried to focus more on a face, but in the dim lighting he still struggled to make much out. He opened his mouth again only to emit a few more dry coughs that made the aching pain beginning to radiate across his chest worse.
“We have to get him on a regimen, exercise, diet, the lot,” he said, as though he was already forming up a checklist in his mind of what needed to be scheduled and what resources it would take to get Hyperion healthy and back in the sky. He looked to John. “You’re going to be his support through this. I know you’re new to everything, but you start getting any weird feelings off of him you let one of us know.” Lestrade pointed between himself and Molly, “or Sally.”
“I’ve seen the real riders in action,” John replied, watching Hyperion gently hook the ring with one of the talons on his good arm and transfer the ring from mouth to claw, Mary swinging with a giggle the entire time. “I don’t see myself doing that anytime soon.”
Lunch came at some point, John didn’t care to look at the time. A young man in an apron had knocked on the smaller door set into the bottom of the large ones and stepped in quietly. The only way John became aware of his presence at all was through Hyperion, whose mind gave a quick spike of activity, before he realized that the intruder was just carrying a box full of human food and went back to resting.
“People will talk,” Sherlock murmured as a crooked smile appeared on his face, his hand gripped John’s.
Of course Sherlock knew something was up the moment John reappeared. John tried to act cool and brushed the suspicion off with an admission to the fact that he hadn’t checked his own e-mail in nearly a week. Sherlock eyed him for a moment before giving up and going back to his screen.
Those intelligent blue eyes still intently focused on John, Sherlock cut him off, lips forming the words, “Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“You’re walking home alone if you don’t stop,” Sherlock grumbled even though he still maintained the warm grip on John’s arm.
and beyond, John smashed it.
Wherever they were there were flashing lights nearby and John slowly peeled open his eyes, hands still keeping their death grip on Sherlock’s coat. They were near a row of run down houses, their fronts covered in scaffolding, Police cars with red and blue lights flashing away were the only things occupying the street outside a ring of police tape.
“What was that?” he asked back.
was a prominent thought, Sherlock smelled like Bellamy, and John grinned as he came closer to recognizing a feeling similar to a crush humming quietly on the bond. Hyperion wanted the plants because they had once been Bellamy’s more than just for the added creature comfort of new greenery.
She was restless. The moment he saw her it was evident, even with his limited knowledge, that she was agitated. She paced her enclosure, looking at the purpling sky, tail whipping as she made low hissing grumbles. She turned sharply to face him the moment he entered with an equally razor-edged hiss. He put the laptop down and raised his hands instantly.
The next night was the first time John was awakened by a nightmare from Hyperion. It felt very similar to his own dreams of falling, but instead he was watching others, watching dragon upon dragon being raked out of the sky, wings ripped from bodies, long slender necks sliced and only barely connected by bone and scales, blood spurting and trailing like crimson ribbons behind screaming corpses, panic and fear becoming overwhelming as nothing could be done to stop them being cut from the air and falling to a sickening crunching death, viscera exploding into blossoms of red on sandy ground. And then a human fell past his vision trailing blood. The burst of pain as the human hit the ground woke John.
John lamented the lack of gills only here, missing the fact that he hadn’t needed to surface for air before, they could have stayed locked at the lips gills working the air for them. But alas, John had to breathe he separated and sat up again.
“Sherlock, tell me what is going on,” John said calmly.
“I do like it better, singing draws more attention,” Sherlock replied quietly.
“Shush, I’m only getting the tea,” Sherlock murmured, feeling John’s unwillingness to part. He gave John a firm squeeze before he shifted away, but he never completely broke contact. He left a tiny tendril of himself pressed against John all the way from the kitchen. John knew that was a rather extreme stretch of a single bit of Sherlock’s mass and felt a twinge of guilt at his insecurities making Sherlock do that while he was also getting things from the kitchen.
“But you-”
The soldier remark stung a little and once Sherlock had pointed it out John realized how hypocritical the sniper comment had been, of course not all soldiers were bloodthirsty killers and plenty went home to their families and lived relatively normal lives beyond the work. “So, Moran is just Jim’s, what? Boyfriend?”
“Oh, no thank you,” he declined politely, “I should be heading back to Cherie, she’s a little distraught over doing Sherlock an injury. Bloody genius startled her sneaking around the veterinary complex at all hours of the night.” Mike cast a small scowl towards the sitting room.
“You and I talked one time.”
John could hear the small note of hurt that tinged Sherlock’s voice even though his face read annoyance. He stood up. “Yes, fine,” he said with a sigh. “What exactly were you planning to do today, something about exercise?” He said wandering past Sherlock, reaching for his own coat and passing Sherlock’s over as well.
“Sorry about that,” he mumbled, offering a hand to help John sit up.
“He might be upstairs in the labs, might want to check there.” She pointed back the way John came. Molly directed him across the hall to the elevator and stairs up to the first floor, where the various labs were set up. The small dragon hospital’s layout being fairly straightforward, with a singular long hall down the length of the building, made it fairly easy to look around. The ground floor consisted of a series of offices in the front followed by exam rooms and further down the hall the building opened up into little padded stalls closer in size to ones seen in a normal barn.
“I don’t care. I
“Dr. John Hamish Watson, welcome to London Aerie,” Mycroft announced, his voice carrying well in the amphitheater-like bowl the room created. “You’ve been called here that we, your superiors, might better get to know the man who made the first successful field bond in the last fifty years.”
“Sherlock, is it safe to come closer?” John called, noticing that Bellamy was glaring at him the moment he entered the room. There wasn’t an immediate answer to his question and for a moment John thought Sherlock might actually be asleep, until with a small gasp he opened his eyes as if waking from a trance.
“I wouldn’t dream of it, I’m not a prick. Talking about a veteran's issues behind his back is just plain low,” Tom replied seriously. “However, I will tell them the bit about you not being in a firefight when you found him; the guys in the cafeteria have been wanting to know something new about you since we heard about Hyperion coming back.” The smirk grew on his fuzzy face. That startled a bark of laughter from John.
“You know how Jim seems a little off?” John asked, surely the most observant man in the world couldn’t have missed the unsettling energy that seemed to radiate from Jim the closer one was in proximity to him, especially when Sherlock was around. John might not be the most observant but he could tell Jim had some kind of thing for Sherlock, he didn’t know what, but those dark eyes were focused on Sherlock with an eerie level of concentration nearly any time John saw the man. If John didn’t know better he’d say it was a hunger he saw in those stares.
John didn’t want Sherlock to pull back into himself just yet. He wasn’t angry with him now, just wanted to know what Sherlock wanted to tell him. “Stay calm,” he stroked lightly over Sherlock soothingly, “how about you tell me what you did?” John suggested, keeping up the loving even pressure on the side of Sherlock not pressed to him.
A faint scraping noise reached his ears through the window at this back and John had to break the staredown to look at the dragon outside. A large black eyeball met him. Damir had gotten up and, trailing coins out of the sand behind him, had decided to crawl up and peek into his rider’s window. The massive black eye up close was frightening against the stark white skin and horns, the iris so dark that it was indiscernible from pupil, giving John a black void to stare into. John startled at the sudden close proximity, edging closer to the table so that he faced both the rider and the white dragon.
“Stay awake boy!” the woman’s voice shouted at him much closer now; she was out of her saddle hanging off of her dragon’s harness as it helped Hyperion stay up in the air.
“Sherlock’s brother, yes.” Mycroft replied.
“Nothing too excessively violent, but after getting all manner of things from eggs to apples thrown at you, one tends to take precautions.” Sherlock stabbed the hard boiled egg on his sparsely covered plate. “The last one was months ago, cold tea dumped down the back of a shirt isn’t exactly pleasant.” John looked at his own steaming cup of tea for a moment at that; no wonder Sherlock seemed a bit cautious.
Dinner came shortly after, and Hyperion, flopped and full as he was, didn’t try to beg for any of his sausage and onions. John’s last act before the sun went down was to meet with his therapist; she ran him through his exercises and seemed pleased with his progress. She helped him remove Hyperion’s bandages like Molly had instructed before leaving. The sun slipped away, leaving a quiet night to take over and with Hyperion settled back down and comfortable with his wounds bared to air out, John fell asleep, curled against Hyperion’s warm neck. No surprise tall figures in the halls that night.
John thought as the pale white buttocks plopped down on the concrete seat.
“I’ll send for someone to bring you a few changes of clothes and necessities,” Henry told him as Luke set about gently rearranging the hatchling on the padding. With that they left the new rider alone to settle.
“Why?” He asked, confusing John for a moment.
“What the--” was about all he got out before the man swiftly raised one of John’s wrists to his mouth and bit him just hard enough to draw blood. John screamed as the lunatic vaulted to standing and proceeded to run while John cradled his bloodied wrist. John levered himself up and ran on shaky legs to find the first aid kit. After properly washing, disinfecting and wrapping the wound John set out to find the crazy nude bitey man running loose in the aquarium, but he saw neither hide nor hair of him for the rest of the night.
“That’s Ian’s car.” Lestrade replied, jumping out of the jeep closely followed by John.
Jim’s grip on her cheek seemed to harden slightly making Sebbie’s eyes focus on Jim instead. “Ah ah, none of that,” Jim told her, “you’ll always be my big pretty tiger,” she leaned in and planted a quick peck of a kiss right between Sebbies light eyebrows.
John watched as Sherlock stared resolutely forward at the desk to John’s left rather than directly at him even as a tiny twitch of a smile formed on his lips. It was almost like Sherlock’s face didn’t know how to handle the conflicting emotions, enjoying John’s complement and still retaining his defensive attitude.
“He’s solved it, that puzzle the person wanted him to find, he’s got the answer now,” John said seeing Sherlock hit send on his phone beside him. A moment passed where John could only hear the muffled sounds of the Aerie on the other end of the line.
“As far as you know,” Sherlock said raising an eyebrow with a smirk, “besides, they usually talk when helping with Bellamy. I’ve been curious about Jim for years now, that’s plenty of time to have multiple nestlings rotate through her pit and they are very observant given the right incentives.”
“It’s still not good to go repeating things like that, what if someone overheard?”
“I’ll be back,” John reassured as he hauled himself from the mat, giving Hyperion’s nose a farewell pat. As he ambled towards the door Hyperion pushed a soft hope for his safety, not exactly a pure worry, just a light thought that translated into ‘be careful, small, easy to hurt’. John pushed back with his own reassurance before leaving and heading off towards the cafeteria.
John thought in a moment of nerves, as Lestrade left him standing before them. Lestrade took a seat at the end of the table. John glanced around for Sherlock and found the man had stopped at the top rows of chairs and taken a seat next to the door, as if he were ready to get up and leave at a moments notice.
“I’m not finished exercising Bellamy yet!” Sherlock replied still sounding petulant over being forced to land.
The next few days were far more enjoyable; their newfound relationship giving them something to do with their night time hours beyond the dwindling amount of research Sherlock could do on the computer. There was only so much even Sherlock could do with nothing to go on, so he would maybe solve a couple of cases from his website, then grump for a little bit about not being able to figure out this fish problem, before John would lead him away from the screens and they’d cuddle up in their alcove for the night.
“What about your friend here?” John asked, nodding his head at Tartan Scarf’s knocked-out cohort. The man just grunted and shrugged.
“I’m getting you home,” John decided, walking up to the huge head and reaching up to stroke the large scaled cheek. There was a stuttering rumble of what seemed like appreciation and John felt something click, like a light was flicked on in his head. Warmth spread through him, a content feeling radiating at the back of his skull. There was also stinging pain and an absolutely crippling burst of sadness that made John jerk his hand back as if burned.
“Good, turn the lights off on your way out,” Sherlock said, thankfully not looking back and not seeing the light blush coloring John’s face. And with that Sherlock flopped into his nest of blankets, wedging himself against Bellamy’s leg and burying himself until only the black mop of his hair was visible, underlit by the faint glow of a smartphone. That was that then, Sherlock’s unsubtle way of ending a conversation.
“Aaah, you’re the one that got carried in. Good to see you up and about. Follow me,” he said turning and walking off, obviously expecting the pair of them to follow his massive strides.
“I met Mycroft today,” John said quietly, swallowing, just now realizing how extraordinarily rude he’d been to a Master,
Sherlock glanced over his shoulder, blinking up at John. “Why don’t we go back in there, get dressed, and relax. You just had a really stressful moment Sherlock, lying in a cold bathtub isn’t helping, is it?” Sherlock looked down again, taking a moment to try to think before he started to shift. John smiled as Sherlock sat up, bunching the towel in his lap self-consciously.
“No, I said he considers me an enemy; he does love to be dramatic,”
“I… guess,” John replied slowly, “I’m not sure how yours is satisfied though, or did I just imagine the incident last week where you stood up in the middle of class and hijacked the whiteboard in order to solve a problem for a case rather than, you know, waiting and doing it at home, or using your phone for that matter. You like to know things now, not ten minutes from now. What’s so different about this whole Jim business that you aren’t champing at the bit to fiddle the details out of him?”
“Snow?”
“You’re awake now, I can tell,” whispered an irish accent near his ear, Jim. A part of John curled up in a tiny defensive ball at the sound of that sadistic voice so close to his head. “You hurt my Sebbie, you know what happens to people who hurt her?” John really didn’t want to know the answer to that question, considering what he’d already seen of the pair he was sure whatever it was wasn’t good.
“I wanted to ask you a question,” John started, holding up the laptop cables in his fist for Sherlock to see. “How did you know I needed these?” Sherlock’s face closed off, the raised eyebrows of attentiveness flattening out. John swore he could almost see his eyes darken and dart for the bedroom door visible beyond John’s shoulder. “Sherlock, answer the question, I swear if I have to pin you down to get you to answer I’ll do it.” There was a glint in Sherlock’s blue eyes, challenge accepted, and Sherlock rose from his chair.
“Do you do this all the time?” John asked quietly.
John shifted away again, with a grumpy ripple of his skin, going back towards the kitchen and his angrily made tea, leaving Sherlock with a wide orange splotch along one side.
John tried reasoning with himself,
John still wasn’t looking forward to morning even with that reassurance.
“Drivel,” Sherlock snorted. “This is something Bellamy can do. She hasn’t flown in weeks now; her feedings have been backed off with her inactivity. She is restless,” Sherlock said, as though Bellamy’s restlessness were his own, tapping fingers and overall appearing to nearly be vibrating out of his skin with the urge to get up and walk around but staying put.
The rest of the bonding carried on fairly quietly. The next day, breakfast woke John again and Hyperion woke early enough to sit and ‘talk’ his thoughts, his feelings and curiosities flowing over John’s mind as he ate. John spoke to him plenty, still much more used to using his words to speak and get his point across, much easier than speaking with his mind. The bond continued to strengthen. It was as if while they slept their minds had grown closer, making it so much easier for John to feel the bond and get the images and memories from Hyperion.
“Nah, I was flying with him just a moment ago…” he sighed and began to cough. “Don’t need pictures when I’ve got him with me all the time, do I?” He rattled after the coughing fit had died down leaving his lips spattered with drops of scarlet.
“Ah, well maybe I’ll take you up on that sometime,” John said feeling his face warm at the thought.
“I’m people, Sherlock,” John replied pointing out the obvious.
“Wrong position?” John asked lightly, holding still.
“Well, if you don’t eat a lot and look skinny as a rail like you do, people tend to do that,” John said, following suit with his own soup.
“The trio have been together now for nearly three years, I would hope so. Irene was sent out roughly the same time as Hyperion.” John noticed that Sherlock still wasn’t saying Victor’s name, substituting Hyperion’s instead.
But he didn’t die. Moments passed where he floated, his eyes opened to blurry blue and black shapes. When he went to blink again he found that he couldn’t. Instead, the blurry shapes began to gain clarity as if someone had slipped a pair of goggles over his eyes and drained the water from them. A fish bumped him and he rolled, the pain gone and replaced by the instinct to swim and try to go upwards. But he was stuck, he couldn’t feel his limbs.
“What was that?” she asked.
“Ah,” Sherlock’s hips rolled into him again, as though they had a mind of their own, “It does have a poor sense of timing.” The dark chuckle that followed vibrated through John’s back and he felt it inside his own chest, the feeling making him bite his lip. “Would you like to help teach it some?” Sherlock whispered in John’s ear, the playfulness easily audible, making John grin at the corny line.
“No, Commander Sally,” they chorused, pulling their packs on. They all grabbed their plates as well and started off towards the door in a line, little Mary at the back as before.
Then John saw it, a blue glow through a window high on the wall. A faint thing through the grungy corrugated plastic panel but definitely a blue glow. It flared, bright like a flash of lightening and then, almost as suddenly as it appeared, it vanished and the building was a dark shape again. That was enough to get John on his feet, screw the plan, screw the fact that he had no weapons, and screw Mycroft. John was going inside now, a glance at the clock again only spurred him on; forty five minutes was long enough in his book.
“It’s not like there’s much else to do,” John replied, with a smile to combat Sherlock’s dark mood.
Sherlock was quiet for a moment, thinking. John could see it in his face.
John saw the intruders first as they changed back into their human forms: the woman, the one he hadn’t seen in almost a week, was standing at the glass again. She stood flanked by a pair of rather sharky, familiar-looking faces. Her face wore a simple smile as she raised a hand and waggled her fingers in a wave, which looked anything but friendly when paired with the dead-eyed stares of the shark men to either side of her.
his mind screamed as whoever these people were laid a combined four hands on him and started moving him, only making the vertigo worse as they rolled him and shifted him like putty along the sidewalk. John caught horrible flickers of malice and disgust through their contact making the panic he felt skyrocket while they stretched and pulled him into a container in the boot of a waiting car.
Sherlock snorted. “Asking questions like that? Obviously you took the bonus he offered, a little extra money to monitor me, and now you’re fishing for personal details.”
“Go away,” Sherlock grumbled.
“I’d like a second opinion, and isn’t this more fun than sitting around the flat doing nothing?” Sherlock nodded down at the corpse pointedly.
“I once prevented the on stage homicide of the lead actor in an open-air theater production of Julius Caesar. I infiltrated the cast and caught the jealous co-star who had carried some grand designs of becoming his lover and when spurned turned murderous, they’d been practicing on a local homeless man.”
John looked down at his kit and back up at Hyperion. His kit alone couldn’t repair the battle damage, but maybe if he could get him to camp where there were at least a couple riders who would know what to do; maybe there they could help him. So he decided to do something incredibly stupid, and moved towards Hyperion.
John’s reaction was instant. His human form shuddered and instantly squashed up against the door, becoming barely above a blob squeezed into human clothes as he sought no further physical contact with his mate. Sherlock backed away, realizing he was only angering John further by trying to initiate a touch. The pair sat quietly in the back seat of the car for a long while, Sherlock scooting back over towards his door and staying there, allowing his features to dissolve slightly and pooling on the seat. John separated himself from the door once more when Sherlock backed off, regaining something of a human shape even though he was nearly vibrating, raised irritated spikes covering his skin.
“Pluto,” Sherlock repeated, gaze flicking to the objects in John’s hands and feeling a small anticipatory shiver of his own run up his spine.
John wasn’t really sure what to do with that bit of information; a part of him wanted Sherlock to elaborate, considering that Victor had been to some degree physically abusive towards Sherlock; a sexual relationship of any kind couldn’t have been exactly healthy. Another part of him was shouting to drop the topic then and there. That opening that particular can of worms was not something he wanted to tackle just now with their relationship as flatmates being so new.
“I was looking for my clothes, by the way, Mycroft I need a locker. You have enough sway to keep me imprisoned here, the least you can do is reliably provide me with clothing,” Sherlock grumped.
It was a bloodbath; the men who had been on watch had died at their posts, and he saw more of the dead beyond. John heard retaliating gunfire signaling that there were at least a few still alive. He didn’t have much time to think on that though as one enemy soldier rounded the corner, saw John, and shouted an alarm. John ducked behind the doorway where he’d been standing just in time to avoid a spray of bullets. He saw Hyperion stumbling towards him and then, like a tank, the dragon rammed into the crumbling wall. Men screamed as bricks and rubble from the dilapidated building rained down on them. He heard another explosion nearby, the higher-pitched screams of a drake as well as human shouting. He watched as Hyperion scraped his side against the building, using it as a brace as he regained shaky footing. This was no place for a grounded dragon. He would be killed. John couldn’t leave his men, no matter how few survived, he needed to help them.
There was a beat of silence and John watched as heads whipped back to stare at Jim, who was still staring at Sherlock with a nearly predatory gaze. John watched as Jim licked his lower lip before biting it.
“What’s that mean?” John asked, swallowing a fry.
“Something’s bothering you,” John could see it even though Sherlock’s face was rapidly closing off, “anything else you wanted to say?”
“Too used to being in and around water,” Sherlock said, leaning into John’s back and wrapping his arms around his middle once he was done with his water.
“It’s someone in an Aerie?” John asked finally, and Sherlock’s face lit as though John had just presented him with a new bit of anatomy to play with.
The barrel of the gun nudged his temple, snapping him out of his thoughts. “Got you,” Sebbie said quietly, grinning wide at him. And then the gun clicked, John flinched, and his life flashed before his eyes, his last thought being that he never got to kiss Sherlock again and say goodbye.
John heard the familiar sound of a soldier shouting “Watson! Watson!” before the voice  was drowned out by the beating of wings far too close to the ground. A pair had come down to the sand, a large red dragon tangled with an absolutely massive black. The red carried a rider hanging half out of her saddle as she wielded her sword, stabbing into the black monster’s neck. The black was riderless but still in mangled flightgear; the shredded man on the sand must have been its rider.
John laughed along with him. “Sea flap flaps, that's ridiculous,” he said, snorting as he looked over at the rays and sure enough there they were flapping along in the water, fins breaking the surface now and then to wave in the air.
“What?”
“Oh, his body was taken to the morgue. It will be sent home and given a proper burial.” Helen said. John felt relieved at that news. The poor man deserved a burial.
“A bit in Uni, rarely since other than the occasional experiment,” Sherlock replied, not looking up from his salad.
Melinda was magnificent, a colorful smaller dragon, even shorter than Bellamy. She was mostly brilliant red with yellows on her belly, and darker burgundy mottling on her back. She had spots of black scales scattered like burnt out pixels in a vivid picture, rimming her eyes like permanent mascara. She even had little black horns, like crests of black eyelashes on her brows. John noticed how long she was in both body and neck, with a broad head like a viper. Her nose was short, with large, mossy green eyes close behind her nostrils. And just as he was staring Melinda opened her mouth in an absolutely gigantic yawn. The viperid comparison had been accurate as her maw split wide to reveal a pair of huge sickle-like fangs that unfolded from the roof of her mouth with the flexing of the powerful jaw muscles at the back of her head. She was incredible to look at and John felt a small pang of jealousy from Hyperion at the thought. John chuckled and gave the bit of mottled tan neck in front of him a pat.
orders first!” Lestrade said, smacking his own chest to get Sherlock to look at him. “You acting like a immature child does nothing but make the other Masters wish they could ship you off to Siberia and everyone else in the Aerie want to strangle you. Do you know about the petitions? The most recent one suggested that we send you to run post for the station in Antarctica. That one managed to get 97 signatures before we took it off the community activity board.”
Sherlock buried his head in John’s shoulder, back heaving and arching as his thrusts became erratic and a hand came between them to stroke John’s cock. But Sherlock abruptly stilled, and John could almost feel him coming as he went rigid over him, biting John’s shoulder, fist pausing on John’s penis. Everything halted for a moment, nothing moving but the gentle sway of water around them until Sherlock relaxed and slumped onto John, weightless.
“Sir, do you really think it wise that Sherlock attend the courses himself?” Sally suddenly asked, turning to look up at Mycroft. “Think of the distraction,” she hissed.
It was some time afterwards that John decided to pull on clean trousers, simply for the sake of anyone who may visit, or the kitchen staff, whomever came first. He then remembered the other package that had been left with his lunch. John sat at the edge of the mattress as he pulled open the drawstrings on the bag to reveal a small stack of books with a letter folded and taped to one of them. The message was from Sally. “Dear John, These are the texts that Lestrade requested for you to read during your bonding. Most of the knowledge contained in these books is beginner level education for our newest nestlings. Please do not be offended by their simplicity; we only think it best to start at the very beginning. We do not doubt that you will learn quickly. Do not rush. We do not expect you to finish these before your bonding is over. We only hope that what is in these books will help you learn a little more about Hyperion.” John glanced at the books, all fairly small and simple-looking with the exception of a larger tome titled ‘Dragons of the World’. The letter continued on with a P.S.: “Sorry neither I or Lestrade could deliver these personally. We will most likely see you again at the end of your bonding. Peaceful bonding. 5th Division Commander Sally Donovan.”
The sun was peeking through their windows and giving the living room a blue-grey morning glow by the time John finally felt coherent again. His mind felt wrung out like a sponge and he was simply exhausted. He gave an experimental twitch, hoping he could move again, and a decent ripple passed over his skin. John poked out to touch one of the discarded mugs and accidentally tipped it over, his coordination not entirely back yet. He very slowly moved to hug Sherlock, sliding broad parts of himself around him.
John found a comfortable bench in the rainforest zone near the children’s play area to set Sherlock down. The wide bench shaped like a log allowed him to prop Sherlock up in the corner of the little alcove. John turned to see Mycroft with his umbrella hooked over one arm and the large bag of food in his other hand. He could almost see Mycroft physically trying to hold the fast food with just a couple of fingers to keep the grease away. John rescued Mycroft from the grease, taking the food from him and setting it down near Sherlock’s feet.
“How often do you talk about what happened when you were less than thirteen?” Sherlock replied with his own question. “Most of them leave before then, maybe a year or two later, they don’t talk about it much most likely and some of the information is common if you are looking for it. I defy you to google some of the more basic principles about dragons, like what to do if a bit of draconic acid gets on your skin, maybe how to keep certain types of small dragons away from your home. The facts are out there, given enough searching. Given the advent of the internet there are threads that begin with a ‘what can I do about some dragon related issue?’ and a reply may be from a person who ‘used to live in an Aerie for a while’. There’s your ex-nestling sharing what little information they might remember on a public platform. They go on to live their lives, they get jobs, they look and act like average people!”
Sherlock stood off to the side waiting for their meals while John got the drinks. Suddenly there was an arm around his neck, and the drinks in John’s hands flew up, and then down, and covered both him and his attacker in sticky fountain soda. John flailed for purchase as the large arm cinched around his neck and pulled him backwards. A large hand tried to clap a piece of cloth over John’s face but John quickly elbowed the man in the gut, ducking away from the sickly sour smelling thing.
“Thank you Josie,” Sally said kindly, the rage from before seeming to have cooled during the brief interruption. “If you would please let the police inside, we will try to be out of your nest quickly.”
John sighed affectionately and patted him on the nose. “You didn’t need to be flashy,” he said. “Now come on, I don’t think they want you laying here to dry, don’t hurt yourself, that’s it, let’s go lay next Bellamy, huh?” John coaxed Hyperion into getting up and the poor waterlogged thing hobbled up the terraces to a vacant spot next to Bellamy, flopping down, and spreading out on the sun-warmed rock. Hyperion gave one last catlike stretch: forearms forward, toes splayed, wings stretched as far as they could go until John began to feel a keen twinge in his shoulder across the bond, a massive toothy yawn, and then he relaxed, nearly falling asleep right there.
“Yes you do,” he replied, forging onward.
“Now who on earth told you that?” John said, rounding on the taller man as he continued to rearrange his things in the various cabinets and drawers. Sherlock gave him a look, eyebrow raised on a face that said ‘surely you aren’t that stupid’.
Bellamy pulled up with a heavy thud as she landed in front of a building marked Roland-Kerr Further Education College. She shook him in the saddle like a dog trying to shake water, a very clear motion of ‘get the hell off me’ as John reached for the belt to do exactly that, feeling much safer on the ground. Thankfully he managed to slide off her shoulder without getting caught this time, landing hard on the ground with a force that made his knees protest. He felt light-headed, blood still pounding from the rough flight and dive. She started towards the large building looking all the world like the dragons in ancient paintings preparing to storm the castle walls, anger and ferocity radiating from her very scales.
John was out of the helicopter and against the side of the warehouse next to a door in moments, sprinting across the barren area around the building with only the crunch of gravel accompanying him. He pushed the door open as quietly as he could and slipped through the gap into the unoccupied area he could see beyond. John crouched behind a box; now that he was inside he could hear extremely faint voices coming from the other end of the massive open room. The area he’d come into seemed to just be storage for god knew what, crates and boxes stacked and shelved all around with writing from any number of countries all over them.
“Yes I do,” John admitted. “I’ll keep this stored somewhere, we’ll look at it in a year or two and laugh then.” He turned the photo over to check if there was anything written on the back, but all there was was a yellow sticky note that read ‘congratulations,’ (for what John wasn’t sure,
“Sherlock, wait a minute! What mistake?” Dimmock called down the stairwell after him.
“Come on, you need to walk a little, get those muscles and joints moving some every day, like Dr Hooper said,” John told him. When scepticism at actually walking anywhere crossed the bond John sighed. “Just give me three laps around the room, that’s all, if you feel like you can do more after that we’ll try, and if you’re really in agony we can stop early.” John bargained.
“There are breeding programs for dragons? Like they have in zoos for tigers and rhinos?” John asked, moving back to rub down hind legs and toes while Molly continued her checks.
The mental image of a tiny Sherlock watering flowerboxes made John chuckle. “Oh, where are they? Your mother’s a rider?” John asked curiously.
Bellamy banked slowly and turned, the ease of which still made John’s heart try to climb into his throat. But there just off the end of her wing was Hyperion, a big tan shape on the grass. John’s eyes locked onto him and Bellamy soared in his direction. She spiraled over Hyperion sweeping in a long never ending turn overhead and John saw it. Hyperion’s wings were open.
“You can say no,” He said looking up into worried looking blue eyes.
“And Moran?” John asked mind flicking to the fact that Moran split his time between London and New Delhi and who knew where else, maybe he was another contact to someone out east.
Minutes passed in an uneasy silence, watching the Aerie go by until Lestrade finally pulled up in front of them in a brown jeep.
what he’d been looking at.
John pulled the sling on again and his pants, leaving the still faintly bloodstained trousers. He only had the one sling; there were other, less stained, garments still in his bag. He limped to the door, picking up the items left behind, and realized that he was as far away from Hyperion as he’d been all day. Hyperion stared at him with a sad pang across the bond. “I’m not leaving,” John reassured him, “not for a few days still, and even then, I’ll come back,” John tried to push comfort back to Hyperion even feeling as frayed as his nerves felt after the panic; it hurt to feel the upset underlining everything that crossed the bond.
Sherlock didn’t reply, he simply huffed and went back to looking into the microscope.
“Don’t be. Let me tell you a secret.” He whispered, “I’ve had war veterans like you so bad they couldn’t feed their dragons, even with therapy. The blood, you see, they couldn’t stand to look at the blood and have it covering them. I’ve figured out how to get around it so they can share feedings with their dragons again like they want.” Tom smiled, backing away again, “If I can help them with their problems the others here at the Aerie can help with yours. Just give them a chance, alright?” John swallowed and nodded, starting to feel drained from the combined stresses of the feeding and his brief outburst.
John didn’t know why Sherlock was in a hurry. Since they were walking the landing field and Bellamy was her silvery grey self, he’d had to paint her with visibility markers. She bore eye-shockingly bright spots of orange on her head, the front edges of her wings, her hips, and every few feet down the length of her substantial tail. Why spend all the time to paint her if he was just going to rush them around the field for a couple laps and then head home?
He tried to work quickly so Sherlock wouldn’t find out, John had no idea when his case e-mails would run out for the night or if he’d notice John going missing from his spot behind him. He pecked at keys and tried to search for something good, something they would both enjoy having as a special dinner. And then he remembered Sherlock telling him about a restaurant near his home and a case that saved the owner, Angelo’s. John typed it in and sure enough they worked with the delivery service, a wide grin spread across his face at that just knowing that they were going to get better food for once, and good Italian food too. For once John would be able to surprise Sherlock.
“No, not today,” she said with a smile that read, ‘oh you silly paranoid little man’ which, in a strange way, made John feel a bit better as he exited the car to stand on the front steps. Inside the lights downstairs where on again; Mrs. Hudson was home. The upstairs lights were just as they’d been left, showing no trace of Sherlock’s return.
Regaining contact with Hyperion had helped calm John for most of the explanation, but as the man rose to exit the crate John’s heart leapt into his throat again.
“I’m not going to hurt you,” He said, then there was contact. His slightly calloused palm met smooth hot scales, and there was a hiss right in his ear. He looked and there were teeth, a slightly open mouth full of them, and a snout a little over half his height. Hyperion had shifted around; if he wanted to he could take John right there and chew him into a bloody pulp. John put his other hand up and placed it gently between the dragon’s nostrils.
into people and back has just kidnapped the man I fucking love, so either give me something to help find him or step the fuck off!”
“I’m alright, Hyperion,” he said, pushing lightly back at Hyperion’s jaw with a bare foot. In that moment John realized how he must look should any outsider come in. A grown man, sitting in his pants, leaned up against a dragon, eating lunch. That thought made him laugh, covering his face as he tried to hold it in. Hyperion had a moment of confusion before he caught onto the humor and happiness the odd situation brought John and he chuckled in his own way, echoing that good feeling back and lightening John’s spirits further.
“Well, I’ll be here when you wake up again, no fish here either.” Sherlock said copying John’s promise, and making him chuckle at the silliness of it coming out of Sherlock’s mouth.
“They’re glasses,” John said holding up the cups to the faint light coming through the window.
“Go on, I’ll be right here when you’re done,” John said, helping him come to a decision.
In the water, John’s vision wasn’t as clear as when he was a fish but definitely clearer than when he had been ‘completely human.’ He saw Sherlock’s naked arse diving away from him, legs kicking with long slightly webbed toes fanned, gills open along his neck, flaccid cock bobbing in the water when he stopped to sit at the top of the Easter Island head with his legs crisscrossed. John shook his head and began to swim himself. The first breaths with the gills underwater were as strange as above it, if anything a little more disturbing, but he wasn’t yet a fish so he was fine with the bit of oddness. The both of them swam around amongst the other fish for a bit, Sherlock swimming circles around John with his long swimmerly legs and arms.
Shrieked across John’s mental landscape. He would have immediately shrunk away if he had been able to move; as it was Paul had just laid the flat of the knife against him, cold and unmoving and terrifying. John instantly was transported back to the memory of being cleaved open, a flashback remembered far far less romantically than he had just hours before with Sherlock.
“Yes. I want you to take those bandages off and let the wounds air out tomorrow, and, if you can, wash them.” She glanced down at his sling, “er, better yet ask someone to help. Please don’t let him lay in the sand after that, don’t want to muck up those injuries again. Other than that, make sure he gets up and walks around at least a couple times every day, a couple laps around the room and a few wing stretches, nothing too strenuous,” she recited, pointing out the wide ring around the sand pit for Hyperion’s path.
John tried to stay still as Sherlock mouthed his way up his cock, using his hand to tug the foreskin back and reveal the spongy head before kissing the sensitive fraenulum. John watched as Sherlock lightly pressed his lips to the very top of the glans, barely fitting his mouth to the shape and letting his tongue tease at the slit there before backing off again, John let out a groan.
“Highly unlikely,” Sherlock chuckled, trying to regain his composure. Smiling looked good on him.
“Yes, all right? I want it!” Sherlock snarled turning his head on the pillow to glare up at John.
perhaps?” Sherlock said with a positively wicked grin.
“What happened?!” John looked up sharply at Mycroft. “I spent the entire day today as a bloody fucking fish! A fish, in my birthday suit, in front of a ton of strangers banging on the glass and watching me shit myself!” John yelled, his voice echoing with an unpleasant sort of ring off the bare concrete and piping.
“No,” Sherlock replied unconvincingly. “It is idiotic to think that we would transform again after spending a whole day not in that state.”
“If you are quite done, get out of my kitchen,” Sherlock grumped.
“A little bored, yeah, but it’s true that you are interesting, and I would like to learn more about my… tankmate,” John replied, just as a unicornfish poked its long nose around the corner and proceeded to stare Sherlock down, it seemed. There was a moment of silence, and John noticed Sherlock look briefly over at him a few more times as if contemplating whether he should share his cases. Sherlock let out a large sigh.
“Sherlock!” John called, trying to wriggle closer to him.
Sherlock sighed and set his fork down, plucking the bottle out of John’s hand. “Give me your shoe,” he demanded, holding out a hand for said item. John pulled off one of the loafers that had become that week’s pair of shoes and handed it to Sherlock, who stuck the bottle into the heel of said shoe. He turned it sideways and soundly thumped the heel and bottle against the wall a couple times, sure enough the cork popped loose. Sherlock handed the bottle back to a slightly smiling John.
“You’re acting like you want to go for a run,” John said, watching as Sherlock glanced down the hall again.
“He said it was called a Devon White-Eye,” John said, hoping that was useful information while Molly set about unwrapping the poor thing.
“I only ask because everyone else in this Aerie seems to be paired off with someone, Lestrade has Dimmock, Molly has Sally and Irene, I heard there’s a healthy polyamorous relationship of four over in the transit division, speaking of, Soo Lin has Andy, you had Victor, even Jim has Moran…” John trailed off when he saw Sherlock twitch at the mention of Victor. Sherlock sat up slowly and scrubbed both hands down over his face with another heavier sigh.
“I told you to find the phone. You’re the one who decided to run off and get Bellamy, you could have told Lestrade and sent him or Sally just as easily,” he interrupted calmly.
“I-impressive?” He croaked; his knees felt wobbly and Hyperion was the only thing really keeping him standing.
“Of the number of ways this evening could have ended and multitudes of possibilities in how you could have reacted to more physical demonstrations of affection, I must admit I may not have anticipated this pleasant of an outcome, or what to do next should it occur.” Sherlock murmured quietly, hand’s leaving John’s face to trace down over his shoulders and come to meet behind John’s back, hugging him close.
Angelo’s grin seemed to grow impossibly wider. “Of course! I’ll make up something for the both of you. You’re his partner now, right? Maybe with you he’ll put some weight on.” He slapped John on the back in a friendly gesture, knocking a cough out of him, before heading back into the kitchens behind the counter.
“Well, of course I’m not. I don’t know how long you and Victor were together-”
“Oh no you don’t,” John said scrambling over to the one that was starting to come to. He yanked the scarf from around the man’s neck and used it to tie his wrists behind his back, hoping that was enough to hold him. The first man bore similar features to his counterpart, the gills, the broad nose, the shark-ish teeth.
Later that night, after a shared diner at the cafeteria and a quick check on a soundly sleeping Hyperion, John looked at the swim shorts Sherlock had bought for him before tossing them into the laundry.
The elevator stopped and the door opened to a small space with stairs leading upwards, Sherlock led him up them and John was greeted with a very different view of the Aerie. They came out at a glass enclosed balcony, allowing John to look down on the Aerie with a near three hundred sixty degree view. It was incredible, all lit up in the night, the whole Aerie aglow with Christmas lights.
“Keep him?” the weaselly voice barked. “Where?”
“Yes, I googled you after he mentioned you, Mycroft didn’t say much other than you were investigating some kind of fish stealing gang.” John replied, distractedly plucking at the short bits of webbing between his fingers.
“Things happened to me while I was away,” Sherlock mumbled finally, his arms tightening around John’s ribcage. John took the sudden confession in stride; if Sherlock wanted to talk he would let him.
John thought, stretching.
“I’ve not given you any reason to,” Sherlock said shrugging into his robe and cinching the belt tight, looking as though he were almost trying to hide in it.
“At least you are awake and aware--” Sherlock said, slipping into a pair of slim black boxer briefs.
The first day or two John honestly worried about Sherlock’s health, since he never saw him actually eat or drink until he caught the detective making himself a piece of toast and a glass of the orange juice John had bought. If it weren’t for the sound of his breathing and the occasional movement and repositioning John could almost swear he was living alone.
“Is this a thing that happens often? Him trying to set you up on dates?” John asked with a pointed look at the bottle of grappa and candle.
John walked him into the bedroom and let him sit on the edge of the bed while he rummaged for proper pants and pajamas. He helped him get into the garments and offered the water again. They were both silent throughout it all. Sherlock was tucked into bed with the covers pulled up under his ears by the time John had dug an old worn shirt out of the drawers to sleep in. John lifted the sheets and climbed in as well, Sherlock budging over for him. They lay like that facing each other in silence for a while, neither of them going to sleep. John finally broke the silence.
It was that moment when a throaty croaking came from the doorway. Angus stood at the top of the stairs, frills up and making what amounted to his loudest vocalizations, which sounded a bit like someone attempting to strangle a barking dog. He hissed, colorful crests standing out more as he advanced towards the pair of them making small charging motions at John.
Hyperion did not believe him, the sensations that crossed the bond squeezed a little tighter tinged with doubt and an urge to comfort.
John briefly wished he had kept Mycroft’s mobile so he could continue to watch exactly where Sherlock was, hell even where they were even headed. He only knew south; he didn’t know where exactly Jim might be leading them, she might have even changed directions since John had handed the map back for all he knew.
“Oh?” John replied, eyebrows creasing together lightly thinking what else Sherlock could have possibly planned.
“I’ve lived here all my life, Sally is not the only other inhabitant of this Aerie,” Sherlock replied. “This one’s gone off,” he mumbled, pitching the furry jar into the garbage can.
John felt hands rolling and lifting his shoulders, dragging his feet up the stairs and laying him out on the cool concrete beside the pool.
John hesitated for a moment after he watched Sherlock pass through the door, unsure if he should intrude. He looked over at Hyperion’s door, Hyperion sitting beyond it, calm and resting now that the bomb threat had passed. A soft wave of contentment radiated across the bond as Hyperion sensed John nearby. John pushed back his own thoughts of calm and happiness that all was safe and well again, along with a promise to come see him in a little while. He stepped up to Bellamy’s door then and he pushed anyway, slightly surprised that Sherlock hadn’t locked it behind him.
John thought, panting with the exertion to keep up with the long-legged rider running ahead. Sherlock turned down a particularly narrow alley and made the corner, John saw him hop a short wire fence behind the building and stop dead in his tracks. It wasn’t till he caught up to him that he saw what made the detective stop.
John stopped moving immediately, leaning back, taking his hand off Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock felt him begin to pull out again, “Pluto” he said again, panting hard against the pillow as he continued to tug at his bound wrists.
And so they both went quiet, eating their warm meals with the portable heater nearby between them. Every now and then another dragon would fly by, its belly painted and shining in the lights from below or decorated with their own lights threaded into their harnesses, John watched them come to land in the wide field below every time, his eyes following the occasional bright streaks like silent fireworks in the night.
“Finally given in, have you?” Sherlock asked smugly. John was having none of that, as sweet as it was to see Sherlock smile and it made John happy to make him do it, the maelstrom of emotions and his gut shrieking,
A small pop nearby plunged them further into darkness. The warm yellow glow of the lantern vanished leaving them in the barely there glow of Fairy lights alone. The bulb inside the lantern had chosen that particular moment to burn out. John huffed a thin laugh as he was brought back to the reality that the clock was ticking late into the night and they were both starting to wear their own thin layers of snow, Sherlock had a powdery dusting of it in his curls.
“His name is Shaw,” a man said nearby, “And I’m Sebastian Moran, pleased to meet you,” He added offering a hand to John.
“Acting against your own best interest,” Sherlock said quietly.
John sat back in the water for a moment longer after that, mildly stunned by the sudden happy affection showered on his forehead. Sherlock was nearly done with his drying when he seemed to realize John was looking at him and he in turn looked back with a small curious tilt of his head.
“Didn’t need to ask,” John said, closing the gap between them and meeting Sherlock’s descending lips. This kiss wasn’t quite as urgent as the ones up on the tower. Sherlock was taking his time feeling it. His ungloved hands trailed across John’s skin this time, long fingers skimming almost ticklishly light up his neck to cradle John’s face between large palms. And John loved it. Sherlock pulled away only to reposition and take his mouth over and over again. They didn’t even move, John had half a mind to maneuver them over onto the sofa and escalate the moment from simply kissing to rutting, the thought of that alone was enough to encourage the beginnings of a hard on.
“Of course, dear, from what I’ve heard I don’t hold it against you, make sure you grab something warm to wear, don’t want to catch a cold,” she said in understanding motherly tones. John couldn’t help smiling.
“John, they are just following the safety guidelines,” Sherlock said, trying to get John to keep moving along. Hyperion and Bellamy were both large enough breeds to be out in the frigid weather, it wasn’t ideal for walking, but they could manage for a couple hours at least. They stayed around the landing field taking advantage of the heaters, no roaming out on the ice and snow covered training grounds. Many of their usual walking areas had been closed off due to the inclement weather, leaving the options of the veterinary wing or the landing field.
He knocked to announce his presence and a soft grumble from Bellamy was his answer. He opened the door, slowly peeking inside. The lights were on low and the ceiling, drawn closed, helped to bounce it and illuminate Bellamy in a soft silvery gold. She sat uncurled but still alert and watchful in her sand. Sherlock lay stretched out on his back between her forearms, divested of his boots, coat, and waistcoat, his head pillowed against the thumb of her paw and his palms pressed together in front of his lips. For a moment John just watched the detective lie there: flat stomach rising and falling slowly, long fingers now and again tapping together, long dark eyelashes fanned closed, that long body finally resting after a day of frenzy. The fact that the lights were on at all meant he had managed to relax her to the point where she would at least let Sherlock out from under her for a moment.
“I get a feeling Mycroft is going to be cleaning up fish for a while,” Sherlock said, directing John to look down at the floor where at least a couple of sharks lay surrounded by the tatters of clothes.
John lay on Hyperion’s nose for a while after Tom had left, the bond swirling away at the back of his mind. Hyperion was trying to bowl him over with as much comfort as he could muster, making John feel calm and boneless where he lay, but alongside the comfort came jagged needles of hurt: Hyperion’s own hurt at John’s frightened admission.
“Better to be in the water even if this cheap bit of plastic is off. Besides we have gills,” Sherlock said climbing the stairs up to the tank.
“Oh, they did give me some bonding time,” Sherlock said as though he were pointing out the silver lining in it all. “Course she was as big as I was easily when she hatched, and I didn’t have a name for her. I had a large hatchling following me for days asking ‘what name? What my name?’ Over and over in my head.”
“I am merely a concerned family member who has seen close calls such as this,” he gestured at the large claw marks raked through a section of the roof where Bellamy had all but crawled over in an attempt to take the shortest route to Sherlock without going through the brick wall itself, “happen before, albeit on a much less… expensive scale.” His nose crinkled as he surveyed the damage.
“Sally, Sally! I need to make a phone call, can I borrow your mobile?” he asked quickly, “I have a sister, she’d probably like to know what’s happened to me.” Sally pulled out her phone and tossed it to him.
They floated down and Sherlock still clung to John, grinning his face off and very clearly still laughing even though there was no sound accompanying it. John reached up and pushed at Sherlock’s head playfully, trying to get him to let go. The grip broke easily and they separated, floating away from each other like astronauts in space.
“To not to, Commander Sally,” they all recited as she loomed over them.
“Ah, Dr Watson, I trust you are well,” he said calmly, with a small curling smile.
“I placed the order, Holmes was the name on the card, thank you so much for bringing it for us,” John said with a large grin. He could smell the lovely scent of garlicky Italian emanating from the bags.
“Let me let you in on a secret,” she whispered. “I honestly don’t care. You’re both going to just be fish soon.” Those dark eyes slid over to John again for a moment before she looked back down at Sherlock. “He’s gonna be just another fat tuna fish, maybe I’ll have him stuffed as a trophy for someone’s wall or I bet he’d taste excellent prepared for a plate in Japan.” John paled at that. It had been funny weeks ago poking fun at Mycroft turning John into sushi. Coming from her lips the thought made John’s blood run cold. She would do it--turn him into fillet o’ John without blinking. “I’m gonna keep you though,” Jim said with a sadistic grin. “Put you in a nice big tank so you can swim round and round for me, bet your big brother would do just about anything to keep me from dumping you into a tankload of piranha.”
They ended up settling in for their meal in the rainforest area, Sherlock deciding to plop down on the squishy moss-textured flooring near the four-eyed fish, who just continued to putter around the surface of their tank unperturbed. They both tucked into their food, even though John did notice that Sherlock ordered barely a quarter of what he did.
“Come on,” John finally said, taking Sherlock by the hand and leading him towards the stairs and their dinner.
“This is flat 221, arrogant sod tacked the ‘b’ onto the door,” she grumped, stepping up to the unmarked door to the right of 221b and knocking. A strange crowing sort of noise came from the other side, as if someone was strangling a raven. The door opened and out stepped an older woman, shooing away whatever was making the racket beyond. “Mrs Hudson, Dr Watson is here to take his room, John, this is Mrs Hudson, your landlady.”
“What on earth was that?” John asked once the pair were far enough away.
A ridiculous part of him fantasized about bringing up an arm and fisting his fingers in those soft curls as he turned his head a just kissed the words right off Sherlock’s tongue. Said part of him was also getting rather bruised by the amount of times John was having to stomp it down, because Sherlock really did not need John lusting after him and trying to start something more intimate so soon after they’d only just become something resembling friends beyond just being roommates.
“No, no, no, Hyperion’s not going to be flying again for a while now. No, he’s going to be flown home with you,” he said, laughing a little at John’s mistake. “We have a couple of cargo carriers preparing to leave who can take on Hyperion’s weight,”
“I would like to stay, don’t want to leave you again for a while.”
“You’re not allowed to leave without a rider?” John said aloud, bringing Bellamy’s erratic pacing to a halt once again as she lanced another angered look at him.
Sally swallowed a chunk of cantaloupe before responding, “Breakfast is 6 to 10, any later than that for any meal you’re getting scraps, snacks, and cereal bars, or you’re cooking for yourself. Lunch is noon to 3, dinner is 6 to 10 as well-”
“I need you to run some tests for me on this shoe, it has poison on it,”
Once John was dressed, jeans, shirt, and all he looked back at the phone tracking Sherlock. The little icon had shifted further down, already on the motorway and still heading straight south towards Crawley. “Would you please explain why you are not still with my brother?” Mycroft asked, breaking the quiet in the car.
The van suddenly stopped and they were piled out once more into a large courtyard very similar looking to the landing field, grey, ornately carved stone walls with grass covering the middle. Molly was there waiting for them. John saw her eyes widen as the van doors opened. Calm and collected as any doctor John had ever met in the face of the slimy mess that emerged from the van, she took control of the situation.
Sherlock finally closed his arms around John, returning the hug a little awkwardly at first, but then he seemed to give in and rested his head on John’s shoulder. "So you are my friend now? You do realize my ‘friends’ usually die or end up shipped away?” Sherlock asked softly, John could feel that deep baritone in his chest and that voice right against his ear made a small shiver run up his spine. "Caring is a weakness, Mycroft says.”
John was barely able to pay attention to her kind words, though, as the bond had come alive with new worry, John’s startle had reached Hyperion, proving that the bond had held but at the same time, stressed the dragon far away at the other end. John tried to project calm, ‘I’m alright,’ and attempted to project images like Hyperion did, trying to somehow encapsulate whatever Angus was and how he’d briefly upset John into a picture. The bond still writhed with fear and upset, only at lower levels, roiling at the back of his mind rather than demanding his full attention.
“I’m 11, I’ll be able to get my own dragon soon,” Mary told him as she rolled out Hyperion’s ball, pushing it over so the dragon could reach it from his mat while she went back to pull out a large hoop too.
“He didn’t
“I don’t eat when I’m on a case,” he murmured, sounding sulky.
The messages kept coming, though. Another couple days passed and John finally approached Sherlock.
For the moment though, after a very long and stress filled night, they finally slept. Sherlock stayed covering John as they both drifted towards sleep. Whispered ‘I love you’s’ were exchanged repeatedly until John’s mind finally cycled down into exhausted sleep, followed closely by Sherlock who finally pulled an afghan across them. And there they lay on the sofa, sun streaming through the tall windows of 221b, light barely penetrating the wooly cover over them.
“Not a blotling,” Sherlock said picking up his mug and shuffling off into the kitchen with it.
“Isn’t that your job though? As a rider in this division,” John asked, curious about this strange man and what exactly he did if he was ignoring his commander’s orders.
“I doubt any child of Dimmock’s would let any self defense training go to waste.”
“You’re the first coxswain to achieve presidential status here at Cambridge, I’d have to be living under a rock to not hear about you.” Holmes said petulantly. John grinned, delighted that his presidency was being discussed somewhere other than the boathouse locker room.
“Turn this garbage off.” Stamford groaned.
The man who had been trying his best to discreetly eavesdrop opened his mouth to speak. John held up a finger before he could get a word in, “Don’t.”
(See the end of the chapter for
full of himself.” John said, eliciting a sharp laugh from Bill.
I live for kudos/comments!!!
“For dinner, tonight.”
“Forget Holmes. What the hell was that about?” Callaghan asked.
At the end of the ride, he gave John his number. John was elated, until he figured out that as flatmates, they would need to agree on a move in date. He took the piece of paper with a tight smile and ignored the rude hand gestures being made by Bill and Kav in the background.
“He did.” Holmes nodded.
Do you love her? he asks.
Mary doesn’t laugh.
Sherlock’s world collapsed around him.
It is the best tended grave in London. Sherlock Holmes makes sure of it.
They took up one hundred percent on the space in the living room and haunted him with their constant presence. Every morning, Holmes would emerge in all his sweat soaked glory and John would have a heart attack. It was embarrassing, really.
“So- good bunch, aren’t they?” Lestrade whispered.
John visits Sherlock’s grave. He lets a tear escape his eye and begins to talk.
“Are you sure?”
Hi everyone! It's been so long since I updated this fic but I think I'm going to take it down and re upload as a 10k one shot. It will be officially taken down on May 1st and the new one re uploaded sometime in June.
“Alright. So rude
No matter how many times she corrects him, her tea is always black with two sugars. There are no bulletholes in the wall or dead body parts in the refrigerator. Every surface is devoid of experiments. Appliances are used properly and safely. It is the opposite of Baker Street. It’s the farthest from John’s old life as possible. It's astonishingly mind numbing.
“Kav’s a gossip.” Bill shrugged, pulling on his shirtsleeves.
"It worries me that you know that.”
“True.” John said, “Where’s the D.I.?”
She wants him to move on. John shakes his head no, it’s not her decision to make. It never was.
“Shut up.” John said.
This season was slated to be, for lack of a better word, his bitch. Harry had scolded him about that but even she couldn’t deny it. He had spent the past seasons biding his time with the Goldie crew. He had cemented the coach-athlete relationship between him and Lestrade through countless pub visits. He was studying up on headwinds and river depth every free period he had.
John turned back to him and smiled, “You’re welcome.”
John couldn’t help the giggle that escaped his mouth. “You’re extraordinary.”
“And what’ll happen to us then?” Bill said.
John was very small for his age and the oversized clothes his mother outfitted him in didn’t help that fact. So if you had to hazard a guess if he would be able to survive this without sustaining a very serious injury, the answer would be no. Even then, he had good sense to decline their challenge.
“But you’re shagging, yes?” Bill said, earning laughs all around.
The stern is the back of the boat, it is where the coxswain is usually located and where the skeg and the rudder is. The rudder is the thin metal square the steers these boats. The skeg keeps the boat in line. The coxswain controls the rudder with a pulley system in the stern. The coxswain sits upright in the stern and when faced with a bowloader or a bow-coxed boat, they have to crouch down into the foredeck. Losing or breaking the rudder or the skeg is very, very bad.
“Holmes.” Callaghan jutted his chin out, as if to give the ok.
John’s music began to write when he was about nine years old. It began with a crescendo, a cry for help in a local playground. His sister, Harriet, had written as a melodic and prided herself on being the most popular kid on their street. John, of course, being her little brother was expected to be reckless and irresponsible. And what better way to find out than to dare him to climb a large rock situated at the playground’s edge? Honestly, it makes you wonder what kids got up to before wifi and interactive robot dogs came along.
“There’s some Fortnum and Mason in the top cupboard.” Holmes mumbled.
He’s suffering, Mycroft says. John responds with silence. He lets his anger get the better of him. John wants absolutely nothing to do with Sherlock Holmes. If he thinks that he can come back to London unannounced and expect John to start solving bloody crimes with him again, he’s not any smarter than the rest of the human population.
Duncan Isaac Dimmock, or D.I. was the club’s coxing coach. He currently held the ninth seat on the UK’s own national team but worked for Cambridge on the side. Every now and then, he and his wife would screw up pick up times and he’d have to bring his daughter to the boathouse. And every now and then, Bill and Kav would teach her how to throw a right hook or how to properly knee someone in the balls.
“I think we both know, I would.”
“I’ve been here for a long time, Watson.” Holmes said, shrugging on a white cotton longsleeve.
On Sherlock’s seventh birthday, the music began to write. “Right on schedule.” the concertmaster thought out loud. Holmes men always wrote on their seventh birthday and Sherlock would not be an exception. The cook celebrated his presentation with a small garden party. Sherlock was the only attendee. At least he was allowed to eat as many chocolate biscuits he wanted.
The locker room had gotten used to John and Holmes going off about one thing or another after practice. John had introduced Sherlock to his group of friends from last year. Bill, Kav, Callaghan, Hunt, and Stamford. The boys liked Holmes’ well enough and mostly put up with him because he had a knack for directing them to girls who’d give them the time of day.
His grave reads: John Watson, beloved husband, loving father, lifelong friend.
Fuck, he wished they were.
“Don’t write that down.” Holmes ordered and groaned when he saw the sheet, “Why are you writing that down?”
“Well, our piss better be.” Stamford said.
“Pictures. Take.”
“Don’t forget the photographer who get high in the bushes.”
“I’ll do better on my own, John.” he assured him with a tight lipped smile.
His therapist decides he needs to move on. After a while, he convinces himself that it was his decision too.
John’s eyes widened, mind racing as he tried to commit the whole thing to memory. Then he started hacking and coughing. His windpipe began to close and he steadied himself on the cold water faucet. The faucet rained ice cold water down on him. He may have screamed. Jumping away from it, John slipped and fell to the tiled floor. Well,
It was great news for William Standish who couldn’t stand it whenever John blasted playlists before a big race. Will was a dropout who hated everything John stood for. When John went to go fetch his laundry, he found him smiling serenely as he threw out a rather large pack of ear plugs. John scoffed and threw a dish towel at him. It missed. By at least a foot. Will laughed. John fumed.
