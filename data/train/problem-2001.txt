John nodded and they jogged the rest of the way to their floor. When they made it John cleared his throat and looked over at Sherlock. "Well, I suppose I'll see you tomorrow."
That next morning, across town, Sherlock Holmes found himself searching the Internet on anything to do with illicit doctor/nurse relations. He had a feeling that the victim of the latest crime he was working on had been embroiled in some sort of scandal in the recent past. His divorce from his first, and second wife were simply too close together to suggest anything but infidelity.
"I promise we'll move as soon as we can. Why don't you move ahead of me? Get the place ready?" John whispered, stroking through Sherlock's hair as Merrick came up to sniff out what was wrong.
Sherlock was having a normal day. It had been months since he left the counseling camp, and he'd got on with his life. After all, he had no place in John's. John didn't even know his real name.
Around three Sherlock left, sprinting out the door to speak with Greg, and John picked up the vicarage phone. The man he needed to speak with told him he could come at once. It was, after all, a church emergency.
"I'm fine, just...leave it," John interrupted, laying back down and sighing. "Are you from the business office? I heard one of you was coming in for me to sign some papers. I legally have another week before you can kick me out, you know."
About an hour later a drunk student shouted through the large plate glass window and stumbled in. John was already on alert, but Sherlock seemed not to notice, too busy in his own head.
Sherlock rang off and set the receiver aside. Mycroft wouldn't contact John, not unless there was something illicit going on. The sickness he felt at being found out simply wasn't real, because he wouldn't be. He just wouldn't be.
Once his mother had passed he sat down with her and explained, in (somewhat) a crude manner, as he didn't think she was the type to bring the issue to the local police, how their relationship would not work. Her response was as he had expected; she blushed and stammered and even apologized. They had actually become somewhat like colleagues after that. He'd made sure to introduce her to the coroner, a portly and kind man named Mike who was always willing to let Sherlock use equipment, and they'd quickly fallen in love.
"That many of the dangers we have faced in recent years would have been avoided and we would now be living in a small cottage in Sussex with a dog and several beehives, yes."
Shaking his head, he gave up. It wasn’t like he’d ever been able to say no to Sherlock, after all. John combed his fingers through Sherlock’s fur, a reluctant smile spreading over his face as the cat relaxed against him, closing its eyes.
"You've always wanted a chance to prove that you're the clever sibling. Come on. Deduce it for me, right now. There's no trick, no lives at risk, nobody here but us. The game is over, but first, I'm asking you for one more deduction. One more miracle."
Sherlock swayed where he stood, reaching out to grip the kitchen table tight with one white-knuckled hand. John watched him, holding his breath.
"That is to say, you love me. I apologize, I must have muddled a few words there, easy mistake to make, those are certainly not phrases that I am accustomed to saying, sure you understand, anyway, I solved your case, perhaps the two of us should return to work now?"
“He’s adorable, aren’t you, Mister Cross-Eyed?” Aisha grinned, making kissy noises at Sherlock and rocking him gently. John felt a stab of anger.
John rolled his eyes and shook his head, not giving Sherlock the satisfaction of a response. "Mycroft and Mary, they thought I left one war for another, the one that I fought with you. But they missed something. They're two of the three cleverest people that I've ever known, and they missed something, the other reason I might want to be around you. Something they couldn't deduce."
John pushed the cables aside and stood up, strolling over to the kitchen doorway and leaning against it, pretending to be more casual than he was. "Mary. She's wrong. When she says I never left the war."
No, if John Watson could choose, he'd be murdered sitting at home in his favorite chair, with a fast acting poison slipped into his cup of tea, gone before he could even realize there was anything out of the ordinary.
But Aisha was barely paying attention to him. “Hey, I might have to come here more often if I get to see your cute little face? Isn’t that right, kitty?”
»John...« he heard the deep familiar rumble, but there was something different about that voice. It was almost … a purr?
Watson's bad side this morning, huh...« Sherlock suddenly heard a voice next to him, turning his head to look at the girl that had just approached him and Sherlock recognised her face. She was in his english course. He scanned her up and down, wondering briefly about the way she was wearing her uniform (the way that reminded him of an old 90's - wanna be nasty - music video) wearing no jacket, the blouse knotted about two inches above the waistband of her skirt, barely covering her belly button and the piercing that was dangling from it. She had the two top button opened, the tie hanging loosely around her neck and the skirt was shortened by hand. Sherlock raised his brows, being equally annoyed and surprised to be disturbed and that by a girl. A girl like that anyway.
Sherlock needed only a few minutes for his morning routine, really glad that Mummy had mercy with him and at least let him wear something similar to his usual clothes. After dressing, Sherlock went down the stairs, followed just as usual by Redbeard – his two year old Irish Setter – who followed Sherlock everywhere he went. Walking into the kitchen, Sherlock first filled Redbeard's bowl.
Here we are again, sorry for making you wait ages for this :/ had a truckload of things to do and god, real life takes up far too much time recently. But I'll try to continue this as soon as possible :) :) :)
“I did. And the only reason you’re not yet grounded is that you’ve just found a friend and I’m not about to ground you and keep you from meeting up with her.”
The detectives eyes fluttered open and he smiled lightly at the sight of John, wandering through the room, still half asleep.
“Because you looked so disgustingly happy getting the chance to publicly humiliate another student, Mr Anderson.” Watson said and just briefly – so much that Sherlock almost hadn’t noticed – made eye contact with him, just before he sat back down and told everyone to open their books.
»Sorry...?« he asked dizzily with a delay and shook his head, literally trying to shake off his thoughts as Mr Watson gave an unnerved sigh and right now, there weren't even gasps, it had become deadly silent.
Entering the room, he unfolded his lesson plan again, glacing down at his teacher's name, before murmuring an irritated "Morning, Mr Watson..." without sparing the man a look and walking over to a free seat. He was certainly not going to introduce himself to the class or what other nonsense was expected from a new student.
PS: I'd really like feedback here, because I'm not too sure about this chapter... so critic is very welcome^^
“Anyway, we actually meant to go upstairs to study, so.. if you’ll excuse us.” Sherlock said and took Janine’s hand to pull her past his mother and over to the stairs, which made Janine giggle again.
"That was the closest I've come to an actual 'I love you, Dad' since I gave him that high tec microscope for christmas a few months ago." his father joked and Mummy chuckled along with the man.
itchy and horrible cotton, but not as worse as the brownish-black trousers which jarred with the blazer.. The tie was designed in diagonal stripes in three different (ugly) shades of blue, white and black. Not that Sherlock was a fashion fetishist, but that was an insult for the eye. And to crown it all the already cumbersome uniform was even bulkier on him since Sherlock had to take the school's largest size because he was already taller than most of the teachers and even with the largest size, the sleeves along with the trouser legs were too short.
"I don't want to, leave me alone!" Sherlock called back, burritoring himself in his sheet and pouting. He really didn't want to go there. People disliked him. That was a fact. There was no magic fairy dust that would rain on him the moment he entered the building and would make him more likeable. He would be hated by everyone, that was for sure.
“He’s gay, you know. And single.” Janine clarified for the barkeeper as he handed the phone back and Sherlock looked at her with a frown.
He heard the common squeak the door to his room made when it was opened and then his room was flooded in much too bright light, coming from the tread.
Sherlock shifted his position just slightly, and now John could feel the gentle vibrations from Sherlock’s purring on his arm.
Sherlock adjusted himself, one paw now pressed firmly over John's stomach, possessively covering as much of him as possible.
John had nothing better to do, so he decided to head over to Lestrade’s latest crime scene – a body found stuffed into the chute of a children’s playground slide, a screwdriver sticking out of its chest. Luckily, a security guard patrolling the park had seen the trail of blood before any kids had gone to the park that day. Still, the police were stumped by the man’s lack of an ID card, or indeed, any fingerprints.
Sherlock wasn't laughing any more. Clearly, the idea that Mycroft, of all people, may have missed something, had got his attention. Sherlock was standing stock still, not moving except for the slight breeze filtering in through the open kitchen window that was ruffling his hair. If this hadn't been such a serious moment, it would have made John laugh.
"No, Sherlock, look at me!" John pressed his forehead against the door, grimacing. "I need to say something, and you're not exactly making it any easier!"
Sherlock pounced, dragging his claws down Aisha’s face, flailing and scratching at her, looking almost wild. Aisha struggled out of his grip, crying out and desperately attempting to shield her face from further attacks, but Sherlock was clinging to her, hissing, completely determined to cause maximum bodily harm.
Some part of this must have been a code word, because Sherlock came bursting out from behind a cushion in a puff of feathers, his tail stretched as high as it would go, snarling.
Mrs Hudson looked bemused. "Yes, well, perhaps now that you’re here, you could help John with his cat problem.”
“Seems like your kind of case. Are you going to keep being a stubborn idiot or are you going to change back and help us out?”
"Oh, I don't know," John shrugged, lowering his voice almost to a whisper. He was shaking, his usually strong stomach suddenly feeling like it had been flipped upside down. "Maybe... this."
That, and there was the small matter of the cat. Even though John had firmly shut his door when he'd gone to bed last night and shoved a chair in front of it for good measure, he'd woken up to find a quietly vibrating cat curled up on his chest, burrowing under the covers and licking at the exposed skin of John's neck.
Sherlock turned and rummaged through a pile of evidence on the kitchen table. He reappeared, holding out a pair of fluffy, cat-shaped earmuffs. “I intend to help John with many of his problems, Mrs Hudson. You would be advised to take these.”
He sniffed. “So how long is this going to go on for? Because if you’re doing this for a case, then maybe you should go out and, you know, talk to other cats who might have been at the crime scene. Catch a few mice for them. I’m sure that’ll get them to talk. Then once you’ve got all your witness statements and terrorized a few birds, you can go back to being a human.”
“You know you’re not going to be much help to anyone like that, don’t you?” John scolded, before realizing that talking out loud to a cat in public probably wasn’t the best idea.
“Yeah, well, I don’t imagine I’d enjoy hitting you so much either. And that’s saying something, because I've never met anyone who deserves a good punch in the face more than you do."
John opened his mouth to protest, but the truth was, he was surprisingly comfortable. He didn’t know if it was the fact that he’d gotten used to having Sherlock the cat in his lap, but, it felt oddly natural to have Sherlock on top of him, cuddled up to him like it was nothing.
Sherlock mewled loudly, scratching his claws down John’s chest. Somehow, he was always gentle enough to make sure John didn’t bleed.
"You also married one of them. If you and I had been doing this a lot sooner, that might not have happened."
John picked him up and tossed him onto the floor. “Nope. No. I’m not speaking to you. Because that was not a coincidence, was it, Sherlock? I told you best behavior, and you go and claw her face off. I had a real chance there. And she liked you, too! What the hell is your problem?”
Nobody else seemed to be particularly concerned about Sherlock’s disappearance. Lestrade called John one day, declaring that Sherlock wasn’t answering his phone and asking for the two of them to come in and help out with a case.
“Alright, Sherlock, you have to be on your best behavior. I’m having someone over. It’s just coffee, it’s nothing serious. She’s nice. She buys lunch at the same place I do. Noticed her cause she’s the only regular in there who gets something different every day. She’s pretty, seems interesting enough…”
“I’ll have that right with you,” John called over his shoulder as he headed into the kitchen. It hadn’t been the great start he was hoping for, but he had plenty of time. If he was lucky, maybe he could even convince her to stay here tonight; then he could have a real person next to him in his bed rather than a bloody cat.
Sherlock stretched, fluffing up his fur for John to keep petting. That wasn’t really much of an answer. John didn’t know what he’d been expecting – maybe for Sherlock the cat to suddenly start speaking in a totally normal human voice and tell John to pass him his phone? No, that was probably a little too weird. If ‘too weird’ was even a concept anymore.
But John really didn’t want to become a crazy cat lady, as tempting as it was to spend his days watching Jeremy Kyle with Sherlock, who clawed at the screen when he saw the guy he thought was the father. (He’d only been wrong once so far, and John had found the perfect squeaky toy to cheer him up whenever he was wrong for a second time.) So, John made a decision.
“I don’t imagine I would enjoy being hit quite so much,” Sherlock whispered back, his eyes wide and childlike.
Come to think of it, John actually had seen Sherlock the human wreck the furniture two or three times, but it was definitely a less frequent occurrence.
“Could you, uh, could you at least put some clothes on if you’re going to sit here? It’s a little distracting.”
He stepped forwards, wrapping a hand around the back of Sherlock's neck and pulling him down. Sherlock went willingly, parting his lips on instinct despite never kissing anyone purely for pleasure in his entire life, and a second later their lips had melted together, soft and perfect and molding to one another like this was how they had always been supposed to be, for longer than either of them had known.
He walked towards the police tape, trying to ignore the occasional brush of fur against his ankles. Sally Donovan had often joked that John followed Sherlock around everywhere like a lost puppy, but apparently, the tables had now turned.
John slowly started to relax too. Maybe it hadn’t been the worst thing in the world that his date hadn’t worked out. Maybe spending the night in, curled up with Sherlock and one of the battered true crime books on the coffee table, was exactly what he needed.
Apparently the cat did not trust him, because it climbed up John's leg and settled into the armchair next to him, cleaning its own whiskers and looking up at John for approval.
John shook his leg, trying to dislodge the cat clinging to him. "Get off! Sherlock could be back any time and he's not going to like you hanging around and messing up his experiments, is he?"
"You said the specific words, 'I love you'. And after what happened at Sherrinford, you don't use those words lightly. You don't make a mistake there. I do deductions too now, remember? And I deduce that the only reason you would ever say those words to me is... if you meant it. If you wanted to say it, but weren't quite sure how to do it."
Sherlock glanced down, studying the bulge in John’s pants like it was a specimen under a microscope. “Yes, I can see that.”
John was very, very careful when he left for work that day to close the door quickly behind him, making absolutely sure that there were no small, furry terrors trying to slink past his legs. He managed to forget about the cat during a thrilling day of prescribing rash cream, and by the time he got on his bike to go home, the cat had stopped flickering through his mind.
Sherlock the cat's other hobbies seemed to include standing watch over  John on the kitchen counter and watching him disapprovingly as he attempted to make dinner, walking over the remote and changing the channel when he decided that John was watching something inappropriate on television, and curling up on top of John when he was trying to go to sleep.
Of all the places to be murdered, a pet shop wouldn't have been John's first choice. Perhaps it would have been the first choice for the woman currently sprawled out on the floor with a knife through her chest that couldn't hide the image on her sweater - a picture of a cat accompanied by the slogan 'This Cat Is Gay And There's Nothing You Can Do About It'.
John grunted. “Seems like you have to learn all over again. You’re not acting entirely human right now.”
Sherlock stepped very carefully into the trousers, and said in a small voice, "Are you going to hit me?"
John nodded, doing his best to keep eye contact. He was a soldier, dammit, and he'd walked into some of the most dangerous battlefields in the world without breaking a sweat, and yet here he was struggling to look his best friend in the eye. But Sherlock was right. It was better to get this over with.
He yawned, reaching out for the book and giving Sherlock a quick scratch behind the ears – and as he did so, there was a loud bang, and all of a sudden there was a completely human, completely naked William Sherlock Scott Holmes wriggling around in John’s lap.
In a way, he had to admire the cat's persistence. John had only ever met one human who was that persistent.
And, of course, there was the most annoying cat of all. The one who, rather than doing his job, kept picking up stranger and stranger pieces of cat merchandise and meowing sarcastically. Until today, John hadn't even realized it was possible to meow sarcastically. Sherlock was doing a damn good job of proving him wrong.
John laughed, shaking his head from the sheer ridiculousness of the situation. "To be fair, I was a bit preoccupied that day. Few other things on my mind."
“No, I’m not going to hit you,” John whispered, grinning in exhilaration, feeling like they’d just caught a murderer. “Though you kind of look like I did.”
John shook his head, leaning in for another quick kiss, just for the hell of it. “I think we both know that’s always been you.”
John had tried his best, at first, to ignore Sherlock the cat and live his life as though he was alone in the flat. This plan had utterly failed. Apparently there was some kind of secret entrance to Sherlock's bedroom (which actually wouldn't be all that surprising) because every time John shut him in the room and slammed the door, Sherlock managed to magically reappear, draped around John's neck like the world's most annoying scarf, within a matter of minutes.
"Fine, you want to be a cat, you be a bloody cat. Don't make a mess, I don't have a litter tray for you, and I'm not going to pay any more attention to you than I do when I've got a human Sherlock for a flatmate, you understand me?"
And right now, that certainly seemed preferable to his current situation. He was on his knees, attempting to examine the body, but being constantly distracted by the multiple cats roaming free around the shop. At one point, a ginger tabby crawled right over his victim, shedding hair into the wound.
John crouched down next to Sherlock, even though it hurt his knees to bend like that, running a soothing hand over his fur. “You might even be proud of me. I can recite the orders of everyone there. Greg always gets two sausage rolls and a coffee with extra milk. Stan gets an egg sandwich, a packet of Walker’s Salt and Vinegar, and a strong black tea. But Aisha… she’s unpredictable, I never know what she’s going to do next. I like that in a woman.
"Shoo! Get out of here! Go bother Mrs Hudson, I'm sure she likes cats!" John waved the cat towards the door.
"Look at this, John. It's a toothbrush holder in the shape of a cat. Sixteen years of being a consulting detective, and this is what my career comes to. Toothbrush holders shaped like cats."
John cupped Sherlock’s face in both of his hands, his thumbs stroking Sherlock’s cheeks, and pulled him into what felt like a surprisingly gentle kiss, considering how many years of built-up tension went into it.
“When you were a cat, you were sleeping on top of me, and, and sitting on my chair, and following me whenever I went out. Why? Were you just trying to annoy me, because you know how I feel about cats, or…” John let the sentence trail off, shaking his head. What the hell was he doing? “Forget it. Go get your robe."
They were back in their flat, John flipping casually through a newspaper while Sherlock made the tea. He brought two steaming cups back into the living room, handing a perfectly ordinary chipped blue mug to John, and keeping the cat shaped mug from earlier for himself.
And yet, Sherlock was delicate. He felt small and fragile in John’s arms, falling against him and melting into the kiss, a tiny whimper escaping his lips when John took a momentary pause for air. John moaned, crashing his lips back against Sherlock's, and he wanted to scoop him up in his arms and take him to bed and undress him all over again, but there would be plenty of time for that later. Right now, by far the most important thing was losing himself in the way Sherlock's lips fit so perfectly against his, and in the tiny, soft sounds Sherlock made when he felt John's tongue skate over his lips.
Hours later, John had dozed off in his armchair until he was awoken by a scratching at the door. Half asleep, he shuffled over to the door and opened it. He didn't see anyone out there, but he felt something brush against his leg, and glanced down.
Sherlock closed his eyes, his hands moving in front of him, fingers dancing, literally drawing conclusions in the air in front of him. "The first time we shared dinner in Angelo's, you displayed a significant interest in my history of romantic entanglements. Ever since our first meeting with the Woman, you have shown jealousy and monitored the number of texts she has sent me, an impressive feat of memory that is almost comparable to my own standards. While you lived here at Baker Street you largely chose to date women of a specific physical type, namely, tall and thin with dark, curly hair, however after believing that I was dead, your preferences changed to shorter blondes.  On your stag night, you placed your hand on my knee and leaned in close to me, almost as though you wished to initiate further physical contact. You took the time to deduce my birthday despite my never mentioning it when you fail to remember or even note down the majority of significant occasions, all of which leads me to believe that... that... that..."
John stared at Sherlock, standing awkwardly in the middle of the living room dressed in John's clothes, and John wanted to laugh, and to cry, and to run away as fast as he could, all at once.
John shook his head, taking a few, deliberate steps towards Sherlock. He could remember every single the time the two of them had been this close to each other. They flashed through his head, one after the other, a replay of every dazzling moment in his life since he'd returned to London...
Sherlock stiffened under John’s touch, his tail curling upwards defensively, and John had a horrible thought.
Sherlock's face lit up with the same soft blush John remembered seeing the first time he'd ever told Sherlock he was brilliant, in a cab in the streets of London on the way to investigate their first crime scene. This time, John let himself stare, his eyes wide with wonder that after all this time, all these years, against all the odds, the two of them were standing here, in Baker Street, together. Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. The two of them against the rest of the world.
"Trust the process, John," Sherlock reprimanded, picking up a pair of fluffy slippers with cat ears and tails. "Look at these, they're almost fooling even me into believing they're real cats..."
It wasn't exactly bad, though, was it? The man clearly didn't really care for Sarah, or he would have spoken to her earlier and remembered what she did for a job. And, he thought, not have nearly fallen asleep in his pasta.
"Under the sink," Sherlock replied, walking closer to the door and watching John's outline as he went looking for it.
"I've been telling you for months that you should listen to me," Sherlock said, sitting back with a grin and oozing superiority.
Jane followed Sherlock out of the building, her worn suitcase in one hand and the duffel over her shoulder. She was tingling all over from the altercation, adrenaline finally ebbing, and she was...agitated. It had been exciting, taking the man down, but the aftermath, the sitting in an uncomfortable chair and being scolded, wasn't.
John shook his head slowly from side to side and ran his hands up to grip Sherlock's neck. "You wrote to me?"
Jane stood gawping for a second, it apparently being her new pastime, and then jogged up the stairs to find Sherlock going through her duffle, folded clothes landing on the floor in a pile.
He'd been killed right out that front door, on his way to a lecture in his human anatomy class. He was walking across the street and stumbled and just...didn't exist anymore. There were all these people gathered around his body, and he couldn't seem to figure out how to get by them in his new spiritual form, so he never got to see it. He wondered if that were for the best. He must have been horribly mangled.
John breathed out forcefully through his nose and smacked Sherlock's knuckles with the metal stirrer. Sherlock winced and turned around, eyes darting this way and that. John didn't know it, but his nervous laughter was what set Sherlock's off. It rolled over Sherlock in a warm, tickling wave and they were suddenly laughing together in the attic like old friends.
"You don't get to decide that. This is an easily survivable wound," and of that Sherlock was not entirely sure, "but it won't be if you take out the knife."
Mycroft didn't sit back down, instead looming over the small table as Sherlock set out the chow mien and garlic chicken. "Sherlock."
Will our boys ever admit to such a relationship? Will we find out why the police were on scene in their old hotel rooms? Is it too much to ask for an in photo kiss? Find out tomorrow as this steamy story unfolds.
Mycroft watched him carefully, noting the sunburned skin on the tips of his ears and the fact that his trouser legs were still rolled up. "Have an eventful day?"
Sherlock scrambled for his laptop, opening it quickly and plugging in the memory stick. He couldn't account for the sense of urgency, so set it aside to never be considered again. He clicked on the icon and the window opened, the video paused at the first frame, a blurry up close shot of John's face.
Sherlock barely gave him a second to breathe, after noting that he was telling the truth, before turning and kneeling over his lap, lips pressed soundly to his neck.
John sighed happily. "I know, sorry. Sorry. At least you've got me laughing! Can't remember a better day. Not for the life of me."
"Lestrade," Sherlock said, gesturing, "this is Doctor Watson. Doctor Watson, Detective Inspector Lestrade."
John noticed the nervousness in his voice and stood with a grunt, holding his hand out. "Let's get to the water."
John closed the door and turned around, chewing his lip and looking Sherlock up and down. "You were going to show me something."
Sherlock did as he was told, breath hitching as John adjusted the machine and rested a hand on his lower back. John lifted a protective sheet and rested it over Sherlock's shoulders, smoothing it down more than he really needed to. Sherlock let his eyes slip closed as John leaned in to whisper.
Sherlock stopped him where he was and pressed John against the wall. He thrust his hips and allowed his growing erection to be felt.
John dressed quickly, wearing a coat over his vicar's clothes to fight the cold and damp, and used some pomade to tame his hair. Mrs Hudson had toast with jam, coffee and ham made up for him when he once again descended the stairs, which he ate quickly and without sitting.
When they were finally alone in a room together, waiting for Sherlock's arm to be set, he tried to explain himself.
London wasn't horribly hot, the hotel had a fan in the corner to combat the slight warmth. It was, by most accounts, a pleasant day, one meant for lazing about. Sherlock found himself walking back and forth in the main room. It was almost the size of a small flat, a whole storey of one of the most expensive hotels in the town, and a present from Mycroft. The idea that his brother might know what was to go on in the bedroom made Sherlock gag a bit.
John followed Sherlock onto the house and wondered again at how Sherlock had actually mentioned him to the people in his life. It was a difficult thing for him to wrap his head around, but...now that he thought about it, he'd bragged about Sarah. Remembering made his stomach clench and he kept his head down.
"Sherlock," Greg shouted, interrupting the juvenile behavior and stopping Sherlock from saying anything they all might have regretted.
At that, all three fell silent; the man waiting for a response, Sherlock struck dumb with her mouth hanging open, and Jane, stuck playing catch-up.
That gave Sherlock pause, but not much of it. "I've only investigated the after affects, you see. I know what makes bad men kill, I know how they must feel, I think. What I don't know..."
“A pair of black skinny jeans should do. The main highlight is the shirt anyway.” she said as she got out her dress, which was your typical strapless black, short dress and a pair of heels matching the colour of his shirt before the two of them went about getting changed and doing their hair. Janine did in fact manage to tame his hair and he had to admit that it was looking really good like this. So good that he was considering to spend that extra half an hour in the morning to actually do his hair, rather than just brushing it and calling it a day.
“See you tomorrow, Lock.” Janine said, before she walked out of the house and Sherlock just smiled a bit. Though that died down as soon as the door was closed and his mother stepped out of the living room, grinning at him.
“Sure.. go ahead.” Mr Watson said and looked up at him, “If possible though, don’t smoke.. it’s bad for your health, Mr Holmes.” He said and Sherlock was a tad disappointed that he was using his last name again, though he involuntarily smiled, when Mr Watson corrected himself, “
“Well.. it’s William Sherlock Scott Holmes, actually. Everyone’s called me Sherlock ever since I was little though.”
John moaned lightly, flushing even deeper than before as he felt his erection grow against Sherlock's thigh. Biting his lip, he shifted a bit, trying to cover it up, before he felt Sherlock's arousal hard against his stomach as the man readjusted to John's struggling, obviously not intending to let go and dear god, John didn't want him to stop.
“You’re aware that she probably thinks we’re up here to snog, right?” Janine asked, flopping down on Sherlock’s bed, which left him astonished that she hadn’t so much as scrunched up her nose at the state of his room. It wasn’t dirty or anything, but it also wasn’t tidy. Cluttered. That was probably the best term for it. Really, very cluttered.
“Fine, come in.” he called and sat up on his bed, where he had been actually doing homework for his classes with Mr Watson. It just seemed wiser not to piss him off again, that was all. When his mother entered the room, she was carrying a tray that held two cups of tea and a plate with some cookies.
"Sherlock! Get up! You gotta be in school in half an hour!" Speaking of the devil, Mummy called from downstairs as if by command.
“Is it really that bad?” Sherlock asked and nipped at his own glass. “Ew.. yeah.. okay. It is.” he said with a laugh. “Maybe we should order something else.”
“Did you bring your whole bathroom?” Sherlock asked, eying the pile of makeup and hair products. “You’re not planning to put makeup on my face, are you?” he asked and raised a brow at her.
Maybe that was the problem? Maybe John just needed to look for a female genius? Did Sherlock have a sister? Truth to be told, he didn't know. It had never been a topic before. Did he? Perhaps he would ask some time. Let it flow into some of their conversations. But that didn't make any difference. It didn't change that the thought of Sherlock's – very male – body sent shivers down his spine. It wouldn't change that he now and then dreamed about doing things with him, he'd never thought he'd ever want to do with a man.
“Well, honestly, if you had simply told me that making friends would keep me from getting grounded, I’d have done that ages ago.”
Anderson nodded. Was this really going to be discussed by the whole class now with the teacher right up there with the gossipers? Seriously? Even the grumpy girl next to him started to look somewhat amused.
Alright, so I've taken a bit of a different approach on this one :3 There really wasn't a lot that'd happen until Sherlock's birthday so I've tried a bit of a time skip, might be a bit lazy, but it felt like it'd keep it more interesting than typing out every single conversation (because that'd have been A LOT :D), but yeah it's honestly more difficult than I thought to go back to a normal writing style after three years of only rping, so basically focusing on just your characters, writing just small snippets and not really bothering with chapters or worrying about skips as long as it's fine with the other person you rp with :D anyway, I said it before and I'll say it again, let me know what you think, especially regarding the skip this time :3
“Oh, no. Not happening. You’re not turning your room into a health hazard under my watch.” His mother said, moving over to the door and Sherlock didn’t think it was the right moment to let her know that he wouldn’t be under her watch for too much longer since he would be moving out in a few months as she left his room.
“I am, this is for you.” Janine said proudly and held it up so that he could see that it was a button-up shirt.
“I wanna dance, Lock! Dance with me!” Janine said eventually after deciding that cherry shot was way too sweet and got up on wobbly legs. Even as tipsy as he was, though, he could see that this wasn’t a good idea.
, I mean.” He said and gave Sherlock a bit of a smile, though it was more of a contemplating one, rather than the easy and light one from before.
That was actually more than he could have expected from a normal friendship, right? A normal friendship would break someday if one harboured feelings like that, but Sherlock didn't really seem to care about these things. About human errors as he put it. So perhaps, if John could finally give up the hope to be Sherlock's human error someday, they could have a happy life together.
It was a Saturday, so he was understandably annoyed when his phone buzzed next to him on the nightstand, waking him up at 6 am on the weekend. He was about 99% sure it was a text from Janine, wanting to wish him a happy birthday – she had almost been more excited about his 18th than he had been, which seemed nearly impossible. When he checked his phone, though, he had to blink a couple of times, just to make sure he wasn’t seeing things.
There we go :D I'm still not super happy with the chapter but it gave me a massive writing block for some reason and I kept editing it and yeah, it's never gonna get better than this, may as well stop trying and move on :D So, I really do hope that the next chapter comes easier (and faster) :)
Back with another one :) And yes, it's still the same day in the story :D but I'll try to pick up the pace a little bit... I feel like seven chapters for a single day is kinda excessive xD aanyway, moving on, so I kinda wanted to state something... so like it's five years later.. and while I still write Johnlock everyday (I actually had the same rp going on for like three years now, it's insane :D), I've kind of grown out of writing smut as such, that isn't to say that there won't be any smut, I've just started to focus more on the build up of the scene and the aftermath rather than the actual ... devil's tango xD unless something in that scene happens that moves the story further along, that is. So all in all, it will likely still be mature, but not AS graphic as I tended to write smut scenes :3
“Hey, are you doing anything this afternoon?” Janine asked when she followed him to his locker, leaning back against the one next to it and looking up at Sherlock.
“Well, it's not like you do much to look after him," Mrs Hudson shook her head. "There's been a cat following him around, which I don't think he's liked very much. Maybe if he ever asked me how I am, I'd have done something about it."
He managed to get halfway through his cup of tea (which was definitely missing something, even though he couldn't place what) before there was an incessant scratching against his leg.
“It wasn’t a conscious choice, John,” Sherlock said, rolling his eyes, before sitting back down in John’s lap like it was nothing. ”One moment I was drinking my tea, about to make a major breakthrough on the case, and the next, I’m on all fours and you’re throwing me out of my own flat. I had to navigate life as a whole new species. It really was a highly interesting learning experience.”
John combed through his hair with his fingers in an attempt to remove all traces of cat, and then opened the door. “Aisha! Glad you could make it.”
“Yes, well, who were you expecting, the Queen of England?” Sherlock grumbled, reaching for his cigarettes. “I’ve been dying for a smoke. You have no idea how frustrating it is to not have opposable thumbs.”
"You know, if you were human, there's no way you'd be doing this," John said, half to himself and half to the cat that was still sprawled on top of him.
That said, he was definitely becoming increasingly aware of how close Sherlock’s most intimate areas were to his own. Or, to put it another way – he could feel his cock.
"Is that you trying to tell me that you would? Cause I've spent a lot of time in this flat with Sherlock, and let me tell you, there has been absolutely no cuddling." John sighed, running his fingers vaguely through Sherlock's fur. "How much can you remember, anyway? Do you still have human Sherlock's mind in there, or have you gone full cat?"
A small, skinny black cat with bright blue eyes, an arched back, and long, fluffy fur, who had just walked into the flat like he owned the place.
“Listen, I know spending the whole day lying on the sofa and making strange noises is basically your dream, but give me something here. You can’t just turn into a cat forever without giving me any warning. You didn’t even think to say goodbye?”
"How about this one? Imagine this cat watching you make tea, judging you based on whether you put the milk in first..."
John was on the point of sitting down in his chair when he remembered that a cat version of Sherlock wouldn't be able to make the tea. John supposed he'd have to go that himself.
Sherlock took a long drag, and John couldn't keep his eyes off the cat face that seemed to be watching him. It was impossible, but John swore that those beady painted eyes were following him wherever he moved.
For a moment, Sherlock's eyes were wide and his lips parted, his face completely vulnerable. But then he found his composure, even offering up the slightest twist of lips into a smile. "Yes, in retrospect 'Sherlock is actually a girl's name' may not have been the most obvious declaration of love that has ever been made..."
John frowned, taking a few steps towards the furry menace and crouching down. He squinted. Black hair with a slight curl, impressively well groomed even though he appeared to live on the streets, piercing pale blue eyes even though that was incredibly rare on a black cat, one ear held high while the other flopped over, giving him a cocky, knowing expression...
"Listen, mate, I know you're good at disguises, but this is ridiculous. Tell me this is all just part of some stupid prank."
John blurted it out without thinking. He never usually would have said anything, but this was already a pretty surreal day, what with discovering that magical cat transformations were possible, and with finding out for sure that the images of Sherlock in his uncontrollable late night dreams were, in fact, accurate. Really, what was one more surreal thing?
For the first time since turning back into a human, Sherlock looked self conscious. He hung his head and averted his eyes, shuffling his feet. "While I did not possess my human physical functions, my mental capabilities were thankfully intact, or I fear I would have hurled myself into the nearest wood chipper. In fact, within three hours of becoming a cat, I had returned to the scene of the crime scene, and with my enhanced sense of smell I had correctly identified the perpetrator - or, as it were, the purr-petrator-"
Once Mrs Hudson had left, John flopped down on the sofa, holding out his arms just like he'd gotten used to doing over the past few weeks. Sherlock climbed into them, laying his head down on John's chest and curling up. John gave him an affectionate smile, reaching down to comb his fingers through Sherlock's hair.
Sherlock was completely calm now. He padded across the room and hopped up onto John’s lap, purring softly.
“Sherlock! You’re back! I thought I heard your voice! My, you are looking rather handsome, aren’t you?”
John groaned, giving up and flopping back down in his armchair. "Alright, I gave you your chance. If you want to wait til Sherlock gets back and have him deal with you, fine by me. I'm just saying, it'll be better for all of us if you leave now. Trust me."
Eventually, they broke apart, though John kept his hands where they were, not ready to let go of Sherlock just yet.
“No. I’m not going to pet you, or cuddle you, or whatever else it is that you’re looking for. Maybe that’ll show you not to ruin my dates in future.”
They hadn't spoken in a few hours. Sherlock was in the kitchen, arranging the teacups in exactly the way he liked them, because John couldn't be trusted with the teacup index. John was in the living room, wiring up the television and the DVD player, tangled up in a mess of senseless cables.
Sherlock scrambled off John’s lap, standing up and brushing himself off. He looked completely normal, except for the fact that his hair was longer and more unkempt than usual – and, of course, the complete lack of clothes. John tried not to look, he really did, but the truth was that Sherlock’s crotch was right in his eyeline. And Sherlock seemed less concerned with covering himself up and more concerned with brushing his hair.
The main cons of both Sherlock the cat and Sherlock the human was that they both needed constant attention, and would do almost anything in their power to get it.
Sherlock looked down at himself, raising his eyebrows as though he hadn’t quite realized he was there. Then, he just raised an eyebrow. “It is a rather comfortable spot. Do you mind?”
Sherlock laughed, a full body laugh that had him doubling over and clapping Mrs Hudson on the back. "A cat? Following John around? Hard to believe any cat would want to do such a thing, isn't it?"
"Sherlock!" he called. Clearly, the bastard had finally come home, had seen the cat hanging around outside and, knowing just how much it would annoy John, had brought the thing inside.
Sherlock continued to stack his teacups, pointedly not looking at John. "You don't have to prove anything to me. After the things I've done recently I'm the last man who should be judging anyone.
Sherlock spun around so fast that John's vision blurred, placing the last teacup on top of the stack and closing the cupboard door in one smooth movement. "John, we have a lot of work to do to restore our flat, so make this quick?"
He was positive he’d been alone when he’d got on the bus, and he was sure someone would have noticed a cat using the London public transport system. And yet, somehow, when John arrived at the crime scene, there was a familiar black cat trailing behind him.
John opened and closed his mouth. He'd already said too much, more than he'd ever planned to say. He'd given Sherlock all the clues he needed, surely by now he was just doing that thing he did, the one where he pretended not to know who Margaret Thatcher was just to piss people off. John wasn't going to let him get away with it this time.
“My knowledge of human biology is matched by very few others on this planet, and I resent the implication that I may be mischaracterizing such a basic response as an erection.” Sherlock groaned and heaved himself off of John’s lap, as if it took a great effort. “But if it would make you more comfortable, then I will indeed put my robe on.”
Sherlock whined, but did as he was told, arching his back high in the air and stalking away towards his bedroom. He could tell when he wasn't welcome.
“Haven’t seen him in a couple weeks,” John replied, because he wasn’t about to say that Sherlock had turned into a cat and have Lestrade scoff at him like he was out of his mind. “It’s a bit weird. We were in the middle of a case and everything.”
"Wait there. I'll be right back." John turned and jogged to his room, trying not to seem too eager. He grabbed his oatmeal jumper and a pair of his cleanest pajama trousers, carrying them back to Sherlock. "These might be a bit short on you, but I knew you'd never forgive me if I disrupted the sock index, so they'll have to do. Now put your clothes on, because I have waited long enough to do this, and I don't want to wait any longer."
Aisha scowled, taking a seat in Sherlock’s usual chair. “I don’t suppose you have a cappuccino maker?”
Only the last one of those was significantly different from Sherlock the human's hobbies, but it was definitely a difficult change to get used to. Possibly even more difficult than the fact that Sherlock now had fur.
There were pros and cons to both Sherlock the cat and Sherlock the human. The main pro of Sherlock the cat was that he was unable to talk. John no longer had to put up with any complaining, any sarcastic comments, any requests for John to do unspeakable things to pigs' eyeballs. The main pros of Sherlock the human were that he was a great cook, he didn't seem to be the biggest fan of physical contact, and that his idea of a good time was taking John out on a case, rather than shredding furniture.
John huffed out a short laugh. "We did manage to stop some of the most dangerous criminals this country has ever seen."
"Mycroft said the same thing to me. First time I met him. He said that I missed the war. He'd have been right if he'd said it a week earlier, but by the time he took me to that bloody parking garage, I'd already found something better than Afghanistan ever was."
By the time John woke up the following morning, Sherlock wasn't yet back. It wasn't that John was worried about him. It was more that the place felt empty without him, and that John had gotten used to waking up to muffled cursing and clattering coming from the kitchen as Sherlock either worked through some fancy science experiment that John would never understand, or attempted to cook a boiled egg.
It had been a while since Sherlock had spent a whole night away from the flat, and John hadn't realized how much he depended on his presence.
John held his breath. Had the unthinkable happened? After all those times Sherlock had ruined his dates, had he finally…
"Being with you was never about a war. Because Moriarty, Magnussen, Euros, all of them... they were the ones who didn't matter, who were only the 'legends' or whatever Mary was saying we were. And I never wanted any part of that. But I dealt with them because... because..."
Sherlock blushed an even brighter red, and he brought his hands down to cover himself, as though he'd only just fully comprehended how naked he was.
Sherlock's eyes closed and his mouth hung open and John rutted against him twice more before he was crying out and coming in his pants. Sherlock shuddered and came as well, slumping in John's arms and letting out a contented sigh.
"But you're bored and a scraped foot will be the most action you've seen in over a month," Sherlock answered quickly.
They were the longest two days of John's life. He took to sitting outside Sherlock's room drinking the shit coffee they had for free at the front and taking quick looks into the room when no one was within view.
"Depends on what you want it to do," Sherlock replied, voice soft and cheeks still flushed from being buggered into the mattress only seconds before.
He turned the bent corner round right and walked to his desk, sitting crookedly on the chair and fishing around in one of the drawers until he found the tape.
"Tell me," Sherlock said, taking a bite and not waiting to be finished chewing before speaking, "do all vicars spend their time laying in the grass with strangers?"
What happened next took place in a matter of seconds. Sherlock jammed the sensible heel directly into the bodyguard’s right eye as he turned back, quickly disabusing him of the notion that she was going to go easy whilst snatching the rope from the man’s hands as blood started to flow from the socket. Ahead of them, Sherlock was just able to make out Jane’s silhouette as the butt of her gun came down on Terry’s head. The man crumpled behind her as she kneed the bodyguard in the groin hard, and pushed him into the chair.
Greg watched as they had a silent conversation, both of them tensing and then relaxing and nodding to each other. This, he thought, is going to be interesting.
John sat on the edge of Sherlock's bed for a while before he was able to pull himself away. It scared him that he could be seen. Everything he understood about his existence said that was wrong. He had got to the point where it was something he appreciated; the not being seen. He was so incredibly angry all the time that having people see him would be like having to face that anger. No matter what he said or how he looked, that was his. That was kept a secret by nature, or whatever controls the lives of ghosts.
John nodded and walked with him out the back door to where a few of the other writers were sitting and smoking. It was still cold outside no matter the afternoon sun and John pulled his coat tight around himself and raised his shoulders.
Jane snorted a laugh, and that feeling flared up in Sherlock's chest again, the one from the shop when they'd stood close. Warm, and slithering pleasantly, and god, how it was unfurling.
John slowed down the bobbing of his head, not wanting Sherlock to spill over just yet, and pressed in a second finger, crooking them and dragging them over Sherlock's prostate on the way out. He heard Sherlock choke above him and hummed when the man gripped his hair.
Greg looked on as John dragged him away by the arm, then answered his mobile and refolded the paper.
"Of course," Sherlock said under his breath. "God forbid someone without a license be right for once."
Unfortunately for him, the track his eager mind was most drawn to was one he wanted to deny his interest in. It was like swinging a flashlight around an empty room. The only thing it settled on was John, and John was so real there in his mind's eye, in such contrast. He felt he could reach out and touch the man.
The waiter came them with their drinks and they settled into their seats, eyes moving to the new addition to the stage, a woman with a sultry voice, and legs tangling in secret below the thick cloth handing from the table.
He panted and pulled his shirt off, climbing into John's lap and kissing him again. Now that the flood gates were open, it seemed, Sherlock was far from nervous. John was just fine with that.
"The how is the best part," John said, surprising himself and standing suddenly, as if to get away from the open laptop and Sherlock's words.
He had to walk around a bit more before he could focus enough to read them. The first was so explicit that Sherlock wondered how the writer could manage not to be completely creeped out. Surprisingly, though, the rest of the comments were different. Most were a simple sentence about how the reader liked the story, and some went into further detail about what they liked, but all were supportive.
John took in a quick breath, as if remembering, and shifted on his feet. "Fair point. It was, that is, last night-"
"Is that a request to desist?" Mycroft asked, his voice coming out a bit tighter than he would have liked.
And John couldn't help but gawk at the man. Christ, he was forward. But, then again, John supposed, you kind of had to be in this sort of situation.
"I suppose they can be," Mycroft conceded, thinking of the detective inspector, "for a while. Do you talk with him about God?"
It seemed less cold out, and as they walked it felt more like summer to John. He reached out and picked a seed pod, passing it to Sherlock and watching him eviscerate it out of the corner of his eye.
'I want to know more about these characters. Are they in love? I've never been in love, but I have a feeling that you were writing them as such. How does one know if they're in love? Have you been in love before?
"We were supposed to be coming on a mini-break and I was going to lay in bed and wait for you, but I was nervous, and so I went walking and I brought a wounded homeless woman back to the hotel," Sherlock explained, face pinched.
He took the mug upstairs and sat in the chair up against the window. He couldn't drink it, but he could hold it, and he did so; sitting and listening to the rain, and watching Sherlock sleep.
"Cut this off now and save us all the trouble of finding someone to take your place," Mycroft said insistently.
John growled and licked Sherlock's neck, moaning as he did and sucking greedily. Sherlock made a high pitched whinge and John drew back.
Sherlock pulled the first lid back and dug his fingers into the thick material, pulling out a woolen dressing gown with blue pin-striping. He grinned at it and went for the next. Another dressing gown, this time silk. The third box was filled to bursting with fine socks, and the last had four bow ties, all in brilliant shades of blue.
"I don't need a wheelchair," Sherlock said, trying to stand but finding it difficult with such a strong hand keeping him from doing so. "I told them I don't need a wheelchair."
"Originality is independence, not rebellion; it is sincerity, not antagonism. Or so said George Henry Lewis," John replied, eyes soft. That Sherlock could make himself into a villain so easily was tragic.
'Because you like him,' the voice in the back of his head intoned as John turned back in full doctor mode.
She pulled her gloves off as she stumbled through the front door of her flat, tossing them to the floor in a fit, because the mark was still there under the plaster.
John couldn't help but grin. He had no interest in ash of any kind, but the relief in William's eyes had captivated him. He felt something rushing through him, some thrill at knowing this secret.
When he turned around he found Mycroft standing quite close. He looked over his shoulder guiltily and stuck his hands in his pockets.
John took a deep breath and licked his lips, electricity crackling through him at the thought. "Well, come on. Come taste me."
A gun stared up at him, loaded and cleaned recently. The only reason for a civilian to have a gun, and a civilian that was quick to say that nothing ever happened to them, was to use it on intruders or themselves. From the state of the flat Sherlock could tell that John had nothing worth fighting over, (The laptop was out of date, and the only bit of electronics John seemed to own besides his mobile.) and John wasn't the type of man to make enemies. He was a soldier, yes, but more importantly, to him, he was a doctor. He healed, and healers didn't make many enemies. That left the second option.
"Not in love, then. Lust, perhaps," Sherlock said, head cocking to the side as he tried to read John's body language.
"Molly," Sherlock said, seriously wondering if the woman was cut out for work like this. "If a student throws something, you have to stop that at once. Especially something sharp. They'll take advantage. Show them who's boss."
John's eyes fell and he went back to silence, reassuring himself it would be over soon. Two weeks and he'd get the divorce she kept fighting against. Counseling, moderation, was more of a punishment brought on him than something she actually thought would help. She just wanted him humiliated. Unfortunately, it was working.
Sherlock was red all the way up his neck, and it took him a while to respond. "B-blue. Blue. Uh, Baker Street, 221."
He quickly pulled his trousers and shirt back on and pulled the key to the room from his pocket. Rolling up his sleeves, he left and locked the room and made his way down the stairs. The man at the front knew that his 'colleague' would be arriving later and nodded at him as he walked out to the street.
"It's probably due to orthodontics," she explained, pausing for a moment as if something had just occurred to her. "Unless there was trauma. Have you been hit in the face recently?"
Mrs Hudson made them a large lunch and they ate in silence, Sherlock feeding an ecstatic Merrick below the table but consuming much more than John had ever seen him eat. John watching as exhaustion finally overtook Sherlock's body. The man was asleep within the hour, laid out on the sofa and covered in a blanket.
Letters might take up to a month to get to you, and with all the injuries, fatal and non-fatal alike, I might not be able to write more than once a month. I hope you won't want to stop talking to me.
"Look...the building is full up because of the convention. I could only manage one room on this short notice and they've cordoned off both yours. Sherlock can spend the night at his brother's and-" Greg began.
The second Sherlock started digging in with those fingers, Jane knew she was done for. It was bloody perfect. The cold meant that Sherlock could apply more pressure than Jane regularly would have allowed, and Jane could already tell that she'd spend the rest of the day as a rag doll on the sofa.
Sherlock could smell the rain, and the tea he'd made that was cooling by the side of the bed, and that peculiar burning scent that always came with the first use of the radiator after summer.
He'd known the man less than a week and that was barely at all, wasn't it? He wished he had Merrick back. Merrick was good for walks like this. When Merrick was there he looked less like a fool when he spoke aloud, the dog paying close attention to his intonation and looking up at the right bits.
"W-what do you mean?" Sherlock asked, spinning through their recent arguments for anything that John would find this upsetting.
"F-five years," Sherlock said, and yes, now he could see it in his mind; Victor sitting across from him, smiling sweetly. Their first date, that Sherlock had planned. How lovesick he'd been, how foolishly romantic. "Married on Valentine's Day."
"Well," the father chimed in meekly, "he does interrupt quite a lot." And when the mother looked at him, aghast, "we talked about this."
"I told you I was working," Sherlock replied for effect, lugging his suitcase to the open shack door.
"Naked under the covers at half eleven," Sherlock murmured. "We really are taking this holiday seriously."
Mrs Hudson came in that night to find Sherlock smelling a folded up piece of paper. Smelling it. Well, the young man was odd.
Mycroft shook and started to come, his cock spurting over the shower wall as his arse clenched. When he'd finished and was happily floating he urged Greg on by crossing his legs and flexing his thigh muscles. Greg thrust hard, moving in stunted little motions and whimpering, lifting up on his toes and groaning as he started to come. It was bliss. It was unreal. It was much too early in the morning for them to not fall back into bed together.
"And suffer through all that planning again? Don't thing that eight years has been enough for me to forget the flower debacle," Sherlock said, giggling.
John giggled and slumped more where he was so he could reach the cane. "Best bloody handjob I've had in years."
He scrambled off the bed and Sherlock stood on shaking legs and pulled the duvet down. John giggled when he turned around and found Sherlock picking rose petals off his arse. Sherlock gave him a withering look and John knelt behind him.
Just as John was wheeling Sherlock out and telling him to take his medication and rest, a man burst through the back door. How he'd got by the security, John wasn't sure, but he had a knife. He was on the floor in seconds with John's knee in his back. Sherlock kicked the knife from his hand and wheeled himself back a bit to grab a roll of bandage tape, tossing it to John so he could tie the man's wrists.
"I'd say so," Jane replied, shifting on her feet and noticing for the first time that she'd forgot her cane in the shop.
Sherlock pointed to the coffee table and John rose with a grunt to retrieve the ruined shoe. He was about to speak when he turned around, but his voice gave out when his eyes fell on the far wall.
By the time Mycroft was pulling open the small dessert box Greg's socked feet were resting atop his and both their ties had managed to loosen. Mycroft watched Greg silently, loving the way the soft light from the small lamp in the corner joined with the firelight and bourbon to soften Greg's eyes. The man was beautiful like that, relaxed and sated, left side of his upper lip raising to show a bit too much teeth.
THAT PICTURE WAS FROM A GALA I ATTENDED EARLIER THIS YEAR. THE BLACK AND WHITE WASN'T MY IDEA. NOT AN ARTIST. JW
"Come back to bed," John murmured, rubbing Sherlock's thigh through the duvet with his toes. "I haven't had a lie-in that wasn't medically necessary in a while."
Several hours later, Sherlock returned with a good stack of books. John hadn't made tea, still not sure if he was comfortable with giving himself away completely, but Sherlock didn't even seem to notice. Instead, he simply lay the books on the bed and started in on another experiment.
Alone suited him well for many years. He was alone, but never lonely. He had many loves. Enough to last a lifetime.
"So, how are we going about this?" John asked, tone hushed as he tried his best not to look suspicious.
John's shoulders slumped forward and he looked into his tea. "Do you...do you reckon they're getting on?"
"I'm sorry, but we have plans we must get to," John said, nodding to Sherlock, who had only just seemed delivered back from the mental space he sometimes wandered off to.
Sherlock slipped from them and folded them haphazardly before toeing out of his shoes and socks and going to the water's edge. He dipped his foot in and splashed it around a bit before walking into the water, up to his waist.
"Vicar Watson," James said, removing his gardening gloves and going to open the gate surrounding his small churchyard. "Do come in."
Sherlock looked up at the ceiling and ran through the last year of chases and punches and dark alley brawls. Two. There were two instances when he'd been punched in the face. He scowled and admitted it was a possibility.
It was said that less than three percent of the population hadn't found their soulmate by twenty, but it had to be more than that, as she'd had stilted dinners with five men in the year since she returned from Afghanistan. Five failures to settle, her mother would say.
Sherlock grinned wide, let himself be held, and figured that birthday parties weren't that bad, after all.
"Just didn't realize how believable you'd be," John said, wondering if he should look down on this behavior.
John felt overcome with embarrassment, never imagining a time when someone would be that close to his bollocks with their mouth. Sherlock hummed and John flushed anew.
Jane sighed sat back, crossing her legs and staring up at the woman. "And," she asked, "does there have to be a reason for everything?"
Sherlock made a show of swallowing and used the paper bib-thing to wipe the edges of his mouth, locking eyes with John. "I prefer to swallow."
“That’s why I’m calling. We just had someone cancel, so you can come and meet the team today around ten today, if that works,” the woman replied cheerfully. “By the way, I’m Molly. Dr Molly Hooper.”
"She doesn't take me seriously," he said, something he'd written specifically for Sally, riding in the passenger seat car of the nondescript sedan, before the ice had melted between them.
"I'll make tea," Sherlock spat, standing so quickly in his excitement that he knocked his foot into the coffee table with a yelp.
"Small talk?" Sherlock said. He wasn't sure exactly how he was meant to act around normal people, and, although John was interesting to him, he was also normal.
It was one of the best features of the ridiculous shower, that he could move about without hitting his head on the edge, but it wasn't exactly worthy of the brochure.
Sherlock strode in and took a seat across from the parents, spreading out his limbs and attempting to look utterly put upon. John, beside him, cleared his throat.
The envelope fell from John's hands the second Sherlock climbed into his lap. He had moved across the space so quickly that John was concerned he may have been eaten whole. Instead he straddled John's lap and rested against his chest, a puppet with its strings cut.
Mike watched as the wheels turned in Sherlock’s mind. How he knew that Mike had bought two coffees was a mystery that wouldn’t likely be solved anytime soon, as Sherlock was muttering to himself that way he sometimes did when he was about to go non-verbal for a while. Mike let his ignored question go, and sat back in his chair.
Greg's teeth came into play, a sure sign that he was close to losing it, and Mycroft let the kiss turn ragged. Sure enough, Greg was soon gasping and shaking and Mycroft let himself be pulled over the edge into orgasm with one thought running mad circles in his mind.
He reached out one hand and put it on Sherlock's knee, and Sherlock sagged against him. It was apparent, then, that he was crying. Honest to god, soft sobs and tears. John ran his hand into Sherlock's hair and held him against his chest to try to sooth him.
"It wasn't as if your password was difficult. You really should update that," Sherlock said, curling in on himself again.
John looked at him in shock before picking up his coffee and turning away from him, jaw clenching. Sherlock watched the action carefully, taking in the fact that John's left hand balled into a fist, and was surprised that he'd said all that without being assaulted. He'd assumed the best way to get out of the obligation would be to be injured by one of the other writers and to threaten to sue. Pity it hadn't worked.
'In the past three days I've read everything you've written, including the email (multiple times), and have come to the conclusion that you have become my favourite writer. It's a strange conclusion to come to, seeing as I am a reader and have been for the twenty five most recent years of my life.
"You'd like it if I had work today, wouldn't you?" John chuckled, not at all put off by the man's behavior.
Sherlock let himself be moved and tucked in, but only let his eyes fall closed when John had joined him under the covers. The fan near the bed was on, earlier than it had any true right to be, so they pulled the overstuffed duvet up to their chins and fell into a synchronised bout of giggles.
It was just a relapse. Those happened. By the next day, Sherlock was back to himself. Well, himself but more shouty. He was still in a horrid mood, that should go without saying, but he was coping in a manner he was less disgusted with.
"What gave you the impression-no. No. I wasn't...Bill was just a mate," John replied quickly, his mind shifting back to Major Sholto, who was very much not 'just a mate'.
"You're just as bad as him. Couple of adrenalin chasers. Shoulda realised you two would be trouble together," Greg replied with a soft smile, it brightening his tired face.
She followed Sherlock and opened the fridge. Empty, as she'd expected, even though the cupboard seemed to be stocked well enough.
Something in his voice pulled at John. He wasn't one to leave a comrade bereft. "Course. Yeah, see you in an hour. Same place?"
"Yes, well, you have your own way of getting into crime scenes, don't you?" she said with a straight face.
“You picked the good memories of this man to keep, instead of the bad memories of the friends you lost that day. But you still have the good memories of Murray and the others,” the man said as he tipped his head to the side a bit.
The next morning, after rising and dressing for the day, John and Merrick made their way down the narrow stairs and were greeted by an unexpected visitor. It wasn't anyone John had met in town, and the man had definitely not been at the Sunday service. Merrick went to him and lay immediately at his feet.
Greg didn't play hooky. No matter how much he wanted to spend the rest of the day in a cocoon created by his newfound happiness, he dressed and said goodbye to Mycroft and made his way to the convention center.
Sherlock looked back over his shoulder to where John was tangled in the covers, and Mrs H patted his shoulder and left.
Sherlock was close to standing up out of frustration. Personal session? Christ, if John said yes, he'd have to interrupt. He watched as John's hands clenched and a flush moved up his neck. Luckily, he gave a resolute no.
You may feel out of your depths, but that's okay. You speak as if it's a fault. You jump, head first, into danger and struggle your way through and that's more than most people could say, you have achieved more than most will ever achieve. You are a marvel.
Mary wasn't exactly what she seemed. Sally said that she smelled like a cop. She brought up patterns of behavior that suggested she was picking up on the criminal element they were there to engage with.
They'd been made to take separate cars to the function, and perhaps that was John's doing. He said he had something to pick up, and wouldn't say what. He'd already given Sherlock his 'I've been away for three and a half days' presents, so whatever it was wasn't for him. Perhaps it was for this man, this mystery investor.
My therapist suggested a write a blog. Up until this point I didn't see why I should, or even what I should write if I were to start it. That is, until today. Something has happened in the last two days that I feel like getting off my chest. Here goes.
John frowned and his whole body stiffened before he swallowed and walked away. Sherlock watched him carefully, not sure exactly what he'd said wrong.
Sherlock got the first text during a case and paused to pull out his mobile, thinking it was one of his homeless network. Greg watched him as his mouth twisted and he stared at the screen in apparent confusion before typing something quickly and putting the mobile back in his pocket.
“Still buggering that Constable, are you?” Terry teased, knowing full well how much the implication bothered Sherlock.
Sherlock untied his shoes from his hip and dropped them to the floor with a clunk, pulling his knees to his chest and wrapping his arms around them. John wondered if they would take the conversation back up once the woman was gone, or if that moment of honesty was lost to them completely.
"Oh, come now, you know what I mean. They're unrealistic, and the acting is terrible," Sherlock replied, feeling a bit silly for asking. Of course John wouldn't want to watch a stupid movie with him, and he wouldn't even enjoy it, so-
"Your aunt," Sherlock clarified, walking Jane into a large sitting room and pulling away quickly to observe her.
"Only a few times with a, with a, with another person," Sherlock admitted, holding onto his knee and pressing his arse back as John's forefinger pushed into him. "Lots of times by myself."
"Just about, yeah," John said, pulling in a breath and lurching forward to slap the lid closed on the thing and grab his coat.
"I'll be back soon, hopefully," he said as he pet the dog and walked out the front door into the early morning, the sun hinting at rising, but not much more.
"Nothing strong," Sherlock said over his shoulder, and he looked so worried that John simply nodded as the door closed.
"Oh, now you'll behave. This is what it takes, isn't it? Me fucking the daylights out of you. Mouthy little brat," John said, huffing and grunting and resting his face against Sherlock's chest.
"The roof. There's a wonderful view of the harbor and a total lack of Greg Lestrade. Two of the first things I look for when finding a place to spend the day," Sherlock said smoothly, pressing the button for the upper parking complex and then slipping a key from his pocket and inserting it into a slot below the button.
When he was done with the flowers he brought the vase to the sitting room and walked back through the kitchen to what looked like his bedroom. John waited while he changed, feeling fuzzy and muddled and fantastic, and then they headed out into the world, arm in arm.
Mycroft felt something fizz in his chest and couldn't help but lick his lips in return. "I have guards on the door," he said, voice low and dangerous.
Sherlock grunted in agreement and closed the door in the porter's face. There was a strangled yell from the other side, but it was ignored in favor of the makeshift surgery.
Now, he'd been thoroughly happy living alone without anyone to talk to for a very long time, and he'd never been particularly close to even his family, but there was something different in him just then. Each time she'd spoken to him in the past, he'd run away. This time, when she opened the window and whispered a quick hello, he stayed.
After sitting for several hours reading, John decided they should head out to the field. Sherlock had mentioned earlier that a specific type of butterfly should be about soon and he was interested to see it, or at least to see Sherlock delight in a sighting. The man was always so enthralled by insects and plants. He made a very good naturalist.
"You were planning on being up here a while. Why did you pretend to fall asleep?" Sherlock asked, sighing as John wrapped an arm around his waist.
He sniffed loudly in agitation before setting up a new email account and sending the information to the writer. No matter how much he wanted to ignore the man, he just couldn't. He'd meant what he'd asked, and was set on getting answers. When he was set on something, it got done.
"Good. I was only just thinking of going out. We can stop by your old place on the way home," Sherlock said, jumping from the chair and trotting down the stairs without another word, leaving Jane to follow.
"I think that you bring others to God, and I think that's a gift not to be given up so freely," James said. "But I also think the decision to stay is yours alone."
John chuckled and leaned back, pulling Sherlock's chin up for a kiss. Sherlock sighed against his mouth, eyes bleary and red.
John was startled at that and looked back down at the file to see how he'd missed that the man was an officer. Now that he thought of it, he did dress like one of those detective's in modern shows; dark charcoal suit and white collared shirt beneath a massive coat. He chart said nothing of it. He supposed it wasn't always written down, though.
"I yelled at the editor. Nearly got thrown from his office. Bad behavior, on my part, I'm most certainty sure, but I couldn't seem to be okay after...after..." Sherlock replied.
It was late at night. Not so late that the world seemed to drag, but late enough that everything, especially the small attic, seemed overly intimate. There was one light on above Sherlock's head and one by the window, and if Sherlock could have seen John he would have felt they were acting as moths, hovering. The rain on the window was the only sound and it pulled at something in Sherlock's chest. Too quiet.
I have been in love. If asked a few years ago I would have told you it had been several times, but now I think it was really just the once. I don't know how to describe it. He was someone I wanted to protect, someone I wanted to be truly happy. I wanted us to move in together, wanted to get him away from the world that was hurting him so much. It was his job, though, and that didn't happen. I think that's love; when someone else's happiness matters to you so much that you'd change huge things in your life to ensure it.
His hands only shook as he opened up the back of the box. By the time the small packet was in his hands and the flat plate was on the floor in front of him, he could have been doing it with his eyes closed.
There was a long pause before Sherlock spoke again, long enough that John had thought he'd taken him up on the offer, long enough that John's mind started to wander into sleep territory.
When he had finished reading the letter he folded it primly and tucked it into his breast pocket before picking up the pile of drawings again and leafing through them slowly, all the while wondering how this had landed in his lap.
"You've been taking Dimmock's cases again," Greg explained. "You even told him that you'd help him with the paperwork for the latest case if he could get you in on the disappearance I refused you. Paperwork, Sherlock. Paperwork."
After school, John and Sherlock had a meeting with Derrick's parents. They were concerned that Sherlock was being unfairly mean to their son. Sherlock detested that sort of hand holding, and was telling John so as they walked to the back room when they heard someone crying in the supply closet.
"Watson," Greg replied. "Found ourselves in a bit of a bind. The coroner is off with their dying mother and we've recently lost our local GP."
Sherlock was cut off by his mobile ringing and he pulled it from his pocket, frowning at it, and answered. John watched him get in a fevered argument with the person on the other side of the line. When Sherlock finally hung up it was with a look of disgust.
Mike lit up with barely contained excitement, nearly bouncing on the balls of his feet as he continued towards the hospital, cheeks red and smile honest. John sighed internally and followed along, hating the sound his cane made as he walked.
"I know what the risk of public indecency does to you," Sherlock said, pushing his pants and trousers down.
Derrick raised his hand again and Sherlock gave in, knowing he would have the answer he was trying to get out of the lot.
John giggled right along with him. "You're right. Well, we could always just skip to the honeymoon."
He'd seen the previous drug addiction and matching stint in rehab, and wasn't planning on morphine. This patient seemed to keep forgetting he was a doctor.
A hand slid in and blocked them effortlessly, setting off the sensor and keeping the person's fingers from being crushed. Sherlock cursed aloud and continued to press, and, even as a man moved in next to him, he continued to hunch over the buttons.
He should have been annoyed. He was always annoyed when people didn't know how to use technology. He'd pulled Lestrade's mobile right out of his hands on more than one occasion to finish whatever the man had been trying to do. He refused to let Mrs Hudson touch anything with a screen for fear he'd be convinced to hang himself due to the outcome. He wouldn't even let her sign the gadget for deliveries.
John shook his head and then shrugged himself as he reluctantly let his hand fall from Sherlock's shoulder to the seat between them. "I suppose I'm a bit nostalgic."
Sherlock pushed a glass beneath it to catch the liquid spilling from the mouth and John filled the glass halfway before righting the bottle and waiting for the second glass. When he'd filled the second he held it up and tried to look serious.
Sherlock cut the omelette in half and managed to fit it all in his mouth in one obscene bite. John felt sweat prick on the back of his neck at the practical display of how much he could fit in his mouth.
"You can't leave, can you?" Sherlock asked, suddenly breathing so close to John that he thought he could taste him.
So, when he was hit by a bus and plucked quickly and efficiently from his mortal form, he wasn't in the best of moods.
He fumbled opening the mobile and almost dropped it. When he finally opened the email and started reading he huffed and nearly threw the mobile to the floor.
When they woke again, an hour or so later, the sun was coming through a crack in the blinds. It had the nerve to land right across John's eyes. He couldn't be arsed to do anything but roll over. Sherlock groaned and wrapped long limbs around him from behind.
"Tonight, yeah? Lay you out on some big, luxurious bed and just devour you whole. Just eat you right up. Feel good? Hmm?"
Sherlock nodded, eyes wide, and John smiled at him, breath stolen from his chest. They kissed again, slower this time, and Sherlock found the courage to speak.
He grabbed a marker for his pack and bit the cap, pulling at the pen and slashing through part of the message before writing. Happy with it, he recapped the pen and stuffed it in his bag, taking one last drag and tossing the cigarette butt in the toilet.
"I suppose we'll have to make our own tea," John said, walking to the kitchen and filling the kettle. When he turned around to put it on the stovetop Sherlock was standing in the doorway, silently watching him. He averted his gaze and started the burner. "Should be some biscuits in one of the cabinets."
It was the third day with sun, the ground long dried from the previous bout of rain, but it was still fairly cool out. John locked up the vicarage, for he was a man of God but knew the ways of others all too well, and zipped up the lightweight jacket he'd found the first day he'd moved in.
"You're a true blond, then," Sherlock said, fingers skating through John's pubic hair as he bent to breathe him in.
Now, John. John might actually go along with him if it was a good case. That was an even more interesting fantasy. He could be brilliant and impressive and John could see how important he was to the police. John would praise him in front of them, smile that amazed smile, and everyone would know that Sherlock was desirable to him.
“You have stories to tell,” Sherlock replied, going to the far cabinet and bringing out a bottle of amber liquid and mismatched shot glasses on a small tray. “So tell them, Watson.”
If you asked Sherlock what John said after 'breathtaking' he wouldn't be able to answer. John had uttered that last sentence and Sherlock's mind had gone fuzzy around the edges. He felt adrift.
He set the laptop down on the table in time to see John fumble with the camera and apparently turn it off and then back on again. When John started to talk to himself again, trying to get up his courage, Sherlock slammed the laptop closed and laughed hysterically.
John opened the letter the second it came in, bolting himself in his small office and walking in circles. His heart was beating out of his chest and he felt slightly ill. Christ. Oh, Christ.
Sherlock eyed him carefully and John laughed a bit, nervous and feeling stupid for suggesting this. His and Sherlock's budding friendship, or whatever it was, surely had a time limit. It was the same with the army and that summer camp he'd gone to as a child. John just wasn't one to have permanent friends.
"What the hell's he doing?" Darren asked Murray, leaning his head out after seeing his friend was watching something just outside his view.
"Meet this Jane Watson as soon as possible," Mycroft said, getting up to look out the window. "This needs to move along."
He stood at the edge of the building and surveyed the area. No one was up and about, and luckily, Doc lived offsite. If they were caught, he figured, it would only be one of the clients. They would be more likely to keep the secret and join the two for tea than give them away.
"We really could find somewhere else," Sherlock murmured against John's chest, his cast itchy against John's abdomen.
He went about making tea and breakfast, eyes flitting back to the screen even as he knew he would have to hit the refresh button to get anything to come up, and resigned himself to wait.
"You want the honest truth?" Lestrade asked, carefully staying just out of punching range, as he'd not seen Sherlock in this bad of a state since he had last been on drugs.
"Just couldn't kill them?" John asked, smiling softly as he came up to the rope swing and rested on the branch to remove his shoes and socks.
"I know the owner," Sherlock corrected, hating the flush that took to his neck. "Helped her find the man who robbed them when the police were of little help."
John opened the door to his flat, only to find the cat curled up on his favorite sitting room chair, gently mewling and licking itself.
"Oh yes? Was it that cake shop around the corner from your old flat? That always was one of my favorites," Sherlock remarked.
John reached over and switched out the light, gently scratching behind Sherlock’s ears until he dropped off to sleep himself.
Sherlock didn't get far. He had planned to walk home and instead found himself still on the property even after the stars had come out and the lights were beginning to go out in the vicarage. He sat under the large tree at the edge of the property and watched as the downstairs lights were turned off and one went on upstairs.
Sherlock's eyes fluttered closed as the waiter came to take their order. John ordered tandoori chicken and naan and nudged him with the toe of his shoe until he mumbled something that sounded enough like chicken tikka masala for the waiter to nod and leave.
What was he doing? What kind of existence leaves you pestered by a man you can't even tell to bugger off?
Greg cursed under his breath and set his drink down. "Well, it's not my bloody fault you kept that from me. Not sure why I should be surprised. That's all you do, keep shite from me."
"You didn't have to walk me to my door," John said as they came to it, hating the part of himself that thought it somehow romantic.
Sherlock felt the prick of sweat on the back of his neck as his stomach swooped to before unimaginable depths.
John was grumpy. John was a strong British man dealing with depression and insomnia. John was a veteran invalided out at his prime who hated his current situation just as much as Sherlock did. John was difficult and temperamental and under the bizarre impression that Sherlock was interesting.
Greg scratched a hand through his hair. "You know I am. And if you've come to yell at me I'll have to remind you I'm not a bloody babysitter."
He sat looking at her name at the top of the letter, the letter that was addressed to his flat, and wondered if his lack of dislike for her should make him feel guilty for reading her mail.
Sherlock narrowed her eyes and moved closer, pushing her way back into Jane's personal space like it was nothing. Her confidence was almost comical. She hummed, it a roiling, panther's purr of a thing, and seemed to take up Jane's entire consciousness.
The climbed into bed together, John wrapping himself around Sherlock's back, and fell asleep with surprising ease.
And John had to stop and scoff at that. Sure, Mr/Ms Fancypants, you're the only person to ever read anything like this that wasn't interested in the sex bits.
John felt something in him shift and he was coming, bollocks pulled up tight and twitching as he emptied into Sherlock. His thighs were still shaking when Sherlock went rigid in his lap and gave two tense strokes to his cock, spilling what semen he had onto John's chest.
"The man I was close to loving in the army," John said, feeling the memory of telling the story the first time like ash on his tongue. "He got hurt. He was pulling me to safety when the bomb went off, because I'd gone and got myself shot. I saw the fire engulf him." His voice broke, but he went on. "I couldn't save him from that, and we were never the same. Last time I saw him he couldn't look me in the eye."
"Cor, no. Just woulda liked to have gone into this with my eyes open," Greg explained, holding his pint up as John received his.
"Sherlock is talking to himself at crime scenes," Greg said, cutting into his steak and taking a bite. "Well," he added, chewing, "talking to someone who isn't there."
John nodded and licked his lips. "Under one condition; you have to tell me everything about the case."
"I'm not that far along in my learning, am I? Suppose you'll have to tell me what you said when I come back," Sherlock said with a smirk.
He didn't talk to his father for five and a half years. His mother welcomed him home for Christmas and the like, fairy lights and other decorations giving the impression that things weren't dead silent inside the house. His father refused even to meet his eyes.
"What do you want," Sherlock asked, full eyelashes lowering as he looked at his own hands, "in a partner? What do you really want?"
Sherlock was honestly shocking himself, asking for what he wanted and taking initiative had never been his thing when it came to possible romantic entanglements. That was why he'd never had a boyfriend, or even anything more casual. He just couldn't get the words out. But now, it seemed that was all in the past.
John laughed weakly and ran a hand through his hair, the room growing almost abusively warm. "Well, not as though you have my mobile number," he said, unheard.
Sherlock looked up at that and smiled back at Jane, thinking to herself that she agreed with that statement perhaps more than she should. Her hand all but throbbed in response.
"Oh?" Sherlock said, grinning and looking a bit mad. "We're at three-quarters now. Hardly full, if you ask-"
"Ah, that's too bad. My mouth is reserved for people who aren't too ashamed to date me," Greg said, bitter that they were having this conversation again.
Sherlock hummed and watched as Jane cleaned the small cut that was almost obscured by the angry skin, and applied some salve. The cream was cold and caused Sherlock to pull her hand back a bit at the touch, but she relaxed again and Jane was able to place a plaster over the area before letting go of her wrist.
Sherlock hesitantly placed his hand over John's and felt it turn so their fingers laced together, which was wholly unexpected.
Dizzy as he was, his mind worked like a beacon, sending light in only one direction. That was how he liked it. When in this state, one track mind powering along pointedly, he could focus.
Shit. Buggering shit. John knew something like this would happen. He was stupid to go out on a limb and write about a version of Sherlock, when he knew he couldn't have him. Bloody stupid. And, yes, he hadn't even met his Anonymous, and perhaps they wouldn't ever have, but he felt something there. He'd buggered it all up, and had no way to take it back and now he was left with a man who was very obviously not interested in him.
"The man was leaving the building and you just so happened to know that he was our killer? Without even seeing the case?" the tired man across from them said skeptically.
It had been years since he'd fallen so thoroughly for someone, and he felt, at the time of their painful parting, that it was a good thing. Victor had been his friend in university. They'd become close during Sherlock's last year and had even kissed on several occasions. Victor saw no reason for things to change when he was married the following year.
Sherlock stomach dropped. He knew how easy it would be for Mycroft to find out who John was, it just hadn't occurred to him that he would be asked that specific question, in that specific tone. He swallowed and scrunched up his nose.
It was a horrible thing to say about a horrible situation, but there it was. In war, he was in his element. Everything he hated about society was gone. No one expected him to smile at them and ask how their day was, no one bothered him beyond what he was there to do. Everyone had a role, and the camaraderie acted out around the basecamp was highly choreographed. Once the other men knew him, he was left to himself, left to read his medical texts and work, the only two things in life that interested him.
Sherlock watched her with some suspicion but took a sip anyhow. His lip curled and he took a quick gulp of his tea. She grinned at him.
John pushed Sherlock's shoulder with his own as they walked. "You're really going to get us arrested, aren't you?"
It was like his first date. They were sitting close to each other, and before long, their sides were pressed together. John was a little perturbed that Sherlock could see him, since staring at the man was no longer an option, at least for a prolonged amount of time, but that agitation only spoke volumes about his feelings for Sherlock.
It was much later than Mrs Hudson stayed up and the whole of the building was cast in shadow. John helped Sherlock up the stairs, his daypack over his shoulder and swaying as he did, and into the flat. It was crowded and lived in, something John never seemed to manage at any of his previous flats, including the bedsit.
Sherlock thrust and bit his lip, grunting and spilling and melting in John's arms. His utter relaxation gave John's prick a break from the hot press of him, and John found he was back on solid ground. Which was, dear god, where he wanted to be. He'd rather not try to clean come out of his pants right before dinner, after all. His cock gave another small jump at that and he focused on breathing and holding Sherlock close.
Sherlock rocked against him and sucked on his bottom lip and soon they were coming in their pants and kissing more slowly. That thought, though, wouldn't come to fruition in Sherlock's mind.
"Oh, dear god, come inside me," Sherlock growled back, finding the right angle and arching his back wildly.
John had a moment of worry; he'd never removed his clothes, he didn't even think of them as real. Could they be removed? His body, whatever it was, was responding quickly and he thought that if he wasn't able to remove the clothes he might just go mad and light the bloody house on fire-
"You had us worried sick, you did," she chirped, "getting shot like that. Poor Sherlock didn't eat on his own for weeks, but of course he rarely eats otherwise, you know."
Sally somehow managed to stub her toe pretty badly in the dark. What was even more interesting, though, was that Sherlock didn't make fun of her for it. That was something that made him pause, and he was thinking about it even as he got back to the bunk. He walked in with his head still in the clouds and found John sitting up on his bed in the dark.
"Is it cold?" John asked as he removed the rest of his clothes and stood on the bank in just his pants.
"I think we should flirt incessantly," John said, raising his eyebrows and trying not to smile. Sherlock made a strange sounding whine and John laughed. "With the readers," he said. "Try to show them how very much not dating we are."
"There's nothing wrong with being gay," Sherlock replied. "It's seen all across nature. When you exclude nature you can write your own rules, but the truth is, it isn't perverse. It's just as normal as anything else. Coupling is...coupling happens in many ways. And that's..."
"Oh, fuck," he cursed, grinding his teeth and licking sloppily into Sherlock's mouth, sucking on his tongue, biting it.
"Not horribly torn, now are you?" he asked, voice soft in a way it hadn't been in years. "We'll fix you right up. Nothing a bit of paper tape can't handle, now."
"Grumpy!" John protested, really just needing to speak to keep himself from focusing on where they had been touching.
"Now that's handsome," Sherlock said, nodding to the necklace. "John, why don't you keep this man busy while I pester his friend."
That night John asked Sherlock to go get them some takeout on their way back to the hotel. Sherlock went to a small Chinese place around the corner while John rushed into the lobby and bought four dozen roses. He jogged to the elevator and made it to their room, cleaning the fake rose petals and shit decorations and spreading real ones across the bed. The room was small, it not being the most pricey hotel in town, and it looked nearly packed with flowers by the time he was done.
"I thought you said I couldn't have this much caffeine," he said, spooning sugar into his mug and stirring.
Even after that they remained hidden for a few more minutes, breathing in tandem and not speaking a word. John was the first to move, as Sherlock had no interest in pushing him, and they finally continued on to the cafeteria.
It all sounds rather exciting. Tell me about the injuries you've encountered. Don't leave anything out, no matter how small a detail it may seem.
And yet, he couldn't bring himself to regret it. He scoffed at himself as he realised how comfortable he'd become with John, how much he wanted his company. More than any person he knew; John was interesting. And not just the fact that he was a ghost, either. John was pushy and met him at every step, refusing to back down, refusing to bend to Sherlock's will. People didn't act like that with him. They were never so stubborn unless they hated him, and Sherlock knew there wasn't hate coming from John.
The buzzing in his pocket startled him and he pulled out his mobile with a huff. On the screen were the first two messages between himself and the unknown number, plus another. He snorted out a laugh as he looked at them.
Super excited to be back, guys! The chapters might eventually get longer, but I’m rusty. Hope you enjoy, and thanks so much for the happy welcome back!!!
Soon enough, both men were laughing uncontrollably. When Sherlock decided to lift off a bit and then sink back down, the laughter turned to gasps.
When they got back to work, as married men, Mycroft kissed Greg on the cheek at his desk and disappeared to the lift. Sally stood and charged over to Greg's desk.
"Oh," Sherlock replied, as if she'd been the one to happen upon his workplace, "Molly. Have you met Bart's Director? Was that part of the hiring practice?"
The writer must have been on the internet still, because Sherlock received an email almost immediately. He sat down to read it and sipped his tea.
He expected that soon that choice would be taken from him, that Sherlock would grumble and stand, clean himself up and ask for the money and leave. What he didn't expect was for Sherlock to pull him into the stupidly small loo and under the weak spray of the shower with him. He wasn't sure he had enough to pay for the gentle way the condom was pulled from his softening cock and tied off, the way the man let him massage his cheap shampoo into those mad curls.
John chuckled and pulled his fingers out slowly, rolling on a condom and slicking himself up. Sherlock opened his eyes and propped himself up on his elbows, mouth red and wet and open as he waited.
John returned to his side and slid into bed next to him. Sherlock turned to face John and giggled at a thought.
"We should actually get clean. We don't have long before we have to be at work," he said, taking the soap and lathering up Mycroft's shoulders, hands slowly moving down.
"You're fine. You're fine. It's only a person. Christ. Christ, you're fine. You used to be a person, for god's sake," John mumbled to himself as she walked to the window and slid it open.
John left the two of them and Sherlock leaned back, arms crossed, and looked at Molly. She sagged a bit and he spoke. "What's happened?"
Sherlock continued to moan as John sucked at just the tip of his prick, tongue playing with the foreskin and hand stroking his shaft with just enough pressure.
"Do you remember that night in the field?" Sherlock asked, face pressed against John's neck where he sat on the sofa.
The door opened slowly, the street lights behind the figure there lending him a dramatic air not unlike the figure itself, and Greg watched as his boss walked through the door.
"I consider myself married to my work," Sherlock blurted, unable to stop himself from putting up some sort of emotional barrier.
Now, Sherlock had been foolish in all this, but with the letter he wrote dangling a secret in front of John he knew exactly what he was doing. He knew that his letter had been vague enough as to avoid the fact of his actual identity. John's response had left him back at the beginning again. He'd been hoping that John would force his hand, as he found himself an utter coward.
"How can you...how can you expect me to forget that? How am I supposed to ever trust you?" John pressed, eyes falling closed and hands clenching.
Sherlock had the same feeling and consoled himself with the knowledge that he hadn't done anything wrong, that men just didn't really like him, and that was par for the course.
Greg laughed and rode him, pumping his cock in his fist and wrapping the soft material of Mycroft's handkerchief around the head of his prick just as he started to come.
"I think I had a bit too much to drink last night," Mycroft grumbled, pushing forward and slumping against Greg.
She let herself remember talking to Sherlock in the alley, believed she could smell Sherlock's cologne on her skin. Remembered her words; just your sort of thing, Captain. And, oh, that did it. Dark mesmerizing eyes, plump bottom lip, and those fingers sliding up her thigh.
They finally made it to the cabin as the lights on the walkway were blinking on, the sun just a memory. Sherlock tried to stand as heterosexually as possible. 'Lead with your crotch,' he thought, 'think power.'
John snorted and licked his lips and Greg had to put a stop to it at that point because the look in his eyes was practically pornographic.
He'd convinced himself in the fifteen (not bloody five) minutes since their little tussle with the baddie in the hallway that he wasn't attracted to John. That he was interested in him intellectually, and that was it. He told himself that the man might come in handy somewhere down the line. The second they were sitting across from each other in the small booth at the Indian restaurant, that sureness disappeared.
"W-well," the mother started, "Derrick says that you don't call on him in class. He says you avoid him, even as he has his hand raised for every question. He says it's obvious you don't like him, and-"
Sherlock had slithered down his body as John panicked and was now rubbing his face along John's crotch and inhaling deeply. John didn't have to wait much longer for the answer to the previous worry, as Sherlock was yanking his denims down and rubbing his nose into the coarse hair covering John's bollocks. John was panting and trying valiantly not to thrust his hips, but the battle was lost when Sherlock took his cock between his lips and hummed.
There was a shout in the background and another man walked into the room. John said a hasty goodbye and the other man easily turned the camera off.
Sherlock smiled and ordered a tea, John thinking how peculiar the man was acting. Sherlock had been clearly smitten for a while now, but he was always soft spoken and had trouble looking John in the eye. When he did speak it was gruff state of fact, not this curious thing he was doing now.
His brother's voice chimed in to remind him how ridiculous that thought was, both that he had missed something and that reading this story would help in any way, but he pushed it away.
Greg said goodbye to the security guards and pulled on his jacket, the sky already dark outside his office. The mild weather from the week prior was completely gone, leaving London ensconced in clouds and the near constant threat of rain. He wrapped his scarf tightly around his neck and tucked the ends into the collar of his jacket before walking out onto the street.
They stopped by John's bedsit on the way to Baker Street and John was relieved when Sherlock stayed in the cab, tapping away on his mobile and barely giving John's exit a glance. The empty space was painful to be in, even with linens on the bed and new curtains. He got his laptop as quickly as possible and left, sticking his revolver in his waistband at the last minute after remembering Sherlock's first case.
"I bet," John added, pausing to lick his lips and look right into the camera, "I bet you're breathtaking."
He was reminded of spring coming to Narnia in a book he read years before, and tried not to pay too much attention to how romantic a thought it was. 'You aren't a frozen land under an evil spell,' he reminded himself, 'you're just an idiot in an unhappy marriage. No one is coming to save you. There is no spell to break.'
Sherlock shook his head and wondered at how much children picked up without your knowing. "No, he's, he's a new friend. A vicar."
"Too far gone to explain? I understand, I understand. You worked so hard today, didn't you? Running after baddies like you do," John said, smirking.
John leaned in and, for the first time, kissed Sherlock gently on the lips. Sherlock melted into him and started to cry again, and John stroked his neck to calm him.
A servant walked into the room and handed Greg a pint, already prompted by the other man as to what to pour. Greg pulled on it and closed his eyes.
Sherlock felt his cheeks heating up. The way John spoke the words, they seemed fragile and real. It was stupid how they made him feel. He wanted them to be John's words.
"Christ, you're so gorgeous," John murmured, leaning in again to lick at the seam of Sherlock's lips.
Sherlock whimpered and started to thrust. His eyes rolled back in his head and the whimpers turned into groans as his body took over, seeking its own pleasure. John felt him twitch and gripped his arse as he started to come, warmth growing where his sticky release soaked John's skin.
"It's just here," Miles said, kneeling and pulling frostbitten frozen dinners and soupy expired veg from the box and onto the floor.
"Sorry," John said, standing stiffly and not turning to face Sherlock. "Small spaces. They, uh, I'll take the stairs."
"Says your name like a prayer sometimes," she added, and then, looking back up, "well, do you talk?"
Sherlock shrugged and poured some of the oil into the steaming water. "Oh, that. Some days feel like black days, don't they?"
The doors were summarily closed and Greg walked closer to the fire, fingers cold and reaching out reflexively.
"What will you do if she isn't right? It won't be like bringing a dog to the vet, Sherlock," Mycroft continued. "Are you prepared to murder her to put her out of her misery?"
Sherlock wasn't one to fall fast; when he was enamored with someone it came on slowly. The last time he'd felt that way about a person was in uni, and he'd taken nearly a year to warm up to the idea of romance with the man. It was a shock how easily things between himself and John had progressed. He found himself not only wanting John physically, the thought alone pricking the hairs on the back of his neck, but wanting desperately to KNOW the man.
John glanced over at him and smiled softly. A wave of warmth rolled over them and the lights flickered and Sherlock felt a soft brush against his neck.
He only managed just to finish the story before he was scrambling to the shower to work one out, panting against the fake tile and clenching his eyes closed.
The air was thick as he found his way to the small thatch of trees, their branches heavy-laden with leaves. He sat beneath them and pulled off his shoes, watching them fall to the ground slowly.
“That’s, thanks, yeah. When can I come in to, erm-“ he replied, trying not to sound as gruff as before.
John nodded and set the book he'd been reading aside, standing and walking into the kitchen. Mrs Hudson was in town doing the shopping so he was left to his own devices. It took him a while to find the tea and he realised he'd been taking advantage somewhat. He cleared his throat at the thought and went about heating the water.
"And while I'd so like to pick that apart, you're about to be late for your first class," Sherlock added.
“What you did back there…” Sherlock said, voice serious, “it was good. I take it you stashed the gun?”
John was in pain, obvious pain, and that did something very uncomfortable to Sherlock's insides, twisting something in him and causing him to reach to the side of the bed and rest his hand there. John blinked his eyes open and grimaced, taking a shuddering breath and swallowing roughly.
