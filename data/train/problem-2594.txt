Dean nods and turns back to Cas. “I saw your car in the lot and thought... with the motel and the late nights, I—” he laughs again and runs a hand through his hair. “I can't believe you ditched me for cats.”
And that’s how Dean found himself sitting on a plane, white knuckling the armrests and humming Metallica under his breath, eyes squeezed tightly shut.
The monotonous chanting continued and Dean pulled a book from a nearby shelf and held it out in front of himself. When there was a brief space in the chant, he smacked himself in the head.
“Well,” Castiel sighs. “I suppose that’s the thing, isn’t it. Perhaps I’m not that different from him after all. He’d been reprogrammed, you know. Most likely by Naomi or angels like her. I could see the damage in his eye— that one’s a common trick of theirs. He was twitchy and his grace was fragmented, like he’d been broken apart and put back together too many times, and with too many pieces missing. And his wings… those were something awful. Mangled worse than mine, even. Like someone had ripped them out.”
He kisses up the column of Dean’s throat as Dean tosses his head back. He nuzzles softly behind an ear lobe and down the line of Dean’s jaw.
The hunt is done and they are heading home, just in time for Christmas. But the two of them have been bickering for hours. They do this
It’s fine, really. No big deal. Just two friends sharing a bed. Eventually Cas curls towards the wall on his side of the mattress and is courteous about not pulling the blankets with him. Dean lays on his back, staring aimlessly up at the ceiling and listening to Cas’s breathing even out. The cadence of it is soothing, and he closes his eyes and lays perfectly still. But apparently not still enough, because after awhile Cas huffs, still facing the wall.
Dean laughed. “Yeah, maybe. Not sure I’ll have enough time though. We should probably take a look at those annulment papers today because my car should be ready by tomorrow. Tuesday at the latest.”
“You can stay with me, just for tonight,” Dean decided. “Someone should keep an eye on you.”  He shut the door so Cas couldn’t get far if he decided to go exploring and set the bowl down on his bedside table.
, Dean realized in growing horror. He looked quickly down at his phone. 11:32 am. Sam was getting married a little less than five hours from now. And Dean had either missed the bachelor party entirely or been there but gotten so smashed that he wound up in bed and married to another guy. Either way, it wasn’t good.
This was what he needed, Dean reasoned. A good, hard, fast fuck and he’d be able to put this guy out of his mind and go on with his life. A quick, no-strings-attached night of fun, and Dean would be able to stop fantasizing about what it would be like, would be able to sleep at night without dreaming about blue eyes and all the different things those sinful lips could do.
Dean smiled, and settled back in his chair, facing Sam and Eileen. Sam’s leg was shaking and he was practically vibrating out of his chair.
When the credits rolled, Dean yawned, stretched, and turned to look at Cas who was still staring intently at the screen.
To Cas’s credit, he doesn’t seem upset. He kisses his way back up Dean’s torso and arches a brow at him. Dean shrugs helplessly and Cas smiles fondly.
Dean’s wasn’t sure what to say to that, and he lost his train of thought briefly watching Cas lick syrup off his lips. He was saved by the sound of his phone buzzing.
“Mr. Novak was involved in a hit and run accident. He came to us badly injured. We’re not sure how long he’d been there in the road before someone found him.”
They drift closer as the night wears on, until they’re snuggled together in the middle of the couch. Doctor Sexy fades into the background as Dean explores the contours of Cas’s mouth with his own.
he thought. Cas’s five disc changer contained Dean’s CD, Vivaldi, Gregorian Chants for Meditation, Taylor Swift, and Beyonce.
“Yeah, Dean. I love her. I know you think this was spur of the moment, but it’s really not. I’ve loved her for a long time. You’re the only person I want there with me, but you should know that I’m doing this with or without you.”
Left alone in the living room, Dean took in his surroundings again. The TV on the wall was the largest Dean had ever seen. Everything around him was modern, but monotonous shades of grey and black. Balthazar had been chirping contentedly in the corner but his noises turned to angrier squawks when Cas left the room and only Dean remained.
Cas nodded as he flipped through the pages and tried not to sneeze as dust bunnies billowed up from everywhere. It seemed more like an old family almanac than a grimoire, in Castiel’s opinion. Sure, there were some odd symbols and Latin scribbled in some the margins, but it was mostly instructions for herbal remedies: cures for allergies, warts, and headaches, all of which called for perfectly natural ingredients like nettle and goldenrod.
And Dean had been there in high school when Castiel came out as gay. Castiel had been both relieved to rid himself of such a secret and terrified of how Dean might react. He needn’t have worried though, and their friendship never faltered.
Dean tried very, very hard not to think about Cas. But as the desert flashed past him, every time his mind started to wander, his thoughts circled back to sad blue eyes and soft whispers. He shook his head to clear it.
In the alley outside, she kissed him hard and ground up against him. Her breath was stale and tasted of smoke, but Dean dove in, wrapping her legs around his waist and lifting her against the wall. She giggled, and he buried his face in her neck. He was surprised to find that he was fighting back tears. She was exactly his type, and Dean wanted nothing more than to have a few minutes of hot, hard, no-strings sex to get his mind off things, but something inside him ached and everything felt wrong.
Cas stands abruptly, sending various cats scattering and furrows his brow in concern. “Dean, what are you doing? You shouldn’t be here.”
He rushed into the hallway and stumbled bleary eyed down to the kitchen which was billowing with black smoke. In the middle of it all, Cas was coughing and waving an oven mitt back and forth a little uselessly, trying to clear the air.
“I’m sick of this. I’m so horny I can’t see straight and you’re having pornographic thoughts about a pie.”
And Dean could have pulled away— should have pulled away when Cas’s hands came up to either side of his face and held him, inches from his own. Instead, Dean found himself leaning closer.
They go back to alternating blow jobs on the couch, but with some of the awkwardness now behind them. Dean certainly seems more relaxed. By contrast, Castiel’s anxiety has only grown with each passing day because he’s not sure what to make of Dean’s flippancy. Whenever they finish, Dean chuckles and cleans himself off and they carry on— like they haven’t just swapped frenzied blow jobs and made each other come hard enough to see stars.
Dean rolled to block out the light and buried his face in the warm mound of blankets next to him. He inhaled an unfamiliar, but not unpleasant scent. It was deeply soothing, and Dean was pretty sure he could stay like this forever. Warm, dark, perfect. Nope, he would not be opening his eyes any time soon.
He nearly lost his cool again when he took in Cas’s post-shower hair and the little trickle of water making its way down his neck.
. He wasn’t sure what, just yet, but there was an uncomfortable feeling brewing in his gut whenever he thought of leaving. Perhaps he was just coming down with something. Brushing the thought aside, he prepared to get down to business.
He kisses the freckles on Dean’s nose and cheek and just above his lips. He kisses along his jaw and down the column of his throat. He tastes at the space behind his ear and then continues lower. He latches onto a nipple and Dean groans, stoking the fire that’s growing in Cas’s belly.
The sight took Dean’s breath away. Cas looked completely debauched; his eyes hooded, cheeks flushed, lips wet and swollen. Dean lay panting, and realized that he probably looked much the same.
“I asked you how long,” Cas says, and he takes a small step towards Dean, his voice softening. “Now ask me.”
They didn’t talk about that either. But the touches between them grew more charged. Soon, Dean found himself reaching for Cas constantly— more than he ever had before. Just to touch his shoulder, bump against him, let his fingers linger on his arm. There had been that one heated moment in the bunker’s exercise room before Sam had interrupted, when they’d been sparring, and Cas had him pinned to the mat, and Dean could have sworn he felt something hard pressing against his thigh. He was sure Cas must have noticed the same from him— certain they were only seconds from rutting against one another if Sam hadn’t walked in.
It wasn’t a question, so Dean didn’t bother with answering. “I have to go,” he whispered. But he couldn’t seem to make himself move.
He tried to remember why he’d been fighting with Sam, but his thoughts kept returning to blue eyes and tousled hair and full lips and...
“Any luck in Heaven?” Dean asks as Cas makes a beeline to him. Cas looks exhausted, his shoulders hunched and weary, so Dean’s pretty sure he knows the answer.
There are a million things he wants to say. A million little explosions happening in his brain, and he’s having trouble processing. Having trouble believing that any of this is real right now. Any moment, Cas is going to laugh and the whole thing will have been a joke.
Dean pulled another chair next to Castiel and spun it around so he straddled the back of it. It squealed on the tile and Castiel looked up. The apron just barely covered Dean’s spread legs.
“Fine, fine,” Cas grumbles. Dean whirls just in time to see Sam knock the gun out of the stunned preteen boy’s hands.
“Ugh, I’m bored,” Five gripes, throwing himself backwards on the couch. “There’s nothing to do. No one to kill.” Disappointingly, the Temps Commission has stopped sending more agents after Five, probably realizing he thinks of them merely as dummies to practice his murder skills on.
“Kara said she’s tried it before,” Jo says, but her tone is obviously uncertain. “What do you think Bobby will think?”
You turn around at the sound of your name and smile when you see Cas. “Cas! I should have known the shouting was Dean. What are you doing here?”
“I don’t want to worry you.” Sam shakes his head, ready to say something about how he can help, but Dean knows firsthand how much pressure it is to take care of your brother. “You don’t need to worry about me, Sammy. You hear? Everything I have ever done I’ve done for you and I have not regretted a single moment. I just want you to be okay, Sammy.”
“You’re paying double the next time you come in,” you inform him and hug your cat, who meows in protest and tries to get out of your arms immediately. “Thank you so much, Sam.”
The cameras weren’t lying about the Capitol’s grandeur. The spires of the shining city are gleaming white marble. Everywhere you look is polished white, which makes the people look even more striking, which Dean is sure was their goal. They stroll around with their bright colors, so different from the dull ones in the districts. Here people look like glittering insects. In the districts people could blend into the ground or the forest what with how stick-thin and dirty they all are. Even the mayors, even the Peacekeepers.
“It turns out Claire has a friend named Alex whose grandma died when she was about six. We haven’t met her yet, but Sean already seems sold.”
A fluffy orange monster jumps onto his bed and right off it before bolting over to the small kitchen. Sam can only watch with an open mouth as it jumps onto the counter and into an empty shelf, conveniently just above how far you and Gabe can reach.
He knows they’re Cas’s brethren but Dean has never trusted other angels. He thinks of Naomi and Metatron and the skeptical, suspicious, uncomfortable feeling in his gut continues to grow.
The first brush of Dean’s lips against his was soft and tentative, and Castiel responded eagerly. He slid his hands up Dean’s neck and let his fingers thread through his hair. Dean made a pleased sound, and then laughed, and Castiel pulled back in confusion.
"Yeah," Sam nodded. "Perfect opportunity for monsters of any kind to blend in with their surroundings, really. What do you say, Dean? Should we check it out?"
As it turns out, it could have been a lot worse; the fireworks malfunctioned and although they went off early, they didn’t explode at their full capacity. Still, both Dean and Cas find themselves with moderate burns on both palms and a long lecture from the ER doctor who reminds them repeatedly that they could have lost fingers or worse.
And fuck yes, Dean wanted that. He wanted more, wanted everything that Cas was willing to give him. But something made him hesitate. Perhaps it was the look in Cas’s eyes; his expression was soft again, and he gazed at Dean with unchecked affection. It was unnerving, and the level of intimacy flooding between them in that moment was more than Dean could bear. If he didn’t get a handle on himself quickly, he’d be in deep trouble.
The wedding itself didn’t take long at all. Dean watched his little brother sign his vows to his wife in slightly clumsy but practiced movements. Sam and Eileen gazed at one another like there wasn’t another soul in the world. It was sweet, and yet Dean still swallowed a lump in his throat.
“Well, thanks buddy. That was. . . that was really something.” Dean wanders off in search of a towel while Castiel’s heart sinks.
Twenty minutes later the kitchen was starting to look like a kitchen again, and Dean was getting to work on some fresh omelettes and hash browns. Cas’s pancakes didn’t actually look all that bad. It turned out he’d been trying to keep them warm in the oven, but instead of putting the warmer on, he’d set it to broil. Dean had managed to rescue them just in time. A minute more and they’d have been charcoal like the eggs.
Dean shifts uncomfortably. “Well, we can’t use our hands, so we’re useless on our own. But if we teamed up. . .”
Dean’s forehead dropped to bump against Cas’s and they looked down together at the sight of them sliding together. Dean managed to get his hand around them both. It was dry, and a little too rough, but so fucking good he was close to breaking apart.
Dean obliged, but did so reluctantly and fiddled with the cuffs. He felt like a Ken doll that Cas was dressing up and parading around. With every new suit he was forced to try on, he felt his dignity slipping slowly away. “This is ridiculous,” he said. “Why do you keep making me turn around?”
mess up this suit,” Cas growled, one eyebrow arched high. But there was no malice in his voice, and the twinkle in his eyes gave him away.
Cas slid off the table and held a hand out to Dean, who grasped it and pulled himself to his feet. Cas was still squinting suspiciously at him and Dean couldn’t help but smile.
Dean could feel himself blushing. “Well fine, then we can say we were drunk. They can annul it if we weren’t in our right minds, surely.”
Sam spluttered. Evidently he had given Dean a drink the previous night to combat his allergies to cats. Something stronger than Benadryl, as the girl Dean was trying to hook up with lived with several and he hadn't yet been able to spend the night on account of how sick they made him.
But the look Cas gave him was not one of pity. It was something else entirely; an odd sort of look that Dean couldn’t quite put his finger on. Almost a look of… recognition? It was not at all what Dean had been expecting, and he had to wonder: was Cas harboring some sort of dark and tragic past of his own?
Dean stands on his lawn, surveying the house that now bears his name on the deed. It’s a rundown old thing, in dire need of a new roof and a dozen other imminent fixes. But it’s in a nice neighbourhood and it’s his, and that alone is almost cause to smile. Almost. He doesn’t though, because his gutter chooses that moment to collapse with a screech of metal on the left side, sending the stray cat who has taken to sleeping in his front bushes scurrying.
“And for good reason!” Dean threw his arms up emphatically. “That plane was a friggin’ death chamber hurtling through the air and I’m just expected to sit there and be calm? Not fucking likely,” he muttered.
“Yeah. We gotta sort these papers out first.” Dean gestured at the annulment papers scattered across the coffee table. “We’ve put it off all day.”
Dean supposed they could. It shouldn’t take that long, and it was still early in the evening They had time for one more movie, and then they could take care of business after. He left the papers scattered on the coffee table and relaxed back into the couch. Cas pointed the clicker at the TV and
Dean pawed at the front of Cas’s pants in blind desperation, until he finally got a hand inside. His hand wrapped around Cas’s cock, and Dean’s eyes fluttered shut at the feeling. The hefty weight of it, hot and throbbing.
It wasn’t an entirely unappealing idea, Dean mused. Cas as his date. He looked like he would clean up nice. He gave his head a shake, realizing how absurd he was being.
Dean laughed, and they both fumbled at the buttons of Dean’s shirt. The costume peeled away and Dean leaned back to yank his t-shirt over his head, tossing it unceremoniously into a pile on the floor. Cas was on him in an instant, pressing hot kisses over his chest. His breath was hot, his tongue flicked over a nipple, and Dean jerked forward, cursing.
Dean's face glows in the light of the small flame and his freckles are cast into sharp relief. When he looks up and grins, his green eyes blaze with a certain maniacal glint that Castiel is all too familiar with. He should stop this, he really should. But Dean has already lit the fuse on the firework he holds, and he's pressing his lighter to the base of the one in Castiel's hands too.
Cas pulled back, and with a firm hand to Dean’s chest, shoved him down onto the bed. Dean fell back, grinning, and landed with a soft thump. Cas came sidling after him, his weight pressing Dean down into the mattress. That too, was a new sensation. Cas was a solid line of hard, unrelenting muscle where before it had always been soft flesh and curves. The hot, heavy weight bearing down on him made Dean feel surprisingly vulnerable in a way he never had before. But it also made him feel oddly safe and he was startled to realize just how much he trusted the man sprawled on top of him, pinning him to the bed.
The ride back to the bunker passes in icy silence. Dean is seething and the more miles they travel, the angrier he gets. Fucking angel with his fucking death wishes. He glances over at the angel in question who is sulking and staring resolutely out the window. Only an hour ago their fingers were brushing together on the space between them. Now that space feels like miles and is immeasurably colder.
“I actually had an encounter with my brother as well. Michael. He called and we had some… harsh words.”
"No,” Dean says, and Castiel can see the dawning horror on his face. “No, that can’t be.” Charlie remains silent, and so he turns, and looks imploringly at Castiel.
They found the phone under the sofa, next to one of Dean’s shoes and a lamp that had been knocked off the end table and shattered on the floor. The bulb was broken and Cas carefully picked up the broken glass while Dean righted the lamp and straightened up with his phone.
Dean’s stomach lurches, and he tries not to visibly tense. Cas notices though, and reaches for Dean’s hand, stroking softly against the inside of his palm.
Then he thinks of some of the things he’s said to Cas just this past week alone when he lashed out in anger and how Cas had taken that too.
Cas decided for him, and stood in one fluid motion, still holding Dean in his arms. Dean let out a grunt of surprise as Cas hoisted him up and carried him the few feet to the bed without any apparent strain. Dean contemplated the myriad of possibilities afforded by angelic strength as Cas’s wings fell away and he laid Dean downon the bed carefully.
True to Cas’s word, the diner was only a short walk down the street. Dean’s stomach continued to grumble as they entered and were hit with the smell of bacon frying. It was a little classier than the diners he was accustomed to back in Kansas, but bacon was bacon.
But all at once, there was a sudden gust of wind. A blinding flash. A sweep of something long and dark across Dean's line of sight.
Dean munched on the popcorn that Cas had settled in between them, and tried very hard to focus on the movie and not on the man sitting so close to him. He eventually relaxed, and by the time Han Solo was frozen in carbonite, he was so into the movie he had forgotten all about Cas. He was soon reminded when he reached into the popcorn bowl absent mindedly and bumped hands with him.
He was with his girlfriend Eileen; a sweet girl with big doe eyes to match Sam’s own. Dean had bristled a bit at this unexpected intrusion into what he thought was going to be a guys’ weekend. It had been so much worse than that. Sam was getting
On Saturday, he pulls his impala — his baby — out of the garage and into the driveway. He waits until Castiel is outside gardening before he heads outside himself to wash his car wearing his short shorts that leave little to the imagination.
Cas swallows him down. Above him, Dean lets out a loud hiss, and Castiel’s brain short circuits a bit because
They stare at each other for what feels like forever. In only a few short minutes, everything has changed and the weight of it hangs heavy in the silence between them.
Baby can see the start of a faint blush creeping up the back of Dean’s neck. He’s stopped shivering by now, but hasn’t bothered to move from Castiel’s side.
He remained frozen against the wall, limbs pinned helplessly. A glance in Cas's direction saw him in much the same predicament. The pressure on Dean's throat tightened, and his vision narrowed further as white pricks of light began to dance across his retinas.
“What, um…” his brain searched desperately for words and how to string them together, but it just wasn’t working. “Paralysis?” he asked weakly at last.
“The other day, when I was calling to Meg, and— I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have laughed.” Castiel looks pretty devastated, actually. He looks about as embarrassed and uncomfortable as Dean felt the other day.
"Hey, Cas?" Dean asks, and Cas hums but doesn't look up from petting Meg. "Why didn't you tell me this was where you've been going? At first I thought you were staying late at work. And then I thought… well, you know."
Now that Cas was closer and his face was no longer in shadow, Dean could see the outline of dark bruises on his face. His lip was cut, one eye was swollen, and there was an ugly gash on his neck. Dean sucked in a breath at the sight and reached for Cas’s face without thinking. Cas flinched and leaned away before Dean could make contact, and he dropped his hand, curling it into a fist at his side.
to the doe-eyed girl. The impromptu bachelor party was that night and the wedding was happening the next day.
“Yeah, you too.” Dean started to leave, feeling Cas’s eyes on him. He turned back when he got to the edge of the room and Cas quickly averted his gaze. He had settled back into the couch, legs curled under himself.
“I apologize,” Cas immediately says, standing up. “You are exhausted as well. I will try to contact Dean and help him find his phone. He still doesn’t know about Fluffy’s new veterinarian. Hopefully today will be a slow day of work. Goodbye, Sam.”
More snapping has the camera moving around in a frenzy. The people walking on top of the Justice building hadn’t been stupid to stand up straight; they’d been a distraction. There are people on top of every building in the Justice Square, all unfolding their own anti-Capitol banners. One reads DOWN WITH THE CAPITOL. Another says NO MORE DEAD CHILDREN. Dean’s stomach drops more and more as he reads VICTORS ARE MURDERERS and DISTRICT 13 WILL RISE.
Dean blinks. Is Sam trying to counsel him? Make him feel better? That’s not Sam’s job. He doesn’t need to do that. “I appreciate that, Sam, but I’m really fine.” When his brother doesn’t look convinced, Dean insists, “I really am fine, Sam. You’re the one I’m worried about; Dad leaving all the time, me never being here… You know I’d do anything to stay, right? You know I don’t
Jo spends the rest of the next day gloating about how she only owes Dean fifteen dollars now, and that the number’s sure to drop until Dean starts owing her too.
“Huh. Well, you go, Casanova.” Sam wishes he could be as brave as Dean was when he’d finally asked Cas out. Look where it got them: they’ve been going steady for two years and the only fights they ever have are about throwing themselves in the line of fire while doing their jobs.
“Nothing important.” Dean grunts as he flops down on the couch. “I don’t think the program will be very interesting for the rest of the day, Sammy. We already got that chase and both District 11 tributes died, so they’re probably not going to force another confrontation until at least tomorrow afternoon.”
“Uh…” Dean knows he has to get back to his universe. He has a responsibility to save the world, of course. But it was enjoyable to hear about other people’s crazy lives and be able to relax. He settles for gesturing for her to follow and he leads her out to the courtyard.
Klaus says out of the blue, “No, I will not!” He flushes when everyone turns to look at him. “Ben told me to tell Diego to throw a knife at Jack since it won’t hurt him either.”
“I could just cut him,” Diego wheedles. “Just to see if it makes a cut and then it heals or if nothing happens. Come on. We don’t know how angels work.”
All of Dean’s walls come flying up. Charlie wanted to be a Gamekeeper, which means she wanted to brainstorm different ways to brutally murder children. She’s the same as the rest of the insects. Her outsides just don’t match her insides yet.
As if he can’t help it, Sam stomps his foot. Dean hadn’t even noticed him standing up. “Why don’t you tell me what’s going on with you? You think I haven’t noticed your nightmares, Dean? You think I don’t know they’re my fault?”
Dean scowls. Well, yes, there is (but only sort of) a looming apocalypse on the horizon, but she wasn’t supposed to know about that. “Why? What’s in it for you?”
“And me and my brother aren’t either of those things,” Sam realizes. “Which would be why he hates us.”
The ghosts have faded, especially with Sam here, but they’re not quite silenced. This is the closest place Dean has to their memories. Something slithers to his right and for a moment it sounds exactly like a knife soaring through the air, thrown by Wendy and coming straight for Dean’s back. Maybe that bark of a fox is a quiet gunshot, the bullet ripping into Vam Pyre. Or maybe it’s coming from the hellhound that tore Bela Talbot to pieces.
That shuts Dean up for a while, but the comparison must explain it all to Cas, because he gives an exaggerated nod.
On the bright side, at least Dean’s not District 12. Not even he and Jo could pull off those miner’s outfits.
“How—how do you know about that?” Sam asks, already blushing as he glances at the door. You’d closed it behind you. Hopefully you can’t hear what they’re saying, though the only way that would happen is if you were eavesdropping directly the behind the door.
Y'all, I have started my job and work around 32 hours a WEEK. My feet hurt so much. Also, school has started and I'm already behind in all my classes so that's fun. Please review; you're the only thing keeping me going.
“I’m polite, Sam,” you reply without looking back at him. “I don’t do it in front of the owners, but I bet you won’t tell on me. And I don’t really curse at people I barely know.”
He’d bet that these rooms go unused except for just before the Games, but that doesn’t matter. What does matter is how Dean needs to control his expressions. If the Capitol finds out about his revulsion for them, there’s no way he’ll get sponsors.
“Hey!” Dean barks, making all the spectators jump. “What did I say? Did I say no cutting Jack open or did I say yes cutting Jack open?”
The trees are casting long shadows by the time Sam and Dean are ready to go back. Crowley doesn’t look like he’s moved at all. He also doesn’t look like he’s been sleeping, since he looks up at the first sound of voices.
He sighs and drags a hand down his face. “Soon, I assume. Naomi doesn’t like me to spend too long without making a public appearance and stirring the Capitol’s enthusiasm. I trust that she’ll at least give me until Gregory Washington wins.” He says it pointedly, sure that if Naomi isn’t listening to their conversation right now, surely one of her minions is.
There are lines underneath his eyes, too, like his lower lids are sagging with exhaustion. Dean’s so tired… he could fall asleep standing in front of this mirror…
Unfortunately, nobody is listening to his prayer. Sam snaps at Dean at the same time the banner unfolds with a snap. Though the right side sags a bit, the message on the fabric is unmistakable. The rebels had painted a sword on fire on a large swath of grey cloth.
With a sigh, Dean throws up his hands. “Whatever.” He checks the time. “They’ll be switching out soon, anyway.”
“Don’t interrupt me, boy,” Bobby growls and Dean rolls his eyes. Sam shoves him with his shoulder and Dean retaliates.
Everyone is going to die. Naomi wanted people to see that to give them hope and tear it away. To crush people’s spirits.
The thing that annoys Sam, though, is that Dean was right—without him pushing the two of you to talk to each other and him, the most you ever do is smile at Sam and mumble a quick hello if you ever catch each other in the halls. Sam isn’t sure if you’re just that shy or avoiding him. Knowing his track record with girls, probably both.
Dean really didn’t mean to eavesdrop. He’s two steps up when he hears Castiel’s voice and realizes he’d gone inside and not come back out. Curious now, he follows the voices down a staircase and flattens himself against the wall near the doorway of what must be the kitchen, judging by the smell of food inside the room.
Sam shrugs. “I don’t know why Jo trusted him, but yeah. Dean says she’ll give it back in three days if he hasn’t found it yet, but he’s determined to find it before then. I guess he’s been too tired from working all night that he hasn’t been able to call you. He’s fine, though.”
is how Dean finds himself in the courtyard of the Umbrella Academy mansion, torn between cheering for Cas and Luther as they compete to see who can lift the largest weight.
Sam crosses his arms stubbornly and glares at Dean. “You’re a Victor, Dean. You could choose to stay.”
,” you swear, and Sam realizes that he finds that pretty hot. “I’m so sorry, Sam. This is all Gabe’s fault, I swear.”
Sam flips over the back of the couch, his feet landing on Dean’s stomach. “Yeah, but it’s cool to watch.”
Last point: we have been led several times in the show to believe that Sam and Dean are fighting when they actually aren’t (the first example that comes to mind is their staged fight when trying to kill Gabriel/The Trickster in Tall Tales). What if they aren’t angry with each other at all but merely putting on a show for Billie’s benefit? Unlikely, in my opinion, but possible.
“Hey, look,” Sam says, pleased. “They’re in full bloom. Animals haven’t gotten to them yet.” He’s right. The few strawberry bushes are laden down with berries. A little while away, the blueberry bush that Sam has tried to nurture for years finally seems to be yielding fruit.
“Wasn’t going to anyway, but thanks,” Five grunts. Maybe if all the blood flow goes to his head he’ll pass out. That’d be a fun way to pass the time.
ALSO, VERY IMPORTANT: THERE WILL BE NO NEW UPDATES UNTIL MONDAY, JANUARY 6, 2020. I AM GOING ON VACATION AND WILL NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO THE INTERNET DURING THE HOLIDAYS. Regardless, I hope everyone enjoys their holidays. I will see you all again in the new year!
compliment the kid more. God knows Dean would’ve liked a little more appreciation for taking care of Sammy when he was younger from John. “I killed Lucifer for hurting Sam,” he adds angelically. “He wasn’t very nice.”
taken care of the ghost. Then there was a girl who’d had one of her eyes scooped out, claiming to only remember seeing the color red before she’d passed out again from the pain. The color red, and a weird shed in the woods behind the high school with strange markings on the door.
“Thanks, Y/N.” Sam smiles big at you after you put Fluffy back in his cage and you immediately redden. “If he’d died when I was babysitting him, Cas would’ve killed me.”
He reaches into the tree’s hollow trunk and takes out three woven baskets. The insides are stained red and blue from juice. Dean pokes the bottom of the most stained and it’s soft to the touch. With a sigh, he tosses it aside. “Well, that’s done for.”
Okay, so for the past few episodes we’ve been seeing Dean lie a lot, whether he’s lying to Amara about hurting her or Sam and his friends about seeing dead bodies. My guess is he’s also lying to Billie about being on board with the plan of blowing Jack up to kill Chuck. I mean, we are led to assume that Cas told Dean about Jack’s deal with Billie NOT Cas’s deal with the Empty or Dean wouldn’t have let Cas leave. Why would Cas be texting Dean if he was on board with Billie? I think Dean lied to Billie (obviously) to make her think that he is on board with her. However, he’s lying to Sam about being on board with it so it seems like the Winchesters are fighting about whether or not to go through with the plan. I’m sure Billie knows or is watching and will be so distracted by the Winchesters feuding that she won’t notice what Cas is doing until (hopefully) it’s too late.
“I don’t care whose idea it was,” he grunts. “I just cornered you to make sure you’ll save some fruit for me.” He steps out of the shadows and looks a lot less menacing. With an open hand, he offers them coins. “Us Peacekeepers have missed our fruit boys.”
Another pair of Peacekeepers pass them. Dean nods to them and they nod back. It must be nearing three in the afternoon, when the enforcers rotate for the third time in a day.
The shed, which had appeared to be smaller than a regular motel room from the outside, turns out to have a humongous inside. There had been a trapdoor that led to a chute or something once they all stepped inside and Dean and Sam had gone down different sides.
“Can you hand me his water bottle?” you ask, your voice definitely a little sharper than it had been just seconds earlier. Sam scrambles for the weird upside-down dispenser thing he’d never really understood and places it in your hand. You tip a few drops of water into the rabbit’s mouth and rubs his throat. He stops choking, leaving the apartment so quiet Sam’s ears ring.
TW: Very, very brief mention of abuse, but if you read the last chapter okay then you should be okay this chapter too
Also, if anyone has any theories for the season, I'd love to hear them! Won't go into mine in full here, but if anyone would like to talk about it, I'd be happy to discuss in the comments.
“I hate you,” you say out loud, though it’s unclear if you’re talking to your cat or the trickster. As it is, the cat soothes its ruffled fur and squeaks at you. It has really big eyes.
In the supermarket’s parking lot, Jody and Bobby are talking while Jo and Ellen argue a few feet to the side. Sam sees them and nudges Dean with his shoulder, nodding in their direction with his chin.
A pair of patrolling Peacekeepers pass and Dean nods at them. The next house closest to the street the Winchesters walk on receives a soft package thrown at the front step. Finally Dean casually reaches up and inserts a package in the joint between two branches on a tree trunk. He knows that Road kids like to climb that tree.
“Wow! It really is a small town, I guess.” You get in your car. “I’ll see you later, Cas. It was nice talking to you!”
Some of the people on top of the buildings fall off, whether pushed by wind or shot, but many more disappear back into the buildings. The crowd is trampling Peacekeepers, fire is roaring, and the screaming sounds more like laughter. For a moment Dean believes that District 11 will be the answer. Maybe Naomi isn’t invincible after all.
The thought crosses Dean’s mind that Charlie’s relatively normal air masks a complete madwoman. It’s certainly an unorthodox approach in the Capitol. She could win the Games with that attitude.
“Well, we can do that without having a superpower,” Dean brags, all in good nature of course, and the competition is on.
true,” Klaus argues back, taking the margarita out of Five’s hands and drinking the rest of it in one gulp. “He’s feral. All teenage boys are feral.”
And there is the million-dollar question. “I don’t know.” And that’s the truth. Most of the guards didn’t take their helmets off, and besides, Dean was
The Peacekeepers get the person on the far right side of the building and they fall to the ground. The sound of bones snapping is lost amid the chaos, but Dean can see in the bottom of the screen that their body looks like a ragdoll. The rebelling citizens have started to throw flaming rocks at the Peacekeepers, who look like they’re going to buckle under the pressure.
Dean grips the fake section of metal and pulls quickly. He steps through the fence, trying not to get stuck on any metal parts. He’s gotten too big for the hole, however, and one piece snags his jacket’s right sleeve. That could be a problem if this section ever turns on.
Sam can’t help but feel a small bit of jealousy at how easily you talk and joke with Gabe but can’t even look at Sam.
Actually, I have a lot, but none of them are appropriate. At all. So I'm just going to go along with, that was a fucking shit awful cat vomit ending of a show and I'm manifesting it away. For now, this is my rewrite of it. The characters might not be in the same universe, but they're the same people and I'm giving the people what they want, dammit (which is a satisfying ending where everything isn't thrown away for shock factor and homophobia).
“Oh,” said Dean. “Oh, I’m so sorry, Cas.” He thought of his own father, and how he might react if… but no, Dean couldn’t think about that now.
He jumped a little when Cas reached over and squeezed his hand. While Dean had been staring at his brother, Cas had evidently been staring at him. His emotions were swirling all over the place and so, without giving it too much thought, Dean squeezed back and was grateful for the reassuring gesture.
The omelette slipped a little, but all in all it turned out okay. Cas looked up over his shoulder at Dean and beamed. “It worked!”
“It’s been sitting awhile, so it’s probably cold by now. I’m sorry.” Cas looked dreadful. His shoulders were slumped low, his eyes sagged, and his whole face was lined with exhaustion.
He mumbles his apologies and hurries inside, where he avoids Castiel for the rest of the day. And the day after. And the day after that. He waits until Castiel has left for work before venturing outside, and rushes back inside whenever he returns. And it’s strange— Castiel normally keeps a pretty regular schedule, leaving first thing in the morning in his suit and tie and ridiculous trench coat that Dean maybe finds a little endearing, and coming back at dusk. Not that Dean’s been paying particularly close attention or anything. But Castiel been popping back home unexpectedly during the day, at odd times. He’ll call out and start to come over, but Dean’s always quick to come up with some excuse that sends him hurrying indoors before there’s any chance at conversation. Dean’s got plenty of work to do inside, after all. That shag carpet in the living room isn’t going to disappear on its own.
He deposited it in the middle of the room again, and Sam retreated behind the couch. They stared, and it glared back up at them, seething. Then, it sneezed.
Castiel pulls back and stares, transfixed, at Dean’s face. It’s flushed, and his green eyes are wide and searching. Castiel’s eyes are drawn to the place he’s been seeking: Dean’s lips, parted slightly. Dean’s tongue darts out as he licks them nervously, and Castiel surges forward, pressing their lips together.
Eager for the excuse to leave the room, Cas retrieved his phone from the living room. When he returned to the kitchen, he handed the phone over to Dean wordlessly, who called Sam and put it on speaker.
“Fine,” Cas sighed with exaggeration. “You fill out your part, I’m going to make us some popcorn.” Cas slid the papers across the coffee table to Dean then disappeared into the kitchen.
Dean swore at Sam, and Sam swore back. As things grew increasingly heated between the brothers, a growing realization settled over Castiel. He cleared his throat, and both brothers fell silent.
Cas, for his part, was oblivious, and he dismissed her, only sparing her a polite shake of the head.
Sam chuckled. “You can have our honeymoon suite after tomorrow night if you want,” he offered, “but you’ll have to pay for the extra nights yourself.”
Dean stepped into the shower and turned the water as hot as he could stand it. He accidentally leaned against a button of some sort and massage jets lining the inside of the shower sprang to life, making him groan as the warm water worked its way into his muscles. A soft mist fell from the overhead jets, giving the whole thing the illusion of a tropical waterfall if he just closed his eyes. He thought briefly of the small, rusty shower at home that never got hot enough. He could get used to this.
Dean emits a noise that lands somewhere between a laugh and a sob and pulls Cas into a tight hug. He burrows his face in Cas’s hair and finds himself unwittingly murmuring over and over again, “I’ve got you, Cas. You’re okay. I’ve got you,” the reassurance more for himself than for Cas.
“Oh, you got the license,” Sam said with a laugh. “The clerk’s office is just around the corner and they’re open ‘till midnight 7 days a week. You guys took off, and I thought that was the last we’d seen of you for the night. But you came back not long after and marched us all into the chapel.”
Sam, ever the sensible one, did not come on this hunt. But the other one is with Dean. The strange one, who smells of ozone and otherness. Castiel, he is called. Or Cas, as Dean and Sam like to call him. He was unsettling at first, all those years ago. He would materialize into her seat unexpectedly, startling both Dean and herself, and filling her interior with a crackling, simmering energy that she had been barely able to contain. He has always been larger somehow than his shape would suggest, and that made her wary at first.
“Yeah,” Dean whispered. “Yeah, okay.” He inched closer, trailed both hands up Cas’s back where his hands found purchase in the folds of feathers. He scritched at them lightly, and Cas arched into him like a cat, letting out a soft sigh and dropping his head to Dean’s shoulder to nuzzle at his neck.
Cas set the cat down on the sidewalk as he fumbled with the keys to his Continental. He eyed the cat curiously, wondering if maybe she might wander off on her own. Surely she had a home nearby and knew where to go. But as soon as he got the door to his car open, the cat hopped in of its own accord and settled into the passenger seat.
“Hell yes!” Dean grabbed his boyfriend’s hand, interlaced their fingers, and squeezed. Hand in hand, they walked into the small chapel where they had first met.
He’s briefly met them both. The crotchety old lady to one side who scowls at him from behind her curtains every time he checks the mail, and the younger guy on the other side who’s about Dean’s age. That neighbour — Castiel — seems friendly enough. He had at least welcomed Dean to the neighbourhood with a warm, very firm handshake. They may have talked about the weather as well, though Dean’s foggy on the details, too taken with Castiel’s bright blue eyes and deep voice. And god, that hair.
“Yes,” Rowena answers briskly. “I need to pop into another dimension quickly and get another ingredient for a spell I’m working on that will help you with whatever apocalypse the three of you have started.”
A familiar form exits the supermarket and heads in the opposite direction of the shouting siblings. Cas tugs away from Dean, who doesn’t notice as he’s now competing with Jo as to who can be louder. “Y/N?”
Dean tears his eyes away from Jo and looks to the crowd, where a hush has fallen over the crowds. He’s not sure if it’s a good thing, but his adrenaline is rushing too hard, heart beating too fast and blood rushing in his ears, that he simply doesn’t care.
You nod and take your bags back from him. “Yeah, hopefully. I want to be closer to my work so I won’t have to drive as much every day. Plus, Crookshanks would probably like a larger house and what with his recent escape, Mr. Azazel’s patience with us is pretty thin. I’m getting the paperwork finalized next week, and the actual move is in two weeks.”
“We must have landed in a universe without heaven,” Sam exhales. “Remember Jared Padalecki? And Supernatural?”
The smile on Dean’s face wavers. “What does it matter?” He’s still bitter that their escort is an old drunk hermit, but he supposes that was set up by the Capitol as well. He and Jo are just not supposed to survive these Games.
“Charlie!” the rest of the prep team starts to yell, darting out of the room, and Dean shifts nervously on the table he’s sitting on. He doesn’t like being naked, especially when someone that’s a complete stranger is about to come examine him like he’s meat getting ready to be served.
The prep teams whisk the tributes down to the bottom level of the Remake Center, where their chariot pulled by four completely white horses awaits. The animals don’t skitter when the chatty prep team floods into the room with them. It’s impressive; Dean’s seen tame animals more skittish than these horses.
“I’m not sure,” Sam calls back, but his voice is funny. Like he’s much farther away than the living room.
The first sign that something is wrong is the eerie silence. Nobody’s out on the streets, though Dean sees that the package he’d left on a doorstep is gone. Not even Peacekeepers are on the streets. Trepidation makes his stomach curdle.
Well, that’s done for the day, Dean supposes. He turns around to see Jack with a blindfold over his eyes disappearing and reappearing, apparently playing tag with Five while both boys use their teleportation powers.
The opening music of the ceremonies begins and Jo jumps. The massive sliding doors Dean had been trying to ignore slide open, revealing crowd-lined streets of glittering insects.
“Don’t look at it,” Crowley hisses, clapping Dean on the shoulder so hard he stumbles and tears his eyes away from the camera. He whispers, “Haven’t you learned by now to let the enemy have her little victories so she doesn’t start working towards a larger one?”
“You’ll survive not seeing your boyfriend for two weeks, Dean,” their surrogate father responds. “Don’t argue with me, boy.”
“Well, it’s about time,” Ellen mutters to Bobby. “Look at our boy, all grown up. He’s got his first crush—”
“I swear, Sammy, I’m gonna get you two together soon,” Dean says loudly as the brothers and Cas walk through the park. The station is closed today because of a holiday. If any fires start, they’ll all get alerts on their phones.
“Just to pick strawberries?” Sam uses his best puppy eyes, and damn it if Dean isn’t a sucker. His brother just looks so sad and helpless.
The grizzled Peacekeeper doesn’t speak for so long that Dean’s sure they’re going to be whipped. He doesn’t know what expression is on his face, but Dean doubts it’s a good one. He’s really put his foot in it now, hasn’t he? His little brother is going to be
“Ah, civilization,” Rowena says, pleased. She straightens her already-straight dress and pats her hair. “Perfect.”
Sam can’t keep the snicker out of his voice, even though he knows this is a serious situation. “Yep.”
Also, give it up for Lansfics7 who got accepted into her dream college yesterday!!!! I'm so proud of her, she's all grown up. Like a full grown adult now.
The next time I see you guys will be after Supernatural has ended. I'm terrified. However as a little treat because we're all going to go insane, would you all like me to post another chapter next Monday instead of in two Mondays? Let me know in the comments. It's the only time I'm willing to do it because the concept of Supernatural ending is just... terrifying. But we all have to get through it!
Then Dean had seen a figure in red running down whatever hallway they’d landed in and he’d taken off. No matter how fast he runs, the figure in red always seems to be one step ahead of him.
So it had escalated a little bit. And he and Dean had started it, so they’re the ones in trouble, even though they’d had nothing to do with covering the dogs with shaving cream and letting them loose in the police station or buying all those loaves of bread and clogging the ladies’ toilets and sinks with them.
“He’s got powers too!” a man holding a throwing knife marvels. Undoubtedly he’s the one that threw it at Cas’s chest. “But he’s not our age.”
“Ah…” Allison starts, looking pained. “I suppose it’s no use to remind you that we don’t point guns at our siblings.”
Diego brightens at the idea and Sam leaps off of the couch, positioning himself between the murderous superpowered human and the half-archangel. “We still don’t know why the angel’s powers are working while there’s no heaven,” he says firmly. “We’re not risking any more injuries.”
Dean glances into the mirror and sees that his neck and ears are turning red. He does feel warm. Is he coming down with a fever? “Uh, yeah, I guess,” he says shortly. “To pay you back for you cooking me breakfast that one time.”
At the end of it, everyone but Jack, who opts for a glass of chocolate milk, is drinking alcohol. Apparently his powers are still intact in this universe, maybe because he’s as powerful or more so than an archangel. That’s useful to know.
The camera zooms in on a group of people on top of the Justice building. Something blasts off a section of the building near them and the people stagger. One falls off. In the corner of the screen Dean sees that some Peacekeepers now have guns and are shooting at the people on top of the building while their colleagues break bones with their discipline sticks if they’re not holding up a shield.
“Sammy!” Dean bellows, cursing internally again before starting to jog again. He’s not entirely sure he wants to reach where the figure in red is leading him, but there’s also the chance that his brother is in trouble.
It takes two hours for Fluffy’s first emergency to start. He’s choking and coughing a lot. “Goddamnit,” Sam mutters, pacing around his room while the demon bunny tries to kill himself. “Luci, pick up.” Sam calls three times and he doesn’t, so he finally has to look at the vet’s numbers that Cas gave him. When he calls the office, he’s told that the vet’s already gone home so, gathering up his pride, Sam dials the vet’s number to ask her to help save the life of a demon bunny trying to kill itself.
“Walk straight, go up the stairs, take your first left,” Luther directs. He claps Dean on the shoulder and sends him stumbling away, hissing as he rubs his shoulder. “Uh, sorry.”
Dean’s lip curls. There are no Peacekeepers here. No Peacekeepers to whip people caught stealing food they need to survive. No Peacekeepers to trade people for goods they so desperately need. No Peacekeepers to catch an innocent Victor while she’s showing her sons the hydroelectric dam—
“Yeah.” Sam smiles (you’d remembered what he sounded like!) but the renewed sounds of choking behind him wipe it off his face. “Sorry, Cas Novak gave me your number because he said you were his bunny’s vet but—”
Sam spins on his heel, taking in the area, and Dean looks up. A massive steel chandelier hangs from the ceiling of what must be a mansion, judging by the size of the foyer and the many rooms that look to branch off of it.
Then, because they’re all dumbasses, Sam, Dean, and Cas stepped into the shed, and Dean hasn’t seen his brother since.
Okay, so this chapter includes a LOT of references to literature. They are: the Greek legend about Pasiphae and the Minotaur, Romeo and Juliet, the Greek legend about Icarus and the sun, The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde, Macbeth, and Harry Potter. You'll probably be fine without knowing about them, but if you want to read them, then go crazy.
“With our hot neighbor—” is how far Dean gets before a burst of speed helps Sam take a flying leap at his brother. They fall into a bush and Cas takes the badge out of his pocket.
It’s Jack, stumbling out of the portal. How he’d known to go inside the shed, find the middle of the maze, and jump through the portal, Dean doesn’t know.
“Tell me about it,” you puff, struggling with unlocking your car and holding the grocery bags at the same time. When Cas takes the bags from you, you grin at him. “Thanks.”
“She still wants me to be a lawyer. I’m happy with my job. For now, at least. How you doing, Cas?” She switches her attention to her favorite out of all of them, though she’ll never admit it, and Sam and Dean shrug at each other.
“Are you okay?” Dean demands, racing into the living room. His brother is fine, but his eyes are wide as he looks at the TV. Slowly, Dean walks around the couch so he can see the screen as well.
You pick your bag up off the floor. “It’s really no problem. I like seeing Fluffy a few times each month. He’s sweet if you’re a girl, or Cas.”
“Hi, Dean,” Charlie continues. “I’m your stylist, Charlie.” She has a faint lisp in her voice. It’s so small it wouldn’t be noticeable if not for the way it impedes the Capitol’s accent.
“I read Harry Potter,” Cas says, swinging his and Dean’s entwined hands like a pendulum. “I think Dean is a Gryffindor. Sam is a Ravenclaw. I think I am a Hufflepuff. Maybe—”
“A woman of high standard will come to your room tomorrow night. If you do not behave according to my expectations there will be… consequences.”
“Could you tell anyone you know that has a dog about the clinic’s new training program, if it’s not too much to ask?” You smile. “I’ll be working there when I’m not needed but we need dogs to attend.”
“And if you die what do you think will happen to Ellen?” Dean whispers. He wants to sound like he’s arguing, but the truth is that he’s going to get back to Sam.
First a trail of bodies with different organs cut out starting in, what a coincidence, the same town Sam and Dean were hunting a ghost in. But the mutilated people hadn’t stopped showing up in the hospital, even though they’d
“And why did you want that to happen?” Sam asks while lifting the cat out of the shelf. He is very aware that you are standing right next to him and don’t even come up to his shoulders. Your smile when he hands your cat to you makes his stomach flip.
I need people to reassure me that you're still going to read this even after that godawful ending, because goddamn I am not sure if I will be able to rewatch the show like I used to.
“Why’d you lead us in a wild goose chase in a maze? Wait—you’re the reason for all the mutilations, aren’t you?”
Cas scribbles another number on the paper and hands it back to Sam. “That’s Luci’s number. And that is a good idea, Sam. I’ll have to ask Amara if that would be allowed.”
Jack preens at being called not stupid, which is kind of a low bar. Maybe Dean should compliment the kid more. No, scratch that, he should
IMPORTANT: At the end of this chapter is a very slight reference to forced prostitution because we thought the Capitol could not get any worse. Do not read if this will trigger you. However, it is just as graphic as when Eileen and Dean discussed it in the Roadhouse bathroom—as in, not at all. It will become more graphic in later chapters, but I will never describe the actual action; I do not write smut as I am underage. By graphic, I mean that Dean will think about the specific partners he's had while at the Capitol, but the most I will do with that is describe his reluctance, entering the room, and the outrageous clothing his partners wear. No character will describe the events in detail. If this offends or triggers you, please do not read further or read with caution as I tried to make it as implied as possible. I did take a bit of this d-plotline from Finnick's story in the Hunger Games where he was forced into sexual slavery by the Capitol, but this fic will not take it anywhere close to that level.
Dean shrugs. “Rowena more or less made it so we had no choice.” He glances into the foyer, where the white light of the portal doesn’t waver.
I HAVE SO MANY THEORIES ABOUT WHAT THE WINCHESTERS ARE DOING RIGHT NOW. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOST RECENT SPN EPISODES DO NOT READ THIS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
That's it; we're done with Part 1! Thank you all for sticking with me throughout this journey. I appreciate each and every one of my fans and loved receiving your comments, even if I forgot to reply to them. Most of all, thank you to Lansfics7, who has encouraged me throughout this whole journey and will continue to encourage me (hopefully) as I write the sequel. This story would not have been made without her support.
“Wow, Deano really wasn’t lying,” Gabe says, tossing the lollipop stick into the trash can. “You’ve got it really bad.”
“You’re to come back immediately,” the crisp voice on the other end commands. Naomi doesn’t sound especially pleased or peeved. It unnerves Dean any more. How can she not care that her districts are rebelling?
Jo enters the room wearing the same outfit, much to Dean’s relief. He doesn’t know what he would do if he was standing next to a naked-but-for-a-poncho Jo. The contrast would be horrific, even to the district viewers.
As of now, I plan to write around 23-24 chapters for the sequel, which will be called The Scars We Can't Hide. I am still in the process of writing it, but once I reach around chapter 16 I plan to start publishing again, with the same schedule (every Monday). I aim to be at that point by May.
The shed hadn’t been hard to find. It’d been even easier to find with the obvious bloody trail leading up to the door where, of course, Cas had identified the markings as Satanic.
“Look, I just think it’s a good series!” Sam exclaims. “And that’s nothing compared to the cowboy hats I found hidden underneath your bed, Dean. You can’t really talk.”
When it’s discovered that Sam and Dean really are as good as Diego from years of practice, they call Jack over to move the targets midair. This is where Diego smirks, as Sam and Dean do miss a few and he misses none, even when his knives flip over themselves, zip back and forth, and defy the laws of gravity as they fly through the air.
Dean rolls his eyes but walks to the door to slide his feet into his boots. Now he has to plan sneaking out of the district without being caught. Not that many of the Peacekeepers want to stop a Victor and a Victor’s kid, especially when they’ve gotten used to them sneaking out and coming back. It’s not like they’re flight risks.
“But for most of those years he was completely isolated and therefore not any more mature than a regular fifteen-year-old kid, only more murderous,” someone says singsong behind them. Dean jumps.
It takes Sam’s head a few moments to catch up. “Oh! Oh, I thought Dean told Gabe to tell you—he probably forgot—but, uh, me and Dean got in trouble at work for that whole prank thing so he’s been working the graveyard shift and I’ve been working the day shift—anyways, Jo hid his phone somewhere in the station as punishment for the whole bread thing because, well, she can’t do it to you so she’ll do it to your boyfriend, because she’d gotten her period and Gabe told her it was you that had taken all the tampons out of the dispenser thing—”
Dean glances at Jo. She looks a bit sick, but whether it be from the man’s garish outfit or comments he’s not sure.
Dean’s chest goes warm with pleasure. Sitting here with Sam he feels safe. Sam pulls a blanket over both of them, making sure to kick Dean as he does it, and Dean slouches even lower. Before he knows it, he’s practically lying down on the couch, facing the ceiling so he doesn’t have to look at the TV screen. His eyelids are so heavy.
“We have an apocalypse to prevent,” Sam explains, gesturing for Jack to follow him. Jack misunderstands the signal and takes Sam’s outstretched hand, startling him—but in a good way.
“Hey!” Allison yelps. “Luther, don’t you dare pick up my car! Dean, don’t encourage them!” The half-gorilla man sends her a sheepish look and shrugs at Cas.
“Yeah, but you’re not obsessed with it like Sam is. He’d probably want Y/N to wear that shirt while they’re having sex, he’s that into Harry Potter.”
A series of knocks sound at the door. When Sam opens up, you’re standing there in your scrubs and carrying a bag with your phone to your ear.
He and Rowena watch as Sam tries frantically to stop Five from cutting Jack’s arm, even as Jack holds his arm out and holds him in place.
. He was allowed undergarments that won’t crease under the fabric but will prevent him from being completely exposed. Unfortunately, that meant he wasn’t able to wear the amulet. Charlie isn’t as easily bendable as Dean’s prep team and so Bobby promised to hold onto the necklace and slipped it into his pocket. Dean still isn’t sure if he should be worried about the old Victor’s wording.
“It was all my idea,” Dean says hastily the moment Crowley sucks in his breath to say something. “I swear.”
Sam snatches the coins eagerly and looks up at Dean, pleading. Like Dean’s going to say no. Plus, having a few extra coins never hurt anybody. Though most of their supplies are shipped to their front doors and some people in the market will give them food without asking for payment, it’ll be nice to spread the wealth around and actually pay for goods.
His breath catches in his throat. Naomi saw him leaving the District. She saw his business deal with Crowley.
Cas’s warning about how helping everyone in a community actually helps nobody comes back to Dean. He brushes it off. Cas might be smart but he doesn’t know everything. Besides, there’s no other way for Dean to help.
Dean considers the route to the fence he usually takes. After a moment, he jogs to his bedroom and pulls a suitcase out from underneath his bed. He takes three wrapped packages out of it and stuffs them in his pocket.
LIVE FOOTAGE FROM DISTRICT 11, the bottom of the screen reads. It certainly looks like it. A crowd of people are in the Justice Square, as Dean knows is more commonplace in districts where electricity is spotty but viewing is still mandatory. The crowd looks like a roiling sea as people push each other and scream. Peacekeepers have surrounded the crowd in a circle, three lines deep, all with their shields up. Rocks fly into the shields, but the shields don’t completely absorb the impact. The lines are staggering.
“Cas is pretty talkative,” you shrug. “And we got to know each other more every time he brings Fluffy in. Let’s just say I didn’t think someone could talk about green eyes so much.”
Cas just smiles at him. “Bobby already said he doesn’t mind. There haven’t been many fires for a few weeks, so there’s no need to worry. Please, Sam? I have the address for Fluffy’s vet, the office number, and the vet’s personal number just in case.” He hands Sam a piece of paper with that information on it, as well as Dean and Cas’ numbers (as if Sam needed any reminders) and some other random numbers Cas apparently thought Sam might need for his four-hour babysitting gig. Most of them are different pizza places’ numbers.
Dean looks at Sam as the witch starts to chant, and he shrugs. He’s always had a soft spot for the witch, but Dean doesn’t know why. He takes small solace in the fact that Sam’s here, and if worst comes to worst he’ll be the one to end the witch once and for all. Somehow.
“Hmm…” Charlie paces around his body, her eyes raking up and down. Dean has to resist the urge to cover himself with his hand. “I have to ask… are those bruises or makeup?”
Cas had to admit, even with the awkward position, this was kind of nice. He was warm, and comfortable. He could probably get used to having a small, furry companion around.
Cas, though, did not smile, and his frown deepened.  “Dean, why are you in my living room?” he asked, and the voice that Dean loved twisted a little darker, more menacing.
She has known Dean a long time. Since before he drove her, back when he was small and rode around in the backseat, buckled in tight. Over the years, they have shared moments of bloodshed, grime, and countless horrors. But the things she cherishes most are the moments of love. The army man in the ashtray. The nights spent with her boys staring up at a starry sky.
“Oh. S’okay,” Dean mutters, scuffling his feet. He has to look down, away from the earnest intensity in those blue eyes.
“Yes, of course. I’ll be there.” But Castiel had already begun devising excuses in his head. A headache, maybe? As much as Castiel enjoyed spending time with Sam and his friends, horror movies had never really appealed to him much.
Castiel stumbles slightly, and pauses. He looks around and listens carefully, but there is no one. Everything is quiet, and so he continues walking, shaking off the feeling of unease that trickles through him. If he can just get to Dean. And Sam. Perhaps they can fill in some of the blanks. He walks faster, plagued by the relentless ache of Dean’s longing and frustrated with his own impotence at being shackled to the ground. What use is an angel without wings?
Dean stared at Cas in amazement, taking in the impossibly calm demeanor of the man. So far this morning, nothing had fazed him. He just sat there, serenely eating his eggs, like this was a perfectly ordinary occurrence for him to be answering questions about his sexuality over breakfast with the total stranger he accidentally married.
For the first time Dean doesn’t understand John’s decision not to mentor any tributes. Sam and Dean would have been able to visit the Capitol. They would have been able to eat this fancy food together, laugh at these weird people together, and marvel at the view together.
Sam cringes when Dean sighs, loudly, as they wait for their supervisor to call them into his office. What had started out as a little prank war had somehow evolved into a station-wide fight that somehow also included the police in the building over, dogs, shaving cream, and an entire bathroom filled with bread.
!” Five sputters. With a flash of blue light, he disappears and reappears in front of Klaus, hands on his hips.
“And there’s another apocalypse,” Vanya says slowly. “And you’re stopping it by coming to our universe.”
“I was thinking the exact same thing,” Dean murmurs back. He grips Sam’s shoulder and starts to run for the house. He’s not in the mood to be cornered by any anti-Capitolists, betters, or thugs today. Sam keeps up well, presumably from all the track. Scratch that. By the end of it Dean’s panting but Sam seems hardly out of breath.
Somehow she’s more beautiful than anyone else in the Capitol, except maybe Jo. They’re equal, really, because they’re
“Sam, is he okay?” Dean asks tersely, holding up his gun in the direction the knife had come from. He sees a pair of eyes glint and adjusts accordingly.
“You barely even look at people you don’t know,” Sam mutters to himself but he thinks you hear him; you stiffen a little bit.
Dean turns away from the milling people quickly. Jo doesn’t, though, and just waves at them with a ginormous but fake smile on her face. Thankfully none of the insects can tell that the districts aren’t as fond of the Games as them, that it’s not so much an honor to participate as it is a punishment. “Why are you waving at them?”
So last chapter got a bit of backlash... seems that you guys didn't really appreciate me killing off Jo. Um... my bad? Anyways, take this chapter and go crazy. Please review? They always brighten my day!
“No, I’m serious, you two are perfect for each other. She’s always carrying books when I see her, and once she was wearing a Harry Potter shirt!”
That’s not the interesting part of the costume, though. The headpiece Charlie had put on Dean’s head she assures him is completely safe, but he’s not so sure. Just before they enter the streets, Charlie intends to turn on the headpiece, which is actually a conductor for electricity. Sparks will fall from Dean’s head no matter what movement he makes. The same goes for the boots he’s wearing; with every movement a spark will erupt from the heels.
Dean puzzles over that for five seconds before remembering that adoption is a thing. The jump to another reality must have scrambled his brains again.
I hope everyone enjoyed their Thanksgiving breaks, if they had one. Remember, students, winter break is only a few weeks away. (Phew!)
“We should head back,” Dean says woodenly. Sure, he knew that the Peacekeepers knew about this place. But how does Naomi know—and why does she care? “Come on, Sam.”
Dean sighs and sits on the couch, rubbing his face wearily. He needs to shave. “All right, stop with the chick flick moments. How long was I sleeping?”
But God, Dean wishes that he could step into those woods and never come back. He could take Sam and they could live off the land, far away from Naomi and the Capitol.
“Cas,” Dean breathes and pushes him gently down onto the bed. He starts undoing buttons until they’re both bared to one another from the waist up. He kisses down Cas’s chest and towards his belly and Cas’s body thrums underneath him. Dean hovers over him, flooding his senses, and Cas can’t keep still, can’t get enough. He cranes his neck, desperate to kiss every part of Dean he can reach.
Something inside of him snaps, and just like that, Dean is struck with the sudden, painful realization of several things in quick succession.
Dean does a double-take and stares slack-jawed. There, sitting on the floor just inside  the front window, is Cas and a cat. A whole bunch of cats, actually. ANIMAL RESCUE, the sign on the door reads, as Dean pushes it open. A bell dings loudly and Cas looks up in surprise. A redhead also looks up from where she’s filing papers at the front desk, but anything she might have been about to say is lost under Cas’s voice of surprise.
“I’m not hungry.” Dean mumbled. Unfortunately, his stomach chose that precise moment to grumble loudly.
Dean can’t argue with that. It’s fun to watch until you remember it’s real-life people dying on the screen.
You laugh, but Cas was serious. “Again, it would be great if you could, Cas, but no pressure. I’m hoping the people here have some cute dogs. I
“It’s definitely going to be Cas,” Sam mutters. The Winchester brothers stand side-by-side in identical poses as they assess the experiments.
Dean touches his tender nose gingerly. “There, now you look like a human being!” the one with purple lipstick says brightly. He slaps Dean’s hand away. “Let’s call Charlie!”
Vanya nods and then nudges Diego with her elbow. Her brother groans and rolls his eyes but leans forward and holds a hand out to Cas. “Sorry for stabbing you, man. No hard feelings?”
Thank you all for sticking with me so far. This is the last non-Games chapter, so buckle in for some violence!
“I had Dolores!” Five snarls, pulling a handgun out of his pocket and pointing it at his brother. Klaus seems unbothered. He pulls two bottles of whiskey from the shelf of alcohol and tosses the other behind his back. Five disappears and reappears, catching the bottle with a huff and stowing the gun. Apparently all is forgiven.
Cas grips Dean’s hand (shut up, Sam) and Sam grabs the hem of Dean’s jacket as Dean uses his free hand to grip the shoulder of Sam’s jacket. No more taking any chances of going down different chutes. In a line, they follow Rowena into the blinding light…
“Tributes!” a man with long fake eyelashes with stones glued onto the end beams at them. “Dean Winchester, it’s an honor. And Joanna Harvelle, your father is a legend. His Games were, in fact, my favorite, even if they were a little before my time.” He smiles, revealing white teeth. One of them has a smudge of his purple lipstick on them.
“We’re not going to focus on the work,” Charlie continues. “We’re going to focus on the water. And what it does.”
Shiny black boots come up to Dean’s knees and a headpiece complete the outfit. He looks like a shadow, or a black deer with odd antlers, and
“Fifteen,” Five says promptly, then he scowls. “Bitch. I’m still not giving you them. Get your own.”
“Well, Y/N says that her clinic is opening a training center for dogs and that she’ll be working in both the clinic and center. Since you want to see her so badly, you could get a dog and have her be the vet and trainer.”
Sam wakes up fifteen minutes before his alarm is supposed to go off. Two people are running around inside his apartment.
Before, Castiel always wondered what it would be like to be with Dean, and he allowed himself the private agony of contemplating
Only a minute into the film, and all that had been shown so far was a car driving along a winding, deserted road, but Castiel
“Your couch is basically a torture device,” Cas says. “It’s too short for me to stretch out on fully, and the springs dig into my back. I’m just not as young as I used to be, and I can’t sleep there for weeks on end. My back won’t survive it. It could be
Much to Dean's dismay and annoyance, Sam found a shirt a thrift store during the drive down to Knoxville that read, "too lazy for a costume."
“Fucking witches, man.” Dean shrugged helplessly. “I didn’t know what else to do or where to put him where I wouldn’t, you know, lose him or step on him or—"
Dean lowers his gun, his eyes darting around the room. His hair is sleep-mussed and flat on one side, and his stubble has grown in darker overnight. His eyes are blurry as they scan the room, but they brighten just a little when they land on Castiel.
By the end of the first week, though, boredom begins to settle in. The shock of being at the epicenter of a small explosion has passed, and so too has the sharp pain in their bandaged hands. It dulls to a steady ache that Castiel can forget with enough distraction and medication. The painkillers are easy to come by; distractions, not so much.
Charlie, it's still so good to see her face again. Her laughter fills the room, and with it, Castiel can almost see Dean's spirit growing lighter again.
When they were kids, they slept in the same room all the time. In the summer, they would put up a tent in the backyard and share an air mattress, but Dean realizes belatedly that they’re a good deal larger now than they were when they were kids, and sharing a bed isn’t quite as comfortable as it once was. Nor is Dean’s bed as big as he’d imagined.
Cas shot it a scathing look and it quieted down. “No,” Cas said, “He’ll listen to pretty much anything but Celine Dion.”
They settled at a table to wait and Dean’s heart swelled as he took everything in. All of the people he loved most were here together in one room. Even his dad showed up. He knew Bobby had something to do with that, but he was grateful all the same.
The doctor gives them strict orders not to use their hands for anything, and Castiel worries about what this will mean for Dean. They’re going to need help with the most basic of daily tasks, but Dean’s brother, Sam, is away at camp for the summer and John Winchester can hardly be counted upon as a caretaker.
"Good," Dean murmured. His eyelids grew heavy and he felt sleep beginning to pull him under. "Hey Cas?"
