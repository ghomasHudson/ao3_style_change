Tony lifted his spoon and paused, turning his head to look at Rhodey. "You know me so well. How? How did you know?"
It was close, but hearing those words--that he was going to be fine--almost set him off into tears again, but Tony composed himself. Though he'd probably be crying in Steve's arms later, if he was being completely honest.
News of Tony's visit to the doctor spread fast throughout the media outlets, each speculation more wrong than the next. Paparazzi lined the streets in front of the tower, hoping to catch even the smallest glimpse of the genius, flashing cameras at almost anyone who entered or exited, just in case.
Nose deep in a back issue of Highlights magazine, he ferociously ignored everyone around him. Everyone meaning the eight other people in the waiting room, all of which seemed to recognize them both. It didn't help that issues of US Weekly and People magazine were scattered on the table, his gaunt face across their covers.
He didn't turn the lights on as he entered the bedroom like he usually would. Didn't instruct JARVIS to raise the blinds. Instead, he placed the tray on the table in the corner, the sandwich, cookies, and fruit salad able to withstand a little longer without being eaten, and gingerly crawled on the bed next to Tony. After he settled himself, facing Tony and also on his side, he lightly tapped the bridge of Tony's nose. It was something they had done for years, how they woke each other up.
"Yeah, rules like 'don't choose my senior year electives without consulting me and enrolling me in an art class, oh and also what the hell, don't throw out all my booze', right?" Tony muttered darkly to himself once the voicelog finished playing.
They were in New Hampshire now, making good time after finding a pair of usable bikes.  If they had to go into the woods, the bikes would have to be ditched, but for now riding down streets and sidewalks served their purpose, and Steve appreciated the change of pace.  On this particular evening, they'd found refuge in a two-story home that someone had gone through the effort of fortifying, though whoever it was seemed to be long gone.  Biters roamed the street, but there weren't too many, and in any case—well, Steve knew how to handle them now.
Cap glanced back at Rhodey and Pepper, evidently seeking their approval.  Pepper gave a half-hearted nod while Rhodey actually almost looked amused.  "So Cap's a
Ma must have seen something change in his face, because she smiled again.  "So will you do that for me, Stevie?" she pressed.
, was that painful to think about.  Maybe—maybe he was still alive.  Maybe he’d just run off somewhere to tend to his wounds.  Either way, though… forget just retrieving the shield, he decided.  Tony needed to avenge the hell out of him.
"You saved my life," Jessica said.  "Mine and Luke's and the baby's.  I owe you everything."  She looked down at the gun in her hands.  "And I'll do this for you."
are going to be with me the whole time.  Mr. Rhodes and Ms. Potts will take point, and we'll follow."
The first few entries from right after the last time he'd visited were standard Steve fare - the goings-on of the delivery job he was still doing, musings over the war brewing in Europe (Tony never responded to those parts, even if he was fascinated - who knew if him giving Steve future knowledge about the Second World War would have some kind of butterfly effect), and whatever altercations he had with Dougie for the day.  Nothing about any girls, unfortunately, though Tony supposed he wasn't surprised. This was Steve he was dealing with, after all.
"And if we find this guy, or at least what happened to him, you'll return my blueprints?" Tony pressed.
Tony laughs, taking the ring out.  “Yeah.  I don’t know.  I think maybe she wanted me to remember that she’s just as rich and smart as me.  This is her way of putting me in my place.”  He offers the ring to Steve, then holds out his hand.  “Put it on.”
happy,” he says at last.  “I’m going to be happy.  I’m engaged and soon I’ll marry Sunset and—and my father will be happy.  Okay?”
By the time Tony got back home, the sun was down, and it was all he could do to muster up the energy to stop by the shared kitchen to prepare some sort of meal from the meager assortment of food in his section of the cabinets before slogging back to his room.  Once he finally settled down with his sad bowl of soup and some bread, he pulled Steve's journal toward him, flipping to the first entry written after their last switch.
And yet Tony had an inkling that while all of the above was possibly true, there had to be more.  Even after all these months of sharing Steve's body, of getting into his head, Steve still found ways to surprise him.
"And now, today, it seems like we've finally switched.  It looks like so much has happened to you, Tony. I wish I could have been here for you for some of it, and I'm sorry I wasn't."
Tony didn't have a very good rebuttal to that.  "And where are the others?" he asked, letting the previous topic drop for now.  "Jarvis and Rhodey?"
Tony shrugged.  He'd already tried playing around with it, both with and without gloves, and despite the pages of classified documents about its supposed dangers, nothing had happened.  If it did have any effect, it wasn't one that was choosing to show itself to him.
"DESIGNS," read one row, but there were no designs to be seen.  Another was labeled "VOICELOGS," but again, there were no voicelogs anywhere (not that he knew what a voicelog was, anyway).  Yet another was called "HARD_DATA". Frowning, Steve picked up the box and turned it around, wondering if there were any knobs he could use to interact with the screen like he would for a television.  The search proved fruitless, though, and in frustration Steve prodded at the keys again, trying to get something to happen.
The figure stopped short and turned toward him.  She was holding a gun, but after a second of stunned disbelief, she lowered her arms and ran in his direction.  "Oh, my God," she said.  "I thought I'd heard—but I didn't actually think—you're
, he’s strong.  In moments, he’s standing on solid ground again—that is, if the floor of a ship’s deck counts as solid ground, looking up at Steve.  He’s tall, too, he can’t help but notice.  Tall, blond, and handsome.
Unfortunately for Tony, Steve did no such thing, leaping at him again and forcing him to jump off to the side.  “Steve!” he repeated, but it didn’t seem to be making any difference.
"Just hold on," Steve said as soothingly as he could.  "Once the biters lose interest we can go back to the river and wash ourselves.  Okay?"
"I'm not sick," Tony said.  He could feel a yawn coming and determinedly kept his mouth shut to keep it from coming out.
Tony emerges out of the water gasping, and for a wild, terrifying moment, he has no idea where he is or how he got here.  Panting hard and treading water as best as he can with an injured arm, he looks around, taking in the scene around him.  He’s surrounded on all sides by screaming, frightened people; meanwhile, not so far away, the ship is still above water, but probably not for long.  The noise is distracting, but if he concentrates hard enough, he can remember things, things like the steadiness of Steve’s hands as he held the table still, letting Tony make the modifications to it—things like the way Steve had captured his gaze and told him that they were going to be alright, right before they’d gotten off and the ship had broken into two—
Despite Steve’s earlier—and continuing, he suspects—embarrassment, he shakes his head, looking at Tony.  “Told you I was going to have dinner with you tonight, didn’t I?  I’m not going to turn away just because your father might get mad.”
fine,” Steve insists, but his words don’t have nearly the same amount of bite as they did when they were arguing weeks ago.  “It’s just—God.”  Anxiously, Steve runs his free hand through his hair, glancing away.  Tony thinks he can see Steve’s eyes getting wet; Extremis tells him Steve’s pulse is rising.  “It took thirty-seven minutes for the medics to jump-start your heart again.  And in those thirty-seven minutes, I thought—what if you actually died, and the last thing I did was snipe at you over something stupid?  How could I live with myself, when you’re the most important person in my life?”
"Don't even joke about that," Steve managed.  The very thought was horrifying.  "I was scared, Tony.  And
Her eyes darkened immediately, and Steve regretted asking.  But it was too late now, so Steve had to guiltily watch her sigh and turn her gaze away.  "He turned in as soon as we stepped inside," she said. "I should make sure he made it to bed alright.  Good night, sweetheart."
worse.  Steve was grateful for everything he had, really, and one bully wasn't going to change things all that much.
“Shh,” Steve says, and he places a cold finger against Tony’s lips, quieting him.  His hand is trembling.  “When you g-get to land, y-you’re gonna design an airplane, a-and you’re gonna b-build it, and then you’re g-gonna take off in it.  A-and you’re gonna fly, Tony.  Y-you’re g-gonna go h-high and f-fast and you’re g-g-gonna be unstoppable.  P-promise me.  Promise me you’re gonna f-fly away.”
He doesn’t understand how on earth a damned piece of legislation was worth more to him than Steve’s life.
Well, he’s not running away.  This is a good sign.  So Tony steps forward, heart pounding in his chest as he closes the distance between them—and still, Steve makes no move.  “I changed my mind,” he tells him.
But as he stands here now, watching as Tony’s boat is laboriously lowered inch by inch into the water, he thinks he understands.  Because now, regardless of what happens to
Tony smirks.  “You should see the mansion.”  He finds a tuxedo, then turns around, offering it to Steve.  “Here, try this on.”
existed was because of his own selfish desires.  Sure, it had worked out in the end, when he'd found the trident.  And sure, entertaining a bunch of people during darker times had been a positive side effect.  But he'd only ever been in it for himself, and though he was trying now to make up for it all—coming up with discoveries in the Rad Lab, getting shot at by Japanese fighter planes because he was on a mission for the U.S. government—it didn't change the past.  For God's sake, Virgil was dead because of him.
The implication of his words hung in the air, and Tony didn't like it.  "You don't get to use him against me," he whispered. "You weren't there, you don't know what happened - "
Tony still felt doubtful, but he couldn't find anything to actually refute.  He still felt like he was missing something, but he wasn't sure what.
.  “I think you’re interesting,” he says.  “And you’re hurting, and I want to help you.  And I think there’s a lot to you that no one knows about, and that’s a shame.”  …Also, he’s really ridiculously good-looking.  But it’s probably best not to voice that thought out loud.
made it sound, though," Tony said, shaking his head.  "I managed to avoid poison ivy smoke inhalation and bullets in most of those."
It had taken Tony some time to realize it, but it had come to him eventually—the terrible truth Steve had touched on when they sat together on that plane and Tony had thought that their future was infinite.  Steve had known.  He had known, even then, years before it happened, what he would do and what it would lead to.
Rogers stared down into the pit for a moment, then looked back at him and shrugged.  It kind of seemed like he was saying
But in the end, apparently he hadn't needed to spend so much brain power fretting over all that, because all his answers were right here in this journal.  He knew exactly what had happened to his Steve Rogers, the plucky kid from Brooklyn who fought bullies so others didn't have to.
"You can do a lot of things right now," Cap said.  He leaned closer to get a better look at the bandage, then carefully repositioned Tony's arm and took off the red gloves he always wore.  His hands were very pale, Tony found himself noticing.  Pale and unmarked.  "Doesn't mean that you should."
They kissed again, and for a little while, Steve could pretend everything was as it'd once been, and that the world would be okay.
At last, the morose expression disappeared from Steve’s face, only to be replaced by one of annoyance.  Well, Tony would take what he could get.  “Thought so,” he said as Steve turned around.  He clambered onto him, clutching his fur.  “See?  Progress is nice, isn’t it?”
“What kind of a question is that?  Of course I want to see.”  Tony stands up, still stark naked, and approaches him, leaning over his shoulder.  Steve tries not to get too distracted.  “Hmm,” he says.  “Not bad.”  Steve turns toward him, pouting, and Tony laughs, shaking his head.  “I’m teasing you.  This is wonderful.  This… really looks like me.  Not just physically, but…”  He gestures with one hand.  “I don’t know.  You know what I mean.  Maybe.”
One month into their relationship, as they lie tangled in bed together, Tony, on impulse, wipes the concealer off and shows her his wrist.  “I think this is talking about you,” he confesses to her, and it won’t be until years later that he realizes how naïve of him it was to do such a thing.
Steve opened his eyes with a gasp, seeing nothing but darkness no matter how much his gaze darted.  For a long moment he kept himself motionless, wondering if he was still lost in the depths of the ocean or not.  But then breaths came to him, one by one by one, and he remembered that it had been impossible to breathe in the water.
a later for me.”  He sighed then, turning to glance back at Steve.  “I guess… I just wanted you to know.  Why you’re like this.  Why I was desperate.  And I’m sorry.  I never wanted this to happen to you.”  Hero of
A bowl of something was pushed into his face; Tony managed to sit up on one elbow and take it, peering into it doubtfully.  “Chicken and rice,” Rogers said.  “And I’m heating water for instant coffee.”
Cap couldn't answer, because he was abruptly interrupted by the sound of a gun going off, his shield flashing in the light to deflect the bullet.
"Obviously," Steve said as he shoveled bacon and eggs into his mouth.  The bacon was salty and the eggs were fluffy and all of it was wonderful.  This was the best dream ever. "Who knows when I'm gonna eat this well again?"
When they were both good and covered, they straightened, Steve's breath catching when he saw the herd had rounded the corner, heading right toward them.
Steve went quiet, considering his options.  Before he could figure out what to do, though, Tony spoke up, voice low enough so that only he could hear.  "You know where the exit is?" he asked.
Blindly, he fired into the smoke once, twice, three times—but the recoil from the gauntlet was fierce, and he cried out in pain each time it went off.  Still, he struck
Steve looked around, half-afraid he was about to do something forbidden, then pressed down on one of the keys.
"Good, because I don't plan on needing to take any from you," Steve said, following after him.  "I didn't realize you didn't officially serve, though.  You were on the front lines."
"Ah," Cap said.  He put the piece in his pouch, then rubbed his temple with his newly-freed hand.  "I… I don't know.   I feel like it—it makes sense to me, in a way.  But I can't describe it."
They nod and murmur their assent, then take off one by one.  Eventually, it’s just Tony and Steve left, but just before Tony launches into the air, he waves at Steve.  “Need a lift?”
"No," Tony admitted.  He reached up with a shaking hand, the one with the bite, and gripped at Steve's shoulder as tightly as he could, like his life depended on it.  Maybe in some small way, it did.  "I'm afraid," he whispered.
To his surprise, Rogers nodded, and so Tony went about attaching both of their packs and the shield to Rogers’ back.  It was awkward, but with some clever use of twine, they were able to manage.  Jesus, Rogers was
The words felt like they were from a lifetime ago.  In a way, they were.  A divide had been created when he had left Steve, and still another when Steve had drove that booby-trapped plane into the Atlantic and Tony had done nothing to stop it.
Without Tony having to prompt him, Cap pressed down on all the right latches, the armor opening up enough for Tony to be able to fit in.  The sound of it closing around him was comforting, as it always was.  Standing on his own was difficult without support.  But standing inside the armor—it didn't matter how weak he currently felt.  The armor would keep him upright.
Tony paused for a moment, remembering the terror he’d felt at the beginning.  It’d been a long time ago, but some things never faded.  “Ever since then, every adventure I’ve been on, every issue of
Stark stepped forward.  "That's because this man is actually Captain America," he said with an easy smile, clapping Steve on the shoulder.  Steve frowned, feeling oddly put on display, but it was clear these people had heard of him, and if it stopped them from killing each other, then he wasn't going to question it.
He opens the box, and Steve leans forward to peer at it.  It looks like a silver band with a massive sapphire set onto it.  Really, really massive.  Who makes rings like that?  He flounders for a moment, trying to find something nice to say about it.  “It’s… um… very big.”
hit him on the head after all, and he just couldn't recall?  In any case, he didn't plan on worrying Ma further, no matter what - he'd get to the bottom of this himself.
.  Not only that, but Tony can’t for the life of him even understand why Steve is so against this in the first place.  Steve likes responsibility and training young heroes.  They should have been united on this.
Well, breakfast wasn't ready yet, right?  Maybe Steve could poke around a little. He got out of his chair and went straight for one of the appliances in one corner of the kitchen, away from Jarvis so that he didn't disturb him.  It was a large rectangular box with what looked like a partially see-through window on the front left side and a lot of printed-on rectangles arranged in an orderly fashion on the front right side.  Most of the rectangles contained numbers, but some had text like "DEFROST" and "ROAST".
Except for the part where the armor apparently knows Tony better than Tony knows himself, because mid-fight, it abruptly pulls away to pick Steve up by his head, crushing him.  Repulsor beams are useless.  Brute force will be easily countered.  Tony has a split second to decide—
There was no answer, but Steve understood why—they were close enough to the door that the woman would be able to hear their words now.  They instead went quiet, going with her into the hospital.  Steve caught a flash of red hair before the door was shut behind them and the corridor plunged into darkness.  "Follow me," the woman said.  Steve had to wait a moment for his eyes to adjust, but then he took hold of Tony's wrist and followed the woman down the hall, making sure Tony stayed close by.  She led them up a flight of stairs, then down the hallway again before she stopped in front of a door and opened it, motioning them inside.
It was kind of cute, in a way, that Steve was trying to keep confidential information from Tony in an attempt to not betray his country, even though Tony was from decades into the future and not in a position to do anything meaningful with whatever Steve was hiding.  But if Steve thought Tony could just read all this and take it in stride, he was deeply mistaken. There was more, and Tony was going to get to the bottom of it.
"I've ruined a lot of people," Tony replied, managing to keep his voice relatively steady.  He thought about his first night on the mission, lighting Virgil's candle.  "And I can assure you, it all mattered to me."
He was interrupted again when Steve leapt at him; automatically, he brought the shield up to protect himself—and instead of hearing the expected sound of claws scratching on metal, he heard—nothing.  After a moment, he dared to lower the shield, peeking over it.
“I don’t think this registration thing is a good idea,” Steve tells him one evening as he sketches poppies in the fading sunlight, and Tony should have known then that this was too good to last.
Rogers’ eyes widened, and he went over to Tony, placing a hand against his shoulder.  “Tony?” he asked.  “Are you alright?”
Tony snorted, picking up the coffee and taking a deep swig.  “You’re Captain America.  You like everything.”
As Tony had thought earlier, there were indeed pterodactyls, but they were swooping over the plains below, utterly uninterested in whatever was happening on the mountain.  Come to think of it, Tony was pretty sure he hadn’t seen a single living soul up here, save for Steve and himself—if he turned around, he could make out some dinosaurs in the distance, and he knew for a fact that there were other sabretooths hanging around
"And you think the reports written by the archeologist digging in Yinxu confirm that something of interest is there for sure," Pepper added.
Steve blinked and went silent for a moment, like he couldn’t quite believe what he’d heard.  “What do you mean, it’s fine?” he asked at last.
Tony aimed another repulsor blast at Steve, firing at his feet rather than his face—Tony wasn’t looking to hurt him, only to distract.  Steve grunted, clearly irritated, and turned toward him again.  He was going to attempt to stampede him soon, Tony knew.  Which was good.  It was what he wanted.  But damn it, he already knew it was going to hurt like hell.
Rogers hummed, leaning forward to investigate it.  “Yeah,” he said after a moment.  “It’s dead.”  He managed a shaky laugh, running his free hand through his hair.  “Well, now we know what to do next time.  Just get it to open its mouth wide somehow and shove a beam of light down its throat.  Easy as pie.”
True to his word, he kept a fair distance behind Steve as he prowled, sniffing the air and doing other cat things that Tony couldn’t comprehend.  It was, to his surprise, all very boring.  He had no idea how to hunt—only to avoid being hunted.  And given that Steve couldn’t speak, he couldn’t tell what the hell it was he was actually looking for.
always pass, and finally he was let out of his last class, free to do whatever he wanted for the rest of the day.
Bucky was already maneuvering to the cockpit, too fearless for his own good.  "Wait," Tony called. "Don't touch anything; I might be able to turn this around!"  Maybe he still had a chance to save Steve. He was good with these kinds of things. It would be okay -
God.  When had Steve even had a chance to do this?  Had he done the whole thing yesterday? Or had he been working on it for a while, hiding it somewhere Tony wouldn't find until he was finished?  Either way, it was just so - so
Once said realization hits, his brain seems to stop working, and he struggles with himself for a moment, trying to figure out what he should do.  His instinct is to call his name in return, directing him to the room he’s locked up in, but then what?  It’s not like Tony’s going to have a key for his handcuffs.  And it’s dangerous down here.  If—if Tony stays for too long, he’s not going to make it back up, and he’ll have died for nothing…
The walk to school was as arduous as it always was, and Steve let his mind wander as he navigated dilapidated sidewalks and sleepy pedestrians.  Though he knew it probably wasn't healthy to dwell on it, his brain kept on going back to the dream he had last night. It had been so vivid, and if Steve thought hard enough, he could almost taste all the food he'd eaten.  Not that the food had been the most important thing about the dream, but it had certainly been one of the highlights.
, and he rocked his chair again, enough that Maya cringed away.  "Don't you say that," he snapped, his voice raised.  "Every life has value."
And so they walked.  As they headed straight into the herd, the moaning became almost unbearably loud, and the stench even more so.  Steve could see Tony holding his arm over his nose and mouth, trying not to gag, but when Tony caught him looking, his eyes flashed, and he motioned for Steve to keep his gaze forward, which Steve reluctantly did.  After a few minutes, everything became the same—wave after wave of blank-eyed, ashen faces, of torn clothes and bloodied teeth.  Every now and then, one bumped into him, but Tony's logic had proven true, and apparently they considered him to be one of them, stumbling off uncaringly after contact.
“Okay,” Tony said, starting a fire with his lighter and bringing out his knife.  Though he’d never hunted before, he at least knew how to gut and prepare a wild animal—he still had vivid memories of some of the tour guides he’d had during his days of adventuring, slapping down some massive dead animal in front of him and telling him what to do with it.  Then again, how picky was Steve going to be?  “So what are you expecting?  Deer bacon?  Or do you not mind if I’m messy and give you a slab covered with deer fur?”
will defer to all of us.  It wasn't my choice to have you come, and the fact that you're here to report to Fury doesn't exactly fill me with glee.  But if you see any Nazis, then yes, Cap, you can punch them."
And then a circular shield flew across the screen, followed by a man with a star emblazoned on his chest.
"Jarvis faked a heart attack so that they'd try and give him medical attention," Pepper said breathlessly.  "We took our chance and overpowered the guards.  Trying to take over the whole carrier now so we can get out of here.  I was going to take on the guys up here but—"  She glanced over Tony's shoulder to see the men he'd taken down earlier.  "That may not be needed anymore.  But there's still other things to take care of."  She paused then, glancing off to the side before looking back at him.  "Tony.  There's this man who's been tracking us.  He's here.  He locked himself up somewhere and he's armed and he definitely has that last fragment.  You have to find him."
Steve tries to subtly pry his drawing pad from Tony’s hands, but it’s a no-go.  Sighing, he leans forward to see what Tony is looking at.  “Her?  Her name is Peggy.  Met her while I was in France.”
Tony felt a numbness settle into him, starting with his hands and then spreading through the rest of his body.
Tony tried a smile, even if her appearance was worrisome.  Had she been this bad yesterday? "Only the best for you," he said, because he knew that was what Steve would have said.  Not that this was really the best by any means - it was literally just orange juice and toast, but in an attempt to channel the much more artistically-inclined person whose body he was currently occupying, he'd added a dried flower to the side of the plate - for presentation, or whatever.  Steve would be proud, maybe.
“I know,” Steve replies quietly.  “I know.”  Tony can feel him reaching up, running his hand through his hair, though he has his doubts as to how comfortable it is.  Surely his head is just a mass of icicles by now, but if Steve wants to give him affection, he’s hardly going to turn it away.  “B-but it’s gonna be okay, Tony.  W-we just have to hold on a l-little bit longer.”
He’s sleeping when his Avengers card, which he keeps mostly out of habit, goes off, and when he turns it on, Carol’s voice, sounding calm but restrained, becomes audible.  “Tony?” she asks.  “Is that you?”
His only comfort was that a lot of them seemed like they wouldn't be relevant in the near future, at least.  As it turned out, Steve had woken up in a different room and a different bed, but Tony's laptop had been sitting on the nearby desk, and Steve hadn't hesitated to immediately reach over and open it up to listen to the latest messages.  Based on context, he'd figured out that the school year had ended, and Tony was now in his home. He wasn't sure how often he'd see his classmates, including Ty, but at the very least it probably wasn't going to be on a daily basis.
“Stop it,” Tony says, scooting a little away from him.  Are all third-class people like this?  So—so nosy and persistent and definitely not striking a chord somewhere inside him?  “I’m going to let go.  And you’re not going to stop me.”
Whatever the case, it bore looking into.  He went over to her door and knocked on it softly.  "Ma?" he called.
He was, of course, no stranger to waking with assorted ailments.  That was just who he was and what he had to deal with. But the combination of issues he was waking up with today?  That was new and unexpected and thoroughly unpleasant.
Tony groaned and turned his head toward the sound.  It sounded like Pepper and… Cap?  They were talking for some reason, though apparently his waking up interrupted them because they suddenly went quiet.
"The liquor store.  Gotta stock up, right?  And hopefully you won't destroy all your booze like you did at the end of last school year."
Tony turned back, then looked up, and for the first time he realized that there was something up there.  It looked like—it looked like another igloo-thing, maybe.  Like the ones he’d seen in the underground city, but bigger.  A giant igloo at the top of the mountain.  Was this it?  Was this where they were supposed to have wound up all along?
An hour or two later, they finally reached the edge of the city, and Tony sighed in relief as he laid eyes on the long tunnel from what seemed like ages ago, even though really, it had been what, two days?  Rogers headed down the hall at remarkable speed—it seemed like he had extraordinary night vision; Tony would have to ask about it later.  Then they were back at the entrance, and Tony found himself promptly cursing.
When she’s gone, he sighs, picking the napkin off his face and dropping it onto the table.  Then he pours himself another cup of coffee and downs it, because why the hell not.  He’s going to need it all if he expects to make it through the day.
Steve manages a breathless laugh, slipping his arms around Tony and squeezing gently.  They’ve both made a proper mess of themselves by now, but hell, he hardly cares.  He can only hope they didn’t get anything onto the leather seats.  “Alright,” he says, tilting his head forward to kiss the other man.  “That… that was good.”
—not that new issues had been written since the war started, but still.  Maybe once they got back—because, of course, they
Tony hands him the ring and leaves with the drawing before Steve can say anything, so Steve sticks it back in the safe, cleans up his workspace, and moves the furniture back to its original position.  When he’s done, he turns to find Tony leaning against the doorway with his arms crossed, staring at him.  “What are you looking at?”
Tony's Pa stared at him, as though shocked he'd even said anything.  Maybe Tony usually kept quiet. "No?" he repeated, and Steve could almost see his face getting redder and redder.  "What do you mean, no?"
"He wasn't himself today," replied the woman whose silhouette was visible through the doorway.  "I worry."
He picked up a rock, idly tossing it into the pond and watching as it promptly sank without skipping.  “So now you understand, maybe.  Why I had to keep on looking while we were underground yesterday.  We could have left and come back later, sure.  But at that point, I didn’t know if there would even
"When the outbreak happened, a lot of us boarded the airship—you remember the airship, don't you—and we took off, hoping to figure out what to do in relative safety."  Stark rubbed his forehead then, his gaze dropping to the table.  When he spoke next, his voice was a monotone.  "Jarvis had a heart attack.  We couldn't save him.  He died.  That was what we thought, anyway, until he got back up and he started attacking people.  Obviously we had to land the airship and evacuate, because he and everyone he bit would have turned us all otherwise. I got away with Rhodey in the suit."  Stark's voice remained as monotonous as ever, but Steve could see his fists clench.  "But we got separated from Pepper.  Rhodey and I split up to find her.  It didn't work.  It's been one thousand, five hundred twenty-seven days since I last saw her."
Ma smiled gently at him, and Steve took it in, all the creases of her face, every shade of blue in her eyes.  "Do you want to run from me, Stevie?" she asked.
.  But he wasn't speaking live - it had been pre-recorded and then broadcast when Steve triggered it.  How had he managed that on his own, when he clearly wasn't working for some studio?
Since Cap was actually moving now, Tony accepted his answer, and he pushed open the doors and stepped out of the airship, which was lightly smoking behind him.  They'd hit several rocks when they'd landed, apparently—no way was the hull going to be in any serviceable condition after this.
He looked to the edge of the ravine, then at Rogers, then back to the ravine.  It was too far for Tony to jump, but maybe Rogers could make it…?  “What do you think?” Tony asked.  “Is this a jump you can make?”
"Thanks," Tony said, getting up to take the tray from the woman, bringing it back to the bed.  "We have our own food, though."
Tony tries in vain to pull free, looking around anxiously.  “Steve, no,” he begins weakly.  “I—I can’t be seen with you.”
Tony has several answers for that.  The east coast.  New York.  The hospital.  Eventually, though, he tries, “Home?”
They cheated death so often and for so long, but it’s finally over.  In the end, it wasn’t a cosmic entity or a murderous time-traveler who was responsible.  It was three bullets: one through the back, two through the stomach, and just like that, the dream is dead.
"Because that would ruin my life?" Birch replied, setting the rifle down and rolling closer.  "You've already done such a good job at that."  He paused, tilting his head a little.  "Did Captain America tell you?" he asked.  "What exactly that stone does?"
Pepper managed a weak chuckle.  "I don't know if I should feel reassured by that or not," she said.  "But I'll take it for now.  There was a lot of blood, and you doing… what you did didn't exactly help very much.  But it's cleaned up and bandaged now.  It doesn't look like the bullet hit any bones, so you should be okay with a lot of rest."
they might be able to go faster if Rogers didn’t have to wait for him.  But he had no idea how to ride, much less ride bareback on a goddamn sabretooth.  What if he fell off?  What was he supposed to grab at?  But Rogers was being stubborn and somehow, he pulled off puppy-dog eyes really well.
"To get us there? I mean, I don't really feel like walking but if you do..." Tony was feeling stupider by the moment. How was it that this man, this annoying, selfless, kind, and loyal man made him feel like he couldn't even do simple math?
him, or overhearing snippets of conversation, hushed whispers of what they thought, good and bad. It worried him as well as elated him. When the voices spoke in reverence, in awe, he wanted to scream out,
He tucked his head under Steve's chin, curling up and picking at his fingers again. Steve wondered at how young Tony could look sometimes. How much did his lack of childhood mess him up? How much of that loss of innocence flooded into the adult he loved so deeply it sometimes hurt. "Tony," Steve tried, pulling the offending hand away. Tony made a small sound of protest, but when Steve wouldn't let go of his hand, he turned more into Steve's chest, and huffed in irritation. It barely concealed his distress.
It was terrifying and wonderful. Tony had somehow shifted everything. All of Steve's priorities switched. He didn't want the white picket fence anymore; he wanted coffee grounds and workshops. Reading nooks and sarcasm.
After Tony ate most of the sandwich and finished the fruit, he split the cookies with Rhodey, leaning his head on his shoulder as he chased the sweetness with the coffee. They were quiet, the need to fill the silences between each other gone by the end of their first semester knowing each other. Rhodey was content to act as a pillow for Tony, as he had done so often before.
The puffs from the machine began to slow, and Rhodey pressed his thumb over the Stark Industries logo on the bottom and rubbed across it. Tony was a household name, not just because of Iron Man, but because his name was on the best appliances, the best electronics. Items for every pay scale, quality unwavering. Washers and dryers for the low income family as well as the rich, twenty dollar coffee makers for the struggling college student that would last through their senior year and into their first jobs, as well as large machines stocked in coffee houses. Phones with the best shatter resistant screens from a hundred dollars to over a thousand. Tablets and computers for bookkeeping to gaming to multimillion dollar conglomerates. Rhodey, whose face was not nearly as recognizable out of the War Machine armor than it was within, found it almost surreal when he heard people talking about Tony Stark. Either
so happened to have made reservations at that fancy little French place a couple of blocks over. You know, to be prepared."
"It's not that." She looked contrite, apologetic, holding her palms out in a peace offering. Making her voice softer, gentler to deliver bad news in the way Clint knew Hill always did, she smiled sadly, tapping the large green tome under several papers. "This is the book he used?" Nodding, Nat fished it out of the pile and moved to hand it to Hill, but she shook her head. "I don't need to see it, Nat."
"Bruce, that's perfect," Pepper spoke into the microphone connecting the booth to them, "let's take a break." She looked back over at the other boys, "Go tell Thor, he can pick up on the harmony later, I need lunch."
it usually meant he was about to breach the one topic Tony really didn't want to discuss, aside from Ty Stone, that is, "that you should just climb into Steve's la-"
"Dude, I died once, and that was the worst pain I've ever been in, not to mention my fantastic entry into the world of open-heart surgery without anesthesia."
"Good idea." Sliding backwards down Steve's legs, his lips leaving his at the last second, Tony's hands expertly undid Steve's belt buckle. He tapped Steve's side for him to lean up so Tony could slide his pants and underwear off at the same time. "Missed that too," he gestured to Steve's length, already hard and leaking with anticipation of Tony's touch. "Know what else I missed?" he asked, wrapping a hand around him.
Tony thought. He mused over what Thor said, chewing on it like he was the cake. "I think you're right." He paused and looked at the god. "You're pretty wise, old man."
Howard snored when he was drunk. Tony remembered that fact abruptly as he opened the door to the guest room. He snored like a drunken sailor on leave. As a child he could only hate how it grated his sensibilities, how certain sounds were too much for his young mind to understand. How could Howard be so loud when Momma was so quiet. It assaulted him, dragging him right back to the age of seven when he had tried - for the last time - to climb in bed with his parents after a nightmare. Only to have Howard wake and angrily throw him out.
"Selfie!" He chucked, throwing his arm around Clint and pulling him close. Clint threw up a peace sign and they both smiled. "Oh, that's awful," Tony chuckled, looking at the photo.
The answering grumble was adorable, and Steve felt a little badly at waking him. But as Steve's hand traveled to Tony's round behind and the brown eyes popped open, he knew he'd at least made one right decision.
"It was a very cozy closet," Steve sasses right back, leaning forwards a little and lifting an eyebrow, "and we made a rather comfy home. But what's the fun in that if we can't have friends over to visit?"
Birch opened his hand, letting the ruined remote drop onto his lap.  He looked utterly unconcerned with everything that was happening.  "You have one minute left," he said.  "Godspeed."
Then he hears the clack of heels against the deck, looking up in time to see… oh.  Whatever this is—a dream, or limbo, or something else—it’s over now.  Time to go back to reality.  “Sunset,” he greets, reluctantly pulling away from Steve’s embrace and standing up.  “It’s freezing.  What are you doing up here?”
Tony arches an eyebrow at him, already squeezing some into his hand and rubbing it against his fingers.  “Do you want to do this or not?”
Steve groans, punching the doorframe in frustration, although he holds himself back just enough to not do any damage.  Tony doesn’t say anything, watching as his display shows Steve’s heart rate slowly, slowly lowering.  “Take off your mask,” Steve says at last.
A laugh bubbles out of Tony like he’s some sort of teenaged schoolgirl, and for a moment, he forgets about all the shit that went down in the past couple of weeks.  “Idiot,” he says.  “Get into my bed.”
"Oh, if that's what you think, I'm happy to play along," Tony replied with a roguish grin.  "Sure. Let's attribute it to my genius, then.  But… still some luck.  The timing, mostly.  If I hadn't figured it out by the time the biters came around, I'd be dead by now.  So I'm fortunate to have this.  A self-renewing power source is a valuable resource, especially these days."
And despite how much larger than life all of the above had made him seem, he was still real.  He'd been a hero during a time the world had needed a hero the most. And, when Tony was growing up, he'd been a hero to look up to during a time Tony had needed one the most.
For a long while, they look at each other in silence, and Tony can only imagine what Steve is thinking.  Then someone calls for Captain America, so Steve reaches out briefly, touching Tony’s shoulder.  “Let’s talk later.”
"Ma, my art's so good I could probably draw for the comics," Tony said.  Steve was infuriatingly modest when it came to his abilities, so Tony needed to balance things out.  "I figure I'm doing well enough that I can try another hobby."
Tony blinked, looking surprised as he put the paper away.  Not that Steve could blame him for his shock—while Tony had checked on his heart multiple times since Steve had woken up from the ice, this was the first time Steve had approached him about it.  "Nothing interesting," he said dismissively.
Well, almost empty.  Sitting at the far end of the table was the Star-Spangled Man himself, various files and papers strewn on the table around him.  His lips twitched slightly as he looked up at Tony, raising an eyebrow.  “And I could ditch you,” he said.  “But we’re under Fury’s orders.  Perfectly reasonable orders, I might add.  You can’t go down there alone.”
“Helping our country isn’t boring,” Rogers replied, because apparently he was the biggest Boy Scout ever, Jesus.  “We’re going to find new information about this place.  And we’ll learn a lot.”  He held up one of the papers, waving it at him.  “Stark, you do realize preliminary reports show that there are
But he hadn't, so it was just him and these letters.  He wondered if Steve had seen these. He hoped so. It was an insight into his parents that Tony had never had before.  He'd have to bring it up when he wrote his journal entry for the day.
"Everything was fine," Tony said as he headed to the sink, trying the faucet.  It didn't work, so he got on his knees and opened up the cabinet beneath the sink, starting to fiddle with the plumbing.  "I kept on expecting her to do something, but she just showed me her supplies and let me take what I needed, and then we came back.  She didn't tell me anything about herself."  He turned to grin at Steve before turning his attention back to the sink.  "I even used all of my considerable charms on her, but they didn't work."
Exactly how or why that happened was still a mystery, and one that Tony had an uncomfortable feeling would never be solved.  Whatever it was, it seemed to be triggered at random every few days after getting a good night's sleep. Naps didn't result in him waking up in Steve's body, and pulling all-nighters seemed to prevent it as well.
The woman looked at him, then at Steve.  Her eyes went wide, but before Steve could comment on it, she spoke.  "That would be appreciated," she admitted.  "If you two gentlemen have the time."
Tony swallows, feeling a lump rise in his throat and fighting to keep it back.  “Me too,” he says, and he’s never been more truthful.  “Y-you’ve made my life worth l-living, Steve.”  He lets out a trembling laugh, brushing away some more of the ice on the other man’s face.  “T-two nights ago, I wouldn’t have cared if this ship w-went under.  But now…”  Now he cares very much.  Not just about his own life, but also Steve’s.  In many ways, he thinks that maybe Steve is more important to the world than he is.
, apparently, and now that he was thinking about it more he realized he'd actually lost an entire day of his life.  A day that had, evidently, been lived by someone else instead. And as he kept going, more things fell into place, things that explained the strange happenings of today.
Cap nodded.  When he didn't say anything, Tony decided to continue, "I wanted to thank you for the other thing, too.  The saving-my-life thing.  I don't think I did."
"My dutiful son," Steve's mom said as she sighed and looked down at her remaining toast, which was mildly intriguing.
"Uh," Tony said.  He had no idea what she'd said yesterday, because he hadn't been here and for some reason Steve hadn't written about it.  "You'll have to remind me, because I'd really like to open this door and check up on you."
This wasn't right.  Tony was hurt.  But the biters were coming and Tem was about to shoot again, and they didn't have a choice.  Ignoring the pain in his side, he ran toward Tem, kicking the gun from his hand, but then Tem's leg swung out, and Steve wasn't fast enough to dodge it, instead tripping and gracelessly falling over.
going to do?" Rhodey said.  Tony had a feeling he knew what Rhodey was trying to imply, and he didn't like it.  Still, as long as he didn't actually
, it was the mean sabretooth who wanted to eat him.  But then their eyes met, and Tony’s worries melted away.  This was Steve.  He
Somewhat unsurprisingly, his passionate plea went ignored as Steve charged him, and once more Tony had to roll off to the side, narrowly avoiding Steve’s massive paw.  “Steve—” he began, but the words died in his mouth as Steve moved as fast as lightning, swiping his paw and tearing a gash into Tony’s arm.  “Fuck!” he gasped, instinctively shooting at Steve, eyes squeezing shut at the pain.  Damn it, this wasn’t good, not at all.
"I'm sorry to hear that."  The idea of serving his country but not being officially acknowledged for it… it stung a little.  Tony was as much a soldier as any of them, and he deserved the same kind of honor and respect.  "Hey.  Look."  He pointed to some dried muddy footsteps on the floor of the building they were in.  "These seem recent to you?"
“Here,” Sunset says, and they find themselves in the middle of a small throng of people gathered around one lifeboat.  Not too much time has passed since the collision just yet, and Tony suspects that the three of them are some of the earliest people to be convinced that they’re actually in danger.  In front of them, one of the ship’s officers is yelling something, but with all the commotion, Tony can hardly tell what he’s saying—something about women and children, he thinks, and both he and Howard look at Sunset.
He attempted to steel his voice, he really did. If he didn't feel okay, he could at least act it, but the slight shaking was obvious, especially to someone who knew him so well, and Tony had to look away as he saw the worry grow in Bruce's eyes. "I bumped into Howard in the kitchen. I can't…I mean, why- There is no
"So perfect like this," Steve muttered, his only warning before he began a quick and thorough staccato rhythm that sent Tony's body rippling in the aftershocks.
And there was Tony, face plate up on the suit as he surveyed the area, shoulders back, the look on his face unidentifiable, with a trickle of blood flowing from his forehead.
"Anyway," Rhodey began, letting his hands fall on Tony's knees, far too used to Tony to even react, "I think Agent Romanoff might have a point."
Tony shook his head, face hidden in the folds of Steve's shirt. "I don't know what I expected." His fingers dug into the material, gripping hard to anchor himself.
sort of paternal bond with him, no?" He was grasping at straws, he knew it. Howard didn't deserve to have Tony as a friend. He didn't deserve forgiveness.
"He would overflow, Steven. I would continue to pump into him until I climaxed again, letting the wetness push out and slide down his legs."
Steve chuckled, "Me too." He tugged Tony's hand. "I want to make love to you, and every single fanfiction trope."
At Tony's desk in the bedroom, in the early light of New York City, he began typing. The soft clicks quiet as he worked the keys to title his new story.
Reluctantly, he turned his back on the fight, knowing that with a dragon, the heavy artillery was a better solution to fighting it and his shield would only be able to do so much. A man and woman, huddled just inside the door to the cafe, looked up at him in desperation as he approached. "Come on!" he shouted, helping them up. "Follow me!"
Unable to begrudge Tony of that, Steve left Natasha to her spying. He approached Tony in the armchair, smiling as the genius looked up in surprise. "Hey there, handsome. Room for one more?" Tony plucked a book from the pile on the end table next to him, handing it to Steve without a word. It didn't matter what the novel was about, he only cared that Tony fit snugly in his lap, and the lull of pages turning took them from the afternoon into the evening.
meant Clint had to bring out his Borat voice, much to the consternation of everyone else in the room. "High five!" Except for Tony, of course, who immediately slapped palms with him.
Laughing softly, Bruce finally stepped up to Tony and placed his hand on his shoulder, "Always the futurist," he said affectionately. "Come on, help me bring everything to the table. Pancakes fix everything."
"I can do that." Bending his knees back against his body, Tony let out a small puff of breath, a soft moan trailing at the end of it. Steve kissed him once more before leaning back up to close Tony's knees against his chest, keeping his strokes, long, deep, and fast. It was an uncomfortable angle for him, but he was rubbing against that sweet spot inside Tony with every pass. This wasn't about him, Steve knew, this was about Tony. He had been the one to wake him just so he could go aid Nat, so his own pleasure didn't matter as much.
Pepper understood that Tony had developed special friendships with the other Avengers - and she was glad of it. He needed more people in his corner, but she and he had a bond that even Rhodey couldn't touch. It was something that their own tumultuous romance had been unable to break, something that Steve (and she was beyond happy that Tony had found love in Steve) didn't have with him either.
"It'll have to be. You've just returned from the dead, quite literally but also figuratively for the rest of the world. So let it calm down a little, and then you can take a vacation and get your wings."
. But even the strongest break at some point. Just promise me you'll be the voice of reason." Done, she released his hand and stood.
And Steve ended up getting that first dance after all. On a balcony in a Venice hotel, while the soft yellow lights of the city cascaded around their bodies. Swaying to music only they heard in the muted blue of an Italian evening, they had let everything go but each other.
Tony was many things, he was brash, sassy, and bossy. Too smart for his own good, and too outspoken. He was nosey, he was stubborn. And he had the biggest heart and capacity for love any of them had ever seen. No matter how hard he tried to hide it.
It was stilted still, for a few days, both Steve and Tony trying to fall back into the rhythm of friendship, but once they accepted that what happened was unchangeable but didn't need to deter the status quo, things fell back into normalcy. Three mornings before the next story was posted, they found themselves alone in the tower and seeking company. With no one else around, their only choice was each other. But it was the catalyst they needed to get back into the groove of things. It also helped that Tony didn't bring up kinks or fanfiction or the need to scream Steve's name when he came.
With a tilt of her head, she smirked. He was a bastard who abused her best friend, but he was still a force. There would be no Stark Industries without him building it, and she had to respect him for that if nothing else. He knew how to get straight to business; with Howard Stark, there was no pussyfooting around.
" She moved to the doorway to the living room and pointed to the clipping framed on the bookshelf. "If there's no Iron Man, then we don't win
"Whatever." He turned to face Rhodey. "So, let's say we can erase his memory and send his ass back home. You think
They entered at the back of the building through a lesser known entrance that was further to walk but had less time posing for photos. Hill, knowing the way, charged ahead to call the elevator, and all three stepped on in silence. Hanging from Hill's shoulder was a leather bag. In it -- tucked safely away -- was the spell book. They looked at each other before exiting the elevator into the common rooms, each looking more worried than the next. Hill, finally bringing the strap of the bag over her head, placed it on the kitchen counter. It was safe there.
hurt an innocent. You can think the fuck ya want, but know this: Tony Stark don't hurt no kids." Tony turned back to the safe. "Get ya money and get the fuck out."
Natasha's cheeks filled with air, and she blew it out, the sound cutting through the tension. All eyes turned to her. "I say we watch a movie." She shrugged, helpless at the confused gazes. "Look, this is so obviously awkward, and conversation isn't going to help. I'm just saying, something else to concentrate on while we eat would probably be better."
"Oh god, someone find the off button!" Bruce laughed, watching as Tony stood to stick his bottom out, turning so his back faced the table.
The morning light filters across the floor. Steve watches as the shadows grow with the rising sun, his head propped up on his fist. He hasn't slept. He's rumpled, unshaven, hungry.
Not like it showed him down much. The man let out a deep, pain filled scream, and ripped an amulet from a chain under his shirt. It glowed as soon as he held it in his palm, an eerie green that set Steve's teeth on edge.
"No promises." Howard held out the tray for the corn and waited as Steve stacked them on it. "Anything else?"
Steve's boxers were tented in a way that had Tony leaning forward to get his own taste, mouthing over the fabric, and dampening it with his tongue. Steve's breath caught.
Wrecked in the best way, Tony grabbed the dildo. Holding the two toys together, he pushed them both inside of himself.
And Tony knew he did. No man with such an innocence about him agreed to murder without having a good reason. "Tell me why."
Thor laughed. He threw his head back, and thunder rumbled beyond the windows. "Only one has that delicious fruit on it. I promise." The teacup looked absurdly small in his hands as he sipped from it. "I agree about the social norms you speak of. There are certain things in which they are necessary, but the dictation of whom somebody can love is not one of them."
Tony knows it's Steve. Now it's time to act. If only he wasn't a total hot mess. But there's sweetness, chocolate, reassurance, and a bathtub.
"Killjoy," he complained as the doors opened. "Anyone here? We brought nosh!" The kitchen was empty, and a peek into the living room showed the same.
He followed Tony through the thick cloud, passed the bandstand, and the barrels, through a dirty curtain, and behind a heavy door. A small space where Tony conducted his business when in this particular bar. The bodyguards stood a silent vigil outside the door.
Joseph winces where he's being annoyingly precise in applying dirt to Tony's pant leg. "He's got you there." He stands, taking a moment to admire his work. "No wings yet; you'll get them as soon as you meet with Philip."
"But at what cost, Natasha? Steve? Because if we keep pushing this, then Steve is going to feel like he has no other choice than to continue trying to protect Tony." He set his mug down and stood, walking to her bookcase and plucking a random title from the shelf. Running his fingers down the spine, he continued. "They already fought over Steve overstepping. What good will Tony and Howard reconciling be if he loses Steve over it?"
Tony's lucidity doesn't last. Despite the solid two hours he got from napping on Steve, he's still gone days without a proper sleep. By the next morning, he's slipping back into his drained, disconnected state. Steve, freshly showered and in a shirt not nearly as soft as the one he was wearing the night before, shifts under Tony's weight, his hand coming up to cup Tony's head so he doesn't jostle him too much.
"I know you would, Mr. Stark." Fury was actually chuckling. The sound was so absurd during such an awful moment that Howard took a step back, eyes going wide. Fury just clasped his shoulder. "Have a seat. There's a light at the end of this tunnel." All at once it felt like a balloon deflating after being blown up with too much air -- it has been too taut. The releasing of the air felt good. The entire room let out a breath, those words piercing the tense atmosphere.
Across town, Happy was dropping off the other three Avengers present at a Whole Foods. Clint was making a face. "I hate these yuppy stores."
There was no chance to answer. The elevator dinged loudly, cutting through the tense silence between them.
Steve knew he really wasn't all that funny. But the tense situation had Tony unknowingly seeking any type of positive release. Regardless, seeing Tony laugh set his mind at ease. They'd get through this, one way or another.
"Yeah? What's that?" Sitting, Howard swept some of the discarded salad from the table onto the floor.
"I don't care if you have to pretend, you will do what you have to in order to keep Tony happy. Do we have an understanding?"
As the elevator took them away, Tony heaved a deep sigh. "I should go find my father." Kissing Steve, he added, "Just give me fifteen with him?"
Bruce liked Tony's suite just fine; it suited the genius. But he preferred his own little nook. Tony had let them each decorate as they wished, presenting them with a slew of interior designers and expensive furniture, but Bruce just took the IKEA catalogue from the corner market and created his own space. Natasha, Clint, and Thor took advantage of the designers and their own little studios looked like they could be featured in magazines. Steve went back and forth between doing his own thing and taking professional advice. His was less perfect, but Bruce thought it looked more like a lived-in home than the others. Though, he never gave voice to that opinion.
Steve took his empty mug. "Let me get you more coffee." Sometimes the best comfort was the little things, small actions to help take care of those one loved. Coffee was one of those things between the bandmates: a warm drink, a favorite mug, and conversation. These were the things the fans
"We figured," Bruce said, and Tony could tell he was on speaker by the echo he heard of his own voice when he responded.
Tony felt the same way, his insecurity digging at the back of his mind that someone like him should ever have expected to be loved by someone like Steve. It had taken ten months of courtship and over a year of dating to quiet that voice. He was still constantly in awe of the man he had careened into completion with. He accepted a love without limitations, without obligation. Steve loved him -- despite his flaws or maybe because of them. It didn't matter.
'til she was murdered. I took those bastards out. Me. You killed for ya own mother. What's the fucking difference?"
. In his eyes, in his playful demeanor. If he could keep Tony, maybe it wouldn't be so awful. He could make a life here. It wouldn't be the same; it would be the death of every dream he had. But if he had his son, at least then he could make new dreams.
It's as they're leaving the headquarters that Coulson pulls Tony aside. His face is pinched and worried; it immediately has Tony on guard.
"Stop calling him that!" Tony yelled, throwing the washcloth hard to the floor. "I was not abused! I'm not- I wasn't an abused child! He was an ass, that's it!"
His carefully crafted persona was crumbling, all because of one asshole and three pricks with cellphones. Tony hated the idea of anyone not within his circle knowing how fucked up he truly was.
With his fork, he spears a sausage and points it at Coulson. "Tell me about the people you're watching over now. I'm gonna need to know who they are, right?"
That got Howard laughing again. "I've got some stories for you about your super soldier boyfriend." He motioned to Dum-E after he threw the ball. "Does he do any other tricks?"
Blindly reaching for the afghan on the back of the couch, Tony tugged it down. Steve helped him pull it over both of them, settling down to finally give into the urge to nap. Making up, the sex, and the talk had taken a lot out of them. It was time to rest.
"Think Tony will be okay with us teaming up?" Howard laughed, softly at first, but growing more confident. "You and me? We're trouble together. I'm sure Peggy had some stories."
It was nice to not feel like falling asleep directly after, and sometimes, he even had enough spare energy for round two.
"Ass. Listen to me," Clint smacked Tony's hand away that was waving at his to make more fake wind, "What are you? Six? Stop that. Tony!"
"In today's terms, I'm bisexual." Steve's voice was cold. "That's different than gay but still queer." Before Howard could speak again, Steve turned his back on him and gathered Tony into his arms, kissing him softly. "Come on, angel, let's go to bed."
Tony frowned down at that last sentence.  Serve the way he'd always wanted to? Tony was pretty sure Steve wanted to be on the front lines, because he had no right to do anything less than those who were already risking their lives for their country.  But he was small and thin and had all sorts of health issues. No one in their right mind would let him go to the front lines with the way he was right now.
The sound Tony had been trying to hold back came out now, and a loud, anguished cry escaped his lips.  From around them, the biters were turning in interest, some slowly lumbering their way.
"No one could stop Iron Man from showing up in Europe, no matter how much they might have wanted it," Tony replied with a little smirk.  "But Tony Stark, with his terrible heart, is a different story."
Steve exhaled and gave them a wry smile.  "I've heard that before, yeah," he said.  "And… you two are…?"
Cap lunged at him, but gunfire started at that exact moment and he missed, dodging out of the way.  Then more shooting—Jarvis was returning fire now, it seemed, but the airship was slower.  It was enough of a threat that the fighter would try to avoid it, but not enough where avoiding it was going to be particularly difficult.  The airship just wasn't meant for extensive aerial combat, but Tony was wondering now if he should remedy that.
But then Hercules attacks and Sam flies Steve away as the Thor clone kills Goliath, and Tony loses his chance to make things right.
"Yeah," Tony said, mind churning.  He hadn't recognized him, but… he almost felt like he should have.  He didn't know why.  Maybe it was because… "He didn't have to be there.  He probably shouldn't have, if he's calling the shots.  But he must be invested somehow."
Tony looks thoughtful for a moment, then gets off him, reaching under the front passenger seat.  “The lady might keep some lotion in the glove compartment,” he explains when Steve makes a questioning sound, then straightens, looking triumphant and brandishing a bottle before starting to uncap it.
Tony reached out, giving Steve’s head one more pat, then straightened to examine the pedestal.  It looked like the one from the big igloo in the underground city, but larger and missing the sabretooth drawings.  And unlike the other one, this one had not a gem, but a golden glove, its palm facing him.  The image of the hand looked vaguely familiar, though he couldn’t quite place it at the moment.  Could he wish on the glove?  God, it sounded so stupid, but it had worked on the gem, hadn’t it?  He’d wished on it, and things had come true.  Not in the best of ways, but it’d worked.
Everyone nodded.  Tony drew back from the huddle they'd unintentionally formed, looking around.  "Cap, you stay here.  Rhodey, head north.  Pepper, south.  I'll keep going east.  Stay within sight of one another at all times."
Steve still didn’t look entirely pleased, though the glare softened, at least.  Tony sighed in relief.  “Well, you had intent to break your promise.  That’s almost just as bad.”
Tony sucked in a breath, glancing over at Cap before looking at the rest of the room.  He thought he could hear something ticking.  One minute, Birch had said.  One minute to stop the bomb he'd presumably triggered from going off.
a more common name out there?  He doubted narrowing it down to Brooklyn would help much.  There were just too many Steves and too many Rogers and too many Steve Rogers, he was sure.
he read - and oh, right, this must have been in response to Tony asking him why he was trying to get into the army.
"Drop away!" Tony screamed.  Aware that he had only seconds left to act, he surged forward, making a grab for Bucky's leg, but the plane jostled and he caught only the fabric of his pants instead.
"How many times am I going to have to ask if you're crazy?" came the strained reply.  "I'm not fucking letting you go!"  He yanked sharply then, and after a moment, Steve found himself being pulled inside, the biter trailing after him.
“No,” Tony said fiercely, setting down his mug.  “I want to keep going.  We’re in this deep, and so help me God, we are going to stay down here.”
Steve let out a deep sigh, rolling his eyes right back.  He didn’t actually argue, though, only turning and leaving, so Tony picked up his gauntlets again, following him out.  They’d come back later—assuming Steve managed to actually catch something, he’d probably want it cooked.  Maybe.  Had Steve’s tastes changed?  He supposed they’d find out.
But he held back.  Because saying those words to Tony now, when it was going to be over for him soon—
Sunset scoffs, setting the turbine back down.  “Tony Stark wants to be a proper gentleman,” she says.  “I never thought I’d see the day.”
Rhodey tossed up a length of rope, which Tony managed to catch with his gauntleted hand.  "I know you can't pull on anything right now.  But I've made some footholds and I can climb out on the rope if you tie it to something.  Can you do that?"
They fall silent then, arms wrapped around each other as they shiver together.  There’s still screaming and shouting from all around, and if he twists a little, he can see one of the officers clutching at a floating piece of debris, blowing on a whistle.  But as far as he can tell, the lifeboats are all still far away, like they’re waiting for something.  For what?  For more help?  For them to all freeze first?
Tony shrugs elegantly, and now that he’s in the sun, looking relaxed and confident—so unlike the desperate man from the night before—Steve has to admit, he finds him striking.  “I was looking for you, actually.  Do you have a moment?”
Dimly, a part of his brain told him that this wasn't good, that this was the wrong way of handling things.  Staring into emptiness, thinking about nothing, mind completely blank - that wasn't going to help anything. He needed a better way of processing.
Apparently, Rogers was thinking the same thing, staring down at the bowl contemplatively.  Or maybe he was just figuring out how he was going to eat them.  Tony really hoped Rogers didn’t expect to be fed, mostly because that would be as awkward as hell, but also because if given a choice, Tony would choose to not be within striking distance of that gaping maw.  Which was
He caught a glimpse of Bucky's terrified face before the sky blossomed into clouds of red and yellow, and he knew then, as he tumbled downward, that it was over, that he'd failed to stop the thing he most feared.
He found himself at the entrance of the giant igloo-thing again, and with a deep breath, he peered into the opening, which led to a vast dome of blackness—except for one tiny thing he could see shining from within.
With that, the box seemed to come to life, making some sort of whirring sound as it lit up from the inside.  Steve yelped and jumped back before regaining his composure and stepping closer, unable to help his curiosity.  There was something inside! He pressed his face against the box to get a better look. There was something round and flat and it was spinning.  Was that where the roast would appear?
With Cap out of the room, Tony took a little less care moving around than he would have otherwise, and he reached over with his bad arm to tweak a few more settings, grunting in pain afterward.  God, he couldn't wait for this to be over.  As much as he didn't want to admit it, it might be nice to take a moment to actually breathe—even though he knew rationally that really, he couldn't ever rest.  Not while the war was still going.
Finally, it was over.  Exhausted, Tony stumbled away from the remains of the outpost, clutching at his side in a vain attempt to ease the pain of the bullet wound.  His mouth was dry from the heat, and even without seeing it, he knew his skin was sticky with sweat and dust and soot. Still, he pressed on, needing to put as much distance between him and the cave as possible.
Cap felt warm around him, and Tony realized he didn't want to leave.  But then the airship groaned in a way that reminded him that they
Tony tapped the picture.  "On its own, the text here doesn't mean much, just that one day whoever was in charge decided to move some things around.  Combined with the knowledge of our friend here—" he motioned toward the thing that looked like tiger's-eye, still sitting in its jar on the table—"which is
So he’s not sure what exactly possesses him to buy a huge cruise ship when he’s over a hundred, getting on board and telling the crew to get going, but he doesn’t fight it.  He instead goes to one of the lounges on deck, a drink clutched in one hand, and then he sits and watches the ocean as it rolls past them.
"Yes," Stark said, and there was actually wonder in his eyes as he looked at Steve.  "You're still upset with me.  I can tell.  But it's only been a few months for you, and… you're right to be upset."  Steve blinked at this, because this wasn't how their last conversation had gone.  "But Christ, Steve.  It's been ten years for me.  I mourned you when I thought you died."
“Oh, God,” he whispers, backing up until he hits a wall, gripping at it for dear life.  “Oh God, oh God.”
Tony’s lips part, and for a moment, he’s completely taken aback by her vehemence.  “I—” he manages, and for a moment, he feels awful and guilty and wrong.  He’s hurt her.  It’d seemed like such a grand idea before, but now with her right here, eyes fiery and passionate, he can’t help but think he’s made a mistake, never mind all the things she’s done.
Cap trailed off.  Tony stared at him expectantly for a moment, but when nothing came, he prodded, "But?"
Finally, though, something clicked.  Steve sighed in relief, just about to open it up—and then he smelled something acrid fill the hallway, and everything went dark.
Stark rubbed his forehead.  "Steve, it's not rational to not kill any of them," he said.  "It was okay when we were just running away, but if we need to secure a place for Jessica that's not going to work out."
Tony snorted.  "I'm as surprised as you.  But yeah, I guess she did.  After the biters were taken care of we squeezed you and Bucky onto the gurney and brought you back to the hospital.  We gagged you because we still weren't sure if you were going to turn."  He swallowed thickly, looking down.  "You were unconscious for several hours.  But… you woke up.  And now you're here."  Tony smiled cautiously then, continuing, "You got bit.  And you survived."
"Anyway," Stark continued before the silence could stretch on for too long, "now that you've woken up, we can continue with the plan.  Get you to Bethesda.  Find a way to fix this damned thing."
Breath catching, Tony set the gauntlet down, then reached up to unbutton his shirt, looking at the gem embedded in his chest.  This… this was it, he was pretty sure.  This was the missing gem.  If he took it out of himself and put it in the gauntlet, then it would work.  He
"Are you crazy?" Tony shouted at him.  He was ahead of Steve now, eyes wide.  "I'm gonna try and stop the train!"
But then again, he’s heard other things too, seen troubled glances passed from crew member to crew member, and slowly but surely, the truth is dawning on him—their ship is sinking.  Their ship is
Steve nodded, and Stark followed him as they walked past Jessica and Carol to find boxes and boxes of packaged goods.  Stark went up to one of them, placing a hand against the box and letting out a low whistle.  "I can see why people stuck around, even if the guy was a little nutty," he said.  "It's worth listening to some cock-eyed crap if it means not starving."
He couldn't dawdle.  Tony could be anywhere, and Steve was now racing against time, with a horde of captive biters—though just
Tony pouted up at him.  “Aren’t you supposed to bind them so they hurt less?  I’m hurting.  Bind me.”
Cap, undeterred, opened the jar and pulled the fragment out of the foam so he could dump it onto his palm.  "Look."
Steve reluctantly turned his gaze toward the papers.  "It's the blueprints for the Tveria," he said.  He turned back toward Tony.  "I'll get them to Jim and your friend.  I promise."
, even as he approached adulthood—how could he not, when the pages were more thrilling than anything he could find in a theatre?
Tony snorted softly, going quiet.  Steve waited patiently, and sure enough, Tony eventually spoke up after a few moments.  "I guess," he said, "I was just thinking about how lucky I was to have the reactor."
“I saved the world while you were vacationing in London!” Tony snaps back, stepping toward him in turn.  “And for your information, the virus has a 97.5% fatality rate and I could have
Howard had laughed him out of the room.  Then he’d come after Tony later, screaming at him that his name and connections were the only worthwhile things about him.
So when the radio finally crackled to life, it was all Tony could do to keep himself from leaping forward and grabbing onto the box, though he did curl his fingers around the microphone, trying to keep himself from shaking.  It would be okay, he told himself.  Steve had survived the fight.  They would land the plane and everything would be okay—
. His son! They looked a fair bit alike, he'd give into that, but Tony's eyes were something else. Big and brown, soulful and deep. They looked like...well, they looked like Maria's. The thought of starting a family with the beautiful Italian he had just started dating should have sent him into fits of joy. Maria was
Bored was a lie. There was always a new project, or an unfinished blueprint. No, bored was Tony's way of saying he needed to talk. They rarely ever got into the actual reason that he needed that, but if all Rhodey could do was offer a friendly conversation, that's what he was there for.
He feels like he's under water, like he did the few moments after he hit the ice before unconsciousness took away the pain. It's jarring. Confusing. If Tony is dead, then Steve can never tell him. And that's not right. That's not how the story ends, it can't be! He has to tell him, has to at least take the chance of holding Tony close and saying those words. It's not right. It's not fair.
As soon as he was out of earshot, Steve left the steaks to cook and walked over to pluck the lettuce from Howard's hair. "Having trouble with the salad, Howard?"
Her shoulders sagged in concession, "I know," she answered quietly, "but it's kinda hard to separate."
He shivered, his thoughts circling back to his conversation with Natasha and Clint and how they had plans to
He was a mess, and the others were noticing. Steve definitely knew something was up. He was the one who rubbed Tony's back when he threw up, the one that put heating pads over his stomach when the pain got to be too much, and the one that gave him gentle reminders when he knew Tony didn't remember something.
He screamed. "Steve!" And his world exploded in a burst of white, his cock spurting his seed in ropes upon ropes across his stomach, his legs shaking in the intensity.
"-But you are brilliant. And you had this sense of adventure and the want to do the right thing but also have fun, and it was infectious. You were my friend. And you
But Steve didn't speak. There were no words to say, and the sound would only make the pain in Tony's head feel worse. In his mind, he was in full lecture mode.
Howard took the armchair across the room, sitting stiffly. "I don't think we've been properly introduced."
As Steve lifted Tony and braced him against the wall, Tony closed his eyes and savored the feeling of Steve pushing inside of him for the last time, the feeling of fullness, connection, and completion. He wrapped his arms around Steve's neck and stared into his eyes, allowing himself to drown in the depths of a blue he could never put a name to.
"All set then. I'll see you in an hour, Rogers." Turning on her heels, Natasha left, Bruce following behind, barely holding in a snicker. The door clicked behind them.
"Hey, yourself," Steve spoke softly, setting aside a shirt he had just folded and standing. "You hungry? Want something to drink?"
over protective of Tony. Not just Steve." She brought the point home by majestically stomping her foot.
"Yes," Thor purred, his eyes darkening. "Yes I would like that." His voice was like gravel, husky and deep. "I would make you take me into your mouth after. To taste the real thing."
Steve's face paled. "There was a child there. A little Irish girl, fresh off the boat I think. I told her to run, to go home."
The man actually smiled at Bruce, his one eye indulging. "Something strong. Make it a double." Nodding, Bruce moved to the bar, and Howard's eyes followed him before the clearing of a throat had him twitching back to the director.
"It's not that I- What I mean to say is-" Howard huffed, inpatient with his own answers. "Can I be frank? Without you, ah- you know," he motioned to Mjolnir. "Natasha told me about you and I've, uh, I've seen videos of exactly what it is that you can do with that thing."
"At least they got my good side." Tony said, moving down the line, looking at more pictures of he and the team dodging what had become their everyday annoyances. "This is depressing."
"I just wanted to make sure you're handling this," Pepper handed him a water bottle, taking her seat behind the desk.
Like Wesley from The Princess Bride, StonyFan1918 apparently heard Tony's request of rimming and gave a big ol' AS YOU WISH. Also, something else happens, there's some smut, and maybe something with a smug Natasha? I don't know, you guys are acting like I wrote this shit.
As sad as it is to witness her deterioration, even for only a few minutes, the love between the older couple was palpable. It was ageless. Something that transcends her illness, his bad hip. Something pure and immortal. Something rare that would live on even after their deaths.  And despite the cold, he is warmed by it, if only for a one small moment. It envelops him, like a hug or a blanket. A hot cup of tea by the fire as he sketches the man so often in his thoughts.
Clint's grin was equal parts cheeky and evil. "Yup!" But he still poured a cup of coffee for himself and Howard, handing him the mug. "Half and half in the fridge, if you want it, Asshole."
Something clicks in Michael's head, and his eyes go wide. "That's brilliant. And he's integral; we know he'll be integral. And Philip? One of the best mentors we have. He's an obvious choice. Why didn't I think of that?"
"How can I be a pest and an angel all at once? That's contradictory." Tony's eyes narrowed slightly and he slid one of his hands around Steve's waist, pulling gently.
As Steve dipped his tongue just past the muscle, Tony's mouth fell slack. He let out a long, high pitched moan, his hand flying from the back of the chair to Steve's head, pulling him closer to his hole. Steve took the opportunity for what it was and used his hands to spread Tony even farther, delving into him, licking and sucking and biting until Tony was writhing on the chair, gasping and moaning, his cock heavy and fully erect, waving in the air above his abdomen.
"I entered and he came up to me. I was fascinated." Howard shrugged sheepishly. "I wanted to see how he worked, you know, trying to keep my mind off of what happened." Tony nodded in understanding, staying quiet for once so Howard could finish. "And he shoved the tennis ball into my face. Imagine my confusion. JARVIS helped out, said Dum-E really likes fetch and he's basically a robotic dog. Also, Dum-E? Really? That's what you name him?"
Tony whined, again, and Steve swore he'd stamp his feet if he wasn't already sitting down. "You're not even going to call me to tell me goodnight?"
Steve let go of all control; his hands gripped tightly at Tony's waist, pushing and pulling him back to meet his thrusts, angling and pumping hard as his balls tightened with his impending orgasm. "Come on, doll, come for me." He leaned forward, his hands sliding up Tony's abdomen to his chest, tweaking his nipples. "Let me see you."
, only half Sicilian on his mother's side, but no one was as ruthless, as intelligent, and as cunning. He had slaughtered his way to the top of the Randazzo family, taking what he knew belonged to
He shot him with a Smith and Wesson Model 19, a gun supplied to him by a shady mobster under Tony's payroll. The proof? His whole left hand, or what was left of it after a molotov cocktail exploded ten years prior, nearly killing him and leaving him disfigured. Steve thought it more apt to have called him Paulie Half Face, but that was neither here nor there.
Seeing a flash of red shoot across his vision, Steve stood and hastily put distance between him and Howard. "How dare you," he spit. "How dare you ask me to support you? Who the hell do you think you are? No!" he snapped when Howard opened his mouth to speak, "You don't get to talk. I-" he roughly jabbed his finger into his own chest, "get to talk now. You had your turn." Howard nodded once, wisely keeping quiet. "
"Bridgette…" Coulson looks confused for a moment. "Ah, your case worker. She's right—it is. But that doesn't make it any less jarring." His hand is rubbing soothing circles on Tony's upper back. "The drawback to being a guardian angel, I'm afraid. You'll still feel all the same emotions, and anything left unresolved in your mortal life is still a memory to process."
Rhodey had flung himself from the bathroom, intent on attacking Howard when a sob from the floor detoured him.
"I mean to be fair, Howard's got twenty years on you." Steve turned away and Tony threw his head back, groaning; it was a bad time for a joke. "I know, Steve. But he's going to find out. Wouldn't it be better that he finds out from me?"
Steve's breath caught. He didn't know Tony ever paid that much attention to poetry or his ramblings about their meanings. Certainly not enough to say what Steve thought he was trying to say.
"Exactly. I was all over the place at first. Grasping at anything that gave me some semblance of feeling normal and okay. I went on a road trip. I visited Peggy, I kept searching and searching for something to make sense. It was only when I started to accept and build a new life that things settled down. And you? You're going to feel the same. But this time-- this time the traveler isn't alone. I want to help you, Howard. I want to help you adjust. If you'll have me, that is."
added. She wanted to punch him. Now was not the time for his particular brand of comedy. But when she shot a glare on his direction, she saw he looked just as stricken as the rest of them.
Steve flipped them, Tony's back landing on their shirts. He chuckled at Tony's undignified squeak, yanking off his jeans and boxers and pushing his legs up and open. "My absolute favorite," Steve murmured, pressing his face close and inhaling Tony's musky scent. "And it's all mine." He parted Tony's cheeks, revealing his pretty little hole and dove in, wasting no time in getting exactly what he wanted. Licking, biting, sucking… Slowly working Tony open as the legs on either side of his head quivered and trembled with the fight against closing them. He was so involved, he didn't feel Tony flail his arms to get into the nightstand drawer and toss the bottle of lube next to Steve.
"Your son, in the Iron Man armor, flew it up into space and aimed it at their ship instead. He's the reason we won. He's the reason this city is still standing."
Bathing Tony when his wrist and ankle are wrapped in fiberglass casts is difficult enough without the added complication of his exhaustion. Two days of the same cycle of sleeping and waking, panicking and searching have left him a little stale, and in the moments when he is awake long enough to hold a coherent conversation, he begs to be able to wash.
"Tony, that’s not-" Steve felt his resolve slip away like water down a drain. He had come to apologize, but that wasn't what Tony needed at that moment. He needed someone to redirect him, to move his mind away from the anxiety and back onto solid ground. Once Tony was mentally stable - or at least not as shaky - then, and only then, could Steve breach the subject of his indiscretions that morning. But for the moment, Tony needed his boyfriend, not his captain, and not his protector.
Tony was honestly shocked with himself. It was rare indeed that he was able to go for round two, but in the water, his cock was swelling. And he could feel Steve growing harder behind him.
"I can't- I mean, it's not fair-" He sighed and pushed through the rapid beating of his heart and the tightness in his chest. Steve looked up, worriedly. "This whole - I don't know what to call it. Situation? - Hasn't been at all fair to you. I put you in a position you never should have had to be in."
Steve volunteers. It is - for the most part - because he is the only one able to lift Tony with no difficulty. Thor can, but he isn't there. Tony needs stable arms to bring him to the bathroom, arms that won't jostle his ribs too much and can bear the weight as he is stripped and cleaned. Steve, of course, forgot about the stripping part.
The woman shook her head, "Not necessarily. I'm a nutritionist, so I have some experience here. What did he eat to make him sick?"
The brisk October morning was colorful, the trees turning vibrant shades of yellow and gold with the wind twiddling through the leaves like a hand through hair. Tony pulled his coat tighter around his neck and turned towards the fans bundled up outside the restaurant. He recognized them from various events and smiled warmly, "Hi, beautifuls!"
Because Steve might turn him away. He might agree with him and wise up. So every time Tony tried to force himself to say the words, the sounds got caught in his throat.
"Dirty mouth." He trailed open mouth kisses down Tony's back, spreading him open before giving just one long lick, causing Tony to cry out in want. "Patience, angel." He kept the lube in a box on the nightstand, and it was quick retrieval, though not quick enough as he ran his thumb up and down Tony's hole and listened to the incredible begging from below him.
Steve tilted Tony's head up and kissed him again, and Tony felt the passion, the love, and the acceptance. Once more, his eyes started to fill. He pulled away, frustrated with himself.
That bubbled a laugh out of Tony, who dutifully took the sandwich. "This was my mom's favorite. She used to put it on Ritz Crackers."
He'd seen them argue. Screaming in each other's faces, spit flying. So angry, Clint was sure they'd never speak to each again. Hell, a fight between them in the suits ended up destroying most of Tony's Malibu mansion.
Inside the restaurant, Clint checked in with the maitre d' and Tony pulled out his phone, sending a tweet about the fans they had just met (again) to really give them something to boast about.
It was no use trying to hold back, his hips snapped forward, and he was coming, crying out and biting down on Tony's shoulder. He was never a rude lover, he had something to finish, regardless of how spent he felt. Tony, the poor human puddle he was, was easy to manhandle into his back, and Steve sucked at the hollow on his throat, taking him in hand.
Taking a deep breath, Steve walked slowly, but on steady feet into the room, coming to stand near the father and son. "It's good to see you laughing," he quietly spoke to Tony, a small smile emerging from his lips. He felt no need to assert himself or prove himself, or do anything other than say his observation. It was a wonderful feeling to be on such stable ground. He knew what he needed, what Tony needed, and what Howard needed. And he knew how to give it without forcing it on either of them. They were,
"We had a date. She was going to teach me how to dance. But then I went into the ice, and by the time I came out, she was an old lady with Alzheimer's, and that was it. No chance." His hand is warm against Tony's cheek, and Tony longs to hate him, to feel indifferent to his heat. To not want to kiss him.
"One stick of butter, coming right up!" A thunk behind Clint's head had both he and Howard whipping around, Clint yelping. "Jesus, Nat!"
The look she gave him spoke volumes; she was disappointed he hadn't figured it out. "Because I needed to know if you were okay. And you're not."
It was a few hours later when Tony noticed the light was dimming and checked his watch. "Oh shit, it's almost five."
"How chivalrous," Tony deadpanned, though his eyes were light. She let out a snicker and closed the door behind her.
"Because things have happened that have made people-" Steve paused, obviously regrouping, "-that made things a certain way. You change anything and it could change the entire course of the world."
"I'll let you sleep in one of your teammate’s beds. Because I know that they know that I'll skin them alive if they try anything with you."
"No problem. Happens to me more than I'd ever admit." She still looked uneasy, but her smile was friendly, "My son," she gestured to the excited boy behind her, "he was wondering if he could have a picture?"
