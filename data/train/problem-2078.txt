I am sure John reached out to you just as Seb did to me and left the most exciting message. they are meeting us at the fair tomorrow. They will be in town and go straight to the carnival and meet us there. Gosh, I really miss him. I wish it was 6-30 PM Friday already and not 9 am Thursday right now!!”
“That’s okay,” Sherlock murmured, already half asleep, “I’m just glad I’m cuddling the real John, not pillow John.”
“Yes,” Molly said, “I called Mary, she’s a sort of buddy. She told me Emily Mortimer is treating John and any evidence or help can be given to her in strict confidentiality. Of course we will tell Sherlock but that will be a different conversation, more like a friend to friend. But first, let’s see how your recollections can help poor John. He seemed so lost and such a sad puppy when we met him, my heart really went out to him for that.
“Are you sure we should be here?” John asked tentatively even though he was secretly relieved that it was going per plan, Sherlock had himself suggested something he was about to suggest – of letting their tryst continue in the privacy of the Moriarty villa.
John leaned in, threading his fingers suggestively through Sherlock’s hairs and stroking behind his ears. The detective, dorky as he was, waited until he had understood what was coming up before he took it in his usual inimitable style,
John’s eyes widened, “Sherlock?!?” The chef nodded and showed him a few items, “Sir, Mr. Bouffler felt we waste too much food and cook too many greasy items, things which are not right for everyday consumption. So he spoke to a nutritionist, showed her your blood and other reports, spoke to your personal trainer and helped me change the whole meal planning process and ingredients. He helped me get online training, bought me books, new vessels that require very less to almost no oil or fat to cook food….. he has even given meal suggestions by day. Only one day a week you can indulge, the rest of the days it’s going to be only healthy and balanced meals from now on.”
a bad idea for a soldier to get some extra support, provided it’s only temporary. While I appreciate what the tax-payers do and the difficult life most of the workers in civil and corporate jobs lead, none of them risk their necks for the nation. A man like you, used to saving lives under pressure, with limited resources and support, will be invaluable for the society. I suggest you go for the lump sum payment for temporary disability and the normal pension scheme as a retired officer due to injury during active and warfront service.”
“Won’t happen again,” John assured, “We should have at least returned your calls or take you out for a meal.”
“Guess why I took you on without any prior notice or appointment, gave you a discounted rate and even made you a house guest instead of directing you to our preferred hotel or service apartment?” Greg asked John as they sat on the terrace the next morning, sipping some flavorful Darjeeling leaf tea.
“But Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson countered, “From what I just heard, that makes the two of you! If he thinks you’re socially awkward and incapable of being easygoing, interesting company, then he doesn’t score too high on that scale either. As you just said, you’re quiet half the time and the other half of the time he practices silence. It seems both of you have decided that the other one should take the first step. Result – a complete deadlock and a game of cat and mouse. Not good at all if you ask me.” She gave Sherlock a mug of hot cocoa and put a liberal dose of whipped cream on top, “Listen, one must not be afraid to seek what he wants and once he finds it, he should be even less scared to go all out to get it.”
Sherlock had enjoyed his trip to London and his conferences, submissions etc had gone very well. A rather plum sponsorship had been signed for his future project while for the current one he had been given a provisional approval. Things were going well and if they went on in this manner he would soon discover a new compound that would be useful in treating severe burn wounds and even help an acid-attack victim could recover and regain 85% of their pre-burn skin and features.
“Don’t worry, that’s no Mount Everest,” John went a bit beyond the spot, “This will give you an even better view. I should turn to this side, yeah?”
Before cumming he dutifully warned Sherlock that he was dangerously close to the edge. After this there was no turning back, no slowing down. He could feel a slow and sweet ache build in his balls, he could feel the cum build, his cock was beginning to grow impossibly hard and rigid, he could sense his body was tensing up for that ultimate moment as his mind went on a mad spiral of sensations. He reached down and grabbed Sherlock’s cock, giving it a few steady and hard tugs. Instantly he felt tightening of the sheath around him and wetness on his fingers, indicating Sherlock’s impending climax. “Baby,” he rasped out, totally breathless by now, “I can’t hold on much….. fuck,” he scrunched his eyes shut for a moment, “…. Much longer. You there…. There yet Sherl???”
Sherlock said as he continued to shake and pant from his orgasm, “I-I read about them, they eat kilos and kilos of bamboo and poop kilos and kilos as well.” He paused to catch his breath and added, “Lazy, very cuddly but lazy, can grow to large proportions, they are loners and prefer to be on their own….they are so comatose at times that they…..” again a pause and a deep breath, “Sometimes
“Then make me yours, I want to feel you, I want us to be one, together, just fuck me…..” Sherlock babbled when John put his hand over his mouth and pressed down on his lips, “Shhh, you don’t need to beg or even ask,” he said in a husky, sexy tone, looming over him like a predator on the loose, “I have been waiting to do this for a long, long time.”
“So he is. But I will mind my moves and watch my steps and tie all loose ends. Won’t give him a chance to do anything destructive.”
“So asking him about his family, college days, his work, students, what he does over the weekend, that’s not prying?”
“Oh-kay…. So where do you want me and how do you want me?” John asked, winking at how mushy and kinky it sounded.
“Oh wow,” Sherlock was pretty taken aback as he stepped out of the rowhouse and saw John waiting right there with a shiny new silver-colored Audi A4, “New car!!! AlreadyI thought you had bought a motorcycle and that would be sufficient.”
“Well then,” Molly congratulated Sherlock, “You’re on your pre-wedding-moon or whatever fancy name they call it.” Sally chimed in with ‘Sex-cation’ and it made even the normally somber Haines clasp his mouth and chuckle softly.
Irene shrugged, “I don’t know. Heard the same scream as you. Hey, Molly, open the door. Are you okay?”
Sherlock grinned, “Well, I have very good powers of observation and I am a great people-watcher, right? So, when I am on the train or walking down the road I am extremely aware of my surroundings, be it traffic or people. I observe them quietly and keenly and it didn’t take me too long to spot this man. Always on the same train, always there whenever I am going home, he walks all the way until I enter the street my house is on. He neither lives on that side of town nor does he work within a couple of blocks of where we work. So why is he on that train or on that street, huh? You should see him on the train, he keeps gaping at me when he thinks I am not looking and when I do, he startles and stares away for the entire time. He seems petrified that I might actually talk to him, start communicating.”
John checked his watch. Two hours to go before guests started to arrive for Mrs. Hudson’s dinner party. If he called Mary now and cancelled, she would probably still be able to set up something with her best friend Alice or her cousin Duke. Or maybe she would join the party in the apartment block she lived in, where several single people lived and had no one to celebrate Christmas with. Hence they pooled in money and organized a pot-luck dinner with each person bringing in a dish. He felt terrible about this but he also had a foreboding feeling in his head that this was a very bad idea of getting Sherlock and Mary to meet in the presence of Greg Lestrade, Molly, Mrs. Hudson and two of Mrs. Hudson’s sisters and Mr. Chatterjee, her ‘friend’.
named Sherlock Holmes. It’s popularity is so sudden and spiked up so much that it even got hacked for a little while.”
John was about to stop Sherlock from blabbing any more nonsense when a strange thing happened. “Show me a pic of this boy,” Eugenia said unexpectedly.
“Oh fuck,” John wiped the sweat from his brow and collapsed next to Sherlock, panting, “Oh God baby I am so sorry.”
“Don’t stress yourself out John. Have some faith on the powers above, the one that guides us and puts us in the right directions, to show you the way. For now, I do share your feelings, a sense of pure confusion about what you feel for our Sherlock, but please do look at things from his side as well. He is a man who hasn’t had a chance at romance for a long time. He lost someone and never had another. He’s sensitive. A second time if he’s let down, he won’t…..”
“And this?” Sherlock held the small box in his hand. “Guess what,” John winked but when he saw Sherlock beginning to apply his usual science of deduction and start by explaining which country manufactures those boxes, he quickly took the box from Sherlock’s hand and opened it for him. A pair of plain gold bands lay there, both bearing some inscriptions on the side. “It says amor omnia vincit,” Sherlock said, “Love conquers all.”
of December we part by the morning train at 7 am. Breakfast there, at 9 am and I think we should be able to make it.”
Jim’s moans were irresistible and Sebastian parted his legs and cooperated with Jim as the latter got his cock bobbing free and out of its confinement in no time. His brain melted in the heat of the moment and as passion built in his loins, Jim’s slippery mouth slid on to his cock. Sebastian gasped and shrieked, “Holly everything there is, oh yeah, don’t stop it please!”
Somberly she nodded and said, “Very well, I will talk to Greg and some of the community representatives and ask them to look into the matter. If necessary I will involve the Mayor, who presides over the entire county and is personally known to me since she’s a cousin.”
Sherlock nodded. There was nothing to ask or say here. He liked Mary, found her quite pleasant, intelligent and clued in. He would have hated to have to yap with someone who was an airhead. “You have got your first payment, the signing amount, right?” John asked, not looking at Sherlock anymore and fidgeting with the edge of a paper in the dossier before him. When Sherlock answered in the affirmative, John glanced at Mary who promptly grabbed Greg Lestrade by the elbow, “I think we should let them talk and get to know each other. You will be leaving tomorrow morning so plenty of time to catch up with John in the evening or so. For now, how about I organize your payment.”
Dame Rosalie Watson gave her grandson a scrutinizing stare. “John, you are leading your life all wrong. You’re making the same mistakes your mum made. People will let you down, but that doesn’t mean you don’t trust anyone ever again. If your love hasn’t been reciprocated by one, that doesn’t make you any less worthy. It means someone else might suit you better. I had repeated these words to your mother over and over again, right up till the end.” She sighed, “I won’t be around for long now. But I lived a happy, fulfilled life. Yes, I had a philandering husband and a brother in law who I had wished…. I could marry. But he chose a bachelor’s life and I chose to be devoted to your dad. At the end it didn’t work perfectly for any of us. But we managed, we forgave, we at least found closure.”
The toy went in and was turned on at medium speed. As Sherlock let out a low, rolling moan, John plunged in and came immediately, followed by a crowing Sherlock who had a spontaneous orgasm by feeling John cum inside.
and I need to stop him from going further, from committing the biggest one of all. James, John Watson is living with Sherlock now, in Sherlock’s suburbia mansion. He claims he has amnesia but his kind of amnesia could reverse any moment.
Sebastian and John were deeply affected by the sufferings of their friend. Molly and Irene also went back with her, Irene because she was a good buddy of hers and wanted to be with her while Molly chose to leave a place that she considered unsafe and cursed. “Are you guys not coming along too?” She asked John. “We will be there in a week’s time,” John replied, “As it is her family and friends will be there, as would be the doctors treating her. We can’t do much.”
“I have a profession, I have a life, I love solving cases with him but I can’t seriously be expected to tag along every time…..” John started saying but by then Mycroft was already on a phone call. By the time the call ended, he had to rush somewhere and John was effectively asked to go back upstairs and let Anthea come downstairs quickly. The conversation came to a grinding halt and John, already suffering from exhaustion overload, curled up on his chair and promptly went back to sleep.
And yet here he was, stuck in this rut. Somehow he felt very sorry for him and his condition. At the same time he also felt a compelling urge to help this man in any way he possibly could.
Sherlock had let go of his cock as he came, so he quickly ducked his head and swallowed John again, just in time to catch half the seed on his tongue while the other half spilled on his chin.
“I…. I want to be a doctor…. I mean, I already am….” John stopped, looking a bit coy and awkward, “You can laugh at me now.”
“Go on then, give him an answer,” Mycroft said impatiently. He had done a full volte-face from his earlier refusal to accept this engagement. By spending two days with John he was now fully assured the man was a gem. Even though a little doubtful due to the amnesia he still suffered from, he had eventually given his blessing. Now he appeared to be siding with John, which made his partner Roger smile broadly and add, “Have pity on the poor man’s knee Lockie.”
The other photo was that of a young Sherlock leaning against a pole, evidently on holiday and making a face of ‘exaggerated joy’ as he spread her arms out and stared skywards. He was in some tropical region, amidst lots of foliage.
Jim promptly took the ring and slipped it on, then said in a naughty tone, “Arise Mr. Moran Moriarty and junior Moran please refrain from arising until we are in a private place!”
Mycroft was twenty-one and Sherlock was thirteen the next spectacular foot in the mouth incident happened. Mycroft had dated girls for five years, including a serious girlfriend who lasted two years. But by the time he had hit twenty, Mycroft realized he was something else.
John realized what was happening and for a fraction of a second he knew what he wanted to do. He wanted to stop, take a step back, assess the sudden change in their situation and also ask Sherlock if he had overstepped his limits. But then his overheated groin touched the bottom of Sherlock’s bubble butt and before he knew it he was thrusting up too, grinding insistently against the young man who had become so pliant, so malleable in his arms.
, that I have started a blog after your little incident a week ago? No? Okay, I am telling you now. It’s a blog called ‘Sherlock Holmes, and The Science of Deduction’. On that I have started summarizing and outlining the details of your cases, starting with the very first one we solved together. I have updated one of your past cases too, since Lestrade gave me the details from some Scotland Yard files. In just five days the website has got a million hits and the net and some tabloids are buzzing with the news of a
“You like women?!” Sherlock made a face at Jim as they had their morning tea and sandwiches and strips of crispy bacon on the terraced garden of the latter’s house, “I’d have sooner imagined you doing something violent like….. castrating yourself. You actually went snooping on them at ole’ Hudders’ house?!?!?”
Basically he wanted to give both of them a chance to back off. If only he knew how difficult it would be to not contact John, to ignore the thoughts that came into his mind constantly and distracted him from doing his work properly.
“Very happy to meet you doctor Watson,” she said, shaking his hand firmly, her grip strong and her hands a bit rough, “Sherlock told me he vouches for you and knows you very well; therefore I won’t bother with a background check and waste any time. If Sherlock is fine sharing this flat with you, then so am I. I live in the opposite flat, by the way. I also own the basement space where I run cooking, baking and dance classes. The rest of the flats are owned by different people while the convenience store and the café are owned by……” she paused and added with a dose of extra affection, “By Mr. Partha Chatterjee.”
“Wasn’t that supposed to happen inside me?” Sherlock asked, hips moving in pumping motions as he tried to grind himself against the sheets beneath.
There was something about that filthy tongue and the way those words were said that made John’s cock twitch back to life again. Smiling evilly he whispered close to Sherlock’s ear, “The second thing has already happened. My refractory system, which was five minutes, is now reduced to an enviable two minutes. How does this feel?”
He saw the faces of two young men and a woman, one of them was Sherlock. The other man was older than him but not much and had straight long chestnut hair which he wore in a ponytail. The woman was blond like him and looked very similar to him, same smile and nose.
John nodded, “Yes of course, what else did you think it was…..” but before he could finish, he heard Robert Royce calling out to him. A bright and perky Molly whispered ‘good-luck’ before skipping down the hallway, as if she had just won a lottery. Confused and a bit amused by this experience, John went back into the room. This time he saw Benjamin Johnson, Julia’s boss and the overall Human Resource Lead, sitting there. Over the next ten minutes he agreed to all of John’s terms and conditions, albeit haltingly and with loads of ‘if’s’ and ‘but’s’. Finally he gave John a fresh offer and put forward one condition. John was asked to sign a watertight two-year clause of non-separation, a violation of which came with a hefty penalty. John grinned inwardly and happily agreed to sign on the dotted line.
“I am not the detective, I am only his assistant or co-investigator,” he would correct her each time while deferring the introductions between her and Sherlock.
Sherlock looked sheepish and scratched behind his right ear, something he only did when he was not in a position to smart talk his way out of a situation. “Pemmican is
She nodded as they came to a clearing in the woods and saw a beautiful rock formation. “An inland water and rock formation!!! How come we never saw this while doing that boat ride around the lake yesterday?” She asked, eyes wondrous, “This place is too beautiful for words Reddy, no one will believe us unless we take some photos! This should grace the covers of a National Geographic magazine. It’s truly very beautiful and very……”
The two blond men stepped inside. It was all normal again, no noise or cacophony anymore. The cashier called out, “Hi, you came here day before yesterday early morning, didn’t ya?”
John began to move his hips back and forth and felt Sherlock’s teeth sink into his shoulder as he lay down completely over his spread eagled torso. Breathing in his scent and the combined whiff of their hormones and cologne, John kept thrusting at a steady pace, groaning deeply.
John gave Sherlock a quizzical look, “Were you expecting someone?” Then he turned towards the door and called out again, “Gretel, come in but stay in the anteroom please.”
“I don’t think I should be here,” Sherlock murmured, “This room holds beyond imagination perhaps. And I feel like an intruder, standing here and looking at the family heirlooms.”
Though he was bandaged, treated, given the usual shots to prevent pain and infection and had a nice fourteen hour nap, Sherlock still felt tired and listless. Waking up to find John already out for lunch was not expected. He thought at least for a day or two John will be around him.
Harry went to the bathroom and ran the water in the tub before he went back to the bedroom to fetch his towel and robe. This was one of the only two luxuries he always indulged in on a daily basis, one was reading and watching television before bedtime for a couple of hours and the other was soaking in a warm bath for half an hour, come rain or sunshine, storm or hail. It relaxed him and he loved that time, especially if there was a glass of his favorite red wine or some fine sherry at hand.
Sherlock was standing in the conservatory on the left wing of the large mansion, a beautiful glass structure with a glass roof and pure glass on three sides. There was a herb garden, several sweet smelling flowers and utilitarian plants like aloe-vera. On one corner was a seating arrangement for up to eight people, for breakfast. The hour was 4-30 pm so some really flavorful Darjeeling Lopchu Golden Orange Pekoe tea had been served and snacks were laid out on the table beside it, sandwiches, scones etc. But the youngest sibling had no eyes or appetite for any of it. He simply harked out morosely into their spacious garden, beyond which was the twelve-foot wall and beyond that the orchards they owned. Eurus looked at Mycroft and rolled her eyes with a ‘I know, right?’ kind of smile. Mycroft frowned but didn’t say anything immediately. When his sister looked at him again and insisted that he take the brat to task, he simply mouthed ‘Ignore’.
He had said this with genuine sincerity and he meant every word he had said. As a hired bridegroom his purpose was to put up an act, not expect that act to become a part of reality. But he would be lying if he said he didn’t have at least a faint ray of hope that maybe sometime in the future this would become the truth. John would indeed propose to him. “Why would I make up an excuse babykins,” John nuzzled the side of his face and washed his back and shoulders with a soft and wet washcloth, “I am sorry, maybe I wasn’t clear enough. But you must understand Sherlock that whatever I said to her and Eliza this afternoon was the absolute truth. There was no fabrication in it.”
He came so hard he almost blacked out while John felt his hand suddenly covered with his lover’s seed. With a smirk he brought his hand to his mouth and licked.
They went out to the terraced garden on the first floor of the house. Sherlock lit a cigarette and offered one to Mary who hesitantly accepted and said ‘One won’t be bad’ as her host held the lighter for her. Blowing out puffs of smoke she said, “That was a nasty, ill-timed comment.”
“Don’t lose heart mate,” Mike said cheerfully when John called him, “Go check out the house, I mean the flat Sherlock talked about. I am sure all is not lost yet. They will contact you by tomorrow morning, that’s what they said, right? So you still have a chance. Maybe they need to confer and discuss, take a collective call. If it was an outright ‘no’, then believe you me I would have received a call by now.”
This would be the seventh year. And Sherlock suddenly felt he should be blamed if John had found someone else to spend it with. After all, anyone was entitled to give up after being ignored or passed over or simply dismissed for six years.
Sherlock put his feet up on the low stool before him, then saw his mummy make a face and quickly put them down. “It’s okay,” she said with a smile, “Go ahead, do that if you want. As long as you don’t put them up on the breakfast or dining table.”
The bed shook gently, just like the gentle breeze that blew across the room, Sherlock’s eyes kept tearing up and droplets rolled down the side of his face as he wrapped his arms and legs around his lover, wishing he could just disappear somehow into John.
Sherlock spoke with more confidence than he felt inside. “Absolutely we could. I know my mummy is on my side and she can convince daddy and Myc. She is the one who helped me talk to Greg and come over here, clear the air and reconcile with you. I will speak with her today so I can take her counsel on this. If she says it’s too soon then I will go back tomorrow morning John. Please don’t mind me doing that.”
John seemed somewhat unsure. He looked at the three bags full and then in the direction of them spacious kitchen and scratched his chin. “You know dear Sherl, it’s good that you wanna help but you’d put things where they don’t belong and I won’t find them later when I need them so…..” he paused when he saw Sherlock’s stricken expression and quickly changed his tune, smiling broadly and affectionately, “But it would be really nice to do this together. It saves time and it also feels great sharing chores and errands. Also, one more thing, I have to attend on an emergency surgery and I will be off this evening. Hope you hadn’t made any plans really.”
“A gentleman here to see you sir. I haven’t given him entry into the building yet. Says he has some work with you. His name is Seamus Murtagh.”
When he got back into the room he found that John had quickly gone through his mails for the past month and answered all the urgent ones. But the moment he saw Sherlock he grabbed the youngster and pulled him down on the bed, kissing him deep and lovingly on his mouth. Sherlock willingly and willfully surrendered, threading his fingers through John’s hairs as he returned the kiss with all his pent-up passion. His erection pressed up against John’s abs and John’s erection rubbed against his thigh, showing how aroused they were, their wet kiss only adding fuel to the fiery needs that coursed through them. Still, as Sherlock grabbed John’s hand and guided it between his legs, he sensed the hesitation in that touch. Unwilling to back off, Sherlock reached behind John and grabbed his hung balls, cupping the testicles in his palms, rolling them and giving them a good squeeze.
“He ran away. Or rather, he went away for some reason. That was a couple of days ago, early in the morning around dawn. Even the inspector here, Charles, he could not find out where he was. Seemed like all hopes were lost and he wouldn’t be seen again. Sherlock was in London so it was all kept very much a hush-hush affair…..”
The other man had fallen with his bag and briefcase too so there was nothing for him there. Scared out of his mind at how a simple mugging had resulted in the loss of his accomplice and a possible murder, he ran from there as fast as he could.
“I don’t need to think through it sir,” Robert said, sounding quite agitated and excited, “I won’t forget this man for a simple reason – He was so rude and he was ghastly with our then receptionist. He had come into the studio brandishing a photograph and asked us who had worked on that photo or rather….
“You come along too,” Sherlock took the next best option, suggesting they both go together, “Why would you take the train ride alone?”
As the door closed behind them, Greg lowered his voice and asked, “I saw a ring on Sherlock’s finger or was that a mistake?”
Sherlock ambled out of the bathroom, holding a razor. He was half way through a shave and had evidently taken a bath moments ago because his skin was flushed and moist from the hot shower. Had it not been for the pressures of hosting a party, John would have jumped him right then. “Hey,” he said, “I got two packs of beer, twelve each. I also got four bottles of wine, two red and two white. Is that good?”
“What? Speak up! Don’t whisper like a girl. Come on, what were you trying to say? Sherrrlyyy, I don’t have all day!!”
That’s it! Sherlock Holmes always rises to a challenge and conquers it. If a man of average height and intelligence as John can do this then so can I. Actually if my no-good brother can do it then why can’t I? If Jim Moriarty can do this then why can’t I?
Eckhart’s voice was tight. He seemed uncomfortable. He didn’t seem like his usual self, where he was cordial and polite and professional but also very warm and sensitive. It seemed as if he would rather not be doing this, not be talking to Sherlock about this. “Eckhart what is wrong?”
She thought she heard something on the roof. Then something landed with a thump on the patio at the back. “Darn,” she exclaimed, “I have got fresh milk from the store and the cats have smelled it. They’re already fighting. I better close the kitchen door before they come straight in and create a complete mess on the floor or……”
Not wanting to alarm himself but at the same time not sure he should ignore Sherlock’s insistent warnings, John sat up, rubbing his eyes and looking around. A huge yawn split his face nearly and he looked in the direction of the door. “I don’t hear anything now. Anyways, let me go and check. We had locked the door and no one else will really go in….. apart from you and me…..” He yawned again, a smile coming on to his face as he got up to get into his clothes. Memories of their coupling and the sight of his lover’s naked, white, long limbs was making him hard all over again, oh dear, he had no idea how much of a horndog he could be until Sherlock had walked into his life.
Again a thought came back to him. Does this make me gay? His brain answered with a thundering ‘NO’. He had just slipped for a night, that made him what…..experimental? But he was NOT gay.
,” he said as he binned the various paper cups, plates, disposable spoons and other items strewn around the kitchen and sitting room into a large garbage bag, “You threw a remarkable dinner party and only cooked the rice!”
“How many times have I told you that if you’re gonna be a slut, then be a vocal one at least. Tell me in words what you need from me or else you’re getting nothing.”
John was glad he had dropped one of the brochures and was about to bend to pick it up, because that gave him an opportunity to hide his look from her, an expression of horror mixed with apprehension.
That left us with Irene who was so antagonistic and apathetic towards the boys that we were afraid she would be the whistle blower. In our full blown senses we couldn’t plan a murder, that was beyond us. And from the way Sherlock and Jim shuddered to even hear about planning a murder (
“I am not really keen to get into a relationship. Actually, I like it the way things are right now. I mean, he must be enjoying the thrill of the chase and I am quite enjoying the attention from him, even if he seems awkward and downright funny at times. Last month the doors closed on his face as he followed me out, too busy gawping at me to notice the doors were about to shut. Only the other day he tripped and almost fell on an elderly lady because he was focusing so much on me and didn’t realize he was standing on someone else’s foot!”
“Why?” Roger asked casually, “What’s wrong with a little surprise now and then? Technically I didn’t tell you there’s anything wrong with either of us. I just said you’re really needed here. The definition of an urgency depends on the person talking about it. Aren’t you happy it turned out to be a good surprise rather than a nasty one?!?”
“What happened afterwards?” Phil asked, “Think of anything else he said, please try.” Robert thought for a few moments. “Three others came to the scene and stopped him from causing further chaos as he attempted to kick me when I was down. Told him to leave or they’d call the police. That did the trick and he reluctantly left but not before he said he would ruin anyone who had ruined his sister. We thought it might have been a case of mistaken identity Apparently he was hovering outside the shop for a while after that.”
“Very well sir, good to see you here sir,” the blond young waiter said with a practiced smile. But he secretly rolled his eyes. While this customer was a regular one and often brought company and business with him too, he took most of the advantages out the other side by asking for discounts or demanding last minute reservations. The pompous prick always acted as if he owned this place but was notoriously miserly when it came to leaving tips.
He distinctly remembered Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson. He also remembered a doctor they knew well, a woman in her early seventies who happened to be their father’s friend and their family physician. He remembered being fed something, being given a shot, someone saying, ‘There’s nothing that you should be worried about’ and someone else saying ‘If I had a way I’d teach him a lesson’ and finally Mrs. Hudson shaking her head and murmuring ‘You should have never done this to your family’.
“The owner of a luxury hotel in Cardiff, one in Liverpool and another one in Belfast, the CEO of one of the top five online travel portals in the world, a man with a fortune far greater than even Sherlock’s, a former army man no less and with an impeccable record of service and conduct, this is no criminal. But he did try to kill Sherlock and probably kidnapped a child and hacked a security system, blackmailed a man and tied him up, possibly slew a thug as well and murdered an aging canine. It just does not add up. If the target is Sherlock then what did Sherlock do to deserve this wrath? He is the kindest, most generous and gentlemanly person we know, prone to be generous to a fault sometimes. But not criminal or cruel – that’s just not my Sherlock.”
“No I won’t call it cheese nor will I laugh at you,” Jim concluded, “Because at some point that’s how Sherlock had loved me. When I chose Seb and he walked away gracefully, I was overjoyed to have my man but also…. Regretful that I didn’t have a clone of myself who’d be with Sherlock. We have a connection even today, I feel it. Maybe this will be my way to return the favor to my old flame.”
“I think that is something they’ve guessed already,” John said with a pleased smile, “From Mary to Mike to Elizabeth, everyone has been telling me I look a lot more relaxed and happy lately. I seem to have more empathy and patience, I have taken more risks and followed new paths and ideas. Basically they’re all saying they like the new ‘me’ a lot more than the older one. Even in terms of profits and success, things have been looking up for me ever since you came in.”
“No, he just told me you were coming home with a gift for me, for us, and if I did this then it would be the best sex ever?”
The humor helped and she left soon, giving John the window of opportunity to have a heart to heart with Sherlock. He sat him down, though he could feel the tension just ooze off Sherlock’s back and his shoulders like honey off a spoon. “Deep breaths, focus on my voice, give me just a few minutes of patient listening, please,” John said, kneeling between Sherlock’s long legs as the detective sat spread eagled on his (formerly John’s) chair.
Sebastian looked at Sherlock with fire in his eyes. He pointed his pistol right between Sherlock’s eyes and thundered at the sleuth. “Tell me the truth detective, what exactly is the deal here? If you lie I will know and I will make a third eye on your forehead.”
He stood there, half way between the area leading towards John’s study and the library on the other side, unsure of what to do or what to say. For the first time in a little over three months he wasn’t even sure of his welcome in this house. Eckhart stood right behind him, like a sentry, guarding his routes. It hurt Sherlock to think that he was being treated like a thief or some intruder, as if he’d escape into parts of the house and touch objects that should be inaccessible to him. He tried to read John’s face but it was stony and stoic, there was nothing he could figure out from that visage. But one thing he was sure. John’s feelings for him had changed and it was definitely not for the better.
The two thugs were waiting there for some unlucky soul to fall in their trap. Soon they spotted a man, clutching a briefcase in his hands and a bag over his shoulder, walking across the bridge in a bulky raincoat and a cap that covered more than half of his face. He wore galoshes and one could hardly make out his age, build or identity. It was impossible to find out if he was a tramp or a gentleman and that was the concern that one of the thugs had. He turned to his accomplice and asked, “Tom, I don’t think he is even rich enough for us to risk this. We don’t know shit.”
was in fact the one issuing death threats to her husband with her lover’s cooperation. They had to leave in a hurry and the purchase never happened.
Sherlock couldn’t even say the words ‘This isn’t about the money, this is about us, this is about how deeply I am in love with you’. His blood had run cold, his eyes stung with unshed tears, his hands shook at his side and he had to clasp them together to steady them.
When John walked into the office, the receptionist gave him a nod and smile. John stopped and gave her a meaningful look, “Do you have something in your mouth? Were you eating something?” “No, nothing like that Mr. Watson.” “In that case, speak up and wish people ‘good morning’. You are the first face people see when they step in so you need to behave like a brand ambassador for us. Anyone can sit there with a grumpy face and an indifferent body language. You’re here because you can do better.”
Mary was about to say something when John’s phone started to buzz. The moment John saw Sherlock’s call coming in, he grabbed the phone like one would grab a lifeboat the moment they felt their ship was about to sink. A smile spreading on his lips at the possibility of some juice case, he answered the other man eagerly. “Hey Sherl, yes, no of course not, yes, yes, oh is it? Hmmm, well, I suppose I can pick it up. No, I am in fact close to where he lives, no, not the car showroom. Yes, she is here. do you want to speak with her……” Suddenly John stopped, realizing how their situation had flipped on its head, “Um….she is busy, I think it’s best if I just go and pick that file up. Yes, of course, sure.”
A mere confirmation, short and curt and pointedly defiant. Sherlock snorted and walked to the bedroom, kicking off his shoes somewhere in the hallway and leaving his coat and scarf somewhere on a couch or a chair. Vintage Jim! Original Jim! If Sherlock went sociopathic on everyone around him and they couldn’t return the favor, Jim took revenge on behalf of all of them by going double-socio on him from time to time. While Sherlock was sure Jim wouldn’t steal his credit nor market the pill like he was planning to, he was not very happy about Jim taking samples without discussing with him. He would have gladly given Jim a small bottle full of pills if he had only asked!
“Plenty well, better than usual I’d say,” John was smiling a bit too wide and she noticed that, giving him a curious smile. Instantly John put his guard up and said, “Is he in a position to talk to me? Will she do that? Or I can come back later.” Elizabeth nodded and took his arm in a gesture of guidance, “She’s enjoying a rare sit-out on the balcony today, thanks to the excellent weather we have. Let me check the schedule, yeah she’s free at this moment, no shots, treatment, food or change of clothes planned for the next two hours. Even I am going out for a while so it’s good you dropped by. Come along, I’ll take you to her and then take your leave.”
“It is they who have done everything that’s gone wrong so far, maybe even the three murders three years ago. It has always been them. They are the ones who have orchestrated it all, planning in human form and executing in animal form. Your growling, snarling animal was no one else but your own brother Mr. Holmes and I am sure James is also very similar and capable of shapeshifting.”
Long used to crowded streets, the din and bustle of city life and the forever twinkling lights of a metropolitan area, Sherlock found the place very disconcerting and boring. He had walked out of the property and was strolling by the lake, having easily covered a mile on his bicycle and then half a mile on foot, and he hadn’t met anyone aside from a tramp who lived in the woods by the lake. He was walking across the bridge on the lake, whistling and obviously drunk.
Sherlock groaned with pure pleasure when John pulled him flush against himself and the younger man’s clothed erection touched the blonde’s taut abs. Instantly Sherlock began to hump him, eager to relieve some pressure there.
“Next week I will be going to Istanbul,” Mary said in an excited voice, her eyes shining with joy, “To be with my beau. He used to work in one of the companies where John was a primary investor. Then John set him up in his own business and he’s doing pretty well. He not only paid back the principle amount he took as loan from John but also a decent interest. Currently his assignment is in Istanbul, Turkey, and he wants me to join him there. Since it’s a second marriage for me as well as him, he had been married earlier and has two grown kids after all, we will do a quiet wedding and honeymoon in Greece. Yeah, that’s the plan. I will be back in about six to seven months.”
Sherlock had fallen asleep almost immediately. As the evening proceeded towards the early stages of the night, the soreness and pain from injuries often flared up so John was pretty pleased he had managed to pack Sherlock off to bed by 8 PM. The events of the day, whatever he could imagine through the account Sherlock had given him so far, kept coming back to him again and again and he decided to go out for a walk, to clear his head.
“Julia, do you see that? It’s a speedboat and it’s moored around the opening of the cave!!! That means there are people down there, that means we can go inside too. You can actually follow the water and go right into the cave and take some pics. It will be gorgeous and who knows, maybe we can continue where we left off. It won’t be the same as doing it out in the open but I suppose it shall still count as ‘Outdoor sex’, right?”
When he opened the door, he found Sherlock talking to a client. He was initially a bit offended that Sherlock was entertaining a client without informing him, he could have certainly given him a call, but he wasn’t the kind to create a scene around others so he calmly perched on an ottoman and listened to the tail end of the chat. It was a beautiful woman in love with another woman and ever since she had disclosed so to her tyrant of an elder brother, she feared he was trying to get rid of her in order to ‘save face’ with family and friends. She had found her car brakes removed one morning and narrowly avoided an accident. Another time she had dropped her ice cream and the cat that licked it up died soon after. Two days ago she had found her balcony bannister broken deliberately and saved herself at the nick of time by grabbing a chair and arresting a fall on to the lawns below.
“Absolutely not, you are right,” Mycroft said without a hint of a hesitation, “A broken leg or twisted ankle would have been punishment enough for his little mistake, not this, not death, and definitely not such a violent and alarming death. Now I feel so terrible, the way I told you they can surely look after themselves and we should carry on with out work. That was terrible of me, a most irresponsible thing to do!” Greg covered his hand with his own, pressing down reassuringly, “Myc relax, if anyone is to blame it’s me. I should have never allowed them to join us. Honestly I was not expecting to ‘actually’ find something.”
“In our family, we want anyone who steps into it by way of marriage or relationships, to feel equal and solvent, to feel a part of the family fortunes and have enough to be independently wealthy. In today’s world of prenups it seems like a crazy idea but by now you know I am a bit old fashioned that way. I believe that if you love someone, you trust them. And you have earned my trust and love.”
“You must be out of your mind,” Molly looked at Irene, shocked out of her five senses, “You want to go back to that bloody town and village which nearly cost Anthea her life. She is safe now but at what cost, her entire face is disfigured. She needs to go through six surgeries to even look remotely similar to her former self.”
“Nope,” Jim stood at the doorway, clad in exactly the same combination of clothes as Mycroft, “He is fine. He was snooping around there, pretending to be a druggie. But get him out of those borrowed clothes of some homeless bastard. They stink so bad, he stank up the whole car.”
John’s cry was very robust and high pitched and perhaps that was what triggered Sherlock’s orgasm. Seeing the veritably quiet and controlled John lose it like that was the straw that broke his controls. Several choked and strangled cries left him as he came all over John’s hand and his clothes, five streaks of creamy milk shooting out of his throbbing, erupting dick which John stroked through his lover’s orgasm. At one point Sherlock was over-sensitive down there and squirmed and shuddered, at which point John let it go, fingers trailing down to the place where they were joined. Warm semen had already started to trickle out of Sherlock’s hole even though John was still buried deep in there.
John smiled and waited, knowing fully well Mycroft would speak if he wished and not if he was pushed. His ploy worked, as did his silence, and Mycroft slipped into a comfort zone where he lit a cigarette and cocked an eyebrow at the doctor. “I suppose you’re dying to know how it started and how did it even happen,” he took a deep drag and leaned against the tree-trunk, “Custody John, it started when he literally turned himself in and I kept him in custody for six weeks. First week we tried to break his spirit and I saw his magnificent side, a side which was so indestructible that I wondered what he was made of. The second week I acted as the pacifier, soothing and fluffing him, trying to coax information out of him. He tricked me, the sneaky sexy little bastard.”
Soon they set up the laptop and while Jim remained away from the camera, Greg sat before it and interrogated the scared man who appeared on the screen, flanked by two cops one of which was their chief contact Liam. The man revealed a few things and then Liam showed a few items that were found on Bill, all of which were enough to get Greg on the edge of his seat and Jim to stare at him in dismay. What was earlier a hunch was now a complete confirmation. It was indeed John who had been ambushed by Bill and Tom and one of John’s items, his hip-pouch-bag, was in his possession and also contained John’s drivers’ license. From the spot they had seen John to the place he was found the next day, injured and amnesiac, the suspicion now grew stronger on John being the slayer.
“See, he is so useful,” Jim giggled, patting Sebastian on his arm, “He was standing guard for us and keeping an eye on the surroundings. So, as you were saying you don’t know Sebby, well I know him and I believe that’s enough. You trust me, don’t you?” When Sherlock nodded slowly Jim stood on tiptoes and gave him a peck on his lips. Sherlock automatically leaned forward but Jim pulled back swiftly and scoffed, “You want more, you must do this for us. Pick up something that he won’t miss, won’t even know is missing, and just get out of that place. Remember, he’s only paying you to be his partner, he doesn’t really want to put a ring on you. Don’t get emotionally invested in that man!”
The men whom Irene had brought along. Two were dead but four had escaped. We had got rid of the two bodies in the house, collecting the pieces together and holding back the bile that rose from our stomachs and up our throats. But the ones that got away……
, the item he held in his hands was so awesome that John found himself smiling as he looked at it. His eyes met Eugenia’s, and he noticed that she had the same greenish blue eyes Sherlock had, and found the old woman smiling fondly at him. “You like the gifts Dr. Watson?”
With some roughshod movements, grunts, growls, hands grabbing, fingers probing, mouths clashing with abundance, John managed to prepare Sherlock while he got his pants open mid-thigh and freed his cock. Then he pulled Sherlock right on top, parting his butt cheeks and lowering him on the thick phallus. Despite their earlier tryst that day and John slathering a huge amount of lube on himself, it was still quite an effort for the younger man to accommodate his girth. The look of pain and agony on Sherlock’s face almost made him call this off but soon he felt immense tightness surround his cock and Sherlock’s features relaxed and contorted with pleasure, and the doctor sighed with relief.
“You are beautiful in a way that’s difficult to comprehend, you’re sexier than the word itself, Sherlock what have you done to me darling! I am a crazy man each time I see you, because all I want is to make you mine. Only mine.”
He had crossed the woods, gone past the ‘Peace Hill’ where the town cemetery stood and was now standing before a rather quaint-looking church with an equally pretty and landscaped grounds. It was not a very big church, probably could accommodate not more than a hundred to hundred and twenty parishioners, but something about the place made him
“I-I have another suit for you,” John said, scratching the back of his head. It was a hard habit to kick, especially when one was truly sheepish and lost, when one was back to being the unsure young man who wanted to impress his mate but didn’t know how.
As the sounds of wrapping papers scrunching and being balled up, torn etc traveled across the room, the mothers came inside smiling at their kids. Sherlock’s mummy patted his head and whispered, “I always tell you to eat your fill at the table. But you don’t. But I was impressed by the way you warmed up the bangers and mash and ate it as a midnight snack. You even cleaned the plate and kept it by the sink, bravo!”
“Me too and for the better,” John chuckled, taking in deep breaths of fresh air into his lungs, “If this is indeed a spell and I have been bewitched then I am all for it. Keep the magic coming, I say, just keep it coming to me.”
Sherlock thought for some time and yawned widely. “Yeah, I am tired and I haven’t eaten anything since breakfast so…. Whoa!”
Kneeing Sherlock’s long legs apart, he pushed a pillow underneath his pert bottom and aligned his cock to the quivering opening. It shone with lube, the soft skin begging for a kiss. The older man contemplated that for a moment, but his inner voice strongly objected.
John had no idea what got into him but over the next minute he not only killed the psycho but chopped him into pieces in a mad frenzy, the blade of the axe colored crimson by blood. “You wanna kill my friend eh?” He shouted, his voice hoarse from screaming, “Well no, not in my watch. You will never kill another innocent soul again you motherfucking amoeba, this will be the end of you useless bag of bones and marrow.”
Later that evening John came home looking scared. I told him I wasn’t angry for him being late. He gave me a helpless glance and a watery smile. I told him I could get him something and he jumped three feet from his chair. Then, when he saw it was a can of beer he sighed loudly and smiled and said, “Oh something which isn’t cooked. Yeah, bring it on, come and sit on my lap baby.”
“Basement,” Mrs. Hudson said, “Except for me, I stay in a first floor bedroom. Kitchen, pantry, staff quarters and a staff sitting room/entertainment room is the basement. You want to see?”
Sherlock felt a strange sense of despondency and sadness as the journey progressed. Without realizing it, he had become addicted to the idea of John being around. Even when they weren’t speaking to one another, he was happy just to know that the blond man was somewhere close by and watching him. Now he felt so…..
“No, no, no,” Sherlock hugged John who clung back to him for dear life, the blond man kissing the side of his face and his long neck in desperation and delight, “I love you Jawn, I love you, I forgive you. I did wrong you, whether it was out of stupidity or naïveté or not, but the result was sheer grief and disaster for you, I acknowledge that. I am responsible for that. But I do wish you had given me a chance to explain. You pushed me away at a time you needed me the most, ironically. I missed you, I missed you so much, time and again I thought of contacting you but then I never got around doing that….”
She heard a crashing noise and the sounds of glass breaking and then the sound of her bed breaking too. Or maybe it was half broken but definitely some wood cracked. No, this could not be one of the two cats she owned. Some time ago she had heard her mastiff barking. But Coco was not barking any longer. That was strange. If there was an intruder she would be bringing the house down with her barking. She had been trained pretty well by a young boy she knew, someone who trained dogs to support senior citizens. Her heart thumping loud in her ears now, she grabbed an axe and armed herself with a taser gun as well, just in case. There were no valuables in the house nowadays, she had given them off to her children and grandkids, so the thief would find nothing but her, only her, and take out their ire on her perhaps.
. “Won’t you miss me? Did you ever love me? You’re just throwing me out like a stray! I thought we shared a lot more than just…. That you will believe me when…..”
When the man looked but in a casual, dismissive manner, the lady officer used a harsher tone. “Ask your staff, I am sure someone will remember,” Sally said sternly, “This is a murder case we are investigating so don’t take it lightly.” Greg stood in the background with a sullen expression on his face. “Cheer up boss we will get to the bottom of this,” Phil said, “I am sure someone will remember him. He has three assistants and a data operator, an accountant as well as a receptionist. Someone would have had a proper interaction with him.”
“You did? But why sir, if I may ask! Do you have any feedback on my work? I know I have missed a few minutes here and there but I always ensured my backup was there and made it up by working some extra hours later……”
John shook his head resolutely, deciding not to let his guard down, “I feel just as weirded out by what I just did but I’d be damned if we don’t take the step we’ve discussed and debated all night about. People have been dying Seb, we can surely take a couple of days off romancing and enjoying ourselves and take a proper step towards….. I don’t know what it will be but I need to be sure. And I know for a fact that you need to be sure too. Don’t you want to be able to sleep easy at night knowing our men are normal, that we can spend a lifetime with them without regrets???”
“N-No, this is my first one…. My very first vehicle. My father had a farm…. Homestead, farmlands, he and my mother owned…. Farm machinery. I-I have only seen tractors, diggers and forklift trucks actually.”
He went to the address, which was in a quiet and cobbled street that branched off the busy and bustling Les Halles area. Only a hundred meters inside, the noise of the main roads, the shoppers and traffic had faded away into a distant din. The narrow lane, which was mainly useful for pedestrians and could be used by a single vehicle at one time, widened out into a sort of a cul-de-sac area which had three properties around it. One was high-rise apartment building. The other was a huge bungalow with a long driveway, post which its acreage started. The third and central one was an old-fashioned Parisian house, occupying five floors, with a quaint courtyard and arched doorway.
Sherlock gasped, “Ohhh…. No, I want to feel you inside…. Make me feel you for days. Jawn, please listen to me, just your cock…!!”
“No, how should I know that?” Mrs. Hudson asked when she got him and John their dinner, “Our lot never knew Valentine’s Day at all. It’s a way for commercial establishments to make money nowadays. Truth be told, every day is Valentine’s Day for someone in love.”
“Maybe he thought he still had a chance and in case John and you broke up he’d step in. Sometimes engagements don’t last or don’t get converted to a wedding. But John and you remained in love and took things to the altar, thereafter he realized he can never change this reality! This ring is a bit more permanent so he’s got whacked in the head and heart heh!!”
“Tom, Tom, where are you, oh goodness, he can’t swim, oh no….. no, no, no, I am not going to get convicted for murder. No way.”
“That day….that evening rather, when I got injured during the case, you were out on a date with that female, Cassie….yeah, what happened with her? You had to cut it short, I know, but you never mentioned her again nor did you go out on a date with her since.”
The group stared at each other, each one remembering the incident with the strange cat creature they had mowed down that afternoon.
“What?” She began to giggle, turning to look at the two men again. They made quite a pair, one was short and slender and very attractive, but in an odd and unconventional way. With dark hair and shining onyx eyes, Jim was suave and debonair in his Westwood and Rolex, his hair immaculately coifed and his skin glowing with vitality. Sebastian Moran was a tall hunk of a man with alpha poster-boy looks. Blond, blue-eyed and muscular, he towered over Jim in build just as Jim towered over him in persona and presence. “They are giving up crime or is Mycroft giving up his work and position?” Mary asked, inquisitive, “What does Sherlock think about it? It must be quite a lot to take in, no?”
John remembered moments from the past that made goosebumps rise to his flesh even now. Memories he had long buried but which he could suddenly see and experience again, thanks to Sherlock’s comment that had opened up a portal to his earlier days. His mum, smiling and loving and cheerful, the same day she died she had knitted him a really nice Christmas jumper, the Sunday roasts she used to cook, his elder sister Harriet and he setting the table under the cabana outside while their mum brought in the dishes, wine and mocktails. “When people pass away suddenly and unexpectedly, way before they have lived their lives,” he murmured, head bowed, “It’s really painful to even bring up those mentions, memories…..”
“No problem,” Greg replied, sitting on an ottoman and sipping his tea, “If you’ve something to tell me then by all means please do, I am all ears.” Jim did take a bit more time but when he spoke, he came directly to the point. “I got to know about your visit last afternoon at our place. My husband told me about it. Last night I thought about this, a lot, and finally decided to meet you and give you some inputs that might come in handy for this case. But I didn’t want to involve Tiger… I mean Sebastian in this. I have something to hide there, to be honest. He doesn’t know about my earlier affair with ….. wait a moment, what’s that photo doing there?”
Greg was about to say something when Edgar called out, “I see someone down there. Mr. Holmes, Chief, I do see someone, it seems they are in distress.”
Von Dyke nodded and paused briefly as his great granddaughter and his sister re-entered the room, bringing with them a trolley which was filled with teacups, plates of biscuits and a plate of pastries. He waited until they had left before he spoke again, “I know because once one of them cursed was my own brother. He was younger to even Mary, my sister who just served.”
Deciding not to be bogged down, Mycroft continued the search for the animal in question without his able partner. But, despite the best efforts from his own team and himself, plus a couple of volunteers he had summoned from town, they couldn’t find a single hint or clue anywhere as to where the predator had come from.
Annoyed at the delay the assailant swiftly moved to the other side of the bed. This time he didn’t wait, he simply raised his arm again and this time brought the weapon down on the unfortunate woman with all his might. He targeted the right spot and the sharp and shining blade went right through her, inflicting enough damage to pierce her lung and heart and kill her near instantly.
Their secret was never revealed, never discussed. Irene was not fired. We continued to work the way we were working before. We knew Jim and Sherlock would have wanted it to happen that way.
“Ah,” Sherlock threw his head back in ecstasy, exposing his long neck. John’s teeth sank in at one side, a little above the collarbone, a bit below the jawline. He began to bounce on John’s dick, holding on to John’s shoulders, his long legs spread wide.
“I came for the file,” John said, not answering the question. Some questions didn’t merit an answer. Mycroft should know why he was so wary of looking at him. “What is in the file by the way?” He couldn’t help but ask as he got a physical file and a USB key.
He saw a bit more movement and then a shadow went to the steps which led towards the bank of the lake. Why would anyone want to go that way at night? Of all those who lived there, including the three families and their helps and employees, none was a newcomer who had no clue about the dangers lurking at night. Of course the banks of the lake that side was like their ‘private’ beach and jetty and no accident had ever taken place there, still they avoided a nocturnal stroll, for fear of someone stumbling or tripping and hurting themselves.
“Ohhhh,” Sherlock moaned loudly as he felt John dry hump him, rubbing their erections insistently together. “Fuck,” John closed his eyes and sped up, “I really need to…..we need to, just hold on to me.”
Mycroft got up and walked up the stairs to the floor where John earlier had his room. That room had now been converted into Sherlock’s laboratory and John knew Mycroft had no interest in that messy place. This was merely a way to avoid a further question from Greg.
John kept meeting Mary on the side, though they didn’t really go beyond an affectionate kiss or a hug. The sexual side of their relationship had faded away, much to John’s shame and consternation. He knew sooner or later he would have to answer his lady.
Only the previous time she had seen him he had a head attached. Now that was gone and his corpse was hanging upside down from a low branch of the tree she was standing under, blood dripping from the open wound at the neck.
“Oh, just ask him if the bomb detonated through those sounds?” Sherlock asked as if it was the most natural thing to do. When John threw a murderous glance at the detective, he quickly backtracked in his Sherlock-esque manner, “Okay, do not ask him that then.”
First he let him soak in a hot bath, then scrubbed him clean. Finally he cut his hair and gave him a shave. John brushed his teeth twice and gargled once with some minty fluid to get rid of any foul or alcohol laced breath, if any.
“Oh, Irish. Your father’s side does have Irish ancestry, I think from his grandmother’s side. Does he speak Gaelic as well?”
“I dried the meat…no, I first sliced the meat really thin, no actually Jim did that for me when he came here. Then I put it in a dehydrator. When it became brittle and just broke into two like a cracker I powdered it. Then I rendered the fat…actually, I got the neighborhood kid Alan to get that done by his mum. She is my fan and gladly did that in exchange for one of my briefs…..”
“You know I haven’t cried since…. Since my nana died. I was sixteen then and cried my eyes out once we had returned from the funeral. Not even when my parents passed did I shed tears because…. Real men don’t cry, right? God, who the heck invented that phrase ‘real men’?” Sherlock wiped at his tears awkwardly, sniffling.
“I finished much earlier than I thought. Came back as soon as I could. I had texted you as soon as I landed here but you didn’t reply, so I thought I’ll surprise you by just showing up. Honestly, it’s only 9 am so I was expecting you to be fast asleep still and was hoping to sneak into bed and give you a real surprise…. Hehe, you know what I mean. I got a present for you love. Here, open it and take a look.”
“You like the room, the way I did it up?” Sherlock asked eagerly, breathless from the kiss, “I thought it would be nice to keep her memories alive, the good ones, the happy ones. Shutting them up in a trunk or chest only makes them toxic, makes them putrefy. This way it’s fresh, healing and beautiful.”
Updates have been slower because there's a lot to close before the holiday season starts. Please bear with me. Hope you're still reading and enjoying the story!
“You haven’t blown up half the fortune with gambles, risks and stubborn business ideas that failed spectacularly,” he said, trying to make it easier on the older man, “Instead you have grown the funds, you have maintained your ancestral properties, the wealth, the heirlooms pretty well. You’ve been a preserver.”
Michael paused and shouted out in distress, backing off quite a few steps and looking away. He went behind some bushes and started to retch and gag, throwing up violently. A bewildered Edgar tried to find out and accidentally kicked something with his foot. The thing bounced off the ground just like a ball and rolled to a stop near Greg Lestrade’s feet. As the police inspector stared at the object, his blood ran to his feet.
Before Sherlock could actually say something to ‘John the cat’, he saw another funny character. First he heard her voice, the sanctimonious tone easily identifiable. “Witless human, witless human,” someone chimed.
The dark figure entered the premises and reached the house in just six minutes. Carefully avoiding the camera at the front door, he went to the side of the house, right beneath the window he had trained his eyes on. Using very sophisticated equipment he lassoed himself against the sturdy branch of a tree and climbed up to the window level, then anchored himself to the edge of the parapet and swung over to the window like a monkey. He almost lost his foothold but managed to hold steady before an evil smile came on his lips. No need for a glass cutter, no need for a break-in, a window was slightly open.
“Well, where were you?” Phil didn’t seem to even realize his lies were showing, so was his stupidity, “Why didn’t you answer my calls?”
“I did not steal mummy,” Sherlock defended himself immediately, confident as ever in whatever he presented, making Mycroft chaff at the arrogant tone but he was yet to receive the shocker of his life. As Eugenia asked if Mycroft had allowed him to take the money, a nonchalant Sherlock replied, “No, he didn’t exactly give it to me. Why would he have to give it when I earned it? This is money he owes me and I took it as my own, it is in fact my money now.” He looked at an agitated Mycroft who was advancing on him like a taller, stronger elder sibling would do to make the younger one cower down. But it didn’t work this time with Sherlock.
Mary Morstan was a blond, slender, clever woman about the same age as John, thirty three. She was an office manager at a renowned dental and dermatology clinic located close to Barts. They had been introduced by one of the residents while both were lunching at a nearby café. Known for its celebrity clientele and high charges, its trained specialists who did Invisalign braces, Botox and facelifts like magicians, the clinic was a busy and popular one and Mary’s job was a well-paid and demanding one which Mary excelled at. She had just been promoted and John and she had decided to celebrate the occasion with a dinner, just before Christmas holidays started.
He literally jumped when John came out of the bathroom. In a comical twist, they both spoke at the very same time. “I think I’ll go in now.” “You can use the bathroom now.”
“A two nights and three days package at my nephew’s hotel,” he announced, “Royal Retreat, a five star property on the Thames. It’s a small present from my side, for you and your partner. The executive suite is all yours, all meals included and a limo ride to the property and back to your home. All expenses paid, including the bar, pool and spa. Have fun, chill, relax, make the better half happy. Thank you Mr. Watson.”
.” He whispered his plans into Sherlock’s ear and Sherlock nodded with glee. “God, I’d really like to see the look on his face,” the young professor got out of the car and came around it, “He’ll be outraged, to put it mildly. See you later then Jawn.”
“Thought so,” Sherlock chuckled. It was very typical of his mummy to give people second chances and to adopt unconventional ways of sorting out stuff. She must have found something worthwhile about Greg’s intentions and purposes and therefore assisted him in getting into the house when both her elder son and her husband were out.
“It’s a double murder but the crimes are much more,” Greg answered, reading something on his phone, “First it was a security agency employee whose kid was kidnapped and then that same employee was threatened and beaten up. Then an old Fox Terrier dog was also killed. Even that is a murder in my opinion.”
John’s hands moved downwards and cupped the pert buttocks of the younger man, squeezing the mounds of flesh while Sherlock grabbed at the older man’s shoulders and arms, literally clinging to him for support and to keep himself upright while every part of his body seemed to have turned into jelly. He couldn’t think, he was lightheaded and dizzy. John was so aroused that the stupendous heat of his loins felt almost uncomfortable, as if there was a fire there that threatened to soon consume all of him.
to the two boys I had raised from childhood to late teens. If Sherlock has chosen you, after weighing all pros and cons, then I am with him.
So, when they stepped into their Kensington South apartment, a property they owned but didn’t quite ‘stay in’, the sleuth burst out into curses and short angry rants.
They raced each other for the next several minutes and fought fair and square but with a competitive edge to their strokes. Sherlock found that John was faster in freestyle and backstrokes while the more complex strokes, like breast stroke and butterfly were areas he won easily. By the end of thirty minutes they had developed a healthy respect for each other.
“Done deal,” John got up and playfully smacked Sherlock’s rump, “Go shower and dress and come downstairs in about half an hour.”
“Here,” Sherlock said as the enormous automatic garden gate opened and let them into the sprawling property that was surrounded by a compound wall whose height had been freshly raised from six feet to eight feet after the murder incident. “Consider this your own house Jawn,” Sherlock said, “We have a tennis court, a pool, a basketball court, a gym, a home theater with surround sound. You will find it easy to spend your time here. I have very good staff who will be happy to support you!”
“Oh,” Phil had an Eureka moment a little later, “This is the man they call…. ‘Fixer’. He fixes several things, by hook or by crook, including relationships and….” He was muttering these words as he walked out and while doing so, he chanced upon a photograph whose frame was being polished by one of the employees.
Gifts were exchanged and so were handshakes and hugs. The two townies were extremely delighted to meet their men and Jim and Sherlock were simply thrilled and relieved to see their beaus again. All their earlier convictions about avoiding emotional attachments, love etc had melted away in the heat of the attraction between them and their objects of affection. Only a day apart had taught them the pain of separation and now neither of them wanted to take a chance with their new relationships again. “Why have you got me another gift?” Sherlock asked, “These binoculars are just what I needed but you already gave me these shoes.” John smiled fondly, “I saw this and just thought they belong to you! Thanks for the pouch, personalized with my name, wow!”
Jim stopped the car and got out. Sebastian stared in astonishment for a moment before he did the same.
“Oh no, where did they go?” Greg gasped, “Myc, we need to find them. The weather is getting worse, there is a real gale blowing and you know how unstable the banks of the lake could be during such weather, right? And if they go to the village they might be shot. Not everyone will have the mercy we showed them. Come on, we need to look for them and bring them back right away.”
. He turned towards John and said sharply, “We are hardly the ones to talk huh? You are married to an assassin and me to a criminal mastermind. So what if her partner is a bit fat and bald and only twenty years older?”
He was walking back downstairs when he spotted Mycroft through one of the windows on the landing between two flights of steps. The big man was standing behind two cherry blossom trees in the backyard, now bare-branched due to the weather. Curious and in desperate need for a distraction, John decided to join Mycroft for a few minutes. Maybe he would tell John how he managed to fall for the Napoleon of crime.
Mycroft came back in later and soon some relatives arrived. The ‘Moriarty’ topic effectively took a hiatus. But the knowledge that Mycroft was dating a man as dangerous as that and who was Sherlock’s arch-nemesis, struck at the very core of John’s heart. Indeed this family was odd.
“You know, I had bought something for Jim,” Sebastian showed John a small box, opening it and displaying a beautiful dual tone Sonata ring for Jim. The upper half was white gold, the lower half was semi-sheen yellow gold. One diamond baguette was embedded on the upper segment and at a cross angle there was a second baguette on the golden half of the band. The inner side of the band had their initial carved in calligraphy – JM & SM.
Still, he aided Sherlock’s grabby and eager hands as his clothes went flying all over the place. Suddenly cold air kissed his skin and he knew he was stark naked, Sherlock rubbing and moaning against him, eager for
Just as the killer tried to press the big round red button, Sherlock suddenly yelled at him from somewhere above. The killer growled and threw a knife at him. John yelled and ran out of his hiding place, gun raised.
“Johan,” John said with a shake of his head, “Please continue to be your intelligent self, as you were during the interview. Why make comments that have no sense of logic whatsoever! True philanthropy is where the person behind it isn’t shown, only the act is shown and felt. I am not part of this generation of limelight seeking parasites who put everything on social media but don’t have the heart to wish their own grandparents on their birthdays. I am not your typical socialite and I don’t care where your magazine stands in rankings. I told you I am granting only the interview and that is done. At the most you can make this a podcast, period.”
John was applying suntan lotion on him already, his hands lingering longer than necessary on Sherlock’s pert and rosy rear, his breath hitching now and then as he caressed the smooth flesh of the twin butt cheeks. “Um…. You can do that, this is a mansion, not a council estate…. You have privacy here….” He stopped, cleared his throat and stayed quiet for a little while. Sherlock felt himself harden and while that was embarrassing, he knew he was not alone in it. He saw the tenting in John’s shorts and because it was wet, the outline of his cock was quite apparent. Sherlock felt a shiver run down his spine.
But what about Jawn? I didn’t get to see him this morning and now…. Well, I guess I have to tell him we will meet again in two weeks. “Very well,” Sherlock relented at last, “I’ll go with you.”
They started snogging right away and the straw underneath them made strange crackling and squeaking sounds as Sherlock let his legs fall apart and pushed a tube of lube into John’s palm. “Someone came all prepared it seems,” John said with a feral look at his lover, “Oh I love you for that you naughty little boy. Now let me show you who is daddy! Come to daddy, come on now, don’t be afraid private!”
Kayden’s eyes narrowed, “Look doctor Watson, I understand your situation. Healed, with a degree, with a pension, to the world it just seems like you gotta plant yourself back into civilian life. But I know, from watching many others around me, it’s not a piece of cake.”
After half a minute’s silence, the elder sibling spoke. “I haven’t told them anything about this strange adventure of yours and this latest debacle! I spoke at length with Greg last evening. I called him after Mrs. Hudson assured me you were knocked out. The doctor had given you some meds and a couple of shots and we had managed to feed you some soup and made you drink some water. You seemed to be a zombie all through, babbling, moaning, hardly making any sense.”
“What’s the hurry, we could at least have breakfast together,” John said, looking rather radiant and happy, “It’s a Sunday after all and the roads will be empty. You’ll be back in a jiffy. Breakfast is at nine, if you wait just one more hour….. what say?”
Sherlock simply dropped his clothes and stood there, naked, and started touching the twin nubs on his smooth chest; at which point poor John Watson forgot the fine line between truth and lies and took him
John shot up from the bed, stung. Oh God, this was a very wrong move, no, I have been making a series of very wrong moves. “She likes you,” he tried to placate Sherlock somewhat, “She is a fan of your work.”
“You are a crooked, affected, snobbish, greedy, gluttonous, sloth of a man who spends more time than a woman does in front of a mirror. You have OCD, I have seen you wiping imaginary dirt from your hands after shaking mine. As if this isn’t shameful enough, you’re also a miser.”
Sherlock stuck his head out of the window and yelled, “Yeah, as okay as we can be with the cops here hurtling around like out-of-control missiles. Jesus, we were on a blind turn but you could see the way couldn’t you?”
“No, no, I just wanted to ask…. Is Sherlock… will Sherlock be….. I mean has Sherlock gone to London to meet someone there???”
Greg was caught between reasoning with his partner to questioning the accuser. Even he had known the two boys long enough to vouch for them. Sure they were eccentric, they were naughty, they were full of mischief but they were not evil and certainly not cursed.
They held hands and smiled, remembering all those memories, of the days of their friendship, of their triumphs and togetherness, the happy moments, the laughter, their beaus, those beautiful intimate moments spent with them, those gorgeous remembrances flooded their senses as they felt some power was elevating them beyond all fears and apprehensions and bonds. They felt free, ecstatic, relaxed, they felt light as feathers. The sun was about to rise, the horizon had turned into a lovely orange. Any moment the beautiful sunrise would happen, giving the earth another glorious day to enjoy. The two young men stood up and walked to the edge of the precipice, ignoring the collapsing rocks and chunks around them. Once they were there, Jim gave his friend a sideways glance.
“It’s not going to make things better. Just a ‘sorry’, that’s all? Jawn, you really broke my heart. You thought you could just walk away from me like that, for no fault of my own, even if I had done or said nothing to deserve this treatment, this letdown? How do you expect me to accept your apologies so easily. You have to earn it Mr. Doe, you are really going to have to work hard to get it sometime in the future.”
“I usually am right and you never listen to me,” Sherlock snapped back at him and started eating bacon furiously. Jim looked at him through the corner of his eye and smiled gleefully, then toed his friend under the table and said, “Just look at that. Polly is coming here. Bet the first thing she’s gonna say is we should be announcing some happy event soon.” Sherlock saw and groaned, shaking his head. Why wouldn’t people leave them alone? Why was everyone in that area so bloody obsessed with the two of them marrying. They were friends, they were two versions of the same person, couldn’t they see that such people should never marry but remain friends forever?
“Then by all means do call her but wait just a few more minutes to do so,” John said, staring at the skies, “It’s going to pour again Sherlock. We should be somewhere safe, warm and cozy. Even the mercury seems to have dipped at least ten degrees overnight, don’t you think? And this blustering wind is getting worse as we speak.”
Mycroft almost raised his arm but Greg caught it firmly, casting an appalled glance at his partner. ‘Think of me’ was what that gaze stated. Siobhan and Eurus were similarly conflicted.
“Maybe it was a very good idea to not call them today. If they turn out to be liars and horndogs then we know where we stand.”
Greg frowned, that was the calling bell. At this time of the night. 1-15 am. If it was his office they would have called first.
“Yes but he was beaten and drawn into the water, so even if not a first degree murder it is definitely a proper culpable homicide, third degree.”
“I have thanked them already,” John said, “I handed each one an envelope. Cash bonus for them, different amounts depending on who they are and how long they have worked for us but I can assure you the sums are quite generous. As for Mary and her hubby, Mike and his wife, Harry and her partner Lucy, Elizabeth, I have got some cool gifts for them. Diamonds for Mary, a car for her partner, a holiday on my yacht in Monaco for Mike and his wife, matching Louis Vuitton bags and luggage set for Harry and Lucy and a Birkin for Elizabeth.”
“You said ‘we’. That clearly means you dine with someone else now. And if someone is dining with you so late in the evening then that means they live with you too. Or at least, that’s what they have been doing lately. Tell me Johnny, have you found someone to share your life with? What does Mary feel about them…. Him…. I am assuming you have found a man this time.”
“Will you help me? Tell the colonel something and perhaps assist me. I know you’re no longer with Sherlock but at a human level I am requesting your help and support.”
Greg looked at them with assurance, “No, I am not angry and thanks for pointing that out. Yes, he could very well be a criminal. Sherlock I mean. But that doesn’t mean he is.”
“Nope, just tried to tell him not to trust strangers,” Greg laughed. Jim nodded, “I can see ‘Sherlock’ clearly in this story, stupidly generous and weirdly non-perceptive. Always pick the weakest link in the chain and try to mend it, even if it doesn’t need mending or deserve mending. You see, some people are meant to be left alone. He tried to do this with me once, found out I was stronger than he was! Then he said…..” whatever else Jim wanted to say was drowned out by the noisy squawks of Greg Lestrade’s cell phone. Both the men craned their necks to check who it was and Greg quickly answered it when the name ‘Phillip Anderson’ flashed on the screen.
His words and tone converted Sherlock and he nodded, agreeing to the short time requested for. “This way please,” Phil put his hand on his back and guided him into an empty classroom, closing the door behind them. “Listen Sherlock, I have some news for you. It won’t make you happy but I think it’s more important for you to be ‘aware’ than ‘happy’ at this moment. John is going to trick you in a manner that you haven’t even thought about so far, something totally beyond your imagination.”
Sherlock grabbed John’s hand absentmindedly. He was not aware of the touch but John was acutely conscious of those long fingers and their magical touch to his skin. His entire arm tingled. He felt like a new lease of life had been injected through him. “We can both go with him, plenty of space in a four wheeler don’t you think?”
Mycroft rolled his eyes and was about to end the conversation then and there when Jim made a surprising statement. “Actually, I wouldn’t mind living here,” he said in a voice that didn’t seem the least bit hesitant or jocular, he sounded dead serious, “This house is huge and you have ten bedrooms. We can all live here without getting into each other’s spaces. Or we could live in the outhouse there, I always liked it. Even when uncle Stoddart was here and Mike and I visited him I used to eye that cottage. A nice patio, a plunge pool, two hammocks in the backyard, living room and kitchen and home office on the ground floor, two bedrooms on the first floor and an attic studio which could become a workspace for me. Incredibly convenient and neat.”
“Oh, hello Greg. Thanks. Can you ask the housekeeping attendant on this shift to serve two cups of Cappuccino in my cabin. Come on Greg, this way please.”
John grinned, “Well said and well corrected. This feels like our old bedroom and I feel like my old self once again. I couldn’t have asked for something better than this, a clean, airy room with freshly laundered sheets and the whiff of flowers. Well, well, well, something is going on around the house isn’t it? What have you been up to baby?”
He entered the flat at the same time Sherlock came out of his bedroom, looking like a delicious yet obscenely sexy and
“Because I have a feeling John thinks Sherlock was responsible for three deaths in his family and therefore had no right to live out the rest of his.”
Whatever fears and inhibitions Sherlock had, the nerves that were bothering him, vaporized into thin air and he was filled with a warm, cozy, confidence of being loved and wanted, of being respected. He had never felt this respected and worthy before. “Jawn….”
“No, what are you talking about? A woman screaming? Do you see a woman around here? Anyways, you said you were dreaming so chances are that you heard that scream in a dream. There you go, scream in a dream!”
Sherlock smiled fondly at John who seemed as nervous as a little boy on the first day at a new school. “Yes, you are more than ready and we are all set.”
“From what Phil and the rest of the people on the ground told me, it’s not only a murder but a very brutal one. The victim is the tramp who lived there, in the woods, close to the homestead property of Mr. and Mrs. Smallwood. We had warned him several times to leave and go to the town shelter but he knew he’d be stopped from doing drugs there, hence he never listened to us. It seems someone ripped through him.”
“In that case Sherlock, if you wish to attend that and let me attend this one. I know we are one unit and it’s only fair we both go somewhere together but if we have conflicting schedules over the holidays then maybe it’s best that we spend Christmas together and then split up and….”
“Nobody considered it a joke Superintendent,” Jim confessed, putting his empty cup down on a table, “Least of all John who swore revenge. Now, anyone in his position would think exactly the way he did and he didn’t exactly talk to many people or take their counsel. It was a mortifying matter after all. Even with me he spoke when I made him talk and not before and till this day my husband has no idea of all these details. Now that you tell me this is a doctored photo I am inclined to think we could have tested it for some forensics but these aren’t easily available to the common man, isn’t it? You can go by the usual norms of checking source, pixilation, lighting et cetera but with advanced tools one might escape such scrutiny easily. Even so, I might have been able to convince him Sherlock’s nothing like this since I know Sherlock well but….. he never told me until he had left. This pic, I had to hack his system to get hold of the pic he had spoken of.”
John shook his head. No, he wasn’t ready for that. He hadn’t even thought about it. But that scene from a Christmas Eve when his sister had come out had been sewed on to his soul. The moment he closed his eyes he saw his father railing at Harriet.
John looked at the herb garden, “This is beautiful. Explained Mrs. Bickerton’s amazing dishes, even the presentation on the table. The other day when three of Sherlock’s friends visited from London for the weekend, they were left licking their fingers.” Mrs. Hudson said a measured ‘thanks’ and got up from the stool, heading towards the kitchen island, “Thank you John but I suppose it’s as much Beryl’s credit as these herbs. By growing them I can’t claim to own their properties, fragrance, flavor etc. Want something to drink?”
Jim gave him a wistful glance, “You really think we can sink any lower? We have killed people, we have also caused life-changing injuries to them, we have planned murders with a cool brain. I don’t suppose we can defend ourselves in either a court of law or in a conversation with our conscience. The only worst behavior could be….. if we end up harming our men. The best way possible is to find someone else and ‘just get it over with’.” He sighed and added in a slightly firmer, wickeder tone this time, “That’s assuming Seb and John’s lives are more precious than those of the others. There we might be actually at our worst behavior, trying to stop ourselves only when we become threats only to people we love.”
Maybe it was all those incessant talking and praising which had filled up his head, but when John found himself thinking about Sherlock even while he was sitting at the interview the next morning, he decided to just banish the young man from his head.
John shook his head, “Actually, I do want to. All these years I thought maybe I was afraid to rake up memories but what it really turned out to be is….. I was not too fond of the idea of coming in here alone. Your presence helps.”
“Oh,” John looked quite satisfied with the answer, “Tiger is here. Sherlock, it must be a common friend.”
“Then get the car here and call that fellow and tell him to go fuck himself. I am resigning from all responsibilities and duties I have towards him, his associates and the companies where he has invested.”
Instantly Sherlock forgot all about everything and began to thrust up into nothing but air, grabbing at the wisps of blond hair he could grab. The deeper John thrust his tongue in, the harder he shuddered and cursed, turning his face sharply from one side to the other.
“No. I was with my friend who lives in the town. I got to know after she and her husband dropped me to your house this morning.”
“Come on John, you are just afraid of nature. It’s not so crowded and noisy as London or any of the other cities we usually move in. Come to my countryside stately home and you’d hear ‘silence’ in the late evenings and up to dawn. I can’t see anyone. And it’s broad daylight, might be locals walking about.”
! John hiccupped, then hyperventilated. He felt that if there was something called the Armageddon of your self-control and propriety then this had to be it. Every bit of memory of pussies, nipples and boobs were erased from his head as he watched the nearly naked man, sporting an Androgynous look in the makeup and wig, sashay before him in lacy panties, fishnet stockings and the slim garter belt. John’s cell phone dropped from his hands, as did the house keys, and John’s hands flew to their respective destinations. One started undoing his belt and the other palmed his erection over his jeans.
The corpse was left half hanging out of the bed, her eyes open and a look of horror frozen there. Tangled in the bedclothes, her blood dripping on the rug beneath, poor Mrs. Mary Finch died from the knife wound while the assailant walked away towards the window nonchalantly.
“And there is Mary Watson and Mike Stamford. Mary is John’s assistant/secretary and Mike is his PR advisor and estate and personal affairs manager. I handle mostly business and resourcing work for John, besides being one of the privileged few who occasionally has a drink with him.”
While the fathers stood speechless, unable to counter the logic in his statements, the mothers, however, were more emotional and they flung themselves on Mycroft.
John was not sure that was a good idea. He had immense faith on Sherlock, he believed in Sherlock more than he believed in himself, but that was strictly limited to Sherlock’s expertise in laboratories and experiments or his ability to solve mysteries and saving lives. When it came to his own life or safety, Sherlock could be quite the maverick, sometimes even an outright kamikaze. He often rode on luck, sometimes he escaped through sheer coincidence, a few times he pulled a rabbit out of his hat through one of his genius moves. But John was aware that even genius had its limitations and one small little miscalculation could easily get the reckless detective into big trouble.
They panted and moaned and whimpered for the longest time, arms still around each other and the semen cooling on their hands. Neither man wanted to move at present, not even when they heard knocks on the door and Gretel announcing that she had brought some dinner for the two of them. “She will smell and sense everything,” John said with a sleepy smile, “I guess we better get the trolley from the doorway.” Sherlock was reluctant to get out of bed but he knew John was even more exhausted than him and slowly crawled out of his lover’s arms and swung his long legs over the side. “Very well old man,” he teased, “Stay put here while I do all the hard work for ya!”
He knew he could never harbor hopes or love with the same spirit and passion again, forget about being happily married and an optimistic man. He was now an empty shell, a dried out husk who was alive but not really living. Something had indeed died inside him.
“I thought so too. Look at those lines. I have never seen a hand like this. I mean, I am not a palmist but I do have some knowledge, I have read many books, I have met many people and….. not a single one is anything like you.”
want to be in that situation? Imagine this, he is the only family you have and you don’t really wish him harm. Since he’s the patriarch now, he will for sure disown you, so you’ll have to start all over again, move out of that house even. All for living with a
Phil looked at him, “That means we are dealing with a criminal who’s fast, sharp and agile in both the mind and body.”
He doubled his efforts at sucking the younger man and crooked his fingers to touch upon the sweet spot in the depths of his lover. A few insistent rubs and he felt the familiar jerk in Sherlock’s cock, followed by his thighs closing and pushing inwards and finally a series of erratic thrusts as Sherlock fucked his mouth to ecstasy. Low rolling moans vibrated around his cock and he let go, about a second after he felt the splatter and outpour of sweet semen on his tongue and then more spurts at the back of his throat.
“So you’ll just let him stalk you and say nothing? Nothing at all? If you don’t wanna talk to him then let’s complain about him. Stalker behavior isn’t really healthy you know.”
Both villas were near identical designs, except for Jim’s house which had a couple of attic rooms and a bathroom on the third level and a servant’s quarter behind the house where their butler and cook lived. Sherlock’s house had an outhouse too, but that was his brother’s home office. He was the local ranger there. Next to the outhouse were two cottages, where his coworkers lived, separated from the main villa by a picket fence.
“Me too,” Jim echoed and ran ahead of Seb, getting into his bedroom and landing in bed. By the time Sebastian had closed the door Jim was half naked already. Seb quickly dropped his pants.
“Sherlock,” John said calmly, smiling fondly at his man, “We have been paid fifty grand each for this and it goes to charities. Remember? We pledged to do something good this season. This was such a move and now that it’s successfully accomplished, you shall be duly rewarded too.”
Sherlock had fallen asleep late the night before, actually as late as 2-30 am. He was totally zonked out when the insistent ringing of his phone woke him up around 7-30 am. Not a naturally effusive and energetic morning person, he was grumpy and half asleep and answered it with a mumbled ‘h’lo’ and nodded off again, until the words brought him back to reality. It was Mary’s voice and she sounded very alarmed and concerned. “Hey,” he rubbed his eyes, “Hi, sorry, I am awake now…. How come you’re calling? Weren’t you supposed to be sailing towards Crete this week?”
“Seems okay to me for now,” John said, “We had a bit of snow last night….anyways. Sherlock, which one is your room?”
“There is a nice Asian restaurant that’s opened up a couple of blocks from my office. I once saw you reading an article on Pan-Asian food, especially the barbeque. They have live Barbeque, Korean, over there. Very nice place, or so I have heard.”
“You’re reading it all wrong sir,” Mike answered restlessly, feeling nervous, “When he was brought in, one of the students called him a cousin. Later we got to know he wanted to avoid a police probe and made that silly mistake. As soon as we realized we reported this to Charlie.”
“Bloody damned broad,” he muttered as he pissed against a tree, “Always being such a…..” He thought he heard a sound. It was a footstep but a very heavy footstep. Certainly not that of a human being.
John scratched the back of his head sheepishly but the moment he saw Greg roll his eyes he quickly lowered it and muttered ‘sorry’. Sherlock looked at his brother, “I wanted to tell you and introduce him to mummy and daddy too. In fact I gave a few hints to mummy earlier this week and I had planned to come over with him for lunch with you tomorrow.”
Sherlock had always had a compulsive attraction towards John, in both a spiritual and carnal way but that day, for some odd reason, he felt his senses were going on overdrive. Once they had come back to their wing, John decided to take a bath and when Sherlock saw him reclining in the huge bathtub, naked and magnificent, he felt his raging hormones hit straight at his groin. He was so horny he had to take deep breaths to calm himself down and coordinate his limbs enough to strip naked and join his man in the tub.
A kiss was pressed to his forehead and John went off to shave. Sherlock threw on a robe, the same robe John had bought for him and went to sit on his chair. He felt incredibly good save for the slight bit of pain and soreness in his arse. Even that was much better than the early morning hours. He was young and strong, he had good healing flesh, he’d be better in no time. The first thing he did when he took his phone in his hands was text Jim and boast.
“Oh yes that sounds great. Would love to do that someday. Don’t worry John, I am sure I will be back soon.”
“I have had enough of your chaff. I am not amused Sherlock, you will tell me what this is, what it really is.”
Sally read out from the file. “The ones killed - An old woman of eighty and a thug who was forty, that means exactly half her age. Another thug missing. They had just been released from a six month stint in jail. But the man died of drowning.”
As soon as he had reached the bedroom suite, as huge and grandiose as his own, her companion Elizabeth came out to greet him. “Hey John,” he hugged her and she kissed his cheek, “Good to see you. All well?”
“Then all I have to do is learn Morse properly. To be honest, I didn’t think it was necessary. I fell asleep half way through the lesson you were giving me.”
“Well, if he comes around again he will face my wrath and he loaded end of my gun,” roared Mr. Smallwood, shaking his head, “Greg, what’s going on?”
“And no one who spoke to me has anything to gain from this. None of them are a replacement for you or even a possible replacement. I have known them for years and whatever they’ve shared with me is hardcore proof of your dishonesty and lies.”
Then he heard a floorboard creak outside and almost howled with panic. Rushing outside, he saw no one in the living room. He was alone there in the house, all windows and doors bolted from inside. Heaving a sigh of temporary relief, he went to the kitchen to start some soup.
“No thanks, we will call later,” Jim said and disconnected even as the innkeeper’s woman kept asking, “May I know who’s call……” The Irishman looked at Sherlock and shook his head, “Out to town, they are possibly screwing some random townies, one of those found in that dratted ‘Clubhouse Cabana’ which is known for its……” He didn’t finish the sentence, his nostrils were flaring and his face had turned a shade of beetroot red. Sherlock looked at him with concern and put his hand on his shoulder, “Hey, hey, hey, look at me and don’t jump to conclusions. You are sometimes too impulsive and quick to react. Just hang on and don’t make any decisions in your head. We will speak to them tomorrow and find out.”
“You try not to be, but from what you’ve been saying it seems you do have some internalized homophobia. To figure out that source we will need to do proper sessions. I am not sure you really want that, do you?”
They sat quietly for some time, hearing the various birds and bees in the garden and the quiet flow of a stream nearby. Sherlock could sense the reasons behind John’s natural trust issues and inability to have healthy relationships.
“Why me?” Sherlock asked in a tone filled with loathing, directed towards himself as well as Jim, “There are so many out there in the world.”
John watched in utter surprise as everyone did exactly as Greg mentioned, leaving John to sit in Sherlock’s car. As the latter drove towards John’s London home, a maisonette flat in a posh neighborhood, Sherlock talked about his work, his research, his brother and even Mrs. Hudson etc but not a word about his life or marriage. Finally, as they reached the block, Sherlock announced that he had taken the liberty of taking the key of the flat from Jim and cleaning it, calling a couple of retainers as well just in case John needed some help in settling back into his old life. “Thanks,” John said, dazed, “I….. so, is that it?”
He brought his hand down and rubbed at her clit, hard and fast, pressing down on it just the way she preferred.
Maybe Mike was right, he was being way too conservative and a doubting Thomas. He would get a job soon. Until then he could sure afford to pay this low rent. But he was 100% sure he had heard the figure incorrect or maybe Mike had heard it incorrect. How could anyone rent out a flat on Baker Street with no security deposit and a six hundred a month lease?
“How are the two of them even related?” John asked. Lestrade blew out a blob of smoke and gave him a crooked smile, “
“Cousin Greg,” Redmond waved towards him from a precipice on which his fiancée was standing while he took pics of her, “You guys go along. We will be around.”
John sat down on a chair, then stood up, then shuffled his feet and sat down again. For some reason he felt rather ‘exposed’ before the lady, her self-assurance, graceful manners and composure was so immaculate that he felt like a fly buzzing before a swan. Sherlock was of no help in these situations, as usual, he was on his third cookie by then.
. But, as the other man came in he noted a shadow of sadness on his face. “Hey,” he asked, a bit concerned, “All well with you? Did you manage to meet Jawn and give him those things. What did he say? What did he say? Did he like the letters, the gifts, snacks?”
As she prepared the tea, John sat at the kitchen table and looked around it. “Big enough,” he said, “Six chairs, serving area, I wonder why we don’t have a meal or two here sometimes. Usually it’s only the three of us who eat together.”
“You need some pain meds, have they done X-Rays and other checks for you, lemme see the reports, oh yes they have, Hmmmm, good, yeah those are all clean, you are in no danger my friend but you have to take it easy for at least a couple of weeks. Now have some soup, the nurse was trying to feed this to you, wasn’t she?”
“No, I don’t look at that way dear,” she said in a tone of sincerity, not a trace of contriteness in it, “I am not a vengeful and spiteful woman, I can assure you that! But while I am happy to see you two conquer challenges and find a common path ahead, you have to admit it’s not the easiest choice to see your ward go off and marry someone who is not only a stranger to you but also to himself. I don’t mean to spoil your day or mood son, but kindly think about the ramifications of not remembering your past life! Even if you were a hardworking, respectable and educated man with a good job or a brilliant profession, what if you have a family elsewhere from your previous life….. a partner, a wife probably… or a husband perhaps…. Kids, even? If you remember them will you decide to stay here or move back with them?”
The New Beckett village and the lake surrounding it is now free of the curse. People’s memories are short. Soon all those deaths and attacks, which were attributed to that of some wild animal, would be gracing the pages history.
“You must give me ten minutes,” Harry continued, not giving up despite the duo’s silence, “I am not asking for much. Please sir, please.” “It’s not the right time Harry,” Mycroft said with a frown, “There have been twin tragedies, both at our village as well as the town here and you want me to…..”
It started tentative, a soft peck on the lips, before he graduated to insistent rubbing of the soft flesh, until John’s mouth opened and he allowed Sherlock’s lips to touch his tongue. That triggered an immediate response from the younger man whose lips parted instantly and soon their tongues were entwined, rubbing and battling for dominance.
John froze. No, he is drunk. He is emotional. He won’t even remember this tomorrow morning. “I do…..” Sherlock began to repeat.
Phil nodded, “I will speak to Charlie. He can have someone deployed to do surveillance there. Plain-clothed and nearby posting, along with remote surveillance from the station.”
“He’s created quite a kingdom of his own,” Sherlock murmured. He was beginning to slowly realize how enormous his task was and how important his ‘client’ was.
Jim’s last memory was going to bed with Sebastian and waking up right there. Sherlock too spoke of a similar memory after which he remembered nothing.
“I understand. I can’t discuss this with anyone else. No one else can be involved. I have to give proofs and evidence where needed, whenever needed and must agree for any amount of surveillance and background searches and investigations to be done, if the employer wishes.”
Jim scoffed at the very thought, “Bollocks man utter and total bullshit. Nothing of that sort would be on their minds because they already know. You are over-analyzing this and unnecessarily drawing out imaginary patterns. Where are they off to anyways? Damn, I didn’t even bother to ask them.”
“Oh yeah, we should look downslope again,” Mycroft pointed at a bush where a white flimsy little item was stuck between the twigs and leaves, “Isn’t that a face tissue with some lipstick marks on it. That girl was wiping her face with it, I remember seeing that. If it’s there then they surely went that way.” Greg followed him and Edgar, Michael close behind them, a bit upset at his cousin’s irresponsible behavior. “What is the matter with that boy,” he muttered, “I told him to stick around, stay close by. If they got bored they could have just taken one of the hourly buses and gone back to the village. Sometimes people can be so……” he paused, eyes almost popping out, as he saw Julia walking up towards them. It was the same figure Edgar had spotted a couple of minutes ago.
Ten minutes there was only silence. Then a pair of glowing eyes opened in the darkness and Jim sat up. He listened hard for Sebastian’s breathing and only after he had realized the man was deeply asleep, he gently extricated himself from his embrace and got out of the bed noiselessly.
John realized something was seriously wrong. Mike had sounded so ebullient and cheerful before he had left the property. Now he sounded as if he was weighed down by some burden. He was not only sullen but also a bit afraid of something or someone. “Guys,” he called out, “If there is something I must know then please call it out loud and clear. I don’t do well with riddles, I am one for clear, crisp communication.”
“You can be quite prickly if you don’t get your morning tea, dinner in the evening and sex at night before bedtime.”
He also saw some brochures and remembered an advertisement he had seen years ago on the internet. Adding two and two he tried to form the whole picture.
Sherlock skidded into the living room with his jaw slack and eyes wide, his arms outstretched. “No, no, that tea is only for him.”
“Forgive her,” Reginald snickered, “She likes a big, full nest with all her children around her. Since Eurus will be leaving soon and setting up her own house, she wants at least one of the sons married and the son in law to be living under her roof.”
“Thanks, I really wanted to meet him by the way,” John replied, staring at Jim. The former criminal handed his phone back and said, “What are you staring at?”
Mycroft gave his partner an amused glance. “Greg, I live only thirty meters down the street and this is our front yard. We are not in the forests and isolated areas in the cliffs and valleys or one of those deserted and lonely lakeside spots or islets. I’ll just go and be back in half an hour after the shower and change of clothes. Keep the porch light on, okay?”
“You slut,” Sebastian kicked the door shut and jumped his bones instantly, “You are trying to get me worked up huh? Well, you won’t succeed. Nope. I will have you, on my own terms.”
“Did you hear?” Molly sat up. She was sharing the room upstairs which was originally allotted to Anthea. Molly was too afraid to sleep alone or sleep on the ground floor.
“Tell me Sherlock, what do you do, what’s your profession?” John asked boldly, unable to stop himself from rambling on and on, “I would like to know everything about you. As much as you’d like to reveal of course but the more the better. I-I have never met someone as unique and captivating as you are, someone so smart and good looking and charming, someone who’s a fine man as well as an intriguing one, someone who’s just tempting me to explore and discover more! Please, I don’t want to speculate, tell me about yourself. What are your likes and dislikes, what are your ambitions, aspirations and dreams, what exactly were your childhood days and your teenage and school years like?!”
John looked at Phil’s head sticking out of the window and saw how passers by turned and looked at him with frowns. He was creating quite the racket with his honking and yelling. God, did the man have no manners at all? Every time he tried to soften his approach, Phil gave him a new reason to detest him. “You are right Sherl,” he murmured, “This is indeed unacceptable. So then let’s play
“Yes Grugg, let’s go and check if a demon came out of one of my beakers or jars and attacked your insufferable husband.”
“Oh yeah, fuck my face just like this. I know there is a dirty pervert inside that wants to ravish me in the most obscene yet hottest of ways!”
A look of pure relief and joy washed over John’s visage and he smiled broadly at his mate. “Well love, thanks for understanding, but now that it seems to be over I am honestly a bit weirded out by the whole thing,” John confessed, stroking Sherlock’s hand, “It was lovely while it lasted but it was hard on you and I was also a bit…. Freaked out by what was happening. Honestly Sherl, it’s never happened to me before and unless there was something I ate or….. No, I haven’t taken anything that could trigger this, either orally or through any injection,” John scratched his chin, brows knotted together in deep thought, “Well, whatever it was, it wasn’t really normal.”
Gregory Lestrade and-and-and who was this? The other man was none other than Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock’s elder brother and a barrister. He had come to the college once and Sherlock had introduced him to his colleagues.
Sherlock felt a sudden shiver run down his spine. “Relationships are funny and complex, aren’t they?” He sighed, “We end up trusting the wrong people and pushing away the ones who’ll always be there for us. Something like that happened to me too, which is why I can relate to mummy, daddy and you better. John trusted Sebastian and didn’t even give me a chance to explain anything. That hurt me more than anything else, I swear.”
“I know. But don’t you worry. He will surely show up again tomorrow. I have a feeling he likes you too. He seems pretty happy to visit and leaves even happier, all smiles.”
“What happened?” John snarled, now sounding disgusted with Sherlock’s silence, “Cat caught your tongue? Want me to spell it all out? I thought you were a bit better and cleverer than that dear Sherlock.”
Sherlock sniffed at the tea when he knew John was not looking, then started to sip it slowly. John also sipped his tea and for a while there was a comfortable silence in the room. They were both naked and Sherlock noted with glee that John didn’t have an erection. The experiment, though accidental, was a success. John was fine, the pills were as potent as he wanted them to be and he had had great sex and cum more than nine times the previous day and night. John had been the invincible stag, the alpha wolf or the testosterone-driven top that had bred him thoroughly. Talk about having your cake and eating it too.
John sat in the safe room, a luxurious and spacious room which had all the amenities one needed to be occupied and comfortable, listening to the covert sounds of two men in the act of love in the next room. To his dismay he was getting aroused and beginning to spill his tea.
“Don’t snap at me you pasty skinned scrawny bastard, I am warning ya,” Jim yelled and raised his arm to punch him but this time Sherlock was prepared and quickly grabbed his arm, pushing him back slightly and putting some distance between them. Jim gasped, looking at Sherlock and then around them, as if he couldn’t believe this was really happening and not some ghastly, frightening nightmare.
“You will be here for a month. All your expenses are covered by this fee. I will help you with your current issue, but for that we must build your foundation as a confident, capable and charismatic human being. If we can’t manage in a month we shall try two more weeks after that. But not more than six weeks. In that case, you’ll go home without results and without a refund. Agreed?”
He quickly pulled out whilst she was still moaning and shuddering, floating in an orgasm that seemed to have shut off her brain completely. Even as he got up and off the bed, she kept wailing softy as she touched her own nipples, riding out the aftershocks.
“Why put a gun to my temple, I could have been alerted simply by a touch on the shoulder,” John complained as he and Mycroft walked around the clinic driveway, with the attractive woman (whose name was supposedly Anthea) watching over Sherlock. John didn’t think Sherlock was in any form or shape of trouble, because the place was teeming with several other Mi6 people, all in plain clothes.
“I am the one who triggered this whole saga of pretense, didn’t I? I was the one who found out about the will being changed and…..”
John lifted the covers and Sherlock, who had lately started sleepwalking, slid into the spot next to him and curled up against him. In two seconds he began to snore softly, totally relaxed and at ease. John lay awake for about an hour, pondering over the situation and Sherlock’s forays into his room and his bed.
“Why don’t we talk about the other thing now?” Irene spoke up, interrupting her, “Jim, Sherlock, since you are locals maybe you can help in this matter.”
Sherlock felt a bit bad about his outburst and sighed, giving her a reconciliatory look. “I am not angry with you Lucy, just with the circumstances that made John leave the house. I am not an eighteenth century woman who was hounded by everyone as soon as she hit eighteen years of age, telling her that her life’s goal is to find a man. There were good reasons to do that then, nowadays nobody here, man or woman, is put through such an ordeal. I want all talks about my suitors, admirers, my marriage, engagement, affairs to cease immediately. Any further mentions and there will be trouble, including dismissal.”
“Apparently Sebastian did just that but you refused to take the call without even listening to your dad. Now tell me that didn’t happen, did it? Oh man, it did. You just refused without knowing you were the first person he called this morning!”
“That is the point,” Mary said, sounding a bit skeptical about the whole thing, “He doesn’t. Which clearly means he could be anyone, right? There is a risk attached to this man which you should be aware of. The point I am trying to make here is that…..
Sherlock smiled, “Good idea! But you’re making a mistake Inspector. I’m not calling you guys jerks. But you have to agree that the way a human being was treated in that rehab center was appalling. I won’t send him back there to suffer. This is my house, my life, I choose to shelter whoever I wish to. Why don’t you guys do your job and find out the slayer, the murderer…..”
As he spoke, Sherlock stood on tiptoes to reach out for something kept on the top shelf of the kitchen and his pajamas slid down just a little more. John’s eyes obviously went there and this time the already aroused and sex-starved doctor didn’t try the gentlemanly route of asking. He acted like a caveman, a brute, and grabbed Sherlock by his hips. The younger man yelped, legs suddenly lifted off the ground as the former army-man once again showed his superior strength and carried him over his shoulder, right out of the kitchen and away from this survival bullshit and the seemingly unsightly….pemmican.
“Wow! In other words I will be earning real money from that business! My salary isn’t too high from the job that I do but combined with the profits….. Maybe I can actually pay for our holiday later this year.”
“Okay what next?” John asked. Sebastian patted his belly, “I don’t know about the rest of you but I am hungry as well.”
“What’s the matter?” He asked, looking straight at John. He had a feeling about what this might be but he didn’t want to second guess.
After hearing the news of Harry’s death he had rushed over to investigate. Along with Greg he had found a couple of clues that led straight towards Sherlock and Jim. One was a chewing gum wrapper which had fallen out of Jim’s pocket, the same ones he often chewed on. The other was Sherlock’s Issy Miyake cologne, which was his signature scent. It filled the entire basement like a second layer of air.
“As for accommodation, I can ask him to help there too. He knows many people and might be able to suggest something. He is easy to get along with, quite a nice guy who teaches the interns and final year residents at Barts.”
John had always felt circumstantial pressure and succumbed to it. Other people’s expectations had always mattered more to him than his own. Sally had given him so much attention that he felt obligated to buy this, more for her sake than his own. So without even doing a proper analysis he nodded and said, “Yes, so I was.”
“Listen to me Inspector Lestrade,” Harry said in a low whisper, “In case something happens to me and my words remain unfinished, there is one person who can help you. Marvin Von Dyke. Yes, the grand old man of ninety one who’s still going strong. He was a young man when all these things happened, a teenager perhaps. He remembers and he will tell you the truth. Good luck sir. I will be on my way now.”
“Hold on,” Sebastian changed his tune, “We are friends, okay? No matter what we have to do or like to do, if you girls need our help that’s always there. Right John?”
Sherlock felt a surge of disappointment and hurt at the insensitive statement. Here he was trying to talk to Jim, tell him he missed him despite all that was going on with John, to ask him if he was alright and doing well, if he needed more money (Sherlock had given fifty percent of the upfront payment of a hundred grand to Jim) etc. And all Jim was worried about was Sherlock having sex with John and casting a spell on him so he could get his hands on as much of his unaccounted, forgotten assets as he could.
Greg smiled, “Well, I would have loved to but you know my work and what it involves. I don’t really have weekends, anytime a client asks for something it’s always urgent and must be done the same day. A film unit wants an old Packard car and also a hedgehog. Imagine that, a hedgehog and a Packard.” They both laughed and Greg looked up at the first floor of the mansion, looking slightly preoccupied. John noticed but didn’t say anything, waited for the other man to make a statement. After a little while Greg cleared his throat and asked, “He’s still asleep, is he?”
“Yeah and that’s why we are so badly needed there. To investigate and spot the clues. As I always say…..”
“You still hesitate to say ‘cock’, don’t you love?” Sherlock kissed the hole that was pink and shiny and succulently moist, peeking out at him like a ripe fruit that demanded violation with his tongue. But John had a different plan that evening and was going to stick to that; a few kisses down there was fine but rimming would be for a later round. “I will put my cock in you and you will get me, all nine inches of me, but that’s for later,” the good doctor licked at the twitching, squirming hole between words and Sherlock hissed, “But first you get my fingers and you know DAMN WELL how good my fingers are and what if….my whole hand fits snugly into your tight little purse as if it belonged there?!”
That was a Friday and John had no idea Sherlock was going to be away for the weekend and might even extend his stay at his parents’ place in Warwick. John waited balefully the next Monday for Sherlock and when the man didn’t turn up even as the watch said 10 am, he forlornly went back and took a cab to the office.
The lunch had turned out to be an awesome one and Sherlock found John to be an amazing man. His attractive and suave looks were not even top ten in terms of his qualities. He was well-read and articulate, had a great sense of humor and wit, he was energetic and enthusiastic and shared some common interests with Sherlock. One of them was their mutual love for Italian food, their interests in art history and a fondness for swimming and hiking. So, a week after they had first met, they went hiking up the hills and John got him to a nice secluded spot where an almost crystalline pond was revealed.
John blinked at the sudden sharp tone but didn’t really try to probe or poke. “Very well,” he replied, “Sherl it will be or maybe something else… we can always discuss. You two best be on your way and Sherl, please follow me. We will talk on the terrace. Want some Iced tea?”
. It would have worked had I not heard Sebastian yelling in the background about sausages burning and potatoes getting overboiled in the kitchen. Jim then sheepishly told me he needs to live out his old age with Sebastian so even a man as crazy as him won’t take a few chances at home.
“I have got the money with me,” John held out a thick wad of notes, “Ivan told me it’s twenty-five grand and I have twenty-five grand here.”
Daphne replied, “He is asleep. I’m afraid he is a bit under the weather too. Must have taken too much sun, as he told me.”
Sherlock was not very easy with emotions so he was tongue tied. He swallowed hard and took the gem closer to his face, watching it with awe. “What can I say?” He whispered, “I am honored Mary. You are a very kind and generous woman. I only hope I can be the son you want me to be.” She kissed his forehead and said, “You already are…..” but her next words were drowned out by a loud thunderclap. Sherlock looked at the open windows and said, “There’s going to be a very bad thunderstorm tonight and we need to keep the windows closed.”
,” John sprang to his feet when he realized what had led to the sudden turn of events. Oh God no, did it seem like he was fellating Sherlock, oh yes it did, fuck-fuck, this was not good, now all those kids had seen them too and they’d spread the word, double fuck, triple fuck, this is a bit not good. He looked down at Sherlock who was staring back at him impassively, as if nothing out of the way had just transpired in the room. “How can you be so okay with everything?” He asked irritably, “If there was really something between us I might have still bought your silence, a bit. But people are just going off kilter and calling us a couple….and it’s okay with you?”
Sherlock rubbed the middle of his forehead and approached the table with rushed steps, muttering ‘I am such a numskull.’
John was in Heaven, almost. Sherlock and he had had sex so many times but this day, this time and this particular occasion felt extra special, extra satisfying. The thick bulge of muscle plunging deeper and deeper, moving in and out, rolling and rotating and touching every single inch of him, reaching somewhere so close to his core that even his brain, his most precious appendage, retreated somewhere in the background.
Called Jim and Sebastian who live a retired life in the Bahamas now and got an earful from Jim saying I should be more of myself and
“Thanks for doing the groundwork and setting the stage.  I am wondering, you really were confident you’ll pull this off and I will agree to go and see John right away, didn’t you?”
“Boyfriends,” Eurus grinned, “John is Sherlock’s and Sebastian is Jim’s boyfriend. Yes, they haven’t been together for two long but the affair is pretty intense, if you know what I mean. They have been constant presences in the boys’ lives and they get along very well, so I am sure if Jim and Sherlock need help those men are the best we have to support us and keep matters discreet at the same time.”
Sherlock’s eyes went wide and round, astonishment and happiness hitting him in quick succession. John still thought he was special. John was still enamoured by him. He still managed to arouse his John so much the man could hardly control himself anymore.
“Neither is John, in the same manner of speaking,” Phil said, “There is a backstory involved. So where do you think we should head now? If we are to find out what really happened to John and why he went from a successful entrepreneur and hotelier to a fugitive…. And a murderer on top of that, who do we talk to?”
“N-No, nothing,” Phil quickly covered up, “I-I am, I mean we thought you might pick ‘Jonathan Ross’ or ‘Kingston Browne’. They are both older and more mature and are good looking and….”
To John’s near shock, he was dressed in jeans and a thick cream shirt, a sleeveless pullover on it, and a leather jacket on top of that. He also wore matching belts and boots in the same color as his jacket. He looked relaxed, casual, clearly the relationship had worked well for him.
The other man blinked, “James? Awww, babe, you shouldn’t be so upset with my tone and words. You know me for two years now, even when you were not on your own but with your family! I can go overboard a few times with my verbiage and tone and expressions but I don’t really mean most of it. I am always a babe, your babe, aren’t I? I was just thinking, he shouldn’t suspect you are involved elsewhere.”
Greg asked impatiently, “May we have his name and contact please. Or if you want to call him and we can ask him to come here….”
Well, he would finish his thesis and probably be the first one to leave again. He was always a city boy.
“Upstairs, to my room please. And what are these envelopes again? Did Aunt Monique send them for me?”
“It just occurred to me that when we are that old, passion will need some artificial means of insemination.”
“What?” Sebastian asked as he heard the statement, giving his boyfriend a puzzled look, “You don’t like the girls? They are perfectly okay girls. Just because they wanted to move out of the village and asked us if we should too, c’mon Jimmy you’re better than that.”
But when Sherlock tried to say something John stopped him. “Say nothing please. I don’t deserve any further kindness. All the best and try to forget me as soon as you can.”
“Yeah and sometimes morning persons like to sleep in. I am fine, no worries. Is this a social visit or did you have any work?”
As soon as the two men sat at the table, almost ignoring him, Phil decided he had had enough of this. Without even giving the couple a chance to settle down, he started firing at them right away, venting out all his frustrations. “What the hell is this man, huh?” He demanded, staring at John, “You tell me to be here a little ahead of time and come in thirty minutes late?! What kind of behavior is this?” He turned towards the other man, “And Sherlock, I had been looking for you and you had left the campus already? Couldn’t you have given me a call or answered one of my calls at least?”
Molly appeared to be very alarmed but she couldn’t stop her friend no matter how many reservations she had. “What?” Irene gave her a slightly surprised look, “I am not going to hear protests and objections to my plans?” Molly shook her head with a smile and said, “I am not entirely crazy my dear. While my fears do hold me back and in some ways I allow my conscience to play a bigger role than what it should, thereby impacting my judgement, but I am not some idiot who doesn’t see things the way they are. Something is seriously wrong there and if you have found some kind of insight then you must act on it. I won’t begrudge you the move. But I am sorry, I can’t help either. I am not really strong enough to do that.”
“Oh I know her well and she knows me, she has seen much worse sides of me. If I am living here then she has to provide tea, breakfast, the odd coffee, sometimes some fruits, milk, mouse traps and cages.”
John bent down and kissed the back of Sherlock’s neck. He felt the other man’s breath hitch and grew bolder when he realized Sherlock was not going to stop him. Still, he gave him ample time to say ‘no’ as he caressed his back and kissed down his spine, stopping at the swell of his plush buttocks.
He looked around. Sherlock’s clothes were scattered everywhere. A suitcase and a duffel were missing. He had clearly returned to the flat when John was not around, packed a few items and left again. Was that for good? There were still many, many items of Sherlock’s lying around. But if John knew his lover/friend, he was aware Sherlock could do without all those items or just buy them again. Thanks to John and his interventions on Sherlock’s finances, the detective had a neat sum tucked away in accounts and investments that Mycroft had no visibility to. He could rebuild his whole life and no one would be any wiser.
“Gotcha,” he changed directions, took a short cut through the by-lanes and showed up right in front of Sherlock with the gun pointed at him.
Thank God for small mercies, John thought with a relieved sigh. He spoke a few more words with Jan, then hung up once she seemed a little calmer and better placed to accept his apology. After he disconnected, he got up and chased after Sherlock, something nagging at the back of his mind. Why did Sherlock appear so displeased about the date he was setting up for the next day? Why?
“Thanks,” the older man said, grabbing Sherlock back, “You could have punched me a few more times, God knows I deserve that…..”
In the meantime John dragged me out saying we would have all our meals outside, and laundry duty will be taken over by Mrs. Hudson. But I managed to prevail when it came to grocery shopping. After a nice scrumptious breakfast and a hilarious play at the Old Vic, we went grocery shopping at a large Tesco's. No idea what happened over the next two hours but we were thrown out of two supermarkets before John kept me locked in the car and went in alone in the third. This time things were uneventful and peaceful and he had bags and bags of shopping with him. I began to deduce my own actions in the previous establishments. Maybe I had overreacted to a few people, snarked around a bit too much.
He was already being shoved into the car, in the passenger’s seat. Ben had moved to the backseat by then.
“Don’t get me wrong,” she said quickly, “I don’t mind you talking about him and your cases. I am just saying that….he should know about us and I should meet him.”
They sat in silence for a few moments. Then John said, “You’re really going to leave me at that? What about you? Shall I see you again? Why are you in a hurry to leave?”
The expensive, fine bottle of red wine was opened and they did a toast for lunch, along with takeaway Thai food. A big jar was eggnog was also half polished off, the rest stashed away for later use. A large stuffed Santa was placed near the tree with a tiny chariot, elves and some reindeer harnessed to it. A large box of chocolates was grabbed by Sherlock (John had always suspected his friend had a sweet tooth even though no other item of food particularly interested him) while a very pretty cake stand (three layered) and a huge rich plum cake was gifted to Mrs. Hudson as her ‘present’.
A bit taken aback, the two ladies followed until they were ushered into a storage room by the same nurse. In there stood two men, both flashing their Scotland Yard badges at them. “What is this exactly,” Molly stood protectively before her younger sister who looked fairly scared, “What have I done….. what have we done?”
“Okay, leave it, I get that. Now go and change quickly, take a lightning shower of thirty seconds and come back here. Jim was right, that stench is really not pleasant. It’s going to be your birthday in just about five minutes.”
Sherlock made a face and was about to walk past Phil Andersen when the latter planted himself on his path, obstructing him deliberately. “Five minutes only Sherlock,” he said pleadingly, his voice unusually soft and tender, “I am sure you can give me five minutes, for the sake of our friendship, yeah?”
He showed a broken string and said, “I had even got an extra string to fit it around my groin, just in case the string attached to the hat snapped. And it did snap. Here, dispose this too.”
“He was released the same day yes, but he was a petty thief and thug. This is a very canny mind’s planning. That couldn’t have been done by Tom. Even his accomplice wasn’t the murderer because between the two it was Tom who was smarter and even then he wasn’t smart enough to have planned this.”
“I don’t care about your happiness Phillip,” Greg Lestrade said curtly, “I only care about my client and whether one of these people will suit the purpose and carry through until the end, until my client has what he needs. Honestly, sincerely, truthfully. That’s how he should work. Remember, this man I am working for is not just a client but also a friend and I am taking a big risk doing this for him….. So, it anything goes wrong, take it from me in writing that I shall destroy your agency. I am an ex-cop and I have my contacts there, both you and Sally should know that by now.”
John rolled his eyes, “We will eat dinner but in our room. I will order room-service. But if you think for even a moment that you’re going to put off discussing your foolhardy actions of this evening, then you’re much mistaken. Now march, keep it going soldier.”
“Okay, we’ll watch it. What’s for dinner mummy?” Mycroft was stuck to his phone, nose three inches from it.
Sherlock pointed, “Usually in my bed with your hands tied or on top of me but for now….. um, let’s see what can be done….. Over there, at the edge and next to that tree would do! Be careful though and don’t step back any further because there’s a sheer drop after that, of thirty five feet,” he warned his fiancé.
“Oh Dr. John Hamish Watson, please do come in,” the Head of General Surgery and Trauma Department, Robert Royce, waved him into his large and somewhat cluttered office, pushing aside his half-consumed lunch and focusing fully on the junior surgeon, “I am sorry to have called for this meeting out of the blue, without any formal or prior intimation. I wanted to talk to you before you leave and you’re done with your duties for the day already, so I asked my assistant to arrange ten minutes between us.”
