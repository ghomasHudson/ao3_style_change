“That’s how you welcome your brother you haven’t seen in two months?” Gabe shakes his head in mock hurt. He leaves a wonky looking package on the counter and goes past Castiel to dig in the cupboards. “Anyway, I never went to bed, there was this giant party-”
“I upgraded it, so it can catch the bastards.” Frank looks around quickly, then steps closer to Dean and Cas, lowering his voice, “They look like people, but my camera can see their black goo and huge
Hannah works for the church charity foundation, doing some accounting and office management for them as well as taking part in organising the events. Castiel never realized that could be that stressful and busy until he saw Hannah throw herself in the endeavour.
“Don’t make me talk about that.” That’s a pitiful attempt to escape.
“Yeah, look at us,” Dean grunts and empties the whiskey bottle. “Grown ass adults in our 30s, pursuing success.” There’s some bitterness in the statement that is causing a stinging pain in Cas’ heart.
“What shit?” Count on Charlie to find the juicy bit.
days even when walking up dusty, suffocating boiler rooms. When he was young and therefore horribly philosophically inclined, he mused how men go out every day with their nooses around their necks to slave away all joy and free will in favor of serving a selfish monster of a society. Nowadays he smiles at his previous naivete and ties his blue striped tie. It’s the first gift Dean gave him for a Christmas three years ago. He claimed he sucked at gifts and just picked one randomly. Hannah marvelled at how well it was bringing Cas’ eyes out, saying she couldn’t pick a better one herself.
“Get out of here, Bradbury,” Dean snarls as she picks the rag with two fingers, disgusted.
“What happened?” Castiel is fully awake now, heart rate picking up.
In the next few days the project really starts to take off the ground. The summer days are long and they have plenty of time after Dean’s shift at the garage to get things going. Also the weather is rather warm even after sunset so they use Dean’s searchlight to continue until almost midnight. The work flows smoothly if not quickly.  The wood is delivered on Monday and Cas spends most of the day prepping the gravel base before Dean gets off work. At some point on Tuesday they figure one of Cas’ calculations is off by several inches and the beam notches wouldn’t fit. Thankfully Dean manages to recut them quickly and the delay was only a day. Castiel hasn’t worked with his own hands in a long time so he finds it quite pleasurable.  They keep the conversation light and to the point and it’s as comfortable as usual except they avoid some jokes. Cas pointedly doesn’t think about the accident of the kiss. If he tries hard enough he can almost convince himself it was all a dream.
He peeks out the window again but the Impala is still gone. Was it usual for Dean to be out this late? Of course, it must be, it’s Saturday night after all and not all people are nerdy hermits like Castiel. He frowns at the paper. It shouldn’t surprise him Dean has plans for the weekend that do not include his awkward friend who probably wouldn't fit in anyway.
“Yeah, he’s arriving a day earlier -” There’re the obnoxious slurping noises again. “Do you mind?” Dean wrinkles his nose as Charlie gives him a pointed look from behind the smoothie.
“Yeah” Dean sounds beyond tired. All anger in Castiel has melted away, replaced by worry and vague sense of affection. If he hasn’t been there who would Cindy call? Bobby? Some other of Dean’s friends? Lisa? That would be the worst possibility, considering the girl of the night. Cas feels relieved he can take care of him.
Friday night dinner with the devoted church members. Castiel has almost forgotten about it. He doesn't say anything and tries to ignore the much more pleasant prospects he could think of.
“Lisa can’t understand that,” Dean continues like he hasn’t heard what Cas just said or how his voice trembled. “Women can’t understand male friendship, man. They don’t understand the togetherness… and…” Dean thoughts trail off, his eyes heavy lidded and unfocused. “It’s just- ...huh… you know what I mean, don’t you?”
“Sorry, honey, I wanted to do something for you, but - uh-, we got carried away,” he smiles apologetically.
“Who understands the subtle humor?” Dean prompts.
“Maybe we should get you to bed too,” Cas attempts to smile but it’s not entirely successful, “You’re too old to sleep drunk on the floor.”
“Relax, I’m teasing you, bitch.”
“Hm, I joke about it, but-”
“Yeah,” Dean’s smiles despite himself, “Bye, bitch.”
“And I forever will be grateful for that, but Dean, look at me and say you love me,” she fixes him with sorrowful eyes and Dean’s words stick in his throat. “Tell me you wouldn't rather be with Castiel right now.” She forces the words out, Dean is sure this is painful for her no matter how often they’ve done this in the past.
“Sure, that’s why your pretty face is the color of sour milk?” Cas teases him, while putting the screwdrivers away.
“No,” she cuts him off, the edge in her voice could cut skin. “You are an excellent boyfriend.” He blinks confused. Again, not what he expected. Lisa even looks sincere, no sarcasm leaking through the words. “And Castiel Novak is a very lucky man.”
“Thank you,” Castiel strains through his teeth, feeling Hannah’s nails dig in his arm through his suit jacket. “I’m pleased as always to be here,” he forces himself to say.
“Gabriel,” he remarks shortly.
Surprisingly enough this fic is not dead. I've been trying to get back into writing but without much success. I plan on doing an October drabble challenge, with a short drabble 100-500 words for each day. I'm looking forward to any prompts anyone may have
“Here you go,” he says, sitting down perhaps a tad too close to Dean. Dean takes the water and the pill and Cas doesn’t take notice of his throat moving as he swallows. “I’m sorry about Lisa.”
Cas clears his throat, looking uncertain “A scarf, I think she’ll like it.”
“I did but they’re taking too long. You’re the first number in his favourites-”
“And this night is only getting better,” Dean grunts, despair in his voice.
He should get concentrated. He refocuses again, gripping Hannah’s hips and starting to grind slowly. Would Dean wrap his arms tight around those girls, holding them warm and secure? Would he be demanding or would he be gentle while exploring every inch of their skin? Would he stare into their souls with those green eyes-
“I know, I know, your spidey senses are tingling whenever you two are on the same continent.” It’s Dean’s turn to roll his eyes and groan.
They still keep him awake though.
“Why are you so fixated on getting me to Seattle?” Dean grips the steering wheel. He’s not really comfortable with change. Never has been.
“Why wouldn’t I be?,” Dean flashes a forced smile, the kind that pisses Cas off.
“What’s ridiculous about it?” There is something particular in her voice that indicates this is a trick question. That’s why Dean stalls.
“I didn’t know how cold it’d be here.”
“Yeah” Cas agrees, heart heavy.
In the language of the Novaks the particular tone shift Gabriel just used can only mean one thing. “Where is she?” Castiel doesn’t bother to hide the worry in his voice.
Bartholomew frowns for a second and he looks about to give a preach but then the lines on his forehead smooth and he simply shakes his head. “You, the youth today, are so liberal” Attempted mildness doesn’t suit him at all.
Dean hesitates a little before saying “She’s fine, it’s… uh, good.” He decides to skip the fight about Lisa accusing him of getting a blow job at the back of Benny’s bar from a sweet 19 year-old thing with curly hair named Cassie. Not that Dean would say no to the offer but it wasn’t the case and the girl seemed a tad too young for him anyway. Cas was gone for 7 weeks, he didn’t need to know every detail of Dean’s life.
“Yeah, ok,” Dean says resigned, catching his gaze again but neither of them makes any effort to move. There’s some sadness in Dean’s bloodshot hazy eyes, everything in Cas aches.
“Good, good,” Barth looks genuinely pleased. For some reason that is beyond Castiel’s understanding of Christianity neither Zach nor Bartholomew do a lot of charity work “As I’ve always said whoever needs the help of God should come to His home not expect God to go to him.”
“Hey,” she says softly.
“I don’t want to go either,” he settles for saying.
In the front compartments of the suitcase Cas usually keeps the few comfort items that remind him of home. He brings one out when counting the days becomes too much. There’s a small Bible with a leather cover. He rarely opens it but its familiarity is calming. There is also an iron cross with intricate ornaments Hannah gave him for their one year anniversary. It's no bigger than 3-4 inches but Castiel never wears jewelry anyway. There is also a very old, but carefully folded napkin with a painting of a dove in textile paint on it. That was one of the last things Anna worked on before she left. She was just a teenager but she dumped the opportunity for a good art school and a successful future to travel the world and do her thing. Castiel misses her dearly and often when waiting in an airport he thinks of her. He tries to capture her free spirit when going sightseeing at every place he goes. After a while it doesn’t feel freeing though, it’s rather daunting.
“I’ll go wherever you go.”
He watches the morning unfold and thinks this is as close to a religious experience as he has had in a while. The more he travels, the more people he meets, the more wary he becomes of what his Christian community here in Kansas is. So now Castiel doesn’t really share his thoughts on the matter. He just knows that belief in something greater than himself gives him strength and the celestial intent puts mundane matters into perspective so he’s not overwhelmed by them. Watching the sun move across the sky, he realizes he’s a tiny human on a tiny planet in the enormous universe. That notion is soothing and somehow liberating.
His face scrunches in displeasure as the alcohol burns its way down his chest to the stomach and Dean gives him an amused look.
The smugness rubs Cas the wrong way but he manages to bring some lightness to his voice when saying “You’re not God, Barth.”
“I am,” Dean announces like he’s announcing the discovery of America, “But, I am serious, man, I’ve never had a friend like you.” His eyes are strangely fixated on Cas, looking more clear than it could be expected. The stare is intense, making the sudden pause even more noticeable.
“He’s really beat,” Cindy says, visibly relieved that this burden is off her chest.
They do the main frame on Wednesday afternoon, digging the holes for the pillars and screwing them in. Once or twice Cas notices despite himself the way Dean’s t-shirt stretches across his shoulders or how his neck is thick but elegant. Those moments aren’t really new but before he thought it was just some unwanted fragments of his mind, bothersome but entirely unconnected to reality. Now he knows where they can lead. He cannot fool himself anymore that this is a normal way to look at your friend. Guilt fills him at those moments and he chases them away with thoughts of Hannah and his duties to her.  It leaves him kind of empty and he strains himself to fill the void with work, hoping Dean doesn’t notice.
“Yeah,” Dean says but doesn’t continue, just stares at the floor.
“As I said, he’s lucky to have you. I hope you two can work it out.”
“Hm,” Dean smiles again, much more warmth in it this time, “come on in, I wanna see.”
“What do you do here so early?” Usually no one sees Gabriel Novak out of bed before noon.
Dean moves closer, pressing their bodies together.  Castiel trembles, but is not letting go, not in a million years. His hands travel up and down Dean’s back, dig into his hair and he just wants, wants, wants so bad. His entire being is on fire. Dean’s erection presses against Cas’ tight, hips rocking slowly.  The friction against his own desperately hard cock draws a wave of pleasure unknown until now. He urges himself not to moan but Dean lets a barely audible sigh, mumbling something incomprehensible.
WARNINGS! Alcohol abuse in this one! Also some anti religion sentiments. The Church Cas goes to in this fic is part fanaticism and part pop psychology crap. Yes that's Jordan Peterson (do not read if you're a fan of his), like straight up citations. What I hate most about his speeches is that it all sounds reasonable until it doesn't. I don't think people are inherently stupid to fall into these fanatic traps. something in there resonates with them and the toxic crap just slips in
“Yes, in a bit.” That comes out more drily than expected.
“What’s up, bitch?” He greets his brother.
“Dean!” Cas exclaims, turning around.
Hannah eyes the empty bottles on the floor, then her husband and shakes her head. “Don’t mind me,” she says, rubbing affectionately Cas’ shoulder, “I’m still having an appointment with a bubble bath and a book for tonight.”
thing. Some days, especially after a night of heavy drinking, Deans hates that he can’t do his thing from home.
Bartholomew’s eyes each individual face around the table. They stop on Castiel a second longer than the rest.
“Are you ok, Dean?” Cas asks, frowning.
“How’s it going, brother?” Benny asks, pouring him another and leaving the bottle next to his glass.
“Cheers to you, pal,” he chuckles. Their shoulders are pressed together and Cas can feel Dean’s shaking with laughter.
“A-huh.” Charlie shakes her head and Dean doesn’t bother with the subtleties of her expression, “One of these days you’ll surprise her real good.” For that she gets a grease rag thrown in her face.
Sam sighs. Dean bets he’d be rolling his eyes if he was there. “So, get this,” Whenever Sammy starts with these words something mildly annoying is coming Dean’s way. He uses it when he has some idea no one asked him to have. “I checked out a crash course at Seattle University. It’s about business management and requires no-”
“Great… sure…” Dean rambles, his eyes drift somewhere down and to the left. “It’s just… yeah, man.” Suddenly he gathers Castiel in a tight strong hug. Cas wraps his arms hesitantly around Dean, feeling a faint ache in his ribs from the squeeze Dean’s giving him. That’s not weird but it’s not usual for them either. Cas’ muscles refuse to relax as he feels some manly pats on his back. “Just I love you, man,” Dean sounds wasted, he probably won’t remember a thing in the morning.
“Oh, if you’re hungry we have pizza on the way,” Cas gives her a quick warm look.
Dean finds himself at Benny’s at around 9 p.m. He’s got a tight black tee and his favourite red flannel on. Domestic life with Lisa has led to a little pudge in his tummy area, he notices with displeasure. This is gonna be rectified, starting tomorrow. Also he hasn’t been drinking so much lately so his alcohol tolerance is lower than usual. Not that he’s a lightweight or anything. No, sir. He’s just dizzy after his 4th whiskey on an empty stomach.
“No.” Dean presses the heels of his hands to his eyes.
“Be careful.”
“Morning, Han’” Gabriel takes her hands and lands a brotherly peck on her cheek, “Though I guess you’re Castiel’s hon’.” He laughs at his own joke and Hannah actually laughs with him. “I got you what we talked about,” Gabirel nods toward the package, “and a little something sweet for the soul.”
“What?”
fence is broken anyway.”
“I think I should go,” he says when the second bottle is halfway gone and the last Doors album ends.
Dean looks at him, a bright smile on his face, “That would be great,” then he catches Cas’ eyes and his expression dims.“But that location probably won’t be Lawrance, right?”
giggles. Jet lag must be settling in because his disheveled head is resting on the back of the couch, eyes half lidded. Dean catches himself staring and blames the beer.
“Maybe if I take that promotion…” he trails off, his insides freezing with the thought of leaving Lawrance permanently.
“Isn’t that camera broken?” Cas furrows his brows at the low ticking noise coming from the camera.
“I am there when it matters,” Dean’s head is getting hotter by the minute. “I was there when Ben needed to go to the hospital. I was there when you were about to lose your house. I was there to kick out your dickhead of an ex who was threatening both of you, guys.”
“That’s right, baby,” Dean lowers his voice, “Oh my-”
“So where am I getting with this?” Barth slows a little, his breathing fast, “There’s the idea of what you might do about all that. It’s the oldest story in the book. Get yourself together. Transcend you suffering. See if you can be some kind of hero. That’s the way forward. That’s the only way forward as far as God can tell. That’s what’s being attacked by the godless postmodernists. Drinking. Lusting. Avoiding responsibility. That’s what turns the tragedy into hell.So look out, because they know exactly what they’re doing and why they’re doing it. Don’t let them drag you down.”
Their eyes meet for a moment and Dean’s glass stops midair. Dean blinks the confusion away.
“Yeah, me too. You should’ve heard her,” Dean rambles, his voice getting low. “The shit she accused me of! She was jealous of you!”
“She broke up with me,” Dean almost actually growls which is more or less laughable. He sits heavily next to Charlie, arms crossed like an angry 8 years old.
“Please don’t start,” Castiel frowns, “We’ve talked about this. The alcohol, the whoring. I’m not going ‘all missionary on your ass’,” he emphasizes the last words with sarcasm. “No pun intended.”
There’s a fire in Bartholomew’s entire frame that is not usual for a mild mannered preacher of Good. While Zachariah has that middle management vibe to him, Barth is all thunder and talks in easy to understand powerful sentences.
God dammit! Dean turns to the other side, exhales loudly and stares into the darkness. Messing with his fucking head, that’s what she’s doing. Now he feels a pang of guilt for every time he has noticed the blue of Cas’ eyes or the sturdiness of his frame. This isn’t anything abnormal! It doesn’t make him fucking queer,alright? It’s not like he’s purposefully looking. His father made sure Dean knows what is acceptable and what is not. He doesn’t imagine Cas when…-
“It will be mostly done!” Cas raises his voice nudging his shoulder, “I won’t be gone that long!” Dean let out a resigned chuckle,studying the grass beneath his feet, and something in Castiel’s chest
“Lookie, lookie what we’ve got here,” Castiel jerks in his seat, turning in the direction of the unexpected voice.
“Probably not,” Cas confirms quietly.
It takes Dean 10 minutes and another whiskey to take the courage to approach the girl.
“Charlie, today would be a great day for your home office thing,” Dean spits out, not looking at her.
“What shall we do to surprise the missus?” he asks, falling heavily on the couch and getting his boots off.
“It’s only a few weeks. It’ll help you with the garage and everything.” Sam is speaking at 100 miles an hour. “You can stay at my place. You can take Lisa and Ben too, there’s enough room.”
“We, the mortals, are thrilled to see you then,” Dean wipes his hands on a rag and sits cross legged directly on the ground.
“Women, man,” Dean smirks after a while but it doesn’t reach his eyes, “Can’t live with them, can’t live without them.”
“Promise me, promise me, Castiel,” she chants against his chest.
So he forgot about the dinner party with her friends? What’s the big deal? It wasn’t like Dean left her hanging. Her friends were there, he wasn’t strictly needed. He was just enjoying an evening with his friend. Lisa should have been happy for him. He would’ve if he was in her shoes. If you love somebody you’d like them to have a good time, right? She was just unreasonable.
catching glimpses of the light in Dean’s kitchen window, but finally gave up and came here. When Dean doesn’t answer after the third ring on the bell, Cas pokes about the doormat, searching for the spare key. The Impala is parked nearby, there’s the muffled sound of music coming from the inside, so by all signs Dean is home, there’s nothing wrong in Cas letting himself in.
“You work too much,” she softens.
Dean hums in his sleep, content, and Cas doesn’t dare to move. It would be best to get up and let his friend sleep off his intoxication but Dean is so beautiful, kindness and  childish innocence radiating from him in his sleep,  it’s painful. Some days Castiel wonders what he’s done to deserve the friendship of this incredible man. At this moment nothing in the world exists anymore. He’s light headed and in a lapse of judgement plants a kiss on Dean’s forehead. His lips press to the warm skin before his tireless brain starts rambling again. Dean’s grip tightens and he pulls Cas down into a tight lipped kiss. Then he opens his mouth, catching Cas’ bottom lip between his. Cas isn’t even attempting to resist, he just relaxes into the sensation. Dean’s gentle. Not tentative but surprisingly gentle, tasting like whiskey. This is probably very wrong on so many levels but Castiel can’t bring himself to care. He’s not even that drunk and he lets it happen. This, both of them laying in bed, pressed together, kissing with more intimacy than Cas has ever experienced. This is perfect and it shatters his entire being to tiny little pieces and then scatters them all across the universe. What kind of God or human would damn this kind of connection and call himself good? If hell is the price to pay for one more moment like that, right now Cas would gladly agree.
“How did you-,” Cas is about to ask how does she know about Lisa but before he can finish the girl interrupts:
“Lis, please,” Dean repeats but his higher brain functions are out of order right now. “You know Cas is not often here. I had to see him. But I’ll make it up to you, I promise. Just tell me what you need and I’ll do it.”
“You’re my family,” she whispers, trembling in his arms “Take me away, please. Away from them too.”
They get stuck in the afternoon rush hour on the way back but Dean doesn’t mind it as much because listening to Cas is like having a podcast on. Sometimes an oblivious kid hosts the said podcast, sometimes a grumpy old man, most of the time - an extremely weird but wickedly clever engineer. Dean listens about the Jaffa port of Tel Aviv, the Yemenite market, something about the Sabbath as well as a brief review of the EL AL flight menu, solar panels in the desert, new environmental regulation in energetics and the inability of some people to talk quietly on the plane. Dean doesn’t have to pitch in almost at all. That’s fine though, his life is way more boring.
Before Castiel can express his trepidation about the story, Hannah strides in, fully ready for work. “Gabriel, don’t speak nonsense!” She smiles warmly, much warmer than usual.
“We went home, and we-, uh-, then he-,” a pause, then a whine “He passed out, he’s breathing but- úuh, I…”
“How’s Lisa?” Cas asks after about 40 minutes.
“Yes,” he answers without hesitation, “She’s kind of controlling and has so many expectations from me.”
“Will you be happy?” Castiel prompts.
Dean nods, getting the suitcase from Baby’s trunk. “Basement?”
"Actually, you saved me," he smiles and takes her hand.
Then finally, he appears. Cas is dragging his suitcase, wearing the ugly beige trenchcoat neither Dean nor Hannah will ever admit that they are fond of. Sometimes, even though rarely, the best friend and the wife agree with each other.
For ages his mother has talked to him about God and angels and divine plan knowing right from wrong. All his siblings, as well as him, are named after angels so they are constantly reminded to lead a righteous life. When Castiel was 16 he told his mother God had much more important business than monitoring teenagers’ masturbatory habits. She slapped him across the face. Strangely enough that was one of the few instances Castiel remembered her initiating physical contact.
“It is not an accident that the symbol of the Western civilization is a man who is unfairly nailed to a cross and tortured. Life is suffering and every religious man in history will tell you that.”
“Cas…,” he drags out, sounding like the word physically hurts him.
‘“You…” Zachariah chuckles and points his index finger at him, “We should watch out for you not to stray too far, right?”
He too goes to church though, listens to the preachers and tries to pray. Coming from a very religious family he doesn’t have too much of a choice in believing. Half of his life is built around the Christian community. He found his wife there. He found his job through a recommendation from his mother’s pastor Zachariah Adler. What he couldn’t find in church is peace for his worried mind.
He’ll stay just for a bit, until Dean falls asleep with the sleep of the functioning alcoholic. Again, he probably won’t remember anything in the morning. Cas wishes he wouldn’t either. At first they stay quiet, in companionable silence then Dean gives him a look from under his lashes.
“Maybe I miss my brother,” Sam says simply and God dammit, he sounds sincere.
They’re over halfway home when Dean finally stirs in the shotgun seat. He groans as if hell itself has swallowed him whole. Cas just gives him a brief glare. Until now he managed to concentrate on the road but he’s afraid that if he speaks he won’t be able to shut up. Either way at the moment any lecturing would be useless.
“Your mom will be very proud.” Hannah concludes, looking neither too happy nor too sad about it.
He pushes his doubts away as he explores the various assets of her body. Cindy’s chatty but horny and switches between dirty talk and random giggly rambling while they kiss on the couch. It doesn’t take long for Dean to decide he’s had enough and push her abruptly on her back, looming over her.
“Sure,” Castiel really doesn’t know what to say. “I’m waiting for Hannah.”
“That’s… um, good,” Cas swallows hard.
“You look like a ray of sunshine today,” Charlie remarks sometime around noon.
Castiel sighs and studies his coffee. “There may be an opportunity for moving up management,” he says after a pause. “It will mean permanent location. Better money.”
“Fine, Anna,” he accentuates the name, “she will come home.”
“You do realize I’m a lesbian, don’t you?” she gives him a pointed look, raising her eyebrow.
It doesn’t take another round of drinks for them to head to Cindy’s place, Dean arm around her shoulders.
Their eyes meet and it feels as intense as it always does.
rambling comes to a halt, as he glances at Cas.  “What does Hannah think?” It’s like the question just surfaced in his brain.
“You’re probably right.”
“You’re so devoted to him. You’d do anything for him. It’s endearing, really.” Lisa’s anger is palpable but nevertheless her lip quivers and the angry tears in her eyes come dangerously close to falling.
As Hannah rushes around, getting ready for work, Castiel stares out the kitchen window. This time of year the sun rises early but the clouds are still painted in pinks and golds over the pine trees. Castiel loves his huge backyard. He feels calmer and close to nature whenever he’s there. That’s part of what makes this particular place on the planet his home. The place he always comes back to.
The whiskey is doing a good job at warming Castiel up.
“She’s our sister, Cas, not Voldemort,” his brother snorts.
“Let’s gather around the table,” Barth concludes with his most good-thempered expression.
“We’re surprising his wife,” Dean says.
A warm feeling rises in Castiel. Sober Dean never says things like that. It’s good to know them nevertheless.
“Me being gay for him or something,” Dean pouts and purposefully turns his face away.
Dean hums, eyes still closed, head resting on the cushion. “Great”
“Yeah, I missed you too,” Cas echoes.
“Are you drunk?” Cas asks almost conversationally.
“Cas,” Dean’s mouth falls agape. It’s a Lenapure leather cleaning set, a fancy one, balsam and every spoil available, “Dude, that’s great.”
“How long will you stay this time?” Dean asks when they pull into the driveway of his house.
“It will all click.”
“Better?” he asks after Dean takes a few sips.
“Yeah.., sure. But it’s under control now.” It doesn’t sound as convincing as Sam is intending, but Dean doesn’t push it. “Just promise me, you’ll at least give the course a thought?”
Cas digs clumsily through his suitcase, still ditched on the floor, and pulls out a wrinkled package. He hands it to Dean without really looking at him.
“Some of us have to actually work, y’a know.”
“I’m happy for you.” That incredibly normal thing turns out to be incredibly hard to say. He feels a visceral cold going through him.
“Oh my God, Castiel,” Hannah exclaims and puts her purse down, “I heard some noise coming from down here and was frightened it could be a raccoon.” She attempts to go for a hug but Cas is too busy shooting and cursing Dean for inadequate game reflexes.
“Hey,” Dean says quietly. He looks confused but one of his hands comes to grip Cas’ arm “What are we doing?”
“No way, Jose,” Gabe wrinkles his nose. “There’s a reason she calls me, after all.”
Castiel does go to church but just before noon and just in order to pick up Hannah for a meal. And it’s actually the foundation’s building, full of spacious offices with white walls, nothing but the occasional crucifix on the wall gives away this is a religious institution. Hannah is currently in a meeting so Castiel just sits on one of the nice couches and waits for her. He’s already getting bored of the pamphlet about a scholarship program for chaste youths. Dean would laugh at that. Zachariah, their pastor, in an ill fitted suit, balding head shining, strides to greet him.
“It’s not like I would’ve had any fun at her party anyway. Of course I’d want to spend the evening with you. That’s normal. That’s what a normal guy would do with his guy friend - drink beer, play games. Besides, you’re fun,” Dean squeezes Cas’ shoulder, giving him a very serious look “we have fun together. Has anyone told you how fun you are?”
There's a machine that moves over him, but stays a not terrible distance. At least 5 inches from his body. There's a few whirring sounds and clicks, like you would hear from a camera and then it's done. It's quiet for a bit and then the doctor is in the room, helping him sit up and handing his clothes back. "Mr. Winchester, I have some unfortunate news. You have something called Pulmonary Fibrosis. It's a lung disease which is what is causing your struggle to breathe. Your other issues are symptoms of what you have and it's been spreading for a long time." She murmurs to him, looking very sad.
Castiel gives Dean a surprise and a release.
Glancing up at him, he chews his bottom lip. “I have a boyfriend.” He says slowly, not sure what Sam’s reaction was going to be. Though, Dean knew that Sam was pansexual and was very supportive of the LGTVQIA+ community, it still didn’t help calm his own internalized homophobia towards himself and fear of rejection.
Before Dean knew it, he was being pressed into the couch but also against Castiel. So Dean could feel every part of the other male's body. Castiel pulled his lips away and Dean found himself trying to follow his lips to keep kissing him. Castiel just smirks at him and starts to sit up, moving Dean onto his stomach and his face pretty pressed against a pillow. "You look cute like this, Dean, but you haven't been a very good babysitter, have you?" Castiel says lowly from behind Dean.
Dean and Castiel deal with the kiss and Dean finds out some news about Castiel and deals with it well, but he doesn’t deal with his emotions the way he should.
Dean was back in the hospital, smiling widely as he felt Cas’ hand stroke along the knuckle of his own.
Yes. Giggles.
”Castiel Novak, you’re the burger to my pie~” Dean says dramatically.
”Don’t worry Dean, Sam is living. Not just surviving. He’s living now, because of you.” Eileen says from the seat beside Dean.
I’m sorry, y’all.
We take a trip a few months into the visit, Castiel's health is improving, while Dean stays in a bit of a worse condition than he was in when he got to the hospital.
TAGS: S M U T, self-esteem issues, soft times.
"Castiel, I-What- Do you know what's happening?" Dean's voice had went up in pitch from his embarrassment.
Castiel. He was there. Thank God or whoever the hell existed that made Castiel happen. Dean smiles and blushes at the words as he takes them in. Castiel smiles when he sees the reaction. “I was going to bring pie, but Gabriel accidentally ate it-“ he says as he walks over to Dean, close enough that Dean could touch.
”What do you do?” Castiel asks.
"I would never forget something so bright and beautiful," Castiel murmurs gently against Dean's mouth.
!" Castiel says excitedly and Dean is smiling so brightly that his cheeks hurt.
Castiel just seems to know because he takes a few heavy steps, passing around to the other side. His breath hitches and his heart stops functioning and at that moment, he wished it would.
“Mornin’ Cas,” Dean chimes with a mouthful and turns to see Castiel with a smile on his face. He looked better than yesterday.
Dean bites the inside of his cheek and tilts his head to the side. "It went good, I got rid of the werewolves." He says with a gentle chuckle "I know Sam would've laughed at how they were vegans during human form." He replies, hearing Castiel laugh through the speaker.
Dean: Come visit me for a celebratory pudding?
Fawn giggles. "You'll see when he visits," She assures before leaving a water and a container of pudding before leaving.
The nod Cas gets is overly excited and added on with a "please,".
“I do say that and I also say that you need to cuddle me! Right now!” He demands playfully.
Castiel could decipher it. And he jumped up from his seat quickly, going to grab his keys and speed like hell.
It was quiet while they all waited for the same thing. Not with anxiety, but with the contentment they had been searching for all their lives.
Castiel looks up from some book Dean thought was boring to smile and move over to the end of Dean's bed. "Fine, but we both know I'm going to beat you, Winchester." He teases and Dean giggles, trying to ignore the dull wince of pain he got from it.
Squeezing his eyes closed tightly, he brings the phone to his ear. Barely hearing himself answer the man who asked if he was speaking to Castiel Novak.
To Sam’s credit, he didn’t look phased. He just looked in awe. “Was it that guy you used to share a room with? The nurses were gossiping or talking about it when I came through. May I ask what your sexuality is? If you want to tell me of course, but I love you and I’ll support you no matter what of course-“ Sam was ranting and it made Dean’s eyes water.
”Actually I was told earlier that I’m allowed to be discharged today.” He says softly, Dean straightens and looks at him with wide eyes.
Not that he saw Castiel like a little brother, but Dean did feel care for Castiel. Just in a different way.
The kiss gets a bit heated quickly, Cas' tongue exploring Dean's mouth and his hands running closer to Dean's hips. "Is this okay?" he murmurs against Dean's mouth.
“Oh shit- that didn’t happen. Love you, sorry for sneezing on your camera, I love you.” Before Dean kisses the camera and the video ends.
There was Castiel, shaggier hair than he had currently. His face was kind of zoomed in, but he looked very happy and very tanned compared to the more pale version he knew. "This is my first video on my awesome and totally not old camcorder, I mean this is the twenty first century! Don't let this technology die! Anyway, I wanted to share my religious experience with you..."
a bad babysitter." Castiel says lowly, finishing up his thought.
Fawn smiles slyly. “It’s a surprise.”
Castiel's
of Castiel, the sounds between them were very dirty. Dean could hear Cas groaning behind him, he could hear himself moaning, and he could hear the sounds of Cas' hips pressing against Dean as he sped up. Dean was trembling because he knew he wasn't going to hold out for much longer and he could tell that Castiel knew it too because Castiel was going faster now, moving his lips to the side of Dean's neck, sucking and licking his skin, enough to leave some lasting marks.
”So we’re a thing?” He grins and Dean hides his face, groaning in embarrassment.
He knew, with a deep peace through the tearing pain.
"It is okay! The only other nickname I've gotten is Cassie from my older brother and I find it insufferable." Castiel chuckles out.
WARNINGS: Soft talk that may be seen as a form of suicidal thoughts.
"My name is Castiel Novak," He introduces himself.
Castiel must have been staring for moments longer than he thought because Dean turns around and is beside him in a minute, hugging him and burying his face against his shoulder. “Breakfast is ready,” he muses and presses a kiss to Cas’ cheek which makes a wide smile appear on both male’s faces.
”Well, tomorrow my brother is supposed to come to visit. You can meet him. He has very chaotic energy though.” Castiel warns and Dean laughs softly, trying to stay quiet and not put so much pressure on his lungs.
And coffee.
Sam laughs and nods, fitting himself into the backseat with Eileen as Dean and Cas get into the front.
One of Castiel's hands stays on his hip and the other is sliding gently into Dean's pants, palming him through the thin layer of boxer material. "Tell me if you need me to stop, love." Castiel says gently as he moves his mouth down Dean's jaw.
Eventually the vehicle slows to a stop and Dean feels Castiel's hand gently on his thigh. "I'm going to get out of the car and then I'll get you, okay? Keep the blindfold on." Castiel says and kisses his cheek before the door is opened and there's some shifting.
”Dean?” Castiel’s voice knocks him out of the dazed trance he was in, blinking up at Castiel, who’s wide smile was now formed into a concerned tilt.
"You're not funny, Dean. I don't want you to die. You're my family." He says, voice cracking a bit in sadness and Dean couldn't help but react to his sad tone, eyes watering.
After begrudgingly and slightly curiously (okay super curiously) getting ready, Fawn leads him down to the main floor. It feels weird to be out of his room, especially holding onto a rolling machine that wasn’t like the ones other people were dragging through the halls. This one looked like a rolling backpack.
"I want to do so many things to you, Dean," Castiel says to the male, running a hand through his soft brown hair, smiling when Dean lets out a soft purring sound.
"Will you let me, Dean? Will you let me love you and make you feel good?" He questions, tightening his grip in Dean's hair and watching as Dean's eyes flutter closed at the slight tug.
He was currently texting Cas about the updates.
Dean grins even more and holds him tighter. “I would love to make my dishes for you,” he says sweetly, kissing him again, quick but full of enough love to make stars explode.
He stares at Castiel as he pulls out a little camcorder. "It's fully charged and there's a lot of embarrassing stuff about me on it, but- It'll give you some more insight on me until I can share all my life moments with you on our first date," He says, almost shy.
"Oh. I have pneumonia, it's gotten worse over the past while so I'm staying here till it's under control. Don't worry, the case I have isn't contagious." He assures and Dean gives a small smile at his assurances.
Where Dean wished he could never leave this mindset, he felt like he could breathe, he felt like he belonged. With Castiel.
He opened the screen door and walked in, the actual door already opened and pressed against the light grey wall lined with dark wood frames. He takes quiet steps to the kitchen. Dean thought quietly to himself that he should’ve been on guard and ready to fight, but he felt safe. He felt okay. His steps paused in the entrance of the pristine room, sparkling in the sunlight coming through the window above the sink.
Dean blinks, he absolutely did not want to go to the hospital. It took him a week to finally get to the walk-in clinic. "Uh-now?" He asks slowly, hoping it wasn't now.
Dean feels a soft cool rush along his face as his door is opened and Castiel takes his hand gently to help him out. He's being led somewhere, his oxygen tank on his back. Curious, he stays quiet. Wanting auditory clues.
”Heya, Sammy, just wanted to tell you that... I hope you’re kicking ass in school.” He takes a sharp breath and coughs softly.
"Fine, but just know that I'm not happy with that. You're more important than school for me, Dean."
-There is a small death joke, I only put it in there because I know that's how Dean would be coping
Sam seemed to realize what was going on, because he was doing the exact same thing. “We couldn’t have done anything.” He says and Castiel nods, not wanting to say anymore.
Dean calls Castiel with a soft message.
Sam pulls away and rubs the back of his neck with an innocent shrug. “I missed you, jerk. And you’re sick and we take care of each other.” He replies.
Dean's whole body tenses up and he glances around for anything that could be a weapon. Barely anything, despite seeing no baby anywhere, this whole place is baby-proofed.  He moves over the door, if he goes down, he can go down swinging. He opens the door and his whole body goes from tense to just fully frozen. "Cas?" Dean questions, shocked at what he's seeing.
It had happened just the night before and now here they were. Cuddling in Dean's bed, Dean curled up against Castiel's front. "Cas," He says gently.
Still nothing.
touch always started a spark in him. He felt the light kisses from Castiel along his neck until they reached his mouth, hands now removing his own clothes. Dean just watches him, he was gorgeous inside and out and Dean didn't understand how it was possible.
”I know you miss him, Sam, but he’s in a good Place, I feel it.” Eileen says and signs to him.
It took Dean a moment to realize that Castiel was shifting Dean until he was on his knees, but his head was still against the pillow. It took Dean a few seconds to realize that Castiel was tugging down his sweatpants; it took Dean barely a second to know that he really wanted this with Castiel. He wasn't sure if this was for real or not, though it sure felt real when Castiel's hands went to cup Dean's ass and Dean felt a breath against his ass and he had a full body tremble, he needed Castiel somehow, right now. "No underwear, Dean? You're so bad, aren't you? You want to be punished." Castiel whispers just loud enough that Dean can hear it, "Don't you?" Castiel adds on.
”by the way, Cas. I’m showering first.” Dean says and turns to see Castiel giving him a competitive glance.
Dean shifts with a wince, sore. Maybe tomorrow he’ll wake up and realize it was all a dream.
His Dean. The Dean that’s gone.
(See the end of the chapter for
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel snorts. “I’m fucking hot as hell, cute? That’s you- though I’d say you’re more on the adorable side.” He says, nosing Dean’s hair gently and pressing a kiss to his head.
There was Castiel, drenched in sweat, deep circles under his eyes and his skin significantly more grey contrast to his sun-kissed skin in the last video. "So, I think I've come down with a fever and can't really move too much without feeling stabbed... also not to be graphic. But whatever I'm coughing up- looks like a melted alien." He whispers close to the camera. Dean notes that his lips are tinted a light blue and extremely chapped. He chuckles at Castiel's description of presumably- phlegm. "Anyway, Gabriel is on his way over to drive me to the hospital, but I think he's just overreacting because I told him I hadn't eaten in a few days-" Cas is cut off by Gabriel walking in a hazmat suit.
He's allowing himself to be even more vulnerable with Castiel, but in a very different way. He's allowing Castiel to show him just how much he loves him. Which he will.
He wanted Dean.
Castiel's hands slid along his thighs, keeping his gaze on Dean's face, watching his reactions as he slowly licks along his length, he happily listens to the hitched breath Dean gives. He gives alight smile, not wasting time and taking him into his mouth, all the way. Having no gag reflex had finally come in handy for the angel. Dean's sounds got louder, moaning and squirming against the bedding. Castiel pulled off for a moment, stroking him gently so he stayed stimulated. "You should be very proud of this
”Is it good steak? Because if the hospital ruins this for me, I’m suing them.” Dean says in fake seriousness.
Dr. Jackie doesn't seem phased, she's probably dealt with worse tantrums. "It means that at the rate this disease is going at, there's a chance that you may not survive more than 3 years. Now I'm going to help you get admitted into special treatment, if you have any family or friends, you may call them, ask for them to get some of your stuff. We'll set you up in a room..."
Dean keeps his head tilted up to look at the moon and the stars, watching his vision darken, his throat tight, air wasn’t as available, his limbs started to grow heavy and he saw the shadow of a reaper looming over him.
Finally, he had the nerve to take his phone and slide it to Sam's contact. He hesitates before he does though, glancing towards the other male in the room. The man was reading the bible of all things. Dean resists the urge to roll his eyes. Why would the male hold faith over a God that obviously doesn't give a damn that he could possibly be dying in the bed beside Dean. Despite the slight negative thought, he clears his throat softly and watches as the man's electric blue eyes look up and pierce into Dean's very soul,
”Don’t work yourself to the grave, anyway- I love ya, bitch.” He says softly and hangs up, sighing deeply and wincing at the pressure against his chest.
Hearing footsteps, he turns to see Eileen and gives her a smile as a greeting, still purring and leaning into Cas’ touches.
Dean, feeling like he needed oxygen, slowly pulled away, feeling the slick of their kiss hesitantly breaking as well. He doesn’t move far and presses his forehead against Cas’, heavy breaths despite not needing to breath. His eyes were closed and he just felt the sensations.
Dean had been his as much as Castiel was Dean’s. This wasn’t the ending he wanted for them, he wanted them to grow old in a little cabin, maybe adopting, maybe not. He wanted to show Dean how to plant flowers properly and he wanted Dean to show him his love for Western movies. He wanted that. He still wants that. But that wasn’t the plan. Their ending was good, even if it wasn’t the ending he wanted.
Pulling out his phone carefully, eyes squinting at the slightly blurry screen, he clicks call for his brother. It goes to voice mail after a long series of rings and he inhales as deep as he can so he can talk.
Cas: I will be coming to visit soon, but I have something much better than pudding. And it’s not pie either.
Dean shovelled his food into his mouth so fast, Castiel was genuinely afraid he was going to choke or stop breathing. Dean didn’t notice the worry, in his own little world of syrup and pancakes covered in sugar.
Dean Rowen Winchester held Sam that day too.
"Dean Winchester, hello, I'm Dr. Tacer. Tell me, what seems to be the issue?" He says after sitting at the desk.
Castiel chuckled softly. “I was, planting seeds in the garden in the backyard. I know how much you appreciate food with no pesticides... and even though you don’t need to eat, I thought you’d like to make your famous cuisines every once and awhile.” He says, seeming sheepish now, as if Dean hadn’t fallen more in love with him.
Suddenly, something in the air shifted and Eileen was the first to make a move, running over to the thing... or person who changed the air around them. There was a sound of a kiss and soft squeals of excitement and hellos.
Dean: Put me on some new meds so I don’t breath like dying Walrus.
Sam pauses for a moment, seeming to notice Dean’s mind was somewhat elsewhere. “Hey, what’s going on?” He says, nudging Dean’s arm.
Snorting but carefully maneuvering himself into the hospital bed, Castiel wraps his arms around Dean and inhales softly against his hair. He smelled good.
Dean looks around the room for a moment. "I know Sam, just do it for me, okay?"
”Cas! Guess what- okay. So- I was thinking, you me, we go buy a whole ass pie. Okay? Any kind. Preferably fruit if I have any choice though- and Then- we do like Lady and the Tramp style but with PIE! Like you eat half and I eat half and then there’s one piece left-“ Dean was rambling and giggling like he was the funniest one on the planet.
”Sam, I have to go. Please contact me if you... are planning on doing anything for him. I just need to think.” Not waiting on an answer, he hangs up.
"Yes," Castiel starts, his hands trailing up Dean's shirt and somehow the fabric covering Dean's torso was just gone, "I'm going to pleasure and then
Enjoy.
There was a click of a lid, cool sensations and finally a slow and careful push until hips were against hips. Castiel's hands now rested on Dean's hipbones that showed a bit more than they should, but Castiel didn't say anything or even second glance as he stares into Dean's eyes. "Tell me when I can move, lovely." He muses and doesn't break eye contact.
”So, when is Gabriel coming?” He asks as he watches the screen a bit and eats his breakfast.
Castiel watches Dean as he sticks his tongue out in concentration. Dean looks back at Castiel with a bright smile. “What?” He questions.
"I asked if you were alright?" He says gently to Dean again, not moving his hand, he was keeping his eyes connected with Dean's.
"Cas-I'm- Ima-gonna-" Dean couldn't get his thoughts out, but Castiel knew what he was saying and smiled against his skin.
that he's commando right now. He shifts awkwardly where he's standing and is about to go back to sit on the couch and panic, but the doorbell rings.
Dean takes a breath in, he could lie, he could hang up, but instead he takes the biggest risk he's ever taken in the romance and awkward department. "Hey, Cas, ever heard of the Sphere of Darkest Desires? Yeah, well, something happened." He takes a breath in, heart pounding in his ears.
I would just like to say, that once again I’m not an expert on the illnesses that these characters have, but I have put in enough research to know that what I’m writing isn’t unrealistic. I don’t mind constructive criticism, but I’d rather not take critique to how I display the illnesses I’m writing about. Thank you for understand and reading.
“Where are we?” Cas countered, ignoring Dean’s concerning question. He sat up, leaning against one of the pillars of the room.
“Yes,” Cas answered, “It’s hard to believe…I know”—
“Alright, alright, everyone line up,” Dean gestured for people to come up to Cas, a smile on his face. His first patient was the little girl—she had cut her foot running without shoes on while she was infected. She smiled up at Cas, who smiled back at her. Her father squeezes her hand, a little weary of Cas.
“I was just so overwhelmed with emotion—I didn’t know how to react. I’ve never done that before, I just know sometimes humans find comfort in that so I just thought”—
“I meant what I said, Dean. Everyone would die…of age, disease, anything, except me. I would be the one to watch you murder the world.”
What Sam was tipped at the diner was true—the darkness had touched another town and soulless people were roaming around violently next to their deranged-by-darkness companions. The article had called it a mad-cow like outbreak, but of course they were clueless, and doctors from nearby cities had came in to treat the sick.
“What do you want, Cas?” Dean asked with finality, knowing the answer.
“Dean…” Cas whispered, shaking his head and in that moment Sam bust through the door, Dean instantly backed away from Cas, ending their conversation.
“Sam, our last case was literally two days ago. Can you just relax for like, one day?”
“I-I don’t understand,” Sam said, tilting his head, “What about that situation, with the two of you being trapped and Billie coming after you, what about that situation is happy?”
“Yeah right, asshole,” Dean snapped, jolting up from his resting position and attacking the man, sending one blow to his face, which undoubtedly broke his nose. Cas rose but was unsure of what to do. He held his hands up, ready to fight if he needed to. The other man sat the food down and kicked Dean in the back of the knee, which destroyed Dean’s ground. He fell and the man kicked him in the stomach repetitively. Dean grunted, each blow taking his breath away. Cas grabbed Amos and pulled him away from Dean, but Cas was instantly met with a punch in the face by Woods, faltering him, giving the two men time to flee up the stairs.
“Well, Cas, you know you can still rest”—
“You can’t take all the blame, Dean,” Cas defended, placing a gentle on top of Dean’s, which caused Dean to immediately tense up but Cas ignored it. He knew Dean needed comfort and reassurance, whether he wanted it or not. “If you really think about it, I’m the one to blame.”
“Fine,” Dean grunted finally, shaking his head. “I’ll do it.”
“An angel?” she questioned.
“Thank you,” Cas spoke with a shaky sigh, a small smile on his face. Dean nodded.
“Hey—hey, Cas, are you okay?”
“What now?” Cas asked after a few moments of silent staring. Dean shrugged, his eyes darting to the staircase.
“Of course, Dean,” Cas answered softly and the two turned to watch Sam as he returned with their room keys.
“I’ve…made this awkward?” Cas questioned and Dean shook his head.
Dean lifted his hand up and rested it on Castiel’s right cheek. Castiel’s face was hot, and his pulse quickened at Dean’s fingertips.
Sam’s phone beeped softly. The sudden noise started him. He leaned forward, retrieving his phone from the pocket of his pants. There was an alert for a new text message from an unknown number.
“Good,” Dean spoke, sitting down in the chair adjacent to Cas. “You had me worried there.”
“Yeah, he’s okay now,” Dean informed his brother. Sam nodded and the three made their way to the car to begin the long drive to meet the fellow hunter Sam had gotten the tip from.
“Who are you three?” the older woman asked after a few moments, “I want to know the names of the men who saved my grandson and me.”
“We could have done that ourselves,” Cas reassured, “Leave us alone.”
“If it means I’ll feel better, don’t say that. Don’t be so concerned about me.”
“You’d choose humanity over your own family?” Dean questioned.
“I think Cas needs to hear this,” Sam informed, glancing at his brother. Dean was hesitant, but he agreed.
“Yes,” Dean confirmed, hastily interrupting Sam. He knew what he was going to ask, “Admitting this to me made him so damn happy it summoned The Empty, Sam. He didn’t mean it in a brotherly way. He made it pretty damn clear what he meant, and it worked. He tossed me aside, out of the way, and The Empty took him and it took Billie. I was saved, and now he’s gone.”
“I agree,” Sam nodded his head, his voice full of empathy and curiosity.
“After what we’ve seen today,” another older man chimed in, “Nothing is hard to believe.”
“Cas has done some shady things in the past, but never once has he deserved what I did to him, Sam, and he sure as hell didn’t deserve it after what he was saying to me.”
“Okay, well, have a seat and I’ll cook you up some dinner, okay? How’s a burger sound?”
When it was over, Cas was dizzy. He leaned over a chair, nearly toppling over it. He was greeted by Sam and Dean, who held him up and supported him.
He pondered on everything that had happened. The guilt he was feeling before was still present, but not nearly as obsessive. He felt good, for once. He had saved some people, and they were grateful that he was doing his job. Him and his brother were good—they were more of a team now more than ever, and him and Cas were good as well. Cas didn’t hate him, despite everything that had happened between them, in fact, Dean felt like Cas and him were closer than ever before. Some kind of boundary had been broken— a wall had came down— and Dean was unsure of what it was or what was going to become of it, but it felt good. It felt right. Suddenly what Sam had told him about being with someone who understood the life made sense to Dean. He already had someone, and whatever was going on between them…he was happy. Confused, but happy. Dean felt like people genuinely cared about him, and that what he was doing was right. He felt motivated. He was going to defeat the darkness for the sake of humanity, and for the sake of his brother and Castiel.
“Thank you, Cas,” Dean whispered, his face still full of pain despite no longer feeling it. His expression worried Cas, who positioned himself away from Dean now that he was healed; sitting in front of him so he could see his face.
“You’re asking us to lie about what we saw?” the older man questioned. Dean nodded.
“You…don’t see me as family?” Cas questioned, his smile fading, his eyes shifting down.
“I kept thinking in my head, ‘I am doing this for them, I am doing this for them,’ and that is what kept me going…what kept me up at night. I would think and think…all of the possibilities, all of the reasons, and they all revolved around my brother and my best friend. I realized…things aren’t as small as what I thought they were. I thought about everything, so much, and I realized that there is more to it all than I thought. Life—there’s more to it, there’s more to my relationship with Sam, and there is more to me and you. I realized that there are things that I wanted to do, feelings I wanted to express…differently than before. This process of changing, I realized, it all began when I met you.”
“Maybe you should go wait in the car. I’ll handle this,” Dean told him and Cas nodded. He shot Metatron a hateful glare before he turned and headed for the door.
“Yeah, but he’s incredibly old and has done a lot to help us, I think he deserves a week or two of resting and Netflix watching. You ready?”
“Unfortunately, that’s true,” Dean agreed and the conversation fell flat. Cas, believing there was nothing else to talk about, began to turn before Dean interrupted him—“Cas, wait.”
“You know, the two of you made a great team back with the ghoulpires—or whatever. I’m glad we had him to help us.”
“Sam, I will be okay. It’ll be nice to get some alone time. Some time to think. Stay a few days if you want, you deserve it.”
“Dean…what did you do?”
“I’m not mad,” Dean said softly, “If you can’t do it, I’m not mad. I’m still proud of you.”
They just burned their mother. Mary Winchester was gone once again, at the hands of a boy he saw as his son. A brew of anguish, guilt, and anxiety filled his thoughts and stomach.
He spent the remainder of the day in bed, watching movies and Scooby-Doo, eating junk food and drinking beer until eventually his eyes couldn’t stay open any longer. Sam texted him a few times, letting him know he made it and that Eileen was okay. Before he fell asleep, he scrolled through the camera roll on his phone. So few pictures, but he did find a good one of him, Sam, Castiel, and Eileen from their last pizza night. It was a selfie. Dean tried to look smug and cool as he took the picture. Sam and Eileen snuggled in the background, beaming at him. Castiel sat by himself, his arms folded neatly in his lap, a slither of a smile on his face. Other photos were of Jack and Castiel, or Jack, Sam, and Castiel. He even found an old photo Sam had taken of him and Castiel when they weren't looking.
“I went through with the spell, even when you told me not to, even when you and Sam were ready to face eternity separated. I went through with it. I guess Death didn’t suspect that I would be so careless,” Cas elaborated.
“Don’t be,” Dean spoke suddenly, lifting his head up. Cas was clearly surprised by his sudden soft words following the spat they had just had regarding the escape of Amara and Cas’s mercy on Metatron. Cas’s head tilted up in confusion and disbelief, still unaccustomed to Dean’s mood swings, “You don’t have anything to be sorry about. I respect your decision…sorry I blew up, things are just…crazy right now.”
“Awesome,” Dean whispered to himself, his hope finally forming again.
“You could tell?” Dean questioned with suspicion. Cas smiled and tapped his wrist.
“Yeah?”
“I could tell, I can always tell, I am not as oblivious as you think, but like I said, it confused me. I knew that this would be something you would come to me about, because you are too stubborn to admit something until it is too late. You thought you were dying, which prompted you to ponder life and the people who have stayed by your side. You were prompted to ponder me. Why would I stay? Why did I come, even when I was fighting a civil war in heaven? Why did I rebel against my own? Why did I abandon heaven's army? I never really understood what attached me to you, what drove me to do all of these things, but it was ultimately about saving you. You, Dean, because I need you too, and I have never needed anyone, so the feeling is foreign and…curious.” Cas admitted. Dean smirked. The two watched each other before Dean finally withdrew his hand and his stare.
“How much do you know about what happened that day at the bunker? When the Stynes came?” Dean questioned.
"Well, when we get out of all of this we will go find Metatron and see if he has answers," Dean suggested, "But for night now we have to get the hell out of here."   Moments later, the door at the top of the staircase flung open. The woman and man from before descended downwards with two others, shutting the door behind them. They were smiling. Dean was prepared to fight, but he was hesitant as they came with no guns or weapons he could take from them.
“You’re stronger than you give yourself credit for,” Sam defended. “Besides, it’s Cas, he will always be willing to listen to whatever you have to say.”
“I can’t,” Dean objected.
“Cas, you don’t have to explain yourself,” Dean insisted, “It’s okay.”
“You said Cas summoned The Empty,” Sam continued, and at the mention of Cas’s name, Dean released an uneasy breath. He sat his beer down on the table and nodded gently, knowing in his mind where the conversation was going.
“No, well, with all respect awkwardness kind of is your thing,” Dean answered with a chuckle and Cas smiled.
“That won’t work,” Cas informed.
“What? You didn’t tell me this?” Dean snapped.
Dean and Castiel tracking down Metatron ultimately ended in the capturing and kidnapping of the ex angel, who Castiel was less than enthusiastic about seeing again. They managed to knock the man out and he awoke in an abandoned building on the outskirts of the town.
“That’s…” Castiel began with a blush, his eyes fluttering down, “That’s good, I had some concerns.”
“Blue,” Dean answered coolly. “But not like a stupid baby blue, more like a deep night sky blue.”
“I care about you. Some of the things I have said, didn’t say, done, didn’t do…you didn’t deserve that. Truthfully, I didn’t understand it—how I feel, and I still don’t. The people who I care about…they die, maybe that is why I have always pushed you away, or maybe because you and I aren’t just friends. I once told you that you and I were family, and that you were like a brother to me. You and I are family, Cas, but I don’t feel the same way about you that I do about Sam. I tried, but I just can’t, and I’m done lying to you and I am done lying to myself. Secrets tear this family apart, so this is me confessing to you that I care about you…that I, I need you, and I want you here…no more guilt, no more secrets, no more lies, from both of us. I am being honest right now, and damn is it hard, but it is better than keeping it inside and regretting it later.”
“You coming, Cas?” Sam questioned. Cas’s eyes darted at Dean, as if to ask for permission.
“Having souls is what kept us from doing what we’ve always wanted to do,” the woman, Doctor Woods, explained, “And we have no intentions of torturing you…well, not just for the fun of torture.”
“Sure, should we ask Cas if he wants to come?” Sam questioned, shutting the lid of his laptop as he stood.
“The only person at fault here is you. You’re the one who made Castiel care so much about you and feel so much toward you. I even kind of empathize with the guy now, having human emotions is tough! He probably doesn’t understand them.”
“I thought angels didn’t need to sleep?” Dean questioned. “Are you okay?”
“Y-yeah, I’m sure,” Dean reassured him with a smile. Cas smiled softly, bowing his head shyly. He didn’t know what to say or do. The two sat in silence for a few moments, Dean staring at Cas.
“He’s okay,” Dean answered automatically. “He’s binge watched at least five shows on Netflix by now. I guess not sleeping has its perks.”
“Okay,” Castiel agreed, and then added under his breath -- “I-I think I have a new happiest moment, now.”
“Hey—um,” Dean spoke and Cas turned to him. Dean opened his arms and embraced the angel, much to the angel’s surprise. After a few moments, Cas lifted his arms up and wrapped them around the man who was hugging him. He closed his eyes, tucking himself into Dean’s shoulder. Dean released a few moments later and pulled back slowly.
“Sam, I have to tell you something.”
“No, no!” Dean was desperate to make Cas understand. He leaned closer, tightening his grip of Cas’s hand. Cas looked up at Dean with hurt and confusion. “I’m not explaining myself very good, am I? I am terrible at this kind of thing.”
“What do you mean?” Dean asked softly.
“So, Cas didn’t tell you?” Dean declared, glancing at his brother who sat with a confused expression on his face. Sam shook his head.
“We were recruited here to help the sick,” Doctor Amos informed, “When the most extraordinary thing happened—we were touched by a god! Suddenly, all our guilt was drained away. Nothing can stop us from learning what we’ve always wanted to learn. We were always told, as doctors, the inhumane ways to answers, but now…nothing is inhumane. Who would miss two more people? Everyone in this town is dead or dying.”
“They’ve come to a cosmic understanding,” Castiel replied with a smile, “The Shadow wasn’t too happy with Jack being there at first, considering what he is now and what he did to it, but he promised if I came back, The Shadow would never have to see me again, that it could finally sleep, and so it sleeps now, and Jack acts as a filter for all souls who enter The Empty, so that The Shadow will never awaken again.”
“You mean so much to the world,” Cas spoke softly, “You have done far greater good than bad. If it wasn’t for you…then everyone would be gone by now—you stopped the apocalypse. You saved the world, and you deserved to be saved.”
“No,” Cas answered, bending down, pressing his fingers against her forehead and her foot wound healed instantly. She squealed with excitement and hugged him, thanking him. Cas’s smile widened and he pat her back, looking up at her father who stared at him with bewilderment.
“He showed me what happened, less with words, more with pictures and images. She is back,” Castiel said with finality, a content smile on his lips, “That is good. I am happy for Sam.”
“I don’t have to know, I can see it all over his face! I’ve watched enough movies to know what that kind of devotion and admiration looks like. Why do you think Castiel’s grace was so important to that spell? It had to be him, Dean.”
“No, no, Cas, you did a great job,” Dean reassured him, “I’m just so stupid, man.”
“No,” Cas spoke, “This town quarantined itself. We should call for help in the morning.”
“You do?” Dean asked with relief. Cas nodded and turned his hand over, squeezing Dean’s lightly, lifting the two of them in the air.
Cas stood, removing the blanket from his shoulders and folding it up, leaving it on the table in front of him. Sam eyed him with curiosity.
“Jack, he heard your prayer,” Castiel answered, “Well, he was already in The Empty when he heard it. He’s been working to get me out, to strike a deal with The Shadow, but it took some time.”
“Dean…”
“Dean…” Cas whispered, his voice cracking at the sudden sympathetic emotions Dean had expressed to him. He was unaccustomed to kindness, and now his problem was out in the open and someone cared, “but I’m broken.”
“So…the disease didn’t spread?”
“Yep,” Sam answered plainly and the car grew silent for a few moments before Sam spoke again, “I totally called it, though. I knew you were overcompensating for something.”
“We drink,” Dean said simply, passing out beers. Sam drank until his eyes were heavy. Cas drank and felt nothing, mostly to satisfy Dean. Sam left to sleep, Cas left to think. Dean remained, neither drunk nor tired.
“And?” Dean questioned.
“I’m sorry”—
“Don’t defend me,” Dean snapped, emotion boiling in his small voice, “I’m the reason we are in this mess.”
“That’s good—should be easy to quarantine,” Dean concluded.
“What’s happening?” Sam yelled form the other line as Dean panicked, running up to the seat where Metatron had been, the ropes that bound him cut.
“Really?” Cas questioned, his face lighting up. Dean nodded shyly.
Sam sat opposite of Dean, both drinking beers. The bunker was quiet. The world was saved, the names of their lost loved ones carved into the table where they sat. Everyone was there, forever memorialized in the carving, yet no one was there at all. A subtle uneasiness fell on the brothers. They were elated to be free, but more lonely now than they had been in a long time. They mutually lacked comfort in the idea of it just being them--that they had to find a new family once again.
“It doesn’t matter,” Cas objected, “Dean—I hold no grudge or hatred of you for what happened. I just want things to go back to the way they were before—for you to stop hating yourself for it and for everything you do. You couldn’t kill me, because something deep inside you prevented it, and that is enough for me. Do not compare yourself to the angels, who feel no companionship or compassion, when you are so full of it that you hate yourself the instant you think something you are doing is the slightest bit wrong. You couldn’t kill me, Dean, and that in itself is more devotion than I have ever received from any of my brothers and sisters.”
“We were in the diner, discussing any information she’s gathered on The Darkness and Amara when we were approached by another hunter who noticed Amber’s tattoo. He informed us that a town about an hour away from us did a news story in the paper on those infected people—small story, no mass hysteria yet. It’s spreading—and you were right, the monsters are building armies against the darkness. They’re terrified. I headed out with her to go back to the hotel when we were mugged by two vetalas.”
“We aren’t going to lie to you all,” Sam spoke, “There are things out there that can’t be explained. What you saw today…that was one of them. There’s a big threat to this world, but we are going to figure out how to stop it, and we are going to save as many people as we can, but we need you all to keep this on the down low. Mass panic won’t do any good.”
“I was so caught up, Sammy. I was so lost and angry, and he just got in the way,” his voice cracked slightly as he talked, his words slow as he tried to settle his emotions, “I learned that day that there are two people in the world that I can’t kill no matter what, you and him, but I came so damn close to killing Cas. I saw it. I wanted to. Every part of me told me to kill him, to take out all my anger on him, but something stopped me and I thank god or whoever-the-hell for that. He was saying how I had turned into a monster, and how eventually everyone would die and that he didn’t want to be the person to watch me destroy the world, because only he would stay alive long enough to see it,” he paused to glance at his brother, who stared at him with attentive eyes and an open mind, “He didn’t want to fight me. He didn’t fight back, but when I threw that first punch at him I was gone. He kept talking and I hated him for it. I hated how he wouldn’t swing at me, and how he kept coming back to me trying to calm me down. I just wanted him to stay away from me. I don’t know if it was because I wanted to hurt him or if I wanted to push him away, but he kept trying to calm me down, even after I had hit him so many times. He was bleeding and on the ground. I grabbed his angel blade and I raised it. I had every intention of killing him, and that scares the crap out of me, but I didn’t. I couldn’t, and I can’t look at him because I almost killed him and he still wants to heal me. He’s still putting me before himself. He still wants to stick around even though every part of me wanted to rip him apart when we were together in the bunker, just because he was worried about me. I don’t know why he puts me first. I don’t deserve it.”
“No, Cas,” Dean spoke, “I know we will, but…all these people in this town—they’re still dead. They still faced soullessness and disease because of me.”
“We need to lure them out somehow—use the holy oil,” Sam informed his brother and the angel as they stood in front of the open trunk of the impala.
“I wish we could explain more to you,” Cas spoke now, “But in all honesty we are figuring it out ourselves.”
Sam had long gone to bed. What time was it? Dean didn’t know. The room was dimly lit, but he was not tired. Hours had passed. Time is peculiar in grief, it can pass quickly or trickle by slowly. Time had not meaning in heartache.
Dean walked away, leaving Cas alone in the kitchen. Sleep came easier to him than he thought - he was exhausted, and Cas kept his promise of not leaving. He remained in the library, reading and brainstorming ideas as the Winchester brothers slept their sorrows away.
“I wish Sam would hurry up,” Dean whispered.
“Why would we do that, when we just got you? We have so much to learn,” Doctor Henry informed.
“My own room?” Cas chuckled a bit, the concept seeming childish. “Well, I’ve never had my own room before.”
“Tacos sound good,” Sam offered.
“Um, okay,” Cas agreed, but his mind was blank. “Metatron”—
“Hey, you’re the one who said you were bored. I’m just lining them up in case you want to get out of the bunker,” Sam defended himself with a small smile.
“What?” Cas asked suddenly, “Dean, I’m not nearly as powerful as I once was”—
“Feelings?” Sam questioned suddenly, his mind fixated on that one word.
“Like after sunset?” Cas questioned.
“No, Cas, it’s okay,” Dean smiled. “You can tell me anything. Secrets haven’t exactly been good for this family, so it’s okay.”
“Yes—green, like the grass. It’s a good color, Dean.”
“Do you have a plan?” Cas questioned.
“Please don’t defend me, Cas,” Dean objected softly.
“Dean, our last case was literally on a hunch as well and it turned out to be something big.”
“What do you mean?” Cas questioned, turning his head up and squinting his eyes with curiosity. Dean laughed.
“The feeling you are describing is hard for me to grasp. We are being honest, yes? I had never felt it before, not until I became friends with you. I thought it was a normal thing, something I would feel with everyone, but no. This concept is something angels don’t experience, along with sadness, happiness, or even anger. I have known for a little while that there is something…more profound between us. You seemed uncomfortable with it, even though I could tell that you were feeling conflicted as well.”
“Hey—we found Metatron, kind of in the middle of interrogating him”—
“Me too.”
“Sam and I use you as a weapon,” Dean interrupted and Cas’s words trailed off, unsure of what to say, “You’re right, and that ends here.”
“I’m so sorry, Dean,” Cas said instinctively. He was accustomed to being the one apologizing, “I failed Jack, I failed Kelly, I failed you”--
“He said he loved me,” Dean concluded, his throat swelling. He swallowed hard, staring at the bottle of beer at his fingertips.
“I know that you killed them all and that I cleaned up the blood,” Sam recalled with wide eyes.
“Well, we figure that part out. Together. Sam won’t be home for a few days, so we have time.”
“I’m fine,” Cas reassured unreassuringly, his voice a grovel as he sat up, rubbing his fingers along his temple. “Four days of nothing but reading and watching TV really isn’t good for a headache.”
“How’s Cas?” Sam asked one night when Dean finally woke up from a very long nap and dragged his way into the library where Sam had been sitting for at least two hours.
Cas nodded shyly, his trademark awkwardness returning to him as a glimmer of his former self shined on his face.
“Daddy—don’t be so mean! At least we have one, right? And he healed me!” the girl defended Castiel, tugging on her Dad’s hand. The man smiled and nodded.
Cas stopped, still facing away from Dean. Dean walked around the table to him slowly, halting in front of him, catching the angel’s attention. The two stared for a few moments, Dean’s mouth hung open as he thought of words to say. Cas watched, waiting, and Dean could tell there was something different about Cas. Cas always looked kind of sad, but this was different. There was a glimmer of something else, something Cas was trying hard to swallow.
“What is your favorite color, Dean?” Cas questioned after a few miles, a small smile on his face as if to mimic the earlier conversation. Dean couldn’t help but smile as well.
“How do you know?” Sam asked.
“I guess I am just trying to say…I’m sorry. For everything. For attacking you, for leaving you here, for threatening you, for getting so angry when you were just trying to help. I’m sorry, Cas. I don’t want to feel guilty about this any more, I want to move on and for you to fight with us. Help us clean up this mess. Truthfully, there are only two people left in the world who really care about me— one is my brother, who is kind of stuck with me because we are family, and you…which is funny, really. An angel of the lord, so bent on saving someone like me. Why though, Cas? Why do you care about me so much?” Dean questioned.
“Dean, maybe you should sit down”—
“Erm, better, I suppose,” Cas answered with a small smile of relief. Dean nodded.
“It’s quiet,” Dean answered.
“Dean”—
“Yeah, and he revealed to the angels that he cares more about you than he could ever care about them. Doesn’t really go well for any political platform—that he’s fallen in love with a lesser kind. Although I must say, you do make good waffles.”
“You mean so much to me, too, Dean, and to your brother,” Cas spoke finally after a few moments of silence, and that ripped Dean apart more than anything else Cas had ever said. It was so simple, but meant so much. Dean hardly had any family left, but at least he still had Sam and Cas. Still, Dean remained silent and still. He didn’t know how to react to Cas’s kindness. The tears had halted, but the sadness lingered on his face. Cas wouldn’t have it. Cas watched him carefully.
“You don’t think you deserve to be saved?” Cas declared, the familiarity of the words forced a small smile on Dean’s lips. He bowed his head for a moment in remembrance, temporarily speechless by words so simple yet so thoughtful.
“Here you are, the manifestation of light having a conversation with the dark, and I can still touch you. We are not opposites, like your father believes. You came from me. We are not so dissimilar...and yes...a soul - I can feel it throbbing inside you. Not as strong as most humans, I think the angel part of you overpowers it, but it's as if the two are fighting with each other. What is Castiel?”
“Well, at least they had enough courtesy to kidnap couples,” Dean joked.
“The truth is,” Cas spoke finally, his voice small. Dean watched him. He had never seen such emotion from the angel, except for maybe when Cas was trying to defend himself for working with Crowley, but this was different. It wasn’t a plea, it was an acknowledgement of what happened and how much it hurt him. It was a willingness to accept that he wasn’t okay, “I’m scared of losing control, too. Dean, I was a soldier without purpose for so long, and I never want to be that person ever again—hurting without reason. What happened—seeing you so lost and then the curse, me losing control of myself…it scared me. It made me angry, not only at myself but at everything.”
The two men slept on two separate beds while Cas stayed up, sitting in the kitchen chair reading over some books he had brought with him. When morning finally came, Sam insisted on meeting the hunter alone while Dean and Cas checked out the location where Metatron had been spotted, which Amber had texted Sam the location.
“Good point,” Dean agreed.
“Yeah, but you knew what taking on the mark meant,” Dean reminded, “That look you gave me when you saw it on my arm for the first time—you knew it was something dark, and if I had went to you first without jumping the gun and taking it on, we would never be in this situation.”
“What is this? Let us go,” Dean demanded and the man laughed.
“One sided? So are you admitting to me…?”
“Oh, but I am,” Sam teased. Dean rolled his eyes and smiled.
The three looked on as the people in front of them passed snacks around and chatted. Some slept, others were up walking around. Someone had cracked open the vending machine and one woman who worked at the office they were staying in had kept some supplies in her desk, which she now shared with strangers.
“I know,” Dean said, his voice feeble and small, “Which makes it hurt worse.”
“Nah, he doesn’t eat so it’d be pointless.”
“What about the soulless?” Sam asked. Cas shook his head.
“Yeah—hey, what happened? Are you okay?” Dean asked, running his fingers along the back of Cas’s head. Where he had been hit left a gash, but it was already healing. Still, Dean worried for him, especially since he was still not completely over being under Rowena’s spell.
“Sounds perfect.”
“My face got cut up from falling”—
“Sam and Dean,” the woman repeated to remember their names.
“Dean!” Sam shouted from the other end.
“I am glad you are okay, and I am glad you are here.”
“I mean, with you and Cas? He’s acting normal, for the most part, which he’s a bit abnormal but I mean, he’s Cas, so that’s kind of his thing… but you on the other hand…you’ve been acting so different towards him. Is everything alright between you two?”
“I’ll try,” Dean nodded and Cas removed his hand from the man’s shoulder. The two fell silent again as the drive progressed. They were reaching their destination. Dean occasionally glanced at the angel beside him, and Cas just stared blankly ahead.
“No you’re not,” Dean argued and Cas fell silent, his eyes flickering to the ground, “Talk to me.”
"What?" Dean questioned instantly, "But you're an angel?"
“Dean…” Sam started, unsure of what to say. Dean nodded, taking another swig of his beer. Suddenly the victory didn’t taste so sweet. He fought back the tears that stung his eyes.
“You tried,” the little redhead girl spoke with a smile, “That’s more than a lot of people would do.”
“Good?” Dean questioned, his tone asking if Sam was okay with this.
“Not for him,” Castiel replied with a smile, “Dean...he is...he is amazing, and he is everywhere. Everywhere Chuck could and couldn’t be, and is everything Chuck and Amara should have been. He did it.”
“So, what? The Darkness eats your soul and now you get kicks out of torturing people?” Dean questioned.
“What, want some alone time with this chick?” Dean asked, driving up to the diner where Sam was scheduled to meet Amber. Sam waved at a tall woman who stood in front of the diner, a phone in her hand and her anti-possession tattoo flashing on her ebony skin along with a few other tattoos scattered on her chest and other arm. She had a big, bright smile and looked sweet, but also like she could kick your ass. She wore knee-high leather boots, a white tank top, and ripped jeans. Her dark curly hair was tied up in a high ponytail and her eyes hidden behind thick glasses.
“Yes, I know, I heard, but why would you keep trying? Why would you stay with me so long, even after I became the monster that I did?”
“Well, Sam thinks he has found something on Metatron,” Dean informed and Cas’s face scrunched up at the sound of his name. He clutched the blanket draped around him.
“Alright, glad you’re on board,” Dean spoke with a smile, making his way to the door. Cas began to follow, but Dean paused for a moment, turning to face the angel who stood in his brother’s room as he stood in the doorframe. Dean was silent for a moment and Cas stared at him with confusion. Dean lifted his hands, gesturing as he talked.
“I want to help, Dean,” Cas interrupted as he clicked the TV off, “I think getting back into the fight would help me. Make me sharper, or at least occupy me so that I don’t form headaches by engaging in too much television and literature.”
Dean sniffled and stood up, leaving his plate and grabbing a bottle of whiskey on the way back to his bedroom.
“When I had The Mark,” Dean began, finally looking back up at Cas, “I thought I was going to die. I was giving up, I was accepting that I could never escape it. I was already gone, as far as I was concerned. Do you know what kept me going—what motivated me to keep trying?”
“Of course, what is it?”
“What do you want with us?” Cas questioned.
“What the hell,” Dean whispered.
“Talk to me about something— anything besides the darkness. That’ll make time pass quicker and Sam will get here so we can get on it.”
“I feel good, Sam,” Dean spoke sleepily. Sam chuckled.
Dean, on the other hand, was aloof and out of it. His mind was everywhere—on Amara, on Cas, on Sam, worried and feeling guilty over everything. Seeing Castiel’s healing progress made him feel slightly better about the situation that had happened only weeks before, but he still couldn’t forgive himself for how he had lost control.
When they finally returned home, before they slept Sam and Dean agreed to a food run. They hadn’t eaten in a few days, and they wouldn’t be able to sleep on an empty stomach. Castiel stayed behind, his nose poked in some books as he researched the darkness and kept tabs on media coverage of what just happened. Dean placed a hand on Castiel’s shoulder before he said goodbye to him to go with Sam. The two exchanged fond glances, something Sam noticed, before Dean turned his back and walked outside.
“Yeah?” Dean said casually.
“Worked things out?” Sam questioned with a curious smile. Dean shook his head, waving his hand at him.
“Shut up,” the man demanded.
Sam had stayed up while nearly everyone else was asleep. He made his way to the door and looked through the peephole he had made. Dean and Cas stood on the other side, both pulling down the collars of their shirts to reveal clean skin. Sam pushed away the cabinets that had been stacked against the door and unlocked it, letting them in. People churned in their sleep—others awakened.
“She’s like a young adult now, Dean. I don’t know, it’s weird.”
“That’s…good news, finding the demon tablet—getting it back, that’ll help us,” Cas concluded.
“I mean, it feels pretty right to me,” Dean said with a chuckle, his hand dropping from Castiel’s cheek to rest on his shoulder.
“Good,” Sam smiled triumphantly, “I think this will be good for you.”
“What?” Sam turned his attention to his brother, concern on his face. He knew something was wrong. He was ready to listen.
“It’s more of an expression, really— and I don’t really remember how long it rained, but it was a very long time,” Cas answered automatically, once again finding no oddity in Dean’s random questions.
“I don’t understand what you want with me—I’m not an angel anymore, I’m useless to you”—
“If you need anything at all, call me, okay?” Sam said quickly, grabbing his coat off the table. He pulled EIleen’s phone out of the coat pocket, “She’ll need this back...should probably take her car, too.”
“Two people—Sam, and you,” Dean answered. Cas relaxed a bit, flattered by the returned affection. He couldn’t help but smile.
“Cas,” Dean swallowed. He thought the explanation of his emotions would bring him some relief, but he was never good at admitting how he felt. This was hard. Cas knew it was.
“No, I don’t, really,” Cas opposed, “My trust lies with you, Dean, because you have shown me family. I tried to trust the angels, and they hurt me. You’re stubborn and you make mistakes, but that doesn’t mean I shouldn’t trust you or follow you. You showed me something no one else has ever showed me, not even my own family.”
“Cas, I’m not good with words, you know that. What I mean to say is”—he spoke slowly, placing a soft hand on Cas’s shoulder, which brought Cas’s full attention to Dean, “How do you feel about me?”
“Well, you trust the wrong people,” Dean whispered.
“I’ll get him,” Dean offered with slight dread, rolling the taco wrapper into a ball as he stood and made his way to Sam’s room, which is where Castiel had been occupying himself during his binge. He tossed the wrapper into the trashcan when he passed it and slowly made his way to the door. He contemplated knocking first, but what could the angel possibly be doing that he would need to knock? Instead he leaned his head against the door, muffled sounds of the television reaching his ear.  He opened the door slowly.
Dean awoke again to the sound of flickering lights. Half asleep and somewhat hungover, he slept through most of it. The lights clicked and sizzled until eventually they turned off. Dean groaned. He waited, feeling for a temperature drop, but it never came.
Silence fell between the two as they stared at each other. Castiel remained motionless, locked in a smile with Dean. Dean eventually switched stances and unfolded his arms, his smile fading as he stepped forward. Castiel widened the gap between the two, shifting towards the table where he laid an uneasy hand on the wooden top. His eyes flickered to his inscribed name, and his heart fluttered with gratitude. He glanced at Dean once again, noticing Dean’s parted lips, watching as Dean’s mind formed words and sentences. He knew where this was going.
He glanced at Cas.
“Sam,” Dean said slowly, extending his hand out for emphasis, “I insist.”
“That’s pretty messed up,” Dean muttered with a small laugh.
“Jack had to ensure that I would not go to The Empty again upon my death,” Castiel began, “So...I am human.”
“You two showed me what it was like to be free, you welcomed me when my own family rejected me. Rebellious angel Castiel, it only makes sense that I would be taken with the most rebellious humans who ever existed, too stubborn to accept the way things are and too righteous to allow people to be torn apart by the supernatural. I didn’t belong with anyone else. I’m different…I’m unsure why, but I am sure that I belong here…with you.”
“You’re human?” Dean said with a smile, a chuckle of disbelief in his words. At that point, Castiel could have come back as a ghost and he would have been happy.
“Yeah, she’s no where around here, she must have gotten away. We still have people to save, Cas, are you up for it?”
“Dean…” Cas whispered slowly, shaking his head. He was unsure of what to do at this point, but he felt like he needed to do something.
“Yeah, we talked things out…emotions were discussed, apologies were made”—
Dean paused, his jaw clenched. Sam’s expression softened, waiting for his brother to continue. Sam knew from the look in Dean’s eye that he was hurting, he was grieving, and in a way Sam understood. They both experienced a similar loss.
“Tacos it is,” Dean agreed.
“I don’t know, we used rope and he apparently had something that chewed through it. I know you really wanted to catch him and get the tablet but he’s not hurting anyone right now,” Dean spoke.
“Thank you,” Cas whispered hoarsely. “Should we go after her?”
“I don’t know, he probably thinks I’m an ass for nearly killing him!” Dean blurted out honestly.
“No—Cas, she’s too dangerous,” Dean protested.
“Dean…” Cas whispered, his voice a low grovel, “It’s okay, Dean…”
“Well, look, are you hungry? You’ve been gone a few days, and you’re human now, so you gotta eat. You probably need a refresher on some things anyways, like how to brush your teeth.”
“I’m not letting you get away”—
“I’m sorry, Cas,” Dean said finally, his voice shaking slightly. His words were hard, as if they struggled to come out, not because he didn’t mean it but because he felt guilty and ashamed for what he had said.
“Are you sure?” Cas questioned, guilt and regret all over his face as he finally looked at Dean.
“He had made a deal with The Empty, back when Jack died,” Dean answered.
“I’m sorry, but I’d still rather have you,” Dean began with a smile, leaning against the table, “and it doesn’t mean you can’t be fixed.”
“Psh, whatever,” Dean teased and walked away, Cas following him.
“I’m glad you are here.”
“How do you feel?” Sam asked cautiously. Dean paused, shaking his head. “Dean, you can be honest with me. I’m your brother.”
“Of course I’m real,” Castiel replied.
“Why? What’s the point?” Dean questioned.
“Hello, Dean.”
“People focus too much on the bad things,” Dean spoke, “But here…right now. I’ve never felt more like humanity is worth saving, and is worth fighting for.”
“Don’t act so interested,” Dean snapped playfully.
Cas’s blank confusion cued Dean to answer the question for him.
“I need to tell you, I /want/ to tell you, that you changed me too, Cas. You changed me then, you changed me now. Before I met you, I didn’t believe in anything, now I believe in /us/. I believe in you, I believe in me, I believe in Sam and Jack. You changed the way I saw the world, and hell, just a few days ago you changed how I saw myself.”
“Dean, you were doing what you thought was best—and your mind was being completely irrational from the mark, no one blames you for what you did or what you thought you needed to do,” Sam defended him, “Yes, what you did was terrible, but not something you would have done if you were in your right mind.”
“Yes, absolutely,” Castiel answered with a smile, “I would have done anything to come back to Earth, and this? Well, this was one of the better options.”
“I’m okay,” Dean answered after a few moments, his voice taken from the pain he felt in his abdomen.
“So, did it really rain for 40 days and 40 nights?” Dean asked casually.
“No you didn’t, Cas and I should be the one apologizing. When I get upset I say and do things I don’t mean and I never apologize for them. Well, I am now. What I said was impulsive and I didn’t mean a word of it. I’m sorry for what I said and how I reacted, Cas. You are not to blame for this, or at least not all of it. The blame isn’t on anyone entirely.”
“Dean,” Cas shook his head, his voice soft with disapproval, “You don’t have to apologize”—
“I’m better at showing how I feel, Cas,” Dean said, running his fingers along Castiel’s hand. At Dean’s touch, Castiel flinched, yet his hand unraveled so easily to him. Dean’s fingers hovered, motionless, resting on Castiel’s knuckles. Castiel did not look at their touching hands, instead he inhaled the touch, feeling it instead of seeing it. Castiel parted his lips, wanting to say something, but he could not form words. His heart thumped heavily in anxiety.
Dean knocked on the door three times.
“Things are always crazy,” Cas reminded him. Dean nodded with a small bittersweet smile.
“Humans do that too, you know,” Dean pointed out. Cas stared.
“Yeah, Cas thought the same thing, but honestly that’s not even the worst part of the story.”
“Okay, Dean,” Cas confirmed. Dean sighed and walked passed him but paused. He placed a hand on Cas’s shoulder.
“It will never reach that point,” Cas reassured, “The bond Dean shares with his brother and I is greater than any bond you claim you have with him, and he will always choose us over you.”
“Fine,” Amara agreed, looking at Dean, “See you soon.”
“I don’t either, not really,” Cas admitted, “I’m still very new to this experience, these…feelings, but I know for certain that I have never in all of my existence felt this way about anyone but you. How I feel towards your brother…it’s similar, but not quite the same. It’s easy to differentiate, but I’m unsure what you would call how I feel, other than a profound bond, but that seems to make you uncomfortable, which is mainly why I’ve never brought it up again…”
“Cas?” Dean questioned, and sure enough the angel had not moved form his position on Sam’s bed. The TV was on—some show involving witches, but Cas wasn’t watching it. Instead he was passed out on the bed, much to Dean’s astonishment, wrapped in the blanket he had clung to when he was under the effects of the attack dog curse, several books on ancient monsters and his cell phone laying idle by.
“I just wanted him to leave so he wouldn’t have to see me do whatever it takes to make you talk,” Dean informed harshly, cutting a small piece of his skin at his neck. Metatron squirmed. “See, you took his grace, made the angels hate him, and that’s unforgivable.”
“Dean…” Cas whispered, knowing where this conversation was heading. He shook his head, unsure of what to say or do, but knowing in his heart that whatever Dean was feeling guilty over was not his fault.
“I know, and God put me back on the top,” Cas recalled, standing up and walking to the television. “But that won’t be the case this time, and besides, it's different. I'm not sure how or why, but it just feels different from before. I feel like I'm really...torn between the two worlds, not just metaphorically but literally as well.”
“H-how?” Dean stammered, taking a few steps forward. Castiel leaned forward as well, extending his arm out slightly, but then quickly retreated it. He didn’t want to come across as too excited or too happy.
“I’m not worth it, Cas…” Dean whispered, “Just stop.”
Dean waited with his head bowed. After a few moments, he opened a single eye, peeking for any sign that his prayer was heard. Following a long minute, he sighed, wiped away his tears, and nodded his head in acceptance.
“The vessel I choose-- my permanent form now, my body...,” Castiel elaborated, “I’m not…”
“I know you can knock that door down and we can beat these soulless sons of bitches, but you have to believe that you can do it. I know you’re cut off from heaven—or whatever—but that doesn’t mean you’re not strong by yourself. You can do this.”
“Yeah, this job will do that to you,” Sam laughed, “We’re going to have to get him off of that eventually.”
Dean pulled away and took a step back, leaning against the table.
Castiel’s words trailed off. He waited for an explanation from Dean.
“Hey Dean,” Sam spoke.
“Yeah.”
“Sorry, he just…agitates me,” Cas muttered.
“Yeah, yeah, I know…I thought I was terrified going in to this and now I am terrified that you think I don’t see you as family. No, Cas. What I meant was, I don’t see you the way I see Sam, or saw Charlie…I don’t feel for you the same way I feel for Sam or Charlie. Sam is my brother, he feels like my brother to me. Charlie wasn’t related to me, but she felt like a sister to me. You…you are different,” Dean paused and drew breath. The rest was blurted out.  "I’ve never felt this way for someone like you before, it is usually of someone opposite of your…well, Cas, what I am trying to say is that I care for you too much to love you like a brother. I didn’t want to die because I wanted to live for my brother, and for you. I wanted to continue this fight with my brother and you by my side, and I wanted to tell you what I feel for you and all my thoughts I had while I had The Mark. I am being honest because I need to be. I don’t know when my last day is, or yours, and I want you to know how much I care about you, how much…if under different circumstances, if we didn’t have to go through all of this with The Darkness and the demons, and the never-ending job and you and I could be safe…how much I…I…”
“You don’t, Cas,” Dean replied with finality. Castiel’s head perked up in interest, a curious look in his gaze.
“Are you okay?”
“What the hell are you insinuating right now?” Dean questioned defensively.
“Cas…” Dean smiled affectionately. The two watched each other with little smiles on their faces for several moments before more words were finally spoken.
“Like how I used to look at Jess,” Sam answered quietly. Dean grew quiet, sinking in this new piece of information. He swallowed hard, unsure of how to react.    “All I am saying Dean is…talk to Cas about what happened, and ask him how he feels about you. I feel like the two of you never really talk, it’s just about the case. Do you even know what his favorite color is? I just feel like there is a lot you two can talk about—get off your chest, and it would be best to go ahead and do it now.”
“Dean, I”—
“Dean…” Castiel interrupted, his eyes dropping, “We don’t have to talk about it. I...I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.”
“Abandoned building? How cliché,” Metatron mouthed.
“Jack,” he said softly, “Look, I know...I know you aren’t hands-on, like Chuck was, but I hope you can still hear me. I’m proud of you,” he began with a feeble smirk, “And I hope it’s not too much to ask for, but…”
Dean nodded to his brother who shut and locked the door to the building. They had saved nearly two hundred people and they were all piled up in the office building, terrified but grateful. They formed community and chatted with each other. They demanded explanation, and Sam reassured them that he would explain everything as soon as the town was exterminated form the sickness.
“Fascinating!” the man spoke. “A man who can’t die!”
“He stays for you, Dean,” Sam declared softly.
“Tiny—they have a small town square that is a bunch of office buildings, houses, a post office, and a few stores but that’s it, really. The population is only six hundred, and the closest city nearby is ten minutes away.”
“You have no bond with Dean,” Cas snapped, “You are just using that—you’re using him, putting him under a spell. I know that when I see it.”
Nevertheless, he arose the next day before noon, took a long warm shower, brushed his teeth and even made himself a nice breakfast. When he sat down in the kitchen to eat, however, he found his appetite diminished when he realized he had no one to share it with. He looked over the beautiful ensemble, felt guilty for not eating, and then scooted the plate forward with distaste. After a moment of thought, he bowed his head, closed his eyes, heaved a heavy sigh, and parted his lips to whisper desperation to the new god.
“No, no, Cas”—Dean shook his head, surprised and unsure of how to react. He grew awkward, “It’s okay.”
“What’s wrong, Dean?” Cas questioned softly upon seeing Dean’s expression, “Did I not heal you properly?”
He fell asleep laying face down, cuddled up to his pillow with a bottle next to him, the distant sound of credits from some cheesy romance movie acting as a lullaby. He didn’t dream that night, instead he slept hard and without reason to get up in the morning.
By this time, Sam had called both Dean and Cas at least twenty times each. It was nighttime, and the people in the office building had become impatient and restless. Sam was unsure of how to occupy them or to check and see if the city was clear without threatening their safety. He figured the best thing to do was to wait for the morning, and so he did.
“Dean, don’t think that I don’t want to help”—
“I did,” a small voice spoke from the corner of the room. She blended in—a shadow, but she was still there. She stepped forward; looking down at the bodies she had butchered and then up at the angel and man in front of her. It was Amara—still a young adult, a small satisfied smile on her face. Dean stared at her, overwhelmed by her presence. “They were going to kill you, and while I wouldn’t mind them killing you, angel, I can’t have them kill Dean.”
“Dean…”Cas began but his words trailed off. His mouth hung open, unsure of what to say. The two stared at each other for a few moments, unsure of what to say.
“Are you okay with being human?” Dean asked, crossing his arms, “I mean, you gotta eat now, and drink water, and...y’know, human stuff.”
“You’re not a coward, Dean,” Cas defended.
“What?” Cas turned his face up in confusion. “Why?”
“We can help you,” Cas reasoned, lifting himself up onto his knees. He noticed that the man was in scrubs, a nametag on his chest read his name and Cas spoke it— “Henry.”
“Sam’s right about a lot of things,” Dean furthered, “Jack is all of our responsibilities, and you’re right. I am to blame as much as you and Sam. Hell, I am to blame the most. I knew something was up with him but ignored it, because that’s what you do when you care about someone. You look past the bad and only see the good. I didn’t even think anything of it, the thought never occurred to me that Jack was capable of something like this.”
