“Do you know why I’m hurting you, Dean?” Castiel asks, patient and inevitable.
Behind Castiel—his waist, his belt, his coat—sit the remains of the spell and the remains of the would-be summoner. Dean closes his eyes against reality.
Vibrating just as much as he had when entering, he exits his apartment above the garage, jogs down the stairs, and slides into his car. Patting the dashboard, Dean murmurs to the car as her engine purrs, “I’m just like you, Baby.” Fucking awesome on the outside, classy as shit on the inside.
“...You’re amazing,” Castiel says. “You’re still in chastity, but you’re amazing.”
As if partners upon the training field, each gaining a feel for the other. Hunter presses him faster, but Castiel presses back harder. More than once, each of them pulls through via footing rather than sword work.
“Oh,” Cas says, frowning. He comes over to Dean and wraps him in a tight hug, water still dripping from his hair and into the collar of his bathrobe. Cas holds on tighter still. “I think you’re right.”
, not showing off for
His hand tight around the back of Dean’s head, Castiel draws Dean forward. Stoppers Dean’s throat completely.
“Zorro mask.”
“Dean would like to cancel his upcoming donation on the grounds of ineligibility,” he says.
Dean’s body answers on its own.
But he is not alone.
“Everyone,” Dean says, popping off. “Me included. Even you too, ‘cause I’m not making you worry.”
“Hey hey hey, no-”
, it currently reads.
Jimmy turns his chair around. Standing guard next to him, over him, Hannah visibly bristles.
Good.
Clearing his throat and standing tall, Prince Samuel continues in a more formal tone, “A melee’s not a war, but today, all of you will take it just as seriously. This is for my brother’s happiness, which is my happiness, which is that of your future king. Prove to me my trust in you is not misplaced.” Prince Samuel looks around the circle, catching each alpha’s eyes one combatant at a time. “Any questions?”
“You fucking the bed, sweetheart?” Dean checks, Dean teases. He takes a light smack at Castiel’s shoulder, and Castiel groans and groans and
Slowly, mournfully, Cas looks up at him. “He said he could... get you to do that,” Cas says. Gestures at his own mouth. “I told him not to.”
“Ulterior motive doesn’t make it less generous.”
It happens then, that stutter of motion between wet dream and sex act. That instant where the reactions of Dean’s body are overtaken by the impulses of Dean’s mind.
“And when that changes?” Castiel asks, because it always has before. Regardless of sexual gratification, needs change.
“Partially. Do you like holding hands?”
Looking at the question like that, Castiel’s answer to Jack abruptly changes.
Castiel drops to both knees, takes Dean by the face, and kisses him
“My king, my lords, and your esteemed guests!” a man in Winchester colors announces from beside the royal box. “Listen all and listen well, for the melee for the fair prince’s hand is soon to commence!”
Dean blinks some more.
Shaking his head, Dean dutifully walks to the processing room, only to poke Castiel on the chest. “Not that baby blue isn’t your color, but why the boring scrubs?”
Humming along to the Pandora station Cas loaded up, Dean scrubs the pan hard. The fridge door shuts, the plastic containers loaded inside. Despite the adequate space in their kitchenette, Cas passes by closely behind him, one hand snagging on Dean’s hip like a paperclip overwhelmed by a magnet.
Spar.
“I’m, um.” Dean clears his throat. “I’m trying to be there for you, man, but talking ‘bout you dying, that’s pretty fucked up.”
Dean pops his fly and Castiel’s face lights up with victory.
Remembering very well how he’d met Hunter, Castiel holds the line until Alistair passes them, the single-minded gleam of the chase in his eyes.
“Dean Winchester.”
“You liked the bar quiz?” Dean asks.
“Alistair,” Hunter answers for him with a voice of frozen rage. “Yeah.”
Unable to say the word, Dean nods.
By unspoken agreement, every alliance begins to press back from the center of the arena. Castiel looks back to find that Prince Samuel’s group has secured a spot by the arena wall: protected on one side without being boxed in. The raiding party shuffles back toward them, taking up a position adjacent to Prince Samuel, not the walls. Threats in only two directions, for Prince Samuel. Standing with Balthazar beside him and Hannah behind him, Castiel is in much the same position.
Thought.
Eyes still wide, Castiel just looks at him.
Hunter cranes over Castiel’s shoulder to see, his breath hot where it can slip through to Castiel’s sweaty skin. A piece of strange distraction bubbles up through Castiel’s mind at that, but he takes it, breaks it, and puts it aside. Hunter still carries the faintest hint of omega scent with him, that token hidden inside his armor, hidden beneath the arena’s dust; that combined with simple sensation is reason enough for Hunter’s breath on his neck to bring him chills.
“Look,” Dean says, leaning back with a closed off coolness that Castiel can’t remember seeing previously. “I figured from the pronouns on everyone’s badges, you were all okay here-”
“If you don’t like it, that’s me judging wrong,” Dean says, speaking over the churning of his stomach. He forces himself to add, “You can come up with a backup reward?” Not that Dean will want it, if he’s judged wrong, but Cas doesn’t need to know that.
Castiel puts a sock-clad foot against the inside of Dean’s knee, nudging his legs apart. Dean kneels with his legs spread wide, jeans straining over his crotch.
With that slick on his fingertips, Dean jerks himself ready. He’s even got enough time to cater to the camera, because he’s nothing if not a professional.
“You literally just brought me this this tray.”
Regardless, Castiel dutifully processes him before taking Dean out and settling him down. “We’re offering free t-shirts this month with donations,” he says when Dean doesn’t start making conversation the way he’d used to. “Make sure to get one on the way out.”
Castiel sighs over the phone. “Good luck. I’ll keep you posted on things here.”
,” Dean gasps.
“Tell me aloud.”
As for the flouncy ones… nothing looks right. Maybe if he had a soft, cozy sweater instead of all his Henleys, that might work. His wardrobe isn’t exactly full of soft pink and white frills. And it’s not like he
“Do you have any reasons to delay?” Castiel asks.
“That can be part of our wedding night scene,” Castiel whispers, awed.
Dean hums an approving sound and lets his hand be used. He curls himself tighter around Castiel, drags Castiel further beneath him. The steady pressure at Castiel’s back turns Castiel over, onto his stomach. Dean’s leg over his drags Castiel the rest of the way under Dean.
Which—big downside—means Castiel can go ahead and keep talking.
“Okay.”
Liquid drains down Dean’s throat. Sweat pours down his spine. Tears from his eyes. Spit and pre-come from his lips.
More than once, Dean’s grunts of displeasure prompt Castiel to spread his legs once more and recapture Dean between them. Each time, Dean rewards the rescue with sloppy kisses to nape and spine and shoulder blades.
Today, however, Dean simply returns to the task at hand with nothing more than a grumbled, “Just don’t melt my car over there.”
“It’s a surprise,” Dean insists.
In a daredevil feat of amazing driving, Dean gets them all the way to Castiel’s parking spot without dying. He kills the lights and the engine, and Castiel makes a needy noise of protest as Dean releases him to do so.
They breathe heavily, panting, wasting energy. Any maneuver requiring dexterous work is a maneuver doomed to failure. Here are blunt blocks only, finesse worn away.
Dean tears the packet open.
“Complimentary turn-down service, huh? Quality place you’re running,” Dean says, his grin absolutely reaching his eyes. The green positively sparkles.
Dean’s heart stops.
Cas passes the infant over with the utmost care and absolutely shaking hands.
“Some of us can actually cook.”
“Of c- What?” Dean clears his throat. “Sorry, what?”
Today, Castiel’s wearing the rainbow dinosaur scrub shirt with the black pants, and he’s gotten more than a few grins from his coworkers.
Careful beyond measure on the opposite side of their allied group, Prince Samuel only disengages from his opponent once another alpha slips in to relieve him. The transition is close to flawless, but any ease found in Prince Samuel’s form vanishes the moment he sees Gordon pinned to the ground.
“Yeah, no, I’m not, y’know.” Dean waves his hand around. “Picking anyone up tonight.”
, but they sync so well.
“Thirty seconds! And one alpha not yet inside!”
“Dean, I’ve been eating your cooking all week,” Castiel points out.
Dean lowers his head toward the side and tugs with one hand, and on an unspoken count of three, Jimmy rolls Dean over onto his back, folding his legs into place to ride Dean’s cock. Jimmy’s balls bounce against Dean’s happy trail; Jimmy’s dick taps a drooling rhythm against Dean’s stomach.
“How many times do I have to teach you?” Castiel asks. “Your mouth is for my cock.”
Looking over into the pot of lumpy off-white, Castiel decides, “Time for butter.”
The rest of the week absolutely drags on.
the crazy cat guy. Great.” Dean pulls out his phone, mostly as a warning.
And Dean looks
“You told my parents?”
Dean plants his mouth.
Castiel releases Dean’s abused nipple only to repeat the torture on the other side. As he tightens that pinch, Castiel shifts closer, stretching his body out alongside Dean’s. At the breath against his face, Dean looks, has to look.
“At the beach?”
Despite the aches deep inside him, Dean gets up too. He grabs the glasses and urges Cas to stand.
The scent, the sound, the connection of skin-on-skin, all of it has Dean turned on past any capacity for real acting. All he has left within him is submission play, begging his Master for mercy, for forgiveness, for a harder fuck, and all of it incites Jimmy to take Dean even rougher.
It’s perfect.
“Help your brother stand, Dean,” King John orders.
“And for me?” Dean says. “Single and
“No one hurts you like I do,” Castiel adds in his blunt, almost conversational way. “And I don’t hurt anyone as much as I hurt you.”
Castiel slaps him.
“Tell me what you are.”
“Cowboys and comedy, yeah, let’s go.”
Castiel nods.
Both sides pull back to regroup. To reassess the foes before them. To acknowledge the few scattered alphas throughout the arena choosing to hang back and watch them destroy each other.
“Not the
Almost sleepily, Castiel opens his laptop on their bed and gestures for Dean to join him once he’s changed. Castiel loads up some mutually approved pornography and instructs Dean to sit on the other side of the laptop facing him. Once Dean’s in place, Castiel proceeds to jerk himself off, his eyes flickering between the screen and Dean’s increasingly straining panties.
“I’m sorry I made you think you might go for years without having sex.”
“Do you like holding hands around my cock?” Castiel asks.
“I like the accounting work more these days,” Cas reminds him. “And I thought you wanted to switch to directing.”
Castiel nods but does not reach.
Balthazar breathing heavily, he and Hannah form up alongside Castiel.
Then, it’s time to get packed and dressed.
Castiel sighs. “Fine.” He takes his plate and grabs the remote. “Something light? A comedy?”
“Hello, Commander,” Alistair greets Castiel. “Are you ready for me to break you while your little prince watches?” He nods toward the royal box behind Castiel. “I can practically smell him from here. Can’t you?”
Holding Castiel’s gaze, he moves his leg and rises, now kneeling on a single knee.
An hour passes with nothing terribly unusual occurring. One potential blood donor has to be sent home due to insufficient iron levels, and the other two go just fine. It’s a steady rate of people coming in, something to be grateful for on many levels.
Dean toils away with a collapsible soil shovel, too heavy for the task, too conductive of cold for the weather. But still Dean works. There are no more complaints, only puffs of air and grunts of exertion as he digs heavy snow out from between the car’s tires. The care he takes would be remarkable on another human. On Dean, it’s simply commonplace.
Breathing hard, Castiel pulls off and rises up, Dean’s leg falling from his shoulder. “
Castiel releases Dean from the tie as well. He kisses and massages Dean’s wrists, his fingers, and he pays special attention to one.
With a groan and a scrape of the chair, Cas gets up. Follows. All the way up the stairs, his hand audibly sliding along the railing with each step.
But with Dean sitting in the canteen sipping water for a full half an hour, Castiel truly can’t bring himself to mind.
A sharp woof whistle startles the both of them.
“Eight. That means nothing to Baby Shark. It will not die.”
“I thank you, my king.”
Dean bites his lip once more, but doesn’t immediately say anything. Instead, he sighs and pushes up his sleeve, then pointedly waits for Castiel to do his job.
“I was young as well,” Castiel reminds him.
Eventually, he puts two and two together. It doesn’t help that the employees point him out to each other on occasion. There is also, weirdly, a guy out of store uniform that the employees still clearly talk to about Dean. When Dean turns down the pet aisle out of muscle memory, he sees the employee restocking the shelves paused to talk to this man in a trench coat. As Dean’s squeaking cart approaches, the pair go silent, and both stare at him wordlessly until Dean is well past.
, Castiel reads what he’d written to Dean himself.
Though Dean stops pulling at Castiel’s cock, he keeps squeezing. Keeps holding on as if this piece of Castiel is as much a source of comfort as Castiel’s hands, as the crook of his neck where Dean’s chin so often rests mid-embrace.
That one is worth mulling over. “I don’t enjoy it when indulging my partner becomes the expectation. But I’ve also had partners who became uncomfortable when things were too one-sided.”
Rolling his eyes, Castiel stands, taking his plate with him. “If you’re going to be like this-”
Castiel looks him dead in the eyes and asks, “Will you be my healthcare proxy?”
“If I’m the one driving, it’s the rules,” Sam insists, but Dean is nothing if not a contrary asshole.
It’s a Tuesday when Hannah hangs up the phone and calls out to Castiel, “Dean Winchester scheduled an appointment for Friday next week.”
The melee begins, bodies fall, and scents thicken.
Still, there’s a general vibe when the pair look at Dean, and even Benny to some degree. Like Dean’s become a worthless piece of crap for liking the way Benny bends him around and gropes his ass.
. Wait no, come back, I didn’t say it was a bad look!”
“I planned a good week,” Dean answers. “Checked my schedule, checked your schedule. Wasn’t just celebrating a good midterms, I thought this out in case you wanted to, y’know. Do what we did this week.”
“Do you want the blanket?”
The light of revelation flashes behind Jimmy’s eyes, and a fresh flood of slick leeks out onto Dean’s crotch. Gazing down at Dean like no one’s ever called him that before, Jimmy rumbles out, “
A hot, wet pulse drips out into his jeans.
Dean frowns at a point somewhere past Castiel’s ear, where math apparently resides. “Fifty-two weeks a year… Twenty-six fortnights. That’s just skipping a month.”
“Han Solo cosplay.”
“I’m making plans,” Dean explains. “Like the garage, all the photos. It’s not just for the website. I’m making a portfolio. For the car shows, y’know? I don’t just want to sponsor them, I want to judge. I’m gonna show how much I know about restoring classic cars, and then I’m gonna keep going until I get to be a judge. That’s the new dream. It’s not just the garage anymore. I want more than that. I’m planning on more than that.”
Eventually, Dean has to
“Check your texts.”
“Say that again,” Cas tells him, eyes bright, and the fucking nerd takes goddamn notes as Dean points out the obvious.
laugh,” says Michael, later, after everyone’s had a cursory rinse and put their robes back on. It’s the debrief, because the good porn DVDs come with bonus features these days.
To see Alistair’s head turn to focus on a spot behind Castiel, behind Prince Samuel.
Castiel nods. “Dessert.”
This time when Dean goes in to kiss him, he pulls back on Castiel’s hair, the same firm, slow draw Castiel uses so well on him. Careful on the neck, but absolutely controlling. And Dean kisses that throat. Bites that neck. Hums indulgent corrections when Castiel errs on the side of handsy.
“Jack Skellington, nice.” Another compliment, another tap on the character’s face over Castiel’s pectoral. “You’re really Halloweening it up, huh.”
Castiel inhales.
“Not funny,” Dean tells him.
Sam jerks his hand in a tiny wave, and they both head off in something way closer to a hurried retreat than a scurry toward sex.
“Who was the alpha you were talking to, before?” she asks.
“Yeah, okay,” Dean grumbles, but less than three quarters of an hour later, he’s clearing his throat at Castiel. “Fine, you win, blanket time.”
“Good boy,” Castiel says and fucks Dean’s mouth, the desk chair squeaking and rattling in a surreal backdrop against Castiel’s groans and Dean’s labored breathing. “Swallow,” he commands, and Dean does, throat working around Castiel’s heat even before there’s come to swallow.
When Dean’s lack of coordination interferes too much with their mutual progress, Castiel wriggles one arm out from beneath himself, the better to reach back and catch at Dean’s hip. The better to pull Dean down to thrust as Castiel lies flat on his stomach. Lying here, the crack of his ass is only the start of a long, firm line for Dean. Hazy, groggy, lingering in some lustful dream, Dean ruts against Castiel’s ass and thighs.
Castiel hadn’t been looking at him during that last part of the explanation, and Dean’s expression had changed from playful to impressed. No, not impressed, more… awe?
Pulling away for a desperate breath, Dean glared at the man in front of him. "I really fucking hate you right now," he muttered, his attention mostly focused on that damn tricky belt that the damn tricky angel always insisted on wearing.
"Heya, Cas," Dean said enthusiastically as he walked over. "Going for those frequent shopper points lately, huh?" He asked with a chuckle.
Cas’ face lit up for a few seconds, before he nodded again for Dean to keep going.
And Sam would never look at a crossword puzzle the same way again.
“She’s a fictional animated character, Dean,” Castiel corrected him a few moments later, when his mouth was no longer occupied. “She’s hardly capable of being sexy.”
The nest was in an old, possibly abandoned cabin over by a small lake, surrounded by a fat lot of trees and not much else. Good, because there’d be no civilians to worry about, but bad because there was a lot of forest to run off into. Better make it as quick and efficient as possible, then. Forgetting all his current gender problems, Dean looked over at Cas and said “Let’s go,” like always. Then he winced at the words coming out in a girl’s voice, and sulked as he silently got out of the car. They got the machetes out of the trunk just as quietly, and Dean mouthed ‘three’ to Cas right before kicking the door in. Or at least trying to. His leg dinged off harmlessly without his usual strength and mass behind the move, and he couldn’t help but shout “Fuck!” Cas was on it in seconds, though, busting through the door with angelic super strength (or even just normal masculine strength, for all Dean could tell right now in his pissed off pouting bubble), and then thought was next to impossible as the three vamps rushed them and the fight started.
Thursday, September 2nd
“Naw,” Dean said, his face now completely lit up, red as a stop sign.
When Dean finally did look away, it was to pull into an empty parking lot. He turned the stereo and the car off, and only smiled when Castiel gave him his most confused expression, with extra head tilt and everything.
“I hope the time when my Claire gets that big never comes,” Castiel said, trying to hide that he’d been staring when the guy randomly turned in his direction.
a single word. “Son of a bitch.”
“No, don’t get into that again, Dean,” Castiel responded immediately. “This professorship is what you’ve always dreamed of, so I don’t mind in the slightest that we have to move halfway across the country for you to take it.”
Four years of crushing on Castiel Novak in high school did not prepare Dean to see him again at their ten year reunion, especially not when the guy walked in with the beautiful red-haired woman that was probably his wife.
Castiel let out another tortured sigh and rolled his eyes, shaking his head in exasperation at the universe putting him in the same family as his immature class clown of a sibling.
“He just wants to mooch off my generosity,” Dean corrected him with a laugh. "He’d rather wrestle an alligator than do laundry or cook, so it was either near me, or near mom, and unlike her I don’t ask him a billion questions about his classes, his grades, his social life, his dating life, etcetera etcetera,” Dean finished, even mimicking a person talking nonstop with his hand.
“I bet you’re really strong, too,” Dean continued, because he really didn’t want to go back to the cricket version of elevator music. “The kinda strong where you could just hold a guy up, I mean a girl,” Dean stumbled over his words but he was most of the way there, so let’s ignore that little Freudian slip, now shall we? “Where you could just hold a girl up, do anything you wanted to with her.” Fast save, Winchester. Right?
“We fake destroy them,” Dean explained, without really explaining anything. At the look of further confusion, he tried to explain his explanation. “The boxers, like yours, only we fake destroy them, then send ‘em back.”
“Dean?” Cas asked, worried at his boyfriend’s expression.
Opportunistic opponents advance to finish the scuffle for both of them, and in the brief time it takes Hannah and Castiel to negate that threat, Gordon has Balthazar on the ground.
Castiel’s training intensifies, and it is at last suitable for the rocky terrain of their northern border to Lucifer’s territory, and even some of Raphael’s. He fights on foot, armed as best suits him, armored as best fits him, and he trains with a minimum of two partners. These, he plays off each other: one foe permanently kept in the middle, the nearest attacker serving as a shield.
And down.
Looking. Looking away. Looking back.
Dean ruts.
Dean’s desperate, half-hard dick.
He double-checks that Cas is taking the bus home, and then he lets autopilot take over. Frozen pizza in the oven. His homework spread out over the coffee table instead of in the office, so he can keep an eye on the front door. Hot pizza in the face, leftovers in the fridge. A beer. A shower and a scrub around his hole. A change of outfit. A second change of outfit. Another check that he has everything he needs on him. A quick test kneel, and yeah, he needs to use jacket pockets, not jean pockets.
They never made it to the motel, but they did stop once on the side of the road. Then again at a lightly forested area right off the road. Then a park where that poor bench will never be the same again. And one last time right before the bunker held against the Impala. Dean didn’t know how exactly he managed to survive it, but he was definitely going to have to kick Sammy out for a few days or so. Because holy shit, Cas was insatiable and had the stamina to match. Maybe he wasn't going to survive after all. He would be just fine with his tombstone saying ‘Fucked to death by the hottest angel dom in existence.’ Yep, that’d work just fine.
Dean glared at Sam as the non-attached part of Team Free Will gathered a few ingredients and what looked like a tiny statue. “You seriously cast a spell on me so I’d hafta admit that I liked Cas?” He asked, getting more upset by the second. “A spell you didn’t even know about how it worked? What the fuck, Sammy?”
“Claire can share my bed,” Emma offered excitedly, even though that’s where the two had been sleeping before the omegas had gotten home. Claire, teething ring still in her mouth, nodded just as enthusiastically.
When Cas walked the rest of the way into the command room, Dean started reconsidering the hide under the table plan, because it was definitely the least embarrassing of the two choices at this point. At least he had enough good karma saved up to have Cas choose to sit next to Sam so that he could look at the books his younger brother had been reading this whole time, while Dean was having about eighty billion existential crises a minute. The gender swapped hunter tried taking a few deep breaths, but it mostly just helped to keep him from screaming and running from the room. But beggars can’t be choosers and all that crap, so he just kept breathing.
“Exactly,” Dean replied, before they stared at the box again, stunned. They only managed to shake out of it when they saw the gift tag that had been attached to the box’s wrapping.
“Dean,” Cas said, louder this time. “I’m not doing this.” When Dean finally turned to look at Cas, he dropped his half-filled duffel bag on the bed and stared in disbelief.
"Oh, really?"
“I happen to like it,” Cas stated plainly, as if he wasn’t wearing the brightest damn rainbow colored shirt in the world.
Giving Cas her own apologetic look, Charlie tried to continue scheming, but failed miserably even after concentrating really, really hard. “Yeah, he is definitely weird like that,” she said forlornly when she finally admitted to herself that she’d given up. “So that kind of takes away a lot of our options.”
"Asshole," Dean muttered, huffing off in fake annoyance while Castiel laughed at his own stupid joke. But even while he was laughing, he still managed to appreciate the view. Dean had forgotten to put his own clothing on, and Castiel happily watched him stalk all the way down the hall with a pleased smile on his face. He would've mentioned it, but why spoil a good thing?
Dean smiled happily as he wiped his mouth off. Two cheeseburgers and a hot dog had filled him up enough so that he didn’t have any room left over for nervousness. Plus, literally every single person they’d interacted with so far had been super nice, and not even the fake kind of nice. They would definitely have to start doing more stuff in town during their down time, if this was what the pace was like. Mind you, it wasn't just locals since there was barely enough of them to fill a football stadium, but the people who’d come from nearby had all been nice, too. And he couldn’t help but notice that a lot of people were wearing the pink, purple, and blue colors that represented bisexual, which helped his nerves calm down even more. There were plenty of rainbows, sure, and a bunch of other flag color things too, but the overwhelming majority seemed to be bi.
“I thought I would be helping, Dean,” Castiel replied, finally angry enough himself to meet Dean’s level of shouting. “I thought I would be saving everybody by locking Heaven. I had no way of knowing that Metatron was double crossing me the whole time.”
"There was an Indiana Jones triple feature at the movie theater in town," Sam explained, still not used to this ever repeating cycle. Fight, loud sex, then sweet and lovey dovey afterwards. It just made no sense to him.
Well, here goes nothing (except an entire Saturday afternoon wasted). At least he’d thought enough to bring his sketchpad to help ease the boredom. He hadn’t needed reference pictures for most animals since he was still in high school, so he was going to draw up a rough draft of his next full sized, not-on-kitschy-wood painting. He already had a spot in his basement/painting studio that it would look absolutely awesome in.
"That's a lot of dates," Castiel said, not sure if Dean was teasing or not. He really hoped that Dean wasn't.
Cas stopped pacing, walking over to where Dean was sitting like he was about to leave for war. “It hurts me, Dean, because…” Dean had never seen the angel look even half as nervous, even when he ‘saved’ Cas from the brothel. He reached out his hand for a moment, before yanking it back. “Because I care about you, Dean.”
“But you were, and you had April bring me back,” Castiel reminded him, not paying attention at the guilty looking face Dean sported for all of five seconds. “I know you see me as family, Dean, as I do you and Sam, but if I had been able to truly save you and Sam and everybody else, I would have gladly died.” Castiel forced a smile, trying to convince Dean that he fully meant his words. The part where he’d sacrifice his life was completely honest, but being happy about it was definitely a stretch, especially since he still wasn’t entirely used to lying just yet.
“Oh, you’ve had all the deeds and legalities of my ass for ages now,” Dean replied, sticking his tongue out at Castiel. “All my other bits too, dangly or otherwise.”
Sunday, August 29th
“When I brought you back,” Castiel repeated, raising an eyebrow at Dean to let him know that he wouldn’t allow interruptions this time. “Your body had been destroyed by the hell hounds before sitting in a coffin for four months, so I had to… remake it, almost from scratch.”
“Just,” Dean said, holding his hand up because he seriously didn’t know how to react to anything like this. He waved it around in annoyance, before standing up, Cas automatically at his side. “We’ll just never talk about this ever again,” he mumbled.
Cas looked at Dean then, finally. “You wanted to kiss me?”
“Yeah,” Dean said, finally seeing how this was going now, where it had always been going. “I’d love to date you, Cas.”
Only then did Castiel remember that they'd spent this entire time with Dean in nothing but underwear. "Of course, of course, just lemme," he gestured vaguely to the area behind the camera where he kept his stuff. He rushed over to grab his phone while Dean grabbed his forgotten robe. Castiel handed him his phone, and Dean added his number to the contacts list.
Cas leaned over to Kiss Dean lightly on the lips as he handed over the bottle. Then he settled in next to Dean, taking nowhere near as long luxuriating in the sumptuous Heaven bed as Dean had but still managing to look much more comfortably satisfied. “I never thought I would be able to have this,” Cas admitted wistfully.
Cas started untangling their limbs as he nodded. After a few quick flashes from his angel mojo, they got off the now clean bed and put their now fixed clothing onto their now clean and undamaged bodies. Cas only left the headboard as is because Dean liked to count the broken ones as trophies. This was the third one this month.
“You’re a sarcastic sonnovagun, aren’t you?” Dean asks, not unkindly. At least, Castiel doesn’t think it’s meant unkindly; that doesn’t always mean he’s right.
Eyes wide, mouth parted, Castiel shifts to make room.
“Because... you didn’t want
“Do you know my burial preferences?”
“To wear.”
“It’s an adapter for my phone. The iPod thing was like a decade ago.”
“As much as possible.”
“I can’t ask someone out at work,” Castiel repeats to Kelly, firm on this boundary.
“Yeah, I threw the party, Cas, I know.”
“Switch,” Cas instructs, and they do, changing their grips on the other’s arms. Dean stops pressing his feet to Cas’ ankles so Cas can push on him instead. Wide is the aim of the game today. No cramping allowed. It’s a dumb choice of position in that regard.
“B- Master!” Dean corrects. “
“I’m gonna open the package and look at them, but not put them on.”
Castiel points with his blade, indicating the center of a new and growing alliance. The fighters in the arena have dwindled far enough to make Alistair’s point for him: unless the remaining combatants unite against Prince Samuel’s group now, the weight of superior numbers will crush them. “Do you know that alpha?”
“A lot of people fuck after funerals, it’s not that weird,” Dean continues. “So... yeah. A couple months late on the timing, but. Not that weird.”
To Dean’s delight, he and Benny pick right back up where they’d left off, friendship-wise. Even with scent-blockers and scent replacement, skin-to-skin contact reveals the lie easily enough as to Dean’s designation. Some alphas find Dean neutral to the touch, some real picky ones have to work through it, but every so often, there’s the unicorn that is Benny, perfectly pleased to fondle Dean’s knot while wrapping an arm around Dean’s neck.
Clears his throat.
While Dean steadies himself, Castiel loosens his grip. His arms drift lower to Dean’s waist, the better to guide his center of gravity. And Dean stares at him, silhouetted by the motel lights. Beyond Dean, the gap in the window blinds has vanished.
The tiny pair, black lace over black silk, fully crossing the line from underwear and into male lingerie.
Hunter Ryder’s an alpha slut who cares more about taking a knot than using his own.
If Dean had been surprised by Castiel’s drink choice, it’s nothing compared to Dean’s double-take at that. “Uh.” Eyes wide, mouth open but pulled sideways, Dean takes a second. “Sorry, not sure how you’re meaning it, but that sounds like a bedroom question to me.”
“Mislead? What? No, dude. Hey.” Frowning in return, Dean reaches up to cup Castiel’s face. “No way. Okay? I… Look. We are both plenty pretty enough, we don’t need to go bumping uglies.”
“Can I get you boys anything?” the bartender interrupts. “Drinks while you decide?”
Dean is not a cat person.
Dean widens his stance, relaxes as completely as he knows how, and thinks the euphoric, horny, disbelieving mantra of
“Time’s up,” says one of the twins with a nervous laugh. The other one simply narrows his eyes toward the opening door and the hallway beyond, leading out into sunlight.
“Why didn’t I think of that.”
All in one second.
Jack belches like a fucking pro, then downgrades from screaming to crying.
Mesh backed pair for the morning, he decides, stroking fast. Make Cas breakfast in the kitchen, apron and these and nothing else. He’s gonna tease Cas so hard, Cas won’t have any other choice than to spank Dean’s ass as red as the fabric.
Another tortured pause. “...Wear one. Bring them all.”
Castiel rolls his eyes, taking in a quick glimpse of a baseball game as he does. “I didn’t mean
Dean shakes his head beneath his arm, eyes closed tight.
Besides, clumsy ain’t bad. Just means Dean has to lick Castiel’s fingers a little bit more.
nevertheless very loud. He turns away before Dean can attempt to gain the last word, not that this has ever stopped Dean from trying before.
“But not us.”
Benny whistles, low and appreciative. “I’m not getting in edgewise here, am I.”
He showers accordingly, then cleans out the shower drain accordingly. He inspects himself more closely than he usually does, crotch and dick and all the rest. He leans close to the bathroom mirror before deciding to shave his face and style his hair.
No matter what Dean does, no matter how he tries, there’s nothing to be done. Castiel only nudges Dean’s knees farther apart with each failed attempt, until there’s no telling whether Dean’s tears are of frustration or the immense pain of his legs or of the agony of tight, wet jeans tugging against his dick.
Then, leaning back once more, Dean sighs out a massive exhale. “Okay,” he says, like he’s making some kind of decision. Like perhaps Castiel’s overreaction means Dean will be gone for good in the next thirty seconds.
One power red donation later, Castiel whirls around in confusion as he hears Hannah say, “Dean, your appointment isn’t until next week. On
Mentally riffling through his schedule, Dean nods. He’d picked this week for a reason, after all. Immediately after midterms—his
“You’ve mentioned him a couple times,” Kelly reminds him. “The nervous man you tuck in. You were disappointed on Friday because you forgot he wasn’t coming in.”
Polite clapping sounds from the stands, though a fair amount is pitying as the first casualties are pulled from the field.
“Glad it’s you I’m paired up with, brother,” Benny murmurs into Dean’s ear, freakin’ reading his mind.
And still Castiel stares at him as if made for that sole task.
“My heart is already claimed,” Castiel declares. “I could scent all the world and remain unswayed.”
“Should I stop?”
“Touch him again, and you will be,” Balthazar tells her.
“In front of me.”
Just as Cas starts to turn on the bar stool, Dean slides off his. His crotch hits Cas’ hip. His hand lifts to permanent five o’clock shadow. Dean pulls and stoops and shuts his eyes to block out the startled confusion staring back at him.
“Spank me,” Dean gasps. “Hit me with the ring on.”
“Do you not want me?” Dean interrupts. He crowds forward, unable to prevent it. “Look, I get not wanting to tank your career, saddling yourself to one partner-”
There sits Princess Madison, brunette and fair.
“Nobody fucks like you, pal,” Dean mumbles. Though he provides both his hands, he lets Castiel use them, move them, set the rhythm. Maybe he’s too groggy to do otherwise. Maybe he likes holding hands around Castiel’s cock.
And then…
They raise their weapons in pained, cautious unison.
“He’s Jack’s favorite Halloween monster, for obvious reasons.”
Back and forth, Castiel drags himself against Dean, a clothed and increasingly hard bulge. “Tell me, and I can build a scene around it.”
“Second, that all combatants shall remain in place each time the horns blow thrice! At which time, all defeated alphas incapable of leaving the field of battle shall be escorted out! Should there be
“More if you actually bite him,” Gabriel counters. “Not to rush that decision for you or anything, but if you did that tomorrow, the paycheck would reflect that.”
And it’s a dumb thing to want.
“That’s it. Thaaaat’s it,” Dean tells Jack, rocking him back and forth until the cries settle into more of grumbling hiccups.
Loosening the tension on the tie, Castiel instead pulls Dean back an inch by the hair. “Tell me how you’ve been my good boy, Dean.”
The bonds on his wrists tether him in place when momentum seeks to send him flying. His shoulders ache at the tug.
“What?” Dean asks.
“There are tax benefits,” Castiel points out.
“If you can’t afford to support your cats anymore, there are people who can help,” the guy begins. “There’s no shame in-”
Limp and shaking, Dean lets himself be used. With grunts and groans, he begs to be used, unable to keep going on his own. Castiel fucks into his mouth. Fucks him deep and fucks him hard. Dean’s lungs and brain and blood agree that it’s time to pass out, that there’s not enough air, but the white-blue glow in Castiel’s eyes disagrees. It overrules reality.
“Sam said to come get you, because dinner’s ready,” he explained, and a mild tingle went down Dean’s spine at how much the angel’s voice affected him lately.
Dean started to slide down Cas' body, tugging at the drawstring on the angel's pants as he went. He could hear Cas making the nervous noises that he did whenever he felt like he was being too greedy, but Dean knew better on this and thus ignored them.
An arm shot up from the mountain of dishware and other home-goods, an obnoxiously bright colored box in its hand. “Then I repeat,” Dean repeated, “what the hell is this?”
a fine specimen of man meat, you gotta admit,” she told him, waggling her eyebrows at him. “Such a great ass. I wish you’d’ve let me borrow him for a long weekend before you dumped him, though. I would’ve returned him in one piece. Mostly.” This time she laughed loudly.
“Chocolate,” she told him seriously.
"Yeah, I know," Dean replied, and for some reason blushing harder as he said it.
Even without working there, he spotted the eight new shirts almost immediately. One of them, the AC/DC one, Dean had been wearing underneath his flannel shirt today, and Castiel couldn't help but wonder if buying one for himself would make him cross the line from cute stalking to total creeper. Yeah, maybe not then. At least today. But it was only because he actually liked the shirt as well, even if it wasn't on Dean. Ugh…
“Hey, Cas,” Dean tried to not stutter out. “What’s up?”
Dean, on the other hand, started to get annoyed. Was Cas already starting to treat him like he’d always been a girl? Him and Sam better not be going around treating him like he’s any less of a strong, capable man, even if he wasn’t technically one at the moment. He refused to be thought of as weak. And damn it, he was going to prove it to them, but especially to himself. He stood up onto his annoyingly dainty, even inside manly combat boots (from the women’s side of the shoe department), feet and headed to his room to grab his laptop.
Once the two were back in the Impala, Dean gave Castiel the most pleading look ever. “I didn’t even realize it,” he said to the angel. “I am so sorry, but I swear, I thought you were just being paranoid, it being your first romantic relationship and all. I’m so sorry, please forgive me?”
"What happened?" Sam asked as he sat back down in his own seat.
Dean nodded and patted the seat next to him in invitation for Castiel to join them. “Yeah, I caught Sammy forcing the poor kid to watch documentaries, and figured he’d need a good, classic education in entertainment to make up for it.”
While Sam stared after the new couple, Mrs. Butters put her hand on Jack’s shoulder. “Now, how about we go watch that parade?”
Dean shook his head to clear out the overly dramatic girl thoughts, which reminded him about his hair. Grabbing one of the elastic hair bands from Sam's room, he was pulling his stupid long hair back into the semblance of a ponytail as he entered the library.
“Pointless yet annoying?” Dean asked.
His name was Dean, and as much as Castiel didn't want to admit it, he'd been minor level stalking the guy for almost a year now. It didn't technically count as stalking, though, since all he did was shop at that particular Hot Topic at least a few times a month, but it kinda felt that way since he was going to see the hottie cashier and not the latest Funko Pops. Though at least his wardrobe had turned out a lot more interesting in the last year, and it was actually all stuff he liked. Dean was responsible for that, too.
“The fuck, Dean?” Cas hissed, grumpy when he woke up under normal conditions, and these were not normal conditions.
“It’s been a long time,” Cas said, starting the obligatory small talk portion of their evening. “I was hoping to run into you, actually.”
Dean left his long sought for very slightly more comfy than the rest of the perfect bed to snuggle in closer to Cas. “I wish I’d known that you wanted this earlier,” Dean said, ignoring his perfect temperature beer to nuzzle into Cas’ neck. “I wish that we’d known all this before.”
Apple turnover all but inhaled, it tasted that freaking good, and a reminder note in front of him to head over to that booth before he left to buy everything they had, Dean went back to his not-stalkery-at-all drawing. He felt like a child every time he snuck a glance over at Cas, but his luck held and he never got caught, mostly since the guy’s booth was probably the most popular one at the whole craft fair, at least from what little Dean had seen of the rest of the place. He was putting on the last few finishing touches of the portrait in between customers of his own, and hadn’t realized how much time had passed until his concentration was broken once again by a cough. Looking up excitedly, hoping it was Cas again, he groaned in disappointment when it was only Sam.
Castiel tells Dean about remaking his body while explaining how healing grace worked, which unintentionally leads to confessions and frottage, though not in that order.
Cas chuckled again. “Yeah, I’ll talk to you tonight, Dean.” They awkwardly waved before Dean was finally dragged away by his brother.
Castiel tilted his head at the hunter. “Yes?” Even though he was an angel, this conversation was still managing to give him a headache. Why couldn’t Dean just say what he meant? It would probably make both their lives easier at this point.
It took a few seconds for all the words to register properly, then Castiel felt his smile fall off a proverbial cliff. “Oh, your…” He was the only widow he knew, since he was so young and his family so small, so he wasn’t really sure how to go about comforting another.
Before Dean could say anything else, though, they heard Charlie yelling from the unappetizing table. “Eww! Gross! How is that supposed to be food?” One more sappy look between them, and then they both burst out laughing.
Dean finally managed to wiggle away after a few more moments of tickle torture, crawling over to sit on his side of the bed as he tried to catch his breath from all that giggling. "Maybe I don't want to make any bagels now," he pouted.
There was only a little rough handling before Cas pulled his mouth away, the argument not over yet, not by a long shot. "Fuck you too, Dean," he snarled, before fitting their mouths together and pushing them both into the wall behind Dean. He ground his hips into Dean, the need to dominate, to possess, stronger than ever before.
“I’m yours as well,” Castiel whispered into Dean’s ear in between feverish kisses.
“What’s going on?” Sam asked, before turning around himself. “Cas, why are you gliding towards Dean without moving your feet?” He asked, dumbfounded. Dean knew that feeling well, right now.
He rippled his tongue along the bottom of the shaft as he let the air back into his mouth, causing Cas to shiver and let out a sigh. Then Dean flattened his tongue and started to bob his head, paying special attention to the sensitive line on the underside. He sucked back and forth a few times, making sure to have plenty of wetness ready, when he pulled almost off. Instead, he went back to suckling the head. By now, Cas was past words, probably past letters completely, because he was expressing himself in moans and whimpers, sighs and the best kinds of groans. This was Dean's favorite music, but he would never want to share it with anyone.
Cas turned around, looking Dean directly in the eye. “Is that what you want me to do with you, Dean?” He asked again, using that goddamn eyebrow trick that got to Dean every fucking time.
Curiosity drove the angel to research lace underclothing when he was once again alone. He found hundreds of thousands of websites with lacy female undergarments for sale, or conventionally attractive female models wearing the lacy bras and panties. He found many, many more sites with the pictures and videos of what Dean called porn, but even with those, it was mostly the females wearing the lace. Most of the videos, he just skimmed through, actually using them for research purposes only. But a few videos caught his eye, as well as a couple pictures, of men wearing the lacy panties that were mostly marketed to women, and he couldn’t help but stare in wonder. If that was what Dean looked like underneath all his hunter regalia…
That was the signal that it was time to go to work for real. Blowing Cas' mind while blowing him was Dean's favorite new hobby, and he was definitely getting skilled at it. Taking in just the head of the penis, Dean suckled it, marveling at the mewling noises now coming from the other end of the couch. Playing a tiny bit with the sensitive, special spot underneath, Dean started to suck the rest of Cas' cock into his mouth, slowly, with movements of his tongue only making the sensation more intense.
“Yeah, there were a ton of other ones,” Dean said, trying so very hard to hold in his giggles.
“Sam’s gonna be here with the moving truck any minute, so we better finish up,” Dean said sadly. “You good?”
“I really should’ve asked that ten yeas ago,” Dean reprimanded himself, but Cas took hold of his hand and squeezed it.
it now,” he explained slowly, as if Castiel were an idiot.
It had been the same thing every so often in the last three months, ever since Dean had finally got over his emotional insecurities and confessed to Castiel that he was in love with him. Crowley had been flirting with Dean more than ever since the Mark of Cain had turned him into a Knight of Hell, and the demon was very good at ignoring every single stop sign Dean or Castiel threw his way. Only Dean had gone back to being oblivious once he and Castiel had started dating, so it was up to the angel to protect his territory, so to speak.
"Yeah," Dean breathily admitted, straining to reach the coveted lube. "And because I love fucking you senseless." He strained further, only to slip off of Cas' thighs altogether.
“Not as festive,” Mrs. Butters continued, sparing only a quick glance to playfully glare at Sam. “But I’m sure seeing the Snoopy balloon fly past Macy’s will more than make up for it.” She put the potatoes next to the rest of the side dishes, then nodded at Sam. “And if you’d bring the turkey in, please, we can start dinner.”
Cas nodded again.
“I had to remake almost every part of your body, Dean,” Castiel explained. “And I had to do it by using what I could from your soul. Everything that you were, and are, and could be was stored in there, and I had to dig very deeply to find everything I needed to know.”
“You… were?” Dean asked, dumbfounded by this new information. Cas nodded solemnly. “And, you’d wanna do it again?” He asked, still completely thrown by the events of the last few minutes.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas greeted, his gravelly voice deeper and sexier than ten years ago. Maybe it was a good thing he didn’t bring Jo; she’d be teasing him for the next century for how he was acting right now.
Castiel had tried masturbating before, especially since he became borderline obsessed with Dean’s lacy panties, but it had never felt anywhere this good, and this was only from a light touch. He shoved his way back into Deans’ face and his mouth, needing more than he ever knew, and needing it from this man in front of him. Right now.
Cas growled, pouncing onto Dean and pulling him into the raunchiest kiss this side of Hell, and it was Dean's turn to let out a moan. But as enjoyable as getting ravaged by his super-angel boyfriend was, Dean had a different goal in mind.
“And I still love you, Dean,” Cas said, both of them closing in for a kiss that had been far too long in the making. They only parted when the angel felt Dean start to shiver. “Let’s get you home, Dean,” he suggested, and the hunter immediately agreed.
Dean hastily pushed aside a bunch of boxes, probably breaking some of the contents yet not caring in the slightest. “Room for two,” he suggested, patting the plush carpet next to him before pulling his own tie off in a single, practiced movement. Castiel was on his mouth in seconds, and the next day they had to pay extra cleaning fees, but it had been totally worth it.
Cas, wearing a pleased smile of his own now, raised one of his eyebrows at Dean. But only one. Dean made sure not to squeak at the hotness. “Are you asking me to go steady?” Cas teased.
“Fucking with you cuz I’m bored,” Dean admitted. It was mostly true, at least. He’d been crushing on Cas for way too long, but he was too chickenshit to do anything about it because why would a freaking
Dean was moaning about being ‘close, so close,’ when Castiel felt himself start to falter in rhythm. The white hot ball of pleasure that had been building in him since he saw that black lace sticking out from beneath denim was close to exploding, and though he wanted this feeling to go on forever, he knew that when he orgasmed it would be the greatest thing he had ever felt. With Dean whining beneath him, sweaty and out of breath and so very needy, more beautiful than should even be possible, Castiel felt on the very edge of orgasm, and thrust as hard as he could without hurting Dean, once, twice, and then the world disappeared in a cloud of white haze and Heavenly bliss that he would gladly get lost in for centuries if he could. The only thing that pulled him out of his post-orgasm departure from reality was the feeling of Dean squeezing him so hard he almost felt like he could orgasm again, then getting hit with warm fluid and Dean screaming his name in one giant, debauched moan. The hunter mimicked the movements for a few more moments before slumping onto the seat as if boneless.
“I can plant another garden in our new home, Dean,” Castiel explained once again, having had this same conversation over and over again since Dean got hired three months ago. “And we can make new memories in our new home.”
“God no,” Dean all but yelped. “Never again. Apple pies should never have to suffer like that, ever again. And the stove stunk for at least five months, no matter what I used to clean it.” They both smiled, living in the past for just a few more moments.
“Then stay, have a beer or two, you could probably use the company.” Dean patted Cas on the back as he went past, loving the feel of the trenchcoat fibers beneath his fingertips. Yeah, he would have to learn to be a lot less lame if he were ever to spill his big bi crush secret.
“Don’t,” Cas called after her, but she didn’t hear him.
They were only a few inches apart now, and that triggered Dean’s blush to come all the way up his face; Castiel couldn’t help but smile at it. Dean started to open his mouth to say something, most likely another deflection, but Castiel put his fingers over Dean’s lips to stop him. “No,” he said, softly commanding. “You will accept the praise because you deserve it.” Dean’s sharp intake of breath and heated gaze at those words didn’t make sense to the angel at first, but when they did, he leaned down closer to Dean. “Thank you,” he whispered as he removed his finger and replaced it with his lips.
Dean blushed a little, chuckling as well. "Guess you must've fucked my brains out, then."
Castiel reminisces about his life and family with Dean as they're about to move to a new state and new memories.
The two laughed a few moments after Dean hit
“Yes, Dean,” Cas replied, now glowing as red as the hunter.
"Well, that's it, then," Castiel said, trying to hide his regret. "You were amazing, Dean," he added, because he needed to congratulate the model for being that great at his job, and needed to pep himself up for the next person, too.
“Story of my life, Cas,” Dean responded. “Everybody was pretty surprised when I presented, most of all me.” Dean handed Castiel a napkin before he’d even noticed that Claire was being a bit messier than usual with her mostly-demolished cone.
Castiel swore under his breath as Dean blushed. "Yeah, we're getting there, Meg," he lied, shuffling some papers around to try and sound busy.
before time had meaning, if you could even call how he came into existence a birth. Which meant, in human terms, he didn’t actually have a birthday. But the little tag on the present in front of him seemed to disagree.
“Sam needs us to burn this body as soon as possible, because he can only keep that ghost away from those schoolchildren for so long,” Cas once again reminded Dean. He’d been digging at this damn grave for ten minutes already, and it felt like he was barely getting anywhere with it.
Cas tugged at the hem of his skirt self-consciously. “The babysitter in the video was also wearing a skirt, Dean, so I thought…”
Instead of answering verbally, Castiel sat the pile of clean laundry on the bed and carried the box to Dean. “Please don’t tell me you were planning on using these?” Castiel begged, half serious.
“I love you, Dean,” Cas all but whispered, dejected already.
Castiel stares at Dean’s crotch, absolutely floored.
When Castiel reemerges, Meg is standing at the short dividing wall behind Hannah’s computer at the reception desk. Meg looks over at Castiel with an oddly serious expression. “Hannah meant to tell you something earlier today,” Meg calls over.
A few more full blood donations later, Castiel unhooks Dean as well, prompting him to hold gauze. Still familiar with the routine, Dean complies almost before Castiel can ask it. Now, at least, much of the tension in Dean’s arms has receded.
“Okay,” Dean says. “All right.” That bobbing, rocking nod continues. It’s not how Castiel himself stims, but it’s clear Dean needs to do this right now.
“Right, sorry, I’m just.” Vibrating. Stiffly, hand stuck to his own crotch, Dean kneels down for his own benefit, right on the linoleum. If he doesn’t sit back on his heels, the package on the kitchenette counter is perfectly at eye level.
“I trust her to obey me,” Castiel replies.
Tammy smiles at Dean gently, sympathetically. “My sister just came out too. It’s okay, you don’t have to be so nervous.”
“Cassie, up front,” Balthazar calls, jerking his head pointedly. Castiel looks and sees.
“We got this,” Dean says, pulling Cas forward into a deeper stretch. They sit on the floor, legs spread wide, taking turns drawing their partner forward and down. “No one’s got what we got, ‘cause I’ve got you,” Dean adds, the closest thing he has to a pep talk.
“With enough shade, yes.”
“You know what I like about these?” Dean asks.
Dean turns his head, kisses Cas on the forehead. “You were great.”
, the Cas-and-Dean
Castiel leans more heavily against the wall.
Castiel nods.
at that point, though, right? Because Cas does weird shit sometimes, especially after Dean makes him watch movies. He goes way too cowboy, interrogates way too hard, just
A wrenching twist traps Dean’s arms behind him; one vise-like hand secures them there. Still warm with impact, the striking palm covers Dean’s gasp of pain, clamping his mouth shut. One strong arm drags Dean forward against that immovable body, just as that muffling hand pushes Dean backward. With his feet once again free, Dean barely keeps from falling over Castiel’s arm at his back. The only leverage keeping Dean from falling is the hard press of Dean’s crotch against Castiel’s.
Sighing, Castiel sits beside him, cock still out and still half-hard.
“Almost there,” Castiel promises. Rectal glands are only meant to lubricate the way for feces, but, lacking the need to defecate, Castiel has found a better use for his. When he’s adequately prepared, his sphincter suitably relaxed, he bobs his head in a nod.
Unable to speak, Dean grabs at Castiel’s coat. Not the hem, but the waist tie, forever untied. Dean grabs and pulls and, somehow, the tie doesn’t pull free, doesn’t slip from the loops against Castiel’s hips.
work with the caramelized onions. Lemme know. You pick a movie yet?”
“Yeah,” Hunter answers. “You and, uh, Hannah, right? Keep an eye on Gordon.”
“Enough to have protocols for them,” Castiel replies. “We don’t recruit omegas, officially, but anyone who makes it to the front lines is permitted to stay, if they can hold their own.”
From that day on, Castiel withstands the gifts of textbooks and travel logs. He navigates an extremely confusing period of determining whether it is Samuel or Dean Winchester who he is meant to be pledged to. He endures the relayed snatches of poetry written about his alleged love but does, at least, learn that the omega is Dean.
It’s Cas who starts to wane. With each new check, he winces with the pain of clenching down. He holds Dean’s gaze with the same steadfast determination he holds Dean’s knot, but even Cas has to blink eventually.
The look on Castiel’s face.
“Normally a week of advanced notice means a lot of planning,” Cas tells him, reminds him. “Is the reward that complicated?”
Jimmy spanks him, starting with small slaps and working his way up to solid, open-handed blows. His technique is a little sloppy, but Jimmy definitely knows the theory behind the practice. Clearly, it’s been way too long since he was hired to play the Dom, but fuck if there isn’t gonna be loads of Domega work in his future. “Just for that, it’s going to
And up.
When Castiel is hard, Castiel takes Dean’s mouth.
With one outstretched hand still binding Dean to the ground, the Castiel facsimile slows to a stop. The glow in his eyes fades enough not to blind. Even so, those eyes remain the brightest two spots in the building.
Two weeks later, there’s a name on the schedule Castiel recognizes. Today, Meg’s the one to process Dean Winchester, and Dean keeps looking across the donation center as if hoping Castiel will rescue him from her. Meg’s bedside manner is far more abrupt than Castiel’s, which is saying something, but she’s hardly about to hurt anyone. Beyond the harm of a needle prick, at least.
Castiel stares down at him. “Are you… asking me?” Castiel pieces together, pointing between them and waiting for Dean’s correction to the contrary.
Desperately, distantly, Castiel prays through the pounding of his head that Hunter… that Hunter…
Smelling each other is a hell of a thing. Always has been, regardless of the push for scent blockers on scene. But now, mated, it’s something else entirely. Smelling other alphas, knowing Cas is naked under that robe, it smacks Dean’s instincts around something fierce.
“Fuck yeah…”
As Prince Samuel speaks, Hannah looks to Castiel with questions in her eyes. Castiel ignores them, instead watching Balthazar rise to his hands and knees with an immense groan. The effort visibly costing him, Balthazar forces himself upright. Under the referee’s direction, Balthazar walks a short span, an undeniable stiffness underlining his typically showy manner. Dirt and blood smear down his left cheek, and he’s favoring one leg despite his best efforts to do otherwise.
“I’m not just asking,” Dean explains. “I mean, yeah, I’m asking, asking is kinda the thing, but it’s only a part of it. It’s like, I want… I
“If you don’t tell me, it’s chastity until Friday,” Castiel states flatly.
“Uh,” Dean says. “Okay?” He coughs despite there being nothing wrong with his lungs; Castiel checks regularly. “Not exactly sure what you slipping into something a little more comfortable is going to do to help.”
around him. “Ah, shit, you, you don’t wanna jizz on my panties? No reward for you?”
“Awesome,” Dean agrees, face on fire. “You, uh. GPS.”
Instead, Dean moves his arm back, now clasping his hands amid the V of his thighs. “I’m bi. I’m guessing you’re, what, asexual?”
In the back of Castiel’s mind, he knows how most fell. Remembers one twin falling, and the other going out of control with rage. Their group has dwindled to six, Castiel’s trio included. Ava and Gordon remain, along with Captain Talley.
“Nope.” Then, right before Cas can press the button: “Wait, you’ve got, like, five mugs in the office.”
Fuck, what next.
Unable to see anything other than his mate and the mat, Dean waits for Cas’ signal, for the double-tug in his hair as the ref approaches. He takes deep, deep breaths.
“Your pulse is still on the high end,” Castiel notes. “It’s not high enough to be serious, but it’s something you may want to mention to your doctor.”
They have to let go when their burgers arrive, transitioning instead to swapping fries for onion rings and trading bites of each other’s burgers. Dean starts off shy about drinking his Shirley Temple for some reason, but he relaxes more the longer they talk.
“Nah, I’m good.”
s too much. But that’s Cas.
Behind Castiel, Hunter huffs out a shaking breath. “You got the prince’s favor, all right.”
“Okay, yeah, sorry,” Dean says. “Child abuse, not exactly the best joke subject.”
Castiel nods and drapes his coat over the stool Dean had been saving. “I see you are too.”
He drives home on the early side, or at least early for him. His phone beeps with a text along the way, but when Dean checks it at a red light, it’s not Cas asking for a ride home.
“Hello, Baby,” Castiel solemnly greets the muscle car, provoking yet more laughter from Dean.
“When did you,” Castiel starts to ask.
Castiel narrows his eyes. “I’m not sure where you’re going with this.”
Arriving two days before the melee is to take place, Castiel seeks an alliance with a suitable alpha: namely, one he can help win in his stead.
“If I didn’t take care of things, you’d be fucked up against this wall now,” Jimmy tells him, taunts him. “Is that what you want? Is your Master’s cock not enough for you?”
Dean steals the remote. “I didn’t say no.”
By the time summer begins to tip over into autumn, they’re no longer dating so much as romantically hanging out. The domesticity and Dean’s eager if fumbling accommodation combine into an uneasy but familiar guilt in Castiel’s chest.
With Dean’s entire body draped across him, Castiel has no need or reason to argue. “Yes.” He urges Dean’s hands into a tight tunnel and makes use of it. “We are.”
Castiel nuzzles disagreement against Dean’s shoulder. “I hit harder than I’d meant to.”
“Temperature first,” Castiel reminds him, and pulls out the thermometer.
“The process is similar, yes,” Castiel answers. “While your blood is out of your body, it will cool somewhat. You might start to feel cold, which is why we have blankets. Also, the anticoagulant upsets some donors’ stomachs, which is why we have Tums. Ask for either if you need them. I’m also going to warn you that it’s your last chance to use the restroom for two hours.”
Shaking, Castiel stands.
Castiel brushes the tears away only from the corners of Dean’s eyes. “You’re so good for me, Dean. You can do this. You’re the little spoon now, I’ll stop pushing so hard.”
“That won’t be an issue,” Castiel says simply. “It’s a solo role. I’ve thought about it a great deal.”
“Okay, ‘cause that’s-”
“I-I’m free this weekend,” Dean answers, expression moving toward the incredulous, but in a happy way.
At this, the man finally stops in his tracks. Even with a cart still between them, it’s not reassuring, considering the guy could ram Dean with it. Or, more importantly, scratch Baby.
That, and maintain position.
Hunter laughs again. “Yeah. Sure. Let’s go with that.”
Castiel remains confused at Dean’s confusion, but a couple of pricks and a few tucks of a blanket later, he has other things to focus on.
“Tell me how.”
“Show me how badly you want me,” Castiel orders, pushing his fingers deep. He forces Dean against the fulcrum of his arm, over it, and it’s not Dean’s fault, it isn’t, it’s all reflex, wrapping one leg around Castiel’s hip. There’s nothing holding him up but Castiel.
Dean complies. Sweat dries against his back, prickling his skin. When Castiel fails to touch him, Dean flexes his ass and widens his stance.
“Too sensitive,” Castiel hisses when Dean tries to go back down, after, so Dean comes up instead. He shuffles around the table leg on his knees.
Which shouldn’t matter. Not for the unbreakable omega.
And promptly slips on the ice.
Prince Samuel smacks his spear against his shield the once, and the remainder of their line picks up the beat on the second strike. Shoulder to shoulder with the prince, Castiel joins on the third.
“I- Never mind.” He sets his hand on Castiel’s shoulder in a vague attempt to ground himself, or maybe to ground Cas. “You’re not dying, Cas.” It’s only while waving his finger in Castiel’s face that he realizes he should maybe ask that question. “You’re not dying, right?”
“Dean?” Sam asks, dragging the would-be summoner away from the spill. “Did you just-”
Jimmy makes a tense noise in his throat but nods. He’s back to as stiff and clearly uncomfortable as he was when Dean walked in, but, Dean reminds himself, that’s not something Dean actually has to care about. They’re never going to be working together, not really. Even here, they’ll walk in, get torn apart, and then fucked separately. Probably even filmed separately for the close-ups.
One hour one minute.
“Is it a lab coat?” Cas asks.
Ones with toys, ones with gear. Shorts meant to hold in anal plugs, tiny skimpy things with a cock ring included? A remote control vibrator, snuggled up beneath his balls?
Well after Castiel has accepted that he’ll get no answer, Hunter says, “Let’s just say he doesn’t take rejection well.”
Drawling a threat, Benny grabs Dean by the arm as one of the other alphas does the same for Jimmy, and as the tugs come, Dean and Jimmy have a single, impossibly flawless moment of coordination:
“Very good,” Castiel says, reaching for his thermometer. He clicks the rod into one of the many waiting covers before holding it out to Dean at mouth height. “Temperature check.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Had he been beautiful? No, of course not. No one is beautiful at thirteen, at such a shifting, twisting year of mismatched parts. But despite his changing body and wandering center of gravity, the omega had certainly proven his place on the field. Castiel had seen him only once after this: at the far side of the high table, opposite from where Castiel waited upon King Michael.
“Okay, you take a shower or something. I got this.”
“I brushed up on some of yours too,” Dean says, and he absolutely keeps the judgment from his tone. Gorgeous face on the omega, strong features undermined by a pretty pink mouth, but absolutely no range. Sure, there’d been some omega dom roles in Jimmy’s portfolio of work… which so happen to use the exact same facial expressions Jimmy uses while enduring a gangbang. It might be a different ring of the circus, but that doesn’t make it any less a one trick pony.
As Cas leaves to get them, Dean focuses on the pan. On getting the burnt little corner off. On his own breathing.
. Not a brick wall kind of no.
Willing to make nice, Dean holds his hands up. “Okay, I get it. You-”
Dean drives, every movement of his foot on the pedals shifting his leg, shifting his ass cheek. He plays his music and he grins his face off, and he goes to pick up his boyfriend. The music stays on high until his phone’s GPS tells him he’s close. Then he goes stealth mode, parking politely out front and turning the lights off.
He reaches up and pulls Dean down by the unbuttoned sides of his flannel. Dean bends down for the kiss, shuffling out of his jeans while they lock lips. When Cas pulls back, it’s with a fond look and a hand on Dean’s cheek.
, is Castiel’s immediate thought. And after that:
“Your father won’t grant you permission? Lord Robert seems a reasonable man.”
That’s the dream, isn’t it.
Maybe they can finish up before Cas gets here.
The shot rings out, their would-be conjurer falls, and they run the rest of the way in before the guy can try to get up.
Hunter says nothing.
Chin raised, nostrils flared, Castiel squeezes Dean’s face, palm and fingertips pinching Dean’s cheeks together, digging in where Dean’s teeth clench, until he has no choice but to open his mouth, to pant against Castiel’s fingers.
Except.
After a frankly absurd amount of time, they get Jack up to the front. Jack plunks himself down on Santa’s knee with no hesitation before cupping his hands and whispering something into the bearded gentleman’s ear. All goes as normal for about thirty seconds.
Both Kelly and Jack take to Castiel immediately, a reaction that may have something to do with a number of dead bounty hunters and a solemn promise that neither omega nor boy would be bargained back to Lucifer. Castiel sends both to the capital with a message to Michael that to flaunt the safety of the pair would do much to infuriate their enemy. Soon, another messenger returns, granting the child to Castiel as his page, if only within the capital.
Kelly says she already misses it, and Castiel agrees.
Once they’re both warm, if not presentable, Jimmy leads the way back to the omega dressing room, gripping Dean securely by the hand. Gabriel shouts after them that the no sex in the dressing rooms rule still applies, but Dean does them both a favor by pretending not to hear. Maybe they will, maybe they won’t, but some good heavy petting will definitely be called for.
untie yourself.”
If Dean could, he’d wrap his arms around those shoulders. If he could, he’d push down that abruptly unbuttoned shirt.
“Mmhm.”
“I’ll get the blanket,” Castiel decides for him.
from the right
Every minute, Dean loves him, and lusts for him, and knots him as hard as he fucking can.
“And given that I’m now ‘over the hill,’ I realize I’ve neglected certain guardrails.” Castiel shifts on the couch, turning to face Dean directly. “There are things in life I thought I’d have in hand by now, or at least further underway. But while we’re close, there are things we don’t discuss that I think we should.”
for you
“What... What was that for?” Dean asks right back.
Castiel goes cold. He looks to the king, waiting for the rebuke of corrupting his mate with another alpha’s scent, but King John merely watches, a question behind the stone of his eyes. With the attention of the arena on him, eager to see what he sees, King John does nothing more.
Cas buries his face in his hands.
Chest heaving, Castiel shakes his head. “Ask me for what you want, Dean.”
They spar.
Castiel steps aside and pivots, turning his back neither on Hunter nor on the object of Hunter’s focus.
The boy would be grown now, perhaps twenty-three or twenty-four. The alpha brother may yet be twenty, and some alphas remain unmated for a very long time, political pressure or not. Should the brother be picky enough, Castiel might remain unconcerned by this matter for a decade, long enough for much to change. It’s a thin hope, but still a hope.
“Yeah, I’m gonna fucking take care of you, what kind of a dumbass question is that?”
Fully clothed, Castiel strips Dean down in quick, efficient motions. He pushes Dean down onto the edge of the bed, kneels on Dean’s cushion, and blows him like he needs to drink Dean’s come to live. Fucking shaking, trembling all over, Dean comes as hard from the hot mouth around his dick as he does from the week of chastity, as he does from the sight of silver against Castiel’s hair where Dean holds desperately to him.
Dean’s dick jerks
“The memory remains.”
“Dean?” Cas asks, as if Cas is the one meant to be confused here.
“Thanks, Cas,” Sam says, taking his beer from Cas before patting him on the back. “You two have fun.”
That gets another frown from Castiel. “I… don’t picture dinosaurs having sex, generally.”
“Ninety-eight point six, good.” Castiel enters that in before putting on his stethoscope. “Arm, please.”
Castiel sighs. He looks down at Dean through an impossibly lengthening distance even as his fingers draw Dean up to the edge, the barrier of the coat be damned.
Dean pokes at it. “Do you ever want to?”
“I’m fine,” Dean insists.
“No.” Taking his heart in his hands, perhaps more literally than he’d prefer, Castiel lays his hand atop the back of Dean’s.
“Do you mean a second date?” Castiel asks.
Dean suppresses a snort at the thought. The only way Dean would be running away from here, would be toward a bed, with Jimmy in a fireman’s carry.
Once up, Dean kicks off the remainder of his pants, the tearaway clothing having made only half of its exodus. Back to the wall, he pants, “I wanna watch you fuck me.” His eyes dart down to where his own jizz and Jimmy’s slick drips and slides down Jimmy’s inner thighs. “God, you’re so fucking hot.”
“No.” Naturally, Jimmy’s only change of expression is for the worse.
“Yeah, no, I get it.” Despite the calm-sounding response, Dean continues to not quite look directly at Castiel, only at his gloved hands. “I’m basically on dialysis for two-ish hours, I know.”
And seizes Dean before the momentum can topple him.
“Bedroom,” Dean orders, the command only somewhat undercut by having Castiel pinned against the kitchenette island.
“No, that’s fine,” Cas says.
Alistair crumples.
Biting back an unexpected laugh, Castiel looks down, pressing deeper into the steadying hold of Dean’s palms. “I simply don’t want to deprive you,” Castiel mumbles.
“Yeah, but, hear me out: when we’re old as shit, we’re gonna have the best produced sex tapes ever of us being young and hot. That’ll be- Oh, great, thanks.” Dean accepts the change of costume from today’s assistant and shows it proudly to Cas. “And we get these!”
The way Dean’s mouth falls open and silently works while he looks away, however…
Speaking of pigeonholed acts, the mated pair making their entrance is one Dean knows best by reputation: lookalikes Michael and Adam Spearman are big names in the twincest market despite being unrelated and at least a decade apart in age. Possibly more. In a more PG alternate universe, Michael Spearman is that guy in Disney channel movies who’s played a passable twenty-something for the past twenty years. Scent bonding during filming has tanked more than its fair share of careers, but it’s launched these two into the stratosphere, especially now that Adam’s adopted Michael’s surname.
He smacks their mouths together. No teeth-on-teeth collision, but it ain’t soft. It’s nothing a first kiss should be, just deranged instinct freaking out in one concentrated direction. Cas’ mouth is a little open, going in, so it’s wetter than Dean had expected—hoped—but whatever mental lever that unclenches Dean’s jaw has gotten stuck. Dean’s closed mouth against Cas’ open one, bumping right up into the guy’s face.
He plans it out in advance. He knows which of his rants about TV shows make Dean laugh the hardest. He will ask if Dean would like to ever watch the show in order to rant along with him, and he will suggest a weekend. The offer will be casual. It won’t be pressing, but could be immediately fulfilled. Dean’s reaction will help him gauge Dean’s interest in him: higher enthusiasm is preferable, as is a sooner scheduling.
Castiel clears his throat and steps up to the counter.
“On his birthday. But also for most of a month after that. He’d been gone for four months.”
“Are you all right?” Castiel asks.
“Not that I’ve ever seen,” says another alpha who seems very comfortable with his blade. Gordon, Prince Samuel had called him. “There’s-”
“Uh, no,” Hunter immediately, harshly refuses. “Having my visor up is risky enough, Cas.”
A palm cradles the top of Dean’s head. A thumb pulls once across Dean’s eyelid.
Lying on his side, bare save for his suit pants, Castiel watches Dean’s silent struggle.
Dean absolutely cracks up.
“He’s matching you again,” Kelly murmurs, nodding to Jack. Presently, the boy is folding paper towels into what he has decided is the “fanciest napkin shape” before putting forks on them. He’s also wearing his church clothes, a white button-down and blue slacks.
“I do not look like a hospital gift shop teddy bear.”
“I’m sorry,” Cas says against Dean’s shoulder, so much urgency and stiffness in his exhausted frame. “Please don’t- I can’t lose you too.”
An unhappy dimple in his cheek, Dean says nothing.
“I do, I do,” Dean swears and promises. “Hit me, choke me, fuck me up, Cas, you gotta-”
Nodding, Castiel replies, “Take off your helmet.”
“Very good,” Castiel says, opening the correct file. “Since filling out your RapidPass have you: had sex with a man, taken any drugs by needle not prescribed by your doctor, or engaged in sex work?”
The crowd cheers in adoration, and Castiel’s heart shouts with them.
Biting his bottom lip, Dean starts to nod. “I can do that. That, that works.”
“Deal?” Sam says. “A kiss on the mouth, no cheating.”
“Yeah, no, I hear you,” Dean promises. “We can borrow my brother’s kids, make a whole basketball team out of ‘em.”
Dean does. Slow and languid. Sour, then refreshed to sweet. They pull on Castiel’s cock between them until Dean fades too far. Castiel stops holding himself back and comes, still in time for Dean to register this, to acknowledge this with a pleased hum against the corner of Castiel’s mouth.
“Understandable,” Castiel says. “Captain Talley, you know your companions best. What plans have you prepared?”
Wordlessly, Hunter begins to walk back to Prince Samuel and his single ally still standing.
Dean falls silent, waiting for Cas to compose himself.
“Are you free tonight?”
“Shit!” he shouts and instinctively hurls the shovel away from the car.
, Dean tries to shoot back, coughing and drooling against a hand that could crush his skull. His Cas, the real Cas, that Cas would never do this. A Cas who wouldn’t understand this or, worse, would pity him for it. A kind, awkward sympathy, bestowed in a platonic squeeze of the shoulder, not of his face or neck or dick.
“Tell me what you bought,” Castiel orders, rocking his foot from side to side, “and you can come.”
“Yeah, well. If he was, you’d be right.”
“Yeah, but there’s a limit on how many times I can over a couple months or a year or whatever,” Dean says. “If I pace myself out for every two weeks, it’ll be more consistent.”
“You bet I am,” Dean replies. “You wanna feel the mesh over my ass?”
“You don’t have to,” Cas says, and not in the way that foretells polite acceptance of a favor.
“Whatever you want, Dean.”
Dean tries to tuck himself away once, and only once.
Castiel leans back against him, into him. “Maybe you’re right.”
“How is that more creepy than the biscuit brigade?”
This time, Castiel makes it.
“Me, what about- What about you?” Dean counters. “Seriously, you’ve been a grumpy old man since the day we met and you weren’t even thirty yet. You sure your grump isn’t going to crowd me out?”
And again.
“Yeah, we thought that was for the walking.”
Once more, Castiel carefully tucks Dean in. “There. The next donor appointment isn’t for half an hour, so I can get a book from the reception area if you also need a bedtime story,” Castiel deadpans.
“By asking,” Dean answers without needing to think, addressing Castiel’s crotch. “Wanted this, asked for this. Being your good boy just the way you trained me.”
“And I love you,” Dean continues through it. “And I fed you, and made you coffee with sugar in it, and I love you. Know I already said that, but I get guilty sometimes, ‘cause I don’t tell you enough. But your good boy doesn’t get guilty, your good boy gets better, so I’m saying it, I love you.”
“I’m- I’m good,” Dean says, visibly taken aback at the question. “Yeah, I’m good. Sorry it’s been so long.”
“Yeah, but-”
Cas groans out something less like a no and more like a dramatic complaint. He rolls his head back, though, and that’s all Dean needs.
“Yeah, I don’t envy you.” Dean holds the gauze in place on his other arm without being told. Biting his lip, Dean adds, “Seriously, if you did want a night off to relax, we could go out for burgers or something, my treat.”
Remembers the sheer confidence that silk and satin brought him.
“Uh, yeah,” Dean says, visibly pulling himself from the depths of concentration. “Yeah, thanks. That’d be... Thanks.”
Dean carries Jack around the table to hip check Cas in the shoulder. “Move it.”
Dean rides the shaking giggling mass that is his mate, until he’s laughing too, until they’re cracking up together. They wheeze and giggle, set each other off, and repeat the whole thing at least twice more. It takes Dean half a minute after all that to realize the ref hasn’t checked them because Michael and Adam decoupled out of sheer confusion.
After bandaging and covering the arm of one donor and directing them toward the snacks in the canteen, Castiel hears the quiet clearing of a throat from behind him. “Uh, Cas? Cas, right?”
Panting, shaking, Dean looks up and nods.
“And,” Dean makes himself add. Makes himself interrupt. Because this part, this is crucial. He swallows. “I gotta be kneeling.”
Castiel makes the call and falls back to Hunter, taking Hannah with him. Two of Hunter’s allies raise their weapons, but Hunter recognizes Castiel in time to call them off.
“Do it.”
Reflexively, Dean lets go of the umbrella, but that doesn’t matter: Cas’ grip around his fingers means they’re effectively holding hands around the thing.
“Hey,” Dean calls through the dressing room door. “They want me getting ready in here.”
Still unsure, Castiel rises before the back of his shirt can freeze to the ground. Maintaining his balance by his will and grace, he walks around to the front of the car, noting how the melted snow has frozen. They might have to push the car free in neutral, but it’s essentially finished.
“How much input do you want?” Cas asks.
Dean puts both hands down on the kitchen island, no doubt putting a pair of sweaty palm prints onto the surface. “I, um.” Keeping calm. Being terrified, but keeping calm. “I got you something.”
Hours later, groggy and aroused in equal measure, Dean wakes to an odd combination of moaning and laughter, a hot dick in his hand.
Just a fingertip.
“I need to listen to your pulse now,” Castiel interrupts, all too aware of the rising tide of theoretical jealousy swelling up inside him. Maybe not so theoretical. Real jealousy to a hypothetical situation.
A desperate, trembling nod is the best Dean can do.
Cas straightens up and nods. “Right.”
“I think so,” Castiel says.
He learns many things, in fact. That the territory is one of contradictions, of fierce independence and fiercer loyalty. That the Winchester brothers were both raised in the expectation of presenting as alpha. That the omega refused to abandon his martial training after presenting.
“Show me,” Castiel commands.
Alphas charge toward in an immediate clash of shouts and steel. With sword and buckler, Castiel catches the first blade swung toward him, and Balthazar brings down his blunted sword on the attacking alpha’s wrist. The snap of bone and scent of blood are no sooner perceived than lost beneath the jumble. They kick the alpha the rest of the way down, knocking him into the knees of those behind him.
The clash itself lasts for barely a fraction of the time they’d spent posturing, as battles always do. The injured peel off or fall, and those who fall turn the terrain difficult. An alpha who can no longer fight can still always trip another.
Dean stares at him a moment longer before shaking his head. “Sorry, ignore that. You don’t need me poking into your personal life.”
His arm firmly around Castiel’s middle, Dean takes hold of Castiel’s hand. “See, this?” Dean threads their fingers together before pressing their joined hands against Castiel’s chest. “Way better than the staring.”
A chainmail coif over the head and neck is good protection against a slash. A mail coif can even be reasonable protection against a stab, should the hood be made of strong enough rings.
And this, that nigh-inhuman bulge, is what his imagination wants.
With much grunting and straining, the alpha crumples each time they attempt to stand.
The mesh backed pair, deep red and intentionally tight in the front.
Holding Dean steady, pinning Dean to him with one hand at the small of his back, Castiel raises his other hand to Dean’s face. Dean’s eyes widen, but he doesn’t jerk away as Castiel sets his thumb to the damaged lip, brushing away both blood and cut.
“Mm.” Jimmy resumes moving, a nice warm up drag as Dean’s insides get used to the idea.
“And I’ve been thinking about it a lot. Graduating soon, it’s put a lot of stuff into context. Like, yeah, I knew a lot of the shit already, but the networking’s been huge. Getting the right terms, figuring out how to explain stuff or ask for stuff, that’s been the most important across the board. So, yeah, it’s corny as shit, but even though you never had me in a single class, you’re still hands down my best teacher, ‘cause you’ve been working with me on that since day one.
,” Castiel orders.
Serving as a shield, Balthazar stays to Castiel’s right. Serving as a wall, Hannah remains behind him. The motions of the rest of the raiding party fit together only roughly, marking Castiel, Hannah, and Balthazar out as a tight three-person unit amid the greater group. Their captain shouts out which direction needs reinforcing, and this is how they turn. This is how they travel, working their way clockwise around Prince Samuel’s group, toward the wall.
“Thank you.”
Cas rolls his eyes but nevertheless switches out of his regular between takes bathrobe and into the silkier costume robe, the sort wrestlers wear. Except theirs have more of a jersey aesthetic to them with their surnames hyphenated above the symbol of their respective designations. Well, their acting surnames. As far as credits go, Hunter Ryder and Jimmy Angel are now the Angel-Ryder couple, and having it emblazoned on a pair of matching robes has Dean grinning his face off.
when he doesn’t earn an ass fucking,” Jimmy announces. He bares his teeth at Benny, vicious and absolutely sincere, before looking down at Dean. “Do better or I’ll choke you with it too.”
Still, knowing better than to pile back on the tension before a shoot, Dean drops the subject and acts like he accepts the non-answer. He checks himself over a little more, but really, he’s good to go. Alphas don’t take much prepping, even a cockslut alpha. As long as he passably smells like an omega, albeit one who was 3D-printed, he’s ready.
The picture of solemnity, Castiel nods. “I’ll leave you to it, then.”
“I’m very picky about porn,” Castiel warns. “When I was younger, I could settle for any pizza man spanking a babysitter, but I’ve gotten… niche. Would be the best term.”
Rolling his eyes, Cas steps in close, but his eyebrows rise as he touches the damp bundle. “That must have been a good dream,” Cas muses in his deep rumble.
“When I say.” He squeezes Castiel’s hands before releasing them, before tapping Castiel beneath the chin.
“Not what I meant,” Dean says, because if Cas is going to stab him, Dean’s going to stab back.
“I’m fine,” Dean says, still rather red in the face. He switches the stress ball to his other hand without being told.
“Please hear me out.”
“Hands behind your back, Dean,” Castiel commands.
Face still a bit flushed but at least not visibly sweating, Dean looks up at him, chewing on his bottom lip.
Dragged lower and folded backward, Dean can only stare up at Castiel, looking up and up until his throat becomes a straight line down, a straight passage down that Castiel fills inch by suffocating inch. Panic fires in Dean’s brain, not for air or safety or logic, but the terrified sensation of his lips stretched too far, his teeth too much bared. Castiel won’t like it, it won’t be good, Castiel will get his cock all the way down Dean’s throat only to decide it’s not worth the bother.
Castiel smiles hugely.
Castiel steps forward, grasps Dean by the hair on the crown of his head, and drags Dean’s face against his own crotch.
By the look on his face, it’s clear Cas doesn’t.
“He’s the reason Dean doesn’t receive scenting tours anymore,” Prince Samuel says.
Cas nods, very seriously, almost solemnly. “Yes. But I’ve realized that what I want and what I’d get would be very different. I know my own desires better than that now.”
Finally, unable to take more than ten minutes of this agony, he double checks the date with his knowledge of Cas’ schedule. Cas isn’t working right now. Maybe having takeout right now, or taking the bus home right now, but by all rights, Cas should be able to respond.
Castiel smiles and waves back.
Castiel’s body insists it’s in the same state, but his heart refuses. Whatever it takes to defend Hunter, Castiel must do.
Castiel breaks the silence first.
“Yes,” Castiel answers, lighting up. “Though he’s primarily interested in Megalodons at the moment.”
the spooky month,” Castiel says.
“That depends entirely on my priorities,” Castiel often reminds him in return.
It takes Dean a solid five seconds of staring to connect Benny with his stage name. “What about him? He’s a good friend, he’s a good lay, now we just won’t hang out at work.”
“Yes,” Cas says, face still against Dean’s shoulder. He holds on, leans on Dean, as if Dean’s the only thing keeping him up.
“What if you did the blue cheese burger and ordered a side of onion rings?”
“I was stunned by a head wound, Your Majesty,” Castiel replies, eyes lowered. He shows her the helm, and the dent.
Dean’s posture closes off further. Arms crossed, Dean shrugs without looking at Castiel. “Guy comes in every other week to get tubes stuck in him for a couple hours, for no reason. Y’know. Weird.”
“I didn’t tell you to finish me off,” Castiel chides. He grips Dean by the hair at the top of his head, and pulls until Dean has to relinquish his oral conquest. Castiel makes sure Dean is looking back up at him before he says, “When I decide to come in you, I will tell you. Do you understand, boy?”
“I don’t know what the item is,” Cas answers without hesitation. “Your reward. If I don’t like it, that’s akin to punishing you, and I don’t want to do that.”
“Bedtime,” Castiel tells him, their mutual regret clear on his face.
They are bound together against Hunter’s line through self-interest, not loyalty. They must be.
” Dean yells at him, the safeword coming out of nowhere, and Benny backs the hell off in an instant.
Getting back on that stool, Dean takes a moment to scan for Sam and then to curse his progress.
“Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, and Metallica,” Castiel recites, having seen Dean in band t-shirts for all three, “but sometimes your phone screen displays Taylor Swift songs.”
Castiel sucks in a hard breath. Exhales slow through his nose. Risks a look at Dean. “I love you like this.”
“I love you,” Cas grumbles in lieu of thanks. “Did you put sugar in?”
“And I wanted this on a Friday,” Dean continues. “So we could fuck all weekend if we wanna.”
Dean laughs and nods. “Yeah, I gotta eat a meal with some meat in it and hydrate.”
A loud laugh, hard and good and grinning when Hunter slaps his hand on Castiel’s good shoulder. “Cas, you are… I don’t even know what you are.”
Dean’s stomach turns over in a way that has nothing to do with sub par nachos. “Uh. Thanks.”
“I’m confused,” Castiel states, because at least one of them should be speaking in a straightforward, easily understood manner.
They kick off their pants, and the slick spilling out of Jimmy could overpower all the blockers in the world. The scent slams through Dean’s head, his lungs, his gut, it suffuses his bloodstream, it’s everywhere and everything. The aroma coats his nose, his open mouth, his cock. God, but it coats his cock, squishing and easy as Dean pushes into that slippery hole.
“Am I moving too fast?” Castiel checks. “We’ve known each other for a year and seen each other roughly twenty times. I feel like we’re past the usual ‘getting to know you’ small talk.”
“Ninety-eight point four, you’re fine.” Thermometer cover discarded and the rest put away, Castiel picks up his stethoscope. “I’m going to take your pulse now.”
“So fucking hot, you’re so fucking hot, never fucking knew you could be like this,” Dean praises, his mind editing out the cameras, the onlookers, everything but Jimmy under him. Jimmy moaning and pleasured, Jimmy
Dean kisses his nape. “‘Course I’m right. You’re too much of a cuddle bug to get bored and wander off.”
And again.
Fighting the impulse to cover his mate with his entire body, Dean instead pulls back, demonstrating for the camera how the tug of his knot makes the tight rim of Cas’ hole bulge. All Dean has to do each time is tug and not fall out.
“Yeah, I kinda figured,” Dean admits.
It is
Dean has an idea.
“No. Because then we would have been dating for half a decade.”
“You said the suspect had trained himself for lucid dreaming, correct?”
It’s all distracting enough that once again, Dean’s wandered back down the pet aisle out of sheer habit. He does stop himself mid-reach for the cat biscuits at least.
Dean shifts under him.
“Uh-huh,” Dean mumbles quietly, once again sporting that tinge of embarrassment. Castiel immediately empathizes. Human contact is often unnecessarily difficult.
At that, both Balthazar and Hannah emerge from the crowd. Hannah falls into step behind Castiel, but Balthazar grins himself forward, his arm slinging companionably around Castiel’s shoulders. The chain mail protecting his underarm scrapes against the back of Castiel’s helmet. Castiel responds with an arm around Balthazar’s waist, primarily to check that Balthazar also brought water.
“Yes you are,” Castiel replies, the unspoken
Lying half atop Dean, propped on the elbow of the same arm he’s using to slowly suffocate Dean, Castiel reaches down with his free hand. A muffled noise filters through Castiel’s fingers as Dean tries to shout, as Castiel works him through the trench coat. The air Dean loses, he can’t replace.
The holidays both drag and race by. Castiel performs basic present shopping with Jack advising him as to what Kelly would like. He also asks Jack what’s popular among second graders this year as they and Kelly go shopping a second time for gifts to donate. They’re no longer certain which one of them came up with the idea of teaching Jack about the proper spirit of giving, but for the past three years or so, Jack’s been enthusiastically gift shopping for his imaginary friend—who happens to be a different, real child each Christmas.
Dean jolts at the touch over his hole, at the tease of it when Dean knows what’s actually coming next. With a tiny, pleased hum, Castiel slides his hand down Dean’s ass and
After an unnerving pause, Dean splays his fingers. Castiel slips his fingers in between, and Dean closes his hand, Castiel’s fingertips pulled tight against his palm.
The man tilts his head, eyes narrowing in confusion. “But you bought the most cat treats last month.”
They talk for a long time. Way longer than intended. As in, way longer than a guy with poultry should spend yammering in a parking lot, kind of long. Dean tries to get the guy—Castiel, he says his name is—to go back in and return the cat food, but Cas refuses. He has a few regulars he’ll need to drop off food for later in the week anyway.
Dean doesn’t stir.
“Another time?”
“Starting.”
, Castiel nearly lies on instinct. Old reflexes die hard, especially when they may yet have cause to live.
And that’s how it’s supposed to end.
as to whether he’s taken illicit drugs, slept with men, or engaged in sex work since filling out his RapidPass.
As they step outside, Castiel lowers his head to prevent the sunlight from blinding him. The sound hits first, the clamor of a filled arena. Dust rises up to their ankles, the dry packed dirt of their battlefield stirred up by every entrant ahead of them.
Castiel nods once more. “I like you very much,” he says, because that seems like a good thing to say.
“No, sex.”
“Are you feeling all right?” Castiel checks. He approaches and Dean stands stiff, holding himself in place while Castiel grips his shoulder through his jacket. Dean’s certainly cold and tired. A headache as well, growing from the lack of food and the withdrawal from—mercifully—caffeine. Castiel soothes it all, and Dean’s face goes temporarily slack at the rush of heat returning into his body.
Hannah forms a wall at his back, sharpening his focus ahead. Castiel hears the shouted directions of which way they are to move, which alphas they are to strike down. When Hannah shouts, Castiel turns, and Balthazar becomes the wall.
Dean inwardly winces. “It’s not something I’m hiding, you know that, right?”
Straining for more than air, Dean opens his mouth wide. Reaches with his tongue, the only part of him he can move, and tastes the blue-white blast waiting to consume him. Consciousness slides and sidles away, but still Dean kisses him. Can’t stop. Hurts too much to keep going, hurts too much to pull back.
Rubbing at one eye, Dean says, “Dessert?”
Castiel smiles.
In the non-whisper of a child, Jack confides into Castiel’s ear, “See? Even
“...What are you doing?” Cas asks.
And finally looks at Cas.
“Hold this please.”
As the melee approaches, so too does Castiel’s thirty-fourth birthday. It comes and goes upon the training ground, the culmination of another year spent in sweat and the rejoicing scream of his muscles transcending his body.
Cas fucking loses it.
A faint smile takes over Castiel’s lips, small but deeply felt. “If it helps, I don’t take many vacations.”
The laughing stops. Dean’s shoulders relax.
“Of course,” Castiel says, and it hurts to know that the tightness in his throat isn’t from the dust. “I hope he deserves you.”
, all Dean’s, wanting and eager and-
Dean stands close, his legs framing Castiel’s knees. He takes Castiel’s hand for him. Brings that touch around to grab his ass, to grab it hard. Again, the mesh itches in that faint, new clothes way, but with Castiel staring up at him, the itch bothers far less.
Dean holds the gauze in place. “Sure. But like. The last time someone tried asking you out at work, how’d you feel about that?”
Sam sighs and equivocates. They hang up without Sam ever agreeing that this has to stop.
Castiel looks up from his laptop.
Against the odds, he finds one.
“Well fuck,” Dean says.
He can’t.
“Cas…” Dean scrapes his teeth over Castiel’s shoulder. “Buddy, please.”
Nodding, Dean takes his time. Arranges the pillows and gets himself comfortable against the headboard, reclined just right.
Dean leans back, eyebrows rising. “Jeez, way to sugarcoat it.”
The day moves on regardless, and it’s once again the on-week for Dean coming in. Every other week all through the summer, Dean has come in like clockwork, sometimes offering small updates on his grandfather, sometimes avoiding the subject entirely. By this point, Meg has renounced all responsibility for handling Dean’s donations on the flimsy excuse of
“Name changes can happen,” Castiel answers simply. Looking at Dean again—same flushed face, body tensed with a chilly undercurrent—Castiel adds, “How is your grandfather doing?”
“Not sure whose heart you’d break more by losing, yours or his,” Balthazar says beneath his breath.
planning it,” Cas says.
Dean swallows hard before Cas even passes him his drink.
“The omega was young, with parents yet to allow courtship or claiming,” Castiel continues. “Regardless, I have never seen nor smelled another to sway me away. I swore to wait. I am still waiting.”
“Dean Winchester, January twenty-fourth,” Dean answers with a sigh.
Thank fuck.
Castiel stares down while the crowd screams daggers into his ears. Unable to face the arena, his eyes seek out Jack in the stands and find the boy standing in his chair, shouting his lungs out, arms waving in frantic delight.
“Are you all right?” Cas asks, doing a lot of person-watching.
Bitterness pushes Dean through the dishes and into the fridge in general. What he sees basically confirms what the peanut butter and jelly clinging to the knives had attested, and this is why Dean is boiling pasta and melting cheese when Cas staggers back downstairs.
Prince Samuel looks at him sharply. “Not the time, Cas.”
“Yeah,” Dean says with a sigh. Then: “Next week, same idea, different place?”
He wonders about what Dean would be like after, the best part. Would Dean be a sprawler, his body a weighted blanket across Castiel’s? A cuddler, wrapped around Castiel from the back, or pulling at Castiel’s arm to drape Castiel around himself instead? Would he be too ticklish for Castiel to stroke his sides and touch all those mundane yet intimate places that boyfriends, not friends, are allowed to touch? Would Dean be comfortable enough in his own skin to allow naked cuddling, that unadulterated closeness? Would Dean let himself be held that way without demanding more?
. “No, no run up.”
“Wait, no, come back, I’m bored!” Dean whines as Castiel departs, absolutely playing it up.
-Dean can also appreciate a chilled band of silver against his ass, Castiel gripping Dean’s left ass cheek, spreading him only to play with yet more ice.
“I can’t decide whether to pull the plug on you or something. Seriously, man, that was the one good thing about my dad going so fast: never had to make that call.”
“I can pick you up? After? Pretend I’m a Lyft or something and drive you back to yours?”
Rolling his eyes, Castiel complies.
Castiel doesn’t argue, but he does look at the issue of staring from yet another angle. “Five more minutes,” he repeats instead.
He does it looking at Dean, too. Just standing there,
And god, every step feels like subterfuge.
Castiel doesn’t melt his car. He simply lies down beside it with a comfortable gap between his arm and the doors. Again, he sinks, this time even more rapidly. He thrusts an arm into the snow beneath the car, centered between the tires, but there’s reasonably little. Job done, he lies there a moment longer, letting his body cool down, listening to Dean puff with the weight of the shovel.
She nods and crosses her fingers against her chest.
“Awesome.”
an awesome big brother. So when Sam falls head over heels for whatsherface at the animal shelter while adopting a dog, Dean heaves a sigh, cracks open his wallet, and forks over the cash. Sam pays him back, more or less, but Dean’s the one who lives closest to the shelter and his grocery store is the one with the vet-approved treats.
Castiel rolls his eyes to the dark sky above, to the black clouds tinted grey by the motel’s yellow exterior lighting. “Give me your hands.”
Above him, having done nothing more than loosened his belt and unzipped his fly, Castiel fucks him to pieces, fully clothed.
And Dean can’t say any of that, because what kind of asshole gets that petty over a battered dead woman? The kind of asshole Cas would be
Then comes the formal announcement.
“Don’t we all,” Castiel says dryly. Meg is a bisexual, but the same theory applies. “All right, ready to be hooked up?”
One hour five minutes.
“You’re excited,” Castiel replies, halfway to a question.
Cas is a quiet man, quieter without shoes, so Dean doesn’t jump when Cas presses against his back with only a breath of warning. “Is it cowboy boots?”
“You don’t have to do anything. I’m only talking about options.” With that, she passes Castiel the pillow he’d used and picks up a throw pillow for herself. “Ready to wake up Jack?”
“Sam asked me to check on you when it was ‘all clear’,” Cas explains, doing the quotations one-handed. With a small grin and the tiny conspiratorial lean he thinks is casual, Cas adds, “He said you were having a sex dream and he didn’t want to risk seeing it. We waited in the car. Sam doesn’t usually play music that loudly.”
It matches.
Hands pulling on the back of Dean’s jacket, Castiel kisses him first.
“I don’t want this to sound bad,” Cas says.
Dean turns around slowly, making himself laugh at the absurdity of this little strip tease, but Castiel, he ain’t laughing. As Dean grins, Castiel stares up at him in awe.
Cheek bulging, Castiel stares back at him like an unpleasantly surprised chipmunk. After thirty seconds of painstaking mouth movements, Castiel swallows. “Because you said the marriage vow words?”
And Cas looks at him. Really
“Whatever group needs to fall back, falls back,” Jake Talley tells her, as if this ought to be obvious.
“The entire time I’ve known you, yes.”
She hands him a clipboard.
Not all the way. Not ready to come.
Grumbling, Castiel digs up the remote from between the two of them and starts scrolling. Finally, he says, “
Castiel gestures for Dean to come see.
“Got it.” Dean untangles a pair of earbuds from his pocket and gets himself ready. “Okay. Ready.”
“His father refuses to have the omega mate until his younger alpha heir is mated,” King Michael says, nodding to himself.
Cas rolls his eyes heavenward before doing his pitiful best to get the kid to stop.
Uncaring of Dean’s weight or their respective sizes, Castiel hoists Dean up in his arms, a mortified bundle wrapped in a trench coat. Without looking, Dean knows where they’re going. When he’s set down, he’d know this memory foam mattress anywhere, even a spell-summoned replica.
“Uh,” Dean says, inscrutable gears turning behind his eyes. “But if it
“Yeah?” He gets this stupid little grin. “Awesome.”
Castiel freezes at a speed that has nothing to do with temperature.
“But that’s enough for some,” Castiel finishes for him.
“Uh… Let’s see…” Noises of movement are followed by that of cabinets opening and closing. “If you can get a rotisserie chicken on the way over, I can make cornbread and mashed potatoes.”
Again, Castiel grinds the bones of both Dean’s wrists. Dean’s dick throbs with the hurt. His mouth falls open with it.
Dean scuffed his boot on the bunker floor a few times, looking indecisive. Finally, he nodded. “Yeah, let’s try it.”
Dean pecked a tiny kiss on Castiel’s cheek before heading quickly for the door. “C’mon,” he said, motioning with his head as he held out his hand. “Let’s go home, buddy.”
“Son of a bitch,” Dean said from the backseat, loud enough for Sam to hear. His brother only chuckled in response, and continued to gossip with his wife about Cas via his hands, not
Dean snuggled back, blissful for the moment. "You don't hafta like 'em just cuz I do," Dean told the angel before nuzzling into his neck. "And Harrison Ford is sexy no matter what you think," he said, voice muffled by Cas' shoulder.
“As fun as it is to watch my older brother flirt like an idiot, the car is waiting outside,” Sam interrupted, sounding impatient.
Cas put both his hands on Dean’s shoulders, an easy trick since he was so much taller now. “I would never call you weak, Dean, because you have never been weak. You just need… a little more assistance than usual right now,” Castiel said softly, using a tone that Dean had never heard him use before.  “I promise to keep Dean safe,” Cas called back to Sam, squeezing Dean’s shoulders in an attempt to soothe the hunter again.
“Role-play might have to be over for the night,” Dean said slowly.
“Really?” Sam asked, while Cas just smiled at him.
“Yes, Dean,” Cas said, slowing down in the digging ever so slightly. “Tonight, if you’d like.”
Castiel laughed, and Dean wasn’t sure if it was at him or at the situation in general. “Dean, you may be an expert in lying and fooling people on the job, but your crush on me was never a secret. Sam picked up on it first, of course, and then Bobby. It took me a while to sort out my feelings, since I’ve never felt anything like this before, but I eventually knew as well.”
Oh, well...
“Sam, you said that something was…” The angel trailed off when he saw Dean. “Dean, you’re… what kind of curse did this?”
“Because I love you, dumb ass,” Dean said, before gasping in shock at what he’d just said. But before Castiel could figure out a response, or really even think, Dean pulled him closer. “Because I love you, Cas,” he said, as if it were a revelation. His face mirrored that revelation, and practically glowed with happiness. “I don’t want you to die cuz I love you, damn it.”
Sam’s giggles got slightly louder, though he still hadn’t turned around to actually watch the insanity that was
Cas let out a soft, amused snort. “You have no idea what eternity actually feels like, Dean.”
"Don't you fucking dare diss Harrison Ford's acting," Dean threatened. "He is an amazing actor."
“Oooh, revenge planning, I’m awesome at revenge planning,” Charlie added in, startling both men since they hadn’t even heard the door slam that always announced her entrance. “Who are we revenging?”
“And there’s even food, Dean,” Cas pointed out. Dean would have made a bitchy comment about food not being the only thing he cared about, but when the smell of cooking burgers and hot dogs hit his nose, he completely forgot to feel insulted.
Dean shrugged and smiled even bigger. “Not really that hard to learn, if you’re not an idiot,” Dean replied with an eye roll, then covered his mouth immediately. “Shit, I’m probably not supposed to call the other models idiots, am I?”
Much to the omega’s surprise, Dean laughed. “Sorry, but that just hit me funny. No, their dad’s still alive, unfortunately,” he explained. “Total…” He glanced quickly at Emma, then at Claire, then spelled out, “a-s-s-h-o-l-e,” just in case. “We mated right out of high school, which I really don’t recommend, and it turned out Michael wasn’t exactly the family kinda guy, you know?”
Sam snerked loudly, causing Dean to roll his eyes at his immature baby brother. “But you gotta stay close to me,” he said, already blushing in embarrassment.
Pushing his now properly undressed fiance over to the bed, Dean lightly shoved Cas onto the mattress and growled his primal triumph. “And now,” he promised silkily, “I’m gonna destroy you.”
He’d hung out with his best friend Benny for a bit, but that hadn’t really been thrilling because they’d just hung out two weeks ago when Dean threw a barbecue for his family and friends, and the Cajun teddy bear and his wife had traveled all twenty minutes to get there. Seeing his ex, Lisa, had been nice, especially since he’d also got to learn everything there was to know about her awesome son, Ben. It had been an amicable break up, so there hadn’t been any awkwardness, but still, there were only so many cell phone pictures of a kid that a single guy could look at before they all blended together in his memory. He’d said hi to a few other people he remembered, polite chit about about basic topics, but those never really lasted for more than a minute or so.
"It's just," Sam said, at a loss for words. "You're kind of…"
Cas was always leaning in closer to Dean, but this spell was taking it to a ridiculous extreme (but at least it ended well).
Cas nodded. “I thought maybe we could get some coffee sometime?”
Mind you, a big chunk of the perfection came, not from being in Heaven itself, but from the company. He patted the empty half of the bed when Cas came into the bedroom they shared.
“Lookin’ good, Cas,” Dean called down, using his flirtiest voice. Maybe this would keep him entertained.
The reality of the situation only hit about an hour after they started researching. “Fuck,” Dean muttered under his breath. “Cas, I hate to say this, but I gotta go to the bathroom.” Dean grimaced, trying to show his friend that he had really tried to avoid this.
“You just seem so… I mean, you don’t… err…” Castiel sputtered, apparently trying his hardest to get his metaphorical foot as far into his mouth as possible right now.
Castiel turned his head to answer Dean, and only noticed then just how close he’d gotten when he helped unwrap the present. His face was close enough that Castiel could see the tiny golden flecks in his green eyes. He had to stifle a gasp at how truly beautiful those eyes were. It had been so long since he’d seen them up close…
“You should’ve let me toss his invitation to the party in the fire, like I suggested,” Dean pointed out. “Repeatedly.”
"Fuck your damn buttons," Dean grumbled as he finally just yanked the shirt apart, sliding the ruined fabric off Cas and throwing it in the general direction of not them. They struggled out of their pants before dropping loudly onto the mattress. Dean, now on the bottom on the pile, ran his nails sharply down Cas' back, loving every fucking second of that surprised gasp, even after all this time. Cas retaliated by biting at Dean's already abused lower lip, eliciting his own revenge gasp.
All remain still.
(See the end of the chapter for
,” Dean whines. “Bragging rights. And it’s not like it’ll hurt our odds of more mated work.” Now that the initial buzz of them mating has worn off, so has that boost of attention. Everybody in their corner of the porn industry had wanted to know how the hell an alpha best known for getting railed by other alphas had landed the omega with a poker face so infamously unbreakable, he’d become a niche kink all his own. Hopefully, a win here will switch both of them out of the roles they’ve been literally pegged into for years.
Uncomfortably, Castiel shrugs. “I didn’t want to mislead you into thinking I was
It’s a shame. Sam would have loved to see Dean fall.
But undeniably hard.
Beside Castiel, Kelly hugs her purse, buries her face in it, and starts laughing.
For some nonsensical reason, Dean looks at his watch. Not a smart watch. Not a watch with the day of the week on it, let alone the month and year. But Dean looks at it, sees absolutely nothing, and says, “We’ve only known each other twelve years.”
“Wow. You’re really hot.” Dean steps back in the slush, some of the heat flush fading from his face. “I mean. Body-wise. I mean. You just, uh. Keep doing that.”
“But we haven’t been,” Castiel replies.
Dean is not, never has been, and never will be a cat person.
Dean nods along, mainly focused on getting out his headphones and music.
Normally, Dean would reject that out of hand, but Sam’s been harping on about this for ages. “Okay, deal. What’s the bet? Pool?”
As if Hunter had been the one waiting for that promise, Hunter goes hard on Castiel’s left, striking Castiel's shield down harder with each blow until the pain of raising it rivals the pain of being struck. Blow after blow from the side, hacking into his shield, then
Dean does check his phone, though. Checks the time, the address, and predicted driving time.
Castiel returns to find Dean twisted over and humping the bed. Castiel stops short but says nothing. He approaches, sets both glasses down on his beside table, and stands there, looking down at Dean with dark, hooded eyes. He has the sex towel draped over one arm.
But he does. He does look, and he sees Jimmy’s pointed look toward the cameras, and Dean, well, Dean’s lust drunk on his mate—his fucking
“That was the issue?”
“No,” Cas interrupts quickly, both hands raised to pacify. “You
complaining to him.
“What are you going to do?”
Except Jimmy pulls his hand free and slaps Dean again. “You’re still servicing
Except sometimes.
Castiel answers slowly, “I believe I am here because Your Majesty already knows.”
Dean stares at him.
Dean’s stuck in boxers under pajama pants, the pull-string double-knotted, but the firm ass against him is entirely, infuriatingly naked.
“I am,” Jake replies, his stern brows supported by the thick foundation of his nose. “And to you, stranger, I would be ‘Captain Talley’.”
Weirdly, it does.
On shaking legs, Castiel stands up for a few seconds, but only to wipe his hands and refold the sex towel. He tells Dean to stretch his back and counts aloud, directing him. With the towel back on his chair, Castiel sits, spreads his legs, and gestures Dean back into position. He doesn’t give Dean his foot to rut against again. Instead, he reads news articles aloud on his laptop while petting Dean’s hair, absolutely ignoring Dean’s needy erection.
Cas presses a scratchy kiss to Dean’s nape, and Dean’s shoulders shoot up, hunching at the stubble. Dean elbows back at him, only for Cas to respond by grinding his cheek against Dean’s skin.
“Can we just, Jesus.” Dean stares around the living room that passes for his mancave. “Fuck, man.”
With shallow, nudging thrusts, Castiel works himself deeper, deeper, too deep. Dream again presses up against reality in a terrifying friction of the impossible.
“Yeah, okay,” Dean says with a much put-upon sigh.
Dean hits the overhead light while Cas clicks on his bedside lamp. Dean does the same on his side. Their elbows brush as Cas scrolls through his tablet and Dean thumbs through his paperback. Before Dean can even find his place, Cas puts the tablet aside and drops his head onto Dean’s shoulder.
