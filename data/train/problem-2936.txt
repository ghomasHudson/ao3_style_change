Eventually enough time had passed where everyone but Cas was getting hungry for something more substantial that snacks
“You don’t need to apologise for anything Dean. I’m content in my decisions.” Cas looked uncomfortable as he stared at Dean.
Dean was dazed as he pulled back slowly opening his eyes. Though he was quickly startled back to reality when he saw only confusion in Cas eyes. Cas may have kissed him back but it was obvious it was just to help Dean.
It was just a gentle brush of the lips at first before Dean deppened it slightly. If he was going to prove a point to John he was going to go all out.
Because even though Cas had been in the bunker full time lately he had still spent every day in his suit and tie no matter how many times, Dean, Sam, Jack or even Mary tried to convince him to dress more comfy.
Sam then took over telling them how they thought Jack would be a baby but they found him as a teenager.  Dean and Sam spoke about the different reactions they had with Jack.
Because it wasn’t fair, it wasn’t fucking fair. If that was how he went out. He was pissed just thinking of it. Again he was Dean Fucking Winchester, he deserved better.  Jack may have been taking a hands-off approach as God.
Cas didn’t think it was weird, it wasn’t like it was completely out of the ordinary. Cas was more likely to relax properly when they watched movies in Dean’s room anyway. Because Dean refused to allow Cas to get on his bed in his full get up shoes and all. It didn’t hurt Cas to put on some comfier clothes occasionally and just vegout. So really it was for Cas benefit.
“But since your sacrifice Cas, I’ve had no choice but to think and process. I’ll be truthful I may not be 100 percent comfortable with it, or understand what it means for me. I thought I had more time to process, more times to come to terms. But I promised myself the first time I saw you I would tell you. I love you too Cas, I’m in love with you.”  As hard as with was for Dean to say, he also felt a weight lift off him as he admitted it out loud for the first time.
Dean knew Cas didn’t need sleep, but that he could put himself in such a deep meditation that it was like sleep, which was obvious what he had done. Dean should have gotten up. He felt incredibly well rested, and really should hop up and leave before Cas ‘woke up’ so things weren’t awkward.
The more monsters he defeated, the more impossible situations he got out of, literally coming back from the dead multiple times.
“So, boys, you’ve been pretty tight lipped about things so I’m looking forward to you finally telling me what’s been happening for the last decade” John started
It was with the determination to prove John wrong that Dean brought his head up to Cas cheek and slowly leaned in.
In John’s opinion he was the monster, yet to him John was the monster.  Because anyone who treated their children the way John does is a monster. Claire and Jack may not be his children but he thought of them both that way especially Jack. And there is nothing they could do that would make him stop loving them.
Even though it had been a pretty simple hunt , Dean’s body had gotten used to getting a decent amount of sleep. So Dean blamed that for why he found himself falling asleep during the movie. It was a movie he had seen countless times, so it wasn’t like he actively had to pay attention to follow along. And his mattress was just so comfy it was calling to him to just sink in and sleep. Plus the warmth of Cas against his side was no help and it was barely a third of they way into the movie when he started to doze off sliding down the mattress and turning onto his side. Seeking more of the warmth from Cas.
This is the only chapter where we really deal with recapping the past but it is relevant for the main part of the story. So even if you just skim please read the next chapter
“It’s this binge culture we live in one second Cas and I are just watching one episode of Brooklyn NineNine the next second we’ve watched half a season.”
“I want to turn the bunker into a proper hunter  headquarters?” Sam blurted out.  It took Dean a second to process exactly what Sam meant because that had not been what Dean was expecting him to say.
It wasn’t perfect, it wasn’t the ending he would have picked for himself. Yet isn’t how he always said he wanted to go out. Saving People Hunting Things.  Sure he may have thought it would be a bit more heroic. But free will,  no one in control this was the way it was meant to happen with no one writing his story obviously.
But the truth was I was scared. I’m Dean fricking Winchester and I’m scared of feelings surprise surprise there.
While they still had the network of hunters coming and going. Without John there Dean got to actually enjoy being in his home.  The other seemed to feel the same way.
“Well I’m in, and I’m sure Cas will be to.” It would give Cas even more of a reason and purpose to stay at the bunker. And anything that gave Cas a purpose and kept him around was a win in Dean’s book.
That the bunker wasn’t a headquarters for everyone. If that was they was it was going to continue to be, maybe it would be worth looking into moving into town.
“Cas is right Dad it's not black and white and to think you are disappointed in Dean and I just for those we keep as friends or acquaintances. We didn’t even mention when we were telling you about our past about the insignificant cases. The once off ones that were just so routine there was no real point mentioning them.  Besides of course the monster we let live that is.” Dad was fully glaring at Sam as he spoke, and it took everything in Dean to not get up and knock that glare off his face.
Sam had people who had his back. Bobby and Rowena and Mom may judge Sam when they found out the truth about everything but Dean knew they would understand in the end. They had all made tough choices in their life and respected or loved Sam for who he was now. Sam had people in his corner besides Dean.
“Plus that was long enough ago that it makes sense that you are thinking of getting engaged. You are lucky I’m around Dean. I seem to be the only one who has actually got the brains to pull this off.” Rowena gloated, honestly she knew the boys were all emotionally stunted but it wasn’t that hard to work out when the story should reasonably start. Even though she would never admit it out loud, she was honestly shocked that they hadn’t gotten together then.
Dean understood why Sam was okay with it all. Rowena and him had that weird kinship, he had formed a close relationship with Bobby and Mom while they had been trying to save Dean from Michael. Plus most importantly he wanted to prove to Dad that he had been wrong about him.
What Cas truly wanted was to finally be able to spend time on earth with Dean, Sam and Jack, without the constant worry of what was happening in heaven nagging him in the back of his mind.
Before John could when really process what Dean was saying, he had stood up grabbing Cas arm as he went to drag him along so they could disappear again.
“You deserve to be happy Dean, it’s all I ever wanted for my children  so I’m glad you have the time now to just be happy. I’m also glad that it wasn’t because you didn’t feel like you could trust me. Because your my son Dean and I’ll always love you no matter what. I’m incredibly sorry about your father, I’ll try to talk to him and make him see reason. We may have become friends of some sort but he isn’t the John I knew before or after the Cupid’s interference. So I don’t know how much luck I’ll have but I promise I’ll try.” With that Mary stood up and came around the bed to give Dean a kiss on the cheek before leaving him to think about what just happened.
I would like to think he would be proud of me and Sammy. But I know he probably wouldn’t if he found out everything we had done, monsters we had left alive. If he knew the partnerships we had formed over the years.
“Yeah.” Dean answered sitting up stretching and rubbing the sleep out of his eye.  Mary made her way in and sat down on the edge of the bed handing Dean a coffee which he took gratefully.
It was completely platonic and innocent. So Dean found It hilarious that when John walked in he immediately started grumbling and gave Dean his patented you’ve screwed up and I’m incredibly disappointed in you glare.
He wasn’t prepared to see how people treated him when they were assuming something completely different.
The simple salt and burn was just what Dean needed, it was simple muscle memory, they could have done it in their sleep. It was just what he needed to get rid of pent up energy.
Dean led them through the bunker to the one place he knew they wouldn’t be interrupted, his mancave. Sam had no interest in it and Dean had purposefully not shown it to anyone else beside Sam and Cas.
Dean may have not had the best “healthy coping mechanisms.” Emotionally stunted was a favourite phrase of Sams.
For starters, there was the whole situation with Mary and John.  2018 Mary and John were practically entirely different people to the two young, Cupid-struck, completely in love pair they had been the last time they had been on Earth together. So, it was putting it lightly to say they had some reconnecting to do. It was made even harder to navigate, because it wasn’t like there were self help books, or couples therapy you could go to that deal with, Cupid’s meddling, death, and resurrection. So it had been a bumpy start reintroducing them to each other. Luckily even without a Cupid interfering they had changed enough, in their time alive without each other, that they were actually getting somewhat along, not madly in love or anything, but forming a mutual respect kind of friendship. For Dean and Sam it was just an incredibly weird situation that neither really wanted to get involved with.
They started with how they dealt with the death of John, and how that led them to continuing the hunt for yellow eyes, what Azazel goal was and the demon deal Dean ended up making to save Sam.   Dean was at least able to look into his father's eyes when he spoke about finally killing Azazel with the final bullet from the colt. Looking away when he had to admit wasn’t  time to stop hundreds of demons escaping from the gate that had been opened.
“Of course not, but no one said you had to fake date Cas, no one said you have to kiss him. Those ideas were all yours Dean, ever think why that’s where your brain keeps going?:” Teased Sam.
Deans hand on Cas arm when they were talking. Dean figured part of it was, still being worried that Cas would leave and by always touching Cas he could remind himself that he was still there. That Dean would willingly admit out loud if asked.
They explained meeting Rowena and Sam spoke about the ‘alliance’ he made with her to try and cure Dean from the mark of Cain getting Crowley and Charlie to help as well.
Are the two of you understanding what I'm saying here do you understand how if you were actually honest with each other so much would be different.
Soon It was time for Crowley to start making appearances in the story and  that was when Rowena really started to pay attention as they spoke about their first real meeting with Crowley when he was just King of the crossroads before he was the King of Hell.
“Oh no no no boys you can’t just act the same, John may think you said it just to make him angry and you don’t want him to suspect anything do you?” Pointed out Rowena and of course that was her only reasoning for pointing it out. She certainly wasn’t hoping this would cause the two idiots to admit their feelings. Because it’s not like they had driven her crazy with their denial over the years.
But Cas, Cas not only didn’t seem to mind, he welcomed it he never seemed put out by Dean and his neediness.
As soon as Dean was talking about hunts, weapons, monsters he was fine. He was in his element and confident Dean came through. It was just when he was having to sit back  and watch it was awkward.
Cas couldn’t help but stare at Dean as he spoke, he was confused because Dean wasn’t lying he truly did look relaxed and like he was in a good mood. Even with how their morning had started. Maybe he was choosing to just ignore John like Sam had suggested.
Once Sam had gotten the green light from Dean on the headquarter plans, he had gotten Rowena to fill Cas in and get his go ahead. So as soon as they got back to the bunker Sam shut himself away with half a dozen notebooks saying he wanted to finish working everything out so they could get it up and running. All this organising and notes were right up Sam’s lane and Dean was perfectly happy to leave him to it himself.
As long as the Angel, the Nephiliam and the Witch left the bunker, Dean could spin it however he wanted. Then John would have both his son’s back, Mary would stop bothering him about being accepting and they would be able to finally be the family they have never gotten to be. Approaching Dean in front  of others had proven to be useless, so his new plan was to approach Dean when he was alone.
So he was completely truthful about how he stopped his heart to try and deal with the ghosts and honestly didn’t care enough about whether he came back or not. How luckily timing worked and it was that evening he got the call from Cas. Dean honestly didn’t even care how he had been resurrected. He was just glad to have him back.  Dean could tell by the look on Sam’s face he hadn’t quite realised how badly Dean was coping and the lengths he had been prepared to go to.
The biggest positive though was Cas was here. After the Empty took him, Dean thought he would never see Cas again. But now he could he would get to spend eternity with Cas. there was nothing to come between and pull them apart. They had a lot to talk about and it was the first thing Dean needed to do in Heaven.
And I was over it I was over our family being at the centre of everything and always making sacrifices.
They were hunters but they didn’t care that he was with Cas. They didn’t treat him any differently than they treated Sam. It was a weird relief to find out that people still treated him like the badass he was even if they thought he was sleeping with a guy.
So I wanted to make him angry and think I had actually done that as well. Sure I could have used Anna if I was determined it had to be an Angel, or even a couple of other ‘monsters’ but I knew he would be most angry if I was currently in a relationship with them plus you know how he feels about ‘fags’ as he would call them so Cas made the most sense.” Dean explained to Sam without getting into the real emotional reasons behind his choices.
He wouldn’t care that we considered Cas family. I could just see him using that as another excuse for him having to go family was our biggest weakness and it was clear that Cas was a weakness of mine.
It was a weird dynamic between them  but it worked and Dean wasn’t going to judge, and besides the odd thought it wasn’t something Dean spent a lot of time wondering about.
Jack had locked himself in his room on a massive Netflix binge and requested he not be disturbed. A quick text to Jody assured them that locking themselves away and spending the whole time on their laptops was common teenage behaviour.
John had given them a couple of days to just enjoy being back before he demanded they sit down  together and the boys catch him up on everything.  After all, the only big bad John had been aware of was yellow eyes. Lucifer, Lilith, Angels, Apocalypses and everything else was hard for him to get a handle on without the stories. He wanted more than the snippets he was hearing in passing from different people. He wanted to hear it straight from the source.
Even though Dean still didn’t want to please his father, it was starting to get to him with how disappointed he was in him.  He may be trying to change, but there was still a part of Dean that was a little boy and that was the part struggling.
But growing up as hunters and living the life they had for the last thirteen years, neither Dean or Sam had been able to relax and just enjoy life. This wasn’t how life worked for a Winchester, you didn’t defeat the big bad and suddenly have everything be okay. There was always something around the corner to look out for.
Maybe if he really thought about it would admit that he could see some sort of attraction between each other. But lately he was noticing it seems deeper than that.
Which hurt Dean, how many times had Sam made fun of them for always staring at each other and it hadn’t been uncomfortable in years. Yet now it was more uncomfortable than ever.
Dean couldn’t hide his smile when Cas said he planned to stay at the bunker for a while if that was okay. Dean made sure Cas understood just how okay it was.
Dean was lounging on his bed flicking through the tv channels, while Sam was hunched over a book, with a notebook next to him making notes. And looking up at Dean every few  moments before shaking his head and going back to his writing.  Dean was trying to be patient, but it had been going on for almost half an hour and it was slowly driving him insane.
It was one of the first smiles on Deans face since they had started this whole thing when he got to speak about Cas entrance in the barn and how badass it was.
“The Angel and the Nephilim nice to meet you both.” John may have said it was nice to meet them and shook both their hands but the tone of his voice said otherwise and had Dean on edge.
I wasn't stupid though I knew a big part of my issue of all our issues me, Sam, Cas even Mom was communication. I hated ”chick flick moments” Dad raised me to believe they weren't necessary.
Over the rest of the time they covered Sam returning from hell and them realising he was soulless. Sam working with Samuel Campbell yes Mom your father. How Crowley had them hunting Alpha monsters as in the very first of the monsters.
John was on a much larger hunt with Bobby and Mary chasing down a vampire nest, which was the only reason Sam and Dean both felt comfortable leaving Cas, Rowena and Jack at the bunker.
”But why lie and say we are together. Why not tell the truth and tell him about the “Monsters” you have slept with?” Cas questioned confused, and bringing up a valid point. It wasn’t like Dean would have to lie, he had slept with ‘monsters’
Which at least that was one good thing about this already. Dean had been pretty certain if he ever said anything to Sam he wouldn’t care. But at least now he knew for certain that Sam wouldn’t care.
We are officially into the second half of my outline which is scary in away. Because when I originally planed this fic the whole thing was going to be 20,000 ish words and it's already almost up that point and I haven't finished writing it.
Cas followed and Dean quickly apologised for the kiss once they were alone. Cas told him not to worry that he  understood it was just Dean needing to prove a point to John.
“Remind me to never ask you to help me decorate a room Dean.” Rowena was appalled as she took in the room, though she didn’t know what else she could have expected from Dean.
Hunters from their own world that had heard of Dean and knew his reputation not just as a hunter but as a ladies man. None of them treated him any differently or seemed to be judging him behind his back.  It was just full on acceptance of his relationship with Cas.
And enough is enough there is a point were amusing turns into just plain old sad.  The point where there is no other ending than a tragedy.
The only person who Dean knew would be in his corner besides Sam was Cas. Cas, who would not be here while they were telling the stories of their past. Cas, who was finally having an opportunity to feel like he was redeeming himself. So, even though Dean knew that if he prayed to Cas, if he told Cas that he truly needed him here. Cas would be there for Dean without hesitation. He couldn’t do that, he couldn't take this opportunity away from his friend. He was just going to have to suck it up and deal with it. It couldn’t be any worse than the other stuff he had gone through in the last thirteen years.
It was why, even though Dean had missed Cas over this last month, he understood why Cas needed to be up in heaven that this was Cas way of redeeming himself. But the last time they had spoken a couple of days ago, Cas had let Dean know that it was all sorted for now, that he and Jack had done all they could up in Heaven at the moment and that they would be coming home to the bunker in the next couple of days.
Dean hoped Cas could read in his eyes that he was sorry for what he was about to do. Just as their lips touched Dean closed his eyes, not wanting to see the look on Cas's face.
Not to say he wouldn’t hunt occasionally he had been itching after all and that was why he came on the salt and burn. But he really had no desire to go on the more dangerous hunts not after all they had been through in their lives. If anyone deserved a break it was them.
Though both had made Mary promise to call if it looked like they were wrapping up and heading back earlier than expected.
Even as tense and pissed off as Dean was at John, he couldn’t help but smile and feel less stressed by Cas suggestion. Even if it was mostly said as a joke, the reminder that Cas would support Dean and have his back no matter what was just such a comforting thought and almost made dealing with John worth it.
Dean was kind of glad that Sam had brought the two of them with him, forget what Dad would do to them. Dean didn’t want to imagine what else they would have said to John.
Dean had had a lot of first kisses in his life, and so many more kisses than that overall.  He had had terrible kisses, he had amazing kisses, he had felt nothing, he had felt fireworks and passion. But never had he had a kiss that felt like this. It wasn’t full of passion and fireworks, it wasn’t terrible or nothing. It was natural, it was comfortable and it was like coming home.
Positive - When he was ready it seemed like he was going to be able to visit his family blood and found.
I was angry at Cas I was completely furious at what he did but I was angry at myself as well especially when we spoke to him about it after we got back from visiting Donatello when I asked him what gave him the right.
He may have betrayed you at points but that was because he was stupidly misguided. He thought he was doing what was right to save you to help you get out of hunting. To let you have a normal life. All he has ever wanted is for you to be happy.
Do you realise how much could have been solved if you had simply asked Cas to stay and told him he was important because of who he is and not as a weapon. Stressed that you needed him because of him and not to fight your battles
They spoke about their quest to open another riff into the apocalypse world and the steps they took, including Jack ending up getting stuck in the apocalypse world all by himself. Which is when Mary was able to explain what they got up to over there.
He could have easily continued to rant to Cas. It was almost too easy once he had gotten started. But he wasn’t that kind of person that was more Sam. So he made himself wrap it up.
“That you didn’t think you could trust me with this, I know it was rough at first as I transitioned to being alive and my babies being adults. That I wasn’t exactly here for you both and we had a hard time transitioning. I also  know the time I grew up in wasn’t exactly known for being accepting of gays. But I never really had an issue and since coming back I’ve realised that it really isn’t an issue at all. And I should have made that clear. Especially when I started to suspect there was something with you and Cas but there was never exactly the time to talk to you about it. I’ve let you down as your Mom so yes I’m sorry.”
Positive - Billie/Death isn’t trying to reverse everyone who is alive who shouldn’t be. His friends are safe. He did that. That was something he could be proud of, he had made sure Charlie, and Bobby and all the other Apocalypse people and anyone else who had been revived was safe
Though he certainly didn’t understand why Sam’s coping mechanism was to go for a ridiculously long run after they would finish talking for the day.
Sam must have sensed that a conflict was about to break out though and quickly asked Jack how it had gone in heaven. Jack was happy to fill Sam in on everything he had been up to. With John listening attentively and asking questions.
“About that the three of us have your back but how are you going to explain Mom not knowing she has been back for a couple of years.” Sam tried to be the voice of reason.
Dean and Cas shared a quick wondering if they should share why John was pissed already but decided to keep it themselves. “Well he can be pissed somewhere else. I had a great night's sleep, and am in too good of a mood to care about him today.” Dean Spoke.
How they found out Cas was still alive just without his memories. The alliance they ended up forming with Cas, Meg, Crowley, The Ghost of Bobby and Kevin.
Should he have clarified what Bobby meant about Cas? Is Cas free from the empty? Is he in heaven? Can Dean see him?
“I’m sorry if I’m not helping make up lies, I still don’t see why this is necessary and I don’t think it is a good idea, how is this going to end well.” Sam tried to be the voice of reason again.
Yet all he has ever done since he raised you from perdition, has been done to keep you safe or to keep you happy. I know he never told you that when Naomi was controlling him that he had to kill hundreds of you and I’m not exaggerating here Dean remember I've seen into both your memories.I'm only speaking the truth as you both think it. Naomi, she tortured and reprogrammed Castiel until he eventually gave in and was able to do it effortlessly kill each copy of you quicker and withstand whatever it said to him.
“Your right and really I should have expected it from you, you always did let me down. Dean on the other hand you always did what was right and beside for a weakness when it came to Sam, I could always trust you to make the right decisions. Yet apparently that was only when I was here to keep an eye on you. I'm still struggling to comprehend exactly how you are the boy I raised. The only thing I can say I’m proud of you about is not having a relationship with  a monster like Sam here.”
And he would soon, he was just going to lay here for a few more minutes soaking in what would probably never happen again.  It wasn’t like he wanted it to happen again exactly, at least not with Cas. But he was appreciating how warm and nice and safe, and ugh he wanted to throw up just thinking those words. Laying in Cas arm’s with his eyes closed it wasn’t surprising that he drifted back to sleep. Dean was sure it was still quite early anyway.
Really he had just kept putting it out of his mind besides thinking it was a weird dynamic they had and how close they had gotten. Dean was aware they had both bonded over shared trauma.
“Don’t worry dear even though we knew you were lying we had your back I told your father that you had even had me helping you look at engagement rings lately.” Dean spit out the beer he had just taken a sip out of at Rowena’s comment.
Cas was pissed off at John, the years of learning bits and pieces from the boys and other sources hadn't done John justice. That was saying something because Cas had already had a pretty shitty opinion on John yet somehow he was worse than he had ever imagined, which made Cas aware that there was so much Dean hadn’t shared about his childhood.
Dean knew his life was messed up, that he had been through some pretty messed up shit in his life, but he was a master at repressing. It wasn’t until he was laying everything out factually in order for John.  That it really struck him how messed up his life was, to even make it through one of these events was against all odds. Dean truly struggled to comprehend how he was even sitting here alive to tell this story.
”You have both made some truly terrible mistakes. Some of them I could forgive you for but what I can’t forgive you for is breaking the number one rule about hunting. I don’t know how many times I had ingrained it into your heads boys but obviously I didn't do a good enough job because the second I die you forgot it all. I couldn’t believe as you told me your story how you both broke it more times than I frankly wanted to count and you are still breaking it right now.” Here we go thought Dean. This was heading exactly where I was expecting.
If he wasn’t an Angel he would have blushed, luckily he was just slightly stunned he had forgotten he wasn’t wearing his suit, and before he could say anything Dean made it clear he had arrived and obviously heard Rowena’s comment. “ You can look if you want Red but you can’t touch, he's all mine.” Dean announced as he slid into his own seat after pulling it closer to Cas’s. One hand reaching out to pick up his coffee the other to lace with Cas own hand resting on the table.
Maybe he should have listened to Sam years ago. Listing all these positives in his mind was actually helping him slightly accept being in Heaven and being Dead.
Dean was pacing at this point in his rant. “I let him control my life and decisions, even for years after he passed. I understand he was as controlled by heaven as we were. And he may have tried the best he could but it wasn't good enough.” Dean had been dealt some pretty shitty cards himself and he had managed to make his own choices.
“Technically I think the term for Dean would be bisexual and while I have a male vessel I don’t necessarily consider myself male. And while I have only been with woman I couldn’t care less if they are male or female and I believe the term for that is pansexual. So the question you should ask Jack is if Sam has a problem with me being pansexual and Dean pretending to be bisexual.”  Cas explained as if it was no surprise that he was knowledgeable on different sexualities.
Ending with Dean finally saying yes to Michael. That was thankfully the last of it to catch Dad up to date as when he had been resurrected they had caught him up on how it had happened with the whole Michael thing.
And it got easier to just move past it to just ignore it, really what was the point telling him what losing him had done to me when he was back now.  Then to much time had past so it would have been awkward well more awkward then a chick flick conversation would have been anyway.
Mary’s conversation put Dean in a good mood to start his day. He got up and after getting ready went to start making  breakfast.
Because it was meant to just be beauce it had pissed John off. But one of the reasons Cas had held back from buying clothes of his own was that he liked to wear Dean’s for some reason that he didn’t understand he liked the fact that he knew the clothes he was wearing were Dean’s.
Bobby was gone, and it was different with Sam. Dean still felt like his protector he couldn’t let himself be completely vulnerable and reach out for the touch he needed when there was no crisis.
Dean had had his back to his father so he hadn’t  seen the look John had on his face as he watched  his son hug the unknown man a look that morphed into disgust at the length of the hug. By the time Dean had let go of the hug and turned around John was smiling at something Mary was saying.
Dean felt guilty and almost came clean then and there. John was the only parent that Dean was trying to prove a point to. He had no intention of causing Mary to feel so much guilt, when she really had no reason to feel it.
Life couldn’t stop just because John wanted to hear the story, so it was a couple of days before they were able to all meet back up in the map room.  Dean let Sam take over a lot of the explanation with Ruby and Lilith, jumping in only when needed, .
Even though nothing life threatening had been happening or anything along those lines like Dean normally reserved his hugs for. He had been through such an emotional turmoil having to relive his past and was so stressed about the judgment and the comments that were still to come. That Dean couldn’t help himself,  he needed the feeling that came with having Cas safe in his arms.
“Hey Cas, I don't know how it all works up here, but ah yeah I hope you have your ears on. I’m assuming you are up here. I hope you are up here. I think you are up here Bobby said you helped Jack turn Heaven into this. I guess Jack delivered with his paradise, you were right as usual after all. I’m up here in Heaven in case you haven’t figured that out. You are probably angry you sacrificed yourself for us and I followed you so quickly. Honestly, I want to ask Jack if it was some kind of fail safe plot from Chuck or even Billie.”  Even with the new self-awareness, he was developing. Speaking his emotions were still difficult. Especially with the unknown of if Cas could even hear him.
The only thing that stopped him admitting the truth was the less  people who knew the better. All he could do was try and reassure her that her guilt was completely misguided and she need not feel it.
“If you can hear me Cas, I’m sorry. I’m sorry for everything. I haven’t been able to stop thinking of everything you said. I’m sorry you felt like it was something you could never have. I’m sorry I just stood there as you spoke, I’m sorry you had to sacrifice yourself for me. I’m just sorry.” Dean held a sound he hadn’t heard in years sound of wings flapping.
The more acceptance he got the more he let himself just enjoy life.The more he was willing to help Sam with the hunters and hang out in the main parts of the bunker. He was able to be himself and not have to worry about keeping up the ladies man appearance that had been truthfully unfulfilling  these last few years.
He also figured it was his lack of sleep and not having any coffee yet that made him mishear Mary’s confession that she had suspected he was in a relationship with Cas. Because he had to have completely misheard her on that part. No focusing on making sure she didn't feel unjustly guilty was really the important part to focus on.
”I was angry, how can he say the only thing I've done right since he died is not sleep with a monster. I mean I know I've made mistakes but I've also saved the world shouldn't that count for something.”
I needed to man up I had been to hell and back and fricking survived I could survive this. That was what I kept telling myself as I walked down the hall to were I had last seen Cas.
Compared to everything else that had happened that day,the afternoon was just easy. They were all able to laugh and joke with each other. Dean felt slightly guilty when he realised he was wishing that they always had the whole bunker to themselves.
“I’ve thought of that and it would be me, you, Cas and Rowena. The four of us have no desire to go on complex hunts anymore. Combine that with the fact that of everyone we have the most experience it just makes the most sense.” Dean realised this was probably one of the things he had been discussing with Rowenna whenever they were hiding in the library together. It certainly seemed like Sam had put a lot of thought into it.
But Dean had spent his whole life projecting a certain image and having people assume what he wanted them to assume.
I wouldn’t consider myself weak and scared but dear Chuck I was honestly considering the easy route the route I choose every damn time I came to this crossroad in my life.  But then I wasn’t showing that I had grown up that I wasn’t that same dum twenty-something, that I didn’t let my father who had been dead for a decade still control my decisions.
He would have been so disappointed in us for even begrudgingly working with Crowley once. He wouldn’t have understood even though we didn’t trust him it was better the devil you know. Same with Rowena I hated bloody witches and I didn’t trust her for a second but at least we knew her and we knew she was going to backstab us more often then than not we could work with that.
And it was all looking pretty quiet on the big bad front. Meaning everyone was able to concentrate on the ‘normal’ monsters.
Dean could have asked Cas if he wanted to go and watch a movie with him in Dean’s mancave, nice big TV plenty of space on the couch. But he didn't, instead he asked if Cas wanted to come to his bedroom and watch something on the smaller tv in there.
“I don’t have to nothing Cas I want to. The whole point of defeating God was to have free will right. So that we got to live lives of our own choosing. Well, I want to be happy, I’m not happy I’m here but I’m taking it a fresh start. A chance to try and be the me I want to be. That me want’s to be truthful with myself. And that means admitting I’m in love with you. If I misread what you said, or you’ve changed your mind and realised I’m not who you thought now you’ve had time then I’ll understand but if you want me Cas I’m yours.” Dean was trying to convey his emotions as best as he could.  He was putting everything on the line hoping Cas was picking up what he was putting down. But would understand if he had changed his mind.
They had finally truly defeated Lucifer, and the new Michael.  In the end having Michael in their world for even a short time had actually worked out well for them. Michael had kidnapped Jack, from Lucifer and restored his power. As well as brought back countless Angels from the empty. Sure it was all for nefarious purposes to destroy the humans. But with so many hunters, and the Angels on their side  they were for once able to defeat the big bad before anything went wrong.
But here he could, there were monsters to fight. And while he wasn’t sure where Cas was he could find him. And Sam would join eventually. Plus it would be better than he ever imagined because Bobby could be there. Mom and Dad could be there. Here in heaven, it wasn’t just Sam, and Cas.
Dean admitted he was drowning in grief over Cas and couldn’t help but blame Jack fully. Deciding he had already admitted enough embarrassing, stupid choices and everything along those lines that one more wasn’t going to make a difference. He certainly couldn’t disappoint John anymore than he already had.
“As one of these so called monsters Mr Winchester let me assure you, your boys don’t hand out their trust lightly. I would say even now that the boys and I don’t exactly fully trust each other.  But I respect them and what they are striving to achieve and they respect me and I know without a doubt that if I was to betray them they wouldn’t hesitate to hunt me down and kill me.You obviously were just never likeable or important enough for people to want to put aside their differences to work with you for lack of better words the greater good.” Oh no one could deliver sass like Rowena. Even Mary looked impressed with her comments.
Especially if he had found out everything Cas had done ‘wrong’ over the years. He would use that as proof to have him gone. Even though Sam and I had screwed up just as much we were human he could forgive that.
Which was almost the same thing and yet not at all. The next screw up was when Cas started speaking about how he hadn’t repaid Jack and how he felt like he had failed him. When he decided he was probably brought back to help prepare for war.
Dean could see Dads eye twitch every time they mentioned Crowley or Cas. They spoke about what the start of the apocalypse really meant and what events they witnessed and had to try and stop.
“Think whatever you want Dad, obviously you aren’t going to just believe me but I’m not lying to you.” With that Dean stormed off out of the library to get a drink.
“I do need to apologise Cas. I need to apologies for being a coward. For years now deep deep down I had some understanding that how I saw you, what I felt for you wasn’t brotherly love, or even family love,  at least not in the way I loved Jack, Bobby, Mom, Charlie, Jody, and everyone. But it was easier for me to just say it was because you are my best friend. And there was always some major situation to deal with. So I never had to try and unpack it.” Dean was struggling to keep eye contact with Cas. He wanted to turn and look anywhere else. But Cas deserved Dean’s bravery Dean wanted to be the man Cas thought he was the man Cas deserved.
The other part, the part Dean wouldn’t admit out loud. Was that it was complete selfishness on his part. He would never admit it but he knew he was touch starved. John had never been one to hug Dean or even give him a friendly pat on the arm all that often.
“Sorry Dad it’s just we have some catching up to do with Jack and Cas as well.” Sam answered, trying to keep the peace. Which was weird for Dean to here, it had always been him trying to keep the peace between Sam and Dad.
Dean started it back at the beginning of the Season before taking Jack’s lead and relaxing back into the couch.
By the time they were both ready to come back to the group a day later, Dean was prepared and bought a bottle of whiskey to the table to cope even though he was only going to gloss briefly over Hell. Sam grabbed the bottle off of Deanto to get his own liquid courage when he had to explain Ruby and the demon blood.
Dean tensed as he slowly crept into awakeness after one of the best sleeps of his life, to the realisation that he was curled around a warm body. Which was a shocking realisation as it had been a long time since he had woken up to that feeling.
Now I think I should tell Castiel that when you say we needed you about Jack bringing him back really you meant YOU needed him. Jack didn’t really know what he was missing and he understood. Sam was dealing he mourned you Castiel don’t get me wrong. But he accepted you were gone and focused on Jack and getting Mary back.
If anyone had pressed Dean before to label what they were.He would have said best friends, just like with him and Cas..
I can't hold your hands though. I can't write your conversations for you. I could make it so you can read each other's minds. But I won't I'll save that for if I see you again and you still prove to me you haven't learned anything.  Take this wisdom on board realise what an opportunity I have given you to move forward and stop making the same mistakes. Take time to think things through individually and then have a conversation together give yourselves a chance at being happy.
Positive -  God wasn’t using humans as chess pieces, or trying to destroy their earth. If he couldn’t be proud of that what could he be proud of? Thanks to him and his family they had saved literally the whole world from the ultimate threat.
Dean pulled Baby over to the side of the road. He got out and sat on the hood, there was a lovely sunset happening that he could watch while he came up with a plan. He maybe should have asked Bobby how this whole Heaven thing works. He was pretty sure he didn’t have his cell phone on him, and even if he did, he doubted it would work here.
Sam and Dean were both hesitant about telling John everything as they knew he would struggle to understand parts of it. But surprisingly Saw was the first of the two to come around. He reasoned with Dean that if they were completely honest, it may be the only way for John to understand everything and it would be better to hear it straight from them and not second hand from others.
He couldn’t stress too much about it though. Not with Dean rubbing his thumb along the back of his hand.
Idiots who hide behind labels that don’t do you justice, brothers you certainly aren't that are you. Buddies, best friends, don’t cover it not even ‘profound bond’ like you say Castiel. No none of those quite sum up the two of you.
“If your father doesn’t realise what an amazing man you are Dean and respect you for the man you have become. That’s his problem and it will be him that will suffer without you in his life. Because you have proven time and time again that you don’t need him. In fact you have become a better man without him in your life.” Cas had reached out and rested his hand on Dean’s arm as he spoke. Causing Dean to look up at Cas  and look him in the eye. So that Cas could clearly get across to Dean that he truly meant every word he was saying. . Even after finishing what he was saying he maintained eye contact with Dean. With Dean being the first to break the eye contact what felt like minutes later.
John was never one to admit he was wrong, yet he was really struggling to process what he was seeing with his eyes,and how that fit with what he believed. Dean was just faking his realtionship to piss John off, no one knew John was coming to confront him this morning. So why was Dean in bed with the monster, why had they been curled around each other like lovers.
“ I knew that Dad would be most pissed off if I was currently sleeping with a monster. So that only left me three choices, Jack which just don't any! For one I see him as a son but even if I didn't he may look legal but he's like two and just no that's too gross to even think about. Then there's Rowena and that's just not believable in any way, Dad would more likely believe that it was Sam sleeping with her. So that only left you which made the most sense anyway, besides Sam you are the person who is closest to me we have that profound bond and all.” he briefly paused his rambling to catch Cas eyes at that statement sharing a small smile before continuing on.
I am also the Goddess of wisdom, courage, and inspiration. So I am going to give you two some much needed wisdom, miscommunication is the main evil in your life. You are probably wondering what I’m talking about how is miscommunication the main evil.
“Right and when did this whole thing happen?” Asked Sam who seemed to be determined to poke all the holes in Deans plan.
“Excuse me this room is a masterpiece.” Dean defended, turning around in his chair to see that Sam had brought Jack and Rowena with him. “Is there a reason why you are all here?”
Thankfully after a couple of days Bobby found a hunt and asked John to come along. Mary offered to tag along as well, telling Dean she hoped being away from the bunker would give her time to reason with John.
Dean never one to miss any opportunity no matter how small to embarrass Sam latched on though asking when she had made the decision, and why she had only told Sam making a joke about being chopped liver.
And I wasn't going to say anything we aren't meant to intervene with humans and angels but I couldn't help but be aware of you, everyone in our world knows of the human and his angel. I was already more aware than both of you having clearly seen both sides of the story but now that I've had access to your minds. Well, I can't not intervene what can I say I'm secretly a romantic.
“You take a minute to calm down, I’ll go make you a coffee, so you don’t accidentally scare anyone with how pissed off you are. .” Offered Cas, sliding out of bed and heading to the door. “I doubt John will be in a rush to come back and if he does, you’ve got good enough aim that you could just graze him with a bullet. I’m sure everyone would think it was justifiable.”
Why couldn’t he drive recklessly, he was already dead, though if he was being honest with himself he would have rather gone out crashing Baby. It would have been sad to wreck Baby. But would have been a better way to go and at least something he could admit to others.
So it wasn’t exactly hard to keep the lie up but it was weird. Dean hadn’t been prepared to have so many people think he was in a relationship with Cas.
“John we spoke about this there is nothing wrong with our Son for loving a wonderful man.” Mary came to Deans defence. Dean threw her a grateful smile.
“To bad Dean we need to talk, man on man, or are you not man enough to have a one on one with your own Father these days.”
It gave them the chance for Cas to really explain in detail everything that had happened in Heaven.  As well as for them to both talk about what their current plans were. Because for the first time they were able to actually think and plan what they wanted to do. Not have it be predetermined by whatever the current crisis was.
As much as Sam was important to him and vice versa even Dean could admit they were better and healthier versions of themselves when they had other people to rely on.
“You boys can’t sit there though and tell me conspiring with those monsters hasn’t bit you both in the arse. I'm sorry did I mishear the part where you became addicted to Demon blood and were sleeping with a Demon Sam.” Dean felt sorry for Sam because he knew how much he regretted Ruby and everything he had done since to make up for it.
Which meant by the time John came back Dean was not only even more certain that he had made the right decision standing up to him. But being able to spend so much time with Cas without a crisis made Dean value his friendship even more, Somehow they had gotten even closer. They had always gravitated towards each other, Cas had never had a concept of personal space. But now they were never in the same room without touching of some sort, legs pushed against each other when sitting on the couch, arms against each other when standing.
For a long con the better you know your vic the better you can pull it off. That was what Dad had always taught, and I knew Dad better than anyone, so it was going to be an easy con to pull off.
Dean had never been one good for reflection and processing. He was always looking for the next hunt the next problem to solve. But he was in heaven and there were no monsters to fight. No problems no nothing.
As soon as the words were out of Dean’ mouth he had gone into flight mode. He had to get out of there before he said anything else stupid. Maybe if he had seen the look on his father's face that morning he wouldn’t have said what he had.  But then again maybe it wouldn’t have made a difference at all.
It was meant to be a quick and easy case few days tops in and out no pressure. But of course, Winchester luck meant that the complete opposite was bound to happen. The quick and easy case turned into a run in with Athena the Goddess of wisdom, that’s  right a Goddess. She didn’t even have anything to do with our case she just happened to be in the same town apparently and somehow Cas and I had pissed her off, and now she had kidnapped us and we were stuck with a Goddess  monologuing at us.
Dean also came to realise that he had underestimated saying him and Cas were a couple not affecting everything in his life . But he was too stubborn to back down. He was just going to have to deal with all the consequences and Cas was a saint for putting up with him.
“ Yes well no not exactly but kind of. Really just doing what we are doing now with it as a home base but more officially. Really training and growing the network so that everyone has support, proper training and access to the right information. Making hunting safer for everyone.” Sam tried to explain, he had been thinking about this for a while and he knew it was the way to go. It had already been working so well they way they had been doing it with them just making it up as they went.
“See I think you are projecting you want me to be in love with Rowena so that you feel better about whatever is going on between you and Cas. Want to talk about that kiss in the Library the other day?” Sam questioned putting it back on Dean.
Cas obviously needed the hug too because he relaxed straight into Dean's arms hugging him back just as tightly. The fact that Cas was hugging just as tightly meant Dean was in no rush to let go, letting it last for a couple of seconds longer than was really necessary before he pulled back and gave Jack a one arm hug slap on the back  before leading them both over to the table and telling them to help themselves.
And with that she was gone, the bonds holding Cas and I in place were released and we were free to go. Though for once I would rather be still tied up then free to go and have to decide what to do with everything she just revealed.
Who were able to bring a more human, team working,dealing with failure, kind of life experience to the table.
Dean couldn’t help himself from commenting after all that “If you think all that is truly unbelievable and a lot for three humans and an Angel and a Demon to go through.I  don’t want to burst your bubbles but this is really just the beginning it get’s a lot more unbelievable from here.”
Dean wondered when they were going to admit they had a thing for each other. It may not be incredibly obvious for others, and it had all only really clicked for Dean a couple of days ago.
Even as early it was there were always people up now days working around the bunker, and especially in the kitchen. Which was good in meant there was always coffee brewed so it didn’t take long at all to make it to Dean’s taste.
Dean took a deep breath  before starting to tell their story, picking up from the hospital after they realised what John had done to save Dean.
Though Dean did enjoy the look on Bobby and Dads face when they mentioned that prophet Chuck  they had mentioned way back was actually God and Amara was God's sister, and how that all went down. How Amara thanked Dean by resurrecting Mary. It was one of those moments where they actually got enjoyment from sharing their past.
Dean almost wished they had a camera set up in here because he would love to see John's face when he realised what Dean was about to do.
He may have put on a brave face for Sammy when he was dying. But now he was by himself Dean was allowed to be pissed off.
And he had liked sleeping next to Dean even before John had come in, he had ‘woken’ up earlier and realised he had never felt so comfortable or safe in a weird way. It was so confusing and he didn’t know what to think or even really who to ask to talk to about as it didn’t seem like something he could go to Dean for.
Nope both Dean and Sam had agreed Mary and John were grown adults and they could deal with it themselves.
That was the big part of why he was okay with not hunting, he wasn’t feeling the call, before he had always felt like if he didn’t hunt and someone got killed that was on him. But now because they had a proper network now they had other people who were able to tackle the hunts.
“If you say you’ve thought it through then okay I’ve got your back just let me know what you want me to say and not to say.” Agreed Sam.
The salt and burn went off perfectly and they stuck  around another half a day to make sure everything was good before they headed back to the bunker.
John had had enough of putting up with Dean. He was sick of the charade. He didn’t understand exactly why Dean was so pissed off with him but enough was enough. He knew his son better than anyone, he knew he just needed to get Dean one on one and remind him of the importance of family.
Over the next few days as they were all able to meet they told the part of the story of the lead up to Lucifer rising. Dean took over the parts that really related to Cas, Anna and the other Angels while Sam spoke about Ruby, their relationship and his struggle with his addiction of Demon blood. Dean could tell Sam was really struggling to get through something that really neither of them had spoken about for years. It had been a chapter of their lives that they had closed and moved on from.
Dean’s gut was telling him that this instance was no different. Causing him to still be slightly on edge. It didn’t feel like it was going to something major going wrong. But he just couldn’t shake the feeling that everything had worked out too perfectly. There was going to be at least one more challenge or issue to sort through.
“Ignore him I think he woke up on the wrong side of the bed he was already angry before you two even came in.” said Sam.
“Why do I feel like this could easily be us walking into an intervention?” Dean  joked to Cas under his breath trying to lighten the mood.
Dean was confused that Cas seemed genuinely unfazed by the kiss. But assured Cas he was fine, it wasn’t like that was the worst thing John had ever said to him after all.
“Don’t tempt me. But it’s probably better to just get it over with.” Years of dealing with his father told Dean that it was worse in the long run if he tried to delay it.
So he was happy to follow Deans lead and go back to their Brooklyn NineNine marathon. At least that was what Dean had wanted to do.
Dean blamed the fact that he was already on edge, that he was angry at his father, that he had so many years of pent up feelings towards John for the words that came out of his mouth next.
To no surprise Sam, Mom, Dad, Jack, Bobby and Rowena were all already sitting and waiting when they finally joined the group.
Standing up to Dad was the one thing Dean had never had the courage to do while John had been alive.
Of course, I didn’t realise this until later and at least this time it wasn’t months later it was just hours. But it still wasn’t soon enough no we had to deal with Donatello and Cas going crazy Cas on him.
I will give you Castiel you are not quite as terrible as our Dean here but still pitiful attempts by you both.
Just focusing on the rest of the morning, which meant Dean didn’t mind that Cas had decided to rest last night, or that he had forgotten he was wearing his clothes. But did he not mind because he just did not mind, or because it had pissed John off.
Or Cas if you had been honest when you wanted to stay. Simply told Dean you didn’t want to leave him that you had to but you would much rather stay with him.
”It was a quick decision I didn't really have time to process or think.” The words were coming out of his mouth before he even realised what he was saying, it was almost on instinct.
Which did make Dean pause for a second when exactly should this fake relationship have started. It had to be before Mom got resurrected but not too early that it just didn’t make sense with what had happened.
Dean hadn't actually realised how long they had gone without hunting until John had realised it, which had shocked him. Not that Sam hadn’t wanted to go, he had managed to give up hunting in the past. But that he was able to pass it up.That he didn't feel he hadn’t felt like he needed to be out there protecting innocent lives.
That was when I should have realised that he didn’t get it and I really needed to tell him that he didn’t come back to prepare for war. Jack brought him back because I needed him. But did I say that no I mean I hesitated and considered it for a second before I opened up my stupid mouth and said ‘well then we do what we do whatever it takes’
Always trying to brush it off as a we feeling instead of an I or making it about the ‘cause’ you amuse me. You never learn you make the same mistakes over and over again, like little children.
“Everyone is in agreement then, would you three like to stay and watch Brooklyn NineNine I don’t mind going back to the start of the season do you Dean?” Asked Cas.
“I assume your girlfriend is on board.” Dean wouldn’t be Dean without comments like that Sam had to have known it was coming.
Positive - It may not have much to do with him, more Sam, but at least he knew Hell was under control with Rowena and that Demons weren’t terrorizing Earth.
“Hello, Dean.” Greeted Cas he had settled on the bonnet next to Dean, in his typical suit and trench coat.
John was barley back a day when everything changed again because even if things were better lately. Dean was still a Winchester and their lives could never be smooth sailing. John came and confronted Dean in the library. Interrupting the research  session Sam, Rowena, Cas and Dean had been engrossed in. Well Sam, Rowena and Cas had been engrossed, Dean was slightly bored. Mary and Bobby wandering  into the library slightly after John. “‘Look son this ruse has gone on long enough, you may have everyone fooled but you aren’t a fag, just admit you aren’t sleeping with that Angel and we can move on. I know you are just doing it for attention.” John demanded.
So Dean was expected to share his past, the reasoning behind the decisions he made, his feelings and fears. The type of stuff he absolutely hated sharing with his own brother or Cas. Yet here he  was being expected to share it all with his brother who at least knew most of it. His mother who knew the overall gist. Bobby but not their Bobby, and Rowena who had only recently gotten on their side.
Dean was shocked how long they were able to hide away.  They managed to make it through half of the new season of Brooklyn NineNine before Dean's phone started to ring.
Dean slowly opened his eyes and was shocked to realise it was Cas’s body he was wrapped around. In his half asleep state not even clicking that he had been in bed watching movies with Cas the night before. Sometime throughout the night though Cas had moved from sitting against the headboard to laying down on the bed and while Dean was asleep he had rolled closer so that he was curled around Cas. Cas had moved as well and had his hand fisted in the back of Dean’s t shirt. Pining Dean in position against his body.
Dean wanted the conversation to happen between just the four of them - Sam, Dad, Mom and himself. But Sam reasoned that apocalypse Bobby had been wanting to know what had been going on to understand the difference between their world and his and as the unofficial leader of the apocalypse people he deserved to know. Rowena also managed to somehow convince Sam with that weird bond they had (that Dean really had to start teasing Sam about.) That she should be allowed to join because she wanted to hear stories about her Fergus and he was bound to be in them.
”Yeah but don't worry we aren't going to have to do anything different than we do now. As far as Dad knows what we have been like, is what we are like together.” It would be one of the easiest cons he  had ever pulled. Dad would be proud of it too, if he wasn’t the mark,  I would be using one of his lessons to pull it off after all.
Dean really hoped John had headed to the kitchen, because it would be so worth whatever teasing Sam and Rowena came up with when they found out,  for John to see Cas walk through the bunker in a pair of Dean’s sweats, an old shirt of Dean and barefoot.
“Isn’t pansexual and bisexual the same thing then?” Asked Jack confused you were either male or female right and you could only like males or females Jack thought. Dean was happy Jack had voiced his confusion, cause he at least didn’t sound dumb asking it. He could get away with questions like that only being a couple of years old.
Dean was going to have to show some faith and hope prayer worked up here and Cas had his ears on. Otherwise, he would retrace his route and get back to Bobby. But he would rather solve the problem himself first. So prayer it was.
If Jack had fixed Heaven as Bobby had said, it sounded like it was going to be a happy place to relax.
It wasn’t that he had thought himself immortal. He understood he would die, but he had gotten cocky over the years.
“Some of your Netflix shows have new episodes do you want to watch anything?” Dean asked trying to change the topic to an easier conversation.
”Which means it's going to lead to a confrontation and he's finally going to have to realise I'm me. I'm my own person! Not a carbon copy perfect little soldier like he wants. He needs to accept me for me or we will have to go from there. Because I'm not changing Cas I can't go back I have been through way too much to go back to letting my father control me.” Dean didn't know how many times he has said the phrase I can't go back in the last few minutes. But really that was the phrase that been running through his mind since John was brought back
And not just in the tactical meetings, it was  when they saw Dean around the bunker they were nothing but nice. They would come and ask him for advice and talk.
Now this wasn’t to say Dean wasn’t happy-ish for the most part to have his father back, he did love him after all and finally after all these years he had his mother, his father and his brother all together, happy and healthy under one roof. It was the dream, literally something Dean had dreamed about countless times in his life. Everyone was alive, everyone was safe and for the moment there was no massive crisis on the horizon.
That has to be it. He had been knocked out and sucked dry from a Vamp. and while he was losing all his blood he was delusional and dreamed a sucky ending for himself.
Especially not something so trivial like who they decided to date. He was happy to do whatever Dean needed him to, to continue to piss John off it was quite satisfying.
Windows down, trees blurring as he sped past, classic rock music blaring. He was coming to terms slowly but surely. Really he had no choice but to come to terms. But he was slowly being able to work it out in his own mind.
Yet it was certainly easier than the hard option. The one were I go and find Cas right now and be honest with him. Sit down and for the first time in ten years say exactly what I mean to him let everything out and see where that leads. It would be hard and awkward and yet maybe if we were honest with each other and then were honest with Sam and everyone was on the same page for once maybe just maybe we would all make it out of this without screwing up completely without us having to sacrifice ourselves.
“You can’t hold some dumb decision I made over ten years ago over my head dad. It was stupid and dumb of me and I have spent a long time trying to making up for it. But it is something I have been able to move and forgive myself for. I literally was tortured by the devil because of it, I’ve had to help save the world several times. Judge me all you want Dad I honestly don’t care.” This was by far not the first time Sam had stood up to their father but every time he did, Dean was amazed he had the courage to.
“Thanks Mom.” Mary let Dean enjoy his coffee and wake up slowly, which Dean was grateful for because he was going to need the caffeine to hit,  before what was bound to be an uncomfortable conversation started.
The three were just staring at each other as they all took in what was happening and Dean and Cas decided to lower their weapons.
“Dean I meant every word. Trust me when I say I know you better than Sam, I’ve seen your memories, I’ve seen your soul, I rebuilt you. I know every mistake you’ve made and all the good. I love you and I will always love you.”  Cas looked so earnest, Dean could think of nothing to say in return.
“I see no reason I wouldn’t be Dean assures me that really we won’t have to act any different to normal as John wouldn’t know any better so I am happy to help Dean.” Casa was quite aware of only some of the horrible things John had put Dean through and yet that was enough to make Cas hate him.
What was so special about that day? Why a month after he was brought back, why not the day he returned? or the week after? Why a month. Well, it was the first time since John had been brought back that Cas was able to make an appearance in the bunker.
”And you know I thought I had finally dealt with my issues surrounding Mom and Dad, after Mom came back. I had outgrown the silly boy who just wanted to impress his father. I won't let myself fall back in that hole Cas, I can’t let myself become my fathers perfect soldier again.” He had come too far and learned too much to revert back to that person.
They get to tell Dad about exactly why his father disappeared and how it came to them being here in the bunker and mentioned meeting Abaddon for the first time. Meeting Metatron and how Metatron led Cas to believe that he would help him close the gates to Heaven.
Of course the fact that neither Dean or Sam had gone on a hunt since John had come back, had been just another reason for John to insult his boys. He had tried to force/guilt them into joining him with the vampire nest. But they would rather he think less of them, than be forced to spend any extra time with him.
“It's hard though man when he was yelling I just wanted to apologise and do whatever it took to make him proud. But I can't I can't fall back on that, so I guess in my mind that meant going to the other extreme where there will be no way of me giving in. There is no way he's going to let this slide, he's going to be even more pissed off at me then he was earlier.”  It wouldn't surprise Dean if it ends up in a physical fight between them.
Dean made a demand of his own though. No one was allowed to ask questions or make any comments about anything Sam or him said till after they had told all of their story The only way Dean was going to be able to get through this was if he didn’t have to deal with judgement until after.Plus he doubted they would ever get through it all if they had to stop every other sentence to answer questions.
“I wanted to talk to you and I wasn’t exactly keen to leave Rowena and Jack with Dad, who is still ranting to Mom and Bobby about your little bombshell you dropped by the way.” Sam answered explaining he had brought the other two into the room, closing the door properly at least behind giving them all privacy from the other occupants of the bunker.
Figuring Dean had already dealt with enough, Cas slid into the seat across from John and placed Dean’s coffee in front  of the other seat greeting everyone.
But Dean suddenly was incredibly busy and had an almost endless amount of excuses to not spend time with John. It may not have been obvious to others but Sam knew his brother and it was obvious to him, that for some reason Dean wasn’t happy Dad was back.
Cas decided not to push and let Dean show him what shows had new episodes and picked something for them to watch.
Luckily  all that really meant was just admitting they were a couple when someone asked. Dean was happy that at least the  ‘If we just say we were always together we won’t have to act any different plan’ was working.
Dean was startled awake by the noise of his door banging and years of training had him instinctively rolling over and grabbing his gun from his bedside table, sitting up and aiming it, before he had even really woken up or realised what was going on. Cas had immediately sat up drawing his angel bland so both hunter and Angel were ready before their brains realised there was no threat and it was just John. Yet neither made a move to lower their weapons.
Dean stood up so he was eye level with Sam who was leaning against the wall. “Look Sammy I get it, okay this doesn’t make sense to you at all. But believe me this may have been slightly rash but I have spent the last month trying to think of a way to make it clear to Dad that he can’t control me anymore. Maybe it will destroy our relationship, but I honestly don’t care. And it’s not like it’s going to ruin mine and Cas friendship with everything it has already survived. I just need to know you three all have my back.”
I could admit at least to myself that the last thirteen years since I picked Sam up from college to look for Dad had changed me.
He had been trying to be more than his anger. It had been something he had been trying to work on and he wasn’t going to let his anger beat him now.
But you telling him that after everything he did for the earth, all the sacrifices he had made. It ends like this.  No that wasn’t fair. He hadn’t lost everything given everything to go out like this.  He had been cruising in baby, but as he felt his anger rise he pushed his foot to the floor.
You think you both would have learned that keeping things from each other leads to disaster but no you are both idiots.
“She’s not my girlfriend Dean, she is just a friend, I mean a good friend, but we have been through so much to not be friends but that doesn’t mean we are dating. But yes Rowena is on board.”   Dean had to try really hard to not laugh at Sam, the poor boy had it bad for her. He had to know how in denial he sounded with that little speech.
“Easy when she asks I'll just explain we haven’t exactly had a moment without a massive problem until now and I didn’t exactly think it was a big deal and as I didn’t know how she would take it, I was just waiting until we had a moment to actually have a conversation about it.” Dean reasoned back
Dean you think that Castiel cares more about the mission and the cause, more about Jack and redeeming himself than he cares about you.
Which was why John had gotten up early this morning and was making his way through the bunker to Dean’s room.
Cas got up to leave when he noticed Dean falling asleep. But Dean reached out wrapping his arm around Cas wrist and asking him to stay. In Dean’s tired state he really had just meant till the end of the move. There was no need for Cas to miss out on the rest of it just because Dean was falling asleep. But there may have also been the fact that he didn’t want Cas to go, he was comfy and warm. Two words he would never admit out loud.
Dean was fully committed to this plan and he was going to see it through, Sam needed to understand that.
And while I was angry that Cas was going crazy Cas I understood were he was coming from we had all done crazy things for those we love. Not that I had ever told Cas I loved him back. Again no chick flick moments for me.
“Dean Winchester and Castiel. Following your story has been an interest of mine for years. It hasn’t been hard you two are a popular topic for those in the know after all. People often mistake that I’m just the Goddess of Wisdom and War but really that breaks down so much more.
From there Mary was able to help then explain everything that went on with the Men of Letters and Lucifer vessel hopping.
A fucking nail. That was how he died. He was Dean Fucking Winchester and at the end of the day, it wasn’t Death, or Lucifer, or God himself that killed him. It wasn’t even the blood-sucking vampires he had been fighting really. It was a stupid nail in a beam that was sticking out.
It was no surprise as he went to take the coffee to one of the tables that Rowena and Sam were at a table, both early risers.  Mary was also there drinking her own coffee and to Cas’s dismary they were joined by John.  There were only two spare seats one unfortunately across from John and the other next to Mary.
Dean really struggled to talk about Cas death with Mary noticing and quickly jumping back into the conversation,  talking about dragging Lucifer into the apocalypse world.
When they eventually got to Amara, Dean tried to get through that in as few days as possible and happily letting Sam and Rowena tell their parts when possible. Except for Cas letting Lucifer take control,  Dean made sure to tell that part so he could explain Cas's reasoning and defend him.
Luckily for every insult John gave, Mary, Sam, Cas and Jack seemed to be making it their mission to give him a compliment in return.
“It is, it’s really good too you’ll enjoy it Jack. Just remember if you have any questions about anything as you watch write it down as you go and Dean and I'll answer them for you.” Sam answered.
Then Sam tried to ever so casually like it was no big deal slip into conversation that, Rowena had permanently moved into the bunker. It had been during a conversation about one of the hunts they had hunters on, he just casually tried to slip it, before attempting to distract Dean with the way the hunters had killed a vamps nest.
Dean got it,  but he loved seeing Cas dressed down, and while he had started dressing down and borrowing Dean’s clothes in private this was the first time he had left the safety of Dean’s room or the mancave. He figured Cas didn’t even realise he wasn’t wearing his suit, but hopefully it would be another step towards Cas feeling more at home, and not wanting to leave.
Once they had settled on the couch, Dean started the conversation. “You look good Cas you look happy and more relaxed than I think I’ve ever seen you.”
“I’m proud of you boys for killing the yellow eyed demon. But that’s about all I can say I’m proud of you for. I honestly feel like I don’t recognise either of you. Neither of you have turned out to be how I wanted you to when I raised you.” John paused to take a breath. Both  Dean and Sam kept their mouths shut, they could tell he was nowhere near finished lecturing them though. He had obviously been preparing this the whole time they had been telling their story.
Just Sam trying to make sure his big brother wasn’t making a stupid mistake. But Dean had thought about this, what he said may have been spur of the moment. But he knew he was prepared to deal with whatever the outcome was.
Tears brimmed in Dean’s eyes, he had already been slightly overwhelmed, and seeing Cas in the flesh something he had never thought would be possible anytime soon. Seeing him there healthy and with his wings was more than he could handle. He reached out and pulled Cas to him in an awkward hug.
Dean was driving down a long open road. Seeing Baby in Heaven was the first thing that felt okay since he realised he was dying.
Over the next three and a bit weeks, with  Sam and Dean taking turns and multiple breaks, they managed to explain it all.
Rowena and Sam were a perfect pair. They both loved knowledge, they both felt more in control with the more knowledge they had. So it was no surprise they were often hauled up together in the library.
I would love to know what you guys are thinking so far? Do you think Cas is in denial as much as Dean? Who do you think is going to break first?
Cas had been busy helping to sort out heaven for the last month and while he had had some contact with Dean, he hadn’t been able to get away until now. Cas had wanted to make sure that he was able to help get heaven fixed and on track enough that he wouldn’t constantly be expected to go back.
“Mom there are only two reasons you didn’t know. One like you said there hasn’t exactly been a moment to really sit down and talk about it. But the main reason was simply It was never a thing that needed to be said. Cas and I, are just Cas and I, it’s not like we are a typical couple. We aren’t even in the same state the majority of the time. This is the first time since we started  we have ever been able to be together without something major looming over us. “ Dean tried to be as honest as possible, in the hopes to appease Mary’s guilt.
“Obviously I haven’t because you still haven’t gotten it.” Dean had gotten out of his seat when John had entered. But Cas will still sitting, that is until Dean grabbed his arm and pulled him up until they were face to face.
I thought that would be comforting and helpful but of course, as everything else, it came back to bite me in the arse.
”Plus I know you are a celestial wavelength and all, so you don't have a gender but your vessel is male and Dad hates Gays almost as much as “Monsters” so it means I'm going to be a double disappointment in his eyes.” As Dean was explaining his reasoning he realised that it was kind of convoluted and may be crazy but he was sticking to it. After years of not rebelling or sticking up for himself, he was finally doing it and he was going all out.
Sam had even admitted late one night when they were both drunk, that he had told Rowena things that he had never said out loud before when Dean had questioned why he was so trusting over her now.
Now I had the easy option were I just let him go on his soldier warpath and it probably wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing there was no place for feeling in war but it would most certainly end with either him Sam or me making some stupid decision or sacrifice because that was exactly what always happened every damn freaking time.
Or ignore everything I have said choose not to listen to me choose to keep going on as you have been with miscommunication being your biggest evil and continue on the path to a tragic ending.
In Winchester timing it was the morning after they had finished explaining the last of their past that Cas and Jack finally arrived home. As soon as they walked into the kitchen where everyone was having breakfast. Dean found himself standing up and pulling Cas into a bone tight hug.
Cas brushed  it off like it was nothing. Like he was fine with the impromptu kiss. The only thing about it that concerned him was if Dean was okay with what John had said.
But of course not talking about it was biting me in the arse now. I had tried to mention it in some way earlier to have at least some sort of conversation asking how he was holding up with everything.
“So Rowena tried to explain to me why you said what you said and how it was a perfect plan but I really don’t get it why would you want Dad to be angry at you Dean?” Even with Rowena explaining what she thought was Dean’s reasoning Sam was still confused and wanted to hear it from Dean.
He got to just stay in the bunker and coordinate and offer advice and research. Which his body was certainly thankful for.
Which if Dads eye keeps twitching every time they mentioned working with someone who wasn’t a hundred percent human he was going to have a permanent tick by the end of this tale.
“My brain keeps going there because after decades of trying to impress Dad and not get on his bad side, I know the easiest ways to piss him off.  Now don’t you have some more plans to work out for this headquarters you want to implement, get busy,”  Dean was officially done with the conversation.
He moved so often he never got close enough to anyone really to have a proper friend. And hookups only filled the void for so long. Sam and Bobby had been the only reliable source of comfort and touch in his life before Cas.
“Obviously It started  after Dean got the Mark of Cain off that was an emotional experience it  made him acknowledge his feeling for Cas but let’s be real darlings we don’t need to go too romantic you are still Dean the emotionally stunted Winchester after all.” Dean pulled a face at that and went to say something  but Rowena continued on before he could.
That statement got a reaction out of Cas with his eyes filling with anger and Dean having to grab Cas by the arm so he didn’t storm out and have a go at John.
A simple salt and burn case popped up on their radar and Dean was itching for a hunt so he offered to go, Sam deciding to go with him.
The rest of the afternoon was a lot more enjoyable, even Rowena found herself liking Brooklyn NineNine. Dean wasn’t surprised though  that Rosa seemed to be her favourite character.
Cas was a bit more subdued not quite knowing what to make of John,  knowing all  the pain he had caused Dean over the years. But still smiled politely and held out his hand to shake following Jacks lead. “Good to meet you John.”
And yet when it came down to it when he was faced with the real thing even after all that training he couldn’t go through with it could he, he couldn’t kill you. Because you broke him out of the trance. You didn't say what you were feeling exactly did you, now I'll leave that confession to you. But it was you saying you needed him that snapped him out of it.
It wasn’t  just the  hunters from the apocalypse world either. Sam had started to contact and get hunters from their own world to come and mingle and team up to help everyone adjust.
But sliding in behind the wheel and taking Baby out on the open road, was healthier than drinking until he passed out.
Heaven was now finally running as a proper democracy, after almost facing extinction they had  finally accepted they needed to change how they ran things. With this second chance they had been given they were smart enough to take advantage of it with guidance from Cas and Jack.
“Because Monsters are Monsters Mom. It is our job as Hunters to kill anything that isn’t human. Werewolves, Vampires, Demons, Reapers, Witches, Nephilim, Angels. We are ignoring that number one rule just by having Rowena, Jack and Cas sitting here with us.” As soon as Dean had made his comment about Dad’s number one rule, Sam had adjusted his chair slightly to put himself between John and Jack and Rowena. While  Dean had maneuvered  himself slightly in front of Cas. Not that the three of them couldn’t easily protect themselves against John but to make it quite clear to John that they were there because Dean and Sam wanted them to be.
It was when they had almost finished all of everything leading up to the apocalypse that wasn’t, when both Sam and Dean looked at each other and realised they had completely and utterly forgotten to mention Adam so that was a necessary quick back track.
No surprise it was Sam asking where he and Cas had gotten off to and if they were going to reappear anything soon. Apparently Dad had questions for them both.
No, you didn’t Dean you let him misunderstand and now here you are both of you putting your life on the line to try and find another way over there. For reasons that are completely false because you don’t have all the information.
It then came to explaining how they ended up defeating Dick Roman and beating the leviathans which  then of course  lead to Purgatory.
“Okay and who is going to be in charge of this headquarters and making sure it runs smoothly?” Asked Dean
“He tried to tell Rowena it wouldn’t matter because it wasn’t like you could marry a guy, so I explained to him that Gay marriage is legal in America now.” Jack helpfully offered.
“It’s necessary because Dean already told his father they were dating dearie he can’t exactly take it back.” Rowenna retorted. Dean never would have guessed that Rowena would ever be on his side and Sam on the opposite. But oddly it wasn’t the weirdest thing in his life today so he let it pass.
Castiel was gone and you just gave up but then Castiel came back because of you. Because you were so upset and emotional that it triggered Jack to tap into his powers and bring him back.
Dean decided though he was going to be a little bit defiant though and wasn’t going to jump as soon as Dad wanted him though so they did finish the last five minutes of the episode they were on before wandering out to the main area.
They hunters already didn’t know him as well as they knew Sam. They didn’t have the same level of respect for Dean and now that they thought he was Gay or Bisexual or whatever Dean wasn’t sure they ever  would.  And he didn’t know how to feel about that.
Days managed to pass without Dean even seeing his father much to his relief. It let Dean just enjoy this charade, a charade he was suddenly incredibly thankful because no one was questioning why he was always with Cas, touching Cas.
“I’m not going to say you look delicious but it’s nice to see both you boys looking so relaxed and happy together. I really am so happy you have each other and that you are feeling more and more comfortable sharing yourselves with us.”  Mary couldn’t help but add, even though it really had nothing to do with her, it did make her feel like she hadn’t ruined her boys lives completely to see them happy and healthy.
John being brought back was a gift from the Angels to show their thanks for Team Free Will’s help as well as sort of a truce. Not the weirdest team up/gift they had even been a part of/received
Because it was easier that way. If I ever did get hit by a truth spell and Sam started asking uncomfortable questions it was easier to blame Dad.
And yet did you tell any of this to Castiel when he was suffering to work out why he was brought back. When he decided the reason must be to be another player in this new mess the Winchester’s have landed them in.
The apocalypse hunters were happy, Mary was happy, John was happy, Jody, Donna and the girls were happy.
It wasn’t for the first time since the Angels had given them their father back that Dean had wished instead they had given them back their Bobby. Apocalypse Bobby may look and sound like their Bobby but he just wasn’t theirs. He wasn’t the man who was more their father than John.
It allowed Dean who had finished his breakfast to make a break for it, gesturing for Cas to come with him. Making an escape while they had a chance
Were you even technically a Winchester until you had been brought back from the dead,it certainly seemed like it was a requirement these days. Dean and Sam certainly never stayed dead, Amara had brought back Mary, and now the Angels with Jack’s help had brought back John. Dean was happy at first, he had everything he wanted since he was four, his family was finally back together. But after the immediate reunion it became quite apparent that it wasn't going to be a perfect family like Dean had let himself at his most vulnerable moments imagine.
“Thank you for finally gracing us with your presence cant say I am surprised by you disappearing though.” And there we go thought Dean not even a minute into this conversation and Dad has already insulted me once.
I could go on about you Castiel but I don’t have all the time in the world and I don’t want to leave Dean here out. Oh no I certainly don't want to do that. But where to start is the question. What moments exact should I pull the curtain on? There is so many to choose from that narrowing it down is quite hard. Oh, Dean, you would think you had only recently learned to speak. You shouldn’t shy away from the chick flick moments as you call them Dean they may help your serious miscommunication problem. So many problems would have been solved easier if you got over yourself and learned to speak properly. That’s what I’m doing now for you doing you a favour.
But with everyone else doing their own thing that really just left Dean with only Cas for company, not that he minded. He would have ended up spending a lot of time with him anyway.
They may not be together but it was just a matter of time. Rowena may not have been Deans first choice for Sam but he had certainly done a lot worse and if she made him happy well that was all he wanted for his brother.
Of course the main reason Rowena was offering help was to piss off John Winchester, who really just rubbed her the wrong way. But goodness you had to be completely blind to not be aware that the two boys were actually in love with each other. She would be shocked if Mary didn’t have her own assumptions about them.
“Okay as fascinating as this is let’s go back to the original question Samuel darling.” Dean was baffled at the fact that Rowena actually sounded curious. Why did Rowena care if Sam was homophobic.
So even though Dad had been gone as long as he had and I had grown and changed as much as I had I still let him have some control over my life.
“Because what if Dad doesn’t come around Dean what if this is a deal breaker. Could you live with knowing that you destroyed your relationship with him over something fake. If you truly think it through and you are ready to face the consequences. I'll have you back I always will. But you have to promise me you know this is going to be worth it no matter the outcome.” Sam was incredibly serious and honestly as he spoke it felt like Jack, Rowena and Cas faded from the room and it was just Sam and Dean.
That left him all caught up. Knowing every dumb, stupid, decision his boys had made since his death.
Well, you see you two you two. you never tell each other the whole story. Let each other know exactly how much you mean to each other.
“I have no idea what you boys are talking about and frankly I don’t care. I was made to promise that I couldn’t comment or ask questions until after you two boys had finished filling me and I kept my promise now you boys need to keep your promise of answering them.” John demanded and Dean was glad that he was able to stop himself from wincing at the tone of his voice.
“My my Castiel, I know your Dean’s but I do have to say how delicious you look in his clothes.” Flirted Rowena.
It probably wasn’t the most coherent speech it may have been a bit rambley. But he had meant every word that came spewing out of his mouth. All those thoughts that had been keeping him awake at night for the last month, the doubts and fears he had had his whole life. Finally got to be heard.
And he went Soldier Cas rationalising what he did and then really brought it home with his final sentence it’s like you said, Dean, whatever it takes.
He had found himself trying to really avoid the other hunters at first after everyone first found out. It’s not that he was scared of their reactions, none could be worse than John’s after all.
