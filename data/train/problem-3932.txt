Understanding it now, he realises another way to stop the spikes is to use the halo as well. Holding them at bay with this power as he crosses.
He steps forward, hand raised as though Castiel might strike him. “Castiel--”
They follow the guard swiftly down the hall and on the way come across Sam and Mervyn passing in the other direction. Sam greets both Dean and Castiel with a wide smile and Dean is about to offer one back when he notes the guard trailing behind his brother and Mervyn. One that he recognises – one of his father’s most trusted guards. He gives Dean a hard look, making his stomach turn and he can’t even summon up the effort to smile at Sam before walking on.
“I’m here to see if you’re okay. And no, Seb did not put me up to this.”
"Is this his first time reading LGBT books?" Castiel asks, walking over to one of their shelves.
Castiel doesn’t hesitate, eyes still trained on the students jogging around the bend, responding, “You were gone?”
Castiel doesn’t look up from where he stands barefooted, fingers on the laces of his jerkin he’s attempting to undo. Dean steps into his personal space, observes the way Castiel’s fingers become more forceful – less graceful – in their movements before he reaches out and secures his hands around Castiel’s wrists.
______________________________________
“Yeah.” He didn’t know what to expect from Charlie at his response. But it certainly wasn’t the way her eyes flash with slight dread and her lips turn into a frown.
The girls are up and ready at seven, hustling about to pack the last few things they need and shoving down breakfast before they’re heading to the docks where Jody and Donna wait for them. Castiel follows behind Dean for the most part, still partially clueless as to what is going on.
He squeezes his eyes shut. And when he opens them once more he turns to the body beside him and watches as Castiel’s chest rises and falls, his lips pursed, brows creased. He reaches out and smooths the crease out with his thumb, observes as Castiel’s face relaxes and wishes he could reach out and smooth away his dread the same.
The shackle shuts tight around his neck. Castiel sweeps his eyes over the other prisoners in the dark. None of them have any shackles around their necks. “Give me your hands.” Castiel keeps his hands by his side. What’s happened? He doesn’t recognise any of the guards. There’s no Nicolaus or Salicar. Why are they doing this? All he knows is he can’t do anything now. He can’t call for Dean’s help. “I said--” Something sharp pokes his abdomen. “--give me your hands.”
Dean exhales deeply, running a hand down over his face. "The mission."
Because they’ve been on a date and Castiel kissed him on the cheek and they almost kissed on the lips and Castiel really,
“That maybe you aren’t really a threat at all, like everyone else seems to think.”
“Captain Naydou,” she says quietly. “Yes, I know.”
“They look nice.”
“I’m sorry for getting so angry at you.”
Dean, mirroring the other night, collapses down on the ground on his back, chest rising and falling rapidly. It was a good race. Castiel only won by fifty or so metres.
“I know,” he says. “I will see you soon, hopefully.”
He’s been spending more time with Mary when he’s free. She hasn’t mentioned anything about what she brought up the other morning and he finds he’s been getting along quite well. She’s been sharing different stories of her son’s childhood and in turn he tells her what he can about his time with them in the castle – at least, the happier times.
Emery’s heart pounds in his chest, eyes flicking between Castiel’s frantic eyes and Catharlo’s confused ones.
And with a guttural cry, muscles straining, power bursting through him, he screams.
It doesn’t stop him from wishing. But he has somewhere else to be.
Except he didn’t throw it. And Castiel knows his mistake as soon as he reappears behind Michael – where Michael has already spun to anticipate him, dagger flying through the air.
“So, first,” Leda says, taking Castiel’s hand and pulling it towards her, “This hand goes here.” She places his hand on her waist, Castiel visibly attempting to stay as far away as possible. Leda laughs gently. “You don’t have to be shy. I’m a grown woman, you know.” She lightly tugs Castiel’s hand until it’s in the correct place on her lower back. The change pulls them closer together and Dean frowns, that jealousy surfacing again.
Castiel huffs. "Well, I'm serious. When I say you're very good looking." And if there's a slight blush on Castiel's cheeks when he says that, Dean certainly can't see it.
“You’ll be okay, my son,” she whispers. “You’re braver than you think.”
______________________________________
“For all of this,” Dean says, and suddenly his own eyes are tearing up.
“I suppose it doesn’t matter now. All will be over soon.”
Leda is next. And Dean has never been more terrified. Especially since he is not prepared for it. He’s merely heading down the hall when he notices a woman staring up ahead of him. He’s never seen her more dishevelled in his life but he recognises her immediately.
Dean folds his things neatly in the corner before standing to see Castiel gazing at the bed, shoulders slumped, hands limp by his side.
“Do you have anything to say for yourself?” his father says, grip if anything, tightening on Castiel’s jaw.
Dean blinks. Best friend? Castiel never mentioned having any best friends? Or at least, sadly, any live ones.
Castiel’s father takes it gladly. “Please, call me James. And it’s nice to finally meet you as well.”
The king shakes his head. “But worse. You not only believed I was torturing my youngest but you allowed it to happen. You had an entire week to stop it. To loosen your tongue. But saving those disgusting beasts was more important to you.”
“We’re supposed to meet in the ball room and wait there until the guards have done a full search of the castle,” Dean continues to stare at him, brows pulled together.
“Yes?”
Castiel stares at him, in awe of him.
“And what about the rest of your family?” Dean asks, and Castiel clenches his jaw and digs his fingernails into his palms.
Something going on here that he doesn’t know about.
Ahead Dean has turned to look at him.
He didn’t think any sound could even reach the dungeons. He can’t imagine how deafening it must’ve been at the actual ball. It had gone on for long enough.
Castiel clears his throat, running a hand through his hair. “Well, I suppose I’ll see you on Monday, then.”
"You next," Castiel says, and after hesitating for a moment, Dean complies, jumping down and immediately having his stomach twist at the stench. He glances back up to see Castiel pull the grate half back over before slowly lowering himself down, teeth gritted as he does. Dean catches onto him, lowering him the rest of the way and helping him lean back against the grimy wall before reaching back up and pulling the grate across.
Michael lifts his gaze, his jaw set and--
Not anymore.
“Dean,” Castiel says, gazing over his shoulder briefly to see if any of his friends are here – because why else would he come early? – but finds no one.
He tries to pretend that it doesn’t matter. He would have had to look for the map of the grace anyway. But who’s telling how powerful the halo could make him? What other abilites it could have granted him. It could quite possibly have made this entire mission much easier and safer for all. Why else would Dean wait until they are alone to tell him?
With one hand on Castiel’s waist, the other on his arm, he helps him to his feet. “Let me take you home.”
“I’m going to ask you a few questions and you’re going to answer them,” he says, voice perfectly calm but his eyes still don’t stray from the knife. “And they may not believe me when I say you’re an angel but they will believe me when I say you tried to kill me.”
"I was just wondering if you could give me a few recommendations." That's it? That's what they were arguing over? Castiel frowns. Maybe the older boy has anxiety or is too shy to do it himself.
Perhaps he’s just caught something. Perhaps it was the festival food he ate yesterday. He hopes so. He runs faster, not wanting to leave Dean for long but at least finally he’s doing something, finally he’s beginning to repay Dean for all those times he cared for him.
Castiel’s smile is small. “He is,” he says quietly and Dean can tell he means it.
The king sneers, grabbing his chin and yanking it up until he can’t look anywhere else but his eyes. “Step out of line again and I will break you apart piece by piece until you’re as senseless as one of those fucking pigs you tried to save.” His skin crawls but he doesn’t pull away.
"If being fifteen minutes late to something is corrupting you then I'm doing a poor job of it." Castiel gives him an unimpressed look. Dean raises his hands in defence. "Well, I can't help keeping you for a little bit longer." Dean leans forward into Castiel's personal space. "I just like you too much," he whispers, before planting a sloppy kiss on Castiel's cheek and nudging Castiel's glasses slightly ajar.
"Of course, it is. It is to everyone. A large room just to yourself, a personal bath, eating the same food as the prince and being a part of important meetings involving the king. Who wouldn't want that?" Catharlo pauses for a moment, as though thinking to himself, before shrugging.
“I apologise for the intrusion. I’ll leave you to your brother.”
Dean knows he is somewhere far, far away.
In fact, he thinks it might be the first words he’s spoken since they departed when he says, “We’re here.”
Michael stumbles back, standing now where Dean once stood. He looks down at his chest, raising his hands slowly to the dagger embedded there.
Dean stares after his father, his mother’s words echoing inside his skull.
orders?” Dean’s eyes are hard when Michael turns to point an accusing finger towards him.
Suddenly it’s just the two of them, alone together in his chambers, a bowl of soup steaming beside the bed. Castiel’s eyes are on the floor, hands behind his back.
After a moment, however, swords still abandoned on the ground, clearly feeling unthreatened, Patrus sighs. “I expected more of my blood. Of ‘Leuric’s’ blood, as some of you called them.”
They chat over mindless things – what they tend to around the farm, what the town they live in is like and so on. Dean's just finishing his meal when the table falls into silence.
As I mentioned last time, I am now updating my AO3 profile page every week or two with my progress on this story if you are ever wondering how things are coming along!
Dean grits his teeth. “You say that you didn’t hurt him – that you would never dare – and yet you’d give him such an ultimatum.”
Dean thrusts into him, faltering in his stroking and a soft moan falls from his lips. Castiel pants wetly into Dean’s shoulder as his own hips jerk forward, his legs quivering beneath him and if it wasn’t for Dean’s hand on his back and Castiel’s own grip on him, he would fall.
Because that was before. This is now.
______________________________________
And his heart pounds with fear – fear that he hasn’t lost Dean to the crowd but to some blade in his throat, through his eye, through his heart and somehow he didn’t see him fall, but he can’t go searching, not now, not when he needs to find the demon and so he presses on, using the fear to fuel him and the men fall before him, one after the other as if all it takes is the mere presence of him to take them down.
"Well, thanks for, you know, having lunch with me," Dean says, shoving his hands in his pockets.
He can’t imagine the fear she must have felt. Trapped alone in the dark with this demon. Everything about his own memories with it now become worse. Every touch, every word that he spent on it, that it spent on him. He would feel sick if he could.
Dean stares at his soup until it goes cold.
Sam’s shoulders slump. “Finally. I didn’t like it when you were fighting.”
Dean shrugs. “I don’t know.” Why does this feel like an interrogation? “Maybe I wanna hang out. You’re kind of fun when you’re not being uptight,” he says, grinning wide but Castiel doesn’t smile back, only glances down at his book, fingers running over the torn spine. He doesn’t answer for a few moments as though he’s thinking about it.
"My husband's niece and my two nephews," Orella says, taking her own seat again. "They're teaching Sam how to carve."
“Something else happened too,” he says, eyes still not meeting Dean’s. He spins the dagger in his palm before holding it tight in his grip.
He stares at his mother, still in shock, but mind clear enough to properly take her in. Her hair is shorter, cut a few inches above her shoulders, a few grey hairs peaking out at the sides. Her face is as bright as he remembers although now it’s weathered, donned with lines of age. She wears a simple breathy undershirt with a brown laced jerkin over the top. No emblem. No fancy jewelry or golden or silver threading.
And Castiel’s face, lips all bitten, eyes squeezed shut, his back arching and head fallen back as he came between them – all because of him. It was enough to push him over the edge.
Dean stares at him, a sad smile on his face. “Maybe that’s why I hurt you. Because I did. And I was afraid.” Castiel’s eyes glimmer and Dean can see he wants to refute it. Say it’s not true. “If you really hurt me, Cas, I wouldn’t be here, would I?”
The voices of the men answering muffle together but the conclusion is the same for everyone. Agreed.
Castiel shakes his head. “It’s my twenty first year in the ninth cycle. The eighteenth of the ninth.” Dean nods his head and takes a sip from his own jug.
The outer wall is already open in front of them and they ride through with no more than a few nods from the guards on rotation. Castiel exhales deeply. Back again.
Dean swallows, heart pounding. What the fuck is going on?
.” Castiel’s mouth drops open, shoving Dean away, who’s head is thrown back in laughter. Castiel shakes his head, but there’s an affectionate smile pulling at his lips that he can’t quite shake away. “I’ll make you run extra laps at training.”
Michael smiles, smug and awful. “But I didn’t. Did I?”
Castiel lets out a heavy breath.
After a two-night stay in Kalapell – since receiving word that the mayor wouldn’t be reaching them until the nineteenth – they finally arrive in Narla. It’s a big town that mostly profits off their production of armour and weapons.
And it’s time.
“But--” Dean’s heart climbs in his throat.
Dean sighs. Here he goes again.
Dean's eyes brighten at that and he offers him a jovial smile, that disappointment now gone, before he shrugs. "Well, your loss," he says playfully, before turning and walking back over to where his friends wait.
7:15: Honk.
But he can't do that like this. So, he lets it all out.
She nods down towards where Castiel and Dean’s hands are still tangled together and then raises her glass.
Dean whines at training and even though he’s incessantly frustrated and wants to drop everything and leave, Castiel pushes through. Other than the constant complaining, he can feel Dean’s mind slipping again, his eyes wandering and he isn’t half as good in fighting Castiel as he should be.
“If you were wondering, no, I don’t believe that you’re not afraid of a beating. Every man breaks sooner or later. And every man fears pain. So, you should show me some respect or I’ll get the guards to teach you another lesson.” If Castiel hadn’t seen his bright eyes out in the sun, he would’ve thought they were pure black with the way they darken. “Perhaps a more permanent one.”
“The demon. You said it asked you who the prophesied was but then it possessed you before you could speak. Then how did it know who Castiel was? How did it know the boy to save?”
Dean’s phone vibrates once more and he flicks his eyes down to see what it reads. Castiel observes a very visible blush spreading up his neck.
“And he came out the other side, he alone, with what we all saw for our own eyes. The souls, all that were trapped waiting in the in between since our ancestors fell, set free. Risen to peace.” Nyree pauses a moment. “And with new knowledge for all of us.”
Rough hands pull him up by the arms and with his knees and feet dragging along the ground, he’s taken to the prince. He only looks up to meet the prince’s eyes for a moment before he’s shoved forward hard into the dirt, his shackled hands only just there in time to stop himself from falling flat on his face. The prince’s boots stand unmoving in front of his eyes.
“Are you hurt? They haven’t hurt you, have they?” he asks, voice laced with accusation and concern.
“Dean?”
hi, everyone! i'm back. just thought i'd write here and say that unfortunately, i was so busy in the last few months that i wasn't able to do barely any writing or editing but thankfully, now i'm back into it! i'm currently writing chapter 18 and just edited the first third of chapter 15 today so things are going a lot better than before. the next chapter after this i'm going to try to get up within three to four weeks but i'll keep you all posted on my tumblr if it turns out otherwise :D
“Of course,” Castiel says, closing the door behind them. He notices Dean’s eyes flicking towards the food – or the lack of eaten food – as he passes it and subsequently towards Castiel as he walks beside him.
"Castiel," she says, voice quiet. "We're so glad you're safe." Castiel’s fists clench behind his back, not returning the embrace. Although the woman doesn’t seem to mind. She leans back a moment, the other angels all watching intently now, as she ducks her head to meet his eyes.
Dean lifts his chin. “Because Castiel and I handled it.”
Deep down, however, he knows in his heart that he won’t.
______________________________________
“Yes, Your Highness.” She bows before leaving the room. Dean stares at the doors of Castiel’s chambers. He looks down at his bandaged hand.
Castiel’s lip quivers. “Just stay with me,” he whispers, curling over him until their foreheads touch.
“Yes, it does!”
Castiel curses himself, louder this time as the shame curls inside of him. He squeezes his eyes shut, hands gripping his hair now – gripping hard enough for it to hurt.
He takes him to great mountain ranges, wild plains and never-ending forests. He takes him to entire cities of different cultures. He sees temples and palaces and villages.
"Charlie?" he says, and she whips her head to the side, shoulders slumping when she sees him.
“Dean,” Castiel says, voice low. Dean’s eyes dart up just as Castiel presses at his wrist roughly with his fingers. Dean shouts, pulling his hand away.
He feels a different pair of eyes on him now and turns to see Sam glaring at him. His brother raises his eyebrows, jabbing a finger in Castiel’s direction, clearly as confused as Dean felt not too long ago because Sam’s the only one Dean ever told the truth to. That he realised he had a slight crush and Castiel up and left and broke his heart. To put it simply.
He hisses, tearing his hand away from the branch it has caught itself on.
But it has Dean’s heart pounding inside of him, gut coiled tight and ready to let go. And he knows, Castiel’s close too, his thigh still trembling beneath his grip, panting growing louder by the second.
“Yeah, this was a mistake. I know.” He smiles at Dean, as though he’s saying sorry. As though he’s trying to say this isn’t his fault. Then he stands. “Excuse me,” he says politely, and Dean watches him disappear inside without another word.
The library. He’s in the library.
“Look. Let me do this and if it doesn’t work out, if he becomes a threat to me, then Nicolaus can come back. And I’ll take all of the precautions, of course. I am one of the most intelligent men you’ve ever met after all.”
Training is all going smoothly when out of the blue Michael pipes up with, “Winchester, stop looking at the coach’s ass.”
It’s only after they’re out of Narla when Dean finally speaks.
“Michael, stop!” he shouts, watching as Castiel, body tense and fear in his eyes gets the first dagger thrown at him. He squeezes his eyes shut and it lands just above his right shoulder. Michael pulls another. Behind him, Dean can hear more feet approaching but Michael doesn’t turn.
Dean’s increasingly aware of the way their thighs and arms are pressed together. His palms start to sweat. Dean huffs and turns his head to see Cas frowning. The angel then adorably tilts his head to the side.
He looks to his brother, watches as a thousand different emotions pushing and pulling flash through his eyes. But he doesn’t speak, the camp now quiet behind him.
And yet, here she is, standing before him. Eyes bright, as they always were.
“I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry. I told them about the angels, I know I shouldn’t have, I should have been strong but I knew the demon despised you and would do anything to--”
Dean’s lips turn down, a soft kind of sadness washing over him at the bitterness in Castiel’s voice. He’s never before looked at Castiel and felt sorry for him. Because…well, because his reputation is based off his own wrong actions. But looking at him now, the way he can’t meet Dean’s eyes, the way his lips are pursed in a thin line as he waits for Dean’s response…it doesn’t seem right.
There are no less prodding eyes on Castiel than the day before when he follows Dean into a room full of generals. The Captain of the Guard gives him another once over as he stands in his place directly behind the prince but nothing more. He is almost certain that the captain and Dean have heard of his scars now. It unsettles him. But he can’t do anything about it. So, he tries to push it out of his mind.
Dean shoots him a small smile for some kind of reassurance but Castiel’s already turned back to the desk, working on the assignment.
But Dean blinks and Castiel’s still walking towards him. Dean smiles.
He pads his way over to where the boy sits next to his brother’s body in the wagon. He doesn’t move at the sound of Reyne approaching.
Dean nods and they quickly switch positions. They start slow, Dean going through the motions to get used to it and then after he’s done that they do it properly. The first time, Castiel swiftly pulls out of his grasp. Dean gapes as Castiel raises his eyebrows innocently.
It appears to work, Castiel glancing up at him, face calm and empty as per usual. “What about you?”
“You’re not actually backing out on me now, are you?” Dean says, eyebrow raised.
“You see that’s the thing, Cas.” Seb and Brady are standing now too, watching carefully, clearly both stunned by Castiel’s outburst. And now he needs to finally end it. “You act all hard, probably think it too. But you’re not. You’re so fucking easy.” He flicks his eyes to Brady and Seb to watch for their reactions, make sure they’re getting pretty fucking convinced. Castiel’s grip loosens on his shirt, his hard gaze faltering. “You probably don’t even mean to cheat, you’re just that easy, man, getting on your knees for just about anybody.” Around him, he notices a few students beginning to look in his direction and shit, it’s time to wrap this up before anyone can investigate. “I mean, fuck, Cas, with your reputation how’d you think I actually wanted to be with you?”
Castiel allows her a moment to regain herself before he starts on his own tale. Part of him does not know where to begin, there is so much to tell. So like her, he starts from the beginning. From the end.
There’s a flutter in his stomach as he approaches the lecture hall.
Nyree joins at the head and it leaves the stool across from Castiel empty. Michael takes his time and when Castiel finally looks up his brother stares back at him, those hazel wings tucked behind him. He feels Dean’s knee nudge against his own under the table.
On either side of the bed are two smalls tables, a few books stacked on both of them with small lanterns and a bell hanging above.
The guard screams – a nasal, disgusting sound – dropping the wooden chest as he clutches his hand to his chest. Castiel takes no time in sheathing his second sword, swooping down to snatch up the chest and taking off into the main street.
"Dean," Castiel says gruffly.
He doesn’t see anyone nearby but he remembers Emery’s words in the sewer. Joren would see them all in battle. And may the Elo de Olapireta be with them all.
“That dude over there is definitely giving you horizontal tango vibes, if you know what I’m saying,” Seb chuckles, amused by himself.
“Don’t thank me. You’re the one that asked me out, remember?”
“No,” he mutters. Castiel nods, and despite all else he smiles.
Dean huffs a rough laugh, standing from the table. “Oh, I’m being selfish. They kidnapped me not you, Cas.”
"As much as I can tell you." The words hang in the air, heavy as a stone. Yes. No. He wants to know everything. But this is too overwhelming already. He wants to follow Castiel onwards into this fight. But he also wants to forget all of this and go home. To where the hardest thing was receiving his father's criticisms. It makes him wonder now, were they even his fathers to begin with?
Emery steals one last glance inside, spying Leda slumped in a chair, shoulders shaking and hands covering her mouth as Dimarus kneels in front of her, a sympathetic look on his face, before he gently closes the door.
Dean takes a deep breath, the fear gripping his throat and almost crushing any words from ever exiting his mouth. “I didn’t escape. I was captured. And I already told you. We were kept in a cell, somewhere near water.”
If she closes her eyes, it’s not hard to imagine being back with Adri in his grandparent’s house. Not hard to imagine that she would be rising to ready herself for work, as she is now.
Perhaps, he was trying to tell Dean what really happened. Without mentioning the unthinkable.
He lets his eyes slip shut.
It’s been three days since he woke from his dream and with panic and fear overwhelming him, he’d throw up all over his bathing room floor.
Castiel waits until Dean’s eyes are on his before smiling. “I would like that.” Dean catches his lower lip with his teeth, clearly restraining a smile as he nods.
The breeze finds its way through a small window in the little alcove he's standing inside, relieving some of his nerves for a moment as he closes his eyes to the wind. He still can't believe this is happening. How could everything have changed in such little time? And all because of a strange man, who waltzed into his life unannounced.
He wonders where Dean is. If he’s waiting in the in between. If he’s afraid. If he’s free of pain. If he’s hoping Castiel will save him.
It dawns on him slowly. Is Castiel here because of the halo? Is he trying to steal it back? But he was captured and taken here. He couldn't have known. Unless he somehow planned to. Dean shoves the journal back under the floorboards. This changes everything. Castiel's death could mean the fate of the world thrown out of balance - innocent souls condemned. The demon can't find him.
Dean blinks, eyes beautiful as they hear his words. He leans in, kissing him hard but gentle all at once.
“Fuck, Cas, I am so sorry for what I said. I never wanted to make you uncomfortable. I just - I - I don’t know what came over -”
“No. My shift has changed. I’m now supposed to serve dinner to the prisoners tonight.” Emery’s eyebrows raise, amusement clear.
Two nights.
The power of the wings, halo and grace.
Castiel feels his heart tugging then and without another thought sweeps his eyes up to the few still standing about them.
“You’ve never heard of Novak?” he says, because sure Cillian’s certainly not the most active in the gossip market but everyone in their year’s surely head of Novak. It’s a small city after all and news travels fast around here. If something gossip worthy happened, everyone knew about it sooner or later. But Cillian only frowns in response.
Dean lets out a deep, shuddering breath as he steps forward and raises his hands to Castiel’s face but he barely grazes his skin before Castiel is pulling away.
When he releases him, he nudges the crown back up from where it’s fallen onto Sam’s forehead.
The last training before the university goes on break for two weeks goes rather well. Castiel’s always liked these ‘last trainings’ because everyone’s completely de-stressed after finishing exams. And not only that but he tries to make it a lot more joyful. He’s not that cruel after all.
Cold dread settles into the centre of his chest as Dean remains quiet. He does not dare to look up as his eyes prick and he thinks,
"He saw us through the window. The next morning, he called me to the throne room. Remember? He wasn't telling me off for leaving the ball early. He was telling me that he saw me with you." Castiel's mind races back to the memory of that morning. Dean's detachment after his meeting with his father. Hope swells up inside of him before he can dampen it. Could it be true? "And that he knew what you are. And I thought - I thought he meant about you. Being an angel. I thought he saw your wings." A few tears slip down Dean's cheek and Castiel's own eyes sting.
“And those that survived have been rebuilding their lives in the Ellwood, it’s true. But Dean wasn’t corrupted by them nor was he captured. You see, Castiel – he was an angel.”
Something inside of him lurches.
And maybe this was stupid, maybe Castiel won’t even be home or maybe he’ll slam the door in his face as soon as he sees who it is--
And all he hears is,
Dean waits patiently, looking up at the window. He has a batman shirt on underneath his button down and has his Dad's jack in his backpack. He’s going to pretend to lift a car for the boy this morning. Dean thinks it’s his most creative idea so far. Although he hopes no one will catch him jacking some random’s car.
✧ ✧ ✧
But then it hits him that he’s also supposed to take off his boots. And then his jerkin and doublet. And then everything else.
Dean grins. “You want to bet on that?”
Dean’s eyes flash with pain before they’re glazed back over with fury. His fist collides hard with Castiel’s face again and again until he feels a cut open up and the smallest drop of blood trickle out.
“No, you’re not,” he says.
Dean reaches for the dagger sheathed at his side just as four guards pool in behind the king.
Her smile fades then and he thinks he sees her look up above. She swallows, hand gripping Dean’s tighter.
The disappointment only festers when they arrive back at camp and are split into two groups – Castiel’s heading off to eat dinner whilst his own unpacks all the supplies from their own bags.
The wings. The halo. The
Sam sniffs, wiping at his face. "Lie down maybe," he mutters, and Dean rubs a reassuring hand up and down his back.
And for the Three and the underworld – for the truth, the humans believed a myth – a story spun and told to give the angel’s a good name.
“And what would that be?” Castiel asks, rising to the bait. Dean shrugs.
The door clicks open beside him but Castiel keeps his eyes down, head hung in shame at his burst of anger as Dean steps out, trousers and boots back on. Castiel’s chest tightens.
"Did you want me to come with you?" Sam shakes his head.
______________________________________
V offers to draw a bath for him instead and while hesitant at first, Dean convinces him to take it and so he does, disappearing into a small room down the hall.
At one point, the prince’s mind has wandered so far that he isn’t even facing Castiel, his back angled toward him and certainly doesn’t hear when Castiel tells him to lift his sword. Castiel growls at the back of his throat, stepping forward and knocking the sword from Dean’s hand with his own.
He doesn’t look happy when Dean enters the room, doors safely closed behind him. Dimarus leans back in his chair, arms folded across his chest. “So, do you have anything to tell me?”
He sees them making love for the first time, on the very bed he sits upon.
But his fingers have cracked and bled with the amount of days he’s spent clinging to rock faces as Michael watched on below – watching as he slid down, scraping the skin off his hands and knees and only being told to start again.
He thinks of the castle, of the front gate that surrounds it and throws them towards it. He hits something hard – something that throws him back onto the grass, hands slipping from Dean and Nyree.
Dean opens his eyes to a knock on the door.
Dean’s eyes widen, body tensing before he blurts, “What?” Is it that obvious? Can she tell? Does she know? No, she can’t possibly know. But--
“Yeah, whatever, I don’t care,” Castiel says flippantly, finally meeting Dean’s eyes for a second. “Let’s just wrap this up. Been here long enough.”
“Have you ever thought that perhaps it was someone on the inside?” Dean eyes narrow.
Never seen Castiel so peaceful.
"So, we've made a bet." The guard presses the iron rod across his ribs. Castiel lets out a harsh sound through his gritted teeth, toes curling in his boots. The guard presses it harder into his skin. His eyes flash with that familiar darkness. "Who can break you first."
Dean barely gives him time for a breath before he’s kissing him again, hands finding his back once more. Castiel slides his hands up Dean’s chest until they curl around Dean’s shoulders, holding him tight against him. Their foreheads are still touching when their lips part and Dean hastily starts to unbutton his own jerkin. Castiel takes a deep breath as he does, bracing himself for what’s to come.
It takes a while to come to him, his mind cruelly trying to relive those last few minutes again and again, but it does.
Dean’s fists unfurl in his lap. He can’t imagine what it must have been like for her. Watching from the side, unable to do anything, unsure of what was really going on.
And perhaps he doesn’t know how. But what he does know is the next step is finding the grace. The next step is to the east.
Dean blinks. “You did?”
Castiel is up to his feet in a second and Dean slowly after him. He’s not sure how he feels about what Castiel has told him. He doesn’t need to be as good as him. But he won’t give this up because he has ‘other things to work towards’. He already knows his father doesn’t even want him to take the throne. If he could choose, he would pick Sam over him any day. There’s a reason he hasn’t been married off to some nice noble lady.
Michael is quiet for a few moments, the silence deafening before he breaks it. “You said it yourself,” he says, voice low. “It was your fault you were revealed.”
“Three days. Midnight. Don’t be late.” With those final words, hissed quietly, the general turns and strides away, steps quiet on the stone floor.
That’s when he sees Castiel’s hands shaking.
It does help that there’s little wind tonight, not that it would affect him from where he crouches in the shadows of the old, weathered jewellery shop’s rooftop. Shouts erupt from across the street, and Castiel sweeps his eyes over to find another man, donning a previously white apron – now covered in grubby fingerprint stains and spilt liquids – standing next to the tipped over wine barrels. He’s waving his hands frantically towards the burly man from before, however, he’s not receiving much response. Castiel regards the scene with indifference and eventually drags his eyes away.
“Huh?” Dean says, spinning his head to see Leda still with her eyes fixed on Castiel, a fond smile on her face. Dean clenches his jaw.
He could have stole it. During the war.
Dean chuckles softly. “Tell him it’s treason to blow the king off to pursue romantic whims.”
Then, what they all saw. What everyone would have seen, in every corner of the very world. Souls being freed from the in between, rising and rising until they vanished from sight, the sky clearing once more.
“Yeah, it is.” The water is pristine, twinkling where the sun reflects off of it. “I used to come here when I was younger with...” His smile begins to fade. “But I haven’t really been in a while.” Castiel suddenly feels special – like he’s being shown something private. And something tells him that what he was going to say was he came here with his mother. “Anyways.” Dean waves a flippant hand, turns, pulling off his golden bands and starts to undo the buttons on his jerkin.
He wishes he’d had more to drink. Maybe that would have been better. For right now, the only thing he can feel is the thumping of his heart and the terror in his gut. The ring on his finger – so beautiful and intricately designed – is suddenly far too tight.
At least that should have been the answer. But Dean had frozen, unsure of himself – unsure of whether that answer is the only reason.
the last time Castiel had a boyfriend. “Kinda a big deal, isn’t it?” Castiel continues to stare at him blankly. Brady cocks his head. “Just cause, you know, you’re not really a one soul kinda guy?”
Until suddenly Castiel lifts his hand to point at the stars and speaks. It’s of a religion a few hundred years old, belonging to the people from an island off the Western coast of Akwanyo – long gone now. He speaks at length then pauses for a while and continues, voice even and words unrushed.
"Then what was your plan?" Castiel pauses. He can't speak all of it. Can't give too much away.
Dean narrows his eyes. Does the demon… not know of the prophecy?
Suddenly, he has the strange sense that he’s being watched. He looks up but the two guards outside of the door aren’t paying him any attention. He sweeps the small garden in front of him but no one’s there. He sweeps his gaze across the entire castle and there – a shadowy outline in the dark. Standing on Dean’s balcony.
Comment below or leave some kudos if you enjoyed! Thanks so much for reading ♥
Dean turns to face Castiel on the porch again, both of them in the exact same position as an hour ago. Castiel’s staring at him carefully, something unreadable in his eyes.
“You took my mother from me. My father from me,” he says, voice rising steadily louder. “My brother from me. My people, my home.” Castiel raises his dagger, standing over Patrus.
He just wants to tell him he didn’t mean to. It just came over him. He just wanted someone to care. He’d been captured and almost enslaved. And yet that’s not enough to punish the people who did that to him? Is his life worth anything? Does anyone care?
Disappointingly, it appears that this weekend won’t work out, Castiel not being available on Saturday and Dean not being available on Sunday, so they’ll most likely have to wait until the weekend after that considering they’re both still busy during the week.
Coaching hasn’t
“It’s okay, Castiel. You should’ve seen Dean the first time I danced with him.”
“Didn’t tell anyone that I wasn’t in control of my healing back then and it had stitched back up before I could bleed out. That you found me sitting in my own blood.” He breathes in deeply in an attempt to keep himself from breaking completely. “And you said
“Ugh, yes, sorry, you were talking about the trade between Senly and Terrowin?” Orderic narrows his eyes, his spectacles slipping slightly down his nose.
They will be staying here for three nights before returning to Anathee unless anything comes up.
______________________________________
“What? No, of course not! How could you possibly think that?” Castiel can feel his chest constricting beneath him. This was never supposed to happen. Dean was never supposed to think that.
Castiel takes a few deep breaths. “Some of the guards who were obviously resentful towards me as well chained me to the wall in a cell holding other prisoners. They…” he hesitates for a moment, the words catching in his throat. “…the prisoners attacked me. I fought them off.” Looking into Dean’s eyes, he can tell the prince knows that’s not the whole story.
Castiel dumps his bag down on the small bench, cutting off any further disastrous thoughts. It’s surprising how much concentration it takes to even peel his own shirt off and kick off his grass stained shoes.
And yet despite all he’s here for he can’t help but indulge. It’s selfish of him. He should be searching this castle top to bottom with every chance he gets. He must discipline himself from now on. He already spends enough time with Dean anyway. Once the festival is over and everyone has settled back to normal, he will begin again. And he won’t take a breath until he’s found what he’s looking for.
Castiel wonders what he was going to say. That he wouldn’t go back and change what happened? That no matter what – no matter that Castiel is an angel, that he would still want this? Castiel himself doesn’t know what he would choose. If he could go back. The world would be better off without this mess, wouldn’t it?
But he did. In such short time, the kingdom turned around, learned to hold their heads high and find their joy again.
Then he stands and looks towards Dean. Dean stares back, not knowing what he will do next.
A man is already standing opposite him. He holds a wooden sword in his right hand and holds out another wooden sword in his left. Castiel steps forward and takes it from the man’s hand, clutching it in his two shackled one’s. The man steps back and his face contains thinly veiled arrogance. Castiel offers him a smile.
One of Dean’s arms quickly wraps around his back, helping to hold him up as the other slides through his hair, clutching at him. Castiel’s own rest curled on Dean’s chest.
“But instead we’ll settle for something else. Kneel,” the king commands, a smug smile on his face. Castiel looks into his eyes – really looks. They’re dark and cruel. So very
But Castiel parts once more, eyes amused, telling him he needs to answer the door and Dean can only brush a thumb over Castiel’s lips one last time before he’s turning and exiting his chambers.
Castiel’s lips curve up and Dean’s heart flutters but suddenly he’s reaching out, curling his hand around Dean’s wrist and his heart sinks, thinking he’s going to shove Dean’s arm away.
“Dean?” Dean snaps out of his thoughts, flushing in embarrassment as Castiel peers at him under his eyelashes. “Are you okay? You look worried?”
“Oh, fuck.” Dean mutters, just as he pushes Cas back into the photo booth and pulls the curtain across. Cas eyes are wide, his mouth parted as he watches Dean shove more coins into the slot.
For as long as you are still strong like a bull and wise like an owl, he supposes.
And yet, for Castiel, this isn’t even the most terrifying part of the evening. That is yet to come.
But Castiel’s throat is thick and he feels as though he won’t be able to breathe if he doesn’t speak now.
“We’ll be watching.”
Dean gives him a small wave, says he'll see Castiel later and then he's gone. Castiel nearly deflates against the counter. He certainly wasn't prepared for this. If he was, he would've at least tried to comb his hair or wear his nice converse shoes not the ratty ones he's wearing now.
The meeting begins, tension arising in the room as they speak of the success of the festival. Dean sees Dimarus staring at Castiel from across the table but none of the other men dare to look in his direction now.
“Yeah, I’m just gonna head down to fetch him. Give us an hour or two.”
“Emery. What would he be up to around now?” Dimarus flicks his eyes to the ceiling, thinking for a few seconds.
“Put the bow down,” he says evenly, Dean’s eyes flicking anywhere but towards him. He huffs, throwing the bow to the ground. “Now pull back the arrow as you would if you were still holding it.” Dean hesitates for a few seconds before complying, raising the arrow in his right hand and holding his left out as if clutching the bow.
As they start following the other students into the gym, Castiel finds that Dean’s hand is nice and warm compared to Castiel’s increasingly sweaty one. As soon as they find the table with his friends, he immediately drops it and wipes his hands on his pants once Dean isn’t looking.
“Nyree and Michael have called a meeting for midday.” Reyne nods. They have meetings often. This is nothing out of the ordinary. It’s her next words that have Reyne’s eyes narrowing. “It’s about Castiel.”
It's the first time that Dean's actually going to come inside his house. Castiel had been contemplating it for a while - asking Dean over to his place - and it was last week that he finally went for it. Although, he felt awkward asking if Dean wanted to just come over for no reason so he made it sound a little better by asking if maybe Dean wanted to come over for a little while in the afternoon before going out to see a movie.
"I missed you so much." And it's like something has finally lifted from his shoulders. He can feel it in Castiel too, the lightness surrounding them.
Dinner was in the kitchen with Sam and Mervyn and Castiel honestly wishes it could have gone on forever. He doesn’t want to go back to their rooms. Where they are alone in the small, suffocating space.
The man nods. “I supposed it really
Dean holds the king’s eyes as he spits in his face.
Dean looks away, focusing on the grime covered stones at the king’s feet.
“Alright,” a guard’s voice from behind him interrupts his thoughts. “That’s enough. Now we must escort you to the Crown Prince. And as I said before – don’t try anything or we’ll gut you here and now.” Castiel lets out a deep breath before nodding and following one of the guards out the door and into the bright and colourful hallway.
He can’t do anything to make them believe he could be an angel. Because if he does – and if this king really is who he thinks he is, they’ll know he has the wings – they’ll know who he is. And then he’ll be done. Along with everyone.
Dean twirls his sword around in his hand. “Every day.”
When he wakes on the third day after battle, it is still dark. He turns his head to find that Castiel isn’t there. Nor is Michael’s body. He sits up, alert now, looking around for any sign of him.
But all he sees is Dean, his eyes wide and mouth forming around his name. Then there’s strong hands reaching out to find his own, jolting him from falling any further.
“But in the end, it wasn’t a choice. I told them it was a young boy from Iowan. A boy named Castiel.”
“But by doing this,” the demon continues, “fighting with them against your kingdom – you are betraying her.” Dean flicks his eyes up from the ring at those words. “The very woman that brought you into this world.”
“Yes,” he says, “Because if you don’t then what was all this for?”
"Cas," he breathes out.
So, he didn't go around to Castiel's house when he came back. Only sulked in his room before going out to start the day -- whatever that entailed.
Castiel makes a strangled sound at the back of his throat as Dean gapes at him. “Dad!” And he’s never been so satisfied than he is now as he watches Castiel’s face burn bright red in embarrassment, a laugh finally spilling from his lips, Castiel’s father joining in. “Fuck you both,” Castiel grumbles, arms crossed petulantly over his chest.
The battle rages on behind them. Beside him, Michael catches his eye. They’re dark and when Michael smiles, it’s one to be afraid of.
“Exactly.” Castiel walks over until he’s standing right in front of Dean. Dean looks as though he might take a step back but holds his ground. “Hit me.”
And to Castiel’s horror, a few spots of blood.
The exhaustion, he's sure is all that's keeping Sam from dissolving. He can see it on his brother's face. The stress of it all. Even worse now that Dean has begun telling him what he's learned. Starting with the religion, which was hard enough. And then telling him of Castiel and his role in all of this and of the angels in hiding and the mission to retrieve the halo and location of the grace.
“Sorry,” he mumbles meekly, pulling his phone out of his pocket to find it’s his father calling and shit, because he should probably answer this because it’s probably important and he’s never hated family drama more than he does in this very moment.
“Uh huh.”
"I'm really sorry, sir. I promise it won't hap-"
“Oh, great because for a second there I thought they’d put you up to it or something just to fuck with me.” Dean waves his hand in the direction of his friends and relief finally fills Castiel. Oh. He huffs a laugh, relieved now himself.
Dean stares at him for a moment before huffing a laugh. “You’re a real charmer, you know that?”
Dean nods, running a tired hand over his face. Castiel brushes his fingers over Dean's knuckles and the prince meets his eyes.
“I just thought I could get to know you,” he says, and it doesn’t surprise him to know that he truly means it. Because maybe this is a stupid thing he’s got himself into and it could end anytime soon but he did it for Castiel in the first place, and he’s not going to let the opportunity to know him better slip away. Especially since so few people know anything about him.
“I’m not sure. It’s too difficult to focus on just one thing.”
Michael holds his eyes as always, unrelenting. But Castiel can see it in them. The knowledge that he is right. His gaze flicks over to those who have appeared behind Michael. Nyree and Reyne, both looking onwards in guilt.
He didn’t think anything was wrong when he woke to an empty bed, the sheets still freshly warm from Castiel’s body. He was only a little sad that he hadn’t been able to wake with him.
He’s shoved roughly to the floor, blood slowly beginning to trickle down his cheek as the blood from his nose slips into his mouth.
He hasn’t been able to hear anything since yesterday. Since--
It seems that the king has it.
Castiel turns back to Sam and Dean. “Come with me and you can get some rest. I’m sure you must have had a long journey,” he says, placing a hand on Sam’s shoulder to guide him forward.
“Look at it. Look at what you’ve done,” he spits, eyes gleaming with tears. “If only you’d whipped him to death when he first came through the gates.”
Dean looks to Castiel. He just shrugs. “Sure.”
“Thank you, Alissande.”
Dean nods, tearing his eyes away from Castiel. “Yes, of course.” He pushes down the emotion that rises in his chest – the one he can’t quite make out. “He will be mad if I’m late.”
And the way Dean has damned Michael. Damned him all that time. Never knowing that Michael was trapped inside the darkness, trying to break free of it’s hold.
Sam is once again quiet as they ready for bed, most likely feeling the tension in the air around him, his thoughts far away from simple conversation. He does try, despite it, to ask of Sam’s day with their mother. But his brother knows his priorities are somewhere else and offers him some small answer before he claims he is tired and needs rest.
The half-moon helps the poor-quality lanterns light up the streets of Kalapell, the town buzzing with the sound of people going about their nights below. Men flood to the brothels and musicians take to the streets to reel in their pay as drunks stumble out of taverns, slurring profanities, their night already over before it even begun. Castiel watches one burly man, his hands still clenched as if wrapped around a glass, ungracefully collapse onto three bags of grain and subsequently knock over the wooden barrels holding – what Castiel can see written on the side – cheap wine imported from Donner’s Bay.
Castiel’s eyes meet his, filled with an empty kind of sorrow. “I don’t know. All I do know is that…” Castiel hesitates a moment and Dean knows he’s pondering whether to tell Dean whatever it is he has to say. His eyes fall away. “All I know is that I have to try.”
But perhaps an inkling of the truth was there. For so far, everything Castiel has said has been a truth within a lie.
“Well, I insist.” The uneasiness is written all over Castiel’s face but he doesn’t go to move away. Dean grabs another smaller cloth from the table and wets it before bringing it up to his face. Castiel leans backwards slightly before seemingly catching himself. His hands are balled into fists on his knees. Dean leans close and slowly, so slowly, raises his empty hand to hold Castiel’s jaw. He keeps his touch light, because if he presses any harder he knows Castiel will pull away.
______________________________________
He strides passed his brother, heading directly towards the forest. He can feel sets of eyes all around, turning one by one towards him.
But he doesn’t quite get there.
“I didn’t say anything to the mayor about the kidnapping. I gave him the money that I was told to and off he went. Are you happy?” Dean says, but his voice holds no contempt.
He hears Dean grunt as he sits down beside him, the door closed now, encasing them in darkness.
“Cas, jesus, just listen to me,
“They’re busy and Sam, the nerd he is, is too busy studying to get his driver’s license so he can’t take himself. And I don’t think he wants to go alone either.” It’s strange. The fondness in Dean’s voice. He’s not sure he’s heard it before. It…surprises him.
Dean fumbles for anything to say, not really knowing
“You’re trying to dress to impress, aren’t you?” Sebastian says, falling back on his bed with a laugh. Dean rolls his eyes but turns away before he can see the blush staining his cheeks.
He pushes himself from his seat, swivelling around to find – an empty balcony, curtains still pulled open.
Coming to end all of this.
"It was a bluff," Dean interrupts, speaking up for the first time in a little while. All eyes turn on him. He swallows. "My...father was holding a meeting with his few trusted generals and guards. I wanted to know what they were going to do to you, so I found a way to listen in. There was no way they could be sure you were an angel. The only thing they had to go off was me and my defensiveness after he told me you being an angel wasn't what he was accusing you of. The idea of this wing power came up but the act, all of it, was a bluff."
And Michael has gone so terribly still and Dean doesn’t understand what is happening, what he is watching between them.
Michael’s glare hardens. “No. You have no idea what it was for me. You have no--”
They're all sitting over in the grandstand, pulling on their jackets and some making quick exits while Castiel sits a few seats away, ticking off everyone who came to the session on his clipboard. He's there only for a minute or so when he hears someone clear their throat beside him. Narrowing his eyes, he glances up to find none other than Dean Winchester standing there.
Thank Leuric it’s summer for it doesn’t get so cold when night comes. He’s gone as fast as he can, knowing that with every moment he is outside the barrier, he is in danger of the demon. He wonders even if this is some twisted game and if the demon is really watching and just as he arrives at the barrier, they will whisk him away.
It's like the earth itself lets out a pent-up breath when William tells them it appears the guards have finished their search, coming up empty handed, and that he’s received word from Emery. It's nothing much. Only a short letter.
Castiel could have come alone. Could have fought the demon alone. They could have spared the lives that will be lost in the battle. They could have decided one life was not worth it.
Dean observes the way Emery’s looks away, observes the redness to Catharlo’s cheeks, the shame and hesitance filling his eyes.
"So, remember: Lights are out at nine o'clock and no later. If we see that your lights aren't out by then we'll be coming over, okay?" Dean says, watching as the girls all nod. "And lights out means that there's no talking or sending some last few texts on your phone. If anyone has any problems or emergencies, you come knock on our doors, okay? Alright, goodnight girls."
Dean lets her hand slip from his own and tells himself that what she speaks is the truth. She steps aside, bending down to embrace Sam next and say her goodbyes.
“You don’t have to apologise, Cas. To my friends. To me. Especially me. I deserved--”
For those who missed it, I was unfortunately sick all week from the first new meds but I've discontinued them as they just seem to not be working out at all and I was able to finally get the chapter up even though it was a little over the weekly schedule, so my apologies. The next chapter will hopefully be up in a weeks time so Thursday ~8/9pm AEST but I'll update here if it's not! Thank you all again for your lovely comments! They really help and encourage me <3
But others may have just seen the lights, souls released from their hidden cage, free to drift away into the world, and wanted to know the truth of it all. The truth that is the angels lived. The truth that is gods and prophecies.
For the first time since he left this world, Dean slips his mind.
So, he waits.
And despite that his head is already wrought with thoughts of what’s to come, of what he’s to face, he’s happy for Dean. Since he was a young boy, he always understood that some people, some of those without wings did not understand nor approve of certain ways the angels loved. Ways that he grew to find he loved.
✧ ✧ ✧
Elaria narrows her eyes. “Yes. His birth day is in a week.”
Castiel's eyes widen in disbelief and he pushes himself up again. "I was fifteen minutes late, thank you. And I've never been fifteen minutes late. You're corrupting me." Dean pushes himself up until he's sitting next to Castiel.
Castiel sighs a little, probably relieved in the change of subject. “Try to. You the same?”
Dean shakes his head, tears slipping down his cheeks, his hands grasping at his waist, gripping his shirt tightly. “No, no, it’s not okay. How is this okay?”
Dean greets his brother and his own personal guard with a warm smile – and if Castiel didn’t see it for himself he wouldn’t have believed anyone who said the Crown Prince could smile
He tells her of how they were reunited with their mother, dead for ten years in their minds. He told her of how they went back and were caught and how the king declared war.

(See the end of the chapter for
He’d felt sick. The fear in Castiel’s eyes. The shame as Dean stood there staring. His voice cracking. All of it.
His wrist is weak.
Dean shuffles slightly on the mattress. “Getting comfy,” he responds, hoping he sounds as uncaring as he’s trying to.
But in the furtherest corners of his mind, he knows he’d never be able to. He’s fallen too hard. He won’t ever be able to forget that. And there are still too many things conflicting. Like why Dean would make love to him. Why he would cry tears over him. Why he wouldn’t have just let Castiel fall off that cliff to his death below.
Once they settle inside, they wait until they get word and then more allies sweep out and into their positions around the square. Only two remain with them. Castiel has yet to gain their names.
This won’t last forever. He’s going to leave. Dean isn’t more important than his people. Than the fate of everything. And it tears him apart to admit it. But it’s true. No one is more important than this.
"Dean." Castiel smiles back.
Castiel only hopes that Dean likes him in return.
He feels Castiel’s gaze heavy on the side of his face. He wants to gaze back. He wants to look into his eyes and find all of his answers layed out there clearly. But he also wants to shove him hard and yell at him for what he’s done. What he’s made Dean into – what he’s made him feel. He’s the reason they’re in this whole mess.
“It’s fine, Dean, don’t worry. They’ve embarrassed me far worse than this in our short time together.” Dean lets out a small laugh that draws the attention of Castiel’s eyes towards the curve of Dean’s mouth. He opens it again as though he might say something but it’s only followed by him mumbling something inaudible to himself before he runs off to catch up with everyone.
Castiel swallows, throat dry and coughs, blood spilling over his lip.
He tucks himself under the sheets, laying his head down on the pillow. Sam's brows are creased and Dean reaches out to brush a strand of hair from his face before letting his own eyes close.
"Well, perhaps not down to the details. But this isn't just everyday life. This is the battle between light and dark. Good and evil. The prophecy hasn't been wrong yet. Castiel is the one. And he will find a way. I believe in him. We all do."
Dean throws his head back to laugh and Castiel would usually think it’s over the top but his laugh makes Castiel’s chest bloom with that strange warmth and the sight of Dean like that does things to him that he doesn’t want to think about.
"What do we do?" Dean says, voice panicked as he looks between both Charlie and Castiel.
But then everything comes crashing back into him and his throat closes up, tears forming behind his eyes. Hs rips his hand out of Dean’s grasp and takes off towards the castle. He winds his way through the halls and up the stairs until he reaches their chambers, barging in without a moment’s thought – not even caring that he’s leaving Dean behind – that he’s failing at his only job.
Michael looks at his younger brother then, meeting his gaze head on and something unsaid is exchanged between them.
Dawn breaks just as they come to a cave entrance descending slowly underground, wide enough for only two men abreast.
,” Dean splutters, pulling back and Castiel’s already walking away. “Fucking sadist,” Dean calls after him and he swears he hears him laugh. “Yeah, love you too, honey.”
“Don’t cry, little brother,” he says, and it’s only then Castiel realises the tears slipping silently down his face. “You freed me. You freed me, Castiel.”
His pants hard as he stares at Dean – eyes hurt and confused. He’s too angry to even notice Dean’s other hand come up to gently brush against his own where it lies on Dean’s chest.
So...
The second day is harder, Sam tiring quickly and in pain with blisters on his feet. Dean and Castiel takes turns in carrying him on their backs - something to which the smaller Winchester is entirely embarrassed and apologetic about, although Castiel's apologetic that he is even here in the first place.
They make their way to the edge, Leda always too embarrassed to be the centre of attention. Dean never says anything, however, as every day goes by he feels the same way too. He supposes it has to do with his father shaming him more and more with every moon that passes by.
______________________________________
“Try and sleep through,” Dean replies softly.
Dean is always determined in training. He’s focused and ready to do practically anything, taking hits without complaint. Well, these days he does. But somehow today, he is even more determined. Before, Castiel wouldn’t have thought it were possible but now as he watches Dean, light on his feet, dodging Castiel’s blows and barely even wincing when he’s taken down before he’s up on his feet ready for the next move, he certainly thinks it’s possible.
“She decided to go travel for the week with a friend of hers out to a small country town in the east.” The final light appears to die from V’s eyes. “There was raid by bandits and guards from the royal castle were sent to help.” Guilt washes over Dean. “And help they did. They eradicated the bandits, killed most and sent the rest fleeing.” She hesitates. “They must have felt they deserved something for it.”
But today is different, without them even knowing it.
He strikes hard but Castiel only spins out of reach. Dean clenches his teeth, sweat dripping down his forehead. The rage fills his veins as he strikes once more only to have it parried.
Until he realises the shouting has disappated and suddenly his name is being said. Castiel’s eyes flutter open to find none other than Michael standing before him, his eyes not meeting--
His fists move quickly before his eyes but he sees the flashes of red. The front of the tree is smeared with blood, some of it darker than the rest. Something tightens inside of him. He wonders how long he has been doing this for.
Dean grits his teeth.
And Castiel sees it. The bait. But he has nothing else. “The second sacrifice?”
But his father’s eyes barely flicker. “And it will be your fault. Just like with your
Her hands are everywhere this time, trailing over and up his chest until they slowly trail down, down – Dean’s hand barely having moved from her back – and suddenly, panic rips through him and he can’t.
He stands there a moment, silent, before he nods. Castiel’s almost out the door when Nyree’s voice halts him.
And Castiel’s hands tremble because he must be dreaming he must be, how can--
Even when Sam rang over the weekend, it wasn’t enough to make him smile and he had to force himself to sound cheery enough so his little brother wouldn’t question it.
It’s like his whole-body senses when Dean arrives – like out of all the sixth senses he could have gained this is the one he ended up with – and he strains himself not to glance in the man’s direction. It’s almost impossible though with his loud laugh and all of his friends conversing
“My mother told me something in the in between. I was afraid to tell you because…” He trails off, sorrow rising again.
Castiel strides towards Dean just as Nyree grabs him.
“For what?” Dean whispers back. Castiel lets go of Dean’s shirt and holds his forearms up in front of him. There are multiple scars on each arm that Dean can only assume were from self harm. Dean’s heart breaks for the second time today.
Castiel stares at his hand, reminded of the last time he ventured through the forest, cutting himself and accidentally pulling his grace out before pushing it back inside.
Castiel’s just interesting. Different. In a weird, hot kinda way.
“Yes,” he whispers. He recalls it clearly. After all, it was the night before Dean shut off – before Dean pushed him back against the table – before all of this. Dean’s tongue pokes out to wet his lips.
Patrus shakes their head, eyes bitter. “You of all people should understand my plight.”
“Good. I will see you sooner than you think, my son.”
He holds out to stop Catharlo in his tracks. The man comes to a halt, eyes narrowed. Thankfully, they are on the outside of the soldiers that march so it’s easy for those behind them to avoid them where they stand.
“You should rest,” he says. “Or at least bathe. I can get someone to bring up hot water if you want.” Castiel’s eyes widen slightly. “Or have them leave it outside,” he adds quickly. Castiel relaxes, nodding.
“I thought I already had additional guards coming with me,” he responds, remembering that they talked about how four other guards were coming – as is standard – at one of his other meetings.
“C’mon, Mr Winchester! It’s not that bad,” Robin shouts. Castiel raises his eyebrows.
Dean's not looking at the camera though. He's looking at Castiel. Castiel who has a small, sweet smile on his face. And he's looking at him like he's staring at the stars themselves.
And that’s it.
His breath catches in his throat.
Castiel laughs bitterly. "Oh poor, Dean Winchester. I give my condolences," he says sarcastically.
“And the two princes were announced to the castle within that they had been sent to a manor a fair way out from the city to rest and deal with the trauma they had both recently experienced. But Joren noted both the king and his guards entering the dungeons the following morning the prince disapp--"
Dean scoffs. “What? I don’t wish--”
"It does. I know you're doing better now but I can still be here for you. We can start over," Dean says, hoping desperately and at the same time trying to keep the hope at bay.
For his palm is fine – no trace of any wound at all bar the lightest smear of blood across his thumb. Dean, thankfully, doesn’t seem to notice it, dropping it as soon as he sees it’s bare of the mess of red and scraped skin he thinks he glimpsed before.
There are even more nobles to greet and chat politely with at the ball. He can always sense Castiel lingering behind him and while it makes everything more bearable it’s also increasingly distracting. Castiel’s not doing anything either but Dean’s mind can’t stop wandering – always distinctly aware of his proximity and always wondering if after this, would Castiel want to dance with him.
Castiel sighs. Yes, it was. A good dream but a dream nonetheless.

His eyes flutter closed as the pressure in his stomach is released, hands still gripping tightly onto Dean. Dean himself, is already reaching for his belt and throwing it to the floor. Castiel feels guilt rise inside of him – wanting to reciprocate but not knowing how – not knowing if he can.
“Would you like me to fetch anything else, Your Highness?” she asks, eyes worried. “Hot water for the baths? Another--”
Everything is on him. He can’t destroy it all for the sake of some pathetic need to be loved and cared for.
Michael only narrows his eyes before he does the same. They mirror each other in their stances as Castiel takes a breath – allows every emotion to wash away. Allows Dean to wash away.
Castiel lifts his hands, trying to calm the rate of his heart. Free shackles – thankfully not chained to the wall – latch onto his hands. The guard winks at him before leaving the cell.
"You're awake," Orella says, standing and grabbing another plate and more cutlery from the cupboard behind her. "Please take a seat and dig in. You must be starved." Castiel’s chest knots. Did she notice how little he ate yesterday?

“Why not?”
“So you were just jealous?” Cas asks, his voice tinged with humour. Dean looks up to see Cas grinning and he begins to blush.
And just like that, she’s finished, packing her things but before she can make it to the door, he speaks, “Alissande.” She turns, eyes wary.
Castiel bites his lip. “Depends.”
Dean sighs, taking a sip of his beer.
Dean’s eyes fall to the ground. He likes to believe he is a good person, that he stays true to himself. But sometimes he’s not so sure.
"I think it's time we discuss your travels," Orella says carefully. Dean sighs, preparing himself for whatever is to come. Sam looks anxious beside him, not too happy to be reminded of their situation.
Dean blinks, looking down at the wound in his stomach, his memories fresh in his mind.
Dean blinks. “What?”
Castiel is sorry to hear it but he is glad Kyra found someone to love and glad that Elaria has others she can rely on. It’s clear neither Laiba or Usman are angels but he gathers from the concern in their eyes they care much for her.
It’s around 7:00 when he passes a few houses and decides that instead of going around he’ll cut through the hospital parking lot. It’s mostly empty, only a few people walking to work, but then again it is a small town. Dean’s so caught up in his own thoughts as he strides across the lot, that he trips over his own feet and goes face first into the cement.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, good. Then you'll definitely have fun." Dean wipes his sweaty palms on his shorts, looking out towards the road. The traffic isn't too bad this morning and since they were able to get out on time it looks as though they'll be able to get there pretty quickly. All of this, of course, he thinks to try and get his mind away from how close Castiel is sitting next to him, their legs and shoulders almost touching.
Dean’s been sitting on a couch next to Benny trying his hardest to not glare at the girls who seem to be grinding all over his boyfriend.
Castiel sits silently for a moment, mulling it over, as Dean chews nervously on his lip. Castiel doesn’t know why he would be nervous. He’s not the one who has to -
He doesn’t look at him as he speaks. “You shouldn’t leave Sam alone for too long.” He hadn’t even thought about how much time had passed but he’s right. He can’t linger here. He can’t leave Sam alone right now.
Brady scoffs but stalks back to his table anyway.
Dean slowly drags his eyes away and down towards Sam. “Castiel doesn’t want to go to the pen, Sam. We have things to–-”
“Should we, uh…” Dean gestures towards his desk. Castiel nods, setting his backpack down on the desk as he slumps down in Dean’s chair. By the time Dean’s dragged Sebastian’s chair over any sign of the sadness Castiel held a moment ago is gone, replaced by that casual, relaxed confidence.
Something happened there that he didn’t understand. That only the two of them knew.
"Well, get on with it. We're waiting." Mr Crowley says, tapping Castiel's desk impatiently.
The cheers continue all around him, growing louder with each passing second and it’s only as he looks again that he sees what’s really in Emery’s eyes.
“I will not forget what you did with that man. I don’t believe I ever will,” he says, and Dean believes it so for the anger in his voice. “But fortunately for you, you are a prince. I cannot just have you so publicly punished. So, this is what will happen. You will atone for what you have done by doing exactly as I say from now on and will never cause such disorder again. You will not tell your brother of what went on between you and this man nor anyone else nor will you sully your brother with your disobedient ways. And when the time comes and I am to pass on my crown, you will step down by reason that you are unfit for the duty and Sam will take up the crown. Do you understand?”
They stand there for a long few moments – the silence dragging on until Castiel can’t bear it anymore.
Hope rises in his chest and he knows that if he’s wrong, it will crush him. There’s no going back from this.
And of course, how Dean had Castiel take punishment in the dungeons to spare the mayor of Lithos and his town. Many of the guards were overjoyed to hear it. Catharlo had been terribly relieved to find out that Emery did not feel the same. Despite what they heard, they felt sorry for the man. He had done his duty, hadn’t he?
As Castiel begins to pull their Three, their power out of them.
Catharlo could barely believe it. He didn’t notice anything of the like when he was following the prince around in the small amount of time he was his guard. He still feels guilty about losing him almost a week ago, however. The prince had wanted to peruse the library and he’d seen nothing wrong with allowing him to wander a little. But then Emery had passed by and held his attention a little longer than he probably should have.
Dean looks to him just as the sun peeks over the horizon. He smiles gentle and beautiful before he stands. Castiel follows him to his feet, brushing his hands on his knees.
“Well?” Dean says, hand still in Castiel’s own, the sunlight reflecting off the golden bands on their fingers. “What do you think?”
Just when he thinks he isn’t going to get an answer, Dean breathes, “They’re beautiful.”
“What?”
He swallows audibly under Dean’s gaze. But there’s nothing fierce about it. It’s soft and yet somehow filled with sadness.
Upon returning from their morning training session – which went a little better than he thought – Castiel finds one of the young maids from the baths waiting beside the dining table.
The first punch merely grazes the side of his face. “You’re one of them.” The next hits him square in the jaw but his hands only clutch tightly to Dean’s clothes. “You took her.” More tears spill down his face as Dean continues to beat him. “You killed her – you fucking animal,” he spits, and it’s hard to tell at this point which is his own tears, his own blood or the tears falling from Dean’s own face.
He intertwines their fingers before guiding it away, in between them until he wraps it around his cock. And Dean moans into his mouth as Castiel’s lips part at his touch.
“Nyree needs to speak to you. She is waiting for you in the map room.” Reyne flicks his gaze to Castiel, and he knows Reyne can sense his worry.
When he first found it with his mother, they made markings in the trees so that they could always find their way back. The markings have long since faded and the only map Dean has is the one in his mind.
They're in Anathee, capital of Torrin. He suddenly remembers all in incredibly vivid detail what had happened the last time he was conscious and how the last thing he saw was a butt of a sword. It's only then, that he feels the throbbing pain of his head. He reaches up with shackled hands and touches it. There's flaky, dried blood all down his forehead and a serious lump at the edge of his hairline. The blood is dry. He lets out a deep breath. Just by the feel, however, he can tell he'll be fine even without healing. It hurts his head to try but he can’t do much anyways since it’s visible.

He rips his gaze from the city beyond the wall and focuses back on the landscape in front of them. They’re heading to the east – towards the sea. A mile of grass stretches on before it hits the forest – the treeline of which is just less than a mile away from the edge of a cliff – the only place where the inner wall could not be built. Not that it worried anyone in the castle. The cliff is a straight drop into jagged rocks.
“You are.”
She doesn’t waste a moment before she launches herself into his arms, wrapping her own around his neck and squeezing tighter than she ever has.
The angels carrying their things place them down beside the table before leaving them in peace. After a few kind words Nyree heads inside the kitchens with the other angels, and suddenly it’s only the four of them, Sam, Castiel, himself and his mother in this too large, too empty room.
“I’m fine,” he says, voice firm but Castiel notes it cracking.
Behind him there are cries of terror. Castiel’s eyes prick. He didn’t mean to scare anyone – he didn’t mean to--
“Cas,” he exhales against his lips, as he pushes a leg in between Castiel’s thighs, one hand curling into his hair and the other gripping at his lower back.
Castiel swallows and even in the dark he can see the heat on his cheeks, the flush that spreads to his neck.
Castiel finally huffs and mutters “Go on,” before watching as the students take off down the hall after Dean.
He begins hard but eases up when it becomes clear that Dean is not at his best. His focus is elsewhere and Castiel can’t blame him. So, he strikes and parries and at one point when Dean takes a moment or ten too long to raise his sword again, Castiel waits for him. If Dean notices, he doesn’t mention it. Although, Castiel’s sure he doesn’t. He barely seems to notice anything. And his eyes keep flicking towards the outer wall and the city beyond.
✧ ✧ ✧
He's not sure, as of this moment, if he can do either. But he'll have to make the decision soon. And he'll have to come up with a way other than going through the forest to get out because not only would a guard surely spot them making their way across the bare fields but the steep drop into the ocean doesn’t exactly bode well for anyone.
Emery sighs. “Just needed a little time away from everyone.” Catharlo jerks back, frowning.
“Are you going to teach me or what?” Dean asks, his patience running thin. Castiel almost retorts that he needs to work on his patience too if he’s going to be the very best but bites his tongue.
"So you think my eyes contain galaxies, huh?" Dean asks, placing his hands in front of Castiel, on his desk. Words seem to fail him because the best he can do is nod. However, it seems to work as Dean gives a small chuckle in return.
Castiel’s too tired to worry, knowing he is most likely only going to his brother. He is pulled from a dreamless sleep at some point through the night to Dean pressing in behind him, one arm curling over him, tangling their fingers together.
They stay there for a long time, Dean’s hands curled around Castiel’s neck, thumbs tracing every bump and dip of his jaw – Castiel’s own hands curling tighter and tighter around the fabric of Dean’s jerkin as they kiss languidly.
“Dean,” she says, voice firm now, willing him to believe. “Your mother is dead. Her soul has been waiting in the in between for over ten years.”
“It means angel. Two angels,” Castiel says, horror washing over his features.
“We'll rest some more and in a few hours, we’ll head back out to the sewers."
They follow that familiar trail all the way to the lake. Castiel asks him to tie the horses as he disappears into the trees and when Dean walks into the clearing before the water, he gasps.
