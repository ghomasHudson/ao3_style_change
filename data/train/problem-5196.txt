A bell dings above his head and the room smells fucking heavenly. All around him is a jungle of flowers of different kinds and colours, green leafs spilling over ceramic pots. He blinks around himself, dazzled, imagining what Castiel would like. Would he like
“Just a sneak peek?” Dean grins. He takes his hands away from warm Cas’ body and rolls his balaclava up with shaky fingers over his mouth, stopping just below his nose. “I guess you can get to see I’m grinning like an idiot right now.”
ass.”
”Yeah? And why don’t you tell that to the girl you were ogling at the grocery store?”
”Very much,” Dean confirms, holding back a surprised laugh. He supposes that’s what he deserves after all the nicknames. Shouldn’t bite the hand that feeds you, though, but he doesn’t feel snarky enough to say it.
Prepared for a hostage situation or something else, they sneak cautiously inside the home.
a bit too heavy to drop still - but at least he hopes all that adoration he feels his heart full to the brink of got shown through the dozen mixtapes he’s made over the months, signed for his Cas, or his Sunshine, or something else entirely that the mood calls for, with two x’s for two kisses at the end. Hell, he just knows too many good songs to not make use of them. He may not be good with words, but he’s very good with memorizing cheesy lyrics.
dude, so let’s save it for the morning. Alright, sweetpea?”
”And we figured we had to ask you,” Dean continues, masking his inner turmoil with a voice that feigns stability, sometimes harshness, ”if you remember any names at all of who you saved before, when this was happening. If it’s going to keep the pattern, it’s someone in their next of kin whose life is at stake.”
And it sends pleasant shivers up his spine.
”No,” Dean seethes, scanning for his best plan of action. He grips the blade handle so hard his knuckles crack. ”Everyone has a motive. Even a bitch like you.”
”Honey can be stored— wait, first I mean to say my love for you is like
They start to rock from side to side together, making a slow dance out of it. Dean’s eyes fall repeatedly on Cas’ lips, so close to his own, still behind the mask, until he gives up and lets his gaze stay there for good. He’s not sure he can tell anyway. This is fine. Dean is burning up from inside out, but this is totally fine.
Dean snaps his head to the side to stare at him. ”You… You
Dean’s heart is pounding, blood soaring in his ears. He tries not to look at the demolished chandelier and the cracks in the floor as the threat of tears start to close off his throat, threatening to waver the stability he usually can keep at bay. ”Who the
”Buy a girl a drink first,” Dean sputters immediately as he doubles over. ”Son of a bitch. I told you this makes me motion sick.”
Dean keeps the staring contest a little longer. Then he shakes his head and stands back up, hands up in surrender. ”Whatever, dude. Take five minutes if it makes you feel better.” He backs away, muttering under his breath. ”Don’t have to be a dick about it.”
He extracts his flashlight and looks around himself at grimy walls, spiderwebs in the corners catching the light in its threads. He scrunches his face up. Then he continues down a corridor, pushing through a few doors with his shoulder and scanning the rooms.
Dean’s heart stutters in his chest. He stares in front of himself, at his get-up on the chair by the bed. ”Alright, let’s hold that thought,” he murmurs. ”I’ll get dressed and be there in two shakes. Uh, well. I’ll be specific: let’s meet in about 20 minutes.”
proud of him), but he does not, in fact, want that six and a half feet dick and his surfer hair flopping all over him. No thanks.
It’s...
It takes 35 minutes for Dean Smith to break the silence.
A lot of them got married at the Roadhouse, Dean recalls, and a lot around Valentine’s day. The Harvelles would be officiating, open bar, all that cheesy and lovey dovey crap. And, for what it’s worth... That would have been good. Yeah, Dean would have liked that; he’d have been surrounded by all the people he loved and, worst is, it’s so goddamn
he hisses, eyes shutting and head tilting back against the mattress. His dick twitches against his stomach, leaking and begging. It’s just, like it’s all too good to be true. Rephrase: it’s exactly what he fucking needed.
”Your reports,” Cas reminds him, not bothering to not sound sassy about it. Dean makes a note to remember that. ”I got them done for tomorrow.”
”Yeah,” Dean chuckles quietly, mesmerized by his eyes for the millionth time. He’ll be mesmerized a million times more, he’s sure. ”Fine like this. I’ll take it anyday, over anything else.”
Castiel shifted with a sigh. Siri wasn’t as intelligent as Dean had once made her out to be. He decided to try a task he knew she could follow through.
It’s lean and muscular, for sure, but nonetheless covered in scars, burns, bruises, dental floss stitches. Memories of bad guys from his career or from his childhood alike. But Cas doesn’t seem to see the ugliness Dean can easily point out. He still looks as if he’s seeing the most attractive thing he ever did see. Still.
“Oh, how I bow down to thee,” Dean snarks as he slaps his hands away again.
”Well, what you’re doing, preferably. And what I can do to help other than stand around like a goddamn muppet.”

Priorities, priorities.
”What do you mean, he

Well, a little.

Castiel looks him square in the eyes, squinting. ”
He’s going to be late for work.
”Bite me,” Dean snaps.
”Fine like this,” Cas tells him intently.
Sam puts his hands in his pocket and tilts his head, a hint of skepticism in his narrowed eyes as he tries to decide on the matter. Then he lightly elbows Dean in the side. “I mean, I’m pretty sure he saved your ass again, so. No choice but to stan.”
Things he hasn’t felt in years. Or ever.
Dean stops him by rolling his eyes. ”If you’re going to say it’s
Now though, he and Sam have a room each, without damaged windows or drippy ceilings or ice cold floors. Some lady lives downstairs but it just means Dean runs into one of her cats every once in a blue moon when he stumbles out to the garage and nearly trips on one of the fluffy little bastards in the dark. There’s a pretty big, airy and light living room that leads to each of their bedrooms on either side, which works mighty fine as a sound block, of a kind. When Cas comes to visit it’s handy dandy. But Dean has an incredible stereo for KISS and AC/DC and all his other examples of why he has the greatest taste in music ever, and Sam can also put on some Taylor Swift or whatever it is he listens to, shutting out whatever
And fucking goddamn it,  because it makes him
“Woah, buddy, what was that about not touching evidence?” Dean jeers.
”If you ask nicely, maybe I won’t be.”
Blue eyes flicker up to his, but Dean’s attention stays on his body. He starts to fix the collar on his trenchcoat. It absolutely needs fixing.
”Ew! Keep it PG-13!” Sam shrieked and tipped his chair from the velocity of which he got up and ran out of the room. ”Spare me!”
Sam rubbed his face, as if he didn’t want to surface again. Then he drew a hand through his long hair with a deep, painful sigh. ”No, you’re right. Okay.” He cleared his throat, gesturing towards the black screen. ”Can you explain what you said?”
Staring at the time on the display for a moment, he’s confused and disoriented he let himself be knocked out for so long; he guesses his brother could tell he really needed it. For his beauty. And crankiness. Then he stares confused at the caller.
. He’s liking his worthless bottom energy as much as Dean is loving his direction and control in return.
“It’s twice in a row. You should really send him a gift bag.”
“I think I have an understanding from your description,” he says, “albeit confusing.” He rounds the counter and walks up to a glass case. “How about the roses?”

Ugh. What a weird thought.

But, alas.
“I’ll take both if he says no,” Sam grins mischievously. Stupid health nut. This geek eats salads and pretends it’s good. ”And hey, he’s not exactly bad looking, is he?”

”I accept that strange inquiry,” comes the drawl from behind.
He puts his hand on the back of Sam’s chair, steadying himself. He breathes out heavily as the information sinks in. ”You think Jorgenson in the pic is an heir to Jorgenson of today?”
Dean wants to ask, oh man, there’s so much he wants to ask. Instead he keeps quiet as they start towards the building. He knows at the same time, he can tell nothing to Sam. Not yet. Not until he knows more and where they stand. These things are said in confidence; maybe Dean shouldn’t throw that all away.
”None taken, Dean,” Cas smiles. ”It’s actually more than—”
”When this tall man isn’t my HR guy,” Dean starts to explain, ”recruiting trenchcoat dudes to my Demonblade crusades, he helps with other stuff, yeah. Figuring out clues and like, checking info. He loves nerding it up.”
Dean smirks devilishly against Cas’ skin as he feels his eager, nimble hands start to mess with unbuckling Dean’s toolbelt.
”You gotta ask, huh?
He’s seen too many gorgeous men in too many settings, positions... too many times alone in a rented room, with a rented film and his hand down his pants, transfixed by the men on the screen.
Castiel nods, understanding; a professional kind of empathy. Dean is just a stupid fucking guy trying to impress his girl or something. It must get tiresome to deal with Deans. Multiples.
”Hello, Thunderbird,” Sam says through the speaker and Castiel flicks his eyes up at Dean, who in turn makes sure to look certain. ”If you remember, we talked yesterday. I’ve found some info about the case that could be helpful.”
Dean has seen in his whole life and he grabs his dick to start stroking while he grinds his hips, flush to Castiel’s, biting his lips together and brow furrowed in concentration.
“There is no evidence to be found,” Thunderbird informs him, “therefore I no longer hold any care.”
”It wasn’t your fault.”
”I run on pure fuel.” Dean pats his stomach obnoxiously. ”Pepperoni pizza. Oh yeah.”
Thing is, he’d be proud of his sudden wit and the comebacks if he wasn’t so shocked. If it wasn’t so early. If he wasn’t going so furiously red in the cheeks.
, and more than that.
Valkyr’s real name is Valentin Kyle, right. I think the victim from last night might have been a grandson to someone he killed before. It’s like a freakin’ legacy thing. You said history was repeating itself?”
Dean smirked sort of mischievously, and Cas took it as his invitation to lean in for a kiss. All his anxieties melted away with the soft brush of his lips. This was the man he loved.
”You asked me last time we met about what it is I do. I considered it.” He tilts his head, appraisingly. ”Now I’m answering.”
Big freakin’ sigh.

Dean would choke if he had anything to choke on. Instead he just feels his ears burn red as he scrambles back in his chair, eyes large and embarrassingly startled. Sam laughs behind his hand. Dean silently hates him.
”Life is short,” Dean shrugs, voice hoarse, faking a smile but he’s feeling frustrated. With his wounds showing despite desperate attempts to hide them. With Castiel and how he could think such beautiful things about him. ”And it’s sucky. This business is hard and draining. Who
”Sheesh, one question at a time, little boy. I’ll answer one of them for your pleasure, but please ask more nicely next time.” Slade’s face is distorted with a menacing grin from ear to ear. ”I pulled this trick from up my sleeve, so now I do hope you enjoyed the little show. Very predictable if only you’d paid attention.”
Dean snatches his boxers from the floor - with about as much grace as a buffoon, thanks - to tug them back on, before he musters some strength and rolls underneath the covers of the bed. Seemingly unused, and yet it all smells like Cas; so familiar and nice. He actually smiles secretly to himself.
”Siri,” he started again, ”can you tell Dean, I love him?”
“Stop that.” He says upon entering the room.
"I'm sure he knows what we were doing."
This is what Dean wanted. Cas, just Cas. Holding him, touching him, smelling him, knowing he was real and right here. He kissed Cas' collar bone and Snuggled against him again.
"Huh? No. No I'm not. OK, maybe I was when you exploded my door but I'm not mad at you." Dean tried to explain. Jack watched him waiting for him to elaborate. Moments like this Dean could swear Jack was biologically Cas' kid. He had the stare down perfectly. "I... I wanted to... ughh Jesus." Dean wiped at his face. "Ok, so it's like this; Cas and me, we're... I guess we're together." Dean sighed as he said the words.
[That isn't a meal. Eat a sandwich, or a burrito.]
Dean stops abruptly, “I am not sweet.” he says as he leans in and nips Cas’ ear harder.
"I just... I guess I don't want the kid looking at me like I'm fucking something up..."
It had been days since Cas returned, he made up his mind and he wasn't waiting a second longer. "C'mon Cas." He said as soon as they got in the bunker. Cas looked confused but followed. Dean practically ran through the bunker to his bedroom. He pulled his coat off as he walked in, he turned and closed the door as soon as Cas entered.
"No." Dean looked up. Tears rimmed his eyes.
Jack rinsed his dishes and hid all the evidence of his night time snacking before going back to bed. He walked quietly but stopped suddenly when he heard a strange noise. He listened intently and followed the noise.
"I love you boys."
Dean sighed angrily and threw the sheet off himself. He looked around the room at the mess. "Well fuck." He looked at Cas. Cas gave no input, just stared at Dean. "What?"
“unghh unhh.” Dean says shaking his head as he pulls away leaving Cas searching for warmth and friction. “Not till you say it.” Dean says as he leans in and licks a swipe over the blooming red mark on Cas’ collar bone. Cas tries desperately to pull their hips closer and groans in frustration when Dean pulls further away. “Not till you say it.” Dean continues to tease as he’s sliding a wet thumb harshly over Cas nipple, it flicks back into existence in the cool air of the room and hardens. Cas loses it…
"Uchh..." Dean groaned.
“Shut up”
"It's ok. You're in love and that's why you were making love." Jack smiled at Dean.
Mary covered her smile trying to disguise her amusement and turned to pull Sam into a tight hug.
A completely non-sexual groan escapes Cas throat as he rolls his eyes at Dean’s joke. He ignores the pun and pushes Dean into the mattress and in a matter of seconds he has himself slotted firmly on top of Dean. He rolls his hips against him as captures his mouth in a frenzied Kiss and revels in the contact of the bodies.
Dean covered Cas' hand with his own. He slowly began breathing normal. He looked at Cas and took a deep breath. Before he talked himself out of it again he leaned forward bumped noses with Cas, almost lost his nerve until their lips connected. Cas gasped before leaning into the kiss. His hand found it's way from his chest around the curve of Dean's neck as he pulled him into the kiss and pushed him against the wall and Dean was suddenly thankful for the pizza man.
"Mphhh."
"You're tired." I say as he begins removing my clothes.
"I think I will survive."
"C'mon Jack. We'll figure it out tomorrow." Sam laughed all the way down the hall.
Cas smiled against Dean’s hair, “Baby?” he said as he smiled and ran his hand over Dean’s hair.
"What's wrong?" He heard the panic edging Cas' words.
"Ughh Dean, I'm going to... "
Dean dropped Cas' shoe to floor along with the sock he pulled off before tugging Cas' pants the rest of the way off. "Think you can be quiet?" Dean smirked.
"Ok but I'm not promising anything."
“Want to stay here.” Dean mouths against Cas’ jaw as he tangles their legs together so he can press closer, as close as possible to Cas. A bubble of laughter rumbles through Cas’ chest, surprising himself. He’d nearly forgotten what that felt like too. “What’s funny?” Dean asks as he runs his tongue along Cas’ jaw toward his ear.
Cas laughed as he stumbled off the bed and toward the bathroom. “Hey baby, want to join me?” Cas winked as he walked through the door to the bathroom.
Cas stands at the bottom of the stairs, hand on his cheek smiling.
He pulls me close again.
Dean snuggled against Cas' chest, Cas eventually put his arms around Dean and held him tightly.
“Damn it Dean!” Sam says as Dean tugs Cas into the bathroom and closes the door quickly. He shakes his head and slams the door as he leaves.
"Where did they go? Are they ok?"
Cas lay beneath Dean, his breathing returning to normal as he ran his hands over Dean’s back and back up to his shoulders, simply enjoying the weight on top of him. Dean nuzzled closer against Cas’ neck, his stubble tickling the tender spot on his collar bone. Cas ran his fingers feather-light up Dean’s ribs, Dean shivered at the sensation. “I got to get up, Dean.”
I'm fully undressed as he pulls me to lay down. "The door." I pull away, lock the door and turn the light off.
“I mean it, Dean.” Sam warns as he is about to leave the room.
Sam slides into the passenger seat, he silently buckles his seat belt as Dean turns the car around and pulls onto the road. They travel several minutes in silence before Dean decides it's too quiet and pushes a tape into the tape deck, barely glancing at Sam. Lynard Skynard begins pouring thru the silence, Dean hums along.
"Almost time!" Mary called from the other room.
“Bitch.” Dean mutters as he pulls his clothes from the duffle bag on his bed.
"Yes, we're cool." Jack chuckled.
"What? No. Oh... well... I guess it's complicated. Shit. That sounds stupid." Dean looked away.
"What is the reason?" She eyed him suspiciously.
The new year began with cheering and noise makers screeching. Then kissing. Dean watched Bobby kiss his Mom as she giggled and hugged him. Sam kissed Katie on the cheek, several others kissed. Mary kissed Cas on the cheek and hugged him tight. Dean felt sad and hollow. He turned away and quietly left the celebration. He made it halfway to his room before he stopped and leaned against the wall, his heart was hammering in his chest, he felt like he couldn't breathe. He tried concentrating on breathing slowly in and out.
"You'll be fine. Go." Cas said dismissively.
"I'm telling you for a good reason. Stay outta that hallway."
"Ok..." Jack watched Sam leave.
"Okay." Jack opened his laptop. Dean felt his body untense as he walked away to find his brother and kick his ass.
“Whatever you guys were doing before I walked in.”
"Shut up, Sammy."
"Rain." Dean says. "Digging up a corpse is going to be a bitch."
He approaches me and turns the swivel chair until I face him, he straddles my legs and lets the towel fall away. My hands hold his hips as he leans in and kisses me. His kisses still surprise me. I lose myself every time. He pulls away and I chase the contact. He chuckles and takes my hand, leading me to the bed.
"You can't know that."
"Challenge accepted." Dean whispered against Cas' navel. Cas moaned as he tightened a fist in the sheet. "You're going to lose." Dean said as he licked the full length of Cas' dick. Cas' breathing became erratic as he tried to be quiet. Dean took Cas into his mouth until he touched the back of his throat. He did this several times and watched Cas squirm, he sucked Cas hard until he groaned loudly. He managed a chuckle even with his mouth full of Cas.
"Dude?" Sam finally manages to mutter.
3... 2... 1.
“I appreciate that Cas but I know my brother better than you do and he does not possess your modesty.”
"Yeah, maybe but he doesn't know know..."
“Hey Cas, you ever had a blowjob in the shower?” Dean asks, Cas stares at him wide-eyed.
"But Cas told me the same thing. But he also told me humans sometimes have intercourse just for pleasure even if they don't love each other. But you and Cas love each other, so you were making love." Jack smiled at his own explanation of things and waited for Dean to reply.
Sam lay facing the wall, his breathing mimicking sleep. He could hear the tapping of keys as Dean is texting, Sam assumes it's Cas. He's really got to teach him to change that setting, he thinks as he tries to fall asleep. Finally, the tapping stops, Sam listens. He hears Dean sigh in the darkness and shuffle against the sheets. A few more taps and then it's quiet. A few moments later the room goes completely dark as the light of the phone dims to nothing. Eventually Dean's breathing becomes a light snore followed by Sam's own snores.
Dean's face begins to burn red, he can feel the faint tingle where his lips touched stubble. Oh FUCK, his brain screams. His face remains mute. "I don't know what you're talking about."
"You could have handled that better." Cas sounded  exasperated.
Sam turns in shock. "Huh?"
"You kissed Cas!"
Sam stares in shocked disbelief.
"Fine." Dean had said as he dumped the last of his splintered door in a bin. "Let me take this to the incinerator first."
"Stop saying it like that." Dean was suddenly very uncomfortable. And fuck Sam.
“What?” Dean says as he looks over Cas’ shoulder.
“No.” Dean mumbles as he inches himself closer and rests his head on Cas’ pillow, close enough to breathe the same expanse of air.
“Whatever you say, baby.”
"Like hell!"
"It will be fun."
"Hey jack..." Dean glanced at his brother and nodded towards the kitchen.
"So what are you working on?" Dean stood apprehensively by the edge of the table.
In a darkened room Cas begins to wake, he runs his hand over his face to wipe away the sleep. He stares at the ceiling, even in the dark room he can make out the vague edges of decades old water stains; or what he hopes are water stains. He rolls to his side and searches the bedside table for his phone, the glare of the light making him squint as he tries to read the time; 05:03. He’s grateful for his internal alarm clock as he now notices he never bothered to turn his alarm on last night. He puts the phone back on the table and slides back beneath the warm blankets, he forgot how comfortable beds could be, even in cheap motel rooms. He knows he has to get up soon but the warmth is so consuming, he doesn’t want to leave. He wishes he could stay longer; or forever… forever would be nice. A pang of sadness grips his insides suddenly, causing the breath to seize in his throat for a moment because he knows it can’t happen. Doesn’t stop him from stupidly wishing for it though, masochist all the day long; he thinks.
"I love you." I whisper against his hair.
[We found a room for the night. You ok? Did you eat?]
"Oh..." Dean shuffled nervously and decided sitting would be better. He took Sam's empty seat. He closed Sam's laptop, the quiet click sounded thunderous in the silent room. Jack watched him a moment before closing his own laptop.
"Dean?" Cas placed a hand on his shoulder. "Dean, are you okay?"
"It's already past midnight, I'll get it."
Dean looked away. "Dunno..."
[Good night Dean]
[Goodnight Cas.]
Dean stares at his phone in the dark. Before he loses courage. [♡]
This is when Cas grabs Dean’s Batman apron over the table, and with one sharp pull he suddenly has him mere inches away from his face. Dean’s eyes fall straight on his lips, and the feeling falls straight to his dick. Oh, whoops, fuck it, alright.
it is that makes heat rush down to between his thighs as he tries to think of what to say in response to that. (Preferably something else than
as we are.”
Dean waves him off. ”Gist of it is, you report to me, alright? Which I don’t see you doing so, chop chop, back to work.” He stops yelling across the room - and, ultimately, into various phone calls of the yellow-shirted salespeople - only when he sees the glares that meet him. He points two fingers at them all, eyeing them down. ”That goes for
Dean’s heart is beating dangerously hard. Probably. It should be illegal to be so into someone. “I don’t know if that’s a good idea, Cas,” he murmurs and realises he sounds like he’s using a bedroom voice, low and soft and on the brink of whispering, intoxicated by the infatuation.
Dean Winchester is now taking the very normal bus ride to his very normal daytime job. Howdy.
Cas scowls. ”And what are you doing here? Banging the secretary?”
”Listen,” Thunderbird growls, no more mildness in his rough voice, inching closer to his exposed neck. Dean clenches his jaw, breathing harder. ”I expressed a concern for your well-being and you’ve ignored it. I expect that you will now begin to listen to my words and show me the same respect as I have towards you. Should you keep refraining this,
Dean pretends to consider it. ”What the hell”, he shrugs. “Go for it.”
Dean curls up, a hint of frustration. “Hmpf?”
”Yes,” Cas confirms, ”if you remember so well. So I worry that I won’t be of my most use. But I’ll still try for you.” It doesn’t make any of Dean’s fears subdue; they erupt instead, as sudden as a Jack-in-the-box. Cas, of course, is unphased. ”Let’s go.”
So he grabs Cas’ wrist and places his hand promptly into his short hair, where his fingers curl to a fist and grabs it firmly. Dean grabs his thighs in return, squeezes as if to prompt him to continue, tongue swirling until he settles under the weight of him. Then Cas is bucking into his touch, fucking into his mouth as far as Dean’s mouth can reach without choking.
thing to say. ”They reported me as a light phenomenon, a falling star. A stone was found and it was called a meteor. It tends to happen.”
it. If this is happening, and if it may never happen ever again… because he really must have lucked the fuck out this time and he doesn’t know what the hell he did to deserve it… Then it should be done
Dean feels an ache in his chest as he dreams of taking this searching hand in his.
Thunderbird gives him a look, and Dean almost laughs just because it reminds him of Sam when he gives him an exasperated glare. Yeah, Dean usually coaxes out reactions like that. How, you ask? Talent.
very bad, it feels kind of unbearable. Like he can’t stop staring at his stupidly beautiful face and those blue, blue eyes, only bluer when the colour is brought out like that, wearing that divine suit. His lips, oh his lips, he wants those lips on his body. “As a gift, a thank you. Or, something more than that, but I’m not sure so let’s ignore that for now.”
”What touching?” Cas asks, smirking into the crook of his neck as his hands drop lower from his waist, and Dean sighs for about three different reasons.
But he doesn’t finish his sentence because he merely blinks and then he’s stumbling into his bedroom. It’s as he left it; terrible and untidy, bed sheets wrinkled from uneasy dreams about the man now standing in the middle of it, taking in his environment with deep interest.
, that’s who, because these are very precious things to a man with deep, unruly needs. Castiel wouldn’t have the bleakest understanding of that, but still, Dean kind of wants to rip him apart right now just for fucking with him, and maybe by starting with his clothes. Maybe, just maybe by using his teeth, and lips and tongue and tasting his skin while he does it.
”Yeah. Gross.” Sam pulled a face which Dean had previously described to Castiel to be his
, because someone’s out there killing random high-up business guys and they can’t seem to get on top of the game, can’t seem to figure it out with the clues at hand, can’t seem to get to the point when they can start kicking bad guy ass. And kicking bad guy ass is Dean’s favorite pastime hobby. He gets very grumpy when he doesn’t get to do it. And also when he involuntarily gets a partner in crime-fighting, but, you know. Life has a habit of kicking you when you’re down.
Dean chuckles. “Oh, you’re just jealous.”
and wasn’t even half-conscious doing it?”
He gets a shock and a half when it’s Castiel that walks out.
”Bitch-” he quips on instinct and nearly grabs his junk just for emphasis.
”You’re kind of cute when you’re flustered.”
Castiel looks calmly at him, standing tall in front of him. ”Hello, Demonblade.”
Dean thinks of the midnight blue suit on the bus. Icy eyes. Electric. Is this the life Castiel chose over crime fighting? Had he tried to retire? Or did the newcomers - like Dean - simply take his spot?
So after a minor internal crisis, he shrugs half-assedly, and eventually follows him.
”Not quite, but I’m getting gradually better at reading people.”

Dean feels lucky. Out of this world kind of lucky. ”Thanks, sunshine,” he murmurs back, and dials the pizza place. ”And I’m getting you back for the teasing later.”

here.”
“You should specify the conditions,” Castiel answers, despite it all. “I don’t know what you’re asking of me.”
that.”
Dean’s tummy squirms in ways it shouldn’t. He looks over his shoulder at Castiel studying the newspaper, sideways. He shakes his head and looks back ahead, because it’s way too early for unholy thoughts and irresponsible boners and questioning if you have a crush on your best friend, oh my god. Save that for 10AM at the very least.
”And he’s not a female dog,” Thunderbird adds offhandedly to Dean’s preference in curse words.
; Dean wouldn’t expect anyone to wear one since the 80’s or something, kind of like the box of stuff he inherited from his dad when he passed away, the one he snagged his own favorite everyday-wear leather jacket out of. (That box was one of the few things his dad ever gave to him. Apart from, of course, a small inheritance that allowed him and Sam to start doing what it is they do, with a nice side of emotional neglect, and some childhood trauma to-go. So at least there’s that.)
Then his phone rings.
”Or figure yourself out,” Sam fills in, eyes on the pages, ”like what am I gonna do? What am I gonna be?”
He’s an angel. A celestial being. A thing from fairytales. Dean saw a ghost, he fought a ghost, the angel stabbed a ghost.
”Hm? This is just
The murderer puts on a fake coy expression. ”Is this when I have my grandiose villain explanation moment?”
Right, okay, because it’s totally just the
”Right. So…” Dean pursed his lips momentarily, like he considered his options. “Can we make up now?”
”Yeah, hell yeah, go on. Fuck me like you want to.” Dean rakes one hand down his back until he can cup his ass, drawing him in, watching as those eyes go darker. ”You know I want it too. Don’t stop until I tell you to.”
right here, huh.”
Dean sneers, the inner movie nerd seeping through, which is a very unfortunate trait about him. His heart is beating harder at their proximity; the promises this kind of proximity binds. ”You’ve gotta be bleeding on a rooftop for that, man. I’d say you have to be a
”Thank you”, Castiel replies, and his lips connect hotly to his neck as he kisses all the bared skin with Dean’s head tipped back, and Dean arches his hips up, trying so hard to get more friction.
But Sam
”How rude of you, Demonblade. You’re in my house and don’t even know to thank me.”

He sighs plaintively, tips his head back. No stars in the city; the lights down here too bright to let them shine. It’s all a black-draped canvas in the sky. As above, so below, because down here below sits Dean, and Dean feels like shit.
”That maybe I was stationed here. I don’t have any memory still, but. It’s like something tells me I’m wrong. That I can’t possibly have fallen. It’s a fall from
“God, Cas,” Dean whispers and has to put the pot away so he won’t actually lose his brain and let it smash. (Pot or brain? Both, definitely both.) “I had no idea you’d be here, I… I swear I’m not a stalker.”
Cas’ body trembles as Dean watches with marvel the way he twitches in his hand before he comes over his fist. He kind of wants to lick his hand after that. Somehow, his senses get the better of him and he doesn’t (but he wonders how much of a good boy that would have made him).
He grins back at Thunderbird who’s watching him intently, still that hint of a smile playing on his lips.
Dean looked at him in such a way, as if he’d just caressed his cheek, gentle and affectionate; eyelashes fluttering as his face softened into a crooked smile. ”Cas, I—”
Oh sweet baby Jesus on a bicycle, he is so
”Thank you.” Castiel pulled a chair and sat down heavily opposite him, hands conspiracal in front of him on the table. ”I need your help. Dean thinks I love another man.”
him right now.
Dean ignores him and, almost menacingly, decides to
by ZZ Top, because Dean’s daily life is basically a playlist and he could have definitely imagined it.
The best thing, though, is the people. The safe set of arms to embrace him when he comes home. He never knew he’d been so lonely until he got all he could have ever wanted.
Castiel attempted a smile. That did sound promising. He had watched a few before, like the one when a man (who Sam had said looked like Cas) became prime minister of England and had affectionate feelings for the secretary, so in the end they kissed in the backside of a theater but a curtain fell and everyone saw. Something else happened in the middle there. And it wasn’t very relevant to the current situation. And Cas wasn’t a prime minister and Dean wasn’t a secretary, but it ended with a kiss, so that was very much correlated to Castiel’s end goal. In conclusion, Sam was very trust-worthy with this matter.
”Okay, you know what.” Sam took the phone and put it away into his pocket. ”You’re banned from that. No more texting, young man.”
”God, you

”Feels fucking good, man,” Dean chokes out. ”God,
He’s about to ask if Castiel just healed his itsy bitsy, achey breakey heart from all the misery and hate it previously contained or something, filled it with only the love he has for him, but.
you were!”
And what a hassle it is. Human emotions, bodies and clothing must be one hell of a conundrum. Tricky, like shower sex, like who goes where and oh I’m slipping. Dean grins.
”Figured.” Dean sighs. ”Hm.”
”I never hauled ass,” Thunderbird replies seriously. ”I flew.”
“Oh… hey.” Dean chuckles, sleepy and content. His voice is a little sluggish, like when he’s had too many beers to numb whatever was occupying his mind. “Hey, Cas. Whatcha doing? Here… Wanna do something? Heh.”
He nods in response to when Dean looks up at him in silent disbelief; it’s still true. It really is still true.
”I’m aware of the concept. Roughly. We may dance if you wish to teach me how.”
He heads grumpily towards the stairs, because he’s not taking the lift down to the garage, where Baby is patiently waiting. Not tonight. Not if it’s going to stop again.
They get the new place within sight, which becomes evident by how the other man slows to a stop before they have time to exit the alley they’re crossing. Thunderbird squints at the place. This time it’s lit up and seems very much in use, for a change.
Dean hums and turns around to yawn silently. Bedtime doesn’t sound all too terrible right about now. It’s Saturday anyway so it’s not like he has anywhere to be. Might just fuel himself by sizzling up some fried up eggs first, since Sammy already had his breakfast, that fucking… avocado on toast with lawnmower clippings on top, which he swears are

closing in on them.
Dean purses his lips and creases his brow. He didn’t attend a lot of history lessons.
And, so what, if every single night together is their possible last one on Earth? Totally doesn’t mean it should be an excuse to take a midnight trip to a motel and bang, just for the hell of it, one last hurrah. Hide the anxiety in the friction between cotton and latex, gasps and whimpers, hard and mellow. No, totally, this is purely professional now. No matter how much Dean wants to.
Dean, in turn, earns a bonus: he gets to keep stealing glances of his ass.
Despite it all, Dean laughs, blinking at the white spots dancing in front of his eyes from the iPhone flash in the night. It’s all that euphoria, man. He feels high on nothing.
That’s evil, pure evil. (And his dick is irresponsible and needs a good talking about the house rules, he thinks, pretty deliriously, thanks very fucking much.)
Castiel flinched away from his phone, eyes wide. ”Wait, no.
Like he just hit the point of asphyxiation that sends him swimming through pleasure. Like he’s been trembling against ropes on his wrists and surrendering control to whoever is in front of him. Like Thunderbird could just lean in right now and slot a toned thigh between his legs and pin his arms above his head and Dean would just
Shit.
Dean mouths for more words, but none come out. Cas is already out the door with headphones in by the time he gives up, resorting to just nodding his silent thanks. He decides to bail. Fast.
Cas purses his lips in Dean’s peripheral, deep in thought. ”So,” he starts, and Dean squares his shoulders, ”the bi thing…”
”Then what’s yours, superboy? Why do you fight crime?” Dean snaps his head back to him and Slade casually waves his hand as he explains. ”Hero syndrome?
This just raised a lot of new questions.
They reach a door that resembles a vault at the end of the corridor which Thunderbird - Dean swears - opens by just pushing his hand out in front of himself. No touchy. No feely. Just Dean silently gawking as it slowly swings open, to reveal...
He turns back around and Dean is left there, blinking and mouthing
kind of expression with his hand, and face. “Yes?”
Dean wets his lips, watching him intently. “Sounds good.”
“I bet you could take us to my bedroom in a heartbeat,” Dean says and something flashes over Cas’ eyes. “Well, still no, I don’t
Sam hums. He starts tapping at his computer. Dean sinks into the other chair and lets his eyes close for a moment, secretly. His eyelids feel very heavy all of a sudden.
Either way, it was a month ago they met that fateful night, so that’s basically it. That’s the story so far. And now, the weirdo with the black mask across his Dean-piercing  and oh-so-devastatingly-blue eyes is joining him again for the night’s entertainment, the fabulous investigation which is nothing short of...
Dean huffs as he buckles himself back in as well. ”Yeah, well. See me Monday about that and maybe we can schedule you a private meeting.”
He’ll blame it on the rain starting to drop, the way his eyes are tearing up again. He’ll blame whoever started this shit for putting them into this piss poor situation, and he’ll be sure to track them down and ruin their life for good.
(If only Dean could have scolded him using his full name right there at the table, like woah, that’s when it means danger and consequence to follow
And the leather jacket - which he loves to death despite its tears and unconventional stitchwork - is weighing heavy on him, dragging down into the bruised skin. It’s reminding him he possibly cracked a rib and probably should have that checked out in the nearest future. See, Dean is no stranger to kinky sex involving all kinds of slapping and biting and him tied to a bedpost, but when it’s been done against his
Oh, goddamn fucking shit.
”But. That’s—”
He’s immediately bolting upright and grabbing for it, because if someone calls it’s always Sam, because he doesn’t have anyone but Sam, and with Sam it’s almost always trouble.
”Alrighty,” Dean offers to his scrutinizing facial expression, ”let’s cut to the chase. I’m guessing we’re partners now.”
He memorizes that word - Enochian - and tries not to dwell on details. Tries.
when he pulls the zip down swiftly and his hand disappears below his boxers, but doesn’t help Dean regain any sanity whatsoever.
”The point, bud?”
so Sam should be so freakin’
Sam clicks into his laptop, the screensaver being the logo of the university he graduated from last year. Such a nerd. ”Did he know anything about why it happened?”
Though, since Castiel didn’t perfectly understand iPhones, he also, consequently, did not understand the tiny woman who now lived in his phone bearing the name of Siri.
”Dean?”
they put up with each other’s shit through thick and thin, for years on end, always coming back to one another. He could admit that was the rough draft of what he just said. And well, yes, maybe they watched movies together under a blanket in Dean’s room, laptop open, world forgotten which meant that,
Thunderbird fixes him with a glare. ”I assume you will comply with the conditions,” he rasps eventually.
Dean may suck at math but Slade should definitely be around 70 years old if he had a
”All those... moments,” Dean quotes with gusto from the infamous ending scene, choking on the words for dramatic effect, ”will be lost in time, like
“Nah,” Dean says quietly with a small grin, trying hard to recover from how much his face burns and how his heart definitely burns with it, ”that’s when that stuff should be all figured out. Should be good to go around 30 maybe. Depends.”
”Condom,” Dean reminds him breezily and Cas stops, fumbles some more. ”Good boy.”
So. The power’s out.
to you, so now I have to save
He kind of can’t repress the grin that’s spread across his face. ”Damn, alright. Do what you want. You’re the boss.”
So! Thoughts on the chapter? Questions, comments, concerns?
“Alec...shut up. We'll mate when we want and have a pup if we want. Now butt the fuck out.”
“Keep your panties on, Red. I'm a professional.”
"Well, it didn't take much convincing since my unit is held in high regard."
"We just had the best set in the history of us and I have to leave? There are after parties screaming my name..."
He felt Cas' lips between his shoulder blades. "You awake?" Cas asked, voice still thick with sleep. Dean rolled on to his back, finding those breathtaking electric blue eyes. "Yeah." He moved to kiss his forehead. "Hell of a party." He added with a smile. Cas chuckled. "I never go anywhere without making myself known."
“Yeah, wouldn't want to make it too obvious that we didn't mate.”
It had been two weeks since Cas moved. His parents wouldn't allow him to talk to Dean because of the run away incident. There was one time Cas snuck a phone call which he was still grounded for. They definitely put the foot down after that, saying Dean would still somehow be a bad influence on Cas.
"Uh, yeah," Dean said, clearing his throat. "I'm great, it's just..." he huffed a laugh. "Guess I'll just be honest. You have beautiful eyes."
"No son, it's not."
"It's not him. Can't be him..." Castiel said to himself as he watched the farmhand. The man looked up, revealing green eyes and sandy hair.
"Fucked up? You have no idea."
“Omega 1019! Back to your room!” A Beta commanded him.
Cas nodded then kissed him. "Well, it seems like everyone is awake so let's get downstairs."
Crowley left them alone for a short time. Cas and RJ were leading with a short ways to go when Crowley came up next to them again. He saw Crowley shift in his seat, sending Little Demon nearly into RJ. Cas heeled RJ on, pulling ahead again. And then Cas felt a stinging pain on his thigh. He bit his lip and pressed forward.
Nothing.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Nice to meet you too Dean."
Cas stepped the rest of the way into the house. He turned stone faced Charlie, hands on his hips.
"Watch it kid."
You say, "Just come back to bed"
“Dean...”
He got up and went to the kitchen and made himself some eggs and toast. When he turned to go sit at the table, he saw green looking back at him.
"So Dean got upset when you told him about the tattoo?" Cas asked. "Very." John replied. "To be honest, I got upset as well when my mom told me. For a long time, I though I would never see Dean again. I came back here looking for him when I heard someone say he was going to school at the University of Michigan. So I went back. I heard about a soul mate party going on at the University and took a chance. I didn't even recognize him. I should have known he would come looking for me."
"Damn right, I am." Dean pushed past the remaining workers and climbed into the back of the ambulance, sitting on the bench next to Cas. The whole ride they continued to work on Cas. The only thing Dean could do was hold Cas' hand.
“Cas, where are you going?” Benny asked.
He pushed his guitar behind him and singing and clapping with the crowd that followed him.
'I'll be there in 45.'
The shook hands. Meg flipped her long dark hair to the side. "Think we'll need to write anything important?" She asked Dean shrugged. She pulled out a Mac Book from her bag. Dean laughed. "Couldn't hurt right?" She winked.
Dean bit his lip. "No. I got in his face and yelled at him."
“You’re not the only one who has had other partners, Dean. I may have had a few more...adventurous ones than you.”
"A member of Dean's unit refused to leave him behind. After they pushed back the Germans, they went back for Dean but he was gone. You should know, when they left him, he was alive. We think he's now a prisoner of war and he's been classified as missing in action. We'll find your brother and bring him home." Nobody said anything after he left. Cas slid down the wall and sat on the floor. He couldn't move or think. Dean was missing and half dead.
"Here, Dean; I'll get ya."
Cas put on a fedora and looked at himself in the mirror, fixing his skinny white tie and straightened his vest
Stutter by Marianas Trench  (written as JTH only part of the song.)
The light kept blinking. He reached for the phone. Cas bit his lip. "I'm going going to hate myself for this," he thought.
Benny started to herd the friends out. "C'mon y'all, let's let them have their morning. Move it."
It was now June and two days before the wedding. They were trying on their tuxedos to see how they fit after the adjustments. Cas grabbed his suit. Dean walked over and kissed him. "Better hurry. Rehearsal dinner is in an hour." Cas groaned. "Can we just elope? Weddings are hard work." Dean laughed. "Come on, it's not that bad." Cas turned to him. "Have you heard my father's stories? One story takes an hour to tell." Dean smiled at him. "You'll live. At least you're getting along." Cas rolled his eyes. "Yeah, my mom was thrilled."
"What? You were drooling." He rolled his eyes as she sat down. "And who are we drooling over today?" She followed his eyes.
"My dad had me working on cars as soon as I graduated. I don't want to do that the rest of my life."
“I don't think that'll happen to you. I mean to an extent, yeah you'll be more protective of your mate.”
"See? She thinks I'm awesome."
"This...this is a dream isn't it?"
He drove for a few minutes, then stopped at Starbucks, cutting the engine. He took off his helmet and rubbed the top of his head.
"Oh it's good alright. Pick you up at seven Clarence!"
"You have no clue how we speak to him. We can speak to him however we want. We are his parents. We know what's best for him." She shot at him. Dean turned to her. "And I don't? Is that it?" Cas took a step forward, Dean motioned for him to stay put. "No Dean. You don't. All his life Castiel has needed someone to hold his hand and baby him-"
"Do you go to Lawrence High?"
"Nope. Especially not after we just, ya know... blew it all over this room." They stepped out of the booth, still pulling their clothes back on. Cas watched as Dean's tshirt fell over his muscled frame. He walked over to Dean and kissed him. "Do you have to leave tomorrow?"
"Dean... I'm..." Cas couldn't get the words out.
Cas’ phone vibrated in the passenger seat. He let out an exasperated breath as he picked up the phone and answered the call.
Cas lead the group inside, linking arms with Dean. They arrived at the hostess desk, where a pretty girl asked for the name of the party. "Novak."
"Cas...you're going to your bed and I'm going to mine."
“I just stopped by to tell you Khali and I just got back from our honeymoon. We eloped in Vegas and then stayed for the fun part. Much less complicated than having to do all the work here at home."
Dean finished his work a little earlier than expected. He walked into the mud room and kicked his boots off. He looked down at his clothes; he was caked with dirt and Lord knew what else. He put his hands on his hips and thought for a second before cracking open the door to the house.
You should know me
"I'm also going to assume you need a place to stay. I'll let you on two conditions. Get a job, and no more get rich schemes."
We're looking for something dumb to do
Tears streamed down his face. He threw his phone across the room.
“That's way to early.”
Charlie met up with Meg and the four walked to the mess hall. They were met by Sam, Alec, Benny, Andrea, Bobby, and Ellen. They all got in line and grabbed their food, taking their usual seats at their usual table. Cas came to enjoy the routine.
The group was chatting when Dean walked in. "I see the band's back together."
"I look weird." He said as he met his mom at the bottom of the stairs. "You look amazing." She kissed her son on the forehead. "Dean will be here soon." Cas exhaled. The doorbell rang.
"Most expensive piece of paper ever."
“That's horrible.”
Now I wake up and I forget that you were gone
"Bad one. He even passed out. Surprised you know that."
When he got back, Dean was feeding Pandora. Castiel hopped off RJ and led him back to his stall. "See you found RJ. How's he ride?" Dean patted the horse as they passed. "Faster than River. Why didn't you tell me River shacked up with another Appaloosa?"
"Dean..."
“Castiel James. Time to go.” Cas looked back at his dad and then back at Dean. “Guess I’m going.”
"You're..."
"Tutoring? Castiel? Ha! I don't see how! This boy is dumber than his mama!"
His phone vibrated a few seconds later.
"Miss you too, love."
“Hey, cowboy…”
Dean looked at him. "Good. Really good." The man sat behind his oak desk. "How's school going?" He grabbed a pen and a pad of paper.
“We have a huge problem!” She didn't even explain, she just ran out the door. Dean followed her and everyone followed Dean. Meg led them past the fence through the woods. She stopped about a hundred yards from the field Dean and Cas ran through when they first got here.
Dean sighed, squeezing his eyes shut and pinching the bridge of his nose. “I know you can Cas.”
Cas coughed. "I'd hate to see you ecstatic then."
"That's just..."
"Nope." He took another sip of coffee.
"Nah, it's like riding a bike, you never forget how." Cas rolled his eyes and continued swinging. Dean had a different idea. He grabbed some snow and packed it into a ball, throwing it at Cas. It hit him right in the chest. Cas stopped swinging and looked a Dean who was now doubled over in laughter. Cas got off the swing and made a snowball of his own. "What are you laughing at?" He threw it, hitting Dean in his abdomen. Now Cas was laughing.
Cas rolls his eyes. Momentarily looks for an eye roll emoji. Sends a popcorn emoji.
Dean has a death grip on the steering wheel. If it wasn't for Lynard Skynard the silence would be deafening.
"God, I missed you." He whispered as he bumped his forehead against Dean's.
“Almost time for work.” Cas answers as he turns to face the owner of the arms wrapped around him.
I grab his bag and followed him through the bunker. We part ways as I stop in the kitchen. I grab two beers before stopping in the library to let Sam know how the hunt went. We exchange a few words before I leave.  Familiarity leads me to his bedroom.
"Jack! Are you okay?" Sam yelled as he ran towards him, gun in the air. "What happened!" Sam looked at the remnants of the exploded door before his eyes landed on his brother struggling to keep a sheet around himself and Cas sat on the bed naked holding a pillow. Sam burst into hysterics and put his hand on Jack's shoulder to hold himself up. "Back to bed Jack. I think they need some privacy."
“Nah, I’m not picky.” Dean replies as he crosses the room.
"Jack?" Cas yelped.
"Dean." Cas placed a hand over his heart. "Your heart..."
“Unhunhh.” Dean mumbles against Cas’ mouth as he puts a hand on his cheek and pulls him back into the kiss. Cas moans into it as he turns his body fully so he is flush against Dean.
Dean kisses back as he matches Cas’ movements. “You going to keep humping my leg or you going to let me fuck you?”
Eventually Sam turns away and stares out the window and Dean loosens his grip on the steering wheel. Miles turn into hours. At some point Dean had switched over to the radio that was now broadcasting the weather.
He wears only a towel as he enters the room. He crosses the room and takes a drink of the beer.
Dean knew what Cas was trying to say, it encouraged him to move faster and suck harder. Cas would have been very loud if he hadn't pulled Dean's pillow over his face to muffle himself. Dean swallowed everything down as he listened to Cas moan and felt his body go limp beneath him.
He shifts his body on top of me, rutting against me. All I can do is hold on and kiss him. His hand has made it's way between us, he holds both our erections. I'm losing myself in the motion. He growls against my throat before biting and sucking hard against the soft flesh. That pushes me over. I feel the warm wetness against my stomach, he groans and I can feel his release join my own.
9.06 MISSING SCENE
Dean stared at Jack and waited for the room to swallow him whole but that didn't happen. "Ok, change of subject. I just want to make sure you're okay with everything... me and Cas, you know."
Dean slams his hand onto the horn of the impala. "C'mon Sammy! I thought you were in a hurry?"
"Ahhh, ahhh.... Oh god!" Jack heard through the door.
"Wanna hold you." He unbuttons my pants. I kick my shoes off.
"Why is Sam stomping down the hall?" Cas looked down at Dean and asked.
"Stick to the microwave."
Cas smiled back, "Think you can?"
"Fucking?" Cas mocked him.
"Ughh." Sam groans as he looks out the window and up at the sky. He counted on this being an easy job. "Let's hope it's a mausoleum."
Jack stood in shock and confusion as he stared at the scene in front of him. Before he could speak another shout distracted him.
Dean sighed. "Okay." He wiped his hands on his jeans and brushed the wood chips off his shirt. "I'll just... yeah..." He pointed towards the library.
"Your turn." Cas whispered.
"Just drop it, Sam."
"Dean, C'mon!" Sam yells from the top of the stairs.
"Alright see you when we get back." He says as Cas follows him to the stairs.
“Pfft, you’re not the boss of me.”
“We weren’t doing anything.” Dean says taking a step back from Cas.
He lays under the blankets, threatening sleep any second. He pulls me close as I lay down. He reaches over me to turn off the lamp. The room is bathed in darkness, my eyes adjust quickly. He kisses every part of my face.
"Mmm, missed you, mmm all of you." Dean mumbled against chapped lips. He pulled at the crooked tie and cursed the buttons of the stark white shirt. Cas began returning the ministrations as he yanked Dean's t-shirt and overshirt over his head and corralled him towards the bed. Dean landed with an "oomph" against the memory foam, he quickly sank into the bed with Cas' weight on top of him.
“Like this?” Dean questions as he tugs Cas’ earlobe between his teeth.
"Really?"
Dean finally met Cas' gaze. "What?" He spoke through clenched teeth.
Sam had pretended to not hear or notice his brother and the angel leave the garage together. Instead he grabbed their bags and went the opposite direction. He made it all the way to the kitchen before Jack caught up with him.
"Privacy! I don't have a fucking door!" Dean argued.
Before Cas could speak, he was being pushed against the door. His head made contact with the hardwood, he grunted at the opposing sensations of pain and pleasure when his lips met Dean's. Pain forgotten as a warm slick tongue slid over his teeth and into his mouth. It felt... It felt. He could feel. His head was becoming light and tingly. He pushed back against Dean, giving back the amazing sensation of lips and tongues. After days... Weeks... How long had it been? An eternity in the empty? This was too much and not enough. Cas was grasping at Dean, touching whatever he could touch, everything he could finally touch.
“Yeah right.” Sam pulls his jacket on.
"Dean..."
Dean stood at the door reluctant to open it, Cas came up next to him. He saw the weariness on Dean’s face, the faint lines that had once been cute on his youthful face now making him look older, tired. Cas placed a hand on his shoulder and pulled Dean into one last hug, he held him tight and breathed in his scent that was now colored by cheap motel soap. He peppered Dean’s face with kisses before kissing him on the mouth.
“Say it.” Dean demands. “Say I’m not sweet.” He bites a trail down Cas’ throat to his collar before biting hard and sucking the delicate flesh into his mouth.
"Am now." He shushes me and kisses just below my ear.
"Let's wait a minute."
"Thanks." He tips the bottle back and takes another long drink.
"WHAT THE FUCK!" Dean yelled.
Dean rolled his eyes knowing that his slip-up would never be forgotten. He rolled out of the bed and followed Cas into the bathroom anyway, intent on making him pay for the teasing.
“ohhhmmmhhhh.” Cas moans as his erection begins to swell.
