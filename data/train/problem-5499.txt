Tony glanced at her, on his stomach, face pressed into a pillow. "Funnily enough, I'm always in this position when I'm in bed with you. Last time, when we made a baby, I remember landing like this, next to you, but there was at least a smile on both of our faces." He snorted softly, then brought his arms up to pillow his head on. "I'm going to assume that No one else has measured up to me in bed, because my ego demands it." Tony turned his head the other way, glancing at tablet on the bedside stand, but not moving to grab it. "I know why you didn't want to sleep with me again, because you got together with Agent, and I totally understand. The one time we slept together we had Peter. And while I could have a hundred Peter's, none of them would be as awesome as our little boy, and man would your body hate me. It's obvious that my body is just that awesome, pregnant in one."
“Yeah, with that new little spitfire over there,” Julie said with a nod towards Jamie, who seemed to be drawing in the applesauce that was on the tray of her high chair now. Steve had given up and had a towel in his hand for when she was done.
I will be see Civil War on Friday, but like the tags say, there is no Civil War here, it doesn't exist. But there will be no spoilers in the upcoming chapters. Only way I'll use something might be int he way of non-spoilery fight scenes.
Bucky narrowed his eyes a little at Steve, and Steve fought to keep a smirk down. That looks was pure Bucky, the Bucky from the Thirties and Forties that Steve had grown up with. That look said that Steve was a dirty cheat for using logic against him.
“You think maybe later Mr Steve can come down?” Wade asked softly, looking back down towards the floor. “I gotta thank him about yesterday….”
"Yeah." Mary came out of the room, a keychain in her hand, and came up next to Steve. "He just turned five last month, just before you woke up. That's my Peter." Steve noticed the smile on her face as she looked at the pictures. "That picture," she pointed to the one Steve was just looking at, "was taken the night of his birthday. That's his Dad, and it's where he's at right now. I might actually be able to clean this place up before I pick up him, too."
Tony glanced over to the door, seeing Mary's parents walking in, tears in Rachel's eyes. "I'm awake now, baby boy," Mary said quietly, her own tears trailing down her cheeks. No one could resist an upset, crying child, it was like a punch to the gut. "I'm awake, I'm not going anywhere. I love you so much, Peter." Peter had tried to make himself as small as possible to fit entirely in Mary's arms, soft sniffles sounding as he held on for all he was worth.
“Tony?” Steve said softly, shuffling on his knees a little closer. Tony surged forward, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck, not letting his hands touch. His face pushed into Steve’s neck and he bit his lip as Steve wrapped his own arms around him. “I think I saw your dream.” Tony squeezed his eyes shut at Steve’s words. “Was that-“
Hey everyone! Yo, things are crazy in the world right now. I've gone throuhg a job change (as I'm sure many other people have), and right now I'm in training for a new position. (I was lucky enoguh that my company handles many contracts and found room for those of us that had to get moved.) So, here I am with an update! And I'm do old fashioned pen and paper to start on more. There's one more chapter after this before the start of Proof of Existance. And this will continue with some in between chapters after that! Get ready ladies nad gents and everything in between!
Tuesday, you can looking forward to a fluff scene. I mean, it's kind of short, but it's Diabetes inducing, or something. I cried tears of sugar while writing it.
Bucky growled and took a stepped after her, but stopped when he saw Peter and Wade walking over to him. She was right, he needed to get them back to the Tower. There was no telling how many eyes were watching them now, not if the woman that Tony had his systems searching for was able to waltz within ten feet of his son. Tony’s theory was confirmed about her knowing Wade’s father though, and that didn’t sit well with him.
"Happy Birthday, Daddy!" Peter exclaimed as they walked in, big grin on his face, along with some flour on his cheeks. Tony smiled at him, going over and swinging him up into his arms, dropping kisses all over his face, making Peter giggle.
“And to have Wade pick out some furniture?” Steve asked knowingly as he grabbed a little bowl of goldfish crackers. Jamie made a squeak and reached for them immediately.
"It just has to be something that you care about," Steve said not unkindly, and Tony shrugged a little.
“Ah, about how it was crashed, and how a certain Star Spangled Man showed up?” He shot a look her way, one that wanted to be angry and betrayed, but just couldn’t get there. He understood why she kept it a secret, and he really wasn’t hurt about it anymore, but he still wanted some kind of explanation.
"Yeah, we can stay- ack." Tony was pushed back into the couch when Peter landed in his lap, arms around his neck in a hug suddenly. He swore he heard a little chuckled from The Neighbor. "But I have to run home at some point to get my clothes, okay?"
Steve had asked about Peter right away, and Coulson assured him that he was safe with Tony, and that Tony wouldn't let the boy out of his sights. Tony had wanted to move Mary to his house, to have round the clock care for her, and Steve for once couldn't be upset with the man. It's what he would have wanted to do, especially if he had the resources that Stark did. Steve honestly didn't expect to see Tony coming aboard the Hellicarrier after this revelation.
, Tony, and no one can replace that. Of course I'll still come to you with stuff, that's how co-parenting works." She started to rub his shoulder, briefly reminding of comforting Peter. Too much alike. "And you know that I would never make any of the big decisions without you."
"Sir!" Jarvis called out, muting the lines, startling Tony for a second. "Mrs Parker is on your line."
"I'm not the man you're looking for," he told Steve, taking a small step backwards. "I'm not that man you remember."
“She likes to have fun,” Wade mumbled suddenly, making Steve jump a little. “She’s not so bad, for a baby, and she likes it when we teach her stuff.”
"No!" Tony shouted, growling. "You won't touch him!" He had left the voices in the wormhole, had left it all behind, he made sure that Peter would be safe! "I won't let you!"
"Open your presents, it's Christmas Eve, you've earned it," Steve said as he buttoned up the vest, then sat down to pull on the dress socks.
"How bad is it?" Fury asked Hill as soon as they were within earshot, the three of them moving up the stairs and inside of the facility.
Tony narrowed his eyes at the taller man, then wound back and threw a punch straight at his face. Loki hadn’t seen it coming and jerked back from the hit, eyes widening a little bit. “This is your fault, you asshole! You undo what you’ve done right now!”
"Missed you more." Tony yawned, and stretched out his body, before turning more fully towards Steve. "What are you doing here so late? Thought you couldn't find an excuse to come back yet."
Steve gently crawled into the bed next to Tony, but the motion woke the genius anyway. He looked around, eyes moving quickly as they scanned, before Tony caught sight of him. He visibly relaxed and offered an almost shy smile. "Hey, handsome," he said with a sleep laced voice.
“She’s just worried,” Steve told him as he nodded. “What you went through is something that not even an adult should have to go through. She’s not the only one, but we just want to make sure that you know you can talk to anyone about it. It’s a huge thing.”
"Is his father dating anyone?" Steve couldn't help but want to know more about this man, to know if he was doing the right thing by Mary. Things must have changed if they were able to raise a child and not live together, or even get married, but there was still such a thing as having honor.
"You got it, Soldier." Steve grinned at him. "Can you believe that Rachel said we'd be a good couple?? I think she's starting to like me!"
While Tony wasn't that much older than him, he had done so much more, and had actually been able to live. Shit, what was Tony thinking, why was Steve Rogers giving him a pep talk? This kid had had to grow up way to fast, at much too young an age, even before becoming Captain America. Tony couldn't trap him in any kind of relationship with him, he was too messed up for that.
"The song sounded a little familiar." Steve had gotten off of his motorcycle, pushing his sunglasses on the top of his head. They were both in the parking lot of a little restaurant, a hole in the wall really, but when Steve had asked for a place to eat this place had come up the most. "I think I have that song, or something similar at least, on my playlist."
"Stop." The raspy voice caught the attention of both men. Bucky let Steve go, but didn't move away, keeping him crowded against the wall. "This is why neither of you will babysit Conor, don't need him having the wrong male influences."
"I felt ridiculously better when I first heard that," Steve admitted to the Doctor. He glanced back at Jamie. "I was thinking about a November birthday for her," he said suddenly.
Tony was on his back on the bed, pillow under his head. His chest still moved at an even pace, almost looking as if he were merely just asleep. Dark circles under his eyes stood out even more, and his expressions reeked of restlessness. “Whoever has his mind is currently trying to get to him, again. At least that’s how it was explained to me. A third party has intervened, and we think that it’s trying to help him, but it’s like he’s been pulled from his body.”
"The Avengers?" Peter asked with a smile. He found the prospect of living with superheroes exciting, since his Daddy was a superhero.
Steve had been a little awed by the size of the mansion, and all the rooms that it had. But, he also thought that each floor in the Tower was too big for just him, and when Tony had shown him the blueprints for the Penthouse remodel, he thought they would have too much room. Steve didn’t stop him, just smiled and shook his head, understanding that that was how Tony grew up, and it was how he was used to living. Plus, Steve was really looking forward to the Art room.
"Jamie," Steve said with a smile on his face. "I'm going to name you Jamie. I don't have a middle name for you yet, but, to be fair, you did surprise me." There was a soft knock at Steve's bedroom door and he felt Tony getting up to go answer it. "Named you after my best friend, a guy I know always has my back. I'm gonna try and do right by you, okay?" Her mouth opened and she gave what Steve considered to be an impressive yawn. "So now you're finally tired, huh? You have all that excitement and barely react, but I tell you your name, and you're ready to sack out on me?"
Tony got up, the little kitchen not hard to find. "You use a bottle? Not the, whole," he motioned to his chest, and Mary just raised an eyebrow. "You know, how most mothers do it? Feed the baby?"
"I actually almost bought it, hook, line, and sinker," she continued, and now Mary was leaning out to get a look at this woman.
"No one except for the one who created it," Steve muttered as he paused the song. Tony had sent him a text when he updated the Map app with a suggested course across the country, so he knew that Tony could access his phone from New York. "Really, Tony?"
“You’re going to be waiting a much longer time!” Tony called out as they disappeared down the hall. Mary turned her head to look at him as they walked into Peter’s bedroom. “I’m really not in the mood to deal with Strange right now. I’m not thrilled that he showed up unannounced, and on Peter’s birthday.”
"Nope," she popped the P. "Unless you count the few times that I've sand a solo in High School. And I don't, because I had to stare at the Exit signs above the heads and still try to look natural while singing. That shit is nerve wracking!"
Pepper pulled out her Starkpad. "What position do I need to secure?" She asked simply. Steve turned a confused expression to her, then back over to Tony.
Tony tapped on Rhodey's helmet, thanking Agent Romanoff for rebooting War Machine's suit. Jarvis assured him that Coulson was still with Peter, and Bruce was still at the Manor, and so Tony just needed to get rid of this Vanko, again, and he could go home. He'd take Peter to the Tower, to show him, to hopefully distract him from what he hoped he hadn't watched. Peter was his son though, so he had probably seen everything that was being televised.
He sat down, then slid his legs up on the couch, his back against the arm of the couch. Peter made a little noise, rearranging himself in Tony's arms as he moved, but stayed asleep. Tony pulled the blanket over Peter, kissing the top of his head. "I wish I had something to help you sleep," Tony said quietly. "Something to chase away nightmares. I'm sure your Mama has something, probably some kind of lullaby, a song. I don't, I'm sorry. My Momma didn't sing to me when I was a kid. Our butler, Jarvis, he would read stories to me sometimes, when he was able." Tony very gently carded his fingers through Peter's hair, making sure the little boy was still asleep. "I know I really don't have the right to ask, but just have a little patience with me. I'm not gonna be as good as Mama, but I'm still Daddy, and I still love you. We'll get through this, until Mama wakes up." Tony wrapped his arms around Peter and listened to his breathing, the comforting, small hand over the arc reactor.
“And I’m going to leave this rest of this argument up to Bucky,” Tony cut him off. “I have an idea of what he’d say, supposing he remembers enough, and I want to be there to hear it.” He knocked on the apartment door before opening it and the two walking in. Jamie pat Steve’s chest a couple of times as they went into the living room, like she knew what was going to happen.
“You know what,” Bucky said, shifting a little so he could reach into his pocket. “How about I just text him right now? I know for a fact that he planned on staying inside all day, so it’s just a matter of timing.” Wade nodded a little, and Bucky watched as he pulled his knees up a little. He quickly typed out a text to Steve. Bucky knew this was something that he and the kid had to work out; Steve had been the one to find Wade, to bring him home, and there had been some kind of imprinting, or something.
"Friends," they heard Thor call to them as they walked down the hall. He was standing outside of a door, no doubt Loki's holding cell, and he smiled at them. "Tis a generous offer from you, Man of Iron, to give shelter until I am able to return to Asgard with my brother, and the tesseract."
When he wasn’t in the lab with Bruce, Tony was going through Howard’s journal, and reading that was enough to give him a migraine. As he read through everything he had Jarvis scant he pages, comparing them to other journals and notes that Tony’d always had access too. Howard had been a very active supporter of Hydra, that much was becoming obvious. It was made clear that his mom, Maria, had no idea of her husband’s loyalties, thinking that he was firmly on the side of good, working with SHIELD and his Aunt Peggy. When Tony was a teenager, getting ready to go to MIT, she had started to become a bit suspicious of Howard’s activities.
“Forget about me corrupting her,” Tony said, glancing at Steve. “These two are going to do it all on their own.” Steve snorted and they both smiled. Steve started to move his legs, making Wade bounce. He yelped then laughed as he tried to wrap his arms around Steve’s legs to make him stop.
“The baby monitor,” Meg said. “I heard Conor waking up.” Tony pointed at her while looking at Steve.
"It said something new," Tony told him. "Something it never said before, something my mind couldn't have put together on its own. I don't sleep, because if I sleep, I feel like, they might actually find me."
"I am a personal fan of Crowley, he has decent taste in liquor, and understands the price of fine taste in decor. Even if it is too garish." Steve snorted, smiling.
“Ooo, aren’t you a luck man,” Tony smirked a little at him. “You must be dating a very successful man. Loaded with lots of money.”
"That's how you start a conversation?" Tony raised an eyebrow, hand twitching towards his watch again. "No, 'Sorry I tried to kill you?'"
When Steve pulled into a parking spot and shut off his motorcycle, he was aware of muffled music coming from nearby. When he looked next to him he saw someone sitting in their car, an older model, bright red, convertible car with a black-top, with their music playing loudly. Steve blinked, not quite sure what he was witnessing. There was a young woman with what looked like pink hair, sitting in the car, singing almost as loudly with the music, her upper body seeming to be moving with the music. He couldn't help but stare as she was, what he could only think to call it, dancing. It was like nothing he had ever seen before, and he had seen Peter dancing to some of his favorite cartoons before.
Steve blinked, expression fairly deadpan, and he looked down at the now sleeping Jamie. “Please, please don’t take after your Uncle Bucky.”
"But they changed it." Tony started rolling his hands, and turned back to the formula on Bruce's computer. "Yours was the base, with the base we can do anything. And here, we have their modifications. We don't even have to reverse engineer this!"
"What are you talking about? What did you do?" Oh, it was Steve that was holding onto him, if the closeness of his voice was anything to go by. Tony swallowed and opened his eyes, and immediately stumbled back. Steve put his other hand on his back to try and steady him. "Tony? Are you alright?"
“He’s right. Because the sooner we get back from dinner, then sooner we can start movie night, with a special movie.” Tony launched back up and hug-tackled Peter on the bed.
Tony made sure that Steve and Peter were occupied as he stepped into the little kitchen area, Jarvis already reading his mind and placing a call. Tony grinned.
Tony had his phone clutched in his hand, legs dangling off the bed, when Steve walked in silently to his bedroom. It was almost four in the morning, but he couldn't help but smiled when he saw him. They had been texting several hours earlier, and now he knew why Tony stopped.
"I've already set up some files for you to read." Mary was standing in the hallway, following a bit behind as he explored, ready to answer any questions. "Read them at your leisure. Some of them might be a bit hard, I'm not sure, but it's information on those that you knew during the war, and from Project Rebirth." Steve nodded, eyes locked on the files. He knew that information about Peggy, and Howard, and the Howling Commandos would be there.
But dare he open it? Who knew how much longer this poor pokemon had inside the ball though? They had already lost two others, and Tony’s little heart broke for them, but he had the chance to save this one, to at least try. It wouldn’t be too much to just play with the little one, right? What if it wasn’t little though? The public only knew about the two pokemon that went down with Captain America, Braviary and Arcanine. Those that knew him knew that he hadn’t started off with those pokemon, and they hadn’t be his only ones. They were the only ones that he ever risked in the War though.
"Yeah!" Peter was bouncing in his seat, eager to tell everyone about everything that they did in Disney World. "Daddy! I got a blue lightsaber, and Wade got a red one!"
"The man claiming to be Mr Stark's, lover?" Steve asked and he swore he heard a tiny chuckle from the woman.
"I think I can handle a few more seconds," Steve said. "Thanks," he said, and Tony almost missed it over the sound of the fireworks. He just gave Steve's hand a little squeeze in response. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad at the Tower if Steve was going to stick around.
“So your precious bosom buddy is going to want her first word to be something along the lines of Stark, Tony, Dad, or Daddy?” Bucky raised a brow. “You’re not hoping for her first words being something along the lines of Papa? Or Pops, even Steve?”
Mary tried to calm her breathing. She need to get up, get out, warn someone. Her radio crackled with static. "Parker! Hill!" Fury! He was still alive. "Do you copy? Barton is-" More gunshots, and the rest of Fury's words were drown out as Hill got the message. "He's got the tesseract! Track it down!"
The door beeped once, sliding open. "Tony." He paused at the door, not turning around. It was William, not Steve. Tony walked inside the workshop, then held the door open for Mary's father to follow him. He took the invitation, the door sliding closed behind them. Tony practically collapsed on the couch, burying his face in his hands.
"Can you stop for two seconds?" Steve finally huffed out, taking the Starkpad from Tony's hands. "Eat the sandwich, you've still got time."
Tony's eyebrows shot up and he looked between Steve and Natasha. "You want to move our base of operations to DC? To SHIELD's main HQ??" That was out of the question. Tony couldn't leave, and he certainly wouldn't be working with SHIELD looking over his shoulder. At least even more than they were already trying.
Steve grabbed the man's shoulders and threw him back, following him with his fists up. The man was up on his feet again before pulling the knife out and throwing it at Steve. He moved back, taking his eyes off of the man for a second, and when he turned back the man was gone. Steve instantly took off, rounding the corner, but didn't see anyone. There were enough buildings around that he could have ducked inside of one to make his escape, just like at the Tower.
Steve saw that this was much toned down, putting on the show for Peter mostly, and charming everyone they came in contact with. This was the positive side of the mask he wore, cheesing it up. But this time, the smile did reach his eyes, and he had eyes for Peter and Jamie. The two have come over to Steve, Peter picking up Jamie as he walked, then held onto her hands when she wiggled to stay standing. As Tony posed with the paid Flynn Rider, both back to back, arms crossed over their chests, he flashed a smile looking right at Steve, and Steve grinned right back at him.
“They want some self-defense lessons,” Bucky said plainly, crossing his arms over his chest, still standing behind Tony’s seat. He wasn’t sure how he felt about being used as a buffer between him and his boyfriend. “Said they were going to start learning parkour as well.” Steve made a little strangled noise in his throat. “They’re gonna do it either way, and you know it.”
"Happy Birfday, Daddy!" Tony shot up from the couch when he saw Mary walked in, Peter on her hip, the little boy grinning. Tony practically ran over, scooping up Peter from Mary's arms, Peter giggling, and started tickling his sides, dropping little kisses all over his face. "Daddy!"
"I am linking you to the nearest undamaged cell tower, increasing the strength," the AI responded. Steve watched him, trying to understand everything that was happening, but he didn't look too confused. There were questions on his face, though. "Miss Parker in located in the room next to yours. I am sorry I did not alert you sooner, but I had not been connected to the Manor server when she was transferred."
"Something tells me that they don't exactly want something big." Steve turned his head a little to look at Tony.
"I admit that I missed interacting with Young Master," Jarvis said and Tony raised his eyebrows. "It would do you well to stop getting into so much trouble, Sir." Mary had to laugh at the AI and Tony frowned, almost pouted.
Steve turned to follow him, watching him slip into Bucky and Meg’s apartment. He smirked playfully and hurried over to follow him. He heard Jamie’s squeal as he walked in.
"Shut up!" Tony growled. He knew his shout would probably have drawn the attention of Thor. "I ever hear of you getting anywhere close to Earth after this, expect to see me. It will be the last thing that you see," Tony promised. The door was opened by Thor and Tony turned, stepping through. "Thanks, big guy," Tony said as he walked down the hall without so much as a glance back. That business was done with. For now.
Bruce walked in the room and Peter was pointing to Clint's chair. "Uncle Clint sits there, and Uncle Bruce sits there." Bruce blinked and took his seat, not actually sure what was going on. He looked to Tony who only shrugged.
"You said it was flimsy," Tony looked at her as he sat up in his chair, Bruce taking back the tablet. "But, it's enough that you want to take a shot at it?" Natasha nodded.
"Okay, but we're not gonna listen to your crappy music," Tony said, poking Steve's chest. "Jarvis always puts together a playlist for the holidays, and I trust his choices."
“Love you, too,” Tony whispered through a smile. After a couple minutes, he let out a goofy little laugh and Steve raise his eyebrow a little. “Just, this is a little surreal to me. Me being in this bed, and happy, and with you, well, with anyone really.” There was almost a purr of happiness when Steve’s thumb started to rub gentle circles against his cheek. “The happiest I thought I could get was just being able to see my son a couple times a week. Thought we’d be doing the traveling from Manhattan to Queens for a while, and not just to drop them off at school. And you know, I was content with that.”
Tony rearranged his arms, bring his tablet up to rest on one knee, one hand doing all the work of two, as his other arm was firmly around Peter, playing with the ends of his hair. Peter's hands were tracing circles over the new arc reactor, then tracing the new triangle pattern.
"Did you even look at the song titles?" She asked. Bruce was working with Jarvis, trying to track the exact location of the woman. "Titles, not Artists. For once that doesn't matter."
"Doesn't seem like the first panic attack that you've encountered." Steve took Mary's jacket, putting in the closet for her as she put the tablet down by the couch.
“Of course he does,” Peggy said. “He has a whole group, dear, eight of them.” Steve blinked. “Tony and Vee trained them from their eggs. He raised them for Vee to have companions.” She watched the Super Soldier’s mouth open a little, gears turning in his head. “Steve, just like yourself, Vee was his first pokemon, at the tender age of 6. He saved her, all because he wanted to make her feel better for missing you.” Steve’s stomach was rapidly dropping as Peggy spoke.
He was just all knotted up from not sleeping, and George being a dick, that was all. He knew that Peter would be happy now that Wade was here, so he had that going for him. He was sure that he could get through dinner relatively quietly, since he had already had his birthday pancakes, and the day would end relatively peacefully. He wished that Mary was awake.
"You're in rare form today," Steve said as he set a plate down in front of Tony. "I'd almost say that this possibly isn't your first cup of coffee."
"Yeah," Steve nodded a little. "Made a few friends out there, and there's one that could use the phone better than I could. You could probably get some data off of that one that looks better than mine."
"When are you supposed to moving?" Tony forcefully changed the subject, bringing forth a little snort from Mary. "And when is Peter coming home?"
Tony pushed himself up, then wrapped one arm around Wade's shoulders and pulled him into a hug. "You don't have to make anything up to me, Wade. I'll tell you what I do want you to do, though." Wade peered up at him with expectant eyes. "Keep being you, keep being Peter's friend, and looking out for him. I know it can't be easy for him being the youngest, or the smallest, kid at school."
"I told him no running," Tony said as he stood up, slowly stretching his arms above his head. "The kid is creepy as shit when he's trying to wake you up."
Tony took a slow breath as the film reel ran out of tape. He slumped back against his chair, warring with the thoughts, and heaven forbid, feelings inside of him from the film. "What the hell was that supposed to mean??" Tony breathed out, throwing the journal in his hand onto a table. "Was that supposed to help, because-"
Mary made sure that Captain Rogers had some clothes, shoes, and a jacket before they went back outside, going to her car. She let him take his time taking stock of the car, and letting him push almost every button on the inside as well.
“Not technically. Obviously we’d like them to be, but we can’t always count on something not getting out.” Steve noticed that Wade was shuffling his feet a little, trying to slow them down. This was apparently a sign that he wanted to talk with Steve. “This one was more stealth.”
"That's a big negative," Tony told him. "No one's here to watch the little Spider." After Natasha had coined it, Peter had loved the nickname Spider. They decided to use that as his code name over the comms when they on missions. "Not taking the chance."
When Mary let go she quickly unlocked the door to the apartment and ushered Tony in. He set the box down and Mary went around turning on lights. "I'm sorry if it's really late," Tony said quietly. A little part of him wanted to wake up Peter, but another part of him, a new more responsible part of him, knew that Peter needed to sleep. "I guess, I just couldn't help myself."
His first was one of his crazier ideas, and he wasn't going to tell anyone about it. Except maybe the one, big, blonde, alien that was standing in the way. He nodded to Thor who was standing in front of the door of the cell that held his crazy brother.
Tony ran his hand through Peter's hair, kissing his forehead. "I'm not going anywhere, Petey. No matter what happens, I'll always get back to you, you know that." Steve watched Tony with his son, saw the easiness that Tony held him, tried to comfort him from something that Tony was probably all too familiar with. He slid over a little closer to grab the blanket from the end of the couch, wrapping it around Peter and over Tony.
"That's nothing new," Tony said, still making his way towards the building. "His personality is dangerous." Julie hummed with a smile as she nodded, falling into step besides the child-laden man.
"Merry Kissmas, Petey." Tony grinned at him, then looked at Maria, who was setting down Peter's bag and jacket, and then a bigger canvas bag that looked three times as big as Peter. "I thought you two were going to be at Grandma and Grandpa's tonight."
"Get her back inside the house-" Tony winced when he heard Rachel started to yell at George, "-quietly."
"I think if that were really true, you would have done it already," Steve said, with a raised eyebrow. "I mean, if something were going to drive a man to drink, it would be what you went through, and the resulting nightmares." Tony grumbled, but didn't say anything. "And if you really couldn't play well with others, we wouldn't have worked as a team so well out there. But you're also Peter-obsessed, and that's not a bad thing."
"-probably, uh, not drumming your fingernails on the mostly white linen tablecloth." Mary chuckled, looking down at her nails. "Perhaps even looking at those fingernails and thinking, 'God, I should have stopped in all of my wedding plotting to have that manicure.' Too late now."
Tony swallowed. "I should tell you, that if anything happens to me, Peter gets everything," Tony told him. "I guess, at this point it would go to him, and then to Mary because Peter's too young, but that would go to you and Rachel until she wakes up. It's all set up like that, dozens of lawyers making sure it's ironclad."
Tony felt tense, and he didn't know why. It had only been three months, but what if Peter didn't want to see him? What if he started crying? What if Tony had hurt him by not showing up? Did Peter think that Tony didn't love him anymore? That he had abandoned him? Did-
“Please, do not continue that sentence,” Rhodey begged. “You don’t need to ruin Captain America’s image even more.” He laughed when Tony groaned.
"Oooooh," Peter said, making his mouth big as he drew the word out. "Like Mama and Phil. They dated, then fell in love, then they got married." Tony already saw where this thought process was going. "And then I got another parent." Apparently Steve had caught on, because Tony felt Steve drop his forehead against Tony's shoulder, shaking slightly with silent laughter.
Tony leaned up to his knees, pressing his lips to Steve’s before resting his forehead against Steve’s. “I needed to hear that,” Steve whispered to him.
When Tony left the room Steve followed him. He knew where he was going, of course he did. Tony stepped into the room that previously held Loki's cell, the room where Phil Coulson's blood was on the wall, probably the last room that Peter was in before Loki kidnapped him.
Tony let out a little sigh. "I should be alive." He couldn't look at her. "Unless it was for a reason." As much as he loved his son, Peter was not enough of a reason for the Universe to keep him alive. "I'm not crazy, Pepper," he said softly. "I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right."
"I was actually wondering the same thing about you," Steve said, and Tony noted that he hadn't actually answered Tony's question.
When he looked over at the couch, he saw tails wagging, ears perked, and the girls seemed to be smirking. “Oh, stop it.” He grumbled a little. He oophed when Arc’s tail thwapped against his back. He followed Steve into the kitchen, and watched him make his way around to all the ingredients that he needed. Tony caught the sight of some fresh puffs in the fridge, too. “I hope the girls weren’t too much trouble while I was gone.”
“That would be utterly fantastic.” Tony responded. Steve pressed against Tony’s hand, backing him up against the wall of the elevator. “Oh, I didn’t know that you had chores down that way, Captain Rogers.”
"Is this what you call accountability?" She pulled out some pictures from her purse and Tony frowned. He took them, looking through them, Mary looking over at them. "It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?"
"Tony," Steve said quietly, drawing Tony's eyes open. He was staring straight into clear blue eyes, stunning azure eyes that begged to take Tony's breath away. Steve leaned his head in, enough that Tony knew what he wanted to do, and he didn't hesitate to meet him the rest of the way, his hand sliding up to the back of Steve's neck. Steve's lips were warm, and soft against his, the kiss was gentle, but the need was there.
“You don’t believe him?” Strange asked, turning and motioning for Tony to follow him back up the stairs. Tony didn’t see that he had a choice as the self-proclaimed Sorcerer Supreme started walking away from him.
Tony's fingers tapped on the reactor in his chest as Jarvis started to bring up windows of information around him. He would need to make a new reactor piece for his chest, one with a more accessible core. He would need to keep replacing the palladium core, in an attempt to stop the build up of the heavy metal in his system. He couldn't eliminate it, not yet, but he needed to buy himself more time. He'd also need an easier way to check the palladium levels in his blood, he couldn't keep coming down to the lab for a full workup.
"Why don't you just watch a movie with Peter?" Tony edged forward to grab the coffee at least, but Steve kept shifting.
"We'll talk about making a morning walk later," Meg had grumbled when she opened the door to a ridiculously happy looking super couple. Tony had happily walked in with Steve behind him as she went into the bathroom to finish getting ready.
Tony went for another swing around, coming in flying for a punch to the head, making Thor see stars for maybe a second. He was already raising his arm, weapons popping up, Thor ready for a swing, when a shot, and a glancing blow off the armor caught their attention.
“Friends!” Thor greeted jovially as he walked out of the elevator. Steve followed at a more sedate pace with Tony in his arms.
. “Peter doesn’t see a point either. We figure that if it’s something important, you guys will tell us.”
“I’m sure there are a number of things you should know,” Tony quipped, closing his eyes, hand resting on Jamie’s stomach as she tried to pull her shoes off. “Quit that, trouble-maker.”
Rhodey glanced over and nodded. "It's kind of a classic, easy, snack. Surprised you actually know what it is."
"Uh, hey," he said a little sheepishly, then held up the present. "I know it's not until tomorrow, but I have Peter's birthday present."
"I know," she said. "Things are different now when it comes to parenting. Both good, and bad, but I make do. I'm luckier than most other women, or men, for that matter though." There were three beeps and Steve turned to look at the box that Mary had put the food in. She opened it, grabbing a towel that hung on the rail of the oven, and pulled the plate out, putting the second plate in.
"Jarvis, is Meg's phone active?" A hologram appeared, showing a blip on the map. "Contact her, right away." Tony sat on the stool behind him, crossing his arms.
When Tony saw the jet, he sat up a little more. He hadn't listened to anything Pepper had said, knowing that he had probably head it all before from her through their years. As soon as Happy pulled up, Tony was practically flying out the door. "Sounds, great, Pep." Tony said. "Don't do it again, stop putting yourself in danger, the usual." His voice faded off as he went for the stairs of the jet, pulling himself inside.
Tony turned back to Steve. He wanted to do this? Oh, he could do this. "I'm starting to want you to make me."
"We'll start learning about shading after we learn a bit more about color theory," Steve told him with a smile. Sometimes Tony had Jarvis pull up the camera on the weekends to watch Steve with Peter with their art lesson. Tony decided that he needed to make a better art room for the both of them.
Every day they were down there with the eggs, and during the time Tony had obtained the evolution stones needed. Tony talked to them, and the one that Vee had predicted would hatch first, he laid a Fire Stone down next to it. “I think that one should be a Flareon,” Tony announced as he did it. He also pulled out a bowl of Luxury Balls, putting one down next to each egg. Tony had asked Vee if she wanted to upgrade to her own Luxury ball, even offered to paint it like Steve had, but she had turned it down. He smiled gently at her and nodded, understanding. He always had one ready, just in case she changed her mind.
“Unfortunately, no,” Strange told him. “I will only be able to throw a shield of sorts over his mind, to hide him, but not to sever the connection.”
"He's going to leave the state." Steve turned his attention back to Bucky. "I don't think he'll be doing anything else to his ex-wife or son." Steve was about to ask what he meant when his saw Bucky's body tense, his head turning to the side a little. Turning around Steve saw Wade standing in the archway to the living room, and his stomach dropped when he knew that Wade had heard most of, if not all of, their conversation.
Wade had been steadily creeping closer, his hands behind his back, but Steve had seen the bag of cotton candy there already. Fortunately, Jamie had not. “Why not?” Wade asked with a grin. Jamie was looking back and forth between Steve and Wade. “Peter told me she likes cotton candy.”
He stopped, leaning his back against the wall, crossing his arms in front of him. "He told me he loved me." Mary's eyes widened a bit as she looked at him. "Really, I think the timing could have been better, but I asked him to move in with me first, and that was horrible timing first." Tony looked up at her, but she could see his eyes dancing in excitement. "Then your mom calls, and he comes by, and does this just, sickeningly romantic thing. I mean, really, he can't be human with some of the stuff he does."
“She likes it!” Peter insisted, grinning like his Dad. Steve knew he was doomed. Again. Jamie was indeed patting the ears on her head, looking delighted about it.
"When you clock out, stay home." He tapped the desk and head back for the front doors again. "Paid vacation, mandatory! Don't want to see you here until Monday next week!" Tony didn't hear the mans reply, probably to try and refute it, and stepped outside, quickly catching sight of the three women he was looking for.
“Stop listening to the tabloids!” Tony shouted. “I’m not ruining anything! Steve Rogers was a menace all on his own, long before he became Captain America. I’m not taking the credit for that train wreck.”
Before Steve could ask anymore questions though, Peter came into the kitchen, dressed in his pajamas, and stood next to Mary, watching her. He clearly remembered that she had promised ice cream, but he wasn't demanding, and waited patiently for his treat.
"I did indeed," Tony nodded. He stared evenly back at Wade, then extended one arm and Wade moved in to hug him. Steve caught the whispers from Tony to the boy because of his enhanced hearing. "Everything's taken care of kiddo."
"How did you find out that he wanted to use it on Tony?" Steve asked the scientist, watching him sip his tea.
One shower and a change of clothes later, Steve was rubbing the bridge of his nose as he rode the elevator. As the doors opened one half clothed child ran, hiding behind him, out of breath but grinning. "Peter Parker." Steve looked up to see Mary standing there, the front of her shirt, and part of her pants wet, holding onto Peter's pajama top. "Come put this top on, you know it's time for bed."
“I seem to remember a time when I never used your first name.” Tony started to tap his fingers on Steve’s chest. “A time that ended nary a year ago.”
“Stop making sense,” Tony whined softly, then opened his eyes to look at him. “Help me move over, I want you laying down next to me. I’m hurt, I’m allowed to make demands.”
“Then I can come back down to work on the suit? Just an eight hour lock down?” Tony asked, stepping onto the elevator, Steve coming in next to her, arm around his waist as Jarvis took over the controls of the elevator, taking them to their private floor.
"You have a mean kick," Steve said, causing Tony to raise an eyebrow. Oh, that's right, he had kicked Steve. "I actually felt it." There was a little lift to the side of Steve's lips. He found it funny.
Tony felt Steve's arms move, surround him, and he was vaguely aware of moving, but he was more aware of how Steve's muscles moved against him. He couldn't help but squirm a little, until suddenly he touch changed, and it was softness under his body. His bed. Steve was putting him down, but then he was crawling over Tony, and even his presence was pushing against Tony's sense in a way he couldn't deny. A growl reverberated up Tony's throat, and he swore he saw Steve's eyes flash before he was pushing down, capturing Tony's lips again in a near bruising kiss.
"So, what are you going to do about it?" She asked him. She wasn't going to complain if he wanted to take more responsibility, her own job was starting to demand a little more attention from her, and Peter was starting to spend more time at her parents place.
"He's still tired from the carnival last night," Mary said as she put his stuff on the couch. "But, he knows he has to stay awake until after lunch, right, baby boy?" Peter nodded, giving her a tired smile. Mary leaned in, kissing Peter's cheeks. "Mama has to go to work now."
"Yeah?" Peter asked quietly, and Tony nodded. He leaned up a little to kiss his Daddy's cheek, then climbed down to the ground. Coulson took his hand and they walked out of the room, heading down the hall in an attempt to cheer Peter up.
“I’m giving phones to the boys now,” Tony said under his breath. Steve moved to get up and Tony watched him. “What are you going to do?”
"You are relentless," he chuckled out, keeping back more reactions as she pulled on each toe separately.
"The Stark Tower?" Is that what Bruce was talking about? "That big, ugly," Tony turned his head towards him to glower, "building in New York?"
“Hello, handsome.” Tony made grabby to him as he walked by, bringing Steve down for a kiss. “Mmmm, you haven’t had a post-misison shower yet.”
“You gonna be okay with the twins by yourself?” Bucky scowled a little at Steve, and he smirked just a bit.
"Yeah, might as well. Might be a little easier than just popping up." He ran his fingers through Peter's hair, tousling it a little bit. "He needs a haircut. Remind me to bring that up with Mary. How's Cap doing with Jamie?"
"You're such a sweet talker, Tony," Steve said with a fond roll of his eyes. "A regular bee-charmer."
After a minute or two Tony knocked again, no one coming to the door yet. He vaguely heard the main door opening, but didn't pay it any attention, until he heard a gasp.
Bright side? I've have a couple of ideas for some one-shots set between time jumps, and one of those will be coming out probably this week. I'm planning on when the end of this story comes to immediately jump into the next multi-chapter fic. Fever induced dreams are the best sometimes. :) But seriously, you're all lovely and amazing, and I hope you enjoy this chapter!
"So, when Tony was making the arrangements for your parents to come last week..." Steve asked without asking.
"Bruce is waiting in Tony's room," Mary told Steve quietly, holding the door open for them. A cough worked its way through Tony. "He'll have some medicine for him so he doesn't get sick." Steve nodded and walked towards Tony's room. She'd talk to Steve later. Soon.
"One can only drown so many times before it becomes a Pavlovian response to water," Tony hit out, trying, and failing, for a chuckle. "God, I'm so messed up."
"He'll be alright," someone was talking softly. "Just sleeping, Jarvis assures me that everything is working how it should be, no lasting damage." A familiar voice, but he felt it rumbling through his back. He was lying on whoever was talking. "Yeah, thanks. Tell him goodnight from both of us." His pillow moved and then stopped talking. A moment later there was a low sound of other talking, but it was coming from another direction. The TV.
And then they had a plan. The suit was almost built, almost finished, and he had finished the power up sequence on the shit laptop they had provided them. He double checked the wires to the bomb on the door as Yinsen hooked up the suit pieces to the contraption.
"Yeah," Tony nodded, and watched Peter. "I knew that might happen." Steve saw the weariness in Tony then, saw how it weighed on him. The two of them had basically been keeping up a long distance relationship for the past four months, with visits as much as Steve could keep up, and then everything sort of metaphorically, and literally, blew up. Tony had been kidnapped, and as soon as he got home there was the prospect of a baby to take care of and keep safe, and Peter coming home. Tony had barely slept, and Steve had recognized that a nightmare had woken him up that morning, not aware of it until just moments before it was too late, and he still wasn't able to relax. How Tony was keeping it all together at this moment was beyond Steve.
"From my understanding, he changed from the man that I knew." Steve shrugged a little. "There's a lot I'd like to talk to Tony about, the past, but I don't want to push. He's very reluctant about that stuff."
"That sounds like a great idea," Mary said, nodding. "There's the pool there, and the gardens. It's still nice enough to set up some games outside, and a buffet."
“They’re going to be insufferable now,” Tony bemoaned, a smile in his voice. Steve laughed and leaned to kiss him one more time. Tony smiled at him. “So are you. You’re going to fit right in.”
Tony let out a huff through his nose and gently got up with Peter in his arms. Coulson was just a couple rooms down the hall, a light still on. Tony knocked on the door and Phil wasted no time answering it, letting Tony come in.
“Fine!” Tony let out a breath. “It doesn’t count.” He pointed a finger at Bucky, that Jamie reached out to take in her hands. “But, she better not add in those last consonants until after she says my name.” Meg snorted as her phone started to ring. Tony turned his gaze to her and she just gave him an innocent smile in return as she picked up her cell.
Hello all you lovely people!!! So, here's an update on what's happening and why there is no new chapter yet.
"Not everything is related to Captain America, or Howard Stark, now is it?" She asked, raising an eyebrow at him. "I trust that you have manners, and tact, enough to figure out a way to talk to him."
“He said he’s trying to work on a spell, to bring him back…. Until then, he said that he’s going to stay like this.” Mary’s head shot up to look at him. “That’s not even the best part.”
"No," Tony shook his head, frowning. "No, Steve, tell me it didn't happen." Steve looked at him, biting his lip, and shook his head.
"And you know that if you ever need help with it that you can come to us, right?" Tony asked, and Peter had to nod. "Well, if you don't need help with your homework, then that means that I've got time that was Peter Time, and it's an empty slot now. So while you're busy doing homework, I'll go check on Jamie to make sure that she isn't doing something silly, like crawling into the dishwasher, or eating all of the soap." He could see Peter trying not to smile at the thought. "What I'm trying to say is that, yeah, Jamie needs a bit more attention than you do, but she's tiny still. You are growing up to be an awesome young man, so you don't need as much attention. But that doesn't mean that I'm not always going to be there. I'm still going to try and help you with your homework, even if you don't want it."
The room exploded with shouting and moving, Thor grabbing Loki's arms and pulling him back, shoving him up against the opposite wall, Steve shouting Tony's name and lunging towards Tony, Fury and Hill each drawing their weapons to point at Loki, who had started to actually giggle. Tony gasped, then felt the burs dig in around his lips, fine silver points easily sinking into the skin. Pain flared up and he felt Steve's hands catching his arms, holding him up.
Steve nodded and kissed down his nose. “Yeah, I’ll go get her, but I need you to rest. I’ll be right back, I promise.” He turned to get up and noticed that the room was empty now. Strange and Loki were gone, no doubt back to his Sanctuary, and Pietro had more than likely taken Wanda, away from the threat that was an agitated Winter Soldier. Even Bucky was gone from the room. As he headed for the hallway though, he knew where his friend had gone.
“I can’t do another charity event,” Steve groaned. “Our PR team is good, there’s no doubt, but I can’t keep dressing up in the suits just to try and show the press, well, whatever it is they want to see about us.”
"Ouch," Mary put a hand over her heart, feigning a hurt expression. "My co-parent can't even be bothered to come visit me because we're friends." Tony stuck his tongue out at her. He didn't care if it was childish or not. He was a billionaire, and Iron Man, he could do what he wanted. "And we're supposed to be moving in less than a week."
Steve leaned against the wall of the hospital room, curtains drawn, door closed, thankful that the night staff was quiet. Not that they'd see him in the room unless they were looking for him. Natasha was waiting outside the hospital for him, keeping an eye out, hidden as well. After she had released all of Hydra's secrets on the internet, everyone knew who she was, and now who Steve was. Jarvis was working, along with Bruce, to grab and hide other details, but that was something that Steve couldn't help with. He had learned how to use the tech of the Twenty-First century, but that didn't mean he knew the first thing about hacking.
Steve kissed Tony's cheek. "You can do this, Tony," Steve told him. "I know you can. I've seen you with Peter, and you're so much better than you think you are. This probably isn't going to be easy, but if anyone can handle this with him, it's you."
"You're so kind, Stark," Barton quipped, smoothing down his own jacket. "To willingly give away the attention like that."
"It's counts, because we could have had food before we fell asleep," Steve countered, handing an empty plate to Tony, before started to load up his own. The food did smell delicious, and he could see a bit of Tony's Italian side in the food, as well as Marcello's own influence, and Pierre's in the desserts.
"Were it anyone else's wedding, sure." Tony let out a sigh and Julie chuckled. "The sooner you reach the reception hall, the sooner you get your legs back." Tony let out a shout and tried to move faster, making the boys laugh loudly at the movement. Tony certainly wasn't going to be winning any races.
"That Maximoff girl," Tony started after a second. "She really did a number on me, Steve. And, I uh, I don't know how to really handle it. I'm afraid to talk about it, because it'll send me right back into that head space, and I can't do that." He looked up into Steve's eyes. "I'm really just a shitty boyfriend-"
His hands reached for the handle down to his workshop and pushed it open quickly, flying down the stairs. In retrospect he was lucky that he hadn't tripped. He reached for the workshop door, but it didn't budge. He growled then looked at the scanner, pressing his thumb hastily to it. He had put this in for something like this. If he had been too drunk, or incapacitated in some way, if he shouldn't be in the workshop for his own safety, then he wouldn't be able to get in. Jarvis couldn't override this, unless it was an emergency.
"I do," Tony said nodding. "Alright, well, let's start with seeing what this other boy gave to you." Peter hopped up, running into his room. Tony thought she was still nuts for giving him this responsibility. He was also almost thirty years older than Peter was, and a very high functioning, low responsibility, adult. He yearned for a drink.
Steve ground his jaw together a little. Tony reached over and put his hands on Steve's knees, trying to ground him. "Natasha and Clint are already looking for another site, and I've got Jarvis going through all the information that SHIELD has. We'll know as soon as we get a hit." Steve nodded, putting his hands over Tony's. "Don't need you getting all righteous and angry just yet, not when there's no target to take it out on yet."
“Whatever gave you that idea?” He slid out, Tony right behind him with the diaper bag, and his own work bag. “This is how it’s going to be for years to come, Tony. I would just get used to it now.”
"I'll accept your offer to move," Julie started and Tony's eye brightened a little. "If you'll accept the position of becoming Wade's Legal Guardian."
"Not going anywhere, if you don't want me, too," Steve told him, giving his hand a squeeze. "How's your head feel? Think you might be able to sit up?" Tony nodded a little, and moved with Steve to sit up. He took a deep breath, but it felt like his lungs couldn't get enough air and he started to cough. Steve started to rub his back in circles.
“I didn’t teach her nothing,” Bucky defended. “I made sure that she didn’t spontaneously stop breathing, or combust.”
"Hey, you busy? You mind if I send you on an errand?" Things had been a little awkward since she had caught him trying to get the damaged Mark III suit off. "I need you to go to my office." He grabbed something from his desk, having just completed the programming on it. "You're going to hack into the mainframe and you're going to retrieve all the recent shipping manifests. This is a lock chip," he said as he put the thumb drive in her hand. "This'll get you in. It's probably under Executive Files. If not," he started to shut down his computer again, "they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading."
"Yeah," Tony said quietly. This man reminded Steve of the man he talked down from an anxiety attack last year. "I'll see you both soon, everything is set up. Peter will be happy to have you both here." Mary's Dad said his farewells and Tony hung up the phone, grabbing it, and just gripped it in his hand for a second. Steve felt like he was intruding suddenly.
“Flare. Flareon.” Pepper looked up from her desk when she heard Ruby come into her office, and sounding a little off. She moved to crouch down, meeting the fire pokemon in the middle of the room. “Flareon.” She wanted Pepper to follow her, if the slight tug on her skirt was any message. Last time this had happened was when Vee had gone back with Steve.
She smirked a little when he responded with a text of peter trying to help with dinner. Seemed she wouldn't even have to worry about dinner either. Coulson was out of the state at the moment anyway, and she had been exhausted after work today, so not having to worry about cooking was a bigger relief than Tony would know. It looked to be an easy night.
Then Steve saw what Tony and he had been afraid of since announcing they were together. Pictures of them out together, mostly of dates, where they thought they had been hiding enough, spliced next to pictures of them walking into the building, claiming that things were rocky. Then pictures of either him or Tony, out with the kids, alone. Everyone wanted to make a story where there wasn’t one.
"It's a better honorarium than my PhD's," Tony said easily. "What exactly are you making there, pooh bear?"
"I do," Tony said. "Almost everyone that I let in betrays me, they hurt me, and I had to learn early on how to protect myself."
"Well, he's your kid," Rhodey stated. "And from what I've heard of his Mom, there's no reason why he shouldn't be tough. It's genetic." Tony nodded a little absentmindedly, opening a new file. "Are you going to get some sleep tonight?"
“I’m gonna go start some coffee,” Tony muttered quickly and pushed away from the counter. “Fuckin’ sap,” Steve heard him mumble under his breath, and he smiled as he went back to shaving.
After making a list of groceries, Steve went to put the notebook back into the study and he stared at the files sitting on the desk. Was he ready to look at them? Was he ready to find out what had happened to his friends, to those he cared about? The loss of Bucky still felt fresh to him, and he had to wonder if he was willing to add on to that.
The stopper had been pulled off of the decanter, his right hand reaching out to rest on one of the glasses. Tony took a long breath in through his nose, closing his eyes when the familiar scent hit. Oaky, a bit of the burned wood smell, with a hint of something almost flowery, and warm, so warm that he could feel his mouth nearly watering, his nerve endings firing up in his chest, tingling across his shoulders, down his arms, and even pooling in his stomach. The last actual drink he had, had been some kind of homebrew beer that Clint had brought over, before Christmas. The team had all been in one spot, and they had a movie night, Clint excited to show off his first batch of homemade beer. It hadn't been half bad. Tony had stopped himself after two bottles.
So, if it feels like there are things that were left untouched; there are. And (most of) it's done on purpose! It purposely leaves it open, and it leads into the over-arcing plot in my head. I'll say it again, we are going to see the kids grow-up, and we're going to see Spiderman! And some Deadpool!
"But did you actually Look at them? Just, trust me on this. Take a second look," she muttered. Tony looked at the songs again. "There's a damn theme, an Important one."
“Amazing how just a couple of smaller changes can lead to so many bigger ones.” Tony hummed a little at her words, giving a nod. “I think that perhaps Steve had the right idea of shutting off the workshop.”
"Babies need a lot of attention," Peter said, both Tony and Steve detecting a bit of pouting in his tone. He turned his head to look at Jamie, and Jamie was now looking right back at Peter. "She's still small, I bet she can't even walk yet."
The wooden door opened all too quickly for Steve’s taste, and Tony was walking out, the doctor behind him. “I’ll see you next week,” she told him with a smile, then tapped a card that was in his hand. “And use that if you have, too.”
Steve collected his shield and walked over to Iron Man. To Tony Stark. The same Tony Stark who was here, instead of with Peter. (Although he secretly wanted to see Stark unload those weapons into Loki.) Loki merely raised his hands in surrender, the armor disappearing. Steve hated magic.
“I’m pissed because they exposed my boyfriend to the public.” Steve sighed and shook his head. Tony reached over, gently scratching his beard. “Means that goes away sooner than we’d like.”
Tony. It was Tony that was with him, talking to him, helping him. It felt like a chore to open his eye lids, but when he did he was greeted to the bright eyes of Tony, worried. He wasn’t being dragged off back to Hydra, wasn’t drugged or hurting, he was there in front of him. “Come on now, it’s not cool to have a nightmare right after I do,” Tony said tightly, trying to make a joke. “You know I don’t like it when people try to steal my thunder. Only one mental episode at a time, you know this.” He let out a huff a breath when Steve suddenly wrapped his arms around him, squeezing a little. “Yeah, it’s okay, babe,” Tony whispered to him in his ear, arms wrapping around his neck. “I’m right here, and so are you.” He kissed Steve lightly. “Everything is gonna be okay.”
"Okay. Let's do this." Tony could go a couple rounds with this guy, he needed an outlet to take his anger and frustration out on, and Thor was presenting the perfect target. All he wanted was to get Loki to the Hellicarrier so he could get to Bruce, and Peter.
“You bring up a really good point,” he said as they continued down the stairs. “Tony thought the same thing, for a long time actually. I think he actually said as much to her on his first visit.” Wade glanced up at Steve. “You didn’t know that Tony saw a therapist?” Wade shook his head no. “You really don’t explore that side of the internet, do you?”
“Barely,” Steve told him quietly. He surveyed the perimeter of the community, and found that his best bet would be to jump the wall into the backyard of the furthest house from the guard house.
"Because you surprised me by being here, and I don't actually want to talk to your boss," Tony told her.
"Better," Tony answered and Peter looked at him like he was crazy. "There are lots of different Doctors," Tony told him. "I'm technically a doctor, but I'm not a medical doctor."
"Mr Steve." Peter saw him and gave the super soldier a tired smile, happy to see him standing, and looking better. Steve looked over and smiled at Peter, walking to meet them.
Steve pushed himself up from the couch, putting the tablet down on the coffee table, and following Tony. "Pool noodles?"
"Did you get rid of the bad guys?" Peter wasn't going to let go anytime soon, gripping onto Tony as he walked over to the couch in the penthouse of the Tower.
Tony's feet tapped as he rode up the elevator, getting antsy, wanting to see Peter. Everything was simultaneously falling apart, and then back into place. He was on an uphill trend at the moment.
“You can put that in a costume, but you can’t put that in the Cap suit??” Steve should not have to suffer while on Avengers business if he didn’t have too.
"You know I can't talk about the details." Steve gripped Tony's other hand and slowly helped him up. Tony already had plans to grab some painkillers along the way. "But, I'm glad to be back. It was simple, but I guess I've gotten used to sleeping in a very nice bed."
Tony took a couple steps forward, grabbing Peter around the waist, lifting him up and into his arms "Were you hopping around like a bunny? Are you a bunny?"
"Stick to the plan!" Tony yelled. He would get Yinsen out of this alive, he would do it. He would repay this man for keeping him alive, for giving him a chance to get back to his son, to change his life. "Stick to the plan!" Yinsen ran off, grabbing a gun, shooting off into the hallway. "Yinsen!" He was breathing heavily and looked back to the progress bar, willing it to finish faster.
"I think there were more," Tony told him. "I don't think they made it, but the way he talked...." The brunette looked down at the floor, before Steve was lifting his head back up with his fingers. "They have two Enhanced, they're just kids. The girl, she has these powers, and it makes me hate magic even more, but, she can get into minds." Steve frowned a little. "She was able to control me, like Loki's scepter did." Tony was gripping Steve's arms tightly, closing his eyes and counting to five in his head.
He took a deep breath, throwing his arms over his head, and closed his eyes tightly. Tony was appalled with himself, ashamed. He was physically fighting with Clint, then he had tried to attack Steve. And when had he called the suit to himself? Why would he do that? Had he felt threatened?
He could hear her take a breath. "We recently confirmed that the Winter Soldier is the assassin that's been trying to attack you. He's practically a ghost, Tony. You are lucky to still be alive." Mary cut the line with Tony and Jarvis took over on the HUD. Tony hated when his bad feelings were right.
"I can't go in the water," Tony told him. Steve waited, letting Tony take his time, keeping his hands around Tony's. "I haven't been swimming in five years, I can't take baths, and sometimes even showers are hard. I have taken some interesting positions in a shower to avoid water getting to my head. Turns out having your head shoved in water over and over again has some effects."
Steve's hand unclenched, and rested over Tony's lightly. "On behalf of all those that have seen action, thanks for the consideration." A particularly loud pop in the air had Steve closing his hand around Tony's instinctively. Tony squeezed his hand instinctively around Steve's, trying to keep him calm.
"Not in the least," she shook her head. "We actually need him awake to see how well the surgery will hold. His heart has been controlled to work at a regular constant, but we need to get his heart used to working at its normal paces. It will help him heal as well, I'm very confident in his recovery."
