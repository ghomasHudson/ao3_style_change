"Yes, but only a few years ago. The gallery owner said the parents died suddenly in a boating accident,” replied Sherlock.
“Right!” John said encouragingly to Agatha, about the cricket, hoping that was the correct response. It seemed it was. Agatha carried on, oblivious. “But he’s got a devious googly,” she added cryptically, as she topped up her still two-thirds-full wine glass, “they can’t pick him at all!”
ecstatically back…it was bedlam. From all the noise in the hallway, the door slamming and the enthusiastic greetings going on, John was reminded of the classic theatrical pantomime dame, crashing about in the wings, just about to make her grand entrance onto the stage.
Mycroft Holmes, who claimed to play only a minor role in the British Government, gasped and practically shivered at the sensation of this man’s hot breath on his skin, his hand on his hip, moving down lower on his behind. He made a tiny sound of surprise that this would be all it took to bring him down. He swallowed hard again. He had to try to regain
in Greg’s ear, louder this time, and with just as much thick, dark intent in his voice as Greg had just utilised on him.
Mycroft rested the side of his face on his hand. “That does rather depend on what you have to offer?” he said, and he smiled as he spoke, to say he hoped he wasn’t being too difficult. But he was very particular about tea and coffee.
Sherlock looked at the fabric ball and smiled. He laid the packet of strings on the table. “You went to Guiviers' to get these,” he said, amused. He turned to look at John. “So this was the Secret Squirrel business yesterday.”
Instinctively, on impulse, Greg broached the gap between them and reached for Mycroft’s hand again, squeezing it and then keeping hold as he leant forward quickly to kiss Mycroft lightly on the cheek. His lips were soft, the brief scent of his aftershave dark and woody. Mycroft was so taken aback that he had not seen that coming at all. 'What’s wrong with me,' he thought, looking at Greg with surprise, feeling Greg’s fingers once more laced between his own, ‘that I didn’t see that coming? Is this what emotional involvement does? Totally annihilates one’s senses?’
Across London, at 221b, Baker Street, it seemed no one had remembered it was Valentine’s Day yet, and there was a discussion going on in two different rooms about the thriller they’d watched the night before. John was moaning about it from the sitting room as he searched in the sideboard drawers for the calculator that he knew they had kicking about somewhere.
That was most odd of him to say that word in that context, and he had said it without really thinking. It was the sort of comment John made; that he said he "loved" something to mean he really enjoyed it, or liked it immensely, or relished it. Maybe it was simply too much time spent with John and he was picking up on these slang 'John-isms'.
Grieving for Sherlock's death and for his loss all over again, because until now he had never been able to really let that grief out. He could
Greg took another sip and remembered his manners. “Er, shall we go and sit down?” he suggested. He gestured with his glass towards the sitting room next door. “An’ listen, you can call me Greg...if you want…”
"I–I just...erm..."John found it hard to lie on the spot. And particularly hard to lie to Sherlock, to whom lying was totally pointless. "Erm, er...nothing. It's just strange to hear you..." He decided it would be best to tell a half-truth. "It's really strange hearing you swear, that's all. It's—I've never heard you swear before. You
They're basically a colourful cardboard tube with two clearly defined 'ends' and a central holding bit which contains a coloured paper hat, which is in the form of a crown (but we always call them 'paper hats', don't ask why, I don't know), a joke on a slip of paper (traditionally always a pretty bad joke), and a little toy/puzzle/useful item (or not so useful item). You all simultaneously (if possible) pull the cracker with another person, and it bursts into two pieces at this point, opening up the central chamber and thus revealing all the little things inside. They also have a little strip of paper inside which makes a 'bang/crack' sound as it rips apart. This is the 'crack' of a cracker and why they have that name!
“You’re looking very slim and dashing, Mykie,” she said as she let go of him. “Is there a young lady?” He withdrew slightly to position himself a safe distance away and leant elegantly against the doorframe as soon as Lucia had come back through it.
who was the cause of it, and that it was both the best and worst disguise that Sherlock had ever worn, to lie there and be dead in front of John.
"Ah, that'd be Guy's and St. Thomas' then, mate," replied the cabbie, oblivious, full of the joys of Spring.
Greg whispered. He took hold of Mycroft’s left thigh and bent the knee to bring it up higher, wrapping around his own arse and the back of his own leg, curling his arm around underneath to support it and hold it there. “Fuckin’ ‘ell, Mycroft…I can’t believe—
“What? Hot?” Greg managed, around swallowing his mouthful, so desperate was he to make the joke. (It sounded like
Sherlock let them have their moment of shocked admiration and then he took the floor again. “People see, but they don't
She didn't stop painting and after a long pause, she replied, "Quite busy doing this one now, if you don't mind."
"Unmarried. Never married. One sister. But apparently she accrued massive gambling debts and now spends a lot of time in Australia. There was some kind of massive quarrel about a house their parents left to them. They fell out for a while."
was what I meant,” replied Greg between breaths - also apparently having trouble processing - and he pressed his teeth lightly into Mycroft’s shoulder now, swirling his tongue, making Mycroft gasp again. Greg twisted slightly and shifted, pressing his cock more against the crease of Mycroft’s groin on his captured thigh. He moaned a little again from between closed lips in another of those deep rumbling purrs and then he concentrated. “I
Sherlock wanted to clarify it so there could be absolutely no mistake, and so he just said the words, finally, after all these years, and what he said was; "I feel…
Sherlock flicked his hair out of his eyes and looked at John openly. “Because you’d have told me not to,” he said. Which was true. He would have.
John was determined that he would see Sherlock first. He couldn't miss that first time for the world. He bit down hard on his lower lip and moved his left hand firmer and faster on Sherlock. Suddenly Sherlock's face changed, his eyes dropped shut again and he gasped John's name. His hand stilled on John's cock and his head tipped bonelessly back, his lips parting slightly. His neck arched beautifully and his head rolled gently against the wall in a slow, sensuous arc.
"Who's here then?” asked Agatha loudly from the other room, adding gratefully, “Oooo, thanks, Sigs!” as she was clearly being passed something. John could guess what it was from the sound of two glasses being enthusiastically clinked together immediately after she spoke.
John was first of all rather taken aback that by coincidence, out of all the poems in the book, Sherlock had memorised the first two lines of what he thought of as one of his favourite poems, but then he thought that with Sherlock, there were no coincidences - and then he was instantly distracted from his own introspection when he noticed the artist's reaction to Sherlock's words - and her reaction was very odd. Standing next to her as he was, John suddenly realised he could feel the tension emanating from her in waves. He looked down at her hand holding the paint brush and saw that the smallest joints of her fingers were white and rigid where she was holding the brush so tightly. Her hand was very slightly shaking and her posture had straightened. Her ruddy face had even paled somewhat and she was looking fixedly at her canvas. She was suddenly wound as tightly as a spring. Gone was the relaxed laughing attitude of only a few moments ago.
he thought, and he almost moaned himself. “Oof, say it again, just like that...” he demanded, and he flicked his tongue lightly up Mycroft’s neck and kissed it.
- about the way these two were kissing each other, he thought. He was spellbound. The way they were holding each others’ faces and were stopping to look at each other before kissing again for all they were worth. There was a hell of a lot of laughing going on in there too, between all the kissing. That was definitely real. He stepped back from the door before they caught his movement through the glass, finding that there was a soppy little smile forming on his face watching them. Then he thought, it’s almost indecent to be watching this. It’s like a love scene from Brief Encounter. He blinked.
As John was getting his jacket on to leave, the poetry book slid out of the inner pocket and bumped down onto the floor. Feeling like a fan at a convention, John picked it up awkwardly and looked at Gabriella with a sheepish grin. “Can I ask you, er..." and he held it up and waved it a bit.
Sherlock looked back at him standing there and, just as John had intended, he read John's intentions instantly in his eyes and his body language and the look on his face.
It was like the heart of embers when the fire had burnt down low; the black shells of coal and the dark grey ash hiding the vibrant coral glow that was buried in the centre like a warm secret.
“Good afternoon, Agatha,” Mycroft said, smoothly, in a best behaviour purr, as she reached him and grasped his hand. “How
Three years I've been writing this. Three years! It's been a labour of love and I've loved every minute. ❤️
"Oh, I do everything really well, John," replied Sherlock, in a harsh withering tone, and John wasn't quite sure what he meant, but he didn't feel he wanted to ask. "Let me get something for your cheek," he said instead, going for ice and a clean tea towel.
Sherlock leaned forward and kissed him slowly where his finger had traced. “Ah, you’re right,” he said afterwards, grinning back, “I appear to be feeling better already.”
Mycroft saw his opportunity for a bit of revenge and took it. “Mmmm. Well. Whatever could you be frightened of, Sherlock?” he asked innocently, raising his eyebrows. Maybe he was thinking about Sherlock barging in on him earlier, thought John, perceptively.
Suddenly John thought of Gabriella's words to him at the sea wall. 'Seize the day, John, take every chance,' she had said, and it had resonated within him somehow. Now she had written it in his book too, so he could never forget it.
His tea, when he tasted it, was perfect. And there was a reason why Greg had brought his phone up on the tea tray. “Excuse me a sec,” Greg said, putting down his mostly full mug and picking the phone up. He waggled it a little. “I’ve just gotta text my rugby mates to say I’m gonna give training a miss today.”
Mycroft amended - and with noticeably more toned musculature on the parts that counted. He had really lovely legs. “And he likes
They found the tourist office, which was of course closed, but from the helpful maps displayed in the window, they were able to locate the coastal walk and the footpath that John had talked about. The pier and shed - which turned out to be a tiny fisherman’s cottage - both dated back to the 1800's and were Grade II listed. They were also National Trust properties, and as such, well maintained, still intact and very easy to find.
Sherlock’s bedroom was nothing like John had thought it might be. John had imagined - when he’d even thought about it, that was, which had only really been since he’d come upstairs to see where he would be sleeping - that Sherlock’s childhood bedroom would be vaguely like his bedroom at Baker Street; not exactly
At that, Greg really laughed, and as Mycroft smirked at him from across the table, Greg thought, with his insides all aglow, ‘Honestly, thank you, Sherlock, for the best Valentines’ Day of my life!’
Greg smiled. “Oh, well, that’s that settled then!” he said, happily. He tucked the cigarette back between his lips and held it between his teeth to smile around it. “Now I can smoke happy!” he said. Mycroft snorted a little in amusement at the very idea.
my holiday slides,” added Greg, sitting back in his chair and letting go of Mycroft’s hand with pretended relief, as if that had been his true incentive all along. Mycroft barked with laughter again. “Only your slides, Gregory?” he managed to ask daringly, recovering himself. Greg lifted an eyebrow. He liked where this was going. “Maybe some cine films an’ all...if yer lucky...” he added.
put the slightly tight-fitting waistcoat back on, though. Which was sexy. He looked extremely relaxed, sitting with his eyes closed in a bright patch of sun at the little table and chairs in the small but sheltered - and rather secluded - courtyard garden. From the pleasant fragrance wafting through from the kitchen, Greg could tell that that was a cup of the (truly amazing) Peruvian coffee that he was enjoying. It was one of Greg’s favourites too. When he opened his eyes at Greg’s approach, Greg grinned at him from the open back door, delighted, and held out a small paper carrier bag in one hand and, in the other, a crisp white bakery box. “Bonus fresh granary loaf, the last one…” he said, raising the carrier bag up high, “…annnd….!” he left the sentence unfinished, but held out the box at an angle to Mycroft so that he could see the contents through the cellophane window. The box contained three delicious-looking fat iced doughnuts - one soft pink, one pale purple and one baby blue. “They were on special!” Greg remarked, “ ‘Alf price!”
Agatha dumped some tea leaves and the boiled water in the teapot and began to stir it rather vigorously.
Mycroft hastened to reassure him. “No,” he replied quickly, “no...” Words were failing him. “It was...
…" said John to him, very slowly, the threat quite clear in his voice and his stance. He also said very clearly,
Gregory Lestrade was sitting with his back turned slightly to Mycroft and the maitre’d as they approached the private bar. He was wearing the same smart navy blue suit that he’d been wearing at the party and drinking clear liquid from a short glass.
Lucia and Siger had put John and Sherlock at one end of the table, on opposite sides of it, with Lucia next to Sherlock in the middle and Mycroft on her other side, at the other end. Agatha was next to John and Siger was next to Agatha. John found it interesting that Lucia herself separated and yet joined together her two sons at the table. He also smiled at the fact that he had been positioned next to Agatha.
He was referring to news from Greg Lestrade, who was supposed to be supplying them with results on a suspect's DNA test.
Mycroft needed to hear that like he needed air. He had already found Greg to be so honest; there was no duplicity or secrecy about him. Not here and now, at least, not when he was with Mycroft, like this, at this intimate moment. The enormity of all this honesty was astounding to Mycroft, and though he remained the safe keeper of many state secrets - both large and small, desperately important or otherwise - suddenly he could not keep his own. They tumbled from his lips like a confession.
What was the point? Sherlock just did what he wanted. Nothing was secret from him; even if you thought it was, it really wasn't. What a way to live. John shook his head and went to get his coat, his wallet, his phone and the book, which lived in John’s bedside cabinet...along with all the other private things he didn’t necessarily want Sherlock to know about.
though he wasn’t sure about what. But Sherlock wasn't smiling or laughing, he just looked deadly serious, as if wanting John to realise something from what he’d just said.
“Good day at the office then?” asked Greg cheerfully, and Mycroft made a soft sound of amusement. “You could say that, yes…” he said. “I had a very satisfactory result in soothing tensions between two…unhappy factions, let’s say.”
This chapter is dedicated to StarsAndStitches for some of the excellent science ideas of the contents of Sherlock's bedroom...! It wouldn't have looked the same without the plastic molecules, the Escher print or the atlas of historical sea charts, Stars, honestly!!! ;)
"Boating accident! How old were they? If Gabriel Peters is in his mid to late fifties they must have been—"
Greg went back for more, but their activities had moved them along the worktop a bit, and in his haste to snog Mycroft senseless, he misjudged the proximity of Mycroft’s half-full whisky glass to his backside. As Greg shoved Mycroft quickly back against the worktop, either his hand or Mycroft’s back (or a combination of both) caught the glass and jogged it. Instinctively, Greg grabbed for the spinning glass, but his quick action had the unfortunate effect of accidentally jogging it more, swilling the whisky inside it even more violently, and making some of it slop over the side in a small scale alcohol tsunami. Greg realised immediately what he’d done - a split second before Mycroft even moved in reaction from Greg's sudden movement and the noise of the glass. He jerked his behind away from the worktop and twisted round to look down and assess the damage. Greg, who was still holding the glass, whisky all over his fingers, stared in mute red-handed horror at the small puddle he had created on the worktop and -
“No, come on - she's sweet,” said John, stroking her. “She’s purry and friendly. What more do you want from a cat?” The cat twined around his leg, winding her tail around his calf. He wasn't much into cats actually, but this was a very friendly  one and he definitely had time for such an affectionate animal.
He needed to think about what he had actually said yesterday, about what had been almost the first thought in his mind this morning when he woke up.
“Carpe diem,” he said firmly, fixing Sherlock with his gaze, and he stood up slowly to do just that.
this for quite some time in advance to get a table at Constantine’s the night before St. Valentines day.”
Lucia returned to the room almost immediately, bearing the opened wine and just in time for her turn. Siger waited until she had deposited the bottle on the table and then, as she held out her hand, he leaned over to position the fish carefully in her open palm. It reacted immediately and the tail rose aloft and began waving. John glanced at his list. “Independent!” he proclaimed.
“Mr. Lestrade, sir,” murmured the maitre’d, making Greg turn round in his seat and then hurriedly stand up. “Mr. Holmes has arrived,” he added, somewhat unnecessarily, and then he stepped back discretely. They both thanked him at the same time, and he left them for a moment to greet each other.
No, John thought, relieved, well, maybe this was going to be fine after all...who knew, maybe it would even be more than fine.
Greg tilted his mouth up to Mycroft’s ear and paused. “It’s really—ahh, do you want me to say it?” he whispered, his voice and still posture both heavily charged.
Having a shower with Sherlock was everything John had never imagined it could be. He took up so much space standing in the bath under the shower head. He was so tall up close in the confined space. He looked amazingly hot; naked and soaking wet. And not least, but least surprising of all these unimagined things, he was a
Not quite twenty minutes later, he was back, finding Mycroft dressed in a more relaxed version of what he’d been wearing the night before. Greg liked very much seeing him with his shirt open at the neck and with no tie on. He
Sherlock carefully lowered the painting to the floor and leant it against the wall. "This one was the last painting that he completed and it was still on his easel, at his London studio in Leytonstone," he said, studying it.
Mycroft stepped back, his own mouth now dropping open a little, before he realised what he was doing and closed it quickly, swallowing the growing feeling of horror - the realisation that he had been right and something was truly,
“Maybe it’s too much to ask over the festive period,” he suggested to Sherlock, about the nice murder. “Everyone’s probably quite busy…” But something Siger had said had caught his attention. “Sorry Siger, what did you just say? You just called it the Old Year’s Night? What’s that? I’ve never heard it called that before!”
He smiles at his reflection, at the halo of messy dark curls, at the bite mark on his shoulder, at the tiny red marks all over his chest…
Sherlock flashes Mycroft an exasperated look, snatching the piece of paper from him quickly, ripping it into quarters.
The noises are getting clearer now, sharpening into something akin to the sound of a yelping dog. Quite like how Redbeard had sounded after he’d been bitte-
, he realises as he gives a futile tug. Mary knows what she’s doing. These are far too tight for him to wrangle out of.
“Interesting,” Sherlock continues, narrowing his gaze before stalking off to the other side of the room. He bends down, face inches from the bedsheet, before standing straight up again and walking back to where John and Lestrade are standing.
He waits with bated breath, the man on top of him circling his entrance torturously as if to draw out the moment. Why can’t John just get on with it?
Because either way, John is going to suffer. He might end up being proven guilty or incarcerated and done in for abetment if Sherlock is proven guilty. Both outcomes aren’t exactly pretty and Sherlock wants to avoid them both as best as he can.
And again school is a bitch and idk when I'll have time... but hey we're nearing the end, that's a plus :,)
“Ok fine, what about that time when both of you came with me to pride and held hands all throughout the march.”
The next chapter should... SHOULD be up within two weeks. Next week is a bit iffy cause I have an internship again but I'll make do
Sherlock echoed angrily, yanking the ice pack violently away from his head so he could glare at John. "Not after the last time, if I can help it. It was very awkward to have to explain it
…” he gasped. He was breathing very hard. Mycroft lifted his head and wiped his own mouth delicately with his thumb and first two fingers. Greg happened to be glancing down at that moment and saw him do it, and he threw his head back against the pillows again and laughed. “Oh
By now John was fairly close to a minor paroxysm of frustration. He banged his hand a little on the desk. “Oh, for God’s—
but not quite enough. Mycroft moaned with his mouth closed a second time, more a long reverberation in his throat, and suddenly Greg released Mycroft’s neck and growled, “Right,
everything clearly, as clear as day. No one recognised his ability for what it was. People thought it was weird.
Sometimes Sherlock looked at John secretly, when he was busy not noticing Sherlock, and Sherlock would see the folds and creases and lines on John's face deepen as he frowned at something he was doing, or thinking about, and Sherlock found he wanted to soften them by making John look up at him and smile. Or even laugh. And John's laugh was a thing of beauty indeed. John's laugh was precious and so deeply infectious. Hearing it often made Sherlock laugh. And that was a pretty rare occurrence. To put it in perspective, before John had come along, he had very seldom laughed at all. Before John had come along, there had been very little laughter in Sherlock's life. There had mainly just been getting high. Scoring the drugs and getting high and then the slippery roller-coaster of descent down into the big black hole of oblivion…only to have to crawl back up again eventually. The cocaine brought with it the gift of frantically excessive creativity and an insanely increased speed of thought, but as its thrill deserted him, the speed and depth of the drop was a terribly high price to pay.
From the strength of the soft grey light filtering in through a crack in the curtains, he belatedly realised that it wasn’t as early as he usually woke up, even for a Sunday, and that for once he had really slept in late. He laid there listening to everything for a moment, enjoying the relative peace and comfort of a slow Sunday morning, which was the only day when he did occasionally allow himself a little lie-in. The varied (and quite loud) birdsong outside was not a new occurrence for him to wake to, he thought, amused, but the human musical accompaniment downstairs certainly was. Then he thought - rather wryly - as was the bed he was in, being that it was someone else’s. He stretched a luxurious whole body stretch, feeling his spine crackle pleasantly. He felt
...Because it’s important and there's something about it I need to know and thus far...I am missing it.
“Yeah, do,” said Greg, grinning, he gestured in the air with the slowly-shrinking cigarette. “Before it’s gone!” he said.
They looked at each other, Mycroft’s mind whirling at a mile a minute. Then they came both instantly to the same crashingly obvious conclusion.
"Nicolette asked us to find you,” Sherlock interjected quickly, “We know who you are - we'll keep your secret. We just want to know why."
Not for the first time this evening, Mycroft found himself rendered incapable of speech and he simply couldn’t provide a reply to that statement. Which didn’t matter though, of course, because Greg wasn’t expecting one anyway.
"Think about it. What do I do all the time? I can’t stop myself…I know a lot about you that you don't think I know about," said Sherlock, looking straight at John. He paused for a second, then added, “I know a lot about you that you don't yet know about yourself.” He said it strangely, like it was almost a guilty confession.
The Old Bailey is the Central Criminal Court of England and Wales, commonly referred to as the Old Bailey after the street on which it stands. It is the most famous courthouse in London, possibly in all of England. It's really old. (You see the inside of it in Sherlock's mind palace in The Sign of Three, actually!!) Quite why Sherlock has a hand-drawn map of its floor-plan in a drawer at home, I don't know.
Is that that really posh restaurant with the private bar place - the one we went to once with Greg’s friend what’s-his-name?”
John did that thing with his face, a kind of frowning and then a pursing of his lips and raising of his eyebrows which meant;
John's shockwave gradually lessened and morphed and became something else. It became a terrifying hope. He cleared his throat because there was a massive lump in it. He looked down at the floor as he was suddenly no longer able to look Sherlock in the eye; he felt that his emotions were too great, too overwhelming, to both be able to say what he needed to say and to experience these feelings that he was feeling all at the same time, while looking at the reason for them both. "I know. I...I knew…” he said, "Sherlock, I think I knew I—“ he stopped and started again. “Me too.” Then he found that he
“Well, you’re in luck. I have it right here...It’s me,” said John, still grinning, feeling his own heart swell within him.
He looked at Sherlock and thought, 'He’s probably doing quadratic equations in his mind,' and he started to count backwards from a hundred. Suddenly John realised he could feel Sherlock’s pulse through his cock and then he concentrated on counting that for a moment, rather than allowing himself to think too much about where his hand was; not to mention the fact that Sherlock’s hot hand was curled tight around his own ragingly hard cock. He thought he could feel the pulse in that, too. He also thought he was either going to faint, fall over or come, and right now, he wanted none of those things to happen. He leaned hard against Sherlock and pushed him slightly towards the wall behind him for support. 'Some talking would be good here,' John thought, 'just to cool things down a bit,' because he was close, and he needed to get control of his cock before it exploded. Sherlock, obligingly, took the hint and let John take him the two paces backwards towards the wall. As his bare back hit the plaster, he gasped suddenly with shock.
By way of answer, Mycroft went for him fiercely again, his hands everywhere; in Greg’s hair, down his neck, across his broad shoulders and over his back to slip down the sides of his thighs where they found his wonderfully pert behind, pressed against the Edwardian porcelain. Greg moaned into Mycroft’s mouth as his hands slid lower, his fingers digging into Greg’s thighs in his passionate caress. “Oh, if only you knew...” Greg mumbled as Mycroft released him.
he mumbled quietly, wrapping his left leg over Mycroft’s right and drawing him closer, entangling their calves together as he began to move his hand, his touch alternating every few strokes between firm and fast and slow and sweet. “Tell me what you like,” he murmured, the dark, secret sound of his voice low and soft in Mycroft’s ears.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow and turned his head to look coldly at Sherlock. The look could have felled a charging rhino.
to John, at least for a while, but maybe forever; maybe he would never see John again after this, but still he couldn't say it, he just
There was a significant-sounding silence. “You did say ‘exactly’ - you did ask me to tell you exactly what he said…what did you expect?” Sherlock asked, slowly.  “And why
He cleaned the wound carefully and applied two steri-strips over the first part of the wound near the shoulder blade, where it was deepest. The rest of it only needed several large dressings.
"Very small paring knife. He picked it up from the block when he sent me to get something from the freezer. The knife was clean - the whole kitchen looked pretty clean...it's what's going on in the office upstairs that's dirty."
“Oh, please, do finish your toast first!” Mycroft admonished him in his normal voice, seemingly dropping out of the silly role play, and as Greg started to laugh at this, Mycroft added - suddenly back in his sultry voice again - “…You’ll need it to keep your strength up…”
Only Sherlock would instantly memorise the list of the fish's responses and what they meant, thought John. He smiled even more widely at that, but he didn't look up. "That's me," he said, still looking down at the fish. He knew he would be passionate. The fish had always told him that he was. When he finally did look up, Sherlock was looking directly at him from across the table. John smiled at him wryly and raised both his eyebrows, but Sherlock just picked up his glass and drank, looking at John as he did it.
“MI6, now?’ said Mycroft, "It was MI5 earlier…” He was still a bit riled up, but at least now he was smiling.
Sherlock looked up at him, flicking his hair away out of his eyes. “Uncle Rudy taught me,” he said simply, “when I was four. He was a firm believer that every child should have a penknife and he gave me a good one and taught me how to use it. For a lot of different things.”
“No, really, you boys go and relax, we’ve got this bit in hand,” Lucia said warmly, as she retrieved a huge set of antique weighing scales and their brass oval bowl from a cupboard, and put them on the table. She turned the bowl the right way up and set it squarely on the holder of the antique scales - before she frowned and took it off again to give it a quick rub with a fresh tea towel. She had already put Siger to work finding some ground almonds in the pantry. However, he’d been in there quite a while. “Ahhh….They’re not in here…” he called uncertainly at that moment from within its depths.
And so John realised all at once that he was staring at Sherlock, that he must be a bit red in the face and also that he had the beginnings of an erection. Which was by far the most embarrassing of the three and more than just slightly mortifying. He swallowed with some difficulty, cleared his throat and fidgeted in his seat. Of course Sherlock noticed John's odd reaction. He looked at him sharply. “What?" he said,  crossly.
“What?” John repeated. He was still irritable but he could see Sherlock was connecting some dots, somewhere.
He blinked. He looked at Sherlock standing silhouetted in the sunlight at the window, and as Sherlock turned his head away suddenly to look out at the street again, John saw the top of the white dressing covering his knife wound above the open neck of his pyjama top. Unlike the head-chef's knife wound months ago, this one
John wondered whether he might go and get his own book for a bit - thinking he might actually start it properly in this little moment of downtime, and especially if Sherlock was just going to be sitting reading something - when the front doorbell rang. They heard Siger exclaim excitedly from the kitchen and then he popped his head around the doorframe of the little sitting room. “That’ll be Great Aunt Agatha!" he announced cheerfully to the room, like they had all been waiting excitedly for her to arrive, and then he quickly withdrew. “I’ll get it!” they heard him say to Lucia, as he passed back through the kitchen to do so.
drinks,’ thought John -  eyebrows raised internally - having noted the steady flow of booze from early afternoon onwards after Agatha arrived. “Oh, ok,” he said agreeably.
Greg leaned forward and kissed him again as he tossed his own tissue over Mycroft’s shoulder - vaguely towards the basket on the floor, but missing it completely and not caring. “You could never be a wet dishrag - you long, tall hot drink o’ water, you,” he said reassuringly as he moved back to his side of the bed. Mycroft burst out laughing.
Sherlock began to smile too at that. “If this is how it’s going to be, John, I'm not so sure I can take it…You
“Put that piece of toast down and come over here…” Mycroft purred, in a voice of dark and liquid sex, stroking his free hand through his hair.
John was flabbergasted by these placidly made revelations. “It’s by your foot. But they’ll have realised as soon as they spoke to each other that neither of them had anything to do with organising it—"
The table in the dining room was huge and made of dark antique oak. John had noticed it through the open doorway when he had walked through the house earlier to go upstairs. Now, a few hours later, it was transformed. It been set for the six of them and Lucia had done so beautifully, utilising her skills as a flower arranger, which John duly (but quite truthfully) admired, especially the little posies of acid green and deep red chrysanthemums that stood in small glass vases at either end. John was really glad he’d decided to bring Lucia the bouquet of chrysanthemums as a gift when he arrived.
"I do, don't I?" remarked Gabriella, turning to look at her partner and shaking her head and smiling. She took over the story at that point to explain further. “So what happened was, the gallery owner, Nicolette - her name is Nicolette - when I was delivering the first three paintings that were finished, she said me, 'People are so looking forward to meeting your brother.'
John was smiling back. “Well, ‘till then,” he remarked, as Sherlock nudged him and passed him the scone bag, so that he could carry the larger and heavier parcel of paintings with both his hands free.
Mycroft…” whispered Greg, shaking his head a little and, looking up at him, the tips of his fingers stroking lightly up and down on Mycroft’s glistening cock. He was breathing as hard as Mycroft was.
“Busy,” was all Sherlock said. “Never mind, John, it wasn't urgent, I’ll ask Mrs. H if she can get some from Sainsbury’s when she goes out.” He’d found the coffee and was looking for the scissors in the top drawer to open the packet.
Siger reached over without asking to re-fill Agatha’s now empty sherry glass and then discreetly topped up his own too, earning a little frown from Lucia, who had sat back down at the other end of the large table to continue rolling out her pastry.
GQ mag = Gentleman’s Quarterly magazine - it’s not what you think; it's a upmarket men’s fashion, news and lifestyle magazine. Some of the underpants advertised in it are hideously expensive. Maybe some of those are the ones Mycroft is wearing. (My version of the magazine has ‘British’ GQ on it so maybe that means there’s an international version too…)
which evaded him repeatedly, and there had been a knock at the door downstairs, which he ignored because Mrs. Hudson was in. But the knocker kept knocking even when he bellowed, “Mrs. Hud-
“I love your collarbone Sherlock, it’s so prominent against your skin,” he breathes against the line of bone there, “I hated it when you trounced around the flat in low-necked T-shirts.... You have no idea how badly I wanted to run my fingers across it, how badly I wanted to sink my teeth into it-”
“Sorry Mr Holmes, that is classified information,” she huffs, the ‘I’m not your brother who allows you to do whatever you like’ unspoken as she fixes him with another fake smile “I cannot allow you access-”
Sherlock Holmes?” she says, “He looks at you like the centre of his fucking universe every time I catch you both together.”
“Med school is hard John,” he says, taking the edge off his voice to match his friend’s dispiritedness, “Everyone finds it hard, heck even
He turns the thumb drive over in his hands, peering inquisitively at the lettering drawn on in black permanent marker.
“You’re trying to stop me...” Sherlock mutters angrily. He’s not letting Moriarty get the best of him, not this time. He inhales deeply, closing his eyes. This will all go away if he tries hard enough… If he tries-
“There’s a GP quite near here that’s got an opening,” John continues, turning around as he clutches a corner of the wooden door. “So I think I’ll work there for the time being.”
He thanks his lucky stars that he hadn’t filled it too full. He wouldn’t want to explain a flooded floor to an irate hotel manager.
John gives one, two, three more thrusts and he’s coming as well, Sherlock sighing as he feels John’s warm spunk spurt into his arsehole, feeling owned, loved and cherished.
Mike flashes Irene a pleading look, hoping that Irene has some idea on how to deal with this. Nodding in response, Irene shoos Mike towards the other end of the bench, taking a seat directly opposite John.
“Lady Carmichael,” Watson presses as Sherlock sighs, his worst fears realised. Joh- Watson is trying to weasel his sexuality out of him again.
“Sherlock! Nice to see you finally awake,” Mycroft calls from his seat as Sherlock enters the room, John following closely behind him.
Sherlock look you can’t do this alright, we have to talk about this, whatever it is at some point. You can’t just ignore it like nothing happened.
“It’s not waxing poetic if it’s true, darling,” he murmurs, caressing Sherlock’s cheek with the back of his hand as he presses a kiss to Sherlock’s nose.
He had courted danger even after getting married to Mary, carrying a tyre lever with him everywhere that he’d gone. Hell, he’d even gone into a drug den ALONE and picked a fight with the first person he’d seen. That didn’t exactly scream SAFETY and SECURITY to Sherlock.
It’d been Sherlock’s fault really, the first night they'd met, the man had taken him on a cross-campus adventure to solve a mystery pertaining to the mysterious disappearances of lab equipment from the biology labs.
The last thing he ever wanted to see was John feeling humiliated and embarrassed, especially over these dreams that were honestly, nothing to be ashamed about. He used to cook every morning after a nightmare, knowing that John always appreciated it immensely when he did so. John never seemed to suspect anything, taking his plate from Sherlock with joy on every one of these occasions, proceeding to shovel the food into his mouth as if he'd been starved for a week. It was one of the few surefire ways he knew how to make John happy.
“John…” Sherlock shakes his head and peers up into John’s questioning eyes, “John, you have nothing to apologise for. I actually quite like them.”
He pumps his fist up and down far faster than before, timing the movement of his fist with his thrusts as Sherlock groans and cries, feeling the pleasure within him uncoiling and spiking.
He’s not entirely sure what John wants to do now that it’s really just them, alone and together all at once.
Sherlock gulps, his prowess of speech absolutely failing him as the words trickle out of his mouth in unformed sentences. How does John keep surprising him? How?
Sherlock waits for John’s door to close before setting his hands on either rim of the sink, John is back, he’s really back. It’s not a dream or a drug-induced hallucination and Sherlock is absolutely thrilled. And he’s not just back for the night, he’s here to stay, here to stay for an indefinite period of time and Sherlock feels like he’s being wracked with joy. Everything could go back to normal, everything could go back to the way it was…
They’ve been together for merely two months, but that was, to be honest, more than enough time to discover that Sherlock likes it rough in bed. And John is about to use that to his advantage.
He plants a kiss on John’s chest, smiling groggily as John starts to snore, the soft snuffling pervading the silent room.
And the sex. Yes, more of the sex. He can’t believe he’d fallen asleep right after they'd finished. God!
The room is tiny, as expected, with a double bed and a small ensuite toilet fitted with a tiny bathtub.
“So that’s what this is all about!” he cries, shaking his head miserably, “John you can’t possibly be serious.”
He listens to the sound of cupboards opening and being shut before the man trundles back downstairs, gripping something silver and shiny in his hand.
He remembers having a book of constellations that an aunt had given him for a birthday present, a book that he had cherished deeply. He remembers pulling out a torch in the darkness, pointing it at the book as he compared the constellations on the glossy pages to those that marked the night sky.
The second time John called Sherlock beautiful was when they were waltzing around the living room. And this time, Sherlock had nearly crumpled onto the floor.
“Oh god, do shut up,” Sherlock murmurs under his breath to the imaginary Mycroft as he holds the restaurant door open for John who walks swiftly out into the night air.
Tears are welling up in Sherlock’s eyes, threatening to spill over as he struggles to focus on the ground, desperately willing himself to face away from John.
He knows that he promised John he wouldn’t keep secrets from him anymore but… He did make a promise first and foremost, at the wedding, to always protect John Watson and keep him safe.
“It’s just truly pleasant to see my boys together again,” she smiles and says before padding down the stairs.
Because somewhere along the way he’d messed up. He’d lost John and everything and oh what did he have left now except for a broken heart and an empty home.
He pauses, scrolling rapidly through the rest of their conversations, checking for any possible reasons for John’s sudden texts.
“My phone is dead,” Sherlock huffs, “Victor, in a fit of excitement, decided to introduce me to some new mobile game that apparently everyone’s been raving about.”
“That’s not a sufficient excuse Mr Campbell,” Sherlock responds coolly. “But if you believe that this is enough to absolve you of your guilt then by all means - carry on.”
“It’ll probably be less tiring if we do this here,” he explains as Sherlock’s cheeks redden in embarrassment.
It doesn’t take long till the man is heartily devouring his meal, John readily scooping spoonfuls of rice into his mouth as if he had been starved for ages. After all, food has never failed to cheer John up.
“John, he and Victor haven’t seen each other for years, it’s perfectly understandable if they want to have a bit more time to catch up.”
And then he's running, tearing his way out of the living room as John stares back at him, dumbfounded and in shock.
John hasn’t been in the room for a while either, ever since he’s started sleeping in Sherlock’s room to be exact. But still, most of his belongings should probably be there, exuding a familiar, soothing quality that nothing Sherlock owns possesses. The atmosphere there will probably help to calm him down, quieten down his racing thoughts and allow him to function normally again.
“The Mind Palace is a memory technique,” Mycroft mutters, interrupting him, “I know what it can do... and I know what it most certainly cannot.”
Sherlock can’t help but moan in response, a shiver going down his spine as he shifts his thigh to slot John’s legs with his, fixing John with a wide-eyed look before he realises that by shifting his legs, John’s thigh is now pressing harshly against his groin… and that he’s in a similar state himself.
Sherlock knows that he’s blushing, his pleased smile fading as he turns to face the floor, his cheeks heating up viscerally.
Sherlock watches on, his eyes wide as John steps impossibly forward, a hand caressing his cheek as John gazes up at him with imploring eyes.
“We’ll be having dinner first,” John replies, frowning as he mulls over the itinerary in his head, “And then we’ll be going over some things with Mycroft.”
John had been discreetly slavering the last of the raspberry jam over his half of buttered scone while Sherlock was speaking, and as Sherlock finished his explanation and leaned forward to place his cup and saucer on the table, he pushed John the pot of cream and said in a quiet aside, "More cream, John?"
Sherlock was thinking. He was sitting in his armchair, pretending to read the Sunday Times, but what he was actually doing was letting his eyes glaze over at the newsprint and he was thinking. He had walked into the room needing to think about what had been on his mind this morning when he woke up, and been about to lie down on the sofa and think properly, but then he realised as he stepped towards it, that if he did that, John might ask what he was thinking about and he didn't want to tell John that he was thinking about him. As John himself would have put it, for this he really needed to "act normal." So, mid step, he had changed direction abruptly from towards the sofa to towards his armchair and had picked up the paper that John had laid on its arm for him, already opened to the obituary pages, and had sat down. John was in his own armchair, sipping his coffee and reading The Lancet, and he was being quiet. Dust motes were gently dancing their usual slow waltz in the sunbeams slanting in through the windows, and these were, in their turn, creating two rectangular pools of slightly dusty warmth on the worn carpet. There was no case on. It was peace personified.
As the cabbie pulled away from the kerb, John addressed Sherlock fiercely. "What was it, hmmm? That never happens to you. Why didn't you realise he was armed?"
had the money to gamble—“ she pulled her bun tight and sat up straighter. “—Anyway, and so he gambled it all away and then he began to borrow.”
Just as gorgeous as he always did; whether that was neatly groomed and so handsome and smart in his suit and tie as he had last night at the restaurant, or simply - after the
he’d said. Too busy studying Gregory’s beautiful eyes, the way a lock of his silver hair fell forward and was swept back repeatedly. Did he even realise how very…
Before she even finished the sentence, Sherlock was coming out of the pantry holding a large container of black peppercorns. “Here,” he said, putting it on the table.
John laughed. Then he leaned a hand on the table, looking down at the phone in Sherlock’s hand. “Sherlock, I think it’s taken a lot for Mycroft to send that!” he said thoughtfully. “Screenshot it if you really want to, but reply now and say something nice. Something encouraging.”
Siger immediately put the hot serving plate of steaming scallops down on the table’s central runner between Mycroft and Sherlock. “I’ll get them!” he said to her quickly. “You carry on dishing up!” He shoved the tea towel had been using to carry the hot plate at Mycroft and went over to the sideboard cupboard in the corner of the room.
“Tell me what else you liked about me at the party...‘quite interestin’' is just not good enough...” said Greg softly, pleased with Mycroft’s enthusiastic response to his leg, and he slid his hand firmly round and over Mycroft’s lean right hip.
scoffed Sherlock, interrupting Lucia and nearly spitting out his mince pie in the process. “She’s not
The early part of the afternoon passed uneventfully. Due to the lack of wifi on his own laptop, Mycroft had been forced to resort to using his parents' ancient desktop computer in the study to check on some dodgy diplomatic situation in Uganda and John was in the sitting room, idly leafing through one of the few books that he had expressed an interest in receiving for Christmas and had actually received. He had yet to start reading it properly but was enjoying the easy pleasure of reading the long, rambling introduction. Sherlock had disappeared somewhere upstairs.
The greenness of the view out of the window drew him over immediately, and he put his overnight bag on the bed and went and looked out. The bedroom was at the back of the house and it looked out over the garden and the open countryside beyond. “Lovely view,” remarked John.
Now Greg laughed, long and hard and joyous. “Ooh, you’re one smooth hot bastard, aren’t yer…yer know that, don’t yer?” he said, and now Mycroft pushed him up and off further,  and slipped out from underneath, manoeuvring Greg expertly over onto his back as he did so. Greg allowed all of it, his hands on and moving down Mycroft’s own long back for a change as he and Mycroft switched position, Mycroft now looming above him on all fours in the semi-darkness.
He finishes with the petri dishes, scrubbing his hands clean before getting to work on the kitchen table, clearing the remaining detritus before doing one final wipe.
“Let’s go home,” he murmurs into the crook of John’s neck, the intimacy of the situation dampened somewhat by the various police officers milling around the room. But John smiles anyway, his lips pressed up against Sherlock’s neck as he affords the skin there a quick kiss.
“Err…” Sherlock mumbles, mind wading through the thick, syrupy vestiges of sleep, “Did you- Were you- Was it… ok?”
In Sherlock’s opinion, that little moment had lasted a lifetime, as if time had stopped for a moment, just to give them a space and dimension of their own. He had found himself acutely aware of when he had lost all points of contact with John, as if they had been wrapped around each other for centuries, only to be forcibly pulled apart atom by atom till they existed only as two separate entities.
“John...” he begins. It feels like his brain has caught a bad case of pins and needles because it hurts to think. He doesn’t know what to say next, doesn’t know what course of action will not implicate him in his love for John.
John shakes his head, struggling to clear the fog of post-sex euphoria as he makes his way into the bathroom, grabbing a flannel before returning to the bed, proceeding to wipe Sherlock’s chest up.
“That okay?” John asks after a moment, waiting till Sherlock has nodded his head before adding a second finger - this time Sherlock has gotten over the novelty of the feeling and is instead starting to feel a greater stirring in his abdomen.
If he hadn’t shot Magnussen, John would have been marked as a traitor and Mary would have been exposed. What other choice did he have.
“You didn’t have to say that. You didn’t! So why did you? Do you know how hard it was for me after that? To defend you? Because even I wasn’t a 100% sure myself!”
His subconscious has been there since the beginning, trying to convince him that John was the one for him, the one who he needed. Heck, it’d even somehow managed to force him to give an aborted confession of love.
He chuckles to himself, his voice deepening as he presses a kiss to the abused skin there and Sherlock moans.
Sherlock waits for the blow but finds himself being suddenly tugged out of the way. He experiences a gentle collision with a soft, fabric surface before a voice goes soaring over his head.
John gives a sad chuckle, shaking his head before lifting it from its perch on Sherlock’s collarbone.
John is gazing at him with such sincerity, such resoluteness that Sherlock is almost wondering why they haven’t kissed yet, why he hasn’t pressed his lips to John’s, sealing John’s promise with a kiss.
He’s leaning in before he realises it, John too in fact, bringing Sherlock forward with a gentle tug, pulling their bodies flush.
He remembers lying under dark skies, conjuring up meteors that crashed and burned their way towards the Earth’s surface.
, he types, pressing the “send” button with a flourish as he bundles John out of the lift, charging towards the waiting car.
“You said you knew what Moriarty was going to do next,” he continues, “What exact conclusion did you come to?”
"I mean… do you think things would have turned out better for us if we’d made different choices earlier on?”
“Merry Christmas to you too John! Oh it’s so nice to see you!” she says, leading him into the house.
He fixes Sherlock with a predatory grin, Sherlock’s breath hitching as he buries a hand in his curls, pulling his head downwards to meet him, their lips colliding once again.
John’s cheeks flush in turn, his eyes sparkling as he tugs on the chain of dog tags, drawing Sherlock closer as he bends his head forwards. He allows their foreheads to rest together for a moment, the two of them simply breathing into the same small space in between them before he aligns their lips, pressing them together.
He pauses, his thumb brushing across the long line of bone in reverence. There’s a purpling bruise on the left side from where he’d bitten it earlier, the crisscrossing lines of purple skin dark against Sherlock’s alabaster collarbone and something dark and territorial awakes in John’s chest.
“BECAUSE I NEED TO KNOW,” John snarls, his face livid as he fixes his eyes on Sherlock, slowing the car down to a crawl to address him properly.
However, Sherlock seemed to come back to himself the moment John’s eyes met his. He’d shaken his head, his eyes darkening once again as he’d lunged for John, dragging his head down to meet his lips in a bruising kiss.
“No, no it’s not,” John smiles, turning to face the man up from between his thighs, “I think it’s adorable.”
John nods in response, his eyelashes fluttering against Sherlock’s cheek, sending Sherlock’s heart pounding.
Sherlock sighs sadly, taking his seat beside John on the sofa as he wraps a warm arm around the man’s shoulder.
“NO IT WON’T BE SHERLOCK!” John cries, whipping his head around to glare at him, Sherlock fixing him with a stern look in turn, an eyebrow quirked upwards in a silent challenge.
“That confession… It was pretty selfish and oh god it sounded so possessive. I don’t actually think of you in that way. You’re not mine you’re-”
“For… for a lot of things,” John continues, fingers still reverently drawing patterns over Sherlock’s scars.
“Don’t worry about it,” Sherlock responds, stepping towards the bathroom as John flashes him one last soft grin before shutting the door.
Sherlock scowls, but there's little venom to it. He has hardly any time to respond before John attempts to whomp him in the stomach.
He knew that somewhere in Mind Palace he had that name hidden. He must have had some connections with John and his past. Judging by the behavior of his friend, their relationship ended in an unpleasant way. Painful for John. At one point Sherlock entered the right room. He remembered. He came across this name when he was checking Major Sholto's past. So Sebastian Moran was a soldier. A professional sniper. Group leader and John's friend in the army. They served in one camp and often went on missions together. Yes, everything made sense now as he looked at Moran. He saw old scars on his face. His body was still in excellent condition, although he sat in the secret service cell, for a long time. His behavior and movement remained the same as he had acquired during military training. Patience characterized snipers, and Moran was the perfect example. He was not discouraged and he pursued his goal despite unfavorable circumstances. He tirelessly watched John, his eyes never leaving him. He focused on completing the task. His task at the moment was to get his attention. Or maybe he was looking at John because at last, he had the opportunity to do it? Who knows why he came under the surveillance of the secret services and what they wanted to get out of him? What made John never mention him? But the most important question was - what did they have in common? Why was his friend so shocked to see Moran?
Indeed. Now, when he looked at the prints, each one was different from the rest. Sometimes they were minor discrepancies, and in other cases, he saw the differences without scrutinizing them. "Holmes! This could be it! If we get prints from the crime scene, maybe we can link them to someone specific."
To be honest I have one idea I have been thinking about for some time but I would like to know your opinion. Besides, I don't know if you would like it, which is why I would prefer to know in advance what you prefer to read about. Thank you, guys, for your comments and see you in the next chapter!
"... And by the way, I wanted to check something out of curiosity. I wanted to see how you are dealing with your roles and whether my dear brother will try to take what belongs to me again," Sherlock said, not caring about his upset brother.
"That's good. I was about to go there and say what I think about his experiments," she said in a less nervous tone.
Mycroft was also slowly losing patience. "I don't want to take your property, as you probably think of him." Sherlock's surprised look was contagious because he too was surprised by his own words. He fell silent, staring at his brother's shocked face. He had no idea how long it was before he could utter his voice again. He only managed to clear his throat and blink several times.
he wondered. Of course, what Sherlock did should not interest him, but he felt a bit betrayed by him. People can be uncritical of their behavior, but it is very easy for them to judge others, sometimes based on understatements or small details. These kinds of people were usually called hypocrites. John felt like one of them right now. He could easily justify his behavior with Mycroft, but at the same time he was surprised by Sherlock, and yet he had no reason to believe that something had happened between him and Molly. He did not want to remain silent and look like someone with such dilemmas, so he nodded and looked at Francesca. He took her small hand. He tried to ignore Molly's joy because he still had this strange feeling that did not let him enjoy the moment.
"You'll find everything you need in our wardrobe, John. There's a bathroom," he said, pointing at the door in the corner of the room. He passed the doctor, almost brushing him with his body, and returned to the living room.
Do you have sex? John couldn't ask him that. But he had to admit that he was interested in this side of Mycroft. It was good to know that he wasn't as distant and cool as he wanted to be. He had to admit that he liked the idea of discovering the real side of older Holmes more and more.
"If I publish a photo from my phone," Stoner continued, "our friends will find out that John likes to play both sides. He will have trouble and they will all start to feel sorry for you. They will comfort you, and you hate it as much as admit you make mistakes too". Aaron fell silent and stared at Mycroft. At one point he even felt sorry for him. He sighed and gave him a pleasant smile. "All right, I'll try to comfort you somehow. Relax a little bit, Myc," he said, ignoring Holmes's sharp look. He reached for the phone "I will write to your beautiful assistant that you are with me and your people do not have to worry so much." He wrote a message. When he looked up, Mycroft looked at him curiously. "I have tried to pick her up many times," he said, trying to satisfy his curiosity. "She is a tough one. She was still staring at her phone. Somehow I managed to get her number, but she never answers my flirting attempts."
The rest of the dinner went smoothly, and they did not return to this topic. They enjoyed spending time together. Mycroft avoided sensitive topics, as usual, sometimes forcing John to guess his thoughts. It didn't bother him, because he had already learned to live with geniuses. But John was discovering new things about him and had to admit that he was very happy to do it.
It's not like he was jealous ... Mycroft Holmes did not know this feeling. He got rid of the word at the very beginning when Sherlock was born. He was the parents' favorite. He could easily get their attention. A charming, intelligent child. Quite the opposite of proud, calm Mycroft. His jealousy gave way to protection because he wanted to see his reflection in his younger brother, he wanted to show him a love he did not experience himself - but the truth was he rejected this feeling. Sherlock was the dearest person in his life, he loved him, and yet he felt like whatever he would do, he would be compared with him. Of course, he was smarter and more perceptive but he secretly lacked what Sherlock had. Love, attention, and feelings of loved ones. Maybe that's why when he saw how John treated Sherlock, the spark of jealousy he had been trying to keep secret all his life, exploded with double force. For the first time in his life, he couldn't stand it and he expressed his feelings aloud. But it wasn't the worst of it. He wasn't mad at Sherlock, but at John. John, because he was more interested in him at that moment. He recognized the taste of something more than desire, he gained John's attention and his interest. He knew about it and took advantage of it. At the same time, he allowed himself to be carried away by this feeling. Sherlock would remain his brother, but John's attention was fragile. He was afraid his attention would disappear as soon as it started. Mycroft was terrified of being aware of his desires because he was starting to like what he despised until now.
After taking a shower and having breakfast in the living room, John wondered what to do that day. Visiting the city was not an option, because the morning was unbelievably hot, so he did not even want to imagine how it would be in the afternoon. He hoped Francesca would have time for him. Only she made his stay in Venice pleasant and he felt very comfortable with her. He loved Francesca's company and almost regretted not knowing her a dozen years earlier.
"That's how it was, my love..." he added. He stuck his nails into his thigh because the last word made him laugh almost as much as Mycroft's expression when he said it. He had to admit he loved to put this man in such awkward and embarrassing situations.
The cab had left Whitechapel and was going down the main street towards the west part of the city. The sight of the free space so different from the narrow streets of Whitechapel's district gave him new strength. He relaxed and, falling comfortably into the seat, continued his conversation with Holmes.
He wondered where he was. Was he shopping? Did he go to the bar with Lestrade? Or maybe he needed a moment alone? Each option seemed possible, and Sherlock couldn't stop thinking about it. He always had to know where John was, with whom and what he was doing. He knew he was possessive, but so far he had managed to hide it from a friend who had no idea that he was under constant observation. They lived every day as friends, and yet Sherlock somehow lied to him. He felt that way. He couldn't be honest with him. It killed him and hurt him every time he couldn't tell him about his feelings. Sometimes he wanted to embrace him instead of smiling and comforting him. Every morning he had to restrain himself so as not to touch his silver hair with his fingers when John was eating breakfast. It was also difficult for him to control his raging breath when they stood close and he could not touch him without giving a specific excuse. He wanted to show him without using words that he was always there for him. Always close. Always ready and carrying.
"The sooner the better. I need to talk to him before he comes up with some other ideas. He probably laments over his fate now and murders me in most painful and in the most sophisticated ways. It will be worse if he starts thinking about ... It will be better if he focuses on taking revenge without taking action.
His attention was caught by a boy in tattered clothes and with a flat cap on his head. He shouted those terrible words about the crime, and when someone approached him, he held out his hand, as if reminding that person that they had to pay for any information in London. Having received the appropriate amount of coins, he said something, pointed his finger at the eastern part of the city, then continued walking, informing other people of a 'terrible murder' that had been committed in a place that only he known.
"All right, but what about the conclusion that the murderer is of average height?" he kept asking. He liked the detective's way of thinking and wanted to hear more.
"If quick win were the most important thing," Aaron said, "it would be enough to take the phone, delete a photo, and throw the CD into the canal under the window."
"Then we're both depraved because I like the idea, too," he said quietly, running the tip of his tongue over John's ear.
It was even stranger. John raised an eyebrow and completely focused his attention on Mycroft. The older man wasn't feeling very comfortable and it was very visible. He cleared nervously his throat and tried to avoid John's eyes.
"You think I'm glad to be separated from Mr. Holmes, and I don't have to ... as you said, train my patience and self-abnegation. However, the truth is that Mr. Holmes asked me to act incognito. I am not happy to follow the instructions I get over the cell phone. I'd rather hear what I should do face to face. "
"You know what, Mycroft? Nobody has ever made me laugh so hard. I would never have guessed that you would be that person who does this" he said with amused. He shook his head and drank tea from his cup.
They noticed a strange scene next to their door. Apparently, the hotel was getting ready to receive new guests. The staff cleaned the apartment next to John and Mycroft's rooms. This view caught the attention of Holmes, who stopped moving and watched the room service. The heavy and oak doors kept opening and closing. Some of the cleaners washed a red carpet on their knees.
"I don't remember having an argument or another reason, so why did you disappear?" Sebastian's voice was not so harsh and cold anymore, "Why did you leave me?"
"Is this your first time?" Mycroft asked in a slightly surprised tone. He was sitting in a typical position. With crossed legs and comfortably spread out on the seat. He watched John with sharp eyes. "I thought Francesca showed you all the charms of Venice ..."
The genius flinched at the words but remained silent. Perhaps he did not know what to say, perhaps he was a little overwhelmed, or perhaps he was just surprised by this sudden confession. John was wondering if anyone had ever dared tell him this before. Perhaps some girl when he was a teenager, but he couldn't imagine anyone having the courage to do it now. Seeing Mycroft's surprised face and how he tried to understand the situation, John struggled with his thoughts. He was sure his decision was right, but his feelings told him something else now. However, acting under the influence of impulses, especially in this situation, had no right to exist. He had to act as he had decided earlier. He looked down. He rubbed his eyes hard, fearing his next words.
He gave Aaron a withering look. The sneaky smile on the other man's face made him want to hit him here and now. His face was very close and John forced himself to stay in place. He took a few deep breaths and relaxed his muscles. Aaron seemed to feed on his stress and enjoy seeing his nervousness. He was still staring into John's blue eyes, pretending to be innocent.
He hears an audible sigh emanating from the bedroom (the walls were never really that thick) and the rustling of fabric as John shifts about on the bed, probably preparing to attack the scones.
John lets his hands loose after a moment, taking pity on the man and Sherlock’s hands reach out to rest on John’s shoulders, scrabbling for purchase as John continues to rake his hands across Sherlock’s scalp, licking into his mouth.
Stroking the scratches and indents there carefully, Sherlock sighs, smiling ruefully as he tucks them back into his shirt.
Next update in 3 weeks because I'm getting my A level results back on friday and I don't know how I will feel about that haha.
That seems to jolt his lover back to reality, John’s head giving a little twitch as he fixes his eyes on Sherlock. He shifts towards the corner of the sill, patting the open spot next to him.
He gives them a hard tug this time and Sherlock groans, his Adam’s apple bobbing up and down as his hips rise up off the bed.
Sherlock forces himself back to reality and says, “I guess I’ll just go and drag your chair out, shall I?” giving a sheepish smile as he does so, “wasn’t too hard the last time.”
He finds his prostrate again easily enough, Sherlock letting out a loud groan into the cavern of John’s mouth when he does so and John smiles against Sherlock’s lips, dipping his tongue inwards to intertwine it with Sherlock’s as he hits the man’s prostrate over and over again.
John freezes, letting the gravity of the situation settle. There’s absolute silence between the two of them, Sherlock staring at him, stock still and unmoving as John blinks… once… twice…
Most of the ride is spent scowling and moping as John tries to offer him with some comfort despite being equally tense, resting a reassuring hand on his thigh as Sherlock continues to stare out of the window.
“I’m not an addict. I’m a user,” Sherlock explains, hoping to hedge the situation a little by avoiding the main topic of conversation, “I alleviate boredom and occasionally heighten my thought processes-”
? He rests his head in his palms, distressed in every sense of the word. He has to do this, has to do this for John, maybe not right now but he'll have to do it eventually. He’s got to bring John back to his senses. He will convince John that Mary is the one for him, even if he has to paint himself as worthless in the process and oh god he’s going to cry isn’t he?
He suddenly feels those fingertips press sharper into his skin, nails now scratching a hard line down his scalp and Sherlock shivers in ecstasy at the sensation.
They bite down sharply on his collarbone, startling Sherlock into a muffled scream as he raises his legs, tightening his hold on their body so that his slender legs bracket strong thighs.
Sherlock turns, his giggles subsiding as he comes face to face with a very annoyed looking Mrs Hudson.
“You’ve been acting weird since yesterday evening. I’ve never seen you… so upset before,” Sherlock’s brow furrows, “Did something happen?”
“So how long will you be-” Mrs Hudson carries on. Sherlock can see that John is tensing up, his left hand is clenching and unclenching again. He has to do something… oh.
The sound of a wooden chair scraping against ceramic tiles fills the air as John rises from his seat, making his way over to Sherlock.
He feels the wind in his hair as the silence draws him in. The feeling of finality on that dreadful day envelops him as he once again takes a step off that ledge, plummeting to the ground like a bird with clipped wings.
He sighs in exasperation, fearing that one day his impulsivity will be the end of him if he keeps going on like this.
He moans involuntarily, however, when John tugs at the waistband of his trousers, clinging onto him for dear life as John cups his still-clothed erection, stroking it slowly.
He’d grown up in a household that hadn’t exactly been supportive of that kind of thing so he’d kept himself closeted. And even though he was now technically free from the punishing constraints of his family, he’d still been loath to come out.
“-but you?” John shakes his head, flashing Sherlock a broad grin, “You were something else entirely. It took me a while to sort all of that out.”
The query startles Sherlock for a moment, leaving him slightly taken aback before his brain kicks into overdrive, his mind spinning as he ponders over whether he should tell John the truth about the mission or if he should lie.
Every dawn had brought some form of new heartache for him. He remembers it now. The way his heart had seemed to crumble to dust every day at the sight of John and Mary’s invitations, John and Mary’s floral arrangements, John and Mary’s guests, John and Mary’s-
Sherlock set his fork down and placed his hand on John’s. To his surprise and delight, John didn’t flinch away. In fact, he flipped his hand so that their fingers entwined.
but it was a near thing. He did inhale when he meant to exhale, and spent an entire minute clearing his lungs.
Another possibility insidiously whispered inside his head, but he willfully shut it down and ignored it. One trauma at a time was enough to deal with.
Sherlock’s hands stilled for a brief second before continuing their ministrations.  “As you wish. Don’t fall asleep, we have Facetime scheduled with Mycroft in 30 minutes.”
His wish is my command. It’s always been that way. His happiness, his desires, his needs… have always been my top priority. I’ve been told many times, by people with some authority, that our relationship is codependent and one-sided. I prefer to think of it as unconditional and accepting.
Finally, at 6:04 pm, John snapped. He threw down his paperback and barked, “Bored!” in a truly unsettling imitation of his flatmate. He jumped to his feet and started pacing, rubbing his hands through his hair and creating a hedgehog like appearance.
John knelt at his feet and gathered up the spilled food; nothing had been broken and everything was easily salvageable. He was hyper-aware of Sherlock’s proximity as he worked. The smells surrounding him evoked strong memories: a hint of tobacco, an aroma reminiscent of formaldehyde, a musty odor that brought to mind piles of books and loose papers… and underneath all those familiar scents, the faint tang of honey.
“Christ, Sherlock,” John groaned, recapturing Sherlock’s mouth and trying to give as good as he was getting. He had no idea what Sherlock’s sexual or romantic history consisted of, but sex most *definitely* didn’t alarm him.
Sherlock kept a firmly unreadable expression on his face as he held up the placard, glanced at the cake, then locked eyes with John expectantly.
“Sherlock,” John tried, only for Sherlock to plunder his mouth with his tongue, coming dangerously close to breaking his own rule. John managed to turn his head to the side, only to get that tongue in his ear.
He is a good man. I believe it is time for me to step away, and leave him to his happiness. He is in good hands, now. It’s time to let go of the task I’ve assigned myself since childhood.
“You won’t get any argument from me, Sherlock. I think it’s simply horrendous. Not to mention unattractive.”
Sherlock stumbled out of his room at 10 am the next morning, feeling groggy and sluggish. He yawned and rubbed his eye, making his way towards the heavenly aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Bless John and his tendency to tend to others’ needs as well as his own. He was a far better man than Sherlock could ever hope to be.
Sherlock stiffened. He turned, and John’s heart almost broke at the tentative (hopeful?) look on his face.
Sherlock drew himself up, armour settling into place. He blinked, and all arousal fled from his face. As if it had never been. He donned his trademark haughty expression, shifting away from John and creating “acceptable” space between them. It was, frankly, quite terrifying how quickly he could change personas. It left John wondering what was real, and what was mimicry.
Back at Holmes Manor, night had fallen once again. Like it had thousands of times before. The workers had left hours ago, leaving the sole inhabitant alone. The apparition floating before the bathroom mirror studied its own reflection. The perpetual expression of melancholy seemed to have lifted just a bit, softening the ghostly features. Marjorie Holmes tilted her head.
A sultry, smooth voice curls from the corner of the room, startling Mike before he realises who the owner of the voice is.
“Well unfortunately for you, I appear to be quite clueless as to the reason for your presence today,” Sherlock replies with a deliberately neutral voice, “So do enlighten me, god knows you enjoy it so.”
“Sherlock…” John murmurs, warm morning breath caressing Sherlock’s ear, “Could you please get that.”
“She yelled about how bad a husband I was, about how I was a bad father and how I should come home instead of hanging out with my-”
“What do you mean?” John murmurs, turning back to his dinner, twirling his noodles absentmindedly with his chopsticks.
“Tell us about your relationship with Jemima,” Sherlock cuts in, he hates it when people bombard his head with information that is most definitely unimportant to the success of an investigation.
“Funny thing is,” she continues, “Even though I was the chosen one… Magnussen was still standing in my way. He had unbearably large heaps of dirt on me that could have easily exposed me as the successor to the Moriarty title. And that could not have been allowed to happen.”
They lie there for a moment, struggling to catch their breaths as John shifts off, tumbling onto the space of bed beside him.
They have a child for god’s sake! Of course John would have regretted it if he hadn’t gone back to her. And he’d always wanted to be a father, something that Sherlock will never, in his wildest dreams, hope to offer him.
Next update in three weeks? haha. I have a lot of university stuff I need to deal with first so this is going to take a while... Also, I'm working on something special too! (((You'll find out what it is soon)))
Sherlock knows that he’s just trying to bait him, to rile him up but he decides to humour him. “So you’re saying that killing the person she loved the most was what was best for her?” he shoots back.
Rolling up his sleeves, Sherlock draws up the stool, seating himself right by John’s head resting up against the back of the tub. John’s eyes are closed, revelling in the warmth of the water, a soft smile plastered on his face and Sherlock sighs.
“Huh,” Watson hums, mulling over Sherlock’s statement for a moment before replying, “She’s far too good for him.”
There are also sketches of some of the more famous constellations on the ceiling, drawn on in black permanent marker, much to the chagrin of his mother. They’ve all been neatly labelled, each constellation paired with its own special name, scrawled onto the ceiling in a messy scribble.
He should be happy that he made the correct decision for once, that John can now be happy and live a fulfilling life with Mary and their child. And yet-
“He was high before he got on the plane,” Mycroft intones, turning to face Sherlock as John’s face falls, “Nobody deceives like an addict.”
“James Moriarty isn’t back in the form of a man, but rather someone or a few others have taken over the title, operating as if they’re Moriarty.”
“Are you sure?” Watson questions, his eyes clouded with worry as Sherlock turns back to look at him, fixing him with a reassuring look.
And this time, it’s not really Watson standing there, even though the man is in the garb to prove it, but rather it’s John, John Watson from the real world and Sherlock plans to address him as such.
Is this how John talks to his lovers? Is this how it feels like to be loved by John Watson? With the exception of the night when they danced, he’s only ever seen the stoic, emotionally controlled side of John. This lust-addled, carnal-driven version of him though, is something he’s never come across.
Since then, there’d been longing stares in classrooms, corridors, lecture halls, you name it. However, all of them had gone by in a flash, disappearing all too soon like a fleeting daydream and John wasn’t really sure if he’d imagined all of this or if it’d been real.
John’s laughter slowly segues into static silence as he fixes his eyes back on Sherlock’s, an invisible lock holding their gazes together. “God, I’ve missed you,” he whispers, but in the quiet of the flat, the words seem to reverberate across the walls, a sonorous proclamation meant for just the two of them alone.
“Someday,” John murmurs, licking the shell of his ear, “Someday I’ll have my cock inside that lovely arse of yours.”
He flashes Sherlock a warm smile before inclining his head towards the door, beckoning Sherlock to follow him.
“Is this real?” he murmurs all of a sudden, remembering something… similar... from another place and time. Although, right now he’s not exactly sure what that is.
Their faces are now inches from each other, Sherlock’s eyes locked firmly onto John’s for a solid second before he’s twisting away from John again, their bodies turning back out to face each other, moving in time with the music as they sashay around the room. John’s hand slips lower to Sherlock’s waist, clutching the curve of his hip tightly as the music thrums in Sherlock’s ears, setting his skin ablaze.
The leader of the meeting swallowed but did not show any nervousness. "The chance for this mission to succeed is thirty to thirty-five percent."
"You kept your distance at the beginning," John reminded him with a smile. "You didn't know how you should treat me and you didn't understand some of my behavior ..." he said, putting the bottle down. He rested his elbows on the cold balustrade.
John pursed his lips, "Imagine I don't lead him on a leash," he said, but seeing Sherlock's face, he decided to explain to him what he meant. "It means I don't control what he does, and I don't have control over what he thinks and feels."
Sherlock got up from the chair. He went to the door and, although it was warm outside, he grabbed the coat hanging on the door. "Boring," he said, passing the surprised inspector. "An ordinary murder, without imagination or robbery. Ideal for a warm summer's day." He hung the coat over his hand and put the other one on the doorknob.
"Don't worry, I don't have that specific information about you. About your..." he stopped, nodding his head and looking at his brother's penis meaningfully, "I was improvising."
The moment he turned toward the door, Sherlock suddenly spoke to him after three days of silence. "John... Don't let him wrap you around his finger. He's not as holy and virtuous as he claims to be. If Mycroft, you know ... if he tries something ..."
Crumpled bedding, pillows lying on the ground, and a bed that was shifted - not much, but still. What's more, his friend, dearest friend ... had dried sweat on his skin, matted hair and was naked from the waist up. He couldn't look at the other man. He felt disgusted and knew that if he cast one glance at him, he could not bear the tension that made his whole body freeze.
Sherlock saw the look. He froze in place when he was putting a half-rolled pillow under his hips. "John? Are you okay?" he asked, and his face changed instantly. "You... don't want to?"
"Mycroft, do you realize this problem concerns both of us, not just you?" John's sharp tone made the older man finally focus his attention on him. He looked at John, leaned back and bent his elbow on the back of the chair. The bright light from the screen fell on his white shirt and rolled-up sleeves. He looked more pale than usual. John was waiting for an answer with irritation and impatience.
"The one where you make out with your husband's brother in an unambiguous way." His soft voice made John more nervous than the way he pretended to be concerned. "I gained it not without someone's help," he added and gave Molly a meaningful look. The girl looked away.
John was sure his friend had a small smile on his face. He knew his guesses were true when Sherlock spoke up. "That's right," he replied in a slightly amused tone.
"For God's sake, John! Act your age! You are no longer a child. Running away from problems won't solve anything! I know you leave Baker Street after quarrels and this is your way to relieve tension, but you can't do it every time! " Mycroft couldn't stand it. For the first time, he let negative emotions prevail over him in John's presence. But John didn't look scared. He stood with a hard face, tightly closed lips and frowns. He stared at him, but he didn't seem like he was about to leave the room.
"Buon giorno, signore," the receptionist said with a slight nod as he faced the older man. He smiled friendly as always and wanted to start a conversation, but Mycroft asked him first.
John's heart skipped a beat for a split second. However, he immediately felt a twinge and disappointment. He hoped for a moment that Sherlock would replace the word 'London' with 'to you'. He rebuked himself for it because, despite the time, this strange hope was still burning in him, which he should have abandoned many years earlier.
At first, Mycroft felt only the pleasure of John's kiss and body heat. He even allowed himself to deepen the kiss but finally realized what was happening. He tried to free himself from John's strong hands, but despite the difference in height, he could not compete with him. John was strong and extremely determined to get his way. He sucked on Mycroft's mouth, not letting him say a word. The older man managed to free himself only when he felt John's knee started to rub against his groin.
Sherlock shrugged. "You may keep it," he said nonchalantly, and John chuckled softly. He was also in a good mood. They walked in silence for a long moment, not talking about the flowers, the kiss or the stalker. They patiently followed Molly, who was thrilled to choose the right gift for her admirer. Several times they stopped at street traders' stands, but nothing they had to offer appealed to Molly's not-so-sophisticated taste.
He was mad at himself because he reacted to John this way. It was doctor's fault, he cast a spell on him and although he tried to break free from him, there was no way out. His only hope of regaining balance and sober thinking was to completely cut off from John for a long time. But this was only possible after returning to London. If he had to be honest, he had been counting down the days and hours for that moment. He dreamed of a day when he would not wake up next to his calm expression. John's face haunted him. He saw John every time he closed his eyes. He wanted to throw away the memories, but at the same time keep them somewhere deep, buried in his mind so that he could remember them again. He was going crazy. He believed it was the only proper word to describe his condition. He told himself it was nothing but a mere temporary feeling. It was caused only because he stopped being careful. It was dangerous to be with John. He destroyed his self-control. He started to have very strange ideas because of him. When John was close to him, he felt the feelings and emotions that he had already forgotten about. Now he understood Sherlock's behavior, he knew why his brother had changed so much since he met the inconspicuous doctor. John Watson had a tough personality that allowed him to change people, slowly but successfully. And Mycroft wasn't going to let him do the same to him.
