It did feel like he was thinking that a lot recently. Today, especially. But what could he do? Tony felt like he had made his feelings clear. Steve was one of those ‘waiting for my soulmate’ types. Tony couldn’t blame him. Whoever Captain America’s soulmate was… well, they were guaranteed to be as amazing as Steve himself, right? Tony very obviously didn’t fit
In the space of a second, Steve turned towards Tony, grabbing the man’s right cheek with his left hand and pulling Tony’s head into his own chest and shoulders. Steve continued moving until his back was entirely to the reporters, completely covering Tony with his body. Steve braced for impact a millisecond before it happened. He felt the brick impact his back with enough force that Steve was absolutely sure it would have broken Tony’s face open. He didn’t want to think about it. He was equal parts angry at the man that had attacked them and relieved that Tony was safe.
“I’d prefer it if you kept this quiet for a little while,” Steve said. “I haven’t really spoken to him yet, so I’d like to have some time.”
With you, always, Steve imagined saying. If he was braver. If he felt like he could risk it all. Then Tony was gone, and Steve had missed his chance even though he’d promised. He ran his hands through his hair and over his eyes.
Daredevil pocketed it. “Don’t know how much I’ll be joining you. I mostly work at night.” He grinned.
“Morning, beautiful,” Tony said as he grabbed the cup of coffee from Steve’s hand. “My two favorite people to see bright and early.” He took a quick sip to test the temperature as he ran his free hand down Steve’s forearm, squeezing gently. “Thanks, Cap. You’re the best.”
“Actually, no. School’s overrated.” Tony pointed at Cassie hopefully. “Can you tell Billy and Tommy to give Wanda a call? I’m supposed to check in on them.”
Tony had touched him this morning. Their hands had definitely brushed against each other when Steve was handing out breakfast. He was sure of it. Absolutely
Steve’s voice immediately cleared out his head. Tony replied using the same private channel, “This is ridiculous. Only some of them are coming from the sewers. There’s gotta be another source.”
What was worse was traffic was getting heavier, more people were walking into the battle zone without realizing they were heading that way, and soon enough they had an actual crisis on their hands. It was five o’clock on a Wednesday. People were simply not prepared to handle this many major streets being overrun by tiny menacing bots. Tony didn’t know why battles always had to happen at inconvenient times, and he didn’t mind saying so, either.
As Tony leaned forward, his feet slid off Steve’s lap. “You’re smiling. What are you thinking about?”
(TW/CW) of LGBTQIA+ self-harm and suicide rates. Other more informal data corroborates the mental and emotional strain this marginalized 4/?
He was getting too distracted. That wasn’t unusual, but today was different. Normally Tony just had to deal with thinking about other modifications and upgrades he wanted to work on. Most of the time, his hands moved on their own while his mind focused on other tasks. He’d even gone on conference calls while holding onto tools, fine-tuning multiple projects at once.
Tony thought about how often he was photographed. How often his face was used as promotional materials for Stark Industries and Avengers events. Maybe the board had a point about it changing the image of the company. He couldn’t process it.
Foggy stood up so quickly his knees banged into the edge of the small table he’d been hoarding like gold at one of the busiest Starbucks in the area. “Holy shit,” he breathed. “Holy shit, Matt. That’s Captain America.”
She held up a finger, not looking at him. “No. As we have discussed at length, it was your choice to do those loops and whatever that twirly thing in front of those kids was.”
As the reporters laughed some more, a few shaking their heads at Tony’s predictable antics, one of the men from the group in the back stepped forward. “You’re laughing,” he said, loudly enough to be noticed. “You’re laughing but my business is destroyed!”
Pietro gave Steve an unimpressed, highly judgmental look. “Of course his soulmate would take his side.”
Peter’s head snapped up, quickly looking over his shoulder to where J. Jonah Jameson was sitting in his office, pointing directly at him.
Tony’s back stiffened. “I…” He shook his head. “I’m busy, Cap. I’m working on this new upgrade. I’ve gotta get it finished.”
This was it. Today was the day he finally got his soulmark. Technically, yesterday. But he had it—that was what mattered. His soulmate was the person he’d dreamed about. It couldn’t have worked out more perfectly. Except for the media frenzy, but Steve knew it couldn’t go on for too much longer.
Steve frowned at Bucky. “But you didn’t.” He gestured to Natasha. “You found each other. Regardless of time travel and mind control and spy organizations all doing their best to keep you apart, you still found each other.”
“Now for our meeting with the most famous throuple in the world. It is throuple, isn’t it?” Tony pointed between the three of them, looking for confirmation.
Steve was right, as usual. In another five minutes, they started the debriefing, which went fairly smoothly. Tony was on his phone for some of it, only half-listening as he dealt with approving a few new designs for Stark Industries to begin testing. He made a few minor technical notes on issues he knew would pop up. It was easy enough to do alongside the briefing since he didn’t have any new information to add about the battle.
Tony slowly spun the milkshake glass around and around with his gauntleted hand, eyes focused on the condensation collecting on the table. “Were you?”
“How egotistical do you have to be to name everything after yourself?” Sam got up for another piece of pizza. “Soon enough we’re going to hear Latveria is Doom Country or some shit. It’s already got Doomstadt.”
Steve grinned. “Point. Oh, we have to be at a press conference tomorrow morning about the fight. It’s fine if only a few of us go.”
“So, what do you want me to do? Avoid everyone I piss off?” Tony laughed, self-deprecating and cruel. “I have some news for you, Cap. I piss off a lot of people. You want me to stay in the tower unless I have my big, strong super soldier to protect me?”
“And besides all of that, we’ve still got these fake doombots to deal with. Don’t think I’ve forgotten about that paparazzi pizza guy, either. There’s a lot going on, Steve. It’s been kind of hard for me to really process everything.” Tony licked his lips. “I guess that’s on me. But I just don’t feel comfortable starting a relationship now. I need some time.”
“Just come with me, Paul,” Steve tries again. Millimeters, now. He can feel the barrel touch his finger. If he lunges he can rip it away from Paul. Just a little more…
Tony is quiet again for a few seconds, and then he says, “We don’t actually have any pictures together. I googled it. Not one.”
Steve puts his hands on either side of the check for a moment, threatening to tear it in half, but he stops. Tony’s right. He could just donate the remainder to charity. He doesn’t have to keep it, or benefit from it in any way.
The guy leaves, and when Steve hears the door click closed he gets up immediately and goes to the bathroom to run a shower. He tries not to look at his reflection in the mirror, knowing his body is bruised. It always is after his Monday appointment, so he doesn’t need to see it again, for dozenth time.
He lives in a dingy, one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn where the train rattles his room every time it comes by. He hates it there, but it’s been a place he can call home since he was old enough to have his own place. Maybe one day he’ll move into a nicer part of town. Maybe one day pigs will fly.
“Uh, okay,” Steve agrees. He stands up, dusts himself off, and his surprised when Tony comes up behind him and brushes sawdust off his shirt. He walks away nonchalantly, leading the way to the elevator. They ride up to the 51
His towel had fallen off him in the night, but he disregards it as he walks through the house and puts on a pot of coffee before going to get dressed. He sleep-walks his way into a pair of pants and shoves his feet into socks before finding a comfortable shirt he can stand to work in.
He mostly drew Tony doing whatever it was Tony did, but sometimes he would draw other things, like the delivery boy who caught them having sex on the couch when the guard shack had let him up unannounced, or the cleaning lady who wrinkled her nose when she found a condom under the bed while Steve was grabbing his phone off the nightstand.
When it’s all said and done, Steve swipes his card for the suit and then heads for the car. He takes a minute to get a burger from a drive through before making his way to the studio, glad to see that the workers are still setting up. He leaves the suit in the car and grabs his package from the trunk.
Steve nods again, and the elevator slides shut, and suddenly he’s alone in this big room. He takes a breath, trying to get in the mood to start shaping up the wood slab. He walks towards the pile of supplies and starts to sort out what’s what, moving what he doesn’t need immediately and standing finally in front of the slab with a pencil and a ruler in his hands.
“I realized that our impromptu agreement didn’t over the details in full,” Tony says as they get back on the elevator. “Payment, what you’re sculpting, that sort of thing.”
“Just greeting an old friend,” Paul says, and then he sticks his hand out to Tony. “Paul Swanson. I’m sure you’ve heard a lot about me.”
The drive to Stark Tower takes about an hour, but when he gets there he’s glad that Tony isn’t home right now. His message from earlier said he’d be back by eight, but Steve really, really wants to be done before Tony sees him. He just wants to go home and sleep this pain off.
“I have to go,” Steve says, this time it’s definite. He can’t stay. He’s leaving. He may never see Tony again. This is goodbye.
Steve’s cheeks burn red, but he rolls his eyes despite his embarrassment. He doesn’t ask about his appearance again, because he doesn’t want the heart monitor to read the way his heart jumps when Tony says sappy stuff like that. He may never stop, if he knows that Steve
But Steve isn’t giving in. He seems to know the phone call had to do with him, and he wants to know why.
He quickly averts his eyes to the floor, trying not to get caught watching. It must have worked because when he looks up again, Tony has moved through the crowd and is walking away from him. He sighs in relief, even though he’s not sure why he was worried to begin with, and then takes a few uncertain steps before he decides to follow behind Tony. He wants to hear the man’s comments on the artwork. Maybe he just wants to hear him talk. He isn’t sure.
Steve blinks, then he bites his lip. “Well, usually I look for extravagant billionaires to sell sculptures to,” he jokes.
It only takes a few seconds for the feeling of being alone to creep up into Steve’s head. He begins to think, and the thinking causes him to worry. He can’t remember the car accident, but for some reason, Tony’s behavior about it concerns him.
He measures off the top foot of the wood, since Tony stature won’t need all eight feet of the block. He’d going to leave the bottom foot of wood for a base and then whittle the extra inches off as he works. He’s also going to cut the block in half long-ways, which will give him two, two-foot thick sections. He probably won’t even need the other section, but it’s good to have in case he royally screws up in the beginning.
Tony bites his lip for a second. “I think he was just trying to scare you,” he says after a moment. “He wanted you to know that he thinks he’s still in control.”
“You filed a report about two months ago about your apartment being broken into. At the time, you said you didn’t know who had done it.”
They also don’t talk about Tony’s childhood, because from what Steve can tell, it wasn’t all rainbows and ponies. Tony had let slip once that his father was an authoritarian, his way or the highway, and at some point he’d briefly chosen the highway before being drug back home. But that was all he’d ever mentioned of his parents.
He opens the door slowly and tries not to meet Tony’s eyes. It only takes about ten seconds to reach the front door of the bar, but when he gets there, the night air is chilly. He walks to his car, ignoring the pain in his chest, and drives towards home. He doesn’t even realize he’s crying until a wet tear slides down his cheek.
Tony laughs, and it sounds almost nervous. “The sculpture is of me,” he begins. “I want it to show my good side,” he says, pointing to his left, as if it somehow more perfect than his right. “And the rest of me, too. Head to toe.”
Steve looks at Tony out of the corner of his eye. He looks rigid still, but somewhat calmer now that they’re standing together. Steve wonders if this is the first time Tony has been held at gun point, because if it is, he’s handling it very well.
Steve looks around, seeing Paul’s bloody face as the officers handcuff him. He definitely broke the man’s nose, that’s for sure. Paul still looks dazed, as if he can’t believe what has happened.
When he makes it back outside, the valet runs to get his car and pulls it around a few moments later. Steve gets in and drives away quickly, trying to stop the tears from forming in the corners of his eyes. A mix of pain and confusion, and maybe a little bit of fear runs through him. He wipes his face, not sure why he’s crying. It doesn’t make sense. He’s not sad.
Tony’s fingers trail along Steve’s chest, stopping to rest on a particularly interesting part of his rib cage.
“Not yet,” Steve says back, circling the base of Tony’s erection to stave off his orgasm. It takes a second, but finally Tony regains a bit of composure. “I want you to fuck me, Tony. Think you can?”
Steve rolls his eyes. “Then let’s take pictures,” he says. “We can take some at the gallery tonight.”
“Easy, really. I am a technical genius, by the way. I could probably find you anywhere on this whole planet and not lose a second of sleep.”
Steve blushes a little, but he shakes his head. “I just…am worried that you don’t know enough about me, about the things I’ve done.”
He rubs his neck as he stands in front of the block of wood, finally taking a breath and forcing himself to get a hold of his thoughts. He takes out his measuring tape and begins to draw Tony’s form on the wood, this time in perfect, precise lines. He leaves an extra few inches so he will have enough space to carve out detail, but eventually he has the body drawn and is ready to saw off the excess.
Finally, Monday, was Paul. The only client Steve didn’t even remotely enjoy seeing. Paul was a sadist and he had blown through all the other guys at the gay bar Steve usually picked up clients at until striking up a deal with Steve for a weekly meeting. Paul had control issues and needed to be in charge. He also liked that Steve would pretend he enjoyed what was done to him. Five hundred a week from Paul didn’t seem like nearly enough when the man had his hand squeezed around Steve’s sensitive member, but it paid the bills and until he found a better Monday client, Paul was all he had.
“Steve,” Tony tries, his voice coming off like a warning. Steve is against the table so he can’t back up any further, but Tony takes another step forward, and then another. His hand is on Steve’s chest, flat against his shirt. His other hand comes up and lands on Steve’s arm just above the elbow. They stand there like that for what could have been hours.
“What kind of suit?” Adam asks, splaying his hands across the whole shop. “Are you getting married finally, or preparing for a funeral?”
Tony would bring him meals in bed and spoon feed him like a baby. They’d sit curled up together for hours, but Steve would almost always wake up alone and hear Tony in the other room on the phone or clacking away on his computer. He didn’t like how much time Tony was devoting to finding Paul. It seemed like Tony had developed a fixation, and it didn’t seem healthy.
Tony nods, understanding. He knows that this is Steve’s first day off in a long time, so he doesn’t pester him anymore. “I’ll be back by lunch,” Tony says hopefully. “Will my man have me a sandwich made?”
“Tony,” Steve says after about three minutes has gone by. “I am so sorry but I won’t be able to take you to breakfast. Something important came up.” His tone is terse, and the way his face tenses up when Tony walks over to him begins to worry Tony.
Steve just grins. “Sorry. I couldn’t help myself.” He presses closer to Tony, their lips meeting in a light embrace. When Steve finally takes a step back, Tony huffs a little.
When the drawings were up on the wall and took a step back to admire. It actually looked pretty good. The lighting here wasn’t bad and his color scheme fit well with the background of the wall. All in all, even if no one bought his work, it was still nice to have it on display.
When he gets home, he pulls himself out of the car and then manages to kick his apartment door shut behind himself. He goes straight to the bathroom and pulls off his shirt, looking at the ugly bruise that has formed on his stomach. He knows he should probably go get it checked out, but he doesn’t want to. He just wants to go lie down and think about Tony, like he does every night.
Steve is shocked when he arrives outside and Tony is waiting along with a convoy. A car in front, and a car behind. He doesn’t comment on it as Tony helps him into the car, but when the door shuts and Tony goes to the driver’s side, Steve looks around and wonders why anyone would go through so much trouble for him.
Tony has pictured it so many times. Paul hitting Steve’s car, then getting out and running away. It makes him sick just thinking about it. He can’t even fathom how many times Steve let the guy hurt him before it became too much. Tony had only seen evidence of it once before the accident, the night of their first kiss, and that was enough to make his blood boil.
“ So do we all know why we are here?” Sam asked the three battered and bruised people who were adjusting the ice packs over their bodies.
Tony scoffed.  “ But something does bother me though. Nick said he was never caught by Hydra, but he knew to put his arm out for a blood pressure. I’m probably over thinking it, but I still find it-“
Everyone nodded. It was strange that the two had a sudden change of heart and were more amicable toward one another.
‘ What the fuck?’ Harry thought. He needed to get him home or Stark was going to kill him if Peter got hurt.
Rhodey was much like his Rhodey. He was nice to him and cared for him. One day he even picked out his clothing for him. He noticed what he was doing and explained he sometimes did it for the other Tony. He didn’t mind. It reminded him of his Rhodey. However, he was dating Sam, which was different. His Rhodey was definitely heterosexual. Rhodey said it was nothing serious and that it was more of a friends with benefits type of thing. But Tony doubt that. Sam seemed pretty attached to him and Handsy.
Steve was about to retort when the door bursted open violently. Steve rolled on top of Tony to protect him and looked at the intruder. That mother fucker.
Steve gave him a disbelieving look and sighed. “ Tony I love you but we are not getting a divorce and we are definitely not getting a llama.”
“ - crap. I feel like I’m being smothered and that Steve and Grant don’t trust me to take care of myself. Also, the fighting. They are always fighting. It always “ Tony I’m better” and jabs and insults. And I’m just getting tired of it.”
“ Bambino!” Tony saw a little old woman speed walking to him in her expensive heels. She was as graceful as the day she last saw her.
Nat rolled her eyes. “ He is trying to be friends with you and you keep pushing him away. What is wrong with you?”
“ Right... that’s good and all, but why do you guys still want me here? I’m not apart of your little after school club. I was here to help and that’s all. I did my job and now I’m going home.”
And that had pissed Bucky off since even though he was raping me whenever he wanted he still asked my permission for that and I told him no. That I never done it before and had no interest.
Winghead gave a small whine as he stretched out further over the railing in an attempt to gain Tony’s attention.  Tony turned to him and began stretching his head.
“ I like it better when you were able to get drunk. You were always such a funny drunk, especially after what those French women did.”Greg laughed as he told Bucky.
“ The purpose of me suggesting Sam is so that I don’t need to be here Tony. He was trained for this kind of work. I am not. That’s why I never wen to school for it.”
Tony looked at him with mock offense, “ I’ll have you know motor oil smoothies are Dum-E’s specialty and coffee is the drink of the gods!”
Speaking of the Commander, him and the rest of the team should be arriving soon. They were all moving to the estate temporarily in order to avoid the press. Those vultures have been prowling  outside the gates since midnight and it was annoying as hell.
After assessing him. Dr. Strange turned to him, “ Any health conditions or mediations  I should be aware of?”
“ Stark did you find him? Where is he? We are worried here at the base.” Coulson said frantically as if he were really worried. ‘Correction’, Tony thought. ‘You were the one that was worried.’
“ Yes, your majesty. I also wanted to see if he was acceptable last night. I can always take him back and give you a full refund.”
The other Steve, dressed in a Hydra version of the Captain America uniform, looked at Tony, a small smile on his face. “ I know how important this lab is to you. I won’t ever purposely destroy it. This asshole however,” he turns To glare at the other Steve, “ he was just fine leaving you in Siberia.”
At that moment the wall to their right was crashed open as three familiar figures made their way through. “ Party’s over guys.”
Tony’s eyes widened. “ My, my Commander. I’m surprised that you are so forward. I thought such thoughts were forbidden in your generation.”
He felt a tug at his neck as his collar was lightly tugged from the leash attached to it. He looked and saw that the group he was with was moving.
Tony was at the side of the enclosure when Winghead emerged, hauling his torso over the railing. He gave a small whine and looked pleadingly at Tony.
Winghead blew raspberries at him and dived under the water. Coming up again in a different part of the oversized jacuzzi bath. He had reverted back to his merman form and seemed very comfortable to do so.
The strange truce between the two blondes continued for the rest of the week. They held meetings, asked each other for advice and crates workout regimens together. They hadn’t argued once since that little debacle with the Commander rushing toward the Avenger’s fight with his Hydra Shield. It was kind of odd. Tony was happy they weren’t fighting but two Caps was just too much to handle. Too much bosssyiness and too much ordering around. He was going to solve this once and for all.
“ Come on babe, do you really have to talk About another man in bed? You know how jealous that makes me.” Iron Man pouted.
Steve gave him a confused look as Tony turned to Ultron. “ Alright Megatron bring out my suit, Daddy has some work to do.”
“ No. you are being very mean right now. You could have hurt Nat. You are going to think about what you have done.” Winghead hissed and crawled back into the water.

“ Stark!,” Natasha called out. Tony looked over the creature’s shoulder and saw Clint with an arrow now notched in his bow and Nat aiming a gun at the creature. Tony yelped when he felt a wet tongue on his face followed by a nuzzle to his neck.
“ It can’t be that bad, to spend time with him if you have to,” Pepper said. Great now she was on their side.
“ Get the fuck off me!” The older man snarled. He looked so much like his father in his world. Nat and Bucky reluctantly let him go and he came over. Tony noticed even though he had a cane. He didn’t use it, not that he needed it judging from his strong and confident stride. Instead he held it by its midsection and carried it.
Tony hollowed out his cheeks and began to suck and bob his head. Steve Let our a loud gasp and threw his head back.
“ We will discuss that. Just promise me you won’t hurt anyone else or I won’t mind helping them dispose you.”
Tony took in his surroundings. This man must be either a high ranking Hydra official or a prominent supporter from the high rise penthouse apartment of Park ave and the personal driver was anything to go by.
The Commander smiled. “ Ahh, I was wondering when I would meet you colonel. Even in my universe you were close to Tony. In my world we called him Director Stark, he was the director of SHIELD and I was in love with him.”
The vampire groaned and flashed his teeth. He large hands were currently massaging the globes of Tony’s ass. He leaned forward and nipped at the exposed collar bone in front of him, making Tony winced slightly. And that was one of the reasons why he was a bigger nuisance to deal with than usual. He had been more nippy than usually, leaving bite marks and bruises littered  all over his body. “ Watch the teeth there, Dracula,”
“ Last week he found him face down in the pool. He’s a heavy son of a bitch when he knocked the fuck out.” Clint commented.
“ Why the hell did you think I dressed like this then?!” Tony was shouting at point and looked about ready to throttle Steve.
Sorry for the short chapter. I am currently working on a longer one. Please stay tuned and thanks for all of your support so far.
He looked equally surprised. “ I can’t believe it,” he whispered, “ They told me that you looked like him...: but I didn’t think the resemblance would be this uncanny.” He was close now. Tony didn’t realize how close he had gotten. His hands hovered by his sides as if he wanted to touch him to confirm he was real but wasn’t sure if it would be appropriate.
Sorry about the delay. School and work have been real busy and I’ve been having difficulty keeping up.
Steve nodded and dismissed him.  Steve opened the door and walked through the door. Tony was on the bed, naked, his ankle changed to the wall.
Tony cowered at the angry sight of his mother. He had forgotten how made she could get. And of course Rhodey had ditched him. The damn coward.
“ Yeah. Winghead would love to meet the guy that Tony can’t stand to even be in the same building with. He’s going to be fish food before he can say “ abra cada bra.” “ Clint added.
“ Yeah. And then Steve would be like Captain America and would save him I guess. But originally he wanted Steve to you know pretend to...” Grant didn’t finish.
“ Both of you enough!” Sam snapped. “ To be honest I’m surprised that Tony is willing to put up with your bullshit. Bruce explained to me that you almost hurt Tony this morning. And Grant I have already asked Loki his opinion. And yes I know it’s Loki, but the man can be very honest when Thor promises to take him shopping. I stress that you be very transparent with your potential partner. Do you want to tell Tony or should I? Because you need to stop antagonizing Steve. You have messed up in the past and are no better then Steve. “
“ And let me guess all this macho bullshit is because you are probably jealous because you don’t want anyone looking at Tony’s ass?”
“ No, No, No! Absolutely not! How the hell did you find my bathroom?. You are going to use the guest bathroom. “
Both soldiers were panting loudly now. Tony smiled. “ Now. For the fun part.” Tony tugged at Grants shirt and he pulled it over his head to discard it to the side. Steve copied. “ You can both penetrate-“
The balding man stepped forward. “If I may, we have Ellie here. She’s quite beautiful as you can see and a virgin. I have no doubt that you shall find her suitable.” The man gently ushered forward another girl.
What the hell happened. There was Steve and Thor and Clint...Nat has died... He was one Thanos and he... Tony froze to look at his hand and his heart dropped. The stone were missing. He no longer had the stones. What the fuck happened to them? His arm also looked fine, but burn marks or scaring. Not that he as complaining, but it was weird.
Tony was finally going to get some after he doesn’t know how long. He was so excited he could cry. There was nothing hat could screw-
“ I owe it to The Commander for everything that he has done to be. So, I am reaching out to you all and pleading with you to take into consideration that all of what he has done was for my benefit. He wanted to make sure that I was safe and that I felt welcome in this universe. So all the mistakes I made here, he was trying to cover it up so that I would not be punished for rules that I didn’t know as even though are universes are similar they are also different. So please keep that in mind as you judge him. His behavior was not out of malice. But out of love for me.  Thank you for listening to my statement and I wish you all a good night.”
“ No you knucklehead. Sam always brings stuff with him whenever he and Rhodey are on a trip or mission together. He always has this hope that Rhodey is going to put out.”
His sisters were already at the table. Sarah was his half sister with blonde hair and blue eyes and the oldest of the girls at age 8. Winnifred was his other half sister and six years old with brown hair and blue eyes. Maria was his full blooded sister and had Tony’s brown hair and doe like eyes. She was four years old and smiled happily at Peter as he walked in.
Tony hopped off of the bed and went back to his robe to retrieve the bottle of lube. When he turned around they were both undressed and waiting for him. Tony smirked, this was going to be fun.
Steve motioned Tony to follow him as he headed to the elevator. Steve really didn’t look happy about it. Steve pressed a button on the panel and the elevators closed
“ It’s not like you are any better. I’m trying to figure out why Ms. Potts still sticks around with a bastard like you when she could obviously work for someone better.”
“ Ummm. Tony are you alright? Why are you suddenly talking about not liking living things?” Bruce asked concerned.
Bruce walked into the closure and locked the door with a small clock. Winghead stiffened and looked over Tony’s shoulder. He growled in warning as he dug in talons into the dirt.
“ It was a six month program and it’s helping me pay for school. I usually come here on breaks on such.”
This vacation wasn’t bad so far. It’s actually has been pretty fun. It was good that those two idiots weren’t fighting. He hates it when they fight.
“ I’m hoping it’ll be nice. The party i mean. The mansion is like super nice. It’s been in my family for generations.”
Harry: there this movie coming out next weekend. It’s supposed to be good. It’s by that director that won that award last year. We can go see it after chem homework.
The elevator dinged and the doors opened to reveal the common room. It looked very much like the one back in his own universe but with a lot of photos of the team.
Tony nodded and whined. He felt Bucky’s fingers enter him, stretching him wider. Bucky lulled his leg outward to stretch him wider. Tony didn’t know how long it was but he eventually felt the blunt tip of Bucky’s penis nudge his entrance. Tony lowered his hands below and tried to stretch himself further to encourage Bucky to move in faster. Steve and Bucky made sounds of disapproval and removed tony’s  hands. They said something about not wanting to rush by Tony didn’t car he wanted them in him now. Bucky slowly slid in home with a huff. Steve moves first and Bucky followed. They began to make turns and started to quicken their pace. Tony clawed at both of them. Trying to gain purchase purchase somewhere. With a loud howl Tony came and Bucky and Steve followed after a few more thrusts.
Oh this shit was not going to fly. “If you two don’t get your asses down to medical to apologize, I’m not having sex with either of you for a month and I can ensure you I’ll be just fine.”
floor in silence, and then Tony kicks off his shoes beside the rug. Steve follows his lead and removes his shoes, too.
“But you can draw,” Tony says slowly. “And I like your style.” He pauses for a moment, looking Steve over. “Fine. I’ll pay you only once the project is done on time. Deal?”
“Fashionably late,” Steve agrees, and then he pulls Tony in for a kiss. It’s deep and long, and sends sparks into his belly. It’s Tony who finally pushes him away.
The detective nods. “Yes, I’ve already spoken to him. But at this point, we have three uncorroborated reports, and hearsay because no one ever officially reported Mr. Swanson until your friend Lucas.”
They have more small talk, but eventually Steve’s stomach grumbles and he decides he’d better go eat something before he gets grouchy. The curator wishes him well and waves him off.
He finally manages to tip himself over the edge with thoughts of something else, someone else’s hand on his dick, someone else pressing him into the mattress.
A few moments later, someone pulls Steve of Paul and he wants to fight back, but he realizes that it’s Tony’s security. The room is suddenly full of guards and police. Steve sits on the floor, blood on his hand, until Tony comes over to him slowly and crouches down next to him.
Steve’s brow furrows for a second. He didn’t know of any LGBT marches in the area. It’s not even pride month. He glances back at Tony to see if he was joking, but his face is serious.
Steve nods, sighing in relief. He’s not sure he could deal with being the cause of an accident and someone else getting hurt because of it. He’s a pretty careful driver. Always has been. He’s actually never been in a car accident before.
Tony looks hesitant, like he doesn’t want to leave the apartment, but he finally nods and heads for the door.
“I love it, Paul,” Steve responds, trying to make it sound convincing. It must not matter, because Paul just keeps going. He leans forward and rips Steve’s shirt over his head. He leans forward and bites down hard onto one of Steve’s nipples, hard enough to draw blood. Steve hisses in response, but he’s trained his body not to pull away. He takes the pain, because it doesn’t last long. An hour and it’s over.
“I remember that,” Tony nods. “The night we kissed. You were almost finished with the sculpture. You were hurt but wouldn’t tell me.”
“He said he was going to kill both of us, and then he said if I helped him kill Tony, he’d let me live.”
To his Thursday through Sunday clients, he writes the same message: “I am sorry but I will be unable to meet with you again in the future. I’d be happy to help you find a replacement if necessary.” It seems appropriate, seeing as how most of their relationships were so casual that none of them will even notice he’d gone.
Tony’s eyes tighten suspiciously, but he finally just nods. “Alright. Nothing extravagant. I might have to rethink my dating strategy with you.”
When Steve pulls up at home, he heads straight to his apartment. He’s inches from reaching the door handle, to insert the key, to just go inside and
Steve crumples the check in his hands. “This is sympathy money,” he insists. “And I don’t need your sympathy.”
“But we could have been real. We still can be!” Paul seems desperate suddenly, as if he just wants Steve to admit they had a relationship, that they could have been lovers.
He slowly pushes the door open, stepping just one foot inside to take a look around. He’s shocked to see that his house has been trashed. His menial belongings have been torn apart, thrown across the room. Everything he has ever owned has been ripped from the cabinets and is strewn about on the floor.
“I just…,” Steve stalls for a second. He can’t remember how that happened. It was so fast, but it was so slow, too. “I was talking to him, and then I pulled the gun out of his hands.”
“Someone offers to buy me a drink, and if it’s a one-time thing, I bring them back here,” Steve says. “What we do after that is up to you.”
His GPS says it’ll take about thirty minutes to get there, so he’s got thirty minutes to be stuck in his own head for a while. The memory of last night, and the picture of a shirtless Tony, is still fresh in his mind and he wishes he had something else to think about. Because he’s pretty sure that he’s going to get hard again if he doesn’t stop thinking about that picture, about Tony touching him.
“So do you,” Tony replies, looking Steve over from head to toe. Steve is still just in his boxers, so he rolls his eyes.
In the distance, all the way across the lab, Steve can see Tony lying on the floor, just in a black undershirt and the same pants from earlier, as he welds something in place. He slowly approaches, hoping he doesn’t startle the man while he’s at work.
But Steve finally gets over himself and returns to what he was doing, putting his hand back between the legs and steadying it as he carves a long stroke down to form the outer pant leg. Every once in a while he’ll glance up at Tony who seems to be watching him intently, the look on his face undiscernible.
So he’d spent every moment possible over the last week working on this case. The police couldn’t specifically look for Paul, as there was no evidence he had caused the accident and Steve had never filed any reports of harassment from the guy, so it was literally looking for a needle in a haystack.
Steve looks away, trying to push away the feeling of dread that has spread over him. He wishes Tony could just understand how bad things had been with Paul. He wishes he could understand why he himself let things go on for so long. He didn’t like pain. Was it really for money that he let Paul hurt him so badly?
“Your car was hit on purpose,” Tony begins. “An unknown assailant went across three lanes of traffic and intentionally pushed you into oncoming traffic. The driver was in a black SUV, but traffic cameras lost track of it a few blocks up the road. I’m trying to track it down using my own software, but so far the police haven’t been very forthcoming with information.”
He hasn’t done this for the pure pleasure of it in a very long time. It’s been quite a while since anyone even piqued his interest in that way. But the instant attraction to Tony was undeniable at the gallery earlier, and now that they’ve chatted a bit it’s impossible to ignore his growing lust for the other man.
“Where’s the bar here?” Tony finally asks, and suddenly the tension is diffused. One of the workers points out the entrance to the bar and Tony starts to walk off, but he stops and turns to Steve. “I’ll be in there, if you want to join me,” he says.
Steve knows that what happened between him and Tony was a one-time thing, and that he’ll probably never see Tony again. He’s accepted it, and he’s moving on from it. Their one night together, though, was enough to make him crave so much more. It was sex between two individuals who wanted to have sex, no money exchanged, and the feeling is so strange and foreign that Steve isn’t sure what to make of it.
“You know they’re expensive. The good ones are. And he goes through them pretty quickly. It’s a good gift.” Carol raised her eyebrows challengingly.
He waited another few seconds. “I feel like, based on the way you’re saying that, it’s supposed to be a big announcement.” He raised a hand in the air. “But I’ve definitely flirted with Steve before, so I’m not sure what the big deal is?”
Steve seemed thoughtful. “If that’s the case, we should probably speak to Sue, Reed, and Namor. They keep better track of Doom than anyone.”
Tony suddenly interrupted, “That reminds me, I spoke to Cassie. She says she’ll try to get Billy and Tommy to call.”
Steve smiled a little, smitten beyond his control. “Yes, you did,” he said. “You said Wanda teleported in.”
Namor immediately began speaking over Tony. “There is nothing shameful about the Atlantean body. We train to peak physical perfection. Your eyes are blessed by the gift of viewing my skin.”
Steve felt it like a punch in the gut. He immediately understood. He just couldn’t do a single damn thing about it.
Tony opened a small slot on the side of his armor and took out a communicator. “Here,” he said, tossing it to Pietro, who caught it so quickly it didn’t even look like his hand moved. “It’s a high-functioning comm. You can use it to talk to Wanda. It’s an audio-only device, but it should be enough for now.”
At Tony’s comment, Steve looked closer and saw that Reed, Sue, and Namor were all waiting by the access door. Their soulmarks were all visible once you got close enough. Reed and Sue had met several years before they matched with Namor. From what Steve had heard, Reed had pulled Sue out of the way of a harried intern who was about to bump into her. This left Reed with a typical soulmark on his right palm, swirling blue and yellow, and Sue with a slightly less typical one on her left forearm, a slow-moving blue and brown. Namor gave each of them a soulmate mark on their shoulders. Apparently, the Fantastic Four had been called to a meeting with some Atlanteans, during which Namor had grasped onto Reed’s right shoulder and Sue’s left shoulder as a traditional gesture of respect, causing a bright collection of blues, greens, and golds to appear as a half-handprint on Sue’s collarbone and a single thumb mark against Reed’s neck. Namor’s soulmarks covered half of his right palm and the inside of his left thumb, matching the blue and yellow spirals and the steady blue and brown that Reed and Sue had already left on each other.
“ I want to see them again,” Tony said automatically. He never really had parents. These people loved him. Yes they were weird, but what parents where normal.
“ Maybe you can garner us a favor. Turn a trick with them, maybe they will take it easy on us next time or better yet not do this at all. Ow! Nat what was that for.” Clint cried out as he rubbed the arm that Natasha punched.
He had started yelling and cursing and calling her a nigger. I had been in the living room with the kids so I told them to hide in their bedroom and not come out until I said so. I got the spare gun that we had hidden behind the book shelf and I ran to my sister. He had a gun in her face and was yelling at her, asking her what the hell she was doing at my house and if I new there was a nigger in my house.
“ Stop you two,” Maria admonished as he directed Tony to his sit,” It’s family time. Stop being so disagreeable.”
“ First off he’s your type and secondly you were checking out his ass when you pulled his chair out for him.” Pietro said.
They thought they were stubborn? Well Tony was a whole new brand of it and was not going to take any shit from those two.
He loved getting his ego stroked but this was just too freaky.  Especially when the ego stroking came in the form of a statue. It was large and bronze in color, gleaming beautifully in the sunlight. It was looking to the horizon as it’s arms were placed on its hips, pushing the sides of the suit jacket up a bit. He looked at if he were apart of a funny conversation, from the smile on his lips.  It looked exactly like him down to the Armani suit he usually like to wear. He looked down and saw a placard under the statue.
“ Tony, He’s Ultron. He’s been wanting to meet you. I’ve been delaying it because I didn’t know how you’ll react.”
Steve thrusted harshly into Bucky pushing him forward into Tony. Bucky began to move his hips in a relaxed pace, however, the pattern was often interrupted with the strong thrusts from Steve. Bucky whined and looked between Tony and Steve.
Tony saw Nat bit her lip and quickly dropped the book to cover her mouth and her shoulder shook. ‘ What an ass,’ Tony thought. Tony didn’t even want to look at Steve.
Short update. I’ve been busy with school but I wanted to write something. Please leave your comments:)
“ He’s going to mount you whether you are prepared or not. He’s really a nice guy honestly, but not exactly a professional at sex.”
When he was ready to leave, Tony and his family tried to leave but Bucky decided to block their exit.  They ended up having Jarvis ordering them food as Bucky laid himself over Tony’s lap, a smug smile on his face.
“ Hi, darling, just came to check in on you.” He said happily as he leaned forward to press a kiss on his cheek. “ Everyone treating you okay?”
“ Nat...” he said softly and he took a step closer, “ Your alive I can’t believe... shit!” He yelled out as an arrow nearly hit his foot.
Clint let out a sarcastic laugh. “ Pietro pulled the fire alarm at school so he wouldn’t have to take a test.”
“ It’s our team. As in Tony and I. We are co-leaders.” Steve interrupted. Tony rolled his eyes, these two were really getting on his nerves.
“Who is texting you? That’s like the third time it went off and it hasn’t even been a full minute yet.” Morgan said. He was moving schematics  quickly on the visual display, adding his own input occasionally. They often did this together. It was like their bonding time.
“ Just give me a chance ok? I like hanging out with you. We can go somewhere today. I’m pretty sure you will have fun.”
“ They can get like that if they are scared. If they were hunted down by Hydra, then I’m not surprised that they were behaving like that.”
Tony scooted closer and threw  a leg over Steve’s hips so that he could straddle him. Steve looked up at him.
“ Dont blame me for being a bigot. You can always go back and date Sharon. I have no clue why as someone as racist as you is dating Sam. Besides she was very happy with Riley.”
“ Thank you your grace,” Tony said with a smile. He probably looked genuine, but  it was far from it. He could thank his upbringing in the public eye for that.
Maria began to cut the Tony’s food and placed the plate in front of him. Maria took her place next to him and smiled. Tony wasted no time in shoveling the food in his mouth. He let out a happy moan. This is what heaven tasted like, he was sure of it.
“ Well, that’s just a normal reaction to me. Don’t worry, I definitely won’t mind showing a good time on our next date. “
“ He’s from another universe. He accidentally got sent to this one,” Schmidt replied quickly,” He’s just here for a little bit. We were giving him a tour.”
Hi everyone! Thanks for your support so far. I am thankful to everyone who has read my stories. I hope to read your comments and please support my other works:)! Also, please leave behind a kudos.
“ What the hell are you doing here? Better yet how did you get in?” Steve asked as he clambered off Tony.
“ I don’t think I want another kid. I rather face Hydra than have one of those little monsters attack me bescsuse the are hungry. They scare me Tony. And I can’t handle them. They are like maniacs. Peter is our best one and he was about to fuck Wade Wilson. Wade Wilson Tony! And you know what Maria did? She put a fucking steak  knife in my blender because she wanted to know what it will do. Tony we are running a fucking insane asylum and Buck,  you and I can’t get out.”
“Okay, first of all, the gossip mill has it wrong,” Tony began, revving up to logically explain the facts in the face of this outrageous audacity. “I did not call Steve’s ass cute although it is, unarguably so. I called Steve cute in one comment after the battle. Then I said Doom had a nice ass but that saying so did not negate the niceness of Steve’s ass. That was during the debrief.”
. And he was. It filled him up from deep in his heart; an utter joy that he couldn’t control. He found himself smiling without realizing or thinking about it. He had even found himself humming as he walked here earlier. Humming! It was a lot to take in. Just being able to sit here and
,” she began with a significant look in Bucky’s direction, “is that a lot of people get together with people who are not their soulmates. Some people never even meet their soulmates. The existence of soulmates doesn’t immediately negate other romantic possibilities, Steve.”
Steve breathed out in relief. “Oh, good.” He looked around, then at Foggy. “So, where should I start?”
. It’s more than okay.” He turned the watch over and read the inscription aloud. “‘To T, my better half. Love, S.’”
Steve looked through the window and saw Cassie bend over, carefully picking up a news van with both hands. The reporter inside was gesticulating wildly as the woman holding the camera aimed it at Cassie.
“Ain’t that the truth. The Stark Industries poster boy.” Ben suddenly sounded more enthused. “That reminds me! Thanks again for the phone. It’s great. I can actually text now.” He waved his cell phone at Tony—a huge monstrosity that seemed to be reinforced with extra metal and a much thicker screen.
Spider-Man nodded, holding out his hands. “Of course I had to come over! I saw the news! Congratulations, Tony!”
Carol and Rhodey smiled at each other. They had a private conversation with their eyes, or maybe that was just Tony’s imagination, but soon enough Rhodey was lifting his pinky finger and pressing it to a very specific spot on Carol’s shoulder. Even through her shirt, their soulmarks reacted, hers glowing a spiraling mixture of silver, black, and red. His glowed a stunning gold alongside the more common red and blue. As their matching soulmarks reacted to each other, Tony forced himself not to look away. He was happy for his best friends. He really was.
with a man who says he doesn’t mind skipping syrup on his pancakes. That is just outlandish, even for a ninety-year-old stick in the mud.”
“What? No!” Frustrated and more than a little embarrassed, Tony quickly clarified, “About Doom. This was probably another experiment.”
Steve pondered this for a moment. “You didn’t see his face,” he eventually muttered. “He looked… dejected.”
amusement of everyone else. The appeal of the video is obvious, but I simply can’t condone putting anyone through this harassment, 18/?
The fourth, and final: Steve was the only person close enough to Tony. He saw the brick. He could act as a shield.
And take Tony home he did. The cabbie didn’t ask questions; Steve didn’t offer conversation. They got to Avengers Tower soon enough. There were a few media vans parked down the street, but no one was paying attention to a passing cab at nearly two in the morning.
They took the elevator down in companionable silence. When they walked off onto the hallway that led to Tony’s workshop, Pepper veered off to the room reserved for her suits. “Whatever you think, I think it’s a good sign,” she stated. “And that’s that on that.”
Carol pursed her lips. “I know Johnny Storm has a red, white, and blue soulmark. No one’s ever told him it was an American flag.”
Peter’s shoulders dropped as he quickly exited the office. What was he supposed to do now? Getting candid shots of Steve and Tony was going to be challenging enough. They’d basically gone into hiding since the soulmark appeared. And he couldn’t take photos as Spider-Man. That’d be way too obvious. He really didn’t want to give up his secret identity for this.
Johnny laughed, but Peter could hear how strained it was. “I tried to convince them you were a 007 agent. It didn’t really work.”
“How is that even possible,” Bucky stated, disbelieving. “I feel like you guys touch each other all the time.”
Castle shook his head. “You people put too much faith in the law.” He gestured to the police officers in front of them, who had just captured the robber and were currently interrogating the owners of the last house he’d hit. “These people? They’re just people. They make mistakes as much as any of us.”
It wasn’t the perfect place to talk to Tony, but being in the car was going to be the first time they were mostly alone (apart from Happy) together since the marks appeared. Steve had hoped for a more private opportunity to have a conversation. One of their suites would have been perfect. He’d have taken Tony’s workshop in a pinch. Even a public area when everyone else was out. But all of that seemed impossible now.
understandable that an overtly masculine-presenting superhero with a history of being powerful and famous would be hesitant to come out. 9/?
“I don’t want people to think they can’t protest against us, either. But I won’t stand for physical attacks. That’s crossing the line.” Steve shook his head, unable to believe Tony didn’t get that.
Well, that wasn’t entirely reassuring. Steve smiled at Tony, a bit rueful. “You know we can spend time together whenever you want, right?” He grabbed onto Tony’s big toe and shook it, feeling the thin cotton socks separating their skin. “Just ask, Tone.”
Steve took a moment to stare. He had no desire to scare him or steal the poor guy’s camera. He wasn’t actually sure what he could do with both his hands busy carrying Tony.
The damn wire casing was just a fraction of a millimeter too big. It didn’t sound like a huge problem, but it could cause extra friction when he released a pulse beam. Tony sighed and began extracting the wire, thinking of how he could rework it to ensure there wouldn’t be any type of blowback. Electricity was simple enough to work with due to its very clear rules. Those same rules could be head-bangingly frustrating due to their unyielding nature.
Steve caught the bag and pressed his forehead against it. “Tony,” he muttered, giving the bag one last small punch to the side.
“Oh my God, tell whoever it is to go away.” He groaned loudly, pulling the blanket up over his head.
“Why didn’t you just ask if he wanted to kiss you?” Wanda looked at Carol. “Communication is key here.”
Tony nodded. “Fine, yes, all right. I trust you.” He slouched farther down in his seat, gazing doubtfully out the window.
Steve nodded, unquestionably certain. “I know.” Tony would never dismiss his soulmate—not after all the research he’d funded, and especially not when it was someone he was already close to. That was obvious to anyone who knew him. “And Tony’s right. It’s not good for anybody if people start making false accusations against Avengers while we’re in combat.”
The rest of the team followed him. They were used to this by now. There was a certain kind of method to dealing with press conferences. It was structured in a specific way that allowed everyone the static comfort of knowing exactly where they were supposed to go and what they were supposed to do. Steve didn’t particularly care for the monotony, but he appreciated the streamlined process regardless.
Steve walked over to watch the broadcast. It was muted with subtitles on, showing a reporter interviewing the man who threw the brick. “Wait. Why is he out? I thought he was still in custody?”
He made it to the rooftop without really considering how flying instead of driving would change his conversation strategy. It became suddenly, explicitly apparent when he saw Tony in his suit, putting on his helmet. Steve was going to be in Tony’s arms—super close—and unable to see his face—not close enough.
Tony’s eyes widened. This was the end of his one-night stands. Not that he had all that many, especially recently, but there was no way anyone was going to risk the kind of bad press and smear campaigns that would come from sleeping with Captain America’s soulmate.
“Okay. That’s fair.” Tony pointed down the hall over Steve’s shoulder. “I’m going to go spoil this news to everybody I can find. See you later?”
“You don’t understand.” He laughed, incredibly unhappily. “The more you talk, the more it’s clear you have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Tony blinked. “No,” he said, slowly. Tony turned back to his bed and rubbed his eyes tiredly. “You can stay. Just don’t hog the blankets.”
Tony waved a hand in front of his face. “Oh, this old thing? I’ve had it forever.” He laughed once, half-heartedly. “Yeah, no, I appreciate it. Thanks.”
“I was just thinking that,” Steve agreed. The waitress delivered their drinks, Steve thanked her, and, after she walked away, he smiled at Tony. “So. How are you, soulmate?”
“Anyway, he told me that you’d be able to help me pick out a nice gift,” Steve continued. “I’m looking for something that’s appropriate for a personal gift. Something fashionable. Expensive, probably.”
Tony glanced over to her. “You’re being very strange. Despite my innate trust of all human beings, I’m suspicious of your motivations.”
Sam strode forward, heading into the building with Steve right behind him. Tony felt satisfied. It had been a good battle, overall. No major injuries, not much damage to property and city infrastructure, and everyone worked well together. They’d had worse fights—a lot worse. Tony looked at Pepper, ready to comment on their good deed for the day, but she was eyeing him critically.
Tony sighed, pushing his phone back into his pocket with too much force. “Come on, Cap. Haven’t you ever read the Entertainment section of the paper? If something happens to us, it’s news. That’s just how it is.”
“I’m sure you would’ve. But we had the whole situation with the reporters, then Tony got that call from his board.” Sam raised a hand in a what-can-you-do gesture. “Come on, Steve. You know Tony wants to talk. He always wants to talk to you.”
For the next fifteen minutes, there was very little talk over the comms. Tony was used to this part. Normally they’d take out the bots, find the villain of the day, and take care of them. But the bots kept coming, and Tony wasn’t getting a good read on how they seemed to be multiplying so quickly.
Steve looked up, trying to catch Tony’s gaze, but Tony was staring wide-eyed at Steve’s palm. His mouth was slightly open. He seemed frozen in place.
“Uh, less soulmate flirting please?” Tony quipped, distractedly keeping up their usual banter as he scanned for the source of where the bots were coming from. Besides, why was it always soulmates? He needed a break from it all. “I’m trying to work here.”
Steve pushed off against the table and walked around it. “I don’t know how we’re supposed to figure this out if you won’t talk to me.”
“I wish,” Steve joked. “I just know you. Besides, you were thinking too loud.” He ran off in one direction, leaving Tony to go the other way.
“I’m sorry,” Tony continued, still hushed, tarnishing the air between them. “I want to love it. I can’t believe I don’t love a soulmark
Tony folded his arms on his desk and slowly rested his head down. He heard a familiar whirring and turned his head to glare at Dum-E. “This is all your fault.”
Steve didn’t like to consider it, but it was more than possible that someone had a lingering grudge against Tony. It might have been from his past as a weapons dealer. It also could have been from one of their many confrontations with villains. Sometimes it was difficult for civilians to understand that they couldn’t guarantee everyone’s safety in every situation. Steve hated thinking of it, but they had suffered civilian casualties before and could very well do so again. When aliens rained hellfire down from the skies, the Avengers certainly couldn’t control who was injured in the attack. Sometimes they were an easy target for retribution, even if they weren’t the cause of the problem in the first place.
“Good morning,” Steve greeted cheerfully. He felt energized from both his run and his recent decision to be more upfront about his feelings for Tony. He could start today. Holding out the coffee he had bought for Tony, Steve squared his shoulders. He could do this. Just as he opened his mouth to say something else, Tony made a low, guttural noise of want.
“I’m saying I found you the perfect law firm. Small, only takes a few cases a year because that’s all they can handle. Most of their clients don’t even pay them, so they’re struggling and desperate for business.”
Tony set down on a street corner, allowing Steve to begin assessing the situation and giving orders. “What, you’re a mind reader now?”
Shaking his head, Bucky grabbed Steve’s elbow. “Listen, no, you know he does that when he’s stressed—” He cut himself off, pivoting to another point. “Or when he needs to think. You know how he is.”
Steve put his hand on Tony’s chin, turning his face back around. “This is what I do,” he murmured before kissing him.
“Now, let’s see the watches.” Foggy made gimme hands at Steve. “I have a billionaire to pick out a gift for.”
Castle stared pointedly at Tony. “Don’t push it.” He turned around and walked away, out of Tony’s line of sight.
By the time they were closing in to land, Steve began to feel lighter. Some of the metaphorical weight had been lifted off his shoulders. He had accomplished a goal: communicating his romantic intentions to Tony. This would definitely help him focus on the potential doombot problem during the meeting.
Natasha’s face grew hard. She walked forward, getting right in Steve’s space. “Just because you aren’t soulmates doesn’t mean you’re not meant to be.”
There was a brief period of time, a few seconds max, during which they just stared at each other. Steve knew it was his responsibility to say something. He was the one who had interrupted Tony while he was working, after all. But it just felt like there was too much to say.
“I thought you weren’t interested in me!” Steve groaned. “You flirt with everybody. I had no idea I was any different.”
Tony stopped moving upwards, turned to his left, and saw Daredevil jumping down from a telephone pole, slamming his staff directly into a bot as he landed next to it.
“Then it is only correct for this meeting to take place between kings,” Namor said. “And a queen, of course.”
Tony turned around, removing his faceplate and smiling at Castle. “Your body armor, as promised.” He gestured to the pieces he had placed upon a staircase that was falling apart. “The most advanced prototype Stark Industries has to offer.”
“Yeah. I mean.” Tony shrugged. “I guess I’m technically an atheist, so I’m more of a Santa Christmas than a Jesus Christmas guy.”
“—America are gay! I repeat, Iron Man and Captain America have just been outed on live television! Though we have yet to receive a comment from the two, the Avengers haven’t yet left the podium, which means we could very well hear more on—”
“I agree. It’s weird. But it’s also weird that you never indicated you were interested in me before our marks appeared.” Tony tried to say it casually, but that kind of statement would set off Steve’s trouble sensors from a mile away.
“There are many reasons,” she replied with a short laugh. “I could begin listing them, if you’re bored.”
“Nice doing business with you.” Castle walked off, and Tony just shook his head. It would be worth it; he knew that. But that man was extremely grating.
“Oh, please,” she grumbled, walking out. “I’ll tell Reed before we go to bed. Let me know if there are any important updates in regards to your secret guy.”
Foggy inhaled sharply, spilling more of his drink on the table. An employee came over and gave him a dark look. She took a cloth rag and began wiping down the wooden surface.
The man grasped the edge of his shirt and attempted to take it off with one hand while he held the camera with his other, pressing the shutter button as fast as he could.
“Iron Man!” A fist pounded from outside, slightly shaking the car. “How do you feel about having Captain America’s soulmark on your face!”
Steve’s breath is coming out too shallow. He is having trouble keeping his head on straight, having trouble hiding the way his body is clearly betraying him.
“I can only work after 5pm most days,” Steve says. “And I’d need to work in a quiet environment, somewhere near to where the sculpture will be delivered, if possible.”
Tony sighs and then pulls Steve back into another hug. “Don’t worry, okay? I’m going to take care of this. I’m going to make sure he never hurts anyone ever again.”
button, tapping his foot angrily as it ascends. He tries to compose himself. Maybe he’s wrong. Maybe what he thinks isn’t what really happened. But there is no other explanation. No other excuse.
When Steve wakes up, he feels really warm. It’s so nice that his mind stays in a dream-like state for several seconds. It’s only when he realizes that the reason he feels warm is because Tony is still pressed up against him, snoozing away, that his eyes shoot open.
“The show benefits the children’s cancer ward at the hospital. A group of them were invited to come by and see the paintings before the gallery opens. They should be here in an hour, so you should go get this put up before they arrive.”
A few minutes later, Steve finishes up the grilled cheese and he puts them on a plate. He and Tony sit across from each other and wait for them to cool off, making small talk and carefully avoiding anything about the past. Steve wants Tony to know everything about him and he wants to know everything about Tony, but it’s going to take a while to ease into things.
Steve rolls the condom on and lines himself up, waiting for Tony to push down a little bit which will be all the permission he needs. He doesn’t have to wait long, because Tony is impatient and he wraps his legs around Steve’s hips and pulls him in quickly.
Steve stands up and dusts off his pants. He’s been working on the bottom half of the sculpture for so long that he had crouched down, and then his legs fell asleep, so when he stands he loses his balance. Tony’s hands come up to steady him, but he regains composure pretty quickly.
Tony glares at him. “You could have just picked up the phone and called me. You could have just…talked to me like a normal person! Does the thought of me giving you something make you that uncomfortable?” Tony demands. “The thought of you earning something, even if it’s more than you expected, really make you hate me so much?”
Tony’s hand suddenly comes up and touches Steve’s. He doesn’t move it even when Steve swallows loudly and their eyes meet.
“You mean,” Tony begins, “that you came here to yell at me, and then you were just going to turn around and leave?”
Tony’s fingers stop dancing around Steve’s foot under the water and his eyes snap up to Steve’s. “Yes,” he answers simply. “And I guess I thought, or at least hoped, that you felt the same way.”
Steve does some quick calculations in his head. He works quickly, but two weeks is short notice. And he’d need time to have the medium delivered, and then he’d need a way to transport it to wherever Tony was having this party.
Steve awkwardly handles the remote, flipping through the channels. He doesn’t watch much TV, mostly because he can’t afford it, so he doesn’t even know what’s out there. He eventually lands on the news where a reporter is talking about a generous donation made by the Stark Foundation to fund an LGBT college in upstate New York.
Steve shrugs, but he accepts the seat at the counter when Tony gestures for him to sit and then his mouth waters when a large sandwich is put in front of him. Tony sits across the bar, his own sandwich in his hands, waiting for Steve to take a bite.
When he’d gone to see his doctor for the fractured rib, they’d said it could take six weeks for it to fully heal, but it’s barely been one and Steve is already feeling better. The bruise is gone, at least, and he can sit down without groaning in pain too much. He’s always been able to heal pretty fast; it’s just a gift he’s been blessed with.
Tony sits down and Steve takes a breath before sitting opposite him. He starts drawing instantly, making light lines as he sketches Tony’s jawline, his ears, even the way his hair just barely falls onto his forehead. It probably takes him half an hour to just sketch the outline, not filling in any facial features yet. The whole time, Tony is silent.
Eventually, they’re able to move through the gallery with just a few people tailing them, and after a few more moments a set of guards pushes the stragglers aside so that Steve and Tony can walk together.
“I’ve found that I can’t function past three days,” Tony shrugs. “Sometimes I’m just so stuck in my head, you know,
He wipes the blood off his chest from the nipple and doesn’t bother putting another shirt on. He goes into his room, drops onto the bed, and closes his eyes. He can’t stand to roll onto his side, so he lays flat on his back and just breathes.
When he can finally stand to look at himself again, he gets out of the shower and dries off. It only takes a few minutes, but he dresses and collects his belongings before exiting the motel room. He walks a few blocks over where he parked his car and gets in, just sitting behind the steering wheel for several moments before starting it and driving towards home.
“It bothers me that you thought you had to do it,” Tony sighs. “I wish we’d met ten years ago, Steve. I’d have saved you. I’d have spent every day loving you and showing you how much you deserve to be loved.”
Tony continued blasting the ones on the roof, alternating between bored and annoyed. He knew this was important, but it was mind-numbing work and it wasn’t getting him any closer to solving the mystery of how that business had gotten destroyed. Or of who was behind these bots. Just catching them was like playing whack-a-mole. They needed to track them if they were going to get anywhere.
“Let them know we’re on our way, F.R.I.D.A.Y.” Tony dropped his tools and quickly strode to one of the suits he wasn’t working on. “Send an alert to Steve and whoever’s available.”
Sue held up her hands. “Please, don’t mind him. We’ve always got some kind of family drama going on. I’m sure you know how it is.”
“Oh, what?” Cassie’s voice caused him to look back, quickly spotting a news helicopter circling around her head. “Come on, you all started it.”
Johnny groaned. “Ugh, that reminds me.” He sounded annoyed. “I had to head the fam off again today.”
Bucky grabbed the remote control and turned the TV from cable to Netflix. “Guess what? Your love life isn’t on every channel, idiot.” He turned on a movie, settling back into the corner of the couch.
“I’m, uh, also leaving!” Spider-Man wiggled his fingers up and over his head, possibly indicating shooting a web. “I have to get back to work.”
Pepper’s smile widened, although it wasn’t reflected in her eyes. “They haven’t gone into hiding. The entire team returned home to Avengers Tower, as is standard procedure after a press conference.”
Tony held onto his temper, remembering what this was for. “Not at all! I’ll have it there by the end of the day.”
Tony stared at her. “Okay. So why don’t you take the case, if you don’t want my legal team to do it?”
“I mean, the publicity of it all is bad enough by itself,” Tony continued. “I guess that always would’ve been the case when we matched. But the videos, the matching live on camera, it’s a mess, Steve. It’s a fucking mess.”
The waitress came back, quickly looking between them. “You boys ready to order?” She took out her pen and pad, jotting something down.
Steve walked away, confident as he always was when on a specific mission. Meanwhile, Foggy and Matt took a moment to consider the enormity of what they were just told.
Lowering his thrusters to their lowest setting, Tony carefully stuck his landing, making sure he didn’t take any risks while he was holding Steve—no matter how durable the super soldier serum had made him, it certainly didn’t allow him to bounce back from a fall this high. Once his feet were secure, Tony bent over and Steve slipped down out of his hold.
There was a brief pause during which Tony pondered just how many times he’d had a cup of coffee out of that pot. Then, Clint replaced the pot and headed out of the room, grabbing Bobbi’s elbow and dragging her along as she rolled her eyes at his antics. “Caw caw, motherfuckers,” he said as he left.
Carol stared at Tony. “So don’t ask. Open the faceplate, kiss him, then close the plate again.” She eyed him with severe criticism. “Don’t you have a degree in something?”
Steve was always impressed by how welcoming the area right inside of their rooftop was. A large area filled with a few couches and comfortable chairs alongside tables that held platters of food and jugs of water was the first thing any guests from this door saw. He supposed it made sense to offer refreshments right away if most of your guests came from space.
Bobbi laughed. “I remember that!” She glanced over at Bruce. “We got stuck in traffic around their tower. Nearly five hours!”
Tony huffed out a laugh. “Thanks. I’m deciding if I should start considering a haircut.” He stroked his chin.
things Steve wanted to talk about. He was fairly new to relationships in general. Tony had more experience in that department, so he was intensely curious about what Tony was expecting. Steve knew some soulmate couples jumped into a physical relationship straight away while others got to know each other first. There were a lot of different ways people approached the newly-formed soulbond, but the most common trait was that people had just met either at that moment or very recently. Steve had known Tony for years. How could they expect to use relationships between people who were strangers as any kind of litmus test?
“I love it.” Steve sounded incredibly sincere. He was glad that came across because he really did mean it, and it was important Tony knew.
“Why don’t we head inside?” Reed asked, gesturing to the door with his free hand. “If we stay out here any longer, we might get helicopters.”
“All you do is impose,” Tony commented. “But it’s fine. I love you, so I’ll deal with your—” He stopped short, yawning loudly. “—ridiculous—” He pulled off his t-shirt, ruffling his hair in the process. “—stubborn—” He kicked off his shoes, sitting on the edge of his bed and tugging off his socks with more force than necessary. “—optimism.”
A web shot up to the top of Avengers Tower. Spider-Man flung himself through the air, climbing onto one of the upper windows.
soulmark with Namor, King of Atlantis and, let’s be honest, infamous troublemaker. Dubbed ‘the threesome that flooded the world’, the sheer amount of analysis, critique, and thought pieces that were produced about them in a relatively short period of time did, in fact, flood the internet until social media crashed for
Sam, Pepper, Clint, Bobbi, and Bruce were waiting in various states of impatience. Sam and Bobbi were making tired small talk, discussing various plans for the day that basically amounted to training and doing a patrol later in the afternoon. Pepper had brought her tablet along and was working on something as she yawned, trying to politely cover her mouth with her coffee cup.
The waitress nodded and walked away, heading behind the bar. Tony watched her go and then looked at his menu, considering. “
Tony pulled out his earbuds and threw them on the table. “F.R.I.D.A.Y., save and close.” The holographic blueprints in front of Tony flickered away. “Yeah. Okay. Let’s talk.”
“You really think people don’t talk about you?” Rhodey chuckled. “I woke up to twenty-eight messages.”
Bucky slapped Steve’s shoulder with the back of his hand. “Stevie! That’s amazing!” He gestured to Steve’s soulmark on his left palm. “You finally got it! With
Rhodey scoffed. “I’m having foursomes in space with three of the most powerful people in existence. What do I have to complain about?”
Finally, F.R.I.D.A.Y. replied, “I am now ready to pass judgment on the matter of your intelligence.”
“Anyway, you’ll never guess what just happened,” Tony said, immediately shoving his hands into the back pockets of his jeans. “Like, never. In a million years.” He bounced on his feet. “But guess anyway, I like it when you’re wrong.”
Waving didn’t seem appropriate. Steve knew Tony had worked with the military in an auxiliary capacity, but it was hard to explain the bone-deep need Steve had to return the respect he was being shown. After all, weren’t they both soldiers, serving their country? For all Steve knew, this man had served in the same war as he did.
Steve looked at Tony, hoping to find some clarity, but Tony slid farther down, looking at his phone and quietly groaning. Steve frowned. “I don’t get it,” he said, bluntly. “There are soulmate matches every day. Tony and I are famous, but this isn’t news.”
“Well, you’re not Captain Britain, are you? Wrong costume for that.” Tony spread his hands out. “Captain Cambodia? Avengers, assemble to the call of Captain Australia?”
The colors of soulmarks were pretty fascinating. They were almost always three colors, although a few cases of two and four color marks had been discovered. The colors seemed to have something to do with how each person viewed themselves. A lot of superheroes had marks that matched the colors of their costumes. Certain professions had common colors. Personality types were given to similar colors, too.
“We just met. He wasn’t keeping anything from you,” Steve replied. He looked at Matt and smiled. “I probably should have said something earlier, but I didn’t even think about it. I’m Captain America.”
“Frank Castle is en route to the back entrance,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. answered. “He should arrive in three minutes.”
“I think Jameson just asked me for porn.” Peter paused. “Scratch that, I know it. He was pretty clear.” A choking sound came from the phone’s speaker. “Yeah,” he said, voice heavy with resignation. “I know.”
Steve found himself at a loss. He knew Tony had a lot to deal with, but that seemed like an unnecessarily stressful series of questions. And Steve knew he couldn’t really help Tony with that—Stark Industries had always been Tony’s thing. Bumbling his way into a business conversation wouldn’t help.
!” one of the reporters shouted right as Steve turned enough to stop shielding Tony from the collected reporters.
“You’re a mess,” Rhodey stated. “The two of you. An utter mess. I’ve never seen such a shitshow in my life.”
Hopefully the formatting is okay for everyone to read! Had to spend two hours re-doing it on AO3. Big sigh.
“Not balls, though,” Jameson interrupted, chugging on his cigar in a highly uncomfortable way. “Nobody pays to see balls.”
Steve watched the man hurry away, wondering if he made the right call. He put the entire incident out of his mind and hailed a cab. It was done. Taking Tony home was his current priority.
Steve followed Tony in as a waitress called out, “Be right with you! Sit anywhere you like.” The waitress was speaking to another customer. Neither of them had turned to look their way.
Spiraling like this was getting him nowhere. Peter shook his head, deciding to focus on the easier problem. Getting a picture of Steve and Tony naked. Or nearly naked. Shirtless, he decided. He’d take shirtless.
“It is possible your suit of armor might have feelings for the Captain,” Vision answered. “Have you asked it?”
“Do you regret it?” The man’s brow wrinkled as a sudden thought struck him. “Marking at the news conference? The spotlight?”
“Yeah, thanks,” Tony said, waving him off. “Happy… Winter Solstice? Is that what you do?” Strange floated off without answering. “I should have asked guests to fill out a form,” Tony muttered.
“The video call request is from Colonel Rhodes,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. announced, far too loudly for this time in the morning.
Taking a half-step back, Steve wiped his fingers over his eyes. “Oh, wow, sorry about that.” He laughed awkwardly, throat sounding wet and clogged.
“Fair enough.” Tony spun on the seat just enough to lean back into the corner of the couch and put his feet up onto Steve’s lap. He put the subtitles on the screen but left it on mute, relaxing as best he could.
“Oh, Cap’s coming back—it appears he’s defending himself in regards to a question about being homophobic. Can we get a closer shot?”
“You know,” Wanda mused, “if he wasn’t Captain America, people wouldn’t be thinking of it like the flag. I’ve seen other red and blue marks, even ones with white, and nobody really comments on them.”
“Well, that’s different,” Bucky said. He gave Natasha a fond smile. “Nat and I were made for each other.”
“No,” Steve interrupted, holding up a hand. “It’s true. Doesn’t matter what you meant, Buck. We all know Tony and I aren’t meant to be.”
Now, sitting here with the man he’d admired for years, Steve realized there was never going to be a good time to tell Tony the truth. Maybe Tony wasn’t averse to the idea of a non-soulmate romance. They could have a good relationship even without marks. And what was the point in waiting around eternally? Neither of them had found their matches yet, after all. They might never.
Sam dragged the guy around to the hallway. “Come on, let’s go.” He started dragging the man back to the main entrance. Bruce got up and followed along as backup, twisting his neck around. The man became a lot more pliant when he saw who was behind him.
Daredevil stood up and leaned against the telephone pole, casually shrugging. “I heard you might need some help with the robots.”
Tony slid into a booth right next to one of the large windows. He leaned back, letting his head fall on top of the cracked pleather that covered the seat. After a moment, Steve followed his lead. He sat on the opposite side of the booth without looking away from his long-time friend, newly-found soulmate.
“—in deep discussion, possibly to do damage control. An unexpected soulmate reveal of this magnitude is sure to have lasting repercussions that we don’t—”
“Are you an idiot? Of course that’s what I mean!” The desk rattled as Jameson slammed his fist down on it once more. “Everyone’s covering the same story, but it’s the only story people are buying! We need it!”
