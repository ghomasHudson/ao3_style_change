He takes out another flannel and puts it on. It’s a little too big but it’s comfortable and smells like Dean which is strangely calming right now.
The sky was still dark and grayish and seemed as sad as everyone else attending the funeral. Cas stares at into the grave they just lowered Dean’s coffin into. Dean’s coffin. Dean. They just lowered his dead body into a six feet deep hole with dirt everywhere.
CAS lets Dean sleep until he’s finished packing everything they need for the road trip. When he enters the bedroom to wake Dean up he finds him awake already, sitting on the bed, the box with all his old records in it, on his lap, a slight smile on his lips. Cas leans against the doorframe and watches Dean slipping through the records. The Winchester suddenly looks up at Cas and his smile grows wider but the Novak has to realize in sorrow that it’s still not fully reaching his eyes.
Cas hesitates for a brief moment but then he goes back into the room and lies down next to the now asleep Winchester. He has to tell him for sure but it’ll make everything even worse. He got all the letters of Dean, he still has them in the drawer of his desk. Dean always wrote about how nice it was to have Jeremy at his side. Someone he felt safe with. He usually finished his letters with ‘send all my loving to my baby’. Telling Cas a simple but everything meaning ‘I love you’.
Castiel sits down onto the bed and releases a breath he didn’t know he was holding. He lets his eyes wander around the room until they fall onto the thin chain with Dean’s dog tags. The Novak gets up and fishes them off the nightstand. He sighs before he slips them over his head and lets the chain dangle under his shirt.
“Wanna come inside?” Cas asks which pulls Dean out of his thoughts and he nods. Cas slowly opens the door and leads into the comfortable looking, not too big, hallway. The yellow glow of some decorations throws a warm and calming light onto the cozy looking furniture which is made out of mahogany. Dean feels tears creeping into his eyes but he holds them back and smiles a little. When did he become this emotional? Cas smiles back at Dean and squeezes his hand slightly before pulling the Winchester into the bedroom. He lets Dean sit down on the king sized bed and realizes in sorrow how Dean instantly presses his back against the in light grey painted wall but he remains silent.
“It’s, it’s not alright but please don’t apologize, Dean. We’ll fix all this, we will.” Dean nods slowly and looks right at Cas. “Please don’t leave me.”, “I won’t, Dean, I promise.”
The Winchesters wrists are still wrapped with white bandages but otherwise Cas can’t spot anything out of the ordinary.
‘God Cas, this is so egoistic.’ He hates himself for thinking that way but he can’t stop it.
He just said goodbye to Sam and Jess and put his bag into the Impala – Sam urged him to keep her and he agreed after a lot of arguing – when Sam runs out of the door and pulls him into a tight hug again.
Then he picks up Dean and carefully carries him up to the backdoor to lay him onto the bench in the back.
“I’m doctor Smith, I’m the guy who stitched you back up. Anyway I talked to your brother and friend here last night, and I’m gonna tell you the same now.”
“We’ll work it out. We always work things out.” Cas whispers and feels how Dean nods. They stay like that for some time, foreheads resting against each other, Cas’ hands still cupping Dean’s cheeks, eyes closed, both breathing calm.
It wasn’t supposed to sound like a threat in any way but for Dean it sounded like one so he made her clear that he will talk to someone.
The thick snowflakes are still dancing through the cold air and the Christmas decoration in the windows with the warm yellow light lets the white house with its big window and now snow covered roof shimmer. The big garden which stretches around the house is covered in untouched snow and Cas smiles at the view. Everything will be back to normal again. No worries about Dean or anything like the past four years. “Dean? Wake up, we’re here.” Cas whispers and touches Dean’s shoulder until the Winchester flinches, nearly punching Cas. ”Sorry, I’m sorry.” He mumbles but Cas just shakes his head with a warm smile. “It’s alright Dean. No need to apologize.” Cas whispers and Dean looks at him with sad, green eyes. Cas points outside the window and Dean follows his finger, his mouth dropping open when he realizes what Cas is pointing at. “Cas is this?” he whispers and Cas nods with a bright smile on his lips.
“How is he?” Jess asks again, Cas just shakes his head.                                                          “It’s difficult. There are these moments where he’s happy and everything and one second later he has another breakdown. He just stops talking and I can’t touch him without scaring him like hell. I didn’t believe that he would be the exact same person afterwards. I mean you can’t expect that after what happened.” Cas stops and has to swallow the lump in his throat.                                 “Jess, I don’t know what to do. I wanna help Dean but I don’t know what to do. I just want him back.” Cas voice breaks and is just a whisper at the end, tears burning in his eyes.                             He feels so bad for thinking like that but he can’t help it. “Don’t think that you can’t do anything for him. Give him the time he needs, don’t push him and make clear that you’ll be there for him and that he can always come to you and talk.” Jess hugs Cas and he nods before he leaves the kitchen to look after Dean.                       “Hey Cas.” Sam hugs his friend before he turns to Jess. “Cas I think Dean wants you to be with him for a moment.” Cas nods and heads to the living room where Dean disappeared into a minute ago.                                                                                   The living room contains two light brown sofas under a big window and a big bookshelf completely covering the right wall of the room.                  Dean is sitting on one of the sofas, face buried in his hands.        “Hey.” Cas whispers to make sure Dean won’t flinch when he sits down next to him.                                                                       The Winchester shivers lightly and moves closer to Cas who lies an arm around Dean’s shoulders, pulls the Winchester closer against his chest and Dean soon buries his face against Cas’ neck.                                                                                    “I can’t even talk to Sammy without crying like a little kid.” Dean whispers into Cas neck who shakes his head and wraps his arms even stronger around Deans shivering body.                                     “What happened with me, Cas?” Dean whispers in a broken voice which makes Cas hearts aching and he feels like he can’t breathe properly anymore.                                                                     “Dean, don’t” is the only thing he manages to whisper into Dean’s hair not knowing how to lighten up Dean’s mood at least a little.             “I can’t get these pictures out of my head and I’ve dreamed about you and waking up to this fucking reality every time, Cas, don’t take it the wrong way, but what if I am just dreaming again?”               Dean looks up at Cas who just shakes his head over and over again.                                                                               “You are not dreaming Dean. I am real like Sam and Jess are. All of this,” Cas cups Dean’s cheeks with his hands to wipe the tears away with his thumbs, “is real!” he finishes with a soft smile.             Dean suddenly leans forward and presses his lips onto Cas’ like Cas did the last time when he told Dean that he isn’t dreaming. Both of them sit up straight and Dean wraps his arms around Cas’ neck before he presses his body closer against Cas’.                           They keep kissing until Cas lets himself fall onto his back which makes Dean land onto him with a chuckle.                                 They press their lips together once again before Dean starts kissing down Cas’ neck. Cas begins to lift Dean’s shirt which makes the Winchester pull back in a sudden.                                “Sorry.” He mumbles before he completely moves away from a now confused Cas.                                          “Dean, it’s alright.” Cas says while he sits up too but Dean just buries his face in his hands once again and sighs. “I’m sorry Cas, I can’t, my back-.” Dean stops and shrugs his shoulders, which makes Cas feel tears welling up in his eyes.                                  He saw Deans back and yet he doesn’t know what Dean is really talking about right now.                                                        “What is it?” Cas has to resist the urge to pull the Winchester close against his chest, too afraid it might scare him. “Did you see it, my back?” Dean asks after a short pause, his voice not a whisper anymore and Cas nods until he realizes that Dean can’t see him. “Yes.” he answers unsure what else to say.                                     Dean shrugs his shoulders before he completely breaks down, Cas doesn’t think twice and just wraps his arms around the now shivering Winchester.                                                             “I don’t wanna live like that.” Dean whispers after some time which makes Cas look up. “Live like what?” Cas hopes that him asking even more questions is okay with Dean who went silent again.                                                              Dean sighs before he answers. “No matter what I do, it always reminds me of what happened. I fucked up. Man they killed all these people and I couldn’t stop it. Hell I killed people too. Some of them were-kids” Dean’s voice gets louder with every sentence before it falls back into a whisper. “I tried, Cas, I really tried but I wasn’t strong enough and-“ “Dean, stop.” Cas whispers, presses his lips into Dean’s hair and feels the Winchester shaking his head.                                        “I should have died too, I wasn’t strong enough to-“ “Stop it Dean! You survived that shit.” Sam appears in the doorframe, crosses the room and crouches down next to Cas and Dean who slowly lifts his head to look at Sam. The older Winchester’s eyes are lightly red but he hasn’t been crying.                                                                                Sam lets one hand rest on his brother shoulder. ”You survived, you are back home, you are a lot but definitely not weak.” Sam tries to reassure Dean who just closes his eyes. “But I’m the only one they sent home. I should’ve stayed oversea, should’ve helped the rest of my unit, those who were still alive. You know why they sent me home?”                                                          Dean stands up in a sudden, his face showing off his sudden anger. “They sent me home cause I wasn’t able to fight anymore cause I turned out to be not strong enough!” Dean hisses before he turns around and storms out of the living room.                             Cas leans back and sighs. That’s definitely not how he wanted this day to turn out.                                                                     He again feels like he isn’t able to help Dean in any way especially not in working through all this.                                       The Winchester will refuse to see a therapist as long as he is clear in his mind and he is totally not crazy.                                Sam sits down next to Cas and just stares at the ground.                       Cas catches himself thinking these egoistic things again and stands up to help Jess in the kitchen to get some distraction.              “What are you cooking?” Cas stops when he sees Jess standing in front of the stove with some post on it. “Pasta, you both like pasta right?” she asks softly and Cas nods with a small smile.   “Can I help you with anything?” Cas still hopes to get distracted and if it just lasts for a few seconds.                                        “Sure. Could you set up the table and get Sam and Dean? It’ll be finished in a minute or so.” Cas nods, takes the plates and forks and heads to the room next to the living room where the table is.        Cas sets the plates and forks down before he turns around to get Sam from the living room.                                                        The Winchester smiles slightly at Cas who leaves again to get Dean.                                                                                He knocks onto the door of the room that Jess gave them for the time they planned to stay before they head off to Manhattan.              “What?” Dean answers in a quiet voice and Cas carefully opens the door.                                                                                     Dean is sitting on the bed, back pressed against the headboard under a big window. Next to the bed are a small nightstand and a closet both in dark wood.                              Dean’s eyes are wide open in panic and his breathing goes flat. “Dean, are you alright?” Cas asks and could punch himself in the same moment for asking such a stupid question.                                ‘Of course he’s not alright, don’t you see it?’ says the quiet voice in his head when Dean nods. Cas sits down next to the Winchester and stares at the open door.                                      “Wanna eat something? Jess made pasta.” Cas tries and gives Dean his time to answer.                                                            “’m not hungry.” he mumbles and Cas nods slowly but he doesn’t leave Dean’s side.                                                              Both remain silent until Dean opens his eyes a few seconds later. “Why are you still here?” he looks confused but somehow relieved and Cas brings himself to smile a little.                                          “I don’t think you should be alone right now and I’m sorry for not being here earlier.” Cas whispers still feeling horrible for realizing this too late but Dean just shakes his head.                          “I’m fine. Just needed some time on my own, c’mon I’m hungry.” Dean jumps off the bed and heads for the door only to stop when realizing that Cas isn’t following.                                           “C’mon man. I mean it, I’m fine. Let’s eat something.” Dean smiles though he knows that he can’t fool Cas but fooling himself is better than nothing.                                                  He just needs to keep telling himself that he is fine and he’ll hopefully belief it after some time.                                              Cas slowly gets up and follows Dean to the dining room where he can smell the pasta Jess made and it makes him realize how hungry he actually is.                                                                    Cas is about to enter the room when he realizes that Dean stopped, his eyes closed, breath going steady but shivering.     “Dean, what is it?”
“Wanna go inside?” Cas slowly asks and Dean nods, turning around to grab his bag from the Impala but Cas holds him back. “We’ll grab it later.” Cas smiles and grabs Dean’s hand, waiting for him to turn back to facing the house before they step through the snow and stop right in front of the stairs leading up to the front door. The door is made out of wood and painted in a light grey. Cas searches his pockets for the key while Dean squeezes the other hand in excitement.
Chapter 6: Dean go hurt real bad and had to go to the hospital to stop the bleeding. The nurse there really wanted him to see a therapist but Dean reassured her that he and Castiel can work it out and that he doesn't need to see a professional and that he's fine. Cas meanwhile is really worried about Deans condition which doesn't seem to get better but wants to give Deans self-therapy a shot. (They end up having sex and that's right where Chapter 7 starts)
“Dean, don’t you think it would be better for you if you stayed here for a little longer. At least until your-” “Until I’m what Sam?” Dean nearly yells and stands up. “Until I don’t get nightmares anymore? Until I don’t get flashbacks of them fucking torturing anymore? Until I stop missing Cas? Or wait,” Dean has a light smile on his lips now, “until I’ll stop wanting to kill myself?” he got awfully quiet at the end and Sam can’t help but stare at his brother in horror. “Guess what Sammy,” his voice is only a whisper now. “That’s never gonna happen. Excuse me, I gotta pack my bag.” Dean leaves the room and Sam kind of just folds in on himself, helpless and out of ideas.
“I’m not gonna upset your brother any further. And you promise me to not upset John. And if you need anything, just call me. But Sam,” he can feel the Winchester nod. “I’ll have to talk to Dean about him- about what happened.” “Just don’t do it tonight.” Sam half pleads and the Novak assures him that he’ll be careful. “Text me when you’re home, and drive safe.” “I will, thanks Cas.”
He feels like he deserves it, the pain, all of it. He swore himself that he would protect Jeremy with all cost but he couldn't because he was drowning in his own pain, didn't even think about his friend after getting back home.
He presses his eyelids together and his hands against his temples just wanting it all to stop. He didn’t realize he started screaming until Sam bursts through the door and pulls his brother up into a sitting position.
The snow keeps falling and buries the grey asphalt under its beautiful shimmering white. Its four days until Christmas and Cas has never been as excited for Christmas. The thought of spending those days with Dean again makes his heart jump in overwhelming joy. “Dean?” Cas realizes that Dean had started to cry, face still buried against Cas’ neck, arms still wrapped around Cas’s chest while silent sobs shiver through his body. Cas presses his lips into Deans hair and breathes in Deans well known scent. It feels so unreal, all of it, holding the Winchester in his arms again. “Dean, hey, wanna go home?” Cas asks quietly, careful not to push Dean in any direction and gives him time to answer. “I’m home.” Dean whispers while pressing his body closer against Cas’, seeking for the warmth he hasn’t felt for four long years. Cas feels tears slipping down his cheeks and he buries his face in Dean’s hair again. He won’t let the Winchester go another time.
Cas wakes up from Dean shivering and pressing even more against Cas body who just wraps his arms around Dean to calm him. “It’s okay Dean, I’m here.” Cas mumbles and places a kiss onto the Winchesters head. “Jus’ a bad dream.” Dean whispers but keeps pressing his face into the crook of Cas’ neck. “Wanna talk about it?” Cas tries and feels relief when Dean nods lightly. That looks like a good start to him. “I want them to stop Cas. You have to make them stop.” Dean whispers and Cas gets confused. “The dreams?” he doesn’t know what Dean means. “Make them stop hurting us for nothing.” Dean whimpers, face pressed against Cas’ neck who starts to get what Dean means. “They aren’t hurting anyone anymore. You’re safe with me.” Cas reassures Dean. “Don’t worry about that. I’m here for you.” Cas whispers into Dean’s hair and feels how Dean nods lightly. They stay in that embrace until both of them fall asleep again.
“Please don’t touch me.” he says quietly and Cas nods but stays right where he is.
He most likely lost Dean. The love of his life. He lost him because of how selfish he was, because of how he couldn’t deal with the Dean that came back. Because he wanted normality or at least thought that this was what he wanted. And he fucked up. Fucked up everything.
What if he forgets his voice? There is no record of Dean’s voice. How is he supposed to remember the Winchesters- how can he make sure that he will remember everything?
"I punched the mirrow, must've slit my wrist while I slipped, didn't even recognize it." Dean whispers, eyes closed and all of them pray that the ambulance will arrive any minute.
“Cas, they asked me to come and I didn’t even think about going there. I owe him at least one goodbye.” Dean whispers not daring to look into Cas’ eyes, afraid to discover disappointment in them. “Dean, please, look me in the eyes.” In a sudden Dean’s eyes start wandering around in a hush and Dean’s breath goes flat and fast.
“Fuck!” he yells and throws the box against the closest wall before he just sinks onto the ground unable to breathe. “Fuck, fuck, fuck.” he mutters while his breaths come out fast and unsteady.
They work fast and get Dean out in less than ten minutes, showing Cas to come with them. Jess nods at the lost looking man and reassures him that Sam and she will follow them in any minute. Cas nods  before he leaves with the ambulance.
Jess, Cas and Dean are sitting at the table waiting for Sam. Dean looks like usual. A little smirk on his face but his eyes still blank and unfocused.
The fireworks are still lighting up the sky and dancing snowflakes, creating a beautiful and shimmering mix of silver and golden glowing everywhere.
The silence seems strained and like something or someone is about to explode in a matter of seconds. But no one does.
Of darkness in the valley]
“Go and eat something, Jess is still waiting, I’ll take care of Dean. You really need some time on your own Cas.” Sam reassures him with a soft smile before he leads Cas out of the room.
Dean grabs Cas’ hand, squeezes it lightly and pulls him to the table where Jess and Sam are already waiting.
IF you have any questions, just comment and I hope I can answer them.
The Novak instantly left the room and the hospital after Dean’s revelation. He knew it, of course he did because it was more than obvious but hearing it right from Dean was worse than getting kicked in the balls. It hurt, it hurt way too much. He couldn’t even describe the pain he was in. He had a headache from thinking so he wandered around the quiet and dark parking lot. There weren’t many people around in the middle of the night which was good.
“I just got one bed, I mean I couldn’t really tell her that you are here too, you know how they start to ask questions and-“, Cas stops rambling and takes a look at Dean who looks at the bed uneasily. “Dean, you alright?” Cas closes the door and steps in front of the Winchester to make him look at Cas.
“Alright. This is just some kind of check up. Dean has been here years ago for therapy so he more or less knows how things run around here.” “What?” he never knew Dean went here for therapy. He knew about his diagnoses so he must’ve been to therapy at some point in his life but the Winchester never told him anything else.
“Dean?” Cas can’t interpret the look in Dean’s eyes. They are blank, no emotions showing and Cas is scared of Dean falling back into his catatonic state. “Dean?” Cas moves closer to the Winchester and Dean backs away, trying to protect his head before he curls up into a small ball. “Dean, it’s me, Cas.” He should have never told him, especially not on Christmas. But he is just stupid while trying to not be too egoistic.
“Dean, you know that you can tell me everything and you know that I wanna help you but I can’t do that as long as you’re not talking to me.” Cas tries to make the Winchester look at him but he just stares at the ground.
Dean wraps his arms around Cas’ neck when Cas lifts the Winchester up and presses him against the wall before he starts to place kisses all over Dean’s body.
He holds back a sob and wipes his now tear streaked cheeks with the arm of the flannel before he pulls out the letter.
“What’d you do there?” Garth suddenly asks and Dean sees him pointing at his right arm. His flannel managed to ride up a little and shows quite a lot of the huge band-aid he used for covering the stitches.
“I’m Castiel Novak, we talked on the phone.” the bartender doesn’t say anything anymore but Dean feels how he leaves to give him and Cas some space.
“Cas, please stay.” Dean whispers pleading and Cas nods. “I’ll just grab something to drink. I’m back in a second.” Cas strokes his hand through Deans hair before he hurries to get a glass of water to get back to Dean as fast as possible. He sets the glass onto the nightstand next to the photos and the record player, lies down next to Dean and pulls him closer, not thinking of Dean’s new habit which is to keep his back against the wall at all cost. Dean tries to push himself back against the wall and Cas releases his grip as soon as he realizes what he’d done and moves closer to Dean who just buries his face in the crook of Cas’ neck, silent tears running down his cheeks. Cas kisses Dean’s head over and over again to calm the Winchester down until he finally falls asleep.
“Dean? Is pasta alright? I don’t really have anything else here right now.” Jess sits down next to the Winchester who hasn’t moved since Cas left a few hours ago. “Yeah, pasta’s fine. Lt me help you.” His voice is weak and he looks really beaten down but Jess can’t get herself to tell him to rest so she makes him follow her to the kitchen.
The Impala comes to a stop and he’s on the floor puking his guts out only a few seconds later. His chest feels like someone wrapped a thick rope around and just pulled it tight, and there’s a lump in his throat not letting in any new air. He dry heaves again and tries to get that much need oxygen in his lungs but his body just doesn’t cooperate. He slumps against the Impala when everything slowly turns to black.
Sam sits down next to his brother and they all take a toast to finally have some breakfast.
“I have an idea for Christmas.” Cas whispers into Dean’s hair who looks up a few seconds later. “What about a road trip? We’ll start tomorrow and we’ll be in Manhattan on Christmas Eve.” Cas whispers and looks into Dean’s eyes trying to figure out what the Winchester is thinking but there is no emotion in Dean’s eyes. No sadness, no happiness, just like he’s dead with the difference that he isn’t. He sits in front of Cas a slight smile on his lips but it doesn’t reach his eyes. Dean leans forward, lets his forehead rest against Cas’ and closes his eyes.
Even Dean knows that he needs some kind of help to get through all of it but he refuses to completely believe it.
Cas just sits there, staring at Dean who started shivering and mumbling quietly, too quiet for Cas to understand.
After lying down he just snuggles close against Dean’s chest and breathes in the well known and loved scent of him.
“Do you guys need any help, I mean with covering things up or something like that?” Jess asks softly and Cas slowly shakes his head. “No, but thank you.” Cas smiles at Jess who nods reassuringly.
“I’m fine, just needed a second Sammy.” Dean gets up and leaves his confused brother behind.
Cas wakes up from Dean moving which makes his eyes snap open worried Dean could be suffering from another nightmare but instead he just gets up and out of bed. The Winchester walks around the room to grab some clothes and that’s when Cas realizes the thick pink stripes of skin covering nearly all of Dean’s back. How didn’t Cas recognize this before?
“I’m sorry Dean. I lo-” “Stop! Fucking stop it!” Dean whisper yells since his voice is still gone before he turns around and walks back to the Impala, gets inside and drives away without looking back. Not noticing how Castiel finally lets himself break while watching the Impala disappear in the distance.
Cas begins to softly kiss Deans neck and Dean lets his head rest on Cas shoulder, moaning a little.
Dean gets up, pulls ten dollars out of his pocket and lays them on the table.
“He’s here too? No, no that can’t be. You have to leave!” Dean looks right into Sam’s eyes when Cas enters the room and kneels down next to Sam who has a twisting and flinching Dean in his arms, not daring to release the grip even a little while trying to stay calm his own.
The unsuspecting victim
Dean’s mood lightens up when he pulls out a pair of black and red wool socks. “I got that letter you sent to me writing about how cold your feet were and that you could really need a new pair of socks.” Cas says with a smile and Dean smiles back before he wraps his arms around Cas who didn’t expect that. He usually doesn’t get socks as a gift for Dean but he bought them already and thought it would lighten the Winchester’s mood as it obviously did.
“Misses Forester called last night.” Cas whispers not knowing how to tell Dean. “What is it? Is Jeremy back home?” hope flickers in Dean’s eyes and Cas has to look away, not wanting to see the hope disappear from Dean’s eyes. “Cas?” Dean’s voice gets forced and Cas closes his eyes.
He gets into the Impala, Dean already sitting shotgun which leaves Cas driving again, still not saying a word they head off to the nearest diner to get some breakfast.
Cas strokes his thumbs through Dean’s hair before he slowly lies the Winchester down and gets off the hood and opens the back door of the Impala.
The Winchester stays quiet after that.
"Sam appears in the doorway and just stands there unsure of what to do.
“You wanna go alone?” Cas asks to make sure that the Winchester doesn’t feel uncomfortable with him around. “No!” Dean answers immediately and pulls away a little to look into Cas’ ocean blue eyes.
I don't get why all my chapters seem so freaking short xD
His life always seemed quite normal. There never was anything happening that people would describe as exciting or something close. He was a stoner and friends with a punk but that didn’t change the fact that his life always had something boring to it. And there were days he wished something exiting would happen, no matter what but at the same time he hoped for his life to stay the way it was because it seemed quite perfect.
They step out of the cat after a brief moment of silence and are now looking directly at the Manhattan skyline. The sky is dark and light snow is dancing through the air shimmering in a bright white because of the city lights before it finally falls to the ground, building a thin layer of white and untouched snow.
“Sorry.” Dean mumbles, his eyes closed while Cas slowly shakes his head. “You don’t need to apologize, Dean. Just- just talk to me.” Dean shrugs his shoulders. “The old wood reminds me of the huts.” Dean whispers, gets up and leaves Cas on his own.
“Dean, stop it!” “What have I done?” Dean’s mumbling gets louder and the Novak stops fighting with getting a good grip on Dean’s wrists.
“Please. I’m worried.” “Just go.” his voice seems higher but more raspy and Cas shakes his head until he realizes that Dean can’t see him. “No.” “I just- just gimme a minute.” it’s just a little above a whisper now and the Novak isn’t sure if he should just pick the lock. Something he did way too often in his life already.
They release each other and Dean gets into the passenger seat while Cas gets into the driver seat and starts the motor. They wave at Jess and Sam through the rear view mirror for a second before they turn around the block and out of view
Cas smiles a little and grabs the bandages that were discarded on the floor.
The shadow in the background of the morgue
Dean slowly walks to the living room with the sofa and Cas takes a glance at the clock in the hallway. It’s only quarter past three at night and he sighs. He can’t leave Dean alone but he should really get some more sleep.
He just threw his bag onto his bed when Sam appears in his room and throws himself around Dean, pulling his older brother into a tight hug.
He believed that Dean was getting better with every day and now it’s even worse than when they started the road trip.
“Cas?” he hears Sam’s voice and a knock on the door. “Second.” he rasps and gets up to not look like he lost it all. He opens the door and looks at Sam.
"Just a friendly advice abut I think it'll be easier for him to cope with all of it if he goes to see a professional." Sam nods and sits down next to Cas.
“You managed to come home too.” he looks wasted but not as bad as he did the last time Dean has stayed away for a week. “Yeah.”, “That’s all? No explanation?”, “I thought Sammy told you that I stayed with Cas?” his father just shakes his head and disappears into the living room again. Dean takes this as his clue to quietly get upstairs into his room.
He fucked up. He really did and he couldn’t even make it right when he got the chance to. And now he lost Dean.
Dean takes a fast shower and just lets himself fall into the bed. He just has to fall asleep before he starts thinking again. Because if that happens he’s probably not gonna get any sleep at all.
The Winchester stays silent and stares at his feet hanging of one side of the bed. The doctor waits a little and when it’s obvious that Dean won’t say anything he continues.
“I really need a shower.” he answers and Dean just nods before he closes his eyes again, falling back into a light sleep.
“Dean, we’re here.” Cas wakes up Dean as careful as possible but the Winchester still flinches a little before he finally realizes where he is.
Cas is unsure if he should ask Dean about driving and with this thought the picture of Deans scarred back gets back into his mind. He really wants to ask Dean about that but he is afraid that the Winchester will lock himself in his mind even after he just got a lot more talkative.
“Oh, yeah, just a scratch. Kinda feel into glass.” he tries to keep his voice steady and is proud when he actually manages to do so. “Dean, you know you can talk to me.” Garth says quietly and looks at the Winchester with soft eyes, making Dean turn his head to the ground. ‘Fuck he knows’ is the first thing going through his mind but he just gets up with a smile.
The wave of nausea hits Dean again and Dean dry heaves into the toilet. There’s nothing left in his stomach and his throat already hurts like a bitch.
Dean presses his back against the wall behind him, fear in his eyes and Cas moves back, realizing he’s the reason Dean is scared.
Sam pads lightly onto his older brother’s shoulder and Dean squeezes Sam’s hand a little before Sam leaves the room behind Jess.
“Sammy? You here? You have to leave before they hurt you.” Dean whispers, pain and fear like a hunted animal in his eyes.
The Winchester holds up his blanket, a sign for Cas to crawl under it next to his boyfriend.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean, hey, come on.” Cas’ voice is softer now and he slowly starts caressing Dean’s cheek a little to get him back into reality.
“What have I done, what have I done, what have I done, what-” “Dean! Hey! Look at me!” Cas yells and lifts Dean’s head a little to look into his eyes.
She didn’t believe him but nodded anyway, not forgetting that she said she’ll call him in a few days, asking how he feels and that she’ll drag him to a therapist if she has to.
“You can take a shower if you want.” Dean steps out of the bathroom just wearing boxer briefs and Cas has to keep himself from staring at Dean’s now even more visible abs. Cas nods before he gets up and Dean steps out of the bathroom door to let Cas through.
Cas doesn’t know what to say to Dean to make it alright again. “No one leaves! Not me, not you! Did I make myself clear?” he yells and nods lightly. “And you deserve to be here as much as everyone else!” he keeps yelling, suddenly damn angry at the Winchester. Angry and really lost. He doesn’t know what could actually help Dean. He tried everything over the past week, everything he could do. And Dean seemed to get better, to get back to his old self and Cas should’ve realized way earlier that it was an act. And he did, he thinks but obviously not enough. To egoistic to admit it, and that’s where it got them.
“Merry Christmas, Cas.” Dean whispers leaning against Cas’ chest. “Merry Christmas, D.” Cas whispers before their lips touch softly.
“Okay, the wounds are healing fine, just try to keep a band-aid on them to prevent dirt from getting in there and use the stuff to help the healing that I’ll prescribe to you.” Dean just nods, no urge to talk to the Doctor at the moment. He just gets his prescription and is about to leave when he hears his Doctor calling his name again.
After a hundred miles he pulls the car onto the grass next to the room puts it in park and gets out. He needs fresh air and something to quieten his mind since the music in the radio stopped working miles ago.
The snow is silencing all the sounds of the city and is now lightened up in what seems like amounts of different colors, but mainly a comfy golden light which reminds of Christmas and winter days in the living room in front of a crackling fire.
“Wanna go to bed?” he still thinks that if he talks too loud he will scare Dean. The Winchester nods and lies back down, back pressed against the wall and Cas hopes that Dean will someday tell him what happened.
“We- we could try it again Cas. I know we can do it, please don’t leave me. I- I need you.” Dean’s voice is a whisper and Castiel really has to try to keep up his facade and not let it crumble in front of Dean.
Cas sits onto the bench in the back too and lets Dean’s hand rest on his lap.
The new year’s firework starts and a light of red, blue, green and gold covers the dark and cloudy sky and lights up the snow covered ground even more.
“You alright?” Cas asks, his face close to Dean’s and he feel the Winchester’s warm breath panting against his skin and it gives him goosebumps. “I am.” Cas smiles before he slightly lifts his head to kiss the Winchester with passion.
“Do you wanna talk about it Dean?” he asks, voice softer than just a moment ago, but Dean shakes his head. “I don’t think there’s anything to talk about Cas.” He nearly whispers and pulls back completely, wiping the streams of tears from his cheeks.
“I think we should get back to Dean’s room.” Cas says and starts walking back to the hospital entry when he realizes that Sam isn’t following and stops. “Sam? What is it?” “I- I have to go back home. Dad doesn’t know. And he can’t find out.” Sam whispers, tears in his eyes. “Cas, promise me you don’t get angry on Dean during the next few days alright? I’ll try to come by as often as possible but I can’t promise.” the seventeen year old was full on sobbing now and Castiel just pulls him into a tight hug.
“I’m sorry.” he chokes on the words and Sam tightens the hug a little. “I know. Please don’t let it eat you up.” “How can you not hate me Sam?” he pulls back not understanding anything anymore. “How can you not hate me? How can you not hate the guy that got your brother there?” he yells and points at the hole next to them. Tears stream down his face and he has to collect all his strength to keep standing.
Cas let’s himself fall back onto the bed, his head landing on the pillow and Dean keeps kissing him until both of them need a short break to catch their breath.
"Dean?" Cas pulls him out of his thoughts and Dean mumbles a quiet 'yes'. "What did you do?" Cas mumbles into the WInchesters hair where he buried his face in and Dean sighs while Jess keeps wiping off the blood.
The moment they shared after the fireworks seems forgotten just some happy memory in the back of their minds that could’ve happened years ago.
Dean’s head is resting against the window of the door, his eyes are closed and his body is way more relaxed than the past days.
“You couldn’t have known Sam. There was no way you could’ve. I mean it.” he can feel Sam nod a little and lean a little closer into the hug.
The next few days seem to go by in a blur. Jess shows him how to cook a load of dishes and they actually taste good. Sam tries to get Dean to go outside and take walks with him as much as possible and they actually seem to help, at least temporary.
“I don’t like how they make me feel?” Dean whispers and turns back to face the ceiling. “Wanna go to the doctor to get it checked out?” Cas asks confused but he can sense Dean shaking his head. “No, they’re working perfectly fine, and that’s the problem. I’m not sure I wanna get better in that sense. Yeah, that suicidal stuff is shit but I’m quite fond with the sadness Cas. It’s-” Dean stops himself and sighs. “Sorry, I’m oversharing.”, “No, Dean. Stop it. You are allowed to open up to me, I wanna help you and even if it’s just listening to you. But please stop beating yourself up for ‘oversharing’.” Cas actually air quotes and the Winchester smirks at that.
“Alright, there’s not much more I’m allowed to ask you without Dean’s consent so just a few general questions.”
“Hey, everything’s alright.” Castiel whispers and sits down next to him. He reaches out to touch Dean and comfort him but he just flinches away and curls up more on himself.
“Cas, you there?” Dean pulls him out of his thoughts. “Man, you look sad as fuck.” Dean smiles and Cas could throw up, his stomach feels weird and a wave of nausea crawls up his throat.
He walks back to his car and realizes he hold his breath when he sits down behind the steering wheel again and breathes out.
Kinda the same warnings as in chapter 1. So in general don't read if you don't feel up to it
“Cas.” Sam sits down next to him, his long, shaggy, brown hair looks like he just got out of bed, though Castiel knows this is not true. He must’ve been up for quite some time now. The seventeen year old lets his head fall forward which leads to his hair falling over his eyes making them invisible for Cas.
“Tell me how I can help you and we’ll work it out.” “Just be here. I know how much of a stubborn asshole I am and I hate chick-flick moments, so just be there for-“ Dean stops and Cas know how difficult it is for the Winchester to admit that he needs someone to be there for him. But it’s a good sign. Dean starting to be that stubborn asshole, how he describes himself, again.
“Dean, please open the door or I will pick the lock.” Cas tries again and hears the click of the lock a minute later. The door opens and Dean steps out. His eyes are red rimmed and he looks completely beaten down. “I’m sorry.” Dean whispers and Cas just pulls the Winchester into a tight hug. “It’s alright.” “You shouldn’t have to take care of me.” “Dean, really. I can do it.” Cas pulls out of the hug and looks Dean up and down.
“Cas?” Sam asks as soon as the Novak closes the door of the apartment behind him. “What?” his voice is close to a whisper and he can’t really look at the younger Winchester.”What happened?” Cas just shakes his head and disappears into the room he and Dean shared.
He continues with getting his Polaroid camera and moves over to the door. He opens it turns around and takes a look at the room before he starts taking Polaroids of the room. He can’t just forget what Dean’s room looked like. He can’t forget Dean.
Cas slowly opens the door and sees the Winchester lying in a bed under the window staring at the wall in front of him. Eyes blank and unfocused like most of the time over the past days.
“I love you.” the Novak whispers and gets a small kiss with a mumbled, “love you too.” as a reply.
“I’m fine.” Dean answers before the curtain moves a little and Dean’s head appears, the cute and tempting smile on his face like in the good old days and Cas can’t resist to just cup Dean’s cheeks in his hands and kiss him before he steps under the shower next to Dean.
“Dean, wherever you are right now, it’s not real, you have to snap out of it.” with hope he looks directly at his boyfriend but nothing changed. “Dean! Snap the fuck out of it!” Cas half yells and slaps the Winchester who stumbles back at the pain radiating through his cheek.
Sam lets himself fall into Jess arms once the door is closed. He buries his face against her shoulder snd they stay in the safe embrace for a moment before both of them pull back a little to look into each others eyes. "I'm sorry Jess." Sam whispers and Jess leans forward a little to let her forehead rest against his. "For what?" "For this. I wanted us to have a great Christmas with Cas and Dean and now it's just messy." Sam whispers. He's not blaming Dean for anything, how could he? "Wanna head for the hospital?" Jess suddenly asks and Sam nods, thankful that she pulled him out of his thoughts.
Sam knows that Dean has to let all of it out sometime but he also knows that his brother is too proud and way too stubborn to really cry in front of anyone.
“Do you think his depression and PTSD got worse over the past months?” “No, I don’t think so, but he’s good at hiding it so I usually can’t really tell.” the doctor nods again and takes a look at the papers in his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
He isn’t sure how Dean is doing right now, all the emotions he was showing over the past days are just gone, turned into whatever and Cas doesn’t really know how to handle it.
When Dean’s breathing is nearly back to normal he pulls away and looks at Cas, tears streaming down his cheeks, eyes so full of guilt and sadness that it nearly knocks Cas over.
[Hello there,
“Fuck it.” he whispers, gets out, grabs his bag and goes up to the door and inside. The hallway is quiet and he takes off his shoes and is about to sneak into his room when his father appears in the doorway to the living room.
“Hey Garth, how you doing man?”, “I’m doing great, Dean. I mean college is annoying but it’s going well. Where where you though? Haven’t seen you for a while.”, “I was sick, I think I actually texted you last week, man.” Dean smiles and Garth nods while trying to carefully open his lunch box.
He doesn’t even hear Sam coming into the room trying to calm the Novak. “Cas. C’mon breathe, man.” Sam manages to uncurl him which seems to make the breathing a lot easier.
“Dean thinks- he’s back there- he didn’t realize- I dunno.” Cas voice fades away and Jess wraps her arms around him and pulls him into a hug so Cas can bury his face between her shoulder and neck while she slowly strokes one hand over his back.
“You won’t here much from me the next days since besides checking you stitches there isn’t much to do for me. But I’ll introduce you to hour therapist in a few minutes and you’ll be spending a lot of time with her. Alright?” It wasn’t really a question since Dean really had no choice but he nodded anyways.
Hey Cas,
THEY pack their bags into the trunk of the Impala before they turn back to Jess and Sam. “See ya.” Dean hugs Jess before he turns to his little brother. “Thanks for letting us stay.” He whispers and pulls Sam into a strong hug. “You can always come and stay as long as you need Dean. I’m glad you’re back.” Sam whispers and pulls his brother closer. “Me too Sammy.”
Cas sits down onto the chair next to the bed and just stares at his hands. He shouldn't have told Dean about Jeremys death. It just made everything worse. He should stop to be that egoistic asshole for Deans sake but he can't stop it, obviously. He thought he would just tell Dean and everythig would be just fine vut now it feels like Cas fucked up, which he kinda did.How is he supposed to make that right again. He still is kind of sure that Dean actually tried to kill himself but even if Dean would admit it they couldn't tell the doctors, they wouldn't let the Winchester leave and Castiel is sure it wouldn't help the Winchesters recover.
“Do you wanna go back to bed?” he asks quietly but Dean shakes his head. “I had a nightmare. I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep. Just- you can go back to bed. I can watch some TV.”
“Hey Dean.” his voice comes out raspy and he just sits down crossed leg in front of the grave. “I thought I’d- I’m sorry.” he just whispers before taking off the dog tags and breaking one of them off. He puts the necklace with now only one dog tag back around his neck and then starts digging a small but rather deep hole with his hands and puts the tag in it before he closes it. “I forgot to give them back to you, I’m sorry.”
What he actually knows is that he’s sitting in the living room of the apartment a now cold cup of tea in his hands, Jess next to him. No one has said a word. Not after Jess hugged him, told him that somehow everything will be alright, that somehow all of them will make it through, told him that Sam is in the hospital with Dean, told him that he has a low chance of making it and told him that she believes he will after he managed the past two days.
The older Winchester hisses again when Jess starts to wipe the blood off his swollen knuckles and he grabs Cas' hand and squeezes it until the cut starts to shoot finring pain through his whole body.
“C’mon I’m awesome, doc. Really. I have college to get back to.” “I think that will have to wait Dean. I hate to break it to you but you are here because of a suicide attempt. I am allowed and supposed to put you under suicide watch. And you can either make the next seventy-two hours really hard on yourself and be placed in a mental health facility after, or you work with me and get to decide whether you want to go to a mental health facility or continue therapy from home.”
He never managed to get across the country as fast he did after Dean’s call. He somehow managed to call the ambulance and get them to Sam’s apartment. He somehow managed to find a duffel bag where he threw some clothes into. He somehow managed to get the car started. He somehow managed to put the car into drive. He somehow managed to drive with his shivering hands- with everything shivering. He somehow managed to not think the whole drive.
Sleep deprivation is one of the methods they got him to talk but now there is nothing left to talk about.
“I- I don’t know how to start.” Dean stops and thinks about what he’s going to tell Cas.
The rain is now thundering down onto them and they’re wet to the bones in seconds.
“You’re home Dean.” He whispers and Dean wraps his arms around Cas before he buries his face in Cas’ neck tears burning in his eyes. He’s home, safe, he has Cas back and there’s nothing to worry about, right? “You waited for me?” Dean whispers and Cas nods, his lips pressed into Dean slightly longer hair. “I’ll always wait for you and nothing can change that.” Cas whispers and feels how Dean nods slightly.
First he was captured hoping to at least survive the next night, then he was home in a sudden and now he feels like the war was just a too real nightmare he isn’t able to get over a as fast as he’d like to.
But when Dean doesn’t answer he feels fear rushing through his body. “Dean! Open up!” he knocks against the dark wood and waits again. No answer. The only sound he can hear is quiet sobbing, the only proof that the Winchester is still there.
“Thank you so much.” Dean whispers unsure what else to say, still watching the glowing of the city from where he has one of the best memories with Cas.
“Dean? Sam and Castiel are here.” her voice is soft and soothing and her smile seems generous. “Just push the button if you need help.” She leaves and Sam and Cas are left in a huge hospital room.
“Dean, I’m gonna take you to our- my house. You can head to Sam and Jess in a day or two.” “Why do I have to leave? Cas we can work it out. I know we can.” Dean nearly whimpers, definitely sounding drunk now and it breaks Castiels heart. But he is set on his decision. He can’t do it anymore. He misses Dean. His Dean. The Dean before that stupid war. The Dean that never came back.
It usually was Cas who got comforted by the Winchester and it feels so unnatural the other way around.
“What happened?” Cas asks. “Didn’t I tell you?” “You just said it went out of hand.” “Yeah, that’s kinda what happened. Not like he was happy with me disappearing for a week. I mean I had to take care of Sammy.” Dean whispers and cuddles closer against Cas chest.
All the blood, all the screams mixed with the hot and sweaty air crashes back onto him from the deepest parts of his mind where he tried to bury it and he still can’t control it, can’t fight it and the only thing he can do is to hope that it’ll end any second.
As soon as the lock clicks open he opens the door completely and lets out the breath he didn’t know he was holding when there’s no pool of blood on the floor.
[If I lay here
They finally pull up in front of the apartment and Dean bolts out of the car, into the apartment and locks himself in the bathroom leaving a worried Castiel behind.
The Winchester finishes and Castiel lifts his head to look at Dean. He is staring at the ceiling, eyes a dazed and watery.
Cas nearly yells and with his hands cupping the Winchester’s face he lightly shakes him. Afraid that Dean will actually pass out on his watch.
The ride back to Sam’s was unusually quiet since Dean only stared out of the window and Castiel seemed to be at a loss of of words. Nothing he said or did over the past days helped the Winchester at all.
“I love you so much.” Dean mumbles into the kiss which makes Cas smile and he pulls the Winchester even closer against his body.
“It’s, I don’t know. This stupid sadness is all I know. It’s me Cas, I don’t know who I’d be without it so I just don’t wanna take those meds. I’m not really read for that.”, “I can’t do much about that Dean, you know that, but please consider calling that therapist. I know he can help you with all that and maybe someday you really wanna get better you know?”, “Yeah.”, “You deserve to be happy Dean.”
“Dean, don’t worry about this so much. Everybody understands how you feel about the past two years and everybody understands why you haven’t been at the funeral. It’s your decision, it always is. No one can tell you what to do, where to go or how to feel about any kind of situation. If you feel like you can’t do something in this one particular moment, don’t. I know that people are expecting a lot of each other these days, but please, don’t think that you acted the wrong way by not going to the funeral.”
“Dean!” pictures of Dean lying on the floor bleeding shoot through his mind and he pounds against the door. “Dean, open up, dammit!” he yells and waits for a response but when there’s none he doesn’t wait to get something to open the lock. He’s glad that those stupid doors have even more stupid locks.
When he reaches the huge house he has to stay in the Impala a little longer since there’s actually light burning and Cas seems to be home. Something the Winchester hoped would not be the case.
“Cas? Hey what is it?” Dean pulls him out of his thoughts. “Nothing.” Cas smiles and Dean kisses his chest again. “Wanna keep going?” Cas asks pulls at Dean’s shirt and the Winchester nods with a smile.
“I think we have some different opinions on that. You know why you’re here Mr. Winchester, don’t you?” “Call me Dean, otherwise I’ll feel really old.” “Alright Dean. Want to answer me?” “You some kind of shrink?” “No Dean, I’m not a therapist.”Doctor Smith stresses the word therapist and looks right at Dean.
“I don’t know what to do Sam. I am done. I thought he would come back, that he just needed some time to realize that he’s back home. But I don’t know what happened over there and I wanna help him with everything I’ve got but I can’t do that as long as Dean isn’t talking.” Sam nods slowly and Jess stays silent.” They offered him someone to work everything through with but he refused, told them he has me and that I’ll be able to help him. But I obviously can’t” Cas whimpers and Sam slowly nods, about to say something when they suddenly hear a cracking noise and glass shattering coming from the bathroom which makes Cas and Jess jump up immediately.
“Maybe we would’ve found something you wouldn’t have to go this far.” “Don’t pity me Castiel. Don’t do this. I don’t need pity or something like that. I am very well aware of what I did and I wish I would’ve succeeded.” “Don’t say that Dean. Just don’t.” “Great, first you want me talking and now that I am you can’t bear to hear the fucked up truth. I am sorry that you love me. I am sorry that I probably hurt you but yes, Cas, I very much wanna die!”
“Dean I think that talking to a professional would help-“ “I ain’t talking to these douche bags.” Dean hisses and Cas shakes his head. “But Dean it-“ “No Cas. I promise you I will talk to you and I’ll work it out with your help but please, please don’t force me to see a therapist. It’s the last thing I wanna do.” Dean begs, his eyes filled with tears and Cas lets his head drop so his chin rests on his chest.
“Fuck.” he whispers and sits back in the seat. “Fuck!” he yells, punching the steering wheel and his breathing becomes faster but this time he realizes it soon enough to get it back to normal. Breathe in. Hold. Breathe out. In. Hold. Out. He repeats as long as it takes him to calm down enough to not end up having a panic attack again and starts the motor to look for a motel before it gets dark.
He already felt better, lighter. Pot always made him feel better. He knows he’s probalby addicted by now but he agreed with himself that there definitely are worse things than being addicted to pot. There’s always something worse.
!!!TRIGGER WARNING!!!
Sam sighs, he knows how this will end. Dean will try to fool everyone only achieving to fool himself. Then he’ll get angry because he doesn’t know how to express his feelings in a different non chick-flick moment before he actually breaks down.
“Alright, why don’t we sit down here.” the doctor points at a small room with a chair and two chairs on each side on it. “Sure.” Castiel nods and follows the doctor inside. Both of them sit down and the Novak leans forward a little.
"Dean?" Cas carefully asks not wanting to scare Dean who doens't react even a little.
“Will he make it?” “I don’t know, no one does.” Sam whispers half of it and they just go quiet again. It’s not like there’s anything left to say.
“He sent me one, that’s why I called.” Cas whispers and Sam just nods.
“We don’t have to go if you don’t want to.” Cas whispers before he turns onto his side and pulls Dean’s body against his chest so he can relax his now tensed muscles.
“Dean it’s alright, no need to apologize to me or anyone.” Cas whispers and presses a kiss onto Dean’s head taking in the scent of the shampoo Dean used a few hours ago.
“What the fuck, Dean? How many drinks did you have?” Castiel finally managed to leave the bar as well and met Dean leaning against the Impala. His face looks sweaty and pale in the overhead light of the few street lamps and he sways heavier then before.
“Cas, please.” Dean moans and Cas nods, his lips slowly trailing down Dean’s chest making Dean whimper in lust.
“I really need to go man, I owe him that. I feel horrible for not appearing at that funeral, for burying myself in my mind to escape all the pain.” Sad and lightly red eyes are looking at Cas, his freckles standing out more than usual framing his green, tears leaking eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas slowly pulls the black shirt over Dean’s head and starts to carefully run his hands over the scars on Dean’s back.
He can’t control anything, like a prisoner in his own mind and body. He sees Cas and he knows for sure that Cas is talking to him but he can’t hear anything besides the blood rushing through his ears and occasional screams of people dying on his watch.
The road’s getting emptier by the afternoon and the woods followed by miles of wide fields under the blue sky which slowly changes into a light orange and purple during the sunset. Dean insisted on not listening to the radio for a while and Cas feels his heart beat faster in excitement when Dean stopped this act, turned the radio back on and started to hum along.
Don't read if you get triggered easily. I'll summarize this chapter at the beginning of the next one. So if you decide to not read this one you'll still know what happened.
Deans bed is right under a huge window and the guy lying in there doesn’t resemble the Dean Cas had sex with half a day ago. His skin seems dull and as pale as the white hospital sheets of the bed.
Cas would love to not have to talk to Dean about seeing some nice therapist but he can’t keep watching him like this.
He packs his duffel bag, puts some of Dean’s shirts and flannels in there, he can’t just forget his scent, he can’t just forget everything, he has to remember everything as long as possible. He can’t just never sees his clothes again. He didn’t want to change anything in the room but he doubts that the closet will be opened just for fun.
Every time he’s with Cas all the memories just disappear, he never thought that anyone could make him feel like this, hell, five years earlier he didn’t even think about being with a man.
“Dean you should eat something.” Jess carefully insists but Dean just shakes his head. “I’m not hungry.” he still smirks but he stopped fooling everyone a while ago, if they ever believed it anyway.
He pulls out the small box where the ring for Dean was in and the tears he held in for days just roll down his cheeks.
But here we go with another chapter, so, enjoy!
Dean slowly gets up, suddenly drained of whatever energy was left and slowly goes to their bedroom to pack the little stuff he brought with him.
Dean starts kissing down Cas’ neck who presses his head into the pillow, moaning. Dean starts undressing Cas’ hoodie and starts to place kisses all over his chest.
PANTING they pull the blanket over their bodies after they put their boxers back on. “Oh my god, Cas.” Dean whispers, out of breath, with a huge smile on his face and Cas chuckles lightly.
“I think I’ll drive back home. Or find an apartment for myself if C- if he doesn’t want me in the house or something.” Dean states at one dinner a week into Cas being gone. Jess and Sam both drop their forks and loo at each other in worry.
The moment they enter the living room they breathe in the smell of bacon and pancakes, Christmas music is running in the background quietly.
“I’m sorry.” Cas suddenly says and Sam looks up. “I’m sorry for leaving, I’m sorry for not calling him on his birthday, I’m sorry for not checking in on him, I’m sorry for ignoring him, I’m sorry for letting him down. I’m sorry for-” he chokes up and a sob builds up in his throat and he can’t hold it back. Can’t hold back this first one and the many that follow after, shaking through his body leaving him breathless.
Dean sighs in relief and grabs some clothes before he heads to the bathroom. Warm water runs down his scarred back and the memories of last nights conversation start to come back which makes him sigh.                                                                            It’s not like it made anything better for him. It actually made him think about it one more time and it’s just too difficult to get rid of the memories again. There is a good reason why Dean usually buries his thoughts deep inside, at least for him.                                                     Not thinking about it means that he doesn’t get reminded of it and not getting reminded means he doesn’t has to deal with it which makes everything seem a lot easier. The Winchester knows that not dealing with his problems is hell of a wrong way but it sometimes makes things a hundred times easier.                                    Cas steps into the motel room and is glad when he realizes that Dean is out of bed and under the shower. He was worried that Dean would go back to not so old habits.                                   He sets the breakfast onto the table and sits down onto the bed waiting for Dean to finish and step out of the bathroom.                        The Winchester finally opens the bathroom door and sits down next to Cas. He’s wearing an old shirt of Cas who didn’t even know he kept it, and blue jeans like usual.                                                “Are you alright Dean?” Cas looks at him and Dean shrugs his shoulders before he says something.                                  “Can we visit Sammy today?” Dean suddenly asks and finally looks at Cas. “Sure. I was planning to visit him and Jess after Christmas Eve but if you want we can head to their place after breakfast.” Cas smiles at Dean who smiles back in relief.
Castiel just looks at it for a second before he has the guts to open it.
He tries not to let his disappointment show, keeps smiling, sits down next to Dean and takes a look into the box. He didn’t touch it the past years because it reminded him of Dean and that hurt too much. There are amounts of records in it and Dean pulls out one by Johnny Cash and stares at it. “I haven’t been listening to him in years.” he says quietly and keeps staring at the record in his hands. Cas gets up and stretches out one hand so Dean can give him a record. The Novak pulls the record out of its shell and puts it onto the record player, waits a second before he presses play and ‘I’ll be home for Christmas’ fills the room.
