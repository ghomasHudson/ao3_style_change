It turned out that the manor had been sold around six months ago, and the existence of said passage was never made known to the newcomers. The old owner knew about the reputation of the people who were about to buy the house -the man used to be a MP during Thatcher’s administration- and he was the one who broke into the room and took the first papers he found, for he knew they were valuable no matter what.
Then, slowly, slowly, slowly, John licked his lip. Sherlock's eyes roamed down his mouth, down his neck, down his whole body. He looked up again, John's eyes said it all.
"Hmmm.... I really don't believe you." John said shaking his head, smiling and sitting in front of him.
Sherlock nodded. There were so many things he wanted to say, because he knew that in the long run this wasn't helping John overcome his trauma and he was also missing a huge chance, but he didn't dare say it, because he knew it simply wouldn't end well. It wouldn't do.
He kept walking. Walking over the scar of something that was broken and had never managed to quite heal itself.
“Back- back at the rooftop. He said that if I didn’t kill myself you would be killed. Then he killed himself so I wouldn’t have a way to stop him. I had no other choice, no other chance. I had to jump. I needed you to know, to keep you safe.”
Sherlock cleared his throat, feeling all of the sudden incredibly tiny. "I...Um... I'm here to talk to you."
"Alright, so we just have to conclude-" Sherlock said taking the sheet of paper from the typewriter and placing another one "-and we're done."
He woke up constantly, panting, unaware of where he was, forgetting everything that was happening around him except for the face of that man.
"My hand is blocking the blood flow. Only I know how to apply enough pressure, if I let go he'll-", he choked, "he'll die", he whispered. "I can't stay away from him, I need to press down on the entrance, I need to make sure the bullet doesn't dig deeper and won't cause worse damage", he kept on talking, unable to stop.
Jim turned to look at Sebastian and then at Irene and grinned. Sherlock could only smell trouble. He turned to look at Greg, who now seemed to agree with the idea somehow. Sherlock nudged him and Greg turned to look at him. "What?"
His hands were once again holding onto the lapels of his jacket, this time pushing towards their bedroom, the bedroom they had shared for the last month. They hadn't been...sexually engaged since Sherlock had been discharged from hospital, mostly because John felt that Sherlock's wound might give them trouble, but now Sherlock felt immune to pain and immortal.
Sherlock stared at him, surprised. After a moment, he blinked and smiled back, he leaned closer and planted kisses all over John's face while he mumbled "I love you, I love you, I love you..."
He opened the door slowly, almost enjoying the creak it made, it sounded just so familiar. A small line of dust drew in the air, guiding directly to his living room, their living room.
He woke up confused. He barely remembered few bits of what he dreamt, but it was mostly a blur, as if it was something there blocking the view. He couldn't hear his voice, but he could hear quite clearly Holmes'.
Sherlock didn’t turn to look at him, he kept his eyes fixed on the painting in front of him. “You look different”, he replied.
Sherlock couldn't help but laugh, and he found that this was the first time in a very, very long time that he laughed a genuine, humorous laugh, so he allowed himself to enjoy the moment, and he kept laughing. John joined him and they both laughed and laughed for a while. For a second it seemed just like the old times.
John wondered without opening his mouth because he was scared he might end up making a fool of himself.
Because he understood, because he’d been there, because he’d lost and he’d suffered and felt acute pain and had been near to death and had wanted to go near to death many other times after that and had almost succeeded at doing it.
Then John's eyes left his and Sherlock felt as if the warmth that he had left in his body had completely vanished as soon as John looked away.
He then looked up to meet John’s eyes, which were completely absorbed in Sherlock’s, as if there was an unspoken spell around him, not allowing him to look away. They looked into each other’s eyes.
John cleared his throat and drank a sip of milk. "Right, sorry. But do take the break. It will clear your mind." The boy sat in a sofa in front of the record player, and closed his eyes, exhaustion getting him.
John silenced him with another kiss, as urgent and as passionate as the last one. Sherlock moaned against John's lips and moved slightly, so their erections were pressed together.
He sighed and leaned against the back of his chair. It was at moments like these that drugs were…necessary to say the least.
And in those moments, it felt so simple to simply leave, with a thousand unsent messages and a thousand unsaid confessions in his mouth, with the scent of John still alive in his mind palace, with an 'I love you' still looking for a way to escape past his lips even though it had been 7 days, 14 hours, 32 minutes and 37 seconds since he last saw John Watson.
"Probably." Sherlock admitted, much to John's delight. "...won't happen again." He said, looking down.
Sherlock didn't want to come down but wanted Mrs. Hudson to shut up. Reluctantly, he stood up and opened the door, ruffling his hair.
John opened his eyes and looked at Sherlock, a dark shadow drawing itself over his pupils. Sherlock moved his finger out immediately and pushed himself towards John, finding his lips midway.
“The first time we met-”, John stopped, his back turned to Sherlock. “the first time we met, we went to grab dinner. It looked like a date. Angelo thought it so.”
It was only logical that he would wish to understand John, a completely different universe on its own.
“Really? Tell that to my hand, that seems unable to grab a pencil without throwing it to the ground immediately”, he had said too much.
John’s eyes were a mystery. Light showed their color, dark hid them. A perfect chiaroscuro right there, in the same place.
"Well, I had to bring Harry safe." And John gave him the biggest grin he had ever seen and he thought he could never get used to see that smile. "Come on, give me a hand, I'll take her out."
So what? What if Sherlock didn’t want to talk to him ever again? He’d survive, it wasn’t as if his whole world moved around Sherlock.
The problem, he thought, was that no matter how hard he tried, whenever John was concerned, he simply couldn't focus. There was no way he couldn't avoid considering John a victim, relating anything and everything he saw and heard about the case to John, he couldn't stop thinking about the danger John had put himself into because of him.
was you, looked very surprised for a second and then he just kept walking. He certainly wasn't expecting that." Irene said, standing right next to him.
John was about to ask what happened today but then he remembered, and immediately his back started hurting. The greaser kept his eyes fixed on him. "You don't have to keep apologizing."
"I'm starting to think he has a good reason not to be here", Sherlock said, implying more than what he wanted to.
The greaser did something particularly incredible with his tongue and John bit his lip to keep himself from saying anything and suddenly he yelled with pain on his split lip.
Sherlock smiled back, grabbed John's hand and led them towards his bedroom. As soon as he opened the door, John started kissing him again and Sherlock gasped. They stood there for a while, content with feeling each other there. John grimaced and had to break away because his leg was throbbing him once again. He looked disappointed of having to limp towards Sherlock's bed.
At some time during the afternoon he opened his eyes again, this time to a door opening, producing exactly the same sound it had made when it had been opened in his dream.
I'm not discussing that with you, goodbye." He said turning but she touched his back, stopping him and pushing him down so they sat in one of the stairs.
It was almost nine when John entered to the classroom. He took one of the first seats and looked at the people he was sharing the class with, they were all the same, and talked about things John didn't understand, apparently all of them were into that Rock n' roll and dear lord what was happening with society? Where was Bach? What about Mozart? Apparently Buddy Holly and Elvis were better. Sure.
John frowned as soon as he heard the knock on the door. A visit to his flat was unusual. He asked himself wether he had invited anyone to come over and had forgotten it, but he couldn't recall if he had.
John sat up. “What about your comeback? Are you ever planning on actually doing something?”, he said harshly.
Of course Sherlock knew what for. He knew he was supposed to be thankful, too. But how was he to be thankful for being locked into a room, forced to eat and drink and talk to psychologists and not being able to take drugs? They had taken the inspiration, the motivation, the
Except he did. He did know how to stop this. Naproxone was commonly known as the antidote for morphine, but John Watson was a stronger kind of antidote. Or a motivator. It all depended on the situation.
"I don't, but now I get terrified every time I'm about to step close to a car. So I prefer not tempting the destiny."
He was about to answer but then he remembered Sherlock and Jim and all of it and he decided it was best not to. "You may not." He said smiling, a
Sherlock sighed as he shook his head. “Nothing. Just-”, he looked up to meet John’s eyes. “I’ve never done this before. With anyone.”
Sherlock felt that painting was him. In the midst between life and death, joy and sorrow, love and pain.
"Fine. Apologize. What for?" John still looked at him very seriously, forcing himself not to look at his lips. But it was
"I'm sorry", he said once again as he buried his face on Sherlock's shoulders. "I never meant for any of this to happen", he said bitterly. "I never wanted to hurt you, Sherlock. Not after seeing the scars."
"Yes", was John's reply. A simple, shaky, out-of-breath yes. And Sherlock nearly lost it. He moaned.
John looked at her with a frown. “Because I have nothing to write about. Nothing ever happens to me, not anymore. Not since he fell.”
John rolled his eyes and sighed as he took a chair and moved it right next to the greaser, who was already putting the paper on the typewriter and was starting to write. As he typed his and John's name, and the school and subject and all that formalities, he turned to look at John and said: "Bring me the chemistry books."
“Except, he didn't. He didn't introduce us. The man knew who I was. Somehow he knew everything about me.”
Sherlock was hoping deep deep inside she would leave, so he felt a bit relieved when she announced it. He replied with a nod.
"John?" He heard his mom calling from the living room. "...are you okay dear?... Don't move!" She said turning off the lights of their house.
Or maybe he was just curious. Maybe he had seen a terrible murder on the news and was interested in knowing if Sherlock was investigating it? Maybe he was just bored, on a lunch break and he wanted to talk to someone?
John turned and found Greg, walking right behind him and trying to fasten his pace to reach him. He felt a sudden fear, given the events of the day before, where Jim and Sebastian had kicked him against the lockers. Still, he stopped, hoping he wouldn't get his ass kicked this time. "Yes?"
Sherlock finished the cigarette incredibly fast and threw it to the grass, stepping on it, while John looked at him on a mix of surprise/ confusion/nervousness. "Fine, let's go, nerd."
"What?" Sherlock said turning to look at Greg as they made their way to the cafeteria. Well, as Greg did. Sherlock was going to keep reading his book.
Finally, after what felt like hours, John said softly, "you're alive". It was as if that statement was a reassurance to himself, not to Sherlock.
Greg entered back to the room and said goodbye to John. He asked Sherlock one last time before he left. "Are you sure?"
Apologies for the delay! This chapter was a tricky one to write! Once again, thank you so much for your support with the fic, you guys are lovely! x
The studies didn’t go that bad. He was starting to realize that he wasn’t particularly bad at drawing, he never had been of course, he was an artist, he simply hadn’t paid much attention to drawing realistically per se, but once he focused completely on doing so, while he filtered the noise of the street, while he emptied his mind of all distractions, while his hand remained steady, and while he pictured Sherlock guiding him through with advices, his drawings would come out looking…realistic enough.
Greg took a step aside, hoping John would show a hint of recognition. John was looking around everywhere. He turned to look at Sherlock at the mention of the name and his eyes widened.
Hundreds of detectives and journalists came and went by the house next door, sometimes Sherlock passed by, looking serious. John thought about how wonderful it should be being there with him, seeing him thinking, in action, so focused. It was a show. It was incredible. He thought about the conversation he had had with his sister and decided it
He hadn’t received any other message from John’s phone, he couldn’t dial to make sure he was fine, it would ruin the element of surprise.
John grabbed the brush from Sherlock’s hands, their fingers meeting each other for the shortest of seconds.
And he would, Sherlock would. The only thought that had kept him sane during these last few days was the idea of seeing John again. Without John, he had to deal with his own mind, with his own worst enemy, and he knew it was a battle he would always, irreparably,
John closed his eyes and sighed. “You’re probably wondering what happened there-”, he broke the silence, slightly startled at how normal and cool his voice sounded when he felt anything but.
John tried to stay as calm as possible. He sat straight too. "Sherlock, I just want to get to know you better!"
have another way out. I read Dr. Watson's blog, and he said you were quite extraordinary, and used to think outside the box, but now, seeing you here, I see nothing but an ordinary man desperate to escape. Think outside the box, Mr. Holmes. Prove us you're not ordinary. Prove Dr. Watson you're not ordinary."
He looked through the window, the greaser was talking to Dimmock, he looked so good. John wanted to go downstairs and talk to him about the crime, just because he knew Sherlock needed someone to talk to, someone to help him. He just kept staring, trying to stop the thoughts running through his mind.
Sherlock stood up in his fine suit and raised his chin, "I assure you, detective inspector..." The sleuth said throwing one last look at John, hoping he would sound more rational and logical to the doctor. Perhaps,
Sherlock took them off him and stared at John, looking very serious. "You heard me. Stop pretending you didn't."
Sherlock stood there, fixed to the spot, going through all the things John had just said, John had just
"Last time we talked was a week after your funeral. I arrived to the flat and saw he was packing stuff and I frowned, but he said he just couldn't..." Greg hesitated for a moment, as if unsure he should be telling Sherlock any of these things. "bear it anymore, staying in there. 'Too many memories' was what he said, and I understood it back then, he seriously didn't want anything else to do with that life anymore. So I wished him well and I left, knowing it would be the last I'd see of him. Haven't seen him once ever since."
Sherlock opened the door of his room and both went out of it. John stood up immediately, to check if he was okay. At least he was dressed. And so was she, which was even more surprising, given the way they had first met. Irene looked at John and smiled wider.
“Now color the iris. Remember, it is darker around the edges, there are tiny little universes drawing themselves in the iris, use it. Trace the shapes of your iris softly, just slightly darker than the fill, it will bring the eye to life.”
"How old are you? Are you even allowed to drive?" Sherlock said without taking his eyes off him, which made John feel a little uncomfortable.
"...John Watson." Irene repeated after a silent moment, which seemed to last an eternity for Sherlock, who was now wondering if he had made a terrible mistake and why on earth did he do that?
Mycroft looked around and walked away from Sherlock. "I shall inform your...friends about your awakening."
Harry's eyes were filling with tears, which was saying a lot because she barely, not to say almost never cried.
He felt incredibly tired, two days of not sleeping and overthinking finally taking over him. John's breathing evened out eventually. Just as he felt sleep dragging him in, he felt John's hot air through the fabric of his shirt. A second later, his voice filled the room.
He almost tossed it to the trash, but as soon as he picked it up, he realized the folder was a bit heavier than he expected.
"Because it wasn't important John!", Sherlock didn't look surprised, but did look annoyed, as if he was expecting more from John, more understanding, a bit of help, an advise, something, anything but a fight.
Sherlock felt drugged by it. Listening to John's voice, calling his name with such urgency and desperation was everything Sherlock could have ever imagined.
He choked a gasp as John's voice filled the flat. He expected to hear anything but John's voice, or perhaps he hoped he would hear him, what he didn't expect was to hear John so...miserable.
And that's when he woke up. He opened his eyes, breathing heavily, choking back a sob, but he couldn't calm himself, he simply couldn't. He closed his eyes again as he started weeping, taking deep breaths while memories invaded his mind once again.
Sherlock turned his head to face Sebastian and then, in a fast move, grabbed the boy by the collar of his leather jacket and pushed him against the locker with incredible strength. The Greaser's face was red with anger, and he was looking at the other boy with a killing gaze. "Shut. Up. Sebastian!" He shouted, clenching his teeth. "Next time you say something like that you'll regret it!" He said as he showed him his fists.
That was why Sherlock had agreed to teach John. One of Sherlock’s biggest flaws was his endless need for a
"Hey!" Sherlock said, padding John's hair. "It's okay. You have nothing to apologize for. I'm fine, I'm here. I'm with you."
He heard the sound of the bell ringing but ignored it, heard Mrs. H’s voice and heard footsteps approaching, but he ignored them.
John kept walking telling himself not to look at the couple. No. Absolutely not. Maybe a little. Just a small movement of his head, just turning a bit, a tiny bit... Yes. It was Sherlock. He was talking to Irene and they were incredibly close, like he used to with John, she was holding his hand and laughing and
John heard Sarah's word distantly, as if she was far far away from him. He opened his eyes and narrowed them, trying to find the meaning of those distant words he heard. Finally, he said: "What? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Just- a bloody headache."
John stared at him for a moment, his expression unreadable. Then he took Sherlock's arm, raised it to his lips and started to place feather-light kisses on the bruised skin.
"Sarah?" He said in a rush, turning to look towards the receptionist. "Mind taking the people for a second? I'll be right back." He said without waiting for Sarah's approval.
"Oh, and you're meeting, or something?" Jim said, holding onto his cigarette. And trying to look nonchalant.
It had been three years without hearing a single word from her. He never needed to wonder what had happened to her. He knew, he was certain she had died, that was what Mycroft had told him wasn't it? Of course she had died. He never dared to mention her to Sherlock ever again, he knew it was painful to him, he had seen his expression when he asked for her phone, he knew Sherlock wasn't okay with it, and it terrified him, it terrified him to think it was for someone who had played such a dirty game. But she was dead now, so much time without naming her, everything was as if nothing ever happened. Until that day.
“There you have your evidence: you only hear half of the story and that’s what you tell the rest of the world.”
Mycroft recovered the calm, and went to the door. "I shall go, brother of mine, I hope you understand what I told you. Goodbye John." John nodded and Mycroft left.
The night before had been different, there was a raw need for relief, but now, here, there was something deeper than that, something that dared not speak its name, and he could see it in John's eyes, and he could feel it himself.
"Please don't tell her where I live, if she broke into a crime scene, she is brave enough to break into any place." Sherlock said trying to light the mood.
Melissa was sitting next to the chair, on the floor, her legs crossed and a smile plastered on her face.
"That you would annoy me and put pressure on me and be behind my back forcing me to do the damn work for these two weeks which will end up being hell!" John felt anger rising. That kind of anger he only had when Sherlock opened his mouth.
Sherlock released a breath he didn’t know he had been holding. Now that he had made sure that John was okay and in relative safety at the hospital, he’d be able to focus on solving this case, because it was proving itself to be almost impossible. Was it because it involved John? That was stupid, John wasn’t even directly involved, but he could become a potential target and that was enough to set Sherlock’s nerves.
“We talked. You- you asked me if I had a girlfriend. I said no. You asked me if I had a boyfriend. I said no.”
Sherlock sat on the edge of the bed, staring at John. John felt a moment of panic, but looked at him in the eyes and Sherlock smiled, vanishing all of John's worries instantly. "Mm... I guess I'll have to." He said playfully.
It was 7:30 p.m. and John's attention was focused on wether Sherlock would attend or not to the date. He was working so hard, taking samples from the body, analyzing each one of them, determined to find its precedence, making his way into Moriarty's trap. He wasn't still sure if it was a good idea or not, but at least Sherlock had that determination John had missed so much, it had been over two years without seeing it, now it was as if nothing had changed.
"Then I will not continue to make such mistake. Are you coming or not?" Sherlock said turning his back to John and getting inside the house.
Greg smirked. "Well, I think you should know Sherlock wasn't okay with that. He didn't like what they did. He was angry at them."
John frowned. Even though Mike's expression was serious now, he could see a small smile hiding in the corners of his lips, he supposed his situation was funny. "But how?"
Sherlock's back tensed and his fists clenched and unclenched almost imperceptibly. Greg recognised that movement, he had seen it on John Watson sometimes.
"No, Donovan, that's not my-" Lestrade stopped abruptly as soon as he opened the door. Sherlock turned as he heard the DI's voice. He hadn't changed much, he was talking through his phone, had huge bags under his eyes and looked a bit skinnier than he would want to. Lestrade stood frozen, his hand on the doorknob, his eyes widened and not daring himself to blink.
A thousand words without noise went through their eyes. There was an element of eternity behind them. Sherlock nodded, John placed the condom in his cock and slowly went in.
wrong. After they kissed, Sherlock turned to look at John, who didn't dare to look at him back and instead was looking at the lockers. His expression was unreadable, but Sherlock knew he was hurt. And he was
Did it mean that John was interested in joining him once again? On working together on their cases? On being just the two of them against the rest of the world once again? It didn’t make sense, they hadn’t talked to each other in three days, ever since John wrote to him about his message, and now here he was, asking Sherlock if he had any new case? It was impossible.
They got into Irene's car. "I can't drive." Sherlock said seriously. Well, technically, he could drive after the accident but doing it so reminded him of John. So it was better avoiding any memory and why the hell did everything remind him of John? This was stupid, utterly stupid.
things, but policeman is not one of them. I work with them occasionally, but that doesn't mean I work
John nodded carefully, scared of what the greaser might say. "Oh, okay. So can we ...go to your house, someday within this week and do that?" He was nervous, he might have ended up beaten up for this, but the greaser didn't react violently, he just looked at John.
Sherlock threw his cigarette to the floor because he felt sick. He looked at his three "friends", stepped on the cigarette and turned to walk away, when Greg's shout stopped him. "Wait, where are you going?"
And he knew what would happen later, but he didn't want to think about it. He had been in that same place seven times before, he had already enough experience to know what was coming next.
“Which question?”, Sherlock said, even though he already knew which it was and he didn’t want to answer it.
He thought about waking John and asking him to come with him, but he was sleeping so deeply, plus he would have a huge hangover so he wouldn't be helpful at all. An hour later, he was on his way to the hospital.
Sherlock dragged a deep breath and his eyes squeezed shut at the odd sensation. He felt a soft tug in his curls and opened his eyes to find John looking at him fixedly. "Okay?", he asked.
"John. I mean it. I need to talk to you. Please, listen." Sherlock said with that deep, captivating voice.
of cameras. Sherlock looked around as the cameras turned to focus on him, the flashes were everywhere and people were shoving microphones at him. Where the hell was John? He couldn’t see him through the gigantic crowd of reporters and cameras and lights and he started feeling anxious.
to take him towards the ‘painting seat’ as he’d used to call it. In front of him stood the eye from the night before. Sherlock let go of John’s hand, took the painting off and grabbed another white canvas. John stared at him silently. Then he grabbed a brush and showed it to John, as if he was a four-year-old and was painting for the first time in his life.
(AU in which John and Sherlock are artists!) and if you're up to some fluffiness involving colors and painting, I hope you take a look at it, because it will be lovely! :3
"I know you're uncomfortable Johnny boy. Maybe I'll bring you here someday later, when you enjoy more of Rock n' Roll."
"There was no pulse. Nothing. You were dead. Your face was-", he closed his eyes. He cleared his throat, "please tell me it was just a dream."
"You should consider being a doctor, John. You were able to identify the seven gunshots faster than the rest of the medical team in here." Sherlock said seriously and lowly.
And John wondered how it was possible that a couple of musical notes were capable of anchoring him to the present, of dragging him back from the dark and giving him his life back.
“…John”, he whispered, somehow feeling unable to say anything else, unable to make his brain compose any other word.
He hadn’t gotten this kind of attention since before the fall. By that time, John and him had become something like celebrities and so Sherlock had gotten used to see cameras following them everywhere and registering their every movement. After he came back there wasn’t a huge fuss about it, probably because John’s blog didn’t exist anymore and people slowly lost interest.
“He knew I'd served in Afghanistan and he knew I'd been invalided.” Right at the mention of Afghanistan, John contorted in pain and started screaming once again.
Isabella’s contact info was there. It stated where she worked (by then, at the National Theatre), where she lived (outside of London, in a little town nearby), what her associations were (contact sister in case of emergency) and who she had decided to erase (former husband, had been together for seven years, had split up two weeks before she went there, he cheated on her). There was nothing odd about it, then why killing her in a hotel?
Of course not, if this was Mycroft's idea then he would do anything to make sure that the plan works.
"Really? Who does?" John said trying to look nonchalant but it did not work, so he kept his eyes fixed on the road.
He was absorbed in thoughts when he realized Sherlock had closed the book and was smiling at him. Funny thing is, Sherlock
Sherlock’s legs finally gave in and he dropped to the floor, breathing heavily. “What do you want from me?”, he whispered.
Victor seemed to come back to himself, he straightened his leather jacket and brushed a comb through his hair, taking a cigarette from his pocket and lighting it. “Who do you think you are to come in here givin’me orders?”
"Well, at least have the pie Mrs Hudson baked for you." John said, taking a bite of the pie. "...it's delicious."
Finally, the detective looked up, his face expressionless and his voice sharp. "That'd be all, detective inspector."
Hikes stood up and so did John, who shook his hand and said "Goodbye, sir. Thank you, and again, I apologize."
“I mean, the colors are appropriate. The blue is just about right and there isn’t a huge spur of colors, as is your MO.”
John realized that it was the first time in lots of days he was talking to Sherlock again. He had to seize this opportunity. Plus he was calling him John. Now they could have a proper talk. He closed his eyes, still not sure of what he was going to say. "Why didn't you tell me...you liked her?" His voice came almost like a whisper, while he shook his head.
Two hours was just perfect for Sherlock. He’d have lunch with John, make sure he was safe at Baker Street and look for an excuse to leave for the Yard without John knowing he was working on the case. He had two hours to think it through.
Sherlock could swear something was wrong with John. He wasn't acting normally, which made sense since things were horrible between them, but there was something...different in John. Sherlock was already in the classroom when John entered, and he forced himself to ignore him as much as he could but it was so
Even if it meant he’d have to walk into that hateful gallery once again -he didn’t care that John’s painting was there, he would never be able to like the Tate Modern-, he would do it, because it was preferable to the other option.
It took him too long to realise that he had an oxygen mask on. It took him too long to realise that that was what was helping him to breathe properly.
Sherlock was already hard, but inexplicably so, as John kissed the scars he got much harder, and he needed John with him, looking at him and inside him. He turned around and looked at John, cupping his face with his hands before leaning in for another lust-filled kiss.
Well, that and her alcoholism. She always ended up promising she would quit drinking, but she never did. John grew tired of waiting for her to do it, Clara had grown tired too, but they stood by her side, hoping someday she would fulfil the prospect.
"In that moment it wouldn't have been useful John, you just would have slowed things down. I needed you to think I was dead and you know it. I was protecting you!"
Maybe Sherlock was right, maybe he knew far too much about him. But no, he didn't. What was Sherlock even doing with the police last night? Why did he keep pretending? What about his friends? John still didn't know him at all. "Maybe you're right."
"Harry was the one who caused the accident! God I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. You were the one in the ambulance. God Sherlock, she almost killed you."
"I don't know, I don't remember! I'm trying but I can't remember a thing! Everything is a blur. Harry, I need to know what I told him, I
Supernovas and stars and whole galaxies, God, Sherlock was capable of creating solar systems and black holes at this very moment.
She shut her mouth and looked down, embarrassed. Sherlock felt bad for her. Actually, he felt worse for feeling bad for her. "...yes, I like chemistry."
But Sherlock was already running downstairs when John's father stopped him. "Good night." He said sharply.
"Three months old apparently by the way the skin has recovered around the wounded area, probably the cause of the repetitive headaches, the doctors should have known, why didn't they say anything? Why didn't they ask about the scar?"
Sherlock was about to open his mouth and answer, but John lifted a hand, as ordering the greaser to shut up. He did, so John took a step forward and looked seriously at his mom. "Mom, I want to be a doctor. This is my training!"
Then the thought of what Sherlock had implied hit John. He was surprised. He had done it. He had save her life. "No..."
He looked around, looking for an excuse. John had written on the note that they’d work on the case later,
“You have no reason to be”, Sherlock whispered. “You didn’t know. I kept you in the dark, like I always did.”
"Good, I mean, okay, I missed school a lot. What about you? God! Your car! It looks fantastic!" He shouted happily turning his eyes to the red and white machine John was gladly showing.
He felt the sweet touch of John’s fingertips over his cheeks. He realized a second later that John was wiping the tears away. His tears. His own tears. When had he cried? He had cried enough in front of John, he had to stop doing that.
He turned on the shower and closed his eyes, he felt... Weird. He didn't usually drink enough to not remember what he had done, what had happened.
It had been one month since he'd been discharged. Living together had proved to be just like the old times, except this time they shared a bed and Sherlock wasn't endlessly terrified of boundaries and miscommunication. Actually, it had been like falling back into routine, it took Sherlock a long time to feel his wound healing and John had taken care of him properly, making sure the wound was, in fact, healing. They kissed, not as much as Sherlock would like to, they bickered, there were body parts in the fridge again, Sherlock felt bored sometimes, John returned to work at the ER, and their lives fell back into place, or as much as it was possible.
Lestrade shook his head, "listen, I've heard that name before. Somewhere. What if she's involved in all of this? We can both agree on the fact that someone who works there surely must have something to do with the murders, what if her name might lead us to a clue?"
"Then what do you want from me?" John said looking directly into Sherlock's eyes, moving his hands through the air.
He smiled against the violin and promised himself that he would do anything he could to save John Watson, just as John Watson had saved him.
"Don't worry, John. You didn't do anything wrong. You couldn't avoid it from happening. It's not your fault."
"Perhaps..." Greg tried really hard to find the right words. "I- I remember a while ago, we had a case of PTSD in which Molly assisted us. You had been long gone and John wasn't helping us anymore. She- she said that, even though it wasn't very common, there could be some cases of PTSD in which the mind blocked a memory completely, in order to avoid any further shock or a relapse. Some kind of post-traumatic amnesia." He held the hope this would soothe Sherlock a bit.
and then he fell off the rooftop... in front of my eyes. And I couldn't do anything, I couldn't save him, I couldn't tell him I believed in him. I saw him bleeding, I reached to feel his pulse and I couldn't find it, I couldn't and then he was gone and I was talking to his grave and I never really got to say goodbye.
“It’s fine, I’m here. I’m here with you, John. You’re in London, not in Afghanistan. London. Baker Street. Here. With me”, a thumb caressed the back of his hand.
And a pinch of hope got to John's chest but he shook it away quickly. He didn't want to see Sherlock. He didn't. And he only went to that freaking detention because he
At the mention of the name, Clara flinched a little, but Irene didn't seem to notice. Sherlock tried to maintain his face still, but he couldn't deny the mention of the Watson name brought him many memories.
Sherlock gulped and stared at him, taken by surprise. He swallowed and finally replied, “Th-Thank you.”
Sherlock cleared his throat and stood up from the chair he didn't realise he had sit on. "I'll see you at The Yard in twenty minutes", was all he said and he hung up.
The same back that had held a rigid and military posture as it stood in front of a cold, empty grave was now hosting the need of Sherlock’s arms. Sherlock held John with all his will. Or John held him. He couldn’t tell.
"Sherlock Holmes jumped off a rooftop", it was all John replied as he opened his eyes and stared at Sherlock. He swallowed hard.
So when he came back from the crime scene, as he sat in the cab that would take him to Baker Street, as he looked at the notification from his phone, he felt all the air leave his lungs.
“I think of the body as some kind of musical composition”, Sherlock said, standing in front of the paper, “-that is to say, as the union of a hundred different factors that align themselves together in order to create a whole”, he made a long trace across the paper, “-when you think about it, they’re not that different”, another trace, “there’s the idea of creating something that takes shape”, another long trace right in the middle, followed by his fingertips, in order to fade the trace of the charcoal and creating a shadow, he was creating a torso. “But for it to take shape, you need exactly the right pitch”, he started creating shadows around the torso, “high and low, high and low, high and low”, he repeated as he slowly filled the paper with more traces he then faded with his fingertips, “high, like then the sun is shining at just the right place and illuminates one of the corners of your body”, he said as he pointed to the upper right side of the torso, which was still clear from traces and shadows, as if it was filled by light, “low, like when the sun is setting and that light slowly leaves your body and creates a shadow of yourself”, he said, focusing on darkening the whole left side.
"John and I came across her first, but I was only able to injure her before she escaped. I have a theory. She could be working with a vampire. The pendant, it had blood in it." Sherlock explained.
"Sherlock!" The sergeant shouted. "Bloody wanker! I swear if you interfere with this investigation, it'll be the last crime scene that you'll ever see. Mycroft sighed loudly as he glared at the two men quickly approaching them.
Mycroft pulled out his mobile from his pocket and placed a call. Unlike Sherlock, he despised texting. Anthea would not be left behind this time. After Mycroft had gone undercover to extract Sherlock from the Serbian prison without informing her, she had warned him that if he ever tried a stunt like that again, it would be his last. Mycroft was not inclined to test her. She had become indispensable personally and professionally and Mycroft had no desire to chance losing her. When she answered the phone he simply stated  "Prepare for retrieval."
"Well, if it isn't the great detective Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. I've been hearing about both of you." John cleared his throat loudly and looked at his feet. Sherlock, however, liked a challenge and stared her down. She was beautiful and completely nude. Dark hair perfectly coifed and make up highlighting her best features. If she expected a meal out of either of them, then she would be very disappointed.
"What's he doing there? That place is more secure than the crown jewels. There is no way that anything supernatural could slip in or out without the facility allowing it; besides you, darling." Anthea said with a wink. Mycroft rolled his eyes at her teasing before answering.
It is the only memory of his  father that did not come from his family room dedicated to Sherlock’s parents; Mycroft has one of his own across the hall. He does not know where it came from, only that it appeared with the Shadow Room. The pictures blur and sometimes refuse to stay still. Strange objects cast shadows everywhere, rippling in his hands and breathing out smells of pipe tobacco and something astringent he’s never managed to identify. Deleted, it regenerates. Relocated, it returns to the only room he has ever seen without the spider-webbing of emotional data cluttering the corners. Any threads that follow him in vanish upon departure. Nothing else will stick there.
"I'm Molly Hooper, you can count me in." Molly said after a moment of consideration. Sherlock smiled looking victorious.
"He's filthy, and much too thin. Where is he living?" John questioned causing Sherlock to frown before replying
"What is your story, Watson? I've read your file. Army doctor, there has to be more to it than that. You could have run those drills with your eyes closed and that was some of the best marksmanship I have ever seen. Those are not the skills of an RAMC physician. But even more than your skills, your eyes give you away; windows to the soul. What have yours seen?" Sholto fired the questions at him as his eyes bore into him looking through him with a cold calculation similar to Sherlock. Sherlock, God. Would he never escape his tortured memories of what if's when it came to the mad genius that was Sherlock Holmes? Something akin to pain must have flickered across his face before he could mask it because Sholto pounced sensing an opening. "Man on the edge, you've lost someone. Someone close. I know about loss and regret and what it can do to a man." His voice changed with the last statement it moved from demanding and interrogating to soft and sympathetic. John risked breaking protocol and met Sholto's gaze and saw the internal pain that he had been feeling mirrored back at him.
“I’m not afraid. I’m certain.” Mycroft insisted. There was a click and a dial tone before Greg could formulate a response. Bollocks, what had he done. He had to warn Molly.
"You've already admitted that you love him, don't try to deny it now. For all of your deductions, did you really fail to see it? Don't tell me the great Sherlock Holmes hasn't figured it out. Show me what you're made of. After all, brainy is the new sexy." Irene had been aiming for levity, but it clearly fell flat. Sherlock frowned looking quite put off by her prodding, but remained stubbornly silent. Irene huffed in frustration and before thinking better of it blurted out. "He loved you, you prat! Despite him proclaiming that you were not a couple, he loved you and if he is still alive, I would bet that he still does! As the old saying goes there are none so blind as those who will not see." Sherlock looked at her in shock disbelief written all over his face.
Sherlock pulled the vial from his pocket and drank quickly. The bitter taste exploded in his mouth, but the healing effect was instantaneous. The panacea was a product of years of trial and error. Though few knew it, Sherlock was quite an accomplished alchemist. The flesh wound began to mend and the dizziness and disorientation lessened. John, oh God. Sherlock ran to his still form. His body lay supine on the cool tile beside the pool. His lips were stained with blood and puncture wounds from the vampire's fangs had already healed leaving two small scars. Sherlock felt for a pulse and the slow irregular heartbeat incompatible with life was present. Turning, John was turning and by sunset tomorrow he would be a fully turned vampire.
What would become of them if god forbid...Their father and paternal grandparents were dead and Mum’s parents had disowned her. They had no other relatives. John shuddered at the possibility of becoming a ward of the state. They would be separated if they went into foster care. John looked down at their mother’s battered face and murmured another prayer.
Sherlock merely stared at her unimpressed. "Look's like he was right. You are an ice man." She whispered. "I think you're damaged, delusional, and believe in a higher power, in your case, it's yourself." Irene replied.
Molly took the hair and made a show of examining it. She knew better than to tell Sally the truth. Molly didn't fancy being admitted to the psych ward. "No, I've never seen it either, but I can keep it and run some more tests and get back to you." She offered. Sally had nodded and thanked her before leaving Molly alone with her thoughts. She should stay out of it. It wasn't her business, it didn't involve the dead and there was always the chance of being caught whether it was by the Kelpie or humans and neither was a good option. But in the end, Molly thought of those children and the children that would no doubt be killed in the future unless someone put a stop to that creature. She had to do something.
Mycroft had been surprised when he had dug through John's military records extensively. Though he had a basic picture from his file that he had pulled on Dr. Watson when he first became associated with his brother, it had just scratched the surface. John Watson was much more than just an army doctor wounded in Afghanistan. He had begun his medical training at John King's College London with additional training at St. Bart's. After earning his medical degree and receiving his license to practice medicine, he then began practicing as a civilian physician. He worked in private practice for a little over a year, before he then had joined the Royal Army Medical Corps. After working as an army doctor in the RAMC for a number of years, he completed officer's training at Sandhurst.
"What exactly do you do?" John asked as his eyes took in every tool of the trade scattered all over the flat.
Sherlock had asked for the reports, but Anthea had given them to her with strict instructions not to pass them on to Sherlock. They held state secrets and were not to be reproduced or shared in anyway either digitally or by hard copy. Molly had made a decision then that she would not break the rules, but go around them. She would not reproduce those reports or give them to Sherlock. She would also not discuss their content in writing or over then phone. She would meet Sherlock in person and tell him what she knew, but she needed to do some research first. The blond woman was mentioned multiple times in the reports; she was the only constant amongst a sea of variables. Greg's voice pulled her out of her thoughts and back to the present.
"Tell me," Irene whispered into the man's ear licking the outer lobe as she caressed the man's body causing him to shudder with arousal. After a month of searching, she had finally found her mark. This man would lead them to the camp where John Watson had been taken prisoner. Sherlock and Irene had so far been able to only get bits and pieces of intel despite Sherlock's deductions and Irene using her sexual prowess to extort information. They were able to confirm that John Watson was indeed alive and being held prisoner, what they had yet to discover is where. But hopefully, after tonight, they would have their answer.
"How many?" John asked as he tried to take it all in. He rubbed his eyes and shook his head obviously trying to shake off the lingering effects of the sedatives.
They ended up in an abandoned warehouse where a lone figure stood looking regal in a tailored suit leaning against an umbrella. As John came closer, he could sense the man's wards, powerful wards, much more powerful than any of Sherlock's. Mage. He wore a ring, which was identical to the witches on his right hand. He had been the one to gift it to her, the signatures matched perfectly.
"I'm more worried about bullets or explosives." James replied with a sigh of his own releasing a plume of smoke as he answered. "You've earned it, John. That much is for damn sure. Anyone would back that up." James said changing the topic back easily. John and his commanding officer had, over the last few months, developed not only a mutual respect for one another, but a deep friendship as well, which often proved to be a bit of a delicate balancing act at times. James was always professional, but their relationship was a complicated one and it was a potential minefield of conflicts. James was the only one who knew the whole story. Everything, including Sherlock and his fall. Not even Murray had known that John had watched, horrified as his best friend, his unrequited love, had fallen to his death resulting in John re-enlisting without caring whether he lived or died. John sometimes got the sense that if things were different between them that James would have asked for more, but John's heart was still broken and, what's more, intimate relationships within the ranks were strictly forbidden. Not to say that it was unheard of for such things to go on behind closed doors.
"Aye, I've been doing that too much lately, it seems. It's easy to get lost in your own head sometimes." Greg admitted in a kind voice. "I just can't let it go. I'm missing something. I know I am." Molly mirrored his sigh and sad smile.
"So you're the woman responsible for the priests, I presume?" Sherlock inquired tightening his grip on the gris-gris ward concealed in his pocket.
"He's not a good enough actor and his deductive skills are nowhere near mine. What's more, he was quite annoyed that I beat him to Bart's and those dead priests. When I suggested that he lay low and let me handle it, he was less than pleased." Sherlock replied causing John to roll his eyes.
The beautiful man spoke much to her surprise, but rather than answer, he voiced a question. "Why were you looking for the Kelpie? Has it wronged you in some way? What interest do you have in those dead children?"
"He won't, it will be destroyed once I memorize the data." Sherlock assured her. Molly nodded and pulled the report from her rucksack and handed it to Sherlock.
"Lestrade is already working with us. He called us in on this one." Sherlock told the boy, as he set a teacup down which the boy finished in record time.
"You could have. She already touched you and then slapped you and you resisted." Sherlock answered catching John by surprise with the information. John looked at the priest and raised an eyebrow. Anyone able to resist that was powerful indeed. Greg sighed and then replied.
Omegas, on the other hand, had a much more delicate hormone balance and could only tolerate suppressants for short periods without risking permanent damage. While Omegas possessed superior senses, they were docile and submissive by nature. They had much better control over their instincts outside of heat even without a bond. Alphas, on the other hand, had the same superior senses as Omegas but also possessed increased strength and muscle mass which Omegas lacked. They were also much more unpredictable. Even outside of ruts and on suppressants, Alphas were aggressive, territorial and prone to rages if unbonded.
“He’s recovered enough. He told me so. Gregory Lestrade is honest to a fault.” Sherlock argued and John only huffed in reply because it was true.
“Why Uncle Rudy? Wouldn’t Mummy have been a better choice?” Mycroft’s eyes snapped open and Sherlock stepped back as he saw the anger mixed with guilt and frustration lurking in his expression.
Impossible, John was given a medical discharge. He was shot and injured with a diagnosis of PTSD, as well as a limp and intermittent hand tremor in his dominant hand. Sherlock felt his rage at Mycroft build as he deduced that the only way in which reenlistment would be possible was if Mycroft had used his considerable influence to either alter John's records or make them disappear completely. He gripped the phone tightly as the thought of John being injured or worse killed in action ran through his mind. His chest tightened making it hard to breathe. He had agreed to this mission to protect John and now his sacrifice may be for not. Sherlock looked up and cursed viciously under his breath as he realized that he had lost sight of the subject. The mark had disappeared and as a result Sherlock had just lost two days worth of work. Bloody Mycroft!
"Was John among the dead?" Mycroft asked clinging to the hope that they may have a prayer of getting to him before it was too late.
"Take a wild guess!" she dared. Her words were slurred and she was unsteady. Greg frowned looking her over. He didn't recognize this woman. Her shoulder length sandy blonde hair was flying everywhere. Her blue eyes burned with fury and her face was flushed red with anger and likely alcohol, he could smell it on her.
“You should have warned me! Not just you, but Mummy and Father as well.” Mycroft insisted as his Uncle looked at him with an expression which was difficult to categorize.
"Bollocks, not much good 'e'll do you, Mr. 'omles wot wiv 'im being normal and all." The boy replied as he finished the last biscuit, putting emphasis on the word normal obviously using the word as a substitute for human. "Why don't cha' ask Fadda?"
The verse echoed through Sherlock's mind. "Very well, said the merchant, I give in. I am yours. But tell me, why did you look surprised this morning when you saw me in Baghdad? Because, said death, I had an appointment with you tonight, in Samara." Sherlock murmured.
"This is Father Gregory Lestrade. He's the one who called me with the case. Lestrade, this is my new assistant, Dr. John Watson." Sherlock introduced. Greg shot Sherlock a disbelieving look before objecting.
"Over a hundred prisoners in this camp alone, with more than double that number of captors." Murray clarified in a soft murmur. "John…Something's going on here, something sinister. This is more than first meets the eye." Murray continued leaving John looking confused.
Mycroft swallowed the pills quickly and trembled. God help him. He never wanted to go through a rut again. He assumed presentation would be unpleasant, but he had never in his wildest dreams imagined that it would be that bad. Mycroft shuddered. No one had told him. He couldn’t remember much, only bits and pieces; the pain, the lust, the complete loss of control and the rage at being denied. He had been more animal than human. Feral. His memories were fractured and Mycroft wondered if perhaps that had been a blessing. He looked at his Uncle who sat opposite him as he sipped whiskey from a crystal glass.
"Sherlock?" John asked with a quick glance at his watch. Traffic had been bad. It had taken 45 minutes for him to get here. Even so, it seemed a short amount of time for police questioning to have taken place.
"You head to New Scotland Yard. I'll call Mycroft. I'll stick out at the Met like a sore thumb. You can slip in unnoticed." Greg insisted causing John to raise an eyebrow. "Don't text him. If they are questioning him, it's likely that they consider in a suspect. The phone will be used as evidence."
Anthea looked at him cautiously seeming to consider his warning before pulling out her mobile and calling a car. Greg sighed in relief. As the black sedan pulled up to the church, Anthea looked back at him and stated. "You haven't heard that last of this."
"Aye, that was the one part of training that he had some trouble with. They are not an aggressive breed by nature, but he'll do it." Jones replied as the dog's tailed wagged furiously with the attention.
"Ah, but I know you, I might not have known your name at the time, but you and I have a history. You are quite familiar to me." He snarled, his mood changing quickly from falsely cordial to deadly as he paced around John. "You've been a bad boy Johnny, messing up our plans, plans that we worked on for years. We worked so hard to bring down Sherlock Holmes and what happened. You. Always saving the day at the last moment, first with the cabbie and then at the pool. I should have shot you then when I had the chance. Now James Moriarty is dead." Moran growled as he shoved a picture into John's face. James Moriarty's lifeless eyes stare back at him and the distinctive blood splatter pattern around him makes it evident that to John that he had eaten a bullet. John stared at Moran in confusion and taking in his expression, Moran began to laugh maniacally.
"Why? Why did you do it Mycroft? I grieved for him; John grieved for him! I know you'll try to justify it, the cloak and dagger rubbish. I can almost forgive you for that. John would have never stayed put knowing Sherlock was alive and working alone. He would have followed him to the ends of the earth, so I get that part. As much as I loathe it, I understand. What I truly don't understand is why you would allow John to reenlist?"
Finish it. He thought as he plowed on. He slit his thumb deeply on the sharp edge of the crucifix of his silver rosary that pulsed brightly as it was infused with Greg's light. As his blood welled up, Greg allowed the heavy droplets to fall into the holy water font staining the holy water red. It shimmered softly casting a soft glow now also infused with his light. The wind howled as the rain beat against the stained glass windows. Out of the corner of his eye, Greg caught a flash of movement on the buttresses. The Gargoyles were awakening. They sensed the darkness stirring. Greg nearly stopped. This was a tightrope walk. The light and dark were doing battle within John and Greg was unsure which would emerge triumphant.
"No you won't, my thrall, Moran, is a sharpshooter and he has his sights set on you. A silver bullet will only slow me down, not kill me. You, on the other hand, well, humans are so fragile. I could kill you, but I want you to suffer. I'll burn you. I'll burn the heart out of you." Moriarty threatened.
"Faith can build with time, my son. You have just seen evil tonight, but know that there is a balance to everything. Goodness and evil are everywhere even within you. Lux in Tenebris. Light in darkness. Greg bit his lip and let Father's words sink in. He had nowhere to go and no family left. What did he have to lose? If it didn't work out, he could always quit.
"Aye, that's as far as I got, then I hit a dead end. I'll tell you one thing though it had to be powerful, the gargoyles are gone." Greg explained. Sherlock nodded as he glanced at the empty buttresses.
"Deduction, Sergeant. One can pick up all kinds of things if one simply observes closely. You, for example, good at your job, workaholic, married with one child and another on the way."
"Come in," Mycroft called as Anthea pulled back distancing herself from him. Sherlock and John Watson were ushered in looking very annoyed. The door snapped shut and Mycroft met their faces with a glare of his own. They were not nearly as annoyed as Mycroft. "What were you doing this time Sherlock?"
It was Mycroft who had found the body in the well. The bloody song, there was a cipher embedded into it. It was the graves that led him to the well. In hindsight, he shouldn't have confronted her. When he threatened to tell their parents and Sherlock about what she had done, she had turned on him. She attacked burning him on over 40 percent of his body nearly killing him, but not before he cast the spell that killed her. It had been self-defense, kill or be killed, but that knowledge did nothing to alleviate his guilt. Mycroft would be forever haunted by that day. The scars over his torso served as a grim reminder.
"Close your eyes, John." Greg whispered and John complied. Greg placed his hand over John's closed eyelids and closing his own eyes before he whispered "Et cum spiritu tuo."
"How long Bill? How long have you been here?" John asked in a voice hoarse from disuse, squinting and studying him closely no doubt noticing that he too seemed different. It wasn't just the haunted look in Murray's eyes from the captivity, but it was physical as well. He was smaller, weaker and looked even younger. Bill held no illusions of what he had become, a failed experiment, collateral damage.
"Bill, calm down. You're not making sense. What the hell is going on here?" John asked looking more unsettled by the minute despite his weakened state adrenaline was spiking causing a fight or flight response.
"Yes, Father. I'm well aware. However, does it matter at this point? Is there anything within me worth saving?" Greg swallowed and debated his answer. To gaze into someone's soul was the most invasive thing that one could do to a person. It was also dangerous. Depending on the subject and what lay hidden within them, it could be beautiful or ugly, light or dark or something in between. It could leave the gazer blind and literally drive them insane. Greg could still recall the fate of median who had tried it in desperation when her daughter was killed by a demon. The woman had been left blinded and stark raving mad. Before Greg could answer, Sherlock spoke.
"That there was Sally Donovan. It's the first time that I have seen her in person, but she fits Sherlock's description perfectly. She has an ax to grind against him. First, I think it's because he winds up involved with so many of their cold cases, the ones that have supernatural forces at work, that they would never have a shot in hell at solving because they don't know what they are looking for. But she also just doesn't like him." Greg explained. "Billy was likely asking around for Sherlock. He may have mentioned his name and inadvertently gotten Sherlock on Donovan's radar."
"Don't even try it." Greg warned feeling his blood pressure skyrocket. She had some nerve. "I am more capable than you know."  Anthea frowned as Greg's holy magic overpowered her own effectively shielding him from any spells.
Even the soul eater, Charles Magnussen, hadn't been safe. It was he that had placed the demonic runes in the church besides the statue. He had done it to pay off Moriarty. Moriarty had wanted to draw the hunter's attention. While Magnussen had upheld his end of the bargain, Moriarty had reneged on his. When Moriarty was unable to capture Holmes, he went after Magnussen in retaliation. Irene could still hear his mocking words intoned with madness. "Sorry, wrong day to die." He had laughed maniacally as he led the soul eater into a trap right into the priest's hands. Gregory Lestrade, who she now knew to be one of the last remaining honor guards, descendants of the knights of templar. The priest had banished the demon, clearly unaware that he was the creature responsible for the suicides in the church. Moriarty was clever. His actions held two purposes. One was purely revenge; the other was using the demon as bait to capture the priest. All roads led to Sherlock Holmes. Moriarty knew that the hunter would track the missing priest. But it hadn't worked out. Lestrade had proven much too powerful and Moriarty had been forced to back down.
Sherlock waited his eyes never leaving the mark as he waited for the tell tale vibration of a text. He glanced down in shock when a reply finally came.
“I’m alive? You have got to be fucking kidding me? You have some nerve to ask me that question? I watched you jump off the roof at Bart’s. I was at your funeral! How are you alive? Two years. I thought you were dead. You let me grieve.  How could you do that?”
“And there are no circumstances you can imagine which would justify torture.” Mycroft went on and Greg began to feel like a suspect.
Greg was unable to mask his confusion as he stared into John's tortured gaze. John's eyes were blue and his aura shimmered softly with white light. Greg could feel the pull of holy magic infusing through him as his relic worked quickly, impossibly so, to restore what power Greg had used. How? Greg's eyes drifted down to his relic, which John held gently in his hands, which glowed with brilliant white light. Holy magic, it was pouring from John and into Greg using the relic as a conduit. Greg closed his eyes feeling his holy magic being restored. "Greg, you're a median? You can soul gaze?" John asked in a soft voice. Greg nodded unable to calm his racing heart. He was still unable to believe the sight before him. In a matter of moments, John had shifted from dark to light. John continued his questioning ignoring Greg's shock and confusion. "What has become of my grace? Do I still have a soul? If I die, will I cease to exist or will I be sent straight to the bowels of hell?" Greg could glimpse a hint of fangs as John sighed softly looking at Greg with agonized uncertainty.
"My name is Harriet Watson and I have been trying to reach my brother Dr. John Watson and was told that he had re-enlisted with the military and that your office may be able to provide me with a contact number for him." She said. She would start politely and see where that got her first.
"Aye, notoriously stubborn and hard to train they are, but not Toby. He's the best of the best. Made it through all the required training. He's the best tracker there is. He can do just about anything, search and rescue, drug detection, bomb sniffing. Hell, he even track cadavers for body retrieval." Jones admitted as he gave Toby a scratch behind the ears.
“Interesting, that soldier fellow. He could be the making of my brother. Or make him worse than ever.” Words, much like actions, had a way of coming back to haunt you. Mycroft has never concealed the fact that he never liked John Watson. From their first meeting, Mycroft found him trying, refusing to be intimidated, refusing his bribe more as a snub than out of any genuine care for Sherlock, whom he had only just met. His nerve in asking Anthea for a date without any prior encouragement or interest having been signalled on her part, as though she didn’t know what there was to know about him, from his pitiful income to his even more pitiful state of emotional instability. The arrogance of him, thinking she might even consider saying yes.
"DI Lestrade, you bloody bastard!" Greg's head whipped around and Molly's snapped up from the table in the morgue where she was currently finishing up an autopsy. Greg stiffened as a blonde woman came charging at him looking ready to kill. "MIA!"
"SAS." She prompted as her other hand moved towards his throat. The man's eyes widened as he began to realize that Irene was not what she first appeared to be and that perhaps he was in over his head. "Where are the SAS troops?" She insisted. He shook his head and insisted.
"I'm his sister. I have a right to contact him. I want to speak to Mr. Holmes." Harry said struggling to keep from yelling.
Greg frowned as Sherlock approached the church with another unfamiliar man in tow. Sherlock typically worked alone. Greg narrowed his eyes, as he looked the man over critically. He was unremarkable, about 5'6, medium build, and sandy blond hair with a few streaks of grey at the temples, and dark blue indigo colored eyes. The man appeared human, but Greg had learned long ago that appearances could be deceiving. He clutched the bottle of holy water concealed in his cassock and twisted the cap opened. He then threw it in the man's face causing him to sputter and shout indignantly. "Bloody Hell! Are you mad?"
Poltergeist. Dark spirits. They were extremely tricky. Sherlock should have come to him, but for whatever reason, he had decided to go after it alone. Spirits were immune to spells and wards, but not impervious to certain rituals. They could be forced back into the afterlife and out of limbo, but few would go willingly. Greg respected the hunter greatly, but there were some things that Sherlock just wasn't capable of. Banishing a poltergeist was one of them. It took a very strong median. Greg just happened to be one. Greg's great grandmother had the sight. She was a Romani gypsy, who fell in love and married a Frenchman. Though his parents never said a word, Greg always suspected that his father was clairvoyant. He always chalked his eerie instincts up to luck or a simple "gut feeling" but Greg always suspected that it was more than that. He would never know for certain. His father had died when he was a teenager, just a year before his mother was killed.
Apologies for the long hiatus. My laptop with all my word files including my outlines crashed and nothing could be recovered. I debated about whether to continue or delete all of my unfinished work as I would have to redo the outlines and rewrite a number of unfinished scenes. I decided to continue writing.

“Watson!” John ignored the call from the sideline and plowed across the rugby field as the ball was passed to him. He grounded the ball in-goal, awarding a try to the team. His teammates whooped. “Time! Watson!” This time John turned recognizing the voice of his coach who was waving from the sideline. John trotted over his good mood sinking as he took in the frown on his coach’s face.
"Ta, John." Greg said before hanging up. John sighed and ran his fingers through his hair in frustration feeling torn. He closed his eyes for a few minutes debating what to say to Sherlock. He opened them when he felt the vehicle slow to a stop and realized that they had arrived at Baskerville.
"Meet me in Samara." He was looking at his phone with a deep frown on his face. "What the bloody hell does that mean? It's from an unknown number." Molly frowned and bit her lip in frustration. There was only one person that the text could be from, Sherlock. That meant that he knew that Greg was with her. Molly had hoped that she would be able to keep that fact a secret. She should have known better. There were no keeping secrets from Sherlock Holmes.
"Sergeant Lestrade, good to see you again." The Sergeant nodded and glanced at the dark haired man who was frowning deeply at Mycroft who then looked in his direction and addressed him. "Another case cracked, how very public spirited. Though that's never really your motivation, is it?" Mycroft asked the man in a sarcastic voice causing her to frown in confusion. The dynamic between them was hard to describe.
"Ta, Sherlock. That means a lot to hear you say that and I'm happy for you. If John makes you feel that way, well, you deserve to be happy." Sherlock smiled feeling a wave of relief.
Lost. He is lost within his own mind; a prison without walls, yet just as inescapable. Sherlock wanders within his mind palace; so deep within it that he comes upon things which he has long forgotten. The drugs pull him in and out, but sometimes he falls so far that he becomes lost. Trapped deeply in his own mind; a prison of his own making. Agitation makes him wander aimlessly down corridors he rarely bothers to explore, as evidenced by the bare white walls and the scant few threads that follow as he walks past room after room, until he reaches the outermost edge of his map. Behind these doors he houses his ugliest feelings, most hateful moments---everything that he kept not for pleasure or utility but for illustration. These are his  weaknesses and failures, meticulously catalogued to remind him that he is only a man and that he, too, makes mistakes. Memories appear and images flicker. John’s voice echoes in his head “You machine! Friends protect people.” Sherlock flinches as he recalls his retort.
“She’s quite fond of you. I wouldn’t worry.” Sherlock assured as they came to the door and opened it. They were greeted by Toby who whined and sniffed them before moving back to the sofa where Greg sat after whistling and calling the hound to his side.
"Keep your head up, Watson." John murmured to himself focusing his attention back to the task at hand.
“Something’s wrong.” Sherlock murmured softly under his breath. It’s starting. His mind pushed against the thought. Too soon. He was only thirteen. Mycroft didn’t present until he was sixteen. It was possible but unlikely. He abandoned the violin on the sofa and headed to the study. He couldn’t help the feeling of dread in the pit of his stomach. “Myc!” He shouted as he plowed through the door. “I think-“
"Not yet. I wanted to have a look myself first. You know how Sherlock can be." Greg said with a sigh. Molly mirrored it with one of her own.
Greg was one of the few priests left that was trained in the ancient ways of the occult. Few knew that the lore was based in truth. There were things not of this world, which were hidden from most, both good and evil; the darkness and the light. They were the things of nightmares and fairytales, which had long ago faded into legend: angels, demons, vampires, zombies, sprites, elves, witches, mages and hunters. Greg's eyes moved to the stain glass windows to the outer buttresses; their ledges were empty. The gargoyles had fled, another bad omen. The sentinels of the church only came to life when something evil slipped in. They only moved at night and with the sun high in the sky and the ledges empty, it was safe to assume that they were gone, never to return. It took something of great power to take down a gargoyle. Greg would need help with this one and he knew just who to call. Sherlock Holmes.
"You don't say". Lestrade said sarcastically. Molly entered to the morgue. She looked both worried and interested about this case.
They couldn't get upstairs fast enough, as soon as they did, their bodies sought one another unconsciously. John kicked the door to close it and focused all his attention on Sherlock. "You are brilliant", he whispered as he kissed Sherlock's jaw. "The way you examined the scene, the way you talked, the way you ran, God, I wanted to take you then and there."
Sherlock turned to look at John and spoke incredibly calm. "He was spying me. What a stupid decision he made. As if I'm some little child in need of protection."
"English! Oh, so, I guess I'll see you at lunch." Then Mike turned to say hello quickly to his other friends before turning again to John, still holding his friend's biology book. "Oh, come on, I'll help you take the books to the locker."
“STOP!”, John finally snapped. He turned his back towards Sherlock and stood up. Sherlock looked up and saw John’s shoulders trembling.
John's smile widened and their lips met again. He started unbuttoning Sherlock's trousers and Sherlock was panting, but he didn't stop stroking John, couldn't stop stroking John.
He remembered what Mike had told him and the boy had a point. It was better to set the grounds clear and there was no better chance to do it than now, since the greaser was barely alone and his friends were absolute jerks not to mention they now were picking on John and this was all Sherlock's fault and all because some freaking books.
He didn't get to. He slipped past the door while one of Mycroft's minions flirted with one of the nurses, but the minion realised of it and called for backup. Two minutes later he was tucked into bed again, scowling.
He wanted to stop thinking about John, to stop feeling whatever he was feeling towards the boy, he didn't want to anymore, he wouldn't bear it anymore, it was all too much. It was the way John smiled when he was angry, it was the way his hands clenched into fists when he was nervous, it was the way he fixed his glasses when he was thinking, it was the way his mouth tasted, the way he kissed: both inexperienced and perfect. It was the way he felt whenever he was with him. It was the way he felt whenever he was without him. It was what he told him at the party. It was the way he looked at Sarah. It was everything.
an advantage. But since when had he started caring about John Watson? He didn’t care about him, of course not, he just found him interesting, that was all.
"Because I asked you to keep an eye on him!" Sherlock said, suddenly getting furious, because what if something happened to John Watson? He would never ever forgive himself nor Mycroft for it!
But there were still lies between them, because John erased his mind believing a lie and because Sherlock faked his death believing the lie that John would wait for him and he was angry because John had believed the lie that Sherlock was some kind of hero and he was angry because he had believed the lie that love could save them. John had looked disappointed when he saw him at the hospital because John had believed the lie that Sherlock was
Sherlock more than he ever did before, he needed his company, he needed his advice, his help, his support. So he just let himself go and stood there, his head on Sherlock's shoulder, enjoying it while it lasted, but he kept crying and he couldn't stop and he hated that.
John sighed and crouched in front of him, he placed a kiss on Sherlock's head before leaving. "See you on Monday, love."
But he never saw the world in other people’s faces. He never saw the depth and complexity of their thoughts, never even got a simple glimpse of the possibility of
Melissa pulled out a piece of paper and started to read. “I don't know how I'm meant to be writing this. I'm not a writer.”
Lestrade looked down, "haven't you stopped to consider that perhaps he, I don't know, might be in his own house while we're trying to bust in?"
“Why does it have to be something negative? Why can’t you just simply accept the scar and see it as something that is just part of you?”
Lestrade stared at him for a moment, looking dumbfounded. He knew better than to ask where Sherlock wanted to go, so he simply followed him.
“No need to thank me, John. The credit is all yours, I’ve only provided guidance, but you’ve done it.”
They remained silent for a moment, neither of them capable of saying a word, probably for different reasons.
Sherlock stood silent, then Mycroft walked towards the couch and sat, keeping his eyes fixed on his little brother. "So... John Watson."
Thank you so much for your wonderful feedback and for loving this story so much, I wish you the best in this year that's about to come and lots of luck with the episodes. :3
Sherlock rolled his eyes, “a fictional and overromanticized retelling of the actual events, with far too many adornments and too little information of the real facts if you ask me, but I’m certain the gigantic number of followers it got would beg to differ.”
Sherlock flinched and looked down, then let out a sigh as if he was going to talk about something painful. "Oh. My car. I miss my rocket. I miss it so bad. It was my birthday present. 16th birthday. And no more no less than a Cadillac! ElDorado, 1954. Beautiful. It was completely useless after the accident. My parents sold it as junk. That, of all things about that accident, is what hurts me the most, that I lost my companion."
Lestrade turned to look at Sherlock, who waved a hand dismissively. He honestly couldn’t care less. He trusted Melissa. Lestrade nodded.
John cleared his throat, tossing the phone back to Melissa. He sat straight. “My therapist asked me to create a blog, but I had nothing the write about, nothing ever happened to me. I started writing in the blog after our first case together-” He smiled. “He was just...incredible and I wanted the world to know how smart this man was, how much my life had changed in a second. Suddenly, we became kind of popular. We even had tabloid nicknames and-” He chuckled at the memory. “Deerstalker hats. God, I loved writing on that blog.”
Sherlock shook his head. “Can’t. Have history and Hikes will find out where I was. He already threatened me, next time he catches me smoking I’ll get in serious trouble. Not that I mind, but I want to avoid any future conversation with my brother.”
"Good choice, Mr. Holmes." Then she widened her eyes for a while, as if she remembered something she should say. "Oh! Mr Holmes, please, please try to stay away from Dr. Watson for a while, at least until his brain recovers from the void left by your memories. If you overexpose yourself to him, it might be a bit overwhelming for his brain and it could be dangerous. Just for a week or two, okay?"
*hides in a corner* Hello! I'm so, so sorry for taking so long to update this little one. Life has been...busy lately, to say the least. I want to thank you for your patience, and for your lovely comments, kudos and bookmarks. You've made my life brighter with all your wonderful responses and I hope you enjoy what's about to come.
"Hi Sarah, I'm sorry I'm late." John said rushing to grab his robe. He arrived home late, hadn't slept pretty well last night and he had fallen asleep after the alarm rang. He had to dress in a rush and practically run towards the hospital.
Just as he passed by the greaser's table, Greg stood up, said he had to go to the bathroom and left the cafeteria.
John frowned, his back still turned towards the stranger, not being able to identify who it was, but apparently Sherlock did, because almost instantly his eyes opened widely and he stood completely still, almost frozen.
Greg was getting used to get this kind of responses so he just smiled. "Oh come on! You can't tell me that crap you read is better than hanging out with us."
"Hm. His office couldn't scream it louder if he wanted to. A 'Spanish for dummies' book laying on his desk, a coupon to 'all the tacos you can eat' he had used two weeks before, probably preparing his stomach, and his very obvious inclination to collect the mementos brought by his patients related to death, since he has at least two small skeleton toys in the office that don't belong to him. He wants to be there by the Dia de los Muertos, which will be in three weeks, so planning a long stay. He asked for a month of holidays, anyway. Left two days ago."
"Are you sure?" Greg asked, looking worried. Sherlock must be looking terrible for him to be so preoccupied. "I can bring you a glass of water, or something..."
Melissa reached for her phone and opened John’s blog. She tossed it to Hawthorne. “Go ahead, read it before it’s too late. I want to delay deleting it as much as possible.”
He stood in front of the phone thinking about it, about how much he had changed, about how much Sherlock had changed, and about how much things were changing. He smiled. A loud sound brought him back to reality. Chuck Berry. He went back upstairs, Sherlock was sitting on the floor, mimicking the guitar solo from the beginning of the song. He had his back turned against John, so he couldn't see his face. John chuckled and cleared his throat. Sherlock stopped moving immediately and turned to face John, and he was actually
"Oh, I see", he said, his hands balling into fists. He stood up and looked at Sherlock with an expression akin to rage. "It's not about the leg, is it? You just think it might slow you down."
it, John. Don't let your parents make you think otherwise. You're good enough, you're better than good. And once you prepare for it, you'll be one of the greatest doctors in the country!"
John sat there, confused, not quite understanding what had just happened. Sherlock came back a minute later and,without muttering a word, he sat on the rug and opened the book again.
"Let me just give you a warning, Johnny boy. Stop messing with us, leave Sherlock alone, and stop pretending you will become one of us, because that will
"I'm fine! I'm fine! I don't need your worry nor your pity!" John said in a tone that came almost like a shout without him wanting to.
John fell silent. Now that he could finally talk to Sherlock he didn't know what to say. "I... Why were you mad at me yesterday?"
Mycroft didn’t reply, he simply sported his hideous smug smile and left. Of course he knew. Of course he bloody knew.
"Hurts", was all Sherlock could say. He shut his eyes closed once again. Mycroft frowned and looked around, as if he hadn't realised that it had already dawned. It was 7 a.m, if Sherlock could judge by the position of the sun.
Melissa looked down. "Was." She preferred not telling him right now she had been the responsible for that, but what could she do? She was just following orders. "Listen, from what I've read, you are one of the most brilliant minds of the century." Her voice was soft and tender.
Sherlock smirked. "No, you can't. You need me." He said stepping into the crime scene and gesturing John with his hand to follow him.
He had to shut them off for now. He had to stop them if he wanted to solve this case. He had to be a perfect rationing machine.
Expressed in the painting of London that stared at him directly in the face, that spoke to him in so many ways, that expressed the vibrancy and the movement of a city that never stopped, that was his
John knitted his eyebrows together and took a sip of tea. "No, not really. Why?" He said after he drank.
John muttered something in surprise, but kissed him back, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's nape and tangling his fingers through Sherlock's curls. Their mouths opened to each other.
They looked recent, very recent. John didn’t know much on the subject, never felt particularly inclined to try them although they were quite popular amongst the artists, but he could recognize that they were not simply scars. They were marks, recent marks.
“So this man is sort of a celebrity?” Hawthorne asked curiously as they sat on the table standing in front of John’s bed. He looked around and his expression was seriously surprised because John’s flat looked gray, dim and lifeless. Nothing at all like he’d pictured it.
"No, but I want to. Come on, I promise you it will be fun!" Sherlock said grabbing John's hand and taking him into the record store.
“That night I made the biggest mistake I could have done. I regretted it for the next year and a half.”
"That's because you haven't lived it." Then Sherlock sat straight and leaned to take a better look at John, which definitely unfocused him from the road. "You haven't lived at all, actually. Oh, sweet little sixteen."
She smiled, face relaxing a bit. "Good, I'm glad you understand. Now off we go, but let me turn the radio today, okay?"
Almost as soon as they stood up, a voice behind them took them by surprise. "My, oh my-" The playful voice behind them said.
Sherlock turned to look at him and couldn’t help but smile back. John’s smile turned into a grin as he stared deeply into Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock nodded and shifted in the chair but as soon as he did another ripple of pain hit him in the back. He involuntarily groaned. John looked at him alarmed but then remembered, “right, the back. I need to check on the place it hit the foot of the bed”, he cleared his throat and looked around, awkwardly. “Erm- ”, he hesitated, “take off your shirt, please.”
They came back to Scotland Yard afterwards. Sherlock wished he could grab his own wall and hang the evidence and the pictures there, but John couldn't know anything.
He heard the door of the apartment close. John was gone. When he calmed himself enough, Sherlock went to the living room and remembered what happened when he was talking to Mycroft: Irene had texted him, he took his phone in a rush, and unlocked it.
“I failed”, Sherlock whispered. As soon as he said it he felt the first tear making his way out of his eye and Sherlock was too exhausted so he just let it fall and saw it drop on his hand, which was clenching and unclenching. His other hand was closed so tight on his fist that he felt the nails digging up to his skin and leaving bruises. He didn’t care. “I failed”, he said again and his voice came with a sob. “I didn’t make it because they were right.”
Finally, after an endless, infinite and agonizing number of minutes, or so it seemed in John's brain, the paramedics arrived.
"Will you delete him from your mind again if he doesn't?", Greg asked, sounding slightly bitter about it.
Sherlock looked at John, who was just sitting there, looking at him and fixed his eyes -once again- on his -no longer- trembling hand.
John stood still, his mouth half open. Sherlock couldn’t bear to look at him, because he knew, he knew nothing good was going to come out of it and he just had made things more uncomfortable between them. There was nothing good in telling John that, and yet he had chosen to do it so. Stupid, stupid.
Sherlock smiled but his eyes were still observing all the place and refusing to look at John. "Hmmm?". He said, clearly distracted.
But beyond the emptiness and the feeling of loss and the raw nostalgia, there was an absorbing feeling of...encompassing. As if with every single word, with every phrase and with every expression, John gave a little bit of Sherlock's heart back, a little bit of his life back, as if bit by bit they were rebuilding whatever was shattered.
By the time they arrived to Scotland Yard, Sherlock had already sent two texts asking Lestrade to keep John distracted while he looked at the files with Melissa, so it was no surprise that the detective inspector was waiting for them when they got out of the cab.
The teacher arrived. A man in his fifties, definitely. So he had been born before the First World War! He taught history because he
He didn't even have to lean. Sherlock had already pushed himself up on his elbows as much as he could, driven by an unspoken magnetism which pulled him towards John. He ached to feel John's lips on his again, just as he had dreamt of when he had been shot.
“You started it”, John said, with a shrug, unable to stop the smile that was involuntarily drawing itself on his lips. Sherlock apparently was unable to stop his own as well. “I still need a place to mix the colors. Mind if I use your table?”, he said jokingly.
Sherlock didn't get to hear about that particular moment, about that single second in which a thousand universes collided and a bullet graced John's shoulder and he lost everything he thought he'd wanted.
The door of his house was opened, and from the entrance he saw his mother sitting in the kitchen table, hands on her head, with the telephone right next to her, waiting for news. As soon as he entered she ran towards him. "John Hamish Watson where were you?" She said looking very angry.
John’s hand. He cursed his goddamned need to stick to detail, if he were an impressionist he wouldn’t be having this problem. “You weren’t supposed to see that.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes again and turned to look at Melissa, who was now on her feet, ready to spring into action. “What can I do to help, Mr. Holmes?”
he looked towards the window and yes, by the likes of it, it seemed as if it was the afternoon, around 1 or 2 p.m.
"Well... It's just that... You know... It's Harry's last day here and I'd like to spend every single moment from now on with her. Our relationship it's going so good, Sherlock. Things have changed so much."
"Yes, yes that one!" She said opening the door of the car and getting in. John let out a sigh. "Now tell me, where were you?"
He lifted his head suddenly. "John?", he asked into the oxygen mask almost involuntarily, clinging into the only name capable of keeping him right amidst all this hatful familiarity.
He tried to hide the grin that was threatening to appear and entered to the classroom. Sherlock wasn't there yet. As he sat, he started tapping his feet on the floor but stopped it as soon as he realized why he was doing it: he was anxious to see Sherlock.
John walked around the Tate Modern as if he owned it. For Sherlock it was nothing but a labyrinth of passages and grim lighting, but John knew exactly where he was going to, as if he had walked down the same path his whole life.
After a long walk they finally arrived to a cafeteria which was definitely not John's style at all. At the entrance, it was decorated with a big car, and Rock n' Roll sounded strenuously and there was also a black and white tiled dance floor with lots of people dancing to that music. He turned to look at Sherlock with displease, but the greaser's face was lighting up. John smiled.
"He was shot", he said as he stared into nothingness, his brain screaming at him that sentence over and over.
Writers throughout history went over and over through the thing known as the ‘power of words’, and Sherlock never really paid mind to it, after all he simply spoke the truth, plain and simple, and he barely cared about what he said, save some exceptions. But John’s text made him realize that all those romantics actually did have a point: one word. Nine letters. And everything changed.
He rolled his eyes. "thank you for stating the obvious, Lestrade. This is unnecessary, I'll have a perfectly capable doctor at
Sherlock closed his eyes. Why on earth did he allow himself to act on impulse? Nothing ever good came out of it. Ever.
So he let go with it, after the initial shock was over, he kissed him back, their mouths opened to each other. Sherlock's hands cupped John's face and John grabbed at Sherlock's hair.
He couldn't deny he felt a bit uncomfortable with that outfit, but with the nervousness he was feeling at the moment he couldn't care less about the way he looked.
John finished his cup of tea in silence and (reluctantly) stood up. “This has been very productive but- but I have to go.”
He'd wanted to escape to John's room but three things had certainly interceded on his inability to do it: 1. He didn't know wether John wanted to see him or not, and if he didn't he would understand, 2. Mycroft had apparently warned his minions about Sherlock's plan and so they had planted two security guards on his door and 3. He felt too weak to move. The morphine had provided relief, but he was certain that his body was in no shape at all, and had no energy to move, even to such a short distance. So he decided to sleep.
"Alright, now go and talk to that freak because you are the only one who can stand him without losing your mind."
John had no idea what to ask, because there was so much to ask, so many things he needed to know. He was silent for a moment and then turned to look at the greaser in the face. "Why me, Sherlock?"
John took a deep breath, trying to steady himself. "Sure." He whispered. "He... He's dead. He killed himself. Didn't say much. Just... We talked one last time and he said it had all been a lie. His last words were
Sherlock stared at John’s retreating figure and it took him a couple of seconds before he actually registered what he had said and he started following him.
The thought of Molly and Sherlock invaded his mind and he didn't like it. "Oh, alright." He said as she passed him a piece of paper with few scratches on it.
He heard Sherlock’s voice once again in his head. That deep, captivating voice. He could almost hear his laughter, see his face, his gray/blue/green eyes… He kept that image in his mind. Probably the happiest memory of his life.
She looked around the flat. She definitely didn’t expect it to look so… boring either. She assumed that even after his best friend’s -
Molly smiled. "Yes! It is! I'm kind of having a tiny crush on him" she said lowly, leaning closer to John.
"When did you first go to rehab?" John asked, his voice just a bit louder than a whisper. His tone was soft and tender as if afraid Sherlock would just retreat and run away in any second.
Sherlock kept staring down, he wasn't going to reply, John had told him to shut up. Plus, what could he say to make things better?
"I'd prefer to talk in private." Sherlock said, standing close to him. Not as close as before, but still close.
"Well, think of something." John had reminded himself again to be patient, but God, it was hard being patient with this boy.
“What? How?”, he wasn’t able to finish any of those sentences, who did this man think he was? “who told you?”
”, he said, pointing towards the picture. “Especially after- after Afghanistan. Thank you”, his voice wavered.
Outside, a woman was trying to pass by the police tape, while two men held her. And she was screaming. "Let me go!"
And so she did, he looked at them carefully, tried to remember the mental image he had of her. The woman in the picture looked so much like her, but it was
Mycroft started moving his umbrella. "I'm sure they'd be glad to hear you brought another one of your...
He wouldn't handle all of that, no matter how much he insisted on saying he didn't feel things that way.
"It isn't yours either. Yet she dragged you here." John said looking very torn and sad and Sherlock wanted to see him smile again but didn't know how.
And he lost his ‘friends’, he lost his money, he lost his prestige, he lost his popularity and he lost his talent. Now no one cared or even remembered that at some point, not so many years ago, the newspapers were filled with the picture of a teenager who had too many hopes and dreams, and had made them true.
"An accident, Johnny boy. Someone crashed my car, I was leaving a party, but I swear I wasn't drunk, and the next thing I knew a paramedic was taking me off the driver's seat and I was being taken to the hospital and I woke up two days later with this scar."
He tossed his hands into his pockets and felt the small package. The fingertip of his index caressed it, felt the shape of each one of the five pills left. The colors he liked, the dose he needed. Hell, Victor knew him well.
And he decided to go to Battersea, then he went to the pool and he walked past the window where John saved his life for the very first time.
"Why? Are you terrified you might feel the same way about me?" Sherlock said, now looking confident with himself. "Because I think you do, because I think that, even though you tried, you couldn't. You still can't", the greaser reached out a hand and pointed at John's forehead. "I'm right there, ain't I?"
But John sat still. Molly reacted and went to John's desk while Sherlock stood impatiently at the door. She leaned closer to him and whispered. "I really think you should better be off, John. If you need anything else just tell me, okay?"
. He couldn't do that. He didn't trust her. But if he didn't, what was she doing in his apartment? Why did he have lunch with her? Nothing.
It was 10 p.m and John was looking at Sherlock's bed, terrified of getting into it. Last night it had been easier because he was drunk and he wasn't even aware of what he was doing, it was his subconscious talking. But this was different, he was actually getting into his bed, God, he had to treasure that moment.
At 9:00 p.m. Sherlock's phone vibrated inside John's pocket. He took it out and keeping an eye on Sherlock so he wouldn't find out, he read the message: "
and looking so incredibly focused, it was a sight he felt he could never get used to, seeing him so absorbed, so lost in his own world...
Lestrade shook his head with a small smile as he closed the door behind him. "Feeling better, I take it?"
Okay, so finally these two got things clear!!! I love slow burn but this was far too slow even for me! So thank you for being patient! What did you think? Leave comments! :D
Sherlock rolled his eyes, clearly annoyed at Lestrade's way to bring the subject. "What kind of machines do you use to perform the procedures, Melissa?"
And Sherlock did. Because that was the same thing John had asked him to do when he didn’t have any forces left back in Serbia, and he would do it again and again if John asked him to. He would always come back to John.
John was in pain. That much was clear. What he needed to know was if the pain his own brain was causing him would prove itself mortal. He couldn’t possibly know that. He had to act fast anyway, do something. Anything.
He had slept deeply. Alcohol could explain that as well. Although it couldn't explain why he had so many dreams throughout the night. He went to one scenario to the other, over and over and over again. Alcohol, however could explain why he couldn't remember any of those dreams at all. He knew he had them, but he couldn't quite picture them.
Harry bursted into laugher while John just stared at her confused. "A what? Oh John, don't play games with me! Which person, any
But no. He wouldn’t do it. He’d hate to see the disappointment in John’s face. He knew it would drive him away, and he knew it was what he was supposed to do, but he didn’t want to do it.
"Michael Jones, the only name I can find. Here it says that he and Melissa dated for-", he turned the page, "two years before their break up. That was two weeks before she checked into Lacuna, so she probably erased him from her mind."
John rolled his eyes, making his way to the locker and trying to erase the anger that was rising. "Typical."
No. He couldn't let John see them. He didn't want John to see him. Didn't want John to pity him. Didn't want to see the downturn of his face as soon as he felt them beneath his touch.
She pulled a shaky fake smile and looked at the cup, taking another sip. "My brother..." Sherlock rolled his eyes, he didn't want to have this conversation right now. "...I don't know what happened yesterday, Sherlock. But I've never seen him smiling as much as he did today."
John shook his head. "Don't worry, he didn't cross the line, well, he inquired a little about me and you, but that was okay. What I was worried about was what he told
"Oh great, you could teach him some things about Rock n' Roll. Seems like he needs to learn them too." Sherlock said smiling sarcastically.
He tried to cover his anger with an empty, meaningless smirk: "Anthea, I need you to put me in contact with the head of security at the Palace. Now."
She bit her lip and stood silent for a while. Finally she shook her head, “I’m sorry, I can’t remember. It was too long ago, Mr. Holmes, I wish I could.”
“Alright, Dr. Watson. We’ll give you a pill which will put you into deep sleep. We’ll connect the wires just like we did earlier and since we’ve already traced the map of Sherlock Holmes in your brain, all we have to do is delete it. It’s quite a huge map, if I may say.”
As far as Sherlock knew, John didn’t know Melissa before The Fall. She had been working at Lacuna for the last three years at least, so they couldn’t have met at work. She referred to him as ‘Doctor Watson’ which meant that they didn’t simply met at a pub or a café. All the evidence pointed towards them meeting for the first time at Lacuna and that meant that Melissa had transgressed the rules of the manual and hadn’t erased herself-
Mycroft was about to reply when his eyes turned to John who was blushing and unaware of the conversation the Holmes were having because he was
What good would it make? he couldn't keep breaking John, tearing him to pieces, and trying to stitch him together. He wasn't a healer. He couldn't do that. He just broke and broke and broke and never stopped to look back. Everything he touched turned into pieces.
"Oi, so sorry to hear it, Greg. Were they close friends of yours?" Molly asked. Greg sighed and debated how much to disclose. What the hell? Molly already knew the bulk of it. Go all in.
"If you would stop acting like a spoiled child, then perhaps I would stop treating you like one." Mycroft replied. "Dr. Watson, I'm surprised you went along with this."
"Johnny's MIA, presumed dead." She blurted out in a sorrowful voice. "You know that woman, Anthea, the one who works for the all powerful Mycroft Holmes. The same one, who refused to give me any information when Johnny was alive, had the nerve to call me to tell me that he was missing and presumed dead. I never got to talk to him and tell him I'm sorry and that I love him! You all took that from me!"
Uncle Rudolph made good on the first half of his promise, Mycroft had obtained an internship, but the Omega tragically died just a few months after Mycroft presented leaving a void in their family which had only grown after their parents were killed. Mycroft dreaded the day that Sherlock presented but he had at least warned his brother which was more preparation than he had gotten.
"You're always clever, Mary. I was relying on that. I planted the information for you to find." Sherlock goaded. John. He needed to find John and this woman was the key to finding him. Sherlock held her stare daring her to pull the trigger. He was unsure if she would, she was an assassin and no doubt had her marching orders, what those were remained a mystery. "A façade. Sorry, I could resist a touch of drama. How good a shot are you?" Mary smirked and replied.
“Moran, the agent in Mycroft’s report, she was working for Moran. It was me all along, you were the lure, forgive me.” Sherlock begged in a hoarse whisper. “I was wrong. Sentiment is not a chemical defect found in the losing side, I care for you, I think I love you but I’ve never been in love before and I don’t know how it feels.”
Molly adjusted her sunglasses and tightened the scarf around her head as they moved through the Afghan market. She looked around for her target. The blond woman had been the only constant in Peter Small's reports, yet she remained elusive. Molly had called in the one favor that she had. It was a big one. There were many people that were indebted to Mycroft Holmes, but she was one of the few, which he was beholden to. She had called in her favor that she had earned for her role in faking Sherlock's death. Anthea had given her a hard copy of the reports from Peter Small, Mycroft's contact for John in Afghanistan. He was currently missing, but his reports told a story and Molly was determined to follow it to the end. Sherlock's words still haunted her "I think I'm going to die." Not if she had anything to do with it, she thought viciously. She had agreed to help Sherlock as the guilt over her role in his fall and then ultimately John's reenlistment and capture over took her. She would make it right. It had become a vow, a mantra and she was not about to let anything stand in her way. Molly had hinted at information and Sherlock had quickly deduced the source of her intel. "Mycroft, of course, all other men are specialist, but his specialism is omniscience." Molly's silence was confirmation enough.
"I knew that I'd find you here. You just left without a word while that Selkie was in the midst of a panic attack looking for her stolen skin. 'Just going to make a cuppa, John, I'll only be a moment' Do you routinely walk out on your clients? How did you even get out? Climb down the fire escape?" John accused.
"While I am able to appreciate that the situation that you had found yourself in was far from ideal, it was of your own making, Sherlock. In your haste, you grew careless. Sentiment is clouding your judgment. I grow weary of cleaning up your messes. None of this is ideal, but we had very little to work with and the fact that both you and John are still breathing is, one must surely see, a miracle in no small order. I do not expect your gratitude, but I do expect your cooperation. You know what you need to do."
Greg coughed and pulled himself from his musing. He had work to do. He had been called upon to investigate a weeping statue, which the people had proclaimed to be a miracle that had been drawing a small but steady pilgrimage. Greg wished that he had been called sooner, the church had only decided that it was worth investigating after a number of people committed suicide within the statue's presence. Greg looked around the empty church. The alter was still stained with the blood of one of the victims. The blood splatter from the gunshot arched up onto the large crucifix. This was no miracle, of that much he was certain, there was something unnatural afoot, however. What it was exactly, he couldn't say. The marble statue of the Virgin Mary stood with blood stained tear tracks running down its full length that blood pooled at the feet. Greg ran his finger down one of the trails and whispered "Hic est sanguinis mei." This is my blood. The blood turned black. No miracle, quite the opposite. Below the puddle, the familiar Latin phrase Lux in Tenebris was spelled out in blood. Light in darkness. Ancient runes surrounded the statue. Greg squinted and studied them but couldn't place their origin or translate them. That was unusual. Greg had a knack for languages and it was very rare for him to come across something that he couldn't at least partially translate. He moved towards the holy water font and scooped up a palm full. He splashed it over the runes causing them to smoke and sizzle as the smell of brimstone filled the air. "Demon," Greg murmured under his breath as he glanced around warily clutching the heavy beads of his rosary made of pure silver, which lay concealed within the folds of his cassock.
"Fine, but I want to know, Sherlock. Who is John Watson and what is he to you? There's something I'm not seeing and contrary to what you claim, I have good instincts. He's setting off my wards and I hate going in blind." Lestrade said.
"I don't know why you think that I can convince him when you couldn't. I'm nobody." John claimed. Greg scoffed and retorted.
"It's hard to know for sure, but if I had to guess, three months." Murray confessed in a voice that was barely audible. His eyes darted around looking for captors. They were never far. Murray stifled a moan as his stomach cramped brutally followed by a hot flash. He could feel perspiration begin to coat his body. It was always hot in this godforsaken place, but this was different, more intense. A storm was brewing. There wasn't much time. He needed to warn John before it was too late.
"One thread left, Mycroft. That's it, Moran." Sherlock answered in a hoarse voice full of emotion. "I can't lose him, Myc. Not now. Not when I'm this close. Mycroft's cold glare softened and Sherlock could see sympathy and pity in his eyes.
Sometimes Sherlock gets the impression that he's said something, something important, but he can never quite remember what. Eventually the sounds of Mycroft's tears fade away and Sherlock falls asleep to the sound of his breathing. The pressure of his back expanding against his chest with the movement of his lungs is the last thing Sherlock can remember before the memory dissipates and he is left with only a handful of memory and the dim, dusty light from his flashlight.
"I'm busy, Donovan. You'll have to make due without me and earn your pay for once." Sherlock snapped. The woman, Donovan, huffed before looking at Greg suspiciously.
“You look pale and you’re clammy. Do you feel ill?” He asked brushing his fingers against John’s brow. “You feel warm. You likely have a low grade fever.”
Greg sighed and debated whom to call. Sherlock came to mind immediately, but this seemed too close to home. Personal. Greg decided instead to call in a favor and dialed. "Molly, It's Greg. I'm calling about the dead priests."
“I doubt that will be an issue. We are literally being forced into extinction.” Mycroft snarled causing Sherlock to cower. Mycroft’s sudden anger vanished seemingly as quickly as it had appeared. “I’m sorry, Lock. I didn’t mean it. I’m overdue to cycle off it’s been 18 months since my rut. Bloody hormones.” Sherlock jumped out of the chair and moved towards Mycroft slipping his arms around his brothers neck nuzzling into his neck and allowing Mycroft to do the same. Even unpresented, his pheromones would help to calm his brothers distress as he would smell of family.
"John, he's been bitten. He'll rise a fully turned vampire by sunset tomorrow. I can't do it Mycroft…I know I should kill him, but I can't." Sherlock choked out. "We're at the pool where Carl Power's died. It was Moriarty." Sherlock didn't bother to explain that it had been Moriarty who had been responsible for Carl's death as well as John.
"Guardians are not to interfere only observe and report." John said in a hollow voice. "I knew the consequences, but I couldn't let it happen. It wasn't right. All the others were taken naturally, but not her. She was innocent." John's eyes moved to Mycroft and Anthea who were still unconscious. "I should wake them." John murmured looking between Greg and Sherlock for confirmation.
“Uncle, are you suggesting traffickers?” Mycroft asked feeling sick at the thought. He wouldn’t force a bond. He would stay on suppressants.
"John, what the Hell?" Sherlock demanded not able to fully mask the catch of emotion in his voice. Moriarty smiled pleased that Watson was proving to be so useful.
Apologies for the long hiatus. My laptop with all my word files including my outlines crashed and nothing could be recovered. I debated about whether to continue or delete all of my unfinished work as I would have to redo the outlines and rewrite a number of unfinished scenes. I decided to continue writing. I have not purchased a new laptop with a word processor and am writing on my tablet. Please excuse any errors.
"Do you plan to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes?" Mycroft asked pulling John's attention from the phone. His brother was texting him; Mycroft didn't need to be a genius to deduce that.
“You don’t care about John. I get that, he’s not your blood. But I know you care about Sherlock. I’ve seen it with my own eyes.
“You’ve made your point clear enough that I already know your opinion.” Mycroft insisted even more coldly. “I did not intend to--I only meant that I’m not discussing this topic because I’m not at liberty and not because I’m afraid of what you would think.”
Initially, John had been distracted. He had been taken by surprise when he first met Dr. Molly Hooper, the pathologist who led them down to the morgue. Necromancer, despite that, John sensed no darkness in her, which was most unusual. Necromancers, for the most part were dark, but not always, so it seemed. The bit of grace that remained in John allowed him to see what most others could not, the supernatural creatures, both light and dark, which roamed the earth. It was just enough to give him the sight, but not so much that it rendered him unable to pass as human to other supernatural beings. Before John could contemplate what to make of her, his eyes shifted to the man in the room.
Greg took a drag off of his cigarette releasing a stream of smoke with a sigh as the dial tone greeted him after Sherlock had unceremoniously hung up. Greg didn't quite know what to do at this point. Sherlock didn't want help and he and Molly were out manned and outgunned. This situation was quickly going from bad to worse. In fact, at this point Greg considered it to be a complete clusterfuck. Sherlock Holmes, it always came down to Sherlock. Greg could recall the night he had spoken the words to John. "Sherlock Holmes is a great man and one day he might even be a good one." That remained to be seen. Greg had thought that he had seen Sherlock at his lowest point. Now, however, he wasn't so sure. Sherlock had always been a bit broken, but after meeting John, Greg had caught a glimpse of the good man that he knew that he could be. But, now with John missing, Greg doubted that Sherlock would ever be the same. There was only so much pain and guilt a man could take. Greg could remember the day that they had met. The man had been fresh out of University and high as a kite, although, at the time Greg had been none the wiser.
“God, I sound so fucking naive. I thought we didn’t do that anymore. I thought--I mean if nothing else, I thought people agreed that torture doesn’t even work.”
Sherlock couldn’t know for sure, but couldn’t shake the feeling that he would present as Omega despite the long odds.
"Appointment in Samara, the merchant who can't outrun death. You always hated that story as a child." Mycroft replied sounding perplexed.
"Mrs. Hudson, do try to keep up, I was telling you about the army doctor. His name is John Watson and I've offered him a flat share and he'll be here this afternoon." Martha's eyes widened in surprise. Flatmate? Sherlock thought most people were idiots and when not on a case or on a hunt, he, as a rule tended to avoid company for the most part. Sherlock sensed her thoughts and answered before she could voice the question.
John's jaw dropped in shock as his eyes darted between Anthea and Mycroft. "You two are dating?" He asked looking for confirmation. Mycroft clamped his jaw shut feeling his blood pressure rise.
"You- You know me!" He found himself saying, reaching for John's hands, but the closer he leaned to the boy, the further he seemed. "You know me better than anyone else! What I like, what I don't like, how I think, how I feel..."
She stared at him with a raised eyebrow and John begged him with his eyes. She sighed, "I'll go and make a round, by the time I pass by your room I want to see you there."
John cried freely into Sherlock's chest. Sherlock had never seen him before, had never been so close as to experience John's sobs, he felt John's body shaking, radiating energy against him. He felt his shirt soaking wet from John's tears, but most importantly, he felt John's presence there, even if it meant it'd be the last time, John was there. He closed his eyes and placed a kiss against the top of John's head, and stood still, sensing the smell of John's hair
Irene smiled calmly. "Look, Sherlock, you would have to be two things to deny the possibility of being with me: either an idiot or gay. I know you are not an idiot. Certainly not an idiot. So there's only one left."
But somehow, during those days when there was nothing but powder and heat and sand and it all seemed so far away that even the frontier between life and death was non-existent, John would imagine himself painting. Painting was his way of escaping the horrors of war. He never imagined painting something in particular, simply enjoyed mixing the colors and listening to the sound the paint did then the brush collided with the canvas.
He wished he could know how to stop being so stupid and start thinking clearly. His brain had stopped being logical since that first time he kissed Victor Trevor, so many years ago. He regretted it, in so many ways. He regretted everything that happened after it of course, but none of it would have happened had he been strong enough to simply back down, to say 'no', to toss away whatever feelings he had for Trevor and continue with the perfectly rational life he had been living up until that moment.
Sherlock. How cute. You are like an old married couple, you know each other, you've seen him at his worse, you've seen him at his best. You would do anything for him. I'm sorry Johnny, it's just so freaking obvious."
She turned to look at John. "Fine. Fine. But I did warn you, John. I told you not to get involved with that greaser."
Finally, after hours minutes seconds. After infinite periods of stagnation and worry, after debating over and over again what his life without Sherlock Holmes in it would be, Mycroft walked into the room.
already. What did he think? That the cigarettes held magic answers? That he would smoke one and suddenly he would be 'happy' again?
It was about her. It was always about her. John felt angry, not because Sherlock didn't tell him, but because he was protecting her, again. "Fine, it's okay, don't tell me anything. Fine. I just want to warn you something: you are falling right into her trap. She has you exactly where she wants to. Do you even remember what she did Sherlock?"
It was cold around him. Suddenly, his brain caught up with what had happened the night before and he sat up in a rush, looking around.
They went into the room. John sat down clenching his fists. He looked at Harry, his face was red, completely red with anger.
John didn’t have any feeling attached to his own flat. That much was true. Perhaps John had some feelings towards the hospital where he worked, but at this hour it would be extremely crowded and busy, and so it would be far much difficult. No.
He showed his badge. His brother had saved it for him, passed by security, straightened his coat, cleared his throat and entered Lestrade's office. It was just like he remembered it, time seemed to have frozen in that boring office. There was a box of donuts and a coffee laying on his desk but no trace of the DI. He frowned. Where the hell was everybody?
In that moment they heard a noise downstairs, they both looked at the door. After a few steps, Sherlock appeared in the door, looking down. "John why is the door open? You know we shouldn't..."
“Yes, no, I understand”, he cleared his throat. “It’s fine. Good. I’ll see you later, then?”, not next Tuesday, not next Thursday, simply later.
This was not the time to panic. This was not the moment to store in his own brain the smell of death and the sensation of Sherlock dying on his arms.
His hands were shaking and slowly, oh so terribly slowly, for time is relative, Sherlock unbuttoned John's trousers and unzipped them. John moaned.
"Alice Pollock. I've heard that name before, I'm certain I've heard her name before", Lestrade said thoughtfully.
"Yes", Sherlock replied almost immediately, standing up and grabbing his bag. "See you in the parking lot."
John's face transformed. He looked in pain, as if every part of his body hurt. "A year and a half-", he repeated after a moment of silence, now moving towards the chair and sitting on it. He covered his hands with his eyes, his shoulders slumped as if he had been drained from all the energy he had left in his body. "A year and a half and another year and a half while you were playing hide and seek. That makes three years. Three years of my life I've forgotten about."
After a moment of hesitation, the detective kept walking silently, sitting on his chair. His eyes flickered almost instantly towards the chair standing in front of him, but Greg knew it wasn't an invitation to sit there, it was as if Sherlock was having some kind of memory.
He had to separate himself from feelings. He couldn't keep up like this. This was stupid, this wasn't him. He wasn't going to spend the rest of his life falling in love over and over and over and always messing it up and blaming himself for it. John Watson was the first and the last case.
Melissa nodded. “He had access to all of it. All the files, all the information, the tapes, everything. It was only logical we’d think he’d be the first suspect.”
“Yes. We did our research. Well, apparently is a place which helps you forget someone. It just deletes it from the patient’s memory. Just like that.”
Sherlock sighed and walked towards the kitchen to make some tea. John stood there, his head bent down, eyes closed.
Mike bit his lip. “Right, so, my exhibition at the gallery was extended for two months more after the reception”, he said with a smile.
"I'll come back tomorrow, okay? Have some food, you need to recover the energy you've lost." Sarah said, saying goodbye to John and waving a hand at Sherlock and Greg before leaving the door closed.
Sherlock’s fingers remained over John’s lips, touching the soft skin, leaning closer as if it was a study on human lips and their shapes, on human lips and their colors, on human lips and their textures.
“Yeah”, John said after examining her. “She died at some point between around 1 a.m. and 3 a.m. The cause of death was blood loss.”
John knew Sherlock was lying. He was an expert liar. He could act like he didn't care at all, but John knew better than that. John knew Sherlock denied the truth and that truth was that Sherlock of course
"What did your brother mean with 'the last time'?" The question popped suddenly into John's mind and John needed to
“Yes I liked that too. I used to-”, he grew quiet for a moment, wondering if he should say it or not. He found out he didn’t matter, it was John he was telling it to. “The first time I walked into a museum I asked my mom what a thing on a painting was, and she told me that it was ‘light’ and I looked at the rainbow and I pointed at it and all I said was that it was ‘light’.”
"Of course it is my problem, Sherlock! You are my brother! You can't imagine how Mrs Hudson was after she found out you were gone, you almost gave her a heart attack!"
When he got out to the reception, he realized Sarah was focused, reading a newspaper, which she closed quickly as soon as John approached her, but left laying on the desk.
He waited a few seconds, trying to hide the tremor in his hands, willing his lungs to find some air because he was definitely not panicking and he wasn't having flashbacks to that day.
John barely touched his food, he wasn't hungry anymore, the anger was bigger. Somehow, sitting there just made things worse, he couldn't stop thinking about the fight, he was so hurt.
John finished adding the white, and outlined the edges with a sharp and thin brush -not with ivory black, apparently-. Sherlock didn’t listen to most of what he said, and instead spent most of the time wondering how it was possible that John could make this kind of work of art. He was amazed, to say the least. He would never admit it, of course.
"Really? You don't say." Mycroft said sarcastically, then he turned to look at John, he lifted his eyebrow and then frowned, as questioning what the hell was a boy like John hanging out with a guy like Sherlock.
John stood up really angry (and he still didn't know what about) looked at Mike and said forcefully "I just need to get some air."
Sebastian gave a loud laughter looking at John. "Oh, Holmes, you better hurry. Your boyfriend is waiting for you."
She took a deep breath. "It's alright dear, but if you do it again, I'll slap you in the face." She said with a small smile.
He stored in his mind palace every single detail about the painting, the place of each and every circle, the moment when red turned into orange, and orange into yellow but not quite. He stored the brushstrokes, the thin frame surrounding it. It still smelled a bit, and Sherlock felt a deep desire to touch it, to understand it, to feel the paint below his fingertips.
Sherlock stood silent at that, he knew that when it came to John and colors…he was certainly the expert.
They were both broken because Serbia and Afghanistan and Lacuna and lies and hate and pain and death and fake death stood in their way. And Sherlock
John closed his eyes and frowned, as if forcing his own brain to remember, as if trying to look somewhere for the memory, but he couldn't find it. He grimaced and Sherlock felt it was physically painful to see him trying so hard to remember when three months ago he had tried so hard to forget.
The liquid slowly fell onto his vein, it was a pleasure seeing it descending descendo descending and reaching his skin, penetrating the deepest labyrinths of his body.
Sherlock tried to think and convince himself it wasn't true. "Well, that's his problem, not mine. See you later." He sighed.
He looked at Sherlock, who was now in the kitchen, waiting for breakfast to be served. "Are you sure you are going to be okay?"
On their first class together, Sherlock had told him he thought of the body as a musical composition.
for him? Of course not. And that's why not kissing him was the best choice, because he was drunk and he wasn't thinking properly and in that state anyone would have seemed suitable for the greaser.
Sherlock left without throwing one last look at John. As soon as he closed the door, he leaned his back against the door and sighed, rubbing his eyes. He did feel exhausted, but as usual, he tended to ignore it. His whole body seemed to be screaming now to get some rest.
Sherlock followed him, not quite wanting to catch up to his pace, so he simply walked behind. John followed him silently, the creases in his forehead more pronounced, certainly because of his worry. Their fingers were still intertwined. Sherlock felt the need to caress John’s fingers just to reassure him that he was okay -which wasn’t true- but he refrained from doing it.
Sherlock shook the thought away and focused on helping John, he gathered all his strength while the doctor struggled to move his legs, which were still hanging in the air.
Yes, John realized it was for the best. He had to stop this, all of this, he had to pull the band-aid off. Painfully but quickly. Now or never. Sherlock looked at him and frowned. "Really? Why not?" God, he was still unaware, he seriously didn't know.
"I don't see a reason to refer to you, my work partner, as just Sherlock. I think it's better to stick with Holmes"
Not for now. He couldn't go back to that hellhole called Rehab and he knew that his brother wouldn't fail his word. Too much was at stake and it wasn't worth it.
"You know what? I'm going to sleep, you deal with Moriarty by yourself, do as you wish, tell whoever you want. Good night." John stood up and left to his room. Sherlock stood in there for another half hour, thinking over and over again. He felt so much fault, so much pain. He didn't know how to make it up to John, he really had been a terrible friend, he didn't deserve a best friend like John Watson.
The first sentence was Afghanistan or Iraq, the last sentence was Oh God I can only hope that is enough for both of us.
John turned away, “I knew this was just another one of your jokes”. He was about to walk out the door when Sherlock turned.
"Oh God stop it, stop this and tell me right now what is happening! Because something is wrong Sherlock Holmes! Don't you dare telling me it isn't because it is,
He opened the door wider. As soon as he did, John looked at him up and down. Sherlock felt embarrassed. He looked terrible. He had his pajama bottoms and his dressing gown and that old brown t-shirt he used to wear when he got high. He’d worn the same clothes the whole day, he hadn’t felt up to putting anything else on.
He closed his eyes, but he still couldn't stop shivering and sweating, his brain seemed to be turning off and on again and again. "What happened?" He heard a voice in front of him saying, a voice bending down to look at him better. He opened one of his eyes and John Watson was standing right there above him, talking to someone else. He looked so real, the most real Sherlock had ever seen him. "No, you're not real! You're not here! Get out of my mind! Get the fuck out!" He said desperately, or perhaps he didn't, he wasn't in control of his mouth anymore. "I don't want to hurt you, leave me. Just leave. I-I love you. Leave."
He couldn’t explain what was that he felt, he couldn’t put a name into what it was, what they were, he simply couldn’t explain it. It just was. They just were.
"I want you to solve them. It won't take much legwork, just a lot of investigating on the internet and the such, so your leg will keep healing."
"Sherlock, I just got a call from Molly. I couldn't quite understand her, but apparently John is on the ER."
That caught Sherlock off guard and he tried to come up with a good lie but he couldn't find anything within his brain. John was looking at him expectantly and so Sherlock decided to tell him the truth, just not all of it, he had told John enough lies. He explained that there were serial murders and the thing they had in common was a weird scar in the back of their heads. John didn't need to know he had it too, he'd probably never find it out. It was out of his field of view, so that was an advantage. He raised his eyebrows at Sherlock's story and smiled softly, encouraging him to go on.
"What is it about?" Sherlock finally gave up, rolling his eyes. He really hated asking his brother for help.
"Until I met you." Sherlock said, still not looking up. His face hid a trace of wonderment mixed with fear.
They chatted for a while, John told him that Sherlock was tutoring him on improving his drawing skills (of course, that was all he was going to say on the topic), if Mike noticed anything, he didn’t mention it (thankfully), but as soon as they finished talking about it, Mike simply said, “I’m glad you’re working on getting better, because I want to propose you something.”
He stopped a cab with a shalking hand, and as it went to Scotland Yard, he looked at the last messages he had received. They were from John.
And Sherlock leaned closer, so close John could almost feel his lips, and his hands were cupping his face again and he missed that hold so much, he was becoming addicted to it, and he could do nothing but close his eyes. And he wanted to let go.  But then he remembered Hikes' wise words: make the right choice, but which one was it? "
Irene, as usual, was right. John was inside his car, but wasn't turning it on. Sherlock couldn't see quite well what he was doing, but something was wrong. He felt an impulse of going to John's car and saying he was sorry and he loved him and not Irene and...shit.
Greg nodded and smiled reassuringly. "No, no." He said shaking his head. "It's just... We hadn't talked in a very long time."
Sherlock sighed in relief. “Yes”, no he wasn’t. His head was hurting but he wanted to stop seeing that worried expression in John’s eyes.
He did so, pouring his everything into the kiss, as if he was somehow making it up for all the things Sherlock went through, as if his mere existence, as if his mere presence was not enough, more than enough.
John stood in front of the door, his fists clenched and his jaw set. He nodded. He walked towards him slowly, as if he was in a minefield, and he felt like each step could be his last. Finally, he stood in front of Sherlock.
Sherlock sighed, stared at John’s hand and debated for a moment whether to shake it back or not. He finally decided on doing it. As soon as he did, John flinched and rubbed his eyes.
Almost all the class had already left and Sherlock still didn’t look up. Hikes came to them with a smile on his face. “Well done, yours was the best draft. Keep up the good job.”
John took a deep breath. Of course, of all dates he had to choose this particular day to deliver the projects.
When he got to his car he felt a huge impulse to turn on the radio, close himself on his "rocket" and drown his feelings with Tchaikovsky, Beethoven or Bach... He turned on the radio and... shit. Rock n' roll. Rock n' fucking roll playing incredibly loud and a thousand memories passed by John's head, and he was so angry and he just started punching the passenger's seat because that's where Sherlock sat and turned off the radio but rock n' roll was still invading his mind and he just kept punching and punching and punching. He wasn't feeling better now.
"Yes you're fine", he honestly had no reasons to doubt in her and had to admit that he actually kind of liked her. "I just know that it'll be easier for you to cooperate than for the rest of the staff."
Sherlock didn’t reply. John cleared his throat. He wanted to leave. Immediately. On the other hand…he wanted to meet this man, get to know him. Why? He had absolutely no idea, he wished he could understand him.
Sherlock thought. John had mentioned his sister the day before, as he talked about Elvis, except he forgot to mention that a.She was a girl and b. She liked girls.
John closed the newspaper and eyed the folders with a frown. "What's that?", he asked, a bit sharply.
"Oh, so I'm stubborn, I'm a stupid greaser, I'm a douchebag, what else am I, according to you?" Sherlock said frowning at John.
John smiled back because he didn't know what else to say, he was just so happy and thankful that Sherlock was right next to him, and supporting him and understanding him and it was good. It was better than good, it was great.
“I actually do mind”, Sherlock replied. “Which is why I got you a palette”, he said as he walked and stopped in front of the canvas, taking something from behind the tripod stand.
John buried himself beneath the covers in embarrassment and looked at her with puppy eyes. "Just give me ten minutes more,
"Murder!"- Sherlock said after being quiet for almost an hour in which he had stood looking at the window, thinking. Harry jumped, he hadn't said a word since the woman had left. Horror drew in her face.
He was about to fall asleep when Sherlock turned and faced him. John opened his eyes and looked at him. Sleeping deeply, looking so relaxed and calmed, this was a view he could get used to. He looked perfect. His face was lit by the tiny glimpses of the street lights entering through the window. John took a moment to appreciate Sherlock's face. He caught everything he could with his eyes. And there was so much silence, all he could hear was the sound of Sherlock's breath.
Mycroft sighed. "You think I have the answers to everything, Sherlock. I'm sorry to disappoint you, dear brother, but in this case I don't."
Of course she wouldn’t be. A killer like this would long for a sense of continuation, of completion. They didn’t randomly chose to start with the letter ‘E’, no, there had to be and a,b,c,d first.
"I didn't know you had been so...affected by it." Apparently they were not done talking about it yet. This conversation was making Sherlock uncomfortable.
There were so many things that Sherlock could have said, so many things that he could have asked, but he couldn't find the strength to do it, not without probably saying
He heard a voice behind his back and turned to look at the girl he had seen that morning in front of him. Irene. She was now wearing a dress that highlighted her features. She was smiling and she handed Sherlock the cup. He took it.
Sherlock looked at him, and spoke softly. "Nothing. Anything. I've been thinking about it all day, I know nothing about it. I don't like not knowing."
John rubbed the back of his head, “erm- can I come in? It’s just- it’s a little bit cold in here”, he said, rubbing his hands together.
They had all been stabbed. Which was honestly an ineffective way to die. So this killer, whoever it was, had psychopathic tendencies, for they enjoyed the pain, enjoyed the suffering and enjoyed seeing a slower death than if they were killed at gunpoint.
Sherlock stood up from the table immediately and retreated to his room without saying another word, feeling a knot on his throat, thinking that maybe his brother would be right for once.
John finally turned to look at him. “Oh, you’re sorry? Now you’re sorry! Fucking hell, Sherlock! How can you be so reckless with yourself? How can you attempt against your own life in that way? Do you really not care? It’s the same if you fucking live or if you die?”
John wished he could be. He couldn’t bring himself to. As he stared at his old studio he remembered everything he used to be and felt the weight of time crashing against him.
Mycroft recalled his brother’s warning before the fall. “It’s imperative that John not be told. He must be seen grieving, or they’ll kill him, Mycroft. You know they will. I cannot allow that to happen. You must keep him safe while I’m away. He’ll… need help. And I don’t just mean money. You’ll need to check, see that he’s doing all right. Whether or not this works, whether or not I survive, it will be very difficult for him.” And finally, Sherlock’s last text to him before disappearing from Britain’s CCTV system for the following two years: I have your word that you’ll watch over him. I will hold you to it. For now, goodbye. SH.
"Cor, John…" He murmured looking shocked and very worried. "Are you sure that you want to do that? It's not too late to change your mind. You're a qualified physician and the RAMC would snap you up in a heartbeat."
"You didn't see it." Greg whispered unable to keep the tremor out of his voice or hide the haunted look in his eyes. Her eyes narrowed and she snapped.
