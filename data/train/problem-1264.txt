“That is not my intention at all, and you know it,” I shot back. Now that I had truly committed to my proposal, I was quite clear at least within myself—I knew what I wanted. “Come sit here on my lap.”
“You falsely reported the death of your wife!” Mrs. Bloom’s face was turning an unbecoming, blotchy red.
“It’s about time they sacked her,” the blonde woman added a bit sharply, pouring some milk into his teacup. “It’s the third time she’s done it in six weeks.” She handed him the tea cup.
Sherlock apparently believed that his brother had come to “see us off” and so was perfectly amenable to all three of us getting into a brougham with our bags. I had, at one point, dashed down to explain to Mrs. Hudson what was occurring, so she saw us off, stating quite honestly that she would be delighted to take the opportunity to give our rooms a good cleaning and Sherlock of course objecting to disturbing his “dust index.” I had promised her that I would send regular letters.
And when the insolent creature performed his meretricious act with our poker, my only concern was to get him out of our sitting-room and out of our house. I was astounded that Sherlock maintained his somewhat amused demeanour throughout the encounter.
It was someone he liked—that part was right. He knew whoever it was only meant it for his own good. That felt rather nice.
“Sherlock, stop that.” He looked down at his brother, who was standing up against him with his face hidden on his shoulder, whimpering softly. “You don’t have to sleep in the bed if it frightens you.” He considered what to do. “How about this? Would you like to sleep on the sofa in my bedroom instead?”
The nurse had ensured that Sherlock had had a bath; that his hair was clean. He had had a haircut and a shave over the weekend—an actual barber had appeared to tend to that—did people really do that anymore? Apparently, yes. And then carefully dressed him in the too-large shirt; the too-long but elegant trousers. The ever-texting assistant had procured insanely expensive shoes, and his patient had allowed him to slide dress socks and the new shoes onto the ridiculously large feet. Quite a difference from their previous trip to the hospital, for which the thin man had been clothed in a track suit of his brother’s and borrowed trainers.
“Mrs. Hudson, how old are you?” I burst out. There was a moment of silence. I could feel my cheeks burning with embarrassment. “I am so very sorry!” I exclaimed. “Please, please accept my apologies—”
So, that was how he was so easily able to quote chapter and verse so aptly applicable to the situation. I should have realised that he would have prepared himself. This also explained the thicker-than-usual smoke in our drawing room that morning. Then something occurred to me. “You do know that quoting from the Bible could have led to either of the Blooms quoting right back at us. I doubt the outcome of our conversation would have been quite so... gratifying if they had brought up—”
Mycroft, dressed and with wet, combed back hair, exited the room. When Winifred saw his suit, she seemed surprised. “You’re going to work?” she challenged.
“Yes,” he said carefully, his keen eyes raking across the space between the unhappy couple. “For whilst I am heartened to hear that Mrs. Bloom strives so mightily to avoid immoral behaviours, I am struck by the fact that she is lying.”
Sherlock also took advantage of this time to swiftly explain to Miss Stoner what had occurred—and it was then that he revealed that he had formed his suspicions about the imminent danger to anyone inhabiting that bed as soon as he had seen the dog-lash and the marks showing that Roylott stood on the chair.
I admit now that I have no idea to what we listened, nor of my own reaction to it. I was focused so much more on my companion. I would glance over at him furtively, to view his unique profile in the dim gaslight.
Nothing else in the way of normal pursuits, the way she told it, in fact. You were clearly not engaged as a general practitioner of medicine to any great extent. In fact, I heard that your waiting room was often empty for days at a stretch. I most certainly never referred anyone to your services, nor did anyone with whom I was acquainted.
As she was with everything pertaining to the running of the house, she was direct and firm with each applicant. The first had been terrified by this, for some reason—and I really do not understand this because I can discern the difference between firm and stern—and of course would not have lasted five minutes under our roof.
The scowl turned into a frown of bafflement. “What do you mean? I’ve had presents from everyone I know and a great number of people I don’t know.” He gestured toward Greg’s gift to him—a book about forensic psychology.
“So, the reason they do not have children is... no marital relations. How does he convince Mrs. Bloom to refrain?
“You are a great idiot. Left arm, please.” I continued scrubbing him, perhaps a bit more firmly than was entirely necessary. I took a good look at his hand. “Wait one moment.” I dashed out of the bath-room and into his bedroom to retrieve his nail-brush, waving it triumphantly when I returned. “Go on,” I prodded as I began to clean the fingernails of his left hand.
For it had just occurred to him—if their little “game” was revealed, who would be the more humiliated? There was no denying that he had been pretty out of it when the others had arrived. They knew that Victor tended to control what he took—often dosing him too heavily or withholding, depending on his mood and Sherlock’s need; it wouldn’t be the first time he had given him too much. So, if his naked body, tied with what were undeniably Victor’s own ties, was revealed—and it would only take a twitch of the duvet—would they think for one moment that he had voluntarily gotten himself into that situation?
“Because that is what I do not understand! it is just my body—it is a tool; nothing more. It allows me to move about—to gather information. It is not… when I am working, it is not… it is not the same as when we are together in that other way. It is not the same thing
Had he…? A sudden image of sheets of staff paper propped on the stand and a pencil in his hand. Yes, that seemed right, too—playing a few bars, then pausing to make some adjustments to his composition. It might have looked a bit tedious to anyone observing him, but to him, the process was what he found enthralling. As he worked out the individual notes and passages, he would become more and more focused and able to tune out the overwhelming data that constantly threatened to drown him.
I kissed the delicate shell of his ear. “Highest marks, my love,” I whispered into it. I thought I was finally in the clear, and that our horrid conversation was over.
I was relieved when he rallied himself upon catching sight of the old manor-house and encountering our client at the entrance to the foot-path. I believe that he was buoyed by our client’s coming out to meet us. She had proven to us that morning and again when she appeared that she was truly brave and eager to take an active role in understanding her situation. Indeed, as he climbed the stile, he seemed quite his usual energetic self, and he grinned a bit wickedly as he described how we had made the horrible man’s acquaintance.
His older brother seated himself gingerly next to him. “I am sorry about all this,” he remarked, almost to himself (he wasn’t sure if his brother was comprehending, listening, or even aware of his presence). “I know that you want to go home—back to… everything. But surely, Sherlock, you do understand that that must be handled with the utmost care.”
I could stand this no more. I rose and went to him, wrapping my arms around him. He had lost weight—I had only been away for a fortnight, but I knew his habits and I was sure that other than coffee and tea, little had passed his lips since my departure.
As always, Sherlock was not at all modest, barely noticing when the last layer—pants so worn they were really just a waistband and a memory—had been carefully lowered. He allowed his brother to steady him as he stepped into the tub, first gasping at the touch of the hot water, then slowly lowering himself down into it with a sigh of contentment.
“I was not! I did not intend to be…” his rancour, which had surfaced so suddenly, just as suddenly disappeared.
Not raising his head, he pointed at his own desk. I stepped over to it and searched first its cluttered top, and then opened the top drawer. There it was. He had gotten it as far as being in an envelope and addressing it to me at my hotel before apparently changing his mind about sending it along. “May I?” I asked formally.
Indeed, as I write this, I realise how very good he was to me about the entire debacle. He was attentive and concerned and calmed me several times when my fears threatened to overtake my mind. Even though my relationship with him was the impetus for the matter, I did not blame him, and I still do not regret one minute of our association. In fact, the way he has been acting since this incident makes all the turmoil worthwhile.
Solomon now crept back into the room warily. Winifred was seated on the sofa next to their patient and was speaking in a soothing voice to the impossibly pale man while casually taking his pulse. He was taking hitching, gasping breaths and shaking.
Mrs Parker congratulated herself later when she did not point out that the nurse, who was plump to the point of being dumpy, did not seem to have terribly healthy eating habits, either. “It doesn’t matter how ‘healthy’ or good the food is for him if he won’t eat it or worse—if it just ends up in the toilet.”
“It’s an A to Zed map of London,” John explained as Greg craned his head, attempting to see. “A thousand pieces.”
are tedious,” I reassured him, tipping my head a bit so I could kiss his ear. “That I sometimes become distracted from those tasks
“I do know that,” he snapped. “But we simply cannot continue the way things have been going. My brother will continue to attempt escape until he succeeds—and simply letting him out there with no protection—no plan—would be beyond foolish. We must gain control of the situation.”
“I have been trying so very hard,” he managed, his voice low. He was clearly chagrined about whatever had occurred.
I had been managing to remain as calm as I possibly could until then. Had the frightful creature recalled this? Is this why she had chosen this particular location for our meeting?
“The sight of Miss Stoner’s injuries in particular seemed to distress you,” I remarked with some dread.
“What is it, Sherlock?” Mycroft asked in some amazement. He had headed up to check on his brother as soon as he had come in from his office, and his brother seemed eager for his attention. The last time he had acted anything like that he had been about ten years old and eager to show his older brother, whom he idolised, the results of an experiment he had been running. The government man—whose hearing was quite as good as Sherlock’s—had heard the conversation between the nurses, of course, but had shrugged it off. What they thought of him didn’t matter. He had sent the new nurse down to discuss Sherlock’s eating needs with Mrs Parker before entering his brother’s room.
I shall finish this and my drink and creep into our bed so that I can hold him and assure myself that he is well and will not allow him to go off on his own again.
It was when his attention started to lag that she miscalculated. She had glanced at her watch and realised that the night nurse would be arriving in less than an hour. So, it was now or never.
The head injury had seemed to affect his coordination; sometimes when he lashed out against an intruding hand or instrument, he would miss—although some of that had to do with his current lack of binocular vision. The most apparent issue was his lack of balance; a nurse kept close whenever he was on his feet, as he tended to list to the left.
What the fuck was he doing? He slammed himself against the wall, away from the opening. Idiot. That’s how they got you.
“So, is it any wonder that, having already been rather more than a bit keen that morning, observing you as you threw that lovely body of yours into those most fantastic positions, I felt my desire rising again?”
But now, in the calm after the storm, I can state with honesty that I understand Mary’s actions when accosted by that odious woman in the theatre lobby. As soon as she realised that she could not deny her identity, what bravery she demonstrated by being so forthright!  I am also certain that her honesty with Mrs. Bloom would not ever have been offered had she the slightest hint of what the woman would do with the information.
He was not an idiot. He knew who “Big Brother” was. In fact, he came to the large house on such a regular basis to ensure that the government man was trim and tidy that they had installed a proper chair in one of the endless bedrooms. He also tended to several of the silent, black-clothed assistants there, and even the gardener and the chauffeur. He was paid a rather embarrassingly large amount for all of it—but it wasn’t even just an implication that he keep it all completely quiet. He had signed something—it had been ages ago—to ensure his silence, and he was just fine with that, because how could he possibly have explained it all—and who would he tell?
explanations, you not only made it clear that I must accompany my friend today, but you gave me quite a treasure-trove of information about yourself.
The water was deliciously cool and the bottom of the pond soft against my bare feet, and then I caught up with Sherlock just as it got deep enough for him to throw himself onto his back with a great splash.
working,” I interrupted, pointing to her feather duster, which she had, simultaneously with her talk, been rigorously employing among the myriad objects collected on our sitting-room mantle. She has an amazing felicity for cleaning things without disturbing them. Not that the efforts of our dear friend are any less, but she prefers to shift things about a bit whilst cleaning. She says that it is to check that nothing has got stuck onto the mantle.
Through determination—and thinking about Sherlock’s most recent experiment, which had involved him determining exactly how long it took for bits of flesh (in this case, pork) to become maggot-and-insect-ridden, reeking, disgusting messes whilst in different situations (covered, uncovered, and so on)—I somehow managed to get myself under control, dressed, and into our sitting room, where the obvious duress of our client wiped the last vestiges of my predicament from my head—for the moment, anyway.
I prodded my darling awake as she left us. He grumbled and fussed, but I bestowed several kisses on his beautiful face before sliding out from under the bedclothes and slipping through the connecting door to my own room to dress—and thank heavens for that door, for it would hardly have been seemly for us to emerge from the same bedroom, and in our nightclothes.
I did not sleep well. I awoke several times, always to the sound of Sherlock tossing and turning; getting the bedclothes in a hopeless tangle. Sometimes I could hear him whimpering; he was desperate for sleep, but it would not come. I debated rising and giving him something to help.
He liked the crayons. They were just like the ones that Daddy got him, except they were all out of order. He fixed that as he considered what to draw.
That did it. He pushed a bit rudely past Lilly to join Mrs Parker, taking her hand and tugging her towards the stairs. The nurse followed in some astonishment.
‘Lock hummed as Big Brother helped him stand up (he had been sitting on a little stool; it was funny that Big Brother’s bathroom was so large that he had furniture in it). But now his brother was pulling his filthy jumper up and his nearly shredded jeans down and that felt good because they were still a bit damp from his accident and he had been worried that he would be in trouble but no one had shouted at him about it so far. He looked placidly down at his body. A bath would be nice.
And then… it was confusing, because now instead of leaning up against her soft shoulder and looking at the pictures in his book he found his face being pressed into… that wasn’t okay, was it? He didn’t like it one bit. There were mounds of flesh being pushed into his face and they were too big and he could smell the washing powder she used and he didn’t like it and he didn’t like having his face so close to that part of her and he had pushed her away as hard as he could.
It didn’t matter one bit how much they spent, did it? Not when they were using Mycroft’s credit card, which Sherlock had “liberated” from his pocket.
It took some time to get him to eat what they considered a reasonable amount. The nurse had politely accepted a bowl of the soup (it turned out to be delicious), so the housekeeper had filled one for her, one for herself, and then a smaller one—a saucer, really—for him. She presented him with a teaspoon. “Get your finger out of there,” she had instructed mildly. Guiltily he had withdrawn his finger from his bowl, putting it in his mouth and sucking off the thick, creamy soup.
I was even more surprised when the door separating our sitting room from the hallway opened—no one had knocked. I rose hurriedly, dropping my journal, alarmed at this intrusion.
Sherlock gave him a small smile and tore them open. “What… oh. These are rather intriguing,” he admitted. “Look.” He held up two colourful boxes so Greg could see.
“But…” His voice was tight and I detected the slightest tremble in his thin frame. “I cannot fathom why my activities during an investigation would lead you to… it just makes no sense.”
“He drugged you and tried to escape,” Mycroft summed up efficiently. “He is now livid, locked in his room, and most assuredly injuring himself. I am loath to say this, but perhaps he requires some assistance calming down?”
I frowned. This was, as she said, unexpected, but I still could not discern the nature of her indiscretion. “This does not seem quite a disaster,” I remarked in puzzlement.
Today was not a bit different that I can determine. I am at a loss as to explain what occurred just a few hours ago.
Sherlock made quick work of it and nearly squealed in delight. “A doctor kit!” he crowed. “I can be just like Doctor Daddy! Can I… I can take care of my bee and my bear. Thank you, Daddy!”
I was not the least bit surprised, but I did sigh in some exasperation. He can be so very stubborn sometimes. “Very well. Then I will tell you what they said.”
And then, with a heart-breaking wail of despair, he thrust himself at the windows, the blanket slipping from his slender body as he lifted his hands up and slammed them onto the glass.
“Come sit down,” she rather commanded, taking a seat herself and looking quite pointedly at me. I sat and waited; I know that tone in her voice. “I am sorry to hear that Mr. Holmes is still so ill. But tell me now—how are
Despite the fog that was currently creeping over his thought processes, he automatically began to analyse the situation. He pulled up with both arms. He couldn’t move them away from his sides. They were secured to the metal frame that ran under the thin mattress. The tie on his right wrist was particularly tight; his hand was already going numb.
The mattress was dropped back into place and he felt his arm being pulled. He tried to raise it and found that he couldn’t.
“It’s wrapped up. We hit him pretty hard with pain killers—on his brother’s orders—and then it was the most bizarre thing. If I hadn’t been here before, I wouldn’t believe it. It was just… over.”
Yes, Mycroft could see it—a wicked, bruised and oozing area marring the thin layer of flesh. It was red and looked hot and inflamed. “He’s taking antibiotics, is he not?” he inquired. “Won’t they take care of that?”
“Has she?” I asked a bit duplicitously. I knew it to be a fact, and I knew that my darling had been spending time with our landlady—reading or talking or I know not what—but it was time that previously had not been available to her when she was so burdened with all the tasks required for tending to our rather odd household.
“How do you know that?” I realised the connection between the crime scene we had been examining and his decidedly untidy pursuits.
Oh, yes, I do know—I can hear him now, pointing out that I am hardly dull or ordinary. How many English doctors have multiple bullet wounds and impressive scars? How many carry a revolver? How many are perfectly willing to bend and break the law in the pursuit of the truth? How many men not only do not flinch at that thought of tests for human blood but express their admiration and awe?
“So I aware, more than you, of the progression of her illness.” And then the stern, stiff façade broke. “Sherlock,” he begged, “she was so different before you were born. She had moments of… unsteadiness… but far more times of calmness. Of happiness.”
So, her first glimpse of the familiar dark curls both thrilled and saddened her. She already knew that his stay would be more of the latter type than the former; the crowd of medical personnel that had paraded into the second-best sitting room had not been encouraging. But now they were done, and she had been more than a bit surprised when he had appeared in the kitchen with a nurse in tow—literally.
Dimly, I could hear Sherlock’s distinct voice as he exclaimed about one thing or another. It became much clearer as he and Mr. Harper emerged from the house, and I did not need to open my eyes to know that the detective was as eagerly throwing himself upon his face amongst the flowers and hedges as he had been amongst the legs of the dining table. He was chattering on about indentations on the lawn and a broken latch on the window and scuff marks on the window-sill.
It was mid-August, and my dream had been somewhat prescient, as the day was turning out to be positively sultry. Although Sherlock was dressed in his usual frock coat, with a light grey silk waistcoat, crisp white collar and cuffs, and black tie, I had chosen one of my lightest suits. Our client—a Mr. Charles Harper—was attired similarly to me.
“Well, I’ve considered the average time it takes to walk from the closest Tube station, how closely the intervals coincide with typical meeting times—you tell someone 'I’ll see you at seven’ or ‘eight-fifteen’, never ‘twenty-one minutes past two’—even how often that dreadful music loop repeats.”
“I cannot deny that, but surely I am not the only husband who cannot tell a radish from a rose.” I earned a sly smile from Sherlock at this nicety.
He raised his eyebrows and inclined his head slightly towards me. My mind raced on. “So...” I began slowly, “the paradox observed in the Bloom household is that, when Mrs. Bloom is away, the deliveries remain unchanged?”
John Watson sighed and shoved his mobile into his jacket pocket. With everything that had been going on—constant cases and increasingly intrusive media coverage—he’d barely even begun holiday preparations beyond deciding that they would
back. He had no idea how or when that had happened. Where had he been? He frowned, unable to recall…
of us of practicing perversions that will most certainly bring us to trial and probably put us in prison.”
Forewarned is forearmed. I knew how the draught sometimes affected him. I had laid a towel on the bed and positioned a clean pot next to it. Upon observing my precautions, Mycroft, who had been standing stiffly, his back against the windows, while we tended to his brother, finally spoke up.
After his few words—and his admonishment to his brother—Sherlock had finished his dinner, smiling guilelessly as he polished off his last chip. As he had eaten everything with his fingers, he had managed to get himself rather amazingly greasy.
“Get up,” I ordered as soon as I entered our sitting room. It was stuffy and the pipe smoke was creating a haze that obscured the corners. He sat up, a look of astonishment on his face.
His lip will take somewhat more time to heal; it is cut not only where the villain’s hand abused it but also on the inside, where it struck a tooth. I am relieved that the tooth itself seems sound.
“Mary... Mrs. Watson used to attend to the inmates of the women’s prison,” I offered, sensing the direction in which my love was headed.
“Yes, I have been kept apprised of your efforts, Doctor Watson—and I truly appreciate everything you are doing for my brother. This must be a terrible strain on you.”
It is a testament to the depth of my sorrow that I did not feel the slightest objection to her accusation, but I did attempt to clarify my position. “I am not retreating, my dear lady,” I informed her. “He does not currently desire my presence.”
“It’s fresh butter, and Mrs Hudson has outdone herself with this bread—it really is a bit of heaven. Sit down and have some.” (I was already in the habit of addressing him at times as a truculent child.)
Sure enough, the peculiar, light-coloured eyes now opened, and his brother made an angry, frustrated noise as he tried raising his head.
His decisive way of securing the viper (and in my original manuscript of this story, I correctly quoted the detective as naming the serpent a
Finally, snakes do not drink milk. Monkeys do not, either—I am still somewhat at a loss to explain the presence of that bowl in my stepfather’s bedroom, but now believe that it was the remains of a soothing dish of bread and milk—my stepfather, likely due to his own temperament, frequently suffered from stomach pain, and such a dish would be calming. As the housekeeper left her position the day after my stepfather’s funeral, I did not have the opportunity to inquire.
He was nowhere in evidence. My heart was beating so hard that my chest hurt. I spun and immediately saw that the door to his bedroom was shut. I lunged across the room and jerked it open.
I closed the door and sat her down, then sat down myself. I did not wish to be intimidating in any manner. “Please tell me what you have been experiencing,” I said simply.
“You have certainly been needed to apply your skills in rather urgent circumstances on some of your cases,” Mr. Bloom blurted out. I was surprised that he did not burst into flames from the look his wife gave him.
“Does it bother me that we are breaking the law?” I suggested. I was delighted to see the slight look of surprise on his face. For once I had followed
Dad, who of course had seen right through Mycroft’s overly-detailed explanations about “debriefing,” patted his love’s hand and brushed her hair away from her beautiful, intense eyes. Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock took a few unsteady steps—he was at least moving away from the windows. He was pale—so horribly pale—and I drew myself up, ready to spring off the settee if he showed signs of faltering further.
Sherlock did fairly well with the soldiers of toast covered in the rich, golden melted cheese, and even ate all the apple slices.
“Yes, that occurred to me—in fact, no one else seemed to even imply that it is not a woman who visits.”
“That’s excellent, Sherlock,” Mycroft managed, his throat tight. “It’s even almost all in English.” He offered the paper back to his brother, but he shook his head and pointed at it. “What do you want me to do with it?”
just want him to know that he’s safe. I’ll take care of the lotion. Thank you, sir.” He slipped back into the darkened room, shutting the door behind himself.
He winced. His lips hurt—he could taste blood on them—but the water felt good going down his parched throat and he drank about half of the glass before he suddenly felt overly full and pulled his head back. The nurse—had she been there the night before? —gently lowered it. “Good job,” she murmured.
Hands on his shoulders prevented him from tumbling onto his face and he found himself sitting on the sofa. He could feel his heart pounding and he was having a hard time catching his breath—why? What had happened? He had been… what had he been doing?
And when darkness falls, as we have done since prehistory, we retreat to whatever we consider our home—fine house or cottage or slum or even a gypsy caravan—and we fasten all the windows and doors. We lock ourselves in and everyone else out.
“The Blooms? Mm... No. It is extremely unlikely that they will pursue the matter... in fact, I have no doubt that we will never hear from or about Mr. and Mrs. Bloom again.” His hand rested upon my chest still, and I found its steady presence comforting.
, that he knows the liniment is nothing more than macassar oil with some scent infused, so he must not be treating an actual injury but just maintaining the appearance of one. I think that she believes his story about an old injury making it impossible to... fulfil his husbandly duties, and that in her mind, their ‘arrangement’ refers to both of them keeping this information private. So even if it was not the same information they wished to hide, they both had a secret that I threatened to reveal.”
He fell silent and watched as the thin man still seated at his knee considered this and then slowly shook his head. “I just can’t, John,” he admitted, his voice rough. “I can’t remember how.”
“He really does.” He hesitated. He was clearly uncomfortable with what he had to tell her. He took a deep breath. “Listen. He has phases when he acts like a child—almost infantile, sometimes, and sometimes it’s more like a toddler, and sometimes it’s maybe five or six years old. We’ve just been going with it—read to him, or whatever he seems to want to do. He’s got picture books and crayons.”
“John,” he said—and his voice had a bit of that “must I explain this to an idiot” tone— “I am hardly in a respectable line of work. I consort freely with people from all walks of life, including the very lowest. I have had murderers to tea and been seen dining with prostitutes. I know more about the dirty, unseemly side of the so-called upper class than anyone. Illegitimate heirs traced; secret marriages exposed.
Written in pencil, it appeared to be a list. His brother’s writing sprawled across the paper, slanting down to the right and running off the edge at times, but the format was recognizable. It wasn’t the first list Sherlock had made for his brother and was unlikely to be the last.
Mycroft had watched his brother walk unsteadily down the hall, the annoying nurse walking too closely to him, nearly tripping him as they approached the stairs. He was tired and hungry and wanted a shower and a glass or four of merlot and to pass out cold on his bed
“He’s criticised the curtains, the wallpaper, my eel pie, and the new style of hat. Every time I go up there, he’s just lying on those cushions in front of the fire, smoking his pipe and complaining.” Her tone was a bit sharp.
[The doctor had apparently numbered the small stack of notes; each had been written on a half sheet of high-quality stationery and folded over. The following is the first note.]
“I’m not supposed to leave until the next nurse comes in.” She finally seemed to be processing the situation and picked it up slowly.
It was the next day, and I had been called out for my medical service immediately following breakfast, served by our new servant (and, I admit, consumed with something less than enthusiasm by both of us). I had returned in the early afternoon, hungry and wondering if lunch would be better than breakfast had been. I heard movement in the kitchen and rather than ascending to our rooms, I walked down to see how (if) she was managing. The sight that greeted me was not at all what I expected.
He sighed. He was stretched out upon my bed, watching me keenly as I drew my clothes out of my valise and put them away. He had been curled around my case, on his side, but now he gracefully rolled onto his back and, dropping his head over the edge of the mattress, continued to observe me, now upside-down.
“Yes, it has, actually,” his housekeeper confirmed. “He’s upstairs with that handsome nurse—Solomon. The new nurse will be coming on in a bit, and I was just going to start on dinner.”
“In here,” she called back. I found her in her sitting room, a grim expression on her face. “I take it you encountered Helen on her way out,” she began without preamble.
John let him play with the object for a few minutes, during which he discovered that he could make both geometric, symmetric shapes and more abstract ones. He also obviously liked the feel of the smooth wood, as he kept running his fingers over the balls, naming the colours under his breath.
She shook her head. “I didn’t get anything. Listen, have you got him? I want to get going,” Winifred yawned. “It was a long night.”
Really? She read on, keeping one eye on him. He was going through a stack of books now, examining each cover with care. She kept glancing from the clipboard to her patient.
Eventually there had been additional procedures and samples taken—and other, much more invasive examinations. It had taken two nurses to hold him down and a third gently cradling his drawn face in his hands so they could proceed. He had been so terrified during this particular part of the procedure that Mycroft (who could not watch the actual examination directly; he was feeling positively ill at that point) was somewhat astonished that he was still conscious by the end.
“And a great many messes to clean up,” she added. “Not to mention that neither of you can manage anything beyond tea and toast.”
I adore his elegant clothing; the look of his shoulders when he is embraced by shirt and waistcoat and coat. The ripple of taut muscles beneath his fine shirts. The hidden iron strength of his hands and arms. The vibrancy as he strides across a moor and creeps around a room and clambers up a broken staircase still—every time—astounds and thrills me. His deep voice and trim hips—yes.
I followed, protesting. “He does not wish to have visitors,” I attempted to explain. I entered the room and was astonished at the sight. Mycroft Holmes—or whoever he claimed he was—had crossed the room and without preamble seated himself on Sherlock’s bed. He was leaning over the inert figure buried under the covers.
She snorted. “I’ve got five sons and a granddaughter—and a grandson on the way—and if the poor man needs a bit of mothering I am happy to be able to offer it.”
The sight that greeted me as I crossed the threshold of the always-warm room caused me to take in a sudden, shocked breath. Mrs Hudson was seated at the worn work table—not at all an uncommon sight—but instead of being engaged in chopping or peeling something, she sat with her hands clenched into fists in her lap, and one of her legs was propped up on a second chair.
[It is not known if the lady ever did write to the magazine, but no explanation was ever published and the doctor, writing the enclosed piece apparently in reaction to this letter, does not directly address her offer.]
“You have been stiff at an investigation prior to this morning?” His astonishment and outrage were a bit worrying.
“Yes, I can see that. Aren’t you cold?” He glanced around, then rose and retrieved the soft blanket that had made its home in front of the fireplace since his brother’s arrival. “Here.” He draped it carefully over the scarred shoulders. “Where’s… oh.”
aspects of the behaviour he was presenting. She had noted the comments on the clipboard and found them fascinating. That was all it was, really.
It took a few seconds, but then there was a slight fluttering of eyelids and a grunt; the unnerving eyes opened a bit. He licked his dry lips. “Just need some air,” he mumbled.
“What was the point of that diatribe?” This was the first contribution from Mr. Bloom since our desultory discussion of the latest extension of the Underground.
I was mortified at myself for having encouraged his recollections. “Of course,” I assured him. “No more tonight. Can you sleep, do you think?”
“I cannot take it all, of course—I will be able to purchase new clothes in New York,” he murmured, balancing two folded shirts, one in each hand, and examining each closely. He dropped one into the case and dropped the other to the floor. He did not glance in our direction or indicate in any way whatsoever that he was aware of our presence.
kill Julia, in fact. Do you mean—God, Sherlock. Do you mean to tell me that your father…” I could not continue.
“Please do not be alarmed,” Mycroft instructed, holding his hand up. “Despite my absorption in my responsibilities, I have been considering what I stated earlier, and I wish to revise my words.”
“No control whatsoever, even though I do know how hard you try.” This surprised me; was the elder brother attempting to soften the blow of his words?
I do not wish to recall that particular event in my medical career—even if the result had been positive. I had amputated men’s limbs when I was in Afghanistan. I had seen horrors and brutalities there that I have, to this day, been unable to put into words. I have seen the disgusting decay of flesh and bone brought on by syphilis and by “phossy jaw.” I have nursed my own sweetheart through several illnesses that had him, quite literally, at Death’s door.
No, I honestly could say, I could not imagine that. My own upbringing, austere as it was, was still under the same roof as my mother, father, and brother. I knew of households which employed such young children for the coarsest and most base tasks, of course, but when in those large houses, it was rare to encounter these creatures unless Sherlock was interviewing them about a crime. Otherwise, they remained below the stairs.
“You will shout at me. Mrs Hudson shouted at me from downstairs. She said I was to remain in our rooms until you returned.”
Mycroft’s butler and two footmen greeted us at the door, and it took all three of them to get my darling into the house and into what would become our rooms.
“Mrs. Hudson,” I requested when she had made an appearance, “Mr. Holmes is not feeling well. Could you possibly make him some broth?”
However, I realise now my error, and I fear that it may have repercussions for you, far more than for me. I suspect that you will be hearing this from others, as well, but I wished to reach out to you with my apologies.
“Sherlock,” I replied sternly, “I was not certain when we would have this discussion, but apparently, we need to have it now. What do you think happened this morning?”
“Or what? You going to beat us up? Both of us?” The teens in front of him were both taller than him (not that that was much to brag about). They sneered.
“Why were you… let us start at the beginning. Let me.” I moved to perch myself on the edge of the bathtub and put out my hand for the flannel and soap, which he handed over with a sigh. I rubbed them briskly together, creating a lovely-smelling lather, and then began at the top.
“It is perfectly fine, Doctor,” the impeccably-dressed man said rather sharply. “My brother needs me here.”
He felt the edge of the mattress—the side where the fabric was—being lifted up, and then Victor was rummaging about.
The frenzied man, his dark curls covering his eyes, was throwing whatever was at hand as hard as he could. The nurse on duty—Winifred—was rather fearlessly braving the bombardment of hardcover books as she tried to edge closer. The entrance of the two men distracted him—just for a second—and she had lunged at him. She hated using force, but her patient was at risk of injuring himself.
“I’ll do that,” the elder brother had murmured, gesturing for the orange the nurse held. He peeled and segmented it carefully, being sure to remove as much of the pith as he could. His brother detested stringy food. He arranged the segments neatly on the small dish his housekeeper had placed on the table and slid it across the table.
“You reek of smoke,” I commented sternly. “We are going to have a talk, and then you are going to change your clothing.”
It was that last thought that, fortunately, brought me to my senses—at least somewhat. As I considered the possible dire consequences of being revealed, my lust (and there is no other word for it) began to gradually diminish, just as ice cream in its dainty dish slowly loses its shape and texture when left out.
How could I have done that? It had been hours, and I was literally running through the streets, needing to be back to our rooms and to him. What had I done? What had he done? He had admitted to me that he did not wish to continue living and I had left him. I was the worst person in the world. I tore up the stairs—seventeen steps, my brain unhelpfully supplied.
“Yeah. The balls are connected, and you can manipulate them any way you want. There’s a video on YouTube. It’ll Keep your hands busy—keep you out of trouble.”
John switched the kettle off and poured the boiling water over the tea bag already in place. Not exactly a proper brew-up, he knew, but that was the way he did it.
“Yes. That’s it.” She withdrew a delicate handkerchief from her reticule and dabbed discreetly at her lips.
The truth is that I do not truly understand it myself. I do not associate it with any particular or general memory of my own childhood. My mother might have held me in her lap when I was very young, but I have no specific recall of it, and my father most certainly never indulged either of us boys in such a way.
“Most assuredly. It might not always be… the kindest route, but he can be kept safe from himself whilst in this state.”
“Your brother’s been… erm… drawing, all day. You should probably take a look,” the nurse provided quietly.
“Oh, Sherlock,” he muttered. “What have you done now?” He strode quickly across the meticulous lawn.
“She did not seem to understand the meaning of the word ‘clean’,” she sniffed. “My instructions were clear, but she chose to interpret them in a manner I found unsatisfactory.”
A while later, I hesitantly knocked on his door. “Holmes, I’m going to dress now. Are you all right?”
When he was done, he carefully made his way to the library on the ground floor. Solomon followed. He browsed along the full shelves, occasionally removing a book. He stacked them on the table—there was a round table of heavy oak with four chairs around it—wobbling back and forth across the room unsteadily.
I nodded. “They did not have any children when I was acquainted with them. I presume from your statement they still do not.”
There, as I so often did, I assisted him in changing to his nightclothes before undressing myself. I got him to slide across the mattress, but was dismayed when instead of reclining, he sat stiffly against the headboard. Finally, I crawled under the bedclothes myself. “Lie down, darling,” I whispered. “I have been longing to hold you, if you will allow me.” He nodded and stiffly arranged himself on his pillow. “No,” I reprimanded, gently. “Come lie here in my arms. You seem cold. Can I warm you?”
And now it was mostly one face. One person kept surfacing, over and over. And sometimes the name would float up and he could even speak it, and then it would sink down again. And he felt that fixing the name to the face; to keeping both firm and real in his mind; to retaining that name and that face—that person—in every detail, was terribly important.
“Oh, my dear Mrs. Hudson,” I offered, and I am not too proud to admit, here in my private papers at least, that I felt the prick of hot tears beneath my eyelids.
The security director, whose hand was still extended, stared as the undeniably most brilliant but rudest man he had ever encountered hung his head at the shorter man’s command. “Sorry,” he mumbled into his scarf.
His eyes opened wide. It was something we seldom did. When we were out, we were, of course, accustomed to dining in inns and hotels, but when at home, Mrs Hudson spoilt us thoroughly by making everything she served us herself. When she left us to spend a few days with her sister, we would go out for our meals. The last time we had brought prepared food in had been a year prior, as close as I can calculate, when, after some rather surprisingly colourful words from Mrs Hudson—directed towards a smoking and ill-behaving stove—she had set out to purchase something for lunch and employ someone to repair the monstrous thing.
Mycroft rolled up his sleeves, pulled the small stool over, and, with a sigh, bent over the tub’s edge with a flannel and carefully—so carefully—removed as much dirt and muck from his brother’s skin as he thought safe. He didn’t want to rub him raw.
“What’s the matter, sweetheart?” Solomon demanded in concern, and Winifred couldn’t help smiling at the endearment.
“What have you been up to?” the older man inquired. One of his activities was obvious—and he was not thrilled with the use of his dressing gown—but Sherlock looked comfortable and calm and clearly felt safe in his soft-walled construction. He watched his brother for a moment. He was sitting cross-legged and, using a large book as a writing desk, busily filling a sheet of paper with waxy colours. There were pieces of paper spread all over the floor. “Drawing, is it?”
“He was left alone for five minutes, wearing nothing but one of those delightful hospital gowns and—I
When we had finished, I suggested a bath and fresh clothing, and he had nodded in wordless agreement. I knocked on the door to the corridor to have the tray taken away and to see who was in the corridor. I had hoped to see Henry, but after his overnight vigil with us, I knew that he was in need of respite. The attendant there—Patrick—took the tray and nodded as I explained my intent. I made it clear that I would oversee this activity myself.
The gracious, hardworking lady—the mother of the young girl I had attended to—was quite shocked and upset to hear of our mutual friend’s misfortune.
He was aware, too, that he had been away for a long time before that, and that during that time he had not exactly been on holiday. When he bathed (he ignored the parade of nurses who were in constant attendance) he would stare down at his body and attempt…
he wondered. It was intolerable. He was on the sofa in Mycroft’s bedroom—and wearing his brother’s pyjamas. It was about two o’clock in the morning, according to two of the three clocks scattered through the room. He wasn’t sure how long he had been imprisoned in the huge house, but it had been long enough. He wanted to go home.
But I am losing the scent, as it were. I started out considering how changed my life is from what it was—how our lives together have changed, and considering what we have just been through—three weeks of absolute misery and even fear—I am recalling quite clearly the first time I encountered Sherlock Holmes “in the dumps”—which is an understatement that I regret not addressing terribly effectively at the first.
I glanced at Mycroft uneasily, but he had his chin to his chest, seemingly in deep thought and assuredly in great anguish, so I plunged ahead with my strongest point. “Sherlock, did it not occur to you what it would do to me if you left?”
Sherlock smiled to himself. He couldn’t manage much with his dodgy hands, but he could, if he was very careful, pour the tea.
“She’s butch enough,” Mark, the marginally shorter and younger of the two, was also the quicker-witted. “Or so I hear.”
We had been sharing diggings for approximately three months. We were still Watson and Holmes to one another. I was already in the habit of doctoring him quite a bit—for his headaches and injuries and illnesses. I had witnessed one episode of his mania but had not yet encountered him at his lowest. But now I was. This was not to be the worst episode, but it was the first, and far preceded any understanding on my own part that this was an illness.
He had dropped his book, and now he slid cautiously off the bed. He looked around himself. There was a table and chairs in the room. There was paper; a pencil. Struggling to get control over his shaking hands, he bent his head over the table and began, painfully slowly, to write.
I cannot—no, although I sat down to record all that occurred, I find that I cannot bear to think on it just now.
“Yes, of course. When he is afflicted in this manner, I see to it that he is safe whilst we wait for his eventual return to reason.”
“We need to find out who they are, but I don’t wish to draw attention to the incident by asking them too many questions,” Mycroft admitted. “The same with the police sergeant who was on duty that night.”
“No, I wasn’t,” he agreed. “But this morning I realised that I was tired of kippers and it was raining and I’ve been reading about some absolutely fascinating organised criminal activity in the newspapers and there’s a
From there I rinsed and wrung out the sponge and gently cleaned his face. His eyes were shut and his head tilted upwards, so the water from his newly-soaked locks would run down his back, and I reached up and gently wiped his lovely features clean. I stroked across his broad brow. I brushed as lightly as I was able over his eyelids. I lovingly worked the sponge down his sharp cheekbones and hawk-like nose. I rinsed and wrung it out again and then cleaned that lovely little bit just above his perfect lips and as I wiped across and under his chin and behind his ears I admit that I placed a light kiss on them.
“I am grateful that because of this, I did join my friend today, for meeting you and your husband has allowed me to make a deduction about your
He raised his head and looked down at his legs. They were slightly spread, and each ankle was tied to a corner of the bed frame. It was (fortunately) a narrow bed, so his legs weren’t uncomfortably far apart, but he had absolutely no range of motion. He couldn’t even get his heels off the mattress.
I also must admit that I, as I always do, felt nothing but tenderness and concern for him as I cleaned him up. Mrs. Hudson supplied some ice chips in a rag for his forehead. His hand is not so bad now that I have cleaned it—his fingers will be stiff for a day or two, of course, and I am sure that he will complain most bitterly about the inconvenience of it all.
I had little appetite for breakfast, but I did partake of more than one cup of coffee, and then tried to settle myself to reading a medical journal.
He glanced at the stack of books. There was one about chess; two about chemistry. One was about the history of the use of fingerprints in criminal investigations that had been a gift from Sherlock himself.
If they were lucky, Ian, who excelled at going undercover as a homeless person (and was once one of Sherlock’s own homeless network—a fact that only Sherlock, Mycroft, and Ian knew), would find out something about the dark-haired, strange-eyed thin man who had possibly been in the area several days prior.
It is, of course, all of those elements at once, and more, but it is—I will admit it here, in my private papers—only a façade.
When he was done, his patient fell back, panting and pale. He sat on the cold tiles, drew his knees up, and hid his face on them.
I admit to the slightest bit of dread when reading your subterfuge about “the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given,” and am relieved to tell you that I am quite whole and well while being equally grateful for you doing so in another way of “throwing off the scent.”
Solomon, who was walking beside his patient, ushering him along the hospital corridors, glanced sideways at him as he paused and then halted entirely. “Sherlock?” he prompted, turning to look at him.
“Yes. Of course. I’ll go get it.” She headed into the en-suite bathroom. “He should be drinking more water,” she added over her shoulder. “He’s been rather fussed about that.”
Sherlock shook his head. “Dear me. Surely you do not wish for me to delve into the details in front of the good doctor.”
His brother sat up even straighter (which I did not think possible). “My point is this: our mother was about your age when she began to grow increasingly erratic in her behaviour. Each fit was more intense and lasted longer than the one before. And then it became… untenable.”
[There is a break in the doctor’s manuscript; sometimes even in his private papers he is reticent about describing the more intimate activities in which they engaged.]
“Helen, whatever has happened?” I asked. I was distressed to note that she was red-faced and wet-cheeked, and her hat was on rather askew.
She considered this. “My sister… but… by train? How… who will take care of… what is wrong with me? I cannot remember the name of the town in which she lives.”
Sherlock considered this before nodding slowly. He was not entirely sure why he was in his brother’s bedroom anyway, and he longed for some privacy. There was someone who he liked sharing with, though. Wasn’t there?
Christopher was back. Mycroft was impressed with him, as he was with a few of the other nurses. He seemed genuinely concerned with the welfare of his patient, with a compassionate manner and a gentle touch. After the situation with his brother that night, he had somehow managed to get a few hours’ sleep, but had been summoned to his office before the sun was completely up. He tried focusing on the situation at hand, but even while placating yet another highly-visible victim of some sort of blackmailer—who of course the victim would not identify—he had felt a strong urge to return to his brother’s room to see how he was doing. He was lying on the bed. The room was darkened. His eyes were heavy-lidded and his features slack.
I retreated to my own bedroom, my steps slow. My limbs felt heavy and my head hung in shame and anguish. I just stood there for a few moments, recalling Sherlock’s hurtful words over and over. He did not wish to be with me. He did not wish for me to kiss him or touch him. He did not want to hear about how he made me feel.
It took a bit of negotiating, but eventually there we were—I seated on the bed, Mycroft in the chair by the fireplace (after a period of observation, he had allowed Henry to make up the fire, and the room was slowly warming), and Sherlock pacing between us, with brief detours towards the windows. True to his word, he had not approached either of the doors.
I slit it open and withdrew several sheets of paper, covered in the same tidy handwriting. The correspondence was headed with the usual date, location, and salutation.
That was most visits, of course—but not every one. The other visits the curly-haired man had graced them with were of a decidedly different nature. Those visits usually began with Mycroft and his driver, often with at least one assistant, heading out into the night. A while later, they would return with an additional passenger—one who was dishevelled, often incoherent, often ill—and she would know that for the next day or two she would be making a great deal of tea, bowls of soup, and sandwiches, and doing a great deal of washing.
“Good God, Sherlock. Enough. I am heartily sorry to have pressed you to recall such horrible events.”
Well, his eye was still a bit of a mess and he did have that rather nasty wound on his temple. Hum. His hands were not exactly pristine, either—all of the knuckles were healing, but still visibly bruised and split. He licked his lips; they were split and chapped.
And so, he was working that night—that first time. The first crime scene. The first appearance of a too-thin, strung-out young man with intense grey eyes, dark hair, and an oddly commanding voice.
He obediently held his hands out to her as she wiped them with a warm, wet flannel, then startled her by grabbing it and bringing it to his mouth. It was that gesture—so reminiscent of her little brother when he was a toddler—that decided her.
What on earth have I just done? Am I going mad? I cannot believe my own behaviour. I can barely write this. But there is no denying it.
make that threat, for it certainly was the key to dismissing any possibility that they would pursue the issue further. But this also means that we must be even more vigilant in hiding our own depravity. If you were able to discover all from a few conversations with shopkeepers and one brief look, someone with lesser powers could, with time and enough information, infer the same of us.”
That evening I was able to move him into his bedroom, change him into proper nightclothes, and get him into his bed. I did not, of course, turn down the gas or close his door, and I made it very clear that even when I retired myself that I was just in the next room if he needed me.
His speech was so rapid and his shouting so hoarse that I truly cannot record his words—neither Mycroft nor I could catch more than bits of what he spat out.
Whether Mycroft noted this before I did, I do not know. He most certainly did not comment on it. And then, unfortunately, it became a moot point.
“So, back to my original query: do you consider yourself a moral woman because you perform virtuous acts, or do you consider yourself so for avoiding acts that are considered repulsive, or harmful, or even cruel?”
“Yes.” His voice, strained and low, was beginning to cause me some concern, and I fought to keep my own level.
Never. He had never, ever been able to turn it off, nor to ignore it. Not since infancy. His loving parents (he admitted that that was what they were; even if Dad was the sane one, Mummy did an admirable job of faking it) had been baffled. They loved—adored—doted on—their sons. Mycroft, while not terribly affectionate, had been at least somewhat responsive to their affections (he had corrected that later in life, but he did not claim responsibility for anything he had done under the age of fourteen).
And now what was Victor doing to his ankle? Same sensation: fabric and a lifting of the mattress and then an inability to move his leg.
But now, of course, the other primary purpose for the electronics was to monitor the multiple CCTV feeds that covered virtually every inch of the property, inside and out. The feeds generally ran in the background, but if anything triggered a specific feed—a motion sensor being set off, for example—the window would open, interrupting whatever else she was doing.
So, he carefully trimmed the head of thick, dark curls and delicately shaved the horribly thin face and did not once even open his mouth except to ask him to sit up a bit; lift his chin.
Belinda’s robust voice startled me. I had been deeply involved in type-writing our latest adventure and had only been dimly aware of the bell ringing. I pushed my chair back from my desk and rushed to the top of the steps.
“Obviously, John. Mr. Harper planned to re-visit them when they returned in the evening. I have no idea what he planned to say or do—that is beyond my responsibilities.”
He is still pale, but he is always pale, and the injuries to his hands are, although still apparent (I have removed the bandaging but insist that he allow me to examine the wounds twice daily), healing.
He nodded miserably, and I rubbed his back, considering our situation. I finally came to a conclusion. “Well, my love, what do you think we should do about this predicament?” I inquired. I quite purposely said “we” to let him know that I was not terribly angry with him and that I was not going to abandon him.

Without taking his eyes off me, he slowly let first one leg and then the other slide to the floor. He rose and approached me cautiously; finally standing in front of me.
“There’s more,” he said so quietly that even with my ear inches away from his lips, I barely caught his words.
He had been edging closer to his bedroom, clearly hoping to slip in and finish his packing. “Nothing!” he exclaimed guiltily.
“As I have already explained, he had lost a ring. Do keep up. Ow!” His exclamation was the result of me applying the nail brush perhaps a bit more vigorously than was necessary.
He suddenly sprang up and, walking swiftly to the door, locked it before lowering the lamp. By necessity we would now be sitting in the gathering darkness, so as to observe Miss Stoner’s window without being observed ourselves.
And then there was the most grotesque aspect of the macabre scene—the fork and the rose. The choice of a rose—a red rose—and had not Mr. Harper confirmed that he did not have any roses in his garden? So, the intruder had brought not just the place settings but the rose with him—
“But I was not making any motions the least bit evocative of that activity. In fact, I should think it was rather the opposite—pulling a sharp fork from a chair’s seat seems a rather off-putting action.”
He was skeletally thin—his scant appetite for so many consecutive days was the cause for that. I noted that on the small table by the fireplace, there were napkins that apparently held the food that had been offered to him each day. He had been permitted water in a wooden cup, but everything else was the sort of food he could eat without the aid of fork, spoon, or of course knife. There seemed to be quite a bit of toast and lemon sponge, his favourite, I realise now.
I carefully unwrapped his hands, teasing the cloth, stiff with dried blood, away from his damaged fingers. I wiped them and wrapped them in clean bandages. “Does it hurt a great deal?” I asked.
“You are such a dear man,” she murmured. “But do not concern yourself. I mourned them in my heart, but I did what I had to do to make my way. Sometimes I feel that Mr. Hudson in particular would be proud of the way I have managed.”
“But I am afraid that I have not been entirely forthcoming as to the expression which my father’s resentment sometimes took.”
He checked the bath water. “Your bath is almost ready. You’ll feel much better when you’re clean and warm and dry,” he told him. “Time to get all that muck off.”
“Sherlock, stop this at once.” Mycroft strode across the room and, without preamble, snatched the dressing gown that his brother held and rather emphatically threw it to the floor.
This was so irritating, he thought. Why was he here, dressed in one of those ridiculous hospital gowns that left nothing to the imagination? His head was
It was unbearable. Two escape attempts in one day—he had somehow managed to slip out again, this time toward the end of the evening shift with yet another new nurse—infuriated Mycroft while simultaneously alarming him. It was dark and rainy, and he had gone out both times without a coat.
“I have no idea. I think he was just disoriented—I mean, more than usual. You know how it is sometimes when you wake up suddenly. He was trying so hard to tell me. He got himself so frustrated, and he started slamming his hands on the floor.” She demonstrated the angry motions.
As I am writing this in retrospect, I understand now that that was the moment when I realised that the elder man was addressing his brother, seven years his minor but certainly an adult, much as a father would address a very small, misbehaving child—because that was, to be honest, what he was doing. I can reflect now on how very odd and very sad for the government man—to have to become not just a father but a stern one to his own brother.
I finished my own sherry and reached for the glass that had been intended for my darling. He fidgeted with his cigarettes; with the assorted bric-a-brac that cluttered the mantlepiece.
The driver was so, so grateful when the nurse—the nice one with who reminded him of his favourite auntie—uncapped the syringe, dropped to her knees, found and held a thin arm, and pushed the plunger in.
So, it was likely that the trespasser had been a guest of Mr. Harper’s at least once and it had been a recent visit, during which perhaps this person had simply noted the defect—or perhaps had damaged the latch intentionally so as to have a means of entrance?
“And,” she continued, “if he doesn’t take one bite of anything, no one will force him or beg him or reason with him or humiliate him. I’ll see to that. So, watch yourself. Now, I have things to do.” And she turned and left her alone.
“Although—I will confide in you because I do love you, John—” and then, so close to a revelation, his resolve dissolved and he stopped speaking. I was intrigued—and his words “I do love you” sent sensations throughout my mind and body that I cannot even describe... I took a hold of myself.
“It’s normal,” the driver stated firmly. “I know it’s not normal for them, but it’s normal for everyone else.”
I could not help myself one moment longer. I burst out laughing. “Oh, the horror!” I exclaimed. “You do know that Mr. Wilde was arrested for a bit more than wearing ‘aesthetic’ outfits?”
Mycroft, who was seated behind the enormous desk in his home office, frowned. Mummy was rarely so short with him. Did she suspect anything? No, of course not. How could she?
“Eventually someone gathered me up in their arms and brought me back up to bed. I do not remember anything after that, except that sometimes when I awoke from those horrible fever-dreams, the housekeeper was there by my bedside, and her face was… I did not quite understand it then, but now I realise that she had been weeping.”
Looking back, I am mortified to not have realised it earlier and even more chagrined to not have written to you immediately upon my discovery. I am sure you understand that at the very first I was overwhelmed by the entire situation, and then I will admit to allowing myself to become distracted by my marriage, establishing our new household, and the sale of the manor-house.
Not taking his eyes off me now, he ran his hand along the brass rail at the foot of my bed, his hand flat as if it rested on a fine, smooth table top. “And then what did I do?”
“This doesn’t mean I’ll play with you,” the doctor added. Their few attempts at Sherlock instructing John in the game had nearly ended in violence more than once.
This one read: “I noted a draught coming from your bedroom. I believe you need to examine your fireplace. –Sherlock”
“I am so sorry to hear that,” he ejaculated earnestly. “Yes, of course you must return to Baker Street at once, my dear Watson. Perhaps you can persuade Mrs. Hudson to make you something refreshing to drink, and you must lie down in a darkened room until you are feeling more yourself. Will that do? Can you manage on your own? Shall I accompany you?” His gaze as it swept over me was piercing indeed.
He was agitated when I returned from speaking with Mycroft this afternoon, demanding to know if I was “spying” on him for his brother.
No, he told himself as he so, so carefully cleaned and bandaged the horrific wound on his leg, Sherlock moaning and whimpering. He hadn’t been involved in searching his clothing after his retrieval. In fact, no one had even mentioned what he had hidden in his coat, so how was he to know that letting him go to the loo by himself was a bad idea?
“How is he?” It was about six in the morning. Mycroft entered his room briskly. He began to retrieve clothing for himself.
“Sadly, this is completely normal behaviour for him,” the older brother replied. “He once went to Buckingham Palace like that.”
I had him in his nightclothes and tucked up. He watched me with hooded eyes as I prepared to retire myself. He smiled sweetly as I turned down the gas and slid into the bed beside him. I sank back into my pillow and shut my eyes.
“Sherlock,” I finally interjected, “have you read my manuscript on your latest case? I wish for you to do so before I send it to my editor.” That was brilliant, if I do say so myself, as he quite obediently went straight to my desk and retrieved the neatly-stacked pages, and he actually did begin to read it. And even though as he was done with each page he simply allowed it to fall to the floor—and he was somehow pacing through the room without looking where he was going—he not only read it through but the endless torrent of words was finally reduced to muttered commentary on the story. Bliss.
So I will wait for Sherlock to return, and I will keep my tongue still as he describes—as he is bound to—his victorious, glorious adventure on the heath or in the pub or having a sword fight in the Hall or wherever he ends up.
Now he watched as his patient, clad only in a blanket as described, pushed himself off the wall on which he had been leaning, looking out the window of his bedroom. His expression was unfathomable. “Hello?” he finally offered.
Dave touched a shaking shoulder tentatively. “Hey,” he almost whispered. “Come into the bedroom and let’s get you dressed.”
I bit my lip. I knew that this was a distinct possibility. I hesitated and reconsidered our situation for a moment. But no…
tenants, but beyond a few rounds of revolver shots and the occasional homicidal maniac coming to tea, we could most certainly not be termed
I wondered if I could also capture the sight of his beautiful skin, seemingly even paler than usual as he stretched languidly across my dark eiderdown cover.
She smiled. “Yes, indeed. It’s a new receipt. I am always on the lookout for anything with lemon or lime for him… Fortunately, I baked them last evening. Since this morning, I have not had the heart to do more with the stove than make the coffee. I’ve got some nice tongue and a cold joint for you later.”
“I was just wondering if he wanted to come down and have something to eat,” she explained. She looked over at him. “Hello, Sherlock,” she called out. “I’ve got some very nice soup if you want to come downstairs and have some.” He considered this, frowning. “It’s a cream soup,” she added enticingly, “with lovely carrots all blended up the way you like, and some ginger.” He considered some more, clearly wishing to be cajoled. “And I’ve gotten some of it on my nice white pinny—carrots stain so—do you think you could help me find something to get the stain out?”
His brother groaned but the man who was in the room with them (that nurse… was his name Solomon? How did he know that?) very calmly held a bin up to his chin.
“So, you were stimulated before we even rose, but you managed to kerb your desires by considering my extremely enlightening and purposeful experiment (and they did not get very far away from the table after they fell off).”
“Well, a bit more than ‘a bit,’ I’m afraid,” I admitted. “You are going to have to be off your feet for quite a while until all this heals.”
Ah. There he was. All six feet of consulting detective was stretched out under a blanket suspended between a table and two chairs, where he was lying on his stomach on top of a solid blue duvet, dressed in pyjamas. His feet were bare—his discarded socks nearby—and he had used a maroon satin dressing gown to create a sort of back wall to his—
Sherlock, who had been out during our interviews, returned exactly in time for the very nice tea Belinda had prepared. She had not had time to make her own bread or cake, of course, but she had done some sort of cheese scones and a mustard spread for them that were just delightful. On her suggestion, we joined Mrs Hudson in her sitting room for our refreshment, and we agreed that she was a welcome addition to our household.
“So, your accusation is that Watson and I are deviants. What illicit behaviour, precisely, do you intend to report to the police?” he drawled, leaning back in his chair and removing a cigarette from his case.
It was the most coherent thing he had managed to say since his retrieval; it was practically a conversation.
As I have already recorded, Sherlock had been doing relatively well, but then something set him off, and I do not know what hurt most—the insults he hurled or that I had to physically, with the assistance of two attendants, pull him away from his brother.
“Apparently, working for Mrs. Bloom is not a pleasant experience. They are frequently lacking a maid-of-all-work or a cook or... well, anyone willing to work in the house for them.”
“I am a respectable, church-going widow,” she replied with another smile. “I can be friends with whomever I wish.”
I tossed my bag to the floor and threw myself into my chair. “Come sit up here with me,” I instructed.
He smiled, finally focusing his full attention on me. “Oh, most of it was a little something I scribbled down a few years ago. Encountering criminals as often as we do sometimes sends me off in the most fantastic directions.”
How he had sliced into that terrible scar on his leg, and how he would continue to do so, over and over, until… until what? What would stop him?
It is not a laziness. It is a weight so heavy that simply lifting one’s head becomes a Herculean task that no mere mortal can accomplish.
Oh, God. What was I going to do? For there in the room with us were not just our client but his maid-of-all-work as well. She was barely eighteen from what I could determine and still had a bit of the roundness of young girlhood to her face. I saw no other option.
Sherlock’s mobile rang. When it was clear that he was going to ignore it, John sighed and bent to retrieve it from the branches of their tree. “It’s your mum,” he said, “and you are going to speak to her and your father.” He thrust the object under his mate’s nose.
“Yes, of course I did,” she said a bit sharply, and I winced at my statement—it must have sounded rather condescending. “And I assured her that she is not going to be dismissed.”
“You really dragged me to one of the busiest places in the city at the busiest time of year to actually shop for gifts? No other reason?”
of the locals were a bit reticent, but in most of the shops I was told—and this will come as no surprise after today’s exchange—that Mrs. Bloom is considered a rather fussy customer.”
Clearly still feeling the effects of Sherlock’s little dose, she fumbled in her pocket for the capped syringe he knew she had.
“No, I could not. You are very important to me. You helped me over the lingering effects of my injuries from the war. You have reminded me that I am a doctor—and a good one—even if it is because you abuse yourself so terribly that I am forced to treat you. You and your rather ridiculous activities have launched me on a new path. You are so very important to me—I truly could not bear losing you.”
I believe that I nearly injured him myself at that point, as my grip on him became even more intense. Still, he managed to continue.
John pushed his healthy dinner away from himself, pushed himself away from the table, and just sat for a while, staring at nothing.
unexpected, but in retrospect, I should have deduced it. I could hear Sherlock berating both of us for not attending to the details—noticing that Belinda had become upset only upon Mrs Hudson offering her the book. Casting our memories back to consider if we had ever witnessed her reading anything. Well, he was not there, and Mrs Hudson and I were, and we were equally taken aback by this discovery.
Our landlady came up with a tray holding a pot of fresh, hot coffee and clean cups and placed it on the table. She glanced over at the shut door, gave me a hesitant smile, and without a word exited.
Since that time, we have, of course, been guests in the very rooms which I describe here, but we all have deliberately not referenced our very first stay in them since that time, and indeed, Mycroft has had some things changed—there is different paper and curtains and other frippery, and now the electric lights—so the suite is quite different to my eyes.
“I did,” I admitted, “and her words have somewhat alarmed me. What precisely did he do?” I did not consider for a moment that Sherlock had actually
“Enough!” he shouted, slamming his hands on the desk. “I have my reasons and you have absolutely no say in the matter.”
“I merely wished to ascertain what, precisely, your wife meant by the word ‘moral’ as applied to herself.”
When the tea tray arrived, I had knocked gently on the door that separated us and called out, “Sherlock? Would you care for some tea?” When he did not respond, I felt myself become tense and anxious. Was he well? I reached towards the door handle—and he startled me when he opened it.
I settled him in the front of the trap, where he soon dropped his chin to his breast and buried himself in thought. The day was as perfect as I described, and even as I worried about my dear friend and his state of mind, I managed to enjoy the fresh air and early hints of spring. London is a bustling, progressive place to live, but sometimes the weight of humanity oppresses one, and it is pleasant to smell the moist earth and feel the sun on one’s face.
so even if it’s American I’ll be able to keep up on everything that’s happening but there’s rags as well and those are always so much more informative when it comes to the criminal class and I suppose I would like it if I had my commonplace books even though some of my other references will be quite useless because you know that they don’t have anything organised anyone can just make a great deal of money gold mining or somehow and then they’re in society and there’s no viscounts or dukes or anything like that at all so how do they know who’s related to whom and to what they are entitled and I don’t think they even have such a thing as entitlement because that’s got to do with titles and they don’t go for those things in America at all the only titles have to do with their jobs doctor or lawyer or political titles like senators didn’t they have senators in Rome how odd that such a young country would use such an old word—”
“His teeth are in good shape,” one of the nurses remarked a bit wryly, flashing a hand with a vivid half-circle of red marks on the back.
I do not quite understand her expression when I tell her such things as I shared—it seems sometimes that she knows what I am about to say before I say it. How can she possibly when I find myself saying things that I did not even know before now?
“There is a reason for that,” he offered. I continued to put away my clothing and toiletry items whilst he talked. “John, I have to explain—my family—my family’s status was always rather precarious. My mother’s ancestor was an artist, after all—hardly a respectable thing. And my father’s… well, even if he did come from a good name he did essentially ruin it, at least in the small social circle in which they were included in their time.”
I was at a loss. Back then, the great developers of our modern perspective and understanding of psychiatry were just beginning their outstanding work on recognising insanity in all its forms as a disease of the mind, just as others were discovering the true nature of the diseases of the body. I admit that that early in my career I did not view my friend’s behaviour as an illness in the way cholera or tuberculosis was, but then neither did the vast majority of those in the medical field. There was an exceptional group of men who thought otherwise, but their beliefs were not as well-known back then—I am making a great number of excuses for my ignorance.
By then the visitors had ceased, and they retreated upstairs gratefully. Sherlock had noticed—for the first time, apparently—the decorations.
It won’t be difficult. His words of admiration have struck me in an odd way and I am a bit unsure of my voice.
I closed my book, rose, and went over to my desk. Sure enough, there were a few letters, and I was not surprised in the slightest when the now-familiar folded sheet fell out from between them.
“Yes, I’m all right,” he replied now, but the tone of his voice and the look in his eyes made it clear that he had barely heard my question.
Sherlock chuckled and puffed on his pipe. “Not quite. But in order to do his job effectively, he must remain completely anonymous—which is why I have not mentioned his existence and now you are not to, either.”
“An orange would be lovely. Anything else? What about some nice tea and toast?” she added. He nodded again.
Leaving him for a bit, she began to read the extensive notes left by the previous nurses. From the times noted, it was apparent that he was living on a completely skewed schedule—no regard to day or night; regular bedtimes or meals. That wasn’t unusual for his condition. She frowned in concentration as she skimmed through the pages, then went back and began to read more carefully. Even for someone suffering from a brain injury, his behaviour was erratic. There were comments about what food he would and would not touch; what coverings he would tolerate on his bed.
Sherlock was so startled that he nearly dropped his fork. “Did I hear that correctly, John?” he managed. “Did my brother just say that he changed his mind about something?”
“Holmes,” I interrupted. “Please forgive me, but I am going to take my leave. I am feeling distinctly unwell.”
Sherlock’s expression shifted from bored back to suspicious. “What’s going on, John?” he asked softly.
“I have been rolling around in warm manure,” he pointed out, impatiently snatching the flannel I offered from my hand. “I ruined my gloves.”
“You never had any intention of staying clean,” the policeman commented. “How’d you convince the doctors to let you go?”
He grimaced but methodically took some scrapings from under the nearly black fingernails and a few swabs from his face and hands, Sherlock staring at the cotton buds in confusion and fascination, not wincing as he gingerly prodded at the shredded knuckles on both once-elegant hands.
He would sit on the floor on some cushions and stare into the fire, his legs pulled up to his chest and his arms wrapped tightly around them. Sometimes he would rock and sometimes he would pull at his hair.
I sighed. I had now truly exhausted all the information I had. Obviously as I was taking my leave, Sherlock’s attention had been drawn by something new, for he had dashed around towards the back of the house, and, of course, solved the whole matter in time for tea.
It was some seconds before I heard the familiar footsteps of my darling as he strode back to the house along the gravel pathway that I had used to effect my escape.
And upon reflection, I also must admit that his story was quite exciting, and his description of the strong language of the man as “vigorous adjectives”—he just made me laugh at that, he is so very prim at times—and I am rather proud of him for sending the ruffian home in a cart.
“Holmes?” I nearly whispered. “Are you all right?” I laid a hand on his shoulder. He slowly turned his head and stared at me. “Can I help?” I added.
The skin covering the top of her foot, up as far as her ankle, had apparently been scalded—in addition to the redness, vesicles had already formed, and there was noticeable oedema as well.
Mycroft had had enough. “Sedate him. Now!” he ordered, barely flinching as the sharp blade pressed into his pale flesh.
There were certainly witnesses to my uncouth behaviour in my club. Whilst the members of my former club might somewhat soften their descriptions of my behaviour during those months, there was no reason for them to deny it. I was boorish and sulky—nothing for me to be proud of, but hardly nefarious actions.
The man had helped him with some things that he couldn’t quite manage. That must have been why he was there. That made sense. Big Brother was busy—he was always busy. He had no idea what he did, but he knew that he was very important—far too important to be helping his little brother with things like wiping his fingers (and face) after breakfast and using the toilet.
“You mean knock him out and strap him down on that table?” the government man hissed. “No. Absolutely not. Can you just give him something to help calm him?”
Yes, I believe that you should stay away; to return would just allow me the opportunity to hurt you again. You will please let Mrs. Hudson know where to send on your things. I wish you well.
We remained that way for a while. Finally, it seemed the correct time. “My love,” I began, gently, “the odious behaviour of that vile man seems to have gotten you quite upset. You mentioned that he reminded you of your own father. Is that so?”
He glanced up at the street signs, oriented himself, and headed for the nearest large department store.
“As I have said before, there was a time in my life when I thought it was my role in life to uphold the law—without question,” I offered.
the capital letters)? He had no way of knowing, because half the time it was for a frustrating case and the other half—
Reseating myself, I felt brave enough to tackle the issue head-on. “Mrs. Hudson, my dear, I know that this is probably a very inappropriate and rather unlikely conversation for a tenant to have with his landlady, but I am also a medical doctor—and your friend. I would like to consider myself your friend. Is that acceptable?”
Mycroft stopped in the kitchen to tell Mrs Parker that yes, he and his brother would dine together in his room before slipping back down into his office.
I laughed. “They are quite comfortable and more practical—they don’t ruck up and leave your legs cold.”
A short time ago, he left for Farnham on his own to rectify my “faulty” expedition and that is perfectly fine with me. I hope he enjoys his bloody peaceful day in the country. I am quite tempted to leave him to his own devices for a week or two. The only issue which dissuades me from this plan is the note we received from Miss S. Even though she professes that her employer is being a gentleman, even in the face of her refusing his proposal, how much do we truly know about him? After all, he is the one with the odious bully of an acquaintance, Mr. Woodson, so clearly, he is at least sometimes a poor judge of character. I am anxious as to her safety.
I have not yet recorded my observations of the attendants—those men hired specifically for the purpose of attending to Sherlock rather than his usual household servants. Most of them are extremely large, sturdy men who never speak a word that is not directly related to their tasks and who never have any expression on their faces but a surly sort of resignation. There are a few who seem to take a perverse pleasure in my friend’s suffering—I caught one taunting him when I had stepped away and returned unexpectedly. I reported this to Mycroft and have not laid eyes on him since.
The doctor took this in the manner in which it was intended—a compliment—and headed towards an attractive display.
The remains of such a hypodermic needle were found outdoors, several weeks later. I suspect that the creature, frightened by the attack from Mr. Holmes and then by the serpent, which my stepfather was apparently handling, fled my stepfather’s bedroom by the window, taking and then discarding the needle.
“My darling,” I told him firmly, “no, you do not and never will bore me. You do sometimes overwhelm and confound me, but you have never once been anything but positively fascinating to me.”
despite all of the precautions, the landing on the pavement had been painful and despite trying his best to be a corpse and not have a pulse and don’t blink and don’t breathe he had been acutely aware of his elbows and his knees and later at molly’s he had stripped in the bathroom and yes he was bruised and bleeding and he wanted
But he is also my dear friend and I cannot bear to think of life without him—and at this juncture, that is a distinct possibility.
John’s sister launched into an overly detailed, overly enthusiastic description of her latest girlfriend and her family, commenting several times on how welcoming they were. When he was finally able to end the call, he rolled his eyes. Sherlock, who had been buried in a new book, glanced up and frowned.
That Mycroft’s servants are of the most discreet natures possible is not even a question. “They do not question my orders, nor do they discuss them, nor any of my guests,” he proclaimed. “No one would dare breathe a word about my brother--and if anyone ever
“Oh! Is that all? Do not concern yourself. There is no reason for you to know anything at all about it. It happened before you and Mr. Holmes lived here. It is in my past.”
It had been three fairly sleepless nights for both of us. I had risen quite sluggishly and dressed. I looked in on Sherlock then. He was lying on his side, with his back to the door. “Holmes?” I called out softly. I walked across the room and laid my hand on his shoulder, rolling him gently onto his back. His face was wet with tears; his eyes red.
The nurse closed and re-shelved the atlas and, after ten minutes, finally was able to persuade his patient to stand and walk slowly out of the room.
He shrugged in his old, eloquent way, but she wasn’t fooled for an instant. She knew that haunted, pained look in his eyes.
In short, you were, in all respects, an abominable husband. And this brings me directly to my original purpose.
Of course, I am the idiot who followed his instructions and went to the country and ended up crouching in some gorse on a damp heath, waiting for our client to arrive.
“Thank you,” I managed. The brandy was a favourite of mine, but even so it burned my throat, so tight it was.
“Pock…” I stuttered—I was so taken aback by my sudden realisation that I became utterly unprofessional and inarticulate.
In a way, it was rather nice that his baby brother was back—now she would have someone else on which to set her sights. Well, it would be nice—once they and Sherlock were actually back in contact. Which, based on his current condition, was not going to happen for quite a while.
“Hey, John,” Greg called out as he strode up the steps. He had a bag with wrapped gifts in one hand. “Merry Christmas!”
“So, I wish to comfort you, and I believe that you will feel much calmer—and not quite so alone—if you just sit with me for a bit.” He considered this. I had chosen my words carefully. When he had confessed that he was distressed more by the idea that a family could be torn apart by greed and subterfuge, I recalled what little he has told me of his own family. It could hardly have been a comfort to be reminded of his childhood. “Just come sit with me for a bit and we will discuss the situation.”
“So, even though I saw that she was not exactly enthusiastic about my plan, I attempted to give her the book.”
He was so engrossed in his own thoughts that I had to give him a hand up into the trap. This startled him, and he gave me a piercing if fleet glare. I felt my face fall; he really did seem to be headed down one of those dark paths upon which he sometimes lost himself. But then it was my turn to be startled when he suddenly gave me the most affectionate, sweet,
“Oh, yes! Of course,” I replied in haste. No, it would be quite untoward for a stranger to learn of the more unusual ways in which we tend to my darling. It would likewise be imperative that she would be prevented from any shocks. “He will have to behave himself,” I realised. “I will speak to him quite firmly about it.”
He stopped again and I simply waited, giving him a moment to collect himself. Finally, he continued. “So, you see, we had no choice. We brought her to one of those places—one of those places where they take folks like her. It was… we had to keep her safe, didn’t we? And she’s not a frail thing, sir—she is more like me than most woman would care for—oh, sir, I have never done such a hard thing. That place—I do understand that they need to be that way, but to see the poor wretches in their rags, lost and frightened and confused…”
“Right where I left you. Good job, Sherlock,” she called out as she entered a room Solomon had not been in before. He glanced around in bafflement before spotting him.
He pushed her again and then tried to hit her and he knew he’d really be in big trouble now but she still wouldn’t go away and his head was starting to hurt and his eyes were blurry and he wanted to shout at her to go but he couldn’t make his mouth work and it was all so very scary and he was frightened and angry and then something stuck him and he started to feel very odd and his arms were heavy and his legs felt wobbly and he just wanted to lie down on the big bed…
“Something’s up, sir,” the driver had reported as soon as he had entered the security code that would open the gate and eased the car onto the driveway. He indicated a small group of people gathered near the outer wall.
He barely seemed to notice as I took his pulse and rested my wrist on his forehead. I fetched my stethoscope and listened to his heart and his lungs. “Look at me,” I requested. His eyes were clear. I prodded gently at his neck. “Open up,” I instructed and he did; his throat looked fine.
His brother had switched from pencil back to crayons and was currently drawing what could only be a map. Mycroft watched with interest as he put down the blue crayon with which he was working—was he drawing bodies of water? —and took up a green one.
Even somewhat prepared, though, he felt his stomach drop as he rapidly scanned the dozen or so crayoned images. “My God,” he finally exhaled, putting the stack face-down on the table. “Should we show Mr Holmes?”
“You know perfectly well what these are,” I replied in an even tone. I was not going to rise to his deliberate antagonism. “You are running a great risk of me leaving again,” I added, almost nonchalantly. That did it.
“Well,” I managed, my throat tight, “you are, as usual, correct on all points. But how did you know?”
The first time he missed his daughter’s dance programme, he was entirely conscious of the direction he had chosen. The first missed birthday party. The first missed anniversary. He knew what he was doing.
John sighed deeply as he watched the retreating figure. That was the third in the last twenty minutes they’d chased off the floor. “Lavender slippers for Mrs H,” he confirmed. “With the dressing gown and eye mask, that’s you and me for her.”
There. He was in bed. As I had predicted, he had been eerily complacent, allowing me to direct all of his movements. I released my grasp on his elbow only long enough to use my latch key, and then regained it to direct him gently upstairs. Mrs Hudson (bless her) popped out into the vestibule when we gained our entrance, wondering at our early return, but without a word exchanged between us, she seemed to understand.
“Indeed,” he continued, “it is rather the opposite. It is cold that causes you to suffer—cold and dry winter air. I dislike it when your scars cause you such discomfort and long for nothing but to be able to relieve you of some of the pain in any way I can.”
He nodded vigorously, still smiling. “He was extremely helpful in that respect. It was a fairly simple one—rose gold, with a round red garnet surrounded by six small diamonds in a pattern of braided vines. It was of a somewhat unusually large size, as women’s rings go, and although somewhat valuable, my client was more distressed because it had belonged to his mother and had great sentimental value.”
The agitation returned. His speech was still somewhat normal, but his motions began to take on the ugly twitching that I was, at that point, so disheartened by. His long fingers began to pick and pull at the blanket he wore over his shoulders and his head to twitch back and forth in disturbing, bird-like motions—first to look at me, then at his brother, back and forth. His rate of breathing began to increase and despite the somewhat warmer temperature of the room and his exertions, he began to tremble as if chilled again.
And then he straightened the poker, and for a short time I found myself quite distracted by his wiry frame.
The government man felt something very odd and foreign going on in his chest. “Yes, that’s your pirate ship,” he agreed when he could speak.
“It is your illness. I will have your husband make the arrangements.” I requested that he join us at that time, explained to him what his wife required to recover from her illness, and sent them off. I never heard from either of them again, so I never will know if she recovered herself.
“Damn,” the older Holmes brother groaned. He was seated in the bedroom next to his own. He glanced over at the bed, sighing as he noted that his brother, finally quiet and stoned on the injection that the surprisingly strong nurse had managed to get into him, was awake but not taking any notice of his surroundings.
“I myself make a distinction between ‘ethical’ and ‘virtuous’ behaviours. I believe that ‘ethical’ ways of thinking are concerned with doing no harm—as our good doctor here can attest by his profession of the Hippocratic Oath. By simply avoiding certain injurious behaviours, one can be considered ethical, and therefore moral. Virtuous acts, on the other hand, require a more...
She had done brussels sprouts, which the detective usually despised, but instead of simply boiling them, she had roasted them with garlic and balsamic vinegar, and he had, surprisingly, quite liked them. (John really enjoyed them as well and made a mental note to get the recipe from her.)
“I know that his reasoning seems to be returning to normal, for the most part—I still can’t believe how many times he’s gotten away from us—but he’s still barely speaking,” she pointed out, unnecessarily. He scowled at her and she scowled back.
She thought about the confidentiality agreement and how now she was even more grateful that she could not tell a soul outside of that house what she was witnessing—as the once-great detective drifted off with a cushion clutched to his chest, his cheeks wet with tears and a knuckle pressed to his wounded lips.
Can I be somewhat optimistic? After the horrible conversation with Mycroft Holmes this morning, I have given Sherlock privacy—and insisted that the servants and attendants do the same—but now a footman has brought a tray with tea and cakes, and I have determined that I need to check on him. I want to see his face and examine his injuries. I want to try to get him to eat something.
Greg watched as he pushed the door open and unfolded himself from the car—and promptly passed out cold. It was rather horrifying to watch; as the DL fumbled with his own door he just went straight down. “Shit, Sherlock!” he shouted as he dashed around the front of the car and threw himself onto his knees next to the younger man. He was alarmingly pale and out cold. “Hey,” he muttered as he patted one gaunt cheek. “Come on. Come back to me.”
The housekeeper began ticking off on her fingers. “One: he despises roasted chicken. Two: he despises rosemary. Three: he cannot bear to eat carrots and peas together. Four: he won’t eat mashed potatoes with anything in them—let alone mushrooms. And five: there is no way I am not going to make him dessert. He’ll eat sweets when you can’t get anything else into him.”
Greg blew out an exasperated breath. “Will you at least come sit in my car, then? We can talk there, yeah?” The dark curls moved slightly. Yes, that would be acceptable. He found his helping hand being thrust impatiently away, but he managed to keep close as the thin figure turned rather shakily and began to move directly towards his car.
As he grew, he absorbed attention of any sort the same way. He loved anything thrown his way—by age two he was aware that his big brother (whom he idolised) got something called “good marks” that were a subject of praise, and while he was delighted to congratulate him (Mycroft had a distinct memory of his baby brother, not 100% toilet-trained, toddling up to him and hugging his knees in congratulations over some silly foreign language award), when he began receiving similar accolades, at first he had absolutely loved it.
He seemed disinclined to feed himself, and Solomon patiently fed him one forkful at a time while Sherlock gazed at the crayon marks on his hand, lost in thought.
Better than the condition he was in now, that was certain. Clever—and stupid—little brother had managed to find a dealer and, based on the way he looked now, the wallet he had pickpocketed had been well-lined.
They were interrupted by a polite knock at the door. He had jumped and ducked behind her, peering cautiously around her to see who was at the door. It was Mrs Parker, the housekeeper.
Mycroft Holmes. She turned the mobile to show him the display. Impossibly, he became even paler. He shook his head and put a finger to his lips.
Sherlock smirked as he tore through the paper and tape, making a show of getting a piece stuck to his finger, then chuckling at John’s muttered “Prat.”
He slid off my lap and followed me obediently into my bedroom. I turned and stood by the foot of my bed. “Now, here I am at the dining room table of Mr. Harper, counting the rather overly fussy plates. Where were you?”
“You seen your kids yet?” the doctor asked gently. It was the first Christmas after he had split from his wife (now officially ex-wife-number-two) and John ached for his friend. He himself had been happy not to have had to deal with his sister, but he couldn’t imagine what it would be like to be separated from your children on such a special day.
The medical team members glanced at one another and agreed—yes, it was enough. They had done as thorough a job as they could under the circumstances.
“It is sufficient for the moment. I am, of course, continuing to look about me. But do not be concerned—I shall not leave here until Mrs Hudson is quite healed.”
That blow was the last of the battle. Once out upon the road, Black Dog, in spite of his wound, showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute. The captain, for his part, stood staring—
John looked at the scrap of paper. It was written in thick, black marker—just a phone number and a name. He didn’t even know why he still had the paper. He had entered the number into his mobile’s contacts—first and last name—not long ago.
“Doctor Watson, I presume?” he intoned, striding into the room. He removed his hat and gloves and made a bow to me. I noticed that he carried a walking stick with an elaborate silver head.
“Being immobilized as I have been,” she began, indicating with a sweep of her hand both her injured foot and the bed, “and with Belinda doing so much of the work, I have had some time on my hands, and I have been using it to catch up on some reading and the like.” She paused and sighed. “And one of the books I chose to delve into was
“You would make an excellent secretary,” I remarked as I read over the neatly-composed advertisement. He gave me a complicated look—half pleased and half annoyed. “Now, run this to the newsagent, and you must bring home something for us to eat.”
John was beginning to feel overheated and hungry and overloaded with the suffocating mixture of voices, music, and not-always-pleasant scents surrounding them. He couldn’t fathom how his mate had remained, at least for him,
“First, that’s not the point, and second, she hasn’t gotten one in several years—since her father died.”
make Sherlock squirm, pulling subtly on his ligatures, was this: He had been stupid enough to let Victor overpower him. He had been stoned enough that he wasn’t even aware of what was happening, and he had just let it happen. He was not in control of the situation.
“But then,” he continued, “if I look at it objectively—observe it, as I would in someone else—I would be forced to point out that my mother, who also suffered from these moods, did so for her entire life.”
“So, you see, Mrs Hudson must remain off her feet for several days—I hope to give her at least ten if not a fortnight. We are advertising for a temporary maid-of-all-work, but until we engage one, we were wondering if you would be able to bring us some meals and perhaps tend to some of the most necessary household tasks.”
“Take it out! Take it out of the box, Daddy!” he demanded, waving it frantically at John, who beamed at him and took it.
He was referring to a rather unfortunate experiment of his involving fresh boughs of holly and ivy, testing their combustibility to corroborate or disprove the story of a rather unpleasant fellow accused of setting fire to his employer’s place of business during the Christmas season. (The unfortunate conclusion—for the accused—was that although the fire did not spread in the manner he originally expected, his setting fire to the decorations had, ultimately, caused the fire that destroyed the premises.)
“It’s frightfully windy today,” Mycroft noted, nodding at the lowering sun. “I am a bit concerned about that old tree coming down.”
They had each had some gifts to open, and the positively immense gift basket from Mycroft was displayed on the kitchen table. Even Sherlock, who had rolled his eyes and moaned petulantly about “showing off” when it had been delivered, had stopped grumbling when he noticed that the fruit, cheeses, and even the candies were all his favourites.
Sherlock had been holed up in the bedroom since the mobile toss, so hadn’t observed John’s activities. The doctor was fine with that, truth be told; sulky, stroppy Sherlock was getting on his nerves. He knew that all the attention Sherlock was receiving was precisely the sort of attention he abhorred. It had nothing to do with his brilliance, so he saw no purpose in it.
“Which, of course, you cannot. Your accusations are falsehoods, fabricated by you. And to what end? Some mistaken belief that what you are doing is a moral imperative? That by taking someone else down, you somehow lift yourself up? But how can this be? For by creating these stories, you have actually broken one of the commandments that you avow to uphold.” He sounded genuinely perplexed.
“That’s excellent news, my darling,” I told him, brushing the spray of crumbs off my jacket. I did not quite know at that point what his intent was. I knew it had something to do with detecting something at the scene of a crime, but every time I asked him to clarify himself, he would get caught up in his rambling explanations and I would be no closer to understanding what he was seeking than when he had begun. I knew that eventually he would explain (and demonstrate) all.
Finally, though, I took a great breath and patted the back of his hand. “My love,” I whispered, struggling to sit upright, “could you—now—I’d like some brandy, my darling.”
She was relieved to be greeted in the hallway by Christopher. There was something about his solid presence that was very comforting. As the man downstairs had done, he put a finger to his lips and pulled the door almost shut behind himself. He led the way into the room across the hall that still held the blanket fort.
I do not need to explain to you my shock and horror upon my discovery. I had been saddened to read of her passing—but of course you had abruptly moved away before that, without a word to anyone, which I found quite rude—and we had lost touch.
He paused and his sorrow was palpable. I shuddered in sympathy, thinking of my dear friend, whose body might have been separated from us by only one door, but whose mind was, at least at present, as distant as the stars. “Please, go on,” I said.
When Mycroft joined me earlier, he had been followed by the two largest attendants, and trailing behind them was the attendant we consider our friend—Henry.
“He might surprise us,” the elder brother commented. “I have always believed that geniuses of the arts—composers and painters and such—even if they are not seized with an illness such as my brother’s, when they are in the throes of creating, it is a similar state of mind.”
The outgoing nurse handed the new one a clipboard covered in notes. She reviewed the entire situation and Sherlock’s condition swiftly. It was apparent that they had worked together before. Mrs Parker was a bit surprised at the mixture of medical terminology and much softer words— “poor love” and “sweet boy” hardly seemed professional, but instead of making her uneasy, she found it reassuring. Clearly Winifred truly cared about her patient. Good. The new nurse listened intently and nodded, flipping through the sheets on the clipboard rapidly.
He hesitated a second, glancing towards the door with a frown. “Mmm…? he managed. From the notes she knew that he was able to form words sometimes, but it was still a struggle. From his tone she could tell that he was attempting to ask a question.
He tried to object. He tried to say something. He tried to pull his legs away from the burly man, but whatever he had taken had made him horribly uncoordinated. His reflexes didn’t seem to be working quite right. He felt a touch on his one free ankle now, but by the time he attempted to kick with it, or pull away, or anything, it was too late.
His brother had been wonderfully well-behaved for a while. After seeing the medical team out, the government man had seated himself stiffly in one of the kitchen chairs; he did not spend much time in that room, and he most certainly did not eat in there. Sherlock was seated at the table, rather stickily working on his toast. The room was bright and cheery and homely, and Sherlock looked surprisingly relaxed, even as he carefully pulled the marmalade-covered toast into bits and gingerly stuck them in his mouth. He had a wound inside one cheek—probably the result of a fist smashing the soft tissue into his teeth; he chewed very slowly and stopped entirely for a while when one dry lip cracked and began to bleed.
He refused to go to a tailor; all that measuring was just a bit creepy. No, he convinced his always-elegant mate that off-the-rack would be fine for him, and they had had a bit of fun deciding what would look best. They hadn’t bothered looking at the prices.
John had helped with the washing up and then they saw her out—she was headed to her sister’s to spend the night and Christmas Day.
Sherlock, who had just speared a Brussel sprout, froze, his fork halfway to his lips. As one might do when not desiring to frighten a wild animal, he remained still, his eyes wide.
He placed the books in a tidy stack on the floor, where Sherlock could easily reach them from the sofa.
Mycroft Holmes and I tried, in turn, to explain and defend our strict and cruel regimen. It was, not surprisingly, useless—primarily because it was all true. His accusations, so precisely articulated, made me ashamed, but even then I knew that we had done what needed to be done, and I tried in vain to explain that to him.
“So,” he continued, “I find that keeping the ‘Ten Commandments’ as laid out in the Christian Bible... and Torah... at the foremost of my thoughts a helpful tool during investigations. I believe the particular statement most relevant to the situation in front of us is from Exodus, Chapter 20, verse... sixteen. ‘Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.’” I admit, simultaneously with being impressed with his facility with the text—and its relevance to the situation—I was somewhat annoyed at how smug he sounded. I almost immediately discovered, however, that his attitude was both appropriate and well-earned.
“My darling, you must calm down. You have been quite overcome all day.” I stroked his cheek. “I realise that this has been quite an unsettling turn of events, but your reaction seems so strong.”
Mrs. Bloom apparently experienced the same epiphany as I had, but of course for her it was not a moment of victory. “’False...’” she managed, the word sticking in her throat like a fishbone.
“Holmes, we’re going to be dining rather late. I am certain that you will enjoy the music more if you have a bite now.”
His brother had, at the age of five, carefully and accurately recorded the stages of decomposition of a mouse he had found dead in a trap. He had experimented with the effects of various household cleaners on various bodily fluids—blood, saliva, and a few even more unpleasant ones—before his tenth birthday. He eschewed children’s books and preferred to read the newspaper when other children his age could barely manage a picture book. He used his plush animals to stage murder scenes and his worn, much-loved blanket had eventually been sacrificed to observe the comparative effects of three different types of acids. Sherlock had, in short, rejected and resisted a great deal of the trappings of childhood at an early age.
She nodded and looked up at Sherlock, who was standing directly behind me, looming over my shoulder. “Perhaps the doctor would like his medical bag?” she hinted.
Since he was a teen, really, his brother had been so terribly unhappy. His brilliance and observational skills, while a bit off-putting when he was a child, had not begun to actively affect his life or his sense of self until he hit puberty. That, combined with his realisation about his sexual orientation and the mess that was adolescence in general, had hit him hard. Neither Mycroft nor their parents liked to recall those years—the cutting, the lashing out, the withdrawal and depression, and eventually the drug use and associated criminal behaviour—it had been a low time for all of them. His first year at uni hadn’t been an improvement, even as Mycroft began stepping in more and more.
“You did really well with drawing and writing today. Do you think you could you do more? We really need to know where you’ve been and what’s happened to you. I understand that you’re having trouble speaking, but you can write formulas, and numbers. What about words?” He paused and swallowed. “God, Sherlock. We need more information. Can’t you draw it, or…
I nodded in agreement and, stepping through the dressing room and up to the door that had been locked behind my friend two days earlier. The attendants had been using this door to bring him his meals, rather than the one opening directly to the corridor, in the hopes that if he did attempt to escape, the intervening doors and furniture of our “sitting room” would hopefully slow his progress enough that someone would have some chance of stopping him.
It took him the next half-hour (managing rolling crayons with shaking hands was a bit tricky), but when he was done, all sixty-four crayons were arranged meticulously by colour.
“You seem to have him well in hand for the moment, Doctor Watson. I am sorry to say this, but I must take my leave of you now. There is urgent business which requires my attention. I will return after breakfast.”
“Can we just stay like this until I am sure that you are really home again and you know that I am truly sorry for what I said?”
Sherlock proceeded to describe his brother—his observational powers that rivalled and even surpassed my friend’s; his almost impossibly energetic lifestyle. His ability to function on no more than four hours of sleep a night. The great ambition that had led to his unique position in the government. His erratic schedule and lifestyle. In short, yes, when I was finally permitted to reveal the existence of Mycroft Holmes, many years later, I obscured all but a very few facts about the man by essentially reversing them. And so my readers know about a Mycroft Holmes who is corpulent and unambitious; who is sedentary and habitual to the extreme. I was permitted to include a few truths—his observational skills truly do exceed Sherlock’s in many ways, he truly is seven years his senior, and the existence of the Diogenes Club is a fact (that is, of course, not its true name nor its location, but otherwise it does exist exactly as I have described) were the extent of it. Mycroft is not even the name by which he is known.
“I am so sorry, my dear lady,” I murmured, “but I must ascertain if you have broken any bones in your foot. This is going to be quite painful.” I saw no reason to prevaricate.
Sherlock remained seated for some time after the door shut. I tidied the table and tucked the card, which bore no name but an address, into my desk. Finally, I could bear it no longer. I sat back down, leaning forward toward my friend.
?” she said a bit sharply. “I rarely have the opportunity to sit down, let alone put my feet up, until the supper washing up is done. You two create as much work as a household with ten children.”
As the weather warms and spring arrives in England as it always does—tentatively, as if it was taking itself by surprise—I am occasionally caught in a light rain, and the feel of the mist on my face brings me there. There on the precipice of the Reichenbach Falls—wanting to peer over the edge into the chasm but knowing that that would be foolhardy.
Clearly this idea tickled him, and he said it so comically—with a theatrical wrinkle of his nose—that I had to laugh. “I shall enjoy blowing the whistle, but I expect a coin for my efforts,” I responded, relieved that his spirits seemed to be lifting.
“He sleeps so little, but I do try to get him to lie down every night, beginning at eleven o’clock,” I explained. Of course, we could have no clock or watch in our rooms—I could picture all the gears scattered across the carpet—but there was a clock somewhere in the house that chimed out the hours. I had also made a point of opening and closing the curtains, keeping to regular times for meals, and other cues to help anchor him a bit. Mycroft’s own valet came in each morning—with two attendants—to shave both of us. Sherlock does not need to shave every morning (despite the thick curls on his head, he truly has very little success anywhere else) but I insisted that he at least try to sit still long enough for the man to attempt it. I admit to rather enjoying these morning ablutions and to growing rather spoiled during that time by not having to wield the blade myself.
How could I respond to this? I can ponder this now, but in the midst of our discussion, I admit that I responded by instinct, and I am not proud of my answer. “I’m afraid I would,” I admitted.
The volley of words; the barrage of insults and pleadings and the recounting of warrantless fears—all of that is something that I do not wish to record. Perhaps after some time passes, I will have the strength.
The nurse who came for the evening shift was full-figured, with lovely coffee-coloured skin and dark brown hair in meticulous rows of braids. Her brown eyes sparkled as she strode confidently into the bedroom.
Little boys could get lost if they weren’t careful. It was a good thing that Big Brother was there with him.
Oh, yes, my escape. I withdrew my handkerchief from my pocket and blotted the perspiration from my face and considered what had occurred that had compelled my retreat.
But then he gave me a small smile and explained. “Your moustache tickles,” he reported, “and you missed that spot that you always do when you shave.” He grabbed my hand and held it against his own cheek. “But my face is smooth for days at a time.”
“Thank you.” Greg sat back, tore the paper off, and opened the thin cardboard box. “Hey, nice! Thanks!” he said sincerely at the sight of the elegant grey shirt and matching tie.
“I am afraid so. Mr. Harper and I went ‘round to his neighbours’ house. Unfortunately, the family was away from home at that time, but I did observe that their garden boasted several rose bushes.”
She shook her head. “He’s been to hell and back. I wonder… I mean… do you think he’ll ever get back to normal?”
“When the waiter came ‘round with the tea, you were discussing... well, persuading Mrs. Bloom not to make a fuss about the temperature of the water, and so both of you were distracted. I was looking directly at Mr. Bloom, and he at the waiter, and his reaction, though slight, was noticeable.”
“Oh, for God’s sake. Do keep up. I hate repeating myself,” was the scathing reply. Greg noted his rather odd features—razor-sharp cheekbones, full, pale lips, and the intense eyes were almond-shaped and set wide apart.
He delivered this information in such a serious manner that it was droll. It broke my gloomy mood and I smiled. “Rather fussy, or impossible?” I asked.
