Tony waited ten boring minutes outside the hell hole before approaching it again.  All was quiet below.  Out of spite, he kicked a couple tiny rocks into it, then panicked, imagining the world’s mightiest heroes drowning in his own errant science experiment.  “Cap?” he called.  “
Tony looked at him flatly.  “Yes, Steve,” he said, before looking out at the field.  “It’s Socrates.  Means ‘get off my back.’”
Nothing about the rest of their lives was easy, but this was.  This was, Tony sighed, eyes shut, holding onto what mattered.
,” he said, the meaning of the words finally sinking in, turning to face him more fully.  “Sweetheart—I couldn’t do this without you,” he said.  At Tony’s genuinely confused frown, he added, “I’d be stuck on that pier all night.”
Tony seemed floored by the remark, genuinely leveled, in a way that Steve felt strange witnessing.  Before he could rise to Tony’s cautious defense—
“What a terrible thing to say,” Tony said.  At Rhodes’ confused look, Tony elaborated, “I always thought of fairytales as rather idyllic.  Mine’s rather a nightmare.”
real.  That’s you.  Puny, human—fallible you.  I’ve been there.  Done that.  All the money in the world can’t save you if you don’t have the right
again, but without a starship in their immediate solar neighborhood, the humble tricorder could not link to an open channel.  The
Tony shook his head to clear the morning fog, then looked around the shuttle.  “Must’ve been a hell of a ringer.  I don’t even remember the party.”
Steve limped upstairs.  He did miss the elevators at the Avengers Tower sometimes, but it was hard to deny the charm of a Brooklyn brownstone.
“Me, next,” Clint chimed in, bouncing along out front.  Clint Barton belonged in a circus—the man who would not expire.  There was an honest-to-God
There was a soft hiss, and then Romanova stepped completely out of her spacesuit.  Stovok did the same.  Tony lingered a moment, uncertain—returning to the ship had some appeal, especially after the misadventures on Nibiru—but the thought of Stovok with Thor or, God forbid,
“To be fair, Pepper is probably even more likely to take the shot than you,” Tony muttered.  “Maybe we should—”
Breathing in harshly, Tony exhaled and said, “No.  You don’t.”  Pushing himself off the wall, he made himself step closer.  It was like approaching a gravity well.  He knew he could get too close, could not even see that line.  But he could not show fear, either.  “You don’t know
He tried the handle; it opened.  Pushing the door open, he was equal parts surprised and amused to see Tony still sound asleep.  Steve almost closed the door on reflex, then rallied, reminding himself,
Carter looked around his bunk room—it wasn’t much, but it was his space home—and frowned.  “Where is Commander Stovok?” she asked.
“You clean up nice, big fella,” Tony acknowledged, turning to him and gesturing at his maroon overcoat.  “Digging the red.”
“Eh, shuddup,” Steve muttered, more on autopilot than mean-spirited rebuke, finishing off the bite and rolling up another ball.  “You’re nothin’ but trouble, Stark.”
“You can’t force her,” Tony reminded pointlessly.  Until Steve had proven him wrong, Tony—like everyone else—had not thought it was even possible to ride a dragon.  Bristling with anger, Steve stood no chance of earning her cooperation.
“I thought we were going to Alaska,” Steve observed, watching rain fall in gray, grizzly sheets over the tarmac.
“Aye,” Thor replied, taking the interruption with more magnanimity than Steve would have expected.  He supposed being alive for—however long Thor had apparently been alive for, might grant one the patience to deal with such things.  “Huge beasts.  Like wolves, but large enough to saddle and ride.  Only the bravest may try to.  The warg is known to dismember its prey in a . . . most abhorrent manner.  My father says they were created by his father’s father, to carry on his rule after his death.  I am grateful my own father has been more lenient.  My great-great-father would not have allowed an intermingling of our people,” Thor acknowledged.
Steve stepped towards him, then said clearly, “Tony.”  Tony flinched like he was startled and trying not to show it.  He had always been an open book, but Steve did his best to keep the sympathy out of his tone as he offered up, “On your left.”
In retaliation, Steve passed him the eggbeater.  Tony puffed up his chest, rolled up his sleeves, and said, “Joke’s on you, I am
“Hundred-and-thirty-seven, officer,” Clint replied.  “Didn’t mean to disturb your evening—we’re on Avengers business.”
They followed the newcomer across the field, approaching a small village.  Allowing the newcomer to lead at a healthy distance, Tony walked alongside Stovok.
“Vital signs for Master Stark are critical,” informed the same disembodied voice, filling the room in a strange way.  “Please respond accordingly.”
The anger came boiling back, but he kept a lid on it, his grip tightening on his shield until the leather creaked.
Sure, there was still a fucking mess to deal with, Thanos, their decidedly dual and separate lives—but there was time.
“We are representatives of a peacekeeping organization,” Stovok danced, refusing to give away too much.
Steve dropped to the ground.  Tony flinched, then turned to face him.  Flicking the hat off Tony’s head, Steve caught it in hand.  “Is this a future thing?” Steve asked, genuinely curious.
, but old habits died awful hard—he knew Tony Stark was a covetous man, but to slaughter four of the magnificent creatures on an idle whim seemed atrocious.  “
Steve looked pointedly around Tony’s shoulder, at Snow.  Then he looked at Tony, whose voice shook with anger as he said, “No, you fucking
Sojef nodded in thanks.  “Your Commander.  It hearkens us to see that Starfleet has called upon Vulcans to serve in such high stations.  Their wisdom can only be of value.”
“She ran away,” Steve explained, his words carefully devoid of emotion.  Tony stared at him blankly.
Had he died?  Was this the grim reality of the next life?  He chafed a hand over his arm, but it did not feel real to him.
“Pretty sure I’ve got at least two Stooges who’ll keep an eye on me.”  He paused at his door, then clasped hands with his brother-in-arms.  “I know who to call if I get stuck in the middle of celestial nowhere.”
, Steve thought, feeling a wave of nostalgia for the days when everyone wanted to show him how telephones worked.
At that, Steve failed to stifle a disbelieving snort.  Bruce and Thor both looked away from the zookeeper feeding the hippo to regard him.  Steve waved them off.  Then he frowned, noticing the missing member from their party.  “Where’s Natasha?”
He turned to his team.  He was sure the fear was written on his face before he managed the words: “What do we do?”
Tony moaned.  “Darling, I’ll marry you for the heating pad.”  It was agony to shift onto his side so Steve could lay it down, but then he settled onto it.  As the warmth slowly seeped into his muscles, he sighed.
Tony stepped up to plate, scooping up the bat and pulling another tennis ball out of his pocket.  “You can keep that, Thor,” Tony advised.  Thor pocketed his prize, looking very pleased.  “As for the rest of you losers—”
There was an innocence to the way Stovok drew, a certain lack of self-consciousness, that ached in Tony, reminded him of piles of crumpled digital paper consigned to the digital trash bin.  Stovok made each brush stroke without fearing what would happen, without regard for what could go wrong in the pursuit of something beautiful.  He simply
Thor growled ominously.  Tony released the singed toy bear and ducked behind Steve for protection.  Sighing, Steve focused on the immediate problem and said loudly, “Thor.”  The god of thunder snored on.  “
“The Unknown Earth,” Tony mused.  “Dammit, that’s good.”  Slapping a hand on Stovok’s shoulder, Tony nearly faltered at the pure white contentment radiating from him, then pushed himself to his feet anyway.  “Now you’re thinking like a Captain.”
In the end, only Clint earned the fabled “Banned for Life” title.  Thor was a hero; Bruce was simply a key witness.
With an almost visible reigning in of his own emotions, Thor stood at his full height and reached for his collar.  He then peeled back his armor and handed it to Barton, who staggered under the weight.  “Guard this.”
was dying in his arms, and what he had done, what had he done?  He couldn’t understand it, Tony looking at him with wide-eyed
“You know, for a genius, you can be a little dense sometimes,” Steve muttered, fishing out his room key, miraculously keeping his cargo on his back.
He seemed like the guy to do that kind of thing, real tough guy, the kind of guy who never cried because crying was for—
P.S. What Steve calls "Brontosaurs" are actually sauropods, AKA those lovely long-necked dinosaurs! The Carnegie is home to a
Tony shook his head, then reached for Steve’s toast and took a big bite.  “This is the driest thing I have ever had in my mouth.”
“Captain America eats free in this establishment,” Jeanie said kindly, handing him a small square box.  “Thought you might like that for the road.”
, calling for paramedics, and then a rough hand grabbed his own, planted it over the arc reactor, and Pierce asked, “What the hell are you doing?”
Tony thumbed the strange Rorschach blotch on the front of Steve’s hoodie.  Steve looked at it critically.  “. . . Is that what it is?”
That, and grooming themselves.  Even though dogs were louder and more energetic and all around great fun, Steve could see what Tony
Steve gave Tony a stern look.  “Dear, you’re making it hard on him,” Tony volunteered.  “He’s trying.”
“It’s a skirmish,” the human—Barnes, Tony realized, trying to get a good look at him, but his back was to Tony, and Stovok’s memory did not allow him to move, watching the scene as an outsider.  “It’s just a show of force.  They’ll back down once they see what Starfleet is all about.”
“I can’t be the priority here,” Tony mused, unable to help but be a provocateur.  He nodded at Dr. Banner, curled on his side, facing away from them.  “Surely, the Senior Medical Officer is—”
Thor sauntered up to first base, a big, satisfied smile on his face.  He scooped up the tennis ball and made to pocket it.  “Give it here, big guy,” Clint called out, whistling, and Thor chucked the ball to him, far less violently than Steve would have expected.  Fast learner.
By the third stick, he felt almost hypnotized.  “This is way cooler than the President,” he murmured.
“Like hell it will,” Tony hissed, reaching for the Swiss Army knife in his boot, using it to cleave off a strip from his undershirt.  He reached out automatically to brace it against the wound, but Stovok intercepted him, taking the cloth himself and pressing it there firmly.  His expression did not change, but Tony thought he looked paler in the overcast light, almost wan.  “. . . How bad is it?”
Tony nudged his hip again with his own foot, then groaned and made a show of shuffling over, settling next to him with his ballcap still drawn low.  Steve kissed the top of his head, lips cool even through the cap, and then returned to his drink.  Tony swiped it from him, donating it to the sleeping Bruce fund, and said, “We can’t tell them.”
“Good girl,” Tony reflected.  He could not bring himself to let go of Steve.  “I’m sorry,” he managed.
“Deny your delusions and substitute them with my own?”  At Steve’s blank look, Tony shrugged and said, “Yeah, probably.  But it’s hard to break an old man’s heart.”
Shaking his head, Tony said, “Don’t be.  Don’t be.”  He withdrew his hand; Steve let him go.  “See, this is what I mean, I’m
family—so deep in his own head he barely looked out the window and wondered about the people on the streets—and caught up to Thor.  “You didn’t tell me about the storm you got caught up in,” Steve prompted, and Thor tossed a companionable arm around his shoulders, as though to arrest Steve’s ability to abandon the story midway, and said jovially:
He might have screamed when he turned and came face-to-face with the world’s muddiest Vulcan, but at least Stovok did not comment on the pitch.  “You scared the
“Pickup lines?” Steve said, feigning ignorance, torn between morbid curiosity and future blackmail.  A slightly more sober Tony might have called him out on the lie, but the distracted, head-nodding version merely said:
It was a better place.  Underground—literally—an old speakeasy, updated and full of fresh, futurian faces.  The music was not bad.  Still rankled like it was supposed to, attention-getting, noisy, nothing like anything that came before it.  Fast blues—with a bit of that growly bite that reminded Steve they were not in the deep South but Chicago, where Chicago blues were born.
“That’s the thing.  They’re not really aliens.  Not to us.”  When Romanova and Stovok both looked at him, Tony leaned back and clarified, “They’re
?” Tony echoed out loud.  “We were gone for two days.”  He looked at Stovok expectantly.  Stovok did not look at him, eyes trained on Captain Carter’s Personal Access Display Device.  An unseemly frisson of jealousy flickered across Tony’s chest as he watched the two of them.  Vulcans never breached decorum—never elicited
Marker quieted for a moment, then backed out of the room.  “Good boy,” Tony whispered, only to eat his words as Marker then shouldered his way, loudly and unapologetically, through the doorframe.  “
“Why,” Steve grunted, standing in a far too brightly lit ice cream parlor at midnight and glaring at a lineup of jars—including those peanuts he was lookin’ for earlier, although-God-only-knew-why, his brain was on two cylinders and both were in danger of falling off.
on it.  He had heard stories of people who said, someday, mankind would walk on the Moon, but the idea of it, peering up at that strange glowing light, was so bewildering, so strange, but looking at it now, looking at it now!  He wanted to take everyone on the streets by the shoulders, shove the picture on the front page, the Moon was right there!  More barren and beautiful than he possessed words for.  He strained to make out something, anything, describable in a familiar way, a color or texture or sound, maybe, but there was nothing, nothing but the stillness and emptiness and blackness of space surrounding the strange, strange Moon.
“My father was human,” Stovok acknowledged.  “He was a security officer in the Kzin-Earth Wars.  He lived to see the turning point: the development of faster-than-light travel.  It proved the decisive end to the war.  And,” he paused meaningfully, “it permitted the eventual regular contact between Terrans and Vulcans.”
“I should impress,” interrupted J.A.R.V.I.S., in a rare moment of overriding urgency, “that Mr. Stone left the premises with a secondary heat signature.”
He was also born half-Vulcan.  Shaking his head to himself, Tony startled when a white hand jutted out of the hole in the ground expectantly.
, Tony thought, taking stock.  The scar tissue around his chest ached—a year’s old wound that would never heal completely, but let it never be said it infirmed him—but the rest of him was warm.  “Alive,” he reported dutifully.
“Here’s what we’re gonna do,” Tony said, voice calm, not at all alarmed.  And he put everything aright.
Steve watched the drama unfold for a moment, then grunted as Tony crashed into him.  “What are you doing here, get outta here, you idiot,” Tony said, shooing him off the plate.
sing-song.  His heart was pounding.  He could not believe they were having this talk.  It all felt wrong inside him.
Tony almost felt he had not earned the privilege, even as Steve granted it.  Tony Stark’s hands had hurt people.  They had ripped a gash in his own chest that only the arc reactor could fill.  They had done so much harm in the search for good that he hesitated to extend them, to simply
“You’re lucky Rushman used your card,” Happy said, sitting at picnic table, eating a paper-wrapped cheeseburger with one hand, his other wrapped in a black splint.  “Made it easy to track.  I had to catch a redeye, you know.  God only knew what city you’d be in next.”
“Don’t start with me,” Steve said shortly.  He knew she was serious.  He hated that she was serious.  Maria Hill might not even rub his nose in his concession, but he would not need her to: he would never forgive himself for holing up in a S.H.I.E.L.D.-appointed room, absorbing the future one baby step at a time, coddled on all sides by good intentions, all because he found life on the outside too—too
“Something-something-bears-something,” Clint replied, tugging on the line.  “Go fuck yourself, I’m fishing.”
“You can call it whatever you want, kid,” Steve huffed, sitting on the ground, legs stretched out in front of him.  “Just don’t ask me to sign it.”
” he added, irked, when Steve nudged him again.  Tony pocketed his telephone, then looked around, before shrugging.  “Taking a nice long ride on a park bench, ever heard of it?”
Only then would the original sedimentary fibers—the tortured muscle, the broken bedrock bone, and the ripped open blood vessels—metamorphose into a stable compound, a compound capable of flexing but not fracturing under the heat and pressures of which they were tormented by for three months.
There was nothing but quiet breathing from the couch for a long time.  Tony waited.  He wondered what he was waiting to hear.
Steve felt every one of his twenty-six years, looking upon a group of young Amish men jesting with Tony Stark over his distinctive facial hair, comparing it to their longer beards.  Tony stood comfortably with them, no mask, no cover, just a guy eating a homemade peanut butter and jelly sandwich, explaining between bites that he kept his beard trimmed to remain unmarried forever.  The men around him laughed.
Thor chose to sit with Tony, which meant that Steve had to make the trek to fetch Clint.  Normally, he believed in a woman’s right to strike her own path—his mother had struck her own path, after all, striking out first to America alongside Joseph, her young husband, only to be stranded alone in the city after he had been killed in the last breath of the first Great War, and boy, wasn’t it a shame there was a second?  “Not that a woman can’t walk alone,” he prefaced, but Natasha just said:
Tony reached for the bucket, plucked another strawberry off the top, shined it on his cardigan.  “So, selfish is
Then Thor spared him from further dilemma by stealing the basket, and Steve grimly waited for the future King of Everything to have his fill.  Just because Steve was de facto leader of the Avengers did not mean he had supreme authority.  Getting one’s hand bit was very different from getting one’s hand
Tony stared at him frankly.  Then he gulped down another mouthful of coffee, grimaced, and said, “Terrible.”
He jerked upright just in time to be forcefully sucked out of existence, reappearing in the comparatively blinding white light of a standard teleporter room.
There was a pause.  Then Natasha reached for the envelope, slid out the cards, and began turning them face-up on the table.
“You know,” Steve said softly, “I remember when they first built this place.  They talked about it.  In the papers.
They listened to the crickets for a while, the intermittent clicks of dragons, the quiet wintry night.  It was cool enough for Christmas sweaters, but not so cold Tony could not bear to sit outside.
Steve sighed, but he took a bite, then tried and failed to suppress a smile.  Tony ribbed, “See, I told you.”
Stovok just blinked at him, like it had not occurred to him.  “I could do this all day,” Stovok said, flexing his hand.  “Whether you wish to is another matter.”
—was not like ice water.  It was simply a ticking clock on the wall, counting towards midnight.  “I miss you.”
Clint shrugged, then stepped aside.  “Brute force, that’s one way.  Hey, Cap’s here, put the booze away!” he added to the rest of the room, waving the six-pack intentionally.
As soon as he was seated, Tony sighed and dropped the pole.  Then he patted Marker beside a huge black eye.  “Good boy,” he rasped.  “Good boy.”
, everyone knew that Steve Rogers was a terrific fighter who could break every bone in his arm and grimly acquiesce to have it reset without a drop of anesthetic.  Steve Rogers was not nearly shattered by the simple offer of a metabolically dense cocktail that just might last long enough to numb the hurt.
“I’m sorry we’ll miss it,” Steve said truthfully, giving Coleman his attention again.  “We’re just passing through.”
The gang's all here! 🐼❤️ Thanks for reading! I can already bet you know what we're headed next, but we'll be hitting up some real attractions shortly. Stay tuned, and have a fantastic day!
He sniffed at a hollyhock plant, but it yielded nothing; disappointed, he moved on to a honey-scented phlox.
Tony gave him a very flat look.  “Yes, Steve,” he said, which caught Steve more off-guard than anger would have.  He lifted up a hand, fingers poised.  “With just a snap of my fingers, I can fix everything.”
appeared to be an understatement.  Even from a distance, Dr. Banner’s face was bright red; his blue uniform was navy with sweat.  “I shall retrieve him,” Stovok announced.
Tony nodded slightly in understanding, but Stovok looked disturbed.  It took a great deal of strength for Tony not to tap Stovok’s foot with his own, a wordless query.  Vulcans were very proper, especially in foreign company.  Even among friends, they were hardly considered effervescent people.  Stovok would likely retreat as far inward as need be to impress that he was not affected at all.  So Tony willed himself to be patient and ask questions
.  The young purple dragon blinked back at the camera, her flat look matching Bruce’s.  For a long moment, Tony feared that Bruce would assume it was a terrible joke, sending him another dragon.
They covered at least a quarter of a mile around a ninety-foot stretch of land, zigging and zagging between home and first base.  Like a hound chasing a hare, Steve lost ground on the turns, nearly losing his footing every time.  After the second fall, he realized he might actually be outmatched by a seasoned spy who had grown naturally into his stature.  It did not want to compute—he was
Tony swiveled around the support beam until he was hugging it upside-down.  Steve’s heart began to gallop.  He shouted, “Tony!” but Tony let go.
and add a hint of cigar smoke, and the impression would be perfect.  “I haven’t committed to anything at all,” Steve insisted.
“It won’t kill him,” Steve assured, sitting next to and patting a defeated-looking Bruce on the back.
Steve did not deserve to see Tony Stark, so bare, so unnerved.  The armor kept creeping over him, inching to cover everything back up, but through seemingly conscious exertion, he kept it from closing in, trapping tubes and wires.  “Must be exhausting,” Steve noted.
, he had called the beast, and Gravemarker had accepted his new name, responded to every cheerless and loving alternative Tony had come up with.
“What?” he managed.  “They haven’t—I would’ve—”  He stumbled over the words, because aside from his cat nap, he hadn’t once fallen prey to potential manipulation.  He liked to think Stovok would surely rouse if intruders came, but the Vulcan sleep was deep.  He could very well have slept through such a manipulation.  Horror struck him.  “Did they steal our kidneys?” he hissed.
They were back in the car before Ashley Coleman hailed them, Jeremiah and Ezekiel in tow.  “I got it,” Steve assured, stepping out, not missing the way Tony relaxed.
Instead, he froze as a strange fuzzy noise filled his head, and he felt not the thoughts themselves but the shape of them, a yellowish glow that radiated joy tinted a somber blue that radiated worry . . . deep, stormy purple, dismayed, unsure, followed by waves of green—green like grass, green like a world he had never seen.
got Captain Killjoy’s attention: he popped out of the oven to look at the clatter, and Tony took a chance, grabbing him by the back of the collar and giving a hard
Steve rolled his eyes, then dumped Lucky on the ground.  Lucky landed on his feet and bolted for Iron Man, who shot back into the air.  “Not a fan of dogs?”
“Perhaps this is the golden egg that will bring more harm than good,” Stovok replied quietly.  At Tony’s surprised look, he added, “I have read many Terran fairytales.  It has been part of my . . . cultural education.”
Stovok inhaled a long breath through his nose, more annoyed than worried.  “Vulcans do not take carnal pleasures lightly,” he said at last.
Kicking another small pile of gravel, Tony was quiet for a moment, already feeling the exertion in his chest.  They were twenty steps from the bike.  Was this what it had been like, he wondered, to be the one with the ruptured skull, the fractured leg, dragged alongside for miles, weeks, a lifetime, all in the name of survival?  Grimly, Tony shuffled along in silence, conserving his energy.  He could hear the slight huff in his own breath, the way his body struggled to survive when so much of the core machinery had been compromised.
“Well,” Tony said, pretending to count on his fingers.  “Are we or aren’t we counting Jimmy?  I promised him,
“Who said I can’t keep them?” Tony muttered.  “Pull off here,” Tony instructed, pointing at an upcoming branch in the road.  “We’re not hitting rush hour traffic, I’ve got a plan.”
“I wish I were kidding.”  Tony conjured up the blue map and showed them a red line connecting two points.  “It’s a gimmick store.  For children.  Of which Barton is the target demographic.  Oooh,” he purred, collapsing the map.  “We’re not that far from an ice cream parlor.
“They’re also kind of hellbent on keeping the Fountain of Youth away from the Federation,” Tony finished.
“As you should,” Thor chuckled.  “Come.  You will like it down there.  Far less . . . disagreeable, than this wretched transport vessel.”
, he almost wanted to cry, and then, unexpectedly, he found a straw at his lips, and he sucked gratefully at cold water.  “It’s okay.  You’re in good hands.”  It was such a cliché—the
Tony pushed hard enough he could have shoved Steve right off the bench if he did not plant his own feet.  “Dammit, Tony,” he complained, unfolding and throwing his hood back to glare at Tony properly.  Without a word, Tony slid back until they were not touching at all, and Steve felt cold and disappointed.  “What do you want?” he repeated neutrally.
.  He just has . . . mixed, results.  Uh, you.  Times Square.  That.  I would not have done that.”  Getting up, he muttered to himself, “Where’s the
Hunching into a chair by the far wall, he kept his shoulder to the wall, his hand over the emptiness in his chest, and waited to be dragged away.  With words or hands, it did not matter; it would come.
During his U.S.O. days, Steve had learned a lot about Chicago.  Advertised as the third largest city in the United States of America, it had been the ultimate manufacturing hub in the Midwest, churning out everything from foodstuffs to steel goods, pharmaceuticals and petroleum.  Chicago had always had an exciting history: it had burned to the ground (1871), hosted the World’s Fair (1893), and come under new management during the Great Depression, led by two gangsters known in polite company as Gentleman John and Snorky.
, holding his breath as the newcomers passed within meters, rustling trees, hooting softly, almost in amusement.
?  What in the world for?”  He wanted to throw his hands into the air, but it would have felt stupid.  Already, loathe though he was to admit it, the stupid bucket trick had worked.  He reached for the anger, but his clothes were soaked and his men were not fooled by him, at all.  He could put the fear of God in them, but other than that, he had no bucket left to stand on.  He sighed.  “All right, so I haven’t been the
, Steve thought, turning to face it head-on, barely gasping with alarm when Thor reached out automatically to touch the small, pointy head, gripping Thor’s arm to stop him.  “Don’t touch,” he managed.
Natasha knocked on the door.  Steve saw his reflection scowl, and purposefully let go of his anger, let it be less mean.  He could be nice.  He was nice all the time, life just kicked dirt on him.
“I’m just a sucker for a fluffy white cottontail,” Tony said conclusively, drawing Steve from his thoughts.
Steve looked at the decapitated Stark standing outside the open car door, hands on his hips.  “I think he means, he wants coffee,” Steve judged.
Cap Bird stared grimly down on them, silently enforcing Tony’s doctrine with all the might that a red-white-and-blue plague doctor could bring to bear, while Iron Man signed twenty-seven hoods with a very careful
“You ever shut up?” Steve asked, not meanly, but perhaps a little less nicely than he might have when the sun was still up.  Buck had always said he was mean after dark, but Steve had thought that that was a disservice to his equally mean sunny-side-up personality.
“Hugh Hefner defined a generation.  Several generations.  His art was revolutionary for its time.”  Sliding a fresh cup of coffee away from the machine, Tony paced away, tapping at his telephone.  “C’mon, it’s five minutes.  Don’t tell Barton there’s a Secret Agent Supply Store less than three miles from here.”
Then he turned to look at Steve, lying beside Tony, feigning sleep.  Steve’s eyes were closed, and his breath rose and fell evenly, but Tony knew he was awake, like he knew the sun would rise again.  Tony also knew that Marker was alive and well, and that Tony would find him, because these were the unshakable truths.
Finally, he stood, intending to leave him be, let him recover in peace.  But Tony rasped, “You lied.”
“No, it’s about keeping Barton off my back,” Tony said, fishing in a pocket and pulling out his telephone.  He tapped energetically at it for a few seconds, then pocketed it again.  “You know what’s wild?  It would actually be cheaper to strip a car for parts than acquire them individually.”
Steve said, “I’ll be back,” and dared to abandon Tony with his journal as he refilled the slot in the machine.  The hose sprayed Thor in the face, but he laughed in uproarious contentment, then sprayed the Hulk, who thumped the ground emphatically in delight.
He found Marker sunning himself in the grass.  “There’s my big beautiful nightmare,” Tony greeted, holding Thallium under one arm for safe-keeping.  She did not bite.  He might have a favorite.
Steve almost could not believe that somebody had convinced Tony to traverse the final crawl, which involved a harrowing traverse through a thirty-six-inch crawlspace with a three-inch river flushing through it, but goddamn.
It did weird things to Tony’s heart, was what it did.  He coughed to distract himself.  Stovok finally acknowledged him: “I am in the middle of something important.  Does your quest supersede it?”
Steve shook his head.  He crossed the floor and pushed open the bedroom door.  The bed was neatly made.  His few belongings had been looted—no clothes in the closet, not even the old clock.  It felt like a ghost’s home.
He looked up at a bodily thump, but Clint had already stepped back to give Tony room to get up.  Tony did—albeit gingerly, trying to hide the stiffness in his bones.  Steve suppressed a friendly jibe.
He had the sudden, impressive feeling of spiders crawling all over him.  Little pinprick legs skittering right by.  He curled up tighter, fearful and nauseous.  He felt like he was going to die.
After parking the car on the shoulder of the road, Steve parked himself under a tree and watched Clint and Tony continue to squabble.  After a minute, they realized they had more breathing room, got out of the car, and resumed bickering, now with added pushing and shoving.
“A lady can’t play cards in her spare time?” Natasha asked, in that sweet, deflecting tone of hers, that told him he was too close and yet so far from answers.
,” Tony ordered, snapping his fingers and pointing at the TV.  Almost on cue, a seal popped out of the snow.  “You
.  The world was Steve’s oyster, in his fancy new body.  He could, if he so desired, hike the entire Appalachian trail.
, a strange twinge in his chest that made his world stutter to a weird shimmering halt, like a take in a movie had been called to a halt.  All Cap’s focus broke: he looked at Tony, gaze hard for a fraction of a second before it softened, his jaw a hard line even as he asked in the same gentle undertone, “Tony?”
“Mr. Stark” waved a hand, stepping into the war room and weaving a little.  “Could be lying on a beach.  Drinking a Saurian brandy.  Consider my generosity logged.  What’s the sitch?”
took a while.  Tony gnawed on a knuckle to distract himself from the deep ache in his back, unsure how he was going to survive the next
Now supremely self-conscious, Steve took a big bite of his toast, chewing slowly enough that he hoped Tony would lose interest in his answer and move on.
“OK, I changed my mind,” Steve said decisively, pointing at the exact same mountain Tony had indicated earlier.  “First one to the top gets a lollipop.”
Tony sighed, “Just arrest him.”  The cop’s light swished to the backseat, landed pointedly on Tony.  Lingered.  “You’d be doing us a favor,” Tony explained.  The cop scanned the rest of the car with his flashlight, before returning to Clint.
“We will have to lure them out of the Briar Patch for negotiations,” Captain Carter said, sounding grim.  “Or manually overtake them.  Klingons are not known for trades.”
He nearly fell out of his own chair in haste, ignoring Stovok’s sharp look, as he reached for his own chest, the distinct lack of scarring spinning the wheel at last into motion.
Steve scowled.  His eye still throbbed a little, but he could see just fine.  When Thor lobbed the tennis ball in the air, Steve knew with a certainty bordering on premonition where it was going.
look.  It was Steve’s fault: coffee was leverage.  He had bestowed it upon his team, and now, he had no leverage against them.  Why should they listen to him?
“Our strength is at its potential peak,” Stovok said patiently.  “Now is the time.”  He then looked meaningfully at the hole in the ground.
“I’d look good in gold, too.  Maybe throw in some hotrod red,” Tony said.  “But I don’t want to call you
“Had to make a pitstop,” Natasha explained, holding up a package of long sticks.  “Hope I’m not too late.”
“That’s without stops,” Tony added.  He met Steve’s gaze in the rearview mirror.  “I’ve allocated one rest stop.”
At Steve’s disgruntled but not mad demeanor, he even tucked an arm around Steve’s elbow—Steve, unsurprisingly, allowed it—and squeezed hard, a brief but sincere half-hug.  “My big dork,” he disclaimed.
Steve frowned.  “How can you tell?”  There was not even the tell-tale scent of rain in the air, never mind the clear skies.
“For the last time: we are not going to starve,” Tony said, very firmly.  “We’re going to get food poisoning.”
Tony Stark, meanwhile, had a far less relaxed gait, consciously swaggering, very upright.  There was a rhythm to his walk, no hint of a stumble, despite the audible hitch underlying every fourth breath or so.  He did not seem consciously aware of it.  Steve doubted most people would ever notice it.
Tony made a motion like he was thinking about it, bobbing his head back and forth.  “Counter-offer: no.”
There were four of them, three of whom approached briefly but stuck to Linda.  The last, a small, cream-colored alpaca, decided Steve was a safe, trustworthy type, after all, and pushed against him until he sat on the ground, folding onto his lap.
—might not be the same place he had heard about, after all.  But then Tony affirmed, “Uh, yeah.  It’s a bit brisk.”
He skidded to a halt, but the whole damn tribe looked up at him, anyway, rows of black eyes in chalk-white faces.  Many had spears.  They surrounded the prone Vulcan, ghostly white and unmoving, like acolytes surrounding an altar.
“It has been . . . a long time since I have taken a leave-of-absence.  So much has happened.  So few of my people have volunteered their services.”  Inclining his head, he acknowledged, “Yet, there are others, who could serve in the roles.”
Tony shook his head, then turned towards the house.  Wordlessly, he limped towards it.  When Marker finally clicked after him, Tony snapped, “Oh, you can fucking
biographies—twice as many as Tony Stark, but Tony had been alive half as long; he still had time—and every one had tried to capture the enigmatic magnetism that Steve exuded.
Which was a dumb thought.  He had had a hole the size of Texas in his side.  And while the food had smelled promising, his appetite had been annihilated by the dust caked on his tongue, the exhaustion gluing his eyelids shut.  If a Chitauri soldier had busted down the door, he might not have been able to pick himself up and soldier on.
“What is this place?” Thor finally asked, as Bruce stood outside the gates, wringing his hands like he would be asked at any moment to recite every indecency that had ever been conducted inside its pristine walls, while Tony paced mutely in front of the gates, unforthcoming.
Tony nodded slowly in agreement.  Folding was what it sounded like: if the Universe was a sheet of paper—and for most purposes, it was—folds brought two points, far apart on the arch, very close together in a linear direction.  And if Nibiru truly was in a pocket dimension—then it was no surprise that its cozy home in the center of the fold could go overlooked by starships zipping over the hill.
“You are mortal and feeble,” Thor said dismissively.  Then he captured Tony in a huge, backbreaking bear hug.  “I shall carry the torch of our adventures.”
The bear pondered closer.  Steve nudged Tony into the bush, one arm across his chest.  “Can I spray him now?” Tony whispered, clinging to Steve’s arm with one hand and pointing the bear spray at the bear with the other, looking far more gleeful than petrified.
He caught brief, haunting images of other dragons—dragons that looked up at him with those depthless black eyes, feral, uncommunicative, alert.  They might have thought he was a dragon, too, drifting in his armor high above them, except he never responded to their subvocal inquiries.
Loved them and loved them and loved them.  To the ends of the Earth, the edges of sanity, the limits of ambition.
Still wishing he had something to offer, given the shiver Tony was doing a not-so-great job at hiding, Steve sat down next to him, just as Clint harangued Thor, “I wanna be the larvae of Ymir’s flesh.”
“Strange.  I like being with me, too.”  Steve did not pinch his side, but he rolled his eyes before tugging Tony closer, turning onto his side to hug him.  “. . . Am I your teddy bear?”
To his surprise, Tony followed, only asking Steve if he had tried the Shoofly pie.  When Steve said that he could live without it, Tony insisted on securing a slice.
“I’m still here,” Tony observed, a rare moment of shared thought, one hand—never mind which hand, exactly—stroking down Rico’s back.  “I’m still here.”  He never looked at Steve, never twisted around to try to find him, exactly, because he knew Steve was present in the room, an echo in the house, somewhere, reverberating.
, a dated and forgettable starship who ended up in the history books because of one man’s extraordinary sacrifice.
“Last I checked, Thor was boozing with the locals downtown,” Clint said, his tone conversational, like none’a the nonsense had transpired at all.  He picked up the rod and cast out the line again, careful not to hook them.  “I didn’t figure I’d find you crazy kids anytime soon,” reel the line, spin the lure, “so, I took it upon myself to keep busy.  Any further questions, Your Honor?”
being afraid of anything, let alone a sweet old dog.  Tony tried clamping a hand over his mouth, but Steve just shucked him off his back—gently, he was not
Tony waved a hand dismissively in Steve’s direction, digging into his burger again.  “Give him the shovel talk again.”
“Just one of my many missed opportunities,” Tony said, unsuccessfully stifling a yawn.  “Remind me to have the film printed before you go.”
“Good dog,” Steve said, taking the shoe from Jeremiah’s mouth and holding it out to Tony, who had put ground between them.  “Aw, don’t be such a sourpuss,” Steve called after him, patting Jeremiah’s side and sitting up.  “C’mon, let’s go get the other one,” he instructed, gesturing with the shoe.  “Go get.”  Jeremiah loped off at a joyful jog.
.  All of it was making it hard for Tony to think.  “There’s not much more I can do for him.”  He had cleaned and bandaged the wound, cursing his lack of a dermal regenerator.  It had gotten lost sometime between the shore and the sprint for survival.  But: “He’s
.  He gave me his shot.  And do you know what I did with it?”  He spread his hands.  “Shut down a weapons’ factory and told Nick Fury to stop calling me.”
have a stick up their ass about the fluoride thing,” Tony mused, clicking through some of the heat from the first unintentional livestream.  “I should’ve told them the Kevin shot would cure the effects of fluoride poisoning.”
The days were long, communicating with Pepper and literal company, keeping abreast of his fellow Avengers, and working on technology that would someday save the world from itself.  In the middle of it all, he found room for Marker—as much room for Marker as he possibly could.
Clint held up a hand, pointer finger extended, and lifted his other palm above it, sliding his open palm along the length of his pointer finger before closing it around an invisible fly.  “
Bruce blinked once, nursing an entire tankard of ale.  Natasha said with familiar congeniality, “You look like you have a truly terrible idea, Stark.”

Champs, my jaw is locking up from pain, can somebody phone in a small miracle for me? This ol' bear needs a break.
Tony loved the brute—and all the hatchlings, honestly.  Even shy yellow Radon the Second, who hid under furniture, occasionally poking his nose out to sniff at Tony’s coffee.  He had absolutely no idea what category “R2D2” would fall into—tame or feral—but, at least for now, he had no trouble sharing space with him.
Still dressed in his Starfleet gold, Stovok looked down at him, literally and metaphorically.  Tony waved a hand dismissively.  “I’m on vacation.”
Piercingly loud at proximity, Snow clicked back.  Tony grimaced, but he had no choice but to hold his ground.
“Emergency,” Steve grunted.  He gave in, scratching his neck vigorously.  “Case you lose me again.”  He dropped his hand, daring Hill to deny him.  Natasha bumped her knee against his.  Steve got to his feet and paced to the farthest corner of the room, back to both of them.
“I should like to ring the Liberty Bell,” Thor announced, rubbing his hands together.  “Surely, it is time to announce to the people the good news of our triumph against the Chitauri.”
Clint, Thor, and Bruce huddled together in the backseat, working on the dinosaur puzzle.  It seemed pretty doomed to fail, as far as Steve was concerned—one pothole and the whole thing would fall apart—but they had a system, Thor’s steady hands holding the board and puzzle while Bruce and Clint shuffled through pieces.
.  You ever seen a guy in desperation throw another guy his own lifeline?  It happens.  But it’s rare.”
Strand him on an alien planet with no way home, he could at least blend with the natives.  Different kind of language, he mused, accepting another fruit and taking a bite.
Natasha flashed the card at Tony and Steve first.  Steve saw Tony pale a shade, then flush with outrage.
Tony, a mind reader, informed him, “Losing battle, champ.”  Then he patted Steve on the leg and shuffled out of the car.
, he thought, clicking his tongue a few times, idle, clumsy.  Dragonspeak could be beautiful, soulful like whale song.  He could not hope to imitate it, but every dragon-pair had a specific whistle that they used to communicate,
Steve hesitated a moment, but Mayor Cuff took one look at him and said seriously, “If I did not recognize that face,” and added, “It’s an honor to meet you, Captain.  I followed your story closely.  We all did.  Come,” he added to them all.  “Have a seat.”
“You ever had an Andorian beer?  I’ve heard it’s the only way to fully actualize one’s highest self.  Or maybe just get shitfaced without the hangover.”  He rubbed the side of his neck automatically, forgetting the spacesuit between his fingertips and his actual skin, where the hypo-spray had taken the edge off the Saurian brandy.  Modern miracles: all the carnal pleasures without the carnal aftermaths.
“They are highly intelligent,” Stovok said, his voice dead, utterly devoid of emotion.  “They will not wage open warfare on a greater force-in-numbers.  As I have communicated.  Repeatedly.  To Admiral Pierce.”  His voice shook with barely repressed emotion.
Stovok shook his head slowly.  “No.”  Folding his arms, he looked out over the desert-like homeworld of the Gorn and said, “It would only be a dream.  I should like to live a life.  Perhaps even one outside Starfleet.”  Then, with a hint of a real smile, he added, “I have seen my services may be of benefit to others, beyond mere diplomacy.”
“Two of my finest officers are missing in Klingon territory, and none of my remaining officers can tell me how it happened,” Captain Carter said, standing in the war room with Romanova, Barton, and Tony seated in a semi-circle before her.  “Is it reasonable to assume that they have been taken hostage?”
Tony Stark’s bedroom was a sacred space.  A space untouched by demons—carefully curated to keep the monsters out, to be a fortress against harm.
Steve refused to let his movements bely any shame as he moved away from the big teddy bear, insisting gruffly, “Where are they really?”
They waited a full three minutes for said-beautiful animal to return, then dared to reenter the trail.
“Stay,” Hulk grunted, which was so surprising Steve’s jaw dropped.  The laughter ceased abruptly from the peanut gallery.  Then Hulk smashed his fist on the ground again.  “Heeeeere.”
Tony flicked off the PADD.  Even with the projection gone, the room was not dark; the open window allowed the almost ethereal moonlight from the planet’s veil to seep in, almost like a nightlight.
would never be able to walk the brownstone streets the same way Stevie Rogers had.  He would always dream of Brooklyn, exactly as it had been, the day before he had left.  “No,” he said out loud, because Tony was still listening, waiting for his answer.
Tony whistled once, telling himself that dragon hearing was only so acute, that Marker had been alone for almost a century and was now surrounded by dragons, that he knew Marker and Marker knew him, and Gravemarker would never leave him.
“Godspeed, space man,” Tony bid him, dancing back a few steps for good measure as Dr. Banner disappeared through the same hole in the ground.
Then trust me for one chapter as we establish some critical world-building, so that we might embark on even more adventures soon!
“I’m older than sliced bread,” Steve replied.  At Tony’s flat look, he added sincerely, “I remember it.  It was the last summer before the Depression.  They called it
Trapped but not down, not at all bested, Iron Man seethed wordlessly, twisting in Steve’s hold in a last-ditch-effort to cut loose.  Steve held on, and when Iron Man tripped, Steve went down with him, helped cushion the fall.
Blinking, Steve sat up on his long chair, taking in the sights of the city, surprised to find the light had shifted—softer, less bright, but still early evening, well before sunset.  While the sunglasses were the same, Steve noticed Tony had exchanged his cardigan and blue jeans for a more presentable
He heard more excited whooping in the distance and squeezed his eyes shut.  Probably just murderers.
left unsaid.  “My armor protects me from all danger,” he added, which was . . . not untrue.  In his navy-blue, scaly suit, only his eyes were exposed.  Tony was not sure if the Hirogen species’ claim of immortality was bravado or factual, but he doubted Thor would appreciate him pointing out the potential weakness.
To their credit, the hotel clerks did not even bat an eyelash as Steve walked past them, carrying Clint over his shoulders, one hand upheld in a brief,
he asked her.  It seemed stupid and important—that, after everything, there was something more than vague tolerance between them all.
“I’m on vacation,” Natasha reminded sweetly.  She offered him the glass.  Steve sniffed it automatically, then took a small gulp.  Mmm.
, and ducked below the surface, using river dynamics to his advantage.  Water moved faster below the surface.  He jetted downstream towards the maelstrom ahead, miscalculating how much harder it would be to resurface in the turbulent discharge.
The others rose and placed their hands on one another’s shoulders, on Stovok, and Tony, and Bruce, who was red as a tomato.
“‘Time is diminishing,’” Tony repeated, shaking his head to himself.  Time had already run out, at least for the crew of the
Tony did.  He could see a thick fog, fanning out over the water.  “Yeup,” he said grimly.  “That looks cold.”
“Anthony Stark.”  Mayor Cuff had a voice fit for radio, and a smile that could win an election in a landslide.  “I was beginning to think you would not show.”
.”  Shaking his head, Tony said, “I didn’t have my suit today, and if push came to shove—there’s nothing I could’ve done to stop it.”
Even Marker, who had been warbling in amusement, abruptly ceased, standing up and making himself scarcer in the lab, retreating to the far corner.  Nobody, not even a powerful male dragon like Marker, wanted to mess with an angry mother.  Snow’s clicks decreased in pitch but increased in volume.
“Of course you would.”  Shaking his head, Tony said, “C’mon, big fella, we got a starship to talk to.”
“I mean, this isn’t something we learned in basic,” Steve said, still trying, almost instinctively, to follow the movements, his enhanced reflexes itching with the need to pin down every movement.  “So, why did you learn it in—training?”
Thor laughed, breaking the tension.  He hopped down from his perch—Steve sighed with relief—and began mingling with the crowd, shaking hands, taking pictures.
, he told it, closing the door to further suggestions and the pile of berries placed within arm’s reach.  “See, if I said
After completing one ponderous but inexorable lap around the kitchen, ignoring the poltergeist trailing after him, Steve located the source of his woes.  “No,
“He’s right,” Tony chimed in immediately, sauntering around, turning over pebbles idly with his foot.  “I
“I could make a suit like this,” Tony said suddenly, coming to a halt beside Steve, who had been lingering in a strategic shadow, outside the spotlight.
.  He stared at his own hands, gripping the bike and the jacket haphazardly.  She lingered, her hand encircling his wrist, then spiriting away the keys from his palm.
Tony locked all the doors and crept under the covers, uncaring that it was some ungodly hour in the evening and he was still too wired to rest.  Too uptight to possibly enjoy a good night’s sleep.  He was cold and shifty, unbalanced.  He only settled a little when Steve settled beside him, big, warm, unbreakable.
“I don’t have any.”  Then, catching up to the response: “Who told you I get motion sick?  Was it Nick?  It was definitely Nick.
, the little white card said—and smiled to himself at the unexpected aroma, an almost strawberry scent filling his nostrils.  His sense of smell was listed as his “least superior” enhancement on every scorecard—he was no bloodhound—but he luxuriated in his refined human endowments, regardless.
and wonder how it came to this?” Tony mused.  “An id-based rage monster, a Norse god who literally doesn’t know any better, and a former clown with a killer streak?”
Disturbed, Tony looked at Thallium, who licked her chops and looked at him hopefully.  He told her seriously, “I will protect you with my life.”
,” Steve rebuked, picking him up under the arms and setting him on the opposing counter.  “I said don’t
“Now, hold on, son,” Admiral Pierce said.  Stovok stood stiffly, and Tony could hear his heartbeat, thump, thump, thump, thump.  He was agitated, deeply so.  More so at Pierce’s drawling, almost insolent remark: “You would have us risk our own to put a few Rommies back in their place?”
He took a chance, rolling into the cover of a densely packed thicket and squeezing his eyes shut automatically as the hoard thundered by.  They whooped, they shouted, they flung spears, but they did not once stop to acknowledge him.
It was an awesome way to learn.  Books were magic—capturing stories told by the dead, that otherwise would never be recounted—but watching an artist make, with such verve and skill, made him want to know Tony’s mind, like the architecture of a grand museum that had never once been seen.  Steve found himself mentally drawing the towering pillars, the arches so tall they disappeared into darkness again, the vast, narrow spaces, endless catacombs.  It seemed a frightening place, from whence the brilliance came.
Dr. Banner moaned, “There is no Plan B.”  He collapsed onto his side, in grief or frustration, Tony did not know.  What he
“That’s great, buddy,” Tony wheezed, patting the Hirogen on the shoulder.  “Just give me a ring, anytime you wanna kick some lizard butt.”
“Tony?” he called.  Tony snored again.  Steve huffed.  The great Tony Stark—sleeping in a bathtub.  There was something wholesome about it, like—Steve shook his head at himself.  He knocked firmly on the wall.  Tony jerked, startling awake.  Just that easy, Steve thought, without a trace of guilt.  He remembered the joys of basic.  “Morning,” Steve greeted neutrally.  Tony gripped his shirt over his arc reactor, then looked at Steve, his expression morphing into a scowl.  “We’re leaving in half an hour.”
Standing on numb legs, Tony looked around the teleportation pad, realized he was alone, and turned back to the beaming engineer.  “Where am I?”
Steve lingered briefly on the Dodo, imagining Thor attempting to rotisserize it, before shaking his head in mute wonder and following Tony and Bruce down the hall.
“Eight of my darling nieces are Girl Scouts,” Clint said between snickers.  “You come for them, I will skin you.”  Then he doubled over and laughed so hard Steve was impressed he did not simply keel over.
With an annoyed sigh, Steve turned to face him.  Tony forced himself to his knees.  “I know it’s my fault,” he repeated, almost foaming with the force of it, “I
“I’ve always wanted to glow in the dark,” Barton said, swiveling in the Captain’s chair and looking back at his passengers thoughtfully.  “I’ll still glow in the dark with the suit on, right?”
“You know what it’s like,” Tony murmured into the darkness of the night, where other listeners could not listen, the warm safe cavity made between them.  “To be spoken over.”
Howard.  He missed having somebody around who could be a scoundrel with him, not merely an on-the-books partner but somebody who could fly into enemy territory when the time came.  It was hard to reconcile the man he knew with the man Tony would not even speak of.
When the Vulcan reached the scouting party, he greeted them with his usual impenetrable composure, nodding at Dr. Banner and then gesturing at himself with a single hand.  After an inaudible confrontation, two of the Nibirans abruptly shoved Dr. Banner towards Stovok—Tony yelped in alarm, but Stovok caught and stabilized him.  Then he gave Dr. Banner a nudge in the right direction, stepping around him carefully, and received the scouting party with a welcoming nod.  The Nibirans turned back towards the path.  Stovok followed them.
Mollified, Happy nodded.  Then he directed at Tony, who was still looking at the lake, “Do all your friends pack a punch?”
Uncrimping his fingers, he hesitated to remove his grip from around Steve’s neck.  To his surprise, Steve waited for him, instead of taking the opportunity to make a quicker escape.  Relieved that Steve would not abandon him, he forced himself to slip his arms over his head, shuddering as he skimmed his fingers against the cave walls.  He scrambled for a moment in animal desperation upward, but Steve caught him by the hips, holding him steady, insisting, “Hey.  Look at me.”
The noise immediately quieted.  The hand curled around his squeezed.  Tony swallowed down sudden emotion.  Steve was here.  Steve was here.
Steve grinned.  “Wouldn’t miss it for the world,” he promised.  He slid out of the booth and started to thumb twenties out of his wallet.  Sam shook his head, starting to argue, but Steve demurred, “No, I can’t take any more affairs with my teammates.”  Sam laughed.  Steve set down a pile of twenties and instructed, “Tell them to keep the change.”
He was halfway to dozing when Steve said, “Aw, gee,” under his breath.  Tony opened an eye to see him inspecting the door, then looking at Marker, the demon puppy responsible.  “Well.  It is Christmas,” he said enigmatically, and brought the mugs over to the bed.  “Need a lift?” he asked Tony.
“Hah-hah-hah, keep biting the hand, see how much it feeds y—” Tony began, yelping when Clint grabbed him from behind with both hands.  He spun and swatted Clint in the side, hard.  “You
His lousy human ears could not make out a response over the sound of Clint and Natasha scuffling and Bruce rhapsodizing about his teammates.
Tony shook his head, passing him the box back.  “I don’t want these, I want the real salt of the Earth
“It is like this,” Tony said suddenly.  “Blue skies, white clouds, green grass.  Earth looks just like this.”
“Starfleet Command will be very pleased with your work.  We had hardly expected to find intelligent lifeforms within the Briar Patch,” Captain Carter went on.  “If we had, we would have sent a larger expeditionary force,” she added to Commander Stovok, who inclined his head in acknowledgement.
“Don’t be a baby,” Dr. Banner grumbled, arms folded and looking very disheveled.  “It’s just a hell hole, you love those.”
“Great,” Tony said, watching Thor finishing strapping down Smokey and clamber into the car, greeting joyously:
He tossed it over the cat and tucked the furry burrito back into the fold of an arm.  “About the cat litter,” Steve reminded, in a vague hurry.  He hated leaving Tony alone, no matter how much Tony hated being hovered over.  Tony would have divorced him, already, in writing and everything, had Tony not immediately changed his mind after Steve had volunteered to spend the night at Sam’s, as a sort of compromise.
Ignoring the suggestion, Steve inhaled, pulled the shirt over his head, and exhaled carefully.  The seams held.  Barely.  “It’s okay,” he announced grimly.
“I hate you,” Tony snipped.  Then, when Steve shifted, no doubt to try and free himself, Tony backpedaled, “I take it back.  I take it back.  Please don’t leave.”
“Guy’s got such an ego,” Tony sighed, as the Gorn righted itself and went stomping back towards the melee.  Tony dared to open the doors and saw nearly thirty Gorn all attempting to pummel Thor with closed fists, hissing softly and waving their claws in what appeared to be a very threatening display.  Thor roared back at them, lightly scratched up but completely undaunted.
Steve thought about it.  Bucky, in Hydra red—and shook his head.  “He’d never turn,” he muttered, which made Tony raise both eyebrows.  “We here to see some flowers or not?” Steve demanded, heart beating too fast.
Steve huffed—in derision, in disbelief, “you call it tomato, I call it tomato”—then looked down as Natasha held out the shield to him.  When he reached for it, his fingers trembled.  He hesitated, then committed to the task, closing the distance, bringing the old girl closer.  The shield was light and warm, more like a blanket than a gun.
A blonde-haired woman stepped out.  “Hello, boys,” Natasha Romanoff greeted.  “Been a long day, trying to find you.”
Shaking his head slowly, Steve looked around the Stone Age sterile room and said, “Progress, huh?  No flying cars.  No lunar bases.”
Then he heard footsteps approaching him.  He turned his head, saw the guiding light hovering over the head of the cloaked underling.  Only the King had a face; the rest were nameless, nobody.  “Why does Hell have a King, anyway?” Tony asked the underling philosophically, wondering if it was possible to make friends.
The choice was easy.  What was unexpected was Steve sitting up, wrapping his good arm around Tony, and pulling him into a firm, protective embrace.
“You pass the dove along,” Thor explained patiently, like Tony was particularly slow on the uptake, which was funny enough Steve had to fight a smile as Tony frowned at Thor.  Thor paused his eating long enough to cup his hands around an invisible bird and mimed passing it along.  “It is very easy, even you should be able to do it.”
Sighing, Tony reached for the air cannister.  He nearly jumped out of his skin when a second, red-tinted troublemaker intercepted him, tiny teeth locked around his welding glove.  “
“The Romulans seek war.  War, they have.  Why should we intrude upon it?” interjected the first Councilman.
A game of chicken, it was.  “Can’t make cookies without eggs,” Tony said, nudging the eggs closer still, inviting,
Shaking his head in mute awe, Steve trudged along the dark, barely-lit path, ignoring the Stark-shaped koala on his back, telling himself it was just cargo, and maybe he would carry Clint next, just to make a point—he did not play favorites, he carry any of his teammates if the need arose.  That the need was scarcely likely to arise for Natasha, who could look after herself, or Thor, who might very well
“I got impatient,” Tony muttered against his shoulder, keeping the cane under hand for support.  “It’s snowing on the East Coast, you know.”
Like all her siblings, she was mostly white-gray, but she had a tinted undercoat that hinted at her adult colors.  Thallium was one of three green-tinted dragons, but unlike her more feral brothers, Praseodymium and Neodymium, she seemed people-curious, like Tin-Tin and Curie.
To his surprise, Tony followed.  “Give a guy a break,” he huffed, but Steve maintained his strive, moving towards a cornfield.
A curling chalk dragon reposed on the stone walkway, colored every configuration of the rainbow by a half dozen attentive artists.  Stovok had either not noticed him—which was more probable than it seemed, given his ability to meditate in the middle of firefights and deep storms—or had elected to ignore him, carefully tracing out another black-scaled friend for the children to color.  The boy who had summoned him stayed very close, leaning on the Vulcan’s shoulder and adding splashes of cornflower blue to the creature emerging with every careful brush stroke.
mind?” Steve echoed warily, wondering, somehow, if Tony had read it, if Tony had seen the vast arctic space that had overtaken the landscape of Steve’s world, freezing everything in place.  It was all still there.
Cursing the imminent reality of making the national news, Steve grabbed the nearest railing and leaped over it.
Tony dared to look, placing a hand on Stovok’s shoulder to keep himself from falling into the abyss.
Shifting his weight, leaning into Steve’s physicality to bring himself away, away from the darkness and into the light, Tony searched fruitlessly for scars, signs of the war Steve had endured.  It amazed him that Steve had emerged unscathed from the ice, that seventy years had left no marks.  His fingertips almost could not accept the lack of imperfections, tenacious in their search, sweeping over every millimeter of exposed skin.
Steve chose to tune out from the story of creation—no doubt Thor would repeat it, should he ask—and check in with Tony, who looked a bit cold and small, off on his own.  “Y’okay, pal?” he asked, careful to keep his voice low.
As the credits rolled, Clint started clapping.  Thor joined in.  Bruce, who had been dozing against a pole, jerked upright, then started clapping with them, looking around unsurely; he flinched when Clint whistled loudly.  “All right,” Steve quelled.  Clint ignored him.
He looked back out the window.  Oh, he was all right.  Already, the ache in his shoulder was gone, good-as-new.  With a full belly, he could hardly complain about the turn of events.
And Steve . . . Steve did the right thing.  He fished out his very own room key, held it in the air, and whistled once in invitation.
“It is never hopeless, Doctor,” Stovok said, looking between the two of them, covered in mud and still unflinchingly golden.  “It is merely difficult.”
He hadn’t had any trouble with the underlings since he had kicked Kevin out of power—Kevin is Dead; Long Live Kevin—and aside from the whole eternal darkness and periodic earthquakes, Hell wasn’t
you,” Steve placated him, which only made Bruce duck behind Tony.  Sighing, Steve told Linda, “We’ll take them.”
He helped Steve find a clean cloth, letting Steve apply pressure to the severed artery, head pounding in panic.  He pressed the panic button his wristlet, hoping to God Happy was awake, before telling J.A.R.V.I.S. to call an ambulance.
Reflexively, Tony kicked him in the face.  “I’m sorry,” he immediately blurted out.  “I’m sorry, I thought you were—”
Maybe he was.  But at least he wasn’t afraid.  There was no place, in his world or the futurians’, where he would not go.
Reeling, Tony pressed a hand to his head, aching with leftover emotions—fury, and despair, and untidy fear, and so many other things Vulcans were not easy to admit.
Dawn had not even broken when the white streak appeared in the sky, drifting low and finally landing.  Tony watched as Steve almost fell off her back, gripping his neck in one hand and a squirming white object in the other.
,” he said, a little too slowly.  “It’s prune juice.”  He slid the drink in front of Steve again.  “Drink it.”
“This is Cinnamon,” Linda went on, indicating the tan-colored alpaca beside her.  Tony had both arms wrapped around Cinnamon, hugging its neck.  “She’s five years old.  And a sweetie.”
The feeling of being alone did not last long: he had hardly sat up, stretched out some of the creak in his bones, before Steve padded over, holding a cup of coffee in one hand.  “Consider it a thank-you,” he explained, offering it.
For a long, eerily quiet moment, Steve stared at the broom blocking his path.  Then he stepped on the head and snapped its neck with a truly awful
Natasha inclined her head.  Hill said, “That goes doubly for you, Cap.”  She held up a card; he reluctantly lowered his shield and took it.  “Not everything has to go to Fury.”  She smiled a little, then added, “I’d join you for breakfast, but I’m pretty sure the others want to see me even less than you do.”
“Tony, no,” Steve rebuked, wrapping an arm around his waist as Tony clambered up onto the counter to make good on his mental threat, parking him back on the floor.  “If you want cookies—”
That was what made Chicago beautiful: he did not know every street corner like the back of his hand, nor did he hear familiar voices in familiar landmarks or look for worn footpaths in fresh blocks of cement.
“Wrigley Field,” Clint agreed with a nod, turning around and marching off to find the rest of his clothes, hopefully.
“Nope,” he decided, desperately latching onto Steve again, hiding his face in his shoulder, but even his proximity was not enough to stop his panicked shaking.  “Nope, nope, I’m just gonna—”
Were these the distant relatives of an outpost colony, forsaken wanderers who learned to grow and thrive on a transparently young world?  Or were they the young inhabitants of a world that had been spinning as long as Earth, only just now emerging into their own?
Tony’s shout came without air.  The Nibirans reacted belatedly but with more enthusiasm; hooting and yelling, things that might have been,
Steve put a quelling hand on his shoulder.  “I’m not explaining to Nick Fury how you died on our trip to Niagara Falls.”
, but not an unadaptable, immutable layer, not a deep internal part of who he was, like Brooklyn.  Brooklyn was stitched into his very heart.  Cut Brooklyn out, he would bleed dry.  Remove his foggy memory of yesteryear Chicago and replace it with the more vibrant city of tomorrow and it was still Chicago but—Chicago, seventy years, in the future.
.  Soon, half the diners had gathered around their table, most standing, a few slotting onto the limited spaces left on the benches.  Tony started to slip away, sensing he could be more useful sticking his nose other places, when Thor suddenly slammed a fist onto the table and stood up, empty plate in hand.  To Tony’s horror, Thor then smashed the plate on the ground, roared, “
,” Clint declared, holding up a giant woven basket that had to have three hundred strawberries crammed into it, face already flushed with a sunburn.  “I’m going to get an award,” he decreed.
Tony toyed with the conversational lure: “You broke your arm and it healed in three days.  I bet you could get mauled and shake it off.  Nothin’ in these woods scarier than you, right?  Must be nice.”
According to Google, Brighton in the United Kingdom is the most "hipster" city in the world. Portland is number two.
He was also sure it had been a child, and that altered the flavor of the hunt.  Maybe they were a tribe of murderous aliens, hellbent on ridding their world of perceived threats—plenty of those in and outside the Federation, after all—but maybe they weren’t.
“Thank you, prey,” Thor said, taking a seat across from Stovok and Tony, nodding once in acknowledgment.  “Your armor is feeble.”
“Oh, uh—hi,” Bruce greeted.  “Hi.  I like birds,” he explained, then winced, like he had already said too much.  “I mean, they’re very—scientifically, I mean—”
gesture.  Steve stepped reluctantly into frame.  “This is Steve.  You might know Steve.”  Without warning, he took a swing at Steve with the two-by-four.  Steve reflexively caught the board.  In one hand.
He glanced down at red Curium, sleeping on his boots, the dragon who could not be half the dragon Marker was.
He didn’t mention the vast starship fields or the cities without a spot of green in sight, a world that was at odds with its desires, to run away and return home.  Earth was still good.  Earth was still
“Kind of begging the universe to let a hog tip you,” Tony said, sitting on the sidelines, Bruce at his side.
Steve sighed, but he was in the back of a bulletproof limo by 1338, and, miraculously, on a private plane by 1400 hours.  They jetted down the coastline, touching down near Arlington, Virginia just before 1500 hours.  His handlers seemed very happy to hoist him upon a group of fresh faces at the National Cemetery.
“’A national treasure,’” Bruce parroted quietly, sitting at a rounded table with his back to the stunning city panorama.  In front of him, a small noisy coffee machine hissed loudly.  Bruce seemed oblivious to the noise, head in both hands, looking like he would rather turn in early for the night than attend any kind of festivities.  Tony, who had his second wind, did not appear to be offering any
It was practically scripted, it was so familiar.  Tony removed his hand from his knee, begrudgingly removed his hand from his shirt, and yanked the chair so it was facing the wall, back entirely to the monster.
shaped to look like a pile of skulls.  Simple necessity: human bone could never hold up to centuries of damnation.
It was the middle of the day, but Tony occupied none of his usual haunts.  The study was empty; the kitchen, eerily quiet.  Even the living room was cold and dark.  Ignoring a bolt of trepidation, Steve trekked upstairs, cat in hand, bad knee be damned.  Steve did not mind the extra walk, not when he had a mission to uphold: find Tony and present Rico.
Five sets of eyes flicked to the navigational device glowing in the center of the car, informing them that they had not, in fact, passed their destination.
“And if I had my suit, I could unstitch you,” Tony replied, tapping at his telephone again.  “Not saw in half.
A rueful smirk crossed Steve’s face.  “Myself.”  When Tony’s expression smoothed back into shuttered indifference, he added, “He won’t—he won’t understand, Tony.”
Tony yawned and made a show of stretching his arms.  “Well,” he said, with affected buoyancy, “time to hit the hay.”  Then he crossed his arms over his own chest and shut his eyes.
Nothin’ like being stranded in the middle of the celestial ocean, Tony thought.  It was nighttime again—the night cycle on the planet seemed notably brief, maybe half an Earth day, which meant the planet’s rotational speed was twice as fast as Earth’s.
to live in an iron lung, even though Tony Stark had apparently been doing it for almost four years, now.  Steve skirted a red-gloved hand over Iron Man’s chest, still trying to find a nonexistent pulse.  “I’ll live,” Iron Man impressed.  “You can . . . let me up, now, Cap.”
Tony noticed how strangely Stovok held his chalk only after he began tracing a long arched back for a second dragon, interwoven with the first.  Vulcan fingertips were incredibly sensitive, like the surface of the eye.  Rather than gripping the chalk between two fingertips, he held the chalk effortlessly between his middle and ring finger, pinned below the second knuckle, snug against the palm.  Even more than the pointed ears and green blood, it reminded Tony that Stovok was truly Vulcan; it echoed the very salute that they used to greet one another, to meld minds, to express so much emotion in so little.
“Just one?” Clint chimed in.  “Good thing I brought this.”  He held up an empty water bottle.  “Pee bottle,” he explained.
But his science brain could wrap itself around logistics all the livelong day and still not conquer the animal terror of suffocating in a pitch-black, muddy
“. . . Right.”  Looking around, Tony pointed in a cardinal direction and stated, “Those mountains.  Not gonna climb themselves.”
To Steve’s surprise, Mayor Cuff fished in a pocket and produced a white card.  “What the hell.  Give your driver a call and take a spin around town.  Happy trails, Mr. Stark.”  Then Mayor Cuff climbed back into his car, offered a light wave, and peeled off.
It was surprisingly sweet, like a Terran coconut, with an edge of something creamy that only enriched the overall taste.  He decided,
Steve checked the laundry room automatically, even though Tony had not spent significant time there in over a decade, old bones catching up to his younger idiosyncrasies.
Tony groaned and leaned back in his seat with a harrumph.  “This is the musical equivalent of swatting a fly,” he grumbled.  “No—this is the musical equivalent of
The only way to survive it was to bury it, bury the pain as deeply under as it would go, under a layer of insulating cartilage, tissue, fiber, mettle, grit, and
Tony groaned.  “Yeah,” he said.  At least the heat and painkillers took the edge off.  Steve slid a hand around his back, gently helping him sit upright, piling pillows behind him.  “Mm.  You’re my Christmas gift,” he said, accepting the mug of coffee, tolerating the heating pad closer to his lower back.  “Gift that keeps on giving.”
of the past and a prediction of what music might be like in the future! It's nonscientific, but it sure is fun! (The future predictions begin at
Tony wondered, pacing the grounds, half-expecting to find their torn-up carcasses.  But that was a fantasy—at their size, there would simply be nothing left.
“What, are you in trouble?  What’s wrong with you?  Where are you?” Tony demanded, more freaked out by the static than the incomprehensible jabber that could have been either
Hill’s look flattened briefly, almost exasperated, but she nodded on her other side.  “My bag,” she said.
, Tony promised, unexpectedly melancholy.  He had faith in Neodymium and Praseodymium, Ferrum and Barium, but little yellow Radon worried him.  Cadmium, too.
Rumors abounded that dragon scales were, in their late stages, made of actual gold.  Tony doubted it—dragon hides were far tougher than soft, malleable gold—but looking at his big beautiful nightmare, sprawled elegantly in the grass, he could not help but think that maybe he was spun of gold, after all.  Slowly growing into it.
“The universe is dangerous,” Sojef went on, but his calm tone was at odds with his message.  “It is a rather horrible place.”
Tony blinked at him, looking genuinely surprised, then scrubbed a hand over his face and said, “That.  That.  I don’t—it’s not a pickup line.  But it counts.”
“Go sit,” Clint ordered, pointing his spatula at the beaten-up picnic table near Bruce.  Steve grumbled but obligingly retreated to the table.  “Wait a second, I thought you—” he then pointed the spatula at Bruce, who shrank, “were on cake watch, who’s on cake watch?”
“He respects my results,” Tony corrected, kicking off his shoes and tugging off his socks so he could rest his feet in the grass.  Real grass.  He missed Terra, suddenly and powerfully.  Space was cool—literally.  Cold, detached, often separated by a very necessary layer of life-saving reality.  While Class M planets were not rare, they were outnumbered by incompatible worlds, and most Starfleet business was conducted on their ships to avoid the middleman of on-world operations.  The texture of real grass comforted something primal in Tony, a desire for the homeworld that burned inside even the most space-faring race.
Tony snorted a genuine laugh.  “Gives a whole new meaning to Bible-thumper, doesn’t it?”  Tony looked around for something else to throw, only making a soft noise of complaint when Steve grabbed him and pulled him into a full body embrace.  “What’cha doin’?”
“I know I haven’t . . . I’m not always . . . I don’t . . . ”  It was like trying to hold the tide in his palms.  It just kept slipping away.  “I’d miss you, buddy.  You’re my . . .”  He held out a hand.  After a prolonged hesitation that felt almost like rejection, like
“It’s gotta be a distant relative,” Tony insisted, startling when the Nibirans began hooting in interest.  He looked forward automatically, heard echoing hoots far below, and saw the descent team, about halfway up the volcano.  Stovok was among them.  Tony bolted upright, nearly plunged forward until Bruce grabbed him by the back of the shirt.  “Thanks.”
Thor beamed, stepping forward and clasping Steve on the shoulder with one hand.  “You seemed . . . stiff,” Thor elaborated, waving a huge hand.  Thor was a big guy—never more obvious than pinioned against him.
“The Academy does not require a physical presence,” Stovok went on.  “Although many prefer it.  For the . . . personal connection.  To one’s future allies and crew.”
The scene shifted: they were sitting on a ship, now, side-by-side, strapped in, ready to warp.  “Are you afraid?” Barnes asked.
“Yeah.  This’ll be easy.  See if I can’t catch Pierce on my way out.”  He smiled.  It was a smile you could fall in love with, Steve knew—and, he knew, smiling back, just a little, unable to help himself, he already
Thor said around a crunchy piece of bacon, “Your courtship requires more bread.  Perhaps a dove, if you are serious.”
Then he felt a warm shoulder crash into his own, a black-clad agent landing next to him.  Steve jolted, nearly scrambled out of the way, nearly
Pierce's mouth twisted as Cap took the briefcase from Tony Stark’s hands.  Tony surprised himself by letting Cap do so without a fight.
Compile these facts together—humans did not survive long with mortal wounds, yet humans inflicted the mortal wounds upon each other, in fits of human emotion, human
Getting up, ginger with the ache in his muscles, the bone-deep suffering pushed to the periphery, Tony managed, “Good.  Then follow me.”
Steve liked polar bears.  He had never had a favorite animal—he liked all animals, equally, except mules; mules kicked, and kicked squarely below the belt, as Steve discovered once, and once was enough—but there was something swell about polar bears.  Maybe it was the influence of all those Arctic explorers he had grown up reading about, as a boy: ill-fated Shackleton, northbound Peary, and larger-than-life Amundsen, swathed in his rich Arctic furs.
On principle, Tony turned him down.  Steve, damn him, gave him one anyway, a little cup at the sink.  And Tony drank it.
“Oh, come on,” Tony wheedled, in the almost petulant tone that Steve was beginning to associate with a man used to winning people over, “we’re driving through the night, what’s the rush?”
Tony frowned, pacing the bridge.  “Nibiru is thousands of light years away.  Hundreds of thousands, if I remember correctly.  And I do.  Surely, it wasn’t the first choice.”
Bruce nodded, barely awake, shuffling up.  Tony sighed audibly, but he did not bite off either of their heads when Bruce grabbed it.  Bruce found a fucking closet, grabbed three.  “Oh, bless you,” Steve told him sincerely, thinking of his Ma, and people who were actually meant to be healers.
The other door to the van creaked open.  Bruce, who had been hiding behind it, asked meekly, “That was binding?”
Steve whirled to face him.  Looking sulky and unapproachable with bent head and muted clothing, Tony Stark leaned against a post and addressed him from below a broad-brimmed hat.  A lit cigarette hung from one hand, but it seemed distracted, a way of keeping other people away.
“Good,” Steve said.  “We’re moving out in half an hour.”  Bruce blinked a third time, surprised.  Steve made a gentle shooing motion.  Bruce scurried back into the room.
He was a dragon without wings, who yearned to be beyond the clouds, above the worldly.  The worldly was precious, but up top, he felt timeless.  Outside it all.
“Got an answer for everything, don’t you, Stark?” Steve said, turning to face him, cold with anger.  “Got something in that big brain of yours that’ll just fix everybody up right?”
Or maybe Nibiru was the same age as Earth but far more distant from its star, which could explain the ambient frigidity.  The white and red vegetation were both in spectrums designed to absorb more light and heat, and the population’s proximity to a volcano further indicated a heat-seeking lifestyle.  If that were the case, even with moons, it would take longer to slow down the rotational speed, yet give the appearance of a much younger planet.
.  It was painstaking work.  Despite his initial optimism, he gave up on himself at times, drinking himself into a stupor to forget the miserable state of affairs.
, his inner logician argued, as he sat in the dirt like an abandoned four-year-old in front of the hell hole.
Tony had banished the others except for Bruce, who was curled up on a cot, exhausted.  Steve envied him.  “You should get some rest,” he told Tony idly, his own voice scratchy with would-be sleep.  “It’s late.”
as a sommelier,” Tony said calmly, not a trace of Howard Stark in his voice.  And just like that, Steve
Tony inhaled deeply, covered his eyes with a hand, and muttered, “You’re actually giving Captain America the shovel talk.”
Steve scowled at him, but before he could formulate a proper counterargument, a dog approached at speed.  “Lucky,
that everyone would forget about him amid the fanfare and jubilee.  It was a victory he no longer wanted; he wanted to go home so badly it hurt, like a broken tooth.  He would gladly take up a pair of pliers and fix the problem on his own, were-it-only-so-simple.
Natasha never took her eyes off Iron Man.  Steve was grateful; had she turned away, he worried Tony Stark would be
Bruce just shook them out, got them situated over Tony—even one over his metal legs, which seemed peculiar, although who was Steve to judge the metal man his indulgences?—before staggering wordlessly back to his cot, flopping over, and snoring within eight seconds.
Tony pivoted to see a yellow head sniffing at Rhodes’ pant leg from under the couch.  “R2D2,” Tony said.
Instead, he reached for Steve’s hand again, but Steve tired of the game, gripping the edge of the tub hard enough that Tony gave up on having it for his own.  How utterly unlike him, Steve thought, and sighed.
“I would,” Dr. Banner said begrudgingly, then held out a hypospray like a Taser.  “Now, scram, before I use this.”
He could not see Steve’s face, but he could make out the exasperation in his tone as he replied, “Get down from there.  Come with me.”
But Tony sighed.  “Guess there’s still work to be done,” Steve acknowledged, trying not to sound as rained-on as he felt.  He shook his head.  “Polio.”  He dug into his pocket, pulled out his journal, and flipped through it, uncaring that Tony could see it.  He nearly tore a page, then freed the pencil and wrote POLIO in all capitals.  For good measure, he crossed it out—a paranoid part of him worried he would wake up in a hundred years and find out some well-meaning person had resurrected it based on Captain America’s unintended endorsement.
.”  Steve broke his hold, frustrated beyond reckoning, and Tony let him.  Tony watched him tear the straps, not getting them loose—foresight was building in complexity, and complexity slowed Steve down—but getting them half-loose.  His hand shook.
Sighing, Steve tucked an arm around him, pulling him closer.  Tony grumbled but went with the movement, which told Steve exactly how desperately he wanted it.  Tony, vulnerable, tended to shut down even harder, running off to be alone.  That he would reveal his hand
Confident that he could beat the runner, Steve loped easily towards first base, and he rolled easily into a fence as Thor crashed into him.
“Think it’s how some people get by,” Steve mused.  “You know.  When the heartbreak hits.  Easier to think it’s not personal because it never was.”
Even in his bulky tactical gear, Tony was surprisingly soft against his chest, real and reassuringly alive.  “Steve,” Tony said, and his throat clicked audibly as he swallowed.  “We’re a long, long way from home.”
To his surprise, Marker lunged halfway out of the water, his head butting Tony’s chest hard enough to send him backwards, landing flat on his ass.
Within this bastard complex of grit, resolve, bone, and flesh, there resided a metallic organism whose sole purpose was to keep the primary organism alive.  It even had a heartbeat of its own, a lifeforce one could measure in megawatt hours.  (Tick, tock, ran the atomic clock—if human ears were fine enough, they could hear it
For one naïve impulsive hopeful devastating moment, Steve waited for Tony to just . . . snap his fingers and put the world together.
“I feel you have forgotten that they are already dissidents,” intruded another elder.  “Hopeless detractors.  They disowned themselves.  This is not our concern.  It is between the Terrans and the Romulans.”
Steve let go of his quarry.  Clint jumped to his feet, swiped the ball from Bruce, jogged back towards home plate, not even winded.  “He’s the Blue Heeler of the spy world,” Tony informed him, sauntering over to the pow-wow.  “Pretty sure Fury hired him because he couldn’t pen him up.  Let’s mix it up.”  He then pointed meaningfully at first base, and Bruce scuttled off.  When Steve took a step towards third, Tony planted a hand on his chest to halt him, then pointed to the outfield.  “Get me the ball,” he said.
