As he stood in the endless abyss, he hoped (not for the first time) that everything would be right again someday; that he would return to that embrace he so desperately longed for. For now, all he could do was fight.
The hunters moved further down the cave, each with a knife and a flashlight in hand. They scanned across the cave walls, looking for any sign of life, or maybe another tunnel they could follow. Their map could only take them so far, from here on, they had to rely on instincts alone.
Sam and Jack didn’t move, so he tried again. “GET OUT” he howled, his voice breaking into a sob. The hunter and nephilim flinched, but granted Dean’s wish. They slowly padded out of the bunker’s kitchen, grief evident on their features.
His peace didn’t last too long. One second he was reminiscing of humble beginnings, and the next he was staring straight into the eyes of the entity itself. He had made it to the surface, the air that surrounded him now felt strange, like he was surrounded by wind that had a mind of its own. It blew around him and through him, as if he was not there at all. But Cas knew he was, the entity looked too pissed for this to be another illusion.
Castiel tilted his head in confusion and opened his mouth to speak before Balthazar continued once again. "Here is your mission. You find him, charm him and make the connection." He handed Castiel an envelope. " Open it when I leave or I'll get curious and steal it." He winked at Castiel which made him finally speak up.
“I am in no way trained for speaking with traumatized children Sam.” Cas worries.
Being back on the road felt natural for all of them. Now that they had a game plan in mind, they set their sights towards catching their monster. It was, after all, what they all did best. The boys had finally settled in their usual arrangement, Cas opting for sitting behind Dean and Jack behind Sam. As the passengers each glanced out the window in silence, Dean grew slightly nervous. He was mulling over those pesky unspoken words in his head, trying to find that moment he was waiting for. The hunter would have killed for some kind of sign. He cleared his throat,
Dean hazarded a glance in the angel’s direction. They were walking side by side on a particularly long branch. The exertion from climbing had gotten to Cas. His cheeks were slightly flushed and his hair was starting to stick a little to his forehead. He had taken off his trenchcoat two branches ago and tied it around his waist. He was rolling up his sleeves as they walked and Dean’s mouth suddenly went dry at the sight of Cas’s strong forearms.
“No, she wasn’t physically at the ice cream establishment. She was using the bathroom faucet to communicate. Her voice sounded almost like painful wails to me, but it seemed to put the children in a trance-like state.” Cas supplies, pointedly looking at Dean as if asking for his corroboration.
The one thing, in all of his time as the angel of the tree, the only thing he ever wished for was to be able to hear Dean’s voice. It was the one thing he could not appreciate from his perch. He dreamed about it, tried to guess what Dean would sound like as he said his name. What he would sound like as he laughed. There had been one year, where he considered asking his angel friend Hannah to bring Dean to him so that they could meet. Yet, he stopped himself. Castiel might think Dean the worthiest being in the universe, but the hierarchy of their tree was simple. Middle ornaments could not mingle with upper ornaments nor lower ones. Everybody has their place in the tree and nothing can go against that. Not even the angel at the top.
Cas offered the recovered card to him, a shy smile on his lips. “I guess it's been too long since I was able to simply exist like this.” His voice held a certain warmth to it, one that his small smile betrayed even further. He was happy. It had been too long since Sam saw him like that.
“I fell from my post because I became...distracted.” Not the whole truth, but not a lie either. It was the best he could do right now.
Castiel seemed startled by the sudden interruption of their silence and he hesitated. Looking around, he couldn’t see any other ornaments hanging around them. He leaned against the wall and a nearby branch before sighing in defeat. He knew that he had to satitatie Dean’s curiosity if he wanted his help getting back.
Castiel stared at him for a few moments longer before looking away with a mumbled “No.” He looked up towards the tree, its height imposing from their current vantage point. “I need to get back.”
“Oh? Why the ring on your finger then? Hard to believe someone as
“Did they notice anything weird at the scene? Strange smells, drops in temperature, anything?” Dean inquires and goes to join Jack by the boxes of evidence.
“You know, I can’t really taste food like I used to Dean.” he tried to object “It’s all molecules to me.” The angel’s voice rang across the table, a warm smile on his face. Dean grinned and pushed the pizza slice closer to his best friend. “And yet, here we are.”
“What are you talking about Cas?” Jack says tilting his head slightly as he inches slightly closer to his father.
“Okay, Cas,” Dean whispered, still holding on to the angel’s hand. Sam stares wide-eyed, moving back and forth between his brother and his friend.
Cas looks at the locations and points to one in the far left. “This one is the closest to a water source. Considering how our monster takes its victims, this seems the most logical.”
“How did you snap the kid out of it?” Sam asks.
The angel ignored him and pushed aside some branches that were obstructing the path ahead of them. The branches parted to reveal a glimmering waterfall that fell into a tranquil river that flowed further into the forest. There were some lizards sunbathing on the rocks near the shore, keeping a wary eye on the birds that flew above them.
“I love you too,” the hunter whispered back, relishing in his boyfriend’s forestry smell which sent pleasant, warm bolts of lighting through his whole body. A radiating warmth and comfort settled in his heart, one that only Cas could be responsible for and one that he now recognized as his home. Cas was home now, which meant that so was Dean.
THE END
They all settled at a table near one of the windows, right underneath some lovely pictures of Mirna and her family. The moment Cas laid eyes on the picture, she walked through the kitchen doors and up to the counter to start cleaning it. A waitress came from the kitchen as well, holding some mugs and a pot of coffee. She was wearing a worn, pink dress that said
“Oh, but you would my dear,” the entity inexplicably managed to smile without a mouth and it sent a shiver down Cas’s spine, “you are an angel, and one day you will die again, permanently, and where do you think you’ll go?”
Dean steals the occasional glance at the angel, hesitant. He has a question he wants to ask, but he’s not sure if he wants to hear the answer. Yet, he doesn’t know when they will get the chance to be alone like this again. It might be his only chance. The sun keeps descending in the sky and the wind is slightly rustling the leaves above them.
“It does,” Cas agreed before staying silent for a beat. He came to a stop near the trunk of the tree and moved from under Dean’s grasp. He reached for the next branch before adding, “and yet, I was looking down at you.”
“Jack made a new beef stew recipe, it's pretty good so I brought you some” he gestured to the bowl and waited for his brother to take it.
Cas also noticed that Jack was gone. He must have woken up earlier and left to find Sam. He had left the angel’s trench coat neatly folded on the bed. Cas decided to get up and check for himself. Just as he finished getting dressed, Dean came out of the bathroom. There was no sign of his previous panic, which the angel was grateful for. He nodded once in Cas’s general direction without meeting his eyes and left the room. Presumably to meet up with his brother and son. Cas followed soon after.
Sam cleared his throat and snapped Dean and Cas out of their impromptu staring contest.  “So, uh I found a website for a place called
The hunter looks at his friend in the passenger seat for support, but Cas only shrugs. “Alright fine. We can keep playing house, but you better figure out what we are dealing with fast.”
Murmurs erupted around the room. Heaven did not have many 'assets' as Zachariah called them, and whenever actively using said assets was being considered, it indicated that something dangerous was about to happen. Before his audience could become restless, Zachariah continued.
“Alright, look it's not... That wasn’t what it looked like.” Dean sputters, trying to keep his eyes on the road.
Life as an ornament had never been easy for Dean. He knew he was privileged. He had a relatively high spot on the tree which meant that- for one night a year- he got to come alive with one of the best views in the house. His spot on the tree had many branches that were perfect for sitting in without slipping to the floor. Thanks to a particularly strong and long branch, he also had a prime view of the angel at the top of the tree. The same angel who sat at the place of honor which so many other ornaments wished they could even glimpse at. Dean had a full view of  him every single year. It was one of the few perks of being a middle ornament.
Cas had initially disapproved of playing the game with Jack, saying he was still too young to understand any of the context. Yet, the moment Jack had placed the cards: Donald Trump has nominated
"That's a nice compliment, but I am afraid not." Cas said through a soft smile, small creases appearing in the corners of his eyes.
It took Cas about 5 hours to reach the Winchester’s bunker. Once he woke up on Earth, his only prayer had been that he wasn’t too far from Lebanon, Kansas. Thankfully, his wish had been granted. The Sun was starting to rise slowly in the horizon, lighting the sky ahead in a wonderful flame. He was finally going home. He would be able to hold his son again, and this time he wasn’t sure if he would ever let go.
“Okay, and is there anything in the lore on how to gank the bitch?” Dean asks, moving to the mini-fridge to get himself another beer.
“And just like that, you knew he loved him?” Sam probed.
He didn't remember much of it, just got flashes here and there, similar to his memories of how he had felt when he saved Dean from Hell. Cas had to dig through miles of dark flesh, gore and soot to find the small, brilliant soul that was shining in the Cage, gasping and screaming for help - for release! - from his devilish prison.
Dean stares at his son before focusing on the road once more. He turns up the radio and they ride the rest of the way in silence once again.
Castiel nodded as he understood. "Because the usual methods don't work with them." Balthazar smiled and agreed, taking a sip of his drink. "Exactly, and therefore they require a more.. Personal approach. We have to open up the person's heart and soul to make them capable to love. We use Angels like yourself for this since you were once human, you can relate to them more."
The entity was pacing frantically in front of Cas now, It had given up on taking a physical form. It chose instead to present Itself as the embodiment of the black goo that laid at the angel’s feet. Even as It paced, the goo seemed to fall off its body, dripping like a leaky faucet of dread. For each drop lost, the goo from the floor would rise up through the entity's feet and snake around its body. It had no eyes or discernible face, yet Cas could feel the daggers It was staring into his soul.
He pinches himself and waits.
Every thrust into Dean pushed him dangerously close to the edge. Until one particular thrust had Dean seeing stars. Cas noticed how the hunter’s breathy moan turned into a guttural scream and quickly readjusted his hips to hit that precise spot again.
Jack’s eyes were wide with fear bubbling behind them. He worked his mouth open and closed, trying to speak, but found he had no words. Sam stepped closer to him and pressed his warm hand on his son’s shoulder. It was a reassuring weight and it helped Jack ground himself.
“Well, I guess you angels aren’t as all-knowing as you thought” Dean teased, his brow raised in Cas’s direction.
you to? Jack, if that was true you wouldn’t be here” Sam interjected, crowding closer to the boy.
“It...it means ‘lost or missing’ in Spanish,” Dean muttered while turning his attention to the cashier once more. “Say, how long has this been up?”
. A good memory.
Jack hesitated by the door. He wanted to say something, anything to help comfort his dad. He was about to apologize when Sam placed a well-meaning hand on his shoulder again. He met the long-haired hunter’s gaze as he shook his head. Jack understood. If there was one thing Dean needed right now, it wasn’t a hollow apology. It wasn’t being alone either, Jack thought,  but that was what Dean wanted. After all, want and need rarely overlap.
Dean was always popular. Ever since he could remember, people trailed after him whether it be because of his attitude or his looks. He always remembers that girl in the 8th grade, all hips no lips, that had written him a cutesy little poem about his name.
As Castiel turned to leave the brothers alone, he felt a hand grab onto his sleeve. When he turned around he felt arms wrap themselves around his vesse- his body. Dean was holding on to him like he never intended on letting go.
He examined the picture of the woman. She was tanned, with dark hair and a nice soft smile. Castiel thought she seemed pretty beautiful. He put her picture back in the envelope and took out the other. As he flipped it over to see it, he gasped. The man in the picture looked young and built. He had a soft arrangement of freckles across his face and an easy smile. However, what called Castiel attention was the man's eyes. They were a light shade of green that resembled a sort of magical forest on its own and somehow suited him beautifully.
Most ornaments ignored the human entirely, but he fascinated Dean. It was living proof that existence was more than just one single day of the year. There was more to life than just a singular tree they decorated. Dean longed to see that world. To find a purpose, his reason for being. Hell, maybe he could even find their creator one day. Dean had a couple things he would like to ask them… and maybe tell them.
Jack finds a teddy bear in one of the boxes and turns it around. A small string was hanging from the back of the bear’s collar. He pulls on it and finds a zipper which he opens. There was a battery pack inside. “Dean, why would a stuffed animal require batteries?” The detectives turn to look at what Jack is holding and scramble over quickly to take the bear out of his hands.
Cas nods solemnly and moves to get out the car. Sam follows suit and they make their way to the house. It’s a humble, single-story house in the middle of Vega Baja, a beach town. The house is worn down, but it still has a comforting vibe to it. You can hear the ocean closeby, a sound that Sam will never get used to. A lady answers the door after the first knock. She has short, grey hair that she has tucked away behind her ears. She eyes the men suspiciously, opening the door just a crack.
Later that same day, Castiel found himself staring at a park full of children. A park full of life that Heaven would have eradicated without a doubt, but the Winchesters had managed to save. As he sat there, on the park bench next to the Righteous man, Castiel found himself sinning for the first time. He confessed his doubts, trusted them with Dean. He finally allowed himself to question those orders that had always bothered him, deep down within his grace. The disputable actions he had seen some of his brothers and sisters take in the name of the 'greater good.' Looking back on it, Castiel would agree that was the day everything in him started to change. That was the day the Winchesters started to chip away at his angelic armor, so they could build him back up with their humanity.
“Did you have problems with the shower?” Jack asked, his brow furrowed. Sam gave a side-glance in Dean’s direction, trying to keep his composure. He had wanted to pretend he didn’t notice the strangely familiar bed head his brother was sporting when they walked in. Yet, the hand-holding had also given them away.
The strange angel winked at Castiel one last time before leaving with a sashay of hips with both a woman and a man in his arms.
Jack wasn’t the person he wanted to ask this to, but considering they weren’t home yet, he guessed there was no harm in trying. “Hey kid.” Jack hummed to indicate he was listening. Dean decided not to let his nerves stop him, like they had before. “Do you think your father is happy here?”
“Oh yeah? What’s that” Dean replied, trying to keep his voice from betraying him.
As the man sat across from him, Castiel stared as if he could see straight to the man's soul and figure out why he was drawn to him. Once again ripped from his thoughts when the stranger snapped his fingers in front of his face.
“I mean, I’m sure the gig comes with a hell of a view” Dean questioned, looking upwards.
“Get something that at least has some vegetables on it please.” the long-haired hunter begged as he started to pick up the playing cards they had left thrown across the table.
That was weird.
Dean, however… Dean was just
Dean stared dumbfounded at the sight before him for a few precious minutes before springing to action. He didn’t know what had gone wrong, but he did know one thing: Castiel was in trouble. That was enough to spur him into action. He rushed down the tree haphazardly towards the fallen angel and tried hopelessly to stay out of sight from the other ornaments. He wasn’t quite sure why he didn’t ask for help. Surely, Castiel would need it. But Dean also assumed that whatever had just happened could send their entire world order toppling over. The angel at the top was never supposed to
A tentative knock against his door startled him from his thoughts. He turned silently to face it, waiting to hear who was on the other side. A dangerous part of him, that one that held out hope, wished it was a certain miraculously resurrected angel.
After another swig, Dean turns to Jack and looks at him expectantly. The kid smiles and takes a moment to think. His hazel eyes brighten after a moment’s consideration. “I know! I saw a commercial for a place where we can fly kites. We could go there?”
“Who is up for a food run? Jack, you up for a ride?” Dean intervened just as Sam was collecting his 5th winning card in a row. Jack perked at the prospect of riding in the Impala with his father, yet a mischievous twinkle appeared in his eye as he asked:
"We will find a way Dean, but I believe Sam would appreciate it if you were around to see it." The angel said as he took the hunter's drink away from him. He had tried to stop him, Dean had been acting like this for weeks, but he refused to listen to reason. Grief was a powerful paralyzer.
Sam’s brow furrows, and then smoothes out. Oh. That’s what this is about. “I think-” A small smile spread across Sam’s face, he looks at his hands in his lap. “I think he still is. I think there’s someone in his life right now that makes him truly happy, but-”
“I don’t understand what you mean?” Cas shifts slightly away from the hunter, regardless.
, yes. Well, you need to try one of my
After trying and failing, yet again, at communicating with Dean Winchester from the other plane he was in, he decided to search for a vessel. By some mix of extensive research and pure luck, he found a man by the name of Jimmy Novak, the man that would later give him his body, his life, his everything. Something Castiel would forever be grateful for.
The quote that Cas finds on the table in this fic is originally written by Julia de Burgos, a famous Puerto Rican poet. :)
Dean set the map in the clearing between them and walked them through their strategy. “Based on where we are right now, we are only a couple yards away from the nearest cave entrance.” He points a little higher on the map from their current location, tapping the map lightly with his index finger. “It should be behind a waterfall, which makes sense considering the bitch seems to need water.”
A small smile cracked on Dean’s face at the thought. Taking a deep breath, he sat on the edge of the bed and pushed Cas slightly with his right hand.
“They’ll figure it out someday, don’t worry. Now get some rest” Sam turns off the bedside lamp next to Jack’s bed.
"Now, you are all probably asking yourselves why we care about two meaningless humans, among 7 billion others? Well, these two" He pointed accusingly to the images, like a clergyman condemning a witch to her pyre. "These two mere humans have killed approximately 1,000 of their species, trying to 'save' them from monsters. This has not only caused a boom in the Department of Deaths, as well as Purgatory, it is a grossly inefficient track record for our assets to have."
Sam’s eyes squint and he starts typing again. “Not sure. This says it can only be killed with a-” Sam’s eyes widen and his jaw drops slightly. Dean and Cas look at him expectantly.
With a steadying breath, Jack finally met Dean’s eyes as he questioned “Well, do you remember when I died and went to Heaven?”
“And if you can’t?” Dean asks, leaning closer into the angel’s space. The hand on his cheek is warm and grounding. He craves more of it.
Castiel turned towards Hannah, who was speaking to an angel seated beside her. He smiled, memorizing her grace's shine, knowing fully well it might be the last time he saw it. He gently grabbed her hand and watched as her head twirled rapidly in his direction. She seemed to be about to ask him something, but looked into his eyes and stopped. She knew. She had always been able to read his expressions and she knew. She tightened her grip on his hand, and let go, a faint smile on her face as she nodded minutely. That was all Castiel needed.
“Dean, I can’t go in there. I am trying to reach the surface”
Both hunters were practically immobilized by the sounds, dropping to their knees with their hands pressed tightly against their ears. For a brief moment, Dean was reminded of the last time he had felt like this. The pain he had felt when Cas tried to contact him in his angelic form. Somehow, the screeching that filled his ears now was worse. The angel, however, wasn’t affected. The screeching buzzed in his ears, but he was able to pinpoint the source of it.
Well, for Castiel it technically just had, but he would not dwell on these doubts until much later.
"Relax, little bro. This is for you." He hands Castiel the angel blade, eyeing him closely.
“Look, um how about you go get yourself whatever you want and we can get this show on the road.” Dean slides money across the table and the angel retrieves it. For a second his face lights up like a child on Christmas morning. Dean watched as his friend walked to the countertop, and cheerfully ordered for what seemed to be both of them. He took a moment to scan the rest of the tables, no one seemed to be acting suspiciously. A couple with two small children joined the table next to them.
“Yo, buddy. Sorry, I didn’t realize that it was a touchy subject. No need to get your feathers in a twist.” The moment the words came out of Dean’s mouth, he regretted them. Castiel’s stony gaze only made him regret it further and murmur a soft ‘sorry’ once more.
“The hell kind of angel are you? Angels have wings so they can fly, Cas. Everyone knows that?” Dean finished, his condescending tone was starting to get on Castiel’s nerves. He was so confused that the shortened version of his name went right over Castiel’s head.
The video showed a small child’s bedroom decorated with cowboys and horses. The bathroom was in the right corner of the video with the door wide open. The kid is sleeping in his bed, everything seems still. The boy starts to stir in his bed, and bolts awake. He sits perfectly straight on his bed for a full minute, before getting out of bed and moving towards the bathroom. The child walks into the bathroom and out of sight from the camera. He never comes back. Dean rewinds the video back to when the kid bolted out of bed. His brow furrows and he stops the recording. For a moment, he swears he saw the kid’s eyes shine light blue. Shifter?
An uncomfortable silence permeated the Impala, only the soft purr of the engine remained. Until it didn’t. Dean looked up and saw they had finally gotten back to the bunker. He cleared his throat and practically jumped out of the car the moment they stopped. “Uh, thanks for helping me get the food, Jack. Let’s go in before the pizza gets cold.”
Cas nodded and answered without breaking eye contact with Dean. “Together until death” he whispered. The moment the words left the angel’s mouth, Dean felt the same words bubble up inside him. They escaped his mouth without him being able to stop it. An intense warmth went through both of them once they uttered the words, which made both hearts race and thump rapidly against their chest. The air around them shifted, making the air seem cooler and the trees an almost impossibly vibrant green. At once the words disappeared and gave way to another marking:
Sam gives their son a warm smile and gently places a reassuring hand on his shoulder. “I think that sounds like a great idea.” He turns to face his brother and looks at him expectantly. Dean nods and reaches in his own bag to pull out a map of the forest. They had always been good at anticipating what the other needed. One of the perks of living life on the road together for over 30 years.
Cas looked at Dean once more with that furrowed expression and squinted gaze that could only be categorized as ‘fucking cute’. “What do you mean?” Castiel asked incredulously.
The hunter leads them closer to the coast. Families and couples are laying in the sand, basking in the warm sun and waiting for the sunset. The waves are crashing on the shore, slowly dragging the bits of sand away. Erasing the evidence that it was ever there to begin with. Suddenly, Dean turns away from the shore and starts heading towards some trees. Confused, Cas follows the hunter, ever loyal to the human. They come up to the thick bushes and trees, and Cas expects the hunter to stop, but he doesn’t.
He smiled fondly and reached for the hunter’s hand underneath the table and gave it a gentle squeeze. Dean glanced at the angel again and took the opportunity to place his arm around Cas’s shoulders. He relished the warm, fuzzy feeling it gave him in his heart.
Sam gave his phone to Jack and the boy nodded enthusiastically. “Yes! That is the place I saw. Can we please go? I want to learn how to fly a kite. Maybe one of you can teach me?”
“You may be onto something here, feathers” the entity spoke with his voice, yet something seemed off about it, slightly sinister, “if you were human, you would have no claim on this realm of mine. Hmm”.
Dean stopped solidly in his tracks, rendered speechless for a brief moment. Cas climbed up and held his hand out to help Dean up as well. He had a soft smile that Dean was quickly getting addicted to.
"There's a whole lot of people here waiting for you buddy! See you soon! Bye!"
That was the tipping point for Dean. Eleven years they had spent skirting around each other. Eleven years of finding a way back to each other again, of
Suddenly, the images behind Zachariah changed, revealing a terrifying darkness that could only be one place: Hell. Castiel took a moment to consider the little he knew about Dean Winchester. Hunter, detrimentally loyal, willing to sacrifice everything, which made Castiel wonder just how much was considered sacrificing everything. Though, staring at the image of Hell, the angel felt he already had an idea of exactly what Dean had sacrificed. Zachariah only confirmed his suspicions as he spoke.
Dean takes over the computer so he can read for himself, standing perhaps a little too close to Cas. A fact which is not lost on Sam, but he decides to ignore for now. “Alright so you found a lead at Blockbuster?” he asks, suspicious.
the top of the tree. Seeing something that suggested otherwise might give some of the wilder, unruly ornaments- “
Crystal’s face fell into a frown, her gaze dropped to her feet. “She is still pretty shaken up. I don’t really think that it’s a good idea.”
“Way to go, Cas,” Sam adds cheerfully. “Did you get a good look at her?”
Cas rolled his eyes and shifted to the left under the sheets. He left enough room for Dean to lay down next to him and gestured for the hunter to join him.
Cas turns to meet Dean’s gaze, a determined expression to his eyes. “You can come with me” a pause, “to the top”, he clarifies.
The cave was dark, barely any light made it through the waterfall. It was nearly impossible to see more than a few yards ahead of themselves. However, the soft scratches and wing flaps that resonated through the rock walls let them know that they weren’t alone. Jack turned on his flashlight and aimed it towards the deeper end of the cave, which startled a small nest of bats. They flew away, going over their heads to hide in another nook somewhere behind them. With the flashlight on, they could see the moisture accumulating on the cave walls, which made the entire space feel damp and sticky.
“They had one in the kid’s room facing the bathroom, which is where the kid disappeared. We checked the footage, but there was nothing on it.” Edgar plays the clip for them anyway, tension evident in their shoulders.
“Uh, well maybe? It depends on how you feel about the person I guess… why the hell are you asking?” Dean counters, confused.
They had tried sleeping apart, but halfway through the night, Cas couldn’t take it anymore. He had not left his heart on his sleeve just for Dean to turn around and try to pretend nothing happened. So, the angel stood up and made his bed hastily, resolute on sleeping in the hunter’s bed. When he reached Dean’s bed, he hesitated. What if he didn’t want him? What if Dean turned him away? Just as Cas was about to turn back, he heard the rustling of bedsheets below him. Dean smiled and raised the bedsheets, inviting the angel in. “What did I tell you about acting like a creep in the dark?” Cas chuckled and bent to join the hunter under the covers. He took in the warmth that suddenly enveloped him, and the comforting smell that was unequivocally
In turn, Dean stared at the angel. His dark hair was shining brightly in the summer sun, which only made his eyes look more impossibly blue. His trenchcoat was flapping slightly in the breeze, and for a second it gave Cas the illusion of wings. Dean forced his gaze away from Cas and towards their son. A small smile crept up on him.
?” the hunter stopped solidly in his tracks, almost colliding with the former angel. His eyes widened and became glossy with unshed tears, he sprung forward and pulled Cas into a hug that nearly broke his spine in half. Cas couldn’t help the soft smile that appeared on his face as he hugged the enormous hunter back. They were so close, if only he could make Dean understand.
“We know that all the children were six years old. Besides that, they don’t seem to have anything else in common.” Sam ran a hand through his hair and rubbed his eyes.
. It's an old Spanish fort in San Juan. By the looks of it, you can go fly kites and have picnics there.”
“But?” Dean asks as he shakes Edgar’s hand.
With that, she turned her head back to Dean with a smile. “Will you need anything else?”
“He didn’t leave Dean, he’s-”
Some of the parents mulled around them at the station, thanking them profusely for their efforts. The pure joy in the children’s faces made up for every drop of bloodshed. They had helped reunite families. Cas looked at his own makeshift family. Dean and Sam clearing up some final facts with the detectives, and his son Jack, who was currently at a vending machine buying a candy bar for one of the kids. The angel felt his heart glow as it filled up with love and pride. Each of them had their own wayward story, but they had managed to find a home in each other. That is something he would never give up.
. You can just fly right back up. I’ll probably be stuck with the long way up.”
. They had both seen the state that Dean had been in once Cas disappeared, and the worry kept gnawing the former angel’s heart. He never wanted to see Dean that low again.
Cas takes a moment to orient himself. He had woken up slightly earlier, but when he noticed Dean resting on his chest, he decided to let him sleep. He had looked so peaceful, he didn’t want to risk waking him by moving. What the angel didn’t understand was Dean’s reaction. He seemed nervous to have woken up like this. A part of him would go as far as to say he looked
It took all of Dean’s strength to reach up and cradle the angel’s face in his hands without shaking. Dean paused and searched Cas’s eyes for approval, he needed to know he wasn’t the only one feeling this. He knew he wouldn’t be able to come back from this. The angel’s reply came in a breathless whisper of the word that always came so easily to him:
in his hand to make his point.
Dean was jarred from his thoughts by Sam again, this time his ton eof voice was bit more serious. ''A co-worker of mine died this morning, i just got the email. A car accident.... Are you racing today?''
He was jarred from his thoughts when he heard his name be called. Closing his eyes, he focused on the sound inside his head, trying to pinpoint its source.
Thank you to the DCBB mods for arranging such a wonderful event for 10 years! It is truly a great feat.
“What exactly are kid-friendly spaces near water sources?” Dean asked, rubbing his eyes.
“You’re right, this shit didn’t used to bother me so much before…” Dean’s gaze fell on their son, sleeping soundly on the bed next to them. Cas followed his gaze and nodded in understanding.
As he strolled into the darkness of the abandoned barn, lights flashed and exploded into a thousand smaller sparks around him. He could feel their heat on his skin, he smelled the faint smell of grass and nature that he had missed since the last time he was on Earth. He even felt the thud of shotgun shells colliding with his vessel's chest. Yet, despite all of this the only thing he registered was the magnetic pull of the bright soul that stood before him. Dean's soul was less bright than it had been in Hell, due to the years of excessive abuse and torture he had endured in the dark realm. Yet still, Dean’s soul was unmistakably human, slightly blemished, but perfect just the same.
There was really nothing left for him now. Sure, there was Sam and Jack, but they could take care of each other. Bobby, Charlie, Rowena, Jo, Ellen, Mary, John and now
Dean and Cas managed to wrestle the blanket onto the ground, and Sam joined them soon after. The long-haired hunter continued his search for the missing children just as he had promised Jack. So far the case didn’t seem to turn up anything they recognized as signs of the supernatural. Maybe this was just a sad coincidence. Dean watched as Jack flew his red kite in the distance with nothing but pure glee on his face.
” A blush spread across Jack’s cheeks.
Dean stares at him a little longer, a smile slowing coming over his features. “You are a funky little angel, you know that?”
Castiel left the bar and decided to take a walk while he slowly opened the envelope. Inside he found two names, two pictures and a small description of one of the targets. He assumed this meant he had to track down this "Dean Winchester" first and then make him ready to connect with a "Lisa Braeden"
That was all the permission Cas needed. He sucked the head of the hunter’s cock tightly into his mouth and moaned as he tasted him properly for the first time. Dean grabbed tightly onto the hair near the base of the angel’s neck as a single moan escaped him. The angel’s mouth was wet and warm as he worked him, and Dean knew that this had to be what heaven felt like. Or at the very least, what heaven should feel like. He felt the warmth of his whole body start to pool at his gut, a familiar kind of electricity starting to build. Cas was moaning as he bobbed his head on Dean’s cock in earnest, taking his own cock in hand and stroking it to match his rhythm.
Dean rolled into the hotel’s parking lot with the radio blasting some local rock station. He slowly positioned the car into the parking space and sat there for a second after the engine sputtered off. The entire car had filled up with the tantalizing, sweet smell of Mirna’s
vivamus libero enim die, vel tenetur pro an aeternum
Dean: All of the above"

Dean was beautiful. Every year, the moment that Castiel opened his eyes, he would search out Dean. His heart would thump violently against his chest as he watched Dean wake and greet his brother. He always smiled when he saw him, a bright and shining sight which was getting more alluring every year. Thanks to his angelic powers, Cas could observe Dean in much detail. He could see his light blondish hair shine against the christmas lights and his perfectly fitted  clothes wrap around him gracefully as he moved. Castiel was the angel, but Dean was truly holy to him.

each other again. Dean dropped the bag he was holding and made his way towards the angel. They stood barely a hair’s breadth away from each other. Cas’s breath hitched as he stared at the hunter, eager to close the distance between them, but refusing to make the first move. He needed to know Dean wanted this. He needed to know that it wasn’t all in his head.
“Yeah sure, but I still pick the music.”
"These humans descend directly from Cain's own bloodline, which allows them to be the only vessels strong enough to hold our archangel brothers. Sam Winchester, the younger, is Lucifer's true vessel. However, Dean, the oldest, is Michael's true vessel. The Elders believe that if we manage to convince Dean to say Yes to Michael, we can finally win the fight against Lucifer, once and for all. Wherever Dean goes, Sam will follow, so we need to get him on our side, but there are... complications."
“That’s a nice theory Jack, but I am afraid that sirens don’t normally attack children,” Cas says as gentle as possible, trying to be supportive of his son.
"Don't ever change"
The taller one reaches out a hand to them first. “Hey, my name is Edgar. That’s my buddy, Carlos. Normally we wouldn’t be too keen on having the feds stepping on our toes.”
Two symbols that Cas would later recognize as the Enochian word for “Us.” But for that brief moment, Cas and Dean shared a single breath, a single body, and a single mind. The symbols somehow a tribute to their profound bond.
Sam is a recent graduate from Stanford working a job at a firm right out of college. He is married to Jess (yes the married early) and she is pregnant.
Dean quickly made his way to the angel and held him in his arms, fearing the panic that had set on his face. “Cas, baby. I don’t mean no to everything, just no to the shower.” He tried to get the angel to meet his eyes as he stumbled through his words. “I mean, it's not that I don’t wanna see you naked, cause trust me I am dying to, but I know I won’t stop and I want the first time to be special and not just a quick thing, cause-” The angel stopped the hunter’s litany of words with a deep kiss. Relief sunk in Dean’s shoulders, the fear that he had messed up melting away with every touch of Cas’s lips.
Cas wasn’t certain how much time had passed since he collapsed in front of the entity. He was laying on an uneven surface, trying to open his heavy-lidded eyes. He slowly propped himself up to a seated position and tried to force some sensation back to his weary face. Once he managed to open his eyes, all he saw was darkness. A cold shiver of fear ran through him as he realized the entity must have thrown him into the depths of the Empty again. His heart hammered in his chest as tears streamed down his face.
But he never reached his destination.
“Sure, we can stop by the store before leaving for the airport” the hunter murmured, trying to keep his voice steady. He sat up in his bed, stretching his arms above his head. He turned to set his feet on the ground, taking in the cold hardwood. His nightshirt stuck slightly to his chest, possibly from all of his tossing and turning the night before. He glanced briefly at the clock, 6:15 am it read. They were still a little early, but he decided to call his brother’s room anyways. Cas wasn’t exactly a morning person, so it would take them some time to get ready. He grabbed the phone on the nightstand next to his bed and waited. Six, seven, eight rings later there was still no answer.
“You got it. Keep us in the loop too.”
Dean and Sam turned to him then, a million questions and worries running through their heads. Jack kept staring at where his father used to be, and uttered a single word. One word that suddenly made the pit in Dean’s stomach drop even lower.
The first doubt: “
Sam stood up first, stretching his arms above his head as he looked towards the couple with a grin, “I’m gonna hit the hay, don’t stay up too late”. He nudged Jack’s side discreetly, prompting the boy to follow in his footsteps.
Crystal runs to hug her child, rocking her back and forth in her lap. “You better.” She snaps, making it evident that they had overstayed their welcome. They thanked her once again and quietly make their way outside. They shared a look as they walked towards their borrowed car, both of them silently deliberating what they had just witnessed. They got in the car and drove home.
Before he knew what he was doing, he was slowly leaning towards Dean, their faces a breath’s width away until Dean closed the distance between them. He felt the hunter’s soft lips against his own for a moment, making the warmth in his heart spread further down until those lips left as quickly as they arrived. It was a chaste kiss that lighted the hope within his newly human soul and left him desperate for more. Sam teased them immensely for it during the rest of their breakfast, but Cas felt so alive that he was practically vibrating in his seat.
“And you really want to try their ice cream.” Dean finishes for the angel, grinning when he sees the angel’s cheeks develop a slight pink tinge as he nods in agreement.
The angel forced himself to snap out of it. Shaking his head, he dove straight for the middle of the light that was Dean's soul, stretching out his arms as far as he could reach. Trying, furiously, to reach him until…
There were a thousand questions in each of the hunter's minds, but a small sneeze snapped them out of their racing thoughts. The five children were still sitting by the nearby tree, looking at the men intently. There were words left unsaid, and feeling left unchecked. But for now, they had children to bring back home. Saving people, hunting things, the family business.
He knew he should leave, but he couldn't bring himself to. At least not without saying goodbye. As he wriggled himself free from their embrace, he gazed at the hunters. A small smile flickered across his face as all the good memories they had together came flooding in. The fights, the banter, the drives, everything they had shared, seemed so precious compared to the rest of his long life.
She smiled at him and nodded as she went towards the back where a huge metal pot sat.
“Oh, nothing. Watching an Angel of the Lord playing playground parachute against the wind is something I didn't know I needed.” Dean sputtered through what could only be described as maniacal laughter.
He turned to face Sam nervously, but he just found the faces of his very accepting brother and son looking back at him. His nerves subsided and he relaxed back into his seat as he ruffled the former angel’s hair. “Yeah, Cas, that is still the term buddy,” he answered with a chuckle that practically screamed
” She invites the hunters into the room, and the detectives share a look before sighing and turning to them. One of them is tall with black cropped hair and hazel colored eyes. His partner is shorter, built like a linebacker, with a tattoo on his left forearm.
Cas turned to stare at the hunter as he lay on the ground next to him. They were all outside now, Sam and Jack having dragged them out of the cave once they collapsed. The kids were settled underneath a nearby tree, all huddled together for comfort. Cas opened his mouth to speak again, but the words wouldn’t come. He had no idea what had happened, only that he was here now, and that the burning in his arm was getting worse.
The hunters took advantage of the respite to lunge at the spirit’s form. Dean and Sam charged at her with their knives, but the spirit vanished from view. She reappeared behind them and pulled Sam back by his long hair throwing him to the floor. He swung his knife wildly ahead of him, trying to cut her on the way down. His knife managed to connect with her side, but simply went through her like she was made of air. She crawled over Sam’s form and raised her arms above her head. Sam closed his eyes and braced for impact, but before he could feel anything he heard a shrill scream. Dean had slashed at the monster’s arms and managed to cut deep into one of her arms. The cut leaked a glowing substance instead of blood, and she tried to stop the bleeding with her remaining hand. Dean paused to stare at the bloody knife in his hand. It was covered in a dark substance that he recognized as Cas’s blood from the night before, but now the tip was tinged with the same glowing liquid coming from the spirit’s arm. His eyes met his brother’s and his shock confirmed his suspicion.
“Sounds like a plan to me” Dean adds with a smile, and braves the distance he never thought he would cross.
“You were right, Dean. Driving by the coast is very liberating.” Cas turns to look at him now, catching the hunter red-handed staring back at him, making his cheeks flush.
“Yeah well your back ain’t as old as mine,” Dean grumbles.
you to fuck me Cas.”
A huge scream tore from Cas, screeching and jarring, it almost reminded Dean of the first time Cas had tried to reach out to him. But, this time it felt wrong, jagged and painful.
“Well, that is Team Free Will’s new motto right there,” Dean adds through a smile. He takes a picture of the quote with his phone, for safekeeping.
"Where were you?" she asked, her eyes bright in relief at seeing her friend. Her light blue eyes narrowed in suspicion. "Please tell me you weren't.." lowering her voice "strolling by the Human Heavens?"
“You-” Dean started, his voice rough and hesitant, as Cas turned to face him again, “You’re grounded now? No more wings or power-ups?” He couldn’t meet Cas’s gaze, his eyes seemingly fixed to the floor.
CHRISTMAS DAY, 12:20AM
. You are very brave.” Cas’s eyes soften as he fights to keep the tears at bay. He can feel the girl’s fear and pain as clear as a prayer. It smothers the entire room. He turns to face her mother. “We will find whoever did this, I promise.”
Jack stood quickly and made his way around the table to hug his father ,“Goodnight Cas, see you in the morning”. He then turned to Dean and -to the hunter’s surprise- he hugged him as well.
"I need to leave now," Cas said, his voice breaking halfway through.
“Great, we can get some nougat. I would love some nougat right now.” Jack added with a toothy smile.
"SILENCE!" Zachariah's voice boomed, urging into quiet the entire room. He cleared his throat, running a hand through his hair, trying his best to compose himself. "I know this topic makes us all restless, but please allow me to finish, for the elders have come up with a wise plan."
“How many?” she said while holding up a large white styrofoam cup.
The lady’s smile dimmed slightly when she caught a glimpse of his expression. She held his hand before giving him his change. “I can tell she meant a lot to you. It’s good to see a man care for his
"Yeah, I know i had the same reaction when I saw this guy. Thought it would fit you nicely." Castiel finally had the right mind to ask what was going on.
"To be able to convince Dean to say Yes, we must first get to him. Thanks to an incredibly stupid year-long deal this man made with Lilith – a groupie demon or so our intel suggests – Dean is now serving a sentence in Hell. He has currently endured what we calculate is about 38-40 years in his human time."
Sam gave his brother a horrified look, his eyes betraying more than he intended them to. “Don't. Move.” he ordered before leaving hurriedly to collect the first aid kit. When he returned, he found Dean in the same spot he had left him, still as a statue.
Cas stood still for the first time since he was dumped into this abyss. He held his hands out until they touched the oozing black walls that surrounded him. The walls were electric to the touch, yet fluid enough that he could run his hands through them. He felt small sparks everywhere he touched, almost as if he was touching pure energy. Pure... grace? The sparks burned him the closer his body got to the walls. Black goo stuck to his arms as he drew them back, startled, and then slowly fizzled away as he shook them.
The entity turned to him then, a blade materializing from nowhere as he lunged for Cas and held him in a vice grip. He stared at the angel for what felt like an eternity, a permanent grin on his face. “Or, I could just kill you again here, right now, and be done with you”.
She motioned for them to sit in the living room chairs. “Um, do you prefer English?” she mutters.
. For a moment, Dean could have sworn that Cas was staring at him. Yet, as soon as he tried to meet his eyes, Cas turned his attention away to the apparently fascinating window.
Dean got to work by serving up the rest of the breakfast, handing out each remaining coffee and pastry. Sam and his long limbs curled up by one of the beds with his food and the TV. Dean can hear him muttering with Cas about some show he had streamed last night on his laptop.
“Did you say something Cas?” Dean asks.
Jack smiled knowingly, “He was also knocked out. We are not entirely sure what happened, do you remember anything?” the nephilim asked, as he pointed to where Sam was watching Dean intently, trying to jostle him awake.
The station was crowded, different criminals being herded in for booking. Cops walking around discussing cases and even a jovial mail woman making the rounds around the office. Her metal cart filled to the brim with letters and packages with a radio precariously balanced on top. It was playing a salsa station they couldn’t really recognize, but she seemed to enjoy it as she sang the words under her breath. Dean and Jack made their way to the closest detective and flashed their FBI badges.
There’s a brightness in Cas’s eyes that intensified at the thought, almost like he knew what his friend was thinking. “No, that’s not-” Dean sighed and shook his head, a small grin on his face.
Mirna nodded her knowing approval, happy to see Dean enjoying himself. She finished giving everyone’s breakfast order and quickly left towards the kitchen, but not before winking in Sam’s direction. A gesture that was not lost on any of the other men, and they teased him endlessly for.
Sam’s words finally cut through the tension between Cas and Dean, making the strand of cheese droop slowly towards the table. Dean caught it in mid-air and ate the rest of it himself. His cheeks had turned a delightfully pink color that Cas was immediately drawn to. A sudden silence went over the room, leaving all four men slightly lost in their own thoughts.
“Maybe Sam and I can keep researching possible monsters, while you and Cas go out around where the children disappeared and try to lure it out?” Jack asked the table, unsure of how they would react.
“Uh, morning Cas.” The hunter mumbled as he shot up from their shared bed, nearly knocking over the bedside lamp in the process. He clears his throat and takes a scared glance down at himself. Still clothed. Good. “I'm gonna, uh. We need to. Yeah,”Dean stammered and proceeded to lock himself in the bathroom to get ready for their day.
“This shouldn’t be possible” It muttered to itself, its hands fidgeting at its side, “I dropped you into the farthest depths of this wretched place.”
“You’re washing the dishes? Now I know something is up,” Cas teased, his voice slightly rougher than usual due to all the laughing and screaming from their previous card game.
Reperio in te, electionem
It seems to be a trailer for something, but what catches Sam’s eye is the woman. The monster is a ghost of a woman that is terrorizing children, seemingly shocking them to stay still. Interesting. It’s a trailer for a horror movie.
Escape. He still needed to get out of here. He needed to reach the surface again. The corridor he had been walking through was an expanse of nothing no matter which direction he faced. Unless, he didn't face the corridor. What if he faced the walls?
we were kinda in the middle of something” he took his eyes off the road briefly to try and meet the former angel’s eyes before turning away again as he tried to fight the nerves that were growing within him. A quick glance towards the passenger seat confirmed Cas was still listening and had now turned to fully face the hunter.
Sam is about to agree when Jack intervenes. “Actually, maybe you should stay out and find another place with children. You stopped it once, but maybe it still wants to try again.”
Dean would make sure of it. As he woke to the new day, pulled from his dreams by his phone ringing, he swore tio himself he would kill Garth. It was waay too early to be up. Especially after such a late night party last night. However as Dean reached for his phone, he frowned. It was Sam. Normally, he would be delighted to hear from his little Sammy, but it was early and that gigantor brother of his wouldn't call so early other than in an emergency.
As Dean got over being rudely interrupted he decided he should probably be heading to the party so he got his car keys and drove.
Cas gave the entity his best approximation of a deadly smile, one he had learned from Sam. “And I thought you were done trying to control me, I suppose neither of us is getting what we want”.
A waitress with strawberry blonde hair came to deliver Balthazar's drink, lowering herself a bit more than necessary into his space and leaving with a wink. The angel before him smirked in her direction before turning his attention back to Castiel. "Are you a mute love?"
”, the entity claimed with disgust. It looked at Cas as if he was sizing him up. “Perhaps, there is something very human inside you already. Maybe that is why you are so insufferably hard to get rid of.”
The next morning, on the way to the airport, Dean kept his promise. As he drove up to the familiar little coffee shop, he drummed his fingers against the wheel and whistled softly along to the song on the radio before turning it off.
"I volunteer to save Dean Winchester and convince him to join our cause." Though his voice was sure and firm, his hands betrayed him. They shook, and he tried to close them into fists, attempting to hide them. He knew what this mission might mean, but something deep inside him told him it was right.
Dean wished he could say that they were now on even footing. Yet, as he took in the sight of Cas’s shirtless, strong, and tanned chest, flushed cheeks and eyes drowning in lust, Dean finds himself completely positive that he had died and somehow went to heaven.
Maybe not exactly the one he had been tasked with in the beginning, but the one he was destined to do regardless. He brought the Winchesters together again. He gave them something no other creature had ever done before, life without a price. A time where they could start over new. They had saved the world, now they just needed to save themselves.
They come to a stop in front of a small wooden fishing shack. It’s a small one-room store, filled with freshly caught fish. It’s right in front of the coast, where people tended to buy their food and enjoy it with their feet in the sand. Dean discovered this place the first day they arrived and had been longing to come back. He removes the keys from the ignition and gets out of the car. His friend follows.
Jack’s head tilted slightly to the right in a way that was extremely reminiscent of his father. “Misses what, Dean?”
He could feel himself rising. It felt strangely reminiscent of pulling Dean out of Hell. If Hell was a giant puddle of black Jello instead of a den of horrid monsters and iniquity that wanted nothing more than to kill him slowly. However, the warmth that spread across his body and slowly pulled him closer to what Cas hoped was the surface, reminded him vividly of Dean. Reminded him of putting his hand around his lover’s shoulder, marking him with their newly formed bond. A mark that, though not physically present anymore, was still seared onto Dean’s brilliant soul. Cas loved getting lost in the memory of it.
. With the family I see.” Mirna smiled brightly at all of them as she set Dean’s plate in front of him. She had an air of caring and strength about her, and she reminded Sam of Missouri. One glance at Dean told him he felt the same.
Sam gave a small chuckle before he approached his brother and friend and wrapped them both into a group hug that Jack jumped into at the last minute. Cas was surrounded by his family, down to every last inch of his now human body. For the first time in eons, he dared to allow himself the true, unbridled happiness he had always longed for. This time, that happiness truly came with no strings attached, which made his newfound freedom that much sweeter.
They finally pull into the diner’s parking lot with a bright neon sign that reads ‘Bebo’s Cafe’. Sam and Cas were already there, getting out of the car once they saw Dean park. They made their way inside and sat in a booth not far from the restaurant’s entrance.
He moves away from the hunter, clearing his throat as he lets his gaze fall to the floor. “I hope that it was enough,” Cas adds, his voice rough. His true meaning hiding behind his rough words.
Castiel made his descent slowly into Hell, fighting and breaking free from the different creatures and cursed souls that were clawing at him, screaming in agony. Ever since he had accepted his mission, his mind had been constantly reeling with questions and doubts as to why he had chosen this path for himself. Better angels than him had tried and failed to infiltrate the dark depths of Hell, why did he think he would do any different?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Yes, but they turned up with strange markings on their chests. Two circles with a line cutting through them.” Sam showed him the drawing he had made on a piece of paper.
Gabriel sighed, visibly sagging in an obvious growing annoyance. "Basically, Im a very strong angel, when you died I heard you screaming how you were not ready blah, blah, blah... And decided to give you that second chance with a price."
Dean is shocked into silence. He remembers Cas confessing months ago, but he couldn’t bring himself to think that it was anything other than familial… Yet, now he’s here, saying everything Dean never thought he would hear. He doesn’t know what to do, he feels lost. Someone just pulled the rug out from under him, and he can’t quite get back on his feet. The silence drags on for so long, the sun has already set and night has slowly draped over them.
The overwhelming relief and joy he felt at seeing the familiar, crescent moon above him was nearly indescribable. He had done it, he really had done it. He placed his hands more firmly on the ground and used them to push himself up to stand. He stood there for a moment, taking everything in as if it was the first time he set foot on Earth. The cold, night breeze nipped at his trench-coat covered skin, a little more presently than usual. As he breathed, he could see his breath puff out in front of him from the cold.
He slowly drew some of his grace back from his hand, bracing himself for the pain of the sparks, yet it never came. His hand went softly through the goo, the sparks feeling like soft prickles against his skin. Suddenly, something held his hand in a vice grip. It surrounded him, a gleaming warmth that didn’t hurt, but didn’t recede either. He gasped and tried to pull his hand back when he heard a sound.
Edgar and Carlos share a strange look. “No, nothing like that. Hell, we really are grasping at straws here. We don’t have DNA, fingerprints or anything.” Edgar responds eventually.
“Yo buddy, watch where you’re going!” He hollers at the young man that shouldered past him, in a hurry for no apparent reason. Fucking teenagers, man. He bends over to pick up his keys, muttering under his breath. Sometimes he wishes teenagers were more like Jack, sweet and not fucking running everywhere. Then again, Jack flies a lot, so. Yeah, maybe it's best that teenagers don't have power-ups.
It was dark, he could see nothing around him yet he felt as if he was.. Rising. It was with a slow dreaded feeling that he realized he was dying. He was rising to heaven, his regretably new home. A rush of panic flooded through him, his mind filling with the same thoughts: "I'm not ready yet... It's not my time... I'm not ready..."
“Just in time buddy, we got a lead.” He helped Cas with setting out the food on the table.
He meets the hunter’s gaze. “I love you, Dean. I have known that for years, but it is only recently that I have come to accept-” His stomach drops, afraid of saying what he knows out loud. “Accept that you don’t feel quite the same way. You said it yourself.” For a second, Dean seems to be about to protest, but Cas can’t let himself hope like that anymore.
“That will be $45.67, handsome.” The young man at the cash register said with a wink. Dean felt his face warm slightly as the blush spread through it. The hunter developed a sudden interest on the floor and cleared his throat. The cashier smirked and proceeded to pack up their items in a paper bag. The flirtation was not lost on Cas’s ears. Even if he was currently near the back of the store flipping through a magazine, perhaps a little too forcefully.
The angel had no time to sigh in relief, since the moment his feet touched the floor a searing pain burned from the tip of his wings to the base of his spine. Cas howled in pain as he felt like he was burning from the inside out. Darkness faded into the edges of his vision, the pain making him teeter closer towards unconsciousness. Through the flashes of pain and his incoherent screaming, Cas heard two words that settled like balms in his heart.
Cas sighed and took a breath as he was about to say something when-
Dean’s tears came unbidden as he captured the former angel in another searing kiss. He tried to press their bodies impossibly closer as he let his hands roam towards Cas’s naked back. He had never felt this kind of unconditional devotion and love in his life, and he realized that he was probably going to become addicted to this feeling.“I love you too, Cas” Dean mumbles between kisses and is immediately rewarded with an almost-sob from the former angel.
Cas realized what he had done and quickly sat up to check on the hunter. He held on softly to Dean’s arm. “Are you okay? I'm sorry” his voice soft, afraid he might scare Dean off. The hunter chuckled, like Cas could ever do anything to make him leave. He smirked at Cas, “I’ll be okay when you’re inside me.” Those simple words seemed to ignite a flame inside the angel and he quickly bent down to take a bottle of lube out from the bag near the bed. A bottle that Dean would later remark as being conveniently placed, earning him an eye-roll from his lover.
Walking into his bare bedroom, complete with a queen sized bed and even bigger TV, he stripped off his clothes and threw himself onto the bed. He couldn't help but note how big the bed felt to him that night, the uneasy feeling of something being missing was calling out to him even more. He suddenly found himself thinking of the listless amount of women he had slept with over the years, while they gave him momentary pleasure he just couldn't find it in himself to feel happy about it. He was older now and he even considered the thought of trying to find someone stable.
“Let me just say something first, please?” Dean pleaded, and Cas nodded for him to continue.
Dean catches the angel’s hesitation. “Do you have an idea of where to go Cas? I’m all ears.”
Cas meets the hunter’s eyes briefly before trailing slowly down his body. Taking him in for the last time. His gaze stays fixed towards the ground between them. The silence between them is charged, making the tension almost palpable. “I thought I made myself clear months ago in that barn when I thought I was dying.” His voice is barely above a murmur.
he thinks. Never has he seen such beauty condensed into one place. One location filled to the brim with new sounds and familiar tastes. Well, at least this is what he wishes his heaven could be. Not one filled with dick angels that couldn’t care less about Earth. He shakes his head. He promised he wouldn't think of work. For all of their sakes. Chuck knows they need the break.
about you. Something wrong”, the entity swung its arms out dramatically, looking every bit like a Dorian Gray dipped in tar.
Dean’s blood was rushing to his ears, buzzing loud enough to almost drown out the rest of the world. He only had eyes for Cas at that moment, and his fingers twitched as he ached to touch the angel.
Dean, on the other hand, had refused to accept Sammy's death that way. At least, that’s what Cas found out years later. The hunter had confessed he had several thoughts run through his mind that night, as he had taken what had felt like his millionth shot. "There's a way to get him out, there has to be", “This is all wrong”, and “It should have been me” were just some of the very thoughts that Cas had found mostly heartbreaking.
Looking at Cas now, he realizes he has never seen so much
With a joyful sigh, he responded, “I wouldn’t have it any other way” before diving in for a kiss. The moment that their lips touched, Cas was reminded of their very first kiss. The electric waves of joy and pleasure that erupted from him now paled in comparison to anything he had ever felt before. Because this time he knows, this is his forever. There are no more secrets or burdens between them. They are finally free to be as they are, together and loved, for the first time in decades.
Their drive started out rather quietly, both just content to be in each other’s presence. The silence between them had always been comfortable. They understood each other wordlessly most of the time, putting into their actions what they had never been able to put in words. Of course, until two weeks ago. When the dam of their love finally had finally broken and let their pent up feelings flow over them both, drowning them in the relief of finally understanding what they meant to each other. But then the Empty had come and separated them.
But even with all the success his life had turned into, Dean couldn't help but want something more. It wasn't tangible to him what exactly he wanted but especially when he looked up at the stars he felt something was missing.
Their waitress came to the table then and started taking their orders. Jack decided to try some of the local food, while Sam and Dean stuck to their classics. Once the food came, their son stared wide-eyed at the huge plantain bowl filled with shrimp that was set before him. The hunters stared too, it smelled delicious and for a second they considered getting it instead of their meals. Maybe next time. After the waitress left them alone to enjoy their meal, they brought out their notes on the case and walked each other through what they had learned.
“Here you go.” She placed it between the coffee cups with a warm smile. “No one can stay sad with one of Mirna’s famous
“It seems like they have a wonderful and peaceful existence here. It’s almost un-
“So, um do you have large coffees?” He tried using his hands to mime a huge cup. He really needed the caffeine boost.
Garth was sitting next to him at the bar, trying to explain a possible business deal but Dean was only half-listening, as dense as he was , Garth had proven quite competent at picking out his races so he trusted his decisions more than his own. Especially after what were now 6 shots. Dean turned around and glanced at his watch. 3:45am seemed to him a decent time to excuse himself from the party and leave, the club was close to his apartment building so he decided to just walk back home.
Sam grinned to himself, content to see the smile return to his brother’s face. He had missed seeing him be so at peace. Jack, on the other hand, was elated to see his dads finally enjoying and expressing their love for each other. The boy had a seemingly permanent toothy grin whenever Dean and Cas would exchange a look, or a small touch across the table. If they noticed the pictures Jack kept sneaking of the two of them with his phone, they surely never mentioned it. And if said pictures found their way into a picture frame on Jack’s desk, right next to the frames of his mom, Mary and Sam, well they didn’t mention that either.
“Jack, come and take her back towards the entrance.” Sam’s voice boomed in Jack’s ears, snapping him out of his frozen shock. He scrambled to help the little girl stand and tried his best to smile comfortingly at her. Even in her daze, the sight of a younger face seemed to help soothe her. She was covered head-to-toe in dirt and grime, and her other hand was clenched around a small cloth doll. Before Jack could usher her back towards the entrance to wait for the others, she grabbed hold of Sam’s sleeve. Her brown eyes stayed glued to his shirt, unable to meet his eyes. She whispered in his ear, “Bad lady has more kids…” her small hand shaking as she pointed towards a dark tunnel that lay straight ahead of them. Sam nodded and whispered his thanks before signaling Jack once more.
“I don’t think he misses Heaven... I think he found something worth staying on Earth for. He made his home,” Jack assured him, his voice soothing enough that he hoped his father would get his message.
With everyone on board, Sam starts packing up their gear. He hands Dean one of their spare iron knives, and sends him and Cas off to their own room. Something about not wanting to be around for the bloody mess. They didn’t blame him.
Their line of work required sacrifice. Every morning, hunters knew what they had signed up for. A life full of pain, death, and suffering. Yet, it was days like this that helped Sam and Dean remember why they had decided to live life on the road.
Dean looked into the blue eyes and saw a glimmer of something there. Something that helped him push through his next words.
Cas took the paper and regarded the symbol. His brow furrowed and his head tilted slightly. “Yes, this is from a bonding ritual.”
That’s when it happened. As Dean saw those fiery dots in the sky, a memory that was buried deep from years of disuse came back to the forefront of his mind. He remembered the day the angels fell, and the fireballs he watched tumble from the Heavens as he stood outside of that cursed church. The day that going back to Heaven had been officially burned from Cas’s destiny. There was no going back for him after Metatron. Yet, after all these years Dean had never quite realized it. Deep down, he had tried to ignore the weight of the sacrifices that Cas had made for them, as if ignoring them would make them any less true. Yet, the truth was that their goofy angel had gone to bat for them in more ways than one. Without hesitation, and -hopefully- without regret. His train of thought brought up a question that he had not thought to ask after all these years.
“Woah, Cas! What was-,``''Are you okay?” Sam and Jack each questioned. Sam’s brow furrowed as he stared between the angel and his brother.
Both angels knelt before the plants, taking in the other wild specimens growing with abandon. Each inch that they claimed felt like another inch that nature won over humankind. A small space that these delicate flowers managed to carve for themselves in a world that made it impossible to breathe. Cas found a kindred solace at the thought.
“There are only three that are accessible to the surface.” He points at their locations in the map.
Dean grabbed Cas’ hand and made their way to Sam and Jack’s door. They knocked and waited for an answer.. Cas had once had the ability to fly, yet he had never felt as free as he did in this moment. Jack answered the door and looked down at his father's clasped hands. A bright grin lit up his entire face and he jumped to hug both of them.
Dean had stopped blushing after a couple of branches, but the weight of Cas’s admission kept revolving in his head. The angel at the top of the tree had fallen from said top because he was looking at
He remembers hearing Sam chuckle at his brother, but not making any move to correct his words. They all knew it was true. Through thick and thin, through hell and high water, they would always be there for each other. Cas still wishes they could go back. The fondness that the memory brings him, fills him with pride, even to this day.
?” He added with a smirk. Sam snickered and moved past them towards the water. Dean rolled his eyes and tried to pretend he didn’t hear the angel sass him, but the warmth in his cheeks betrayed him.
“Any ideas on how exactly to do that Cassie? HMM?” the entity rested its arms on Cas’s shoulders, almost as if it was considering how to swallow him whole and make him disappear.
“Man, we have been through a lot of shit, but...” a small sigh escaped him as he reached for the beer they had bought earlier. He offered one to Cas and one to Sam before taking one for himself, “It’s good to see that at least one of us is still happy.” He feigns a cheer by raising the beer in the air and takes a swig.
. This memory nearly suffocates him, filling his vessel with dread as heavy as lead.
“Alright, so the kid said she was being held in a cave?” Dean asks, looking at the pictures of the drawings that Crystal had sent them for reference.
Cas smiled softly, savoring the feel of Dean’s arm around his shoulders as they walked down the new branch. “I am inclined to believe that being an angel is not as glamorous as it may seem.”
