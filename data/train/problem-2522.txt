, so it didn’t take a stretch of the imagination to see why the vampire now had Greg pressed up against the wall with his teeth bared. He growled and hissed, his eyes turning completely black as the vampire inside him leapt to the forefront to protect John’s body.
He had stripped the man of all of his clothing save for a pair of black pants. It was so invigorating to be able to touch a vampire who wouldn’t hurt him, or perhaps couldn’t hurt him,
“Okay,” was all John could think to say.
Silver eyes opened fully to look up at John, who gave a small thankful smile. “Whoa,” Sherlock said, putting his hand against his neck to feel if there were any bite marks. “That was…that was,” Sherlock started, but when he tried to sit up, his head fell back down like a rock.
“What?! No fucking way. Look at how well you did last time getting her back.”
“Why would you want to do that?” Sherlock drank the last of his milk.
“Thank you,” Sherlock tipped the man generously because he was a generous man. He grabbed the shoes, mobile, longboard, and note, then hopped out of the car, the smell of salt water filling his nose.
“What the fuck happened?” The man’s voice was angry and Mycroft could tell he was driving.
John sighed. “As I already explained to Greg, which I’m sure you saw on the surveillance videos,” John accused, angry that he hadn’t spotted them before now. It was the only explanation for why Mycroft showed up after Greg’s attack. “Sherlock is a new vampire. He is strong, he is hungry, and, as you very well know, he is manipulative and brilliant. These traits are like tender just ready to be set ablaze by the presence of blood. This is dangerous, both of you knew that before offering to help.”
The drive was rather pleasant once he got out of London and the thoughts of seeing his John’s face kept the raging war in his mind calm. He pulled up to the front of the shopping Centre and didn’t even try to hide the moan that escaped his lips. He checked his phone.
He blinked a few times and shook his head, realizing it was all just a dream. It might have been a dream, but he found his cock to be moist and tingly, as if it had all really happened.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m just about done.” After a few moments, his cock fell flaccid again, giving John the go ahead to turn off the water and reach for a towel. He dried himself off with the fluffiest towel ever and stepped out covering himself from the hips down.
“You had that dream again,” it wasn’t a questions. Sherlock knew, he always knew what was going on in the Doctor’s head.
“I-I didn’t want him to go but he wanted to leave. Then, he ran away,”
And there it was, another piece of John to collect in his mind palace. In the deepest cavern, past the skeletons and cobwebs where no light ever shown, that is where John would fall… and Sherlock would keep him.
The Sub looked down at the clear pieces of plastic in his hand. They felt heavy, like a weight on his shoulders that he couldn’t get off no matter how hard he shrugged. The Resistance had their barbs in him, just like the Holmes’ had their own stuck right in the back of John’s neck.
As the hand trailed down over his ear, John shivered slightly until the hand came to rest upon a collar. When he tried to look down, however, searing pain shot through his neck, sending shockwaves all the way down to his toes. “Hnnng,” John whimpered, squeezing his eyes shut.
Jim flinched, unconsciously scooting closer to Greg. “Jim,” Greg said softly. He gave Sherlock a look that didn’t seem to have any effect. “Jim, is there anything you can remember? Anything at all?”
“Yeah,” John agreed because he remembered all the videos he’d watched with the bottoms moaning and sometimes crying. That was just sex and if Sherlock said it would get better than it would, because he knew a lot more about it. “Hurts,” John whimpered when it felt like soap was being rubbed into a raw cut on his bum. He tried to look down when he thought he saw more red flowing down the drain, but Sherlock grabbed his chin and coaxed him into a deep soothing kiss.
“Mycroft,” Sherlock greeted and lowered his bow.
“Sherlock,” John sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose, “this isn’t some game. It’s not good for you to be feasted on every day. Plus, I need to know what’s going to happen to me at the end of the week. Is your brother going to release the entire league on me because I’m drinking from his baby brother?”
John’s face turned bright red, unsure if Sherlock was serious or just messing with him. Then, another text came.
“I,” John swallowed, “I…”John thought about telling the truth; how he jerked off every morning thinking about Sherlock, how he loved to be fed by him, how he loved to sleep next to him, how he loved when Sherlock whispered in his ear and played with his hair, how he fucking loved Sherlock Holmes. But, he couldn’t say all those things, not when Sherlock obviously didn’t feel the same way. “I knew your brother would have me tortured if I didn’t save your stupid arse.”
“Alright,” Mycroft told him, patting John’s thigh gently before opening the car door and stepping out. John hadn’t even realized they were stopped, but went to follow the Dom nonetheless. He was halted by a hand on his shoulder though, and turned back around to look at Sherlock questioningly.
“Mycroft, he’ll be fine,” Sherlock told him, but Mycroft just glared at him as only he could.
“Thanks, Sherlock,” John said sarcastically, “that really makes me feel better.”
This was it, John knew exactly what these people wanted from him. They wanted nails for Sherlock’s coffin but he would be damned if he gave them one speck of anything that would hurt the man. “I-I asked him to kiss me…”
“John…you said, ‘when we got to our flat,’ did I hear that correctly?” Greg asked.
“I couldn’t, I just know how much you turn me on-uhmph,” Sherlock couldn’t stop the groan that escaped his lips so he played it up dramatically to the boy on the other end of the phone. “I was kind of hoping you feel the same way. If you don’t that’s cool, I just wanted-“
“You fought through the defense mechanisms your body set in place. You’re cured, John. I’ve cured you.” Sherlock stood up and began pacing in front of John’s hospital bed.
Honestly, he was disappointed in himself more than he was with John. Of course there would need to be punishment for his actions of try and call his mother, which went without saying, but in truth, the detective should’ve known it was too soon to test the young man’s state of mind and trust. It was the knocking, Sherlock decided, that had startled his boy into making a rash decision. If given the proper time to mull over his options, he was positive John would have chosen to leave the bait on the side table. Nevertheless, it was only a test and Sherlock had routed the number to connect to his phone instead of his mothers, but John didn’t need to know that; no, all the boy needed to know was that he tried to call his only family member to come save him and they didn’t answer.
“Oh, umm, okay,” Greg said, going to the cabinets to find her something to eat.
Though Sherlock couldn’t be completely trusted, he was a Dom after all, John knew out of all his options this was the best bet. He had no idea what Sherlock was planning or why he had seemingly enjoyed watching John ram himself into the glass, but he did know it was a thousand times better than being strapped down to a table for experiments. Sometimes, John thought, the devil you don’t know is better than the one you do.
Sherlock looked down at his handy work, noting how the pink tones created almost a blush color on John’s skin. He couldn’t wait until the scar healed and John would see it every day, reminded his fragile mind that he had a home. Also, Sherlock thought dubiously, he would see his initials whether he fucked John on his back or on all fours, which was always a plus.
“If we wait, it will only get better and then when I finally let you come,” the man smiled, showing every pearly white he had, “well, let’s just say you’ve never felt any pleasure so intense in your entire life. Now, do you trust me to make you feel good?”
Sherlock didn’t understand until the boy spoke through endless sobs. “Y-You lied to m-m-me! Y-You said I was spe-special.”
The confusion and shock on Greg’s face was interrupted by a loud bang as Sherlock threw the door open dramatically. “John! Thank God!” he said, taking two long strides to end up by John’s other side. He gently ran his hand over the gauze, the anger and sadness clear in his eyes.
“Umm,” the rebel said, starting to panic when John’s face paled. “Umm, Amy, I think you need to pull over for a tick. Don’t you dare throw up in this car, kid.”
“You’re sorry?! What, he drank from you on accident?” Mycroft said, taking a step forward and clenching his fist together. He wanted to strangle the life out of this vampire right now, but he knew he would have to be calm if he was to find out more of Sherlock’s…condition.
“I need the surveillance tapes from the conference.”
“He’s broken,” was all Greg offered.
“The Rebels, they…they taught me how to make my own bliss. I used it so I wouldn’t be scared or feel any pain when I ran into the building.”
“I fell down the stairs,” John said, keeping his eyes level with Greg’s to convey that he was telling the truth. “We were playing and I tripped. Sherlock was able to fix me up, he knows what he’s doing when it comes to that kind of thing. I’m fine now, though,” John smiled and lifted his arm up to show its full mobility and to prove how well Sherlock took care of him.
“Shhh, you’re alright, Sherlock,” John said quietly, petting a cold hand through his hair. At that one touch, tension started leaking out of the young vampire’s body. It was as if John could release some sort of relaxing pheromone that only affected Sherlock. “We’re not going to hurt you, I promise, love. We just want to help you, okay?”
“Cool,” John smiled, trying not to show the concern and confusion on his face. “Where did you get that?” He examined the bar, making sure no one was trying to poison her.
“I told you it was dangerous,” a voice, Sherlock’s John decided, was angry, “he flat lined for thirty seconds! John’s death would have been on your hands and everything I’ve worked for would have been ruined.”
He didn't realize until the next text that for some reason his pants started to get a bit tighter at the thought of Sherlock wanking.
“John,” he whined again, gripping Mycroft’s sleeve. “I think…I think I’m changing. Please…please, My, I need John.” Sherlock’s voice was pleading, a tone Mycroft had never heard before.
“Greg?”
“John…John….John wake up,” a voice whispered to him, jostling him enough to make his ribs ache.
“No,” John whispered, when the name changed to ‘Sub John Watson, Died at age 16’ written on the white stone. He looked up to see hundreds, if not thousands of tombstones spread across the field.
“Ha! No, it was delicious, I was just…never mind, I’m fine let’s get back to the applications, yeah?” John tried to change the subject quickly, not wanting Sherlock to know he was questioning their friendship.
“Well, ummm, yeah…yeah I am. I know I shouldn’t be it’s just I haven’t found-“John began stuttering, embarrassed at both the question and admitting his inexperience to an older bloke. Sherlock smiled as he began rubbing himself through his trousers.
“Get in,” Sherlock told him, but continued to stare.
Chapter 9 – You Know My Name
Enjoy!
“What the fuck does that mean!?” John whispered, angry and determined to prove he was old enough keep up with the seventeen year old. He did get hard a lot during school but he was usually able to hide them or calm himself down until he got home.
John, however, did not seem as excited. However, Sherlock couldn’t blame the boy for being scared, so he just simply held him tighter, wrapping his legs around the shorter ones. “Sherlock, no! Don’t you dare!” John squeaked, bucking his hips up of the bed in panic.
“Easy,” Sherlock said, rubbing John’s chest and belly like he was a scared animal. “Don’t look yet. I don’t want you to see your ankle,” Sherlock said, while Mycroft began unwrapping John’s ankle.
John shook his head and tried to discreetly open the door behind him, in hopes of…well, he really didn’t know what he would do if he got out of the car. Mycroft sensed his movements though, and wrapped his good arm around John’s stomach, squeezing just on the wrong side of pain. “Oh no you don’t,” he said. “I’ve got him Sherlock. Go ahead.”
Jim’s words echoed through Sherlock’s brain, words that he knew must be true but he was still unable to accept them. He had to rid himself of this blight, this last coal that kept the tar boiling inside him. If not to save him, then to save John, his beautiful sweet John who would follow him into the dark and back without ever being asked.
“Show time,” Sherlock clapped his hands, unable to wipe the giddy smile from his face just from being able to watch his John in his own environment. The boy ran his hand through his hair,
Chapter 6 – What You Wanted
If his brother found out about this, there would be hell to pay. Not to mention all of his work would be cast aside and John would be murdered. John was the first innocent vampire he’d met, and Sherlock sure as hell wasn’t about to let anything happen to him. Surly Greg could see that John was different, surely.
Enjoy!
The man tried to talk, but only a string of mumbles that no one could understand came out. John looked at Matt, who just shook his head. “I’ll get this one a cab, then,” John laughed.
Only moments later, there was a slight buzzing in his side pocket. Someone was calling him on his private mobile.
Sherlock had gone back and forth debating whether or not he should go to John’s tryouts. Of course he knew where they were being held and his faith in his covert abilities was unwavering but he wanted to wait. The first time he saw the boy in person, he didn’t want to hide, didn’t want to feel like there was something wrong with what he was doing.
“Yes, I’m afraid it was a hit and run,” Mycroft explained, “the driver left his car and the Yard still hasn’t located him I’m afraid.”
It only took a perfect swirl of John’s cold tongue around the head of Sherlock’s cock and the blunt nails scratching down his side for the vampire to come with a shout. He pulsed four times into his sire’s mouth, the last being sucked out of him greedily. With a whimper from Sherlock and a loud wet pop from John’s mouth, the young vampire’s cock fell limp and glistening between his legs.
Sherlock lie panting and sweaty, while John licked him clean and pulled up his pajamas to his hips. “I bet it melted in thirty seconds,” Sherlock giggled probably due to his orgasmic high. John chuckled, shifting up behind him, draping an arm over his chest and pulling him in tightly.
When they pulled up to Baker Street, Sherlock threw the money at the cabbie and raced up the stairs into their flat. He swore the place smelled different, sweeter, better, now that everything had clicked into place. His coat was on the floor in an instant, his shirt, trousers, and pants made a breadcrumb trail leading from the front door to their bed, where he now loomed over the still sleeping form. “My sleeping beauty,” Sherlock smiled and kissed the boy softly on the lips, just like the fairytales.
“I-I’ll do it.”
“You be good, Molls. I’ll be right outside if you need anything,” Greg said, smiling at John, and then following Mycroft outside the room.
“Four.”
A strange wave of guilt washed over him then. Mycroft had risked his own life to save him, and now John was trying to expose the man’s love life to ruin his career.
“Is Sherlock alright?” John asked, lifting his head up. If Mycroft wasn’t mistaken, he though he heard true worry in John’s voice.
“Check the knife for prints, which belong to the victim’s husband’s mistress. Call me when you have a real case Lestrade, not these ridiculous Cluedo board games. I have more important things to do.” Sherlock added, as he walked out of the building and pulled out his phone.
It was like something out of a movie, John thought when he saw someone had already set the table for them. There was only one plate of food though, and he knew what was coming next.
John cursed himself for envying Jim, who had seeming lost his will to live…no, not his will to live, his will to fight. Jim would have a comfortable happy life, while John was always on edge, waiting for the chance to run away. He was very good at running away after all.
John let out a sigh, but couldn't hide the smile that came across his face.
“Sherlock’s sleeping,” John told Mycroft as he kneeled by the man. There was a bit of life coming back to the man’s eyes. The glass of juice was empty and the wounds Sherlock inflicted were completely healed, if not a bit bruised. Everything was okay, no one died and everything was fucking okay.
“Even your blood is hungry. It attacked my human blood cells when I added them to yours. Brilliant!”
“While I do believe you when you told Sherlock you would be a good boy and help us, it seems your natural teenage impulses will always get the better of you,” Mycroft said, but John didn’t sense any anger in the man’s voice, only sadness.
“I-I’m sorry,” John said through laughs, wiping the tears that were streaming down his face. He had no idea if they were happy tears or sad tears but nevertheless, they needed to fall and the laughing was helping. “I don’t know why I’m laughing,” he wheezed out the last word, quickly losing the ability to pull air into his lungs.
“But what if he doesn’t,” Mycroft asked again, his eyebrow rose dramatically.
He was suspended in the air by an intricately knotted rope around his torso, and another, softer one, tied around the base of his cock and up around the top and bottom of his buttocks. His hands were tied behind him and to the rope that was braided down his entire back.
He felt Sherlock lift his hips slightly, then pull down his sleep trousers just to the top of his thighs.
The last thing Greg saw was the butt of a crossbow slamming into his face. He knew that was definitely not going leave a sexy scar.
“Not as sorry as you are going to be,” Mycroft told him, motioning for Sherlock to have a seat on one of the chairs on the opposite side of the desk. “You need to learn your place John, and that does not include running away or taking innocent people hostage. You are our Sub, and it’s our job to discipline you.”
“He did,” was all that was offered.
John did as he was told, rubbing slowly along the skin of his leg and arm while Sherlock finished his hair, back and chest. Then he felt the tell-tale sign of their bath coming to an end when a soapy warm finger pressed into him from beneath. This part didn’t hurt anymore, in fact, it was quite soothing to feel the friction and mild burn, which foretold that Sherlock would be inside him within five minutes. “I’m so glad you’re okay, John,” Sherlock whispered in his ear and John jolted when a second finger entered, hitting his prostate, which he had come to realize was his favorite body part, besides is cock, when Sherlock taught him about biology.
Why yes, I am addicted to cliffhangers, how did you know?
“Who shot Moriarty, Sherlock? I need to know,” he pulled out his phone, ready to tell Lestrade the next step if John truly was the shooter.

“I’m calling Mycroft,” Greg said, pulling out his mobile.
“John,” the velvety voice stopped his rambling, “take your trousers and pants off.” Without thinking, the boy did as his
“Uhh, yeah, umm-“ John stuttered, shocked to see the man who took him away from Baker Street those many years ago standing right in front of him in the dairy aisle. A bottle rocket of panic shot through him until the man smiled gently. “Yes, I mean, hello, Detec-“
teenager in his arms. “You’re alright.”
“Don’t you dare, ‘brother mine,’” Sherlock said, anger and disdain lacing his tone, “you have the exact same feelings. I saw how you almost ripped Magnussen’s head off back there.”
‘Can you feel me touching your strong chest?’
Sherlock opened the door to reveal Greg and Molly standing in the entrance way. “What are you doing here?” Sherlock asked, the annoyance in his voice clear. John could tell his Dom liked Greg, but was bored by him as he was with most things, like air, as the older man had told him one time.
He found what he needed by slamming hard into John’s prostate and sliding his thumb over the moist head. John came with a shout, spilling and clenching in tandem, which forced Sherlock’s body to tighten. Two more thrusts had Sherlock was coming hard, shooting spurt after spurt of his seed into John’s willing hole.
Mycroft took another sip of his tea, obviously debating on whether to tell John something important or leave it for another day. Making up his mind, he took a deep breath. “John, the men and women we found in the facility were in a…” Mycroft paused, not sure how properly describe what he had found.
“Perhaps you will grow up as well, little brother, once you make it through your withdrawals so to speak. Which brings me to another point, if I catch you with any narcotics or those homemade drugs, I will add another five years and you won’t see John until he is twenty four, I mean it Sherlock; do not test me on this.”
John thought about balking, he even knew what he would say, but this wasn’t about him. No, this day was about those Subs in the kennels. “Yes, sir,” John said, hunching his shoulders over and leaning back as far as he could without cutting off circulation to his hands.
Falling to his knees before Sherlock, John put his hands on the other vampire’s knees and gazed up at Sherlock through his lashes. “Good boy,” John whispered before he licked a wet strip from Sherlock’s dawn up bollocks to the tip of his cock. Sherlock bucked against the twine, his hands straining to reach for his sire.
“What are you planning to do different this time, vampire?” Mycroft asked, using the word ‘vampire’ as an insult.
“Yes, the collar’s really changed my outlook on things, my Doms being one of them.”
“Get in,” Mycroft said, and suddenly, Sherlock felt like he was in an oven set on high. He squirmed against the hands that were pushing him, as his skin heated to a painful boil. Thankfully, he was shoved into a darker area and a cool breeze,
“Well then,” Sherlock raised his bottle, clinking it against John’s, “to new mates and new experiences.”
“Of course I was, John. I’ve never been as scared as I was when I saw you lying at the bottom of the stairs. You were unconscious by the time I reached you, so I carried you up here and took care of you. You’re left wrist and right ankle had hairline fractures so I wanted to get them wrapped up as quickly as possible. It should only take a few weeks to heal because I was able to tend to them so quickly.”
“I can GET proof.”
“Coffee!” Sherlock yelled in the direction of the waitress. “Three sugars, milk!” Then he leaned towards John over the table and hissed: “I marvel at your ability to turn everything into
Or fear.
“Where are we going?” he asked. Something Sherlock had been expecting.
“Ask what?” John was back in the kitchen (tea).
, plural.”
“Fair enough,” Sherlock said. “So this is where you were.”
“One,” Mycroft corrected him. “You've caught one, the other one surrendered. I'm quite astonished they allowed in someone so… gormless.”
“How do you know?” Sherlock asked. They'd come to a corner. They had two minutes until they had to turn back, according to his timer.
The girl came back and moved away, and was soon followed by a perfectly pleasant-looking woman (and John was about to object that this must not be Miss Price), but Sherlock recognised her manner immediately. She had that smile, the same he wore sometimes, the one that said ‘I'm normal and not a threat’. Only people who categorised the world with ‘hunters’ and ‘prey’ needed to make that distinction, when they wanted to show they were a threat and when they weren't. (Sherlock had a few more categories, most of them comprising of a single person, like ‘John’ and ‘Mrs Hudson’ and of course ‘me, myself and I.’)
John activated his ‘translating Sherlock’ mode by glancing at Sherlock and then looking at Lestrade. “I think he needs you to be the token voice of authority on the scene so he can terrorise everyone with permission. Not that he needs permission.” The last was added hurriedly and Sherlock nodded in approval. John had got the gist of it, particularly the last part.
The water tasted tepid. Had been there a while. Sherlock drank it all anyway, then pulled his knees up and realised he was under the covers, wearing his pyjamas. He wrapped his arms around his knees and clutched at his own elbows. He curled his toes into the mattress and relaxed them again.
“John,” Sherlock insisted and was rewarded with a low grunt. He located an ear and stroked it instead, which made John turn his head and squint at him with one half-open eye.
At this point John snorted and got up to close the window, collected the cold packs and their dishes off the floor and carried them into the kitchen, showing surprising initiative for someone who often left tea cups around the flat for weeks on end, which Sherlock permitted as a sort of a social experiment. They were normally returned to the sink by Mrs Hudson rather than Sherlock or John.
Sherlock hobbled in after the lady and John, instantly realising he was in the home of an avid smoker and that Captain Williams was a great big green parrot, sitting on the back of a chair. The parrot remained wisely silent. The lady lived very comfortably though all of the comfort was at least fifty years old. She appointed John an armchair and Sherlock a sofa on which he laid out, not gratefully, but not ungratefully either. His face throbbed and his ribs ached and his foot was on fire.
“Did you bring your gun?” Sherlock asked.
“Yeah, but there wasn't anything wrong with you except the drugs so they let me bring you home.”
He helped Sherlock up and onto the crutches, leaving him to hobble back to his bedroom. Sherlock crawled onto his bed and lay down with a sigh of relief. There'd be complete darkness, forgetfulness, painlessness. The boredom would be gone, the dreadful experience of being conscious. It would be glorious. He adored John.
“Hell, I bet you’re even enjoying this.”
Sherlock cried further and muffled whimpers could be heard.
It’s a bloody mess, but he finally looks the way he feels on the inside.
John furrows his brows.
Any last words?
It’s difficult to coordinate his steps, but he eventually stumbles his way to a bridge above the Thames.
13 texts and 5 missed calls from Lestrade.
Throughout John’s speech, Sherlock does not make a sound. He simply lays still and takes in every word that John throws his way.
“Shh, fuck, Jim shut the hell up!” John chastised, removing his hand when the other Sub nodded slightly. “Where did she go? Why didn’t you hang on to her like I told you to?!”
Unfazed, however, John went to the kitchen and opened the package, thankful that Sherlock had followed his advice and went to take a shower before bed. Pulling out a large aluminum packet, a large grin came across the Doctor’s face when he saw the one-inch white capsules covered in plastic. “Perfect,” he said, breaking off one perforated section and placing it in his pocket. Before going upstairs, John threw the box in the rubbish bin and placed the rest of the medicine in the freezer to keep it hard.
“I know,” Sherlock smiled and in one smooth motion flipped John over and pulled him up to support himself on all fours. The boy only shuffled for a moment, but to Sherlock’s pleasure, stayed exactly where he was supposed to. It was happening, just like it had done when John was fourteen, his mind was shifting. Sherlock smiled at this and immediately thrust two fingers into John’s hole.
“Do you really have to ask?”
“John, tomorrow, if you’re ready, the press want to speak with you about what happened that day. We need you to tell them that it was your collar that helped you ‘brave the flames.’” Greg told him, his hands on his knees as he looked intently at John.
The vampire groaned, but quickly stood up, angry and hungry. John might be his sire, but the student has to overthrow the teacher at some point. Sherlock saw John down on his knees, licking the hunter’s neck in an attempt to help the wound close before it’s too late.
He can’t die.
If Sherlock is repairable.
Which is utter shit, if anyone’s wondering.
A tool of self protection that was ingrained at a very young age.
It’s a saddening thought.
Always.
John Watson isn’t here anymore, he thinks. Finally got tired of having you around. Ruining his life in more ways than one. Idiot. He’s suffering and you’re here being an idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
They’re kind with a sprinkle of sadness.
“You fucking slut!.” Victor taunts.
And then nothing.
Fucking postmodernism at its best.
Victor placed his member over Sherlock’s entrance.
“Come on, Watson, deduce it.”
It seems so familiar.
“My name is Mr. Watson and I will be your biology teacher and your counsellor for the rest of the year.” John says with a smile.
Great.
Twirling the shaving blade in his hand, Sherlock looks down and lightly presses his thumb against the blade.
“No one except for John.” He corrects.
“Dr. Watson, I believe that my brother is quite worn out and would like to rest now.”
He isn’t.
He continues beating the man.
Sherlock had previously signed a waiver to have his corpse be used for science, but it could still happen after he’s found.
“Why don’t you just throw yourself back into his life? You’ve been doing it for ages. It wouldn’t kill you to do it once again. “
Sherlock looks up at Victor and smiles, but it doesn’t reach his eyes.
He really didn’t really know what to expect because he wasn’t planning on dying, but at the same time, he’d rather be dead than to be here in the bloody E.R.
He wastes no time in wrapping a tourniquet around his arm and administering the right amount of solution into his system.
John’s not the one that injects the 7% solution into Sherlock’s system, neither is he the one who applies the blade to his wrist.
Greg.
He lights one, taking a long drag out of it before responding slowly.
They always do.
Mycroft looks back, his usual smirk replaced with a look of empathy and sadness reflected in his eyes.
Mycroft.
She gave her life for him.
“What’s your problem, Vic?” Sherlock snaps.
It’s the opposite of comfort, despite what it’s supposed to convey.
Sherlock estimates that it’s been 3.7 hours since his last conversation with his brother.
Sherlock bites his lip, stifling any sounds that may pass. He shivers in anticipation and fear of being caught. His eyes are downcast, eyelashes fanning over.
Being forgotten.
Mycroft steps over and sits in the unoccupied chair.
And Sherlock isn’t too sure whether that’s a good or bad thing.
This goes on for a while until he loses all sense of himself and begins to speed up.
He hears the pipes crank.
“Let’s just get this over with.”
Fuck.
He purchases his favourite combination.
The door closes and it acts as the switch to Sherlock’s emotions. As if the click of the door is what opens the dams of his eyes and releases a steady stream of tears down his face.
Like a star.
He glances over to make sure that Mr. Watson does not hear them.
He never did, not until he met John Watson and learned more about being a nicer person.
Victor finally climaxes and he slowly pulls out of Sherlock’s hole for the final time. He cleans himself off and scowls down and Sherlock’s quivering form.
Doped up on drugs, Sherlock must’ve missed the sounds of a car passing and coming to stop abruptly.
A disgusting individual, really.
Someone believes in him and for now that’s all he really needs... for now.
He’s going to do it.
At this point, tears were falling freely from Sherlock’s eyes. He was speechless and felt as though he had lost all control over his life.
Mycroft.
It’s fine.
“You know I love you, right?” Victor said softly.
He’s never sure anymore.
Loneliness is the problem in and of itself.
He steps under the warm stream and rests his forehead onto the tiled wall.
So he hangs on to it.
He writes the truth because lies won’t matter when he’s dead. They deserve to know why this all happened.
Brother mine, Sherlock thinks.
It also isn’t about John’s sexuality because Sherlock has also worked out early on that John is bisexual.
The man has long disappeared and what’s left is a very broken mirror and remaining slivers that reflect Sherlock’s tear stained face and red eyes looking back at him.
“He wouldn't understand,” Sherlock responded. “Two sugars, no milk.”
“Ahh…” There was a brief hesitation and a few dry coughs from which Sherlock deduced the caller was on the elderly side. “I saw on the news this morning you were involved with the box full of human remains found in Harrow.”
“I hate generalisations. Are there any cases?”
“I'll go first,” he said softly, gun drawn. “You're still an invalid.”
The bedside table boasted a little reading light, Sherlock's newly acquired lighter, John's mobile charger, some change (60p), a three-quarters full water bottle and a little notepad and pencil. Sherlock sat on the bed and flipped through the notepad: the first page had a female name and a mobile number, the next one had an old to-do list (laundry, unclog drain, pay rent, write blog, ring shrink, all of which were crossed over except the one about rent), the following page was shopping list (laundry detergent, hand soap, shampoo and jam), and so on and so forth. Sherlock dropped the notepad and looked in the drawers.
“Why Lestrade?” Sherlock asked and kept turning on the chair.
“It's like he… woke up,” Lestrade sighed. Sherlock, standing in the room with his back to John and Lestrade who were by the door, could hear Lestrade's jacket shuffling as he rubbed his face. “First he was asleep, really calm at everything that was happening. Didn't seem to mind at all he was being brought in for multiple homicides.”
Sherlock ran his hands through his damp hair (it curled even more) and stomped into the sitting room, making sure to hit his heels on the floor hard enough to jar himself with every step. “John,” he said again.
“Both of the victims died due to madness,” Sherlock explained, hiding the uncomfortable soreness radiating up from his foot and sideways from his ribs and into his jaw from the swollen eye. He handed the cane to John and withdrew his roll of lock picks from his pocket. “Caused by the wall-paper.”
“You should come have a look,” John sighed at the other end of the line. He knew murders had the potential to become the best cases just as well as Sherlock did but still refused the happiness.
“Destroying my stashes because you're angry at me. I'd call that an insignificant waste of time.” Sherlock walked over and took his place in his chair across from John in an echo from earlier in the same day. It was late afternoon now—almost tea-time.
The boredom had had its effect on Sherlock. He'd had a nightmare about being in one of those tanks. Not because he had been or was afraid of the killer, but because he was terrified of the idea of having his senses culled, having the thread of his existence removed. The small space wasn't the problem, he could overcome something like that, he had trained his mind well.
“It's a pretty bad sprain,” John continued conversationally. He was surprisingly calm even though they'd just found out there were two more victims, these ones still alive. “You must be in pain.”
He wasn't sure if there was another crack of thunder or if it was the sound of the door slamming open. The corridor beyond was far brighter than the room and light spilled in like a non-Newtonian liquid, sluggish and LED-white. She turned in his body and the light touched her (his- HIS) face and etched his borrowed features in great relief between the light from the corridor and the dark of the storm in the room.
Sherlock swept out of the sitting room and into the bathroom where he gave himself a shower, leaning out of the spray of water now and then to sip at his tea which he'd brought along. It was hot now, so he would drink it now.
John had settled into his listening pose, eyes only half-open, but concentrated on Sherlock (as was right). “So what was this other case?”
After a few more messages that mostly consisted of things like “get up, John“ or “for God's sake, John“ and “I'm deleting all your lady videos, John,” John finally came down the stairs, wearing a reproachful expression and the imprint of his pillow on his cheek.
“He swallowed it whole,” he declared gleefully. “The neck isn't broken, there's no wounds anywhere.”
“Don't make that face,” John said. “And what you have is a dick personality.”
It was true John got kidnapped alarmingly often in criminal attempts to rouse Sherlock's interest and Sherlock briefly considered texting him. But the man was a soldier and a doctor (as he liked to remind Sherlock) and he wasn't going to get killed. Sherlock stared at the light on the electric kettle so he didn't have to look at Mycroft. A dead John was a thought he didn't dwell on. It made his senses want to shut down.
“Are you going to-” John began, with that tone of voice Sherlock hated.
Stairs. One minute overtime. Thirty-six minutes elapsed. Twenty-four minutes until the onset of hypothermia (no longer because of the water but because of wet clothes, John wore blends, synthetic, that was good).
She chuckled a little, closing her eyes for a bit. “Yes, it is. From my own plantation.” She put her cup down carefully on its saucer. “But let's forget the pleasantries, shall we, Sherlock? I feel as though I know you already. After all, I spoke to you at length this morning.”
Sherlock realised John had asked him the same question several times already but Sherlock hadn't responded. He needed to explain but to explain meant to make clear, to render intelligible and he couldn't—wasn't able to do that. And this wasn't one of the times when something was obvious to him but unreachable by John's intellect (such as nothing being intrinsically moral or immoral). This was beyond Sherlock as well and he resented that. He could rationalise but he couldn't explain.
“Gotcha,” John said softly and smiled. He wasn't smug like Sherlock had expected (or like Sherlock would've been). “When did you last sleep?”
“Would you like for me to heat it up for you?” John didn't quite smile, but there was a softness to his face that told Sherlock he was feeling generous and appreciated.
He knew he made it into the lift but he couldn't remember how and he had no idea of what happened then. In the inky black of his subconscious he ran down endless helices of stairs, the hem of his coat lapping at his legs and his breath pouring out of him as fog in the unnatural cold.
“Are you awake, then?” John asked.
a doctor,” John replied.
“I don't, but neither do you,” John muttered and he was right.
“Like bees?”
“It's pitch black, Sherlock,” John replied, voice tinny and a little louder (with the particular timbre and tone of his patience being tested). “The water's up to my chest.”
He made a frustrated noise and smacked the desk with his palm, then spun away and stalked out of the lab. He'd let the case slip through his fingers (not that it was taken from him), but there had been no way he could've known that it was of interest to the
“Yes, he told me several boring suicides had happened there over the years he'd worked in Scotland Yard, and one open-and-shut murder case where the murderer turned himself in on the spot.”
It had been four excruciatingly boring days. The stitches had come out, but the blasted soft cast was still haunting Sherlock. He lay prone on the sofa (yes, John, foot elevated), trying to contain the sheer volume of tedium he was feeling in the cardigan he'd borrowed from John. John had been working with Lestrade, helping with identifying the people from the tanks. Some had been long dead, some were still alive. They still had no idea where the special rooms had been built, but an investigation was ongoing, no doubt.
“So, genius, how are we getting in?” he broke the silence.
“That isn't up to me,” Sherlock said without opening the binder (despite burning curiosity to do so).
The fastest way for him to get back to Central London was by taxi (or helicopter, that wasn't still completely ruled out). Depending on route (shortest via A1) the trip was between thirty and twenty-five kilometres. He had considered walking, but even for him that would take hours. Even the car trip would take in excess of one hour. Public transport even more.
“You should leave the writing to me.” John was somewhat smug.
“What do you perceive?” he asked, not moving yet, just looking around, even though what he could see was very limited. The air was thick with particles their entry had stirred up.
“You're not a machine, you're human, I've seen you. It's okay to care even if your twat of a brother tells you otherwise. You're quite good at hiding it, really, but I've become quite good at spotting it. Sometimes you annoy the hell out of me, like the bag of dicks you are, but you're not a freak and you're not a machine.”
“Remind me,” John said. He picked up his laptop and opened it, which was a sign that the moment was truly over.
herbal, pharmaceutical, cosmological).
“Years and years of practise.” John just smiled.
John looked up, an array of slight confusion and expectancy on his face. The bags under his eyes were bigger than usual and he wore his clothes ill. He was tired and when John was tired nothing fit him. Coffee gave him heartburn and all his clothes seemed like they were meant for someone of a different size. To Sherlock it was a brilliant example of a person fully inhibiting his body and telegraphing status effects (such as emotional states) through it.
“Here's what we got,” he said, offering the papers when Sherlock sat in his chair and actively ignored the cast John had set out to put on again.
“Yes, quantum physics! And yes, for forty years! How did you know?” The man beamed up at him. He was about the same height as John, but made crooked by age.
“What!” he demanded as he answered it. He'd been able to tell from the way his phone groaned under the weight of the ringtone that it was his brother without looking at the screen. “Where's the spycam now?”
“Well, only technically. We're actually only trespassing so far,” Sherlock said with a little smirk, shrugging a little.
“Of course they don't. I do,” Sherlock said loftily, slipping the lighter he'd just lifted off John into his pocket.
John glanced at the door to the attic flat, but even he realised it was too obvious. “All right.” He waited a moment for further instruction but there was none, Sherlock had lapsed back into his mind.
“It's really rather simple. The first step, of course, is to procure a test subject,” Gibson explained. “The subject is then cleaned and sedated and placed in the vacuum chamber.” He gestured towards the glass cylinder in the other room. “After full vacuum has been achieved and the temperature has been lowered to a sufficient degree, I begin the vibration stage. The plate in the chamber on which the subject lies vibrates in an attempt to reach superposition. That is, for the test subject to exist equally in all positions. Or to be nought and one at the same time, if you prefer to simplify it to binary states. You are familiar with Schrödinger's thought experiment on the subject, yes? The cat?”
“Fascinating,” Sherlock replied with enthusiasm. “The breadth of subjects covered-”
What Sherlock saw on the tape was indeed quite out of the ordinary. He loved it. When Arthur Gibson was brought in he was mild and unanxious, looking around with that same gaze Sherlock had noted at his laboratory. No remorse, no responsibility. He answered questions, but in an oblique, disinterested way. And then, after asking for water, he suddenly flinched. When he looked up again his expression was very different: he had become alarmed and confused. His whole body shifted in character in a way that had made Sherlock consider a mental illness at first, but the man was entirely lucid. Just suddenly frightened.
the difference between right and wrong are selected by a group and thus vary across several groups. That means there are no moral absolutes and that moral absolutism as a stance is irrational and irrelevant. At best the morality of an act is dependent on the consequences of said act.”
“Ah-” Gibson slumped a bit with some of his self-confidence going out of him.
John just gave him a look. Sherlock was aware that John was somewhat proud of his inability to lie, or the small amount of lies he told, or something to that effect. Sherlock had never bothered to learn what exactly John thought was special in being only able to tell the truth. It was just one more ridiculous thing about him that Sherlock had learned to live with.
“Sherlock,” John said after a while of this. “Have you finally lost your mind?”
It... made sense. So of course Sherlock just wrinkled his nose, huffed, and turned to keep walking. John let go of his arm and followed, but radiated a field of 'deal with it' and Sherlock knew even without turning back to look that John's face would be saying the same (why was his stupid face always saying things).
Sherlock's open mouth snapped shut because no words were forthcoming. Had John finally had the last word?
“Don't be a pedant, John. Answer me.”
John nodded and walked him to the door, then came back, a little unhappy. “Why did you have to do that? Again.”
“S-sixteen degrees Celsius,” John replied slowly, shaking, having checked Sherlock's phone for it.
Sherlock refrained from making a reply of any sort in case he changed his mind about it later. This way he didn't need to justify anything. John hunkered down into his pillows and blankets with his back to Sherlock, which he counted as a victory because John hadn't kicked him off the bed and out of his room. He could get so territorial.
John's reply was inarticulate and thus beneath Sherlock's notice. He had made his way into the kitchen and sat by the table. “I've a theory. I need to prove it.”
“Yeah, let's not forget to define what's a book and what's a manuscript while there's a dead man right there!” Lestrade protested. Sherlock didn't take his eyes off said dead man. He knew Lestrade's crossness was caused by the dead man being in his place of work. Supposedly the safest place he knew.
“Really? That's interesting,” John said into the phone, looking at his cuticles while he spoke. He must have known how that irritated Sherlock. Not the cuticles, but the fact he didn't know what Mycroft was saying. WHAT was interesting?! Was it really interesting or was it small talk interesting? Was John doing it on purpose. No, of course not, he didn't have the capacity to dual-process like that.
The bath was nice, soothing, and it felt good to get clean. Sherlock sat in as long as he could without setting off John's alarms. It was nearly ten in the morning when he limped into the sitting room for a liquid breakfast and a consultation with a put-out Lestrade who sat there on the sofa with a sheaf of papers in hand.
Sherlock had expected this, as well. “Because if a man is always hungry and can eat anything he likes, where else would he go?”
“He went to get the coffee,” Molly said. “He said you wouldn't mind if I did this instead. Since it's my autopsy.” The last was added in a defensive mumble, but at least it was added. There had been a time when she wouldn't have dared, or not wanted to go against Sherlock's wishes. He only shrugged. What did he care who got the coffee and who opened the stomach.
The key slipped into the padlock, turned, and released the latch. Sherlock was so excited he was practically shaking as he took off the lock and shoved it and the key at John. He caught a glimpse of John's face as he did that and he, too, was grinning. Of course he would be. Despite all of his protests to the contrary, he loved the excitement as much as Sherlock did.
There was no reply from which he knew John was quite mad at him for leaving him behind. Or forgetting him. Or both. These two things weren't mutually exclusive as Sherlock had left John behind a number of times completely intentionally.
“You mean,” John said in his ‘translating Sherlock to normal people’ voice, following him into the kitchen. “You mean you know what happened and you want to show off to people.” He turned on the light and squinted at Sherlock, still cross (he should learn to process emotions faster), but also curious because he, too, loved the job.
“Lestrade!” he barked as soon as the man answered his phone. “The house, who owned it before the city bought it? And for how long was it empty? What? No, of course I'm at home. House arrest, I know what it means. That wasn't a car passing by, John's watching Top Gear. At this hour? I don't know why, I don't care to ask. Stop trying to change the subject! Get me the info!” There was no satisfaction of slamming the phone down, only the touching of the red ‘end call’ button.
The cigarette smoke had flowed down Sherlock's lungs and lingered around his face as he lay on his back on the sofa, staring at the ceiling with one half-lidded eye and another almost swollen shut. For that brief moment nothing really hurt and the world had retreated to a distance, leaving him in a hazy, nicotine-filled dream. He suddenly desired an iced sweet bun.
“Yes, absolutely,” Sherlock said, understanding the irony of using that word in this context. “No deed is
Good thing Sherlock didn't need his cooperation or interest in this particular area to continue trying to solve it. “Isn't that misleading?” Sherlock had a vague grasp on poetics. Vague to the point of non-existent.
to the girl').
“Didn't you hear me? I want your gun.”
Sherlock didn't feel like disclosing the matter yet. He kicked away the sheets and got up from bed. He walked into the bathroom and locked the door behind himself and started the shower, but instead of getting into the water he looked at himself in the mirror above the sink. Even though the light in the bathroom was dim it was well brighter than 25W and Sherlock didn't expect to experience the strange-face-in-the-mirror illusion (Caputo 2010) the way he did. For the briefest of moments his face shifted and Alice Waite stared back at him. He closed his eyes, squeezing them shut tightly and gripped the sides of the sink.
Sherlock didn't reply, setting the timer on his phone to count down from an hour, then tried to send a text to Lestrade, but it refused to go through. Then he tried ringing him, but there was no signal.
“Oh, just, I don't know, so someone would know where we died,” John muttered, still reaching after Sherlock to touch him, holding onto the decorative belt at the back of his coat.
He was well cross by the time John got back in the afternoon (1:35 post meridian). He had lain on the sofa, sat in the armchair, fiddled with his violin, taken the twenty quid John had left in the teeth of the skull, lain on the sofa again, eaten some jam, looked at some mould that grows on human skin if the body is submerged long enough, then at some fungus that grows on human skin if it's left somewhere dry.
in response to that.
Sherlock went to make tea just to avoid standing in the same room with Mycroft. The largest living organism on Earth was a fungus (
She laughed, but that too was as though she'd learned it from a teacher rather than a natural reaction. “Please do,” she said. “Herbert, wait outside,” she added and the driver did so, closing the door quietly behind himself which left Sherlock alone in the room with the woman.
“Why didn't you ring me?”
“Barely, John! Don't go to sleep, I'm still bored.”
She looked at him for a brief moment in askance, then realised Sherlock wasn't going to elaborate. “I described it's rough measurements and where it was found. About five centimetres in length, found in the anterior metacarpus of the severed hand, which in turn was located in the gullet of the deceased.”
“You know the victim?” Lestrade sidled in. He could sometimes be unobtrusive.
There was another turn, only to the right this time and he looked down another corridor, with things in such unstable mountains on either side of the scant free space that they created an archway.
“We need fire and you don't let me carry a lighter any more,” Sherlock countered, grabbing a metal container, piling the papers and other flammables in it.
John was waiting for him when he clattered back and no words were exchanged as they got their coats and John put on that damned cap with a slight eyebrow raise at Sherlock, who narrowed his eyes but said nothing. It was John's prerogative to make himself look ridiculous if he so wished, but Sherlock wouldn't be caught dead in that damned ear-hat, the legacy of which still plagued him.
Sherlock hadn't expected her to give a straightforward answer but this non-answer was just as good. She didn't deny anything and now it fell to Sherlock to figure out what had actually happened. He preferred it that way. “What do you want?”
In the middle of the room was a cylindrical metal object. Two metres in length, one and a half in height. There were valves on it, and an obvious seam where the top part could be opened in two different sections. It was fastened shut with rivets. A sensory deprivation tank.
“There,” Sherlock said, chin high, giving the crime scene technicians a look, “is the real lair of the killer.” He bent and pulled the hatch open, peering into the pitch black behind it. The air filtering out of it smelled still.
“The piece he possessed was approximately fifteen centimetres wide and twenty-five long with a long tapering end, obviously having been torn off a wall by hand.” He demonstrated the movement with his right hand, grasping the air and pulling down. “He had worked as a building renovator before being retired and one of the last places he'd worked at was an old house being turned into smaller flats. There was a big room at the top floor, just under the roof, with a hardwood floor that had been scored all over as if heavy furniture had been moved around a lot. The walls were bare except for this one scrap of wall-paper which was so odd that he went and tore it off immediately, and then kept it.”
“Do you need your robe?”
The shower and the tea combined in a pleasant effect of heat, relaxing muscles he hadn't realised were still tense from spending the night on the sofa. He dressed halfway, leaving his sleeves rolled up as he rejoined John in the sitting room and held out his arm on the arm of his chair after sitting down.
him. And, to an extent, disgusted him.
Sherlock's brain throbbed with the effort of moving his thoughts through the air into John's head. MOVE, he thought. Separate targets, John! She can't shoot in two directions at once.
John was a very great believer in Truth. But Truth didn't exist (truth is seen as truth because that is how human discourse is framed through power relations, and that is how it is lived and internalised, something called the “obviousness of obviousness“, which Sherlock rather liked), and trying to convince John of this type of existential fact when it came to his clearly strained relationship with his own sexuality was painstaking.
It’s all white.
No time for that.
He loves him and that’s the only thing that feels real to him at this point in his life.
“You seem like such a brilliant soul.” John slightly taps at Sherlock’s temple.
“After all, big brother is always watching.”
And they’ll all move on.
Hard and fast, it feels like bliss for Victor, but feels like pure agony for Sherlock.
Despite the pounding headache, Sherlock pushes himself up from the bed and he feels borderline hysterical.
“If anything, John needs to know...”
John smiled yet again and responds with
Sherlock does not mind.
It’s the fact that John is capable of loving men, but chooses not to love Sherlock.
“I just don’t want to feel anymore.”
The fall.
Fuck.
Sherlock says nothing.
He can’t even kill himself right.
He’s been doing it since the beginning of their failed friendship.
Heroin and Cocaine.
Although It’s a bit too tedious and not practical at all for the cleanup afterwards.
“And please, call me John.” He says.
At least in John’s eyes.
There’s a brief pause from the verbal abuse and Sherlock slightly opens his eyes and turns his head towards Victor.
He squints his eyes at the cowering form.
The retrieval would depend on the competency of the Scotland Yard, so he shouldn’t have to worry about that.
Sherlock feels the cold wall pressed right against his cheek and he closes his eyes as Victor pushes his body flush against Sherlock’s.
Damn her for being calming and logical but most of all damn her for being right.
The pain in his hip was unbelievable that night.
Hi Sherlock,
John was a curious combination of exhausted but exhilarated. There was a momentum in the room and feared it's dissipation if they broke for the day.
John softened at the misunderstanding.
"Let me take your coat." He said at the same time Sherlock said "John?"
"How are you feeling, sweetheart." He murmured against his lips.
"I wouldn't trust you to do it. I'll index them for you.
She nodded and scribbled down notes.
"No, of course, you weren't."
Hanah nodded.
"Not to
met. He wouldn't not credit his rather amazing growth when it came to emotion. But still, John had kept them to a minimum until it was as if they'd dried up.
"That is apparently how it works." Sherlock nodded. "Odd as it may be."
“It..It’s John." He said to him.
But that was for the future. At present Sherlock's voice was escaping his lips in stuttering little moans, his hand working just a little faster.
a ghost. But the language of his situation could be diced so finely, brought into such focus that it pained him to look at it straight on.
John did not begin with; Hi.
"Yes, um, thanks. Just taking it one day and time, you know" He answered trying not to be distracted.
"I know it would."
Just to the right of the midline, around 2 centimeters and below his nipple.
"Could Dr. Watson leave the room and usher in John, please? I'd much rather speak with him." He asked quietly but firmly.
"Ok."
Her office was littered with half filled boxes, the walls were noticeably bare and her computer was nowhere in sight. She was clearly near ready to leave herself but she had still greeted them both in the same easy, non-rushed manner.
"Can we have another go, John?" Sherlock asked and his voice was filled with such soft sincerity, so free of cheek or wit that John had to pause to swallow over the lump in his throat.
"Hallucinations?"
"Me too."
They had worked out a deal not long before the wedding. It was ridiculous to assume Sherlock could stay away from stimulation of the criminal sort for 3 entire weeks. So, the rule was, he couldn't seek anything out unless people desperately needed his expertise and didn't know it. He could only offer help if someone, mostly likely Lestrade sought him out. And then, his phone calls were limited to 5 minutes. And not a second more.
"Well, that's not ok, with me. It takes the anonymous out of AA."
"No, it's not. It just seems that way on the surface. I think sometimes rehab is presented as 'Get your life back.'. For some people, that's comforting and desirable. For others, it's a nightmare. Let me make something clear, John. If you want to live but were unhappy with the life you were living you don't have to take that one back."
"Have I ever implied that I was unsatisfied with something? With you? With us?"
"Who's Duck?" Sherlock asked.
Of course, he'd said he'd forgiven him. He loved the prick, even if he was, well...a prick. But, as they'd discussed in therapy, he'd still harbored bitterness from that day and many of the days before it.
“I do it all the time. I did it with you when we first met. I did it with James, this other bloke who’s in here. We had dinner together yesterday then went out and looked up at the stars.”
"Give me that man that is not passion's slave, and I will wear him in my heart's core. Ay, in my heart of heart. As I do thee."
He wasn't subtle though or especially gentle, but somehow his touch felt almost sinfully good.
Total renovation job.
Finally, no more bumbling or questioning or confusion because
"No, Sherlock, you don't have to chase me." He soothed him. "And I like hearing you talk about everything being new like this."
"What was your escape hatch?"
"Don't you heave in my car."
"Ok, I'll go back."
"Sir, step back." He commanded in a voice John knew he had to summon from deep within.
And kept walking.
"Quite."
Maybe...he just had to
"No, because meetings are for people who have a sincere desire to get clean and I don't think that's where I am right now."
She had thrown him off by bringing up the entire issue with triggers only to leave him hanging but he moved forward.
"So...are you alright?" John asked tentatively.
"No, it's ok. Hold her. She needs you right now. She needs you."
Their true goodbye was private. Behind the security of John's door, kisses and low voices and promises.
"So, " She began as she set cold bottles of water before them. "How are you today, Sherlock."
John paused for a beat.
up his nose before. He wasn't even sure where the impulse had come from. But it was worth it. The high was nearly immediate, not the slow, all over body sensation of swallowing the meds. This was fast and hard and explosive and he was just leveling off when Sherlock came home with Chinese food.
"It's not too much. Plus, we have plenty it's not like we'll run out."
"Tolerable. I think I just needed some uninterrupted sleep. I appreciate the use of your bed, John. Thank you."
"Me quoting me back to me. New depths." He said with a sniffle and she wrapped an arm around his shoulders and lay her head against his.
They both also decided that if it was to be Rosie's room, it should look like it. Gone were the neutral colors replaced by the brightness a child's space should have. It was actually Sherlock who suggested they make a run to a hardware store and they arrived back with paint, brushes, tarps and even a few stencils.
"I know," he said quietly. "I know it does."
With an undeniable spring in his step, he headed to the commissary and began filling a tray with all the things he knew Sherlock enjoyed.
He looked at a few of the random tweets.
"We will, love."
Breathe in. Breathe out. Give it time.
"I would if...if I knew. I don't understand myself."
"Does that have a name? What we just did." Sherlock asked as John rested heavily atop him, for the moment unable and unwilling to move.
"Some people drink so they can socialize easier. Some people drink for just a generalize dose of liquid courage. Some people drink out of habit. When you drank, what was your goal?"
"John, you'd best get going if you intend to meet me later at the stables."
“I didn’t have time to be afraid. That was a luxury. When I dawdled or waited...there was this one time-” But John stopped short. His mouth was starting to run away to a place his mind had no desire to go.
John hobbled to his bedroom, stripped down to his pants, crawled beneath the covers and waited for the sound of Sherlock's approaching footsteps.
Sherlock turned to look at him.
Mary and I had a row. She said, in that way of hers that she was surprised she prevailed.
He didn’t answer at first and instead calmly began to unbutton his shirt. Once done he laid it atop the closed toilet lid he then went to work on his trousers, unzipping them, removing them along with his pants and setting them too on top of the lid. The nightstand item he set on the edge of the sink.
"Ok, yeah, I won't. Absolutely not. Thank you, Molly. And Greg, you too, thank you both." He hurried to catch up with her as did Greg who slid an arm around her waist.
"For a private individual, it might not. But you're in the public eye and likely to remain there. Correct me if I'm wrong but, in a perfect world, you're prepared to settle down with Sherlock."
But no. When was the last time Sherlock didn't speak his mind?
"You're requesting a psych evaluation?"
"For how long?"
"Me?" John asked incredulously.
But there was only one way to find out.
"Want to join me today or wander a bit for yourself and cause trouble?"
"Fine. What is your question."
"I think...when we get back out there I just want to say it. I want to thank them for coming and say it."
So John sat there, on his knees, hoping it hadn't actually been as long as it had felt, with Sherlock straight and hard before him.
He scrubbed his face with his hands and groaned before continuing. When he removed them Rosie was looking at him with interest.
"I quite like you on top of me like this." He said cheekily.
John looked at her in disbelief.
"Please stop."
The tremor in his voice. The underlying current of panic.
"What, what timing? You could never lose me, not ever." John insisted but Sherlock wasn't listening.
No reaction. The doctor in him knew that was normal. The rest of him crumpled at the reality of it.
"Yes, that's right, that's Daddy!" Sherlock said giving her a big kiss. She laughed at the kiss and leaned back firmly against Sherlock.
"I think that made sense, don't you?"
“I mean...yeah, in a basic sort of way.”
Sherlock was coming at him with all manner of things and he didn't have the slightest idea how to defend against them.
"Heroin addict. Not so comfortable with that label either but the shite shoe fits. Why do they think you're depressed?"
It was like the wind suddenly got knocked out of him. Pacing no longer felt good, in fact, it felt as though his legs might give out. He slowly walked back to his chair and sat down.
"Mary was a genius." She said and it wasn't a question but a statement of fact.
90 days. Jesus. Three fucking months in this place. he was already starting to feel antsy and despondent."
"Yes, I did, John." She replied and she sounded just a touch sad.
"I did indeed. Best night I've had in a very long time. Best night since Family Weekend."
"I know." I said and raised my legs and put each ankle on a shoulder.
"I think I started to but...I chickened out."
Sherlock sat down gracefully at his side as though they were on a picnic. As though any of this were normal. As though they weren't sitting on the ground above an empty grave meant for him.
"Yeah, yeah this is John, who is this?" He said trying not to slur.
John was back in the forest, searing red hot but for once he felt he had a purpose. Instead of wandering aimlessly he was looking for something, for someone. It had to be Sherlock. He shouted out his name. It echoed all around him, bouncing off the thick dead trees which were thicker than normal. Not just their trunks but their numbers as well. There were so many he could barely move. But he tried and he kept trying and he kept calling out his name over and over and over again but he never got a reply.
say to you is please don't go. I swear to you I won't let you or Rosie down ever again."
, John." Sherlock said with exasperation. "I choose to ignore the dreary boredom of everyday life but I am not incapable of dipping a toe in when needed."
I don't feel sick all the time anymore. Well, I do, but it' a different kind of sick. It used to be this worried sick, desperation that would set in once my high wore off. I had this running count of how many pills I still had, in my head. Except once I really got into it my count got off. I didn't keep track. I couldn't keep track of how many I was taking so I always worried about the next time I went to the bottle it might be empty.
“Sherlock, I’m going to pull your trousers up and then carry you to my car.” John says softly.
“Can’t you see that I’m the only one who will ever love you?!” He continues.
Everything is white and bright, Sherlock notes.
He imagines John and smiles at the image.
His emotions scare him.
Just like how he used to be.
“Yes, brother mine?”
“John.” Sherlock starts.
Tapping beats onto his thigh, Sherlock reaches with his other hand into his gown pocket to retrieve a neatly folded letter.
“ANSWER ME!” Victor bellows into Sherlock’s ear.
“I’ll admit that this one’s quite believable, so I applaud you and Mycroft for including  cctv footage.”
John furrows his brow and pauses before he brushes a stray curl away from Sherlock’s face.
“Please leave, Mr. Watson.” Sherlock says groggily.
“Don’t think for one second that I didn’t see you eye-fucking Mr. Watson over there.” He continues, mouth curled into a frown.
Sherlock continues to study this man and the man studies him right back.
