"I'm sorry you said back pain?" John asks, trying to focus.
Chatsworth chuckled wearily when he heard. "No, we only get the one set of teeth. If we lose one, another one grows in its place, but tell him it's a completely painless process."
? He's clearly a baby whisperer."
, John mouthed, and let his jaw hang open. Finally, he shook his head and sighed. He shouldn't have been surprised to find there was magic in the world. After all, it was magic that had given him Sherlock, and if dragons existed that could turn into humans then
"Yeah," he says, and a grin breaks out on his face even though he's not quite sure what he's grinning about.
"I was thinking," John says, eyeballing the t-shirt and pajamas as though he's afraid they might jump out and bite him. "It might be easier if you were to wear a button down shirt. It would make it easier to get in and out of your shirt and give you some independence. You'd have to leave the cuffs unbuttoned because of your wrist, but you could roll up the sleeves. It won't be very fashionable wearing a button down with pajama bottoms, but, um, I'm sure you don't want me having to dress and undress you all the time."
"How did you manage that?" Sherlock asks, eyes narrowed at John in surprise.
. Empty threats aren't going to get you anywhere," Sherlock says disdainfully.
"Danilo raped me again two weeks after Zivko and that's when he—he caused the anal fissure. A week later I found out Zivko had committed suicide. Four days after that, Mycroft was able to pull me out of Serbia. Zivko was only sixteen, John."
to me?" he asked.
John's mouth fell open and he scowled. "What on earth was that bossy bastard thinking?"
Inside the door, John takes in Gerald's flat. It's done up in warm but light colors. There's a staircase directly ahead of the front door. The risers and walls are the color of sand and the steps and trim a muted terracotta.
fucking problem. The scope of this problem is world-ending.
"I can feel it, but it's mostly just pressure," Gerald says.
**see attached sheet for list of restraints
The two of them are kissing and rutting against each other for a good ten minutes before Blaine pulls away. They’re both panting.
John stood and walked over to the couch and sat down next to Sherlock. Sherlock shrank away.
"And I believe
In slow motion, Sherlock mimicked John, opening his mouth wide, and rubbing at his gums with his paw. "Theth no teeth the'! How can my theeth huth when I ha' no theeth?" he asked, looking wounded, as though John had lied to him.
Sherlock announced, "I'm so glad you agree, John, because now we can have sex!"
with you. In other words, can he overhear our conversation?"
"Stand what?"
John inspects the grip of his weapon for blood and other gore. He wipes the offending gore off on the suspect's coat, then checks the man's pulse as well as the state of his eyes, making sure he's not got a sliver of cheekbone shoved up into one of them.
John's jaw clenches as he feels hurt trying to spill out of him and he tries to stop it, but it's already out. "I loved you, and you broke me when you left, and I glued myself back together, and then you came back, and broke me all over again, and now I don't work right without you,” John says softly, quickly, feeling feverish with exhaustion and too many goddamned feelings for one man to handle in the space of a few hours. "No, that's not—not true."
telling them you're attempting to get your sister into rehab and need a week to get her admitted and settled."
"Pfft. Stubborn arseholes are part of the reason why I became a Dom slash therapist instead of sitting in a tastefully decorated room listening to someone complain about their life when they just keep making the same mistakes over and over again," Gerald says. Then, apropos of nothing blurts out, "Will I see you again?"
"Sorry," Chatsworth said, indeed looking contrite. "Put your things away and let's get started."
to reach out, to expand his circle of—of—to have more people in his life than John and Mycroft.
He walks down the street. He forgets how to get home. He can't organize his thoughts. This is what it was like when he was shot. If someone had asked John how bad the pain was when he got shot, he would have described it as exquisite. It's the kind of pain that forces your brain to dump endorphins in your body. It leaves you feeling numb and stupid. It's not unbearable because you bear it or you go into shock. Or you die.
"I bet you were every woman's wet dream," Gerald says and strokes his hand up and down John's stomach. "Now you're every man's wet dream."
following the orders and getting punished."
"On your back?"
"Rare?" John asked. "That makes me feel like the ordinary bloke in a movie who's actually The One, destined to save humanity with some power he didn't even know he had."
"Uh, nothing. Never mind. Perfectly well," Sherlock babbles. (Underneath his fear of setting John off is relief so strong he must fight to keep a grin off his face—Gerald is no longer The Boyfriend and Sherlock is that much closer to having John for himself in every way.)

him—probably still loves him. The only reason Sherlock isn't drowning in insecurity is because Gerald is with one of John's other friends now—Sherlock's forgotten the name—who's supposedly the love of Gerald's life.
"When I arrived at the embassy infirmary, I had an anal abscess as a result of an anal fissure received during my imprisonment. It was drained and stitched with dissolvable sutures. I saw no point in embarrassing both of us by having you check between my arse cheeks to see that it was healing properly when I myself am perfectly capable of caring for it. That is all."
"Sherlock, please!" John hisses. "Do you know how hard it is to want you and to know what's happened to you and to feel like a dirty creeping pervert for still wanting you anyway?"
It takes Blaine a mere twenty-seven minutes to chat him up. After another eighty excruciating minutes of tedious conversation, Blaine asks Sherlock to leave with him. As soon as they’re out of the bar, Blaine drags him around the corner and kisses him. Blaine’s lips are bruising in their intensity. Sherlock knows it’s been almost two months since Blaine’s last lover and his lips attack Sherlock’s with a desperate hunger.

Sherlock had hung onto his chicken bone in his mad flight to John. He poked his head out over John's arms and dropped the chicken bone onto the floor. John made a sound of distress, and opened his mouth to chastise Sherlock, but Sherlock started talking.
Chatsworth cleared his throat, catching John's attention. "I'm sorry, Dr. Watson, but just so you know, it's not good form to say that dragons
Eventually, the novelty of Sherlock's presence takes a back stage to Milton. John gets another go to cuddle him, but this time Milton is awake. His dark wet eyes stare up at John in a way that makes John feel a certain rightness with the world. And then Milton bursts out into a potent wail.

"What's a switch?"
"If this is about last night, I apologize for my outburst. There, now you can leave," Sherlock says without looking at John.
Gerald gently guides John's legs back onto the bed and then lies down, pressing up against John and keeping their legs knitted together so that contact isn't broken but John is no longer physically vulnerable. John can feel Gerald's lost erection against his thigh and stifles the frustration he feels at having derailed their plans.
, that Sherlock just cannot hold back anymore. He pushes John onto his back roughly, and climbs on top of him. "
“I hardly think there’s a need for pleasantries at this point,” Sherlock says, stopping right in front of him.
"Okay," John says, nodding his head, trying not to let his face reflect what he's thinking which is
"And Sherlock?"
"You can't give a dragon hatchling
"Sherlock," John says softly, shaking his head slightly as he sits on the bed next to him. He takes the box of condoms out of Sherlock's unresisting hands, and takes both of his hands so all four are wrapped up together. "I've never stopped wanting you, no more than I stopped loving you. In fact, I've had to remind myself many times of your injuries so that I could maintain the proper distance, not just as your doctor, but because you're always so deceptively self-assured. And then, also, like I said—breaking up with Gerald was hard, but it's not stopped me wanting you."
"Sorry," Sherlock whispers again.
“I was just being polite, Colin,” Blaine says, tilting his head back. He’s looking down his nose at Sherlock but somehow makes it seem coquettish.
"Yeah! Sort of like mine, but I ain't lost no weight, you know. Would be nice to. Unless it were lung cancer or—"
Chatsworth hummed in thought and then shrugged. "I would say no for any other youngster, but this is Sherlock we're talking about. Don't worry, John. I'll go up too, and keep an eye on him."
Sherlock reaches over, and unlocks the door. It opens slowly to reveal a very displeased Mycroft. He stands in the doorway, his eyes slowly moving back and forth between them, and then down their bodies, and then back up to their faces. He lifts a lofty eyebrow, and says, slowly, "If the two of you are quite done
"You said last night that all this time, you thought I didn't want you because you were a man when it turns out I just didn't want
He reaches for the top button on Blaine’s shirt. This is the first time he’s been shorter than someone he’s had sex with and it’s disconcerting. Height makes a difference in power differential, something he’s never considered, a shocking oversight on his part. Is height the reason why John has always been so faithful in following him? Does he see Sherlock as having more authority than him? No, that’s ridiculous. John is full of his own quiet authority. On cases, Sherlock has authority because that’s his expertise. Hell, Lestrade is almost the same height as Sherlock and he’s an idiot. A very competent idiot, but an idiot nonetheless.
John threw his head back and laughed.

is John, unattached. John can just imagine what was going through Sherlock's head.
He stared at the worktop. Then he wrote,
Sherlock leads Blaine to his own bedroom with nothing but two fingers. Blaine could brush past him to get there first, but he doesn’t. He falter-steps along in Sherlock’s wake, utterly agog. Inside the bedroom, Sherlock turns to Blaine, lines his body up against Blaine’s and then puts slow pressure on him, forcing him to walk backwards or get stepped on. Blaine doesn’t look back to see where he’s going and ends up tumbling onto his own bed with a surprised face. This time Sherlock does laugh.
"And you know that for a fact, do you?" she asks in her irritatingly know-it-all voice that reminds him of Harry when they were kids, back when they fought over couch space, and who got to sit in the front seat, and who got to shower first (and whoever went first got screamed at for using all the hot water), as opposed to now when they don't fight at all because at some point between Harry's drinking problem and John off at war in Afghanistan, they turned into strangers who were too busy falling apart to bother fighting with each other.

"I missed you so much," John whispers brokenly and then gathers himself and smiles. "Let's get you some tea before you have to submit to me poking around your body and griping about the inferior quality of doctors found in Belgrade."
Last, but of course not least, thank you to every one of you who read and commented, who followed me from the original series format to this version. Every comment is treasured like nobody's business, but they're especially meaningful when they come from readers who follow along with an unfinished work. It takes balls, kiddos, and I thank you for your. Um. Balls?
When John stood, his hand slipped off the egg and he only then realized he'd been touching the egg almost continuously for the—he glanced at his watch—two hours they'd been talking. So much for not touching the egg.

"Why don't you want me, John?" Sherlock asked in a small voice.
them," Sherlock says, irritated that John's missing the whole point when it was John who's worried about triggering a flashback or panic attack, but then his spine stiffens, and he purrs, "Unless you want me to."
even though all he wants to do is sink down onto the bed with Sherlock and sleep for about a hundred and fifty fucking years, because after the transition window, Sherlock becomes semi-catatonic, as though everything is reaching him through several layers of reality and really fucking bad wi-fi, and once he catalogues the correct response/reaction, he has to send it back, and John can become a
"Well, that's just my bad luck, then," Gerald says with a laugh.
"I am, I'm just – I've never gone home with someone I've only just met," John says, which isn't the truth. He's gone home with at least a dozen women in his life, some of whom were one night stands and some who he ended up having an actual relationship with. They were all women, though.
Mycroft leaned forward eagerly, catching John's attention. "What is it? What did he say?"
to do it."
Thank you for loving Gerald, too! In the chapters I cut, we got to see more of the gang than just the peek here at the end, and they were fun to dream up. Poor babies, their scenes kept getting cut so y'all don't know them like I do, but maybe one of these days you will. I'm not making any more promises, though!! I'm not even sure I'll keep writing fanfic. This was the story I wanted to tell all along and there's a peace that I feel in bringing it to a close that I'm loathe to disturb.
"Yet," John said.
When he can move again without vomiting, she puts him in the front seat this time, buckles him in.
"You're wrong," John says, then erupts in laughter until Sherlock pinches his hip.
"No buts!" John said and stormed through the door.

apologize to me for taking care of you. Yeah? Can you do that for me?"
"Yeah," John says and turns back to face the bar, not sure he wants to get drawn into a conversation with a stranger. He looks Gerald over in his peripheral vision.
The whole thing blows his mind. Nine months ago, he was trying to chat up a woman in a pub. Now he's got Gerald's cock up his arse and it feels more intimate than any sexual encounter in his life. Maybe it's the amount of preparation involved. He can't just push Gerald down and climb on top. No natural lubrication or stretch like with a vagina. You can't blame it on the heat of the moment or the amount of alcohol you drank beforehand. Every action is intentional. You have to make a conscious decision to stretch and slick up your receptive partner's hole.
Still, the one thing they've both agreed on is that John wants to experience bottoming and Gerald, who's always bottomed, would like to try topping.
Sherlock chuckles and then holds a big grin on his face. He bends his head and kisses Mrs. Hudson's cheek. "You are wonderful, Mrs. Hudson, and I'm so glad you and John had each other while I was away."
"Rest up," he says.
But Rebecca works with John, and even though their schedules only overlap on Thursdays, he knows that eventually she'll manage to corner him. One day, two weeks after John and Gerald break up, she succeeds in dragging him into an empty loo off the doctor's lounge before he can get away. She locks the door, and demands he tell her what the hell is going on between him and Gerald. John caves and tells her they broke up because he cheated. He expects Rebecca to be angry, but she's shocked instead.
." His breath hitches, and he tries to swallow, but can't. Panic almost sets in, as he wills his throat to do its job. Finally, it does, and he drags in a shuddering breath. He points an accusing finger at John, who flinches slightly even though Sherlock is across the room. "And I've spent twenty-four hours thinking that—" Sherlock hauls in a painful lungful of air, "—thinking that you didn't love me after all, and trying to find a reason to go on anyway.
The way he speaks is gentle, but firm and yet he may as well have been stroking John's dick, which is rock hard and starting to leak.
"Okay, back up, because I'm confused," Dr. Reed says in his no-nonsense voice that grates on Sherlock's nerves even as he's grateful for it. "Are you saying that's all you have to

"I'm asking because there are nursing services that can help with the burden of aftercare for his wounds."
John carried a drooling but affectionate Sherlock into the flat and through the kitchen to the bedroom where he lowered him onto the bed. John sat down beside him.
"What's the mirror for?"
"Sherlock, it's so you have easy access when you need to pee," John said, trying to keep his eyes on Sherlock's face. "The rest of the time, you should keep your penis tucked away."
"Remember I told you that Olivia and Bernie were having a baby?"
. Still.
for a row. Now that Sherlock has gained weight, and his bruises have faded, John's concern has diminished considerably, making room for his anger and resentment.
"Because I wanted to—" Sherlock tilted his head, looking thoughtful. His black forked tongue flicked out momentarily. "I can't quite see the word in your head. Coodling?"
Sherlock's brother was not who John would have chosen to speak to about this situation, but he needed to talk to

They both face forward at the same time, their hands still clasped. Cayden gives them a little push and with John by his side, Sherlock steps back into the land of the living.

Sherlock wakes to an empty bed. The digital clock on the bedside table says it's forty-five minutes after six in the morning. Sherlock strains his ears to listen, but the flat is silent. Surely John hasn't already left for work?

John checks his watch and starts to move towards the door, and Sherlock wants to beg him to stay, but he represses the urge. After John puts on his shoes and jacket, grabs his bag and slings it over his shoulder, he turns to Sherlock. He looks right into Sherlock's eyes and says, "If you need me, and you can't reach me, call Mrs. Hudson. Will you do that for me?"
he thought, and sat up in bed, remembering the luggage he'd spotted in the sitting room. "Gone where?"
Sherlock asked incredulously.
The warm spray is fantastic and John makes sure to pay special attention to his crotch and rear. He exits the bathroom on a puff of hot air, scrubbing the towel over his body. His erection has flagged in the fifteen minutes he's spent in the bathroom. He's not flaccid, but his body has retreated to the first stage of arousal. Gerald wraps his hand around John's penis and gives it a few strokes while licking water off of John's neck and John's erection hardens so quickly he's dizzy at the drop in his blood pressure. He sways to a seat on the bed while Gerald raises his eyebrows in smug delight.
(Another gem of Dr. Reed's—
"This someone being
"What—now?" John says, voice smoky and dark, like a man who's just smoked a cigarette and debauched someone.
"I understand," Sherlock rushes to say. And he does understand, but he doesn't have to like it.
John gets that feeling in his gut that he often gets when he's around a Holmes brother. It's a feeling that says
"I hope it's someone you like," Gerald says. His smile is inviting and open. His lower front teeth are slightly crooked, but they don't make his smile any less beautiful.
With a kiss on the cheek, Gerald is gone, climbing into the cab and shutting the door. John closes the front door and locks it. Then he works his way slowly, reluctantly, up the stairs to the flat. He pauses on the landing outside the sitting room but then, because he just can't, he

Sherlock tugs again, and John follows, moving closer, then closer still until they're breathing each other's air, and Sherlock pats his arm.
Sherlock is standing in the FBI satellite office with two men. One is his handler, Emery Tate. The other is the Special Agent in Charge, Lester Bradley. They are both very good at what they do and Sherlock knows better than to underestimate them. Five minutes into the meeting, though, Sherlock is gnawing on his thumbnail and ready to throw something. He and Bradley are engaged in verbal warfare and Sherlock knows he should resist, but he’s wired from spending fourteen hours on a plane with the contingent of MI6 agents Mycroft sent to babysit him. The nastier Bradley gets, the more imperious and disdainful Sherlock gets, which pisses Bradley off and round and round they go.

"Do you want children?" she asks.
It was still dark outside when John woke up with a start. Immediately he knew Sherlock wasn't with him. He looked around the dark room as though Sherlock might just be crouched in a corner for no reason, then put on his robe and walked out into the sitting room attached to their suite. There he found Sherlock who was sitting on the floor with the laptop screen lighting his face, a box of tissues on one side and a pile of crumpled up tissues on the other.
"How many men have you had sex with?" John asks, and then immediately rushes to apologize for his rudeness.
John has spent his whole life fighting for every bit of respect and authority he's has—and that includes
"Just get it over with and they'll leave you alone," Sherlock says impatiently.

voice, "So, I can use this—the lube launcher?"
, but Sherlock has worked for what they have just as much as John.)
John murmurs a wordless agreement, but Sherlock seems to have lost him to his nosing exploration of Sherlock's bare chest. His hands draw open the front of Sherlock's dressing gown and he trails his lips and nose down Sherlock's chest and then to his stomach.
, Sherlock. I'm going to put soap on your snout. Keep your mouth closed or you'll get soap in it and it doesn't taste good."
Technically, John was shouting at Chatsworth and not at Sherlock, but in his mind he felt the painful withdrawal of Sherlock's own mind. John moved to lay a comforting hand on Sherlock's head (which now reached chest high on John) and explain himself better, but Sherlock flinched out of the way and carefully maneuvered himself around John and out to the sitting room, where he curled himself up as small as he possibly could and continued to watch TV as though nothing had happened.

." The sound of Sherlock cursing so coarsely is sexy, and he lets go of one of John's cheeks to press a finger against his rim, and then he pushes it in, and John almost strokes himself, so desperately hard. If he didn't want Sherlock to fuck him so bad, he could get himself off just like this, with only one finger inside him. Sherlock's fingertip slips in and out, pressing on John's rim as it does, and John says, surprised by the way his voice cracks and breaks, "I can take two."
! Please stop talking! Just. Don't say another word."
"Who was it with?"
“John, I'm thirty-seven years old,”  Sherlock says with a roll of his eyes.
John doesn't see Gerald at first until Gerald leans around the back of the lounge chair he's lying in, a bottle of beer between his legs.
Sherlock turns his phone off, stuffs it into a drawer upstairs in the second bedroom, and then goes downstairs, curls up on John's side of the bed, and wants to weep at the sweet smell of John's body. He should've insisted he and John have sex in
"I'm sorry, what?" John asks, sitting up straighter.
as he does and comes with a furious spurt of semen that shoots so far that it lands on his chin. When they’re both done, Sherlock scoops a fingertip of semen from Blaine’s chin and puts it against Blaine’s lips.
In Serbia, the sadistic guard Danilo reduced Sherlock to meat and blood and bones and then tried to take that, too. But putting his cock in Sherlock's arse didn't give him the right to own any part of Sherlock and that includes his mind. Does he need time to heal? Yes. But Danilo did not break him, the guards did not break him, the freezing winter, the belt lashes, the lice, being used as a human toilet—

because he's listens to music through his earbuds so he doesn't have to listen to Sherlock yell when he's being beaten. Zivko's heart is too soft, the hulking brute tells him. How will he ever become a man if he has the heart of a woman? A true Serb, he says, would enjoy hearing an enemy of the state being tortured. The sounds of his pain would be music to the ears of a true Serb, not the Western shit Zivko listens to. A Serbian soldier will do anything for his nation.

"Yeah, I do," John says and it's the truth.
The house is large, with a courtyard and "breezeway" as Elspeth calls it. It's a screened in porch with a small bar with two stools, a sturdy patio table with two chairs, and a TV mounted on the wall. It makes an impression on Sherlock because it connects the garage to the rest of the house and is pretty much all of what he sees of the house for the first week.
degree, correct? Surely you can tell the difference between consensual and non-consensual sex."
Sherlock, feeling lighter, but still deeply touched, ducks his head and swallows back the emotion that threatens to overwhelm him. It was illogical to assume John felt otherwise, and yet Sherlock had, spending the last month feeling like a cold, distant moon orbiting a bright star, never getting closer, just spinning uselessly around.
"Is that where the man puts his penis in someone?"
John's eyes go wide and his mouth drops open slightly before he snaps it shut.
"Yeah, pretty sure," John says, his voice gone soft and quiet, thinking about Harry more than babies, and feeling that familiar stab of regret for not realizing she mattered until she was lost to him.
!" Gerald roars. "Is his hold over you really that strong? How
John looks up at Sherlock, his eyes dark and wet, his lips swollen, saliva trailing from his mouth to Sherlock's sheathed cock and back to John's chin in a skinny triangle of spit that catches the light, and Sherlock has a brief vision of John wearing nothing but Sherlock's Belstaff and red high heels, but his brain gets rid of that thought, too, as Sherlock's orgasm begins to gather in his groin. He recalls John's request that Sherlock come on his face, but in an uncharacteristic fit of shyness, decides not to remind him.
"Mycroft's paying the rent on both rooms," John says, as they look at the almost empty room. "But I can't for the life of me think what to do with it. Quite frankly, I can't be arsed to do anything with it any time soon."
John's no longer using his grip on Sherlock's biceps to push him away and is, instead, holding on for dear life and then Sherlock's thumb circles John's slit, then rubs underneath his glans against the frenulum and John comes. Momentarily color and light burst behind his eyelids, which are squeezed shut, and John thinks of Gerald coming to fetch the prescriptions, of making love to him earlier in this bed, Gerald sweet and pliant beneath him. Sherlock has—has
Just like that, the decision is made.

"There's nothing to talk about," Sherlock says, getting up off the bed. He goes to stand by the desk, looking out of the small window, his arms crossed, his body-language screaming
but comes out,
When Bernie comes over to take the baby from Sherlock, she asks John, "Can we keep him?"
Tape in hand, John sat down and wrote,
"Okay, look. I've got about a thousand questions. Right now, though, all I care about is—one, that you're home, and two, that you let me look at you."
"I' my mouth?" Sherlock gasped.
Sherlock is shaking—John watches dumbly, overwhelmed by the nerve-jangling, gut-punch switch from hot sex to nightmare.
"Yes. Yes, thank you. So, you in fact—"
"Yes, I don't need to be told more than once." Sherlock sighs deeply, and dutifully steps forward to his mark. He no longer feels like the man that London met through John's blog. That man was arrogant, and lacking in compassion. The opinion of the press was meaningless to him, but now he needs to get it
The problem was, he couldn't remember

"Before."
. Most of the time, John feels like he either has to do what Sherlock says or be cut out of the case. Those are the only two options. Sherlock's way or not at all.
Sherlock ignores John's words and takes up his assault on John's cock again, bringing him with skilled efficiency towards the edge of orgasm and John whispers Sherlock's name, and Sherlock just murmurs the same thing over and over in John's ear.
Eventually, it's done and Sherlock can finally go home.
and tries to smile but the tear in his lip pulls. He winces and brings his hand up to his lip.
John is sitting in his chair, and his chest is bare. At first, Sherlock thinks he's naked and an image of him and the boyfriend together pierces his chest, but then John stands, his mouth opening in shock, his tea mug clattering to the carpet, spilling but not breaking.
She smiles, but says nothing. Sherlock feels safe next to a lonely woman whose skin is mapped with freckles, the two of them hidden inside the camouflage world.
"So you would pay attention. Have you slept at all?"
John's eyes open wide, and his lips part in astonishment, and he says, "No. Way."
Then he does something Sherlock never expected, not even in his sweetest dreams. John takes Sherlock's hand, wraps it in both of his, and then brings it up to his lips and kisses the back of Sherlock's knuckles before gently letting go.
"Really?" John asks, surprised at Gerald's conviction.
John grieves after Sherlock jumps from the roof of St. Bart's.

like it," John says, understanding dawning.
"You're convinced nothing Sherlock feels is real, despite what Mycroft and I have told you, because to
"To be fair, it was more like a mutual wank," John says, trying to sound lighthearted but coming out sounding dismissive instead. "I mean, it's not exactly
"Hey," John says, jumping to his feet. "Do you need help getting in bed?"
Sherlock nodded. John knew Sherlock liked thinking John was important. He felt it added to his own prestige. John shamelessly exploited that.
Rebecca smirks. "They just never talked about it again and they were too blinded by how they felt to see that the other felt it, too."
Mycroft comes to see him a few days after the funeral. John makes tea but neither man speaks until John hands Mycroft his cup and saucer. (A cup and saucer for Mycroft but a plain mug for John.)
"Okay," Sherlock says because what he wants to say is,
"This is coming off," John says, his fingers tracing the tape around his ribs. "I'll give you dihydrocodeinone for the pain, but I'm not having you get pneumonia because you can't take a deep breath ‘cause of the goddamn wrappings."
It's obvious to Sherlock that they will have to find a way to move past this without actually talking about it. Talking about it would mean John admitting he feels threatened by Sherlock's kink and Sherlock would have to admit that it makes him angry John is still so hung up on being with a
and you know Mycroft said I was to be strictly prohibited from watching it. That must mean Chatsworth is here to do Mycroft's bidding."
"But you knew."
"Sherlock, let me go. You're going to choke me."
"Against the rest of the world," Sherlock says.
"We already do that," Sherlock said with an airy wave of his hand. John conceded that he wasn't wrong. "What's next?"
and to the nurse, urgently but quietly, he says, "I think she may be having pre-cardiomyopathy infarction."
Sherlock is holding a creamy white envelope in his hands, staring at the address before turning it around and proceeding to begin ripping into it.
Mostly, though, he never said anything because there's nothing more pathetic than unrequited love, especially when you live with the person who's failing to requite your love. He thought he would have time to figure it out. He thought
"I'm serious, Gerald," John says managing to sound irritated while laughing.
, Gerald. He's not quite the Sherlock Holmes I knew, but I think that's just because of what he's been through."
"I'm not trying to steal his agency, Sean, I'm—"
For the rest of the day, John is kept busy treating children caught in a fire at their school. He doesn't have time to think about Sherlock, or Gerald, or anything beyond treating each small victim.
"Oh, stop that," John said. Then he laid his hand on Sherlock's back. "C'mere. Come sit in my lap, just like you are now, with your tail wrapped around you so it's not holding me down. Then we can cuddle."
and John's gut twists and he thinks
"Fuck," he says, pulling it out and checking the message.
"What do we do now?"
"Oh, mate, I'm sorry, I didn't—"
"I've known for three years that John was attracted to me, but he always stridently denied being gay. Technically, he's bisexual, not gay, but anyway, he was dating another man and he told his—boyfriend about this—what had happened between John and myself and it resulted in the end of their relationship, and John blames me. He's also, rightfully so, angry at me for faking my death and then keeping him in the dark for eighteen months. Our friendship is in danger because of this—inappropriate attachment."
John looked at Sherlock's egg then back at Mycroft. Then back at the egg. "I'm sorry, Sherlock. I really should follow Mycroft's advice. He knows what he's talking about."
The way she says it makes him feel like they're still together, like when John first met Gerald's friends, and Rebecca teased them about never leaving the flat because all they did was fuck, and Gerald blushed, but looked thunderous. Cyril had come up then, and ruffled Gerald's hair, and he'd turned around, alarmed, and said,
John finally looks up at him, and Sherlock freezes. He takes in the red-rimmed eyes, the downturned mouth, the forward slope of the shoulders, the mussed hair, the pale cheeks, the furrowed brow.
"You don't have to pay me back for attending the party," Sherlock says, sullen and wounded.
. Semen fountains up out of Gerald's cock and John doesn't know if he wants to watch that more than Gerald's face so his eyes flit back and forth between the two. John takes his hands off Gerald's foreskin and just uses his hand up and down the shaft to work Gerald through the last waves of his climax.
Mycroft raised a skeptical brow and opened his mouth, but was beaten to the mark by Chatsworth.
Inside, John is handed a bottle of beer. He can see the truth in what Gerald said about Sherlock and Cyril's insecurity in the guarded way Cyril hovers over Gerald, as though he thinks John's going to snatch him away.
"Yes, but I was thinking about it
John sags against the wall and rubs his hand over his forehead in frustration. He's lonely and has nobody to talk to about what happened. (Obviously Sherlock isn't sympathetic about the breakup, and, of course, he has his own fears and sorrow to overcome)
. John's Captain Watson persona shouldn't be arousing to Sherlock—someone who never follows orders as a matter of principle, even if said order is to his benefit—but it is. Sherlock remembers Baskerville and John pulling rank on the young soldier.

Sherlock looks at the pills and then down at his body where he's clutching the blue silk tightly around his waist. His erection hasn't gone down yet and Sherlock hastily covers it with one hand and uses the other to keep his dressing gown around his waist. He looks helplessly at John.
"Why are you asking me?" Sherlock says with a glare. "This is the first actual relationship I've ever been in. Sex is completely separate."
Holmes rolled his eyes then growled, over his shoulder, "Out! Wait in the car," to his thugs. They melted back into the shadows outside the flat, and their footsteps were barely audible on the stairs.
"I get the picture," John said, trying to head off any further listing of the number and type of sexual partners a person could have. "I think you need to stop watching porn. Have you even slept tonight? Look at me, Sherlock."
Mycroft looks down at his notes and turns one of the pages over, but Sherlock is surprised to see it's a stalling tactic. Mycroft needs to say something he thinks will distress one of them.

Sherlock is in Serbia to wrap up the last of the human trafficking ring that Moriarty's people were responsible for. At this point, Sherlock's vision has narrowed to one thing. John. Every time Sherlock gets the shit beaten out of him, barely escapes getting shot, lives rough, goes a day without food – he pictures John sitting in his chair at the Baker Street flat drinking a cup of tea and waiting for Sherlock to come home.
. I thought you sent him here?"
"Takes two," he says wearily.
"Just tell me!" The first cracks in Gerald's facade are making an appearance. There's an unspoken
To the man's utter detriment, he gives John the once over and decides John isn't a threat, even as John is advancing on him.
John gave Mycroft the two finger salute and then turned to Mrs. Hudson who was still bent over, scratching Sherlock under the chin while he purred. "Mrs. Hudson? My work schedule is fairly static, but I do work four days a week, ten hours a day. Including transportation time but I'll be here every night, so that's something the two of you don't have to worry about."
Gerald's lip is still red from the stitches John took out the day before. It'll heal nicely, and the scar will only be visible up close. Every time John looks at it, he remembers Gerald sitting on the toilet seat half-hard, eager to comply with any command John chooses to give. The scar, the voice, and the deprivation all coalesce into one aching mass of need deep inside John and when Gerald stops in front of him in the bedroom, two seconds behind John's more mad dash, John's decision is made.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "All this bother for a cup of tea! John, will you please make me a cup of tea."
once thought incapable, that puts the last crack in John's glued together heart, reminding him of how he felt when Sherlock first came home, in those moments when he could see that Sherlock felt a little dead inside, and tried so hard to mask it, and John felt so fucking helpless, he thought his chest might cave in, that it might be
"Well, I only gave you two dayth a week to thaving liveth, and I can't imagine that would be enough time to thave everyone in the whole world. Exactly how many people
"Unhand me!" Sherlock said, pulling on his arm. "And I will! I
"Oh, my," she murmurs. "You do have a way with words, Mr. Holmes."
John grinned. "Absolutely."
Sherlock jumped up, scowling magnificently. "But every time I try to discuss it with you, you fob me off!"
John deposited Sherlock on the floor in the bathroom and told him to stay put.
"Whatever you decide is fine, John," Sherlock says, trying to be accommodating.
John, is worried that John won't have time for him any more, maybe that John will move out. So he does the only thing he can think of. He tries to seduce John to make him stay.
When he gets home that evening, Sherlock isn't home. John already checked his phone for text messages when he left the hospital, but he checks again just in case he missed something. There's nothing. He sends one of his own.
mean, exactly?" Mycroft's diction was as crisp as if he'd been awake for hours.
"Um," John says, surprised, of course, because he never would have guessed Sherlock would be into—
"I'm calling because I was told there was a paycheck and a pension I'm supposed to be receiving."
"Who are you?" John whispered, but got no further because there was a hard punch to his gut, so painful that it knocked the wind out of him. He looked at his stomach, expecting a cannon ball to have lodged itself in his diaphragm. There was no explanation for the horror of what he was suffering—
“What the fuck are you doing?” Blaine asks, swaying a little where he stands.
"You are my heart and Moriarty knew it, even before I did. Everything I did was only because I wanted to protect you."
Over 300 Johnlock Fanart (porn) images downloaded and sorted as part of the "Your Daily Dose of Johnlock Fanart" email that I sent every night during the summer to Jenn, Katie, Tia, and Meg. I didn't actually send all 300 images to my email group, mind you, just the ones that went with that day's theme.
But he also reads about high heels being a signifier of power in women and that the same could be true for men.

Bernie mock-snarls. "Greedy."
John says, "Okay," managing not to sound like he's crying (though he is, shamelessly). "I'm going to cover you up with this duvet behind you, look at my hands, see? They're moving behind you, and this duvet right here—look, Sherlock, please—okay it's coming up behind you now, over your shoulders, and there you go." John crouches in front of him, tucking the duvet in, only letting himself stay connected to Sherlock through a single point of contact—his hand cupped lightly against Sherlock's knee. (Like it fucking matters—like they aren't already connected at a cellular level, but it makes John feel better, dammit).
"Indeed," Sherlock says sharply.
anymore. One day, Mrs. Hudson breaks down in tears and tells him she wishes she had done for Sherlock what she now does for John.
In the dining room, Mycroft sat, already besuited and polished. "Good morning, John," he said, and folded up the newspaper he was reading. "How's Sherlock this morning?"
Although he can't help but wonder what Sherlock would've thought if he could see John having a wank in his bed. What kind of fucked up person does that anyway?
"So, last night. Was that your way of telling me?" John asks, swallowing visibly. His face has paled but there are two red spots high on his cheeks and along his ears.
"And you know that for a fact, do you?" she asks in her irritatingly know-it-all voice that reminds him of Harry when they were kids, back when they fought over couch space, and who got to sit in the front seat, and who got to shower first (and whoever went first got screamed at for using all the hot water), as opposed to now when they don't fight at all because at some point between Harry's drinking problem and John off at war in Afghanistan, they turned into strangers who were too busy falling apart to bother fighting with each other.
"Yeah, okay," John says with a grin.
John nods though his laughter. "I have. I would say he's quite handsome."
"About the PTSD?"
"I don't want to
Sherlock knows the choice is between dying or surrendering. He still values his life because he has a strong will to survive, to return to London and John. But he also values his life in part because he lives in fear that there's something he's missed, that Moriarty has one last trick up his sleeve even after death and that someone will get to John and make him pay for nothing more offensive than being Sherlock's friend.
Sherlock considers sending Gerald a bouquet of flowers, because no matter how jealous of the man he's been (and he has been
"Yeah, sorry," John says, unable to hide his blush.

"Mm," John says, food in his mouth, taking the proffered glass of glittering pale wine. He swallows. "Ta."

"Then what's your kink?"

, especially the Chief Superintendent whose nose John kindly broke."
Sherlock finds himself completely unprepared as to what to say or do. When he imagined John breaking up with Gerald, his imagination skipped over the part where John was sad over his breakup

"I don't have to shave my legs or anything, do I?"
and how to identify it, one of those grey areas that John only had opinions on, not facts. Sherlock found opinions to be less useful than facts, as though opinions were unnecessary to understanding.
When John gets home that night, the flat feels empty the way it used to after Sherlock died, and John experiences a flash of vertigo trying to collate what John knows intellectually—
When she lets go, she turns into a different Mrs. Hudson—the one who can give Sherlock Holmes a tongue lashing that sees his head bowing in contrition like a naughty child. (The only person who can do that in addition to his mother.).

“You want me to beg?” Blaine asks, trying for dismissive but sounding eager instead.
All debts forgiven in the end
He stops at the window, pauses a moment, trying to rein in his feelings, and finding he can't, not anymore. He feels as fragile and unsure as he did the first night home, when desperation and relief made him take John in hand, knowing it would be the only time John would allow him to break the rules without paying for it later. Oh, but he has after all, hasn't he? Paid for it?
—and tugs. John's momentarily overwhelmed by uncertainty, lying naked in bed with the man he loves—
"No, it's I who is greedy," Sherlock says, leaning over John to look up at Bernie. "I'm afraid I can't part with John, not even for Milton."
man—with every last whatever-it's-worth piece of himself buried way down in Sherlock's bones.

, still half-convinced he's imagining things. Sherlock just
—poor Violet! Grieving the loss of her baby boy for eighteen months! And you her favorite! It's not right, Sherlock. I don't care what reason you have—"
John swallows and Gerald makes a sympathetic noise. John gives him his new work schedule and tells Gerald he'll stop by Thursday on his way home from work.
"Yeah, look, I can't explain to you the entire English education system, but the bottom line is I'd planned to leave school at sixteen then go into the army. But my teachers kept pushing me to stay in school longer and finish it out. And then the army recruiter saw my test scores and told me to go to college and when I came out to join as an officer. I was lucky—all along the way, people—mentors, really—kept encouraging me to go further.
John takes the next step with Gerald.
The cluttered, casual room makes John feel like he knows Gerald better. It's almost like peeking into Gerald's mind and nosing around a bit. John smiles.
John groans in annoyance, but it doesn't stop her.
him—probably still loves him. The only reason Sherlock isn't drowning in insecurity is because Gerald is with one of John's other friends now—Sherlock's forgotten the name—who's supposedly the love of Gerald's life.
"John!" he shouts. "
to lie, to grant Gerald this one small mercy (although John's not entirely sure Gerald needs it), but he can't add an insult to Gerald's intelligence on top of the pain he's inflicted by confessing his infidelity. His heart restarts and he takes a deep breath, inflating his lungs although he doesn't need that much air to say the word.
Sherlock turns around, startled into wide-eyed surprise by John's sudden presence. John yanks Sherlock's fist towards him and pulls back the dishtowel. Sherlock has cut the tip of his thumb, through his fingernail and into the meat. John can see white bone shining in the cut for the half second before the wound wells with blood.
Right before Sherlock falls asleep, he feels John's fingers
"If this is about last night, I apologize for my outburst. There, now you can leave," Sherlock says without looking at John.
“I mean, it’s, uh, been awhile since, uh,” Sherlock says, cutting him off. “Since the last time I had, you know, sex.”

then, when John explains himself, she's reluctantly sympathetic. John doesn't take offense, knowing she has an A&E to run and one doctor out for a week means extra work for her, especially on short notice.
He opens the door back to the bedroom to see John sitting on his bed deep in thought.
talk, not
"John!" Sherlock cries, jumping out of his own chair. John winces with him, knowing it must have hurt his ribs. "Mycroft has good news!"
Gerald nods, his face suddenly crumpled in exhaustion. John can see the dark circles under his eyes, even more visible on him because of his pale skin. His eyes are bloodshot and his lip is swollen from being smashed, scrubbed clean, injected with local anesthetic and then sewn up. John very gently presses a kiss to the corner of Gerald's mouth furthest away from the cut.
Finally, Sherlock pulls back to look at John. "You have no idea how fantastic your legs and arse would look in stilettos."
"You told him," Mycroft says flatly.
John helps Sherlock out of his t-shirt and then puts his dressing gown around his shoulders and helps him stand. John pulls Sherlock's bottoms and pants down at the same time. Sherlock's hands are on John's shoulders. His desire to run his hands through John's hair is so strong that his jaw is clenched with the effort of resisting.
John, it turns out, needs no reminding. He yanks the condom off of Sherlock's cock, flicks it onto the floor, and then takes it in hand, his thumb and forefinger teasing Sherlock's foreskin. Sherlock's toes begin to curl, and his arse clenches, while his hips try to thrust his cock into a nonexistent hole. John sits back on his knees, tilts his face up to the ceiling, exposing the whole long column of his throat, and his thumb and forefinger go up, down, up again, and
Didn't think that I could go on without you
Another memory came then, of a much smaller version of the dragon curled up like a cat in John's lap. Mrs. Hudson was there, wasn't she? Yes, she
"It's fine, Sherlock," John says, his voice low and quiet. "Let me get your medicine."
Carefully, he pulled the memory of the man turning into the dragon and held his breath, waiting for the punch. A second—two—five—but nothing. He pulled up the memory of the dragon sitting in his lap and again—nothing.

broken, physically and emotionally. And I welcome being handled a bit delicately, especially these first weeks as I'm still so physically frail.
John pauses, completely taken off guard, as she finishes sliding into the cab. "You frighten me sometimes, you know," he says finally.
When he's been cleaned and stitched and stuffed with medications and solutions, a nurse pushes his IV trolley and walks him (very slowly) to a room where he'll stay before getting on a private plane and heading home. Mycroft is sitting on the bed wearing, of all things, a jumper and jeans. He hasn't shaved in a couple of days.

"So," Greg says, smirking. "You two, then?" and Sherlock says, "I'm sure I don't know what you mean," at the same time that John says, "Yeah, finally," his warm-sand skin burning red along his ears, and chest, and Sherlock feels a possessiveness so strong, however unwarranted, that he takes John by the elbow, and whispers in his ear, "I need to talk to you." John gives him a look of puzzlement, but acquiesces, and Sherlock almost drags him to the bedroom, aware of Greg and Mycroft's eyes (especially
"Breaking up is always awkward when the two of you share the same friends, but you two will get over it. After all, Cyril has finally professed his love, and I'm quite sure he's been keeping Gerald busy. The two of them haven't even been showing their ugly faces they're so busy shagging—"
"That sounds ominous!" John said. Yelled, really, as they were trying to hear each other from across the field.
, John!" and John starts laughing again.

, one of whom has kept him informed on the progress of the audit, which was completed two months ago. I've been trying to influence the Met, through subtle means, of course, to clear your name publicly, but they're dragging their feet.
"Last night was me tossing my hat into the ring," Sherlock says. He brings his hands up, pressing his fingertips together.
"What? There's no way I'm passing you a four week old baby!" John says, rising to hand Milton off to one of his mothers, but Sherlock says, "Just trust me," and John does trust him. He hands the squalling bundle over and can't help but sigh in pleasure at the gentle way Sherlock cradles the baby before laying him on his chest. He holds him there with one hand and begins to hum, the noise low and vibrating in his chest. Milton almost immediately falls quiet.
. Stop—" Sherlock says, and then waves the hand not holding John in a gesture that implies John should stop being
Sherlock's kiss is so thoroughly distracting, that John doesn't even realize his pants are down around his thighs until Sherlock says, "Off," and tugs on them. John steps back dazedly, and pushes them all the way down, and straightens up for another kiss, but still has one leg of his pants caught around his ankle, so he kicks his leg out behind him, sending the pants flying against the wardrobe.
, as in today, because obviously you want me
"Yep," John says. "It's sad, breaking up with someone you care about. It'll be a long time before we can repair our friendship."
"Yes," Gerald acquiesces and takes John's hand.
. He rocks back on his heels, and smiles at Sherlock, preening.
"I'm gonna have a shower and then go to bed."
Gerald is teasing but his eyes are dark with arousal. The idea of going home with him causes desire to uncurl deep inside John's belly.
John stared at the crate in his sitting room. There was no shipping information on it—it was just a wooden slat crate, about three foot squared. He walked closer and looked down at the top of it. The lid was nailed down. Whatever was in it wasn't for him.
"Yeah, we did. Not telling me was a really dick move on your part."
Of course, the first definition is a given. The second one? He notes the word
. John sighs against Gerald's neck. Gerald's cheek brushes John's temple. The way Gerald smells is familiar—the fit of his body against John's is comfortable. There's nothing sexual in this hug, though. There's a wistful, bittersweet nature to their embrace—it's apology and forgiveness in one gesture.
Normally, on the days John has to go to work, his alarm wakes both of them. They might snog for a bit, or maybe they'd have a quick blow job or hand job. Sherlock almost never sleeps through John's alarm. But Wednesday morning he does—or pretends to. John hesitates, wanting to wake him, but remembers how ugly it got the night before and decides it's better if they give each other some breathing room.
John turns the fan on (no need for Gerald to hear water splashing in the toilet, but John doesn't want to turn the shower on and waste hot water), and then gathers a basin of lukewarm water and a tiny tube of silicone gel. The bulb of the douche kit is clear, which John finds ingenious because he can check for backwash and clean accordingly.
