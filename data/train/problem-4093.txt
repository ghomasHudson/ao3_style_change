Castiel didn’t move straight away, standing close at Dean’s side as his blue eyes analysed the room they’d landed in. Dean didn’t even realise he was still holding onto the angel until Cas took the smallest step forward, testing the floorboards with his weight. Dean didn’t particularly want to let go, and he found himself moving with the angel as his grip went slack, casting out his shadow across the floor for them to walk across soundlessly instead.
Which meant he had to find some sort of alternative way to stick a syringe in the angel without his permission before tomorrow morning, because John would never forgive him for this.
"That's real sweet of you, Cas," Dean murmured playfully. "See, this is why you're my favourite person."
decision, and more importantly, for the past hour not only have you been tolerable, but you have also been the first demon I've ever met to behave as if there are no differences between our races whatsoever. You're a smart kid, you're not a threat, and you've promised my good health. Stop. Apologising."
It was cute, but it had Castiel worrying that the novelty of their phone calls would eventually wear off. The kid was still young. He'd find other more interesting things as he went about his life and Castiel wasn't counting on this friendship of theirs lasting longer than a year.
And to think that Cas had confessed to being mistreated by other demons in the past – purely because he was an angel! It was no fucking wonder Cas had lashed out the way that he had. If this was a recurring thing – if Cas was continually lied to and abused by demons – then Dean didn’t blame him. Hell, he’d let Cas hit him as much as he fucking wanted if the deal wasn’t in place because this was just so
He felt like he was going to throw up by the time he made it back outside, giddy with adrenaline and overwhelmed by the abrupt change in the quality of air. He almost felt faint as he got his bearings, his wings bumping against a dumpster when he extended them for his journey home.
He went about it as fast as he could, not wanting to linger in such an unsanitary place for longer than needs be. The boy was waiting for him outside the cubical, looking utterly repulsed with his surroundings, and Castiel brushed past him to reach the sinks, washing his hands before cleaning the wounds on his wrists whilst they were still exposed, wincing at the sting and hot burn as the water ran over the flesh.
Castiel hadn’t given her much at all, but it had seemed that she was in the exact same position that he was: alone with no one to turn to for help. He’d given her money, and she’d conjured him a spell.
The boy kept quiet, opening the door further and stepping to the side as if to welcome Castiel in. His silence was slightly unnerving, but Castiel wasn’t one to judge. For all he knew, the boy could be a mute, and if he were to pass comment, that could cause an assortment of problems that he would rather not face. He intended to keep this meeting civil and as friendly as he could make it.
Dean kept silent for a few moments, leading Castiel to believe that something bad had been mentioned. He was actually rather frightened to ask who Dean's uncle was in case it made things difficult between the boy and himself, and it only added to Castiel's concern knowing that Dean could have easily been encouraged to approach him in the bar in the first place.
Castiel didn’t bother responding to that. He didn’t want to argue. Dean had already been to the property and returned, so there was no point discussing the matter further when it would likely create tension prior to the hunt.
He could see Rufus from the corner of his eye helping Bobby up from the ground, both men covered in blood and relying on each other for support. For a split second Dean could see this expression on Bobby's face that almost made Dean regret what he was doing, but he finished ripping the creatures apart anyway, finding himself doused in blood as their corpses were thrown about the dining room in pieces.
But he still didn't know her that well, and he doubted Castiel would be all that pleased to find out he'd been spiritually probed whilst he was out of it.
His vision spun as he tried to focus on the character before him; fully aware of whom it would be before such a thing came about, and he grimaced, pushing the musty blanket from his chest in an attempt to rid himself of the cover. It only reminded him again of the falseness the boy had demonstrated, leading him on with ideas of freedom to provide him with hope, few bizarre acts that had suggested kindness, only to rip them away and replace the hope with terror.
What was surprising, however, was the blanket that was draped over his shoulders. It wasn’t the gentlest of gestures, but it was a peculiar one, and Castiel looked up at the boy in confusion as he walked away.
They didn’t talk again for a long while after that, and it took Castiel far too long to realize as to why that was. If it had been a different situation – if the boy hadn’t been crying into his shoulder earlier on – then Castiel could have quite possibly laughed at the utter absurdness of it all, but this was far too fucking depressing for him to even try and find it relatively humorous.
Dean lethargically made his way downstairs, fanning himself briefly with his hand. It was a lot cooler on the lower level and it was so fucking refreshing to feel the breeze hit him as he walked on through to the kitchen. He'd had the bedroom windows open, but that had done fuck all for him in the long run, and with the AC broken upstairs, Dean didn't really have the same kind of air circulation as the ground floor did. He'd ended up closing the curtains to keep the light from hitting his laptop screen anyway, so maybe that hadn't helped, but whatever. Point was, it wasn't as hot here, and Dean was so fucking grateful for it.
He'd never seen a rugaru get torn apart before. Didn't even know it was possible to kill them with anything other than fire.
Castiel drew out the new knife he'd been given, admiring it once again. He'd honestly never seen anything quite like it and was genuinely surprised that Crowley had gifted it to him at all, apology or not. Castiel had made sure to destroy the wooden box it came in in case it had been influenced with a tracking spell, but he hadn't spied anything on the weapon that remotely looked like tampering. It was clean; there wasn't even any wear on the blade which gave Castiel the impression that it was actually brand new.
Actually, Dean couldn't really comment on that. He hadn't overheard any conversations between Bobby and John since that first night, and obviously, Dean hadn't asked the older man on his stance, but in a way, keeping silent about the incident was just as bad as being supportive of it.
It was a pretty nice place; fancy albeit dust-covered furniture was spaced out evenly all over the room, and there wasn’t any clutter at all.
"Ignore me, Dean. I just can't afford to be optimistic," he grimaced, staring off at the wall opposite the bed to avoid eye contact. "I know for a fact this illness isn't going to kill me though. The reason I'm struggling at the moment is because it's poisoned my blood, and, uhhh ... that's quite a lot to heal myself of."
It was rare to see anyone about his area of forest as it was, and he’d be able to sense if someone was near, but only whilst he was conscious. His senses dulled considerably whilst he was asleep which was most unfortunate. He definitely needed to eat more if he wanted to improve that, but it would only be temporary, so there wasn’t much point. He knew he wouldn’t ever have a consistent flow of wealth, so saving his money for when he needed it most was always the more sensible option.
Dean came to a stop, his hands practically shaking with nerves as he tried to muster up some kind of facade he could use to get him through the early stages of conversation.
Dean sat down on the settee when he reached it, bundling up the blanket and pillow before stuffing them into his duffle as best he could. His hands were still a little shaky and he took in a deep breath to try and compose himself, closing his eyes as he toyed with the strap of his bag.
He didn’t understand how an angel could survive without using their Grace. That was their life energy, and if Castiel couldn’t even function at the same level as a human without using the bare minimum of said energy, then how the hell would he be able to keep hunting?
The hand Cas used to hold the blade began to glow white as the angel adjusted his grip, the rest of his body dimming as it seemed all of his energy was being channelled into the weapon. “A strigoi,” he snarled, bending his knees slightly as the figure breached the furniture’s wreckage, and Dean stared across at the beast in horror, watching the humanoid head lurch toward them on a snake-like neck.
Rufus had met them early on in the afternoon claiming that the hunt Ellen had given them was a bigger problem than they'd initially thought. The guy had gone ahead to basically scout things out properly, meaning that Dean and Bobby could be a lot more prepared beforehand, but it had been kinda messy in the end regardless. Six ghouls had set up shop in this little town and had started straying from the norm, and
He could hear a dog barking nearby - a constant sound that only made him more conscious of the threats outside of this room. A dog wasn't quite as threatening as a human though. Dogs couldn't open doors or carve sigils into walls.
“I’ve experienced the same dream every night for several years now, Dean. I highly doubt it’s a prediction of any kind.”
intention. He still had to figure out how this whole thing was gonna work if he was really going to act against his dad’s orders. Not only that, but he had to find some way to get Castiel to promise not to kill Sam out of spite or something – and himself, for that matter. As soon as Cas healed Sam, the deal would be over and the angel would be able to do whatever the fuck he wanted.
“Don’t know why I didn’t do this before,” the demon mumbled, a smile to his voice, and Castiel gritted his teeth, squirming as the hand moved to settle on the back of his neck. He could feel this obscure coolness enveloping the skin, circling round over his throat and casting an odd kind of restriction over the flesh. It was heavy and strange, and it didn’t take long at all before he realised what it was.
Unsurprisingly, Castiel’s Grace was even brighter than the light the phone provided, but the most important thing was that Dean could see the time on the screen, his heart sinking when he noticed just how early it was.
"I can laugh at you if I like, you big loser," Castiel told him, and Dean snorted, rolling onto his back.
"A very important experiment," Castiel insisted, looking back down to the boy's palm, dragging a finger over the healed skin. "Ta-da."
a good idea," the boy mocked, pushing him lightly before straightening up. Castiel watched with alarm as the black lenses flickered down over Dean's eyes, his mind going blank for a second as the demon took a step back. "You pretty much collapsed, and moving in your state is just gonna increase your blood loss. Get some fucking rest and I'll go deal with this."
He twisted around so that his back was to the boy and his forehead was resting against the wall once more, feeling exhausted and weak with his eyelids sticking shut.
It was rare for Dean to have a bad night’s sleep. He wasn’t necessarily a light sleeper, but there were only a few nights a year that Dean found himself lying awake for hours, over-thinking to no end. His thoughts usually revolved around upcoming hunts or arguments with his immediate family.
for it?” Castiel countered, turning the page. “Did you buy this during the three seconds you disappeared in before?”
Forming a rock alternative to a pull-up bar was far easier than any of the other modifications Castiel had made to the rest of his home in the past, and it didn't take him long at all, the rock grinding beneath his palms as it was shaped to fit his design perfectly.
He'd thought it weird at first: why the angel would want to take as much as he could, but after what Castiel had said about issues with work and the treatment he received in general, Dean kind of understood why it was actually a pretty good idea. This whole event - the confining, and the plans to murder him - had all been arranged by who Dean could only assume was Castiel's employer. John hadn't said much about it, and Dean hadn't met with whoever it was himself, but it was rare for a lower class hunter to trade in something - or
It would reflect incredibly badly if other hunters heard that Castiel had tried to heal a human and it had only resulted in their death regardless of his efforts. Not that reputation was all Castiel was basing his decision on. It was only fair that Castiel warn Dean of the current situation, and that the older man's death was still a possibility.
the hunting life. People died on hunts all the time. He shouldn't have been letting himself feel this uneasy at the prospect of someone he barely knew passing on.
He swore, glancing down as more of his shadow went to work on the second monster, snapping its jaw clean off in his anger. It went to bite him again despite the injury, encouraging Dean to string the beast up in the air in exactly the same manner he had with the first one, slowly bending each limb the opposite way as it choked on the blood pouring down its throat.
He rolled his lips between his teeth, trying to relax himself a little. "Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you," he began softly, hating how dry his mouth had become. "You're gonna be fine. They're going to the hospital, so they'll be gone a while. I'll take you outside when they leave."
damage if his health had improved this drastically. Having just thought that Castiel was angry with him for the earlier events, it had him watching the angel apprehensively.
Castiel swallowed thickly, rubbing a hand down his face as he tried to come up with a reply of sorts. He was the reason Dean had been abandoned, and here he was struggling to think up a sympathetic response because he was a selfish bastard and hadn't wanted to spend his time making sure that Dean was okay! He knew that Dean didn't like being on his own - that the kid was going through a lot and solitude would most likely only make things harder for him - and yet still Castiel had opted to return home.
Castiel didn’t even want to know why the child knew his name, and he scowled, pulling back and bringing his knees up to his chest. His back felt like it was tearing open all over again, but he withheld his wince, resting his forehead against his kneecaps. The treatment he was receiving was incredibly degrading; he didn’t want to be babied by anyone, let alone a child.
Castiel laughed, his eyes lighting up as he propped himself up on his elbows. "Quite arrogant of you to assume I care about you enough to ensure your safety with a deal," the angel retorted, but there was a fondness in his gaze that had Dean breaking out in a grin, his face feeling warm.
Cas was different. Cas was older and probably wouldn't put up with Dean's shit as much as Sam did. He was also
The mattress moved beneath him, a signal that Dean had left his side, although his presence remained in the room. The fact that the demon had moved didn't really faze him, but he gingerly reached to touch the dressing to reassure himself that Dean had covered the gashes fully.
Castiel looked up at this point, staring at the back of the boy's head, taking in the tense posture. He knew exactly what they were talking about, but it didn't bother him as much as it would have ten minutes ago, the guarantee of his return home still an unbreakable deal, and there was no way he'd let the boy go back on it now. Such a proposition required both members to agree, and even if the demon attempted to break their promise, Castiel would still be able to evade harm and spells the boy decided to trap him with. That was quite possibly the most reassuring aspect.
The angel smirked. "Meditating? Is that something you assumed yourself or did your father plant that idea in your mind?"
! Castiel couldn't recall the last time he'd had this much power to spare on himself, and as bizarre as it was for him, he almost craved the feeling of being able to do as he pleased without fear of sacrificing something else in the place of healing.
Again, Dean was confused. Nothing about that played any importance in what they'd just been discussing, apart from maybe proving that Cas wasn't a threat. John had always talked about angels like they were too guarded, in the sense that they were overly aggressive. Cas had acted that way, but only after Dean had taken him captive. When Dean had first opened the door on him, Cas had actually come across as kind of pleasant.
A few things did come to mind, but nothing that would really stand up in an argument. Like, surely if Castiel had the power to charm people he would actually use it to get what he wanted, and that would probably start with getting out of hunting altogether, because with the way the angel went on about it all, Dean imagined Cas would do whatever possible to go back to having a human life.
So if Bobby wasn’t willing to help out more than he had to, Dean would try his best to convince Pamela.
Dean blinked a couple of times, looking around him. "Yeah, I just ... I didn't mean to fall asleep on you, Cas. I'm sorry," the boy mumbled, somewhat hunched forward as he rubbed at his eyes. He still looked half asleep, his movements sluggish now that he'd sat upright and his right cheek darker in colour than the other from where it had been pressed to Castiel's chest.
"Where is it?" John asked coldly, and Dean stared up at him in defiance, trying his best to put on a brave front. He didn't want to be continually interrogated and belittled for being sensible - especially when he'd apparently considered everything his dad
The question hung in the air for a moment, and it wasn't because Dean didn't have an answer but more that he wasn't prepared for that kind of question.
Dean grinned when he felt the wet nose snuffle against the back of his neck, somewhat surprised that the dog hadn't kicked up a fuss the moment Dean had stepped foot on the land. He reached behind him to rub at the top of Rumsfeld's head, subtly trying to keep the rottweiler from licking the side of his face. He wasn't that much of a dog person, but Rumsfeld was okay; gentle and friendly, and actually pretty chill for something that he was generally kind of scared of.
you if I think it's annoying," Castiel told him, wincing at the scrape of bark beneath his palm. "Now, you definitely have a place to stay, right? Do you need money?"
deserves to go through something like that, not even an angel, so I ended up making a deal with him because I figured 'hey!'" He huffed out a laugh nervously. "'Least this way he can't kill me if he's lying', but he kept his word and he made sure Sam was
"Hey, you got everything you needed, right?" The demon queried, a more serious tone accompanying his words, and Castiel nodded, stilling when the fingers touched at the back of his wrist. "Leave it then. I'll just take you back to the cabin."
Maybe it was slightly harsh of him to despise demons so very much for the lifestyle he was forced to endure now, but they really were the reason why he’d lived without education; why he’d lived alone and been made to construct a home from his environment.
“I was … kinda expecting something more elaborate than that,” Dean continued, watching Castiel’s fingers twitch slightly against his jaw. “Anything else happen?”
Dean could feel the warmth radiating from Castiel’s bare legs beneath the sheets. It was comforting in a way that also had Dean perpetually on edge, so of course he stayed in the exact same position as he summoned part of his shadow from beneath the comforter, letting it rest atop the bedding beside Castiel’s right hand.
But he had been feeling fairly guilty about that. Castiel was still meant to be healing, yet Dean hadn’t exactly checked up on Cas’s wound to see if he was recovering okay whilst all this was going on - not that he’d really be able to redress the wound unless he wore gloves or something. It was one of those things that he was conflicted about doing because Cas was usually kinda hesitant to let Dean check him over anyway. A lot of it was probably down to his age because he knew the guy trusted him, but weirdly enough he actually felt kinda awkward when he thought about looking over the injury now.
Castiel’s phone had rung a couple of times over the past day and a half, making Dean very aware that someone was trying to contact Cas to check in. Dean had thought about answering it just to let them know Cas was stilling kicking, but he was also kinda worried of picking up and speaking to someone his dad was friends with. He also wasn’t too keen on the idea of letting Cas’s employer know that the guy was in such a bad way that he’d been unconscious since the hunt.
Dean turned the desk light on, his eyes scouring over the nearest selection of books. He knew Bobby would probably go off on another rant if Dean tried going into an argument again without knowing as much as possible so he figured studying for a bit wouldn't hurt. He couldn't really think of any other way he'd want to spend his time - especially if he'd be able to convince Bobby to give him his phone back after coming up with a solid argument.
Not that he was, like, considering a relationship with her or anything. He liked her, but he was pretty sure that Ellen would throw a fit if anything did actually happen between them. Not only that, but the thought of dating someone made him feel a little nervous and he didn't want to fuck things up with Jo by accident and ruin a good thing, because, in all honesty, he didn't know how relationships even functioned. Judging by the stuff he'd seen on TV, he knew that it would kind of take up a lot of his free time, and he didn't really feel comfortable enough with his current situation to give that up right now. Whilst that probably sounded a little selfish, wouldn't it be more selfish to start a relationship and then rarely hang out with them at all?
, Cas. I'm the one should be asking if you're okay or not. I mean, what did you even do with Sam just then?"
"No, I just ... I made a deal a while ago without telling anyone and I think Bobby's just worried there'll be consequences or something," he murmured, kicking the stool again. "it's not as bad as Bobby's making it out to be."
Because he had no plan. He had nowhere else to go. It was something he knew he should be prepared for already but it was just such a shit thing to think about and he'd tried his best to ignore the idea altogether, even more so recently since getting back on good terms with the older man.
old, because in every adaptation Dean had read through so far, both angels and demons had a weird relationship with the humans on the planet. It almost seemed like this was before they'd all been integrated into any kind of society whatsoever, so both species usually kept away from humans unless they wanted something. Well, until this one angel decided to watch over some random farming family and suddenly everything got thrown into an absolute
infection was setting in. It would taint his blood and he would no longer be of any use to his captor. He would die, or be released, and neither option was particularly interesting to him anymore. He felt numb.
"Crowley, now is not a good time," Cas advised sharply, laying a hand on Dean's arm gently as he walked past to head outside, the light around his form flickering until Dean couldn’t physically see him anymore. The door was left ajar behind him, but Dean didn't care much to eavesdrop, having heard the first few sentences and picked up straight away that Castiel was talking about an earlier hunt.
Why was it so difficult to reason with everyone? And why were they all so dead set on making Castiel out to be the villain in all of this? Dean was finding it harder and harder to piece together an argument that didn't encourage some sort of critical response, and given Bobby's last enquiry, Dean was done. He didn't know what else to say. Fuck, he didn't
“Anyway,” Dean huffed, looking off to the side at the shelf of tinned fruit. “Psylocke can do something similar – later on in her story, I mean. Well, she can do a hell of a lot more than the whole telekinesis thing you’ve got going on, but I don’t really know the extent of your power so I dunno what other comparisons I can make yet.”
“You’re being very quiet,” Castiel commented softly, his hair flopping down in front of his eyes when he turned his gaze to the weapons on the ground beside him; the barrel of his gun probably clogged with the woodland dirt. He couldn’t be bothered to deal with it right now, and as hypocritical as it was, Castiel was tired of the silence. Dean was both strange and amusing, and it wasn’t so much an instigation out of pity because Castiel truly wanted to talk.
"Text me a time and place, and I'll be there," Castiel grunted, hanging up almost immediately before tossing his phone to the couch in frustration. The call was what he'd needed in all honesty, and now that some form of plan was in the works, he'd actually be able to find out if he was still employed.
Dean took a few steps closer, toying with the napkin in his hands. "If I don't go back, I won't be able to get a change of clothes," he pointed out, running his eyes over the Cas's hunched figure. "Guess I won't mind too much if you're sleeping naked too though, Castiel."
"Cas, I don't want you wasting your Grace on me when you need to focus on getting better," he insisted as sternly as he could.
Cas sauntered off towards where he'd left the opened beer, grabbing the bottle by the neck before taking a long drink, keeping his back to Dean all the while. Dean never got an answer to that question in particular, Castiel apparently no longer finding the topic of conversation entertaining - if he ever had in the first place.
But Dean refused to be used as a scapegoat for his dad's shitty plans. It was one thing being kept from Sam, but to have John try to turn Bobby on him too wasn't fair in the slightest.
But it was something that both Bobby and Rufus needed to be a lot more grateful for. If Dean hadn’t been friends with Castiel, Bobby would be fucking dead.
"Hello," Castiel greeted, holding his smile. He hadn't expected the demon's approach to be as confident as this, even if Dean had told him that Sam would be more accepting, but it was certainly more preferable than being feared or deemed inferior.
It would have been a whole lot easier for everyone to come to the motel, but Dean felt almost guilty to suggest that, knowing Bobby was going out of his way as it was. Sure, the older man may have offered him a lift, but it was getting stupidly late and Bobby had literally just left the hospital. He needed to rest more than anything else, and there wasn't exactly a comfortable seat in this cramped motel room for him to take.
It was probably the first time Dean had ever been more scared of John than any of the monsters he'd been told about.
"You're not really making much sense," Castiel told him in amusement, watching the light blush stain the boy's skin as the child pulled at the threadbare denim of his jeans, clearly making it something of a nervous habit. "But regarding the situation, I didn't mind. It was my fault for upsetting you in the first place, and I'm not entirely comfortable with the thought of you leaving those you love for my benefit," he shrugged, rubbing at his brow. "A kid your age shouldn't be essentially blackmailed into fulfilling a task - let alone by the likes of your father. It's fucking disgusting for him to abandon you when all you did was make a choice to protect your family. He should be proud of you for thinking things through."
"Well, you and I both already know that you don't intend on ratting me out to the Union," Crowley said, rolling his pen between his thumb and forefinger. "Or, at least, not yet." There was a pause, and Castiel looked up to see Crowley gesture flamboyantly toward him. "So, in a way, my proposition is actually more of a negotiation."
It wasn't fair. Dean didn't want anyone getting in trouble, and although Bobby was one of the most trustworthy people he knew, he still didn't want to risk anything.
To be frank, Dean was still pretty worried about the guy too. Castiel wasn't all that open about his current state - and Dean wasn't expecting him to be - but he was willing to help in any which way he could so long as he could truly show his gratitude.
“No, no, no - what the fuck, Cas! Stop!” Dean yelled, hastily grasping at his arm, but Castiel batted him off harshly, frustrated as the tie between his and Bobby’s form was interrupted.
Ellen had mentioned something about a hunt to them last week, but Dean had no idea if Bobby had taken it up. He'd actually kind of assumed that if Bobby would head out, he'd take Dean with him.
“Thought you couldn’t heal me til tomorrow,” he grumbled bitterly as the blood welled from the wound, but he welcomed Cas’s gentle touch to his wrist and the cool sensation that came with it, the pain numbing completely within seconds.
Now I've got a ton of work I have to prep for my final art show in a week, seeing as I left the project til last minute, as per usual, but I will be back soon
"I can help!" Dean chirped, turning his body so that it faced Castiel completely. "If you're worried about taking on a nest by yourself, I'll come with you."
“He may say he’s feeling fine, but his Grace is having some sort of … basically, whatever was cast on Sam is blocking Castiel’s energy flow,” Pamela replied. “I don’t know much about angels, but it looks like that’s probably why he’s not conscious right now.”
"Hey, dog!" He called, following up with a whistle until Rumsfeld came thudding toward him, the ball flicked in his direction with a sharp toss of the dog's head. Dean caught it with his shadow before it could smack into his shin, raising it in the air until Rumsfeld was seated, his big brown eyes utterly focussed on even the slightest movement.
I can still check up on him. It's not like ..." He gestured in Castiel's direction pathetically. "I mean, you've been nice to me, y'know - nicer than the hunters my dad's friends with anyway, and that's even after all the shit I put you through - and you actually talked to me, and listened, so of course I want to make the most of it when you're the only person who actually seems to care," he rambled, looking up again.
Well, the bar was somewhere behind Dean, but he hadn't bothered to turn round to see if the issues were with the barman themselves or not. He just assumed it was these guys. They always seemed super loud whenever they walked past the booth Dean was sat at anyway.
"Was that another compliment?" Castiel followed up jokingly, his voice somewhat lower. "You're full of compliments today, Dean."
"Okay," Castiel grunted, sitting up abruptly and frowning. "This thing? You holding me hostage; that was an
Too many times Castiel had tried to save up for an education, but his survival was far more important. He just couldn’t afford to starve himself any more than he already was in the hope of achieving better employment. He needed to be realistic.
Again though, it was a rare magic spell. Castiel had gone on to explain it in a disturbing amount of detail - which did ultimately give Dean the impression that he had used it on someone before - but what made it so rare was how it could be used on all creatures, regardless of race, just so long as you had a tiny amount of their blood.
He didn’t remember falling asleep – he never remembered falling asleep – but he remembered the dream. Always the same dream. Never different.
But, with the way things were looking, it would be very difficult for Castiel to worsen Bobby’s conditional.
Castiel dropped the change into the machine, selecting 'Strangers' by The Kinks, before returning to the barman to continue his downward spiral for the night.
He understood now why his dad always got so angry with him – why he had to compromise and threaten him before a hunt. Dean was weak and stupid. He couldn’t follow orders without struggling or fucking up completely, and this was a prime example of everything wrong with him.
"No, I don't wanna ... don't think about that, Cas," Dean muttered, walking past to get to the storeroom, keeping his focus trained on the new contact details inputted to his phone.
He jolted when the ice cream was crushed against the centre of his chest, recoiling in disgust as Sam ran off laughing.
That rabbit ended up going to waste and Castiel had had to go through the entire process again when he began to feel increasingly light-headed the longer he went without anything to eat.
have a new phone now but he couldn't just phone up and ask someone he'd met three times to take him in. It wouldn't be fair more than anything else.
Castiel pushed at him gently before placing his hand beside Dean's wound again, the angel's fingers touching around the injury with a certain caution that had relief washing over him.
Castiel hummed in response, but didn’t do anything more, staring up at the stars as his own natural light shone just as brightly from him.
"Oh, because you know him so well!" The older man blurted. "You shouldn't even be giving him a nickname! Do you understand why we're concerned? Two days knowing an
Castiel shut up as soon as Dean willed the sigils to erase from the collar, the angel's Grace growing brighter and his eyes fluttering shut as he leant against the wall, almost in a state of bliss.
something because Dean doubted Castiel was comfortable being stared at like that when he hadn’t even done anything wrong.
“One less angel to worry about,” Rufus muttered, and Dean could feel the lenses slide over his eyes with his next blink, causing Pamela to tense beside him.
He was surprised when he found the rough material pressed to his abdomen, straightening up slightly as he let Dean pointlessly care for the fresh wound, his Grace barely dulling the pain.
“What? No!” Castiel hissed as he pushed at Dean’s chest, encouraging him to take a few steps back. “And what did I say about going off by yourself?”
"Well this should be interesting," he murmured, sending forward a pulse of energy tentatively. The boy didn't react, so Castiel began to draw the power back, absorbing the minor damage to clear the flesh of harm.
Castiel was too restless to even bother attempting sleep again, regardless of whether he knew trying would be pointless, and he spent the majority of his time sitting at the entrance of the cabin, staring up at the sky from his cross-legged position on the floor. He did admittedly check up on the child numerous times during the night, not really feeling comfortable with leaving him alone for too long, but he always returned to the doorway, remaining inside of the cabin so the kid wouldn’t kick up a fuss when he woke up.
to heal Dean – when he couldn’t have possibly caused any harm – with that fucking caring expression on his face like he
He walked to the wall where the chain was connected, slamming his forehead against the concrete in an attempt to wake him up a little.
Castiel reached for his hilt slowly whilst the boy’s back was facing him, the demon walking over to a table a short distance away. Castiel drew his gun from the holder, snapping the safety off as quietly as he could before he took aim.
The blade was beautiful, but Castiel wasn't going to let himself be distracted by hollow apologies when he'd much rather a long-lasting bribe.
to maintain this state, he knew it wasn't sustainable in the long run. Not unless he did something different.
"Sammy? Just turned twelve," the boy said slowly before he fell quiet, and Castiel couldn’t help but feel rather disappointed. The boy in his dreams was in that region of age, but they’d remained the same ever since the nightmares had started up four years ago. Nevertheless, he opened his eyes lazily to show the demon he was still listening, observing the way in which the child twisted a corner of the blanket in his right hand. "Couldn't even take him out for his birthday. Poor kid was too weak to get out of bed."
He squirmed when Dean's shadow twitched a little against his thigh, the darkness coiling over the material of his jeans as Dean shifted in his sleep, but he tried to keep as still as possible, not really wanting to wake Dean up. Just because he himself was awake didn't mean he should get the boy up too, even if Castiel did think it sensible for him to leave soon. It was true that he didn't have anything else to do, but he felt like he was over staying his welcome. Spending time with the boy was one thing but he shouldn't have stayed so late that they'd both ended up falling asleep. Especially when it meant Dean had lay cramped with him on the single bed. It wasn't fair of Castiel to potentially make it more uncomfortable for the kid.
But not tonight. Tonight all Dean could think about was the arm that had draped over his waist about a half-hour ago, and the warm breaths that drifted against the nape of his neck.
Then again, given the boy's bizarre personality, he doubted Dean would have phoned after the way he reacted earlier regarding Castiel's weariness. Perhaps it was a little arrogant for him to think as such, but it wouldn't be all that unbelievable if that was indeed the case. Dean had even said that he wouldn't have requested Castiel's company if he'd known about just how much energy it would have wasted.
If he actually managed to achieve this teleportation thing, maybe he'd start putting his hope in other things too.
He didn’t even have anyone he could ask for advice, and he didn’t know what to do. Castiel's body could be shutting down, or it could spontaneously blow up for a second fucking time.
"Well, the last time I made a deal with a demon, they didn't go trying to shove their tongue down my fucking throat. That part sure as hell wasn't compulsory."
Castiel went to sit on the couch, stretching his arms out in front of him. “Not necessarily. I’m not all that tired yet.”
"Oh for ... you know, for a kid, you're really fucking disgusting," Castiel spat, moving away again.
forgiving. Dean had treated the angel like shit, and yet here he was, walking around WinCo with the very same person. Obviously, things between them weren’t
But that wasn't the only discomforting aspect of remaining in the basement for so long, and Castiel was growing tired of simply ignoring the crippling ache in his bladder. The only thing preventing him calling out the demon was his want to keep the boy away from him for as long as possible.
"Yeah, but ..." the boy sighed before Castiel heard him get to his feet, and he did the same, his vision going somewhat bleary as he steadied himself. "You're not sleeping in the basement though. I don't even know how you managed to find it comfortable before."
want any of your clothing,” Castiel blurted, shooting a glare over his shoulder. “Did you not listen to
Castiel narrowed his eyes, the tears still rolling down his cheeks. It completely contrasted: the watery eyes and the rough voice. It was throwing Dean off.
lazier, and he definitely wasn't in as good a shape as some of the other hunters he'd been introduced to. Dean wasn't too fussed about that usually, given that he'd never noticed how much he relied on his powers, but even after a short walk of fifteen minutes he found himself breathing a little heavier.
Dean threw the ball for the dog again, stretching his arms above his head as he mulled over his thoughts.
Dean glanced back at the angel one last time as he carefully tucked the photo back between the pages of the book, placing it in the duffel before getting up to gather Cas's toiletries from the bathroom.
Castiel was more than happy to help, and from his years of hunting, he never expected anything in return, nor would he ask.
Castiel shrugged, starting back in the direction of the basement steps, keen to avoid as much eye contact as possible. “Are we going to discuss this promise of yours then?”
Dean rubbed his thumb over the back of Castiel’s knuckles soothingly, wiping at Castiel’s lips once the angel had spat yet more of the inky-blood into the toilet.
The smile Dean wore softened, and he propped himself up on his elbows, resting his chin in his free hand. "Go to sleep then, Cas. I can call you tomorrow."
It was probably the one thing that could actually aid his sleep pattern, in a manner of speaking. Whilst it didn’t necessarily help him sleep for as long, it kept the nightmares at bay, and Castiel much preferred waking to thoughts of nothing than to cries for help.
There was still an underlying discomfort surrounding the topic though, because either Bobby had had bad experiences with an angel, or he knew someone that had. Dean got that everyone had different views based on their own experiences, but applying the whole 'all angels are murderous' outlook to this scenario really was ignorant. More so when Sam's health was thrown into the equation.
," Cas insisted, encouraging Dean's blush to worsen, but he took the comment in stride, confidently meeting Castiel's gaze.
He’d considered taking in a pet as some form of company in the past, given his isolation, but he lacked the desire to maintain its upkeep. Not only would it be difficult to train a creature not to abandon the cave in which he called home, but he also knew it would be far happier out in the wilderness. He couldn’t force it to like him, and he would only being taking it from its natural environment. It was cruel, and he didn’t want to ruin someone else’s life for his own selfishness.
Dean nodded, even if he did feel a pang of irritation in his chest. There was a lot of information Dean really could have done with before meeting Castiel in the first place, and it did kind of annoy him to think that if he'd had that kind of information prior, Bobby probably would have taken Dean's account of events a lot more seriously.
Even the thought of what John would say when he found out about it had his stomach churning and an acidic taste in his mouth, because Cas didn’t deserve any of the shit John was gonna put him through.
Which had led to Castiel considering more than just a new training regime. He didn't have all that many options in terms of hunting, but there was one thing that he'd been pondering for a while: changing his identity.
Castiel sat on the edge of the bed, watching Dean silently. Dean looked visibly relaxed, his shoulders no longer tense as he moved about the kitchen - occasionally disappearing from the room and reappearing seconds later with another cooking utensil - and it made Castiel feel a lot calmer knowing that the demon was no longer as agitated.
The demon smiled wider, teleporting as opposed to simply walking the three steps toward him, and Castiel grunted as the kid slammed into his chest, winding his arms around Dean's smaller form when Dean pressed even closer.
"I've never studied witchcraft," Castiel added, hoping that it would at least encourage the boy to look more comfortable, but he received little more than a fleeting glance in response.
Still, he intended to call later on to check in on the older man. He’d spent too much time trying to find a way to wake Cas up to really pay attention to anything else over the past few days.
He didn’t particularly need to prioritise such a thing at this present moment. After he’d rid his body of more black bile, his Grace had restored itself to accommodate his wounds and he was feeling rather energised. Not so energised that he’d been able to heal himself
The question seemed to waken the boy a little more, the demon's frown deepening and his fingers clenching the material held in his palm.
Castiel shrugged listlessly, and Dean ducked his head almost immediately, knowing he was probably only going to make things uncomfortable for the guy if he continued to pry.
"I just want to make sure," Castiel insisted, clearing his throat as his head swam. "If I don't heal you properly, the illness could come back, so I'd prefer to be thorough than risk your health."
But then again, wasn't that a summary of any demonic spawn? Cruel liars who loved nothing more than to watch others suffer? He had never trusted the boy in the first place, merely surprised by the out of character actions the child had so poorly attempted just the evening before, and he hated how ridiculous it was to want to trust the demon, purely because of his age.
but given what Cas had said about the negative views associated with even thinking the guy relatively okay, Dean guessed that it was probably wiser for them to just go their separate ways and keep it that way.
With Ellen and Jo living at a hunter's bar, Dean could imagine the story spreading like wildfire if Dean so much as name-dropped the angel once around them in conversation. The Harvelles thought Dean was currently staying at Bobby's to focus on studying for the summer, and even though Ellen had been kinda surprised by the idea of John letting Dean take a break from hunting, it wasn't completely implausible. Better than having them tell the other hunters passing through that John Winchester's kid wants to be BFFs with a fucking angel.
“Hope you’re not too offended, but I made that as a sort of precaution,” Dean mumbled, sorta embarrassed by how this must look. “I obviously trust you and everything, but your powers are kinda scary.”
The angel was on the phone for a while, so Dean sat at the table beneath the window, making himself busy by trying to draw those sigils again. If he could perfect the ridiculously small squiggly bits that Castiel had continued to tell him were drawn wrong, then they'd be able to spend more time talking to each other later on instead.
how much pressure was on him - not that he doubted his ability to draw the goddamn thing, but he’d clearly upset the angel with that throwaway comment so adding even one slightly misplaced line would probably result in a stab wound.
He was more than a little surprised when Castiel said nothing about the appearance at all, merely taking the box and setting it down on the counter.
“What would you cook?” He asked, genuinely curious. Given that his meals were dependant on what he had available, he rarely had the opportunity to try new foods.
“Can you please stop with the staring then? I mean, I didn’t come down here to be analysed. I came down to talk.”
The boy cleared his throat, scuffing the floor with his feet a little. “Well, I’ll take you to the motel, and when you’re done healing my brother, I’ll drop you back home so –”
do you know if Sam's healed or not?!" John exploded, striding forward to grab Dean by the front of his shirt. "You let a fucking angel near him and you have
"He's just some guy I met on a hunt a while back," he offered in response, taking a quick drink. He kept his eyes down, even though he knew it probably looked suspicious as hell.
Dean drew his lip between his teeth again nervously, the heat crawling over his face when the angel stared over at him in defiance. It was beginning to make sense why Cas had called him strange if that was the reason as to why the angel was being so open in the first place: because Dean was treating him like he would anyone else he liked.
He wasn’t expecting Castiel to backhand him in the arm, and he jolted in retaliation, bringing his hands up to his chest in defence. “What?!”
But then, that was a stupid assumption of him to make and he quickly ignored the thought altogether. The child was one of the most talkative people Castiel had ever met, so to assume that the demon would be content with silence was a rather ridiculous presumption.
The demon’s eyes flickered to him again, the boy’s brow furrowing. “What? I don’t want to risk anything, okay? Sammy’s too important.”
Dean stalled for a moment, dropping the antiseptic wipe to scrub a hand over his jaw. He didn't really feel comfortable with letting Cas anywhere near Sam if it could be helped, and he still didn't have any evidence that Cas could even do that sort of thing.
didn't look too good, and it wasn't exactly fair of him to shout at the guy when he was blatantly in a lot of pain. "You want me to check it or anything?" He added, making his voice a little softer.
He could hear the boy let out a heavy breath and he rolled his eyes, knowing just how simple it would be for a child his age to feign further upset.
to go. If this hunt was what Sam had predicted, then Dean needed to be there to make sure that Cas would be okay because he still remembered vividly what the kid had told him: that Castiel would be covered in blood, with his Grace diminished to the point where it wasn't even visible.
It was shameful, but at the same time, he appreciated the distance he had from anyone else. He didn't want to be roped into some sort of meaningless acquainted relationship purely because he was of the same species as someone else. The thought alone had him feeling emotionally drained.
“I have no desire to talk to you,” Castiel practically whispered, looking away almost in embarrassment, if the flush on his face was anything to go by. Instead, Cas looked down to the bracelet, touching at the metal with nimble fingers while Dean tried to form a sentence that wouldn’t end up making him seem like a total d-bag.
Dean sat back on his heels in defeat, his entire body numb from the energy that had spiralled through his veins. His skin had been scorched from the contact, three of his fingertips now incredibly sensitive to the air and dark red in appearance.
Castiel frowned, looking down at the box as he pried the lid open. The interior was lined with some kind of purple satin, a garish colour that gave Castiel a headache just looking at it, but between the fabric was a silver knife; very sleek and not at all like anything Castiel had ever seen before. He withdrew the weapon, rotating it between his fingers as he searched for any kind of warding or spells that had been put in place, but he admired the design regardless, even if he usually had a preference for firearms when it came to hunting.
Dean actually didn't even mind the thought of that so long as he could just apologise to the angel for not being able to contact him.
"So, uhhh ..." Dean cleared his throat and Castiel huffed out another slight laugh when Dean stalled, trying to come up with something decent to continue with.
Whenever Castiel was faced with a new decision – a new moment where there were so many outcomes, so many potential futures he was eliminating – he considered every last possibility, anxious as to whether it was indeed, the right choice to make.
Not every hunting firm was run the same way, but Castiel had only experienced the hiring process at one other agency and they were nowhere near as thorough as Crowley was. The demon was incredibly meticulous, and in the beginning, it had brought Castiel a lot of comfort to have his job secured with a deal.
“I’m hunting in good company. Why wouldn’t I be happy?” Dean teased, biting back his laughter when Castiel sighed heavily, looking away.
He had to push the bookcase to the side to find it, but the sigil was stark against the wallpaper, the blood still damp as Dean scratched a fingernail down the centre to render it useless. Taking a step back, he looked to Castiel's slouched figure. "You come across this kind of trap before?"
“The border between Idaho and Montana is as close as you’re going,” he grunted, scowling at the boy when he felt the shadow touch at his ankle. He kicked it away, once more irritated by the lack of reaction instigated by the deal.
Castiel coughed a few times before trying to speak again, looking up at Dean through the strands of his hair before pointing to the bookshelf down the hall.
Castiel could tell the man was human, but even when they began to approach Dean, Castiel couldn't really place them as a prior acquaintance or anything of the sort. He couldn't really say for certain, but it did bother him to know that someone he'd never even met was warning others because of something they may or may not have overheard. Castiel was doing his best to hide his upset despite being concealed because he was so fucking tired of having people continually spread rumours about him and his kind in general. Sure, there were probably manipulative and domineering angels out there, but Castiel did his best to hunt in a way that deemed him equal to his peers, and whilst it often overcomplicated his hunts, he'd far rather that than be criticised for being born a certain species.
"Come on, man. I'm trying to help," he muttered, slinking forward and catching hold of the foot as it hurtled toward his chest, "Dude! Calm the fuck down!"
The demon set down a couple of things on the floor as he crouched, but Castiel didn't bother to examine them, looking off to the patch of light for comfort. He didn’t even try to break away when the demon cupped his jaw, allowing his head to be raised. There was nothing he could really do to fight it anyway.
Dean scowled, stepping up onto the beam as his dad continued to rant on the other end of the line. John was being ridiculous, blatantly making up excuses to persuade Dean to follow his orders, and for the first time ever, Dean doubted his dad’s words. He could remember the things John had told him in the past about angels, and a lot of what he was saying now contradicted those facts, twisted with old myths and this idea that angel blood was the only way to cure someone.
He tensed up at the phrasing, looking over his shoulder to where Rufus was adjusting the dress pillows on the couch, seeing Bobby lain out across the main seat. "What?"
He could hear Castiel swallow, his muscles becoming no less tense than before as he tried to pull away again, and Dean scowled, jerking Cas's arm closer and shooting him a glare in warning. He'd left the medical kit in the basement for a reason, and it was Castiel's own fault if he didn't want to be handled in such a way, given that he'd had all night to sort them out himself.
"You can go now," he muttered, kicking at one of the empty water bottles as he walked past, jolting as the collar was re-leashed to the wall and his distance was restricted. He simply stopped, rubbing his hands over his face in defeat, before pacing in the opposite direction, desperate to keep awake.
done something super awful in the past to warrant so much distrust towards him, then that definitely wouldn’t look good on Bobby at all. Especially if word spread to the rest of the hunter community.
He'd left a couple of times during the evenings: twice to specifically check if Bobby had decided to give his phone back, and the rest simply to use the bathroom.
He smiled timidly when Castiel pushed his hand aside, practically breathing out a ‘don’t touch me’, not once looking away. Dean had expected something a little more aggressive because there was no way Cas could have forgiven him after
"My dad got so pissed before, Cas. He thinks you fucked up my brother," Dean muttered, and Castiel could hear a slight rustling over the sound of his voice. He took a few steps closer to the cavern mouth to prevent the connection from faltering, just in case it was down to static. He knew the reception around these parts could be crap at times, owing to the fact that he was practically out in the middle of nowhere, so he stepped up onto the ledge again, looking down over the forest as he regained his balance, hoping that maybe this would lower the chances of the signal cutting out.
Cas came back into sight shortly after Dean felt a pair of knees hit the floor, and he bundled the fresh corpse up in his shadow before the rest of it had time to land, dragging both decapitated bodies from the hall into the dingy room. Castiel closed the door behind him on his way in, resting against the chipped wood with a hand on the doorknob as he turned to look at Dean. “You doing okay?”
he should have written everything down. Hell, he'd tried memorising Sam's number already, but it had
Not that he would necessarily have needed to be training or developing his powers if he were pursuing a life as a human adult, but hunters were everywhere. Castiel wished he'd known from the beginning that there were genuine threats out there that could have impacted his life at any point and that he should always be ready just in case.
did Dean hope he wasn't. He didn't want to have to kill anyone if it wasn't even a crucial part of the process. Sure, he’d done some pretty nasty stuff over the years, but this? Bleeding someone dry whilst they were kept conscious?
Which is why it was so awkward to know that it was drawn to the angel and that Castiel hadn’t commented on its attentiveness. Dean had initially thought the shadow had been acting as a form of protection like it had in the past, but no.
There was an odd noise that escaped his lips at that thought, his fingers digging into the gravel as his throat began to tighten.
eye colour. Now certainly wasn't the time to ask about it, but seeing as Dean had his number, if the demon
conversation he actually cared about, and he walked briskly over to the stairwell, the sound of his footsteps echoing off the concrete floor only making him feel smaller, even if the space confining him was of a moderate size.
“Wonderful,” Castiel muttered, throwing another antiseptic wipe at the boy so he could finish up, before facing away with his chin in a palm, his free hand toying with the clasps on the medical kit in agitation. He didn’t want to accuse the boy’s father of murder, but that was most likely the outcome of such an encounter – especially when the intent in
Plus he was still dead-set on making a good impression and he doubted talking about an angel would do him any favours. Her mother, Ellen, had probably told just as many warning stories about angels to Jo as John had to Dean and Sam. Dean didn't want anyone else calling him an idiot for being trustworthy or whatever.
He sighed again when the demon's gaze was tarnished with scepticism, knocking the boy's foot with the toe of his boot. "Come on, kid. I want to go home."
Well, 'earlier' as in the past few hours. He certainly hadn't felt anything but anguish until the restraints had been taken off, and even then, he'd still been fairly upset over the betrayal.
He took hold of the crippled instrument, twisting it unceremoniously until he hit gold, adjusting the angle so that it clasped the bullet and he pulled it out slowly, feeling the sweat touch his brow. He should really be grateful it hadn't shattered his shoulder blade or something.
. I don't require the help of a delinquent, let alone someone who can barely dress their own wounds," he chortled, pushing his hair away from his eyes with his free hand. He looked down at the bloodied cloth, frowning at the fresh blood that shouldn't have been there. He hadn't expected there to have been as much blood as this given the way it had been healing over the past four hours, irritated that a scab hadn't even formed over the injury because of the dampness.
He rubbed at his closed eyes in annoyance, ceasing the motion only when he heard Bobby clear his throat as if to start speaking again.
it would be. Broken glass gouging into his skin wasn't exactly a thought he wanted to dwell on, so he walked briskly back across to the front of the cabin with his gun clasped tightly between his hands.
There was a long pause as Dean stared across at her, trying to comprehend what was being said as Bobby continued to shout out questions in his place.
"Dean," he replied, and the angel laughed lightly, their shoulders brushing again as Castiel outstretched one of his legs.
"Dude, that doesn't justify anything," Dean argued. "I was being a jerk. Even if I called you that now it'd probably sound just as condescending - n-not that I'm gonna repeat it, cos' that's ... Christ. Can we change the subject or something? This is getting kinda awkward."
“I’ve got you to protect me, so I’ll be fine,” Dean reminded him, twisting his head so that he could grin across at the angel.
Well, it was more than just a little reclusive. Castiel had lived in the same location for over a decade and not once had he seen a human in this area, nor had he encountered any creature that resembled those he had to hunt. It was quite simply a haven where he could not be harmed. A safe place that belonged to him alone.
He did not need to be in this kind of mindset in the build-up to a hunt. He couldn’t afford any complications.
Castiel's fingers grazed Dean's palm before securing his grip, and Dean pulled him up ever so steadily, not wanting to rush anything. He settled his other hand on Cas's waist to offer support, trying to ignore the tight pull in his chest when a single tear rolled down Castiel's cheek.
Dean could feel that light-headed sensation return despite him now being seated, his vision blurring slightly as his eyes focussed on nothing in particular.
Castiel didn't mind waiting when he could experience Dean's kindness from a different point of view.
It was bothering him really: the knowledge that a parent would willingly cast their child out purely because of their own ignorance. Even if the choice was indeed a stupid one, that shouldn’t mean it was acceptable to abandon someone who’d held the protection of his family in his best interest the entire time.
Dean stared down at the position of Pamela’s hand on the angel, feeling a pang of unwarranted jealousy as her fingers pressed firmly into Cas’s shirt. It had him momentarily losing his focus, and he repeated Pamela’s words in his mind a few times before everything sorta clicked.
Without his shadow to aid him as much as he was used to, walking was definitely a struggle for the first couple of steps. He found himself turning his weapon into a crutch to help him stand, wincing when the steel began to curve beneath his weight. The dirt in the breeze was burning his eyes more than the brightness had before, meaning his perception of everything around him was completely off, but he managed to flit around closer to the rubble with a little bit of guesswork, distracting him from the searing pain in his legs.
He summoned a thin piece of steel to his palm; simple and small enough an item that it could easily be hidden away or brushed aside without much thought. Dean didn't want anything too obvious on his person when he headed back in, and he looked up to Castiel, outstretching his hand. "I kinda need your number again."
Well, at least it was clear now as to why such a young boy was getting involved in these sort of matters. Demons were like that: pushy and controlling, believing their ideals to be correct over someone of lower status’.
"Ummmm, I dunno," the boy replied, and Castiel could sense Dean's movements behind him, subtle vibrations carrying through the shadow. “Are you hungry?”
“Do not leave me alone in this fucking room!” He snapped, flinching as Dean’s fingers gently raised the wet fabric of his shirt, drawing it higher to apply a dressing. “What the hell am I supposed to do if you walk right into a devil’s trap while you’re down there?! I won’t be able to get out of this house by myself, Dean, I can barely fucking move!”
Dean stilled, sucking in a breath as he listened to the gentle noises of Castiel pottering about behind him. He’d known he was risking a lot by protecting Cas, and with his dad showing up three days early, the plan he’d been formulating was
Castiel wasn't really sure how to react, running over all kinds of lore in his mind to try and understand what Dean was referring to. He knew that angels had a vast amount of powers at their disposal but he was still figuring his own abilities out at the moment and it wasn't like he could easily read up on the topic should he like to know more than just the basics.
God, the more Dean thought about all his shitty feelings, the more he thought there must be some sort of charm involved. As it was, he couldn't get Cas off his damn mind, and now that he knew somewhere in the near future he'd get to see the angel again, his stomach was doing flips.
inept though. There were dozens of recipe books dotted around the kitchen and his lack of experience didn't hinder him too much. If anything he found it all a bit exciting, even if some things didn't always turn out 100% edible.
“So you’d never met an angel before me?” He asked, leaning back on his palms as he looked up to the ceiling once more, figuring that he could stay that way until the demon actually bothered to continue cleaning his wound for him. “Bet I gave a great first impression of my race.”
There was something oddly charming about the way he looked, and it had Castiel biting down on the inside of his cheeks to repress the smile that pulled at his lips in return, glancing out the window. He didn’t need to look twice to notice the delight in the demon’s eyes from garnering such a reaction, so he pointedly avoided eye contact, running his thumb over the back of his left wrist as he tried to ignore the nervous heat that twisted in his stomach.
He struggled around on the cold, concrete floor of the lower level, no matter how much the pain increased, hooking his wrists around his ankles from behind until they were pulled before him, and he tugged at the thin chain separating the cuffs harshly. The metal pinched his skin and he cried out, trying again after rotating his wrists a little; trying to apply pressure to a different location. He knew deep down that there was no way he was breaking free of these without his Grace, or the child, and that burning returned to his eyes again, sinuses feeling tight and uncomfortable.
There was another brief pause in the conversation as Jo seemed to mull this idea over, giving Dean the opportunity to really look at her.
He looked back over his shoulder, taking in the slightly red eyes and flushed cheeks, even if it didn’t particularly faze him. He’d seen children in hysterics over what they’d witnessed, and a boy his age – especially a hunter – should know by now that crying in front of an enemy was a more prominent display of weakness, hence the frequent manipulation demonstrated by the younger hunters out on the field, making such a weakness a tactic instead.
He let his mind wander for the three-hour drive that followed, surprised that the vehicle he was steering had a significant amount of fuel – enough to do the journey two times over - but obviously, he still required gas for the drive as close to his home as he could reach on the road, so he took the shortest routes possible, conserving the energy so he wouldn’t have to walk as far later.
Castiel looked at Dean. "And he's been given no diagnosis whatsoever? Not even a hint as to what's wrong?"
"Alright," the angel muttered to himself, reaching out a hand to catch it in his palm as it fell from its held place above the sink, before walking back over to Dean and offering it for him to take. Dean picked it up gingerly, attempting to ignore the harsh burn as the ice stuck to his skin, rotating it between his fingers.
Might be a bit of a delay with next week's chapter too because I've got graduation next weekend so I'll be making the most of my time in bournemouth before I head home forever ;_;
"I woke up about two hours ago," Castiel informed him. "Getting back to sleep has always been difficult."
“Look, I know you hate me, but is there anywhere else I can take you if you’re not comfortable with that? I don’t want to go through all this and then have you bump into my dad on the way back,” the demon persisted. “He knows what you look like, and your glowing thing isn’t exactly subtle to us – to any demon, I mean. Do you really want to risk any of them hurting you?”
now, he was more than a little surprised that Castiel's attitude toward him seemed pretty much exactly the same. Maybe it was because Dean's own dad had never been able to let go of a grudge, but it just seemed so surreal to him that someone could even be that generous, and whilst he knew deep down that Castiel wouldn't suddenly turn on him for something like this, it still worried him.
. Castiel couldn’t exactly shove him over as a wake up call like he would if it was any other demon – not that he’d ever had the opportunity to do so, knowing that if he ever attempted something of the sort it’d most likely end poorly for him – and he didn’t particularly want to cause the boy any more harm as it was, regardless of how humorous it would be to do so in this instance.
"Great," the demon chirped, laying a hand on Castiel's bicep. Castiel was about to ask why the child had been staring in the first place if it wasn't out of recognition when the boy called out to the man in greeting, waiting until the man had turned to look at them before the colours were blurring and they were suddenly back in the cabin.
Bobby was still in that same seat when Dean made his way downstairs, and considering Dean had been keeping to himself for a few hours since last going near the kitchen, he was surprised that the older man hadn't gone off to do something else. Even now Bobby didn't have a book or anything in front of him, only a cup of what Dean could only assume was coffee, so it only made Dean feel guiltier about not coming through to talk to him earlier.
Hell, their shadows couldn't even link with their dad in the way, and Dean wanted nothing more at that moment to keep Sam comforted - to promise him that everything was gonna be fine.
“So this is Castiel,” Pamela said with a smile, angling her head to the side as she walked round to the front of the couch to get a better look. “This is not how I imagined him to look at all,” she added with a laugh, but it sounded strained and Dean could tell that she was nervous. It made him feel a little more at ease to recognise the fluctuation in her tone, and he felt a slight surge in his confidence, prompting him to interrogate her a bit.
Dean definitely wanted to make the most of these next few minutes before Bobby or Rufus started up the man-hunt.
He knew full well that moving his traps to a less obvious location would help better his chances, but he didn't really need to busy himself with that right now. Perhaps later in the week, after he'd fed himself properly and rested enough to summon the energy for such a laborious task.
into this room! Did you not once stop and think about how fucking stupid it was of you to let it near your own fucking
Dean knew his face was red but he didn't give a damn, because Sam had promised not to tell dad about anything that had happened and Dean didn't know how long it'd be before he saw the kid again, so what the hell? May as well talk about it if it was gonna keep Sam laughing for a bit longer.
Castiel attempted to snap out of this state he was in, pressing down with the blade to create a longer incision, if not a little shallow.
again ..." Dean trailed off, looking down to his feet because he didn't want to see what kind of weird stares Cas would give him in return.
He could hear the conversation above him, muffled through the thin wood of the floorboards, and he walked up the steps slowly, gently pushing on the hatch once he reached the top so not to alert the boy to his whereabouts.
The inside of the shack was as dusty as it always was, paintings hanging crookedly on the walls with cobwebs almost pinning them in place, drawn over the frames like delicate pieces of string, keeping the position of each hideously painted image held at a jaunted angle.
"My brother has a lot of those. Dad made me get him a bunch of sleeping pills," the boy said, shrugging. Castiel could feel the doubt drown his thoughts at the mention of the child’s brother, somewhat intrigued by the knowledge in a way that also made him slightly anxious. He hadn’t actually considered it prior: what the demon’s brother looked like. As siblings, they were bound to share similar characteristics, and although there was also a possibility this theory was just as bizarre as the few Castiel had come up with before, he knew that there was a chance this ‘Sam’ would share the same unnatural eye colour as the demon before him possessed. It wasn’t too ridiculous a thought, even if the nightmares of someone else had no relevance whatsoever.
Dean understood the angel’s reluctance to talk about it. He didn’t particularly want to hear about the kind of twisted things that kept Cas up at night, but he still found himself asking anyway, wondering if maybe the guy would open up a bit more for once.
he didn't feel the way he did. It was distracting, and although he embraced most thoughts to keep his mind occupied throughout the day whilst he trained, this one simply made him want to forget everything altogether.
Still, despite that horrific fucking thought, Dean felt himself overcome with relief when the older man voiced a simple 'yeah, go ahead'. He didn't even care that the call was terminated immediately after, sat at the table in a daze for a good few minutes just trying to mentally prepare himself for the encounter later on.
to act that way, but mostly their words were shaped by humour and myths that Castiel had undoubtedly preferred.
He altered his train of thought, like he did most times the topic of change arose, turning to head back into the cavern. Even though he knew sleep wouldn't come to him for several hours, he still longed to try, knowing that it was better than staring at a few select objects until the natural light chased after the sun. Of course, he had methods of providing himself with light whenever he wished, but he wanted to conserve energy right now, not waste it on pointless moments that would only keep him conscious longer.
sorted everything out," Castiel murmured, slightly discomforted with how close the demon was to him.
But it was Pamela's voice that cut through the silence next, and Dean transported himself to the psychic’s side when she abruptly drew her hand back from Castiel’s form, her elbow almost catching Dean in the ribs. He swayed slightly from getting so abruptly to his feet once more, blinking a few times as he regained his balance.
He had avoided touch altogether since he’d brought them both back from the hunt - even through Cas’s clothing. For a start, there wasn’t really any need to handle the guy because Castiel’s only movement was caused by his breathing; but also, even with the ring in place, Dean wasn’t sure how protected he was. Not whilst Castiel had no control.
But what else was there? There were so many things fighting against him – making his survival more and more difficult.
Dean wasn't an idiot. He knew what was gonna happen. Bobby wasn't just gonna let this lie, even if Dean had spun a vague story earlier. John was bound to have said something that put Dean in a bad light - even though Dean would gladly admit that he'd been an asshole to his dad, and he probably deserved to be put in this kind of awkward position - but still. He did it all to keep his family safe. Surely he deserved at least a little credit for keeping them all from being executed.
"Be careful," Castiel chided, and Dean smiled apologetically, looking down to his feet when Castiel began to stare. He shouldn't have been getting so flustered - not when it'd probably only induce further embarrassment - but he didn't know how to act around the guy; now more than ever. Cas didn't really seem to give a fuck about anything anymore, and it was kinda confusing given how touchy Cas had been only the day before.
There were also still a few of Castiel’s belongings about the motel room that the angel had left out days ago, so Dean went about placing everything in Castiel’s duffel, stalling only when something slipped from the pages of one of Castiel’s books.
Bobby had been pretty lenient about it all. Well, more lenient than if it had been John in his place. John wouldn't have helped, nor would he have let either Sam or Dean head back in the house without making them sort out the problem first.
The situation Castiel was in now was probably worse than Dean's. He doubted that Cas would be able to find work soon enough to be able to afford a few more weeks worth of supplies, and Dean didn't see any problems in helping the guy out whilst he had the chance.
The shot sounded in the air and Castiel simply stood still, watching as the bullet was suspended amidst a black mass whilst the demon wrestled the gun from the man’s hands with the rest of his shadow, gathering up some towels from the floor as it flared across the wooden boards.
Whilst it probably made more sense to stay at the motel for the time being solely so Castiel wasn’t impacted by any kind of warding at all, Dean wasn’t dealing too well with being by himself after such a long time. He knew he was bound to have another argument with Bobby and Rufus by the time he showed up at the house, but he didn’t even care.
Castiel glanced at the boy for a moment. "No. I eat whatever strengthens my Grace," he stated, turning his attention to the hand still resting on his arm. "Now please may you help me find the things I'm looking for?"
It was pathetic, actually, coming away as nothing more than a graze. Harmless, unless infection set in.
the character from his night terrors, whether or not the child would also share the same bizarre dream, if not in a different perspective.
Castiel hid his hands beneath the table before recalling that the injuries on his fingers had long since vanished, unable to dispel his unease.
And maybe there'd be a little bit of info on demons too. Not that that was a priority or anything. Dean actually hoped he didn't find anything that could potentially make him hate what he was more than he already did.
He was at Castiel’s side instantly, clenching his jaw in pain as he knelt down amidst the mess to check Cas’s pulse.
Castiel finished with a few sharp stabs to the creature's stomach, the strigoi reining its neck in abruptly to swing round in an attempt to catch Cas’s head in its jaws, but the angel was faster. One single punch to the beasts elongated throat had it cracking back, it’s every action coming to a halt.
It didn't surprise him to know a Daeva had reported the kill back to Crowley already, but it was rare for the demon to contact him in such a way directly after, especially when the message had clearly come through ahead of the task actually being fulfilled. Castiel didn’t know if that was something he should question or not, but it made him feel relatively uncomfortable regarding just how he was being monitored. It wasn’t often that he was trusted this much to complete a job without that same shadowy observation documenting his every move.
spanish dean dragged me out of my writer's block by my hair and had me writing 5000 words this evening
But Castiel didn’t want to dwell on that too much. He hadn’t seen enough of that form of storytelling to really develop a fair opinion.
He pursed his lips, coiling his shadow round his ankles to keep track of its movements, grateful that he’d been able to catch it before it had spread further across the room.
exactly?” Dean pressed, leaning in. There was a pause as Dean’s eyes seemed to scan his face. “Sorry, I don’t mean to be rude or anything. It’s just
Castiel didn't exactly feel comfortable talking about it, more so when he took into consideration the fact that he still wasn't certain as to what it was he was seeing in these dreams. Talking to a potential cause could have its benefits though, and Castiel was beginning to wonder, if by some coincidence before him
The angel went stiff, and Dean trailed his fingers along the inner part of Cas's forearm, turning it over to examine the rest of the wound.
He looked around his surroundings desperately – for anything he could use to eliminate the flames. He could coax one of the beams down – have it break a pathway for a few seconds so he could get past.
It had been a little over 2 weeks since Dean had 'moved in' and he was still tiptoeing around certain subjects, having understood that there was still a shit-ton of tension between them. He tried to be as upbeat as possible though. The evenings were definitely easier in terms of conversation, and usually, by that point, Bobby was sorta tired - especially after dinner - so Dean had found it best to save teasing til he'd cooked for the older man and done all the washing up.
The doors slid shut and all that could be heard on the other side was an assortment of loud noises accompanied by a multitude of slurs that Castiel pretended he couldn’t hear, but he was feeling more and more claustrophobic. Most of his this new discomfort stemmed from the fact that Castiel didn't recognise the hunter, but they were undoubtedly human. The fact that they'd picked up on Castiel being another species either gave the impression that Dean had discussed this idea with them, or they recognised him through other means.
The demon continued to laugh, propping himself up on his hand so he could mimic Castiel's arrangement.
This wasn’t Crowley’s official house of business, but that wasn’t somewhere he really wanted to visit either. The older hunters gathered there – the ones that used to hunt his kin before it was banned by those in higher power. Castiel wasn’t scared of them as such, but he didn’t feel comfortable surrounded by those with the desire to drain him of his blood like a nest of vampires. Not when the stares he received were that of pure hatred and distrust.
He closed the hatch when he reached the landing so Cas wouldn't be able to listen in on the conversation, before dialling his dad's number. It took a few rings before John actually answered, but Dean was used to it. He knew his dad had a lot to deal with at the moment, so he wasn't really surprised to hear the curt
And he knew that it would be yet another pointless thing he and Dean would argue about when it finally came to them trying to sleep.
Dean didn’t know what expression he wore on his own face, but judging from Cas’s reaction it wasn’t good.
The demon dropped the items in his hold on the kitchen island, leaning against the smooth wood as he continued to laugh, and Castiel lifted the basket onto the surface beside it, folding his arms over the counter to rest his chin atop them, smiling.
Castiel’s head reeled and he grasped at Dean’s stained shirt to steady himself, looking up and around him hurriedly to scout out the potential dangers within the room.
This child was becoming more and more difficult to understand; his personality seemed to alter too often and Castiel was finding him to be a rather frustrating case. One moment the boy was rubbing his face in the dirt, the next he was attempting comfort.
It was warm in the room, the air conditioning clearly faulty, but it was nice in general. Bright, moreover. Castiel hadn't set foot in a motel like this in years. He'd rarely relied upon them - only when a hunt was too far away for him to have enough energy for his flight home. He didn't particularly like spending money on things he didn't need, but he felt more uncomfortable now at the reminder that
was wrong, regardless of their youth and ignorance, and he should have learnt after working for Crowley that they were all absolute fucking liars.
Dean blinked, confused. "How would you know if it's for me if it doesn't affect you? I can't feel anything."
Dean went on to murmur something before Sam's eyes met Castiel's and the kid was grinning, raising his hand in a wave and letting out a shy 'hi'.
more energy and experience before he went practising anything of the sort out on a hunt. Sure, it might be another example of manipulating material, but if something were to go wrong, Castiel could find himself caught mid-travel by a wall or an inanimate object and his life would end right there and then.
There was an almost exasperated exhale on the other end of the line before the older man spoke up. “Yeah, I know.”
His Grace had staunched the bleeding, but it hadn’t dulled the pain, and every so often, Castiel would feel it throb, a trickle of blood seeping from the wound and making the remains of his shirt stick to his skin, the scent of blood burning his nostrils as he tried to divert his thoughts.
“When’s your birthday then, Dean?” He queried, slowly lowering himself again til their eyes were level and Castiel was able to rest his head on the pillow once more. Dean seemed to remain frozen whilst Castiel tried to make himself comfortable, his voice slightly hoarse when he gave his reply.
Obviously, Castiel hunted, but the creatures he killed had been murdering mindlessly, not for some fallacy. They were out of control - a danger to the population - and angels were not. Angels did not harm humans, so in return, they should be treated just as well as demons were.
"Where I told you to drop me off," Castiel murmured, taking the basket by the handles. "I'll pick it up later."
of time. John would have to drive, and that alone had taken him four hours to get to the cabin the last time.
“Okay. Go and sit down, and I’ll finish what I started,” Castiel muttered, pushing him back in the direction of the main room. “Go on.”
He chose to ignore it, knowing that it would seal shut in his sleep given that his energy would be focused on the injury for the entirety of his dreams. It might make him marginally weaker the following morning, but at least he would be safe from infection and further hurt.
That resulted in Dean acting in the place of the pillows, an arm wound around Sam's shoulders as he joked about how pathetic the younger boy looked.
He didn't have it in him to blame his mom for his messed up childhood. After all, Dean knew that she'd probably gone through the exact same shit when she was his age, and he kind of respected the fact that she'd tried and separate hunting from normal family activities for him and Sam when they were younger. Gave Dean those normal moments that he craved so much these days.
"Who in their right mind would hunt dressed like that?" Castiel questioned, opening the comic before sitting down on the edge of the bed. "Wearing a coat to a fight is pretty damn impractical."
Dean pursed his lips in mock irritation, pulling Castiel close to him for a few moments as a couple attempted to walk past. "That does disappoint me," he teased, pushing Cas away lightly when the aisle was empty again. "
much blood had already been lost from that wound on his back, and if that was what was making him fall unconscious as quickly as that then Dean needed to sort it out as fast as he could. It was one thing collecting blood, but it was another to just let Cas bleed out when that wasn’t even the intention anymore.
He looked to the mirror as he wiped the blood from his chin, scowling at the blatant discolouration of his facial features. He was surprised that the sickness had already had such a profound effect on his form when he'd been tackling it for no longer than ten minutes.
And obviously, he still had the power of his Grace, no matter how weak it was. It would help a little, and although he would require his strength to fly home afterwards, his safety was far more important than using the quickest method to return home.
"I don't want to get into that right now," Bobby grunted, followed by the gentle clatter of his cutlery being laid down on his plate. "I been lied to too much today to know who's tellin' the truth or not."
He was surprised the demon hadn't persisted with questions on his powers, given how interested he'd been before, but Castiel didn't mind either way. The only other reason he would have wanted to discuss powers would be to find out some of the demon's own. It was more common for a demon to have no ability than anything at all, and already Castiel had seen two different powers being demonstrated by the child. The creation or summoning of objects - whatever it was that had allowed the boy to put both handcuffs and a collar on Castiel in the first place - was an
Or even just before they parted ways today because future conversations weren't exactly a guarantee - and Castiel had offered for Dean's benefit, not for his own.
Bobby wasn't like that. Bobby had never believed that they should have to hunt unless they wanted to. He'd never straight out said that to John's face, but he used to mention it quietly when Dean helped make dinner.
pop-culture related, and whilst Dean kinda understood the whole not-being-able-to-afford-cable and shit with the hunting life, he'd found it ridiculously funny that the angel hadn't even used the internet before.
If he came back into the room anyway. He'd kept to the kitchen, a dark expression on his face as he observed the unmoving angel from the kitchen table, toying with the blade in his hand.
“I’d prefer to talk to you, if I’m being honest,” Castiel said with a smile, before hiding his expression behind his arms. “But if you’d like to watch television, I won’t complain.”
"Back to the forest then?" Dean asked, and Castiel smiled softly, resting all his weight against Dean's side.
Of course, Castiel meant no disrespect by that, and he hoped Dean knew as much. He'd made sure to state his reasons in the least inoffensive way possible several times now.
He didn’t care if the child was a demon. No one should be kicked out of their home for making a sensible decision – especially when they were so damn young!
"I'm assuming you didn't see anything bad?" Castiel followed up curiously, his heart pounding in his chest no matter how much he tried to relax. It bothered him to think that this child could see what he couldn't - more so at the thought of the few choices he had at his disposal.
The demon kept quiet, and Castiel got on with aiding himself. He cut the bandage so it could be secured and tied against his waist, twisting it in with the tightly wound material so it would be easy to remove later, before throwing the scissors and excess bandage back in the box, sitting back and frowning down at his hands. He didn't have a clue what he was doing anymore, unsure of how to proceed around the child. The boy seemed friendly enough, even if he was somewhat clingy and utterly irritating, and Castiel still didn't know why the demon was choosing to treat him so fairly when he could have quite easily kept him locked down in the basement until he was needed. Obviously he was aware that the child seemed to have some issues with being alone, otherwise he wouldn't be calling upon Castiel for company, but he hadn't ever thought a demon would
He sat in the nearest corner with his knees drawn up to his chest, taking in deep breaths as he watched people chatter and walk by. He let his shadow splay out loosely from his feet as he rested his forehead to his kneecaps, just in case someone came too close.
The only real perk was that Dean was already used to working with others. It wouldn’t take too much to get used to Castiel’s orders.
Castiel wasn't ready to give up what was essentially meant to be the norm for himself after so long.
So, if the story were true, did that mean they’d been posing in someone’s house? That they'd killed a family and taken their place?
“I get that you’re pissed at me, and you have every right to be, but I need you to cooperate with me here.”
However, just as he was about to take care of the vampires in the basement, he found himself stalling, his shadow brushing something that was just …
I had to say." Dean tore at the material, ripping the rough fabric to distract himself. "But he told me if I didn't do what he asked, I can't go home, so uhh ..." He forced a laugh, feeling the burn in his nostrils. "Guess I'm not going home."
Did that count? Obviously, Cas had also mentioned about other demons treating him like shit, so wouldn't a charm work on them to prevent that too?
It was unusual for the money to simply be there without Crowley to hand it to him, but that was most likely what the note was there for – to tell him that he had other business to attend to or something of that nature.
? I mean, I feel like shit now, but I won’t in a couple of days,” Castiel insisted, squirming a little as he got comfortable, and Dean threw a leg out to the side to keep him stable, glancing over to Sam who’d been staring at them from the bed opposite the doorway.
to happen, Sam would see it in a premonition first so that dad could be prepared for it. Not that demons could really do all that much against angels, apparently.
A distorted form of laughter caught in Dean’s throat when he was finally able to acknowledge the abrupt change in Rufus’s demeanour, having not expected the man to actually be against the method of torture at all.
“There are lots of reasons,” the demon said softly before he was wiping around the injury again, not saying anything more.
But it also reminded him that he couldn't keep doing this. Castiel was a person, not a tool. Dean wasn't being very fair to him, and he'd done a pretty shit job at showing his gratitude so far.
He looked about the room distractedly, trying to fixate his attention elsewhere so not to agitate Dean again. It was difficult though. The room had very little decoration, and it had the bare minimum in terms of furniture. Other than the basics, the only stand-out features were the blood stains on the wall, and Castiel wasn’t even sure they would be able to rid the place of those before departing. The sigils had sat there for too long, and even if they were to attempt to scrub away at them now, there would likely still be unsightly marks smeared across the wallpaper.
It wasn't all that drastic. He was used to using a fake name when he took on certain cases, but given recent events, he wanted to stay off the radar for a while.
Castiel looked down at his hands when the creaking stopped, aware that the boy would be visiting him in mere seconds. The footsteps echoed around him, making his blood pound in his ears and his heart rate quicken.
So Dean left it alone. But only for another few hours. Annoyingly, his thoughts continued to encircle the topic whilst he reread the same few passages in his latest choice of bestiary, unable to really concentrate when he thought about how long those same bandages would have actually sat against Castiel’s wound. If the angel
He didn’t want to move. He had everything he needed right where he’d situated himself, and it would be a bother to transport it all elsewhere. And besides, he liked its secluded location. He didn’t receive company, and he didn’t desire it. It was a perfect area for him to house himself.
Castiel pushed away abruptly, shoving harshly at Dean's shoulder as he got to his feet, stumbling a little as the deal repelled him. "My eyes are fine."
Dean looked across at Bobby bitterly, but he kept his mouth shut. There wasn’t much point in arguing back. Not if he was going to continually mocked for not knowing every single thing about Castiel’s life.
It was weird really. Considering how often Dean and Sam had hung around at Bobby's over the years, Dean was still kind of on edge about the whole arrangement. Like, John could literally turn up any day now for a casual visit, or to drop Sam off for a few days, and it could ruin everything Dean had going on. Obviously, Dean had known from the beginning that this living situation was temporary, and he didn't want to overcomplicate things by sticking around longer than necessary, but he still hadn't really thought about his backup plan that much and it kind of scared him even thinking about it now.
But he didn’t exactly want to go passing comments because Cas seemed to be going through some kind of mood swing and had started being a grumpy asshole all over again, so Dean simply sat down a short distance away on the same beam, watching for any kind of change in the angel’s appearance – hopefully, a positive one. He’d liked how
He couldn’t help but smirk when the boy fell silent, running his eyes over each shaded sketch for the second time. He wasn’t an idiot. This copy clearly hadn’t ever been read before, and with the boy’s abilities, he wasn’t really surprised that the child stole things. That wasn’t to say he
He shouldn’t have done that. He shouldn’t have been in a hunter’s home. There were blatant reasons why there was warding up in the first place, and Castiel had no right to just head on in regardless, even if it had been beneficial to Dean. The fact that he'd encountered a conscious hunter whilst in the home only made things worse. If they knew who he was, word would likely spread quickly.
same damage, he …” she trailed off, apparently growing flustered. “This is from Sam’s body. The angel’s energy is bright enough that something as malignant as this is pretty fucking stark in contrast. I can see it all.”
Castiel scowled. It didn't matter how Dean meant it. If Castiel stopped concentrating for even a minute, it was entirely possible that the internal bleeding could kill him. His body was trying to combat the limits applied to his Grace, shreds of his life energy slowly knitting the edges of torn flesh back together. It was exhausting, a light sweat breaking out on his forehead as he tried to focus specifically where the wounds were deepest.
Castiel rubbed at his jaw anxiously as he took a few steps back, feeling a little bit lost now that Dean was occupied with something else. He didn’t particularly want to distract the demon, but he’d never been a fan of watching television either; seemingly unable to ever immerse himself in the fiction that played across the channels.
Castiel’s eyes reopened at this, alarm reading all over his face, and yet he didn’t move, simply looking to the smaller metallic bracelet on his arm. Dean hadn’t connected it to anything, but he’d be able to stop the guy if he tried to leave the basement, and it meant Cas would be able to heal himself properly.
Unsurprisingly, Cas shook his head. "No, it's okay." He looked to Dean with the faintest trace of a smile on his face. "Plus, you're wounded too. For the time being, I can't aid you, but if you clean it up properly I can take care of it tomorrow morning."
"I would have still answered your call, moron," Castiel insisted, pushing the hair from his forehead. "But why aren't
Dean didn't even really understand how a demon could utilise an angel's Grace though. His kind certainly wouldn't be able to physically handle it without burning to ash. Even contact with Castiel's skin had made Dean feel weird, and that would be nothing compared to actually
“I’m too comfortable to go get my phone to check,” Castiel said, nudging Dean with his elbow. “You can get it.”
He’d not been able to find much on angels whilst he’d researched, but there was a lot of shit on the internet relating to something called Meridians with humans which had sounded like it could be useful given that, like, Castiel practically radiated energy, and there were certain practices out there that could regulate energy flow. If Castiel had still been glowing, Dean probably wouldn’t have bothered looking into it at all, but he’d found it alarming that Castiel was radiating so much heat whilst his light had dulled completely.
time my dad’ll be leaving, but I was gonna speak to my brother and ask him to phone or something when he does,” the boy stated, running a hand down his face shakily, closing his eyes. “I-I mean, I know it’s pretty shit of me to not know, but it’ll be fine. I won’t let him hurt you if he does show up.”
He coaxed the light to dim even more once he reached the first floor again, attempting to adjust his eyes to the darkness so he wouldn’t have to rely on his power any longer, placing the water bottles on a counter in the kitchen before going back over to where the boy lay on the beam.
“Is that seriously what you’ve been thinking about?” Castiel interrupted, trying to contain his laughter. “Do you not think I’d have said something earlier in the cabin if I had an issue with you sitting beside me?”
Angels could do something similar, but only when they had enough power to make their forms travel through walls and the like ... and if they'd been taught how to master such an ability. It was the main reason as to why Castiel hadn't abandoned the demon as such
But he’d done a pretty good job of setting things up. He’d gone out of his way to place Castiel across the cushions in the same manner Bobby had been lain days ago, solely to remind the two older men of Cas’s selfless gesture. The fact that the bloodstains still hadn’t been washed out of the couch definitely helped, and Castiel’s skin was stark against the colour of both the comforter and the cushions, emphasising just how unwell he appeared.
Fuck it. Maybe he was charmed. Who gave a shit. Dean felt fucking elated simply standing a foot away and the feeling itself made up for just how shitty the past week had been for him.
He was glad he'd bathed before the rain had started, given that he'd been training for most of the morning and had sensed the weather change. The last few times he'd washed during a storm it had been more of a struggle than anything else, and it was perhaps the only reason why Castiel hoped this one wouldn't last too long at all. He was doing his best to develop a routine that would motivate him to keep up his current habits, and the rain - as much as he loved it - could complicate things for a few days.
“There’s no point me taking the bed when I only ever sleep for a few hours,” Castiel continued, feeling the touch of Dean’s shadow on his left ankle. “Please don’t fight me on this.”
Which led Dean to believe that he’d got the second sigil correct, not that Castiel would likely say as much.
But the whole photo had kinda taken him by surprise. Like seeing Castiel's parents, for instance. Dean admittedly hadn’t given much thought to what they’d look like physically as Cas hadn’t exactly given him much to go on in the past, but their eyes again were the most obvious features that Dean honed in on. He could remember Castiel's descriptions, and it still absolutely baffled him to see such vibrancies in Cas's father's eyes. The gold tone wasn’t quite as light as Dean had expected them to be, but that may have just been down to the quality of the photo to begin with. The edges of the image had been worn by perpetual touch and the picture was slightly sun-bleached in the lower-left corner, yet considering the fact that Castiel was carrying it round in some tattered form of bestiary - the pages spilling away from the spine - it was still in pretty good condition.
