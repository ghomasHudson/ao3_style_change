”Tony–” Steve throws one of his new shields at a sniper on a nearby building, “it’s not–” he catches it returning, “a good time–” he whirls the choking criminal towards Wanda who’s ready to float them into the back of a van, “just now!” and goes for the two thugs creepin up on T’Challa from the ruins of a building.
“Had one just last night and I haven’t been able to concentrate all day,” Tony continues, his words making Steve clasp the phone even tighter in his hand. “You came up behind me at the Tower, pushed me against the cool window, your hot firm body pressing against my back. God you had me hard so fast, my cock trapped aching in my jeans. You held my wrists behind my back, with just one big fist, the other grabbing my hair tight. And I just thought fuck all, fuck everyone who could see us, I just wanted to touch you and grind against your cock. But you held me locked, your hot breaths against my ear, telling me to beg for it, making me tell you how I needed you.”
”I was telling Bucky…” Steve trails off awkwardly, as he realizes it might not be the best thing to tell if he wants Tony to keep calling him, which
”Yeah?” he whispers, almost shy, and hides his head into his pillow, cause there’s nobody there to see him do it and even for all the danger in his life he doesn’t know if he’s ever felt this vulnerable.
Relieved, Steve slumps back down on the bed. ”I don’t get you,” he sighs. ”How is it that you can in a few weeks time go from I’ll kill you, straight to–”
“You sound out of breath,” Tony continues, unperturbed. “You know, answering a call during sex is considered rude. Or so I’ve been told.”
On the other side of the table, Bucky chokes on his beer. He stands up heaving and coughing and Steve raises his hand offering to give Bucky’s back a helping pat, but his friend shakes his head frantically and still coughing fleas out of the hut.
“Is that a thing?” Steve forgets his bashfulness, blown away once again by this century's straightforward ways. “Wait! Wait, I don’t wanna hear about it.”
The ridiculously tiny flip phone is staring at him from his bedside table. It might just as well be Tony perching there smirking at him, so uneasy Steve feels, wondering what on earth the earlier call had been about.
in ice for 70 years,” Steve points out, though it isn’t really the reason. He’s just never been into doing it with someone he doesn’t care about.
”You didn’t answer my question,” Tony talks over him in his usual obnoxious manner, which he always gets away with cause he’s Tony and that’s just how everyone expects him to behave.
, and the man he’s fighting gives him a disgusted look. Steve gives him a good old bunch in the gut. The phone slips from his hand and he dives after it, catching it just in time before it would crash into the pavement, but also flipping it closed in the process.
”Yeah,” he says, cause this is what he can do for now. ”Wanna push you down and press into you. Wanna feel you and kiss your stupid mouth. I wanna take care of you.”
”Shh, shhh, Cap. You don’t need to say anything. Just lie back and enjoy the ride.” Tony shuts him up, his voice dropping low.
They continue flirting like that for some time, the playboy billionaire and the 100 year old virgin, until sleep takes over Steve and he drifts off.
”Where are you?” Tony asks. His voice is so different, the light banter of his previous calls all gone, that Steve straightens up in his bed, alert and completely awake.
”Come on, tell me where you are and I’ll jump on the jet,” Tony tries. ”Could be there in 12 hours tops.”
Finally he decides to be an adult and calls Tony back, but there’s just a polite notification at the other end of the line informing Steve that the number can’t be reached.
“Someone broke in. Three someones broke in. I tried to run out the window but it was locked.” He shot Steve a look. “I guess someone didn’t want me to leave. Anyway. Tried to hide, got found, punched around a bit. Took them downstairs so they’d pick on someone their one size. Well. Someone several times their size as it turned out. The end.”
He contemplated going back upstairs, grabbing whatever food he could get his hands on, and then leaving this place forever. He could go and never look back.
The first thing that hit him was the utter darkness inside. It didn’t look like shadow, but like pure nothingness. Something was moving within, like water swirling in a deep lake.
The heavy hand lifted off of Tony’s neck. He felt himself slip down until his knees hit the wooden floor. The sharp pain felt distant, a numbness spreading through him from the places the Alpha’s skin had touched his.
can. I can help you find a cure. I’m trained in maths and science and engineering and pretty much any subject other than poetry. I will find something to help him. I can - ”
But the creature didn’t flinch. He hardly reacted, its empty stare still fixed on his face with all the intensity of a starved animal.
At first Tony had assumed Steve was just staying in the basement. But then one day he had worked up the courage to creep down and check. The room had been empty. The boulder firmly put in place.
The clothes looked caked in blood and dirt, but the material was still sturdy beneath it all. It didn’t look like fabric left to rot for years, so Steve must have taken better care of him in the past than he currently managed. Tony wondered how abrupt the shift had been, how violent and how quickly he had gotten in order to prompt Steve to lock him up in a basement and go prowling for homemade therapies.
The man - Steve slid down the wall and settled there, his shoulders curled in, his head a bit bowed, his hands resting on his knees. All he was missing was a cardboard sign saying I AM NOT A THREAT.
Feet were scraping frantically against the floor, while the sound of harsh breathing was intercut by Steve’s sobs.
The younger one moved towards the cloth covered table and grabbed at the dark fabric. It slid heavily towards the floor, revealing the strange shape that had caught Tony’s eye days before. Almost despite himself, he leaned over to see what was underneath, and his eye caught on a glint of silver.
, to curl up in the dark, to jerk away from the harsh hands that grabbed him and tore at him and crushed him into the damp sand. He thought he might have started crying, but he didn’t fell the wetness on his face, only the blood welling under his nails as he scratched desperately at the arm holding him still.
Tony was now sure he must have been a soldier. He reminded him vividly of the men he had seen come back from the war, their silent despair and pained stiffness.
Coming near him with a blade or scissors would be suicide. So he gently grasped the edge of the torn shirt and waited another second.
It moved towards him in a slow and measured step. Tony thought of the black panthers prowling in the night.
“She was one of the first people to get infected. Nobody knew what it was back then. She just came home one day and collapsed in my arms. I was so busy scrambling to save her and reverse engineer the strain killing her that I didn’t realise what was happening outside, how quickly it was mutating. Two weeks later she slipped away, and I woke up to a world on fire.”
“I know.” He closed his eyes and rubbed a hand through his short hair. “We’ll have to move soon. It’s unlikely they came here without telling someone where they’re going. And this place is not at full capacity so we can’t exactly bunker up in here. Besides, I don’t want to risk having to fight off a dozen Alphas while Bucky is in this state.”
Blood was dripping off of its fingers, and Tony realised numbly that it must have been its own, matching the ravaged bloody mess of its left shoulder.
Being alone was good. Being alone was safe. He had to keep telling himself that when the quiet became unbearable.
He seemed genuine. But axe murderers were supposed to seem genuine too. On the other hand, what would have stopped him from simply picking him up and carrying him away? There was no need for this long debate about the virtues of being the sex slave of one man instead of ten.
The sounds of a violent scuffle. Growls and thunder in the dark. The heavy thud of the door slamming and the screech of metal being bent.
The admission seemed to be torn out of him, and Tony began to realize how much Steve had really thought his little crazy experiment would work. Or maybe he hadn’t even
“Sometimes I feel like I never woke up. Like I’m still sleeping underneath and this is what my mind conjured up to punish me for my mistakes. Or maybe I never survived, and a consciousness above my own is, in fact, meeting out the punishment.”
As more awareness began trickling back to him, he had to start actively shying away from many of his thoughts. Fragments of darkness and cold, cave walls and moist breathing, a searing pain in his thigh. A cold blue gaze watching him like prey.
When he saw the signature at the bottom his heart lurched, but his hands remained steady. That feeling of being perched on the edge of a cliff returned as he contemplated putting it back where he found it. But, as he knew from the beginning he would, he read it instead.
Obviously, the man didn’t move an inch. Tony looked his way again and this time forced himself to maintain eye contact. He was standing between Tony and the setting sun, so his features were hard to distinguish. The huge bulk of his body was not.
He looked dazed, his eyes out of focus, having just followed sleepily while Tony tugged him up by the wrist. Now he was just standing there, swaying slowly.
After the barest second of contact, he snatched his hand away and exhaled roughly, his eyes closing.
He still remembered the one that had attacked his father many years ago. He had been too young to properly understand what he was seeing, but the image of the creature coiling and writhing on the carpet was still imprinted in his memory. Broken glass cutting its skin while it jerked with the electric current of the tasers embedded in its flesh, the blood staining the white wool as red as its hair.
The hand released his neck and grabbed both of his wrists in one swift movement, while something hit the back his knee with enough force to send him sprawling. He lost his balance, and another jerk of his captured wrists brought him down on the cold cement.
“Steve” his voice broke. “Steve, please.” To his shame, his eyes filled with tears. ”It’s not just my life you’re gambling with.”
Tony slowly backed away towards the staircase without turning his head, chasing the thin sliver of light in the corner of his eye.
But he couldn’t afford to spare another thought for Steve’s broken body, because its head moved back towards him.
He had no idea where he could possibly go. His limbs felt heavy, and his mind was too numb to properly contemplate any consequences. If he could just sit here quietly and wait for the night, maybe they wouldn’t find him, maybe he could just sleep. He wanted to sleep for a very long time.
Steve stopped walking. He turned around to face him. His face was impassive, but his gaze seemed to hold a desolate sadness.
He was breathing raggedly, his clenched fists twitching. He seemed a breath away from grabbing him by the throat.
“These will be large, but they’re clean. There’s a shower in the bathroom. The water should run hot for a bit.”
There was nothing in the bathroom. Nothing he could use. Not even a fucking razor. What the fuck did Steve even shave with?
He kept his grip incredibly gentle, and slowly wrapped his free fingers around the Alpha's wrist. When he tugged, with the same force he would have used to nudge a bird, the fingers wrapped around him released and hung limply.
Steve was completely unbothered by the smell permeating the tunnel. He kept walking slowly ahead, as if… as if he was used to it. As if he knew exactly what…
Thank you again from the bottom of my heart for all your kind comments. I can't believe people actually read this story, let alone care about it enough to leave a comment. Thank you, and please keep letting me know what you think! <3
He went for the window. But of fucking course, Steve would take care to lock it just in case Tony got any stupid ideas.
The flashlight fell to the floor and rolled towards a wall. Torn flesh and clotting blood spilled out of the darkness. The memories from earlier came back to him all at once, and bile rose sharply in his throat.
Tony kept his eyes closed for a few seconds more. He thought of his old home, the warm sheets and the subtle smell of coffee that permeated every room. He thought of Pepper.
“As off your rocker as you are, Stevie, and as much it pains me to admit it, you’re still my best bet right now. So now I think I’ll take my chances with you.”
He concentrated on the part of his mind that was never clouded by fear and cold. The thoughts that ran tireless and bright like clockwork, a solid path he could hide on when everything else cracked.
He had washed and eaten another can of beans. Steve had even magically produced a small offering of cheap chocolate, wrapped in stained aluminium foil. The sugar had helped more than anything, even if he couldn't tell the taste.
Steve nodded, then hesitated and walked further into the room to kneel down next to a perfectly indistinguishable floorboard. He lifted it up in a practised manoeuvre and rummaged around the hidden space for a second before pulling out a small bag. The floorboard slipped back in seamlessly.
Steve moved around and inspected all the covered windows, then disappeared up the stairs for a few minutes. He returned and began lighting a few candles which he carefully placed on windowsills and next to the mattress. None on the table.
Tony hadn’t made up his mind yet if the quiet was calming or ominous. He had plenty of time to contemplate the stupidity of following strange Alphas into Godforsaken underground tunnels, and then double back to the certainty that being cornered into that alley would have brought things to a head anyway.
“Listen, you can cut the protective instinct crap. You can probably smell what I am and I can definitely smell what you are. I’m not interested in a friendly afternoon chat, so you might as well leave me be. If that by any means clashes with your plan of rape and plunder, I’d rather get on with it. This place smells like shit and I’d rather not spend the night in this sewer.”
“What else are you gonna do though? Wanna bet how long it will take them to find you? It’s that or some gang. I don’t have to tell you what they do to Omegas, do I?”
His eyes shot to the man’s face and he realised with a start that he was still not watching him, his gaze lost somewhere in the middle distance.
“Don’t you fucking dare, you fucking coward! You are the one who got me into this, with your lost fucking love and your fucking misplaced ideals. And now you expect me to sit around and wait to be picked up by the nearest gang of hormone-run scavengers or hunted like a rabbit, while YOU go mope on a bridge and cry about how terrible the world is?”
“I can help you find a cure for your friend. All the people who ran all those studies before… most of the time their only goal was to understand how ferals … behaved, how they worked, how to stop them, to - to
The fabric pooled around his feet, and he was completely naked. Tony didn’t allow himself to register anything beyond the sight of a wounded and trembling body.
They would finish their plunder soon. And then they would pack everything up and drag him away with them. Drag him away to some underground layer where who knew what kind of new horrorshow was in store for him.
“I guess I envy you. You having someone like Steve by your side. He is completely batshit, mind you, but he’s here, and be will never leave you. Even if you already left.”
Pages and screens flickered in front of his eyes like roll film, the words neatly arranging in his mind.
he was. His blond hair was greasy but it had obviously been washed fairly recently. His clothes were shabby, patched and sweat stained, but they weren’t dirty. His teeth still looked healthy and white.
“I was just - cleaning up - fixing the window upstairs," Steve told the floorboards. "I’ll take the - the bodies out at sunrise. Try to get some sleep now. We’ll talk tomorrow. And - Tony - don’t - “
The silence felt soothing now. No pity or judgement, only the emptiness of his loss echoed back at him.
The stump of the shoulder immediately drew his eye. It was encased in metal, gleaming dully in the neon bathroom light. Tony stared.
He almost opened his mouth to plead, but instead he bit his tongue until he tasted blood. He had sworn never to beg them again.
The sleeve falling down from the pool of blood was empty and torn, contrasting sharply with the bulging muscle of its right arm.
He barely saw Steve after that day. He would wake up each morning before Tony, before dawn, quietly dress, press the few buttons which pulled up the shutters on the windows and walk downstairs. The metal door would open and then close. Half an hour later, twin metallic screeches would sound again.
They began rummaging through the room, turning over boxes and clearing out shelves, crashing like animals into the careful tidiness Steve so obviously preferred.
His fingers moved lower, tracing the back of a hand and then sliding underneath, their palms now pressed together. Tony curled his fingers around his larger palm, keeping his own hand underneath, a point of both support and supplication.
Hi everyone! Thousands of apologies for how long it has taken me to update this. Real life has been getting in the way, but I can promise you that this fic will never be abandoned. I have it all plotted out and hopefully, over an unknown period of time, we'll all get to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
He could imagine him at that moment as the man Steve was so determined to see him as. The man he had loved.
Steve jerked slightly at the sound and looked towards the door again. His eyes turned cold once more, the light in them dying. And taking Tony’s hope with it.
What threw him was not the words, but the calm and normalcy of his voice. As if he was asking if he’d like to go out for coffee.
Steve must have managed to wrestle it back into its cage, because the silence fell again, intercut by wet and panting breaths.
That was what his thought kept circling back to. The sheer blank panic of it, the water choking him and the sand coming back beneath his palms. He had thought he would be able to keep his head, that if he knew it was coming he could survive it again. He hated how wrong he had been.
He knew instinctively Steve didn’t mean the intruders. Anger pooled at the back of his throat and tasted like venom.
Tony looked at him and thought back to the moment he had just witnessed. He felt like he was perched on the edge of a cliff. But, almost despite himself, he took a step.
here? Do you seriously think that will work? ARE YOU THAT FUCKING NAIVE? You stupid fucking idiot. Hundreds - thousands of people have been trying to find some way of curing it and they haven’t succeeded. Ever. IN CENTURIES.”
The smell hit him next. The stench was so overpowering he nearly doubled over. The acrid smell of sweat and blood was wrapped in something far shaper, a red jagged smear of poison that screamed at him
He had to savagely strangle the urge to scream. He could feel the scream perched beneath his chin, but he couldn’t afford the noise.
“I’m Steve, by the way. Steve Rogers.” His back was no longer to the sun, and his features became more visible. He was smiling softly. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you. I keep forgetting things are different now, and you can’t just come up to people without getting stabbed or making them faint. Not that I thought you’d faint - still, it was rude of me.”
He saw Steve’s violent flinch but he didn’t wait for a reply before going into the bathroom and slamming the door behind him.
He found a piece of cloth and dunked it in the greying water, then rubbed it on the yellowish bar of soap Steve had given him. He couldn’t bring himself to properly scrub across the skin, irrationally afraid he would somehow hurt him, so he gently swiped it across his shoulder blades and torso.
It had all been gathering inside his head, the hours upon hours of fear and shock, and it was now beginning to overflow. He wasn’t sure how much more he could take, so he quickly took hold of the waist of his sweatpants and pulled them down before he had a chance to think any longer about any of this.
Before he could take another step, the man’s eyes flickered. It was the barest movement, a candle flame trembling in the wind. It was so sudden and brief that he wasn’t sure if it had actually happened. When he looked back, the man’s eyes were again on the gently sloshing water.
There was a strange quality to Steve’s voice. He sounded far away and not entirely aware Tony was even listening. He was still looking at the sunrise.
Steve had seemed more present during his little tactical speech than during the whole time Tony had known him.
He looked around. Boxes, books, blankets, clothes, their food supplies, all spread out on the wooden floor. He will have to go through them, tidy everything back into place. Build everything back up.
Then Steve came down the stairs, and Tony realised just how terrified he had been of being left alone. The relief slammed into him so forcefully his knees trembled.
Nonetheless, it felt disturbingly safe. They hadn’t figured out a new place to move to just yet and the looming threat was still ever present, but for now they were orbiting around one another in a precarious balance.
“Fucking hell! Who the fuck is this?” A lanky kid, barely done being a teenager, was hanging back near the staircase they had come down from.
He shook his head. There was still a feral Alpha standing five feet away from him, gazing vacantly at the bathroom tiles.
Tony thought of its eyes, that animalistic intensity which bled into insanity, and wondered how much time Steve had spent to convince himself that a man still existed.
He knew he wasn’t an innocent in this. He had chosen to follow this stranger in the hope he would end up in a safer place. If Steve or his pet didn’t end up killing him, the irony might.
He looked towards the basement. The flashlight Steve had used yesterday was still by the door. He obviously didn’t need it when pushing around dead bodies in pitch darkness.
Thank you so much to everyone who has given this story a chance! I'm beyond flattered that you seem interested, I can't even believe I got over 100 kudos. It's so great to receive feedback, especially since I'm just a baby writer.
Tony spared an idle thought to how incredibly clean Steve managed to keep those tiles even in the middle of a war zone.
One day he would explain about field effect transistors. Another day he would practice his French. Another day he would talk of Pepper again.
“Okay, Tony. Now listen. I promised I won’t hurt you and I’ll keep my word. I’ll take you to a safe place. There’s no need to panic.”
There was a faint rustling around him, the wind gently shifting through leaves and paper and plastic bags. He was sitting with his back to a brick wall, his body mostly hidden by the trash cluttering the alley he was taking refuge in.
He quickly scanned the room and cursed himself for his stupidity. He had been in that room for days and he had barely bothered to look around. He almost rushed to the nearest stack of boxes to look for anything useful, when the first step of the wooden staircase creaked.
Sometimes he would hear faint sobbing coming from the other side of the room, and he would crush the pillow over his ear and refuse to feel Steve’s pain.
he finds the cure for a notoriously incurable disease while letting you chew people up to your heart's desire is taking it a bit far wouldn't you say? What does he owe you that he’s willing to fuck anyone else over so that you’ll get your second chance, huh? Why do you even deserve a second chance when everyone else in this godforsaken place had to go on by themselves or be left behind? What makes
Steve turned around, his outstretched hand offering a bundle of cloth and a toothbrush. It was such an outrageously domestic image, Tony had to restrain a hysterical giggle.
He kept pacing the room. Back and forth, back and forth. For a split second after each turn back towards him, Tony could have sworn he saw Steve’s lips move soundlessly. Minutes passed before he managed to spit it out.
Thank you so much everyone for all your kind comments and support! I had no idea this story would interest so many people, and I am beyond overwhelmed!
Tony carefully opened his eyes. Steve was sitting on the bottom steps of the wooden staircase, shoulders heaving.
They kept methodically going through the room. They were obviously well versed in this. Get in, grab the goods, get out. Take the goods and lock them away so you can fuck them in peace.
He didn’t so much as twitch a muscle. His body couldn’t afford the extra energy. Only his heart jerked wildly in his chest, beating a wild staccato. He closed his eyes.
He barely said a word to Tony. Their sparse exchanges were contained to topics of survival. Food, shelter, water, security. Steve kept him updated on their resources and reassured him of their safety. Tony nodded and didn’t pretend to be reassured.
“There’s someone else here -” he managed to choke out. “What - You...” He felt his voice fading in the path of his panic so he struggled to take another breath.
“Look, the sun is setting. I can’t in good conscience just leave you here, I think it’s obvious why. I realise there’s no reason to trust me whatsoever, but I swear I won’t touch you.
He stopped a few feet away from the door and stood there, frozen, for thirty-nine breaths. When he finally spoke, the sound of his own voice made him startle.
Tony could only jerk back a few inches before a hand grabbed him by his shirt and pulled him out. He shot out a hand to claw at his brick-like face, but it was caught immediately. He could almost feel the bones of his wrist grinding together. The Alpha laughed.
“I’m not taking on more step in that direction. Are you seriously telling me it’s safe? That you know it? That it’s your pet and you’re all friendly?”
When it took its first step towards him, Tony’s knees almost gave out in the effort of standing still.
Tony heard a sharp intake of breath in the silence. Whatever came after was lost, because the weight on his lap vanished and the quiet was broken by the sound of two bodies slamming together.
He shakily got up on his feet. The lowered position suddenly seemed too vulnerable. He savagely wished for the thousandth time for the burn of alcohol to wipe away his thoughts.
Tony briefly entertained the thought of braining him with one of the heavy hardcovers lying on the floor.
Tony had to get out of there. Only someone desperate would break into a house that reeked of Alpha in broad daylight.
Thank you so much for bearing with me for what it has now been years. I am still shocked so many people actually care about whatever words I manage to scrape together. Every time I remember this story and all the people that were kind enough to read it, I am filled with joy.
“You're pathetic. I know I’ve done nothing but lie on your filthy mattress for God knows how many days, but I think I deserve some time to feel sorry for myself given my current lot in life. And I sure as hell won’t spend the rest of my days in this hellhole listening to your sob story and dealing with the shitshow in the basement while I wait to die!” He took a breath. “I’ll go wash and pull myself together after the horror show I’ve just witnessed, and when I come out you can either be here to help me figure out how we can survive, or you can go find some rope to hang yourself with. Feel free to dive into the ocean, but I won’t get dragged down with you.”
“Don’t take it as a compliment. Right now it’s between you and whichever Alpha gang lurks around. You can bet our visitors yesterday have friends nearby. Friends who will get curious about their whereabouts very soon.”
And that was the problem wasn’t it? Steve had planned this months ago now, making sure he could get reservations and the exact table they’d had and working with various people to ensure everything was absolutely perfect and exactly the same. And now, it was in a week, and he worried Tony would hate it. Bucky was right, Tony had never hated any of the dates he’d planned for them. It had quickly become apparent that Tony was not one to plan big, elaborate outings for anniversaries or birthdays - which had been absolutely fine with Steve. Tony, for all his futuristic thoughts, tended to remember a few days before and always found a way to make things special in his own way, but Steve was the planner of the couple in this instance.
Bucky smiled at the line, one he’d heard him and Tony bicker about far too often. “Nah, nothing important. Not the arm or anything, just had to ask him something.”
“Yeah, Bucky and I were really going at it. I think Bucky would have broken my nose if Natasha didn’t tell us to stop,” Steve chuckled. “Oh hey Tony darling, why are you sitting out here?”
“You two are quirky, figured you’d picked another day so you’d have extra reasons to have sex or something.”
Steve scooped him up, peppering his face with kisses before walking back to their car. Steve had gotten used to the soft ooh-ing and aah-ing from the other parents at pre-school pickup – 98% of whom were women – and the scowling glare from Norman Osborne (on the days when he showed up) as he sat in his Bentley, waiting for his driver to close the door behind his son after he made his way into the car.
“He didn’t ask that, no. He just wanted to make sure what he was planning was okay. Guess he’s gonna ask him to cancel day of? No idea. His brain works in mysterious ways sometimes.”
“Have you met Rhodey and Bucky? Of course they’d let us stew miserably for a few days for their own enjoyment. I bet you anything they talked about it while we were gone and they were in on it together. That’s probably why Bucky tried to convince me so hard that changing my plans for the movie was fine. He knew Rhodey was on it.”
He noticed Peter’s movement stutter a fraction before his son looked up at them like nothing was amiss. “No, it’s been a quiet week.”
, let me catch my breath. Oh, this is too good.” Bucky sat properly and settled down enough to explain. “Steve’s planning the same
Bucky made his way down to Tony’s workshop, ignoring yet another chirp from his phone. Steve had been relentless in poking and prodding to see if he’d spoken with Tony yet, and Bucky had decided to just ignore him. He’d get to him when he got back to him, end of story.
Steve could tolerate many things, but anyone questioning his love for Tony and Peter was not one of them.
family tree might not be related by blood, but that doesn’t mean they love you any less. Or that their impact in your life is any less.”
By the way Steve was getting ready in semi formal clothing, Tony followed his lead with his clothing choice. As they both prepared, Steve told Tony, “I’ve called Happy and said that he wouldn’t be needed tonight. I’ll drive us, ok?”
“Puppies are gweat too!” Peter proceeded to ask questions about the dog  Steve met for all of two minutes during the entirety of their 13-minute drive home.
“True, but we’ve talked about how your grandpa Howard wasn’t exactly the funnest human to be around,” Tony reminded him.
The two of them stared at each other for a moment, taking in what had just transpired. They had planned the exact same date without knowing what the other was up to, how could the odds be in their favor like that? It didn’t matter to them as long as they were together.
“Yeah, makes sense,” Bucky answered, trying to formulate how to ask Rhodey without sounding too obvious. “Hope it’s not too time consuming. I feel like Steve mentioned something about it being their anniversary this weekend?”
Tony’s hand returned to Ana’s ear. “Don’t listen to your dad either. He was clearly raised by hooligans with the mouth on him.”
Steve pulled him tighter, hand tight across his stomach. “We’ll go shopping tomorrow,” he promised with one last kiss to Tony’s shoulder before they both fell asleep.
“Hey, Barnes. What brings you down here?” Rhodey asked with a curious smile as he shook Bucky’s hand.
“Yeah, Petey Pie,” Steve answered as he set the plate of KD and wieners in front of his picky four-year-old, before grabbing his and his husband's plates of pasta carbonara and scallops.
“What are you doing, Tones?” Rhodey walked by as he saw Tony staring at the coffee table with a planner and his StarkPad.
“Well this sure is awkward isn’t it?” Tony rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly as he held his helmet in his other hand.
“Now, if you do want to find out where you came from, that is absolutely valid,” Tony added, Steve nodding along as he was going to ask if it was something they could facilitate. “We will never keep that information from you if you want to find out. Just because your birth parents died doesn’t mean there aren’t ways of finding that out, or some of it at least. The DNA portion is just a tiny part of your origin story though, I promise.”
While Tony waited for Steve to come back, he decided to get a little more sleep since he did stay up in the lab for some time after midnight.
Steve shot out of his chair and rounded the table to gather Peter into a hug, with Tony right behind him. Peter didn’t even fight them out of holding him like they were doing, as awkward as it was pilled on to the dining room chair.
So, he finally made his way to the workshop, not even bothering to confirm with their resident AI on Tony’s whereabouts. Steve wasn’t home, which meant Tony was sulking in his workshop and ignoring the world. He was a predictable man. Unfortunately, Bucky was currently a wrong man. And when he walked into the workshop, it wasn’t Tony he found there. It was the Colonel.
“Guys, FRIDAY said you need to change the subject,” Clint said as he opened the door to Tony’s room. “Tony’s vitals are all over the place. What the heck are you talking about anyways?”
“I told you. On the phone?” Bucky shook his head and Steve groaned. “We were fighting this new villain – I think Thor called her Enchantress? Anyways, she did
“Oh yeah? What do you have planned because maybe I have a few plans of my own.” Tony smiled as he reached for one of his favorites.
“True, but I like the PR line for that one better. Love at first sight, soulmates, all that jazz.” Tony waited for Steve to grab the shield from the special hidden compartment in their walk-in closet and followed him back to the living room and the elevator. “Seriously, do supervillains not need sleep? Is that a thing? Maybe I need to turn evil so I never need to sleep again and can do all the things on my to-do list.”
Tony rolled his eyes and yelled, “focus! I need you to go talk to Steve about it, see if he’s planning anything big, which if I know him, he probably wants to do something big to impress me.”
Steve wiped his hands and Tony grabbed the paper Peter was waving at them. Steve picked up his son, looking at the paper Tony was holding.
“Bucky?” He turned and saw Steve in the doorway, looking at him with a frown. “What was that about?”
“And my ma couldn’t bake for shit,” Steve smirked, “so that’s actually Bucky’s mom’s pie recipe. I got lucky that he remembered it.”
Steve gave Tony a pinched smile over Peter’s head. “Neither of us blames you, kiddo. And I’m sure your teacher would have understood if you’d explained it to her. We just wish you would have told us, instead of us wondering why your teacher called.”
“Why is no one coming,” Bucky growled. “Tony, you can’t die, I mean it. I love you. And I love Steve too. And I can’t have you die without knowing that. I’ve been too much of a coward to tell you, and-“
“Nah, Steve and Nat won’t be home ‘til late tomorrow, probably the day after realistically. But, where’s Tony? I was sure he’d be down here-”
“Same.” Steve smiles, and he feels Tony’s lips follow suit. He places a kiss where his thumb had started earlier, in the corner of Tony’s lips, and Tony’s smile creeps up a bit more and something settles in Steve’s chest. “Was worth the wait.”
“Yeah, growing up when I did, it wasn’t the same as now in the least but, being the small sick kid wasn’t always easy. And then being a walking science experiment wasn’t much easier in its own way.”
“We met the Vengers today,” Peter told his dad. Steve had finally reached the couch, after organizing Peter's bag and shoes and jacket in the entrance, and dropping his lunchbox on the counter.
Steve woke up when his alarm went off at 5:30 a.m. and looked down at Tony’s sleeping face. He stared at him in awe as he wondered how he could be so beautiful every time he saw him.
“So we get to have our whole first date, just like we both wanted,” Steve marvelled at the development.
“Come on, Cap,” Tony told him after he’d grabbed the spoon from his mouth and handed him the other one, the package of cookie dough now on the counter between them. “Live a little. This one now, those for later. Win-win.”
“Did you get the chocolate off my face at least?” he asks as the elevator doors close behind them, making Steve laugh, and double down on kissing that corner of his mouth again. Just to make sure.
The phone call had come while Bucky was in the shower. FRIDAY had had to alert him that Steve was trying to reach him several times.
“Yeah, I needed somewhere quiet to make a work call, and I wasn’t sure when Steve was coming back, so I figured this was the safest bet.”
“I love her so fucking much, Tony,” Steve sighed out fondly, managing to bend just enough to kiss her head.
“I didn’t want you thinking… I didn’t want you to hear I didn’t want to make a family tree and think it was because I was ashamed of our family,” Peter reiterated. “Wait, is this why you made all those things for dinner?”
4-year-old,” Steve grumbled. “And it wasn’t even Clint and Nat there, I asked them. They had cheap knock offs of us.”
“Nope,” Bucky answered with a broad smile, popping the p joyfully. “The only problem is, the company Steve was renting the projector from had to cancel, so now I’m supposed to figure out how to do the movie part and there’s no projectors I can rent on such short notice, so I’m worried that’ll end up fucked up.”
They spent the day in bed together, enjoying each other's company. Soon, it was time to get ready for Steve’s dinner reservation that Tony didn’t know about.
“Darling... I’m back.” Steve walked over to Tony’s sleeping form, setting the box of donuts on the side table and walking away to get a vase for the flowers. Tony opened his eyes slowly and saw the pink box set beside him.
More than half the package was gone, and they were laughing as Tony recounted his morning to Steve. And Steve couldn’t help but think how simple it was. How everything came so easy now with Tony. Now that they’d ironed out what irked them about the other, which led to them realizing that deep down they just wanted to make sure the other was safe in their own weird, convoluted way… things were so easy between them.
Natasha hummed playfully. “Looked like you were about to start writing in your diaries and braid each other’s hair.”
“There’s the real reason for it all,” Tony laughed while Steve's hand roamed to grab his ass, as if to prove a point.
Steve shrugged and let his head fall against the wall behind him. “I booked everything we did on our first date five years ago.”
As Rhodey continued to watch Tony swipe his finger across the StarkPad, he heard someone walking by. He turned his head to see Steve coming, a towel around his neck showing that he’d been working out.
“I had to sit in class and listen to everyone talk about their perfectly normal families and which family members they look like and hereditary genes. Even the other kids with gay parents are at least related to one of their parents, you know?” Peter sighed, letting his arms drop to his lap. “I’m not ashamed of you guys or sad that I’m adopted, it’s just… when we did our family trees before it was pictures on a computer slide show. Now, it’s a deep dive into my family history and it kinda hurt to not know anything about my birth parents, and its hard to explain Pops being 100 years old and not having any living relatives, even if everyone
“Tony mentioned a couple weeks ago that he thought you might. Like us, I mean. I was convinced he was seeing things, so we made a bet. We were trying to figure out a not too weird way of bringing it up – again, because I was convinced he was wrong, and I didn’t want you to feel weird about it.”
“You were,” Steve continued, lips as velvety smooth as his words against Tony’s neck. “I love watching you be a dad. Cheering her on at her class. But not like those intense dance moms from that TV show Clint was obsessed with a few years back. And those pants just accentuate your ass, and it was hard to keep my hands off.”
Rhodey narrowed his eyes at Bucky, his expression going curious and also knowing. “Being as well acquainted with those two idiots as we are, something tells me I know exactly why you were down here to talk to Tony.”
Before he knows it, his previously free hand is now pulling Tony closer by his waist, and the hand on his face has moved to curve around his head, pulling Tony into a kiss that’s both so soft and gentle, and yet filled with an urgency Steve didn’t know he was capable of. Tony let’s out a soft moan that Steve swallows eagerly, coaxing his lips open with a gentle nip of his lower lip. As their tongues meet and they start to explore as much of the other’s mouth as they can, Tony melts in Steve’s arms. His hands are on Steve’s cheeks in a matter of seconds, then they feel like they’re everywhere as they kiss and kiss for what feels like a whole lifetime: the back of his head, in his hair, scatching down his neck, his shoulders, on his hip.
superheroes. The fact that you’re asking proves our point, I think. We lost our cool a while ago, Capsicle. Now, scootch over so I can get in on sleepy Annie snuggles too.”
They waited patiently while Peter seemed to process what he had to say. Steve did feel badly about ambushing his son about school matters this way, but Tony had been right – this wasn’t at all like Peter, and they were worried.
“I was coming to the same conclusion, to tell you the truth. When you said Tony’d mentioned what day it was, it didn’t track with what Steve had told me.”
Tony rolled his eyes and put his hand on Rhodey’s shoulder. “Can I ask a favor of you? This is going to be a bigger favor than that time I asked if you could get me into that club back when we were at MIT.”
“He means well, I promise. He probably would have freaked that you were asking him questions, but not for the reason you’re thinking. He’s really worried that doing the same thing they did on their first date isn’t enough to impress Steve-”
“You were incredibly hot today, by the way,” Steve’s voice came, low and rumbly, right near his ear.
Steve could never resist those brown eyes, mischievous and playful as they were, and that smirk Tony used much too often on him now that he’d seemed to notice just how effective it was on Steve.
When Steve saw the restaurant, he noticed that the parking space he and Tony used long ago had been open, so he took the opportunity and pulled right up. When they came to a stop, Tony noticed where they were.
“I’m sure the Avengers you met had very powerful words of wisdom on avoiding bad people,” Tony chimed in with as much of a straight face as he could. “Do you remember who it was that went?”
Steve and Tony Stark-Rogers were the definition of Hashtag Couple Goals. Both absolutely stunning humans and genuinely kind and caring, they graced the covers of magazines as much for their Gala appearances as for their charity work.
Steve followed his best friend to the other side of the training area where their towels and water bottles were stashed. He tried to find a way to explain just what was going on in his mind that wouldn’t send Bucky on an eye roll streak like he so often did where Steve’s love life was concerned. They both sat side by side with their backs to the wall, Steve using extra long pulls of his water bottle to delay having to talk.
Bucky scoffed. “I thought you might say that.” He let go of Steve, who sat on the edge of Tony’s bed. “I don’t want to make this weird, okay? It was in the heat of the moment. I thought we were losing him…”
“I love the life we’ve built too, honey,” he whispered in Steve’s ear, earning himself a kiss on the cheek.
Steve grumbled playfully as he rolled off Tony and made his way to close their bedroom door, stripping out of his remaining clothes on the way back. Tony did the same on the bed, wriggling out of his briefs and sitting up to pull his shirt off, Steve helping to pull it off and throw it with his own discarded clothes on the ground. Arms wrapped around the other and legs tangling, Steve lowered them both to their previous horizontal position, their lips finding each other easily once more.
Tony finally manages to extricate himself from Steve’s grip, still holding his hand, and pulls him towards the elevator.
“Exactly.” Tony squeezed Peter’s knee and kissed his hair. “I know it’s not the same, since we did know our parents, and we aren’t trying to dismiss your feelings. I don’t want you to think that. Just want you to remember that the people in
earlier,” Steve remembered, sitting at Tony's feet, propping them on his lap and rubbing his ankles and legs. “You didn’t say you met the Avengers.”
Steve just puckered his lips for a kiss, which Tony easily gave him through a broad smile of his own. He couldn’t help placing his hand on Anabelle’s back, just above Steve’s, and watching her sleep peacefully.
Steve turned to Bucky and spoke quietly so only he’d hear. “See if you can get an answer from Tony soon enough so I can book something else if I need to.”
Rhodey just shook his head, and carried on where they’d left off. “Okay, so. Anniversary. What are you thinking of doing?”
“Is it the one with the hammer? Or the shield maybe?” Steve suggested, ignoring the eye roll from Tony.
“What is it?” Tony asked curiously when he’d stopped laughing, Steve noticing he was staring at him and hadn’t said anything in just too long to be suspicious.
They watched the movie play without any issue from the projector then Steve looked down at Tony, who had moved to lay his head on Steve’s lap.
He felt Tony’s breath hitch when his fingers made contact with his skin. The warm puff of air as he slowly exhaled. He barely realized his thumb abandoned its quest to get rid of the chocolate it was supposed to be taking care of, and was instead starting to trail, oh so slowly, down the curve of his bottom lip. Was he even making his hand do that?
“He looks really cool, bud. That’s going on the fridge.” Tony went to the refrigerator and moved some magnets around to secure the sheet of paper.
Tony gives him that same light squeeze he’d done before, this time a signal that he needs to come up for air. To Steve’s relief, he doesn’t go far. It’s barely far enough to be consider it a breather. His words brushing against Steve’s lips.
Tony smiles up at him. “I wish I didn’t know about the pie, ‘cause I’d love to make you blush with how much of a double entendre that is.”
“Be nice, I don’t want him taking Ana-beans away out of spite,” Steve chuckled, the motion sending the newborn into the most adorable fit of smooshing her face against Steve’s shirt and making unhappy little noises. Steve proceeded to make soothing sounds and Tony rubbed her back to get her to stay asleep.
Bucky stretched out the arm holding his beer, Rhodey doing the same, tapping the necks of the bottles together. “Deal.”
The one Tony was holding was designed like his Iron Man Helmet and the other one was designed like Steve’s cowl.
Steve stood, and grabbed Tony’s hand, giving him a kiss for good measure as they made their way to the nearby couch. Peter sat down, leaving room for his parents on either side of him. When Steve took the spot on his right, Peter let himself fall against him, resting his head against Steve’s shoulder.
Steve just shrugged, looking as confused as Tony. He grabbed the bottle to open it, laughing when Tony let out a small shriek when it popped in his hand. He poured them each a glass, toasting to a wonderful night, before they took a sip. Then he paused.
“What're you making? It smells amazing,” Peter asked after picking up the backpack he’d dropped in the middle of the room and setting it in its place.
Tony rolled his eyes and gestured to Rhodey to come sit beside him. As Rhodey moved over to the couch, Tony grabbed his shirt and quickly pulled him down next to him, looking over the back to see if anyone was around.
“One thing that Pops and I did have growing up that is similar to you though is, our families weren’t exactly always traditional looking,” Tony offered when they were all settled.
“I already know what I want,” Tony chirped as the host walked away. Steve smiled at him as he briefly glanced over the menu, knowing exactly what he wanted as well. The recreation had to be accurate.
He heard bits and pieces. The villain they’d fought managed to get Tony’s armor compromised. Tony had had to get out of it. Something about a spell, and Tony being unconscious, broken limbs. Bucky couldn’t keep up and he didn’t care. He’d cut Steve off and ran for the elevator after barely taking the time to throw on some clothes. There were advantages to having the Avengers medical centre in the tower where they lived.
Steve tried to let it go, but it had been hard when every other sentence out of his son's mouth that evening was about Hawkeye or the Avengers. Thankfully, when he tucked him into bed, Peter hugged him tightly and told him he would always be his favourite Papa. There was at least that.
Steve had only been gone less than 48 hours. He needed to give Bucky a chance to figure out his plan. Not all super soldiers’ plan of attack involved just jumping in (or through) things without much thought after all.
He bounced impatiently once he was in the elevator. He needed to see Tony, and Steve, and make sure they were okay. That they were going to be fine. He ignored the part of his brain that was telling him that might be a bit much considering he was just ‘Steve’s best friend’. He’d been doing a fantastic job of ignoring his actual feelings for the past few months, he could pull it off one more time.
The drive was short since the park wasn’t too far away and when Steve and Tony arrived, the movie was already playing. Jaws was being projected from a hidden projector in the trees down to the cloth that was hanging. A blanket was laid out for them as they made their way to sit, and they found a note waiting for them along with a bottle of Veuve Clicquot chilling and two champagne glasses.
“Yeah, it kinda came up. No big deal, we were just trying to find time to go see that new action movie with the robot cars. He said he couldn’t on the 16th ‘cause it was his and Tony’s anniversary? I was sure that was in July.”
He had planned his reservation for 6:30, not a completely busy time but not too slow either. If it was just the two of them, it wouldn’t recreate the first date perfectly. So around 5:45 Steve looked at Tony and said, “come on. We have to get ready for part one of the date.”
“I’m not stupid! I know that. But I can probably just coax an idea or two out of him and see if what you have planned fits in, ya know? Tasha’s not the only spy around here.”
Tony chuckled, remembering their day of errands and carting Morgan around to her dance class and take-out while watching some new animated movie that had just been released. He'd elected for comfort over style that day, with joggers, one if his usual worn band tees, and a denim jacket. Nothing sexy in the least.
The days passed by and the day of their anniversary arrived. On any sort of special occasion, Steve and Tony made sure to spend the whole day together, whether it be snuggled up in bed, going on a walk through the city, or being in the office or lab with the other if they had to work.
They both stood quietly for a few minutes, looking around, both of them clearly thinking something through. In Bucky’s case, he was trying to figure out a way to get Tony on the phone so he could get the damned info he needed out of him. He pulled out his phone, finally seeing the dozens of messages from Steve -- including some from this morning alerting him that Tony had left New York, the tone becoming increasingly alarmed as the messages went on and Bucky wasn’t responding to him.
“Oh Lord, it’s dumb,” Tony started with a chuckle. “Norman's an ass, first of all. And he thinks all you are is a trophy husband. That you just sit around here and paint and manage a ton of staff to do all the things while you eat chocolate dipped strawberries and drink champagne all day.”
“And you looked lovely.” Natasha winked at him. “Are we going to train, or can I go back to doing something productive with my day?”
“I mean, you say stupid shit every day, so that won’t be anything new.” Steve turned to see Bucky’s smirk directed his way.
that Steve couldn’t decipher quite yet. Or at least, wasn’t sure enough that he wasn’t imagining to be sure he was right.
“No. Everyone thinks my birthday that year was our first date, but it wasn’t.” Steve turned to see the questioning look in Bucky’s eyes. “Our first date was weeks before that. I’m surprised none of you ever questioned it when we’d celebrate our anniversary in mid-June, when you all know when my birthday is.”
Tony smiled. “That Airbnb we stayed at in Vermont.” Steve nodded, a broad smile on his lips. “We should go back. It was nice there. Maybe the next weekend Pep has Morgan?”
“We met sup- soup- superhewoes,” he announced proudly once the word left his mouth. When Steve repeated the sentence to make sure he understood properly, Peter nodded quickly. “
“Again, one day Ana-Bella is going to say shit like that to you, and you’ll feel our pain,” Tony smirked at him.
“You should have told us, Pete,” Steve said, his heart aching for his son. “I’m so sorry you felt that way.”
“Ha! You are many things, Stevie, but throwing a match isn’t in your vocabulary. Come on, spill. What’s going on?”
Steve shook his head. “The machine’s acting up, we think it’s the spell Tony’s under that’s doing it.”
“This is a special occasion after all. Sound good to you?” Steve smiled at Tony as he held out his hand for him to take. Tony smiled up at him as he intertwined their fingers and Steve led them out of the tower.
Steve had seemingly appeared out of nowhere in the public's eye. Just a regular guy, who happened to look like a Chippendale model and Greek statue had procreated to bring to life his shoulder to waist ratio sporting an unfair number of abs. Rumour mills stated he'd rendered Tony smitten and stolen his heart after they'd first met, and the rest was history. Steve now headed most of Stark Industries’ related charities, sold various art pieces for ludicrous amounts of money (all going to said charities), and now, a few years after their lavish wedding at their Hampton home – for which they'd sold all the pictures and exclusive access to Vogue for a hefty donation to the Maria Stark Fund – was a stay-at-home dad to the couple's adopted son, Peter.
Rhodey sighed an exasperated sigh, knowing that Tony thought he should know EVERYTHING that was going on in his life. “Ah, your anniversary. Why is this one so important again?”
“I was wondering where the nugget was.” Tony crouched next to Steve with a groan, resting his head on his shoulder so he could look at the tiny human resting on his chest. “Even now, the sight of you and a tiny baby sleeping on your chest makes my theoretical ovaries twitch.”
Tony managed to nudge Peter just enough that they could both awkwardly sit on the chair, Steve crouched next to them. They each held one of Peter’s hands and Steve had no doubt Tony felt just as sad as he did about Peter’s admission.
Steve looked at the one he was observing and chuckled to himself. “No, not really. They’re some of the older ones I have, I just painted over them to make them look better. They were scratched and some of the black paint was coming off. Like the designs?”
“Sweetheart, he doesn’t know.” Tony started scratching Steve's back, pulling a pleased moan from him.
“Looking forward to seeing the candle distribution on my cake tonight to make that numerical situation happen,” Peter replied with an eye roll.
Tony had taken his family's legacy and made it do a complete 180 after a trip to Afghanistan had gone horribly wrong and showed him the corruption that had seeped into Stark Industries, something he'd always suspected but finally had proof of. He'd gone from a playboy merchant of death to philanthropist family man, and the world had loved following along as he made amends and redeemed himself and brought the Stark name synonymous with doing good in the world.
Bucky pretended to consider the offer, even though they both knew what the answer would be, then nodded his head slowly. “I could eat. It’s the least Tony can do after making us have to have this conversation, really.”
Tony smiled at Rhodey, shaking his head as he exclaimed, “that’s ok! As long as it’s either tomorrow or the day after. I really need to know all the details. You’re the best Rhodey Bear!”
“I don’t think I can top that, bud.” Steve pushed himself off the Audi, opening the door to strap Peter into his booster seat. “The coolest part of my day was the cute puppy I saw on my run this morning.”
When Steve got out of bed and left the room after he got ready for his run, Tony slowly started to wake up. He heard Steve shut the door and slowly started to sit up in bed. Tony looked at the time and saw it was almost six o’clock. The restaurant where they had their first date didn’t open until ten on a Saturday so he would have to wait to confirm the plans.
“I really don’t think he’ll be mad,” Bucky said after a few minutes. “If you want, I can try and talk to him. Use my spy skills to figure out if he had anything in mind?”
“Yeah bud, go for it,” Steve answered, giving Peter one last hug. “I’m sure she’ll consider it. We can start a movie when you come back.”
Tony smirked up at him, the picture of innocence. “No idea what you’re talking about. We're just two boring idiots in love.”
to the armor, and Tony crashed into a building. When he landed, he had to get out and she hit him with a spell and just paralyzed him. He fell and broke his arm when I tried to grab him to minimize the fall, and he’s been like that since. For some reason, FRIDAY can’t track his vitals the same way as usual. Heck, she can’t even talk in the room, and our phones keep dying. She needs him connected to the machine, but every few minutes, it flat lines. FRIDAY said he’s fine – she thinks he can actually hear us based on his heartrate’s fluctuations depending on what we say around him. But the machines and Tony are going haywire in here, and we don’t know why. Thor’s trying to get Loki to ask him if he knows how to fix it, and I think Clint was trying to convince Coulson to bring in Strange or Wong and see if maybe they understood what’s happening. I’m just so happy he doesn’t have the arc reactor anymore, cause god knows how that would be affected.”
The monitor shifted back to the steady rhythmic beep that meant Tony’s heart was beating normally. Bucky breathed out a sigh of relief, but still frowned as Tony continued to not move.
Steve already had his bike in front of the tower when they stepped out of the door, since he had moved it there that morning before he went on his run. Two helmets were sitting on the bike that he’d had Bucky put there only moments ago.
covers it appropriately.” Peter leaned over the couch and kissed his daughter, making his own parents beam. “Want me to grab her, Pops?”
,” Tony tried again just as calmly, and Steve gave his hand another tight squeeze, knowing how hard it could be for him to keep his cool in such situations.
“Are we still upset over where a 4-year-old’s allegiances lie?” Tony asked, carding his fingers through Steve's hair.
Steve didn’t think anything of what had just happened and smiled at Tony, moving over behind the couch to kiss his head.
“Oh my god, Cap, you are so whiny right now,” Tony laughed fondly, resuming his scratching of Steve's back, moving it to his hair and arms for good measure. He kept it up a few minutes and Steve knew he was being completely irrational, but it still hurt. “I promise you, when we can finally tell him, there's no doubt in my mind Clint will be dethroned. And, in case it was not obvious enough, we are never telling Hawkass about this, ‘cause he will hold it over us forever.”
“Tony’d had to leave for a conference the next day, so we didn’t see each other and we didn’t really mention it to anyone. It was nice to have something that was just ours for a bit. He came back, and I asked him to be my date to my birthday party, much less awkwardly this time, and you guys assumed it was our first date, and we just never corrected anyone.”
“I know this isn’t the same thing at all, and I can’t speak for Pops, but I know how it sucked to be different in school,” Tony chimed in. “Being the really smart kid, and the really young one at MIT, and the last name. It was hard sometimes. A lot of the time.”
“I know he does, but you’re just a notch above. I don’t blame him one bit.” Tony smiled at him, that great smile that made his eyes crinkle with laugh lines and shine so bright. “And second, you are Captain fucking America. You don’t just throw a frisbee around and if I hear you talk badly about my husband that way again-"
“Happy anniversary, my love,” Steve walked back into the room as Tony fully sat up in bed, taking in his surroundings. Steve walked in with the most beautiful vase of flowers that Tony had ever seen and set it on the coffee table.
“I do. The more time I’ve been spending with you two since the murdery programing was undone, the more I’ve fallen for you both. I thought it was just a dumb crush, but it’s not.”
“Grandma Maria was the same – not her job, but just from being away with Howard a lot. I didn’t really realize it until later but, I always considered Ana and Jarvis more my family than Howard.”
Peter got up, and turned to his parents before leaving the room. “I like my origin story a lot, by the way.”
“No, no, no,” Bucky exclaimed as he reached Tony’s side, looking for a button to press to call a nurse. “Tony, you can’t die.”
“I hate this pillow. It just doesn’t keep its shape. I paid a small fortune for it, you’d think it wouldn’t copy a pancake the first chance it got!”
“What if he’s expecting more though? Something better than a re-do of our first date? It’s our first milestone one, sorta, and I know he usually forgets these things until the last minute, but… what if he’s expecting me to plan something
“Those jerks,” Tony added with a laugh as it all fell into place. “We’re going to have to get them back for this sometime.”
Tony all but purred as a satisfied smile bloomed on his face. “Always,” he answered, pulling an equally smiling Steve in for a kiss.
“That’s his idea. They went to an Italian place and then Tony’s got me on the hook to help with the second part. They’d caught a movie in the park after but that’s a bit harder to bet on for spontaneity. But he’s worried Steve’s planning something big and fancy.”
“He wasn’t sure yet. Depends how easy the fix is. That’s the problem with building shit barely anyone else understands - you don’t know how bad it actually is until you get there.”
under his breath. He’d been recognized himself a few times and found it annoying, he couldn’t imagine what it was like for Tony, let alone the two most popular Avengers. He’d been curious about Steve and Tony’s relationship when Steve had told him, but the more time he spent with them, together or separately, the more he saw how much they loved each other, and just how fiercely Tony wanted to protect Steve.
“Tony usually gives a random name for all his reservations, and he makes his assistant call, that way they don’t suspect it’s him. He’s had bad experiences with photogs showing up when staff sold info to tabloids before. So he jumps through lots of hoops now. Even at places he goes to often and especially if Steve’s with him. He doesn’t want him going through any of that.”
“It’s mine and Tony’s anniversary soon,” Steve finally started explaining. “And for some reason I’m second guessing my plans.”
“Neither was my father,” Steve added. “And my ma died when I was still pretty young, and she wasn’t around much before that ‘cause of her job.”
Steve shrugged. “Makes it fun. We usually end up donating it somewhere or paying someone’s bill at a restaurant to make up for it.”
When the elevator doors finally opened on the med floor, Bucky spotted Clint in a quiet corner talking with Phil, no doubt reassuring him he was fine – it seemed the mother hen gene ran strong within their ragtag bunch.
Peter frowned at them fondly before making his way to the kitchen of the lake house Steve and Tony called home. “You two are so weird sometimes.”
Bucky let out a loud laugh that had him tumbling back against the sofa, mumbling something about dumb idiots between bouts of laughter. Rhodey seemed thoroughly perplexed.
Tony lets out a stifled, desperate, ”I’m gonna come.” The sound of it makes Steve speed up his own strokes as he listens to the uneven pants and moans at the other end of the line. Tony coming undone turns out to be the hottest thing Steve has ever heard.
He shoots all over himself, not caring a bit about the mess, fisting himself tight until it feels too much. The phone falls from his hand as he lets himself ride out the hot wave of the orgasm, that makes his eyes go blind and fireworks explode in his mind. Panting, he lies on the bed, trembling from the aftershocks.
staring are Bucky who looks incredibly uncomfortable and Wanda who is toying with an angrily sparkling ball of energy.
“God I want you here.” Tony groans again, all the hesitance gone, his voice now hot and rough. “Want you to just tear our clothes off and press me against any closest surface. You would feel so good covering me, forcing me down. I’d wanna do everything with you, Steve, tender and rough, sloppy and slow. I’d wanna bite you, and kiss you, and feel your cock in my mouth and my ass. I’d pull you against me, squeeze us together and rub our cocks raw against each other. ” Tony stops the urgent flow of words to take a few rough breaths.
“Excuse me, our first date was not his party! It was June 16th,” Tony exclaimed as he continued to scroll on his StarkPad.
Tony quietly gasped, “are we using your motorcycle?” Steve chuckled a little as he picked up a set of keys off the table by his side of the bed.
Steve came back around 7:30, the donut box in one hand and a bouquet of flowers in the other. He tried to come in quietly, as to not wake Tony up, and he went to their room.
“And here I thought you couldn’t get any mushier on main,” Peter declared as he came back to the living room. “And yes, I brought back an expression from the olden days since you’re not up with the cool kids’ lingo anymore.”
“Yeah.” Peter started jumping on Tony’s thighs, forcing Steve to sweep him into his arms before he caused his husband permanent damage. “Black Widow an my fave Avenger came,” he giggled as Steve held him partly upside down over him.
“You got- somehow you managed to get cookie dough in your beard,” Steve said with a fond smile, as Tony tried to swipe it away, only managing at to smush it more into his face and make the chocolate melt in the process.
“That's the Osborne kid, right?” Steve asked Tony, who nodded in response, his brow narrowing a fraction.
Steve turned his way, fingers ghosting against Tony’s hip under the covers. “Know where there were awesome pillows?”
“DADDY! Papa saw a puppy this morning,” Peter announced excitedly as he ran into the penthouse and to Tony who was stretched out on the couch, reading a report.
“I not a punkin,” Peter pouted at his dad, and Steve had to hide a smile behind a bite of scallop. “He said to Lizzy’s mama that papa has a twophy. We don’t have twophies here?”
It was also incredibly easy for Tony to fluster Steve. For him to make Steve’s stomach swoop and swerve like he was on a rollercoaster. To make Steve’s heart summersault when he smiled. When Steve made him laugh. When he looked at him in
“Nah, I’m gonna be cool forever in her eyes.” Peter dodged a pillow being thrown at his head. “I’ll go see if Michelle is actually sleeping or making lists of lists instead. Call us if you need us.”
One minute he was showing off the pie he'd just finished assembling before it went into the oven, mentioning the cookies he wanted to start mixing together next. Then, Tony had smiled at him. Not just any smile.
“I am sure if anything ever happened to you, aunt Tasha might hurt whoever gets to you worse than Dad and I would. And not just because she’s Black Widow,” Steve chuckled. “Dad’s right, kiddo. DNA doesn’t always make family. Those lines on a family tree don’t show just how much someone meant to you or to raising you or to shaping the person you become.”
Tony bit back a laugh. “I knew you were going to ask that. When we were talking about it last night, it got us thinking about our backgrounds, and in talking, food came up-“
Steve shrugged as he stripped his sweatpants and joined Tony in bed. “I promised her lots of extra snuggles when she is fully awake tomorrow.”
“Babe, come here,” Tony tried to pull Steve to him but there was no use, he'd planted himself like a tree and nothing would move him. So, Tony moved himself back into Steve's lap, like he'd done earlier that day. “First of all, if there's one thing I’ve learned in the three years Pete's been with us it is to
Rhodey smiled fondly at his best friend as he put a hand on his shoulder. “Sure, I can do this for you Tones. However, I can’t do it at this moment or maybe not even at all today. I have a lot of paperwork I have to do. Which reminds me, I have to get going.”
Steve nods, programming their fancy oven to stop after a certain time with JARVIS’s help, though he has to admit he doesn’t care about the pie in the least anymore. And one of the other occupants of the tower is bound to find it anyways.
Bucky frowned at him. “Why are you worried though? That sounds like a fun night, and he even said it was the best. I’m sure he’ll love it.”
“What? That's ridiculous,” Steve hissed out, trying not to rouse Peter from where he was drawing at the table.
“Maybe you’re not the only one that had a bit of a crush going on. We’d talked about it before – me and Tony. After you came back, I told him I’d always liked you maybe a bit more than as just friends. He admitted he was starting to fall for you too. We wanted to ask you out on a date.”
smile. The one that seemed reserved for him and him alone (not that it made any sense whatsoever, but a guy could dream).
Steve reached over for the bottle of lube on Tony’s nightstand, pulling away just long enough to coat his palm with enough lube for the task at hand. He stroked himself a few times, pulling an appreciative groan from Tony at the sight before him, before dipping down to lick and suck at Tony’s half-hard cock, helping it along the rest of the way with his mouth before he took him in hand with his slick hand. Steve kissed and nipped his way up Tony’s stomach and chest, making a pit stop at his nipples for a few breaths. When his lips landed against Tony’s again, he lined up his own hard cock next to Tony’s and stroked them in tandem, his large hand wrapped around them both.
He knew Steve was just more anxious since he’d been called away on a last minute mission a few hours after they’d had the initial conversation that saw Bucky agree to get info out of his boyfriend for him. Steve hated being away from Tony on a good day, but with everything going on this week on top of it, and a minor wrench thrown in his plan, he was being extra annoying about the whole thing.
“Well, I don’t think parents are going to let their kids walk by a movie like Jaws without supervision. Plus I’m glad we stopped at this one since this was one on your list that I wanted you to see with me.” Tony smiled up at Steve as he leaned onto his shoulder.
“And second,” Tony continued, ignoring his only child clearly making fun of him. “One day, you’ll call this one kiddo when she’s way too old for it, and you’ll remember this moment and get why we still call you that.”
“No, but we all know I’m the best,” Natasha announced as she walked towards them. “I thought we were training this morning?”
Bucky waited a few beats before talking, likely expecting more from Steve than just that, and therefore trying to understand what he could possibly mean by it.
Rhodey quirked an eyebrow at him questioningly. “Do you not live in close proximity to Tony? The man never shuts up when it comes to Steve,” Rhodey retorted, his voice laced with fondness to soften the words.
“First of all, you are not 30,” Tony started seriously. “Still not cool lying to your parents at 29 years, 11 months, 3 weeks, and 4 days old.”
Tony grabbed a throw blanket from the chair next to them and manoeuvred himself onto the couch next to Steve. He dropped the cozy blanket over the three of them and slotted himself against Steve’s side, his strong arm wrapped around Tony’s back to make sure he didn’t fall. He gave a soft kiss to Anabelle’s hand, still clutching on to Steve’s shirt, earning himself a little hitching sigh from his granddaughter, who turned her head once again towards him.
“Take this. I’ll take advantage of the light and go make sure there’s no one nearby for now. Won’t be long.”
My life has been a bit of a mess lately (a feeling I think most of us share), and I want to apologise for letting you wait for so long between updates. I'm writing this now because I want to assure everyone the story is not abandoned, and it is all planned out. All it's missing is the time to polish it and let it see the light. But I promise you I will get there.
Both of which Tony desperately needed, especially in his state. And he couldn’t afford to be selfish, not now.
He didn’t wait for Steve to come back down. He just curled up on the mattress wrapped in one of their few blankets and ignored the disarray all around him. He would clean up tomorrow. He would figure out what to do next. He would deal with Steve. He would stop cowering like a weakling and keep surviving. Not just for himself.
He could stay here. Maybe crawl his way to a shelter for the night. And hope to God he won’t be found. But the smell will most certainly give him away, and he learned by now not to rely on his luck.
Tony kept wondering if this rated as the stupidest thing he had ever done or the risk of immediate and spontaneous disaster gave it extra points.
He had a wild moment of confusion. He kept blinking, but nothing would come into focus. He tried to move, but his lower body was pinned beneath a solid weight.
The corridor ended with a wall where a dark hole lay gaping, mostly hidden by an enormous boulder. Steve let him go and put down the flashlight, it’s light spilling towards the crude entrance. After steadying himself against the slippery floor, he pushed it out of the way with his bare hands.
“Okay. Ok. He’s not an animal.” He swallowed. “ But Steve, listen to me, I don’t want to go that way. I do not want to come with you anymore. You said you’d let me choose and now I’m telling you to let me go because I am NOT going that way.”
“Only one of them was an Alpha. Broke his nose and that took care of it. The others were scared shitless but couldn’t pinpoint why. So I guess the thought of scavenging around here was enough to convince them to stick around.”
The water was blissfully warm. Tony tried to be quick, he really did, but he couldn’t help the first few seconds of almost painful pleasure when the water hit his body. He told himself it was only water that trickled down his cheeks.
He looked around again, slower this time. Steve hadn’t left him any weapons, probably afraid Tony might stab him in his sleep. A wave of anger clouded his mind for a second. Steve had just up and disappeared and left him alone in this house defenseless and with no weap-
And then the smell hit him. He felt the hair at the nape of his neck stand on end, and a violent shiver racked his body.
It opened with the same metallic screech like always. When the smell and the fear came, Tony thought of cinnamon and embers. When a body took form out of the darkness and came towards him, Tony refused to step back and close his eyes. He extended his right arm and pressed his palm against a heaving chest. Only the barest pressure of his fingers and it stopped advancing.
He wondered if Steve had opened the metal door, checked if it was hungry or wounded. Wounded after Tony had set it loose on those men.
“Not always. But I… I have to.” He said it with the air of a man who admitted the necessity of an amputation.
He was so lost in his own nightmares, that he didn’t hear the shuffling of another body, and didn’t understand what happened until the heavy body was lifted from his.
Tony scanned his surroundings once more. Nothing but damp concrete and an old staircase. Nothing he could use. Nowhere he could hide.
He briefly considered running, but the scent would give him away as well. Here there was a chance that the pungent smell of the sewer and wet puddles would hide him. That was what he was betting his life on, he thought almost hysterically. Sewer and trash.
But then a flash of light tore through the darkness like a knife, and Tony registered the pain in his eyes together with an abrupt shift in atmosphere. It soured like poison.
“Well, at least it looks like it’s got potential. Jake, you go check out those boxes on the right while we - What the fuck are you doing, Matt?”.
Sometimes he could swear the voice of reason rarely reverberating around his head sounded like Pepper. He should listen more. He should have listened more while she was still alive.
“So. Steve huh. He’s a character, I’ll give him that. Would not have been my first choice of a post-apocalyptic roommate, but beggars can’t be choosers.”
Tony had barely managed to slip into the bathroom when a dark-clad figure began descending the stairs.
The small Bible had been resting underneath the sketchbook. It was utterly undistinguished, but Tony thumbed through it anyway a few days later out of utter boredom. All the boxes had been sorted through, all their belonging rearranged, all the old novels read, the mystery of the metal arm still out of his reach without any tools at his disposal.
His eyes searched Tony’s, unfocused and clouded. He remained docile under his touch, awake but far away.
In the end, he walked, Steve walking beside him. He couldn’t entertain the thought of running after the inexplicable display of earlier, so he just kept moving forward into a growing sense of dread.
He could feel the muscle beneath the skin. He would never stand a chance of moving him. So he began gently running his fingers up and down, from wrist to elbow and down again.
Tony turned off the water and then dipped his fingers in the nearly filled tub, testing the temperature. The water sloshed gently when the Alpha’s large body filled the bathtub, the water already turning cloudy.
He hesitated again. Undressing him now, while he was docile and quietly pliant, made Tony’s stomach turn. He couldn’t comprehend how an Alpha of his size, his feral scent saturating the small room, could look so helpless. So vulnerable.
Tony carefully folded the letter and placed it back among the yellowed pages. He pressed his fingers against his eyes until the tips turned white.
go. I take it you’re done with me now? You’ve tried me out so now you’re gonna throw me away like a chewed up toy?”
“Nah, can’t you smell him? This one is ripe. An Omega.” He pressed his face against Tony’s neck and inhaled hungrily. “God.” He was so close that Tony could feel his muscles convulse as he swallowed. “It’s been so long since I’ve tasted one of you.” His calloused hand slipped underneath Tony’s shirt and ran up his side, grabbing at the flesh. His breath shuddered.
The voice was soothing, but Tony’s mind refused to associate it with the calm it was trying to evoke.
There was no other explanation for why he was currently herding an infamously vicious creature away from the cage that kept it contained and towards the upper floor.
The underground tunnel branched off to the right after a while, and then they followed an intricate array of twists and turns into progressively narrower corridors. The stench was now suffocating.
He walked towards the door, not a hint of hesitation in his step. Over the heavy noise from within, Tony made out the sound of metal scraping against metal. A high and piercing screech.
Sometimes he would lay awake and wonder. About the monsters outside the house, and the ones inside it.
They were walking down a deserted underground tunnel. Tony wasn’t sure if the fact that it was deserted was working for or against his sanity.
“It’s fucking dark outside, Steve! You need to what? Go out there and get yourself killed? Is this your answer to all this fuckery that
“Some people said Jesus came back. I bet it was just some rumour someone started because they needed some fucking hope when all that hell broke loose.” He chuckled. “Why? Did you believe them?”
“I don’t know yet. We’ve been here for - a long time. I’ll have to - I’ll have to check one of the other safe houses. There is one five kilometres to the northeast and - “
The sounds of the struggle continued. Another crash, a heavy body hitting the floor, a guttural whine that sounded like both pain and fury.
“Will you, Tony? With all the money and the labs and the people that you have at your disposal? All the ruins and the dead bodies that are left of them?” His lips twisted in a deprecating smile. “With all the resources of the Stark Corporation?”
The man moved from the mouth of the alley and Tony braced himself. But instead of making a grab for him, the stranger simply walked past him and leaned against the dead-end wall. Tony shot a quick glance to his now unobstructed escape path and then looked back at him.
Tony startled awake. The amber light of sunset was spilling into the room as he looked around, unsure what had pulled him from sleep. Then he heard it.
“You’re planning your first date? I’m surprised you actually remember what happened at Steve’s birthday party. You seemed like you were hammered.”
“Can you blame me? Look at her,” Steve answered like it was the most obvious thing in the world. Which, Tony had to admit, wasn’t far from the truth. “Do you even remember Peter being this small anymore?”
“You were always an amazing dad. And husband.” Steve used his free hand to pull Tony in for another kiss. “I love the family we built together.”
Tony had placed his hand on his waist, squeezing ever so gently to move him out of the way of the refrigerator door. The gentle, almost affectionate, touch had sent his mind absolutely haywire. But he thought he did an okay job at acting like it was nothing while Tony’d reached into one of the drawers inside the appliance and pulled a tube of pre-made dough.
“Go nap, you need it too,” Steve called after him. He turned to Tony with a smile. “We’re still cool, right? We’re superheroes.”
“Sulking like the giant man-child he is ‘cause Steve’s not home?” Rhodey finished for him with a smirk that made Bucky chuckle. “Normally you’d be right, but he left bright and early this morning. Had to fly out to Malibu, something with the reactor at the plant in Cali that only he could fix or the whole Western seaboard would be in jeopardy.”
Tony let out a soft mewl. “Please, sir. I’ll apologize Fury and do anything else you want me to, just please, don’t cane me.”
"No.” Steve presses his fingers even deeper. “No, my boy chooses instead to be a mouthy, disobedient sub. You mouth-off to me. You mouth-off to our team, you even mouth-off to Fury.” Steve chuckles at that. “Honestly, I wonder where you get the balls.”
Steve slips his thigh under Tony’s head and holds him close while Miss Riley finishes quickly. As soon as she does, she covers the sub with the blanket, feeling sorry for him.
“Please, sir, how many?” Tony asks meekly. It was rare for Tony to know how many he was going to get. Some times Steve set a number in his head, but usually he just spanked until he felt that Tony had either taken all that he could, or the lesson had been learned.
Then his hand grips Tony’s hair and pulls, forcing Tony’s head up. He traces a finger lightly over the exposed neck, just over the edge of the thin, dark green collar. Tony shivers and his breath catches a little. He loves having his neck touched by his dom.
Steve considers this for a long moment. He studies the part of Tony’s face he can see. Tony is exhausted. His sobs have died down, tears are just running freely from his eyes as hiccups jerk his body.
“I am familiar with the protocol, sir.” Steve answered. “But Tony is in no condition, physically or emotionally, to leave this room.”
The wooden spoon moves at lightning speed over his thighs, just under the cane marks, down to the pits of his knees. Tony yelps and wails as it feels like a dozen bees stinging him over and over. His legs try to flail and kick, but that only pulls on the cane stripes. When Tony’s thighs are bright red and burning hot to the touch, Steve pauses.
Steve spends the next few minutes doing what he can to get Tony comfortable and settled in. He put one of his long-sleeved tee-shirts on him and rubbed a gentle lotion into Tony’s bottom and thighs before covering him with the blanket and rubbing his back.
Steve nods. “I informed my sub that he was going to be disciplined for disrespect and ordered him to strip. He obeyed. He was due to be milked. – which I have found that at least in Tony’s case is a contributing factor to his behavior. – So, I milked him, which immediately put him in a more submissive, contrite mindset. Once he’d recovered from that, I instructed him to fetch the cane. He fears that implement more than any other and put up a slight fuss. That broke a second rule: Prompt obedience, so he earned a spanking with the wooden spoon after his caning.”
“No.” Steve responds evenly, his cold, blue eyes studying Tony. “No, you aren’t yet. But you will be.”
“It seems we’ve begun slipping back into old habits. I have no tolerance for disobedience and disrespect. You are fully aware of this. There is no excuse for your behavior, is there?”
Tony lay over the desk that Steve had custom-made for Tony. It was at the perfect height for Tony to bend from his waist over it. The cushion was a firm, half-circle that Tony would tuck under his hips. It helped him arch his back and lifted his bottom beautifully. There were compartments on the long sides that when opened, leather loops could be pulled out. Tony could either hold onto these, or Steve could use them to restrain his hands. This time, Steve chooses to use them as restraints.
“If I sense it is too much for you, yes. But I don’t see that happening. They won’t ask you any questions, so other than apologizing to Fury, you can just lay here. If you wish to talk about what transpired, you can, but that is your choice. They will, of course, need to see the result of your punishment for documentation.”
“That’s quite impressive, actually.” Anderson says as he jots down his notes. “And the spanking? A wooden spoon, was it?”
Tony moves his head up and over enough so he can look at the Director. “I’m sorry for being disrespectful, sir. It was wrong and I hope that you will forgive me for undermining your authority.”
Steve pulls back the covers to display Tony’s small, striped bottom. Tony lets out a little whine in protest and opens his puffy eyes to look up pleadingly at Steve.
“Mostly as usual. He did get into position quickly and did his best to maintain it. He doesn’t have the highest pain tolerance and with a caning, I expected some wiggling. He took it well, and refrained from begging.”
“You will be doing that anyway.” Steve’s voice hardens. He doesn’t enjoy causing Tony pain, but he is determined to correct his sub’s behavior. The cane leaves a lasting impression on Tony, much more than anything else. “Now, do as you are told.”
“No, sir. I’m s-sorry, sir.” Tony answers through the lump in his throat. He hates more than anything, disappointing Steve.
Tony turned on his saddest puppy-eyes and aimed them full strength at Steve. “Please, sir. Something else… anything else. Please. It isn’t fair to cane me for this. I didn’t do anything bad enough to deserve it!”
Steve smiles condescendingly. He had after all, planned from the beginning to include milking Tony as part of his punishment and has no intention of changing his mind.
Tony needed a dom who would take complete control, and Steve Rogers provided exactly that. For the first five months, Tony had to ask permission to do anything. Steve told him when to sleep, when to get up, when to eat, when to work, even when to use the bathroom. Tony fought against it tooth and nail at first, but after three months, Tony relented. Slowly, Steve gave him back a few of his privileges and started to let him go on missions again.
Tony turned his head to meet Steve’s gaze. “And thank you for the lovely dinner. Next time, let’s plan our anniversary together.”
“Don’t need holidays and anniversaries as an excuse for that, but anyways,” Steve bumped his shoulder with Bucky who was groaning next to him. “No, our first date was June 16. We were both here and I asked Tony about as awkwardly as you can imagine if he wanted to go grab something to eat. He just said he knew a place and we ended up at Romano’s, an Italian place his mom had taken him to when he was growing up. When we left, we walked around a bit and there was this movie screening outside in a park nearby, it was just the most random thing to stumble on. It was dark by then, so no one really noticed Captain America and Iron Man joining them. We weren’t prepared for a movie showing really, so we sat way at the back against a tree, and I used my jacket so Tony could sit on it. When the movie finished we’d gotten closer, and his head was on my shoulder, and he asked me if it was supposed to be a date. I’d just said yes, and he kissed my cheek and said it was the best first date he’d ever had.
“Second room on the left,” Clint answered with a knowing smile. “I’ll tell you later,” Bucky heard Clint tell Phil quietly enough that only his or Steve’s enhanced hearing would have picked it up.
? Really!?” Steve whined. Before he or Tony could add much else, Tony's phone rang with Pepper's ringtone, which meant he couldn’t ignore her.
Rhodey threw his arms in the air. “I said the same thing to Tony! He was pissed I didn’t know it was in a week. Or, a few days away now, I guess. I have better things to do than keep track of when they first went on a date or kissed or held hands or whatever.”
Steve and Tony went into the restaurant and asked for the reservation under Steve’s name and cancelled the one Tony had made in the process since they didn’t need it. The host led them to their table and sat them down, placing menus in front of them.
“She said she gave you lots of opportunities to hand in your assignment and you said you didn’t care if she failed you,” Tony explained in a voice much calmer than Steve had heard the night before when they’d discussed it. “Pops is right, we aren’t mad, we’re just a bit confused bud. This isn’t like you.”
Steve had tried to protest. Tried to make Tony see reason. It wouldn’t take that long to whip up a batch of freshly made cookies. Tony had just ignored him, smiling at him the whole while as he pulled out two spoons from a drawer, closing it shut with his hip (which was way sexier than it had any right to be).  He popped open the plastic wrapping while Steve was pointing out all the dry ingredients on the counter, and dug the spoon into the dough and ate it straight.
“Told you,” Tony answered on a yawn. And, I asked, you know. At the rental? Their pillows are from Price Club or something. Ten bucks! How they’re that cozy compared to this, no fucking clue.”
“Steve,” Bucky whispered before gathering him in his arms for a hug. “I’m sorry. When you said there was an accident, I got really worried and kinda tuned out. I’m so sorry.”
Tony tilted his head up where it lay on Steve’s shoulder, giving his husband a kiss on the jaw, just below his ear.
“Where the hell are you, man?” Bucky huffed, frustration evident in his tone and on his face. He hated when Steve went easy on him.
Tony just turned the package towards Steve pointing to a bright bubble affirming it was safe to eat raw, while the spoon stayed caught between his lips.
As Tony was channel surfing, Rhodey waved goodbye to Steve as he walked towards his and Tony’s bedroom. When Rhodey knew he was out of super soldier hearing ear shot, he looked to Tony and asked, “what the hell was that?”
“Part one? Steven Grant, what did you plan?” Tony squinted at him with no real malice in his eyes. All Steve did was shrug and proceed to get out of bed and get ready.
His head dropped next to Tony’s against his pillow, his movements stilling and gently stuttering, breath ragged. Tony felt him spill between them as the words still left his mouth. Gorgeous. Sexy. So good to him.
