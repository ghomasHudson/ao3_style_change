Soon, their fingers and toes were all wrinkled, and he and Tony were discussing whether or not there would be a new technology in physical media to rival acrylic paint or if the rise of digital would prevent such innovation. Steve sighed. The discussion was amazing, but he was getting sleepy. So sleepy, that he let out a yawn. When he did so, Tony stopped mid-sentence.
Steve watched his pet relax. He was hoping that would be the result, but this was new, and he was worried that once it became real rather than just words on a page, or even pictures on the internet, it wouldn’t have the appeal. But, from the way his pet absolutely melted into the reclining chair, face down, he knew it was a good choice.
Steve managed to wait nearly a week before his next experiment in cooking. It didn’t do anything to reduce how much he noticed Tony, because apparently Tony took his bringing food as an open invitation for meals together whenever Tony wanted to try something. It led to some really exciting food that he was absolutely not ready to attempt. (Teppanyaki was incredibly impressive, but he was absolutely not ready for the showmanship apparently required. He didn’t want to know if the serum would regrow a missing finger.) It also led to him being better able to function through his embarrassment, even if Tony did his best to make him blush on a regular basis. So, with all that, he decided he was ready for another food attempt. (He was going to ignore the one that failed. No one knew about that one, other than JARVIS, who had been sworn to secrecy.)
“Damn, Capybara! This is delicious. Looks like your food isn’t just a one trick pony.” Steve blushed and Tony laughed.
Steve was more careful than he had ever been when making his meal. Before, it was just for him to learn and maybe share, but this time was for something more. It had to be perfect. Also, it had to be timed perfectly. This time, he didn’t want to do it in Tony’s workshop. Both because it didn’t fit the mood, and because, well, if it went poorly, he wanted them
Tony moaned as he was given permission to move. The pain had sent him so deep down that his rock hard cock had been at one remove, until he was reminded about it by the ability to get friction against it, finally. But every time he thrust against the chair he was it, it pulled his back. The pain was absolutely exquisite, but it was distracting from him getting a rhythm. That might have been actually all to the good. He wasn’t allowed to come, and after the time taken to pierce and decorate his back, he was ready to go off as soon as he had permission. But while it felt good, the irregularity of the pain versus the friction kept him just on the edge perfectly.
“Sir has not eaten dinner yet, though based on past data, he will be wanting food soon.” Steve breathed a sigh of relief at JARVIS’s response. One more question and then he could go downstairs to the workshop.
Tony appeared to take his silence as an invitation to continue. “Seriously, you can give me a big hunk of meat any day.”
The door opened without him even having to knock. Steve would never get used to that, the way some doors opened without him having to do anything. It did make it much easier with the two plates he was carrying.
Conversation over lunch was both light and snarky. Tony’s acerbic comments on his coworkers, and Steve’s on the state of the art world were the basic fare. It passed by quickly and Steve felt himself relax from the nerves he had been feeling at his plans. Tony was here. It would all be perfect, no matter how it went.
And the last thought Steve had before falling asleep was how well they fit together. Maybe it was time to think about more permanent jewelry.
“Thank you, ma’am. I’ll definitely give this one a try.” With that, he took the book up to the checkstand.
“Sir has no allergies and has enjoyed snapper in the past, though I do not believe the combination with couscous is one he has had before.” JARVIS’s voice came through the speakers again.
Tony followed his Master down the stairs, into the room that they used for their play. Again, like always when the scene was going to be incredibly complicated, the room was a bit rearranged. At first, he wasn’t sure what it was going to be, there was just the reclining chair, the one that let him lay down and give his Master access all over. It was really a cross between a dentist’s chair and a massage table, except even more manueverable. Then he saw the smaller table, with the needles. A shiver ran down his spine in anticipation. Tony had actually never tried this, but he had wanted to for so long. His Master was truly giving him a treat today.
That night, Steve had a lot of thinking to do. When morning came, he hadn’t come to any conclusions, but he kept thinking. He did so as he and Tony went out to dinner together, and as he expanded his horizons more with his own cooking and enjoying it in Tony’s workshop. Finally, he reached a conclusion, and, as it had worked so well before, he decided on a new menu. This one, the picture in the book looked gorgeous. Steak with papaya salad was the recipe.
Again, the conversation was light through dinner, and Steve was gratified to see Tony soaking up the sauce with his bread. After letting the warmth of Tony’s enjoyment flow through him, he lost himself in their discussion. It was only when Tony let out a yawn despite the coffee he had been drinking that Steve realized they had been talking for hours.
It had been a while since they had time to really scene. Their work schedules hadn’t lined up with a day off in weeks, somehow, and they were both feeling the lack. Now, they had the next few days off together, and Steve was ready. This was something they had both wanted to try, but hadn’t gotten around to doing yet. Steve had wanted to do something like this for a very long time, but Tony was the first partner he had who was willing. And Steve was glad- this was going to be intense, and Tony was definitely the person he wanted to start this out on.
From nearby, Tony heard the response. “Good pet, you’re doing such a good job. You’re so gorgeous for me.”
His pet was in for a real treat. Steve took a deep breath. Everything was ready. The dungeon had been cleaned, and the special chair disinfected several times. A light lunch was ready, and Tony was due home from a quick review of R&D any moment. Steve had told him that they were going to scene, but had left it a surprise, the only warning being that it was one that they couldn’t do without some time off.
“You, me, and Brazilian food tomorrow. You’ll love it.” Tony grinned at him, and Steve felt his mouth turning up further without his input.
When it was all done, the meal looked delicious, and he had managed to save some of the chicken fat. That would be useful for a later cooking experiment. Now time to see if it tasted as good as it looked. With a deep breath, he again headed to Tony’s workshop.
Steve smiled indulgently. His pet was so sweet, and he knew from past experience that this bit would tickle- there wasn’t enough pressure with a marker to prevent it.He’d have to go quickly so as not to ruin the mood already set. Fortunately, he knew every plane of his pet’s back and had a plan already, so he was able to make the marks quickly. Still, about halfway through, he had to say something.
“Well, then, I’m always down to experiment, let’s dig in!” Suiting actions to words, Tony took a bite. At the sound Tony made, Steve quickly sat down to take his own bite, hiding his reaction to the sound. Maybe he would have to think about it. But, that was a problem for future-Steve. Now-Steve had just taken a bite, and the fish was
“Sorry. We can forget this-” Steve did his best to keep the disappointment out of his voice until he was interrupted.
“Everything okay, Steve?” Tony’s forehead was wrinkling. It was a cute forehead, but Steve didn’t want to be the cause of those nerves. He had to spit it out.
Tony let out a deep sigh. “They’re all brainless. I dread to see what they come up with while I’m on vacation, but after that, I need the break.” Steve saw his eyes flicker down near the plate. “And I see plans are still in place. Perfect.”
“So, Tony… I’m getting into trying cooking. There’s so many new foods out there! I want to try them all, but I need a taste-tester. I don’t know what food today is supposed to taste like, but you do. Want to be my guinea pig?”
Soon, he was finished, and it was time to start the fun. This would be almost meditative for him as he focused putting the needles in perfectly as his pet relaxed into the pain. It would be sharper than the usual kind of pain they used, so Steve hoped the reality would be everything his pet wanted. Steve took a deep breath and focused. With gloved hands, he carefully took one of the sterile needles and inserted it at the first marker dot. As the needle pricked the skin, his pet let out a sound that could only be called a please whine.
Before coming down, he had put out the supplies. He had about three times as many needles as he thought he needed, and a whole box of gloves. And, he had the ribbon. Play piercing would be fun, but he was also going to make it a corset piercing. Still, first, he needed to disinfect his pet’s back. Again, he was glad for the reclining chair he had. It made it so he could position his pet and reach everywhere he needed to.
“Don’t worry, Winghead. I’m enjoying our conversation.” The look on Tony’s face, was it… wistful? Steve wasn’t sure, but maybe Tony wanted to not just spend time with him, but
“JARVIS, has Tony eaten dinner yet?” Steve didn’t want to bring his food down if it would be immediately rejected.
As Tony stripped carefully and settled himself onto the chair, his brain settled, too. The thrills of anticipation and the edge of nerves slid out into the floaty calm he got when they scened. He wasn’t all the way there yet, but he was definitely very far along for having just settled himself down. The sudden switch from unknown to known and imminent apparently did it for him more than he realized. Tony took one more deep breath and relaxed into the chair.
Soon enough, Tony finished eating. He picked up the collar and kneeled down in front of Steve, holding it up. “Please, Master?”
“Yes, I do. And not just for the food.” Tony grinned and winked, no longer held paralyzed. Steve knew he was going to have to ask about that, but not right now. Right now he was too happy.
The important question had come out, but now he had to wait for Tony to respond. As the seconds stretched on, feeling like minutes, Steve’s heart started to fall towards his feet and he felt his face begin to stiffen. Tony hadn’t moved since the question had escaped Steve’s mouth, and dread was filling Steve. Finally, Steve had enough of the silence.
“Capsicle!” Tony’s smile lit up his entire face. Steve loved seeing that genuine smile. He wasn’t examining why he enjoyed that smile, not yet, but he couldn’t say he was disappointed that Tony was the person left in the Tower to try his food. As he looked on, he saw Tony’s eyes widen. “You brought me dinner? What’s the occasion? This looks amazing!”
Tony got himself out of the tub and held out a hand to Steve, who took it and used it to pull himself out of the tub. They carefully dried each other off, and went to the cozy bed they kept down here. Steve was very, very relieved he had thought ahead and made sure it had not only clean sheets, but very soft cotton ones for Tony’s back. Thus, they didn’t have to do anything other than fall into bed, and snuggle close. The collar would stay on until they woke up, but otherwise, the scene was done.
But now the offer had been made. He couldn’t just forget that the encounter had happened, because he had promised more meals to Tony, and he wasn’t going to go back on that promise. Now to think of something to cook that wasn’t romantic. Nope. Not going there.
Steve looked down at his pet. Everything had been so perfect, and his pet had done such a good job. As a bonus, his art had gone amazingly well, and his colored pencil sketch just needed some tidying up. He’d do that later, after a nap. Now, it was time for a warm bath to get all cleaned up and relaxed, and to pull them both out of their headspace. That was one advantage of their basement- the bath was right there, so he could run the bath while watching his pet without him having to move. Steve raised his voice so his pet could hear him from near the tub as he put in a few carefully picked scented products, and pulled a water bottle and some fruit out of the mini-fridge.
. Tony had all the books he could possibly want in electronic format, but there was nothing quite like flipping through a book and seeing what was there. This time, though, he was on a mission. Clint had found out he’d only been to the little convenience store near him and decided to take him to a big grocery store. There had been so many different items and ingredients! And now, his stomach could handle them all, and there wasn’t wartime rationing. Hence the mission- cookbooks.
When his collar clicked into place, Tony started falling into his floaty place. His Master was taking charge and he could relax. Still, he didn’t know what was coming. There were a lot of things on their mutual want list, several of which they had been waiting on until they had time, and he had let his Master pick the one for this break. The anticipation was delicious, but it was also interfering a bit with getting into his floaty space. Still, he was sure with all the wait, he’d fall there quick once he knew the plan.
Eventually, Steve realized there were no more dots. He had lost track of time, losing himself in the focus of making sure the piercings were as perfect as possible, that the pain was exactly what he wanted to give, and that his pet’s skin stayed clean. Sitting back a bit, Steve swapped out gloves while examining his handiwork. Tony’s back had 16 needles in it, starting out near his shoulders, and shaped like an hourglass on his back. The needles were blue on the end, which made his choice of ribbon (made before he knew the color for the gauge of needle he wanted to use was) all the more perfect. The red would contrast with the needles and glow against his pet’s skin. Now, to weave the ribbon in a corset pattern through the needles. He would have to be very careful. A wrong move, and he could hurt his pet in a way he didn’t intend. There was going to be pain, sure, because his pet relished the pain, but only the pain he wanted to give.
to be able to retreat. Dinner had to be going onto the table right as Tony walked in from the board meeting. Fortunately JARVIS was on his side and agreed to alert Steve when the meeting was done. That would only give him just enough time to put the plates on the table, but experience let him know how long the meetings would take. He just had to fight not to rush.
. Apparently he was a decent cook. And he, perhaps, had a willing mouth to feed. That was quickly proven with Tony’s first words after chewing.
Steve’s heart melted at the way his pet stilled at his voice. His pet was always so good for him. Sometimes he couldn’t believe that the genius tech mogul wanted the delicate artist. But he did, and was beautiful when he submitted for his Master. Steve had the best pet ever. So, he made sure to finish the necessary marker marks quickly so as not to make things harder for his pet in the not fun way.
“Thank you, Master, this looks wonderful.” A pleased thrill settled in his brain when his Master responded.
So, instead of rushing, he fussed with the table. Everything had to be set just right for this, or else he would know and stress out about it. Even the things he knew Tony wouldn’t notice, he had to make perfect. At least all the fussing gave time for the meat to rest properly, otherwise he might have gotten impatient and cut it too soon. As it was, he was just cleaning up the plates when JARVIS announced Tony was on his way. The plates somehow made it to the table without disaster, and Steve was there to greet Tony as he came off the elevator.
Both unsurprisingly and surprisingly, it’s Natasha, and Steve guesses he should be accustomed to not noticing her enter the store, no matter how much it still freaks him out anyway. “Excited for later?” She asks, grabbing a Hershey’s bar from the little box in front of the register. She slides it over to him and Steve rolls his eyes.
“I don’t know anything you don’t.” Steve answers, lies. He motions to the wall. “You said it yourself. Hydra. They’re no good. But…”
With a frown, Steve suddenly stands from the ottoman. “Forget it. Let yourselves out whenever, I—I need to clear my head.” He mumbles. There’s a mutual silence between Bucky and Natasha as they look at him, and then towards each other. They don’t say anything to him as he pulls on a hoodie and slips out of his apartment.
“Look at that,” Bucky whispers into his ear, “you see how much of fucking slut you are? You look like a rentboy. An amateur pornstar.”
Stark Tower. A piece quite obviously headlining the protests against Stark weapons development. The protests and calls for action against Howard Stark that are constantly ignored by not only the man himself, but the federal government as well.
The trio watches, jaws dropping simultaneously as a dark-skinned man with only swim trunks on seems to angelically glide down from what’s at least an
Steve, by name, is pretty much a nobody. He has a normal social life, a small group of close friends, acquaintances from college, extended family he doesn’t talk to—things like that. Steve is a law-abiding citizen. He doesn’t do much to attract attention, he wears clothes that don’t make him stand out—his hair cut is basic, even his name—Steven Grant Rogers—doesn’t have much merit or pizzazz. For lack of better wording, he’d describe himself with the cliché: “average, every day guy.”
He finally lets out a chuckle when he’s out of earshot of Howard, albeit a pained one. Tony thinks whatever dolt had decided to do graffiti on Stark Tower the night before Howard’s famed socialite gathering is a brilliant. Outrageously so. Every billionaire and his trophy wife will be at the damned thing. A whimsical, stuck up penthouse “ball” where there might as well be cocaine dispensaries in the bathrooms. This year, Howard himself had chosen the theme, announcing it to story-starved journalists who’d stuck around a few minutes after the end of a press-conference.
When Steve glances at the lifeguard post, he smirks when he sees that the chair has been abandoned. At closer inspection, the lifeguard has once again climbed down from his post, but when Steve takes a step in his direction, he notices that the guy is…
Tony watches, silent and shaking, as the phone, as if it’s some delicacy, is slowly pulled from his hands. He watches as it’s pushed into Steve’s back pocket, and he can’t help but let out an insignificant whimper of protest.
It’s Tony Stark. He steps out of the shadow Steve didn’t see him in and he’s holding up Steve’s borrowed blazer.
Steve guesses that it makes sense in a way, he really doesn’t know anyone who genuinely likes Howard Stark—horny libertarians and the rest of the right-wingers, he doesn’t count.
Stark Tower after winding his way through the party. He’d be immersing himself in the social affairs of the very one percent of the one percent that he’d hated for so long. Last night had been one thing, the prequel to what’s really going to set off Howard Stark—tonight’s hit will be revolutionary.
Steve feels bad when he slips a hand into Tony Stark’s pocket and steals his SI keycard. He really does, Tony had made it too easy, and really, Steve hadn’t expected the man to so openly express his disdain for his father. Plus, he looks really hot in his suit and the golden mask makes his eyes shine. Steve has the smallest fantasy to court the younger Stark while they’re dancing. However, it’s not hard to ignore.
Natasha pays the cab fare of fifty-two dollars, tips the driver, and the three of them get out. “This will be where you need it.” Bucky lifts the black bag up, holding his stencils and paint cans inside, for emphasis. Steve nods and Natasha waits for the cab to drive away before she pushes Steve’s mask into his hands. “I’ll be across the street waiting.” She turns and points to a small café. Bucky kisses Natasha, then pats Steve’s back and wishes him luck before he’s gone. Steve is left alone on the sidewalk.
He sighs from his seat in the back of the cab, earning a questioning glance from Bucky. The cab halts to a stop before his friend can ask. They’ve stopped in the middle of the street, they’re just a tad early, but Steve doesn’t mind. He doesn’t have a fancy car to pull up to the event in, and not all the press has arrived yet. He doesn’t want to attract the attention of cameras on him before the important guests start to flow in. He’ll slide in unnoticed, hopefully.
“Why would you ask that?” He asks, like Bucky hadn’t sent the message to their group text. Everything has gone perfectly according to plan.
When he finishes with R&D, Tony practically runs to the elevators that lead to the parking garage, antsy and quite obviously annoyed with his pounding head. He ignores elevator etiquette when he reaches them, and quite painfully runs right into the exiting party of one. The
“No consideration for my schedule, just because you want some cock. S’that right? Drove all the way over here to get fucked? Answer me.”
And Steve does, bleary-eyed and tired as he drives and drops off his squirmish and increasingly horny husband all the way at Bucky’s apartment twenty minutes away from home. Tony is practically diving to get out of the car after he smacks a quick kiss on Steve’s cheek.
He refuses to open his eyes as Steve lets go of him, and he continues to drag the mouth around him back and forth.
His sandy blonde hair, ocean blue eyes, and muscular stature often has surf fanatics dubbing him the Captain America of the ocean due to his uncanny resemblance to the renowned comic star.
Tony tunes him out and refrains from digging his index fingers into his temples. He wants Advil, but he knows he’d left the little bottle of bliss in his car. That doesn’t stop him moving his fingers around in his pockets as if it’s going to appear there.
Tony raises an eyebrow that the man can’t see and purses his lips for extra emphasis that he doubts what was just said. He quickly pursues the statement, feeling bold. “Howard Stark is a cynic and a bastard, why else would he have a ball in his penthouse suite? It’d be suicide to not show up to this…” Tony pauses, remembering the look Howard had given him, the
Distressed, Tony begins to cry. First, a single, fat tear spilling down his face. It isn’t long until he croaks out his first wail and is full on sobbing, his body shaking profusely as he drops down to sit back on his feet.
It’s then that something akin to a desire to push Nomad back blossoms in the back of his mind as Tony loops security footage from earlier in the month over the deleted patches—including any moments of him slinking around alone after Nomad had run off. He’s doing the man that had gotten Pascal fired such a nice favor that
The woman lets go of him after she’s finished writing, and Steve raises his phone to shine his flashlight onto his hand.
He stands there for about twenty more minutes. After a handful of the most important guests have walked in—the most camera flashes go off for Bezos, Zuckerberg, and Musk—Steve slips in when one of them throws bread crumbs to the reporters with a few words. His mask is on, a black and white piece covering the tip of his nose up to the middle of his forehead. It fits him almost too well, and he knows he’ll be the most unrecognizable person at this event. All he has to do really is avoid Howard—who must have crafted the guest list himself. Steve
When Steve cranes his head back to look up into the distance, he can still see some faint lights shining from the top of the tower. It’d been nearly three hours since he’d left. He’s got no clue what’s still going on up there, and he’s almost glad of it. His gut wrenches just thinking about what he’d done tonight.
“I—Okay.” Is all he says before jerkily turning around and walking away to find someone tending to beverages.
Howard would blow a fuse as soon as the night was over, and it would very much be blown in his direction. Tony is better off keeping the fact that he’d seen Nomad do any of this under wraps anyway, unless he wants Howard finding a way to tag the blame for this on him otherwise.
Steve keeps the shop open until seven after dealing with a handful more of regular customers. The anxiety bubbling in his chest and stomach eagerly begins to build up as soon as he finishes closing. And by the time he’s at his apartment, which Bucky and Natasha have already let themselves into, he’s practically shaking—antsy and raring to get the show on the road.
He’s interrupted by the audience that their little surf-off had attracted. They’re cheering, but for who?
Steve reacts calmly, beginning to run a hand through Tony’s hair again, ever so gently massaging at his scalp.
He can’t help but let a part of him think of Tony Stark stepping forward from the shadows, and the way his eyes had reflected the light pouring in through the windows, even behind that golden mask. The way they’d danced together, the way they’d challenged each other so easily just a short time ago.
Recently, as in today recently, his alias has been re-gaining rapid fire attention after his rather ill-mindedly placed painting
The soft purr of the capstan’s motor is comforting as he bolts it down to the flat roof and turns it on. He’s surprised he’s managed to get up here—the very top of the tower, above the fancy balcony. He’d expected security to be tight. Even though he’d brought all his equipment with him, he had expected to be caught and pending arrest by now.
They’d been living together for a little less than a year, so he wants to trust that Steve isn’t just using him for apartment space. He does make use of the common room as a makeshift art studio. Tony finds it endearing, as there are multiple paintings of him scattered around on different easels.
“You seem comfortable here.” The man speaks up while Tony mentally chokes. He hums along to the live brass band playing outside—the doors leading to the balcony are open and along with the heater, there’s a nice breeze flowing in. Today had been chosen for this event mostly because the weather—not too freezing or snowing out. “I’m not.” The man continues.
He almost wishes it was darker out, after seeing the woman grimace at him as she let’s go of his hoodie strings and takes a single, short step backwards. “Yeah. Taking a walk at three in the morning in an alley full of
Steve lets out a low whistle at Bruce’s conclusion. Thor joins him, lowering his sunglasses and nodding slowly in approval. None of them look away until Thor decides to push his can towards Steve. “Hold my beer. I’m going to talk to him.”
He’s processed that the odds are still in his favor—that his face hadn’t been seen, he’d wiped his prints. It had been
And as another deliciously added bonus—Steve picks up his phone to reread the text message he’d gotten earlier in the day, feeling positively and helplessly giddy—Bucky had actually fucking done it. Bucky is going to be part of the god damn security for the event. The excitement has him nearly rubbing his hands together and barking out a butchered evil laugh. He restrains himself, and quickly stuffs his phone back into his back pocket as a customer approaches the checkout counter.
This was never a one-man job, after all. His two friends had helped and nevertheless supported him since the get-go, from when he’d initially told them about his idea of just painting normal graffiti, to his gig next to Trump Tower, and even what’s to be his notorious double-hit targeting Stark. It wasn’t like he could hide it from them, after all. The both of them being so observant, not trusting them wasn’t an option. The help they provide has gotten him far too. They have as much in this gig as he does.
In the middle of the room, there’s a human-shaped lump of pale, glossy flesh staring up at the ceiling.
Whoever had coordinated tonight’s security had arranged for both pre-employed and event-only guards to be standing near the obvious entrance points around the perimeter of the building, or lurking around the first floor to intimidate lingering reporters—a limited number of guards remain on the penthouse floor with the partygoers.
Flat-out and bare, there is nothing wrong with Tony’s relationship with his husband. He loves Steve very much, and he knows the feeling is healthily mutual between them. It’s why he’s spending his morning with Steve in their bedroom—like any normal couple would—getting driven into their mattress like a wanton whore.
The feeling of the fabric restraining his arms, rubbing against and chafing at his wrists gets Tony even more worked up as he waits for Bucky to
The only slight abnormality might possibly be that Tony is three meters away from Steve, who has been sitting across the room, stroking his cock since he got up half an hour prior to Tony’s own bleary-eyed rise from bed.
Bucky, bless him, responds immediately, and Tony feels like melting when he’s lifted up and carried to the living room. Instead of being set down on the couch, like he’d expected, Bucky drops him onto the coffee table in front of it.
Tony gags and chokes as Bucky pushes in with a twitch and holds himself there, Tony’s nose against his navel, for a few moments before pulling out completely. He wipes his wet cock across Tony’s face with a groan before lifting himself up.
piss off and embarrass Howard Stark. The inevitable flurry of reporters that will be harping Stark for a statement as the charity ball press rolls in is not a loss either. Not at all.
His legs, his arms, his expression—all frozen in place from the trauma of discovering from what he’s come home to.
Bucky pulls him close and bites at his ear. “Go ahead, doll. Take what you want. Show me how much you need it.”
“What?” He stutters, but he knows why. He looks good, his hair slicked back with a little gel, the tautness of the designer tux on his body, and Steve doesn’t often dress up, so this is a rare sight. Bucky lets out a whistle and Natasha clasps her hands together. “You clean up nicely.” She supplies, and then picks up a small piece of paper—Steve assumes what she needed the printer for—and hands it to him.
Tony looks up at his boyfriend, annoyed that Bucky’s attention is still on the ceiling fan rather than on him. Instead of putting his mouth back on Bucky’s cock, he climbs onto the couch next to him, and begins to place kisses on his chest, then on his abdomen, and finally one below his navel before he begins to lick the taut skin till he’s once again down to the base of Bucky’s dick. He does it slower this time, the way Bucky likes it, teasing the head by popping it in and out against his cheek. When he feels a hand slide into and grip his hair, Tony begins to further lower his head, only to suddenly yelp as he's yanked off.
“If you need to call someone, Tony, you can do it later. Besides, we haven’t spent time together in so long. I’m trying to make it up to you, sweetheart. Aren’t you going to say anything?” Steve moves forward to pull Tony into a hug, and begins to card his fingers through Tony’s hair the way he knows Tony likes it.
“And I totally bumped into him. I’m telling you Nat! It was Tony Stark and he looked absolutely out of it. I think I might have bruised his forehead.”
Tony groans in dismay, because Steve is the reason he’s here, and he’d much rather think about other things than sex with Steve.
“Listen, ma’am—” Steve starts again, but cuts himself off when the woman looks away from him, uninterested in his words as she digs into her pocket and pulls out a marker. Stepping forward, she uncaps the marker and grabs his wrist with a surprisingly firm grip.
Steve manages to withhold a laugh when Bruce angrily trudges through the sand, and watches Thor dodge a punch when the Aussie does burst out in laughter. He goes next, catching a similar wave to Bruce’s. He executes his small performance excellently, feeling quite satisfied when a group of women clap for him, their little contest seemingly gaining a small audience of beachgoers.
Still, he wasn’t always this popular. His career had been on a downward spiral until he’d signed with Waititi Sports, who’d managed to help him outshine previous mishaps in his surfing career while simultaneously popularizing the Thor brand. All they’d really told him to do though was cut his hair.
The cold has been biting him through his little hoodie and t-shirt since he’d left his apartment, but when he shivers, it’s because he wishes so badly that he could sink into the walls around him. His paranoia still running rampant, he supposes. He can’t quite piece together why it all feels so much more intensified this time.
“Come on, Tony, let’s get you to bed,” says the bot, sliding its arm under his shoulders, and Tony knows he’s supposed to feel comforted, but it just makes that ache grow.
back and forth from the shop to his bedroom. Wouldn’t be the first time he’s done the sideways tango on the floor, and it certainly won’t be the last.)
“Yeah, just give me a--” Tony pushes himself laboriously up from the console and promptly slides off of it with a grunt. JAC catches him of course, the fucking gentleman that it apparently is now. “Well, that’s not the first time that’s happened.”
"Are you asking me if I want to cuddle? Because the answer is definitely yes," says Tony without a second thought. "But I, uh, I don't think my legs are working yet. Sofa?"
Steve interrupts what's probably a dangerous train of thought: "Was that a new suit of armor I saw down there? Looked bigger than all your other ones."
He's interrupted by the chirping sound of JARVIS granting someone access to the workshop. There are heavy footsteps, and a voice calls out, "Stark? You down here? ...Tony?"
“Calling me fat, JARVIS? Low blow.” He shifts and says, a little nervously, “Doesn’t need to fit me--or anyone, really. I’m pushing it out of the nest. This baby eagle is gonna fly on its own.”
The fingers tighten suddenly in his hair and yank back to expose the column of his throat. It walks him back until his ass bumps against the console behind him. A strangled whine escapes him, eyes wide, half-panicked but too damn hard in his pants not to see this one through.
It's not like Iron Man turns him on, not really. He's popped a half-chub once or twice making breakthroughs on Mark II, but that's nothing new, totally natural, really, and he can't say he's ever looked at the armor itself and felt
“What, this?” asks Steve in feigned innocence, pressing a little harder and making Tony whine. He leaves his hand there and growls, “You’d better be good for me, Stark. Be good and let me use you.”
as you imagined. He would be so disgusted by this, Stark.” It laughs. “You should see yourself right now. You’re so pathetic.”
The robot shifts, and Tony can't help the noise that escapes him as he feels solid metal fingers press against the bulge in his jeans and squeeze. "It's more than that," Steve's voice muses. "He might not see the way you look at him, but JARVIS does, and by extension, so do I." The other hand raises to cup the back of Tony's head, fingers carding through his hair in a way that feels threatening. "Your feelings for this fellow are a mess, aren't they?"
On a whim, he grabs the corner of the schematic and scales it up so that it's seven feet tall, looking down at him with those glowing blue eyes.
created me to be so good at it… You're literally getting off on your own ego." It finally gets his pants open and Tony slumps over the console, lightheaded, dragging in a breath as the robot uses both hands to yank down his pants.
It takes him roughly nineteen hours and four cups of coffee to work out a successful simulation of an Iron Man suit that can walk, gesticulate, do Fortnite dances, and fuck like a rabbit without him inside of it pulling the strings. It takes him another six hours to develop the systems necessary for a retractable dildo like the one JAC 1.2 has along with a self-lubricating, self-cleaning fleshlight. He examines his handiwork, scouring for any details he may have missed. The face is like all his other suits: cold and impassive, with narrow eyes and a slit for a mouth. The body is similar in structure, but not in shape; he had asked JARVIS for those changes because he had something more androgynous in mind. He changes the color, making it a dark steel gray with accents of light blue.
at him as he finishes what Tony started and wraps his broad palm around Tony’s length, cutting off his gasp with a kiss. Like a jolt of electricity, a second wind of energy rushes through Tony’s system at the contact and before he can think, his hands are in Steve’s hair, his head tilting for a better angle. He sinks his teeth into Steve’s full lower lip, whimpers into his mouth as he strokes Tony off.
"By golly, is it that late already? Guess I should turn in for the night," says Tony loudly, checking his wrist for a watch he's not wearing.
Steve huffs a laugh that makes the corners of Tony’s mouth twitch up in a smile. At last, JAC’s dildo shifts back to its original size and it pulls out, eliciting a sharp noise from Tony as it goes. Steve watches with raised eyebrows as the dildo retracts back into the bot’s body, like it had never left. As JAC turns to leave, presumably to go get a towel, Steve’s eyes catch on something else and he frowns, stepping around to the other side of the table.
The tension vanishes from Steve’s face and he doesn’t let Tony finish, plunging back into Tony’s open mouth with a bit more force than before. He thrusts harder, JAC matching his pace almost perfectly. It’s a sensation Tony doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to, his insides feeling compressed like a coil with each pump. His fingers grip the edge of the table in the only semblance of control he has left. Dimly, he’s aware of JAC lifting his legs so his ankles rest over its shoulders. Though he can’t see Steve (well, his upper half, anyway) from this angle, he can just tell by lack of contact that the guy doesn’t seem to know what to do with his hands.
"Sir, the JAC prototype is ready. Also, you have now been awake for close to seventy-two hours, so I feel obligated to tell you to go to bed."
It regards him again and, despite him designing its face to be completely cold and impassive, he can tell it's thinking. He can see it in its eyes, the slight tilt of its head. It steps forward again, into his personal space, and leans in close. "How about this?" it asks, in an equally identical reproduction of Steve Rogers.
“Ms. Romanoff is in the library, Dr. Banner is in his laboratory, and Captain Rogers is in his private quarters, sir. Thor departed for New Mexico four hours ago and Mr. Barton is still away on his mission. It is currently four-fifty-three PM.”
When the second knot follows the first, he loses all comprehension of language. His vision whites out and, with a cry of Steve’s name, he spills ropes of cum on the floor. The dildo stills, and just when he's coming back to himself, Steve's voice growls low in his ear, "Did I say you could cum yet, Stark?"
“Call me old-fashioned,” Steve growls against Tony’s ear, giving him a squeeze, “but none of your machines can compare to the real thing.”
He tips his head back and scowls. "Jesus, Steve, what do you still have your pants on for?" he grumbles, reaching for Steve's waistband.
He doesn’t need to finish the thought. Tony grips the edge of the table and feels suddenly winded. He’s no longer a deer in the headlights, he’s fucking roadkill. “Hh,” he says, “how much did--what did you see?”
It's with great reluctance that he eventually has to smack Steve's thigh for air. Steve stays hunched over him as he catches his breath, apparently transfixed by something on his stomach. He doesn't realize Steve's other hand had been resting over the arc reactor until it moves, skimming down his torso to press gently, hesitantly, into his belly. JAC's dildo has reached its maximum size, but it's still fucking into Tony relentlessly, and he can feel the head of it pushing up to meet Steve's splayed hand through the skin like a heartbeat.
His system reboots and before he even registers that his mouth is moving, he's saying, "Are you--is this Loki? Or have I gone certifiably off the rails? Am I--"
It's then that Tony feels it: shifting inside of him, JAC's new dildo expands, just a bit, and Tony almost loses it right there, his toes curling at the sensation. The dildo plunges deeper and deeper with every thrust, and his asshole stings with the stretch. JAC grips his hips tighter and he focuses on the bruising pain of its grasp to keep from blowing his load as the dildo swells, little by little, inside of him. He’s glad Steve’s doing all the work up top; it’s all he can do just to keep his mouth open.
Tony is very inclined to agree, but looking at JAC over Steve’s shoulder, a sudden inspiration floats down from the heavens on a beam of angelic light. “You might be surprised there, Cap,” he says tightly. “JARVIS, wake up JAC.”
It releases his hair and he pants shakily as its hands roam down to his waist and push up the hem of his shirt. He shivers against the cool touch. “Did you just--override
He puzzles over the last one for a while, wondering just how human he should make this thing. Part of him thinks it would be sexier if it didn't speak--it would be several degrees less human, which thrills him, not to mention the idea of this thing making simulated sex noises makes him feel… uncomfortable to say the least. But what if he wants to engage with it? It's a known fact of his existence that he doesn't shut up during sex (or well, ever, really) unless his mouth is occupied, and the idea of making an endless stream of hilarious and sexy one-liners to something incapable of complimenting his tremendous wit makes something shrivel in his gut.
"JARVIS, you traitor," he mutters under his breath, but the tension in his gut unwinds a little. If it was Bruce, he'd have pieced together Tony's little project before he could say "don't kinkshame me." But Steve? He won't be able to tell a sexbot AI simulation from a game of Pac-man. He holds a finger to his lips at DUM-E and U, who both shift away inconspicuously, and calls out, "Yeah, over here, Cap."
“Yeah, no. And definitely no cuddling, sweetheart, the last thing I need is for one of them to find me being the little spoon for a tin can.” He taps the armor on JAC’s chest. “No offense.”
He vanishes for a while to brew some fresh coffee. When he comes back downstairs, he startles so bad he almost drops his mug.
Steve’s next few thrusts are a little bolder, his balls bumping against Tony’s nose--then he pulls out. It’s too soon, Tony still had a little while before he'd need air, but Steve is looking down at him with that adorable little furrow in his brow as Tony breathes in. He could reassure him, but that would be no fun. Tony knows if he wants to get pounded at both ends, he’s got to earn it. “I gotta ask, Cap,” he says, reaching up to give Steve’s cock a pull, “and I’m sure you get this a lot, but was it this big before the serum, or--?”
He’s exhausted, more so than he’s been in a long time, but he’s not too tired to murmur, “‘Course I did.”
He pulls off immediately, twisting his head to see Steve’s expression--and what a sight he is. His blond hair a little mussed, presumably from running a hand through it; his cheeks dark; his brows drawn and eyes closed; his parted lips looking so kissable that Tony aches for it. “I can’t tell if making Captain America swear is a terrible sin or a personal achievement,” he says, his voice hoarse and unsteady with the movement of JAC’s hips. “Do you think I can put it on my resume? Because
It feels surreal. It feels like a dream, and he has to pull back for a second to just look at Steve, look at his parted lips, his flushed face, his eyes a dark reflection of Tony's own need and desire lain bare between them. "Steve," he whispers. He has so many questions, what are they doing, does Steve have feelings for him or does he just want to bone, does
Giving it access to the internet for research purposes is a given, but Tony makes the executive decision to also grant it access to his own private Stark databases, files and personal information on himself and the people around him (as much as he's given access to, at least), as well as everything ever recorded by JARVIS here in Stark Tower and in Malibu. In order for it to take initiative and make decisions, it needs context and information--as much as he can provide.
Tony spends the following day walking funny and avoiding Steve, a task which turns out to be surprisingly easy since the guy seems to be alternating his time between the gym and his bedroom. He tries avoiding his workshop, too, but that lasts all of six hours before he gets bored doing… whatever normal people usually do, he guesses? Reading a book on quantum theory that’s always been on his backlog; trying to cook a square meal, failing, and ordering take-out; watching the news; it all feels very constructive for a while, and he thinks it’s helping him get a bit of fresh air so-to-speak after… that… and yeah, it kinda beats drinking himself into a pathetic, self-wallowing stupor, especially knowing that he won’t wake up the next day with a legendary hangover.
right now, Stark. I know everything about you. You like to act all high and mighty, but what you really want is for someone to put you in your place." Its big hands dig into his hip bones and it grinds viciously against him, its hard (much longer) length slotting against his. It leans into him and says in his ear, "That's what you made me to do, isn't it? To give you what you deserve."
Just for the hell of it, he adds an armature with a self-lubricating, pressure-changing ring on the end, auto-programmed to beat it like it owes him money.
Steve gives JAC an actual once-over and looks back at Tony, and his expression--it's thoughtful, almost devious, he obviously wants to see Tony made undone, but it's also… longing. It's clear from the look on his face alone that he
A shiver runs down Tony's spine that's definitely from the lack of sleep, and not from… something else. "Is that a promise?"
Look, it’s not that weird, okay? Everybody thinks about it. Well, everybody who builds robots, Tony guesses. Okay, everybody who builds robots and spends more time with said robots than other humans.
Still lifeless, of course, the AI is far from complete, but Tony has always had an active imagination. He runs his fingers along the smooth metal plates of its arm, touches the fingers almost reverently. Its hands are broad. There are less armor plates on JAC since it’s not built for combat, leaving cords and cables showing like toned muscles. “We did real good on this one, JARVIS,” he murmurs. Louder, he asks, “Did you test the tensile strength? Dexterity? Lift capacity?”
"We're definitely gonna have some fun with that next time." The two of them shift together, Tony making himself comfortable in the crook of Steve's shoulder. "I mean, assuming this isn't a one-time thing. If it is, I can work with that--wouldn't be--"
He sucks in a lungful of air, head tipping back bonelessly over the edge of the table, honestly surprised that his poor, abused throat still knows how to open his airway. Steve--super-soldier, serum-enhanced, peak-of-human-perfection Steve--is similarly spent, panting above him, a sheen of sweat on his forehead. "Holy shit, Tony," he whispers reverently. Tony thinks vaguely that this might be the proudest he's ever felt, and that's saying something.
A shadow seems to fall over them as JAC steps up next to Steve, who has to tilt his head back to meet the bot’s eyes. The image of Steve having to look up at someone is really doing something for the tent in Tony's pants, but the poetic justice of it is short-lived as JAC looks down at Steve, arms crossed, then back at Tony, and says in Steve’s voice, “So, are you going to demonstrate the latest Stark tech to the good Captain here?”
"I should've guessed you don't wear underwear," Steve mutters as soon as his pants are free from his waist. Tony's sure there's a joke about the Howling Commandos in there somewhere.
“So, did the Howling Commandos really go Commando, or…?” Okay, so the joke is pretty late, but he was a little occupied earlier.
He rolls over, away from JAC, and hears its footsteps recede. They return moments later and he feels a blanket drape over him.
of the phrases he taught it when he’s just taken the second knot and is drooling on the floor. (Yes, he tests it out in the workshop like a goddamn animal. He’s got five other Avengers living in his tower, there’s no way he’s going to cart a
The lack of consistent oxygen is making his head light and his body relaxed. He feels dizzy in the best way, and for a moment, the table seems to vanish beneath him and he’s left floating, anchored only by the two cocks bucking into him. He almost forgets how to breathe by the time Steve pulls out again, but then his lungs spasm and he comes crashing back to earth.
Between the information that's being dumped into it and the state-of-the-art Stark voice-synthesizer, the dialogue and speech options are endless. He could play out a fantasy of fucking Betty White if he wants to.
Tony twists to look at him and can see his ears turning pink even in the dim light. "Really, Steve, with the blushing? You're killing me."
Tony needs a moment to recalibrate at that. "I'm sorry, did--did you, did Captain Steve Rogers, just make a joke? And
For as pent up as he is, it doesn’t take long for Steve to catch up. When he cums, he’s balls-deep down Tony’s throat, with a guttural moan and his hand clamped so hard around Tony’s windpipe that he almost passes out. He has enough wherewithal to swallow, at least--practically a basic instinct at this point--and Steve only hesitates a moment to pull out.
He feels JAC’s hands settle firmly in the hollows of his hips as it picks up the pace, just a little. The shape of the new dildo isn't nearly as intense as the last one, but Tony has no doubt JAC will want to test out the new features before the night is done. Plus, he doesn't want to get too distracted from his task; he's determined to make Steve cum before him. “It’s okay,” says JAC, presumably to Steve, “he can take it.”
“Uh,” says Tony again, feeling like God just turned on the brights. “It’s--you know, it’s just a new prototype, I’m experimenting with a few dif--”
He starts to pant raggedly, sweat beading across his skin as JAC rocks slowly into him, the dildo sinking gradually deeper and deeper. Tony is immensely grateful that it at least has enough restraint to start gentle, but that only lasts a minute before it gets bolder, thrusting a little harder, gripping him a little tighter. By the time the first knot is slamming against his hole, he’s a fucking mess, and his internal monologue is a non-stop stream of
Steve levels Tony with a look to match the AI's tone, and Tony feels distinctly ganged up on. "Has it been thirteen hours already? Could've sworn I just had some Lucky Charms for dinner--"
"Yes, please." As JAC retreats, Tony remarks to Steve, "I suppose if this," he gestures at the two of them, "is going to be a thing, I won't really need him around, huh?"
"Your pupils dilated," it says, still with that voice, and of course Tony's body betrays him as he feels all the blood in his head migrate south so rapidly that it leaves him dizzy. "Your pulse spiked, and the temperature in your groin just increased. You programmed me to sense these changes, Tony. You can't deny to me that hearing this voice in this context turns you on."
“I’m looking at this all wrong,” he announces when he returns from the bathroom with his pants back on. “It’s too impersonal. It’s efficient, but it’s not
That’s what he keeps telling himself--over and over, like he’s practicing for an interview--as he designs this thing.
Tony does laugh at that, bitterly. "Yeah, right. You said it yourself, he, uh. Well, I don't think he could look at me the same. I don't even think I can look at
Hearing it say both "slut" and “fuck” in Steve’s voice shouldn’t be as hot as it is. "If I am, then I'm doing a damn good job," he gasps.
As his mouth roams back up Steve’s shaft and his tongue swirls around the head, he hears a soft, “Oh ff… fuck…”
Speaking of, Steve is making the most delightful noises--quiet, breathy grunts with each forward snap of his hips. Tony can tell he's finally starting to lose himself in it and feels a sense of pride bubbling up in his chest.
Tony sits patiently, watching Steve’s expression carefully while he wipes the rivulets of lube off his ass and inner thighs. “I gotta ask,” he says, “was that your first time? Because to be honest, I’d always assumed you were a virgin.”
JAC shows up then, and Tony feels a little twinge of guilt that he'd completely forgotten about the bot. It drapes a blanket over the two of them, the same one it had brought for Tony the night before.
catch them, but he can't stop himself from making direct eye contact with it as he braces his hands against the console and pushes his own hips forward to meet it. "You know, for a guy with no balls, you talk pretty b--”
“One of them did,” says Steve with a glint in his eye as Tony finishes pulling his pants up to his waist. He can probably guess which one. “Um. Did you want to go back to your bedroom, or…?"
Steve grabs him by the wrists again and silently twists Tony's hands away from their target. When he's released, he doesn't go for it a second time. With one hand, Steve tugs his erection free from his sweatpants and starts stroking; with the other, he hooks a thumb in Tony's jaw, the pad pressing up into his tongue. Tony’s mouth opens obediently as Steve guides his cock into it.
Steve looks taken aback for a moment, even hesitantly releases Tony's wrists, but quickly recovers: “That’s what it sounded like to me,” he says slyly.
He’s seen what’s on the market for sexbots nowadays, and even the most advanced ones just don’t really appeal to him. They’re incredibly well-crafted, and some of them have AIs that could rival JARVIS, but he’s just not interested in creating a near-perfect reproduction of another human. It’s too… safe. Not his style at all.
He glances over at Tony, who suddenly feels like a sick, perverted deer in the headlights of God himself. “Uh,” he says, setting down his coffee before the sweat collecting on his palms can drop it for him, “hi?”
JAC keeps thrusting, so Tony cups his hands behind Steve’s ass to pull him close again and licks hungrily down the underside of his cock, his panting breath ghosting over it. If Steve was at all soft before, he’s definitely not now. Tony's own cock is pressing flush against his stomach and he can't tell if he's leaking precum or if it's just sweat. He digs his fingers indulgently into the meat of Steve’s ass as he cranes his head back, sucking one of his balls into his mouth and drawing a short, sweet moan from him. His breathing is ragged now and Tony’s only regret as his tongue laves over Captain America’s taint is that he can’t see his perfect face.
Tony looks up with a smile that Steve knows belongs to him and no one else, and they hold each other’s gaze for that infinite moment that lasts just a second but never fails to take Steve breath right away. and just like that Tony brings his attention back to his book and the moment is broken leaving Steve to blink back a wave of impossible emotions that only Tony can make him feel.
“Run away with me, angel,” Tony says in a quiet a little whisper that never fails to make Steve’s toes curl.
Steve takes a look around the small apartment filled with his and Tony’s things — Steve’s because, well, he lives here, and Tony’s because it’s impossible to make him stop leaving his stuff everywhere he goes, so Steve has just accepted he’s bound to find at least one pair of Tony’s silly sunglasses in every one of his drawers, and also a surprising amount of animal printed socks under his furniture — and thinks back to all the time and effort they’ve put into turning this place, earth, a home for the both of them.
“Let’s go off together,” Tony whispers, his eyes studying Steve’s face with a sort of focus that does all sorts of funny things to Steve’s insides. “The stars are waiting for us.”
Either way, Steve knows that for as long as they’ve known each other Tony has spent a lot of that time feeling some sort of love for him.
“Steve! Steve— Steven, angel! Listen, we gotta hurry, the old lady with the terrible breath is coming over, she’s got an entire album of her smelly family to show you! We can still make a run for it if we leave now.”
Their conflicting natures often puts their relationship under test, Tony will get testy and push Steve’s boundaries until he snaps. Steve tends to be either infinitely patient and forgiving of Tony’s moods, which upsets him in a way Steve can’t quite understand, or he can let Tony goad him into a prickly enough mood that will make him fight back, always a little too caulous and a lot too sincere, which also always ends up upsetting Tony in worst ways Steve thinks possible.
Steve steps towards Tony, a bit of the apprehension draining from his expression. “Enough,” he says, in a tone of voice that Tony feels is far too casual for this topic of discussion. It drops to something considerably more dangerous and undeniably seductive as he adds, stepping into Tony's personal space, "Why didn't you tell me you wanted me to bend you over a table, Stark?"
Tony pauses. “A new AI system.” Not a lie. “Just making a backup in case anything happens to JARVIS.” Okay, that one’s a lie. He shudders to think what would happen if he set JAC loose on the building controls. Although, if he could clear the rest of the team out for a few nights, it might be fun--
“You watch--? Okay, we’re putting a pin in that one, because I definitely want to know more about your porn search history later--”
Steve returns with the ring while JAC is still working him open. "Thank God, I won't last five minutes without this thing," Tony mutters as Steve reaches over him, upside-down from Tony's perspective, to help roll it down to the base of his dick.
“I saw you last night,” Steve cuts him off. “I came down to check on you and the doors were unlocked, but you were…”
"You've always wanted this, haven't you? Even before you met him,” says Steve’s voice behind him, cold and cruel. “The idea of debauching Captain America himself, it's always turned you on, but especially now that he's out of the ice, and exactly as upstanding and
His first rendition is based on those four-hundred-dollar dildo machines, but with some added flair. Self-lubricating and self-adjusting, with fully customizable voice commands and a safeword kill-switch (he goes with “shawarma”). Designing the dildo was a whole chore by itself; after taking precarious notes and splurging a little on materials for making silicone molds, he sculpts his own dildo based on what he likes, and experiments with a few different features. The self-lubrication was easy enough to achieve by attaching a friction-activated pressure pump to his own replication of Bad Dragon’s cumtube technology. He even adds a “Bust-A-Nut” feature--at a voice command of his choosing (take a guess), the device will empty its remaining supply of lube into the orifice of his choosing. And of course, he’s always liked the knotted toys, so he gives his two for good measure and makes them inflatable.
Tony turns his head to lay against Steve's chest, listening to his heartbeat. "For someone who's pretty new at this, you really nailed the whole dominance thing, by the way."
There’s a familiar mechanical whirr as DUM-E turns to look at him, then rolls away for a mop. It feels exhibitionistic, and not in the fun way, to have them around and, in U’s case, actively watching. It reminds him of when he was a teenager and the dog walked in once while he was doing the five-knuckle shuffle. The dog didn’t know what he was looking at, just wagged his tail a couple times and left, but it was uncomfortable enough to make him start closing his bedroom door whether his parents were home or not.
“We’re not--I’m not doing the walk of shame back to my own bedroom, c’mon. I don’t even know what time it is. JARVIS, where is everyone? Who’s still awake right now?”
Steve kisses the way he fights: earnestly, straightforward, and with immense force. All of Tony’s lingering concerns that this might somehow be one-sided fly out the window, up into the sky, and through a portal into another world at the way Steve opens for him, all teeth and tongue; the way his hands grab and hold on to Tony like he’ll vanish if he lets go. It feels like hand-to-hand combat, like both of them are fighting, clawing at each other, each trying to impart their feelings as physically as possible. Tony knows he’s lost the battle when he feels Steve’s fingers curl in his hair and pull back, drawing a stuttering gasp from him. Steve’s mouth roves hungrily over his exposed throat. As a last stand, his hands snake around to grab two fistfuls of Steve’s ass through his sweatpants and
"Not until you brush your teeth," Steve says, absently washing the pot he'd used. "And you'd better clean your plate, or you're not getting dessert."
Like a fresh, born-again virgin, Tony cums almost as soon as his dick is in Steve’s mouth, and he’s rewarded with the sight of him swallowing like a fucking champ. The white light of the arc reactor outlines Steve's cheeks where they hollow, and highlights from a blue hologram catch in his eyes. Tony feels dizzy in the afterglow, sitting back on his hands as his erratic heart finally starts to settle down. “You know--I was kind of skeptical--about your whole schtick,” he huffs between breaths, running a hand through Steve’s hair. “Captain America, the hero who protects the innocent, punches nazis, and reciprocates oral. But now I definitely see it.”
Actually, it might be an external monologue. And if he says Steve's name into the console a few times, well, that's nobody's business but his and JAC's.
And he does. Steve fucks his face like it’s a fleshlight, one hand on his navel, the other clamped around his throat. His grunts are the loudest in Tony’s ears, audible proof of how well he’s doing. When he needs a break, he uses the time to worship Steve’s cock the way it deserves: with genuine enthusiasm and as much of his mouth as he can spare.
After he does a couple trial runs and cums hands-free for the seventh and eighth times in his life, he draws the following conclusion: the voice control is too clunky. He should’ve seen it coming, really; it’s hard to think of, much less say, “speed up” or “bust a nut” or
Ugh, “dildo machine.” It sounds so… primitive, not at all what he’s going for. But “sex robot” isn’t much better. Maybe he can come up with an acronym for it, like JARVIS. Just A Rather Sexy… Intelligent System… JARSIS? Okay, it’s a work in progress.
Steve shifts a little, seems to hesitate. "I dunno," he says casually. "I think I could get used to having him around."
Steve Rogers picks his way through the workshop until he's in sight, regarding Tony with a neutral expression. "Tony, it's three in the morning," he states. He doesn't sound angry, but there's stern, fatherly disappointment in there somewhere. He's wearing sweatpants and a white tank top damp with sweat and clinging to his torso in ways that should be criminalized. Tony notes, with an odd sense of endearment, that his feet are bare. It's no secret by now that Steve gets about as much rest as Tony these days; his super-soldier metabolism keeps him up late, and he can usually be found abusing the Stark Tower Fitness Center in the early hours of the morning.
"Whoa, okay, where did you synthesize that voice from, huh, JAC? What, are you--did you pull that straight from Pornhub?"
The eyes and arc reactor flicker on first, glowing that LED white-blue that Tony is so familiar with. "Good morning--or, I think. Morning, night, whatever." It doesn't seem to have heard him. Its head turns a little, its hand lifts, fingers wiggling experimentally. It turns, stepping around him, and he watches it examine its surroundings. "Uh, where you going there, buddy?" It doesn't answer. It taps a console, spins the hologram display that appears at the contact; it takes in the cars along the back wall, the line of other (smaller) suits, the glass case memorializing Tony's first arc reactor; and it waves at DUM-E, who lifts his arm in interest in an exchange that Tony can't decide is touching or concerning.
He's just starting to get hard again when he feels JAC's knots swell and a cool rush as it unloads deep inside him. It bends down over him, the cold weight a comforting presence against his overstimulated nerves. Its hands rub soothingly up his sides and down his thighs, tenderly massaging the muscles. “You did good,” it says softly in his ear.
Steve laughs and plants a kiss on his inner thigh. “I have a reputation to uphold,” he says, standing. JAC chooses that moment to step into view, holding a wet towel, which Steve takes.
Then, finally, it turns and looks at him. "Tony Stark," it says, and he almost says the safeword right then and there, because this robot has no business sounding so sultry. He feels like he should be delivering a pizza with extra sausage.
Tony glances to the lounge area of the workshop and gives a half-hearted shrug. He hoists up his pants and together they hobble to the sofa, where he flops down gracelessly. JAC remains standing next to him, looking like it doesn't know what to do with itself. "What, do you want a bedtime story?" Tony grouses. "We're done, go power down."
When he finally finishes programming, he leans back in his chair and simply watches for a while, idly sipping coffee as JAC analyzes and integrates all the information it's being given. "What's he thinkin' about, JARVIS?" Tony asks.
He's cut off by Steve crushing his mouth against his. Tony opens for the kiss immediately; he would have to be actually certifiably off the rails not to succumb instantly to what he's wanted for so long.
"You, primarily," JARVIS responds. "That is what you created it for, sir. Currently it's importing all the recordings you gave it from SHIELD's helicarrier and analyzing your interactions with your teammates."
has enough discretion to keep it off of SHIELD’s radar. The last thing he needs is One-Eyed Willy finding his Bad Dragon order history and process notes on what specific shapes and angles hit his prostate the best.
Just when his lungs are starting to burn, Steve pulls out, and Tony heaves in a massive breath. He forgoes words this time, just grabs one of Steve’s hands in his own and guides it to his bare throat. It stays there, a warm, firm collar, as Steve sinks back in. At first, it sits inert, snug around the cords of his neck, just feeling the movement of his own dick under the skin. Then it squeezes, and Tony feels as though his windpipe has simply ceased to exist, effectively crushed between Steve's broad palm and thrusting cock.
The hand isn't in his hair anymore but it doesn't matter--as JAC starts pounding into him again, he is completely boneless against the smooth glass of the console, nothing but a vessel. He might be crying. It's hard to tell, there's just a lot of… fluids.
He experiences a moment of relief as his cock springs free before JAC is on him again, one hand clamped solidly around his hip and the other in his hair, forcing his head down against the console. "Shut up, slut," says the bot simply, in a tone that almost sounds bored. The dildo is pressed against his bare ass now, wet with lube but still catching delightfully against his skin. “Hey, if you’re Iron Man, does that mean you’re fucking yourself right now?” JAC asks.
JAC suddenly grabs him and twists him around, and before he can process what's happening, the bot has both arms around him: one hand pressing into his throat, the other grappling at the buckle of his belt. He can feel the bulge of its dildo pressing tantalizingly against his ass. His trapped cock aches.
Tony winces a little. Not his best day, thanks to that scepter. He's glad they're all on better terms.
"...Very well, sir." Tony's best calculator couldn't quantify the amount of long-suffering contained in those three words.
"Believe it or not, Stark, I do have a sense of humor," he remarks, with a playful glance over his shoulder. Are his ears turning pink, or is that Tony’s imagination?
He wishes he could say that writing the AI is easy after writing JARVIS, but JARVIS has been a work in progress ever since his conception years ago. Tony has records, sure, but he can’t remember what tweaks he added each year or why they needed to be done. Fortunately, he is able to examine and review any part of JARVIS that he wants and import whole chunks of code he’s already slaved over.
He doesn’t even realize JAC left until the bot returns with a warm, damp towel to wipe down Tony’s ass and legs. “Can you walk?” it asks quietly.
He should probably stop to sleep, rest up while JAC's in the oven, but there's more to be done. Having the bot ready is one thing, but that AI is going to need a massive overhaul. It has to learn how to use all its new parts, how to read what Tony wants through body language, emotive cues, and shared dialogue.
This slightly flawed, slightly more human rendition of JAC seems to know a little less about what it’s doing, and in that regard, does a much better job. It takes its time, intermittently thrusting languidly and pounding Tony into the ground. He almost forgets about the inflatable knots until he feels them swell against his prostate and cums immediately and gracelessly. For the fourth time, he’s left drooling on the floor, his mind reeling from the afterglow for what JARVIS later confirms was twelve minutes.
Tony groans as, with a particularly rough thrust, the first knot pops in. His asshole is ruthlessly abused as JAC continues to thrust like a jackhammer, absolutely not giving a single fuck when the knot catches on Tony's rim with each backwards pull.
The hand disappears from his hip and reappears at his ass, spreading it as the head of the dildo presses hungrily against Tony’s asshole. He did take a moment to clean out before bringing JAC to life, but he didn’t get a chance to stretch himself, assuming that that would be part of the foreplay. JAC, however, doesn’t seem interested in such courtesies; he feels more lube ooze out of the head of the dildo as it pushes determinedly against Tony until the tapered head glides in and he has to bite back a moan.
“What if it could be?” he retorts, a gleam in his eye as he hops up to the central console. There’s only one way to do it, really. The mechanical armatures are fun to tinker and mess around with, fun for a prototype, but the only way to cross the bridge from masturbation to sex is to get someone else involved. Or, so-to-speak.
No, no, he's looking at it all wrong again. He can't program it to do one or the other, he has to teach it how and when to do either and give it the initiative to choose for itself. Of course, programming something to take initiative is easier said than done, and before he knows it, the egg timer dings.
He’s cut off as Steve yanks him back into place by his hair and barely has time to draw air before his cock is down his throat again. There's no time for fancy tricks or techniques as Steve fucks his face in earnest, his balls slapping against Tony's face.
Steve breaks the kiss to lick and bite a line down Tony’s neck, his collarbone, his chest--Steve pauses to plant a kiss in the center of the arc reactor--his stomach--
“JARVIS, leave the doors to the workshop unlocked,” JAC commands smoothly. Quieter, to Tony, it says, “You love the idea that someone might catch us, don’t you? Someone like Steve, maybe.”
It doesn't take too long before JAC is looking more like it's supposed to, and JARVIS announces, "I believe it's ready, sir. Might I recommend running some test simulations with a virtual--"
And listen, the media loves playing up the whole womanizer schtick, but more often than not he ends up at the nine-person bondage gangbang tied to a bed with a ball gag in his mouth. He's tried about everything under the sun and had enough dicks and strap-ons in his ass to rival Ancient Greece. Ye Olde Heterosexual Missionary Style is still a treasured classic, of course, but life is too short
Strangely, Steve looks a little nervous himself. “Hi,” he returns. “Do you, um.” He draws in a shaky breath, lets it out, seems to think better of what he’s saying. “What’s this one for?” he asks insead, gesturing to JAC.
"I've thought about this, you know," says Steve, and there's a strained quaver to his voice that gives Tony a rush of satisfaction. "Every time we're on a mission and you get too mouthy. Thought about just shutting you up like this." That is unbelievably hot. Thinking of Steve, in the middle of life-or-death combat, imagining different ways to occupy Tony's smartass mouth--maybe next time they could find an abandoned building close by. Tony can picture it, him flipping up his faceplate, Steve forcing him down on his knees, still in uniform--
"JARVIS, I'll learn a lot more about how this thing ticks by getting my hands dirty. Come on, snap snap."
"You're welcome." Tony starts to wonder if it's developed some kind of attachment to using Steve's voice. To Tony, it asks, "Should I power down for the night?"
Steve huffs a small laugh and, after a beat, says, "To answer your question, yes, it was that big before the serum."
It's a vicious feedback loop: the more he's into it, the more ashamed he feels, which only turns him on more. He hates how much he loves it.
“JARVIS, pull up the schematics for Mark III,” he says. A life-size hologram of the Mark III armor appears before him, outlined in glowing blue and rotating slowly. He stares at it for a moment, gears turning. “Make it more streamlined. Narrow the shoulders. Broaden the hips a little. The limbs don’t need to have that much meat, neither does the torso.”
His back arches into the sensation and he sucks in a breath. “Fuck, fuck, Steve--I’m gonna cum if you keep doing that--”
Okay, yeah, is it really that weird that he's turned on by his friend and colleague who also happens to be a total beefcake with the bone structure of a Greek god, and who also happens to be able to bodily lift him--suit and all--and throw him around like an old chew toy, and who also happens to be a symbol of purity and moral backbone who's probably never taken anything up his perfectly sculpted ass ever? Is it that weird to try to imagine what kind of breathy moans he'd make in Tony's ear, or how he'd grunt while he fucks? Is it really that weird-- “Okay, sue me, Steve is hot,” he says, his mouth suddenly dry.
Steve appears over him, tugging at the waist of his pants, and he lifts his hips to help. "JARVIS, a little mood lighting?" The lights in the workshop dim until only the blue and orange from the holograms and display cases outline Steve's figure, contouring every muscle and plane of his face in a dichotomy of warm and cool.
"As confessions of love go, this one is pretty unconventional," Tony says quietly, laying his hand over Steve's. "But for what it's worth, I. Um. I like you, too. And not just because you're, you know, stacked and have a huge dick."
It regards him for a moment. "Is this better?" it asks, and Tony almost chokes, because the new voice is a perfect replication of Pepper Potts.
He stares at it dumbly for a moment before lifting his eyes to behold his savior. Steve is standing on the other side of the table, watching Tony with a bemused expression.
But it’s there on the edge of his mind, impossible to avoid, much less forget. It’s not even the memory that’s keeping his mind busy, it’s looking forward: his endlessly tinkering brain, constantly analyzing, trying to tell his hands to get down there and tweak a few things in JAC’s construction and programming. The knots were fun, but what if he makes it less textured and focuses on size instead? He’s been fiddling with nanotech lately, he could pretty easily develop a dildo that changes size and shape mid-coitus. And the programming--it’s pretty elegant, but he should probably adjust and test out the algorithm a little, to make sure the bot doesn’t try the same thing every time. As hot as all that was, every healthy masturbation routine needs a little variation.
"I think so? It's kinda like picking up a big cat," says Steve lightly. The sofa is enormous, one of those big sectionals, and he lays Tony down in the cuddle corner like a gentleman before climbing in next to him.
He’s back downstairs before he knows it, feeling less shame than he deserves as he works on the new dildo idea. It’s relaxing--something structural and technical for his hands to do to soothe his restless mind. Giving it the ability to change size and length at his command (or, rather, at JAC’s) is a little tricky, but he manages it. Several extra sections of code are required to give JAC the ability to wield this new weapon properly.
“You get rid of incompetence. Preferably before it spreads. One useless cocksucker spreads like AIDs from…”
Steve can’t help but choke out a laugh at what he gets out of context. “You bruised Tony Stark’s forehead?”
He can keep his eyes squeezed shut and listen to the sound of Steve’s baritone voice and will this all away, pretend that this isn’t happening to him. Hope it’s just some wild illusion. And while he can’t convince himself that this is a dream, he can falsely force himself to believe that
The man, even behind his mask, looks surprised at Tony, if only for a moment. “You’re quite the realist.” He says.
In the moments before he’d stepped forward into the light, Tony had three things running through his mind. The first—he’d quite obviously just spent the last half hour with the ever-infamous
Tony isn’t really having the best time. He stands in a small, uninteresting circle consisting of himself, his father, Lucien Stone, and Lucien’s son, Tiberius Stone. There’s an obvious tension between Lucien and Howard that makes Tony rolls his eyes behind his golden mask. Their stupid rivalry had gotten old a long time ago, and the hate between the two of them is obvious. Almost everyone who keeps up with business news thinks that both Howard and Lucien must get off on their weird obsession with comparing dick sizes every time they’re in the same space. It’s tiring, and even more so when he has to constantly tell Ty Stone that he’s not interested in getting together for…anything really.
also, my updating is pretty sporadic on a regular basis, but I’m moving next week so if I don’t update sooner than later that’s why!
“Unimportant. I need you. I need it. Now.” He ignores the way Bucky, suddenly amused, raises an eyebrow at his demanding tone, and Tony really can’t find it in himself to care, nor can he help himself from yanking Bucky by the hair so he can lean in and press their mouths together.
“All right.” Steve speaks up again, not wanting to hear the end of whatever Bruce is going to say. “I’ve got an idea. How ‘bout a competition?”
He gets to work immediately. The two halves of the stencil are smaller versions of what he’d used on the outside of the building. He paints the image onto each of the four walls, and signs his tag—
With easier access to the surfer lifestyle, he’d gotten a palm-tree tattoo within his first week of living in Malibu, and has since surfed every notable beach on the Southern California coastline. Steve lives to surf, and loves getting a reaction from people when he tells them he’s from New York, of all places.
They tangle their arms around each other, and Tony doesn’t stop Steve from kissing him as he begins to earnestly put his all into short thrusts and happy moans.
“Fuck. Sorry. Is it bad if I ask you for directions—I’m here for the security briefing for the event? It’s a one time thing and I don’t really know my way,” The man motions to the area behind Tony. “around here.”
Tony has his hands comfortably placed behind his head. His knees are bent, and his legs are spread appropriately.
It’s been pretty chill as of late though, the WSL Championship Tour had come to it’s conclusion last month, and Bruce is back in his home town of Malibu to get in some casual wave riding before he’s back with his coach on his strict training regimen and looking for more sponsorships.
One is the man who can relentlessly fuck him senseless and ruin him with a fervent sense of depravity.
And before she can call him a dumbass, he speaks up again. “How many times are you going to come here and not buy art supplies.” It’s no question, because she does this at least once every few days. Steve appreciates the company of a friend, even if only for a little bit during his day, and he doesn’t have to tell that to Nat. She knows, she shows up. Steve appreciates her ways of knowing.
He rings up her chocolate bar anyway, slides it across the counter, and watches her bite at the plastic before using her hands to tear it open.
That reason alone is enough motivation for Tony to slip into one of the seats in front of surveillance monitor and go about erasing the extent of the night’s footage for the entire floor that he and Nomad had been on, not before making a copy of the feed for his own suspicions.
Howard Stark. Everyone here is running the world. We’re in a room filled with the top one percent of the one percent, and you’re talking about idealism? The elite don’t thrive on wishful thinking. I’m certain you didn’t get here with a little wishful thinking.”
Tony was forced to use his personal access codes instead, and that’s how he’d ended up stumbling across something he evidently wasn’t supposed to see.
Tony still doesn’t know who this man is, but seconds after the words are uttered, the two of them are paired together, still somewhat secluded in their spot next to the Bösendorfer, swaying back and forth to the sound of the music flowing in from outside.
“I got caught.” He says simply. Nat squints and Bucky sits up, the tension in the room rising tenfold.
So suddenly that Tony can almost taste the desperation to get away in the air. He’s left alone on the floor, Nomad’s bag along with him. It smells strongly of paint, and it takes a moment for Tony to gather his bearings.
Steve attempts to pull away, but she nor his wrist even budge. His eyes widen a bit in shock at how strong she is, but she speaks up before he can further express himself about it. “A client of mine’s boyfriend just got the shit kicked out of him by Hydra. Disbanded my ass. He’s in the ER and I’m getting paid to find out who exactly put him there. You obviously know something, but you aren’t talking now. You will. Call this number when you have something useful on Hydra.”
He can’t see the grin on Bucky’s face, but he can hear Steve’s hitched breath and the sound of him sliding out of the chair and padding over to the two of them.
“What if he was being honest with you? He might not have told Stark anything. The security footage, well we knew that would be a problem. It’s why the mask stayed on.” Bucky continues, and Steve can’t help but think the way he sounds so genuinely hopeful is rather off-putting.
speaking of new characters, anyone guess Jess Jones before i mentioned her name? (i think it was pretty obvious lol)
He’d gotten large with the help of support from popular activists—through viral posts on different sites and so on. His first big hit—the stencil he’s sprayed on the building to the right of NY’s very own Trump Tower, had been
