, it made Steve’s insides clench and squirm, having such a nasty smile being directed at him.  Directed at him by Tony.
Tony was so tired that he almost believed him; almost believed that he could have this, this pure, plain happiness that Steve promised him, that he would ever be worthy of such a gift.
Steve thought, but the words didn’t leave his lips.  He heaved a sigh, trying to formulate his thoughts properly through his muddled shock, confusion, and bitter guilt.  “I just--first of all, I’m sorry.”
Natasha merely raised an eyebrow at them, but when she rose from the breakfast bar to fetch herself some coffee, she pressed a quick, barely there kiss to his cheek, whispering a fond idiot as she went.  Both Rhodey and Clint let out a cackling laugh when they saw them, but it was Clint who congratulated Tony on scoring a piece of that “100% All American Ass”.  Thor sent him (and Steve) sputtering when slapped them both on the back, glad that they finally “as Jane says, gotten your heads out of your asses”.  Bruce, well, Bruce came up for coffee and a handful of granola bars, then shuffled back down to his lab.
Thor had gone off to New Mexico to stay with Jane, and Clint, Natasha and Steve went off to SHIELD right after Shawarma.  Bruce had stayed with Tony that night, but then returned to SHIELD the next day.
It’s not like he hadn’t thought about it, because he had, of course he had, his dad slapped him across the face on all days ending in y, and he’d been thrown into high school at too young an age, too young for his own good, then shipped off to college because, yeah, he wanted to go but seriously he was fifteen and he was a kid, a fucking kid at college parties getting blackout drunk and high on weed laced with who knows what, who knew what and god, god.
Later that day, when Steve has grasped onto some form of coherence, Natasha turns to him before she steps into the elevator that’ll take her back to the quinjet.
Of course, though, he’d been oh so fashionably late for the Avengers’ meeting with Fury one Thursday afternoon, and had flung the doors open right as Fury was discussing the team’s living accommodations.
Steve was wide eyed now, cocking his head at Tony.  Tony merely shrugged.  Steve had usually gone for his run and made it back after Tony’d managed to collect himself from the pantry every other time this happened.  Today he just happened to get lucky.
But this, this was different.  The others had told him that they’d seen Tony in the common floor, whether for food or coffee, or leaving for a meeting.  It was just Steve that he was very carefully and purposely avoiding.
Slowly, Tony reached into his coat and pulled out a single white lily, and laid it atop the smooth granite.  The stood in silence, but it wasn’t tense.  Instead it was comforting, soothing.
you, J,” Tony singsonged, and the AI shut it.  “But no, yeah, the human Jarvis of course.  She only knew a few real dishes, but what she did know…it was great.”
With strangled, sputtering movements, he dug through one of his chest of drawers, mostly full of unfinished projects, hoping for something, anything, hoping for--
Steve’s head shot up, now grinning at Natasha, who had moved across the kitchen to make herself a cup of tea.  She turned to him, blinking.
into Fury’s office might be putting it harshly.  But it might also be the most accurate description.
Tony leaned his head into Steve’s chest, at which the man sighed, wrapping his firm arms around him, head digging into the crook of Tony’s neck.
Doctor Doom still sent out his bots to wreak havoc on New York, low level supervillains created giant mutant moose or flying robotic slugs or whatthefuckever.  But there were no alien invasions, no visits from Loki.  Just your average, daily superheroing.
Inside, the house wasn’t fairing much better than the outside of the establishment.  The place reeked of beer and heavy smoke, along with, well, the stench of sex.  It was thick in the air, buried in between the cracks and crevices of the worn couch cushions, lingering along the cards and chips that drunkards at the tables used to play poker and rummy.
“‘Night...but Steve, really?  You think I meant myself?  Stark can pull the baggy eyed, disheveled look on a good day, but you?  Not so much.”
Finally, Tony paused, turning toward him with a wicked grin.  Steve’s mouth was gaping, in too much shock and confusion to so much as close his jaw.  “Or, I should say,
Tony awoke with a start; everything flooding back to him all at once.  Bright light in his eyes, harsh beeping in his ears, the pressure of an IV in his arm.
“So I’m supposed to think you got dizzy, couldn’t breathe, and just started apologizing to Cap over and over again because…?  What, did you insult the Dodgers earlier today or something?”  Clint was smirking now, an eyebrow raised, but the worry hadn’t washed out from his eyes.
“Maybe you just can’t help me.  Maybe no one can.  Maybe I’m too fucked up to be unravelled.  What do you want me to tell you, Steve?  That my dad beat my every day since the day I could talk back to him?  That I got piss ass drunk every fucking night in high school when I was twelve?  That I used to do
I hope you guys liked this chapter!! I'm leaving for London for my study abroad in like a week (as of 8/7/16) so I'll try to finish this up when I can.  It WILL get an ending though, I promise!!
He was expecting this, of course he was.  But so close to the limo and so soon?  The Pierre usually had better control over the vicious animals that were the New York paparazzi, but apparently they were slacking tonight.  How distasteful.
Rhodey always respected the ‘sock on the doorknob’ rule, and he too enjoyed pizza.  The underwear was a little much, so Tony managed to put them in his hamper.  But only because it was Rhodey.
And really, that seemed so strange to Steve.  None of Rhodey, of Pepper (they were broken up, sure, but from what Steve saw they were still the best of friends), but more so, there were none of his parents.
With significantly less grace, his muscles still stiff and sputtering in shock, Steve nearly fell from his horse, scraping himself against the grainy forest floor.  Without hesitation, he gathered himself and began climbing the rocks of the forest ledge.  Years of climbing trees for fun with Bucky when they were younger didn’t do much to bulk him up, but it definitely helped him develop some sense of agility to match his light frame.  He was able to pull his light body up the rocks, even if it was with a great amount of difficulty.  If it weren’t for the pure, harsh anger coursing through his veins, his efforts would most likely have been all for not.
It was the annual gala for the Maria Stark Foundation.  And he’d forgotten.  Because he was a fucking idiot.
At that, Tony snorted, striding towards the last empty seat and flopping down, meeting Fury’s sharp gaze with an easy smirk.
And really, neither could Tony.  Because it was never Nick’s eyes, it was Steve’s, it was, it really was, and somehow, somehow….
If the public knew that the king of Wakanda was housing multiple fugitives, Steve is also sure the public’s reaction to T’Challa’s donations would be a bit different.
He knows that if he had just signed the damned thing, things would be different, but that doesn’t mean anything would be better.
She visits, of course, as often as she can (not often enough).  It makes her heart ache, at how happy he is to see her, how bright his face lights up when she walks through the door.  She tells him stories, mostly.  His favorites are about Captain America.
“Hey, I don’t think it’s fair to be playing Monopoly with the literal business tycoon,” Clint whined, but shut up once he took an elbow to the side from Natasha.  Steve wasn’t listening though, because he could only focus on what Tony had said, and how that was the first thing that came to mind as they started sorting through the tiny houses and fighting over who would be the thimble and who would be the shoe.
Out of nowhere the man pulled out a condom and handed it to Tony, who only handed it right back.  “No I’m...you top, fuck me, please….”
It was narrow enough to walk down the street without hitting any buildings (unless it swung its arms, and thus the first thing the Avengers did was attempt to disable them) so it was somewhat of a saving grace.
Steve considers it, he really does.  He wants to ask someone, too, if it’s the right thing to do.  If it’s even worth it.
But Clint was still smirking so apparently his face hadn’t given himself away for once, and Tony inwardly sighed.  He hadn’t slipped, and he had time to throw up his walls. Thank god.
Without thinking, without hesitating, Steve kicked into his horse, chasing after the man.  He could hear Uncle Ben screaming after him, telling him not to go, that it was too dangerous, that the legends were true, that the kingdom wasn’t safe anymore.  But none of that mattered, nothing mattered, he had to get his friend, save his friend, save the village--
But maybe it was still all for his money, and his funding.  Fuck, like he thought he could escape that shit.  It’s not that he minded, because he really did have more money than God, but if he was really being used…?
Reluctantly (and with Thor nearly dragging Steve out) the team left, leaving Tony to be poked and prodded over.
in Afghanistan, he blamed Howard.  Of course he did, because who else was there to blame?  To blame for the fact that his weapons were stolen; more than that, that it was his weapons, his creations that had killed millions of people.
Steve was in his olive green, form fitting, ass squeezing, peck hugging, bicep defining formal military wear and suddenly Tony was 12 all over again and all he wanted to do was get his
Tony looked back down at his desk, not wanting to meet Garner’s questioning gaze.  He didn’t know why Garner was asking him about this again.  They’d been over it, and that was that.  It was helping, Steve was helping.
It had been months since the Battle of New York; one month less than that, the Avengers had moved into the Tower.
Again, Steve blinked.  He looked down again at his new body, and while he supposed he should’ve taken offence from the man’s comments, he was right.  Steve had managed to lift the sword, but had he fought the man who had taken Bucky, he surely would have lost.
He managed to make it to the top, pumping his sore legs along as he raced towards where the man was standing.  Standing, not running, as if he was waiting for him…
Steve furrowed his brow, and wait, no.  Fuck.  Tony needed to stop talking, needed to get away from Cap’s blue, blue eyes and pouted lips and oh Lord, oh-
Tony blinked.  Of course, of course Steve was talking to a therapist, offuckingcourse, because Steve, unlike Tony, had real, actual issues to deal with, not fake pain and silly daddy issues.  Steve watched his best friend fall off a train and hundreds of feet into a valley.  Steve had plunged himself into an iceberg, saying goodbye to the only woman he ever loved as he did so.  Steve woke up to a world 70 years after his, everyone he’d ever known, dead and gone.
New York.  he was in New York, not Afghanistan, and Cap and Clint and Natasha were hovering over him and he vomited again because the water was really fucking disgusting.
But really, despite the fact that the face on the picture was probably most likely not going to match who Nick really was, Tony still knew him, really, he did.  He knew he did, somehow.
So he pushed, and while he managed to make headway, he knew he wasn’t going to last.  Not with the suit unable to withstand the immense pressure.
, Steve was too good for him, really, he was, his anger was well deserved, because Tony hadn’t been fair, not at all, not at all.
Fucking hell.  Sticking a hand under the mask, he could feel blood still dripping from his nose.  Knees still weak, he began to limp away from the man, now realizing that he was in the hallway that lead down into the arena.  Slowly, he began to stagger up the stairs, into the bar and out the door, grunting at the pain that shocked through his body.  He could’ve sworm he could’ve heard a
It was only minutes later, he assumed, when he’d come to.  He squinted at the fluorescents of the arena blaring down on him, trying to blink away the bleariness from his vision.  Someone was slapping him across the cheek, he realized (through the mask, thankfully).
Steve looks down, too much of a coward to meet her fiery gaze.  Because she’s right, he knows she’s right.  She’s right because they were all wrong, in their own way.  They both could’ve acted differently, and he think that Tony understands that, too.
“I don’t care, I’m not going.  Besides, I don’t want my scholarship revoked because I get caught drinking.”
worried,” and that, of course, made Tony scrunch up his nose because Steve would never admit that he alone was worried, he always had to bring everyone into this, because god forbid Steve admit that he was the one who was worried and it was his idea and his alone to confront Tony, because that would just be pathetic, wouldn’t it?  That he’d stooped so low that it was his idea to come give the drunken billionaire a pat on the back because that, that would be just
There was the team, and the team was great.  He’d managed a pizza and video game marathon with Rhodey before he had to return to the Air Force, and it’d been too long, really.  As for the rest of the team, they ate dinner together, they laughed, they joked, they saved New York.  They had nerf gun fights and they sparred, and Clint pretended not to cry over sappy movies, and Coulson came by at least once a week--purely for paperwork reasons, he claimed, but somehow still managed to stick around until midnight nearly every time.
He let the team disperse to do whateverthefuck (seriously, he had no idea what they did at these things….well except Thor, who talked to anything with a pulse and drank his way through half the bar).
Tony sighed, rubbing over his eyes with his fists.  He didn’t need this, he didn’t need the guilt of what could’ve been, he didn’t need that.  He knew he was terrible for it, for doing what he did, couldn’t they just understand that and let him be?  At least for five fucking minutes, after he’d woken up alive instead of six feet under?
.  Why did he want to stay now, and why did he stay with him before?  It wasn’t...right.  Sure, they were friends, but that level of friendship…
Tony buried his head into his hands, knowing and not caring that he was smothering his face in the motor oil he’d failed to wash off from his earlier tinkering.  It didn’t matter; it didn’t matter how he looked because he kept fucking up and he didn’t know what to do about it or how to fix it and he blamed Howard, he really honestly truly did because without him he wouldn’t have been in this mess and maybe he would never have been born, but of course he had because Howard needed a heir for his stupid company, and-
Tony looked up, and nearly choked on his breath when he saw Steve’s face--hollow, strained, confused.
Tony shrugged, and Steve would’ve been mad at him, for being so careless about the whole situation, if he wasn’t so consumed in his disbelief.  “Yes, well, that makes sense, if you hadn’t been raised with the goddamn power inside you.  I assume the goddesses were trying to protect you, no one would go after a poor scrawny villager, or suspect that he would be the Hero of Legend, but stranger things have happened.  Really, I don’t know for sure
He didn’t realize that Steve was clutching him, tears in his own eyes as he pressed ginger kisses to his forehead, his cheeks, his jawline, muttering
“Peggy taught it to you?” Steve all but blurted out.  Natasha raised a brow at him, but Tony simply nodded, smiling slightly.  “Yeah, I mean she wasn’t around much but when she was, she always cooked for me considering neither of my parents could cook worth a damn, and Jarvis deserved a break.”
Really, he didn’t, not at all.  He’d been doing this since he was old enough to toddle.  It was second nature, it was engraved into his muscle memory, and he was definitely not cracking, no definitely not.  His walls were higher than skyscrapers and twice as thick.  He did not need help, because he was Tony Stark.
Steve opened his mouth to respond, but before he could, Sam’s eyes fell onto his nearly packed duffle.  “Jesus, are you seriously skipping out on us?  Do you know who’s coming?”
At that, Steve is left speechless.  He thinks back to the day that Tony had wordlessly returned his shield, and how much of a shock it had been.  That day, though, Steve had been expecting what the gift was when Natasha told him that Tony had something for him.  This?  This was nothing but a mystery.
Fortunately, the universe seemed to hate him less than normal that day, for no one was in the communal kitchen.  Or well, so he thought.
At seven on the dot, however, a familiar face strode into the diner that was most certainly not Nick.
Holding them up, he turned to Bucky, who was currently watching Netflix on his Macbook.  “Buck, are these yours?”
So maybe that’s why it bothered him so much.  Because the way Tony talked about Peggy, was like Peggy was his, and, well, she wasn’t.
And after everyone had moved into the tower with him, it’d gotten better.  Really better.  Really really better.
Growing up in the depression, Steve had never taken anything for granted, and he wasn’t going to do so with Stark’s hospitality.  Tony himself would say that it was all Fury (and partly Coulson) that made them all band together for a giant superhero slumber party, but he also knew that Tony was his own person, and SHIELD needed him more than Tony (or any of the Avengers) needed SHIELD, and that he could’ve kicked them out any time he wanted to.  But he didn’t.
Tony, he supposed, was the only one with a home (on Earth, anyway).  And that’s the way he liked it.  Really, it was.
, but what came out instead was “I punched Ty across the face because he’s a fucking dick and said I like to swim in semen.”
It was frigid, that evening in downtown Brooklyn, with sweeping winds and dark, dusky skies.  However, it was down under some hole in the wall, disgusting bar that Tony was really interested in.
“I haven’t opened it, and I won’t stay, if you want to be alone.”  Natasha’s soft voice would’ve startled him, if he had been more inside his own head.  But he’s just too overloaded with..with
He’s at her bedside, telling a story about some SI board members with a strained smile.  He stops, frowns, and Peggy realizes she was supposed to laugh.
“…You gotta let me think about it, Peggy.  I know Maria and I have been together for only months, but we’re getting married, and this is something we need to think about together.”
The car battery, the fucking car battery.  It was going to kill him, the damned thing, he needed to get out, he needed to get
Cap didn’t say anything when Tony emerged from the lab, and for that he was thankful.  He gave him a bit of a once over, but that wasn’t unwarranted, for he was sure that his appearance was less than desirable.  Not that he, uh, cared.  At all.  Obviously.
Rubbing his temple with one hand and the other running through his nasty, sticky hair, Tony looked up and found the reason for his rude awakening.
“You can help me Steve, for fucks sake, but you can’t do the work for me.  Okay?  You can’t coddle me through my depression, through my anxiety, through my PTSD.  You can help, Steve, you can always help, because fuck if I don’t need comfort in my life, but I also need the goddamn truth.”
Tony Stark and Steve Rogers did not have the best start, but throwing a nuke through space and nearly dying really teaches you to let bygones be bygones, to move on, to work together, to get alone.
It isn’t until T’Challa is gone that Steve realizes he’s clutching the little, black phone in his hand.
Hey so this entire series was just meant to be a one shot, but then I started writing more, and made a sequel.  However, now looking back onto it I believe the entire story should just be one single story, instead of a series, as it flows better that way. So this chapter is exactly the same as what's in Chapter 1 of Part 2 of this series, but I'll continue updating the story on here instead.  So if you've already read Part 2 and have subscribed to that story, I would ask that you just subscribe to this one, as everything will be continued on here from now on.  Thank you!!
Tony nodded, digging his palms into his eyes.   Saying that he was a mess didn’t even begin to cover it.
He’s happy for Tony, of course, but there’s another part of him, a darker, untouched part of him, that wonders it Tony lies awake at night, staring at that damn phone, praying that it will both ring and not ring at the same time.  Does Tony miss Steve like Steve misses him, like a fucking ache in his goddamn chest, a hole full of regret, of guilt, of something maybe like a future, of something that they were maybe balancing on the edge of?
Tony thought it was hilarious.  He’d even gone so far as to make a Twitter, which was completely unnecessary, but still hilarious.  Pepper’s feelings weren’t exactly mutual, but Tony was still alive.  So.
Pepper was crying now, obviously trying to hold back the tears, but it was no use.  She sobbed into a clump of tissues she’d plucked from his bedside table.  Tony didn’t know what to say, so he just sat there in silence, soaking up her tears.
It was three days later, from what JARVIS said, that Tony saw Steve again.  And he’d all but forgotten about their incident in the lab.  Yup, definitely.
He knows he can’t ask Wanda because that would just be...not right, he feels.  He could ask Sam, sure, maybe, but he knows that Sam is still just as peeved at Tony as Clint is.
“Oh, hey Steve.  Got a hot date tonight?”  Tony asked, giving the man a once over.  Dress shirt with fitted khakis.  The lucky gal would probably heel over at the sight.
Slowly rising to his feet, he let her lead him into the elevator and up to his floor.  Once the doors opened, she placed a small peck on his cheek, and then she was gone.
, it was so twisted with horror and just kill him now, really, because no one should make Captain America look like a child who’d just witnessed their puppy being run over, least of all Tony Stark.
“What do you want from me?  I’ll count backwards from ten, I’ll recite math equations, I’ll take some deep fucking breathes.”
But perhaps it was fitting, for once (hah) in his life, Tony was honestly nervous.  Whoever Nick happened to be, he’d probably recognize Tony right away and that was.  Well.
Steve nodded, jamming his hands into his pockets.  He could feel Tony searching his face but he couldn’t bring himself to meet his eyes.  “We never even, well, dated.  Just a kiss in the heat of it all.  I didn’t know it was going to be a one way mission when I jumped onto that plane but I...I figured it might be.  And she just meant so much to me.  Still does.”
He rolled his eyes and tried to get to his feet.  Now that he really was conscious, he could feel the relentless throbbing in his head, and the sharp sting of pain that wrapped around his torso.
The arch reactor flickered in his chest, and pain shot through him, seizing him by the ends of his nerves and dragging him down into a world of agony.
A groan came from the side of the bed, and Tony turned to see Steve, eyes struck in a fit of rage.  “Not
It almost came to blows once, Steve still stuck in his delusions and frustrated out of his mind.  Tony, of course, wouldn’t admit his love because there was
He knew Natasha was perceptive, but even that shocked him a little bit.  “Are my tells that obvious?”
Brushing himself off, he glanced around, gathering himself.  Thankfully he hadn’t dropped off into the front area valet; no, he was around back, which was much more preferable.
“I think,” he muttered, thumb grazing against Tony’s jaw and he shuddered, back digging into the brick wall and oh fuck, oh fuck oh-
Wincing slightly, he opened up the wallet, and as he’d expected he found Tony Stark staring back at him atop a Massachusetts driver’s license.
Tony still thought that was a bold statement, and somewhat unfair, but he could tell that Natasha wasn’t done, so he let her continue.
“He watched his parents die, Steve.  He watched his parents die, and knew that you knew, and didn't’ tell him.  You need to give him time.”
For a minute, Tony actually thought he would.  But no, of course not.  He, of course, was Captain of morality and good will and
It was the next day, when he was watching some old black and white film with Natasha, when it happened again.
Gasping, his eyes flickered open, just to see a handful of worried expressions meet his gaze.  Bruce had the fucking
At that, Steve’s lips gaped, but he was silent, brow furrowed in thought or confusion or whateverthefuck and Tony sighed, sinking lower into the sterile covers.
“I don’t think I would be either.”  He looked towards Tony to find the man smiling at him, a fantastic smile that managed to reach his eyes.  Steve couldn’t help but return the gesture.
Steve grumbled, shoving Bucky away from him as his eyes adjusted to the bright sunlight seeping into the room.  The other man had a good 70 pounds on him, but he moved away from the bed and out of Steve’s face, holding his hands up in defense.
what makes Steve’s heart freeze over, his muscles seizing, fingers going numb.  Tony didn’t want to know where he was.  Tony didn’t want to find him.
Snickering, Clint darted off, leaving Steve blinking between Tony and the spot where the archer once stood.
“Yes,” Tony answered without hesitation.  But even he knew that the word carried no weight.  “If he’s not there then I’ll call him.”
Before he can truly see what’s going on, there’s hands on his hips and lips on his own and fuck, fucking hell, he needs to breathe, he needs to--
It took Steve a minute to come to and realize that Tony was actually talking, talking to him, and he had no idea what was going on.  “Tony--”
Clint shrugged, leaning further over Steve’s shoulder as his fingers scrambled across the keyboard.  “What, would you prefer
Like the absolute professional his father molded him into, Tony breezed by the mess of media, shit eating grin sketched across his face.  Warily, the rest of the Avengers followed him, faces similar to how they were in the limo.  Which was fine, really it was, because it’s not like Tony needed help fending off the absolute mess that was
Out of thin air, Natasha appeared behind Steve, making the man jump.  “Barton,” she stated, the smallest of smirks threatening her face.
Tony smiled.  “Exactly.  I’ll be fine.  He said a week at the most.”  Steve pulled them apart slightly, bending down and reeling Tony back in for a soft, languid kiss.  Tony sighed into it, wanting nothing more than to crawl back into bed with Steve’s lips on his, but he knew Steve had to go, and it would be okay, it would be fine.  They both had jobs and duties, and it was normal, and it would be fine.
It was in the lobby where it really it him.  Everything, all the pain, the pain that was supposed to numb his mind through and through, but it only coursed through his veins, throughout his brain as he remembered, remembered everything and anything all at once, all and once and Christ, did that hurt worse than any punch to the gut.
“Captain Rogers,” the AI stated, and Steve was immediately on alert.  Ever since his and Tony’s...altercation in the lab, JARVIS had been all but ignoring him, responding to his commands and questions only when the questions were crucial--and even then the responses were curt and as short.  Steve would’ve never imagined being ignored by an AI could hurt so much, but when that AI belonged to Tony and cared for his wellbeing, it really did pain him.
“Be safe, okay?” Steve murmured, lips crawling up Tony’s jaw line to nip at his earlobe.  Too soon, Steve untangled his body from his, stepping into the doorway.  He smiled.  “I love you, Tony.”
Really?  Steve was going to have this conversation right here, right now?  In this mess of a pantry with Tony’s booze soaked hair and stained sweats?
He danced his way around the ballroom, champagne in hand, with his free one waving and waltzing, adding to the pompous flair that was the Tony Stark Schmooze.  It was grand, it was over the top, it was too much, it was effective.  And that’s all that mattered, right?
I know that you travel, Howard, but where as I have no nanny, you have the money to hire fifty.  You have Maria, and as I’ve already talked to her, I know that–”
Wow okay, if anyone is still subscribed and invested in this story, apologizes that this conclusion took 9 months.  School took over my life in both good and bad ways, but I've completed my first year and now I have some free time!  So inspired by Mother's Day, I felt it was appropriate to finish this.  I kinda suck at endings so I hope this is enjoyable to you all!
At that, the other man chuckled, abrupt and stiff.  “You’re right, she was her own woman in every sense.”
About an eighth of it was probably why he’d let Steve take the bottle from him, drag him out from under his desk, and sit him down in an actual chair.  Huh.
Was it out of wedlock?  Peggy was a powerful woman, one who defied the standards of her time, but some things might’ve still be inescapable.  Was she ashamed, in her day and age, to have a child without a husband?  That felt...unlike her to Steve, but it’s not like he’d ever discussed the thought of children with her.  They weren’t even dating, not really.  He wanted her to be his girl, sure, but they never went that far, never talked about stuff like that.
Tony’s gaze lingered on him for another moment, but he didn’t reply.  He merely turned, exiting towards the bay.  Steve watched him go, watched as the suit molded around him, encasing his lean form.  He watched as the red and gold armor lifted from the Helicarrier and streaked across the sky.  A small smile involuntarily formed across his face at the beauty of it.
“No worries, Cap.  Who you texting, your girlfriend?” Tony asked, smirking to himself at the childish remark.  At that however, Steve blushed slightly, rolled his eyes, and walked off towards the elevator.
If it didn’t hurt to do so, Tony would’ve shrugged.  “Y’know, I think you’re missing the part when I saved a trainful of people, yeah?  Do you remember that?”
It’s not like Tony hasn’t been in love before, because he has.  He was in love with Pepper, loved her, and still loves her.  Not in the same way as he once did, but it’s still love.  He knows what love is.  Obviously.
He flirted his way through the red carpet; a smooch here, redirecting a nasty comment there, a high pitched laugh here.  It was like baking; a spoonful of that, a pinch of this.  And before he knew it, he was through the door and into the ballroom.  Simple as that.
It was ridiculous, wasn’t it?  This wasn’t how the stories went.  Tony wasn’t sixteen, crying into a pillow in his too small bedroom as his iPod shuffle blared in his ears, his parents arguing about getting a divorce as he slit his wrists.  No, this wasn’t like every single fucking stereotype he’d ever heard in his life.  Grown men didn’t do this.  Billionaire geniuses didn’t do this.
It was never meant to be romantic, never meant to be beautiful.  Just because he found romance on his way doesn’t neglect that what happened, what happened to him, was a disease, not romance.  Steve is romance, but Steve is not his cure, was never his cure, was never meant to be his cure.  That’s not the way this story was meant to play out.
keep the baby, she knew it wasn’t right.  With no husband and nowhere near the funds that Howard had, she knew the child wouldn’t grow up right, wouldn’t grow up properly.
“Y’know, in the gym and shit.  Why are you always working out at two in the morning?  Can’t sleep, huh?  Need to get some tension out, yeah?  Same damn thing, Steve.  You take it out by hitting shit, and I take it out by drinking.
So he didn’t.  And it was after 78 sleepless hours that Steve found him sprawled across the couch at three in the morning, surrounded by coffee mugs and chinese take out containers.
They rode down in comfortable silence, Steve getting off at the main lobby, declining Tony’s offer for a lift in the car.
It might’ve been silly and stupid and dumb, but damn if it didn’t feel like the most sane thing Tony had experienced in awhile.
But after a day, once most of the anger had disapparated from his mind, declouding his thoughts, he went to go seek Tony out
Tony heaved a sigh, running a hand through his hair.  “Yes, okay, I’m just going to say it.  I did try to kill myself, okay?  I did.  But that had
Steve rolled over, covering Tony’s body with his, but propping himself up on his elbows as not to squish the other man.  He cupped Tony’s head within his hands, as if it were fine and precious, as if Steve were scared to do any more damage.
, Tony?  What if--God, Tony, why didn’t you tell anyone?  You could’ve told me, you know, I know we’re not dating anymore but I still--I couldn’t lose you, Tony!”
But after it all, after they yelling and screaming and the shaking and the crying, Steve would hold him so, so tight, and remind him that he was loved, and that Steve was here, and that it would all be okay, because Steve was here.
Hopefully none of said people were paparazzi, or any nobody who gave a shit about him, but he was never really that lucky, was he?
What he sees nestled inside the box nearly causes his knees to buckle.  He steps back, hands clutching at his own face but it doesn’t feel like his own hands because how could it how could it he can’t believe can’t believe can’t believe it why would Tony do this how could Tony do this how could he have ever done all those things to Tony said all those things because Tony is just so.  So.  So so so sososososo.
“Let’s go to the rec room,” Tony said, he and Steve having vouched to take the next elevator, originally planning to go back to Tony’s floor instead.  Steve merely raised a brow, but didn’t say anything.
“No!” Steve shrieked, arms reaching out in vain as the man caught up to Bucky, who had tried to make his escape too little too late, having been paralyzed in his own fright.  With strength only to be matched by the goddesses, he scooped Bucky up, throwing him over his shoulder and making a break for the village.
There were classier men (or men pretending to be classier, anyway) at the bar, making awkward small talk with one another as they eyed the scarcely clad ladies that sauntered around.  It was so typical, really, the whole setup, but it sure as hell beat a gala.  Oh god did it.
Mind fueled by pure adrenaline and rage, he followed the man, pulse pounding in his ears as he made his way over the rickety bridge, creaking under the weight of both the men galloping furiously along.
“Is there a problem…” Tony trailed off, because Steve was staring at him, staring at him like he’d just realized the Earth revolved around the sun and and that the grass was green and the sky was blue and.  And.
They were all dressed up, of course; Tony, Clint, Thor and Bruce in some suit Pepper had thrown at each of them (Clint had opted to wear a powdered blue tuxedo, which made even Tony cringe), Natasha in a chic, charcoal backless dress, and Steve, well….
Tony was shocked still, but managed to pry himself out of his trance once he saw the team getting to their feet.  “Wait.  Wait, what?  What the fuck?  First of all, Clint, you keep your grubby little bird claws off my shit or I swear I will steal your kidneys and sell them on Craigslist.  Second,
He blinked, then frowned.  The last part, about not being qualified to be an Avenger, had just slipped out.  The other things had been said to him constantly, whether it be through a trashy magazine, talk show, or having been directly said to him in person.  And granted, he had been told he wasn’t fit to be an Avenger, but it seemed so long ago now; never mind that after Tony threatened to leave the Avengers after the Chitauri invasion, both Fury and Coulson had made it very clear that Tony was, and is, an Avenger.
“Harsh,” he muttered, trying to sit up and instantly regretted it.  Pain was still sharp in his ribs, along with his shoulders.
It was his own damn gala, and he’d punched a grown man across the face, jumped out the window, and walked himself down to a whorehouse.
Tony shifted, snuggling himself into Steve.  But by Steve’s shaking, however, it was clear that something was wrong.
Carefully, Tony reached out, clasping Steve’s hand between his own two.  “I think I’d like to begin again.”
Steve thought that it had to be some stupid joke, that no one would dish out that much money for some ratty jeans - until he read the name scratched out at the bottom of the sheet.
she began sniffling, again presumably, tears rocking her body as the grip on his hand tightened.  Tony pulled her close so she was half on his bed, her stuffed nose pressed into the crook of his neck.
logo stenciled on in fresh, glistening paint.  Even that is almost too much for Steve, seeing Tony’s name embellished before him.
So they galloped and trotted, ushering the frantic sheep as they did.  There were only three more left and Steve was hot on their trail when he called out to Bucky, “Looks like I get to keep my bed, unless you can manage--”
“Yes, you’re right, you need to leave.  But please, be safe.  He’s not worth more than you are.  You know that.”
“Yes, I’m sorry, I really am.  How I acted in your lab, I shouldn’t have gotten so upset.  Peggy, she meant so much to me.  But she never
Tony was about to rebuttal with how the film was meant to show Steve the wonders of the nineties, but he held his tongue.
He’s clutching at Natasha now, sobbing dry sobs into her chest, because what else can he do?  What can he do, knowing that Tony is getting on fine without him, while Steve can’t fucking breathe because his lungs were so crushed by the guilt in the hole in his chest?
She sighed.  “Fractured ribs, a broken wrist, dislocated shoulder, a bit of internal bleeding and a mild concussion.  They said you got lucky.”
Without warning, Steve grasped Tony’s wrist, pulled him out of the bar and down a block, into some scummy alleyway and Tony was so shocked, so shocked he couldn’t process anything because Steve’s lips were on his and his hands on his hips and oh god, oh god.
“It’s okay,” Tony said, “I mean, I guess I thought you did too.  But that’s not how this works, Steve, it’s not--”
Steve’s kept busy himself, of course.  With Bucky under, he’s trying to focus all of his energy on finding a cure, finding a solution, finding
to me, especially not for Cap here.  What’s your version of home, huh?  White picket fence, tree house for the kiddies in the back, front porch with a rocking chair in the front?”  Tony shrugged, throwing his feet up onto the conference table.  “I, however, am fortunate to have acquired more than enough space for me, myself and I, what with a
Those days, however, were becoming few and far between, and Tony was getting better, Steve would say.  They were fixing it, Steve would say, running a hand through his hair as they laid sprawled across Tony’s bed.  It was all going to be okay, Steve would say.
Steve shook his head.  “I’m not sorry I found out, but I’m sorry for how it happened. I’m sorry that I hurt you.”
Steve turns toward T’Challa, who’s poised at the door frame of Steve’s bedroom.  The King is dressed formally, a suit made of cloth, not of vibranium.
is, it’s not love.  Nope.  Nada.  Definitely not.  He would know, of course, because he’s Tony Stark and he’s a genius and he’s been in love before and he knows what love is.
They parked, and walked in silence towards the proper gravestone.  Steve had been briefed on the location, but he had never came, didn’t think he could bare to come alone.
The agent sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose.  “I don’t doubt you, but when I say he’s busy, he’s busy.”
Steve sighed, but frustration was bright in his eyes.  “No, I don’t think so.  If it was so obviously unhealthy, then why do you keep doing it?”
Then his parents bit the dust and he was left with a company to run and damn it if he wasn’t a genius but goddamn it if he wasn’t still 21 when he took over the company, working alongside a man who was out to kill him as he made weapons that were out to kill others, kill innocent lives and there was blood on his hands, so so so so much blood on his hands and maybe, maybe that’s why he deserved it after all, deserved it for that wretched nickname that he earned all on his own, no one’s fault but his own.
The flames had stopped at the forest, but Steve knew that didn’t mean the village was out of harm's way.  A man like that--
Tony looked down, his voice low and soft.  “Don’t tell me you didn’t know this was going to happen, Steve.  You knew, you always knew, you just didn’t want to believe it.”
For all Tony could tell, it could’ve been years later when he finally came back to himself.  And really, did it matter?
She waltzed past him, settling herself down into his desk chair, eyeing him.  “Just until after the gala.”
Well...maybe that’s not true.  They’ve all had a lot of time to recover since the Incident, and really think about what they all did, really think through it all.  Sam was furious once Steve and Bucky had returned from Siberia, but once Steve had explained everything to Sam, he was...more understanding, in a way.  Just as Steve had been.
He tries to regain himself, turns toward the Natasha, then to the box, then back to Natasha.  “No...no you can stay.  I’m sure it’s not…”
And then, it was Steve and Tony once again, with Steve looking utterly and completely confused.  Tony just shrugged.
, you have to get there yourself.  But you will, I know you will, Steve knows you will, we all know you will.”
Steve laughed, already herding his first two sheep into the barn.  “There’s no way I’m going to be stuck with your lumpy bed for that long.”
“Where’s Bucky?”  he managed, his voice raw and thick in his throat.  The prince seemed unruffled by the fact, if anything his wicked smile grew.
But it was cold and dark and Tony was alone, very alone as he meandered through the crowded bar towards the back, down the stairs and into the arena, with jeering people who reeked of stale beer and damp sweat, with two other masked men already punching it out in the ring that was centered inside the place.  And really, it was perfect.  Really.
Steve didn’t say anything, and was still quiet until Tony had finished making his coffee.  Cringing inwardly, he turned toward the other man.
It wasn’t until later that day, after a morning movie marathon spent cuddled with Steve on the couch, when Tony met with Dr Garner for the first time.  Well, the first time that mattered anyway.
Tony could’ve kicked them out, of course.  But he didn’t.  Because hey, Fury might’ve been right for once in his life; having the Avengers in the same spot would be beneficial to the team.  Or something.
“Oh, but you were so eager to tell us about how much room you had.  Must need something to do with all that room, huh?”
But if so, who had saved him?  He knew he heard the man on the horse laughing, ready to strike.  And then…
An asshat?  Yeah, almost there.  A selfish fucker who freaks out over movies and punches a grown man in the face over some petty name calling and then goes and gets a dick shoved up his ass, just to have Captain Fucking America come pick him up on the side of the road in some sleazy area of New York?
This had happened before, sure.  He and Tony had fought, Tony had locked himself away, but after a day or two, they’d be back on speaking terms, whether they actually apologized or not.  Steve had come to realize Tony apologized in his own way, which was usually upgrading Steve’s suit, or building him a weapon that Steve really didn’t need, but he took it with gratitude anyway, because he’d come to realize that’s just how Tony Stark worked.  And it was nice.
Jarvis rolled the movie, and if Tony just happened smiling at his phone throughout the whole thing, no one said anything.
Before he could duck out the door, however, he felt a firm hand yank at his arm, and he was then face to face with Steve, blue eyes boring into his brown.  Eyes with a glimmer of something, something so similar to what he’d seen the night before, what he’d seen as Steve pulled him in, Tony firm against his chest….
, and you know it, too.  Fury can suck it, Coulson has a stick so far shoved up his ass it’s crawling out his nose so, yeah, nothing I can do about that, he’d be mad if I spilled my fucking cocktail on my tie, so.  Uh, yeah.  I got, like, science and stuff to take care of, so I’ll just….”
“Because you asked me to, Tony...But if you ever want to talk about it in-in the future, you know I’m here, right?”
“You thought?”  Tony’s tone was growing increasingly bitter.  Steve swallowed, knowing he should backtrack but his irrational anger won him over.
So one night, as he was lying in his actual bed  for once (per Pepper’s very threatening and scary order), he was scrolling through Clint’s fake profile (
Tony wasn’t one to go on a stroll, but, God he needed to get out of the house, out and away from everything, from his feelings, from Steve, from–-
For three days, Pepper dragged him off to SI meetings, and he groaned his way through them.  Clint and Thor fought over the last package Pop Tarts, and Bruce nearly hulked out when the duo turned on him, after he suggested that there was a convenience store 2 blocks away where they could buy more.  Natasha sharpened her knives in the lobby, and was only removed after an old man nearly fainted at the sight.
He laid there for what felt like ages, the room quiet except for the two men’s breathing.  Eventually, Tony cracked an eye open, squinting up at Steve who was perched at the edge of the bed, staring down at Tony.  Rolling his eyes, Tony threw back the covers, beckoning Steve forward with his finger.
But, when she held her child in her arms for the first time, staring into his soft brown eyes, how could she have felt regret?
to myself because it was better than thinking, better than dealing with the ache in my chest?  That I
“And then I jumped out the window and walked to a cathouse and paid some guy to fuck me and well, after that you know what happened because you were there!  And I’m sure you didn’t think anything of it because here’s Tony Stark, once again to come fuck up the lives of those he cares about because, like, you know how I used to be the
“C’mon Pep, I really did read them this time, I swear!”  He was nearly whining now, but it was just Pepper here, and he couldn’t be bothered to care.  And in his defense, he really did read them!  Well, mostly.  More than usual, anyway.  “You should be lucky I could even sign them, have you not noticed my broken wrist?”
Out of the forest surrounding the ranch came a figure atop a sleek black steed, the man himself cloaked in green.  His garments billowed around him, and behind him followed a trail of bright, blazing flames, scorching the woods as he galloped. He hopped over the fence with impossible grace, staring straight at Steve but riding towards his best friend.
But Steve didn’t have time to think, no, he didn't have that luxury because he was confused out of his goddess-damned mind, but he needed to get to Bucky, needed to needed to needed to--
Steve blinked.  He hadn’t checked the age on the thing, but he supposed that yeah, Tony would have a fake ID, if he was only 17.  “Really, I can’t take that much from you.”
However emotionally stunted he was or could be, he couldn’t deny that this soft, throbbing hum in his chest, that coursed throughout his entire being, was anything but-
“Not reality with the world around you, from what Coulson tells me, you’re life is very real, if somewhat insane.  But what you need is to confront yourself.
“Who’re you waiting for tonight, Stark?  I saw a hefty pair of twins in there, you think they’d do that incest shit, just for you?  How disgusting, really, but whatever gets you off I guess.”
Through the haze of pain that was his mind, he thought he heard a mad cackle, too close, too too close.  But Steve was powerless, he couldn’t do anything but to lay there and accept his--
“Miles, it’s been ages!  And my my, are you happy to see me or is that a fat stack of benjamins you got there….Oh wait!”
Tony had seen a lot of men in a lot of suits in his day.  Countless galas, balls, meetings, you name it.  But honestly, none of them compared to Steve in his formal military garb.
Thor was grinning wide as usual, and nearly grasped his shoulder with his usual force, before Natasha stopped him.  His smile didn’t falter, however.  “It’s good to see you wake in the world of the living!”
Before Steve could filter through his thoughts, his lips were already moving.  “I thought I was getting a reward, not a punishment.”
Bucky just nodded, trotting his horse into the gate as Uncle Ben opened it up for them.  “If I catch more than you, I get your bed for a week.”
But now, he wasn’t so sure.  Because really, what was his life after MIT?  There was taking over Stark Industries, sure.  But that, of course, was when he was first really shoved into the limelight of modern media; his face everywhere, paparazzi following his every move, articles of him in magazines ranging from Time to the Inquirer.  That’s when he was no longer Tony, and became Tony Stark.
Steve shook his head.  “No, no I definitely did something, I just can’t figure out what.”  He paused, looking up again.  “Do you know anything about Peggy?”
Tony bit back a groan as he tried to raise himself, the same aches and pains stabbing at him once more.  He could feel dried blood thick on his lip, bruises dotted across his face.
The prince clapped his hands twice, striding towards the door.  “Come.  Grab the sword, I’ll find you a sheath.  The longer we wait, the deeper shit we’re both going to be in.”
And Steve, well, Steve kept tugging at the collar of his shirt and rubbing the back of his neck;  One would think that someone who used to parade around in a red and blue spandex suit for show would be used to being put on display, but apparently being frozen in ice for seventy years and being thrown into the disastrous 21st century limelight did a thing or two to a man.  Who knew.
“Howard’s shit,” Tony mumbled, pulling his head out of the box he was digging around in.  Out of it he pulled a stack of notes, one of Howard’s notebooks and a pile of Captain America comics.  First issue, too.
The elevator was an inch from closing, when an arrow whizzed through, landing millimeters from Tony’s ear.  He barely flinched.
“I...think you know what this is,” Steve said, the same small smile sketched across his face, but this time, it managed to reach his eyes.
Soon enough, they left and the rest of the team barged their way back in.  This time, though, they seemed too afraid to say anything.
“Don’t worry,” came a voice from off to the side.  “Your friend is fine.  I’ve provided him with the best protection there is in Hyrule….well, besides myself, but that’s not really an option right now, so…”
A small smirk crawled across Tony’s face, but the playfulness didn’t reach his eyes.  “You’ve picked up new technology well, but no matter how faulty SHIELD’s security servers are--as they won’t let me install my own systems, of course--there’s no way you could’ve hacked him.”
“I…Okay.  Okay.  I’m sorry things got so messed up, but I can help you, I can, I’ll try, I really will.”
Thor was scowling now, however, eyes glaring into an empty box of Pop Tarts.  “Who would dare eat the last of my toaster pastries?!” he shouted, looking from Steve to Tony with fuming pupils.
Tony narrowed his eyes.  The quip was not undeserved, but it was unexpected.  “Uh, that doesn’t sound very
Sure, he considered Tony his friend, despite their bickering, but this was a different kind of ache.  This was Steve watching a movie with the rest of the Avengers and expecting a snarky quip from Tony over the now dated special effects, or inaccurate science, but when the room remained silent aside from the movie itself, Steve found that it hurt.
He sighed, watching the college kids and businessmen and women hop on and off; some frantic, some relaxed, most of them with ears hooked up to a phone or iPod.
The way he says it is almost patronizing, but Steve knows that it’s not.  He’s just...trying to help.
“It seems to me,” Garner continued, when Tony remained silent, gaze flickering between the cactus and the pens strewn across his desk, “that your issues stem from deeper problems within yourself.  Am I wrong?”
A nurse was kind enough to lead them out the back entrance since everyone, including the doctors, agreed that the last thing Tony needed right now was a paparazzi ambush.  Multiple SHIELD vans were brought around, and Steve led Tony into the one that Natasha had hopped into.
With haste, he pushed open the door to the desired room.  He’d barely taken in the area before a tall, broad man with coarse chest hair and a black mess of hair down to his chin.  His eyes were scalding, heated smile bright even in the dim lighting of the room.
Woodland to Park Street was a bit of a journey, and Tony was glad.  That’s what he’d came here for.  To bring him back, back to before.
His fake name was called and the man swung a fist straight into Tony’s jaw, sharp pain shooting through him as he staggered back, wracking his nerves and winding him tight.  But it was so
The other man wrapped his arms around him, pulling him closer.  Tony breathed into his chest, feeling more relaxed and peaceful than he had in, well, months.
So after a week, Steve found himself awake early in the morning slouched over the kitchen table, staring unseeingly into his cup of tea.  He didn’t even look up when Natasha sat herself next to him.
This was bad, this was really bad, he couldn’t keep doing this, it was going to tear him apart, Steve was going to tear him apart and his chest hurt and ached and his head was pounding and his limbs felt tingly and fuck it, fuck it.
and all that jazz.  Sure the renovations to the floors, making them more apartment-like and less office-like weren’t complete, but apparently Fury took ASAP very literally.
The man, however, was nowhere to be seen, having seemingly disappeared before Steve’s eyes.  What Steve did see however, gave him an inkling of hope.
Steve nodded, not sure what else to say.  That seemed to be good enough for Tony, however, for the kid simply stared at him a moment longer, still smirking, then dashed down the hall without another word.
Well...that’s not true.  He knows some things would be different, and he hopes that other things would be better.
And really, he was the reason for Steve, the reason Steve was here today, in Tony’s life.  He had a hand in SHIELD's formation, and consequently, the formation of the Avengers.
She feels herself fading, but a weight is lifted from her chest, a weight that should never have been there in the first place, and now she can sleep peacefully.
And well, there were twenty four from Steve.  And a billion text message which he far too exhausted to even go through.  They could bitch him out later.  Right now, all he wanted was to trudge his way home and collapse into his bed.  Or something.
Steve had just managed to open his mouth, when Thor popped his head into the pantry.  “Ah, Tony!  Steven!  I see that Tony has once again passed out in a sack of rice, eh?  I didn’t realize it was a Tuesday.”
it, so tired of the press constantly following his every move, constantly eating up his personal life.  And most of all, he was tired of the mess that it made for the Avengers, for Pepper.  For Steve, who was still giving him a look sharp as broken glass and just as deadly, piercing Tony right in his cold, metal heart.
As he slowly climbs into consciousness, he feels Steve’s strong arm slung over him, snug against his torso.  He can feel the other man’s breathing, the rise and fall of his chest, and it’s soothing, oh so soothing to Tony.  It’s the perfect way to wake up, really.
Peggy narrows her eyes, stepping away from the alcohol crawling towards her.  Howard, however, isn’t done.  “Do you know what a PR nightmare that’s going to be?  The kid’s already famous, and if they found out Maria wasn’t his mom…do you know what a clusterfuck that would be?  The mess I would have to clean up?”
T’Challa only continues to stare at him, making Steve’s skin itch.  He has no idea what the other man is thinking.  He opened his home to Steve, along with the rest of the Avengers who had nowhere to go, until this whole issue...Incident..is sorted out.  If it ever will be.
Clint stole a piece before the pasta had even set and cooled, burning his tongue and mouth but swearing black and blue that it was worth it.  When everyone had settled in, though, it was Bruce who said, “I honestly was afraid when I heard you were in the kitchen, Tony, but this is great.”
Tony blinked at the hand, then at Steve’s dancing eyes, those blue, blue eyes, fuck.  Oh fucking hell.
Tony shifted in his bed, slipping further under the covers.  “So you take orders from a dead man, huh?”
T’Challa only continues to stare at him, making Steve’s skin itch.  He has no idea what the other man is thinking.  He opened his home to Steve, along with the rest of the Avengers who had nowhere to go, until this whole issue...Incident..is sorted out.  If it ever will be.
“To be fair,” he said slowly, either trying to quell his frustration, or acting like he was talking to a two year old.  Probably both.  “I really think that working out is far better than getting wasted.”
Fuck.  Really?  What Tony needed was a dose of fucking reality?  He fought for his life nearly on the daily, he’s been captured by terrorists, he has sharpel trapped inside his chest that’s oh so close to eating him alive every single day, and what he needs is fucking reality?
to Tony.  He needed to figure out why his words hurt Tony so deeply, why he was so attached to Peggy.  It was the only way to
It wasn’t standard, as was shown by the man’s mildly shocked face, but he only grinned, a wicked curl to his lips.  “Oh baby, I feel like I should be paying you.  I’m going to make you feel so good, sweetheart, make it so nice for you, you’re going to love it.”
“Didn’t--?!  Tony, you never let me in!  You never wanted to talk, you always shut me out!  I tried, I
“Of course,” she said simply, an amused grin playing at her lips.  He swooped her into a hug, and it felt….it felt good.  He hadn’t hugged anyone since….
“Had she not been related to me by blood, it wouldn’t have changed anything.  I loved her when she was my fierce and brilliant Aunt Peggy, and I love her now.”
Steve’s frown deepened; considering he himself was just a farmer boy from Ordon, he felt there very much was a need for formalities when you’re conversing with a prince you’ve known for all of ten minutes, but he decided to play along.  “Okay, Tony, when you said that...
He also remembers this feeling, this feeling of wanting to give it all, just to go back.  To go back to his own time, back to Peggy, back to his old life.
, ‘Tash!”  Steve doesn't feel himself rise from his seat, but he suddenly finds himself backed against the grand windows, turning towards the vast scapes of jungle beneath him.  “I...I don’t need to be reminded, you know...you know that I…”’
And, God, Tony couldn’t take it anymore, couldn’t take his stupid fucked up denial.  He couldn’t worry about how he was going to fuck it up, fuck up their relationship because he was Tony fucking Stark and that’s what he
What he found was Tony’s workshop locked, and his override codes rejected.  He couldn’t say that he was surprised.
Again, he laughed, and it didn’t bother Tony, it didn’t, because Tony was worth more than Tiberius Fucking Stone, in both brains and bills.  It didn’t matter, none of this mattered.
Or well, he hoped, for Tony had only managed to crumple atop the couch of his apartment when the elevator dinged again, a very distressed Captain walking out.
“Workshop, J,” he breathed, leaning against the cool wall of his elevator, hand running through his cropped hair.
that it makes his chest ache and his eyes sting and his heart aches oh it aches it aches it aches because how could Steve ever think that he could ever would ever deserve Tony because Tony is a better man than Steve could ever hope to be and Steve never gave him enough credit not then now now not ever and Tony is just so so so everything that Steve ever wanted to be everything that Steve
“...You all in the same location would be ideal.  I know that Barton and Romanov are used to it here, but Dr. Banner, and you Captain, aren’t so used to such living conditions.”
“I was just about to burn that,” Tony muttered, lifting himself off of Clint and snatching the wretched thing from Steve’s grip.  Steve, however, was still grinning.
Instead he ran faster, faster than he ever knew his thin legs were capable of taking him, straight into the forest.
And to think that he’d only gotten worse.  But nowadays it was easier to hide it from her.  So that was good, really.  Probably.  Sure, whatever, it didn’t matter.
And he was being hugged.  If you could call it that, since it was really just Steve wrapping his arms around Tony, chin resting atop his shoulder and his arms were so warm, so warm and strong and oh so good so good so so so.
Surprisingly (or perhaps not surprising at all) it was Bruce who spoke first.  “To be fair, Tony, you did, uh--”
Steve awoke that day how he awoke every day--with Bucky whacking him across the face with an overstuffed pillow.
Everyone, he found out, was an idiot.  Except Pepper, of course, who was obviously too furious to call him.
Five hours later, Tony found himself awaken in his walk in pantry, a pounding aching head somehow shoved into a torn up bag of rice.  Rice, that was dampened with the contents of his now empty bottle of whiskey.
But outside of that, outside of his own, personal hang ups, he knows that instead of him being persecuted, it would just be him being controlled.  Either operate against the law and do what needs to be done, or be on the side of the government, and have the decision making ripped from him.
It turned out, Natasha only needed two days to hack into SHIElD (he knew Tony would have done it within the hour, but again, he was trying not to think about that).  It was two more long, agonizing days of going without seeing Tony.  Wondering what he was doing, if he was okay, if he was eating, if he was sleeping okay...
What Tony Stark did not do, was small talk with strangers he was supposed to be sexting with (well maybe not that yet, but still).  Small talk, online?  On a fake account?  He just didn’t do it.
Steve tried to suppress the blood rushing to his cheeks, but it was to no avail.  The owner of said voice was now face to face with Steve, strewn casually within his doorway.  His brown hair was mussed up, as if he’d just rolled out of bed, complete with stubble lining his chin.  As his eyes fell from the stranger’s face, he saw that he was sporting a worn MIT shirt that clung loosely from his shoulders.  Oh, and his
It was everywhere (or at least that’s what it seemed like it to Steve) that Tony would be reminded of Peggy, and he would just have to go out of his way to tell Steve, because that was appropriate, right?  Whether it was a dress that Tony thought she would’ve loved, or her favorite bottle of wine, or her favorite place to eat on the Upper East Side–and eventually, it seemingly clicked inside Steve’s rattled head.
He knows he’s trying to protect people.  Because that’s what Tony does, that’s what Ultron really was meant to be.  A protector to protect against something like New York from ever happening again.
The one that tugged down at the corners of Steve’s lips, dusting off the shine from his blue, blue eyes.  But he didn’t dwell on that, because he couldn’t, not now.
, and he was in the goddess damn castle, and he had no idea what was going on.  But, his brain was not completely lost from him.
Tony, who was sitting cross-legged on Rhodey’s bed as he slurped a cup of noodles, widened his eyes as Steve walked into the room.  “Captain Muscles!” he exclaimed, setting the cup down as he hopped up the bed, approaching Steve with that same, devious smirk.  “Now, how did you end up with my pants?”
Oh Jesus, oh Lord.  He was here and singing and playing and right behind him and there were people here, staring now, some filming but Tony didn’t care, not at all, not at all because Steve was singing to him as he’d been all week, a smile showing through even on his moving lips and wasn’t that something, wasn’t that everything?
Tony shook his head, holding up his hand as to cut him off.  “Do you know how hard it is to get an official fake ID?  This license was printed at a DMV and it’s total bullshit.  You know how much I had to pay to get this?”
WIth a gasping breath, Tony jolted awake, covered in cold sweat and dread coursing through his veins.
Shaking his head, Tony strode towards the elevator, only to be greeted by Steve when the door slid open.
Steve turns to her, a frown growing across his face.  “He went after Bucky too, you know, you weren’t there, he--”
She pulled away, staring into him with her wild, wide glassy eyes.  She looked...oh, god, she looked--
“Of course it’s good, it’s a movie about me,” Tony smirked.  Then paused, scrunching up his nose slightly.  “Well, if I was poor.”
“C’mon, you’re going to bed.”  Steve lifted himself up off the couch to hover over Tony, his gaze stoic.
Bruce merely raised an eyebrow, and Tony was about to throw the notebook into the inferno, when the lab doors opened.
It was three days after Steve left when Tony realized that he was most certainly Not Okay.   It was so late it was early the next day, and Tony was lost in his work, so lost that when he was rummaging through his drawers, it took him a good minute to realize that what he picked up was not, in fact a socket wrench, and was a bottle of pills.
His chest throbbed, but it wasn’t as painful as he imagined it would be.  Perhaps it was because he had more closure now.  Perhaps it was because of the man beside him.
Steve pulled harshly on his reins, forcing his mare to a halt as he turned towards the source of the noise.  His jaw gaped in horror at the sight, muscles seizing as he stared in disbelief.
Steve was already mostly certain this whole thing was a trap when he took Bucky through the village instead of back the way he came, so the confirmed knowledge that this mystery man was purposely letting Steve follow him didn’t slow him down.
, you can’t be dependent on alcohol or drugs or sex, or Steve.  Because if you can’t learn to help yourself, then how can you ever accept the fact that you deserve to be happy?  How can you help yourself be happy?”
Rhodey came over after she left, gently squeezing his shoulder, offering him the smallest of smiles.
He hadn’t put the lab on max security, because for the level he’d had it on, only three people had access to, and he’d, like the dumbass he was, forgotten that one of them happened to live in the tower.
“Keep doing reckless stunts without warning...without warning the team!  You could’ve gotten yourself killed, Tony.  We have a plan, and if you’re going to stray from it, you need to tell someone.  And then, you need to actually think about what you’re doing!”
“That sword will do you good, but it’s not like you can go up against Loki without a proper shield.  Unfortunately for you, my rat bastard father managed to--”
, and if Rhodey knows what in Nayru’s name he’s talking about, it was taken by the Gerudo, and now I have to go to the fucking desert and retrieve it.  Or steal it...no, not stealing, it was stolen from me twice, so me taking it back shouldn’t count as stealing.”
And that’s the kicker, really.  All his life he’s been non stop, moving as fast as his genius brain would let him.  Having to take his time, going one step at a time through this process called healing, called Getting Better, called Becoming Whole Again.
His celebration was short lived, however, for he then realized he was alone in the bathroom at the Pierre and had knocked
The building was a hole in the wall, with stained concrete slabs for walls, worn out flashing neon lights indicating just what the place was.  A bulky, tall man stood in front of the stairwell that lead down to the joint.
Loki figured it out, but the Triforce is tricky, and Loki himself trickier than most.  I, of course, have been under the protection of Hyrule’s finest for all my life, no need to worry there...generally speaking.  If only my father hadn’t been a lying--”
In turn, he offered the Captain a smile of nails, hopping of the bed and strutting towards the door.
Rhodey had been on ‘classified’ missions, as of late, and Pepper had been well, running his goddamn company.
And really, that's rich, coming from Miss Tall Dark and Secretive.  Rich that she thought Tony would’ve said anything at all, rich that she had the fucking balls to ask him that, after being his fake assistant when he was dying of palladium poisoning.
Sometimes he’d come down, just himself and his sketchbook, and they’d work in this sorta comfortable silence that, well.  Tony never had anything like that, really.
And Tony was there, and he was good, and he believed that he really, really was getting better.  He wanted to believe it, so badly.
calling after him, but he elected to ignore it.  Once outside, he ripped off the bloodied mask, throwing it onto the ground as he took his sweatshirt off and balled it up, pressing it to his nose.
When he reached the level however, JARVIS piped up again.  “If I may, Sir, may I make a recommendation?”
Tonight, he had a show to perform.  Because tonight he wasn’t Tony Stark: Iron Man, Avenger, Genius Eccentric Engineer.  No, tonight he was Tony Stark: Philanthropist, Schmoozer, ‘Darling’ of the Media, Playboy Flirt.
It was his fault, no matter what she said.  But she didn’t try to pin the ‘it’s not you it’s me’ schtick on him, no.  He just….knew.  She couldn’t deal with his self destructive behavior anymore, it was ruining her.  And really, it wasn’t fair of him.  Not at all.
He apparently had twelve missed calls from Pepper, ten from Happy, five from Bruce, three from Clint and one from Natasha (which was scary enough, really).
She shrugged, waving him off.  “That’s neither here nor there.  But you need to learn to help yourself when you have a panic attack, when your depression is beating you out.”
Tony frowned into his drink, hearing it now, too.  He look at the others; Thor and Bruce seemed mildly confused, Natasha, of course, was smirking, and Clint looked as if he’d fallen back asleep all over his eggs.
She knows, of course, that he was barely home anyway, and if he was, he was constantly buried in his work, in his company.  Maria was better, she knew, taking Tony to Central Park for picnics, taking him out to the movies when she could.  Jarvis was there the most, however, and she wondered if Jarvis just would’ve taken the kid in himself, if she asked.
Steve blinks, pulling himself from his thoughts.  T’Challa hasn’t moved, eyes still boring into him.
He felt heavy hands on his shoulders, rubbing as gently as the voice in his ear.  “Please, Tony.  Let me in, for once just--”
Steve nods, sipping his coffee without meeting Natasha’s eyes.  He didn’t even have to ask, this time.  She just knew he would ask, because every time they’ve met up for the past four months, the only thing on Steve’s mind is Tony.
In the back of his mind, however, a voice was screaming at him, telling him that this was a trap, that he needed to get out, get out of the grove, out of Faron Woods and into the village.  A larger, greater part of Steve, however, a part that seemed almost supernatural, beckoned him towards the sword, begging him to grasp the hilt in his hand, to pull it out of the stone slab….
Later, it became an after dinner thing (well, for those who ate dinner at reasonable hours) after the rest of them had realized that Bruce prefered to sleep at normal people hours.  And it’s not like it was every day, just some days, when they managed to coax Tony out of his workshop, and when Clint and Nat weren’t out on missions, busy with being Fury’s lapdogs
It’s been months since that night in the workshop so long ago, and Tony knows it’s not over, of course he does.  This isn’t an end because his life isn’t at an end, not yet.  The pills he takes aren’t magic and therapy isn’t a cure all.  He tries to take it slow, tries to realize this isn’t something he can rush through.
“God fucking dammit…” Tony muttered under his breath.  He couldn’t deal with this, this suffocating silence right now.  He pried himself off the couch, making a beeline for the elevator, with Steve right behind him.
Tony thought Steve would just carry him to his floor, but the man brought him into his bedroom and all but tucked him into bed.
“If Steve has something to tell me, then he can tell me, capishe?  I don’t need you to be his messenger bird, so just, drop it alright?  Now, I’m gonna go to bed, and you can go gather twigs for your nest or whatever it is you do at five in the fucking morning.”
Tony was blabbing on about the new Kevlar for his suit, practically bouncing into his lab with Steve trailing behind, urging Jarvis to pull up the specs as he ushered Steve over towards his desk–
“Classic, sure, but is there somewhere else you think we should start?”  And, well, no.  Tony really couldn’t think of anywhere else to start.
His name was called and the larger man kicked out, which Tony managed to dodge.  What he couldn’t dodge was the elbow that slammed down on his shoulder, knees buckling as his body slammed into the mat, blood pooling around his cracked nose.
Steve gulped, nodded, and grasped the purple handle, staring at his hand.   What he saw, however, nearly made him drop it.
“How do you not know who Stark is?  He’s like, the youngest kid ever to get into MIT, he’s 17 and he’s working on his doctorate!”
Steve sighed, rolling his eyes, and then proceeded to lift Tony off the fucking couch, throwing him over his shoulder.
Tony blinked.  And blinked again.  The words hit him like a bucket of bricks; sure, Steve could stay there, he could do whatever the fuck he wanted.  But what Tony couldn’t figure out for the life of him was
Tony blinked, and blinked again.  Fucking Stone.  He was nearly as bad as Hammer, but at least Stone didn’t look like a run over turkey burger.  No, Stone was a fine, fine man.  One the outside, of course.  On the inside he was just as snide as Tony, with an ego to match.
In that moment, he didn’t know why he had the gun in his workshop.  In that moment, he didn’t know that it was an prototype he’d thrown together for Natasha because, really, SHIELD issued guns sucked and she needed something good, something better than good.
He remembers seeing the name light up the New York sky for the first time.  Remembers thinking the building was ugly, obtrusive, unnecessary.  But that was before...before everything.
Tony’s eyes narrowed, but they didn’t hold the heat that they usually did.  In a sense, Steve was right, since Tony
“Jesus fucking Christ,” Tony muttered under his breath, setting down his welding torch.  “Fine, whatever.  Let him in.”
It would’ve been a bold remark coming from anybody, but more so because it was coming from Natasha.  Someone who’d been taught and forced to put her emotions second to all, and now here she was, talking about depression and feelings and well, saving him from himself.  And fuck if it didn’t resonate with him, because it was true, all of it was true.
“No!  I’m just saying.  She wasn’t that kind of woman, and you just seem to talk about her all the time, and it honestly baffles me.”
He stared at the man, who was now sitting in the chair beside him.  Tony merely raised an eyebrow at him.  He was well dressed, but in a suit, not in any sort of doctor attire.
Welp, that's that! I hope you all enjoyed it--if you've been here since the story started thank you for sticking with me, I hope the ending wasn't disappointing and was worth the wait.  If you've stumbled upon this as a completed work, I hope you enjoyed the story overall!  Regardless, thank you all for reading!
That would make this real.  That would make his desperation real.  He knows what happened with Natasha, but that feels...like a lapse in his psyche.  Like a misstep.  Knowingly admitting to someone how he feels about Tony, admitting to his guilt...that would make everything too real.
As the blade was yanked from the rock, Steve’s knees buckled, falling to the ground with a harsh scream.  His body felt as if it was encased in fire, his limbs shrieking in agony, muscles seizing, sputtering, spazzing.  His mind was screaming, screaming, screaming, screaming that he needed to find the man, find Bucky, save him,
Tony didn’t meet his eyes, instead choosing to stare at the small, round cactus Pepper had gotten him a few years ago.
But it wasn’t just the tone.  It was the question and really it was so, so unfair.  Slowly, Tony rolled off the bed, and began pacing across the room, refusing to meet Steve’s screaming eyes.
And he was so tired of it.  But he didn’t show that, because what kind of actor would that make him?
The man - Garner - chuckled, leaning back in his chair.  Tony stifled a sigh; he really wasn’t in the mood for this.  Any of this.
what an upgrade was?), and he didn’t care if it led him to, hours later, staring into the bathroom mirror with shattered walls and a broken grin.  What did it matter if he’s had more than a few fingers of scotch, despite disapproving glares from Pepper, and disappointed ones from Steve (which, somehow, seemed so much worse).
He was about to doze off again, when the door to his hospital room was all but slammed open, the rest of the Avengers marching in.  Well, Steve marched in, the others just walked in.  Like normal fucking people.
So yeah, he blamed Howard, because he was too much of a coward to come to terms with the fact that the only person he blamed for his shortcomings, for his failures, for his misfortunes, was himself.
“Why don’t you look at yourself and see?” Prince Anthony sounded almost….amused as he said it, lips pursed, as if he was trying to keep himself from laughing.
Right now, right now he has a bottle of god knows what and a glass of whatever and he downed the bottle and downed the glass because this isn’t heroic it’s not romantic it’s not something to be proud of, it’s a sickness and these pills won't cure it, they can only end it.
going to talk about this right now.  Steve had no right to pry - Tony didn’t care if he was the goddamn team leader or not.  Some things were just private.  And Steve knew that, of course he did.  No one ever pried him about Peggy, or Bucky--or
accusing him, he relaxed his shoulders.  “They were just in my room, I have no idea how you managed to lose your pants in my room.”
A scream erupted from his mouth, and he’d never been more thankful he’d turned the comms off.  No one needed to hear that, least of all-
“Government to give it some bells and whistles and then, and then let the thing be given to HammerTech which is just a joke, really, and then the thing tried to destroy me but I mean it all worked out on the end and I did okay, I really did, y’know, I mean I thought I did but apparently not because Fury didn’t even want me on the team then!  I fucking saved the fucking world and that wasn’t good enough for Fury because I’m a damn narcissist and I
Tony sighed, slumping down slightly, now realizing he was painfully tense.  “Nothing, just wondering.”
Tony peaked at what Bruce was holding; yup indeed, the stupid model he had lying around.  Oh well, it was good for leveling shit, anyway.
“Hey, hey what the fuck?  What do you think you’re doing?!” Tony squirmed, cheeks heating.  It was no use, of course; Steve’s arms were
Tony exhaled a sharp sigh, digging his face into the palms of his hands.  Clint, Clint, Clint.  Jesus.
And Steve knows Tony, he really does.  Knows him better than he deserves, perhaps.  He knows he’s not doing this to throw it in Steve’s face, that he’s not doing it as some publicity stunt.  He knows he’s doing it because he
His name was called and it was Steve, Steve looking down upon him with that damn sad smile that sent Tony’s ribs cracking and knees shaking, and it was Steve who held his last gaze as his world shifted from a fuzzy blur of color to complete darkness.
But that way is a one way ticket, and Tony’s at the point where when he’s in the right frame of mind, he knows that it’s not worth it, was never worth it.
And as to why he found it so cute, the way Nick would focus on such small details of the movie, like when Max ate the damn freaky lizard, or the whole seed thing, ranting on and on about them rather than focusing on the whole movie, well.
But outside of that, outside of his own, personal hang ups, he knows that instead of him being persecuted, it would just be him being controlled.  Either operate against the law and do what needs to be done, or be on the side of the government, and have the decision making ripped from him.
Tony pursed his lips, eyes darting over towards the discarded gun.  “You sound like you speak from experience.”
The man nodded, unconcerned as he reached for the lube, squirting a generous amount onto his finger.  Quickly, he played at Tony’s hole, teasing it until he thrusted inside, slowly at first, then growing faster as Tony adjusted to the feel of the man’s thick digit.
It isn’t until T’Challa is gone that Steve realizes he’s clutching the little, black phone in his hand.
When Tony eventually spoke his voice was quiet and his tone almost trembling, as if he were struggling to speak at all.  Steve listened with rapt attention but his eyes didn’t leave the bolded words in front of him.  “I didn’t know she was my mother until right before she passed.  She was always there for me, as much as she could be--which was still more than my dad was, but that’s, ah.”  He paused, clearing his throat.  “Anyways, she was always there for me, but I knew here as my aunt, not my mother.  I loved my mother dearly, and when I found out the truth it didn’t cloud the memories of my mother in any way.  I loved them both, I
Later that day, when Tony had isolated himself into the workshop, he realized that it was, in fact not a win.
He nodded absently, flipping open the folder as he began to read through it.  One of the first things he saw, however, made his breath catch in his throat.
Three or so years ago, it wasn’t something Tony thought he’d miss.  Then again, he didn’t think he’d miss any of Boston.  Not really, anyway.
At the tone of Steve’s voice, the room went stiff, the air thick and coiled with tension.  Bruce went to grab Steve’s shoulder as he inched closer to Tony, but the Captain merely shrugged him off.  “When are you going to learn, Tony when are you going to stop doing this shit?”
Again, Steve shook his head.  “It’s not that.  I just,” he sighed, not knowing exactly how to phrase it.  Trying to say it out loud made him realize how ridiculous he had been when he’d said all that stuff to Tony.  What, he was jealous because Tony had some pictures of Peggy on his desk?
“Lube...bedside table,” the man muttered, but Tony already knew this, of course, and was dragging the man with him towards the bed, letting himself be nearly crushed as he did so.
Tony didn’t know whether he was crying, screaming, or both, and he could barely make out Natasha’s soothing words as she shushed him, telling him that he needed to calm down, that it was okay, that he was safe, that he needed to pull himself together, that he was loved, that he was cared for, that he needed to take back control, that he needed to slow his breathing, that everything was going to be okay, somehow, some way.
The evening had gone as well as expected, with minimal questioning of his private life (and what he did get could be easily redirected).  The incident of 2004 hadn’t even been brought up, and he’d nearly forgotten it was it’s 9th anniversary.
about those lives lost at the hands of the Avengers, knows that he’s still trying to make up for New York, for Sokovia.  For the lives lost at the hands of his own weapons.
But they were trying, and that’s what mattered.  Steve, of course, was as wonderful as ever, making pancakes for the whole team, then slipping into the seat next to Tony and scooting him closer so their shoulders were touching.  He even rubbed against Tony’s feel with his own, which Tony could only roll his eyes at, because of course Captain America would like to play footsie.
The other man cackled, because apparently his name was hilarious now.  Which it was, really, the man was a joke, and it was about time the man himself realized that.
He couldn’t tell who it was -- could’ve been Clint or Steve, or maybe Nat but it didn’t matter because he couldn’t
That would make this real.  That would make his desperation real.  He knows what happened with Natasha, but that feels...like a lapse in his psyche.  Like a misstep.  Knowingly admitting to someone how he feels about Tony, admitting to his guilt...that would make everything too real.
“Can I kiss you?” Tony blurted out, and the words had barely left Tony’s mouth when Steve’s own lips were pressed against his, pulling him in for a deep, searching kiss.  Tony moaned into it, arching his back as he wrapped himself around the other man.  The kiss was anything but chaste, hot and needing and desperate, desperate to make up for lost time, desperate to remind themselves what could’ve been, wasn’t.  Desperate to be lost within one another, to feel nothing but one another.
I'm sorry this took so long! I was overcome by school and college and other real world priorities.  On top of that this chapter gave me a bit of trouble, so I hope it came out alright!  (Also this is going to be longer than the 2 chapters I had originally planned for oops).  Hope you guys like it!
“--People, and yes, there’s no place safer for him right now.  His friend was never the goal, he was just the bait, but now that the swords been drawn, he’s not after bait anymore.”
That level of friendship was reserved for Rhodey and Pepper.  They’d known Tony for ages, knew his past, and knew his present.  Well, somewhat.
Nor was they way Steve would look at him after a 72 hour working binge, with those ridiculously blue eyes and tell Tony to come up, go to bed, get some rest.  And fuck, how could he not?
And it was normal.  It was how they normally acted, really.  If, of course, Tony could ignore the hesitation in each of them, even Thor, as if Tony was going to snap in two at a crude joke.
Bruce was hovering over him, which was odd considering Tony’s lab usually made the man too anxious, and preferred the quiet order of his own.  Tony’s was apparently
As soon as he caught Steve out of the corner of his eye, he stopped his rant dead halt.  Slowly, his eyes travelled from Steve’s own pleading blue ones, down to the folder in his hand.
It seemed like ages, him sitting there, alone with nothing but with the whirring of machines and the dry sound of his own breathing.  In actuality, it was only minutes until another man strode into the room, one he didn’t recognize.
He scanned the room; Natasha nodded, firm but not unkind.  The others, however, seemed to only be looking at each other.
“Fury never gave me an actual file on Peggy, just some basic information.  Would there be...something else?  Something more classified?”
“...What actually happened to me?”  Steve remembered running after Bucky.  The cloaked man on the horse.  The sacred woods, the sword and then....
God, no.  Tony knew boundaries.  Well, alright, perhaps that was an overstatement.  But he tried to respect boundaries--especially when it came to Cap, after what happened before the Battle.
“Fuck off, Stone, I don’t need your petty shit tonight.”  And really, he didn’t. They weren’t kids anymore, they weren’t comparing daddy issues and circuit boards.  No, they were grown fucking men, and they should be reasonable business competitors.
“Look, I don’t know if you’ve met me, but I’m not Mr Touchy Feely, alright?  It didn’t seem important, and I didn’t really--”
But he has to, because he has to tell himself that the...Incident...was worth it, that it was worth it to get Bucky back, that it was worth it to treat his friends how he did, that it was worth it how he treated Tony--
He mustered up his best smile for her, and she nodded.  It was going to be hard but she knew that, of course she did.  It’s been hard for the last eight years, and if this had been any other gala, he wouldn’t keep going.  But honestly, it was his most important one.
“I’m bisexual,” Steve said with a small shrug.  “I guess I don’t really mind who comes knocking at my door.”
It was a stretch, a thin, thin stretch, but if whoever this man was could potentially help Bucky, then Steve had to try.
, he’d probably be easier to deal with because Tony Stark had just spent 36 straight hours “tinkering” in his lab, running on nothing but coffee and whatever Dummy had happened to put into the smoothies he kept making (hopefully nothing toxic, but it was Dummy.  Well, more accurately it was Tony’s workshop, so), and Tony had completely ignored the multiple emails and stacks of paperwork that were all courtesy of the most beautiful Pepper Potts.
Clint was still outwardly mad, but Steve had a suspicion that it was just a cover to mask his guilt.  Steve asked Clint for a favor, and if he had said no, Steve would’ve moved on.  But Clint did come, on his own free will, and as much as Clint wants to blame Tony for getting locked up, Steve knows that Clint understood what he was getting himself into.  What he was risking.
Feeling a bit smug Steve bent his head down to catch Storm's lips in a kiss. He took his time and let his hands wander everywhere he could reach. He really liked the chest hair. And the freedom to even do this in the first place so easily, the fact that no one who could come to know about it would really care, not about Storm being a guy.
He let the cock slide out of his mouth, but saw a drop of come gathering on the tip and licked it off.
And Steve wanted to ask what was going on between them, if there was anything. Tony's enquiries about his personal life indicated that Tony was perhaps interested in him, or at least having some sort of thing for him.
But, it was a moot point anyway, since Storm didn't seem to be interested anymore and he hadn't been after a relationship in the first place. Better just to forget about the whole thing.
”Great,” Storm said and turned to him. Storm put a hand on Steve's thigh and looked questioningly at Steve. For a second Steve thought about putting an end to the whole thing and just leaving, but instead he just nodded his consent.
Because he had no reason at all to be self-conscious about his body now – he knew what he looked like – but he had never been under any scrutiny in a situation like this. In a medical setting, sure, but not with a – a lover, if that's what Storm was to him now.
, he had no idea if they were something else or had rules or anything. All he knew was that he had expected their meetings to be a lot quicker – but instead they hung  out, ate and slept together. It felt a bit like dating to him.
Steve felt a blush rising to his cheeks and his cock filling into full hardness. Was that something Johnny wanted? Was that why he had put the porn on in the first place, showing Steve instead of asking?
Steve stared at them side by side, his chest feeling tight all of a sudden. Finally he went to take the suit down.
“That's between Bruce and me, I think,” Steve hurried to say. Not that Bruce would have spread other people's secrets, but still.
Afterwards, lying in bed with his head on Tony's shoulder, gazing drowsily at the arc reactor, Steve felt content for being the one to distract Tony from his mind when needed.
Steve wasn't sure he had thought through the whole going slow thing. Because. Well. Honestly, he was horny.
“I couldn't get matching pants?” Steve asked half jokingly, trying to wrangle into the undershirt, because the black shirt looked a bit ridiculous with his blue pants and red boots.
They went into a light and sleek establishment and Steve felt a bit out of place, but tried to ignore the feeling. He'd never get anywhere now if he started to avoid places where he wasn't completely comfortable.
He didn't hear from Storm for a couple of days and started to think that he had probably driven the man away with his lack of enthusiasm.
Before Steve could come up with anything, the elevator doors opened to admit Tony and Bruce. “What's up, children?”
“They're okay, but I'll keep that in mind,” Steve said, down to his boxers and undershirt. He hesitated only a second before taking his underwear off.
And so now in front of them Johnny Storm turned around towards screen-Steve and pressed a kiss to his lips. And screen-Steve didn't deck him or jump off the bike, but instead answered to the kiss.
Tony seemed to almost say something, but in the end didn't. Steve was glad, since it would have probably revealed Johnny's identity, or at the very least been something embarrassing.
“Oh. Yeah, it's probably bed time for supersoldiers,” Tony said and started to put his clothes back on. “I'll go to the shop for some work.”
Steve moaned almost desperately because of how wrecked Tony had sounded. “Please just do it already,” he almost pleaded.
Steve returned to the tower later, after Johnny had woken up and they had eaten breakfast. He didn't see Tony anywhere, but was stopped by Natasha, Clint and Bruce in the communal living room.
, he answered, since it was weirdly hard to ignore a personal message. He actually liked the text messaging thing. You could leave a message if you didn't have anything pressing to say or the other one was busy. Or if you just wanted to avoid the awkward silences.
Storm raised his other hand onto Steve's shoulder, taking it to the back of Steve's neck and finally sliding it into Steve's hair. They were like that for a while, making only slight adjustments to where their hands went, Steve finally having put his around Storm's middle.
”Yeah, anything's good,” Steve said while he was looking around Storm's place. The whole apartment was one big, open space, kitchen on the other end and Storm's bed on the other. In the middle there was a black leather couch and a huge TV-screen. He didn't have a dining table so he probably ate on the sofa. On various side tables and shelves the were some books and other personal items. On the walls there were a few posters of some movies and on the wall opposite the bed was a big mirror. Steve decided not to think about it too much.
And it wasn't like he thought Johnny would try to grate Tony's nerves on purpose, but Johnny didn't know how things were with him and Tony, didn't know about the jealousy and didn't know that Tony probably wouldn't like the idea of a threesome.
Tony turned his head a bit to squint at Steve. “You're not disapproving of your boyfriend's wild past, are you?”
Steve, instead of saying to Tony that he could continue, squeezed his muscles around Tony's cock and was rewarded with a deep groan.
“Why's that?” Steve asked. He thought it was great. It had red only as an accent color, so he didn't feel as much of a flag as usual.
“I just wanted to check you up,” he said and Steve was about to ask what Tony was talking about when Tony's hands were on his lower back and sliding down.
“I was wondering – “ he started, but grew silent when he glanced back at the screen. The darker one of the porn stars had his face between the other's buttocks, licking and sucking, thrusting his tongue
“Good,” Steve answered, not knowing how true that was, but not feeling like talking about personal matters. However, there was something he did want to talk about. “I saw you talking to him at the gala.”
“Yeah,” Steve said and started to think of an answer. He had meant slow mostly emotionally. He didn't want to be a part of Tony's break up with Pepper, and he wanted to be sure he wouldn't start a relationship just to not be lonely. They had almost explosive chemistry and Steve went sort of weak in the knees because of how good and decent and unselfish Tony was underneath it all. Also, he suspected he had a weird thing for jerks. Tony made him absolutely crazy and he wanted the chance to go a different kind of crazy and he didn't want to mess it up by hurrying and not solving their issues first.
It didn't take very long after that that a slight sweat broke on Storm's skin, probably at least partly due to Steve's considerable body heat, and he started to make all these half-choked moans that went straight to Steve's groin.
Tony moaned and slammed his other hand against the car ceiling, supporting himself so he wouldn't hit his head against it when he started to move with Steve's hand. Steve couldn't get enough of how Tony looked right then, legs spread, mouth open, cock pulsing and arc reactor shining like the goddamned sun.
“I will pay him back by kicking his ass in training session tomorrow morning. At seven,” Steve said, looking at Clint.
And if Steve just knew where they were -- was Tony really after a serious relationship with him? -- things would be easier. Because while the man had said he wanted everything, he had never really said anything about what his feelings were except insinuating that he appreciated Steve's body. And the looks – Tony never even smiled at him, only stared like he wanted to eat him. Or use him in some nefarious and kinky experiments.
Steve couldn't quite look at Clint and he couldn't answer to Tony either so he decided to look at the floor and pretend he wasn't there.
Tony said nothing so Steve tried to ignore his flustered feeling and peeked at Tony over his shoulder. He had spoken the truth when he'd said he was fine. His ass felt perfectly fine.
“Oh, yeah,” Tony said and, God, pushed a finger against him, then gently inside him, “You're great, it's like I never fucked you in the first place.”
“Yeah,” Tony said, still leaning against Steve his eyes closed even though Steve had once again stopped the petting. “Also, the first guy I've ever really wanted to date.”
That sounded a lot like Tony was hitting on him, but the last time they'd spoken Tony had been silent and reserved and the times before that downright rude.
After that it went quickly became Johnny returning the favor, with Steve lying on his back on the sofa and Johnny kneeling between his legs.
“That's what you think is going on here?” Steve asked surprised, walking closer to where Tony was, because that was quite a leap of logic in his books.
Steve wasn't too comfortable categorizing himself like that, but seeing the spy twins surprised was quite funny.
“Well, no. While I've been curious at times, I haven't really felt like I'd need it. When I was younger, when curiosity was all the reason I needed to do things, I didn't really do guys. Well. I've never really done guys. I mean, I've felt the attraction now and then and rarely said no to a free blow job, but that's about it.”
to go, but he was conflicted as to whether he should inform Tony or not. In the end, Steve decided that since Tony hadn't told him where he was or how long he'd be gone – Steve only knew because he had asked JARVIS – it wasn't expected of him either, no matter if it was with Johnny. Besides, it wasn't like Tony had anything to be jealous of anymore.
“Come here,” he said and was relieved when Tony did, not exactly throwing himself onto him, but a close thing. Their lips met, hard and demanding, and God, Tony could kiss -- open mouthed and hot and making Steve moan and pull Tony onto his lap.
Although he had no one who he could have texted with, really. The team lived mostly in the Tower. Coulson texted him sometimes, but his messages rarely needed any answers. They were usually just updates that he would get in briefings anyway.
Tony had a good tactical mind, Steve had to admit, because he was enjoying himself so much under Tony's hands that he could barely muster the energy to roll his eyes.
Steve swallowed his annoyance, because while it was none of Tony's business, it was also a harmless question.
The fight was almost over, Natasha was tying the terrorists up and Clint was keeping an eye out so no one would surprise them. Thor was in Asgard and they hadn't taken Bruce, since the fight had been against regular humans with big guns. Tony landed next to Steve, watching him silently.
”Oh Jesus fuck,” Storm moaned, quickening his thrusts. Steve recognized his hurry and pressed biting kisses onto Storm's neck, trying at the same time to tighten his grip on Storm's every thrust.
Steve tried to keep still, and mostly succeeded, but every once in a while he made an involuntary jerk due to Storm doing something wicked with his mouth.
Steve wasn't a person who dealt in hate, not really. Sure, there were people, things, like the Red Skull that raised anger, contempt and even hate in him, but that happened in a more abstract level. He didn't spend any time deliberately torturing himself by thinking about how disgustingly greedy and ruthless the Skull had been, how awful the war had been. He wouldn't forget, but he didn't let it fill him with hate and eat him alive.
”Hello,” Steve said, and tried to think if going back inside and taking a lift to the garage and getting his own bike would alarm Tony.
”Where were you?” Was the first thing he heard when he got out of the elevator. Clint and Natasha were having breakfast in the communal kitchen slash living room area.
Steve realized it was past midnight already. He gave it a fleeting thought, because it would be kind of comforting to fall asleep there on the couch to the sound of someone else sleeping in the same room. But. Well. If he was waking up alone, he'd rather do it in his own bed.
Steve's thoughts got distracted when he realized they were going way over the speed limit. Steve thought if maybe Storm was trying to impress him. Scare him, perhaps? So he'd hug Storm tighter? Weirdly enough he wasn't really that annoyed about the thought.
His helmet was in his room, though. And apparently it was illegal to not wear one when riding a motorcycle nowadays.
”This is from the Tower's outside security camera,” JARVIS voiced and a video clip opened on to the TV-screen before them.
As he continued, Tony melted against him and made low, approving noises every now and then. Seeing that he was practically sitting on Steve's lap, Steve began to feel turned on.
Later on, Steve found himself lying on his stomach, rubbing against the mattress with Johnny draped across his back, moving in the same rhythm with him. He could feel precum from Johnny's cock smudged against his lower back and buttocks.
Right. Steve cleared his throat. ”I don't know about all that fucking, but I guess I don't mind spending time with you.”
“Yes,” Steve admitted reluctantly. He wasn't ashamed or even embarrassed, but he was prepared for Tony to act stupidly about it.
“I see,” Steve said, not really sure what his stance was on getting fucked by Johnny. Or anybody really.
“So let me get this straight,” Clint started, finally gathering himself, “you've already bagged Johnny Storm and Tony Stark? Who's next, Hugh Hefner?”
The next time he woke Steve, Tony was nursing his hangover in the bathroom and Steve didn't think it was the best time for a talk.
Tony adjusted to the situation remarkably fast. “Embarrassed? What reason is there for you to be embarrassed? You've landed
Sitting on his bed, he contemplated activities other than punching a bag that left him feeling relaxed, but well. He had never initiated anything with Johnny.
On the way to wherever it came to Steve that it was the second time he was going out as in doing something outside the tower that wasn't something mundane or job-related. And the second time only if you counted the shawarma after the Loki mess.
Steve welcomed the slight pain of it because it cleared his mind a bit. At least until he started to think more closely about what exactly caused it.
, of course not, but seeing the arc reactor that close, being able to press his face against it, it really hit home that Tony Stark was with him now.
”You know, it's not just that I don't do well with orders, it's the taking orders from a stuck-up, self-righteous prick that's the bigger problem here.”
Mouthing against Steve's back, Tony started a slow rhythm with his hips and Steve melted into it, letting it relax him. Then, just when Steve was starting to wonder if Tony was actually going to do it, he changed his angle and started to slowly push his cock in.
And that was nice, Steve thought. Not that he would be interested in going clubbing or whatever, but still. He sometimes forgot that they were friends.
“We're trying to get Cap to tell us who's the lucky girl,” Natasha said and Steve thought that hunger would have been preferable to this.
“He was, but left for the party after he came home and found that you had deserted the premises earlier on.”
Steve entered using his code (at least it worked; not a bad sign) and found Tony sitting in his chair, a glass in hand, not doing any work as far as Steve could see.
And even though he had said it mostly to Tony's chest, Tony probably heard it, because he let out a soft
JARVIS had woken Steve up so late it was practically morning, telling him that Tony was back and gone straight to bed.
Storm moaned into his mouth and started to lift his hips in a rhythm to Steve's hand. Steve pushed Storm down, never releasing his grip on the man's cock, and supported himself with his other hand just above him, leaving a bit of room between them. Storm's hands flew almost immediately to Steve's back and ass, trying to pull them tighter together. Steve let Storm take most of his weight, tucking his face against the other man's neck. It made it harder to move his hand, but Storm didn't seem to mind, being content to just push into it.
Steve stared at Storm for a little while, because while he wanted to, really quite badly, he had his issues. The fact that he hadn't ever done this before, for one. And the perhaps naive and overly romantic notion that he wanted sex to mean something, for another.
Steve tried very hard not to speculate on what that meant. Before he came up with anything to say, Tony sent another message.
Steve kissed him, deep and hard, intending to purge every ridiculous thought out of Tony's mind at least for an hour.
And that was why he woke up hours later, early in the morning, Johnny's leg thrown over his thighs. It sort of hit him then that he had slept with Johnny Storm.
Steve did and was rewarded with a deep groan. It turned Steve on too, sucking a man's cock, but he thought the biggest thrill was probably seeing the other's pleasure: hearing Johnny's breathing quickening, feeling how hard he was in his mouth. He started working his hand and mouth simultaneously, sucking every time he brought his mouth upwards.
He wasn't quite so comfortable with himself that he could have rocked his hips the same way Storm had done earlier on the sofa, so he took Storm's erection into his hand and started to pump it slowly. And that, feeling another man's full cock in his hand, the slight burn of a stubble against his face, was just as heady as he had imagined.
“Jesus fuck,” Tony moaned and Steve wondered how you could want something so much. Not just wanting sex, to get off, but wanting to have someone so close to you and inside you and wanting to be inside them. Tony's cock was hot and big in his mouth and all he wanted was to gag on it.
Johnny gave Steve a once over. ”On the other hand,” he said, his voice a lot lower suddenly, ”now it wouldn't be incest.”
Steve leaned a bit backwards to fight his jacket completely off while Tony opened their belts and pants' fastenings.
Since he was staring at the two men, he saw when both of their gazes turned towards him. Johnny was smirking lewdly and Tony's smile was so fake Steve had trouble looking at him.
Steve just gave him a reproachful look before standing up in front of Johnny and sliding to his knees.
, he wanted to say. That he hadn't meant for Tony to be so subdued and careful around him all the time, even censoring himself.
”Oh, please, spare me your pep talk shit. Bottom line is, there's no way I'm going to do as ordered if I can clearly see a much better course of action. That's how I've always done it and it has worked quite well so far.”
Steve rolled his eyes. ”You're missing the point. I don't care who's idea the plan is as long as everybody's on the same page. If you think you know better, ask first, inform me and the team first. You're leaving me totally blind as to what to do with others if you can't be arsed to tell me what the hell you're up to!”
”You sure you never banged anyone with the name Storm? Or Brown? I mean, how cool would it be to have Captain America as your granddad? Also weird, since you look almost younger than me,” the guy said with an infuriating smirk.
It was late afternoon after he'd just come home from a jog when JARVIS told him that Tony had finally left his rooms and migrated to his workshop. Not wanting to wait any longer and risk missing his chance, Steve skipped the shower and headed straight to the workshop.
Steve could feel Tony pulling his fingers out and changing position behind him. He reflexively braced himself but instead of pushing inside, Tony draped himself over Steve and rubbed his cock against his crack.
Steve stared at him, because really? He could understand being the butt of a joke, but Storm seemed to be serious now. Well. And really smarmy.
It was warm and heady and when Storm licked at his mouth, slipping his tongue in, Steve started to feel turned on. And he felt a bit embarrassed about it, because he hadn't been sure if he would find kissing Storm arousing and anyway, this was the most he had ever done with another person.
“On one hand, I'm enjoying seeing you in something I made, but one the other hand I'm wishing you'd take it off.”
Steve became careless for a second, just wanting it to end so he could go home and sulk. He didn't get his shield to the right position in time and took a bullet to his left shoulder. He couldn't help a groan, but at least it cleared his head a bit. He took the shooter out with the shield.
“You don't need elaborate plans for that. I promise I'm easy,” Steve said and started to pull Tony towards the elevator.
Being careful with his left arm, Steve opened Johnny's pants and pulled them down with his boxers. Johnny slid a bit closer to the edge of the couch so Steve could reach better.
Although Steve really didn't think he was that good company, very much the opposite actually. So perhaps Storm was just lost.
Steve was just about to decline when he realized that he was scared of a little bike ride with Storm. That he was a bit ridiculous. If Storm drove a bike, and a nice one as well, it was very possible that he didn't have a car or didn't even think to take one. It might not be a plan to get Steve to sit snugly behind him.
”Yeah, well, the Avengers is for helping people and saving lives and you could try to remember that instead of taking offense at every little imagined slight against you! I'm not there to please you, to do as you like, I'm there to try to keep the team together so we'd be as good as we can be!”
Storm went to kneel between Steve's parted thighs and before Steve really got what was coming, Storm had taken a grip of his cock and closed his lips around it.
Steve felt somewhat embarrassed when he took Johnny's cock into his hand, but a look at Johnny's face gave him all the courage he needed to just go for it. It was good to be looked at like that.
Tony said nothing else and when Steve went to sit opposite him, he stared at his sludge, avoiding Steve's eyes.
Steve was slightly surprised, since Tony didn't usually offer rides for them. Then he saw that the arm of his suit was almost completely drenched in blood. Steve wanted to decline still, but knew that if he lost his consciousness due to blood loss, he would be a nuisance to carry around.
Steve gave him a look, but complied, taking his time opening the buttons. Under the button down he had an undershirt which he pulled off quickly afterward, trying not to seem modest.
And then Tony. God. The man had apparently really decided to do the slow thing, because he didn't propose anything or didn't even try to make them
Okay. They waited their food in silence then, giving Steve time to stare at Storm. It wasn't like looking into a mirror, thank God, but they could be brothers. Storm's features were softer and a bit rounder, he had darker hair and he was shorter and leaner. But they had the same eyes and mouth.
Storm was far quicker with the stripping, partly due to Steve helping him to pull his pants off. At the end of it, they were both gloriously unclothed, Steve standing next to the bed and Storm sprawled on the bed, and Steve let himself look, taking in everything, every nook and line and shape. Since he hadn't yet had a good glimpse of Storm's ass, he thought his favorite part was probably Storm's pectorals that had a nice dusting of chest hair.
Johnny looked really enticing and Steve thought about just getting them under the covers and close to each other. He didn't need sleep though, and he wasn't sure sleeping like that with Johnny would be welcome or not weird.
Steve would have gladly liked to stay just like they were for the foreseeable future, sated with a half-naked Tony in his arms, but he knew that Tony must be uncomfortable.
“What?!” Steve exclaimed when he was roused from his thoughts. “Are you an idiot? You think your telling me you love me is going to make me want to let you go?!”
”I didn't 'get it on' with him and it's not any concern of yours anyway with whom I do what, since you're not my boyfriend and certainly not my friend!”
Leaning on just one arm, he dropped his head down and took himself into hand and that was it. He came so hard he thought for a second he'd lose consciousness, a huge wave of pleasure flowing through him.
When he felt like his arm could support him without concentrating on it and he could actually form a coherent thought, he realized Tony had stopped but not finished.
Steve was slightly apprehensive when he got back to the Tower. He parked his bike in the garage and took the elevator up. He had never stayed away the whole night for as long as they all had lived in the Tower. He hoped no one would notice or care.
“For his boyfriend he is,” Steve answered and that concluded the conversation as Tony pushed him against the elevator wall and began to take Steve apart with his lips.
“What?” Tony asked. Steve said nothing but tried to convey his wish through his gaze. Luckily Tony seemed to be good at wordless sex talk.
He'd gladly be masturbating right now, to be honest, but instead he was bored out of his mind at some sort of national security themed gala. He had a lot of people wanting to talk to him, and he went along with it politely, but most of his attention was focused on trying to catch Tony's eye from the other side of the room.
“So,” Tony began after a while, now caressing Steve's behind and thighs, “how do I rate against Storm?”
Steve felt heat rising to his neck and pondered what to answer for a moment. He wasn't really sure what was included in 'making out', or what Storm meant with it. But well, he could put a stop to it if things got too uncomfortable. And he could ask Storm what he was after.
