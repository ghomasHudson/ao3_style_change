Dean snapped his eyes open, expecting to find himself laying on a rack, bound and chained. His organs ripped and splayed around him. But he wasn’t lying on a rack.  He was laying on ice. An endless expanse of frozen water and fog that disappeared into pitch blackness. Frigid, dark and burning with cold.
It was then that Dean looked down at his hands. They were gripping onto the bar. His hands shouldn’t have been able to grip the bar. They should have been broken and disjointed, barely able to move, let alone grip a steel bar hard enough to rattle the cell door. He shouldn't have been able to walk to the bars in the first place, but as he took another step, there was no pain in his ankles.
“Pretty damn important. Bobby opened the web browser on Sam’s computer, pulling up the front page of Youtube.
His left shoulder was a scar that burned slightly brighter than all the other scars. It was a vestige of angel grace. Castiel’s grace.
He sat squeezed into the motel room’s arm chair, a cold cup of coffee resting in his hands as he tried to keep his eyes open. Sam listened to the sound of his brother’s strained breaths as he went in and out of what Sam could only hope was sleep, praying that the sounds continued, just as he had done all night and morning.
Castiel kissed him back. Harder and deeper. He grabbed Dean’s jacket, turning him and pushing him against the front of the front pew, He slid Dean’s beanie off of his head, letting it fall to the floor as he dug his hands into Dean’s hair.
Mary stared into her dresser mirror, her hands running absentmindedly over the small bump protruding under her nightgown, pushing ever so slightly against light blue chiffon. A few short months ago, her belly had been flat and unblemished. Now it was
that I can do about that. If the angels or ‘Dad’ or whoever the fuck else don't like that, then they can go fuck themselves, okay?”
Castiel’s feet touched down inside the church’s now-deserted vestibule. The stench of sulfur, smoke, and blood washed over him as he landed. It had almost completely overtaken the scent of roses, but he could still smell it, ever so faintly.
“Peachy,” Dean winced. He limped his way over to Sam, a hand pressed firmly against his shoulder. He paused, shooting a look of confusion at his brother. “How the hell did you
“I’m scared shitless. But like you said, I don’t have a choice.” He tied a wool army blanket to the top of his duffle bag and then looked up, meeting Castiel’s gaze. “The one choice I know I do have is to not sit on my ass.”
“He won’t have the stomach to do what you will ask of him.” The demon smirked. “And because of that, you will lose.”
:: David Koresh was the leader of the Branch Davidians, a religious cult and offshoot of the Seventh-day Adventist church, located in Waco, Texas. He was believed by both himself and his followers to the Final Prophet and Messiah. In 1993, a raid was conducted on their compound, the Mount Carmel Center, by the U.S. BATF. A later siege conducted by the FBI ended with the compound being burning to the ground. All of the occupants, including David, were killed.
Sam scoffed. “Dean doesn’t have a ‘connection’ Jesus. He doesn’t even have Faith.” He raised his voice, frustrated.
Breathing heavily, Dean stood and made his way into the bathroom where he quickly splashed his face with hot water.  Pressing his hands against his eyes, he mumbled to himself. “I fear no evil, for you are with me. You are my rod. You are my staff...”
:: Saul of Taurus, better known as Paul, was an Apostle. He was not one of the original twelve Apostles, having never met Jesus during his lifetime. According to the Book of Acts, while on route to Damascus, Paul was struck by a white light that blinded him, during which he heard Jesus’ voice, was converted and named an Apostle. Paul preached predominantly to gentile pagans and made Christianity more accessible to Greco-Romans by removing the need to observe Jewish dietary laws and circumcision that the original twelve maintained. He is also credited with composing most of the New Testaments’ writings.
Sam dragged it quickly across the flesh, creating a wound that was long and deep. He dropped the knife on to the bed as he licked his way up her thigh, capturing the streak of blood before it fell onto the bedspread.  When he reached the wound, he sucked on it viciously.
- loved Castiel. Maybe that love was his own. Maybe that love was a vestige-a memory. Dean didn’t care. All he knew was that he never said it. He never could. Love wasn’t a word that fell easily from Dean’s lips. It was something he could never attain and if it was attained he could never keep it. Whether it was with Cassie, Lisa, or anyone else.
Dean had remained in bed for almost eighteen hours; the longest he had ever done so. Every few hours, Bobby would bring him tomato soup and crackers or a glass of water, checked Dean’s vitals and changed his bandages. Sam visited in the early afternoon bearing clean clothes and cherry Jell-O.
Dean had been walking into a grocery store early Thursday morning when the ache began, a sharp ache that radiated through the whole of his body. It stole what little appetite he had, weighing him down with heavy sadness. He knew the ache was merely a harbinger of things to come.
“I know, son,” Bobby replied, grabbing Dean’s wobbling shoulders to steady him. He quickly grabbed one of gauze bandages and unraveled it, wrapping it around Dean’s head as delicately as he could manage. When Bobby finished, he picked up a bottle of consecrated wine, putting it against to Dean’s lips.
Sam was quiet as he moved on to Dean’s wrists. “I’ve gotta get some fresh bandages. We’re getting down to the wire here.”
He was aloof, distant, often invisible. Were it not for the presence of the angel’s grace, Jesus wouldn’t know he was there. Before Jesus could speak, the angel placed two fingers against his forehead, and the world went black.
“Lemme get this straight.” Bobby leaned forward, shooting Dean a confused look. “You left your brother and your car to hitch hike across the lower forty-eight with nothing but a damn duffle bag?”
but a disappointment to me. You always have been and you always will be. The only thing you’re good for is cannon fodder.” John glanced up to the ceiling. “I can only imagine what He thinks of you now.”
:: According to Roman Catholic dogma, not only does the Eucharist become the literal body and blood of Christ via transubstantiation, it is a literal replaying of the crucifixion and is considered to be a sacrifice on par with the crucifixion.
“Yeah.”  Dean hung up his phone, shoving it back into the pocket of his jacket and starting the Impala and driving out of the parking lot.
Castiel’s eyes narrowed. Carefully, he lowered the sword hidden up his sleeve, letting the weapon slide into his hand. Before he could strike, however, Zachariah knocked the blade out of his hand and slammed him against one of the olive trees. He pressed his own sword against Castiel’s neck.
Just as he had plunged the angel sword into the other soldier, Zachariah grabbed Castiel, knocking the blade out of his hand.
Dean looked up, setting his eyes on a young nun dressed in a dark brown habit, standing next to his pew. “Yeah, I’m fine.” He nodded, giving her a half-feigned smile. “I’ll be even better tomorrow afternoon.” Dean paused, his voice shaking. “Hopefully.”
?”  Miriamne paused. “Are you some sort of prophet? A miracle worker?” Wonder didn’t leave her voice.
“Rough day?” The bartender, a young woman with choppy black hair and arm tattoos asked, looking up from a sink filled with dirty glasses.
Dean took a deep breath. “The soldiers didn’t stop,” he sobbed, narrowing his eyes. “They just kept punching me and kicking me and ripping my beard out. I wanted to kill them, Bobby. Each and every single one of them. But I—I couldn’t. I had to go through with this. I—” Dean’s chest heaved. “—I had a job. I had to protect them,” Dean paused. “I had to protect him.”
It offered shelter from cold and seclusion. It was sanctified ground which brought with it safety and, as Dean was hoping, communion with the divine. It was everything Dean wanted, everything Dean needed. It was perfect.
Dean furrowed his brow. Even though he loved fishing, he didn’t want to go anywhere. “Do we have to?” He took an apprehensive sip from his coffee.
It was The Soul. It was Jesus bar Joseph. But it wasn’t Jesus. He bore a different face and figure.  He was taller and his skin was pale and freckled, his hair a sandy brown.
Dean chuckled. “But what about the other side of it?” he asked. “Giving yourself up—no holds barred— to God? After everything you’ve seen, all the evil in this world.” He shook his head. “How do you do that?”
“You are meant to fight Lucifer and his army, Dean,” Castiel said bluntly. “You must do as you are fated to do.”
Dean watched him for a moment, furrowing his brow. “Man, you really are jealous, aren’t you?” Dean shook his head. “Tell me Sam, would you want
“It’s okay. She’s gonna be fine now. Don’t worry.” Dean walked over to Susan and hugged her. After she calmed down, he pulled away. “Can you promise me something, though?”
Zachariah’s body lit up in beams of blinding white light and high pitched noise. In an instant, the light faded and he was gone. Vanished.
.” Dean took a sip from his coffee, watching Jimmy he couldn’t wrap his mind around the fact that the man sitting in front of him, sucking down this milkshake like it was manna from heaven, wasn’t Cas anymore. And yet everything about Jimmy was different. From the way he smiled at the simple pleasure of his milkshake, to the tone of his voice.
“I mean the boy’s skin should be black and blue and his stomach should look like a damn water balloon and he’s not even
- that this was a bad idea,” Dean said, pulling the lights out of the outlet and wrapping them back up.
“Cas.” Dean let out a soft groan, his eyes slamming shut. “Fuck.” He shuddered, opened mouthed and breathless, running his hands through hair on the top of Castiel’s head.
Jesus shook his head. He took a deep breath. “We won’t have to.” Jesus pointed into the corner of the room where there were six large clay vats, filled to the brim with water. “I collected that this morning.”
It’s kinda not the point. Mathew just couldn’t read Hebrew worth a single crap and Luke was trying to rip off Hercules. The kid’s as much
Castiel paused for a moment as he glanced around the church. “We need to talk, Dean.” His voice was serious.
Dean loved Castiel and he never said it. Now he couldn’t say it. Castiel was gone. Dead maybe. And if somehow he wasn’t, the chances were good that the love was ripped out of him by what Heaven had done to him.
Castiel stared at the demon’s corpse for a moment before he followed Anna.  “What was that demon talking about? What won’t Jesus have the stomach for?” he asked.
stay. He couldn’t watch The Righteous Man die again when there was nothing he could do to stop it. Not again.
Dean watched as Rufus put an antique silver candelabra with eight arms on the kitchen table, opening a box of candles and pulling two out. Rufus was wearing a kippah, large and cylinder shaped and made out of embroidered silk. It was the only time Dean had ever seen Rufus wear one.
Dean paused, his breath shaking. It was followed by the sound of sniffling and rustling against the speaker
Jesus and the Apostles had been traveling on the road to Gerasa, a mostly pagan city with a small Jewish population, when they came across a cemetery located on the side of the road, a short walk beyond the city gates. They had just passed the first sarcophagi when they heard a growl, low and guttural, coming from within, stopping them dead in their tracks.
Sam grabbed Dean and pulled him up off the floor, walking them as quickly as he could manage into the bathroom. He helped Dean sit down on the toilet. Dean groaned as Sam got him a glass of water which he pushed away. Dean managed with Sam’s help to get his shirts off, wincing sharply as the blood-drenched fabric pulled his torn skin.
“You return to Nazareth and preach to the people there. After that, you’ll go out into the neighboring towns and villages and preach to them. When the time is right, you’ll reveal yourself.”
“No,” Dean replied, trying as best he could with his stiff, broken fingers to pull the blanket back over himself. He paused. “Not yet anyway.”
“Well, we haven’t checked in with him in a while and he’s up in bumfuck Vermont all by himself. During the Holidays. Somebody should check on him.”
A month and a half passed by in much the same way as it always had for the brothers. A vampire nest taken out in Tennessee and a salt and burn in Indiana. But things had also become very different, taking the form of broken Seals and fallen angels. There was a demon not seen for six centuries raised by a witch on Halloween and an angel reborn as a young woman. The brothers also found themselves trapped in a motel just outside of Raleigh the week of Thanksgiving courtesy of a blizzard, the newest round of ever-increasing demonic omens.
Cas was silent for a moment, his eyes locked hard on Dean. When he spoke, there was a hint of reverence in his voice. “As a matter of fact… you are.”
It was then that he saw her. Ima. Mother. Dean knew it was her. The voice in his head, the one he’d come to know so well, called her such with fear and desperation. It
Dean’s sleep wasn’t plagued with memories of his own torment, but by dreams that did not belong to him. They were still familiar, full of sorrow and suffering. The dreams were accompanied by a voice, one that Dean knew was not his own. Though the voice was heavy with pain and spoke words of doubt, anger and abandonment, it was never malicious. It was always gentle. And Dean didn’t fear it like the voices he heard in his own memories.
. You’re the most saved person on the planet and you don’t even wanna be.” He pressed his palm to his temple. “Every time I have to watch you heal someone or get visited by an angel—Hell, just being in the car with you, smelling those goddamn roses—I’m reminded of how
“Right.” Dean pursed his lips. He cleared this throat. “So...I gave Peter-the first pope- the keys to Heaven, right? Rocks. Foundations. Gates of Hell.  All that stuff. He acts as my ambassador on Earth, right? Well...I’m on Earth so... I’m your boss now.” Dean took a deep breath. “And as your boss I’m asking-
“You know this is a bad idea, right?” Sam chuckled. “This is the kind of church you said you wanted to
Mary stiffened. “No.” She stared at Jesus, her eyes wide with shock. “How could you do this?”  She quickly turned, running outside into the walled courtyard.
“Because you needed my help.” His voice was blunt. “This journey has become too much for you. You’ve gone as far as you can go.”
Dean sighed. “Wonderful.” He paused, staring for a second. “So what was this, some kind of hallucination or something?”
Sam was sitting in the Impala, a CVS bag full of gauze wraps resting on the seat next to him. A local rock station that he hadn’t bothered to change played Red Hot Chili Peppers’ ‘Under the Bridge’
Dean wouldn’t receive The Spear until late the following afternoon and there was a good chance he wouldn’t even be there to witness it.
and His impending conquest over Darkness and Death. It was the commemoration of the birth of the Christ child, when God was believed to have entered the world, incarnate as a human being. The Spirit and The Flesh, dwelling together as a single entity.
In Sam’s arms was an unconscious Ruby, a thick stream of blood running down her neck. Lilith lay motionless on the floor in a crumpled heap.
“Like I told you before, you daft heap of bird sinew, we didn’t come here to rip the family of The Nazarene to shreds,” the demon spat. He glanced up at the Enochian devil’s trap painted on the ceiling. “Though I’m certainly changing my mind on that.”
to wear while they went shopping with Rowena and Charlie- but of the four of them, her clothes fit Dean the least, and so he was stuck with this… and he wasn’t quite sure what to think of it.
“Nobody’s hurt?” A lifetime of using Sign Language served her well, for while she had much bigger hands that seemed to move slightly more slowly than her usual rate of speech, she had no difficulty making the signs.
He’d wanted to talk about that kiss with Cas, but it was obvious that Cas was pretty shaken; he’d have to make time to find him later.
Dean shrugged. “It depends. Watching the extended versions can take like eleven hours without breaks.”
The only other thing that gave him pause was the electric tension that thrummed between him and Dean. It had changed tone a bit, with the spell- it had always been there, but it was stronger now, charged and expectant, and he couldn’t help but think that this was because Dean only pursued women, and as far as other people could tell, Castiel looked like a woman now. But even loving Dean, even wanting him in this manner, even thinking that reciprocation might be a more likely possibility in this form, wasn’t worth it if he didn’t feel at home in his own skin.
Thank you all for the amazing feedback! We've got a bit of a timeskip, so you don't get to see what Dean was up to with Charlie just yet, but I promise I wouldn't have mentioned that detour of theirs if I didn't intend for it to come up again later.
this dress- and you said you wanted to have fun with the experience while it lasted. Balance, young padawan.”
Cas looked down at his hand, startled. “I’d forgotten that I’d retrieved it for you.” He handed the jacket to Dean, who put it on, buttoning it over the tear in his dress. Dean then cocked his head towards the bunker’s entrance.
“Eileen and I fit pretty well in each other’s clothes and were thinking of just swapping wardrobes for the time being, maybe head out together in a few days if it looks like it’s going to take a while. Dean’s the outlier here that doesn’t fit into almost anything, so you should focus on him, but should probably take care of Cas and Jack as well.”
Cas shook his head, trying to move past the thought, and followed Dean the rest of the way to the door. As the door swing open, Charlie grinned at them. “Oh wow, you weren’t kidding, were you? Wow, Handmaiden, I always thought you’d be hot as a woman, and damn was I right!”
This kind of thing happened far more often than Dean liked; angels sending overzealous people of faith to him as part of some personal revelation. It started happening soon after he began healing people and it was becoming a frequent occurrence.
“I think Dean has this well in hand right now. Now is not the time to chastise Jack- he was terrified when Dean and I got here a few minutes ago and Dean has only just been able to calm him down.”
Shaking his head, he settled more comfortably into the office chair, and began to read. In the background, he could hear Dean come into the garage and start moving about- the creak of the pipes as he turned on the hose, the repeated splash of the sponge into the wash bucket, the small noises of exertion he made as he stretched and contorted himself to reach the car. At one point, he even heard a disgruntled huff, followed by dragging over a stepstool- likely to reach the roof of the vehicle, since Dean was much shorter in his current form.
It wasn’t that the woman he saw in the mirror wasn’t gorgeous- a nice balance of athletic and curvy, wearing a matched set of lingerie that he found very appealing. She just didn’t feel like
Dean held one of Cas’ shoulders, using his other hand to gently guide Cas’ chin so they were looking each other in the eye. “I would have made the time for you.” He marveled at how steady his voice was. Things he would have stumbled over saying at any other point in his life, flowed easily right now, and the only thing he could attribute it to was his changed appearance, and knowing that nobody expected for him to project the mask he was used to wearing after growing up as he did with John Winchester, driven Hunter extraordinaire. “And I know that as Hunters we typically have a ‘uniform’ we stick to, but that doesn’t mean we can’t use our clothing to express ourselves.”
So just a heads up- I might be going through and editing this whole fic from the very beginning at some point. If I do that, what I'll try to do is I'll try to hold off posting the last chapter until I've finished editing, at which point I'll upload all the edited chapters, and then I'll upload the final chapter, and mention the edits in the author's notes; that way I can give a heads up to everyone who's been with me from the beginning. Even without those edits, though, I'm really proud of what I've written, and so glad that so many of you like it. It means a lot to me. I keep getting comments about how much it means to you that I've written this, and made this such a trans narrative, and those comments are absolutely what keep me writing.
He already knew it was soft, and it fit well, but because they’d been in a rush to try on so many things at the time, he hadn’t taken the opportunity to really take his time to look at it. Now, though, he had that spare moment.
Finally, after they looked at the wine list, Dean’s distress was intense enough that Cas leaned across the table. “If you need to, we can leave. Rowena had suggested this establishment- you and I both know we can afford it, and it
(But of course I also always love all of my regular commenters too, thank you so much for reading each new chapter I post).
“If you want to, I guess. Since Charlie’s planning to stay a while, she might have more to bring down than we can manage by ourselves.”
“It was quite irrational, I recognize that now, but I was trying to… scrub away the pieces of this body that don’t fit right.”
“And you wouldn’t think I was being ungrateful if I wanted to be a little kid for a while? Or even… If I wanted to grow up from being a little kid?”
Jack explains what he was really trying to do with his spell. Dean tells Cas and Jack about what childhood meant for him growing up with John.
A young woman was staring in horror at the couple stirring in front of him. Her long, blonde hair was falling in her eyes, but even from across the room Dean could see that they were blue- the same shade of blue as Cas, as Claire, as Jack.
Dean scowled. “We had our reasons,” he groused, “and maybe they were stupid reasons but we managed to fix everything eventually!” Cas could see him rubbing at his forearm where he’d once been branded with the Mark of Cain, and he reached out to still Dean’s hand.
“Really?” Jack was smiling now, his eyes still shining with tears but his face warm and open and full of adoration.
Dean chuckled at that. “I probably should grab a good jacket- according to Charlie, they’re one of the only good alternatives to purses, since, like, none of these clothes have good pockets. I’m guessing you’re a bit better off in the pockets department yourself, though?” He turned to look at Cas, and found him wearing that outfit with the suspenders he’d liked so much, with a tie he didn’t recognize but that matched his dress- he could see Charlie’s hand in getting them ready for the evening. “Nice choice!”
The third thing he noticed was the woman in Castiel’s clothes. Same suit, same trenchcoat, same tie, sprawled on the floor of the kitchen just like he’d been just a second before, looking just as disoriented as she pushed herself up across from Dean. Her face was initially obscured by her dark, messy hair, but as she pushed the hair out of her eyes, Dean could see they were a striking shade of blue- and that she had a beautiful, heart-shaped face. But why was there a woman wearing Cas’ clothes?
For a moment they just stood there, eyes locked. Dean was beyond glad that, even if his vessel looked different right now, Cas’ eyes still looked just the same.
“What do you want me to say?” Cas could feel Dean resting his forehead against the back of his neck, pressing his entire body as close behind Castiel’s as physically possible. For all that Cas was uncomfortable with the changes to his own form, he felt no discomfort with the changes to Dean’s; he loved Dean eternally and would continue to do so, regardless of form or gender.
After a while in the women’s section and in and out of the fitting rooms, though, Dean was pretty sure he’d have to try another tactic soon. They’d finally narrowed down what size they thought Cas should be wearing in this form, but even in garments that supposedly fit correctly, he looked decidedly uncomfortable. At wit’s end and ready to tear his hair out, Dean didn’t hear the sales associate approaching until she spoke.
I’m turning into a walking crucifix and makin’ Chianti outta tap water.” He was quiet for a second before a sarcastic smirk spread across his mouth. “Who am I? Jesus Christ Superstar’s follow-up album?”
even.  A welcome change from what their lives had become. There were no trench coat sporting angels, no threat of broken seals or the very real possibility of Lucifer being freed from his Cage. They weren’t dealing with the impending Apocalypse. Just a three hundred-year-old dead girl throwing a fit. It was familiar, comparatively easy and nostalgic.
Dean found himself lying on the sleeping bag, his body curled into itself and his hands pressed against his temples, clawing at the crown around his head. His eyes were slammed shut, stinging with tears and blood and his throat stung. Raspy and raw.
“Don’t worry.” Dean stepped in front of Susan, extending his arm out. He looked back to them and nodded. “I’ll take care of this.” He made his way over to the woman.
He pulled the sleeve of his jacket up slightly exposing his right wrist. The scar had become a wound again. Shallow. A small pool of bright fragrant blood bubbling up from it.
The sound of Ruby’s gasps and moans as he drank her blood helped Sam forget that the Impala’s cabin, for as many times as he and Dean had cleaned it, still reeked of roses. For once, he couldn’t smell them at all.
“No. I— I’ll be fine. I’ve got a cellphone.” The woman took a step onto the porch. She turned and faced Dean, staring at him in awe. “Tell me are— are you—” Her voice shook. “Are you… Him?”
Jesus had seen the angel many times while he walked through the desert.  He’d seen him standing behind palm trees and on top of rock bluffs, hovering in the hills outside the tent of a Bedouin family who had given him shelter.
Just before reaching the Impala, Sam stopped, looking at her. “We’re putting this Lilith stuff on hold. I gotta go right now.”
Before James could say anything, Jesus stepped forward. “No,” he said confidently, “I will read it.”
“Great,” Dean took a deep breath. “So I can add ‘hearing prayers’ to my resume.” Dean paused. “You think it was Holly?”
Jesus didn’t say anything. He took another sip from the goatskin, focusing his gaze on the flames and heat of the fire. While he did this, the angel walked over to him, holding a wooden plate covered with a cloth.
“You know, of all the things I can do, all the people I’ve been able to save, I can’t save him.” Dean bit his lip, looking up at her. “Shit, Sister. I can bring a perfect stranger back to life, but I can’t even do my one job: protect him.”
any easier.” Bobby’s words were blunt but sincere. He looked at Sam sympathetically, his lips fixing into a concerned frown. “But you gotta be
Jesus walked over to where an older man wearing a nice tunic was speaking to Dinah’s father in law. He threw back the cup of wine he’d just gotten in one gulp, letting the warmth of the alcohol fill his belly.
Jacob squinted. “No, you’re not. “Dean” doesn’t have the power to exorcise demons with just a few words, nor can he bring people back to life. I watched those demons stab Molly in her stomach and liver. You don't survive that. But you… you put your hand on her and suddenly she’s awake and talking? Like it never even happened?” He watched Dean for a second and then chuckled. “You know, I heard a rumor you died last year. Somethin’ about a crossroads deal. I thought it was just that. A rumor. But I guess I was wrong.”
Dean was thankful for that. He was even more thankful for the dive bar within walking distance of the motel. The special that night was a heady combination of half-priced apple pie shots, a curvy brunette bartender, and friendly local barflies who assumed a Midwestern drawl meant an honest game of pool that Dean took full advantage of.
Dean was in the woods behind the Novak’s backyard with an ax in his hand, surveying the trees, an endless sea of sugar maple and oak. Finally, he found a pine tree, he walked over to it and grabbed one of the lower branches chopping at the base of the branch with the ax.
Placing the tree in the stand, Dean and Bobby fiddled with the tree’s position for a while until it was straight.
Bobby awoke to a throbbing head and water dripping on his face. He opened his eyes to a twilight sky covered in black clouds, thunder booming in the distance.
One by one, the parishioners filed out of the church. As soon they were all gone and the church was empty, Dean lay down on the pew and closed his eyes.
Sam shoved a ziplock bag containing one of Dean’s t-shirts into the front pocket of his hoodie and knocked.
“Thanks for everything,” Jimmy said, climbing out of the backseat of the Impala. He closed the door, walking to the driver’s side. “I really appreciate  it.”
Reluctantly, Dean lifted himself up onto the side of his bed and gasped, feeling his pain spike. He hunched over, shaking, wrapping his arms as tightly as possible around his torso. Out of the corner of his eye, Dean noticed bright red blood stains covering the comforter in streaks and blotches. Despite the stitches and the layers of gauze, Dean’s wounds were
To Bobby's shock, the gashes had turned into scars. They were no longer open wounds, jagged crevasses of torn and punctured skin, but raised purple bumps. The same was true of the wounds on Dean's wrists, ankles, and back. Even the gash on Dean's side had scarred over.
Jimmy grabbed a straw and stuck it into the milkshake, taking a long gulp.“Six months? Maybe longer. I’m not sure.”
Dean stood up from the bench, narrowly avoiding the puddle of vomit at his feet, and walked over to bars. He grabbed them, the chain of his cuffs clinking against the steel.
“Jesus Christ, Sam! The cologne I can deal with, but I draw the line at puttin’ some fruitcake air freshener in my car!” His voice was strained.
She sat there quietly for a moment, listening. The muffled, faint sound of music could be heard coming from down the hall. From the soon-to-be nursery. Fear filled her instantly.
On Christmas Eve, after an eleven-hour drive from Savannah to Pennsylvania to check out what Dean was hoping would prove to be demonic activity in Centralia, Sam demanded that they take a break, using the holiday as the perfect excuse for one. They had spent the last three weeks working almost nonstop all along the southern half of the eastern seaboard. Dean had become so engrossed by his quest for hunts that he hadn’t even bothered shaving.
“Thanks.” Dean chopped at the branch, it broke off. He didn’t say anything as he crouched down, chopping the twigs from the branch. When he started shaving the bark off, he cleared his throat. “Is-Is Jimmy still in there?”
“And if we can’t prevent the breaking of the rest the seals and Lucifer does rise?” Castiel cocked an eyebrow.
“It should, because that’s not a threat, Son of David. It’s a promise.” His gaze shifted briefly to James before turning back to Jesus. He smirked. “He’s coming soon.”
Dean decided to stay at the convent. Though his wounds healed over by Friday afternoon, he assumed they would open up again the following Thursday and he didn’t want to risk leaving the convent and ending up someplace where he was alone if that happened.
“How do you feel, Sam?”  Rudy asked, walking over to him, her feet kicking up dirt and gravel.  Sam could barely even see her in the shadow cast by the train bridge underpass the car was parked under, sitting in a large section of road shoulder, her body only visible by the headlights of the lone car that passed by them.
He didn’t know what, if anything, would change if he allowed John to baptize him. Maybe he wasn’t worthy and maybe he was. Either way, the answer was something he feared. So he held back. He kept quiet, listening to his cousin’s fiery sermons and watching as John baptized his followers in the river.
“Officially? No. As far as the Church is concerned, it’s far more likely that the person is exhibiting something purely psychosomatic. But, if God had a
The demon wearing Father DeMatteo nodded. He walked over to Dean, pulling a knife out of his blazer. “How’d you like to be crucified upside down? By the balls.”
He spent the rest of the night trying to locate the Apostles, but to no avail. When the sun began to rise, he made his way in the direction of the Antonia Fortress, where the Roman Prefect and garrison in charge of watching over the city was stationed.
“Exactly. By his very nature, Dean Winchester is now closer to Our Father than any of us have ever been and yet he has no respect for Him, or us for that matter.” Uriel paused, cocking an eyebrow. “Have you ever once heard Dean Winchester
“I know. It just-” Dean paused. “It just feels like I need to find some sort of middle ground Between us. Ya know?”
been forming in the wounds, there were bruises. Dark maroon bruises with shallow veins of crimson in them.
Dean glanced anxiously around at the throngs of parishioners seated in the plush pews as they entered the chapel. The sanctuary was large, but despite that, it was nearly full. Much to Dean’s dismay, the only seats the brothers could manage to find were on the aisle, a row from the front. He hoped he’d get through the service unnoticed.
When they were little, Dean would read the Bible to him as a means to fend off boredom during power outages or when the motel room television didn’t work. Each of them had their favorite books. Sam liked the Psalms and Dean liked Judges and Samuel—the stories of David and Samson. Dean had even taught Sam to read using motel Bibles.
With that, Sam stepped into the bathroom. He glanced nervously at the strips of used, drying gauze hanging down from the shower curtain rod. “Did the wounds open up last night?” He asked, his tone concerned, but awkward.
Finally, the punches and strikes ceased. The mocking voices disappeared.The voice and it’s weeping soon followed and Dean found himself hunched over on the floor of the bathroom, his body leaned up against the side of the bathtub. His trembling hands pressed against the sides of his head, trying desperately to claw at the digging wreath to no avail. He could feel it poking into his skin, but there was nothing around his head.
.” Sam’s words were blunt as he walked over to the car, his eyes glancing at Dean, no more wounded than he was the day before, as he leaned himself against the trunk.
Slowly he stood up, his dizzy eyes glancing around the salvage hard. The Impala was still parked in the driveway, but Sam was nowhere to be found.
He heard heavy footfalls come to a stop next to him at the end of his pew. A tattered trench coat fell into his peripheral vision.
Dean rounded the corner of the building. Panting, he began kicking the wall, hard and repeatedly, cursing himself until his boots had made a sizable hole in the cheap plaster. Finally, he turned back around, pressing his back against the wall as he slumped down onto the frozen pavement, his arms wrapped around his bruised ribs. Tears began to stream from his eyes; he wiped at them forcefully, relieved to see that they were no longer red.
have the adverse effect of breeding pride,” Castiel mused. “Sometimes those with no Faith at all lead lives of far more virtue and righteousness than those with an abundance of it.”
James was silent. After a few moments, he cleared his throat. “Well, once we get away from home, once we leave Nazareth, things will be different.”
smell of roses.” The priest sat down in the pew, turning to the side. “And you have the look of a man who has the world resting upon his shoulders.”
Lilith screamed. Golden light began to radiate from her vessel. It lasted for a few seconds before stopping. Lilith’s vessel breathed heavily.
The first thing Sam noticed as he walked into Ruby’s motel room was the smell. A blend of bleached sheets and towels, and lived-in room-funk. It smelled like a motel room and nothing else. No lingering stench of fermented grapes in what had previously been half-drunken glasses of water. No engulfing scent of roses, like the odor that had even begun to linger upon his own clothes as much as it did Dean’s.
Sam sat there in silence for a moment before he grabbed his jacket off the end of his bed, throwing it on his shoulders as he quickly left the motel room, slamming the door behind him. He marched himself over to Castiel and Uriel, angry tears welling up in his eyes. “
“I can’t do that. I won’t leave you here!” Castiel paused. “I can’t say farewell to you. Not like this.”
:: Divine Julius is part of the Imperial Cult that identified emperors as divinely sanctioned authorities of the Roman State. The two most noted for deification were Julius Caesar and Augustus. Temples were built for them across the empire. Augustus, as Julius Caesar's adopted son, was referred to a ‘Divi filius’ or ‘Son of the Divine One.’
Dean paused. He shrugged. “I just needed time by myself.”  He picked at the wood grain, tracing the pattern with the rough edge of his index finger. It was a nervous tick Castiel had seen many times before.
you are. You are...the most beautiful human I have ever known.” He paused. “I’m glad that God-fate- has brought us together again. Even though I know you’re something I can’t have.
:: The Messianic Secret is a motif in the gospels of Mark and Matthew where Jesus commands his Apostles not to tell anyone that he is the Messiah.
was the one who worked and hustled and whored my way through every shitty motel you dumped us at, all to make sure there was food on the table at the end of the day for Sam, even if that meant I went hungry!
Sam climbed out of bed, washing his hands and face in the small kitchenette sink before pulling on his boxers. He fell back onto the mattress, idly tracing the stain of crimson on the bedspread.
The memory flooded Dean with guilt. A kind of guilt that Dean was all too familiar with. It was the same guilt he felt every time he drove through Fort Douglas, Wisconsin, where that shtriga had attacked Sam when they were children, the same guilt that had that driven him to make a crossroads deal. A job he had failed to do. A sibling he had failed to protect.
“Abba died,” Jesus said. “Suddenly I had to care for seven younger siblings and a grieving mother who was with child. I had too many mouths to feed as it was to worry about adding a wife and however many more would come along.”
“Son of a bitch,” Dean muttered, wiping his eyes. He left the barn, making his way back to the Impala.
because it’s my job to know.” He shrugged. “Also, the paint is blue. Ain't exactly rocket science to figure that one out.” He glanced over at the neatly painted squares on the nursery wall. “I’d go with the Carolina Blue.” he nodded, a grin quirking his lips.
“I know I’m his son. The angels called me such when I was in the river.”  Jesus sighed. “But after Michael came to me, I tried to speak to Ima about it. To see if she knew anything. She just began weeping, mumbling something about the Archangel Gabriel.”
Just then Miriamne walked out.  She walked over to them slowly, her gaze locked on Jesus. “If you’re ever preaching in Magdala and you need a place to stay, my father has a very large house.  He’ll give you shelter.”
With a groan, Jesus rose from his mat and walked over to a shelf where a jug of water and bowl rested. He quickly washed his bony hands, the right one bruised along its knuckles, whispering a prayer while he did so.
It was a foggy, ancient memory. Cas-darker skinned, brown-eyed and dressed in a long wool tunic-drawing a sigil in the sand, making a slashing motion with his palm before placing it on top of the sigil.
When the bright white light dissipated, Castiel found himself lying on the ground of an alleyway strewn with pieces of shattered pottery. He stood up slowly while he brushed away the shards from his vessel’s tunic, feeling his grace root deep within the molecules and atoms of the body. The flesh trembled ever so slightly, fighting to contain him.
Dean paused for a second. He glanced down at the gas gauge. Half-full. He would need to get gas before leaving Sioux Falls.
Dean remained quiet. He lowered his eyes to the floor, pinching his lips, his eyes closed shut for just a moment before he looked up again, locking his gaze squarely on Sam. Dean limped over to him, his fists clenched.
A question finally broke Dean’s concentration. “You’ve got a strong devotion to The Blessed Mother?”
.” Zachariah watched Castiel for a moment. He gave him a smug smirk. “The fate of the world is more important than the life of one ape. Even if that ape is the man Our Father has chosen as His Son.”
“Careful.” Castiel caught him just as his feet touched the ground, his legs instantly buckling under the pain. “I admire your determination, but it’s still going take some time for them to fully heal.” He carefully placed Dean back on the bed, steadying him.
“Come on Bobby,” Dean sighed. “I’ve spent the last month listening to nothing but church organ music.”
Dean grimaced, swallowing down the taste of wine and blood as he lay back against his pillow, hissing sharply as he pulled and pressed against the wounds on his back.
Near the cemetery’s edge, Jesus found a man wearing a bloodstained tunic. He was bound by iron chains and ropes to the innermost sarcophagus, the sides of it painted haphazardly with eyes and pentacles. Steam rose from his skin that touched the manacles around his wrists and ankles.
Dean may have been suffering, and while that did frighten Sam with the ever-looming possibility of Dean dying again, it angered him just as much. Dean’s suffering was a sign that Dean was
Sister Joan nodded. She folded her arms. “There’s been a spike in demonic activity around here lately. Possessions. Electrical storms. It’s gotten worse in the last month or so.” She paused. “Probably because you’re here.”
He wandered the streets for a while. Eventually, he ended up walking past the Cathedral of Saint Patrick. It was white bricked and looked more like the churches of the Southwest—Mission Style—which struck Dean as odd, given that its patron saint was Irish. On the sidewalk, placed above its sign, was a nativity scene. Reluctantly, Dean walked closer. He stood in front of it for a moment; his eyes locked hard the little painted ceramic infant resting within as he listened to the muffled sounds of an organ and choir, the Christmas hymns coming from the church.
“Pretty much. It’s an ‘As Above, so Below’ kinda thing.” Dean gestured with his hand, pointing up to the sky and down to the ground.
“I was...”Dean licked his lips, thinking fast. “I was in Missouri chasing a meth head through a warehouse. When I grabbed him, the son of bitch threw me head first through a window.”
low and desperate, through the speakers. His eyes quickly darted around the parking lot before he took a flask out of the pocket of his jacket. He tapped the mouthpiece tensely against his hand until the dregs of the cool dark red liquid dripped onto his palm. Sam licked it with a relieved sigh.
Sam climbed the steps of the cottage; its wood was painted in a colorful blend of oranges, greens, and reds, stark against the two ancient weeping willow trees that flanked it on either side. The red front porch bent and creaked under his feet as he ascended, scuffling against the steps. From the front window, Sam could see that the house was dark, save for the low glow of candles that lined the windowsill.
A sad smile spread across Dean’s face as he wrapped his fingers around the steering wheel. This was the first time in a week he had sat in the Impala’s—No. In
Uriel scoffed, disgust filling his voice. “You listen to me, you tainted mud monkey. Your brother might be able to give us orders, but
Jesus grabbed the wine, saying a quick prayer before taking a sip from it, the alcohol stinging his cracked lip. He relished the pain. He took another long drink then put the jug on the ground next to the table. With trembling fingers, he grabbed a hammer and chisel from his work bag and began chipping the rough side paneling slowly until it was uniform and smooth. He was a third of the way through the second panel by the time the sun had fully risen.
“Can it. You’re not the one that’s been driving for the last seven hours,”  Bobby said, sinking into the armchair with a groan, closing his eyes. “After my nap I’m gonna do some laundry. Then we can do some lore digging. Figure out where Sam and Lucifer are.”
Dean sighed deeply. He closed the space between him and Castiel, hugging him. “It’s good to see you, man.” Dean held on to him for a long moment before pulling himself away. “What happened?”
For ten days this routine repeated. Jesus would wake each morning to fresh bread and a full goatskin of water. Sometimes he woke up to fresh firewood, sometimes an extra jug of water and basin to wash himself, sometimes sewing needles and thread to mend his worn-out clothes, but never once was the angel there.
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean saw the glint of an angel sword at his feet on the floor. He reached down and grabbed it, thrusting it into Azazel’s chest. He watched his body stiffen and glow before he yanked the blade out, pushing the body to the floor.
At first, it made Castiel angry, but soon, none of it mattered to him. Under Naomi’s constant poking and prodding, Castiel began to forget. He forgot Jesus’ humanity. The way Jesus smiled and laughed around his third cup of wine.  In time, Castiel even forgot the reason why Jesus had died. The
“That’s why you always wear the same holy tax accountant getup? Cas, why didn’t you say something? I would have been glad to help.”
Charlie glanced back at Cas and his long, messy hair. “You’ve got a point there. Alright- we’ll grab jackets, and then I’ll take care of checking out here while I send you off to get haircuts. Make sure to have fun with it, Handmaiden, this is the kind of experience that doesn’t even come around once in a lifetime for most people.”
And Dean hides the tears that prick his eyes at that admission by looking away and taking a sip of water instead, and he says, “there was a good few months there when I couldn’t ride Princess because of how much she reminded me of you- but other than that, whenever I missed you, I’d take her for a ride.”
“You flew? But I thought- I thought none of you could fly anymore! How is that possible?” Dean looked up at Cas, and realized the position they were in, with Cas cradling him in his arms. Noticing Dean’s disorientation, Cas helped Dean stand now that he was lucid enough to support himself.
Charlie shook out her fist from where she’d punched Sam in the shoulder. “Dude, don’t make assumptions.”
And though he had no need to sleep, he let go of the last of his senses, closing his eyes, completely blocking off his perception of the world.
Dean’s offhand but sincere remark filled Cas with a warmth that caused him to grin back at Dean, almost involuntarily. “You could. But I’m glad I’m here so that we don’t have to find that out for sure.” Giving in to impulse, Cas stepped forward the last couple of steps, and pulled Dean into a hug. Dean stiffened at the contact, but then relaxed into the embrace, winding his arms tightly around the angel.
Dean’s anger turned cold. “Don’t you dare go there, Sam. You do not want to have this argument right now.”
“That sounds like a plan- good thing we unloaded my car, it should have enough room for all four of us and some clothes.”
Dean was in the middle of changing into some loungewear. As Cas watched, Dean pulled a pair of grey sleep pants up over the swell of his ass, obscuring a pair of pale green panties, his torso still bare. Cas stood in the doorway, transfixed; while the first thing about Dean that Cas always noticed was his soul, his body was also beautiful, even in this form that did not properly match the person it contained. Once the sleep pants were settled properly at Dean’s hips, he stretched upwards, and Cas traced the lines of Dean’s back with his eyes, noting all of the scars the man before him wore as badges of pride.
That little movement was enough to derail whatever train of thought has been running through Dean’s head, and he refocused his gaze, taking it all in. He stepped close, and began buttoning Cas’ shirt closed, each button reducing the tension. Once the shirt was fully buttoned, Cas felt himself being herded back to his chair, where his jacket was pulled around his shoulders and he was encouraged to sit.
“You were his kids! He was supposed to love you! How could he do that to you?! That’s not what dads do!”
And he goes back to Cas’ table and everything he’d been choking down over the years that passed since that week they spent together start bubbling up and he finds himself choking on tears instead, and he tells Cas that he doesn’t have time right then, but please,
A cool breeze ruffled Dean’s skirt- and left his chest feeling chilled. He quickly glanced down at his dress, noting the jagged tear. “It’s a good thing this whole looking like a chick thing is temporary, man, this was a nice dress.”
“Nah, Samantha’s always been halfway to being a girl anyway with that long hair of his,” Dean joked. At Cas’ unimpressed glance, he held up his hands. “Kidding, kidding! But yeah, it is definitely strange, but I know it’s not going to be like this forever, and honestly I’m more uncomfortable with how short I am and how my body doesn’t move the way that I’m used to. Sometimes I’ll be walking past a light switch and miss because I’m going off muscle memory but my arm doesn’t reach as far as it should.” Dean grinned again at this. “A feeling I’m sure you’re familiar with, Mr. My True Form is the Size of the Chrysler Building!”
“You know, it’s funny, but we all have shitty fathers in common, depending on how you interpret that: John, Chuck, and Lucifer,” Cas tried injecting levity into the situation. Dean snorted, and Jack chuckled. “It’s like we’re a club. The fucked-up fathers club.”
“You were out for just a moment. I- I flew us here before I even realized I’d done so, before I even thought to heal you.”
Still holding his best friend’s hand, Dean pulled Cas with him back to his room. His heart started pounding, torn between the stressful conversation he knew was coming, and his thoughts about pulling Cas back to his room at other times, for other activities. He’d been thinking of that more and more, even before the spell; about holding Cas and touching him and leaning in and-
Dean watched happily as Sylvia smiled at Cas with sympathy and started guiding him through the racks of clothing. “Don’t worry, I’ll help you make this process as painless as possible. What are we focusing on today? Do we have a budget we need to stick to?”
Dean plucked the cell phone out of Cas’ hand and opened it up, standing outside. Cas returned inside to the coat check, and had to sit through an uncomfortably long process as the clerk had difficulty finding the garment in question, a number of guests walking past him to exit the establishment while he waited. Finally, he had Dean’s jacket in hand, and turned to leave the restaurant.
Eventually, Dean leaned in closer, his brow creased with worry, and Cas melted into the embrace- but then he cringed with embarrassment as he felt Dean reaching past him to turn off the shower instead. But then Dean was back, actually holding him this time, and he let himself be led out of the shower and into the room that Dean had set aside for his use a while ago, the room where he now kept his new clothes on hand for the duration of Jack’s spell. There, he felt Dean guiding him to move his limbs into clothing, and then he was being pushed onto the bed.
“That sounds like an excellent idea, Dean.” He stood awkwardly between Dean and Jack, and did his best to smile for the camera. When he looked at the photo, his face fell a little. “I know it’s only temporary, but I feel like I’d only just gotten used to what my face looked like before, and now photos like this feel strange.”
It had been sublime agony to kiss Dean, and he’d wrenched himself away and fled the moment he could.
As they left the restaurant, Dean waxed rhapsodical about the pie and how he had to figure out how to make it at home to share with everyone, before stopping suddenly. “Oh wait- my jacket!”
Before he could think, he dropped his angel blade into his hand, ready to kill the man before him, but his movement caught Dean’s eye. “Wait, no, he’s human-”
They made a brief stop by Dean’s room. “Look, I know I probably shouldn’t use my tools on Baby right now, and we haven’t taken her out for a drive so she isn’t dirty, but even if she doesn’t need it, I always feel better after giving her a good wash, so I’m gonna change into something I don’t mind getting messy, and then we’ll head to the garage. You can stay in your room, you can grab something to change into and join me, you could grab a book and just read while I’m blasting some of my music- but I figured you needed out of there with the nerd squad.”
“What he means to say, kiddo, is that he’ll be more comfortable when he’s back in his usual vessel again- but that’s alright, that’s pretty true for all of us.” Dean winked at Cas, and he relaxed. “I mean, I’m having some fun with it first, but I gotta admit I
Sam relaxed with relief, before stiffening again. As he turned towards where Jack and Dean were still talking quietly, his face darkened. “He knows better than to do spellwork unsupervised- I was right there and he didn’t even bother to ask!” Before he could walk over and reprimand Jack, though, Cas stepped in front of him to ward him off. “Cas?”
calmed down, the two of you may talk about this, but if you try to press the subject now, you’ll make it worse for you both.”
Cas was standing there, hand raised to knock again, looking gobsmacked at Dean’s bare chest and panties showing through the front of the robe.
a childhood when he asks for one, Dean? On settling down somewhere? I thought the life of a hunter was good enough for a kid!”
three. And it was okay at first, it made sense, because there was Lucifer and Apocalypse World and then Michael, and it wouldn’t have been safe, and it wouldn’t have been fair, but it’s been quiet lately. So I wanted… I wanted what I was missing out on. And I guess… I guess I missed that the spells were gender specific when I pulled that from them- but I was trying to get the outward appearance to match the fact that I’m supposed to be three right now.” Jack was shaking while he gripped Dean’s hands, and Dean was so glad that this had worked, that he’d gotten through to Jack and Jack wasn’t terrified of him anymore, and he was also so heartbroken to hear what Jack had been going through.
Their smiles were small, tempered by the exhaustion and pain of Dean’s long recitation, but Cas felt Dean shake his head and sit up straighter. “So what I was getting at, kiddo, was that, while I did my best to make sure Sam had a childhood, I never really had one. So I
“About whatever’s going on with Jack? I know you pulled Rowena to the side to chat about it so she had a better idea of what spell he was
They’d met briefly over the summer, when Claire stayed in the bunker for a week recovering from a rough vampire hunt. She’d also been trying to avoid Jody, although that last part didn’t work out very well for her when Jody dragged Donna, Alex, Patience, and Kaia out to the bunker to keep her company while she recuperated. In order to keep the peace, he and Dean had taken Jack and Claire out a few times, and Claire had seemed to enjoy having a little brother; they still chatted a few times a week, and Claire had talked about possibly getting everyone together at the bunker for a big meal sometime in the fall. “But not Thanksgiving,” she’d said, “I like my big family celebrations without a side of genocide, thanks.”
“What was it Bobby said? ‘Kids ain’t supposed to be grateful, they’re supposed to eat your food and break your heart!’ And he was right, you know.” Dean paused for a deep inhale. “I’ve always been
He got a smile for that, warm and affectionate, and for a moment color rose to Dean’s cheeks and his eyes grew wide, before Cas replied, “I could go with you.”
Thanks to everyone who has read, commented, and left kudos! I’m excited that people are enjoying this little plotbunny of mine, and it really is encouraging me to keep working on this fic and to revisit some of my other WIPs that I haven’t looked at in a little while!
At first while Sylvia guided him around the store, helping him find clothes that fit his current form correctly but also helped him feel properly like himself, Dean followed along and provided emotional support. It was gratifying to walk out in something and see Dean smiling at him with both thumbs raised, occasionally tossing out a “looking good, handsome!” or a similar quip. But after several minutes of following him and Sylvia around, he drew Dean to the side.
-and Cas heard a thump and looked up just in time to see Dean lying flat on the hood and windshield of the car, having lost his balance and slipped in the soapy water he hadn’t rinsed off just yet.
Dean’s quiet laughter shook the bed. “Shit, I can’t even remember the last time I was interested in anyone else. It’s been a few years at least. Before Amara, I think- Crowley and I went and had some fun, but once I wasn’t a demon anymore, I only had eyes for you.” His arm tightened around Castiel’s waist, and he pressed a kiss to the back of Cas’ neck. “So- since you’re on board with this, with me, I can definitely say that I’ll kiss you again when the spell is broken, I’ll kiss you again as often as you’d like. You aren’t the first guy- or well, guy-shaped person, I guess- that I’ve been attracted to, you know. Haven’t done much with any guy who wasn’t paying me for it, but it’s not new.”
Dean opened his eyes and looked right at him. “I don’t know where I’m suddenly getting the courage to do this,” he said, dragging his hands up to where Cas’ shirt was unbuttoned, curling his fingers into the fabric. “Stop me if you don’t want this.” His voice was low and husky, and it matched up with the glow of Dean’s soul through his skin.
“Oh, I just. I think it might be time to talk about that. And normally saying something like that would freak me out, but right now it just feels right.” Dean rocked back on his heels and stood up. “Alright, even though I’m feeling better than I usually would when talking about something like this, I think this conversation could use something to drink and someplace more comfortable to sit. Jack- wanna get your bear and meet back in my room? We can sit on the memory foam for a while.”
Dean tilted his head back and laughed. It was a bit weird, his usual belly laugh coming out so much higher and clearer, but at least it felt the same as it always had, and he took another look at the dress in his hand before smiling and putting it back in the pile. “You’ve got a good point- let’s round this out with some PJ’s and then see if we can find Cas and get out of here.”
“Right? And purses can be such a pain!” Charlie exclaimed as she came up beside them. She pointedly looked at where Dean was holding Cas’ hand, but then looked him in the eyes before he could drop it, and winked. “So- I was thinking it’s cold enough out, you won’t look out of place wearing the right kind of jacket, and we can try to find a good one with lots of pockets- that’s my usual go-to solution.”
Dean was turning him, pulling him out from under the spray, wrapping him in a towel, his face frantic. There was nothing wrong with his ears, but he couldn’t hear anything clearly, even though he could see that Dean was trying to say something. After a few attempts where he could tell that his face remained blank with a lack of comprehension, Dean tried using the sign language he’d learned for Eileen, but the way he moved his fingers made no more sense to Cas than the noise rushing in his ears.
“But I mean, I know you’ll have to get back to research at some point, so I’m fine if it ends up being just me and the kid towards the end there.”
Now that I'm settling into a new routine, I'm hoping to be able to write and update more consistently for y'all. I am always so glad whenever I read comments from you about what you liked about my fic, and what you noticed about it, and I'm really hoping I can do a better job of giving back to you all. Thank you.
“She thought it was hilarious and tried to get me to send her a picture of Dean, but I didn’t have a good opportunity to ask.”
They stepped back, and Dean glanced away to keep from being caught up in Cas’ gaze again, where he noticed that Cas was clutching something in his hand. “Hey, is that my jacket?”
Originally I’d planned for Charlie to have the transgender/dysphoria conversation with Cas, but then Dean and Cas seemed to need some time together and the idea of Dean instinctively correcting someone for calling Cas his girlfriend was too perfect- so I created Sylvia to fill that role.
Cas stayed quiet for a moment. Dean stroked his hand down Castiel’s arm, back and forth, and the sensual touch helped to ground him even as the wave of static in his head threatened to break over him. “I want my own body back.”
By the time Dean met back up with Jack and Charlie, they’d found an impressive collection of clothes for Jack to wear for the next few weeks. “Should we bring you back here after the spell is broken, pick up some of this again then so it fits after?”
Cas grimaced. “Sam and Eileen seemed rather busy when I knocked on their door. I could… try to help instead?”
“What do you mean, working on it? I know you’ve just been reading novels over here, so what could you possibly be working on?”
When Castiel had come out of the changing room to find Dean talking to an attractive young woman, jealousy had initially swirled in his gut- until Dean had called him ‘sweetheart’, implying that the two of them were dating. At that point, though, Cas didn’t have much of an opportunity to analyze the situation, as he was ushered into the changing room again to take off the sundress he’d found so distasteful so they could start their search over.
“As it should be, Handmaiden.” They grinned at each other, before Dean winced at the lights in the hall again. “Hey, let’s get you to your room, I’ll get you some water and tylenol, we can put on the Lord of the Rings and have a little sleepover, just the two of us?”
“I will, I promise! I’m having a blast, kiddo!” Dean was glad he hadn’t let go of Cas’ hand when he felt his thumb caressing him gently, and he turned a softer smile in his direction. “I hope it’s starting to feel a bit better for you, too?”
Dean is still feeling restless after his fight with Sam, so Cas decides to take Dean out as a distraction, remembering Sylvia's suggestions.
“Are you… comfortable?” On the surface, it sounded like Cas was asking about the dress he’s wearing, but Dean knew there was more to it than that. Cas flushed a little at Dean’s curious gaze, and then continued. “You seem to pride yourself on being a fairly masculine man, but of the four of us you’re in the most… feminine clothes. It doesn’t bother you?”
