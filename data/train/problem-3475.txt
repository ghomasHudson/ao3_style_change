Dean waved his hand and made a face. “A minor detail.”
“May I sit with you?” Aaron gestured to the open spot at the picnic table across from Cas. “I don’t really feel like eating lunch.”
“Yes,” Sam said outright and crossed his arms over his chest. He waited for Dean’s expectant look and then explained. “You told me in one letter that you were on leave until the 22nd. But then in the next letter, you said you were only staying til the 19th. So... what happened?”
The letter left Castiel smiling and laughing to himself. He wondered if Dean realized he was quoting that old war song about separated lovers in his signature line. The thought that perhaps he did only made Castiel smile more. They weren’t lovers, of course, they barely shared two kisses, but it was enough to make him wonder. What would happen when he met Dean in Chicago, 19 days from now? Two or three nights sharing a hotel could mean being themselves, out of the public eye. And that could mean all sorts of things for the two of them.
Castiel didn’t say anything, he dropped one hand to grip the front of Dean’s shirt and pull him along towards the bed. His other hand lifted to steal the fedora off Dean’s head, placing it on his own.
“The ride wasn’t long. Let’s go to the lounge.” Castiel gestured to the door, “Is now good?”
Cas arrived at the house a little after 4:00 in the afternoon, letting himself in. The Novaks lived in a fairly large house, having not suffered much from the Depression. Their family had always been rather well off, and though they had cut back on daily spending during the 30s, the outward appearance of their home hadn’t changed much. With a three story home, well manicured lawn and plenty of rooms, all well furnished, they looked as if the economy hadn’t touched them at all.
Jessica laughed and looked down at her plate. “You boys...”
Since he couldn’t look at it, though, Dean settled for closing his eyes and imagining Cas’s face, his smile, the mischievous light in his eyes whenever he was making a joke. He thought about the man’s deep, gravelly voice and the unexpected fullness of his laugh and his smooth, hard muscles. A smile spread across Dean’s face as he pressed his cheek into the pillow, imagining Cas’s neck and the light prickle of his stubble before he shaved in the morning. Dean had it bad, he knew, and he really didn’t care.
It was Thursday evening and Dean was leaving town in the morning. Mary arranged for a nice dinner to see him off. Sam invited Jessica to join them for dinner, so Dean could see her one more time. She was over early, helping Mary in the kitchen while the men sat idly talking in the den. When dinner was ready, Sam helped Jess set the table and they all gathered to eat.
“I will, thank you, Mrs. Winchester.” Cas smiled politely, then Dean dragged him out of the kitchen to get his bags and take him upstairs. They didn’t exactly rush, but Cas could tell that Dean wasn’t wasting any time now that introductions were over.
“Well, you’re about the only thing missing from it. My holiday, that is. Christ, that’s sappy. But it’s been nice, the family is all together, we have a big meal, exchange gifts. There’s a lot of smiling and music, it’s just really warm here. Mom insists on it. She’s like -- you know the guy who stokes the fire on a train to keep it going? That’s what she’s like for our family. All of us guys would probably be lost without her. Jess does a good job helping her out, and now she’ll really be part of the family. Damn, I wish you could have been here with us.”
“We’ll be sure to throw you a pity party after this. How does that sound?”
Castiel chuckled and shook his head, “You’d have a difficult time explaining that one to the other men in your bunker.”
They hugged each other and laid in bed as the morning sun shone in through the window. Castiel pressed his face into Dean’s neck and Dean traced patterns with his fingertips along Cas’s back and shoulders. This was the most peaceful Castiel could remember feeling after sex. It was the best sex he could remember having, at that. As he rested in Dean’s arms, he didn’t care who had the control for this particular moment. Dean seemed to be about as fragile as Cas felt, and maybe the whole morning was in a state of delicateness. They were like freshly fallen snow or an undisturbed pond, the silence in a lush green forest at spring time or just before dawn on an autumn morning.
Over the next two months, Dean and Castiel continued sending letters, describing their time on base, the people they met, their lives in service. Dean tried to memorize as much of the information about Castiel’s as he could, the color of the planes and the names, Red Rippers and the
“Yeah... Me too.” Dean ran a hand through Cas’s hair, relishing the feel of soft locks one more time. Cas tipped his head into that touch and sighed. They embraced once more, one more long, last hug before finally giving in to the passage of time. “Alright... let’s go,” Dean said with a sigh.
“My parents insisted Anna and I attend church every Sunday, first mass.” Castiel shrugged. “I did so every Sunday until I was 20. Then, one morning at the Naval Academy, I just missed it. I stayed out too late the night before and slept through my alarm.”
“That’s what friends are supposed ta do, right?” Benny tilted his head to look at Dean.
“A little under eight miles, I believe. We don’t need to walk the entire length of it.”
“Fairly well, all things considered. We got new cadets in last month and while some of them aren’t too bad, they still need a lot of training.”
“So far so good. Ash is still way too smart for us, Benny was happy to be going home to see his gal.”
He looked over at Cas and saw that the man was mostly dressed now, but his tie was askew. Dean stood before him and fixed the tie, tightening the knot and straightening the front of it. “There.”
“I like her already,” Jo grinned. “So she’s younger than you?”
Castiel went limp against the bed, breathing heavily as Dean collapsed on top of him, face buried against Castiel’s neck. Neither man said anything, taking the moment to catch their breath, but Castiel refused to release Dean’s shoulder, choosing instead to keep him close. When they could finally breath evenly again, Dean placed a few kisses to Castiel’s neck, then lifted himself up a bit. He propped his head on an upturned palm and planted his elbow against the bed beside Castiel and just looked down at the other man.
“Yes, I suppose so,” Dean could hear the smile in Castiel’s voice, even without seeing it.
Just then, Mary joined them, “I thought I heard you two come in! Supper’s nearly ready.” She gave Sam and Jess each a hug and a kiss on the cheek.
“All uniforms,” Dean shook his head, chafing his hands together to warm them.
“It would be easy to get through each day when I could be the one that keeps you safe.” There was sincerity in Cas’s eyes as he said that and for a moment Dean couldn’t breath.
“Of course. About noon?”
“I got a girl, prettiest thing you ever saw,” The clerk said in a dreamy tone before his face fell and he looked back to Castiel with a silly smirk. “Too bad she thinks I’m a sleaze. So I join the Navy, gals like a man in uniform right? Sure, ‘cept I’m here and she never sees me in uniform! Never writes, neither.”
“Go right ahead. The player is right there.” She pointed to a small table with a phonograph placed on it.
“I do… I do say,” Dean will repeat and turn his head to kiss Castiel’s temple.
As it turned out, nothing out of the ordinary happened during the course of the patrol. There were battles all across the Atlantic, involving Allied and Axis ships, generally south of where the
Couples were dancing in pairs in the middle of the floor, men throwing women about in graceful tosses. Skirts twirled beneath swinging arms. Bright smiles blossomed over everyone’s expressions. The Aragon Ballroom was a place untouched by the outside world, neither the cold nor the war could reach its inhabitants. As long as it stood, grand acts would come to play there. People would come from far to hear them. Glenn Miller was up on the stage leading his brass band in an upbeat tune that made Dean nod his head.
“Is that where you’re heading now?”
“Yeah.” Cas smiled. “I did. You?”
“Because air raids on our allies aren’t reason enough,” Dean scoffed and shook his head.
“The memories will,” Cas assured him, reaching up to cup Dean’s cheek, tilting his head back up so their eyes could meet. “Just like our first kiss, as I promised then, I won’t soon forget this weekend.”
The man raised a brow at Dean, lips quirking into a half smile, “I’m a navy fighter pilot.”
Cas hid away the strip of photos and straightened his clothes; they always had to look presentable, especially as far as their mother was concerned. Growing up, the only time Cas or Anna spent with their mother was when they had to be present at social gatherings, where their mother could boast of their good manners and success in school and other extra curricular activities.
“Yeah, no one’s as conceited as you.” Gabe grinned and Inias snickered. Bal shot the younger man a dirty look and he just shrugged innocently.
“That is exactly what I mean,” Cas looked up and met Dean’s eye.
“No, Sammy, I’m going to Chicago for the weekend. I just didn’t want to hurt your feelings,” Dean said moving down the hall.
“That’s a very noble pursuit.” Cas smiled. “You might look into the American Civil Liberties Union, which fights to defend people’s rights. Initially, their main focus was on the rights of free speech, but they’ve since expanded that in the last decade or so. Now they help defend labor unions rights to meet and strike, they’ve defended Indians’ right to their lands and traditions, and they work with the NAACP for the rights of colored people. Granted, they mostly defer to the NAACP right now, but they support the Association.”
“Yes.”

“Does the someone have a name?”
“She’s doing just fine, business is good and daddy had the flu, but he’s better now. I’m sure your mom will have heard that he was sick. You know how word travels here.”
“Oh, that’s good...” Dean managed, rocking his hips.
“She seems like a real spitfire,” Dean chuckled.
Dean let it wash over him, he laid on his back with Cas above him and wrapped arms around the pilot’s waist. Somehow everything about Cas felt pure, kind and phenomenally reassuring. Dean didn’t even know where this anxiety came from, maybe the fact that everything was going so well, maybe because Cas was going very far away. Getting to Chicago, Dean could do. Hawaii? He had no idea where to even begin. This felt like it might be the last time they would be together for a long while. Who knew how long Cas would be stuck training new kids?
Dean’s eyes watched that expression change, his professional mask starting to crack under Dean’s charms. He casually responded, “Me, I’m just an infantryman, nothing special there. But I do alright for myself.”
“See ya’ ‘round, kid,” Dean joked and it made Castiel laugh.
“Evening, soldiers,” Dean raised his glass with a warm smile and a nod in greeting.
Days were long and tiring and it was good to know that Castiel didn’t mind the wait for his reply. Sometimes Dean read the ones from Cas two or three times, mostly because he rarely had the time to actually sit down and write his letters. He could have written in the mess hall where he would at least be more awake, but he preferred the privacy of his bunk at night, where the other guys were too tired to ask any prying questions. Unfortunately, he was just as tired then, too, but well over a week had passed since Dean received Castiel’s last letter on the 17th.
It was a dangerous game, but it didn’t change who they were inside. Sometimes the risk made it that much more exhilarating, especially when there was someone you liked who liked you in return. And what was a man who willingly signed up for the military if not something of a risk taker? Dean liked living on the edge and he wondered if Lieutenant Castiel Novak might as well.
“...Yeah?”

“Ready as I’ll ever be,” Dean sighed, then gestured to the door. Cas shared one last goodbye with Dean’s parents, then they left. Once outside, he gave Cas a friendly punch on the shoulder. “I think my parents like you.”
“Anything is better than nothing.” Cas nibbled on Dean’s ear and heard the man gasp softly. “Even just to sleep beside you.”
They arrived at the hall and were swept up into a whole array of events. People needed to be seated and dinner had to be served. Cas was able to sit beside Dean at dinner, which was a very nice surprise, considering he didn’t actually know anyone else besides the family. He still hadn’t even caught the Maid of Honor’s name, and at this point felt embarrassed to ask.
“Until the summertime, then,” Dean said, in echo of Castiel’s words the night before, taking a step backwards without turning away.
Dean absently nodded, “Yeah, fine.” He didn’t remember getting back to his bunk or even sitting down on the side of his bed. All he knew was that he was there, sitting with his arms on his knees, staring at the ground.
Castiel rolled his eyes but couldn’t very well deny that without looking more obvious. He had never been a particularly skilled liar.
Dean dropped his pen when he finished his letter and sat back, rubbing his hands over his face. Then, lacing his fingers together, he lifted his arms up over his head to stretch out his back. His joints popped and his muscles tensed and he groaned at the ache of it all. Sagging back against the wall, Dean glanced over the letter and shook his head. Did he really just sign it that way? It was foolish, and ridiculous, but he couldn’t scratch it out and fix it without being obvious and he was not about to write the letter over again. His eyes were going crossed as it was, not to mention almost being time for light’s out.
Day in and day out, training continued for Dean. He lived by a hard regiment, waking before dawn, running, exercising, learning about the different weapons they would be using in combat. The troops did drill after drill, following commands. In a way, it was like being on a sports team, learning plays to use against the opposition. Only in this game, the opposition had guns and wanted to kill you.
“Man, it has really been a long time, hasn’t it?” Dean laughed at himself. But the fact remained that the sight would be a welcome one. Any image of Castiel undressed was welcome in Dean’s mind, and so he let his imagination run free, picturing what kind of a body was beneath those clothes. Was he tan or pale? Lean or muscular? How strong were those arms of his? How big was his package? Dean glanced down to check himself out, smirking a little, because size wasn’t something he ever worried too much about.
“Well, they are, but in a truly, mind-numbingly boring way. With rather tasty food. This wedding had spirit, personality. Everyone was made to feel like family.”
“No problem, have fun,” The man added as they waved and headed towards the rink by his directions.
Hi guys...
Sam laughed at his brother’s expense. “Hey, you might have to change your tune, Dean. I bet we’ll all be flying around in planes to get from place to place, sooner than you think.”
None of them had an answer. Whatever the number was, it was going to be too many.
“Neither have I,” Cas admitted. “Perhaps we should... Just to mark the passing of time.”
“How on earth could you doubt that he’s serious about you?” She threw her arms up in the air, a bewildered look on her face.
Anyway, I don’t know what other details were planned after that, cause I think I was still working on that. But the endgame was that they keep sending letters as much as they can and when the war ends, they find each other and end up moving into an apartment together. They slow dance to Moonlight Serenade playing on the radio.
“One of us ought to be. So, do we call it our anniversary?”
“Don’t worry, my friend.” Bal said, reaching out to set a hand on Cas’s shoulder. “There’s plenty where that came from. In a few weeks, you’ll be wishing for dry land and a train ticket away from us.”
“Perhaps 7:30?” Sitting up, Castiel checked his watch and nodded. “Just after.”
“Lawrence, Kansas. Winchester residence.”
Castiel smiled and tilted his head down, “Yes, there is.” He looked back up to Dean one last time. “Take care of yourself, as well.”
“If the shoe fits...” Inais offered and Bal punched him in the arm. “Ouch! Gabe said it!”
They neared a row of vendors and Dean grinned, “Hey, Cas. I’ll buy you an ice cream.”
“Sometimes, but not every Sunday. My parents are a bit weird about religion, in a way they don’t really talk about. My mom seems to have respect for the church as a holy place, though I don’t know how she feels about the teachings. Dad goes as a place of penance, I think, when he knows he hasn’t been a good man.” Dean blinked, staring off and considering something. Then he scoffed a laugh and added, “Every night, though, when I was little, my mom would kiss my forehead and tell me angels were watching over me.”
Cas looked down, smiling. “Very.”
The two of them laughed at his order but went to wash their hands anyway. Dean poured drinks for everyone and made sure the last of the dishes were on the table before washing his own hands. John brought the turkey to the table and they all sat down to watch him carve it.
That worked to rouse Dean. He blinked and lifted a hand to rub at an eye, then saw Cas, clean and dressed to leave, and everything flooded back to the man. “Hey, Cas...”
Sam stood from his seat and knelt on the ground before Jess. He let go of her hands to pull a small black box from his pocket. “So now, I hope you’ll make me the luckiest man on Earth. Jessica Lee Moore, will you marry me?”
When brunch was blessedly over, the family was driven back to the house, where their father would retreat to his study and their mother would begin calling on friends or writing letters. Cas was never entirely sure what she did with her time on days like these, though he suspected Anna had a better idea of it all. Once they were no longer needed, he immediately grabbed Anna and they took refuge in her bedroom. Cas could tell she was furious.
“That definitely got the blood flowing,” Dean said, voice throaty with desire.
“Oh? Is that stamina of yours actually failing you this morning?” Dean tipped his head to try and see Castiel’s face. To abide him, Cas lifted himself up on one arm and looked at Dean.
“Alright,” Dean chuckled and patted him on the back, offered to take one of the bags, then started them walking towards his home.
“Me too?” Sam piped up.
“Not a chance,” Dean grinned at Sam, then pulled Jessica into a big hug, pressing a kiss to her cheek. She laughed, squeezing her arms around his shoulders and kissing his cheek in return.
It was a ridiculously romantic song, the whole way through, and it made Cas smile like a schoolboy. Perhaps it was just the first song Dean thought of when Cas mentioned daydreaming; perhaps it was just because his mother played it so often when he was younger. Maybe it was just the song title that was his message, that Dean hoped while Cas was daydreaming, that he dreamed of Dean. Which, of course, he did, as he was practically doing now.
“You must be very good, then,” John offered.
“Because you’re both so alike that I think it would be intimidating.”
Hearing the word, Castiel smiled before the second flash caught their picture. He didn’t want to say anything, for fear of being caught mid-word and looking strange in the photo. Dean was quick, though, timing his words just right between the flashes.
“Shucks. Thanks, Cas...” Dean prowled towards the bed and slid under the sheet, scooting over until they were face to face. Castiel shifted forward a bit and their legs intertwined. Their hands found each other and grasped together a moment before Dean brought Cas’s hand to his lips and kissed the back of it. The gesture was followed by a kiss to Cas’s forehead, his cheek and finally his lips. With closed eyes, Castiel returned the kiss and sighed when Dean pulled back. “You’re a real looker yourself, you know?”
Of course she would assume his sweetheart was a girl, and there was no need to correct her. Castiel relaxed and agreed. “Yes, it seems like a good choice.”
“Sure thing, Cas.” Dean opened his eyes and Cas blamed the look in those green hues on how tired the man must be.
“I’m sure my little sister would do the same to me,” Cas offered, patting Dean on the back. “And you would find it amusing as well.”
“We set up a cot in my room for you.” Dean explained and Cas nodded.
Ranger
“You do this to me, Dean,” he drew the soldier’s attention with that statement. Dean’s eyes confirmed the disbelief Castiel read on his face. “You have an effect on me that no other does...”
“Yeah.” Dean glanced over at Cas and smiled. “I think it is.”
Castiel saluted and shouted for the lower ranking pilots to follow him. They ran straight for the hanger. Overhead, a second wave of planes came in from the Japanese carriers, different than the bombers from the first wave attacking Ford Island. Cas spotted the distinctive landing gear that didn’t retract, as well as it’s odd shape, and held out his arms to try and stop the pilots running with him.
Soldiers, pilots, sailors and the public gathered around their radios that night to hear the special bulletin. There was to be a report of big news about the war that might have a major effect on the United States’ involvement. People murmured, wondering what the news might be or what it might mean for their futures and the futures of their loved ones. Finally the announcer spoke.
“Thanks.” Dean smiled, hauled his duffle bag up onto his shoulder and picked up the phone. After a moment, it connected to the operator.
She brought both hands up to cover her mouth as she gasped. Then she leaned forward, pressing her hands on the tabletop in her excitement. “Who? Tell me all about it!”
No, you aren't imagining it, this fic DID actually update. Believe me, I'm probably as surprised by it as you are. I know it's been 13 months since the last update and I'm so terribly sorry. Life kind of took a turn and writing got left behind, in basically all ways. I haven't written in ages; but I had a day off yesterday and so I woke up with the intention of finally finishing this chapter and by the end of the day, I had done so. I hope you all enjoy it. Feel free to curse me out in the comments, I'm sure I deserve it.
Cas chuckled and Dean glared. “Hey! Just remember, Sammy, I’m giving a speech at your wedding. I still have time to work some embarrassing stories into it if I need to.”
“Tonight and tomorrow. I leave first thing the next morning. Had to hit the Aragon while I was in town, sort of a necessity.”
A small group of people walked out of the ballroom, chatting and laughing, drawing the attention of the two service men. They watched the people, then turned back to each other, sharing strained smiles of uncertainty.
The bus pulled away and Dean watched it until it was out of sight. Then he heaved a sigh and started the lonely walk back to his house. He knew the visit couldn’t last forever, but Dean had been living in a kind of denial up until that moment. In a couple days he would be back at Ft Bragg and reality would fully set in. At least they had their letters.
“If you’re training us, you’re not being idle,” Aaron’s voice turned up a bit at the end of his sentence. Cas could tell he was trying to show him a silver lining in some way.
“He’ll be back again before we know it, sweetheart.”
“Just enjoying the view, Lieutenant. That allowed?” Dean grinned broadly.
When lips reached Castiel’s hipbones, the pilot let out a needy moan. He tightened his grip on the back of Dean’s neck, willing him to move that talented mouth to a more useful location. “Dean...”
“Yeah, see you soon, Cas.” Dean hung up the telephone and smiled to himself. Picking up his bag, he headed to his room. The first thing he wanted to do was get a bath, so he wouldn’t have train funk when Castiel arrived.
“The Allerton Hotel on Michigan Avenue. Room 205, I’ve got two keys. You can head over whenever you’re free.”
“It will.” Castiel smiled.
As always, I love all your comments! A lot of times, when I've felt so uninspired to write, your comments have pushed me forward. Even the short ones can make all the difference in the world. You guys, as my readers and supporters, are as much a reason this fic exists as I am.
Sighing, Cas tossed the pillow in his lap at Anna and stood, trudging to his bedroom to dig out the photo he had of Dean. Anna shoved the pillow aside and ran down the hall after him, giggling along the way. He began unpacking his suitcase, setting things on his bed to put away later until he got to the bundle of letters. Taking them out, he opened the first one from Dean and pulled the half strip of photos from the weekend they met. Just two pictures, one of them looking forward, then one of them smiling. He handed it over to Anna.
After gifts were exchanged, they had breakfast at the table, then went their separate ways. Their father and mother both read books in the sitting room, Anna went to her room, saying she had things she wanted to get done and that left Cas at odds with what to do and where to be. He walked through the halls of the house and found himself pausing outside of his father’s study.
Cas couldn’t help but smile and laugh a little at the last paragraph. He found himself biting the corner of his bottom lip and had to shake his head. A love-struck fool, that’s what he had become. But it seemed Dean had, as well, in his own way. It had really been a full year since their first date. That was a strange feeling for Cas. Strange, but pleasant. He set the first letter aside and opened the second, more recent one.
“Your evaluation, sir?”
“She’s being modest, she’s the best teller there,” Sam said.
“Sure,” He nodded and she found the record and put it on. After listening to it the whole way through, Cas found he agreed with her about the choice. “Yes, this is perfect.”
“Not a whole lot of options for us, there.”
The room was large and yet still crowded with people. Men and women were dressed nicely, some looked like they were still in their church clothes. It was a little more upscale and, as a result, less intimate than the first blues club they went to back in January. Castiel wove his way through the people to take a seat at a small table as close to the stage as was available. The man up on stage was just finishing his performance as they sat and a man walked up to the large microphone.
“Greater than death?” She quirked a brow at him, lips pursed to the side.
“I don’t know if she’d call herself one, but I’m pretty sure she has the same ideals.”
“You’re also several inches shorter,” Cas quipped back. The cockpit was on the smaller side and made the plane less comfortable than others he had been in. But being as tall as he was, Cas was generally used to feeling cramped in aircraft. The coms went quiet then, since they weren’t really supposed to be using them to chatter. On the runway, a catapult helped launch one of the new planes. Though there was usually enough space to get up to speed for takeoff, catapults made the process a lot easier.
, rather than the
“Fine, fine,” Ash joined the conversation. “If you want to be a whiner about it.”
Christmas Eve meant a big dinner in the Winchester household. It worked out nicely that Jess’s family had their dinner on Christmas Day, so she and Sam could be at both every year without choosing between them. Thanksgiving, however, was a trade off event. Mary was the one who insisted on the big dinner. Her own family hadn’t done a lot of celebrating while she grew up and she always wanted her boys to have a different, happier life. She chose Christmas Eve to be the dinner night though because she insisted that Christmas Day was for relaxing and refused to cook at all.
“Just wondering how you look after great sex,” Dean said, grinning.
Suffice it to say, the vacation to Lawrence was sounding very good right now. In port, Cas made a formal request for leave time for the duration of the wedding and travel time to Lawrence and back. Within two days, his request was approved, and he was given his next assignment: training. This time, however, he would not be training in Chicago. Instead, they were sending him to a naval base in Hawaii, just north of Honolulu. Cas had a vague understanding of the territory that was Hawaii. It was a series of islands in the South Pacific, pretty far off the coast of Mexico. There had been some sort of coup and overthrow of the royal family nearly twenty years ago and it changed from a Kingdom to a Republic, before the United States annexed it. The territory also had some strategic significance during the Great War. That, and the fact that Hawaii had a fairly pleasant, tropical climate was about all Cas knew.
“Just for a little while. Let’s go back up, make ourselves useful.”
Dean tipped his head and really had to think about that for a minute. There were any number of reasons why he was an ass, but when did he tell Cas that?
As soon as they were through the door, Dean had hooked an arm around Cas’s shoulders, pulling him in close for a desperate kind of kiss. The fact that they hadn’t done more than kiss the night before was something of a small miracle, which Dean blamed on the fact that Cas was tired from a long day of traveling. Now, though, they were both wide awake. They kissed hard and desperate as Dean led them both over to the bed. Cas pushed Dean’s suspenders off his shoulders and began unfastening his pants. Dean made short work of Cas’s shirt, only breaking the kiss to pull it from over his head.
“You seem... happier than usual lately.” Anna studied Cas, face serious. “Not that you aren’t usually happy around me, but there’s something else.”
Benny patted him on the shoulder once he got there, then abandoned him with the girl. Dean gave a half hearted chuckle-smile combination that just reeked of awkwardness. The girl must have seen he wasn’t sure what to do and took pity on him.
“As I told you.”
“Yeah, I took a lot of baths when I was home this past week. Sammy made fun of me, said I spent longer in the bathroom than Jess,” Dean laughed.
“Night, Mom.” Dean moved to kiss his mother.
Finally, Cas pulled back and looked down at Dean. His warm blue eyes were too much, and Dean had to look down, focusing instead on Cas’s jaw. He felt a hand touch his cheek, fingertips brushed his lips. He kissed those fingers, then managed a smile at himself for such a gesture.
"Better than sleeping alone tonight." He kissed Castiel's neck.
“Because of how you were smiling.”
, had sailed in to pick up the survivors when the U-boat prepared to attack again. The
“Are you boys heading out?” She set her pen down and pushed the pad of paper aside. John folded down his newspaper.
“I’ll bet you would,” Cas chuckled.
“Just got in last night, I get to stay until after the new year, then I go back to North Carolina.”
“I’m afraid I can’t help it.”
“Surprise? That sounds more like an ambush.”
Castiel sat up, propping himself up on palms pressed into the bed, “Oh, if you prefer to do it sitting in my lap, I can manage that." He spared one arm to wind around Dean’s waist, then shifted his hips, shaft rubbing suggestively against Dean’s ass.
In the meantime, the band struck up the new tune and Dean let his mind clear as he danced Tessa around the floor. She was pretty good. While he wasn’t the best dancer, he wasn’t half bad, either. He was a strong lead and didn’t step on her feet, which was probably enough. Tessa smiled like she was having a good time and before he knew it, Dean was smiling as well. He had always been a fan of good music and dancing was fun when there were no pretenses about it. When the song ended and a new one began, they carried on dancing right through it.
“Cas, okay.” Dean groaned again, righting himself on his elbows once more. He didn’t look at Sam, just out across the lawn. “His name is Cas.”
“You’re better.” Dean kissed Cas’s lips briefly.
“Can’t be too good a code, though, or else they’ll think we’re spies,” Dean chuckled. “We’ve done pretty well so far, though, I think.”
Ship: CV-4,
“That was thoughtful...” Dean said, though he assumed it meant that Sam wanted some alone time with Jess. Or, just possibly, last minute Christmas shopping. It was the last weekend before Christmas and the shops were all sure to be crowded with procrastinators. Dean realized he might need to be one of them.
“Good evening, ya’ll. I’m gonna go ahead and play some music for you. This here is Honey Bee Blues.” Sonny Boy started the song off with the harmonica, playing a traditional blues melody. Dean glanced around at the other people in the club, some closing their eyes and shaking their heads in beat with the music, wearing little smiles on their lips.
When they pulled back from the kiss, breathless and desperate, Cas’s eyes met Dean’s and they never looked more earnest and deep. It was then, right then, that Cas knew this was love. This was more than just lust or simple attraction. This wasn’t just a schoolboy crush. He loved Dean. And he never felt it more than looking into the man’s eyes now. Rather than say the words, though, which held such weight, he instead touched his fingers to Dean’s face, tracing his fine features, and smiled.
“They don’t want the good pilots out fighting?” John raised a brow at that.
“Cas!” Dean replied, then laughed. “Damn, man, merry Christmas!”
“Hi there, sir. Something I can help you with?”
Sam’s letters were usually his favorite. Dean always liked knowing that his brother was alright, studying hard and making something of himself. Seeing himself as the less brainy of the two, Dean expected his life to be what it was: a soldier serving his country, keeping the people at home safe. He expected more from Sam and was always thankful that in the event of a draft, college would spare him the horrors of war, something Dean hoped his little brother never had to experience.
“Jess has proven herself to be a good general. She is taking care of everything, giving orders and getting things done. Sam is nervous but he’s trying to keep it hidden. They’re both happy, though. Real happy.”
“Goodnight, Gabe.”
“I’m certain.” They shared knowing glances as a waiter came to refill their coffee mugs. After deciding to keep the conversation to safer topics in public, they finished their lunches, then took to the streets for another leisurely walk.
Songs referenced in this chapter:
“Yes, you are.”
“Because you were probably thinking about me.” Dean shrugged as if it were obvious.
They laid there for ten minutes before finally deciding it was necessary to get themselves cleaned up. They took turns bathing and then got dressed. Dean changed the sheets on the bed, then they made their way downstairs to eat some lunch, listen to music and await the return of the others. Their days together, leading up to the wedding would be spent in much the same way. They made the most of what time they had alone in the house and the rest of the time was spent visiting with family or activities surrounding the wedding. They did occasionally go into town, but there wasn’t much to do except visit shops. Neither man was particularly interested in shopping, with the one exception of buying records.
Castiel didn’t want to be so tired, especially because he didn’t want to miss out on time with Dean, but they hadn’t gotten much sleep the previous night and it had been a long and active day. He took comfort in the fact that Dean seemed more amused than agitated and let the other man help him into bed. Cas shucked off his own pants, but Dean must have taken them away, because they miraculously vanished and were replaced by the bedsheet. He kept his eyes open just long enough to watch Dean undress.
Lt Castiel Novak
Their money came partially from inheritance; both Castiel’s mother and father were from wealthy families. In addition to money, they inherited businesses. His parents’ marriage was arranged as a business deal and left little love between them. Though they got along well enough, no shouting matches or physical fighting, Cas would never have described his parents as being “in love” with each other.
Cas groaned out Dean’s name, arching his back. His face was awash with pleasure, jaw slack, eyes closed. Occasional hums and moans accompanied gasps and the whispered ‘fuck’ now and then. He was especially vocal when Dean circled his hips as he lowered himself down again. Dean watched Cas for a good while before getting lost in the pleasure, himself. Cas’s breathing quickened and his grip got tighter on Dean’s hips.
“Care to let me in on the joke?” Dean was grinning now, Cas was certain of it.
“I think I could approve that.” Castiel smiled to himself and tried not to pay attention to the way Dean’s eyes followed him as he retrieved his tie and put it back on. Finally, the infantryman got out of bed and fixed his own clothes. It was a bit of a shame to see those sleeves cover his forearms, when Castiel much preferred to see them bare. He glanced away and out the window. “At least it’s starting to cool off.”
“Ohh...” Cas lifted a hand to scratch the back of his head, then glanced around nervously. “She isn’t here, is she? She doesn’t know who I am, does she?”
“Didn’t you just go to Chicago? Isn’t that kind of out of the way?” Sam followed after him, tugging Dean to a stop at the top of the stairs.
“What are you looking for?”
“You were smiling real bright, seemed you really liked it.”
“Well, I propose a toast,” Dean said, lifting his glass. “To Sam and Jessica, you’ve always made each other happy and you’ll only be happier still as husband and wife.”
“I’ll bet, more than you needed to know, probably. Hold on one second, Dean’s right here.”
“You know I think you’re onto somethin’ there, Harvelle.”
“Alright, mom,” Dean said with a laugh.
“What’s funny?” He asked.
“Alright. January 17th we met. But I didn’t kiss you until the 18th.” Dean grinned at the memory of it.
“Cas!” Dean’s voice was barely audible at first, so he cleared his throat and started again. “Cas, hey... It’s Dean. I just got to the hotel and checked in.”
Dean laughed, “I jog further than this as morning training. You sure you’ll be alright, flyboy?”
“Alright, brother.” Benny conceded, as well. They all fell silent for a moment to listen and sip their drinks, then Benny spoke up again. “My Andrea and I could really cut a rug.”
“One wouldn’t want to get sand in his shoes,” Cas shot Dean a smirk.
“So being with me makes you think of signing your life away to the US Navy?” Dean chuckled.
“Yes, our father taught us both how.”
“When I went to the Naval Academy I was no longer living at home.”
He wound his arms a little tighter around Cas’s waist, kissed him back a little harder. When the kiss broke, Dean’s eyes were still closed and he buried his face in the other man’s neck, feeling like a helpless child. He couldn’t shake the feeling and didn’t want to deal with it. He just wanted to keep holding onto Cas, like that would somehow work.
And Dean will say, “Who’d you hear at thing like that from?”
“Castiel, then...” Dean said, unable to look away from that blue stare until Castiel broke away first, watching the sparsely populated street they walked along.
“It’s fine,” Sam rolled his eyes. “Who’s your friend?”
“There’s no one at school you’re interested in?” Cas tipped his head.
“There’s this song Fred Astaire sings, ‘They Can’t Take That Away From Me’, and I keep thinking about it lately.”
“Okay,” Dean grinned and pushed the button, sitting back before the first flash of the camera caught them both staring ahead. Dean laughed, “Smile.”
Thank you to everyone who gave me support with this fic.
“I took leave for today, I’ll be on the next train down.”
It wasn’t like Balthazar to go AWOL and he was a charismatic guy, so he had lots of friends in the squad. Multiple pilots were worried about him and by now everyone was tense. With flight checks finished, Cas waited for the signal to taxi his plane to the catapult for launch. Suddenly, the LSO was signalling wildly. People were shouting on the flight deck and Cas popped open his cockpit hatch to better see and hear what was going on. A quick glance skyward revealed a familiar plane circling and awaiting landing signals.
Cas found Balthazar in the wardroom when he got there, Gabe and Inias showed up a little later. The room was large and had a few tables with comfortable chairs set around them, where the officers could have meetings or meals. There were also newspaper and magazine stands with more chairs located beside them. The wardroom was both a lounge and a place for meals and restricted to officers only.
Dean laughed in a gentle sort of way. “Yeah, I don’t think a ship can be considered home, unless you owned it or something.”
“My hair isn’t long enough to be put up, Dean.”
“Nope, mine are jammed, too.” The two of them circled around and headed back towards the carrier so they could look into what the problem was. Meanwhile, Bal and Inias tried theirs. Both of their guns fired successfully on several attempts. The two of them stayed in the air, along with a few others, while Gabe, Cas, and anyone else with jamming guns awaited their turn to land.
“So, Dean,” John started, folding his newspaper and setting it aside. “How’s training?”
“Oh god,” Dean said suddenly, drawn out of his thoughts when Cas’s hand wrapped around his bare, hard cock. He had pulled the boxers aside and gone for more. “Cas...”
Cas’s laugh came across the line and made Dean smile. “Yes, a way in which my sister and I will probably both disappoint our parents, at this rate.”
“I certainly mean more when I sign my letters ‘yours’ or ‘your friend’,” Cas admitted, tipping his head down.
“Yeah, that’d be good. I mean, mine’s kinda boring, about all I have to talk about are guns and some screwball friends. But I’d like to hear how things are going around here.”
There was a brief pause and Dean squeezed Castiel’s hand. “You really are. Thought so the moment I saw you.”
“I’m not going to explain it.” Castiel looked towards the street. If last night he thought himself silly for thinking of Dean as his lover, the cheesy thoughts he’d had this morning were much worse.
Sam leaned in as he listened to all Cas had to say, “Oh yeah? That sounds right up my alley. Thanks, Cas. I’ll definitely look into that.”
“You know Billboard, the magazine, they have a whole list of the best selling songs now! They just started it last month.” She pointed to the magazine she had been flipping through. Sure enough there was a chart of the best songs from just last week. Cas glanced through the list and stopped on one.
However, it had been less than twenty four hours since he went missing and so they wouldn’t start a search party until later that day. So the three of them bided their time, absently playing cards or trying to keep their minds occupied as the clock on the wardroom wall ticked away. After twenty two hours, Cas gave in and went to the flight deck, intending to start preflight checks and let the officers on deck know he was getting ready to take off and search for Bal. Inias and Gabe took no convincing and followed him up, along with a few other men from their squadron that were friends with Bal.
“Not at all,” Benny shook his head and stood. Some weekends, they were allowed to go to town with permission from their commanding officer, and tonight was one of those nights. The celebration wasn’t anything particularly special, just a local club which provided music, dancing and drinks.
“Are you blackmailing me, sister?”
“How long are you in Chicago?”
The Winchester household was a pleasant place to be during the festive times of year. Full of food and laughter and love. Any time John attempted to talk of war, Mary would chide him and the house would be safe from fears of what was to come in the future. None of the Winchesters, nor the Novaks, knew any of the details of the attempted talks America was having with Japan. The Japanese ambassador to America was delivering proposals to the government, regarding removal of Japanese troops in parts of Asia in exchange for supplies of oil and other materials. The families didn’t know that American intelligence departments had received intel that Japan had no intention of removing their troops from Indochina and was planning to invade Thailand.
Castiel rolled his eyes, “Yes, of course it is.”
Sam set the phone down and went back to the living room, “Dean, call for you. One of your friends.”
On the way back down to the room, Dean was feeling a healthy buzz from his drink, just enough to make him smile a little more easily and sling his arm around Castiel’s shoulders without worrying who they met along the way. The halls of the hotel weren’t particularly crowded, though, and no one was there to see them make the trek from the elevator to their door. Castiel’s fingers were deft as he fished the key from his pocket and let them into the room, with Dean hovering close behind him.
“And how do you propose I arrange that?”
“Yep. Yeah, Dean, that’s me. Uhm...” He gestured back over his shoulder towards Benny. “I’m sorry about him-- this-- that...”
“I could do with a painting of it, something I could hang on my wall, look at any time.”
After an hour of inspections, someone shouted, “Hey! Look at this.” Cas, Gabe and others gathered around as the man, one of the ammunition experts, pulled out an ammo case. He pointed to the belts inside it. “They’re out of alignment. The belts must have shifted around while you were flying.”
Dean smiled the whole while he read Cas’s letter. Everything from imagining Cas and Anna tipsy on New Year’s Eve, to gloating about nice weather and the secret little “H. A.” message, which certainly stood for “Happy Anniversary.” The 18th of January marked one year from their first date and first kiss. A whole year had passed, which was pretty remarkable for Dean. Both of them had confessed to never having a relationship that lasted this long. Dean was glad that, of anyone, Cas was the person with whom he had reached that milestone. Laughing at himself for such sappy thoughts, he read on and laughed aloud at Cas’s final note about parachutes and swimming. He could just imagine the other man’s dry tone and wry smile as he delivered those lines. It would have been hilarious.
“Me too, Dean,” Cas whispered back, a warm smile on his lips. Then they kissed again, a simultaneous decision, saving both of them from finding any more words. It was a soft, gentle kind of kiss that mirrored the words neither of them could say.
“Look, flying is all well and good, so long as I don’t have to be the guy in the air.” Dean shook his head.
Dean dropped his arm from around Castiel and they both straightened up, stepping apart. The grass around the path they walked turned to sand and just before the beach, Castiel pulled Dean to a stop. “I hope you don’t mind sand...”
“Uhm... What would you like for Christmas, Mom?” He grinned at her sheepishly.
“Yeah,” Dean chuckled and kissed Cas’s cheek again. “I know you can’t help looking good.”
“Are you doing alright?” Cas turned to look at Aaron, who was a good student, one of the young men to invite him out to celebrate Halloween.
“Ohhhh,” Ash said, a smile spreading across his lips. “You’re giving little brother sex advice, huh?”
A moment of silence that was probably barely more than two seconds felt like an eternity to Dean. Then Cas spoke, “Of course.”
“Yeah...” Dean stood as well and together they left the pier. They followed the paved walkway that stretched on ahead as far as Dean could see. “How long is the trail? Do you know?”
“We should write,” Dean blurted out.
“It really did.” Dean nodded. “They’re gonna be great together.”
He took a bite of one of the truffles and his eyes went wide. “Those are fantastic!”
When he arrived at his bunk, he unpacked his belongings in the coffin - the name for a locker on a ship -- assigned to him. His bed amounted to a thin mattress and flat pillow on a slab of metal mounted to the wall. There wasn’t much space between his bunk and the ceiling. Gabe didn’t get any more space between his bunk and the bottom of Cas’s. Living was cramped and Gabe was actually lucky to be so short in a place like this. There wasn’t too much to be done at the moment, everyone was getting settled in and the new recruits on the ship were learning their jobs. Tonight, Cas and the others would most likely begin doing official checks of their new planes, eat dinner and receive their schedules for the next day.
“Oh yeah? That’s nice of you.”
“Well, don’t die of boredom, either.” Dean looked at Cas finally, wearing a lopsided grin, back to his usual charismatic self.
“I would happily attend that service every Sunday,” Dean grinned.
“Me either.” Cas gestured, “Sit.”
“And here I thought the first was the photobooth,” Castiel grinned, glancing away.
"A very astute observation," Novak retorted dryly, looking off to the dance floor. The way his lip quirked at the edge made Dean think he was still amused.
“I’m not blushing,” Cas frowned deeply.
Rubbing his hands against his slacks, Dean cleared his throat and moved to answer the door. There was Castiel, standing in the hall and smiling. He had a garment bag in hand and wore a suit similar to Dean’s, except his jacket was on, despite the heat.
“Sweet dreams, Cas.”
The glare that Castiel shot his way made Dean laugh harder. He lifted a hand to pat Cas’s back, then left it on his shoulder. There was no one near enough to see them and if there had been, at least they weren’t in uniform.
“Sounds like Mother or Father is home.” Anna said and pointed to the photograph of Dean, “Best put that away.”
A shipment of mail arrived on the Ranger and all the men were thrilled to get some of their first letters after nearly a month at sea. They missed their loved ones and some men sent out dozens of letters each on this first shipment out. The censors were surely busy going cross-eyed reading all of them. Cas had only sent a few out, mostly just to Anna, because he hadn’t yet gotten a reply from Dean. He was looking forward to this delivery, perhaps a little more so than he would like to admit.
“Yes, pie for everyone,” Mary laughed, taking Dean’s plate away and dishing out pie for her boys. They spent the rest of the evening chatting about things that were going on around town. Mary talked about the girls who would ask after him that she ran into around town. Sam updated him on any of their mutual friends that he kept up with. John kept quiet, meanwhile, returning to his paper. At the end of the night, Dean went to his room, glad of the comfort of his more familiar bed and the peace of a room to himself. Barely ten minutes had passed since he laid down before Dean was fast asleep.
Cas smiled, “Hello.”
“I do,” Cas admitted. “I enjoy jazz and swing and big band, of course. It’s just about everywhere. Blues feels more substantial though. A man or woman singing the blues bares their souls to the audience in a way swing does not.”
It wouldn’t take much effort for them both to be hard, but the slow and steady method felt amazing to Dean. They both had their eyes closed, following the rhythm of their bodies’ movements, mouths open and panting softly. Everything about Cas felt good, not just because he was an incredibly hot man, but because he was Cas. It would be easy to have a purely physical relationship with a man this good looking, but his personality, his mind and everything he did made Dean want more. He had never wanted more than the physical stuff with anyone the way he wanted it with Cas.
Castiel pulled his sleeve back to check his watch, “Maybe twenty minutes.”
Sam laughed as well, holding up his hands in surrender. “Alright, alright. I’ll just tell him when you’re not around and swear him to secrecy.”
“I am! My feet ache in these shoes. I miss my combat boots.”
“I’m not all jokes all the time.” Dean smirked back at his brother, then John interrupted their banter.
Castiel blinked and looked up at Dean with furrowed brows. “Plumb what?”
“I’m sure Benny and Ash would be quite upset to know you think them ugly.” Cas frowned.
“See, I gotcha,” Dean said as Castiel straightened, finding his balance. “Want to go out onto the rink?”
“You never know, Dean. Things like that do happen,” Cas turned to look at him, earnestness in his expression.
“How’s about I ask her for ya’.” Benny grinned and before Dean had a chance to stop him, he sauntered off towards the girl. Dean watched in aggravation as Benny used his Southern charm and smooth drawl to talk her into dancing. He saw Benny smiling and gesturing in Dean’s direction and when the girl smiled as well, he knew he had no hope of getting out of this. Benny waved him over and Ash pushed him the first few steps. Dean quickly downed his whiskey and left the glass on the bartop, trying to think of an excuse not to dance before he reached the girl. Sadly, his normally crafty mind had failed him.
“You had us worried!” Inias chided. He had been the gloomiest of them all, because it was his job to be Bal’s wingman. Losing him reflected poorly on Inias, but also left him feeling overwhelming guilt for letting Bal down.
“Yes?”
“Sure thing, Garth!” One of them replied before picking up the needle and flipping the record over back to the A side.
“I think we might...” He went off into a back room and returned a minute later, flipping through the pages. When he found the list, he set it down in front of Dean. “Here it is.”
and we were having difficulties sending letters, because the timing was off,” Cas prompted. “Sometime in early Spring, I think.”
. They brought us home for the holidays and now I’m training new pilots up at Great Lakes. And you?”
Tessa laughed again and shook her head. She reached out and set a hand on his shoulder. “If you’ve got a sweetheart somewhere that those boys just don’t know about, I understand. You don’t have to explain to them, or to me, but in my experience? They’re not likely to give up on making you dance with someone unless they get an excuse. So. Dance with me and avoid explaining things to them. Everyone wins.”
Benny laughed around a crooked grin. “Looked like ya’ll were havin’ some fun out there.”
“And you’re with the infantry?” Novak looked back to Dean.
“21st,” Castiel supplied, a wry smile on his lips.
Castiel responded by grabbing a spare pillow and hitting Dean in the face with it. They both laughed and rolled around in the sheets for a moment before Dean ended up wrapped in Cas’s arms and they settled once again. They dozed in bed until early afternoon, when Dean’s stomach began growling in protest of their laziness. Cas was the first one to move, dragging Dean out of bed by his hand and into the bathroom where they took turns washing up in the tub and shaving at the sink.
May 31st. Cas read the date again and committed it to memory. He would do what he could to find a way to get to Kansas for that wedding. The only problem was, he didn’t know where he would be when this tour ended in March, let alone where he would be come May. But if there was a way, Cas would find it. If he couldn’t get leave during the wedding, he would find another time, even if it was just to have a quick weekend in North Carolina.
He laughed again. “Not as such. Lunch sounds nice though. Will it just be you?”
He saw that air about the man once again as Dean came walking up the street with a bounce in his step. Even from a distance, Castiel could see the broad smile on the infantryman’s face and it drew a larger smile from the pilot.
“Not yet.”

“You better, I know too many of your secrets.”
“What?”
“You aren’t happy being Ginger Rogers?” Cas couldn’t keep the laughter at bay as he spoke. Dean gave him a deadpan stare. “Alright, how about Gene Kelly? Or Humphrey Bogart?” Cas grinned as he came up with the last one, clearly pleased with himself.
Dean sipped his whiskey and sighed. “Thanks for bringing me out tonight, boys.”
The ride was made a little more uncomfortable because of the driver, so Dean and Cas stayed quiet the entire ride there. They were also certain to avoid touching each other any more than necessary. Upon arrival, they paid the driver’s fair excluding any form of tip and got out. As he pulled away, Dean leaned in and muttered to Castiel what he thought of the driver.
was struck by a torpedo. The ship sank, killing 100 of the sailors aboard, only 44 enlisted men survived. The news was released on the base early that morning and no one really felt much like celebrating.
As the approached the stop where Cas was meant to get off the bus, he spotted a man standing on the street corner, waiting. It was Dean. A smile spread over Cas’s face and he quickly stood, grabbing his bags and making his way off the bus. The first thing he noticed when he was close enough to see Dean properly, was the man’s bright smile. It was possible that Dean was more handsome in person than Cas had recalled.
Tilting his head curiously, Castiel gave Dean a wary look, “What should we do?”
“What, Sammy, no! It’s training, of course not.” Dean rolled his eyes and went into the hall bathroom to wash his hands and face.
“Where is his squad heading?”
Dean glanced at Castiel’s tongue, then back up to his blue eyes, mischief dancing in his own, “Oh, it’s my pleasure.”
“Oh yeah,” Dean nodded and moved Castiel backwards until his knees hit the foot of the bed, forcing him to sit. He would then find his lap full of Dean, who straddled him and began kissing along his shoulder and collarbone. Dean could feel Castiel was getting hard, which only served to make him want the man more. He kissed every inch he could reach and Castiel worked to get Dean’s shirt off, breaking the stream of kisses and leaving them both bare chested.
“Not really, sir. Not yet. For the most part, I’ve just been on neutrality patrols. I suspect I won’t see any action unless we actively join the war. Or someone attacks Allied ships near wherever I’m patrolling,” Cas shrugged. “And our planes -- I’m a fighter pilot -- we only fight other planes. The attack pilots would fire at enemy ships.”
“Just remember to tell him to be careful. Don’t want any surprise tricycles.” Ash said as he laid back on his bed and Benny started chuckling.
Castiel’s breath was short and staggered, all of Dean’s kisses caused little gasps. He kept his eyes on the young man’s face and the tender expression he wore. With the boxers gone, Dean pressed one last kiss, right against the side of his hard cock, then brought himself back up to his lips. Dean cupped a hand to his cheek and Cas tipped his head into that touch. They shared another slow kiss as Dean lowered his body to press against Castiel’s and both hummed their contented pleasure. Hips worked in small circles, rubbing their bare shafts together in a half-gentle way. They weren’t dry humping like horny teenagers or rutting up against each other in a side street alley. They were taking their time.
“Alright, since I can’t change my plans and you can’t change the military, how about we just eat cake?” Cas suggested, to skirt around the conversation. He agreed that she should be able to serve, despite his fear of his little sister in danger, but they had the conversation plenty of times already.
“Does that mean I get the cookies all to myself?”
They walked into the rink, already full of people, young and old, skating around with bright smiles on their faces. Men wore summer suits and women had on colorful dresses. Music rang through the large pipe Wurlitzer above the rink, played by a woman on an organ in a booth off to the side.
The line that stood out most to Dean was, “When you're in my arms and I feel you so close to me, all my wildest dreams came true.”
“Finally?” She looked over at Dean as she took her hand back. “You been talkin’ about me?”
“It was while I was on the
“Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Dean Winchester,” Dean added. “We should probably get you to the train station.”
“Okay, alright.”
While November started with great tension after the attack on the
“You love me and you know it.” Gabe rolled his eyes and then turned to look at the planes. He took a deep breath and sighed. “Can’t wait to get up in these babies...”
They made plans for the summer and began counting down the days until they could meet again. It seemed as though time was crawling by, but when either stopped and looked back at how much time had passed, at the same time it seemed as if it had gone by in a flash. By the time final arrangements were being made for the visit, Dean felt as though he were meeting with an old friend he had known as long as any of the guys from home. He felt an air of excitement as he penned one more letter to Castiel and the reality of seeing the man again finally set in. This was really about to happen, all because of a conversation in a ballroom to the tune of Glenn Miller and a kiss in a photo booth to the silence of the falling snow.
“Is there anything else I can help you with? Maybe picking a song to send back?” She smiled brightly at him and Cas realized that she was right.
“I think we’re going to have them now,” Dean explained, stepping back to the counter. He paid for the candies, thanked the girl and they left, wishing each other a good day. Dean pressed the box of truffles into Castiel’s hand and opened his own box, trying another mint candy. “These really are good.”
“For me? Ah, probably Jo. I was supposed to get lunch with her.” Dean got up and walked to where the telephone was. Sam smiled at him as he went past.
“Wow. It must be huge.”
Dean folded the letter up and tucked it back into the envelope and smiled. Baby brother, all grown up. “Miss you, too, Sammy...” He whispered quietly, then put it with all the other letters from Sam.
“Oh, dirty words.” Dean teased.
And when they see each other again, finally, they’re going to be fucking dying with the absolute NEED to touch each other.
“It was. As all the others after it have been, as well.”
Grabbing a scrap of paper, Dean quickly jotted down the information about Billboard Magazine, then put away the letter from Cas. He wanted to go find this list of songs and see which one Cas wanted him to listen to, but it was too close to lights out to go now. Ash and Benny had just walked in the door and were heading over to their bunks.
What happened next was slower than Cas had expected. Dean lifted a hand to cup his cheek, and Cas tipped his head toward it. His eyes traveled over Cas’s face as Cas’s gaze fell on Dean’s lips. They leaned into each other and kissed. Nearly a year apart and they were finally together again. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean, pulling the other man in close, reveling in the way their bodies fit against each other. Neither of them wanted to pull away. Dean’s hand made its way up into Cas’s hair, fingers threading through dark locks. Cas sighed into the kiss and relaxed.
The young lady came out from behind the counter and walked him over to a section of the store where an “N” was written by the boxes of records. “Nelson, Nelson... Here we are. These are all the records with have by him.”
"Dean..." Castiel closed his eyes as well, sighing out the name.
Castiel touched the word “yours” with his fingertips, as if doing so would uncover some hidden, extra writing, negating the word. Surely Dean hadn’t meant to sign the letter in such a bold way. He was deliriously tired when he wrote it, it said so right above his signature. They were being careful with their words in the letters; Dean invited him to stay in his hotel, but under the guise of not having to catch the last train. The thought of sharing a hotel room with the infantryman still brought a smile to Castiel’s lips. While he wasn’t the sort to be giddy, per se, the memory of a heated kiss in a photobooth still remained clear to Castiel and brought to mind the possibility of more.
Just because Dean still cared for Cas, though, didn’t mean that the feelings remained mutual, and if Dean didn’t do anything to maintain those feelings -- like sending letters in reply to the ones he received -- then there was no guarantee that he would keep the man. It was Thursday now, and Dean resolved to write to Cas on Friday, after training. No more delaying. With that on his mind, he stopped by the fort’s mailroom on his way back to the barracks. Sure enough, there was mail for him from the
When Castiel looked up, Dean was already watching him. He flashed a smile at Cas, who smiled back with a roll of his eyes, “Watching me dress?”
Castiel narrowed his eyes at Dean and raised a brow.
“I think Winchester has someone he’s sweet on.” Ash elbowed Benny in the side. “What do you say?”
“Oh, Dean, only my mother calls me that, and only when I’m in trouble, I don’t need to hear it from you.”
Sam looked touched by the toast and smiled up at him, “Thanks, Dean. That was really nice.”
“What?” Anna turned to him, confused.
“Well, I’ve got some leftovers. Let me warm them up for you and you go get washed up.”
“Everyone deals with these emotions differently. Some people move past grief quickly and immediately turn to anger. The need for vengeance, or the desire to stop the enemy before they kill any more of our friends.”
“Like what you see?” Dean asked, grinning.
“Don’t I ever, Cassy. But it was worth it.”
“Castiel Novak, but everyone just calls me Cas.” He leaned in and shook her hand. “It’s a pleasure to finally meet you.”
“Damn, you’re right. Just a few weeks, huh?”
“Maybe I’ll learn to control my temper.”
When he finished chewing, Dean took a drink of water and cleared his throat, “So what are the plans for the rest of the night?”
The air was cool and crisp, the sun was bright up in the blue sky, it was a perfect winter day. No snow had fallen just yet, but the town was decorated for Christmas. Wreaths covered doors, a few people had garland hung around the door frames. Large red bows could be seen decorating mailboxes. As he got into the part of town with all the shops, Dean saw garland stretched across the road and wires with big, decorative bells hanging from them. Inside shops, radios were turned on to play Christmas music, by the likes of Bing Crosby, Benny Goodman and Ozzie Nelson.
“A tiger, more like,” He said, tugging at a lock of her hair and she batted his hand away. They arrived at Emmanuel’s and dropped the conversation as they were seated at a table and placed their orders.
Gabe fired a few rounds off before stopping. Then his voice came through the radios once more.
“Don’t worry, Cas, I’ll keep you in shape this weekend.”
Cas started laughing, “I suppose it does.”
I haven’t worked out the details yet.
“God, you’re amazing,” Dean praised, filling Cas once again.
On the other end of the line, Dean smiled bashfully and scratched the back of his head. He wasn’t used to these things, but he had to admit it felt good. “Yeah, yours too. How’s Christmas going? Is it nice to be home?”
“Cas...” Dean shrugged, perhaps trying to downplay the statement.
“Is she a feminist, too?” Dean could hear the smile in Cas’s voice.
“Thank you,” Cas said, gesturing with his cone before taking a lick of it.
She made her way down the aisle, where her father then kissed her cheek and passed her hand over to Sam, who took it in both of his own. Forgetting himself for a moment, Sam lifted her hand to his lips and pressed a kiss to the backs of her fingers. Jess giggled and many in the wedding guests sighed an aww. The ceremony was lovely, albeit brief, as compared to the more extravagant ones Cas has been to in the past. The priest spoke of the meaning of marriage and the importance of the union, he read a passage from the Bible and told a few personal details about both Sam and Jess.
“It was nice having you home for a bit, though,” Sam chimed.
“Yes, of course, but it’s been years...” Castiel shook his head.
“Okay, Cas. If you insist.”
“We could.”
Dean shivered involuntarily.
They all did as Cas said; he and Gabe, along with several others, pushed the plane over to one of the elevators to the hangar, so damage could be checked and repairs made.
“I was,” John nodded. “Corporal, Second Battalion, First Marines.”
“I don’t know. I don’t think proposals count when the proposition is illegal.”
“Take note for next time.” Cas reached up a hand to cup Dean’s cheek, leaned in and kissed him, then climbed out of bed. He fixed the buttons on his shirt and tucked it back in, pulling his suspenders back on. “Dinner?”
“Sure thing, I’ll even get you raisinets.” Dean flashed him a smile, but Castiel shook his head. “No?”
Dean tried to show Cas the way he felt, he thought maybe Cas caught on, but it was possible he was just seeing what he wanted to see. Castiel was a very internal man and though Dean thought he was good at reading the subtleties in the other man, he could just as easily be wrong. While Dean showed a boastful exterior, inside he was uncertain of his place with Castiel.
“True, that was much more like a date.” Cas hummed thoughtfully and Dean could just imagine him looking thoughtful, with his eyebrows drawn down and eyes squinting slightly.
Dean looked down into his cereal bowl and shrugged. He could lie to his dad about his love life, but lying to his mother had always been harder. So he skirted around the whole story with little bits of truth, instead. “Not really interested in any of them. Besides they’re mostly real young.”
“I couldn’t do it,” Dean shook his head.
Rather than answer, Castiel gave Dean a shove at the shoulder and walked on when the other man stumbled to the side. Dean let out a teasing laugh and righted himself, keeping up with Castiel with no trouble at all.
“And a rather pretty face.”
“Are you kidding? I wouldn’t miss this for the world.” He kissed the top of Castiel’s head, then ushered him towards the bed. “Let’s get you settled.”
The hug surprised him, in a pleasant way, and he returned it, laughing at her latter compliment. “Thank you.”
And Cas will smile and say, “I thought you didn’t dance…”
Another moment passed, then Cas heard Gabe laughing at the unexpected joke. They didn’t say anything more to each other, just laughed until they both fell asleep. Whatever thoughts Gabe had as he fell asleep, Cas didn’t especially care. His mind was on Dean and a bed in the small town of Lawrence, Kansas in the summer. Thoughts like that were what got a man through stormy nights at sea, foxholes on the battlefield and dogfights in the air.
“Yeah...” Dean leaned down and kissed Castiel again, slower and more gentle this time. They both hummed into it and let it linger, trailing shorter kisses after it. Then Dean settled on the bed, resting his head on Castiel’s shoulder.
“Oh,” Castiel frowned, completely baffled at what he was supposed to say to the man. “I’m sorry to hear that. Have a good night.” He made a hasty retreat before the clerk could go on, not wanting to get caught up in yet another man’s lament about love. Navigating the halls of the dormitory, Castiel arrived at his room.
Dean chuckled, “Can’t do much about the weather. So, about 7:00, then?”
“Cas, you aren’t supposed to give people gifts on your birthday.”
“I have that problem every time I come home, too.”
“Planes are perfectly safe if you have a good pilot,” Novak grinned. “And if all else fails, there’s always the parachute.”
“Okay, deal.” He hugged her again and kissed her temple. “I’m very proud of you, Anna.”
“Probably.”
“I meet a lot of people, Anna. It comes with teaching.”
“So this is it, huh?” Dean murmured into Cas’s hair.
“Good, good. Because I’d like to know.” Dean took a bite of his food and Castiel did the same, letting the act of eating keep them from having to say anything for a moment. Their silence was filled with the music played by the restaurant’s band. Most fancy restaurants had at least a small band to keep the diners entertained, if not a lounge singer or a big band. Jazzy saxaphone music accompanied a piano and easy percussion, lending a relaxed feel to the night. Dean let the music ease his unexpectedly awkward nerves.
“It would slake one kind of hunger,” Dean said, kissing at Castiel’s neck, throwing little bites into the mix as he did so. Try as he might to protest, Cas found himself closing his eyes and pressing his head back into the pillow.
War had been brewing over in Europe for the last few months when the Nazis, as led by Adolf Hitler, had begun committing genocide against the people of Germany and neighboring countries. France, the UK and Poland joined forces to fight Germany, Italy and Japan. People were speaking of it being the next World War. As of yet, America was staying out of it, all the countries in the world still reeling from the last war.
“I do,” Castiel nodded, stepping forward to close the small distance between them and brought his lips to Dean’s once again. They kissed slower this time, heads tilted in opposite directions and mouths working against each other. Dean slid his hands around Castiel’s waist, stopping on the small of his back, palms flat against the soft material of his shirt, and pulled their bodies flush against one another.
It was Halloween, a few decorations had been set up around Hickam, some fake cobwebs and carved pumpkins. Someone had decorated the mess hall with paper bats and spiders, and the chefs had gotten creative with the dinner menu. It was all the same stuff as usual, but with spookier names. Because Halloween fell on a Friday, horror films were scheduled to be showed that night and a lot of the men on base had plans to go to parties. Even Cas was going to attend one that some of his favorite students had invited him to.
Cas laughed. “I was just in the North Atlantic, sailing between Canada and Iceland mostly. It was too cold there to tan. The time before that, my mysterious tropical climate was near Cuba in the Caribbean.”
“We could always make use of both,” Castiel said, unfastening his cufflinks so he could roll up his shirtsleeves.
It was late when Castiel left the training range and his group of students, yammering about what they had received from their sweethearts and how pretty their gals were back home. Valentine’s Day was a hard time around the base, between the new cadets lamenting the distance between them and the girls they liked and the boys who had no girl to speak of back home. The men who received candy or cookies would often share, though, which tended to put people in better spirits.
“No, I mean... Well, I’ve got Jess, but you don’t... you know, you don’t really ever have anyone.”
“Yeah... If by worked you mean I kept my hands on you all night.”
Dean couldn’t help but smile, hearing that. He always assumed it was true, but it was nice to hear all the same. “Yeah, me too...”
Castiel kissed him once more, shorter this time, and finally pulled back, opening his eyes. “I will, of course. You do the same, Dean.”
from a few years ago?”
“They grow up so fast, don’t they?” Benny pretended to wipe a tear from his eye.
“Yeah, maybe just a bit.” John ruffled Dean’s hair as he passed him and went on into the kitchen. Dean followed after him. The table was nearly set and things had come together quite a lot during the few minutes it took to retrieve his father.
Sighing heavily, Dean consented. After one more quick kiss to Cas’s lips, he brushed out the shorter man’s jacket and fastened the top two buttons. “Alright, let’s hit the town.”
Meanwhile, Cas gets sent back to his fleet on the Ranger to fight again, rather than train, since the US is now in full swing of the war. His ship ends up doing a lot of patrols. Dean’s unit ends up training for a special secret mission called Operation Torch. Neither of them can get letters to each other at this point cause neither of them knows where the other is and Cas is on a ship and they’re both in training for a secret mission so letters are heavily screened.
Castiel turned his attention to Dean, “I supposed we could wander around Chicago, see the lake, get some lunch, whatever appeals to you.”
Dean smiled and read the letter over again, chuckling to himself at how Castiel, who held himself so well in person, seemed to babble incoherently in letters. The pilot was a man of few words and Dean wondered if it took great effort to write this letter. Putting Castiel’s letter aside, Dean settled on his bed to read the others from friends and family. The folks back home talked about unimportant things, like who everyone was dating and who just got a job or an automobile. His mom sent him a birthday card with a sweet message that she penned and signed “love mom and dad.” There were a few dollars tucked in there to buy himself a gift.
“Well then! Someone make a note. This date in history, July... uh...”
Cas smiled in a playful way that was all his own, “I will. You too, Dean.”
“Fellas,” Dean said. Castiel tipped his head and furrowed his brows and Dean couldn’t help but laugh. “You can’t say ‘fellows’, man. You have to say ‘fellas’ otherwise it just sounds odd.”
“You’re a good man, Dean.” Those were the words that Cas found himself saying, nearly without his permission.
If they did go to war, Cas wasn’t really sure when he would even see Dean again. He certainly planned to make the most of his time spent with the infantryman in May, he just had to get through this next tour.
“What field of law are you interested in?” Cas enquired.
Dean had to squint a bit to read the line above Cas’s signature. It looked as if he wrote “yours” then scribbled out the “s” and added “dear friend.” Perhaps Cas was second guessing himself. Either way of signing things could have raised red flags, with the combination of the line, “I miss you.” Or, that’s what Dean guessed was going on. That was the first time Cas had written into a letter that he missed Dean. Every letter after this one would be read by censors on Cas’s ship, meaning every word after this one would be more carefully penned.
Ranger
Cas had talked about his sister joining the Navy, treated everyone he met with equal respect, regardless of status, rank, appearance, race or creed, wouldn’t bow to shown prejudice and now walked into a club some people would think he had no business going to like it was any other place. Castiel was here for the music, because he truly enjoyed it, and that was reason enough for him. Dean found himself smiling as he walked in behind Cas and they found a seat.
“You’ve got it.” He quickly finished his cereal and stood up, putting the bowl in the sink. Wrapping an arm around his mother’s waist, Dean gave her a kiss on the cheek. “And no more war talk.”
“What doubts?” Anna tipped her head, frowning.
“No, I suppose I can’t blame you.” Lifting his head, he placed a firm kiss to Dean’s lips. The pilot’s hands lifted to Dean’s chest, pushing him away after the kiss. “But we should spend at least some of this weekend outside the hotel.”
They fell silent then, both lost in their own thoughts, whether those were of Cary and Fred kissing or the desire to have something they couldn’t.
“You never know. And he probably wouldn’t mind; Sammy’s too much of a nice guy to mind. Besides, he would like you.”
“Not to me, they don’t, not like that, you little weasel.”
“Cas! Hey buddy!” His voice was casual, but he opened his arms for a hug. Cas set his things down and immediately wrapped his arms around the slightly taller man.
“Well, at least you get a fun reprieve now.” Dean turned off the sidewalk into a driveway. “We’re here.”
“Well, if it isn’t Dean Winchester,” A familiar young woman’s voice chirped from nearby. Dean turned to see Jo Harvelle standing beside him with a big grin on her face.
Even on vacation, Dean didn’t stop training. He woke early each morning and went jogging through the neighborhood and did a few exercises in the yard. People who saw him around town would wave and welcome him back. Dean tried to avoid getting caught in conversations for too long. It wasn’t that he didn’t like talking to them, it was just that he got tired of answering the same questions over and over. Yes, training was going well, no it wasn’t too hard, no, he didn’t have news of whether they were going to war or not. The girls flirted, asking if he brought his uniform and if it was very lonely at the fort and he always gave his half flirting, noncommittal responses. It was tiring, but he couldn’t ever do anything to stop it, so he tried to keep them all at arm’s length.
