"So you and Cas, huh?" He said at some point when he had noticed that Dean couldn't take his eyes off him. Dean turned his head and just looked at him but didn't answer. "We've known it forever, but we didn't want to forestall you."
"I can't take this, Cas." He whispered and Cas looked at the ceiling, trying to hold himself together.
Drop after drop, fell to the ground. Dean heard them, saw how they lightly splashed. His legs had small drops on them. It smelled like death, like war.
It was already late and Dean didn't expect him to come. Honestly, Dean thought that Cas would call  him and they would talk for three hours until one of them fell asleep, as it always was when they were on the phone.
The moment, just sitting in the kitchen in the morning, talking to someone and watching the person making pancakes reminded him of Kansas. Of his mother. Dean suppressed the thought, though it was almost impossible.
John was loud too now. Dean got tired.
"He hasn't been like that in a long time." he said quietly and Cas swallowed hard. "Did he take anything?"
He felt the bed give way as John sat down with him. He felt directly how all the tension rose in his room. It was too much for him, he could no longer bear even the smallest stress level. He just wanted some rest. Dean could have cried on the spot, because he was broken and he knew it, but he held it together.
Cas started to walk towards Dean.
"He was good." Dean said and looked at Cas who just nodded. "Everyone thought we'd just stay together for a moment because they thought we were too young, but in the end we were together for almost two years. The last few months were a long-distance relationship, that was shit, but I think if he had never moved away, we would still be together."
Then they stayed there for a while. Cas stared at the ceiling, Sam took a blanket and covered himself. Sam asked if Cas was hungry, probably just to change the topic, but Cas said refused.
Dean seemed to have calmed down after a while. John reached under his arms and helped him to his feet, whereupon they both went up the stairs. Dean looked at his room door for a moment, but John pushed him straight on into his own room.
"Wanna sit with us?" Dean suddenly heard and averted his eyes from his little brother.
The hospital was easy to find. Probably Dean didn't live at the end of the world. Only now he saw a little of the small town in which he lived in from now.
Only now Dean started to understand how everyone else felt with him. Desperate, they wanted to know what was going on so they could say or do anything. And Dean just completely closed.
Sam made the first move and hugged Dean from the side. Dean leaned into it. He wanted to promise Sam, that this would never happen, but he couldn't speak. After a while, it occurred to him that Sam probably didn't want to hear anything at all.
God, it hurt. Seeing him completly broken and crying hurt like a bitch. But Dean had to go through it. And for once in his fucking life, he had to stay strong and calm at the same time.
Even his grandparents asked where Dean was. She was briefly worried that they broke up, but Cas could calm her down.
"How did you do that?" Dean sounded desperate and holy shit he was.
"Do I look like?" Dean asked deadly serious with a raised eyebrow and Cas started to laugh. Dean didn't get what was so funny, but Cas' laugh made him grin and he hid is behind his hand.
"I could have something there that could lift your spirits." He said at some point and from that moment on Dean started to listen. He turned his head to look at the stranger. He smiled at Dean mischivously.
"Nobody asked, so I didn't tell."
Dean took a short breath and realized that he was. He saw the blue eyes boy here before, but he always sat in the front row. Actually, Dean realized Castiel looked a bit tired himself.
"You still let him live here." Dean stated.
It was like a monster and Dean didn't know who had created it. Had it been him? He didn't know. But it seemed to Dean that it was getting bigger and bigger, more dangerous. As if it would work out some strategies to finally get to Dean completely.
"Did he take anything?" Cas heard John ask and that completely tore him out of the trance in which he had been stuck for minutes. Cas had tears in my eyes and his heart was beating way to fast.

Was he still in a dream? Dean couldn't believe that all of this could be real.
Dean was so fucked up. So fucked up and still had so much luck. Dean was wondering when all of this would crash.
It didn't take long for Cas to reply.
. Cas would drive him crazy. If Dean would say something he would just beg for him.
After that, they didn't talk much about themselves anymore, but rather about the school and other people. Something gave Dean the feeling that he was safe with Cas.
"I don't know." John answered.
There he finally took off the bandage and tried not to stare at his arm. He tried to ignore the ugly, long seam.
"Dean, calm down. It's all right, just let me talk." John tried to reassure Dean, but that was no longer possible. Not really.
He didn't feel like he was in a tunnel anymore. Everything was normal again, but he still felt kind of light. Maybe even numb at some point.
Sam said it would be better for them to live somewhere else, and Dean knew that his younger brother was just repeating John's words. Sam lied, Dean didn't know if Sam was aware of this, and he did everything for their dad and the worst part was that Dean understood it. But he couldn't be as strong as Sam was.
On sunday evening Sam and Dean met on the roof. It was their secret little place, their safe bubble. They wondered if John suspected that they were sitting on the roof and staring at the sky, while it turned dark. That sometimes they waited together for a shooting star that never came.
Nobody wanted to go out of their way to cook after the first day of reality. After school, Sam and Dean had holed up right in their rooms. Sam had played some video game, Dean had fallen asleep, exhausted from real life.
After the boys said goodbye and Dean entered the house, he already began to miss him. That was so cheesy, and Dean knew it, but that's the way it was.
"Dean..." John began and straighted his back. "It's a hard time right now."
With a few gestures Cas had told Dean where he lived. Two streets above, left side of the street, next to the orange painted house. If he just wanted to come by one day. Cas had smiled softly before turning and walking down the street.
Dean looked at Sam in shock. He hadn't expected Sam to be so honest with him. He wanted to say something, but he felt the lump in his throat tighten. His eyes filled with tears, but he didn't care.
Warnings: Drug use
Slowly, uncertainly, he moved his hips until they both found a good rhythm and got lost in each other. Dean squeezed his eyes shut and groaned again and again as Cas' breath hitched.
"He's okay, I guess." Dean answered. "He can go home tonight. Just wanted to keep him there overnight, as it always is."
"Where have you been?" Dean heard Sam ask and closed his eyes. His voice didn't sound like he had just woken up. He knew, he fucking knew and Dean wanted to run.
"Isn't it cold out there?" They suddenly heard a voice behind them. John handed them two glasses of sparkling wine, and both of them were equally confuse, but they drank it anway.
If Dean were in Lawrence, at home, he would have said something back a hundred times already. But Dean wasn't home, still felt like a stranger, and he was too tired to engage in a confrontation, so he just accepted being yelled at now at nine in the morning.
"Where am I?" Dean asked even though he already knew.
"I just don't understand how she hated me so much. From this one moment, just because I'm gay. I don't understand how quickly feelings can change, you know what I mean?"
"You like him, right?" Sam asked.
"I would understand." Dean said and looked at the ceiling again.
A universe where the sun came out and it was warm. Where it smelled like cotton candy again, a little bit of watermelon.
Cas followed a bit behind. In fact, Dean just did it and ran straight all the way home. Cas wanted to stop him, calm him down, make him sleep at his place, but Castiel was afraid of him.
She smiled at his statement and distributed new dough in the pan.
Because he probably was...
It was a quiet, pleasant summer night.
Actually, Dean wasn't even sure he wanted to know right now. He wanted to go home. To Lawrence and crawl into his bed there. He wanted hot chocolate, the way
Part of Dean just wanted to punch him in the face because Dean already had enough problems and worrying about some blue-eyed dude was bugging him even more.
"You should tell him, Dean."
Dean didn't know if he was here because Cas wanted me to be safe or because he felt safe with Dean. It didn't matter. Nothing mattered right now.
The doctor said that he should stay another night, just to make sure everything was alright. john wasn't to fond of that idea, but of course he let it happen.
For a long time Dean stood rooted in the door frame and stared into his clean room. His bedsheets were new, the wooden floor was almost shiny. His window was open. As if nothing had ever happened.
John did nothing, just looked at Dean. After a while he put his arm around Dean, which pulled Dean a little more back to reality. He slowly looked up until he could see into his father's eyes.
"She would have liked you." Dean mumbled at some point.
"Do you really want to go home like this?"
"If you want me to rely on sedatives and antidepressants all the time, I think that's great. But I don't want to get up every morning and throw in six pills, which in the end won't do anything anyway, because the world is still fucked up!"
Just them, without some idiot who would make a stupid comment about Dean bringing Sam along.
Actually, Dean smiled for a second there.
Some time later John entered the room and Dean wanted to bury himself under the covers. He could already feel the tears in his eyes and almost couldn't breathe.
"Different person. There are worlds between him now and then. He was very exhausting, we were very worried." She told Dean.
"It's sick." Dean stated.
"Compared to him, I'm fine." Sam answered anyway and Cas nodded.
He sighed and pulled out his phone.
him." Sam emphasized and Dean swallowed hard, but skillfully avoided the look his little brother gave him. "And he likes you."
He had walked there with Sam, the school wasn't too far away and Dean hated the idea of riding the school bus. They had arrived there and had separated.
At least that's what he thought. He didn't believe it himself.
But right now he didn't want to be honest, neither with himself nor with his father.
He could no longer put anything in any place.
"Jesus, you sound like my dad." Dean rolled his eyes.
"I want to go home. I just want to go home. I wanna go home." He rambled.
Cas could have cried.
Dean nodded and looked over at his little brother. He was smiling slightly, but his eyes were sad. Dean didn't want Sam to be sad. It broke his heart.
"I'll think about it, okay?" Dean tried to smooth everything down. They both probably knew that Dean wouldn't even think about it for a second. Nevertheless, John nodded in agreement.
Dean stood in the doorway, slightly wary of entering the room.
Cas had given Dean his number after he dropped him off at his house. He had told Dean that a couple of years ago an elderly couple had lived here, but now is housed in the retirement home. Nursing case, he had said.
"Are you okay?" Cas asked again, now in person, and Dean just looked at the floor for a while. He felt as if he could see the question in front of him, but there were no possible answers.
. There was something and that something made Dean's heart jump. Cas nodded too, but it looked like he was checking something in his head.
"Me neither."  John sighed, but then began to nod slightly.
Then he left, leaving Cas alone in their house, where he might feel more at home than all three of the Winchesters together.
John was sitting on one of the benches at the entrance. He looked at Dean, then at the bike but said nothing because it was the most unnecessary thing in the world.
And right there, Dean loved him more than anything.
After the bell rang and everyone ran to their next class, Cas held Dean back for a moment.
"Here I am."
There were already a few stars in the sky, the moon half full.
"That won't change." Dean said honestly, quitly, crossing his arm. "I can't. I can't go out. I don't want to."
He coudldn't imagine that. He couldn't imagine Cas sitting alone somewhere and getting drunk. Dean couldn't imagine that Cas was aggressive. Cas had told him that once. Cas used to go to parties a lot, drinking and smoking and being pretty mean. Dean couldn't imagine that.
"No." Cas shook his head. "I have no right to be mad at you."
"Do you want to stay?" Cas asked quitly and Dean nodded, because of course he fucking did.
After that John had put Dean in his own bed, whereupon his son fell asleep immediately. Dean doesn't know if John said anything or not.
Sam nodded and Cas buried his face in his hands again.
His arm hurt.
"Your expectations are a little too high." Dean said in a rough voice, but he laughed a bit.
Because Dean had no desire to rebuild everything. Besides, he thought that no matter how well he might be doing one day, he would still be a far too exhausted and tired soul. It felt like he had wasted so much of his life energy over the last year that he now only had the bare minimum to stay afloat.
The house was quiet when he entered it. Dean looked toward the patio door and could see his father working in the garden. For a second he thought about helping him, whatever he did there, but something was holding Dean back. That's why he just knocked briefly on the glass, whereupon his father turned around and gave him a short wave.
What was wrong that his dad couldn't tell him on the phone? Was Sam ill? Did something happen to him? No, he had done something, right? John had said he didn't know what Sam had done. What was it for fucks sake?
Dean swallowed hard and looked at Sam. Then he slightly smiled at him, until he realized that he was doing something horrible and he couldn't stop it. He gave his brother some sort of hope and he didn't know if he could fulfill his wishes.
Cas probably couldn't imagine Dean being a happy, carefree boy either.
"I don't try to be mean or an ass."
And now he sat here, with his sad puppy eyes.
Cas ran his hand through his dark hair and just stared at Dean, who was still lying unconsciously on the floor.
"Cas has a punching bag."
"Just do it."
For a moment, it seemed possible that Dean didn't hate his life.
He lit the cigarette and stared down the field. Butterflies and birds flew around and a little further Dean could even see fucking rabbits.
Cas put his arms around Dean and hugged him tighter. Dean was a bit taller than him, but right now he felt so fucking small. Dean buried his head in Cas' neck and for a while they just stood there.
It felt like he wasn't allowed too. As if that wasn't his house.
"God yes." Cas' eyes wandered over Dean's body as if he would undress him. As if he didn't know where to start and to be honest Dean really didn't know ether. The last time was long ago and Dean also had a different opinion of himself now.
It was incredibly silent and Cas still looked at the spot Dean had fallen at.
Dean didn't know how Sam did it. Lead a normal life, make friends, pursue his hobbies.
Not even five minutes later they were on the bed in Dean's room. They sat on the bed, Cas cross-legged, while Dean just put his legs up. They backs were on the (still white) wall. Dean took Cas hand after a while and started to play around with it. Count his fingers, draw on it.
"Of course!" Cas replied as fast as he had turned. He probably knew Dean well enough at the moment that he had expected this question. "Honestly. We're friends."
Dean tried not to let it show how tired and weak he actually was. He struggled up the stairs and opened the door to his room. Cas followed him quitly.
Dean wanted to say something that would make his father feel better for maybe just a second.
"We all do stupid things." She tried to calm him down or cheer him up somehow. Dean tried to nod.
Cas probably already knew and that's why he didn't really had a reaction to Dean's coming out.
Dean just looked at him with his dark, sad eyes and it broke Cas' fucking heart. Cas wanted nothing more but for Dean to talk to him. But what else wa there to talk about? Even if, what could Cas say to make it better?
Mention of selfharm, homophobia, abuse.
Cas never spoke of it again. But he took more care of Dean's behavior. That's why he didn't drink anymore, but rather beat up Cas' punching bag. Made more sense, caused less pain.
Dean could hear insects buzzing, and every now and then something would fall from the trees.
Cas knelt between his legs and opened the lube bottle, whereupon he spread some of the substance on his fingers. Dean felt his fingers on his entrance and took a deep breath, trying to relax until Cas pushed a finger into him.
It was hot, but Dean was used to the heat.
"What?" He asked confused and Dean took a shaky breath. Of course it was shaking, this was a confrontation Dean hated. It was akward, almost mean.
And slowly Dean realized that this was serious. That he was in a relationship and sometimes Dean didn't know if he was ready or not. But he wanted it so much, even though it scared the shit out of him, that Dean always rejected these thoughts as fast as he can.
John came home from his first day of work at this car workshop and decided to order pizza. After the bell rang and the smell of gratinated cheese filled the house, the three found themselves at the small dining table with three chairs.
Cas was then as Sam was now. Dean couldn't wrap his head around it. He was just a kid.
And then everything went so fucking fast.
Gabe gave him a high five.
"Yes, sometimes you need more time, you know?" Dean tried to lie, already knowing that it was pointless.
Some people walked past him, others stood at the entrance talking. Dean saw cars leaving the parking lot. Then his eyes fell on Castiel's bike.
Dean wanted to go home.
"It's not that I'm uncomfortable." Cas wanted to clarify and Dean raised his hand.
Cas raised his head and looked at Dean. He frowned.
Dean wondered why, but didn't ask about it.
He smelled like a beautiful summer evening at the beach, with sand that stuck to the towel and clothes. The kind of sand that you would find forever in a backpack.
In the sink, red drops flowed into the drain.
"Dean?" John started instantly after Dean picked up.
"Dean." his father sighed and Dean knew that this topic went into the second round. "You can't go on like this, you can't run away from people and new situations all the time."
"Yeah." He would fall asleep on this bench, I knew that.
He sat up and slid closer, took Cas' hand and pushed it under the blanket, whereupon it now laid on his crotch. Cas couldn't take his eyes off Dean. He looked lost and as confused as Cas was at that very moment. At some point he rested his head on Cas' shoulder.
Cas grinned at him as he opened the door.
"Really?" Dean still laughed and let himself lay down next to Cas.
"All the way?" Sam asked with a frown and Cas nodded. "Shit."
"You just don't want to tell anything." Cas said and dropped onto the couch as well. "What's his name? Sammy?"
"I don't, just a thoguht." Cas said calmly and Dean just stared at him. He took his hand off my shoulder and met Dean's eyes for a brief moment.
He didn't look at his father who stood across from him, behind a chair. John has never been able to sit at a table to have a conversation.
Nothing to hide, to hide
"I know." Sam sounded tired and restet his head on the steering wheel. For a moment Dan was worried that it would honk, but it remained silent.
"Sammy. Hey, look at me." Dean gently reached for Sam's shoulder and pushed him away, so he would look at Dean.
"Fuck, Dean." Cas exhaled after a while, his arms shaking a tiny bit.
They shared a cigarette.
"Sure." Dean replied without giving it much thought. He couldn't even think about it, because his brain was lost in thought again.
Dean had no idea what to say, so he kissed him gently. Words just couldn't describe much at this moment anyway.
And here he was. Far away from hate.
"Dean!"
"Thanks, Cas." he said without turning around and heard the other one stop. No one moved, nothing was heard, absolutely nothing. As if they were alone in the world, in the middle of the forest.
He unlocked it for a moment to see if he might have any message from Sam, but nothing.
Dean grabbed his phone and immediately saw a message from John.
For a while, they just looked at each other while lying on their backs. It took Dean an eternity to convince himself to put his hand on Cas'. An ugly arm he could stare at. At first Cas looked at him in astonishment until he gently squeezed his hand and smiled.
It was getting better at school. Dean was able to concentrate better and got along better, thanks to Cas. Cas made him study at least an hour a day. Maybe sometimes he was rewarded for it. Maybe.
Had he removed the stone or was the pile simply losing balance? It felt like thousands of small items were boring into him. It was as if shards of glass were piercing every inch of his body. Dean could feel his brain burn. As if every nerve, every single cell was on fire. His body didn't know what to do anymore, to make it stop.
"Maybe you are friends?" Sam challenged him and Dean just rolled his eyes, but couldn't help smiling.
"Dean, get yourself together!" Cas heard John say and then he only heard footsteps on the stairs. His gaze then went to said staircase and he only saw Sam's eyes looking at him with concern. He took a step closer to the living room, but Cas only shook his head. And he listend and just stopped in the middle of the hall.
"You still manage." Dean muttered, and at that moment he really just wanted to hide under his blanket and never come out. He didn't want to talk, he didn't want to, he didn't want to.
It was too later when Dean realized that he was starting at Cas. He dicided that he wouldn't change it. Cas literally was a ray of sunshine, with his colorful clothes and blue eyes and dark hair and his fucking smile. He made Dean feel better. Safe.
Carefully, he slipped into my room and crawled into his bed. Sam faced the wall. Dean faced the room.
"Leave me alone."
Dean had to laugh for a moment, because how quickly can you change your mood?
"Just five minutes." Dean murmured and took Castiel's hand. It was warm and soft. Their hands fit together perferctly.
"Do you still have contact with your ex?" Dean asked instead, before Cas would start his list of questions.
Cas knew what Dean meant, just as he knew he didn't have to answer if he didn't want to. He could just say that he didn't want to talk about it, and then Dean would just have just laid down, pretending that I had never asked anything.
"Yeah, so? It doesn't matter." Cas looked at him sadly and Dean sat up again. Dean wasn't as bad as an hour ago. Maybe it's because of the stuff that they pumped into him.
Suddenly Dean snapped back to reality and recognized the street he was on. It was not far anymore.
"Jessica." Sam answered after he cleared his throat.
"I don't know." Dean honestly said. "I mean, I do, but it feels like I don't. It feels like I have absolutely no idea, what the fuck is going on. I don't know why the shit that happens, happens."
"Come on." the guy tried anyway with a cheeky grin.
"I understood that. I meant, why?"
, anything, does it go away?" Cas asked.
After a few minutes, and a lot of consideration, Cas finally decided to go upstairs to check on his boyfriend. He was afraid of it. He was afraid of people who were loaded with emotions and didn't know where to put them.
"And... the other thing?" he asked a little scared. Dean let the smoke get out of his lungs and began to shake his head. He took a drag of his cigarette. "Can you stop?"
Only then Dean realized that his head was resting on Cas' chest, his arm around his torso. Cas' arm was wrapped around his waist. Carefully, still sleepy, Dean looked up. Cas was still sleeping. He looked cute with his unmade hair, sticking in all directions.
Sam, his little brother, wandered out of the house and Dean turned away. He was just fourteen but even Dean knew that Sam acted more like an adult. He grew up too fast. They loved each other, Sam and Dean. They were like those siblings from the movies nobody believed in. Like a fairytale that everyone doubted. But like every fairy tale, there is a real core somewhere. And this real core was them. They spent a lot of time together and never had a huge fight. Dean was ready to give him everything he had and his presence in this shithole, somewhere in Iowa, proofed that.
"Anyway, I was stumping around the city covered in a little bit of blood, sitting on a train and driving to my grandparents. My grandmother wiped my blood off, cleaned my wounds, drove me to the hospital where I was told I had a broken rib and a lot of bruises. My grandfather went to my mom and got my things. He never told me if he talked to her or anything. I don't wanna know." Cas explained pretty fast and painless.
Was it weird to let Cas know?
Sam looked at Dean with a frown, probably not really believing him. He saw Dean talking to someone, but maybe it wasn't that important. It didn't matter to Dean. At least that's what he told himself.
, Cas answered after a while and Dean was so fucking glad.
And then it was getting late. Sam fell asleep and it was quiet, just not in Dean's pretty little head.
"Do you really think I feel that way about you?" John asked with a frown and Dean looked up. In that moment Dean didn't know what he was thinking. One part voted for yes, the other for no.
Maybe he was trying to act like a normal teenager who was just skipping school. He ate a bowl of cereal before the doorbell rang.
He reached for his cell phone, which was lying on the nightstand next to him. He frowned when he saw a message from Cas.
When class started, it began to rain again and Dean stared out the window.
His thoughts were more about how he could hide all this from his family. It was almost creepy how routinely he could clean everything. It was terrible that he had a routine for this at all.
His father looked at him and Dean really had no idea what that look meant. Whether it meant he didn't want to tell him or he couldn't. Or if he wanted to, but thought he shouldn't.
"But I don't want you to be alone at home."
"I think everyone likes him."
Sometimes Dean wondered if this was all real. If maybe it was just a cruel test he had to pass and then everything would be like before.
"Neither do I."
Somewhere, Dean started to feel that he shouldn't have told Cas anything. That it was stupid and he should just let it go next time instead of asking for so much attention. He tried to suppress it.
"Really?" Dean frowned. Cas shook his head slightly. There was so much honesty in his eyes.
"I feel like shit. What about you?"
"Did you go to school today?" Dean asked at some point to break the silence. In fact, he wasn't sure if Sam went there or waited the entire day for Dean to wake up.
A fey moment later his sweater was gone, and before Dean could waste another thought on that fact, he put his hand on Cas' neck and rejoined their lips. Dean gave him complete control.
Dean's heart contracted. It hurt, but it wasn't a bad pain. And in Cas' eyes was so much and Dean had no idea what that all meant, but one thing was clear: He wanted to kiss Cas.
"The guy that was here." Sam started while they still looked up. "Do you like him?"
"They're the best." he explained and Dean smiled slightly.
No more thoughts were wasted, as if that was the only solution. And suddenly, that thought scared Dean.
"No, you should have done it in the first place." Mrs Hanscum insisted and Dean tried really hard not to roll his eyes.
"I'm sorry." Dean apologized after a while. He was, he always is, but he also just wanted to break this horrible silence.
"Stop running away and talk to me." John asked rightfully which made Dean feel even more constricted.
"Who broke up?"
"It was a school day that was as normal as any other school day before. I searched for her all over the house. She had to be there because her car was in the driveway. She didn't nap on the couch or the bed. There was no food in the kitchen like always. Her phone was lying on the dresser."
"We basically just met and now we're here, isn't that weird? Just the way human connections works. I mean, not in a bad way, but-?"
His father just looked at him until he put an arm around Dean. He rubbed Dean's shoulder for a while.
"You don't have to promise me anything. This is for you." Sam said.
With a father who was absolutely not okay and hid his medication. With a brother, who hasn't been the same since the hospital. Sam still felt guilty, and Dean tried so much to talk him out of it. There was no reason, it wasn't his fault.
"Just 'cause." he answered and looked at his brother. "I want you to have friends."
"I know what you meant. I understand things, Dean. I know what happened. I know what you saw. I understand, believe me, but I have no idea what's in your fucking head and dad doesn't know either. And he knows that." he explained and Dean couldn't do anything but stare at him sadly. "He just wants to help you."
, Dean texted Cas.
" Definitely not, but we'll pretend we don't know that."
And when he was gone, Cas laid there staring at the ceiling, hoping that maybe Dean would be better now.
Dean frowned. Dean knew how everything worked. But then it occurred to him that maybe Cas just wanted to prepare him. Maybe even protect him. That's why I started to nod.
"Can you stop?" Dean heard Cas ask after a felt eternity.
Dean looked up slowly, Sam had lifted his head again and was staring at the road ahead of them. There was nothing to see. Just more ugly houses that Dean could hate. He fucking hated it here, he wanted to destroy every house in that street.
Maybe he was an angel.
"Someday." Dean said.
So, why didn't he say anything?
"Did you ever look at someone and asked yourself, why are they like this? Like, what is their story? Why do they do what they do? What made them like this?" Dean asked while looking into the nightsky. Maybe he was asking the moon as well.
"Sam, go back to your room." John ordered and now Dean also heard how tired he was. Dean's head hurt and he felt the adrenaline disappear from his circulation and he calmed down.
His train of thought was interrupted when the door was opened and John came into his room. Dean slowly sat up and leaned against the wall with his back. Dean closed his eyes, well aware that this is gonna be a deep conversation. He was tired of it.
"I know Cas. I know." He interrupted, looking at the ceiling hoping his tears would stay in his head. "I think I hallucinated. That's why I got so mad. The drugs made everything worse than it was before."
"So you're not sick." Cas stated and now looked at Dean.
"You didn't mention that you have a brother." Cas stated and Dean shrugged.
"I know." Sam smiled. "I knew he would be good for you."
"No. No, not at all." Cas shook his head.
"As long as nobody gets pregnant, it's okay." Cas said unintressted and Dean started laughing. "That's her words."
"No." Cas answered shortly. "My mom is the only one who made a big deal out of it. But, I was a bit scared they would change their mind with me having my first boyfriend. They didn't."
"Watch me!"
Cas didn't say anything, he held Dean's hand and didn't let go.
God, Dean wanted it. Dean wanted it, everything he could get.
Again, Dean heard his name, heard it was Cas, heard his footsteps as his boyfriend ran after him.
John didn't.
He had never hurt himself so much, so deep and he was shocked by himself. Dean was too tired to feel anything.
"Don't force yourself, Dean."
He had his head leaning against the window pane, feeling the rattle of the car. Dean felt like he was slowly dying. As if his soul was leaving his body piece by piece.
Dean wanted to get up. Dean wanted to go to school. Dean wanted to live.
Dean looked up and John's face actually relaxed. His father ran his hand over his face for a moment, whereupon he nodded.
Why was it him?
And Dean felt safe.
"Shut up, you had your first boyfriend with fourteen. I am fourteen, too." Sam tried to defend himself.
"Holy shit." Dean groaned, because it was all that he got out of him at that moment.
"It's not just alcohol poisoning." Dean said finally and John looked up. "If it would be just that, you wouldn't hold yourself back. So what is it?" Dean asked, looking at him challenging , which made his father swallow hard. "What did he take?"
Dean let out a calm breath.
"Can I ask you something?" Castiel tore him out of his thoughts and Dean looked down at him.
Dean appreciated his company.
"You're not okay, right?" Cas asked softly after a while and Dean swallowed hard. His heart hurt, because it didn't know what to do. It felt like he could trust him, but could he though?
"I already said no." Dean said and John sighed. Like always. Because they had this exact conversation way too many times now.
"Half an hour?" Dean frowned for a moment, didn't expect that he was gone for that long. He really believed it were just five minutes, but he probably was stuck in his brain for too long.
"Not far from here. A bit higher than the sports field. You can see the whole village from up there. I always liked to the few." He explained and Dean nodded understandingly.
Dean was tired. On so many fucking levels and right now he just wanted to sleep. Dean wanted to switch off, find something like peace. Shut down and restart tomorrow as if nothing had ever happened.
"He is all alone."
"We'll make it work somehow." He said instead and Dean looked up slowly. John looked tired, so Dean decided to agree. At least it didn't end in another fight. John ruffled Dean's hair, something he always did when Dean was still little. Then he got up and left the room.
"Thanks for letting me into your safe bubble, I guess." Dean said and Cas smiled gently.
Dean was shocked, his mouth slightly open. At that moment, Dean wanted nothing more than to be an asshole. He wished that Castiel's words left him cold, that he could just turn around and leave.
"You can." He said with a tiny nod.
Dean just nodded, and Cas squeezed his shoulder.
The sky was clear, the sun was shining down mercilessly. It was almost... nice? Not a single person was near, only Dean and Cas. The grass looked greener than yesterday, generally the world looked more beautiful. Were this some weird hormones? Dean had already forgotten how that feels.
"I'm sad because of my mom too." Dean said at some point and Cas frowned, looked almost shocked. Dean would have been just as shocked by his honesty, if it wouldn't hurt so much. It hurt so fucking much and Cas grabbed his hand.
After a while they found themselves in Cas' bed again. Dean laid on his chest, his arm around his torso, Cas' arm stroking his back. They didn't sleep, though that happened quite often. At some point Dean would have to get up and walk home and that was just one of the last things he wanted to do.
So, in the end, it was a really good school day, where everything felt normal.
"Do you like him?"
Dean looked straight forward.
"You mean?" Cas asked with a frown. Dean nodded, because fuck yes.
"How was he?"
"Slept well?" she asked, handing Dean the promised cup of coffee.
After an eternity, Sam sat up again and ran a hand through his face. He sniffed.
"I will." Dean nodded and set his cup down on a halfway straight brick. Dean cleaned his throat and buried his hands in his hair. "I just don't know how."
At that moment, hope spread inside of the little family. Hope that they might survive it. That eventually, even if it isn't this year or next year, they could be happy.
Dean lost himself in these thoughts until Sam held the chip bag under his nose. So Dean decided to play along, looked into his room to make sure their dad wasn't coming and stuffed a handful in his mouth.
Dean lost right then and there. He wouldn't sleep in the car, he wouldn't ruin everything. He would play along, because he didn't know what else to do.
"Okay, five minutes."
Suddenly he was angry, full of energy and then Dean found himself just running down the stairs and out of the house. He heard his name but didn't respond. The cold air hit him in the face but Dean managed to ignore it.
A few weeks later Dean was sitting on the terrace with John.
For a while they sat together in silence. It got colder and Dean disappeared into his thoughts. The sun disappeared behind the clouds again and a storm came up. And it seemed like Sam knew and that's why he wasn't leaving.
"What?" he asked, while Dean tried to sit up a little.
"My sedative." his father finally answered and Dean's heart stopped beating. At that moment everything started to move slower for sure. His vision was blurred, he heard everything muffled.
"How do you not know?"
"That's nice." Castiel mumbled calmly and Dean smiled, because yes, it was nice. Very nice.
"What did you see?" He asked with a worried look.
As Dean was working through this chain of thought, he heard the door open. His head immediately turned in the direction of the door. It was good that their couch was right at the hallway.
"Oh, fuck off!" Dean said annoyed and closed his eyes. Sam frowned in confusion and turned away. Dean just wanted him to leave. He held his breath and knew that he had hurt Sam. His brother was so sensitive and Dean knew it, so he took advantage of it. Dean couldn't help it and he couldn't watch Sam as well. His eyes were still closed but he, saw Sammy's glassy eyes right in front of him. Sam slammed the door and Dean released a breath he didn't know he was holding.
Cas gave Dean a new video game and said it was a shame they only had one.
"I shouldn't do something, I don't wanna do."
"Dean."
It was loud in his head.
"Okay." Dean nodded anyway, because he would try. Even if he failed.
"No." Dean answered honestly and Sam raised his eyebrows. "I beat the shit out of a punching bag."
Dean looked around for a moment,getting an impression of his surroundings.
"I wanted to apologize." his father started and then Dean's eyes found his.
"I don't care. The main thing is that I get something normal to eat." Sam said while John walked into the living room. His eyes wandered to meet Dean's and his son just nodded.
Cas didn't notice much, it felt like his brain was just filtering the whole thing. Then he heard Dean screaming something with his mom. That she was dead. Then he asked why. And he asked that often. And the more he asked it, the sadder it sounded.
To Castiel's surprise, Dean responded by turning around. His head found the way to the surface and he looked at Cas.
Dean remembered the blue lights, how sorry they were even if they didn't had anything to do with it. Mary was gone before they arrived, probabaly for a few hours already.
I'm so sorry it took me so long to upload again. Either I was fucking unmotivated or I was too motivated, but for other stories. Great, isn't it. But here it is now, I hoope you enjoy.
Sam frowned, silently asked how the fuck this happened and Cas shrugged lightly.
Actually, Dean's first intuition was to run away, but he didn't.
"I've only lived here for three years, before that I lived in the middle of the city. It's not that far from here, it doesn't matter. I live with my dad's parents, my dad is in Europe, has a company that has something to do with technique, not my cup of tea, but he comes on the holidays." Cas said fast, while he looked anywhere, but Dean's eyes.
It seemed to him that I couldn't finish reading the other ones. As if this book had just been ended, as if it had broken off in the middle of the sentence. As if you had never written it, just had the idea of it.
"Nothing, actually. The times where shit was going on are pretty much over." He laughed briefly, but Dean knew that this pretty, littke laugh was only there to hide something.
Cas opened the door and they entered the house.
"It also depends a lot on whether you want it or not. I don't want it." Dean clarified.
"Me too." Cas admitted and it made Dean smile slightly. "Can I?"
"I know." Cas mumbled and let himself sink into the couch. Dean had told him that he used to smoke a lot of weed back in Kansas, apparently even before his mom died. It didn't make it better though. It was raining outside. "He just went here. After he shouted at me. He just went here."
What has to happen to a person to cause such damage? Dean knew, his father didn't. John would never know and to be honest Dean envied him for this. A part of him was glad, no one should ever know, but another part was mad.
They just wanted to stay here, in this room, this bed. Forever.
For some time they sat in silence next to each other. The only thing you could constantly hear was the rustling of the bag. The lights were off in the other houses, but all stars where shining in the sky and for a few seconds it felt like the earth was not the worst place ever. As if life weren't totally sad and unpredictable. Yes, actually it felt okay.
At that moment, Dean didn't know what he felt. Part of Dean wanted to tell him everything, like he didn't care if he knew or not. He already knew this part of Dean, this story would certainly not surprise him. But another part just wanted to kick Castiel out. Preferably completely out of his life and not just out of this house.
And Dean was serious. Cas wasn't like his father or Sam. Dean didn't want them to see it, Dean didn't want to hear about it, he didn't want them to have anything to do with it. But he trusted Cas and Cas wouldn't say aynthing bad or stare. He would just accept it and Dean knew that. Deep in his heart, he knew it, but his brain couldn't  deal with that fact.
Everytime Dean thought about it, a part of his soul died. He was drained of energy.
It wasn't and it wouldn't be. Sam wasn't okay. If he would be okay, Dean would sit on the roof with him right now. But he was here, breathing in the smell of sanitizer.
So Dean got up, put his plastic cup on the table and went after the blonde stranger. They ran up a flight of stairs, walked through some door, and arrived in a bathroom.
Sam would go to school while John had to go to work. He couldn't just take time off because his son was going crazy. Cas would be a good distraction.
All the distance disappeared.
The boys asked about him, but Cas said that he didn't know anymore than they did. They believed him or at least they made it look like they did. They still didn't know about their relationship. Maybe that should only happen when Dean is better.
Sam shouldn't know about all this shit.
Suddenly he felt a hand on his shoulder and looked at it.
Dean watched while Castiel took his notebook and began to write off the board. At first Dean frowned and was confused until he understood what he was doing and Dean didn't mean to smile, but he did anyway.
"I didn't want that to happen." he sobbed. "You have to belive me, Dean."
At Dean's home it was like nothing had ever happened. Although John always took care now that Sam wasn't alone at home and regularly contacted hi. Sam pretended that nothing had happened. Nobody mentioned it, so it never happened, right?
"Was it okay?"
"Sammy, he-"
Cas threw the bottle of lube on the bed and Dean automatically spread his legs, whereupon Cas chuckled.
It took him a few tries before he got the cigarette lit.
"You wanna sit with us?" he heard a familiar voice and looked up. Dean didn't answer for a while, just stared at the blue eyes boy with a tray in his hand. Dean was silent for too long apparently, because Castiel now just sat in front of him. Dean frowned for a second.
"And you take pills. Great dad, that's great, that's how I want to be!" It left Dean and he regretted it on spot. But he could't calm down, couldn't save the situation. The only thing he could do right now was adding fuel to the fire.
"Where the hell are you going?!" he shouted behind Dean. Dean didn't even put on his jacket, but Cas was carrying it.
"They're going to my auntie's and I didn't really feel like it anyway, and after begging a bit, they said I could stay here." Cas grinned as Dean asked him for details.
"Sam, actually. I just call him Sammy." Dean explained and looked at the ceiling, before their eyes met. They just looked at each other for a while until Cas started to laugh.
"Look at me." Cas gently asked, putting a hand to the older ones cheek.
Afer that, Sam and Dean sat together on the roof.
He just really didn't want to go to the new house. He didn't want to see it, didn't want to help carry the ugly boxes in and fuck, if he was honest he actually didn't want anything. All his life, he wouldn't even have dreamed of moving with his family and certainly not to another state!
"Just do it. Tell me how crazy I am, that I lost my fucking mind, that I'm stupid, tell me everything I've known for a long time and have heard in every imaginable way." Dean rambled and Castiel just looked at me like a dog who didn't know what to do. Dean had thrown the stick, the other one only had to get it. Dean pressed my lips together, ready to be attacked.
Cas was sober again, while Dean was fucking high. He couldn't even walk a straight line and almost fell a few times. Actually Castiel hoped that Dean would calm down on the way back, but that wasn't the case.
At some point Castiel took a deep breath, as if he had held it for ages.
"Turn around." Sam demanded
The door on the other side was ripped open and Dean opened his green eyes. He silently watched his little brother climb into the car and shut the door. Now it was just the two of them while they hid from the whole world. They didn't look at each other. Sam stared straight ahead, while Dean focused on his shoes
They were nice, even had a dog for some time. Their grandchildren often visited them when they were younger. As they got older, they still took care of them, but once they all went off to college, they were pretty much on their own.
"You're mad." Dean noticed.
Cas remembered sitting on his grandma's sofa covered in blood. She just held him in her arms, while the shock slowly faded away and he started to cry. He thought I would die right there and he was so scared. Til this day, he doesn't know what he was so afraid of.
So one day later he went to Cas' house, got his New Year's kiss and asked him if they wanted to go for a walk. Castiel openly showed his confusion to Dean, because it was freezing cold and i Dean was honest, he wasn't a friend of movement anyway. At the end Castiel, of cours, agreed and grabbed his jacket.
He closed his eyes. Dean was tired, but something didn't let him sleep. He couldn't even say exactly what it was. Maybe it was this monster waiting in the corner of his room.
Dean had carried it around with himself for months. This huge secret or what it was for him.
Quickly, Dean let the towels disappear and cleaned the sink. He pulled down the sleeves of his shirt and tried to leave the bathroom as quietly and unobtrusively as possible.
Dean closed his eyes and tried to stop the train of thought that started.
"Sammy?" Sam looked up. "Get her, tiger."
At some point Dean was just exhausted and laid his head on Cas' shoulder, whereupon he put his arm around Dean and pulled him closer.
He had to try hard to get up. Not because he physically couldn't, but because he didn't know if his brain would pass the stimulus to his legs.
"Why don't you just ask?" Dean blinked a few times, already tensing up because
"Are you gonna tell him?" Sam wanted to know.
"No it couldn't." Dean shook his head and Cas looked at him, tilting his head.
"You didn't miss anything at school." Cas started. "The guys think you just skipped school, they won't talk to you about it. If there are any teachers who really dare to say something stupid, just ignore them, they have no idea."
"You're not a morning person, aren't you?" Castiel asked with a gentle smile and for a moment Dean just stared at him. Something in Dean just wanted him to shut up, but something else was amazed that Castiel was still talking to him.
This chapter is really short and I apologize for that. Also sorry for the long wait. I asure you, this fanfiction is done, but I have to rewrite some things and correct it and I sometimes lack time and, to be honest, the motivation. I will try to post more regulary. Thank you for reading and I hope that you liked this chapter, even though it is shorter and sad. The next chapter will be longer again, promise!
"Don't apologize for having feelings, okay? You take care of dad and me, all the time, cause dad and me are way to stupid for this. And you go to school and you made friends on your first day and your grades are high up. If someone should fucking apologize it should be us." Dean said seriously. "I'm sorry, Sammy. I'm sorry I'm not there for you."
Ever since Sam was little, he was always stealing John's snacks. When he was younger, of course, it wasn't okay, because he stuffed himself with unnecessary sugar.
Cas closed the door. He put down his backpack and Dean did the same.
Dean couldn't sleep for a long time, so he just listened to Cas' regular breathing. It was dark in the room, but as Dean's eyes adjusted to the darkness, he could make out Cas' silhouette. How he was buried between his thousand pillows. One leg was over the covers and his face was relaxed, his mouth slightly open.
"Your grandparents are nice." Dean said after entering Cas' room again later that evening. Cas smiled gently and dropped onto his bed.
"You're really pretty, you know?" Cas started to laugh and I did too.
During the breaks we sat together in our typical constitution. Michael talked about a party he had attended at the weekend and how he had met a totally pretty girl. He said her name was Hannah and that he had actually managed to get her number. Dean didn't expect that, because Mchael looked pretty shy.
What was it? What did hurt so much?
"Do you want to talk about it?" Cas asked softly while he watched Dean do so but Dean only shook his head.
"You really think she likes me?" Sam asked after a while and Dean smiled warmly, whereupon he nodded. "How do you know?"
Dean didn't even have to think about it anymore. He had already thought about it too often because this conversation happened too regulary. It hadn't helped him before, why would it be good for anything now?
"How do I know you like her?" Dean asked the counter question and Sam frowned. "The way you both stare and smile at each other."
"Yes." Cas answered and that was the moment when one single tear left Dean's eye and he swallowed the rest.
"But he has."
It wasn't the first time Dean's body reacted differently than his head. Sometimes Dean started shaking in the middle of the day without knowing the reason. It never lasted long and currently he had gotten used to it, but the first few times he was convinced that he had a brain tumor.
"Tell me about them." Cas insisted.
"I would have told you." he said at the end.
He pulled his sleeves up to his thumbs.
They didn't touch, but they laid so close to each other that they could feel the warmth of the other.
"He's getting his stomach pumped out." John finally said and Dean's head snapped, looking at his father in shock.
For a while they stood there like that. Cas with his body against the wall, Dean with his back to him at the window. The sun was setting, it wasn't even late. Dean realized that he could go, just run home and escape this conversation.
"There's so much in my head." Dean continued. Cas probably didn't expect it, but he smiled a little when Dean kept talking. "Do you know that feeling, when it's so fucking loud in there?"
Then Dean looked over at Sam, while that little shit just smiled at him knowingly. Dean thought about the things he could say now, but he didn't.
Dean knew it wasn't just alcohol.
"Yeah, but you
As if Dean just needed to know the reason and then he could let go, work on it, do anything. Or did he know what the problem was, but just couldn't let it collapse on him? It was as if he was standing in front of a huge pile of memories and emotions that was only held up by one stone and if Dean would just make it go away, this one little stone, this whole pile would burry him.
Sam had put two plates with Mac and Cheese on the table and after he was done, Sam announced that he was going out with some friends. Dean had frowned for a moment until he smiled faintly. But Sam hesitated. He had asked if he could leave Dean alone and of course Dean nodded, put on a fake smile, and after a few minutes his little brother left the house.
The air was fresh and clean. It smelled of wood and old leaves.
He couldn't be strong at all.
"The stiching?" his brother nodded. "No."
"Holy shit." He finally said, but he couldn't think of anything else at the moment. "I'm sorry, Cas."
Something in Dean wanted to ask Castiel why he was so nice? What exactly were his motives, but Dean didn't dare. It felt like it wasn't his bussiness or maybe there wasn't a reason at all and he would just look stupid asking. Maybe Dean would find out someday.
That's how beautiful stories start, right? With a good environment, something positive. Quiet summer nights, in which it felt like you were one with everything around you. As if everything made sense for a moment. Like you belong right here, in the place you are right now. As if your life felt like a warm embrace.
Dean didn't know an answer to that.
Maybe Dean also liked Cas because he didn't want to play it cool. He liked someone, he admitted it to himself and didn't cover it up. Dean knew too many people who looked at him weird for being so close with Sam, but Dean couldn't care less.
And he never wanted to go again.
And Dean became so, so scared.
"That's valid." Cas said with a shrug and it was okay for Dean. Dean really appreciated that about Cas, that he never made a big deal out of anything or made Dean feel like he was crazy.
"Come on." Cas said and headed for the stairs. Apparently they were both alone at the moment, but Dean didn't want to worry about that at the moment. Cas went up the stairs and Dean followed him silently.
After three days, Sam texted. He probably had his number from Dean's phone. He asked if Cas could come over to kind of take look after him. He and John would have to go somewhere and he didn't want Dean to be alone in the house.
Dean hoped, with every fiber of his body, that his father wouldn't dwell on it. He didn't have the energy to talk about this topic again.
"Wait." He said curtly and drove a hand through his hair, let it rest there for a moment. His eyes were closed and he tried to get out of this mental state he was just in. His brain needed to function right now, it can't shut down.
"Yes, but we can always catch up on that later." Cas still sounded worried and Dean straightened up, putting on his jacket.
Dean didn't say anything for a while, just stared at the ceiling.
Actually, everything was okay.
"What did you think you were doing? Why did you take that stuff?" John asked, trying to undertsnd what the fuck was going on.
"Please, don't hate me." He said at some point. The lump in his throat hurt and it wouldn't get better if he didn't start crying. But he didn't want to let it happen. "Please."
"It wasn't over." Dean stated instead and Sam looked at him sadly. Dean was sure Sam was thinking the same thing.
And in that fucking moment, Dean was sure he was an angel. Because Dean forgot what he was just thinking about.
And suddenly there was so much Dean wanted to tell Cas.
Dean just wanted to go home and curl up in his bed after school, but part of him wanted to say he would love to join them.
"I don't want you to stay here." John interrupted him and took his arm off Dean's shoulder.
He looked at the clock that was standing on his desk. It was just before seven. Dean would normally have to leave the house in twenty minutes.
Of course Dean knew what he meant, what he wanted. Demanded. And Dean felt it, he couldn't promise anything. Actually, Dean was pretty sure Cas knew that.
"Let's be creative, new chapter, we are writing." Sam started and Dean rolled his eyes. "No, come on! I will start."
It reminded Dean of the time earlier when Sam was little and had run to Dean when he fell on the playground or something. Or the time when Sam was so small and petite that even Dean could carry him around. When Dean had given him the last bowl of cereal, but Sam had given him the toy in return. When Dean had given him his ice cream because his had fallen on the floor.
Dean felt weird when he texted him. But he promised and Dean had to keep that promise before he had to see Cas so sad again. Before Dean had to do such a horrible conversation with him again.
"I've often thought about this." Cas played with Dean's ear between his teeth. "I don't know where to start. I want to do so much with you."
Somewhere, very far away, Dean heard his name. Slowly he looked up, whereupon he only saw John in his room. His eyes were wide, but Dean was too far gone in this head. Does he need to explain this? Does he have to clean this up? What is gonna happen?
It took Dean a short while before he managed to turn around and get back into the elevator to go down to the first floor. He wanted to puke.
"What?" He asked confused and looked up, met his father's eyes, who looked at him empathicly.
"Why not?" Dean asked, sounded desperate.
Dean hated this. He had it that Sam felt the same way he did. He hated that they both resorted to some shitty means to make them feel good for just a fucking second. Good was the wrong expression here, they probably didn't even feel okay. Everything was so far from okay. Maybe they just wanted to feel something else for a few seconds or nothing at all.
On the way Cas told Dean what his evening was like. That his dad had offered that Dean and Cas could visit him in America. They sat down on the cold, wet grass. When you breathed small clouds of air formed.
He didn't want his mind to wander. He wanted them to be exactly where they were at that moment.
"Yeah. I mean, what else am I supposed to do?" Dean shrugged and laughed slightly.
"I'm sorry, I- I don't know." Dean mumbled more to myself and dropped onto a pillow next to Cas. He stared at the ceiling and Dean didn't know what to say. He almost looked sad and somehow this oppressive silence hurt both of them. He didn't say anything but just started at the ceiling, but his eyes moved. As if he would scan every inch of the ceiling. But he didn't look at Dean.
"Dean, calm down, please." John became calmer, probably realizing what he said. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that."
"God, shit, Cas." Dean dropped his head onto the pillow.
"Hey, baby." He said softly and he could hear how Dean breathed out, as if he had held his breath the entire time. Castiel slowly sank onto the bed. He carefully sat on the edge, as far away from his boyfriend as possible, because he wasn't sure if Dean wanted or needed any more contact.
Dean's head was working at full speed, his heart was beating fast and hurting, and Cas was looking at Dean sadly because he knew.
Dean felt Cas' hands go under his sweater and he was scared of so many things at the same time and Cas knew that because he knew Dean. Better than he should, but it was okay. Dean tried to believe that it was okay.
"Yeah and I'm proud of you. I really am, son. But you haven't even really been outside since... you know what. You've banished all people from your life, and you refuse to take new people in. You look like a corpse, it's midsummer and you are as white as your wall." John stated and Dean wanted to run away.
"What?" Dean asked confused, remembering that he was just sitting in their new house. With half a slice of pizza on his plate.
Maybe they could just overplay it and pretend it didn't happen. Maybe they could pretend that John has always hidden his pills. As if he wouldn't worry about his kids all the time. As if they were okay.
"I like you too." Cas tried to lighten the mood and he rolled his eyes.
They both spent Christmas with their family. Cas' grandparents invited the Winchesters, but John refused. He wasn't ready for it and Dean knew that. Dean wasn't as well.
It was funny, wasn't it? That you had almost no choice but to think only of yourself. Was the human brain even created to include others? Or did they just expect too much of everyone, of humanity?
Dean threw the plates in the sink and struggled to his room, whereupon he buried himself under his covers.
He had driven the Impala to the gas station in the middle of the night. Then he drove to some deserted parking lot, sat on the hood and lit his first cigarette. Then the second. The third...
"You shouldn't-!" It snapped out of his brother, but he didn't complete the sentence. They both knew what he wanted to say and maybe Dean wanted him to say it once. Then Sam would be the asshole for a moment, not him. But he just sighed and ran his fingers through his hair.
"Good. I feel a little weird, but good." Sam answered but Dean knew.
"Bullshit." Cas rolled his eyes, getting mad, and that was the last reaction Dean expected from Cas. It made him turn around in surprise and he frowned. Cas looked at Dean as if he was expecting a response or that Dean would start a discussion but he was just too stunned for that.
"Jesus Christ, Cas." Dean laughed and Cas only raised his eyebrows.
"Yes, you are." Cas put his arm around Dean's torso and pulled him closer, forcing him to get his face out of the pillow. Cas smiled at Dean and holy shit, Dean was happy.
Just now he also didn't want a poetic declaration about how everything will be okay again. He didn't want to hear the bulshit about pain and happiness belonging together and having to coexist for life to really make sense. Because Dean had had enough of all the pain.
Dean texted.
Castiel Novak made Dean Winchester happy.
John didn't want to say it. Dean noticed how his father resisted saying it. Dean would find out anyway, so why didn't he just say it.
"Why so lonely?" Some guy he didn't know asked him suddenly. Dean just stared at him until he sat next to me. Tall, blonde hair, looked like a typical high school bully, but didn't give Dean the vibes.
"He's out of my league, I don't deserve him." Dean muttered almost to myself.
"Do your parents know?" Castiel asked softly and Dean swallowed hard and was silent for a few seconds.
Dean could do nothing except look at him. Dean was firmly convinced that no one could help him. How could they? Why couldn't anyone understand that? You probably can't help some people and Dean thought that he just belong to this group of person. Time had to heal him or rather he had to repair himself. If that's even possible.
Fuck.
"I know. I'm sorry." Dean started to apologize. "I'm so fucking sorry. I saw it in your eyes and I just kept going. I'm so sorry."
Sometimes Dean felt the need to say thank you to Castiel.
"Thanks." Dean said after a while and Cas smiled gently at him. "Tell me something."
Only a short time later Dean found himself with Cas and a cliche red plastic cup on Gabriel's couch. They chatted with the guys and a few other people for a while until Cas disappeared from the scene and talked to other people Dean didn't know about.
"Fuck you." Dean hissed and Cas backed away.
It felt like a huge load was falling off Dean's shoulders.
He knocked lightly and opened the door, after waiting for an answer long enough. It was darkened, but rays of the sun still found their way in. Dean was lying in bed, under his blanket, facing the wall. Cas could see his outlines.
Dean wondered all the time how such a nice, kind man like Cas' father could have been with such a cruel woman like Cas' mother. Although he had never met her before, but Dean didn't like the stories Cas told about her.
"You're better off without being an asshole." Castiel said after they were silent for a long time and walked past me. Dean swallowed hard and looked down at the floor. Then he cleared his throat quietly.
Cas laid on his back, propping himself up with his elbows. His hair looked even darker in the sun, if that was possible. He wore shorts and a green shirt and Dean thought it looked a bit too good on him.
Hey guys! Sadly I won't be able to upload a chapter on saturday, so the next chapter will come up on Tuesday. Thanks for reading!
Dean looked into the sky. The forest wasn't overgrown, as you could still see the sky perfectly. There was not a cloud to be seen, only clear blue. A squirrel jumped from one tree to another, causing the leaves of the treetops to rustle before it became completely still again. Birds sang farther away, but Dean blanked them out. A hazelnut landed a few feet away from Dean.
"I don't do it anymore." Dean lied while shaking his head. He didn't want to talk about it. It was sick, it was insane and not a conversation topic. It was something he did at two in the morning. Something he did for himself, others weren't supposed to know.
Dean never woke up. He just kept living the nightmare.
Then Castiel's eyes went back to Sam, who was just shocked and looked at him like a deer that was about to be run over. Then all that was heard was a muffled sound and Dean laid unconscious on the floor. Cas couldn't move, swallowed hard.
"I love you." Cas said so softly, almost like an angel, and at that moment Dean was fully convinced that he was one. Dean still couldn't say anything, still mesmerized by Castiel, so he simply nodded.
"Thanks, Gabe." Dean said after a while and smiled at him. He smiled back and patted Dean's back a little too hard.
"No problem." Cas said. "Is everything alright? With Sam?"
It had taken hours. Sam had cried too. No idea what he had said or did to convince Dean, but the older one remembered the pain he felt. At each traffic light he saw the opportunity to jump out of the car, but he didn't.
"Are you alright?" Cas still asked and Dean nodded, took a sip from his cup.
"I want to start this year right."
For a moment, his father just stood in the doorway until he walked up and sat with him. Dean wanted to say a lot, but nothing came out of him except the constant sobbing.
Neither of them had said anything for the entire drive home. John hadn't asked his son any questions. Dean fought hard to stay awake. Everything was moving in slow motion. His head had problems putting the pictures together.
It looked like Dean had friends and would do something with them everyday. In fact, Dean laughed at their funny stories or stupid jokes, not like a few months ago. Sometimes Dean and Cas looked at each other and Cas would smile for a moment until he turned back to the others.
"Let's fuck." Dean said in a rough voice. The way a voice sounds when you haven't used it for days.
"What are you thinking then?" Dean asked almost provocatively, but he couldn't ignore that also his voice was lightly shaking. Castiel surely noticed, but he didn't let it show. He let Dean play his game.
What should he do? What could he do?
"I don't believe you." John replied and Dean felt caught.
Dean had no idea about mushrooms or what they did. He had no idea of anything.
When Dean opened his eyes, he was no longer at home. It was light, far too light. He pressed his eyes shut again and now he noticed how incredibly bad he felt. Shit, where was he?
For a moment he looked up, but to his surprise Castiel only nodded in understandingly.
"I don't know." Dean said almost desperately and stood up. He wanted to get away, couldn't stand this conversation, this situation. But his father grabbed his shoulder. Not rough, but firmly.
And suddenly Dean wasn't afraid anymore.
"It's not easy to change school. Where were you before?" Castiel tried anyway. He tried to be nice and at that moment Dean hated him a little for it.
Teachers expected him to pick himself up and do something for school.
Guys I am so sorry this took so long. I didn't had any time on the weekend and I got my second covid vaccine and it really kicked, haha. But I feel better now and here is the seventh chapter. Have fun! (Even tho I really don' like it, but what am I suppose to do?)
"Do you mind if I sit here?" Castiel asked and Dean looked at him in confusion. He's never seen him in this class before. Was Dean in the right class? What day was it?
Everything was just lying around and Dean couldn't get his act together to organize it.
The next morning Dean was able to go home.
Dean looked ahead for a moment until he looked back at Castiel. He couldn't take his eyes off him. Right now he looked like an angel to Dean.
"I can submit them later." Dean suggested, though he didn't even know what the assignment was. He wasn't polite, he wasn't rude, just emotionless. He really didn't care what the answer was. He just knew what was expected of him. The teacher wanted him to feel terribly bad, because he didn't do what she expeced him to do. As if there weren't a million other reasons to feel bad.
After Dean said it, he was sorry, but he didn't show it. Not really. He just slumped down again, while he saw John swallow hard and look at him coldly. Dean sometimes just waited for the moment until his father would finally snap.
"Sorry, I haven't seen you there." He said, smiling softly.
"You're rambling." Dean laughed and propped himself up with his elbow, whereupon he could look Cas in the face. "But yes, it's a bit weird. But good weird, right?"
"I know, Sammy." Dean assured him, putting his hand lightly on his little brother's shoulder. "All of this is just too much. I understand you. I know how it is."
In the afternoon, Dean struggled to give his father false hope. He had really decided to meet Castiel and his friends in the forest. John's face was priceless. A mixture of confusion and happiness. Maybe he wouldn't worry about Dean for just one day.
When the ambulance came, they took Dean with them. John went with him. Castiel stayed with Sam, mostly because John asked him to. Sam was still just sitting in his room. Cas had dropped on the couch and if he hadn't been so fucking shocked, he would have cried at that moment.
"What's her name, buddy?" Dean asked and he could see that Sam turned a little red. He saw the way his eyes lighted up and he couldn't help but smile. His brother had his first real crush.
They looked down the street. It wasn't late yet, but it was already pitch dark. In the sky you could already see many stars and they were so unusually bright. Dean couldn't take his eyes off them. Maybe he waited for a sign, anything.
"What if you exaggerate?" Sam asked.
The feeling was worse when he stood in the middle of his room. He swallowed hard and walked toward his window to close it. After that he tried to ignore the bad feeling and sat on his table. He watched as Cas looked around his room, but said nothing.
"Do you need something?" Dean asked and John shook his head. "Tell me when I can come over tomorrow."
"You scared the shit out of me." his little brother said quietly and Dean pressed his eyes together. Dean was scared too, god, he was terrified. Of what he did and what he could do.
"Does he know?" Sam asked. Dean immediately knew what he meant and closed his eyes. It hurt Dean, every little mention hurt. Every thought of it hurt. But this question was inevitable. The topic would be inevitable. Dean shook his head.
"Sam, leave it."
"Yeah, I remember."
But Cas so desperatly wanted to stay.
Dean and Cas were sitting in a field slightly higher than the sports field. A tent was set up next to them. It was really like Cas had said, the few was absolutely beautiful. It was dawning, the lanterns down there were already on, you could see the lights in the houses. Everything was so far way.
"What?" he asked, trying to stay seated.
Maybe he don't need any therapy or medicine. Just a few morons who would constantly talk to him about nonsense. Who would get him out of the house, bring him out of himself.
Shortly after that they went into the tent and fell asleep. It was a dreamless night, because Dean's deam laid next to him.
Then they hung up and Dean got ready, whereupon a short time later he was standing in front of Castiel's house and they walked to school together.
Some time later Dean found himself with a cigarette on his roof. At that moment Dean realized that he was probably using all means to destroy his body little by little. His arms and lungs burned. His eyes watered, but he didn't allow himself to cry. It wasn't that bad, he could take it. He had to.
"It could be."
Until he was back at home.
For some time it was quiet. Dean just looked at his father, wondering if he would tell him or not. For a moment, Dean got mad because of course he knew it wasn't just that. His father should know that Dean knew. But then Dean realized why his father probably didn't tell him more. He couldn't be mad at that.
"My granddad used to go camping with me when I came here. I mean, after my mom kicked me out. He said he wanted me to get used to a life in nature."
Sam had sneaked into the room for a moment and looked at them unbelievably for a moment. Dean, who has not wanted anyone for days, has ignored his boyfriend and brother, was cuddled up with said boyfriend.
Dean had no idea what time it was, didn't know how long he had been in this bathroom. It seemed like a minute to him. Everything happened so fast.
"Rather not until tomorrow." She replied.
"That's so cheezy." He tried not to laugh.
Dean knew exactly what he meant. Cas was aware of that, that's why he said it.
After they broke the kiss again Cas pulled him closer, so that Dean's head was now on his shoulder. He was warm and quite comfortable. He smelled like cotton candy. Maybe even watermelon.
Dean didn't answer. Mostly because he didn't care, because there were thousands of other reasons why he could get a special treatment. The thing was, Dean didn't want special treatment.
"I'm Castiel, by the way." he introduced himself. He really fuccking tried and Dean wondered why. The guy had friends, he didn't need Dean, and Dean needed him even less. He tried to ignore the guys a few tables away who were looking over at them.
For the summer, Cas and Dean planned to fly to America to accept the offer from his father. America sounded good, sounded like a good activity. To travel with Cas sounded like a wonderful summer activity.
"Thank you, again." Dean broke the silence, because he couldn't stand it anymore. Cas instantly knew what he meant because he smiled gently at Dean.
"I don't know about you, but I've got time." Dean put his right foot on the table and rested his chin on his knee. Castiel laughed again and looked at Dean, whereupon Dean actually managed to give him a slight smile.
"Mushrooms." He replied and Dean looked at him with wide eyes. He felt like he was completely sober again, starring at the (still) gross bag. "You in?"
At 2:00am Sam and Dean shared a shitty air mattress. They decided that as long as they had nothing, they could live together in a room. Actually, it was Sam's idea. He said he didn't want tob e alone. Partly Dean believed him, but another part knew that he just wanted to make sure that Dean wouldn't run away. But that didn't bother him. Dean didn't want to be alone either.
Has anyone fallen asleep watching TV? Did someone have a baby that couldn't sleep at night? Game night? Sleepover? And the most important question, who of them had sex?
"I could help you if you let me." Cas said.
"Are you scared?" Cas asked softly at some point and looked into Dean's eyes. For a while, Dean just looked at him, sinking into his eyes, hoping he could say no, but couldn't in the end. So Dean started to nod.
"No idea. I'm sure he doesn't know them all." He laughed and Dean would have kissed him, if they wouldn't be at a party with too many drunk teenagers.
Dean was sure that their father knew what game they were playing. They were obvious. Of course they were, they were kids.
"No." Dean answered and felt Sam's astonished look. Dean didn't look over, instead just stared down into their small garden. "It's bad everywhere."
"I can't talk about it." Dean tried to explain.
"It has nothing to do with you."
Dean texted back.
Sam kept turning to the window to make sure the light wasn't turning on in the house. Dean recognized the concern on Sam's face, the question burning on his tongue. At some point, Sam could no longer take his eyes off the window. Dean was briefly unsure if Sam had tears in his eyes, but was later sure it was just fatigue.
After a while Castiel stopped and Dean noticed it of course. Actually Dean wanted to keep going further, just leave him there, knowing that he was looking for a conversation. A conversation Dean never wanted to have. But Castiel was a friend, wasn't he? He could become one. Dean needed a friend, he couldn't lie about that.
But here and now, on this rooftop somewhere in Iowa, it felt okay. For a few minutes, maybe even hours, it was okay. As if nothing bad ever happened to them, as if Dean didn't hate this house, as if it was possible that everything would turn out fine.
The later it got, the more nervous Dean became. The nervousness almost took over me as we walked upstairs to his room.
The summer heat hit him and so he rolled up the sleeves of his sweatshirt. The poor boy didn't want it, but it was like an accident - he just stared at it. Red and white stripes on both arms. Some were fresh, some old. Dean squinted, shook his head briefly and pulled his sleeves down again.
"My dad is there. He didn't want me to stay there and at the same time he didn't want me to stay home alone, because I am fucking crazy. Sam is there getting his stomach pumped out and I'm sitting here. Once I'm the halfway normal one." Dean laughed bitterly and ran his fingers through his hair.
"You're weird, to be honest. And we've always noticed that, but we don't care. You're cool, I like you." He said at some point. "But honestly dude, if you need anything, I don't know. We are friends, okay?"
Suddenly Dean noticed someone sitting next to him and looked up.
He always felt bad.
Dean fixed the steering wheel.
"Pizza would be cool." Dean said after a while and John nodded, a slight, maybe even proud, smile on his lips.
"Someday."
"Dean." John interrupted and Dean stopped instantly. He pressed his lips together and after that he took a deep breath.
And yes, it was fucking disgusting. It tasted like shit and the consistency was gross too. Actually, Dean was really close to vomit, but that wouldn't fulfill the purpose.
He wanted some luck.
Guilt.
Dean wouldn't have a problem staying with Cas in this bubble forever.
"Okay, I have to get rid of this now." Dean started. "I really want this, and I don't want to mess it up. I'm really fucked up and I know that. I think everyone knows that. I mean, you can ask my dad, but I think you know that on your own. And I don't know if I'm going to be normal someday, I can't promise or give you anything, absolutely nothing. But if I know one it's that I'll do anything to make this work-"
"I found her."
Maybe it knew all the answers to Dean questions. It was so high above, seeing everything and maybe it knew. But it wouldn't tell Dean, nor anyone else.
Dean saw the gleam in Sam's eyesand thought 'Damn he is just a kid' and a short time later, Dean found himself happily watching the play of colors. Perhaps this was the moment when Dean realized that he himself was still just a kid.
"At home. Cas stayed with him." Oh shit, Cas. "Do you want to see him?"
They rapidly became part of each other's life. Dean wanted to be part of Cas' life, but he didn't want Cas to be part of his. Dean didn't want Cas to come into his nasty, dark world. Dean just wanted to be in his light, bright universe.
"See?" Cas said, breaking the hug. "If you're driving on the main street, everything is labeled. If not, google maps and there's a city map hanging around somewhere, maybe twenty minutes by bike."
Mention of Selfharm, be careful.
"Cas." That shouldn't happen. Their morning after that shouldn't be like this.
This was weird wasn't it? He had known the guy for just a few weeks and now he was here because he didn't know where else to go. Because he trusted Cas. Because Cas was his friend.
"I didn't mean to wake you up." He heard Sam's voice and it broke his fucking heart. He had to explain himself and now he had to feel even more bad than he already did. The door was a bit open, so Dean could see Sam's silhouette and face.
When Sam was born, everything was still good, organized. A year ago everything was still good.
Dean felt like he could escape reality. His horrible, painful reality.
At some point, Cas put his hands on Dean's hips and Dean put his on Cas' upper arms. His bumps became more and more secure and harder until he hit that one particular spot that made Dean see stars. He groaned, feeling like he was going crazy, as if he was going to die if Cas didn't continue like that.
"It was a accident, it will never happen again." Dean said quietly, while he realized that he couldn't hold his leg still. John hadn't even said anything. Dean couldn't stand the silence, so he decided to start.
For a while, he just let his legs dangle in the air until he overcame himself to leave the car completely. The floor felt different. It smelled different. Not like fun and luck. Candy and hot milk. More like grief. Like dirt.
"Time." Dean lied. "Give me some time."
Everything went normal. No one asked stupid questions. Castiel had apparently told the boys that Dean had simply been sick. So Dean just told everyone now that he felt better, thanks for asking. Cas hadn't said a word about what was really going on.
It smelled lovely. Like home. Not Kansas, not that home. Like a new one.
"I don't wanna go into this house." Dean explained and Sam nodded knowingly.
"What? why?" Dean asked confused and in shock. It just popped out of him and he quickly tried to correct myself. "You don't have to say it when-"
God, why did he eat these fucking gross ass mushrooms? That was one of the stupidest things he's ever done in his entire life. He hadn't been as angry as he was last night for while now. Maybe he have never been as angry as he was last night.
"But he's okay, remember? You can see him tomorrow, and then everything will be fine."
"Do you wanna come to my place later?" Cas asked, almost uncertainly, and Dean couldn't help grinning.
"What's that?" Dean asked, his face twisted. The contents of the bag looked really gross.
His father said something, but Dean didn't listen. He couldn't and he didn't want to know. Dean was too tired to worry about his father seeing him like this.
And there was this sudden realisation, that Cas had a monster too. His grandma looked up and her eyes met Dean's briefly before turning back to the pancake.
Slowly he left Cas' room and made his way downstairs. He ran past the kitchen and was stopped by Cas' grandma.
But Dean didn't react and Cas didn't know if this was a good sign or not. So he waited.
Thanks to everyone who read this story!
Cas stopped talking and Dean's mouth was slightly open. He wanted to say something so bad, but what the fuck was he supposed to say?
It was a stupid idea to distract him like that, but Cas was confused and didn't know what else to do. Also he used to be like that too, but unlike Dean, it had worked for him. Nothing seemed to work for Dean. Even after a few minutes, he wasn't hard, which otherwise happened relatively quickly.
That he should have known when he left the house in the morning. He should have seen that there was something different about her. That she was calmer than usual. That she was sad. That her eyes didn't smile. But he didn't.
Dean started to shake his head. He wanted to take everything apart, but he wasn't alone. He wanted to take the whole world apart, including himself. For a moment he was angry that he was not ran down on the way here. Why was his fate so fucking cruel that it just wouldn't let him die?
His first intuition was to tell him that she wouldn't understand. But then Dean realized that he couldn't say that anymore, because he could understand it. Sam was in the hospital, overdose, because he wanted it to stop for a second. He understood it and in some way they both were equally fucked up. And Dean hated it.
Sam hadn't asked him on the way home. Dean had asked him how his first day of high school was and Sam was so busy with himself that he probably forgot about Dean completely. Honestly, Dean was happy about that. Sam was thinking too much about Dean that it actually relieved him that his little brother was completely preoccupied with himself for a moment. Sam talked and talked and Dean listened.
For a while they sat there and didn't say anything until Dean broke the silence.
And for an eternity Dean just cried and clawed into Cas' arm until he finally stopped. Then he laid down and instructed Cas to lay next to him. Dean snuggled up to Cas. Cas held him tight and he fell asleep.
"My ex?" Cas asked a little confused and Dean nodded cautiously. "He was good. We just lived apart, it wasn't a dramatic breakup."
"Why?" Dean asked at some point.
Just before Cas' house, Dean saw that he was already sitting on the stairs. They smiled at each other and Cas stood up. They hugged each other for a short time and then walked off together. Both of them didn't say much, just enjoyed the other's presence.
Castiel walked  looking at some pictures where Dean looked a thousand times healthier than now. He wondered what Dean's mom looked like. There was nothing anywhere that showed anything of his mother. No pictures with her on it. No family photos.
It almost broke Dean's heart that Castiel tried so hard. Dean wondered how anyone could care so much about a stranger. This dude was definitely a guy who had to take care of everything and everyone. As if he had some kind of helper syndrome and he would burst if Dean wouldn't agree. Castiel almost begged Dean with his eyes.
"How does Gabe know them all?" Dean asked as he looked around the room and Cas just shrugged.
Dean suppressed his need to roll his eyes and just kept staring. He wasn't interested in who was talking about him. Girls didn't interest him either. But that guy in front of him-
The weather was warm, not hot. There was a light breeze that smelled like summer flowers. The sky was covered with a few clouds.
Cas was with Dean all the time. He also didn't allow Dean to cut himself off and get back into the same situation where he just laid in bed and didn't want to see or hear anyone. Where he was just in pain, where it got so bad that he just got numb or couldn't move at all. Dean didn'T want to go back either.
"Just leave me alone, holy fuck Cas!" Dean screamed and turned abruptly and Cas stopped dead. He was like a dog.
"I'll let you forget that you're scared. I will make you forget everything."
Cas just hoped that Dean was okay. Dean should take all the time he needs and Cas would wait, because he loved him.
"Do you think we should keep all of this to ourselves first?" Cas asked after a while and Dean swallowed hard but started to nod.
"Sometimes."
"Jesus Christ, Dean. Of course, I don't hate you!" John said instantly and in that moment Dean's heart begun to hurt more than anything else.
"We can't, Dean, you know that." Finally Sam looked at him. Two broken boys, in their favorite car, in the middle of a street, somewhere in Iowa.
"He's so different with you." His grandma said but didn't look up. "In a good way. I remember back when he first moved here, poor kid, he was just a mess."
"It's okay, Dean. It's okay, you're okay." Sam said and Dean was trying hard not to cry again. He was sure that Sam was already crying a little, so he tried to hold himself together.
"Some guy? Dean, you can't just-"
"Then I come to you." Dean said while he started to feel numb.
"Maybe you just didn't match well with him. I read that many had to try several therapies to find the right one. It depends a lot on the therapist."
"Bad." Sam said and Dean nodded understandingly. He had expected nothing else. "I don't know how the hell this could happen. I would never, really never-"
"Don't lie to me." he said quietly and turned around. He sounded a bit annoyed and somehow Dean could understand it. But he didn't want that. Not now. Never. Everyone could be against him, but not him, not Sam. Dean didn't move and didn't have the motivation to argue because he would lose anyway.
"Dean..."
"It's your mom, isn't it?" Cas asked carefully and Dean started to nod, kinda glad that he didn'T need to find a start to the topic. "I figured. I mean, you never really talk about her, you run away from that topic."
"No, sit wherever you want." Dean said, confused. He didn't want to care where this guy was sitting. He generally didn't care about the guy. So Dean just kept eating, trying to ignore the others presence.
But he didn't let it get the better of him at that moment.
"What? But-"
I hope you like it, thanks for reading! Also wanted to thank the few people who commented already and to the ones that left kudos. Thank you all!
Dean almost ran into the building. He went into the elevator, pushed the button and drove up.  Dean tried to remain calm, to take several quiet breaths, but he couldn't suppress the twitching of his hands. His father had sent him the number for the room. When the elevator door opened, he ran almost as if he was running out of time. Despite the fact that all the hospitals were a labyrint, Dean found the room pretty fast.
It smelled like life.
He didn't want that. He didn't want this to be his life. All the pain and suffering. The constant tension in this house. All the tears and all the blood.
It couldn't be here, he had sworn to himself that his home would stay in Kansas, where everything was beautiful. Where she was.
Dean sat up slowly. When he looked up to see the others, he only noticed Castiel staring at him. Dean swallowed hard, because he knew he had seen it. He saw it in his eyes.
Dean couldn't even handle himself, but what else was he supposed to do. He couldn't leave himself, he was stuck here.
"Some time ago." Dean mumbled.
"Your hands are shaking." Castiel replied and Dean looked up for a moment, looking into blue, almost worried eyes, until his gaze turned to his hands, which were lying on the table. He discovered that they were indeed trembling slightly.
"Seriously?" Dean asked in suprise.
So they spent Christmas separately or on the phone. Dean and Cas would re-celebrate it, somehow, together.
, Dean thought, while tears were streaming down his face.
"How loud is it in your head right now?" Cas asked after a while and Dean remembered the conversation that they had once. Where they were honest and Dean told Cas, why he did the things he sometimes did.
For a moment, Dean and Cas  just looked at each other. Dean thought about just chasing him away, but decided against it. Instead he gestured Cas to followe him.
"Dean..." That's a bad idea, a really bad idea and Cas knew it.
Both stared at the ceiling again, shoulders lightly touching.
His father nodded, didn't really care where Dean would spent the night. The first time after maybe a year, that John trusted Dean.
"Not really." he answered simply before he looked at his desk again.
At the end of the evening they were both just sad and tired. Castiel's grandma had asked them if they wanted to eat anything and both of them denied.
Dean wanted Sam to just let it out now while he was there. He didn't want it to happen sometime in the middle of the night when everything was much darker and lonelier than it already was.
Cas dropped beside him and smiled with narrowed eyes. His hair was messy, stood in all directions, though it looked as though he had tried several times to tame them.
"Oh, shut up!" Sam slapped his shoulder and laughed too.
Sam had asked that only once before. At the very beginning, eight months ago when he saw it for the first time. Dean had shouted at him that his brother had never dared to try again. At that time, Dean was more sensitive than he was now.
His father had called him into the dining room, whereupon Dean fell down on a chair, exhausted. He didn't want to have this conversation, thought about how he could run away from it.
"Why not? It's the truth, isn't it?" Dean shrugged. Why do people always apologize for the painful truth? Why can't they stand with what they said? Why was everyone threating Dean like he was made of glass?
Sam came running up to Dean and asked what was going on, but Dean couldn't answer. For amoment he wasn't sure if he was real. Or Sam. Or the life they had a few hours ago.
"You can't always take care of him. He took drugs many times before."
"I thought we were talking about it. I thought you'd come to me when it got so bad, fuck, Dean."
"To people like us?" Sam looked up, with a tiny frown, but Dean ignored his gaze skillfully. Dean sighed and ate another spoon of his cereal.
Sam didn't say anything, gently stroked Dean's shoulder while he was still trying to hold back his tears. Dean didn't want to cry anymore, not in this house. For a while, none of them said anything until he realized that his heartbeat had normalized.
They both were hard. Cas massaged Dean's middle and suddenly he wanted him as much as Dean never wanted anything before.
"You know what's the worst thing? Back the I thought that she knew that I would find her. She had to know. Did she want me to find her? Why should she have done that to me?" Dean explained and Cas swallowed. "But now I know that she probably didn't think anything at all."
"I like you too." Dean decided to say after a while, and in fact, Cas smiled at him.
Cas swallowed hard and burried himself into the couch. At that moment, Cas just hoped he'd be better in a few days.
And a few seconds later, Cas was sitting in front of him, stealing pancakes, while our knies briefly touched.
Cas pressed his hard middle against Dean's and a moan left them and for a second Dean's brain stopped thinking and he wanted him to do it again. Dean thought that Cas could do anything to him if it meant that he would stop thinking. All Dean wanted to know and feel is just Cas, him, his lover and everything the dark haired boy did to him. Dean wanted Castiel to be the only thing he would think about.
"Now the truth, please." Dean said with an eyebrow raise. Sam frowned and Dean realized that he didn't want to talk.
"Do I have to explain it to you again? I've already canceled the last time. I fucking hated it. Why should I start again?"
"Babe?" Cas asked quietly after closing the door. Quiet, he had to be quiet, because it had to be fucking loud in the older ones head. Cas knew it, it was disgusting. The worst feeling of all. Because nobody knows how loud it is, so nobody pays attention. He tried to be considerate.
He didn't even go to the house to get some things. Dean couldn't give less of a fuck how he looked like right now. Dean was scared.
Dean slept on the couch, Cas on the bed. For a few moments Dean thought about how it would be to lay in his bed together. He was crushing hard on Cas and he didn't even try to deny it or delete this thought.
"I don't give a shit what people think about you. For me you are the most beautiful boy in the world." Dean rolled his eyes. How did he deserve him? "We could have sex in the ocean."
He sat down at the table with the full plate and started to eat. Dean watched her turn the pancakes in the pan and it reminded him of how he had tried then and always failed miserably.
Dean rolled around in his bed and had an incredible need to shout. Maybe he wanted his heart to break. Actually, it was already broken. He just kept gluing it back together, because what else was he supposed to do?
Cas' dad wouldn't make it to Christmas. He had promised him that he would come to New Year's Eve, no matter what would happen. And he really wanted to get to know Dean, at least Cas had told him so with a sad smile.
"Calm down, no stress before you know what's going on." Cas tried to calm him down. "I know the hospital sounds bad, but it's probably okay."
"Come on! Tell me something about him. Is he the annoying little sibling everyone has? Except me, thank God."
Dean slowly remembered what happened a few hours ago and he could feel that his brain tried to forget it.
He really didn't care, why did his body care? Why did his body always do what it shouldn't do?
"You're there, right?" Dean asked with a cheeky grin and kissed him briefly. Cas sighed lightly, but then nodded.
"No." Dean replied directly, bluntly and for a moment the person in front of him was taken aback, before he started to laugh. It was a guy, dark hair, blue eyes, slight smile.
They didn't talk much, as if they were trying to process what was happening. After a while they shared a cigarette again.
Cas had picked Dean up at his house this afternoon. They had walked here together, had set up the tent and sat now, with a can of beer in hand, in the meadow and start down the field in the village. They had a few cans of beer, that Cas had stolen from his grandpa, and cigarettes.
For a while, they just sat there and smoked a cigarette together. Dean offered him one, but Cas didn't want it. He said if he smoked a whole on his own, that would be too extreme. Dean just laughed about it, but he got him.
"You spend a lot of time with Cas." he started and Dean took a sip from his cup. "I like him."
, Dean heard the voice of his dad. It was all in his head and he hated it so much. Because that's exactly what he had in mind.
But Dean hadn't painted the room or changed anything else. He didn't even have curtains. He even made it difficult for himself to put his clothes in the closet.
And in that moment he realized that Sam was right. Cas would be good for him. But Dean couldn't give him anything, absolutely nothing. And he was afraid of that.
"Have managed to live with it." Castiel shrugged.
"Sammy, it's okay. Let him in." Dean interrupted his brother before he could continue his lie. Cas  watched Dean as he slowly struggled to the door. Sam looked confused, but said nothing. Dean indicated with a nod of his head that Sam should leave, which he did with a sigh.
Dean sat with his little brother all day. Also with his dad.
"How exciting." Dean chuckled and Cas joined in.
In fact, it didn't take Dean much to fall asleep. Actually, he had expected his thoughts to keep him mercilessly awake, but his brain spared him for one night. He fell asleep within a few minutes.
For a second, he wondered how the hell that happened, but Dean knew it: He has opened this one book from his desk, sat on his bed with it, and put the blade that was hidden in there on his arm. After that everything went really fast.
"Come on." his father finally said and turned around. Dean followed him immediately.
Cas got it.
"Where did you get a punching bag?" Sam asked.
Dean had been in the hospital for exactly one day. In the evening he felt so good that he could eat something and Cas even had to pull a candy bar out of the machine because Dean really wanted something sweet. Unfortunately Cas had to go in the evening.
What if he left Dean as lonely as he was in the beginning?
"That's in the next village. Dean, you can't walk home!" Cas said.
That was new. Dean closed his eyes for a few seconds, touched because his father was trying too hard. Dean was so against it and fought it. John tried new methods, new weapons, but Dean evaded each one.
"I've never brought anyone here." Cas said quietly, almost inaudibly.
Even now. When Dean woke up, the room was dark, but he wasn't alone.
It was like a stupid high school movie where you had fun as a student. Maybe Dean was just in the wrong movie. It was too good, way too good. His life felt like a thriller most of the time, actually all the time, and suddenly he found himself in a teen rom-com.
"Yeah, you did." he said quietly, pulling his legs up. Dean held his breath, frowned and looked up. "But I know it wasn't meant to be mean."
"Sam is in the hospital." John said fast and Dean swallowed hard.
As they passed Dean's room, he stopped abruptly. His father had certainly been there and... cleaned up. The simple thought of that made Dean sick. Dean didn't want to, but he needed to know. He slowly opened his door and thus found out that he was right. He couldn't imagine how his dad had coped.
Nobody realized that Dean had left the house and he felt like it was for the best. Sam hadn't come home all day, but had done something with his friends. At least that's what he texted Dean.
They hadn't moved since we sat down and Dean was afraid to move because he thought that he would just fall apart. For some reason Dean though Cas was afraid of the same thing.
"But." Cas started and Dean knew what he was about to say. "I can't just put my hand in your pants here, you know?"
