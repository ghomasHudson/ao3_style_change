Used to just brushing over terminology he didn’t quite understand the point of, John resigned himself to this sweet gesture that Sherlock wanted to make and agreed. “Those are perfect then. I’m sure my mother will appreciate it.”
“I said no ambulance.” Sherlock said between sharp intakes of breath at what John was certain were phantom cramps, as they had never had such a problem before and there were other parts of his pelvic region that were intermittently affected by numbness and over sensitivity. The trouble was, phantom cramps decided when to come and go according to their own whims, leaving Sherlock to suffer their wrath. “Two then. I’ll take two.”
“John?” Sherlock’s voice rang ojt though the sitting room door, and John heard the relief mix with a twinge of pain. Bugger! He needed his medication.
“Honestly John, this is a monumental choice that will be remembered for the rest of our families lives, the least you could do is not force me to make the final decision by myself.” Sherlock said, the anxiety evident in his voice.
He looked to where the page was open on his phone and listed them off. “-three weeks from Saturday at noon is the prime slot and would be easiest for everyone to accommodate schedule wise. Mycroft should be in Britain, if not London.”
“Worth a shot, right?” John shrugged but held his husband tightly just to remind himself that Sherlock was still there. Down- oh so very down- but not gone. He hated that that had become a very real possibility, Sherlock’s black mood turning against him and taking him away from John for good. But in the warmth of the man curled around him, John kept his hope. “Just check. You’ve found a few decent ones over the years.”
For a time after becoming romantically involved with Sherlock, John Watson worried that he might have become a vain man. What else was there to call it when John took even more pleasure in watching Sherlock struggle to swallow down John’s cock than he took in the physical sensation’s of such a deft tongue? Taking pride in being too much for the man that otherwise could manipulate the world to his will?
“If you’d eat, I’d order cheese from the moon if I had to.” Again, his lips found Sherlock’s curls and he inhaled the scent of antiseptic and the hospital shampoo that had been used to clean the sick from his hair. He smelled wrong, but John was too grateful to have him beside him in bed
Their daughter’s laughs died down almost instantly and she narrowed her eyes and pursed her lips while analyzing John. If she had taken the time to tent her fingers, she would have looked just like their brilliant detective.
John hated Sherlock’s younger cousin, even though he was usually polite enough to deny it. Typically, when questioned, his answer would involve something along the lines of Winifred being a particularly overgrown troubled youth. This ignored the fact that she was a multi millionaire who was the majority shareholder and biometric engineer of the company their Grandmother left behind. People always left that part out.
“It’s lunch, John. You’ll have your little-“ humiliating “-care plan meeting with Mycroft and Lestrade, and Winifred and I will get something to eat.” Sherlock protested, and crossed his arms. His wrist twinged, the nerves still smarting from where the surgeons put in the screws and plate to repair the repeatedly broken bones. “What on earth could possibly happen over sandwiches and coffee?”
It was a great medication for Sherlock, even if it didn’t, and John recognized that. As a nerve pain medication and a mood stabilizer, controlling the seizures might as well be the cherry on top. Unfortunately, no amount of it could stave off what had been a long time coming, which was a stronger drug.
In half a beat, his blood that had been warmed by his daughter’s smile ran cold. “Sherlock? Sherlock?!” John yelled back, then heard the creaking of a long detective turning over on well loved sofa springs. “What’s wrong?”
“Is it possible that, at some point, you could go back to the clinic on a locum like basis? Only say yes on days you feel comfortable leaving, perhaps? Would that make it easier to accept the money to allow you to stay home to care for Sherlock, knowing that it is at least partially temporary?”
Sherlock swished the remaining third of tea around in his mug, eyes locked on the way it swirled around to almost the rim of the cup but never over. John wondered absently if Sherlock did it because it was one of the last things left he could control. “We used to have sex every night.”
“Fine, an obnoxiously sized frame with the smallest lock of hair.” Sherlock said with a smile. Being given encouragement by John to be rude was one of his favorite things.
Mycroft sighed. “They have professionals on staff that can check in with him during the day when you’re gone, dispense and administer his medications and arrange the proper therapies to manage his condition. If you would consider seeing reason for one moment I’m sure you’d come to the conclusion that this is the only option.”
Sherlock stood, his clenched jaw being the only sign that he was deeply struggling and John noted the placement of his hand when he stretched as well as the slightly hesitant steps towards the bathroom. His upper and mid back was giving him trouble and his legs were pins and needles from the mid thigh down, this much John could deduce on his own.
Sherlock’s lips pursed with hesitance, “I believe our daughter arrived at the correct treatment for my injury but was unable to reach the freezer due to being vertically challenged. Could I get that ice, John? This headache is unbearable. A nap and some quiet would do quite well, actually.”
... in front of two officers. It’s not as if they can just turn a blind eye to that without it compromising all ethical boundaries. Doesn’t matter that you’re all friends.”
John looked at first of the objects skeptically, not sure what he was even looking at. “A camera tripod?”
Mycroft looked up at him, and only then did John realize that he actually had stood up and was looming over Mycroft as if he was dealing with an insubordinate underling in the army. “Whatever accommodations I feel have the potential to help?”
“Don’t discount them before you’ve even heard their capabilities.” Mycroft pressed on, appearing far more pleased with himself than anyone should have been after leaving their brother in the state he had been in and making no effort to help. “The JWILU001s are a reinvention of the wheel, no pun intended. They really are quite extraordinary. Little brother, if you might do the honors.”
John didn’t know how to walk in the new braces, and clearly it would be a far cry from his current ones, which left John to try not to look down despite the feeling that he was about to fall at any moment. He wouldn’t, he reminded himself, as long as he didn’t let himself startle. Instead, free hand lifting in front of him, he marveled at the fact that he could theoretically do something while standing. Should he have been ten feet forward, he could have picked a book off of Sherlock’s shelf, as all of his had been moved to the bottom two. In the kitchen he could have, very slowly, made himself a cuppa using Sherlock’s counter top.
She wrote it down and Sherlock glared at him but made no move to pull away. Slowly, his clenched fist was relaxing and John hoped that meant the pain was giving way to the workings of John’s fingers instead of increasing it until numbness took over. He didn’t get a chance to ask before Doctor Fletcher continued.
“Mhm,” His husband mumbled, then gasped and further curled in on himself until he was almost entirely wrapped into a compact ball of limbs, ribs and a spine. “Don’t. Call. Anyone.”
John brushed back his curls, which were suddenly so damp with sweat that John would have sworn he had just taken a shower and forgotten to so much as ring it out over the tub. “Sherlock, I have to, love. If you’re in this much pain then you need to be seen by an A&E doctor and I have to call Doctor Fletcher to meet us there. Something isn’t right. I need to make sure you’re not actually injured.”
The doctor sighed and ran his fingers through his unkempt hair. “You do know- Greg, you need to understand that I don’t blame you for anything. For how he is now. Jesus, I’m grateful he walked away with his life.”
When it came to work, he was happily Doctor Watson- he had been the one to go to medical school and serve his country, damn it all- but when it came to Sherlock’s appointments with Doctor Fletcher and hospital stays, he had elected to go by Doctor Holmes. In those moments, he wanted to make it clear to everyone in the room that their beautiful patient was
“Rosamund, would you care to see Lovey’s new art?” Sherlock called out, snapping their daughter out of her attempts to memorize the circulatory system with her fingertips while her eyes were tightly pinched shut.
Erica shrugged. “You were in the army for three years before being shot nearly a decade ago. There are men walking around today that never would have survived without your fast thinking and experience. Sherlock has been working with New Scotland Yard for thirteen years. Because of him, hundreds of violent offenders are behind bars and their victims’ families can have that peace. Is an injury received in that pursuit any less deserving of compensation than your own?”
. It also turned out that perhaps Sherlock wasn’t as impervious to sentiment as he previously believed. But Sherlock wouldn’t know that until Donovan dragged him back home, having been sent out to fetch him like an annoyed and overpaid errand girl, and by then it was too late.
“-shock the pants off of me if there’s a problem, yeah I gathered as much.” He grunted, trying to overcome the disorienting sensation that he was hanging three feet off the ground by where his arms were wrapped around Sherlock’s neck. “Wait, what was that sound?”
is the reason that people abuse their medications. The pills make them feel better than their lives do.” Doctor Fletcher told them, and poked Sherlock in the shoulder roughly. “Quit the act, Holmes, I knew you were awake the minute I walked in the room. How is your pain? The
It didn’t seem to bother him that Rosie had Mary’s laugh or that it took twenty minutes to comb through Rosie’s hair in a way that kept both her curls and her tears in her head. And God, did John not owe Sherlock a lifetime of joy he was unlikely ever going to be able to give him even if they both lived to one hundred and twelve? After all he had taken, John should have stripped his own happiness like tearing muscle from bone despite the unbearable pain. He had caused enough of it.
Doctor Carlisle pursed her lips and cocked her head, and he could tell she was pointedly ignoring the second statement. Maybe because it wasn’t relevant, or maybe because his family didn’t raise him to be an honorable kind of man at all.
, Sherlock. Every day.” John said, as if Sherlock himself wasn’t the one with tiny knives scraping his bones and brutally electrified nerves. “Bloody hell, you nearly died of an infection. Rosie and I almost lost you. I was going to have to tell her that her father died. Do you have any idea what that felt like?!”
John kicked himself for the thought. It was the effort Sherlock was spending on breathing and on waking up every day.
So John headed towards the tube station, racking his brain for an answer that wouldn’t leave him looking like an idiot coming home with his tail between his legs, until he determined it was unavoidable. No matter what he brought, the shame would remain.
The woman did not offer condolences that she knew were unwelcome. “How has the pain affected sleep?”
“It’s getting late. I’m tired and figured you would be as well after the brutal day we had. I’ve got to be up early tomorrow.”
had infuriated Sherlock enough to demand a transfer back to NHS on the second day, and Doctor Fletcher had been happy to go back with him.
“Now Rosie, that isn’t very funny at all. Tell me, why did you kick Lovey?” The doctor asked sternly, now itching to conduct his own examination at the first opportunity. “You know he has ouches. Why did you give him more?”
Phillip Anderson let it go, speaking onwards as if he also was wasting time on the conversation but felt it unavoidable. “I’m not sure what the gay decorum is-“ John nearly laughed aloud at that one, rarely knowing himself if he was being honest. “but I know dealing with a ticked off spouse after doing something rotten. Get him whatever the Sherlock equivalent of flowers and chocolates is before you go home. Make it good, and you’ll both get past this, whatever it is.”
John groaned and rubbed his eyes. “Are you telling me that you entered me in this- this study without asking me?”
When they reached Baker St and he had walked her back in, delivering her to the door of her flat with a peck on the cheek, John did his best to put the conversation out of his mind. It was not as if the two of them had lost any love for one another. If anything, the fact that Sherlock allowed him to be part of acts as invasive as helping him into the bathtub was proof that there was no shortage of intimacy in their lives. As far as John was concerned, he had never loved anyone so much.
“Eat, go on.” Sherlock pointed towards the dish that John had filled with the measured amount of the food that his husband had made himself. The experiment he and Rosie were doing kept his spirits up and John wasn’t going to argue, even if it had involved taking in stray cats that Rosie had encountered in Mrs Hudson’s small garden. “Shall we be going then? And did you remember to text my brother to uninvite him to accompany us?”
Confident that there was very little the british government would not be able to do, especially armed with the knowledge of how much the old woman did for his brother, John put the phone away with a satisfied smirk and continued listening to Mrs Hudson narrating their way through the inner circle.
John stopped, his feet frozen to the pavement for half a second before he forced himself to continue walking. “Defeat?”
One gorgeous eye opened to make it clear, with only a brief look, that John was an idiot. “Child proof? Yes. Rosie proof? Not even close.”
Looking to Sherlock’s hands, John made sure that his husband could move his fingers if he wished to, and bent down to kiss and lick the new tears that were pushing their way through his lids and onto his cheeks, unable to be contained by just one path to fall. “Are these for me, love? Are your stunning eyes crying such beautiful tears just for me? Could I ever be that lucky?”
“Mr Holmes- No, Sherlock. You are Sherlock and I am Fletch right now.” She stuttered a bit but set her jaw with an equal amount of resolve. “Quite frankly, you don’t have much of a fucking choice. Either you do this and return to some sense of normalcy that will give you at least part of your life back, or you will be facing a degree of disability that will continue to increase in severity with every collapse on the steps. If I’ve gotten to know you at all since you were first in the hospital after your accident, and if you lose any more of who you are, you will much rather be dead. You’ve continued to think about it and do not lie to me, to your husband or to yourself and say you haven’t.”
The British Government even allowed himself a chuckle. “I’m afraid I prefer my desserts to be of a higher quality.”
The space had become theirs as Rosie’s clothes and toys had migrated into what quickly became the family bedroom, and John felt no remorse for that fact. A married couple needed space to do married things. If those married things involved John choking Sherlock on his cock then refusing to let him come while he fucked him with more energy than he had to spare, that was simply what would have to happen.
“The physical therapists had nothing to offer me before and I don’t believe that their field could have advanced too terribly much in a matter of months. I also have absolutely no interest in revisiting the lovely rehabilitation facilities of the NHS for detox and treatment when I inevitably turn back to heroin and cocaine soon after. I’m not doing it and that is final.”
The scratching of her pen was all the sound in the room for a while besides the white noise machine tucked next to the door to the waiting area. It seemed louder than their at home, and he felt a twinge of shame upon realizing that Erica’s model had a dial and for John’s session she had cranked it up as high as it would go. Even after time away, she knew how these appointments tended to go.
The handkerchief embroidered with his initials to tuck into her bouquet for her wedding day, easily accessible when the tears came?
John was also grateful that it was Mycroft who, in the end, broached their silence. “Would it be fair to assume that Sherlock’s neurologist was not pleased with his progress? It does appear to me that someone wouldn’t need a medical degree to realize his ability to function has decreased as his pain has become more severe.”
The burning skin on his face was second only to the fact that someone was now actually yelling and he was no longer sitting and the person who was yelling was him because where the hell did she get off saying that?!
“Don’t be ridiculous, John. These were produced in the states and as you know I haven’t taken any leisurely trips outside of the country without you since your accident.” He pointed out, looking at John’s feet. “Now, you’re only supposed to stand in them for the first seven days so here is your cane- yes I can see the irony too, no need for that expression. Unless of course you want to put on trousers so Angelo can come over and hand it to you.”
Despite it all, John could not help but feel like the luckiest man in the world for having Sherlock’s hand in his and their daughter between them while they rode to the specialist’s office that Doctor Fletcher had taken up residence in at St Bart’s. The beautiful man beside John was intelligent, brave, ridiculous, passionate and still fantastic in bed and John, a depressed doctor invalidated from the army, had somehow been given him.
“Morning, love.” John said hesitantly, setting the tray on the floor while Sherlock sat up. “How did you sleep?”
Ever since the accident, considering Sherlock’s pain levels from the day of, John had managed to bring down the walls of sexual stamina that he had spent years building as he earned the name of Three Continents Watson. With a few more gentle but expert thrusts he spent himself deep into the man he loved with declarations of that love and obscenities blending into one train of consciousness.
It was five hours later, long after Natasha had gone downstairs to surprise Mrs Hudson with the offer of a relaxation massage and Rosie was fast asleep, that John finally decided he was going to get up to start preparing the house for Sherlock to go to sleep. He had switched on the kettle for their last cups of tea, filled a plastic sippy for Rosie’s inevitable 1 AM demand for water, and was preparing to open the first of Sherlock’s medicine bottles before his husband’s head snapped up with fiery eyes.
John shook his head. “No, they won’t keep him very long once his pain is at a tolerable level. I can’t imagine we’ll be here for any longer than another couple of hours.” The last time they had been in the A&E for such an event, Mycroft had flown back from The Netherlands and the time before that, South Africa. There were reasons why John no longer attempted to bring Sherlock along to shop for groceries or ask him to ride the tube.
John leaned in close and pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s lips, which was rewarded with a smile that felt like heaven pressed against his skin. “Are you up for seeing Doctor Fletcher today?”
Sherlock placed the five electrodes on each side of his body, each wrapping around his ribs in a half circle. “Connection points one and five- front and back respectively- on each side are to alert you with a firm electrical pulse if you’re not maintaining proper form and points two through four indicate the position of your leg during each step with a light pulse.”
Sherlock was waiting beside the mirror, rocking onto his toes with excitement. “Are you alright? Comfortable?”
His knees nearly buckled when Sherlock’s tongue found the sensitive spot that only he had ever discovered. None of John’s past lovers had come close to reading his body like a novel to be devoured and there was something about Sherlock’s manipulative seduction that got the better of him. During a slightly drunken night with Lestrade where they had both gone into far too much detail of their love lives, his friend had called it
“Do you consider being a full-time parent and primary caregiver to a disabled spouse to be physically and mentally taxing?” She asked. “Or is it really as easy as you’re dismissing it to be?”
“You think? Sherlock is threatening to commit arson so we have to evacuate the holding cells.” Greg snorted. “He does remember I’m a detective inspector, right? That’s evidence right there.”
It was true. The last time his mother had seen Rosie in person was her christening, and the talk of visits for holidays and birthdays stopped abruptly upon John moving in and becoming romantically- read sexually- involved with Sherlock. But that didn’t mean he was going to deprive her of the small joys of birthday photographs and their family Christmas card, which he and Sherlock had an unspoken agreement needed to involve at least one photo with their wedding rings pointedly displayed and another of an embrace while they each kissed one side of Rosie’s face that did not imply they were any less than a real family.
The memories of Sherlock being this lover, a year ago that felt more like a hundred, got John rock hard in an instant and, oh fuck, John absolutely had to be inside him.f
The days of having a gorgeous genius in a long flowing coat on his arm were over and, while he had accepted it, the thought of going alone still tightened his throat and left his feet weighted to the front steps of Baker Street.
“A little,” Sherlock said sheepishly, continuing to connect the pads based on a diagram he was only occasionally referencing. “In any case, you’ll need to wear these underneath to minimize chafing but can then pull trousers over them and a shirt overtop the waist portion.”
The cool off period had consisted of being released from his cuffs soon after Sherlock shut himself in their bedroom, but still being escorted out to Greg’s squad car and brought back to The Yard for a lecture. A silent lecture, consisting of his friend’s- and Sally Donovan’s- judgmental looks. It was likely more
His older brother made no move nor spoke a single word to discourage Lestrade’s hold on John, or the words he was whispering harshly in his ear. Lestrade, obviously, paid Sherlock’s cries no mind.
“I don’t believe you have much of a choice.” Mycroft smirked. “These were made for you, and the grant funds have run out, meaning if you don’t-”
“This is ridiculous,” Sherlock griped, thankful that Rosie remained asleep though it was not lost on him that she was clutching John’s pillow in both of her tiny dimpled hands. “It’s only a tattoo, John doesn’t have to like them. I don’t see why you’re all so worked up about this.”
John let his hand drop, landing it on Sherlock’s quivering shoulder, and his expression softened minutely. His lips parted, either about to say something consoling or about to kiss him. That never came to be and suddenly John wasn’t there, and was instead pushed over the desk- over his own laptop and Rosie’s scrapbook- with cuffs being slapped onto his wrists.
. And he wouldn’t have needed nor would he have violated Sherlock’s trust to quantify it to someone else, so there was no need for an exact count.
“Because it isn’t true.” She said sympathetically. “You stopped both your lives when he was hurt, including the career as a doctor that you worked incredibly hard to become. With that, you’ve lost your method of bringing income into the household. The separation from your daughter for several weeks was incredibly stressful even if you did visit her.
When he heard the shower turn off, John quickly finished their morning’s dishes and wiped down the tray to stow out of sight. Sherlock hated the bloody tray.
In the end, he surrendered and they made the unusually slow way up to the third floor bedroom, John supporting a good portion of Sherlock’s weight but their lips and tongues battling with the same strength they always did.
(And if my phone could stop autocorrecting to the wrong spelling of accommodations, that would be great)
Despite being in their same old flat, John felt as pampered as someone staying at a spa. Well, as pampered as he imagined that would feel like. Both of their skin smelled delectably like perfumed oils and even Sherlock seemed to have enjoyed himself despite initially being annoyed by Mycroft’s interference. He had stubbornly insisted that he didn’t need the wheelchair and also rejected John’s cane. He instead had used one hand on the wall to support his heavy limp back to the kitchen where he microwaved his isn and Rosie's dinners. Eventually, Mycroft took his leave and Sherlock agreed to take his bath in anticipation of the masseuse's arrival.
John wouldn’t put them on in front of Mycroft, because honestly he expected to fall flat on his face and didn’t need that kind of humiliation in his life. Was he grateful that his brother in law had found something to pull Sherlock out of such a deep and dangerous depressive episode? Yes, absolutely. But did that absolve him of the responsibility to have answered the bloody phone when John called?
Slip ups like that were a reminder that Fletch was an American, and her American television accent hadn’t needed the help.
Watching Sherlock’s eyes, locked so firmly on their daughter who was currently tasting the digestive tract of a sea turtle, John shouldn’t have been surprised by what he said next.
temporary, that was the question on John’s mind as he took an opportunity to walk home, basking in the warm sun on his skin he missed far more than he’d realized. It wasn’t something he could do immediately, but the spark of hope that it might be possible someday- when they established some type of routine or found the proper cocktail of medication, put a small smile on his face and splinted his wounded pride.
“I’m talking about spending three days and nights straight soaking towels in ice water and draping them over you to try to keep fever from frying your brain.” John seethed, and reached up to poke at the side of Sherlock’s skull. The spot that, when John once described to Sherlock his nightmares, he said was typically where he could see inside Sherlock’s mind in the very literal sense of the expression.
Sherlock married him- a man who put his hands on Sherlock on more occasions than John knew he could recall, as it had become so normal both before and after the fall. He adopted John’s daughter that he’d had with a woman who shot him, who Sherlock also forgave without a second thought because he believed it was what was best for John. Damn it all, the man heard the words
“Yes we did.” John said stubbornly, and clapped his hands against his knees as he stood. “And I’m not having this conversation again.”
He did take the two tramadol offered, not suffering enough to justify morphine, and didn’t protest too terribly much when John helped him up only to guide him to the sofa.
reason to behave themselves. Something they couldn’t afford to lose, which meant they valued it far more than their own lives. Those were easily cast aside.
“Sounds like it will make me part of quite a scandal around the knitting circle.” She said, accepting his invitation. “Wait until Sherlock feels well enough, of course. I had Mrs Turner look up that doctor of his, Kathleen Fletcher, and she comes very well recommended. Did she have any suggestions as to what might help?”
A short call to Anthea for the first code of the day gave John access to Sherlock’s medication chest, and he counted out each of Sherlock’s prescriptions twice while the kettle boiled, tea was made for the second time and he waited for three pieces of toast to pop up. Two of them he buttered for himself and one was left dry for Sherlock, which was the only way it would be accepted, and John poured a glass of orange juice that he watered down by half, which was the only way Sherlock could stomach it. The plastic hospital-like tray that Mycroft gifted them with in the beginning was filled nearly to the brim by the time John took his final easy breath of the day before opening the bedroom door and meeting the pinched face of his husband.
“Seeing me in hospital must be the best part of your week,” Sherlock coughed off to one side and John patted his back, cautious since the pills hadn’t seemed to go down very easily.
Mycroft appeared offended. “I don’t see why you would believe I actually enjoy watching you suffer. Fail? At times, yes, but never suffer.”
Four months of the hell that was watching depression pull Sherlock under, deeper than ever before, and John was failing him. It wasn’t even a fair fight. The downturn was fast, it had felt like one night things were fine and then the next they weren’t, and John was unsure if it had really gone that way or if he was just that blinded by hope.
Emotions run high and decisions are made during an intimate moment that have profound repercussions.
“Effectively making myself a bloody camera tripod.” John grumbled, trying the positioning a couple of times until it felt less like he was seconds from hurtling toward the floor.
Sherlock’s smile was wide and bright, so much more so than he’d been for months, and John wondered if it was cruel letting him get any more worked up only for the inevitable disappointment. His hatred for the leg braces had softened over time into distaste and then just plain acceptance with a twinge of resentment but that didn’t mean he would enjoy using them. Not even if they were fancy, new and looked
The downside of Sherlock eating well- and God, John wouldn’t trade it back in a century- was the return of his energy. Not only had his pain been lessened by the recreational use, a mercy to them all, but he also hadn’t been restless, only alert and hyper focused. His mind was honed by the substances that Sherlock repeatedly told him quieted the whirling and spinning into one stream of fully powered thought. Driven. Ready for life’s challenges.
Before, one would not wake up Sherlock Holmes for anything less than house fire, but if John didn’t do so a far more sinister force would be upon them. It was not the fault of Moriarty or an enemy of Mycroft. Of all the criminal masterminds they had taken down, not a single one of them dictated the half life of morphine.
Wow, there really were a lot of things John could do that weren’t strictly necessary but their possibility was the point. The second and equally important point was… wow, Sherlock really had thought of everything when John was in rehab and the flat needed renovating. Things John didn’t fully appreciate them because so much was *needed*, but that didn’t truly make it any less thoughtful or a sign of love.
It was a risk. The morphine was already something he took reluctantly and had resisted John’s attempts to administer intravenously when he was in the worst of it. Stronger medications in the form of pills implied they were for more regular use and terrified them both.
“I’ve never once believed you had. That concept is of my brother’s invention and he alone deserves full credit.”
“I told Mrs Hudson not give Rosie any of that glorified candy and the cats any dairy. Their litter boxes already smell horribly enough as it is “ Sherlock took several steps towards the stairs then stopped himself, then turned back to John. “John, rattle their bowl. They’ll come back up and Rosie should follow.”
John awoke with a start before dawn, as he always did. The dream didn’t allow him to sleep past three or four in the morning, leaving plenty of time to shower, shave, brush his teeth, comb his hair, dress in the clothes he kept in the linen closet and stare at himself in the mirror with the hope that he would walk back into their flat and find out all of that night’s horror was contained to one disgusting dream.
The whole system was utterly ridiculous but he humored Sherlock by exchanging his pants for the thin cotton leggings that thankfully had a flap so he would still be able to use his intermittent catheter without taking the whole rig off. As he would one day uncomfortably soon need to keep them on for six hours at a time and needed to empty his bladder more often than that, it would be necessary.
John looked down to where Rosie was absolutely cheesing in his lap and raised a single eyebrow. “How did our Lovey get hurt?”
John’s eyes widened and his throat became almost too tight to breathe. His heart skipped a beat, and then started accelerating as if it intended to push its way out of his chest all together. The idea that Sherlock had the potential to become actively suicidal was always on their minds, but having Doctor Fletcher suggest he was already heading that way, again, was sobering. By the looks of it, Sherlock felt nearly the same as he did. Again, John took Sherlock’s hand and ran his thumb across the back of it in a repetitive pattern that he knew soothed the both of them at the most difficult moments.
As if answering John’s prayers, Doctor Fletcher turned the corner with her clipboard in hand that had every bit of information since the call to emergency services, including what John had told the doctors regarding the
“Got it.” His husband called out, the first time he had called out anything in months, not to mention that it was a call of victory. The lid was ajar, splintering at multiple points from where Sherlock tried and failed to open it, and soon it went clattering to the ground.
“I’m not going to say much of anything different than I did at your appointment. It’s important that we get his pain under control so he can move on with the rest of his life. Go back to running around the city the way you both do, conduct experiments on whatever Hooper claims made it to the crematory and go on a ruddy honeymoon for god’s sake. Raise your kid. Do
He groaned and reached for his own phone that he’d turned out the night before to conserve the half battery life left. “Shit- nothing. He really thinks you’re holding me for this.”
She frowned. “Except it is, because you married someone who’s part of that world. Someone who, like you, is now receiving payments out of an account set up by someone other than himself for an injury he sustained while serving Queen and Country. The only difference I see is who set up the account and the severity. I’d say a head injury as well as a bone fragment damaging the spinal cord is a fairly severe injury with more long lasting impacts. You were never in a wheelchair or bed bound beyond the first week or so in hospital, were you?”
“A three.” He answered, arms crossed in front of him around Rosie in a fashion that John knew was causing the pins and needles to return to his fingers and would only worsen the longer Sherlock held the pose. It wasn’t as if she lacked the balance to stay seated on her own as long as Sherlock resisted the urge to fidget.
“No, let me-“ He adjusted, imagining Sholto scolding him for even a slight slouch and felt for a moment like he was going to fall before a minute movement stabilized him once more. “There. Done yet?” John snipped.
“Let's try that. The massage therapist, I mean. How soon can you get one here?” He joked with a nearly humorless chuckle- considering that it brought to his mind how much pain it appeared Sherlock would be in when he woke up- and Mycroft pulled out his phone. John’s protests were willfully ignored and waved off with dismissal.
“Excellent choice, as always.” Sherlock said, still buttoning his jacket when he came into the kitchen and offered John another kiss. His steps were more sure than before and John was happy the pins and needles had likely let up for a while. “Where is Rosie?” He asked, more than a little anxiously.
It took longer than it should have for even a non-genius such as John to realize he wasn’t getting off on his own sexual prowess being what knocked his lover down a few pegs in the form of drool and tears running down his face. Not that at all. Instead, he was watching Sherlock’s reddened swollen lips near his skin in slow motion and appreciating the shedding of composure that Sherlock endured to please him. His tears were a sacrifice of chapped cheeks and they were cried just for John. They belonged to John, and he wanted to remember every single one of them.
Still, every morning for the past year he had done much the same as that one, save the first of them when he either woke every day to the frantic beeping of hospital monitors sounding or didn’t sleep at all.
Sherlock’s Adam’s apple bobbed. “Yours.” And then his expression faltered, confidence visibly waning. “Still yours.”
“It’s a rose, a posey, a bee, my cane and my gun...” He said in awe, wishing it was healed well enough for him to reach out and trace with his fingertip. “When did you come up with this? It’s... Rosie, isn’t this pretty?”
with any of them.” He said. “And now I never shall be again. They’re not welcome in my home if this is how they’re going to react when John puts his hand on my shoulder. We are married, you know. Spouses tend to be allowed to touch one another. Just because their marriages didn’t work out doesn’t mean there isn’t any affection left in mine.”
“Oh that sounds lovely.” Mrs Hudson said, and pointed out the rose bushes in Queen Mary’s garden, which were empty of flowers or leaves. “Those are so beautiful in June. This time of year I can’t help but wonder how they survive the chill. Then again, in the americas, I hear that it can get much colder even further south. The lovely girl at the post office told me all about her trip to Alaska and their hottest months are much like our coldest. Imagine that? In Florida, we saw temperatures well over thirty-seven degrees in the summer and I’ll tell you, it felt as if you were inhaling shower steam with every breath. It’s a wonder that so many of their pensioners choose to live there. Seems to me like an excellent way to make someone’s heart give way. Then, of course, further north I’ve read of entire towns being trapped in their houses for days while they work to clear the roads of snow in the winter and it can go any time as early as November all the way into April or even May some years. I could never live in a place like that.”
With that he left, not caring that it was a particularly humiliating variant on the walk of shame. It didn’t matter that John had spent the night sleeping restlessly on a sofa in a police station that was also, arguably, their former place of employment. What mattered was that he was going home.
If John believed in God, it would be because Sherlock was beyond what this hateful earth, and he was somehow and someway sent to save him. To answer the prayers of a child who needed a hero to save him from the need to keep a stiff upper lip.
“And where are the girls?” Sherlock started picking up the cushions in the living room, as if his cats had somehow worked their way underneath without any disturbance. “John, I can’t find Trix or Lucy. We have to find them, now.”
“Aha! There we are-” He announced triumphantly and before John could make another irritated remark, he caught a glimpse of that smile again. What the hell wouldn’t he do to just keep Sherlock smiling? “Now let me flick on the switch- and you should be feeling each electrode verifying that the corresponding joint is powered on and operational.”
Still, it would be cruel to get Sherlock’s hopes up. He didn’t intend to ditch the chair, not only anytime soon but at all. Using these still sounded bloody exhausting.
“I was shot! How can you think that compares to-“ John sputtered, and struggled to even come up with a suggestion to himself as to what that next word might have been, let alone the next complete thought.
Yet, that couldn’t be right. It absolutely couldn’t be right. “We have child proof locks on the windows, Sherlock. Mycroft’s minions put them in when she started walking. Top of the line.”
And John figured that would be the end of it. What else was there to do besides wait for the day and hope she didn’t throw a temper tantrum in the chair?
Even though he never wished for Sherlock to help him with his current braces, this new pair was unfamiliar enough that he allowed his husband to help situate him into it. A bit breathless from the strain of his abdominal muscles from leaning down to fasten the bloody thing, John sat back while Sherlock sorted and attached each wire while mumbling about the need for color coding or to order a new label maker. The last had been used to knock John’s laptop shut when he’d been listening to a YouTube video that Sherlock found particularly annoying while he was in the middle of a sulk.
Only, that wasn’t right, even though it seemed John was still lecturing at him in the same breath he’d used to remind Sherlock of his own chronic pain. But John wasn’t going to hurt him right then, was he? Not with The British Government, their landlady and members of The Yard circling around them. Not over something as trivial as a tattoo.
“No, absolutely not.” John shook his head, and would have stood and crossed his arms if he wasn’t so bloody tired.
Sherlock’s fingers trailed the side of his face, light tremble of his lips inducing small twitches of John’s nose.
The first inkling that John should have had that things weren’t going to be simple was when Sherlock cornered him in the kitchen after breakfast on that delightfully good day. Perhaps the sight of his devilishly handsome husband- and he wasn’t necessarily being metaphorical- in a new bespoke black suit and red shirt had put John in such a great mood that his evaluation of the situation was compromised.
“We’re at a crossroads, gentlemen.” Doctor Fletcher sighed. “I wish that I felt that both paths were equally likely to provide relief but I don’t think that is realistic.”
John held Sherlock’s hand and used the other to gesture towards Doctor Fletcher as an indication to go ahead. As hesitant as John was to admit it, it was in fact his husband’s decision to make.
Instead, she was kind enough to feed Rosie on mornings that John anticipated that Sherlock’s behavior might upset her. Most of these events happened after days of overexerting himself, which was no longer defined by a long case. Cases were done exclusively at home on the rare occasions they were done at all. No, what wore Sherlock down were things like doctor’s appointments, trips to Tesco, and taking Rosie to the park. It happened more than any of them liked, but thankfully the concern tended to be lessened enough by the time she had finished her breakfast each day. As always, she would then go right to Sherlock.
So what was their to leave her for the father that saw her before anyone else knew she existed? That held her through nights of stomach bugs, put ointment on her chicken pox and monitored her fevers far more than the doctor himself thought was necessary?
John let go of his lover’s hands, happy to instead cup his cheek and lean in closer to kiss his tender lips and watch more tears fall as he pulsed his hips through the aftershocks. And oh, more tears fell, coating Sherlock’s long lashes until John knew that he likely couldn’t see much of anything other than John’s general coloring and outline.
“Next time, please don’t call an ambulance.” Sherlock said into the dark that had fallen over their sitting room. “This pain- it isn’t
“Any doctor in this hospital would reject the concept of giving a former heroin user prescriptions for medications that carried any more of a risk for abuse or addiction than those you’re already taking. I can’t recommend stronger muscle relaxers because our physical therapists didn’t believe tense muscles are the cause of the bulk of your pain. It sounded to me like it was far more likely to be the other way around. Over the counter medications will obviously, excuse my language, not do shit all. They can’t help neuropathic pain, which is why
John stopped for a moment, running back through the long list of Holmesian traditions that Mycroft had made him aware of and came up blank. “I don’t imagine even your family invites guests to a toddler’s haircut.”
“For which one of us?” John joked and Doctor Fletcher chuckled a little, all too aware that one restless partner could deprive both of much needed rest.
She didn’t say anything to that, instead choosing to try to coax Sherlock to eat something. He kicked her out with a few choice words and plated Rosie’s breakfast himself. Maybe he couldn’t dispense his own pills but he certainly could put peanut butter on a bagel and cut up a banana. At least until John,
None of that was the point, because John was not snuggled up with his family. Sherlock and Rosie were watching a National Geographic show titled
. His job was at the clinic with Sarah and drippy nosed patients that couldn’t comprehend viruses were not shortened with the use of antibiotics. Caring for his family was entirely different. It was his duty.
“Let me finish,” His therapist said, head cocked to the side evaluating him for something or other than John was beyond noticing. “And you weren’t beaten within an inch of your life- fractured ribs puncturing a lung, concussion, bleeding kidneys- while trying to save the life of your closest friend.”
Though John hated to admit it, he did have a point. Asking Molly for body parts wasn’t exactly soemthing he could do on such short notice but there did have to be something that Sherlock would enjoy.
It was because of this that that morning, John made breakfast while Sherlock gave Rosie her bath, struggling to smile to himself when he probably should be.
He watched Sherlock’s adam’s apple bob as he swallowed. “Yes, John. God I-” There was another sharp intake of breath as John shifted slightly, and he watched as Sherlock failed to contain a pitiful and desperate sob. “I can’t- please move. I need you to move.”
Of all the lines of questioning he predicted she would choose, this was not one of them. At least she was kind enough to give him an out in the form of an inaccurate depiction of circumstances. The implications of her actual point twisted his gut in knots even the world’s most experienced sailor couldn’t untangle.
John read, snorting at the crude wording on the insert. For a company using such high end stationary, they could certainly have paid someone with tact to proofread.
John rolled his eyes. “He also knows that he’s too useful to you for you to arrest again, and... well... you do owe him a bit of leeway given everything.”
“This-“ John swallowed hard, resisting the urge to gag on the words. “-it’s looking like this is as good as it gets.”
Maybe John should have been ashamed to admit that Sherlock loved his daughter more than he did, but it was the simple truth. Rosie was wonderful and beautiful and John loved her despite her difficulties. The difference was, Sherlock loved her for them. Their connection ran deeper than John had felt with anyone other than Sherlock himself, and John certainly couldn’t match that with Rosie.
No, what John did to Sherlock. People weren’t thrown to the concrete floor of a morgue and nearly killed as a matter of coincidence. That was something that was done
His husband’s eyes remained closed, and John could see a small bruise on his temple. Nothing to write home about, and John would have sent a patient complaining of such a small bump home with a prescription for a bag of frozen peas and putting on a pair of big kid pants. But this was Sherlock, and the question wasn’t always what he injured but how it came to be.
Now, all Sherlock needed was his partner to remain available to be a caregiver instead of in a therapist’s office in the middle of an ego trip. Could he not just do that? Why was it so bloody hard for John to wrap his mind around even when he could recite the facts like he knew how to make tea.
and John could not come up with a more apt description for what Sherlock had made a point to do as often as possible since he had gotten home from the hospital.
The moment was too private to have witnesses for, so much forgiveness in those three short sentences that no one else ever should have heard. Forgiveness for years of pain. For drugs and bullet wounds and faked suicides. It should have been bliss, relief after years of hidden tension, and there they all were ruining it!
The absolute elation of being able to hold his husband without the fear of it being the last time he felt a beating heart under his hands sent thoughts of mementos and broken hearted babes out of his mind.
“Well, Rosie here was quite concerned about this nothing little bruise of mine and insisted I lay down to be her patient.” He gestured, eyes still closed, to where Rosie had scattered John’s stethoscope, pulse ox, pen light and no less than forty plasters over the floor next to Sherlock’s head.
“You may want to withhold calling in favors for her medical school recommendations until our daughter here tells you why I needed her care.” Sherlock drawled with a snicker and an eye roll.
By the time John had given him a leftover tramadol- as he refused his scheduled dose of morphine- and ensured Sherlock was settled in and prepared to feed Rosie lunch before their shared afternoon nap, Mycroft had already let himself in and made the two of them tea. They sat in the chairs by the fireplace, John in his own and Mycroft in Sherlock’s, and both lost themselves in their beverages for several minutes. It was commonplace for him to come by after any major appointment, which was all of them as of late, and John had started to appreciate the convenience of not having to make a secretive phone call in the loo or leave Sherlock to ride around London in a black town car. Neither Holmes thought it was right to leave him when his pain and tiredness were bordering on agony and exhaustion, which was, unfortunately, often the case after such a strenuous outing.
“It wasn’t an impulse, John.” Sherlock sighed. “I merely confided in Winifred that I’d been considering this modification for some time and she encouraged me to act. If it means anything, she had one done as well. A beehive for baby William.”
John know, day of Rosie’s first hair cut would be a far more involved affair than John could ever imagine it could possibly be. He had thought of eventually getting around to taking her to an overpriced salon, likely to exactly who cuts Sherlock’s own finicky hair- nevermind it being exorbitantly priced, in John’s opinion- then taking some pictures on his cellphone like any parent in the modern day and bringing home a lock of hair in a bag for the baby book. The very same baby book that Sherlock found out Mary and John weren’t caught up on when Rosie was two months old decided that he should take over, which wasn’t a surprise by that point. Sherlock had been smitten with his ‘Watson’ from the start.
Which, perhaps, John had suggested so she felt obligated to put a photo of her bisexual son kissing his gay husband with their daughter that was being raised without a mother on the mantle over her fireplace. Making it one of the nicest possessions she owned- appealing to her vanity- while also making it impossible to remove their picture- was a well thought over strategy. Besides, Sherlock could never resist an opportunity to remind her that they were far more refined people, both Holmeses and gay men as a collective.
“What are my options?” Sherlock asked, his eyebrows furrowed and John raised his own with surprise. Sherlock tended not to speak during his appointments other than short answers to direct questions and snide comments.
She wrote something down and nodded through it, mouthing words to herself that John could tell were not what he had said. He caught the word
“Mhmm,” He said through flattened lips while Sherlock helped up upright, and was surprised by the vibration of the third electrodes on each side that indicated his legs were properly under him. “Cane- my cane, now, Sherlock.” John said, waving his arm in the direction of where it had been put until the smooth wooden handle was in his grasp. Swiftly he made contact with the ground and let out a sigh of relief.
He shook his head. “No. It’s been a good couple of days that I know won’t last but it’s been nice.” A four the day before and a five that morning were far from disagreeable. They were also following a trend that was heading firmly into the territory John hated that they continuously had to revisit.
Mycroft appeared mournful and disheartened, which was exactly what Sherlock did not need at the moment. He hated pity. John was grateful that Sherlock was asleep.
John swallowed hard. As a doctor, he had known that this could be true, but tried to distance himself as much as possible from the medical-decision side of Sherlock’s condition. It was his job to be Sherlock’s husband, his livein doctor that poked and prodded at him day and night but kept to the instructions someone more impartial looked over. All he could do was maintain and let Fletch handle the bulk of it. The measures John had taken were, for the most part, to address Sherlock’s mental health since he had rejected any type of treatment besides bupropion, which they were lucky to get at all as it was not approved as an antidepressant in Britain. Their only saving grace had been that Sherlock was also addicted to cigarettes and nicotine patches, so they had been able to get it as a smoking cessation aid.
After washing his hands, John popped his head in to tell Mycroft that he was going to take a walk and received another dismissive wave. People liked to wave at him that way, as if it was no inconvenience to them to take up the role of Sherlock’s caretaker for an hour or so to provide the difficult man’s husband some relief. As much as John wanted to resent them for that, he could not be more grateful. A break was hard to find on the bad days.
Sherlock was almost certain Donovan said, and he cringed at the very thought of her defending him- of her defending him against John, of all people. The person who would never hurt him.
“What in the-“ John trailed off, looking at himself just… standing there. Standing with a cane and a bit of a tilt but standing none the less. No braces were visible under the clothing other than a small line around his hips but that could be brushed off as a belt at first glance.
John groaned and put down his coffee to rub his eyes with both hands. “For someone so smart, he can be a git sometimes.”
Sherlock grunted, taking several more. “Now I am. I’ll be right back.” He said, and disappeared down the hall, leaving John alone in the middle of the sitting room.
“Or simply decide it’s you reopening the line of communication to permit tearful phone calls about dreams she had of you burning for all eternity.” Sherlock quipped and John’s lips turned up at the edges even though he knew they shouldn’t have. “I wasn’t sure you’d want her on the list, as she hasn’t bothered to visit Rosie in almost three years now.”
Letting her sleep downstairs with Mrs Hudson on nights that they identified would be particularly bad- when Sherlock might require more care or a trip to the A&E- was still fairly new and incredibly uncomfortable. That despite the live feed Sherlock had on his mobile to where she slept in their landlady’s guest bedroom, and separate baby monitor to indicate when ti required checking.
Lining himself up with Sherlock’s opening, already having been stretched laboriously with four fingers for good measure. John pulled away the arm that Sherlock had put over his eyes and held it above his wrist then gathered the other to hold as well.
Fingers tugged at his roots a bit too hard and he lowered his arm, unaware he had started to begin with. “You didn’t have to.”
“God, John, I am not a child. I can take a shower by myself. Or I could if you kindly got out of the way and let me rise from this bed.” He grumbled and John stood, pulling the tray with him. “You act as if I am some type of naive fairytale princess that never learned to turn on the taps by herself.”
John started to push in slowly, measuring the look on Sherlock’s face, and decided that keeping things business-as-usual was probably the best way to go about things. In one hard thrust, he pressed himself deep inside Sherlock’s well prepped warmth and let out the breath he had been holding.
Concern over his husband’s already unstable moods were the reason John gave in to Sherlock’s manipulative insistence that he needed a cat to keep him company. Twice. Apparently, Mrs Hudson had been feeding cats behind 221B for the last several years and Rosie had grown fond of one of them and a kitten that came looking for it after the first was taken inside. He claimed it was because they were intuitive and he believed they could be trained to help with investigations, but John knew that they didn’t have half a brain between them. They were also nearly feral and had broken every mug in their flat by knocking them off tables, but didn’t seem a danger to their daughter.
What would it do to a child to lose the person that looked at them as if they were the hot sun that arrived during a bone chilling desert night? And how was John supposed to go on knowing that, given all the ways he had hurt Sherlock in the Mary era of their lives, Rosie truly had done exactly that? John was appropriately ashamed that the child of himself and his late wife was the only offering he had unintentionally given.
“- if I don’t do the study, no one else will ever get the opportunity to try these.” John shook his head. He would be taking away the opportunity for something that was supposedly revolutionary from thousands that sustained injuries like his own. More than that, he would be snatching the still likely fleeting smile off of the pale angular face that John had worried would never wear one again.
In that way, it was Sherlock’s sweetest secret resting in John’s hands and profound trust being demonstrated that he would never break it. That he would never so much as bring it up.
With defeat, John sighed but nodded. “Within reason. Run them by me first. And Mrs Hudson if it changes the structure of the building.”
Slowly, as saliva pooled into Sherlock’s non swallowing mouth, John tried to separate himself from those memories. He undid his fly, pushed down the band of his pants and his cock leapt out, slapping only partially intentionally across
Her eyes widened and she nodded. “Oh, yes, that would be lovely, Dear. Let me get my walking shoes and coat. I won’t be but a minute.”
“They’re revolutionary, John!” Sherlock said excitedly as he pulled the pieces out of an excessive amount of foam packing peanuts.
“I’d like her sent one anyway, if it’s not too much trouble.” John said plainly, his irritation only slight because
“I know.” John said and smiled through his remaining and not insignificant uncertainty. “Wait, what are you doing?”
Sherlock at least made the effort to sleepily roll over to answer him as opposed to speaking into the back of the sofa or ignoring him entirely, and John thanked God for small miracles. “Nothing.”
His violin, worth more than their flat at Baker Street, if John’s googling rang true. Not a Stradivarius, but a generous token from a case none the less.
It was likely indicative of his own mental state that he thought more of what of Sherlock’s he was going to give Rosie than how to tell her that Sherlock was dead.
, but with the gray blue ribbon and of course the white frames and metallic gold boxes but we’ll have those hand lettered. There really is no other option.”
Eventually he got himself a serving and sat on the sofa, Sherlock curled into his side, and John couldn’t help but run his fingertips over the ink obscuring wrap that covered Sherlock’s fresh tattoo. The design was rather large, by his standards in any case, taking up half of his inner forearm if all edges were accounted for. If he squinted and allowed himself the indulgence of silliness, the design sort of looked like- “breasts?!” John snickered, setting down his food on the coffee table to avoid dumping it all over the cushions in his fit of mirth. “You got a tattoo of female breasts on your wrist?”
“I think all of us know that we’ve maxed out the potential of the gabapentin and tramadol has been an entirely useless addition that you were quite insistent on trying despite the fact that I told you it was a ridiculous idea so that’s stopping right now. The morphine tablets have worked a bit better, obviously, but the option of administering it intravenously is for an extreme episode, not day to day life. I’ll refill both of those.” She said, shook her head while glancing at the page that seemed to be Sherlock’s previous admittance records.
“Alright, this is getting ridiculous, John.” Greg said as he unlocked his office and came in with two cups of sludge like break room coffee. “I’ve gotten eighteen pretty violently angry text messages since yesterday. You’ve got to go home.”
It was a chance, but bloody hell was John desperate. He was pent up and frustrated and needed to both come instantly and pick Sherlock apart. As his jeans tightened, he wondered if somehow he really was the sexual deviant that Sherlock had enjoyed implying he was over his years of female conquests. If he’d not been so repressed, it would have required much more convincing to say what came next with any type of steadiness.
that Sherlock thrust the book in front of John’s nose and demanded he take part in the decision and the idea that Sherlock might be making a larger deal out of this than John had anticipated began to solidify.
while eating microwaveable popcorn and blowing through juice boxes like they were taking a bath in them. He, on the other hand, was sitting in his therapist’s office because a piece of mail had sent him into a tizzy.
The two men didn’t spend much time talking after that, only making comments on the quality of the food and discussing what to put on Sherlock and Rosie’s plates so all he would have to do was microwave them. The detective appreciated being left to do certain things by himself. Eventually, John saw the extended visit as an opportunity for a rare long shower, enjoying it until he feared the hot water would run out, then gave himself a shave without rushing through and nicking himself too many times. He wiped down the countertops, scooped the litter pans and took the nearly full recycling down to the alleyway.
John shook his head, still in disbelief that people reduced Sherlock to the moment it happened and not the moments after. “He didn’t try to accomplish anything, he got right off the pavement and chased after the perp. The man had murdered two of his estranged children and was holding a third captive. Sherlock saved her and is the reason the other two will be receiving justice. He wasn’t some idiot that wasn’t looking where he was going.”
The man would suffer through whatever pain he had to take to please John, whether John was in the mood or not. That was his only goal most of the time, as far as he could tell. Sherlock cared very little, most of the time not at all, if he himself got off. Oftentimes he would reject John’s advances to reciprocate oral or any contact other than his hands on Sherlock’s hips while John thrusted into him from behind. Truth be told, he wasn’t quite sure that Sherlock was even aroused during some of their encounters, when he insisted that the light be kept off and would mouth off until John was egged into threading his fingers between his husbands dark curls and shoving his face into a pillow for a more thorough fucking. They had a safe word, of course, as John thought they were useful for virtually any sexual encounter where one party or the other had the habit of saying things they didn’t necessarily mean in the heat of the moment, and Sherlock hadn’t used it or the corresponding hand signal of rubbing his thumb over their wedding band.
“Oh?” John raised his brow, thankful Sherlock was taking an interest in, well, anything other than what felt like turning their lives into a 24 hour gifted-genius-child classroom. “When’s that?”
His heart dropped to his stomach and truly, John couldn’t believe it. Pulled tight to his chest, John ignored Rosie’s protest while he kissed the top of her head and relished in the fact that he held a living, breathing, uninjured child in his arms.
“Gavin, get off him! Mycroft, bloody do something!” Sherlock demanded, and Donovan was doing her best to block off his line of sight, but his height put her at an insurmountable disadvantage.
Greg had texted him that the welfare check at two had found Sherlock silently perched in his chair with wet hair, but John expected Sherlock to be back on the sofa by the time he returned, which had the distinct advantage of meaning the worst thing John could be when he returned home was pleasantly surprised.
The neurologist nodded knowingly. “Earlier, I said that any doctor in this hospital would be appalled by this, but I’m not just any doctor and I’m not exactly bound by policy. So, I am going to recommend you either try a stronger opioid pain killer, further exploration of alternative therapy techniques, or both. Your pain is at a level that can’t be just ignored, Mr Holmes, no matter how much you’d like to. Another major seizure could make things much worse, and they only seem to happen when you’re worn down into a bad state. Two so recently is already an alarming number and I’m not confident that the anticonvulsant properties of the gabapentin will do much of anything given that you aren’t epileptic.”
John’s husband saved his life just by existing, brought fire and the thrill of life back to him just by proving he was still breathing, and made a vow that he did everything humanly possible to keep.
“You have one spot next to your nose from falling asleep without washing your face last night.” John continued to chuckle, and Sherlock’s pout as he gingerly sat down in his chair was enough to keep him from saddening too terribly much at the wince of pain upon impact with the seat back. “Meds,” He offered, but kept the question out of his tone. He was due and Sherlock would take them and like it, as far as John was concerned.
“What do you want for supper? Indian or chinese?” He asked, not leaving room for Sherlock to weasel out of eating by claiming he wasn’t hungry. Perhaps the only tolerable thing about the depression was, and John loathed to say it, Sherlock simply ate what was put in front of him. It was slow going and painfully distracted, as were all his movements and even his speech, so the food was consumed cold but John wouldn’t turn his nose up at small victories. Not anymore.
Doctor Fletcher gave John an expectant look and he sighed, shaking his head and untangling one of Sherlock’s arms so he could begin to massage the sensation out of the hand nearest to him. It annoyed Sherlock into at least a seven on the
“Well alright.” He looked at Sherlock’s sleeping form. “For one, a larger bed with a separate adjustable base on each side. Something that can help him sit up or prop his legs to take pressure off his lower back when it gives him such trouble. One of those rolling trays as well, for his laptop or case files.” Mycroft explained. “I’m not sure what either of you prefer as far as mattress type so I’d like to think something that adjusts to Sherlock’s preferred level of firmness that day, with a remote, would be well received. I’ve got one and it really is quite nice.”
It was that night, part of the same horrible routine they had settled into, that clouded John’s judgement. Maybe he would have thought twice about what happened next, or asked more questions until he had known exactly what he was getting into, but that was the thing about maybe.
Sally Donovan, eyes wide and voice infuriatingly reassuring, was suddenly before him guiding him backwards as if he needed a chair and not simply for Lestrade to stop being so stupid.
“Did you check?” John asked skeptically, grateful that he planned to shower that evening and already couldn’t get the smell of vomit out of his nostrils from a child throwing up all over the waiting room floor.
He climbed the steps to 221B with the bag of takeaway hanging from one arm and the other two packages in the other.
, John. God knows being married to my brother was difficult enough before all of this. I can’t imagine anyone less than a soldier being able to survive him.” He said, but there was no spite behind his words. John missed it. The venom in his tone, and in Sherlock’s when they were going at each other, had been evidence of them both having a bit of fight left.
“Go on, love.” John urged him. “Greg and I are just going to have a little talk, that’s all. Be back in time for supper, I swear.”
John gestured at the floor in exasperation, because how could it not be clear? “I’m an adult. I’m a husband and a father and I’m supposed to support my family, not accept handouts so I can lounge on my arse all day.”
Sherlock stopped and glared at him a moment, but it was half hearted. “How can you not see it? These are leg braces, John. Prototypes. The only ones in the world.”
John opened his mouth to defend his husband but couldn’t bring himself to do so. “Yeah, he is. How could he hide this? He could have just told me.” While redness should have flooded his cheeks, it didn’t. He was far too acquainted with Mycroft gaining information on the intricisies of their sex life. It had been that way before the injury.
Was it wrong that John, who admittedly didn’t care for his leg braces at all and had begun to slack on them just a bit, was absolutely dreading the idea of trying to remain upright on anything that hadn’t been proven? He could only imagine them crumbling to pieces and him being thrown to the ground with them.
Hospital tea was terrible, but hospital coffee could only be described as retribution. At least John deserved it this time. He knew he shouldn’t have said what he did, but it was true. There was no possible way he would have stayed at Baker Street longer than a week if he had not been absolutely enamored with the very concept of someone like Sherlock Holmes existing. The first week was all it had taken before John had fallen far too deep in love to ever walk away.
“Sherlock wouldn’t take anything more than his gabapentin today.” John told her, allowing the anger to fade while nearly tearful frustration persisted. “He said he wasn’t going to be on anything that could affect his cognitive function while taking care of Rosie.”
“No thank you,” John said, realizing that if he didn’t take the cane or agreed, the chef would be over in twenty minutes with a single text.
“However, it seems prudent that we reconsider the possibility that remaining at Baker Street may not be a realistic option in the long term. When we thought he may recover at home-“
Sherlock shifted Rosie in his lap then crossed his legs defiantly, but John knew his heart wasn’t in it. Today was draining him and he would likely need some degree of help up the stairs when they returned to Baker St.
Sherlock was already in enough pain to wake him from the sleep his body finally insisted on needing and John quickly set to work, a task that he was fortunate to perform in two ways. First, it kept Sherlock from throwing a fit over the nurse that Mycroft hired that entered their bedroom one morning with that same tray and a chipper attitude. Isabelle lasted less than twenty minutes after that. Second, it gave John what little control could be afforded in such a situation. It was a placebo effect,
John chuckled and rose from where he’d crouched near Sherlock’s head to fetch the first of the brown paper wrapped presents. Then, he knelt down beside where their daughter had perched in Sherlock’s chair with a bowl in her lap, and smiled apologetically. “Rosie Posey, Papa is very sorry that he didn’t come home yesterday. Please, never ever try to climb out the window again to come get either of us because Lovey and Papa will always come home as soon as we can. Promise me that, and really really mean it, and you can have what I brought you.”
It was said like a promise and John filed the sight of their daughter gazing at Sherlock’s tattooed risk away with shoe boxes of thank you letters, lockers with broken clasps and pipes that twisted open to reveal daggers.
“This isn’t a pension or disability coverage,” for the most part. He chose not to mention the policy the Holmeses had taken out years before. “It’s trust fund money. Old wealth and posh public schooling with rowing teams and Oxbridge after passing A levels. It’s not any part of my world.”
This semi-fluffy installment has me feeling a bit discombobulated so I hope the general theme is still shining through or will at least do so by the end.
The doctor said her goodbyes and quickly a nurse came with a few pills that John recognized and a nasal spray. Mycroft took the place of where the doctor and nurse had stood and was obviously putting on a brave face. “It seems you’ll finally have to take that stair lift on its maiden voyage if you have any intention of getting to your flat. I would have Anthea run for a bottle of champagne but I think Mrs Hudson would appreciate it if we saved her the mess.”
“There are exceptions to every rule.” Mrs Hudson put her nose in the air a little, but John knew she meant no harm in the action or her line of questioning. Like everyone else, all she wanted to do was help. Even if that help did make him a bit nauseous. “In any case, Sherlock is very fortunate to have met you. I can’t imagine him surviving such defeat without you.”
Mycroft sat beside him by Sherlock’s bedside, equally as sleep deprived but nowhere near as disheveled or at all reeking of stale sex. If the elder Holmes brother noticed, he was polite enough not to dare mention it. Either way, it was not as if they both didn’t know what had them sitting in that hospital room. Unfortunately- though not for pain triggered directly by sexual intercourse but for positions that had been held during it- it was not the first time that John had felt the need to wash his cock in a hospital staff bathroom.
“Right well,” He settled down and rubbed at his eyes with the heels of his hands. “You should be getting back to his majesty before he tries to make good on his promises. Not sure I want my lower lip-“ Greg’s eyes bulged reading the text message in full and John only had his imagination to fill in the rest.
Sherlock sighed and dropped his arms to snake around John’s middle then rested his chin on the doctor’s good shoulder. “I already slept my afternoon away, we wasted hours together with massages and I’ve missed you.” His lips found John’s neck and trailed a toe curling path up it and behind his ear. “Haven’t you missed me?”
On Sherlock’s third day in intensive care, when the chaotic vitals spinning in every direction made Sherlock’s prognosis appear grim, John wondered what mementos there would be for Rosie to remember him by. She likely wouldn’t remember him vividly, more a ghost in her memory than a solid figure that held her through so many nights of tears and illnesses. John mourned the fact that Rosie was going to lose the person that loved her most. More than his life.
“I think we should start with oxycodone. With potential cross tolerance from heroin use, it’s the weakest that I would bother going. We’ll keep the morphine tablets for daily use and ten doses of oxycodone to last until your next appointment unless Doctor Holmes calls saying we need more, at which point we should probably get you in for a bridge appointment either way. Your husband can help keep you accountable but you also have to be honest about your pain levels for this to help. Is that agreeable to you, Doctor Holmes?” She asked and John nodded anxiously.
“Why the hell would he think that is what keeps me with him? We went years without that, for god's sake, and I’ve never pushed him into anything like that. Even now, I keep my bloody distance unless he brings it up.” John raised his voice as a nervous itchiness spread across his skin and his croaking throat left him struggling to breathe.
Part 1 and 2 posted same day! It’s a miracle lol. Please PLEASE let me know what you think. I get this “screaming pointlessly into the void” feeling when I’m writing and I get no feedback.
Sherlock smirked at her joke, which he hid in Rosie’s frizzy halo of blonde curls, and John appreciated the woman almost as much as he had when she came in on her days off to meet them in the A&E for admittance straight to the neurology department. Pain induced vomiting, nerve damage induced seizures and opportunistic viruses couldn’t always be managed at home.
and the fear behind it. There was no reason for Sherlock to believe that John would ever refuse to listen to any and all of his instructions during sex. It wouldn’t have mattered if John had been two thrusts from orgasm after being edged and denied for a bloody month, he would have stopped. If Sherlock was actually afraid that John was going to keep going against his wishes, then the pain could be to the point of turning him delirious. A ten could do that to a person, especially when their mind was already flooded with endorphins when it began. A ten could drive someone to insanity.
Mrs Hudson cleared her throat and looked straight at the sidewalk in front of them, instead of in his general direction as she had been before. “Now, I know it is not my place to pry, but the two of you are the only children I’ve got and that old house has a lot of creaky floorboards that I’ve noticed have become awfully quiet lately. Not silent of course, I can tell the third floor bedroom isn’t Rosie’s anymore, but the two of you were much more rowdy before that accident of his and-”
aching wrist, the bone itself throbbing as it usually did those days, and he was nearly certain he could feel each individual screw like a stab wound. Just before he made contact with the crinkling plastic wrap, Sherlock thought better of it and let his opposite hand fall.
to remember. From skulls to phones to bayonets, he kept snippets of every case that he could without the yard scolding him for pocketing evidence.
“When we get up, soldier, you’re going to drop and give me twenty.” John joked and pressed a kiss into his hair. “But I suppose I can settle for a few kisses and a lazy evening on the sofa without any complaining at all before we go get Rosie from downstairs.”
“Fine, the window to the fireescape.” He groaned. “She had it open in the thirty seconds I was out of the room and was half way out when I grabbed her.”
John scoffed but with a grin. While he wasn’t quite thrilled about being pressured to use leg braces- and especially not being entered in a fifteen month study without his consent- Sherlock’s joy was contagious. “Sounds to me like you had a few lunches with the orthotist.”
Doctor Fletcher rolled her eyes. “That must be what we owe your chipper mood to. Thank your insomnia on my behalf the next time you see it. Is it your shoulder bothering you? Doctor Holmes has told me that you prefer to sleep with your right arm under your pillow.”
He put a smile on his face as he walked in the door, only to be head butted full force in the thigh by a mop of hair then clung on like a particularly insistent sloth.
The response was immediate, and John had to ignore the vibrating mobile in his pocket while he finished up with a patient and sent him on his way with ointment for his very unfortunate rash. After scrubbing his hands within an inch of their lives, John finally checked the text and felt the small drop of hope he gathered together each day evaporate into nothingness.
“At least finish your juice.” It had very little in it of substance but any caloric intake was a small victory as far as John was concerned. Sherlock took his tea black and didn’t have much interest in the biscuits that John bought anymore. It was just another battle John was destined to lose.
Sherlock snatched the insert, scanning it briefly though John got the impression he may have already had it memorized. “Of course not, those are cumbersome and ridiculous. The battery assisted joints release, facilitate rebound and lock appropriately for each step but those steps and the momentum that bends the joints need to be made by the wearer. And the side stabilizers are like little kickstands, so as long as you distribute weight properly from size to side as you take each step crutches shouldn’t be necessary- on relatively level surfaces of course. A cane is needed especially while in the standing position and in conjunction with a secure railing while using stairs. And the sensors solve the concern of not knowing where your legs might be, using wires that attach from the braces to small adhesive electrodes placed above the point of injury that vibrate according to leg position. Nothing like these have ever existed before.”
Perhaps it was foolish, like poking at an angry badger with a stick which John had made him promise to never do again, but Sherlock thought his snort was a much better alternative to meekness and fear that threatened to overtake him. “Oh really John? I’m in pain? Why on earth didn’t anyone tell me? I hope you’re pleased to be informed that it is fairly difficult to get a hospital acquired infection in a tattoo parlor.”
Beneath the DI’s hands, clearly not putting up even a shred of resistance, John grunted. “It’s okay, love. Not your fault.
Sherlock smirked and snuggled up against John, his head on his husband’s chest. “Yes, Captain Watson.”
His skin throbbed as he helped Rosie through her night routine, and he was momentarily grateful that they’d chosen to make baths a morning activity in the Watson-Holmes household. The thought of the Watson portion being held in a cell at New Scotland Yard for such a ridiculous understanding- an apologetic cupping of the shoulder interpreted as the start of an attack- made him queasy. Sherlock was grateful when Rosie fell asleep easily against his side and he held her tight. When he slipped into unconsciousness, it was without his evening meds, his hair detangled or his evening tea. Without his John.
“John, I’m sorry.” Sherlock said, unsure what else to do when no one made any move to uncuff his husband. “It was stupid. I shouldn’t have-“
could be Mrs Hudson’s way of saying to Greg that he had actually thrown a plate across the room and to proceed with the utmost degree of caution, all the while leaving Greg under the impression that Sherlock might be up for checking out the file of a case that he just couldn’t crack. With numbers, and the specifically designated severity of tantrums that correlated to those numbers, everyone from Mr Hudson to Mycroft could receive fair warning as to what they were dealing with when walking into 221B.
“Doctor Holmes, Mister Holmes, Mister Holmes,” Kathleen Fletcher nodded to them in order, last resting on the still sleeping Sherlock and allowing herself a bit of a chuckle. “Look at what mess you’ve made for yourself this time. Can’t keep doing this, Sherlock.” She spoke to him as if he was conscious even though all evidence showed that he wasn’t. “Well, Doctor Holmes, this seems a bit open and shut to me. No grand mal seizure, no aspiration, nothing abnormal on the MRI or during the pelvic exam- all Sherlock really needs is to stay hydrated, rest up and stop being so obnoxiously resistant to taking his medication. It’s a pill, not a hand grenade. You won’t let him take too much.” She said with the type of confidence earned from being one of the best in her field. “Even if they were grenades, they would be very tiny ones.
“She’s not going to eat until she gets her present,” Sherlock groaned as he was handed the tea, the pill and his bowl of noodles in quick succession. “Kids can smell gifts from a mile off.”
He squirted silicone lubricant into his hand and coated himself from base to tip, ensuring that there would be as little friction as possible to minimize any possible discomfort. John used to love slightly pained whimpers from lovers- safely- struggling to accommodate his size. To taking his cock because they were willing to give a bit of pain for his pleasure
John watches Sherlock suffer through a horrible depressive episode, and takes the only opportunity in sight to help pull him out.
Again, John laughed, and Sherlock seemed even more offended. “What, I do! I’ve got acne like a fourteen year old boy. My voice might as well begun cracking every time I try to speak across any distance further than a table.”
that Mycroft had devised to save all their sanity. It was best for all to know what exactly they were dealing with on any given day when
John’s throat tightened and he looked for further explanation from his husband. “Where exactly did she look?”
Mycroft, looking smug, raised his brow and gestured to the very crate Sherlock was taking a crowbar to. “I come bearing gifts.”
Stone poked his head up just as John covered his ears. “Sherlock, what’s going on?” Him and his brother working together was never a good sign and John resigned himself to whatever it was about being his problem. He wasn’t thrilled with Mycroft, in fact he actually wanted to strangle him, but how could he be angry when Sherlock was so alive?
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I like the blush pink with gold embossed lettering in the font they’re calling
He flinched at the last word, mostly due to the fight he received that morning over even the low dosage of tramadol. “It is.”
John shook his head with humorous exasperation. “Probably because my hands would get tired, and you know I’d go forever if you asked me.”
His brother in law was quiet for a while and seemed to lose his stiff posture and sense of arrogance, as if what he was about to say was deeply humbling. It was the same expression he had worn when, eleven days into a hospital stay over what should have been nothing but whiplash, Mycroft had been forced to see the severity of what they were facing. That no amount of money that could undo nerve damage. It simply was what it was.
writhing in pain to be too picky or complain about much. “Then, once we’re both fed and well rested, we’re going to talk about what happened last night.”
“That wasn’t-“ His voice sounded small, yet not nearly as small as he felt. “It wasn’t my fault, John. I didn’t ask for this. Aren’t you the one who always tells me that I didn’t do anything wrong?” That there wasn’t anything he could have done that was bad enough to deserve
“You know, normally they only have those for frogs.” Sherlock remarked as John used his army knife to pop the seals and pull out the 4D model. “Also, we’re going to need to either purchase two spares for when she inevitably loses pieces, taking it apart and putting it back together again, or craft glue to seal it shut.”
A cry from the bedroom, evidence of a small frightened half-John person that heard the scuffle, met Sherlock’s ears and he felt himself torn in two. Answer the fearful little girl begging for her Lovey, or ensure she still had her Papa when it was all over?
Not that it would do any good, just one one else for Sherlock to ignore. Ignore, not snarl at, because this depression was past the point of anger and sadness and onto the plain of total apathy to anything outside of his mind palace, and John didn’t know if he wanted to find out what was going on inside there. It was that very same apathy that greeted John when the lift reached the 221B, and was currently draped in ripe day-three pajamas that John knew would be an absolute battle to address.
“Yes, it is.” He smiled down at her, and Sherlock leaned with obvious discomfort to guide her head to just under his chin so he could kiss the top of her head. “You’re why I go on- the both of you.”
John wasn’t sure what the right thing to do was when it came to these moments with his husband. Should he refuse, even though Sherlock made it clear that he wanted him and John was hopelessly vulnerable to his seduction? It seemed like the best possible way to tear down the detective’s confidence when he felt the least like himself, considering that he rarely could take the type of cases that had stroked his ego when he finally solved the unsolvable. But was it not taking advantage to let himself be swept away by sex wanted by his husband for a reason John couldn’t begin to unravel?
“Put out your arm, now.” John ordered, and Sherlock didn’t fight John as he found a decent vein and cleaned the injection site before administering the starting dose they had agreed upon. He was anxious, as his impulse was to give Sherlock whatever the bloody hell necessary to provide him relief, but the doctor within John prevailed.
” John whispered harshly, the equivalent of the start of a screaming row for people that have small children. And if John had any bad habit in particular, it was resorting to screaming rows. “
Quickly, he shook off his worries, then stood to brush his lips across Sherlock’s forehead for a beat longer than usual. “I think I can handle that. And I brought dinner, which you are eating, as well as a couple little surprises.”
As the worry rose, John busied himself making the bed, pulling clothes from the bureau, shoes from the drawer under the bed and laying it all out on the bed for Sherlock to change into. When John did that, Sherlock sat down to put on his trousers, shoes and socks. Keeping him from standing on one foot was the primary motivator behind John’s actions, but even on good days it had become very much routine. It was just like the fresh cup of tea that he left on the nightstand, instead of microwaving the one Sherlock had let go cold. A way that he could show love without having to face Sherlock and pressure him to react properly.
Carefully, Sherlock sat up and unwound the wrap on his arm, exposing a simple but sweet design that took John’s breath away.
, given that anyone administering Sherlock’s medications would be relieving his pain the same amount, but at least he could provide comfort that would be accepted.
All he got was a nod of acknowledgement, and shivered a bit at being welcomed into the club of husbands who practically lived in the doghouse. Anderson slept around. John let his temper get the best of him. How different were they really?
Sevens tended to do that and anything past was often a lost cause. If he couldn’t safely swallow then John would have to get the syringe.
So the least he could do was make scrambled eggs, toaster waffles and cut up grapes while they had the time of their lives.
and Sherlock wasn’t stupid enough to believe it was anything more than an empty platitude. But the sound of their distressed daughter calling out for him won out and he turned on his heel, stalking into the bedroom and locking the door behind him. If they couldn’t be with John, they would be with no one.
“Either way, The paramedics informed me that it was no easy feat getting him down two flights of stairs and if this is to become a regular occurrence- or worse, for him to have another seizure- then I urge you to reconsider my offer to find you living arrangements that are more accessible in the event of an emergency. There is a lovely assisted living facility near my home that caters primarily to younger adults who have suffered various injuries.”
While in the past he never would have indulged such pettiness, John had called Mycroft after helping Sherlock to bed the night before. There was no animosity over Sherlock’s stubbornness, and that lack of anger might have been the most terrifying part of all.
John’s nostrils flared and his fist clenched, and for a heart stopping moment he thought that John was going to hit him. That John was going to hit him again. And by the way his older brother took a half step forward with his hand ready to untwist his hidden weapon from its rather creative holster, Mycroft believed it to be a possibility as well.
“I actually was about to go to the park for a while, just to walk part of the path without dragging around a stroller. Would you care to join me?” He asked, hoping that it didn’t sound like a pity invitation. “I don’t get much of a chance to walk with company these days.”
“You’ve got to stop doing that.” Doctor Fletcher sighed then turned back to her work. “I can tell the physical therapists failed to leave a lasting impression of how important posture can be. Overextending your spine is just as bad as hunching over. Nearly as bad as your habit of crawling around on the floor.”
He handed him the plate with a piece of dry toast and it was immediately sat on the other side of the bed. “You have to eat.”
Usually, Sherlock wasn’t so blunt as to express how poorly he felt. If John asked for where he was on the pain scale and if he needed medication, his husband would answer- but other than the confession of passing suicidal thoughts to Victor his unhappiness- was rarely mentioned. Sherlock had never been the happiest man with his black moods and nervous manic energy. The idea that a reminder of why they soldiered on was permanently inked into Sherlock’s skin made John endlessly curious as well as tempted to worship it with lavish kisses. Maybe Sherlock didn’t always want to live, and he certainly had never planned to live as he was, but he would do it for them. Sherlock would suffer boredom and endless grey days for them. If that wasn’t complete devotion, John didn’t know the meaning of the word.
As proud as a father could be, John tickled her ribs. “Look how well you took care of Lovey while I was away! I should take trips more often.”
“What can I do?” He asked, and John was oddly enough not surprised that Mycroft didn’t argue over the new medication. The only thing that Mycroft worried about more than Sherlock relapsing into addiction was the distinct possibility that he was suffering out of refusal to take proper measures. Even if those measures were the very drugs he had fought to escape to save his life.
“-there, brilliant.” Sherlock said, stepping back. “I’ll need to see you upright of course to make sure they’re not terribly bunched up. Ready?”
, they would climb up to her old room and utilize John’s old rickety full size for activities that hadn’t happened in that room since John stopped bringing home new women every month or so.
“Now, Sherlock’s family- your family, in turn- is releasing funds that were set aside for this exact purpose so you can use your skills as a medical professional in a different application. That change is huge, John. Most would hire a home health service or allow the NHS to provide it, but you are taking on the responsibility.”
“Why on earth would you choose to spend your first good day in a week with her?” John asked, and Sherlock felt the familiar sinking feeling in his gut.
When he said that, he meant it. Not just while under John but every moment of every day, Sherlock was more beautiful than any person, painting, sculpture, or natural wonder that had ever been or ever would be. How anyone could look at Sherlock- how John himself could look at Sherlock- without falling to their knees was absolutely impossible to understand. Still, people stood. Buildings and mountains and redwood forests stood. John himself stood. Perhaps it was a standing ovation. There was no other possible explanation of all the facts.
Again, she tapped his arm playfully. “You know full well what I mean. Honestly, the two of you have been so serious lately. You know, at least you’re not like Mrs Turner’s married ones. Apparently they get in these awful rows and I just can’t imagine dealing with that kind of yelling all hours of the day and…”
“Rosie doesn’t like my surgical scars.” His husband said, snapping him out of his inquiry preparations and onto that much more serious train of thought. “I figured I would cover them with a reminder as to why I’m enduring this otherwise pointless existence.”
They ordered in and ate on the couch, the residual hospital painkillers flowing them easily into when Sherlock’s evening medications took effect. Typically, John adjusted, bent and fluffed at least a half dozen different pillows to keep Sherlock comfortable for the entire length of the movie, but he seemed to have found some relief from his hospital stay.
Sherlock didn’t care that he’d been in agony or that his mental state was altered in tiny ways that flayed open the membranes around his carefully bagged up emotions- what Sherlock cared about was that John had to watch it happen.
Working on this fic was my way of coping with the fact that I had finished the Breakable series, which still makes me sad when I think about it. Whenever I need it, I go back to that story and enjoy it all over again, and I wanted to do something to show how grateful I am to MissDavis for writing it. Thank you for such an amazing story, and I hope this does it justice.
Mrs Hudson scolded from seemingly miles away, barely audible over the thud of blood pumping in Sherlock’s ears as he tried to piece together what on earth John was talking about.
Not that it had stopped him smoking the second he could get far enough away from Rosie not to worry about second hand exposure. The bastard had even purchased a second coat for the explicit purpose.
“What on earth is that?” John said, getting out of the lift and gesturing to the large crate currently blocking his way to the sofa where he had been greatly looking forward to stretching out after a long day at the surgery. “And what are you doing here?”
“Fifteen months.” Mycroft told him dismissively. “The first three are spent working up to using them for at least six hour increments a minimum of four days a week and then the following twelve are spent on determining the function of the product itself. The design was presented to me by an individual that took an interest in the research I conducted last year. A grant of two million pounds was acquired to create a series of models and you will be the first to log the long term benefits and disadvantages of the finished product.”
The very mail he had no problem fetching every day except this piece of mail took him so suddenly by surprise. Granted, John had known in an abstract sense that- yes- Mycroft managed Sherlock’s finances and allowed him only what it took to cover his bills, food and transportation, whatever that was at the time. There was a direct deposit into Sherlock’s personal account every month that John didn’t think too much about as he wrote out checks for every other utility while Sherlock paid the rent. That was their deal and he had been able to cope with that. It worked well for them. John worked at the surgery, Sherlock took cases and they split the care responsibility for Rosie approximately 40/60. They had a system.
Sherlock gave a slow nod, thankfully not wincing which John took to be a good sign. “I’m absolutely fine, John. It just seems our daughter inherited two things from you, and your flair for the dramatics is both of them.”
“True, but we also used to do a lot of things.” John offered, unsure if anything he said could be interpreted as comforting or if he was destined to ramble from the start. “We
Grateful for her ability to hold both halves of the conversation, John pulled out his phone and sent a text to his brother-in-law.
“I’m grateful for what you’ve done to help, but this might be…” John let himself trail off all too willingly before gaining the courage to continue his thought. They’d both discussed it, Mycroft urging him to say it on too many occasions for John to keep count of in his brain cluttered with schedules, dosages, appointments and online grocery order.
From across the room his husband chuckled quietly at the stream of words John failed to understand. To him, it sounded distinctly like, “Rake olive tree beams cone booth, Sank Papa!” But based on Sherlock’s adoring expression, he felt it fair to deduce that ‘rake olive tree beams cone booth’ meant he did well.
The sternness in his voice surprised even him, but John found within it strength, save any trace of anger. It was... surprising, really, and came without the usual guilt of snapping at their little girl. Even Doctor Carlisle probably would have evaluated his response to be appropriate given the circumstances. Paternal, but kind hearted. Standing firm without proving entirely inflexible.
She shook her head, then shrugged. “Don’t know. No one told me much other than your med list and to grab bagels. That’s what I did.”
“If I understood your email, John, you received a check in the mail and it’s causing you a degree of discomfort...” Doctor Erica Carlisle said, a detectable amount of judgement in her tone. “Why is that?”
Before he could make any type of judgment on the subject, Sherlock was up and pulling small plastic tabs from the outside of each joint of the admittedly low profile knee-ankle-foot orthotics. Though to call them that would be ignoring the presence of a hip joint.
“Mhmm,” Sherlock took the cup and the glass of watered down juice and swallowed the pills with a sip to wash them down. “There’s at my sacrum.” He answered, hearing the panic between John’s questions. Their sanity rested in each of them knowing what not to say, and hearing the words the other hadn’t spoken.
Her look was hesitant and, against John’s better judgment, neither of them stopped her from reaching out and touching the freshly inked skin. “Is me,” She said to Sherlock.
She had slept in his and Sherlock’s bed only occasionally before the accident, but their weeks living at St Bart’s while she stayed with Molly, Anthea and Mrs Hudson had reignited the separation anxiety phase John had foolishly believed she was long past. Perhaps consistency in her schedule and reassurance they would be there when she woke could have been enough to reestablish the trust that he and Sherlock weren’t going to disappear on her again, but that was quickly undermined by the fact that Sherlock seemed to desperately need her there as well. They’d been close before the injury, before she and John moved back to Baker Street even, but Rosie was an intelligent child, or so Sherlock regularly proclaimed. She knew something was wrong and wanted to be in on the action instead of stuck worrying about it from the cot she was quickly outgrowing upstairs.
A place where, hopefully, he was still actually welcome. Sherlock didn’t seem the type to beg for him to be sent home just to avoid the effort of tossing his things out on the pavement in front of Speedy’s.
” Mycroft wrinkled his nose in disgust. “While I’m aware a nanny is out of the question in my little brother’s eyes, a housekeeper, just three or four times a week, could be a welcome addition. Maybe you might also consider a massage therapist to come to the house when my brother overexertes himself and for you when you do the same regarding his care.”
Truth be told, some days he couldn’t. It was rare, sure, but when his hands cramped and pain shot through each tiny bone, it was a lost cause. On those days, John would take a second shower just so Sherlock would slip in to join him. There was nothing else to do about it.
John huffed both at the understatement and of her glorification of such an inglorious task. “It’s tea and medication. It’s not the heroic undertaking you’re making it out to be.”
He forced a smirk he didn’t quite feel. “Do I ever? Why would I when I’ve got the lot of you goldfish to hang on my every word? Hang on these- Let. Go. Of. My. Husband.”
John leaned in for a kiss, which he was given a bit more than appropriately for their daughter to be within eyesight, but it was one laced with appreciation. With thanks John knew he didn’t deserve, as well as promises of what was to come. Once Rosie was put to bed in
The answer was, of course, not even close. So when Mycroft tried to excuse himself John glared daggers at him. In another life he would have offered to walk him out or at the very least take him down in the elevator but already out of his chair for the evening, John knew any offer to do so would be quickly dismissed as unneeded.
She nodded fiercely and jumped into John’s lap, her bony narrowly missing where it would have been incredibly painful for her to land.
Sherlock smiled devilishly and put on his coat without a wince, which gave John reason to smile right back. When it came to the ridiculously handsome man he was lucky enough to marry, London fell to its knees. There would always be a cab.
laughed. It was not something he had the privilege of doing very much of lately. “When Sherlock’s feeling a bit more rested, we’ll all take you out to dinner. Consider how jealous she’ll be then.” He winked and Mrs Hudson giggled. The motherly woman deserved to feel treasured, because she was. John had no idea how they would have gotten through the last twelve months- or the ten years before that- without her.
In which John buys gifts, Sherlock takes a shoe to the head, and Rosie licks the digestive tract of a sea turtle.
Unsure what else to do, what else there possibly was to do besides accuse Sherlock of lying, John found a steady pace, pulling nearly to the tip and pushing himself back in again, the way that always had sent Sherlock’s eyes rolling into the back of his head before the accident. Moments like this had been John’s favorite in the beginning, as watching his husband come apart at the seams was so liberating. When they were making love, they didn’t walk on eggshells or conceal their own reactions while trying- and failing- to read one another. Eventually, but not at all quickly, the egg shells disintegrated and their masks had fallen. Marriage created, for both of them, a blanket of security. The rings around their fingers were tangible proof that neither of them planned to go anywhere for the rest of their lives. John knew for a fact that he wouldn’t change his mind, and that Sherlock was far too stubborn to change his. It was one of the many things he loved about his husband.
He snorted. “Bionic legs, really? I’ve told you, these sound great until you actually have paralysis and can move faster than you would taking one step every twenty seconds or less. Love, I appreciate you finding these, but I don’t think-”
He shook his head from side to side, tears still streaming down his face and his lower lip trembling hard enough to flex his jaw. Surprisingly and heartbreakingly, his features did not read as denial in the way he tended to downplay his own suffering. No, he was begging. Sherlock’s every movement was a plea for John to understand what he couldn’t say.
But he wasn’t going to think about that, because it wasn’t a problem for that particular day. Sherlock had devoured a box of frozen waffles with more syrup than John believed was proper and a butter count to match, and John was nearly giddy with the thrill of it all. Things were getting better since John decided to set aside his strict sensibilities to borrow a page out of the Victor Trevor’s book, were they not? A few moments out on the fire escape smoking a very different kind of cigarette to at least consume one large meal that day was far better than risking the decreased appetite that Sherlock’s new antidepressant, Wellbutrin, could cause. A nasogastric tube was still on Sherlock’s hard limit list, but thankfully was looking less necessary by the day.
“I’ll have to be. It’s not as if I can stay here and send you in my place.” Sherlock answered and pushed away the covers that were still draped over him, dramatically flinging them in a sorry attempt to cover his toast with hopes John would forget.
John knew that she had dusted and swept their flat while they had been to Sherlock’s appointment but neither of them spoke of it. All Mrs Hudson ever wanted was to help and be included. Still, he knew it was well past time to bring her flowers or out to dinner for her role as not-their-housekeeper-but-definately-their-family. Angelo’s was never a bad option and if they could go on a three day, then Sherlock would enjoy it as well. He had hope that, with the oxycodone, there would be more of those.
“Not like I’ve got anywhere else to be, so whenever you think is best. Let me know when it’s settled so I can put it on the calendar.”
“Rounds upon rounds of antibiotics that were doing fuck all until the morning after I was told I was going to have to start
Soon, the sound of a text message being sent and received was the only sound in their silent flat and the elder Holmes smiled. “I’ve scheduled for someone to come by in three hours. That should give him time to rest, take a hot soak to loosen his muscles and put on his dressing gown to meet Natasha in the sitting room. You’ll go directly after. I believe ninety minutes each should provide a decent degree of relief. She will contact me regarding how often she thinks either of you need to be visited. I urge you to trust the professionals on this one. You may know medicine, but I am the expert in luxury. Natasha really is the best.”
A small smile hid John’s broken heart and he shook the dish, which was rewarded by the jingle of two identical bells and soft padding up the steps. Sherlock insisted the bells were tuned differently and he could tell which cat was approaching by the sound but John never heard it. Perhaps the sound of gunshots had done more damage than he realized. As long as John could hear Sherlock’s violin, nothing else mattered.
As gently as possible, John sat back on his knees and pulled his softening erection from Sherlock’s body, then laid on the bed beside him to pull the man he loved onto his chest.
Unable to deter his husband or feasibly reject his help, John accepted being manhandled to the sofa but drew the line at putting on his own jumper. “You can do the trousers this time, just because I don’t feel like doing acrobatics tonight. I’m sure I’ll be sore everywhere tomorrow as it is.” He said grumpily, but was pleased his sour mood didn’t bother Sherlock in the slightest.
“How did Sherlock sustain his injury?” She asked, although she knew full well how from the email he sent when requesting the appointment. Mycroft likely already sent her a more in-depth summary, because he couldn’t imagine a Holmes respecting the confidential nature of the therapist to clients relationship. “Not the method, but what was he trying to accomplish when he was hit?”
She quit wriggling when she realized it was of no use, a soldier could very easily keep hold of a toddler. The sigh was legendary, only one of thousands to come, before she surrendered the information. “No Papa,” She confessed. “I look.”
“Cold.” Sherlock gasped out and John quickly fetched and covered him with a heated blanket cranked up as high as it went, and then wrapped his own body around his husband’s shivering form in whatever way he calculated wouldn’t cause him more pain.
There was nonsense in trying, because there was absolutely nothing John could ever do to deserve Sherlock Watson-Holmes saying that.
Rosie didn’t materialize and John watched his husband’s face fall. As reluctant as the doctor was to take their daughter with to the hospital, he knew that Sherlock would be incredibly anxious without her to hold onto. It wasn’t that Rosie calmed him, at least not by what John had observed. No, she simply forced him to calm himself, which was a distinction that Doctor Carlisle repeatedly pounded into his brain was very important to make.
but only because he had heard them on her lips too many times to count. Even though John knew that she was about to deliver, at best, sensitive news and, more realistically, bad news, she did not lean forward with a sweet smile to lessen the blow. She would not put a hand on Sherlock’s knee and tell him that she hopes he feels better soon. And she most certainly would never promise that they would figure all this out sooner or later so their family could go back to long strolls through the park and both climbing after Rosie on the play equipment. While originally off putting, it was part of why John liked Sherlock’s doctor and, even though he would never admit it, Sherlock did as well. The placating promises of the private hospital Mycroft had arranged for him to stay in for a week that claimed to be
While Mycroft seemed mildly amused watching John’s face, Sherlock was still digging around for something in the sea of packing foam that he was grateful Stone wasn’t attempting to eat. “Your specific needs were listed on your medical records. If you’d like to know a bit more,” He handed John a pamphlet of instructions on textured paper.
Sherlock pulled back only slightly,  spotting him. “Lean a bit more to your left and adjust your cane accordingly. Yes, right there.”
Sherlock continued to chew his lip, this time with determined concentration. “I’m going to spot you and keep you from tipping over. Hold the cane in your non dominant hand and lean forward onto it while keeping your weight on your non dominant side, slightly leaning in that direction.”
He sighed and shook his head. “How long is this study supposed to be?” He asked, transferred to his armchair, despite the fact that the one opposite to him was occupied by Mycroft, and tipped his head back.
“I don’t care how well rested you claim to be. I haven’t slept a wink in the last thirty hours and I’m about to pass out on the floor.” John grumbled before Sherlock had much opportunity to argue. “And you’re going to stay in bed with me no matter how boring it gets because I fancy a cuddle. Got that?”
“What are you doing? Unhand him!” Sherlock ordered and tried to approach the scene occurring just across the rug that their daughter’s blocks were still scattered upon.
Sherlock pulled back, visibly insulted and very nearly- was that hurt? At one of John’s many silly comments? Typically, intentional stupidity only deserved a firm- “Don’t be an idiot, John. It’s very clearly not any part of the female anatomy and I greatly resent the implication I would ever choose something so foolish.”
John, and he forgave him anyway. How, he still didn’t know. For someone that claimed to be a sociopath for so long, John’s husband never seemed to shed his sense of loyalty the way John repeatedly did so with his sense of responsibility for his own actions.
Sherlock made an exception to his no-one-else rule only two hours later, when Rosie began to fuss for dinner and Mrs Hudson brought in a tray of juice, tea and sandwiches. She sat on the bed for a few minutes, asking Rosie all kinds of questions about the tuna fish boat program that Rosie was never going to be able to answer. It was still obnoxiously kind of her to try, which he knew that John would have appreciated so Sherlock tried to do so as well. He figured it still counted if he did so silently.
“That’s exactly what they are, only they are used for the partial second that the other leg swings, weren’t you listening?” His husband chided, but there was still thrill in his eyes. “Ready to get up? You’ll just need to hold onto me- just like that and then you’ll feel points two through four as long as your positioning is correct. Points one and five will only-“
John reached up and rubbed his eyes, resisting the urge to growl solely due to the excitement coming from Sherlock as he worked on assembling the contraptions. “And what if I don’t want to do this study.”
. I’m not injured. My life is not being threatened. It’s stupid to waste your time and their time for absolutely nothing.”
“Yes,” John answered plainly, because it was the truth. And he continued to rub Sherlock’s neck and shoulders, noting the way the flesh became more malleable with the expert kneading. Being an army surgeon had required extensive knowledge of the muscular skeletal system, which left his information on neurological disorders sorely lacking. While he regretted not paying more attention to the recent advancements in the field, at least he could do give Sherlock the pleasure of expert hands that belonged to someone who loved him so so so terribly much.
“We could have lost him so many times and haven’t.” Greg agreed half heartedly. “But we didn’t keep him either, not really.”
“Budge up.” He said and transferred out of his chair to stretch out on their sofa which had taken on the smell of the detective.
At least, that was what John had been able to deduce from the gesture and the giggles involved every time.
Near the stairs, Mrs Hudson had a hand cupped over her mouth and, thank God, Donovan was soon distracted enough by the hyperventilating old woman for Sherlock to slip past and reach John in two strides. The perk of being in constant pain, if one stretched the definition of perk within an inch of its life, was that most people were afraid of touching him. Afraid of hurting him. Which only served to mean that Mycroft didn’t try to pull him back and a bewildered Lestrade made no move to push him away. Though, if he had, the irony of doing the very thing they thought they were arresting John for attempting might have been enough to get them to release him at once.
beautiful husband. Thankfully, Doctor Fletcher tended to view him as a colleague as well. Their cooperation was in Sherlock’s best interest. It had been the reason he received a diagnosis, after all.
It was obviously the direction they had been headed, but the pill was no easier to swallow when the moment came. New prescriptions in hand, courtesy of the hospital pharmacy, the cab ride back to Baker St was quiet. Sherlock kept his gaze out the window and was determined to get up the stairs by himself when they arrived, taking five minutes while wincing at what John could tell was shooting pain in his hips. It took very little convincing to get Sherlock to lie down in bed and was made easier by the company that Trix and Lucy offered.
His shirts turned into pillows that they kept perfectly clean so the soothing scent of Sherlock would never be washed away? A dressing gown turned princess costume, a last token of how Sherlock spoiled her?
Sherlock groaned when John wedged his warmed hands under the stretched out collar of his old T-shirt and leaned his head back with closed eyes. “Tense.”
“That wasn’t really up for debate.” John said, initially ignoring the fact that Mycroft used the word progress, relaying his refusal to accept his little brother was not about to make a miraculous recovery. “The accommodations are working somewhat, not letting him take on everything with Rosie. We also knew his tolerance was too high for the milder medications to have much of an effect in the long term which is more than half the problem. Doctor Fletcher decided that it would be best that he start a stronger pain medication. Oxycodone. I offered Sherlock more morphine, hoping it would give him enough relief to get a few hours of rest, but he wouldn’t take it. He was restless all night and only slept soundly for maybe two hours the one before.” He explained.
Doctor Fletcher wrote something down. “I’m afraid that it's likely a combination of sinus drainage and the expulsion of stomach acid through your nasal cavity that caused it. They’ve eased off the morphine to see how you felt when you woke up. I’m going to see if an anti-inflammatory sinus medication provides you a bit of relief. If so, there’s no reason you can’t be home by lunch.”
“Of course I love you, you git.” He said, as the phone rang out. “Why the hell else would I be here?”
All of their fight ran out months ago, Sherlock’s two separate hospitalizations being the final nail in the coffin.
His husband swiped a palm over his face and seemed impossibly more angry afterwards, not composed. It frightened him, if he was being honest, and Sherlock knew that John was far gone enough not to be paying much attention. While unobservant under the best of circumstances, John always struggled to pay attention when Sherlock needed him to do so the most, when he couldn’t find the words but needed John to desperately understand.
“No,” John shook his head. “Probably a four on the best days and an eight on the worst. He has a tendency to isolate on those days to avoid my noticing. More fours and fives there were any higher but not by much. Sixty/forty I would say.”
“Jawn,” Sherlock moaned, and John still could not begin to fathom why he ever said John’s name that way. In that voice.
“It’s fine.” Sherlock seethed and pulled his hand sharply from John’s grasp, only to present him with the other one. John did not hesitate to get to work, well knowing that if his husband was willing to submit to it at all then the day was at least a six. “That sleeping on my back nonsense was impossible and my side was not much better. If I can’t sleep on my stomach then I won’t bother at all. I’ve been known to go days without it.”
He huffed in disbelief. Disbelief that this questionable device had ended up in their sitting room- these types of things cost tens of thousands of pounds without NHS approval and he already had his- and disbelief that they looked to be custom made just for him.
“Use me,” He gasped, and John painted his husband’s lips with the tip of his leaking cock. “Oh good god, Jawn!”
‘Little’ wasn’t the right description for Sherlock’s present, but Rosie’s was modest enough to fit the bill. Somehow she sensed the existence of gifts, and was hovering around the kitchen table while he plated their suppers.
John knocked on Mrs Hudson’s door and the older woman answered only seconds later. She likely had heard him coming down the steps.
Sherlock nodded in a way that clearly meant ‘you and I both’. “Doctor Watson, I believe the only cure for my debilitating headache would be a morphine tablet, a kiss and tea.”
“John, I know that we’ve had this conversation before and you’ve been quite insistent that my brother’s wishes be respected. I find that commendable.” He said. “Foolish and blinded by devotion, but commendable.
“That does sound like a very noble cause to sacrifice himself to,” She agreed. “And not something an idiot would be able to accomplish. Is Sherlock’s service to London any less deserving of respect than yours to Britain?”
“You. Don’t. Get it.” John huffed, and shook his head, his voice high and strained. “You can’t get it. You’ve got no idea how painful it was to watch you die.”
other than the front door of 221B to pick up the mail, medication and grocery deliveries. There were appointments at the hospital- so many so that he sometimes wondered why in God’s name they even bothered leaving- but other than that all John wanted to do was lock their little family of three into 221B, bundle up in warm pajamas and never leave their bed unless it was to grab more DVDs from the sitting room cabinet or snacks for Rosie.
While John could not stand the idea of a stranger cleaning their house, especially when Mrs Hudson was very willing to help and would take personal offense to another woman’s dusting, he was willing to concede that massage therapy had the potential to be beneficial. Sherlock had refused the treatment earlier but only on the grounds that if he was feeling poorly enough to require such measures that he would be in no mood to leave the flat. In general, Sherlock did not wish to be seen when he was at anything less than a Sherlockian two, which was an actual four.
Sherlock was taking out his cellphone and holding it level, walking around him in a circle. “Taking video for the creator. He needs data on your progress and posture. It must be done every seven days along with a daily log and journaling to analyze the psychological effects of use. It’s all in the pamphlet. Is that as straight as you can stand?”
John nodded to the neurologist. “Yes, that’s the only way he can stay comfortable for any length of time. I try to massage his shoulder and neck every night with that lotion you recommended- thank you, by the way- for at least fifteen minutes but it only helps about half the time. More for his muscle soreness because of how he’s held himself to avoid the pain than anything else.”
A small cry accompanied the rapid shallow breaths that his husband was taking, and John watched two hot tears drip from the outer corners of his eye and down the sides of his face, wetting his hair and pooling in his ears. “John, I-” Sherlock stopped, and whined again. John wished he knew if that whine was a wanton plea for friction or an expression of pain. Sherlock had always been a crier during sex, the sensations overtaking him and intimacy forcing him to face emotions that he had spent too long repressing.
During one of their after-appointment-appointments at the pub, his tongue had loosened after one too many pints and he had told Fletch all about the nightmares. She was the only one that knew. It wasn’t as if Sherlock paid attention to anything John did anymore other than if he was following his my-word-is-law instructions on the care of the little girl that slept in the bed between them.
“Tender or tense?” John asked, watching the way Sherlock shied away from movements involving too much of his shoulders or neck.
In a twisted way, that made it a bit easier to call in an order for takeaway Chinese and brush through a small shop nearby while he waited for it to be ready. The girl at the register tried to strike up a conversation with him about his purchase, and he politely but deliberately cluelessly told her he was paying with cash. Sometimes, in the modern day, it was best that people not know his name. Having a random woman dropping her phone number in the contact field wasn’t going to be conductive to kissing and making up.
“Oh, John dear, we should visit the theatre this summer. Even Sherlock and Rosie would enjoy it, you know. They do primarily Shakespeare- so many beautiful gowns- but there are musical acts from time to time. I can’t imagine he would like that at all but if you wouldn’t mind accompanying Mrs Turner and I, it may be enough to pry away that pecan shortbread recipe that she’s been so stingy with. My maple scones are far better, mind you, but not knowing can drive a lady mad. Not nearly as mad at the two weeks I had to share a kitchen with my mother in law. Oh that was terrible, John, she kept adding water to my wedding soup and I just…”
Choosing to ignore him, Just as Sherlock was ignoring John, John opened to the first page of the packet and began to read.
John pulled the already comfortable man into his arms, squishing into a crushing embrace that he hadn’t felt safe giving him in far too long. “Me neither, but pushing yourself into something that isn’t pleasurable for either of us isn’t any kind of solution. The sooner you cooperate, the sooner things might get back to some semblance of normalcy.”
Sherlock’s teeth bit down hard on his lip and John felt terrible as he had to pull it out from between his teeth, worried that the man would bite through it if a wave hit him hard enough. Instead of answering, he unclenched his hands and splayed them out on John’s chest, all fingers separated from one another.
“It’s my choice, isn’t it? I’m the one who has to endure whatever torture methods the medical community has devised and I want to be the one to decide. Tell me what I’m choosing between.”
She wasn’t and it only took a bit longer than it usually would for John to reach the inner circle of Regent’s Park. For an older woman with a bad hip that spent a disproportionate amount of time chasing after a four year old, Mrs Hudson didn’t slow him down very much and John was in more of a mood for a leisurely stroll anyways. Although, those days, walking anywhere without the strain of a wheelchair in front of him or having to make sure his arm was flexed for Sherlock to collapse into at any time just so they could get down the halls of St Barts sounded far more than leisurely. It was luxurious.
His skull, the one he held and spoke to in his darkest and loneliest hours? Was it a perfect or poor gift to give the little girl that filled a corner of his lonely heart that John would never have fit inside, but was fatally empty?
Contrary to what John expected, Sherlock didn’t argue and kept up his chipper attitude through dinner. The pleasant company continued for the remainder of the evening and Sherlock gave John a luxurious massage before bed. Despite being sore and a bit anxious for a reason he couldn’t place, John felt like things were finally getting back to pre revenge-of-Moriarty normal at 221B.
He quirked his lips, “Well, you did get an impulse tattoo with your twenty-something lesbian cousin instead of having lunch.”
John, again, raised his brow. “What am I looking at, exactly?” He neglected to challenge Sherlock’s definition of ‘families’ given that John had a mother that insisted they were going to hell and a sister who was only a bit more sober than usual at the moment.
“Thank you.” John said, having already swallowed his pride when grocery deliveries began showing up and checks from Sherlock’s trust fund- which previously had been restricted due to his past drug use- had begun showing up in their postbox. Losing Sherlock's case work and all of John’s shifts at the surgery had done a number on their financial situation. They did still have a child growing out of her clothes, shoes, books, toys and movies like a weed.
John’s daughter’s grin was wide and she tucked her chin towards her chest reminiscent of the way Mary had looked when she was trying not to laugh. “Ice!”
“Here, I bought these a few days ago.” Sherlock said, returning with a shopping bag from some swanky store on Savile Row. “Clothes, John. Just a bit bigger- and nicer, of course- to properly fit over your braces. Here, I’ll help you to the sofa and you can try them on. If the sizing is correct, I’ll send for more.”
But Sherlock had come, and he had saved him, and over and over again they had survived. And now, their lives were becoming pleasantly simple. Things were getting better. Calmer. The epitome of domestic bliss.
“Is this some sort of fetish you’ve discovered? Do you want me to wear a plastic tiara and be spanked with a feathered scepter? No wonder you spend so much time on your laptop.”
