“Inanna,” Cas says, a flash of his old self showing, that tone he used on Uriel back in the early days.
Leaving the bed is harder than it should be. The house isn’t icy, but his skin pebbles and he has to make himself set his feet on the floor. Val bought him some slippers, but he doesn’t know where they’ve gone. He does know where the huge dressing-gown is, and he pulls it on slowly, the weight of it more than it should be.
God, she needs Val here. Val hasn’t known Beth as long, but Riva would have to be very, very dumb to miss the way her sister feels about Beth. She’s almost convinced her friend feels the same way. And Val took most of the talent in the family when it comes to shouting at people you love for doing something stupid.
An image of a chair, of being held down in a chair with white light all around, flashes through his mind. It wasn’t real. That chair was never real. Analogues and proxies, a shape crafted to last into his envesseled state. He tells himself that what was done to him there, in Naomi’s part of Heaven, wasn’t really being tied down in the sense these people mean it. He tells himself that.
“Cas is awake,” she says. “He’s asking what happened. Does anybody have an answer for him that isn’t just me spouting weird shit?”
“Cas,” she says, tipping her head sideways as though she thinks that part of her might be able to leave the conversation, “you’re barely out of angel-surgery and you’re still hurting. And you’ve had a lot on the last few days. You don’t need to waste your time worrying about my feelings.”
“Oh, I don’t know,” Val says, still in that teasing voice she’s been using since she saw the spell had worked. “I think a lot of us need someone to take us to bed every now and then. Wouldn’t be averse to someone doing that to me, really. Shame there’s no takers.”
I'm posting the next bits in smaller chunks than I've written it. I have the next 4,oo chunk written just about, so I may update tomorrow as well. Don't go getting used to it being so quick. I'm avoiding exam marking (no one tell my team leader...)
“Okay?” She frowns. “He looked kind of shut down. I’ve seen it before, that look. My, er, my brother went like it, after…”
Inanna regards Dean thoughtfully before replying, and Beth half expects her to ask Cas if Dean is really off limits.
Next, he tries one of Sam’s shirts. It drapes around him like a shroud, and Castiel looks down at himself in contemplation.
It’s Cas’ turn to swallow, and Beth swears it’s enough to make her tear up, how grateful he looks at the comment. And how sad.
“We’ll look into it,” Dean says, and catches himself. He has the feeling he’s going to be doing that a lot from now on. “I mean, if you want…”
This close to her desk, the guy looms. A bar of sunlight falls across his face, picking up the almost unnatural green of his eyes, and Val reminds herself that climbing an FBI agent for fun is probably not the right course of action here. Besides, he’s giving her the sort of vibes that make her want to cut him down at the knees. Smart coat, styled hair, a face that could be in a magazine - he’s got to know what he looks like. Hell, he probably relies on it. Being hot isn’t enough to make her like him.
“You said you’re still hurting. You still needing to sleep, too? You think maybe you should go and get some rest?”
Dean visibly climbs down from whatever plateau of rage he’d reached, relaxing enough that his grip on the bottle eases. At least, his fingers aren’t white where they hold it.
“Cas,” Dean says. “Trust me. I want to. But we aren’t using this to avoid the other stuff, all right?”
“You’d be the one switching sides,” Bella called out, and her smirk was almost as good as Dean’s. If Castiel couldn’t see how tightly she gripped Hannah’s arm, he might even have believed it.
“Right,” she says, at last. “Right. Well. The burn isn’t too bad, at least. I don’t think there’s anything I can… We should go. Don’t want to miss the meal.”
Unlike most of his memories just now, the bite of being cold is harsh and vivid. It was amongst the least favourite of his experiences as Steve.
No. That isn’t what he means. His dad did the best he could, and Dean knows that, but… But maybe John Winchester could have put his children before his own pain. Maybe Dean needs to put Cas before his own pain.
It’s going to find her and she’ll be alone, in the dark and dead, and no-one she loves will even know where she is. Shit. Why did she leave the house? Why didn’t she just lie and stare into the darkness of Beth’s spare room?
Dean makes it through a few pages, reading a confusing page about Reapers and shaking his head at the author’s list of different categories. Dean knows enough about Reapers. He makes himself keep going, reading through the mentions of Greek mythology and Sumerian songs and on to a page about Griffins and then Ifrit. This book’s all over the place, and Dean knows his attention is flagging when he has to read the last entry three times.
“You see yourselves as being against the world,” Hannah said. “And Dean especially has a great deal of trouble with anyone who doesn’t support the plan he currently thinks is right. It’s…angelic, almost. In a way.”
“Yeah. He babysat her once.” As she speaks, she sets to work getting Tanya dressed. Nora loves seeing her daughter grow, but getting her dressed hasn’t gotten any easier. Today, she offers Tanya the bright orange top she loved last week, but Tanya shakes her head and pouts. “You have to wear something, Tanya,” she tells her daughter. “Do you want the blue dress?”
He says that as though being useful to his friends, to those he wishes he were strong enough to think of as charges, wouldn’t help him. He’s tired of being a burden.
Dean’s hand on his arm startles him: the warmth of it, the weight, the fact Dean’s touching him for longer than a few seconds when death is not immediate or recently averted. He thinks he might be hallucinating when Dean’s hand slides along Castiel’s forearm and meets his hand. Dean’s fingers twine with Castiel’s and if this is insanity finally coming to claim him again, he thinks he may welcome it.
Except he did. And it’s okay to think that now: Cas and he are together and everyone in the room knows it. Huh. It’s going to take some getting used to, not having to be defensive about the way he feels.
He’s cold. Blankets are warm. He’s been circling that thought for some time and hasn’t reached a conclusion yet.
“You want us to wait out here?” Beth asks. It sounds like a genuine question, not anything loaded. “We could wait, you know. If that’s what you need. But, well, we could stay behind the three of you, too. Keep the door open behind us. Run if we need to. And that way we’d all be together. Splitting up’s hardly ever a good idea in the movies.”
“No. You said ‘something’,” Val says, fixing Sam with a look that says she isn’t letting this go. “Are you talking about some new drug? Wait.” She turns to Cas, who looks startled. “You haven’t taken any of this shit, have you? The ketamine’s bad enough.”
This time, it’s Sam’s voice, and Castiel comes back to himself to realize he’s slumped sideways, onto Dean, who’s holding very still.
Castiel knows the sort of damage Sam has taken and not let stop him, but he also sees the layer of determination under Sam’s words, and he nods.
The diner’s a bust. Dean can’t find anyone who remembers a tallish guy with dark hair and seriously blue eyes. And people remember Cas. There was this aura about him even back when he went through that phase of being human, and it’s stronger when he’s an angel, that draws people into his orbit. Dean isn’t sure why not everyone knows it’s there, but they must feel it.
This man is orange and yellow, and Castiel wants him gone. He opens his mouth to tell him so, and stops as moss-green appears in the doorway.
“He’s ill, okay? I’m pretty sure he’s taken too much, and his legs are messed up. And he looks like he’s hurting pretty much everywhere.”
“Right,” Sam says. “Of course you haven’t. And Dean hasn’t prayed at all? Okay. Well. I’m going to get something to eat. You, er, might want to come out and see Dean. He got a bit banged up. Again.”
“No idea,” Sam says. “Some of these things are over in minutes… Others?” He shrugs. “Dean and Cas were stuck in Purgatory for a year. Cas for longer. I think.”
Val takes her time leaving, leaning over Cas and pressing a kiss to his forehead before she goes. He’s very still. After weeks, months, of seeing him become more and more jittery, of watching him place himself with his back to the wall and his eyes all over, it always seems wrong when he’s still. Even asleep, he’s normally not got quite this air about him, as though he might never move again.
“I’m glad to be of use,” Castiel says, and looks up to find Beth in the hallway. “Gertrude has the tablets.”
“You know it doesn’t really work that way. I can’t just show up with Aidan in tow and tell them he teaches for us now. And did you hear him speaking that language Gertrude goes on about? There’s a lot more to his story than we know.”
“I’m gonna be sick,” he says instead, because it’s true, and because he doesn’t know if he can look at her face, with its concern and its shock and its vague disgust, any longer. It isn’t the right face, the right shade in the eyes.
It isn’t much, but at least she has him somewhere safe for now, and Beth can help her to look after him. And if she ever finds the guy who hurt him, Val is going to make sure he knows how much damage has been done.
“No. Yeah, I know,” Dean says, his other hand slipping from Castiel’s shoulder and folding around Castiel’s chest. “I get that. And I’m glad they’ve stepped down the security alert, I am. But, Cas, they weren’t completely wrong. No. Let me finish.”
“What say you, Castiel, Angel of the Lord? You think there could be someone who wants me toppled from my thrown? Thrown from it.”
“We’ve both been there, Dean,” Sam says. “We’ve both lashed out at nothing and we’ve both felt everything piling in on us. And at least we grew up with emotions, you know? It’s got to be hard for him, feeling all this. It’s not like angels are taught how to handle their shit, you know?”
And Jake is strange, if only because he shows no sense of fear or of wariness. Nora seems slightly wary, but even that is welcome after being around so many people over these last months. Even not knowing she’s an angel, so many of them react with a soul-deep fear of Hannah’s kind. She can sense it, even if she’s never really known more than the basic shape of what they feel.
“Yeah,” Sam says, and inspects his pastry with far more intensity than it really needs. “Yeah, I’m pretty sure it’s two bedrooms, so we’ve both gotta work on wiping this from our minds.”
“Sure,” Dean says, before Castiel can feel awkward. “I can finish up the eggs. You got anything to go with them?”
“You already said you’d try to catch how you speak to me,” Castiel says, because perhaps Dean just thinks he doesn’t remember, that Castiel was too out of it to hear those words.
“I don’t know,” Val says, at last. “But Cas didn’t seem scared of him. More…of letting him down? And even more of letting Dean down.”
“Yes. I did. But humans aren’t the only sentient beings who inhabit this realm. Or weren’t. Back then, the Gods were a great deal more active.”
“I just think we’re more invested in Cas, and more quickly, than makes sense,” Riva says. “And before you take my head off, I do care about him. I do. But there’s something about it…”
They’re at Beth’s, waiting for Gertrude to bring round a friend who also waxes lyrical about that weird language they like, when a sharp knock at the door brings trouble. Riva goes to answer it.
“I have access to my angelic form again, but I’m not fully healed. I think it just reset the connections.” Which is something Sam will need to ask about later. “My wings are still ruined, and my body still hurts.”
“No,” Cas says. “It’s detailing other angels who made their homes on Earth during this period. They weren’t all the same kind. Seraphs did spend time here, but so did Grigori-”
“If, when, we get Cas fix-” He cuts off at Beth’s raised eyebrow. “Er, if we can help him heal as much as possible, if he gets to a decent place, we’re going to make him understand it’s his choice if he comes with us. You get that?”
Maybe Cas doesn’t even want that. Not just right now. Right now, Cas is in rough shape, and no-one can be feeling frisky when they’ve been used as a chew-toy by the universe. No, Dean’s wondering whether someone who identifies as a beam of light and a million eyes and wings and weird limbs and whatever-the-fuck-else Cas is can even want sex.
“What?” Dean asks, for the third time. The first thrum of a headache buzzes in his temple. “If I’d known working this case would put you in such a shitty mood-”
He catches his first response and takes the moment he needs to interrogate it. Dean has spent time lying next to Castiel, Dean has spent time holding him. Dean has spent time telling Castiel he’s cared for. The mission hasn’t been mentioned nearly as much. Logically, it’s him Dean’s worried about. The thought is new, almost jarring, but a good tactician takes on board new information, even if it’s strange or uncomfortable.
God knows, with Beth and Val in her life, Riva has to be the one to do that. Not like they can rely on Mom, with her drama and her expectations and her long, rambling stories about how Janey down the road is married with a kid on the way and when will Riva or Val do the same?
The rumble of an engine draws Nora to the window, one of Tanya’s stuffed toys dangling from her right hand and the handles of three mugs in her other. She feels her eyebrows rise as she takes in the golden-colored car at the curb, and even more so as she sees Steve behind the wheel. Not the kind of thing she’d picture him driving, though she can’t now decide what would suit him better.
Cas’ eyes widened a little, and Dean had time to realize what he’d said. Well, screw it. He wanted Cas to stay. He wanted Cas to be with him. So it wasn’t the most romantic of proposals, if you could call this a proposal, but they weren’t the romance types. Cas just needed to know he was wanted. And Dean wanted him.
“Come on, man,” Dean says after a while. “You get what this is. Don’t you? I…I need to know you get this. I’m starting to feel like a creep, here.”
The light about him grows, and shifts, and solidifies, and Val’s half-blinded by a flash of lighting in this enclosed space. She’s completely thrown by the shadows of wings thrown against the far wall, framing Cas. Rooted in Cas.
“You gotta wake up, Cas, and you gotta talk to me. Properly. I can’t drive away and leave you this time. And…and I’m sorry. Okay? I’m sorry for anything that…that seemed like I was angry with you, or didn’t want you around. I mean, yeah, I get angry with you. I do. You pull some stupid shit. Stupid, self-sacrificing, stubborn shit. And it scares me, Cas. Fuck, but it scares me.”
Not that they normally worry about that kind of thing, but then normally they aren’t hoping said god might play taxi for Cas if they need it.
Dean jolts forwards, taking in the set of Cas’ body. There’s focus there, and intent, and more than a hint of exhausted pain just waiting to drag at the angel.
This hasn’t got anything to do with any of that, though. This is people looking at Sam and thinking that, at best, he failed to stop his brother hurting Cas. He might have softened Beth’s view on it, or Riva’s, but they haven’t come around to welcoming Sam and Dean in. There’s still that wariness, that air they’re watching for anything Cas needs protecting from. It’s exhausting.
“I waltzed,” and she paused, something dark on her face, “out of Hell and into some hideous nether region full of lost ghosts. And monsters. Really, Dean, it’s a wonder reality is holding at all.”
He sees Sam hesitate, drawing himself up and in the way he does when he’s not sure he should go with his first instinct. He sees Sam glance at Beth.
Cas appears next to her and she jumps. When he leans in, she finds herself wanting to wrap an arm around him, but she resists. It’s probably not a good idea to make Inanna think random hugging is on the table, not with the way she looked at Beth back in the other room.
Castiel frowns. There seems no point in explaining to Inanna that not a one of these people has been ensnared. He isn’t sure why they all seem to care for him, but he’s more grateful than he can say that they do. He only wishes he were worthy of it. No. Beth’s spent enough time talking with him about thinking like that. If they think he’s worthy, then he must be. In some way. If he tells himself that often enough, Beth has promised it might start to feel true.
Which is how they end up pulling up at the park with Val’s car behind them, the huge red thing she drives towering over the Impala. From the backseat, Cas peers out at the scene. Dean knows, because he keeps checking on him in the mirror.
“Yeah,” Beth says. “I don’t- Listen, I don’t know how you ‘should’ feel about any of this, but I do know you aren’t foolish or stupid or anything for it. Sometimes we just need saving. And that can be okay. You know?”
Resonance. Okay. Dean nods as Beth and Val perk up, asking Cas about what he means and apparently following the explanation well enough to ask follow up questions. He sees Sam paying attention, but his brother, big brain that he has, doesn’t join in. Dean supposes it’s a long while since Stanford, and not like Sam majored in Math or Physics.
“So,” she says, handing him a cup of water and folding herself into the chair nearby. “What do you do? Hang out in alleys and leap on muggers?”
A faint crinkle of Castiel’s brow was all the response that got. The guy had made his opinion clear an hour ago, back when Dean had come to with his arms stretched above his head and his wrists circled in iron. Bespelled iron. Cas had spilled such an in depth, doom-laden description of the damn things that it had taken Dean nearly twenty minutes to realise Cas was clutching his stomach, and that light was seeping out past his fingers.
“Yeah. I mean, we’ll gank whatever’s preying on this town, eventually, and once Cas’ bodies aren’t fighting each other we’ll need to decide what to do.”
She sounds much more businesslike, and much more friendly, and Cas nods, relaxing in a way that only now shows how tense he was.
It can’t be so rotten to be dangerous yet, but Nora isn’t risking it. Even clearing the deck will cost money and time, though.
“She kept me from shattering. That’s all I can think- Dean, I know it isn’t important, me being broken, but if this can-”
“Dean,” he says, because that much he is sure of. Then, blinking, he pulls away from the lives lived in light before him and parses the sentence. “The same. Watching TV.” He wants to sink back into it, but makes himself flick the show to a standstill. It only helps a bit. “How’s the case?”
Sam glances at him more than once before he speaks, the soothing rumble of the Impala’s engine surrounding them. They’re pulling into the car-park and circling for a space before he finally says anything.
“Because you’re not,” Beth says. “I know it can be hard, but I don’t like to hear you think of yourself like that.”
She doesn’t sound sure about that, but there’s a determination Sam can’t ignore. And he needs to keep an eye on Dean, sure, but if this is something about Cas, well… Cas needs him, too.
Beth gets to Val’s place as soon as she can once her morning lectures are done. She already knows she’s too late to be there for Cas during the interview, but she also remembers the hours after seeing Greg again. Cas might find he needs the support more now the visit is done with.
“You can’t go wandering off again in that state,” she says at last. “I’ve…called my friend. She’s coming over. Bringing her sister. So, you can stay, because we’ll all be here to keep an eye on you. Right?”
“One slip and I’m gone,” Sam says, making his voice as earnest and non-threatening as he can. He has himself held in, body language safe and careful. “I promise, he’s my family. I mean that. I’m not going to do anything to screw this up.”
“I could eat,” Val says. She leans over the back seat towards Dean, her left hand only inches from his shoulder. “And I can talk to Cas, if you like.”
“Sure,” Dean says, falling into his role as defacto head of the mission, the way he does almost everywhere. “You okay there, Cas?”
“I’ll take the wine,” she says. “If I really can’t have any of these humans, then let’s just get on with it, shall we? Now I’m in the mortal realm I want some fun, so the sooner we get his done the better.”
Dean couldn’t say that, at the time, he’d still been so angry, so lost at what Cas had done, that he’d not given that as much thought as he should have done. Cas had been so distant, the gap between human and angel only widened by secrets and lying and a break in Cas’ mind, that Dean hadn’t fully considered Meg might be able to hurt Cas. Not until later, when he’d sat awake while Sam slept, fretting that she might do something awful.
Riva interrupts before they can get any further, but Dean has more to say about accepting your mistakes and moving on. He has a lot of thinking still to do about it, too, but he’s starting to see an edge he can grip on to.
Part human. Castiel feels the weight of that statement ring through him, sending ripples of electric blue and acid green, of burnt orange and evening purple winding through his true self. Part human. And part…is he even part angel, even with the reset from Naomi’s spell? An angel is meant to be an agent of God’s will. An angel is meant to be God’s intent in the world, and it’s been a long while since Castiel was that. He may as well be a demon for Inanna. In this, he might.
“Sorry,” she says, her hands up. “Didn’t mean to startle you. Should have thought. Are you awake? Do you know where you are?”
She must have dropped it, somewhere in the run, and now she’s alone in this dark space, at night, with-
She pauses as though giving him space to contradict her, and Castiel wonders if he should try a joke, if he should try saying he would only attempt to kill them when they were awake, for the increase in challenge. He has never been good at judging what humans will find funny. What anyone else will find funny, really. He decides such a joke may not appeal.
“He’s not human. Dean. You can’t see what’s been done to him, but I can. If that’s a result of being close to you, I have to wonder if he’s better off somewhere else. But, what do I know? I’m just a goddess of love.”
Movement to the side brings his wings up, useless as they now are, and he registers Sam, a look on his face that makes Castiel want to snap, to reject the pity or concern or whatever it is dripping down the taller man’s face.
Sam throws part of a pastry at Dean’s head, and they set about getting ready to call a God round for coffee and gossip.
Behind him, he saw one demon move, saw the panic that made it so dangerous, and gripped Dean more tightly.
“Still,” Dean says, “Cas thinks this is genuinely supposed to knit an angel back together. Not rip out parts of their mind.”
“You did say that, Dean,” Sam says. “Cas was sorting out the Christmas lights, and you said he wasn’t getting any better.”
After a pause, he shakes his head, a gentle side to side movement that doesn’t really convince Val he’s responding to her.
Strategically, it makes no sense for Castiel to pull one to him. There’s already something in this town, and Dean and Sam don’t need anything else to face.
“You’re saying Cas should take himself into some pagan underworld even one of its gods can’t come back from? Because, lady, if I lose Cas, you ain’t gonna be safe up here, either.”
“How does that help?” Sam asks, throwing a look at Castiel that looks concerned. “So Cas is your messenger. How’s that get him back out? You said you wouldn’t get back out. You said even Cas’ light would be drained away in that place. I don’t see being a demon’s a better thing.”
“No,” Cas says. “Well, yes. Yes, I was attacked. But I think it’s been draining me ever since. I think it’s been trying to take away what doesn’t belong. Think about it: his role is to drain what shouldn’t be in the underworld from each soul who arrives. When the Rit Zien was here on Earth, he tried the same: to continue his mission in a place where it no longer made sense. That doesn’t mean a deliberate attempt to harm.”
He watches as Cas, Val hovering at his elbow, makes his way to the settee. No question, Cas is in pain. Dean’s seen him hurting before, but he normally heals himself up, and he’s always a little stiff, a little stilted. This is more than just being stilted.
“You intend for Dean to take on demonic powers and destroy the cultists,” Castiel said. “You think he can return to himself after that.”
Castiel lies awake in Val’s spare bed, bundled under blankets and wearing pajamas Beth picked out for him. He wonders what Dean would think of them.
Beth’s words strike him, shattering some of the panic. Yes. Panic. That’s what he’s feeling. He hates it, hates that he knows the shapes and textures and colours of things like panic, of emotional pain.
“What, you’ve sent Cas on a quest?” Dean asks. “This ain’t some 80’s teen movie. No Goblin Kings or dancing puppets needed, okay? There and back. Drop off the thing that’s been draining him and get on with our lives. Now you’re telling me Cas has to jump through hoops to even find your kill-happy sister?”
“You figured the card would last long enough,” Dean says. “Hey. Like I say, no problem. You didn’t steal it. And did he look okay?”
“Suppose you could have made that sound a lot grosser,” she says. She holds up a hand as Val opens her mouth, glee dancing in her eyes. “Don’t. I said you could have done. It wasn’t an invitation.”
Warmth from the mug of tea curls into his palms, licking away some of the ice cutting through him. He can’t shake the cold these days, and it’s been getting worse. He hasn’t told them that.
Bela was beautiful: sharp and shining black. She smiled at him, an expression which him want to tear at her until she only ever smiled for him, with his permission. He shook the feeling off.
She’s silent for so long he starts to think he’s misread her, that mentioning getting Cas help isn’t the way to loosen her tongue, but after giving Dean another, searching look, she nods.
“Cas,”, Dean says, “you gotta tell me what’s going through that head of yours. Does this really have a chance to help you? Or is this you strapping yourself together with whatever might last long enough to make you useful to the rest of us?”
Dean looks up at him again and he looks wounded. It’s a look Castiel has seen before. Without quite meaning to, he reaches out and brushes his index finger along Dean’s forehead. He’s healed Dean before. It’s entirely unfair, that he doesn’t seem to be able to it now. He isn’t even sure when he lost this particular ability. He isn’t sure about a lot of things.
He can’t keep looking at Sam’s grey eyes, any other colours in them pushed aside by emotions Castiel shouldn’t be causing him. It’s his job to protect the Winchesters, not to bring them troubles. Instead, his gaze skitters away over the car-park. The drunk man is gone. Instead, a small knot of people stand nearby, one of them with a phone pressed to her ear.
“Yeah,” Dean says. He draws the words out like taffy. “It’s just, he needs his bed back, and you’re kind of…well…”
The door to the spare room hangs open, and Beth’s steps slow, a crawling sensation that she’s not on the same page as reality making her long to turn and hide back under her bed-covers. Val sleeps with the door closed, and she’d be up here asking what was up if she’d got up early. No way would she hear Riva and Beth moving around in the night and not want to know what was happening.
She shakes her head, pulling in on herself. If she had wings, they’d be wrapped tight around her, the tips folding together over the tops of her feet. For a moment, he thinks he sees them.
Sam cuts in, which is probably a good job, because talking to Val is like sparring, and Dean isn’t even sure what kind of fight it is. She delivers words like she’s landed a knock-out blow, even when the words themselves don’t carry a punch.
“I get this is something huge. Well, I get that I don’t really get it,” she says. “And I don’t know what Cas here has been through, not really, but you do get there isn’t always a ‘through’, right? It’s not…it’s not a tunnel you pass through and then you’re back out in the open air like it never happened.”
Rain spatters against the windshield and Castiel watches it, his hands wrapped around the steering wheel. The knuckles stand up, looking bruised in the red and purple and green neon signs.
“I didn’t see who it was,” he says, because Dean has drilled it in to him, over the years, that civilians couldn’t simply be told about the supernatural. “I can’t tell you anything.”
“Dean, I’ll do what I can. He’s my family, too. But if Cas doesn’t want to see you then you’ve got to back off, all right?”
“Something of Cas’,” Dean says, making it cutting. If Cas wants to tell them, he can, but Dean isn’t getting into it. “Something I didn’t know he’d lost. And trust me, Cas, if I knew you were without that I’d have camped out here. You can’t be taking risks like this. You get that, right?”
But Dean made that comment about not being straight, and slept right next to Cas, and surely he can’t have done that and failed to tell Cas how he feels. Not even Dean can have let Cas miss that. Right?
He didn’t answer, but he nodded, a jerk of his chin that could have meant anything. It would have to do. If Sam put Bela, or Castiel, at risk by going to typical Winchester lengths to save his brother, she’d have to do something about it.
They sit in silence for a while, and Dean wonders if Cas can hear Beth and Val in the garden. He’d kind of like to know how they’re getting on. Then he feels Cas move, and looks round to see the guy a bit closer, looking at him.
Before anyone can speak again, a rush of cold air blows through the room and Dean hears water. For a second, it’s like he’s standing by that river in Purgatory, the water flowing past as he stares at Cas, desperate to know why the angel left him, even more desperate to make sure it doesn’t happen again.
“Or you can come party with us,” Inanna says, and waves a hand at Cas. “No? No, fine. You’re mother will be worried, in any case. I imagine. Assuming she’s noticed you’re gone. So many souls to oversee. It always sounded dull.”
He’s considered trying that, in the moments when he comes close to trying flight again, when his wings ache to lift and beat at the air and pull him away from it all. There’s a way to take one flight into nothingness, or so it was always said. Such a flight, even if he were able to make it, would go against his orders. Dean’s orders. But rewriting his mind might not. Dean told him once not to change, but he’s failed at that already, and Dean has asked things of him which he’d never have been able to do without changing, so it must be an order Dean rescinded.
She missed Bela. She missed the demon’s spikiness and her determination and her ability to act as though she was completely in control even when Hannah knew a good part of what Bela had gone through, even before death. Bela gave the impression she would survive anything, even if she didn’t survive without cracks. In a world where so much had been lost, Hannah found that comforting.
“You speak Enochian?” she asks. At least she seems pleased about it. “Val, Beth, you didn’t tell me your friend speaks Enochian as well as studying quantum things. Do you know much?”
The nagging thought that just a small amount of the powder would reduce the physical pain again is easy enough to push away. It is. He can do this. He’s an angel, and has lead a Garrison, has lead an entire army. He can do this.
“Do you know I can see you?” he asks now, because it feels wrong to witness the soft warmth on Dean’s face if Dean doesn’t know he’s sharing it. “One of the eyes looking at you is slightly out of temporal alignment, but I can see you well enough.”
“Can we all sit?” Sam asks, using his soothing talking-to-victims voice. “We really do have some questions we need to ask Cas.”
Which doesn’t tell Sam half of what he needs to know, but he quells his impatience and follows her through the house.
He’s starting to realize that there’s more than one Cas in his head: the one he sees as a human with a few fancy powers; the one who’s inhuman and terrifying and strange. There’s the broken one, the warrior, the confidant, the tool. Because he has to face facts, here. There are times Dean’s so focused on getting what he needs, to save other people, to save Sam or the whole god-damned world, and sometimes those are the same thing, that he’s set Cas as a person aside and thought about Cas the asset. And who does that to their family?
“Perhaps,” Castiel says. “I don’t remember the incident in the park, so I don’t know how many were there. But there were three of us in the warehouse, and more today. It bears consideration.”
“Castiel said to me once that sleep could be pleasant, if you knew you weren’t just going to wake up as exhausted as you were when you climbed into your sleeping bag. Angels don’t have to sleep, and we may need to keep an eye on it, but if he’s sleeping just because he wants to then it should be fine.” She tipped her head to the side, fixing Dean with an all too understanding look. “I take it you were in the bed with him?”
“Gonna have to do better than that,” Dean said. He nudged the blade with the toe of his boot, pushing it into the demon’s hand. “Take it. Get up. Fight.”
“Sir,” the woman says, and she takes a deliberate step forwards. Castiel thinks she means to be calming, a reassuring presence. “If you know who attacked you, your best option is to tell us. We can’t protect you if you won’t tell us.”
“I’ll come,” Dean says, but he doesn’t put down the beer bottle, doesn’t stop pacing on the other side of the room. “What can he do? Throw me out?”
Castiel wants to reassure her. She’s been so kind, so welcoming of a stranger she has very little reason to trust or care for.
“Still,” Gertrude says, chopping her hand through the air in a way that dismisses Dean’s comment, “people can be easy enough to convince. And I’d love to have him work with me on more than one project. But where is he?”
Dean doesn’t like to think how long he sat up on the other bed, watching Cas sleep. How he nearly, so nearly, told Cas fuck it. Told him to get in the Impala and come home.
The room’s been cleaned, and even though it looks like a piss poor job, there’s also no sign Cas was here. He’s cleared himself out of this room the same way he used to vanish, leaving nothing behind him and no clue as to where he’s gone, when, or if, he’ll be back.
“That’s great, Cas,” Beth says. “Why don’t you bring them through, though? It might be easier than reading them in here.”
Sam stitched Cas up while Hannah and Bela worked on the cuffs, talking in some shorthand that implied they’d known each other for a while and trusting each other’s ideas so easily that Dean felt like his head was spinning.
“Gertrude will be here as soon as she can be,” Val says. “She’s just got held up with something, but she’ll be over. Perhaps she can keep going with it and Cas can rest.”
“Yes. Party.” She looks at him as though he’s being slow. He thought he’d left that look behind when he’d regained his Grace. “It’s in a couple of days, still. And there’ll be a doctor there.”
“Is it something you said, or we asked about, or something you read?” Riva asks, sliding into a more serious tone than she’s been using since Dean and Cas came downstairs almost an hour ago.
“You found her?” she shouts, far louder than necessary for the distance. She finds it hard to care, even as the sound echoes round the street. “Is she all right?”
Dean clamps his mouth shut, his jaw tight, and breathes through his nose. He doesn’t tell Castiel to move his finger, and Castiel flattens out his hand, fits his palm to Dean’s face. It brings him closer to Dean, but Dean doesn’t pull away.
“I know that,” she says, as though Steve’s just questioned her preparation for a task. “But our present clothing won’t stop us from painting a deck.”
It’s longer than is comfortable before Cas nods, and Sam makes his way to the only spare seat before Cas can change his mind. There’s no sign of the other two women. He doesn’t ask why.
“No,” she says. “It’s just, you don’t seem the type of hang out in alleys. Or above them. And you look worse than I do.”
Dean pulled his hand away from Cas’ face and after a moment’s thought slid it down his hand until he reached the guy’s hand. He hesitated.
“You know,” he says, and shifts his gaze away from her, looking up at nothing, as far as she can see.
“Dean thinks he gave me that name,” he says. “I’ve never told him I’ve been called Cas before, by others.”
This part is harder to explain, and Dean only ever has so much patience for Castiel talking about his own kind, his own reality.
“I’ve got it,” Sam says, snatching the phone up from the bedside table just before Dean’s hand closes over it, and answering it curtly. “What? What’s happened?”
“No, Cas, you’re weak. You should rest,” Sam says. “I’ll read them again, and Riva’s looking, and Gertrude’s coming over-”
“It takes people’s memories for a living?” Dean asks. “What, and it’s on a busman’s holiday? Because this ain’t like a barman getting drunk in another country. This is hurting people. Hell, it hurt Cas.”
“Yeah,” Dean says. Uncertainty infects his tone. Then, lower, quieter. “He isn’t getting any better, Sam. Are we doing something wrong? He nearly drew his blade on you just now.”
Bela sprawled on a low bench by the far wall, inspecting some blade she’d picked up and casting looks his ways when she seemed to think he wasn’t looking. He couldn’t see her smoke, either.
Jake shares a look with Nora and his mouth pulls into an expression that says he regrets his phrasing. He turns back to Steve and smiles.
“Look, I know you’ve been through a lot, Cas, but you look clammy. Kind of…kind of panicked. Is there some reason you don’t want to be out?”
“In a junk-shop in Leeds, of all places,” she said. “Thought it might fool some particularly stupid buyer.”
Black flashed across Dean’s eyes, and Sam only just caught himself before he flinched. He stood his ground as Dean took another step, his stance closer to stalking than before. Hell, it was close to the slink of a hunter on the prowl, secure in the knowledge his prey had no chance of escape. Sam lifted his chin and refused to move.
“Dude,” Sam cuts in. “For one thing, Cas loves you. Been obvious for years. Okay, so I missed exactly what was going on, but come on. It’s Cas. And second? Moving too fast? Seriously? It’s been how many years now? You wanna slow things down, take the guy on a few dates when you get back. Buy him flowers. Hell, make him a mix-tape. But no way have you moved too fast here. Not as long as you’re trying what we talked about-”
Without meaning to, she sketches a sort of part bow as she holds the glass out, and curses herself instantly. It isn’t a proper curtsy. She has no idea how to do that. It isn’t even a bow, really. It’s more of a…a bob. An awkward bob. And should she be saying something? Shit. This is not something she has any preparation for.
If a Rit Zien comes now, it will find him with his head pressed against a thin board of wood, sagging and useless. He isn’t sure, in this moment, if he will even beg for his life. The thought is so real he almost expects the door to move, to push inward, driving him back onto the ground. He remembers the feel of the floor under his knees as he looked up at Ephraim. He remembers the desperate desire to live. It’s frustrating that he can’t capture that feeling now. Such epiphanies should be lasting. Many things should be lasting. He’s lost track of the moment he realised they’re not.
“Do you remember anything about the creature?” Castiel asks when no-one else does. “Anything you can tell us might help.”
‘Yes,’ he says, and doesn’t ask how the child is doing, because this waitress has no idea Castiel visited their home, that he looked at the model tractors and the picture books about birds, that he looked at the hole in the boy’s heart and healed it. He can do that now. Again. It’s something he chose to keep. ‘Coffee. Black.’
“Look, man,” Sam says, and he seems to grow larger, somehow, “you don’t want to start something here. Trust me. Just let us get to our car.”
“I’m willing to listen now,” Val says, and it’s a correction. “But if we don’t buy what you’re selling, you leave when we tell you to.”
He used to believe the most vibrant and passionate of humans lacked a Seraph’s fire. There are many reasons that opinion’s changed.
He moves, startled into action, pulling her with him, and she’s going faster now, covering more ground than she could manage on her own with her bruised and throbbing knee, but that thing’s still close behind them, close and closing, and they’re heading for a doorway which she hopes to Hell leads outside, but it’s so far, so far and it’s behind them, that thing, and-
“No,” Cas says, but he doesn’t offer anything else. He sounds…tight. Tight and small and maybe a little pissed. He doesn’t turn his head to look at Dean.
Dean followed him, leaning on his elbow and running a hand up Cas’ chest, his throat, and back to his cheek.
Sam almost points out that Cas, with his mangled Grace, might not count as a full angel anymore, but Cas isn’t stupid. Cas is far from stupid. He’ll have considered that. Cas thinking of himself as damaged and twisted is something they should be working on steering him away from: he has no trouble deciding those descriptions fit him all by himself.
“Dean and me, we’re staying at the usual place,” he says, and that has to be aimed at Cas. “You don’t need a card. I know you remember Dean’s number. Use it.”
“Not sure yet,” Dean says, but it answers something, because no way would Dean answer like that unless Cas is still alive. “Help me get him up.”
She says it like most people would suggest a cup of chamomile or something. Hell, the way she says it isn’t a million miles from the way Dean throws lines like that at Sam. Except she doesn’t sound at all like she’s trying to rile them.
Cas moves his head, as though he needs a better angle, and sits up. The warm feeling vanishes with him.
“Okay,” Nora says. “Well, if you’re sure. Um. I suppose I can ask if anyone has power tools they can lend me.”
He’s a pillar of aching salt and he can’t decide if it would be better to still feel the pain in his wings because at least then he would know they’re still there. Dean’s question makes no sense at all.
“Sure,” Riva says, “and the first person I thought to call was you. Not any of the actual medical staff where I work.”
He watches them now, renewed, free, having chosen to keep so much of who they were, and knows that Dean will ride with Sam back to the ranch he shares with Eileen. He knows that Dean will call him at some point tomorrow and ask Castiel to come pick him up. He knows that Dean will greet him with a new list of places to try, and if, at this point, it’s more an excuse to spend time together, just the three of them, nobody will point it out.
He hasn’t found a Rosetta stone for Cas, either. Raking through everything in his mind hasn’t given him a clue that pans out, and praying gets him nothing. He checks every phone at a few hour’s intervals, but the only calls are from the other hunters who still speak to them, asking after advice or seeing if they’re in the area.
“He’s got wings,” she says. Her brows crease, and it’d be comical if Cas were safe and with them, if Sam could see the confused, offended look on the angel’s face. “Cas has wings. He’s a…a fairy.”
“You hang on in there,” she says to him. “And you come back to us, you hear? We’re all waiting for you.”
She hasn’t done that for ages, and she didn’t think she ever would if it looked like Val might need help, but Dean is so large, so obviously physical in a way that writes him huge on the scene, and even Val was backing away.
Castiel’s lips quirk up at the corner. Speaking with Beth and with Val has made him…thoughtful, perhaps. It’s made him think how good it would be to share more of his true self with Dean. And with Sam, of course, who may be more interested in an intellectual capacity. But it’s Dean whose understanding he wants. Maybe he can have that.
He doesn’t let his sight wander further, doesn’t listen for the sounds of the people in the next room, or the one beyond. He hasn’t listened so far since the second week he was here, and he rarely leaves. Leaving has become…an unsavory concept. He pays the rent each week, handing it to the woman who shuffles to the door and knocks, three times, her hand sticking through the opening far enough to grasp the notes. He takes the deliveries from the willowy young man who arrives at Castiel’s door at odd times, knocking a pattern that jars through Castiel’s mind enough to rouse him, and slips a packet into Castiel’s human palm. Other than that, he sees no-one. He does his best to hear no-one.
Now, Dean rolled his eyes at Bela, shared a look with Sam, who was pale and tense looking, and lit the wick.
“Hell is meant to be ruled by an angel,” Bela said. “The level of devotion for Lucifer, even when he loathed them, is something no demon could ever manage. And they’ll accept Dean trusting you. It will work.”
Castiel considers this. The laptop has a smaller screen. Size is relative, of course. When his true form is unfettered, it is massive: far larger than Dean has ever seemed able to comprehend. It shouldn’t matter that the screen will be so much smaller, so much less. But it does.
“I’ll go get him,” she says. “I’m just going to assume you won’t watch anyone through the walls as a general thing, Cas.”
Instead of answering, Dean turns to Sam, his mouth opening but no words arriving. Dean shakes his head. Sam pulls a face, one Castiel has seen before when Sam hasn’t known how to say what Dean wants to hear. When Dean turns back, he points at Castiel with his free hand.
“Didn’t know he had one.” And given the way he’s reacted every time Val’s brought up how much pain he’s clearly in, she’s surprised. Not surprised he’s skipped it, though. “You want me to call round?”
Moving quickly enough he catches her off guard, he turns, sees her stumble, and holds his hands up as she steadies herself.
“There aren’t any bridges here for me to leap off.” Even as he says it, he know it isn’t the right answer. He hastens to add a more reassuring sentence. The last thing he wants is to cause Dean yet more pain. “And I don’t want to leap from one, in any case.”
Wood-grain is coarse against his forehead. He leans against the door, one hand near the handle, and thinks. Tries to think. He may need to leave his room, but there is so much noise and chaos out there. And he isn’t healed. The pain in his shins is bright sparks of lime green, of electric blue. High notes, sharp and small and more than enough to make him wish he could drift. But he must have been given less than he thought, because already he hasn’t any left. It should have lasted him more days, more time spent away from the flesh he’s forced to live in, from the true self which should never be allowed to survive with this much damage.
The deck turns out to be easier to fix than Castiel had thought. Jake helps him, and Nora, although Hannah looks confused by being asked to play with Tanya.
“What are… Who are you?” she asks, because it’s just something messing with her head. That’s all. Stress. Stress is making her see things. “What, you think this is funny?”
It’s a bit clumsy, and maybe not the best time, but Sam read through a bunch of those websites Dean had up, and even though he never caught it from Dad like Dean did, he supposes there are some things he can work on, too. If he’s really being honest. And seeing Dean try to pull back from snapping at Cas, and seeing him fighting against everything Dad and the world has poured into Dean’s head to do it, makes Sam willing to at least try.
“Well, I’m up now.” Castiel says, because it’s true and because he isn’t sure what else is supposed to go in his part of this conversation.
“I’m sorry to hear that,” he says, making himself relax his posture and sit back. He doesn’t need to make her more afraid than she already is. “But I don’t get what you mean about Cas.”
Dean turned back to the rest of his group, smirking, his arms still wide, and span back to face the demons.
Beth doesn’t point out that they aren’t exactly the town’s go to people for a manhunt. Instead, she takes a step closer to her friend, half wanting comfort and half wanting to give it.
She takes another sip of her tea to ground herself and makes herself tune back into what Gertrude is saying.
“Stop it,” Beth says, one hand reaching out to land on Cas’ shin. If he feels that, he doesn’t react. “I don’t know what you did to him, but he’s not yours now, and you can’t speak to him like that. He’s not screwed anything up and you don’t get to talk to him that way.”
Hours trickle by, slipping through Dean’s fingers as his mind throws up images of Cas hurting, of Cas chained up, beaten up, tortured. Of Cas driving the Thunderbird, untouched by anyone, with that ragged pain still choking him. In some ways, Cas is better when he has someone to fight against. Dean knows that feeling.
“Did you ever tell him you love him? Were you two together, at any point? Are they right about that part?”
“Sure. Sure,” Gertrude says, before putting out her hand and stalling Val. She still has the coffees held hostage, too. “I was just wondering. That friend of yours? The young man with the hair?”
“Who found me?” he asks, because the longer he’s awake the more the certainty that he saw Dean drains away. “Did…there was…a man?”
Sam pushing away from the table breaks the stand-off, and Sam’s lip curls before he turns away and strides from the room, leaving Dean alone with the books. The books and the questions pounding at the inside of his skull.
The back door opens right onto the deck, and they all come to a halt in the late morning sun. Steve narrows his eyes and tilts his head. Hannah doesn’t seem to even be looking at the wood. If anything, she’s staring out over the trees at the back of the house. Something about those, at least, seems to please her.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean says, from halfway down the garden path. He almost sounds casual about the fact his brother just called him away from kissing Cas. Again. His attention doesn’t stray to Sam completely, or for long, before he’s meeting Cas’ gaze again. “You call me, you hear? None of this going silent crap.”
Bela nodded and within minutes the two of them had the chains holding Dean and Cas to the room ripped loose, cutting the metal close.
Whatever conflicted feelings she has over being saved, she doesn’t lay them on Cas, and Beth’s glad of it.
That should certainly draw Castiel from the bed, but his sense of dislocation lingers. The bed is real, the blanket is real. His cocoon of warmth is real. The rest seems…less so.
He’s looking at Val as he finishes the sentence, and Beth looks across to see Val roll her eyes and groan, but it’s clear she’s joking.
“It’s mint. I find it helps, when I’m hung-over. No idea if it’s the same with…er. Well, anyway. Can’t hurt.”
It’s a struggle to keep looking at her, but she’s met his eyes now, and he remembers how Dean’s lips pressed together whenever Castiel let his human eyes slip away from Dean during a conversation. Annoyance, he thinks. It didn’t used to cut.
“Books. Er. On angelic lore. Load of symbols and myths and all sorts of crap, but some of it might help. With Cas. If you want.”
“All right, then,” Val says. If he’s happy to use the name his ex uses, that’s his choice. “Did we make a decision on the tea?”
Jake disappears into the kitchen without answering, but Steve nods. His eyes look better than ever in the deep blue Henley he’s wearing, and Nora wonders if either of the men thought about that when they picked it. She wonders if they thought about how well it would fit Steve’s frame, either, or about just how- No. She isn’t going to think about Steve like that. She’d be lying if she said she didn’t notice, though.
Inanna raises an eyebrow, but seems to dismiss Dean’s comment for now. Later, no doubt she’ll want the story. She’s always liked stories. For now, wanting to get to the dancing part of the evening is perhaps keeping her on course.
Sam steps forward, the movement drawing Dean’s attention from Cas, and gestures at the expanse of empty warehouse in front of them, at the broken flooring and collapsed pillars and jagged chunks of masonry.
“What can you tell me about the angel? Or about the child? In terms of powers or character,” Cas asks.
“Yes,” Cas says, and waves a hand. “It’s difficult to understand from a human perspective. If you have time later, I’ll be happy to take you through it. It has some fascinating implications in mathematical terms. I think you’ll especially enjoy them, Val. In any case, it’s hard to make out what’s meant by the final lines, but it could be interpreted as the two of them having a child.”
She snapped back to the scene in front of her as Dean waved and the demons bowed, rose and vanished, leaving the huge chamber almost empty.
Sam looked much the same, but the pain in his eyes was enough to have Dean wanting to smirk. He didn’t. He was still enough himself, under it all, to want to spare his brother further pain.
He seems to run out of words, but Beth is by Dean’s side, resting a hand on his forearm as though she wants to be sure Dean doesn’t speak without thinking.
“Heavenly mercy killings,” Dean says. Sneers. “But they think pretty much any level of pain counts, so when I ran into one it was counting a girl breaking up with her boyfriend the same way it counted terminal illness.”
Dean flinches. And okay, that was a step too far. Still, Dean doesn’t shout or run or laugh it off. He goes very still, and Sam waits for him to unfreeze and speak again. It doesn’t take as long as he expected it to.
She could tell him he saved Beth, of course, but this feels like one of those moments where you have to pause and consider what you might be saying without meaning to.
“There weren’t any windows-” She stops, her mouth forming an O. “Wait. Wait. You jumped from…? Do you need a doctor? Is that why you weren’t walking right? I thought you were just, like, high.”
The blade was in his hand when he fought that creature. He still feels the sting on his palm, something which has only happened recently. He must have dropped it.
“I’ve had a few things pointed out to me,” Dean says, “and I’ve done a lot of thinking, and I owe you an apology.”
“We remember seeing a…a hazy blob of nothing,” Castiel says. “That’s more than I remember from before. Whatever power it has to confound our memories seems to be fading.”
“Bela,” Hannah said. She turned to meet Bela’s gaze, and the softness there was something Dean would take a while to get used to. “If anything happens to me, I want any choices like this to be yours. I have to give Dean the same courtesy.”
He registers the silence that falls after his statement, but he isn’t sure why the people around the table look varying levels of confused or pained. He doesn’t think he’s said anything to bring that sort of reaction. The next tablet continues the same topic and by the time Castiel has read them all he mostly has an appreciation for an angel trying to live among humans back before TV gave so many hours of material to work from.
“Dean,” he tries, “you’re my brother. Not my dad. You shouldn’t have had to look after me like you were my dad. And I’m grateful, I am, but I don’t want you to be my protector. I never did. I want you to be my brother. You don’t think that maybe some of our problems are Dad put that on you in the first place?”
If they get Cas to come back from this, Dean’s going to sit the guy down and have him explain every single thing about being an angel. They can trade, one human fact for one angel fact, until they’re both caught up.
“Well, you can’t change it,” Dean says. “So, I guess we just gotta make sure we look after Claire from now on, right?”
He stumbled back, his eyes wide, and glanced at the door. Dean saw him make the decision, almost called out to Hannah to stop him. The demon turned and ran.
Castiel folds himself up under the covers and imagines what life might be like if he weren’t broken.
“Yes,” Castiel says, because they are partners in their hunts, more so than any FBI agents can be to each other. “They’re very close.”
Before Dean could lay into Bela for praising demons bent on making Dean into a cult leader, Sam spoke up.
He must hesitate too long, because Val brushes past him and takes a seat on the other side of Cas. Cas looks up at the movement, and this time Sam is ready to pay attention. This time, he isn’t so thrown by walking in on Cas with three women that shock blinds him to the details.
“Dean,” he says, and waits until Dean meets his eyes. “I’ll come back. I promise.” He takes a breath, something he doesn’t need but feels the need for, and tries the last part of his conclusion. “I’ll come back to you.”
“We’re looking for something that’s taking people. Five so far. Your friends’ student, Ashley Daniels, was the third one. The first was some guy who’d been raving about being attacked by an alien. Far as we can make out, they all lost it somehow before vanishing.”
There might be just a shade of something satisfied in that, but it’s hard to hear it under the leaden weight of whatever it is Dean’s feeling. Sam used to think he was fluent in Dean, but he’s wondering if maybe his dictionary’s a little off. He seems to keep missing some of the nuances.
Time stills. It’s been dragging and racing for months now, and with no control by him. He sees her worry in the tension under her skin, the way she swallows as her gaze sweeps over him.
“Not if you won’t tell us,” Dean says. “For fuck’s sake, Cas. Just tell us what’s really going on with you! How bad is it? Are you sick?” A new thought hits Dean and he has to swallow against the burst of nausea. It’s not like Cas is great at naming his current threat-level. He might just not think it’s worth mentioning. “Are you…are you dying?”
“This is who you’ve brought? Wait, do you mean this is who you’ve been seeing? Really, Val? After what you said?”
“Can you stand?” he asks, because the boy can’t stay here all night. Castiel will guard him, if needs be, but he will make a poor guardian just now. “Can you get to help?”
“For the record,” he tries, “the way I feel about you is a good thing. All right? No disgust or anything, here. You mean a lot to me, Cas, no matter what you look like. Okay?”
He couldn’t even remember the last time he saw wingprints after an angelic death, but some part of him had long thought that would be the sign, the way he knew Cas was really gone from him for good, and he can’t seem to update his mental file on that one.
The look Steve throws his sister is one of such gratitude that again Nora feels she’s missed a step.
There might be some, still, under the mattress. Dean won’t approve, and neither will Val, but they aren’t here, and the ache in Castiel’s wings is growing deeper.
Because Dean got in the way. Sam sees it. He sees the times John raised his voice, sometimes his fist, and Dean was right there, in between them, facing off against John. He remembers Dean saying he’d already eaten as he handed Sam a sandwich of cheap bread and claiming he didn’t like something anyway when Sam complained he was still hungry and eyed up Dean’s portion. He sees it, and it isn’t anything new. He doesn’t know how it’s taken him this long to put it together.
“Yes. You gave me pamphlets. I read them,” Aidan says, but he says it like Riva’s worrying about the wrong things, like whatever the dangers are it’s irrelevant, and talking about them is wasting his time.
She watches as Sam guides someone else out of the car, only registering that it’s not Cas. He’s still missing, then. The sight seems distant, detached.
“You,” Val says, sleepiness giving way to a mis of lust and humor in her voice. This kiss presses to the corner of her mouth as Val’s fingers trail down her hip and over her upper thigh. “Gonna do you. You okay with that for a plan?”
She’s going to need to read some porn or watch a movie with a near hundred percent kill rate or something to get this sugary goo off her, but if he needs to hear it spelled out, then that’s what he’s getting.
Fear grips him, fear that, when he opens his eyes and shakes away the last of sleep, his limbs will fade. That he’s really still more asleep than awake, and he’s dreaming them. He hasn’t felt like an angel in so long. He doesn’t want to wake and have lost it.
Dean’s thoughts stall, fixating on that one memory, of Cas on his knees before another angel. Another memory lies behind it, of Cas sitting on a crappy motel bed, talking about ending his own life.
“Why are we taking everyone? You think it’s a good idea to take civilians anyplace we know this thing hangs out?”
As things are now, Sam’s not sure they shouldn’t get in the Impala and drive away. He doesn’t think they can try to take Cas away from his new friends, not unless the women reject him when the knowledge of what Cas is sinks in. There’s at least a chance for some stability here, and Cas needs that. No. Best for Cas to stay right here for the time being.
“And I guess, yeah, a bit of me is envious,” Beth goes on. “For a while there, I’d have given my left arm if it meant all the blame could go away and it would turn out Greg wasn’t…the way he was. That we could just get through it, and he’d want to change, and… Please, don’t think I’m upset with you, all right? I want you to be happy, Cas.”
A thin trickle of hope is all he can allow himself. Dean’s mood changes quickly sometimes. Castiel might still not be safe.
“You speak to me,” Val cuts in. Unless Cas shows he wants to join in, she’d rather he not have that voice aimed at him. Even now, knowing who he is, Val can feel the pull of the man. It must be worse for Cas. “And you better get it into your head that you’re not taking him with you. You get that? You can’t just show up and drag him back. He left. Deal with it.”
Turning his head, he closes his eyes. What the fuck is he doing here? Like Cas is going to sense him and come out. If Cas wanted to talk to Dean, he’d have got in touch. Not like Dean’s changed his number. He never does, not the one Cas has. It’s been the same for years.
“As much as I can remember of it,” Cas says, seriously. “As you can imagine, the nature of the event makes it hard to describe.”
She doesn’t seem to remember telling him she’s taking her boyfriend. The rush of gratitude sickens him. He shouldn’t be so needy, shouldn’t be so weak. This is what has been made of him, grateful for some sign of welcome from a woman he only knows because she came to warn him to stay away from her friend.
“Are you seriously asking me if…?” Dean trails off, his eyes narrowing and his mouth pulling into an ugly grimace. “Fuck. Is she right? Have I been abusing him?”
Spending time naked together, all pressed up against each other and working out new ways to, um, to interact, hasn’t changed all that much, it turns out. Cas can still be the same irritable, snarky bastard he’s always been, especially when he thinks Dean’s being difficult. That shouldn’t make Dean want to stop and pull the guy into a kiss right here in the street, but it does.
