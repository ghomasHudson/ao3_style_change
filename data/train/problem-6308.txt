Plus, if Tony was to someday become a super villain, Bruce will totally be on his mind to ya,e over the world with.
"How long has it been since you've slept?"Rhodey's voice knocks Tony out of his deep thought, making the younger man look up in alert, pushing his goggles up onto his hair, hair sticking in all sorts of angles due to motor oil and grease, on his face too. Dumm-E is whirling excitedly at the visitor, offering Rhodey a screwdriver as a welcoming gift that has the man cracking a smile despite the circumstances.
But then again, he can say that he's use to it, it would explain why he always gets this bubbling, unfamiliar feeling in the pit of his stomach every time that Rhodey says thank you for buying the pizza that week, or when Steve tells him that his work is impressive. He doesn't get that at home, he never has. Since the moment he was able to toddle and babble, Howard has been expecting great things, and in some ways he has achieved a son that has all the brains and good looks, but is still a fuck up in the eyes of a father.
This is a very late update, just like all of the other updates for the fics that I have published here and on Wattpad.
"I'll get a lift from 'Tasha."He informs, staggering off of the hard hospital bed that his mum had ushered him on whenever she spotted him sitting in the hallway, left by parametric's rim his oath staff to take care of. His injuries weren't life threatening for a doctor to be involved, and despite hospital rules about family aiding family, she had mended Steve herself.
"Well of course I am. You destroyed my home, you ruined Christmas and nearly destroyed your fathers company due to the bad publicity of his products."Maria speaks without as much as emotion in her voice, watching as Tony just shakes his head.
"I don't know where he lives."Steve frowns, closing his phone with a satisfying snap. Bucky sleepily raises his eyebrow at the blonde."Okay well I know that he lives in Long Island."
By the time that Tony re-emerges from the bathroom, hair brushed into a messy quiff with hair products he had found in the bathroom and in fresher clothes, there's less people than before. Phil has gone to work, Natasha had gone off and Thor had to be home for a family lunch.
"You know exactly what way, Tony."Her tone is firm, anger seeping through into words because Tony had once smiled at Pepper the way he had smiled at everyone he didn't trust, where his smile just couldn't reach to his eyes, where instead they look dull and tired. Tony has once smiled at Pepper like that and he had made a promise to never smile at her like that again.
There's a bubbling feeling of anxiety in Steves stomach whenever he gets to Tony's hospital room floor and he isn't sure exactly why. It's not as if this is the first time they've met, it's the second actually but whatever. He knows Tony, they're friends - they've had that conversation a lot of times - and they've been texting nonstop since Christmas.
"Thanks,"Rhodey can't help but to roll his eyes a little, because no more than 10 minutes ago was he studying for January exams and now he's on his way to New York to attend an Event to celebrate his best friend getting out of his hospital."I'll ring you before I get on the plane."
"It actually quoted 'breakfast' but I've never seen you eat anything but cheeseburgers before."There's a cup of coffee passed towards him as he rounds the desk so that they are no standing either side, a small smile etched onto his lips as he takes a sip. Black, two sugars. With the coffee cradled to his chest, Tony is picking up the sheet nearest to him on the desk, eyes skipping that of names and ages and landing on what his interest lies on. He's reading it, scanning his eyes over a couple more times before he looks up with threaded eyebrows of curiosity.
"I suggest you shutting up. Please."Tony tacts on at the last minute when he realises that Rhodey is his only hope of getting him from the doorframe to the glorious bed."Plus, I'm really not up for you seeing my dick. Not today."
His time lived on campus was what he would like to say, is a lot better than at home. Stark Mansion was too
"Alarming, I know. I've an incredibly good memory for the small details. Not so much for the important stuff, however."Tony is beyond hyper and he can't even blame it on the coffee he drank in the car over, or the one he bought at the Hospital entrance, or the one Strange gave him at the desk or even the one he's been sipping at in between rushed, rambled sentences because Tony has always been like this. "Right, where did I leave my- aha! Okay Mr Barnes, shirt off."
"Honey Bear!"Is the greeting that James Rhodes is met with the Second that he steps into Stark Mansion - and okay, sometimes he thought that Tony was over exaggerating on the size but now as he stands in the grand front hall, it's fucking massive - with his suitcase trailed behind him on the marble floor and a backpack slung over his shoulder.
"And this looks like another one of your silly, immature games, m'boy."There's a sly twist of his lips, as if this moment is something that he has been anticipating since the moment he left him stranded in that hotel room, their promise something to be broken because Tony never changes his habits and Stane knows all of his weaknesses.
So Tony nods his head, his shoulders slump, his guard goes down. And maybe it's the alcohol that still lingers in his system, or the day that he's had, or just how good that Tiberius Stone smells, but he relaxes. And he'll make a good evening out of his awful Day.
"Who cares for my eating habits, really? I think the problem is why are you here on Christmas Day?"Tony changes the subject, picking at a seam on his fluffy pyjama bottoms that were thick and comfy, keeping him warm.
This wasn't how Steve intended on spending the start of his Christmas break, he has planned on going home after the bus dropped him off near the supermarket close to his home and get changed into a fresh pair of clothes and then head out with his group, but of course that didn't happen.
"A brainiac? I'm insulted!"Tony exclaims loudly enough for Bucky to hear outside and for anyone in the front room of the house to also. Steves head pops up from somewhere behind the television, sunny blonde hair baby fine and soft looking and blue eyes wide as he looks in Tony's direction, something that unknowingly makes Tony's entire body run warm and fuzzy.
"I-No, y'know what, I'm not starting this again."Steve shakes his head, getting up from the seat at his desk so that he can dump the remains of his herbal tea down the sink and rinse its cup, eyeing Clint and the bottle of beer as he does so. "Isn't it sort of early to be celebrating."
"When you met him."Bucky answers sullenly, sulking by the door frame with his arms crossed over his chest and hair hanging by his eyes, freshly out of the shower.
"The coffee is fucking terrible."He breaks the silence very suddenly, removing his hands from his face, tears dried onto cheeks, eyes puffy and red, but at the moment he doesn't care as Peggy looks up, a little shocked at the transition but slowly melts.
"I'm sorry, I-"But Tony stops, his eyes fall upon Steve, Steve who usually looks at Tony with so much wonder and curiosity, head tipped to the side, lips pursed, eyes full of earnest and trust and honesty, full of adoration for all of his quirks, but never like this. There's a look of thunderous rage, hurt, betrayal,
Luckily enough, the burnt, rubbery flesh of his skin isn't as bad as Tony thought. Maria had managed to convince Howard to pay Tony's way further up the skin graft list which was a start, seeing as Tony didn't have to live with the rubbery flesh forever. There was harsh brushing scattering Tony's back and neck from the impact of the explosion sending him into the Liquor cabinet and numerous little cuts and bruises on his face.
"Manhattan, wasn't it? Banquet Dinner to help starving children, if I do recall."He goes on, taking a closer step to Tony who continues to stand tall, shoulders rolled back and chest puffed out in a way that makes the glow of his reactor stand further out, the metal rim sticking out through the expensive material of his shirt. Tiberius glances at it, for not even a second, but Tony has gotten so use to people dipping a look at his abnormality that he caught the millisecond glance. "Scotch on the rocks, yeah?"
"It is? Oh fuck, shit, how long was I- never mind, I'm sorry, go back to sleep I didn't mean to wake you up, go back to sleep, goodnight Steve, or is it good morning-"
And he sees it before he hears it, a face, a face that's so regularly on television screens and news broadcasts that Tony shouldn't even have hesitated, or stopped, or stared. But it's the face that flickers next to it, in a stand alone photo where she looks so young, so beautiful, so magnificently pretty, and witty and bright. And Tony knows it's bad because it's never really good, and when it's not bad, it's worse, it's terrible, disastrous, destroying, life shaping news that can make one collapse in on himself like a sand glass, pouring away into a tiny hole, a grain at a time.
?"It's directly pointed and Tony can see the way that Ty's entire body stiffens up, rolling his shoulders and
Steve doesn't say anything further, trying his best not to look down at Tony's chest but finding that he's unable too. He's too drawn to the glow, out of curiosity of why it is there and what it does to keep Tony healthy and alive. Although, he doesn't want to be a bother to ask Incase he causes Tony to panic about it.
that Rhodey would never hurt him, but it's the shock of the tension, the anger, the frustration, the way that Rhodey looks at him with clouded eyes and with a tensed body.
Tony's nerves immediately calm down with that statement that Steve is obviously not homophobic if two of his best friends are dating.
With a slow pace, the pair make it towards the grand hall that's only used for dinner parties and important business meetings that Tony is usually barred from. The atmosphere changes whenever they reach the opened doors, peering into the room almost shyly as if they're on the look out for a missing friend.
"Of course I ever liked him! From the second I laid my eyes on him I knew that he was hiding something and guess what, I was right!"Bucky is joyous, gleeful, smug as he throws his arms up in the air, a grin on his lips, a triumph tune in his voice because he was right! Everyone was so oblivious by Tony's shining personality, his charming grin, his flashy car.
Being good with people isn't on the top of Tony's agenda, and that's mostly for the fact that Tony Stark may be a social butterfly but that does
The television is on, bringing a sense of normality to Tony has to enters the living area of decorative chaos, rustling in the kitchenette off to the left, a toaster popping, a kettle boiling, a voice humming along to a tune on the radio. Tony hates cable television, especially their news broadcasts and he's about to find the remote, switch the channel, find something of better interest for a hungover Sunday, Friday, Wednesday, weekend, weekday, day of rest.
Tony's nausea seems to disappear immediately at the sight of Dumm-E whirling and beeping towards him, holding a fuzzy tennis ball in his claw and eagerly pushing it at Tony's stomach, nearly knocking Tony off of his feet but he's learning how to control his strength which is progress. It makes Tony's entire heart swell, a silly sort of smile to appear on his face because even if this 'bot tortures him, he's his baby.
Steve wasn't exactly the person that Tony thought would be digging him out of the mountain of bits and bobs he buried himself in, especially seeing as Tony was probably One hundred and Ten percent that Steven Grant Rogers hated Tony just like a good percent of the world did. Seeing as neither man could see eye to eye on things, and seeing as Tony isn't one on making good first impressions he was pretty surprised when Steve actually asked him to accompany him.
"And I wasn't family enough."This time, however, Tony's voice catches in those words, caught, stuck, constricted in such a way that it nearly breaks the dam of tears that have been threatening Tony for an awfully long time now. He tips his head towards the table, closing his eyes if only for a second only for when they open, for his vision to blur, pushing his face into his hands if only to hide his tears as frustration instead.
"Being killed by Natasha's Thighs? Sweet."Bucky smirks, watching the way that Steve rolls his eyes and takes another drink of the alcoholic drink. It was no secret of the on going sex that the two have been sharing for the past year, and it was nothing more than that despite everyone's poking and prodding. Steve thinks otherwise, but whatever.
"Ouch."Rhodey makes a pained sound in sympathy. It took no genius to know that Tony didn't get on well with his parents, especially his father that Tony barely spoke word about, and if he did, it was always in babbled sentences in the middle of the night after Tony was shook awake from a nightmare.
"I'm going to die, I'm going to die! Fuck!"Both Steve and Bucky are turning their attention towards the family room window, just in time to see Clints body fall from the roof and onto the thick pile of snow that lay infront of the large window, scream and all. There's a short second of silence before he's popping up from the pile of snow, covered in white from head to snow and his right ear hearing aid dangling from his ear."Steve! Buck! Get the fuck out here, man."
Which isn't exactly a lie because for a solid month whenever he was being extra bratty, Howard had cut off his credit card and he had to work for his money. Luckily enough, as a loyal and regular customer, the campus coffee house has offered him a job until he needed it. As much as Tony hated the idea of working, the perks of getting free coffee and working with incredibly cute - older - guys was totally worth it.
Steve is quick with getting out of the car after that, standing on the pavement as he watches Natasha speed off in her newly furnished car, yelling something about meeting up for drinks in a day or twos time out the window as she goes. He isn't sure if she means it or not but he'll make sure to keep the next couple of days open just in case, not that he has many things to be getting on with himself.
"It seems that you're getting back to good health."Tony can identify that this man isn't American, his voice is laced with an accent that is still thick on certain letters but has probably lived a long enough life in the states. He's a balding man, with rectangular silver glasses perched on the bridge of his long nose.
They had made eye contact on more than one occasion, they had kept eye contact throughout Tony's eulogy if only for the fact that to guilt her, to make her see of who he was becoming, who he had become so far. He had spoken of Maria, his mom, only in his eulogy which had been short and though he hadn't said much, he hadn't much to say, but it hadn't meant Tony didn't love her, because her death had been the result of empty liquor bottles countless times.
His stomach twists in guilt whenever he thinks back to Tony, the teenager he had ran out on only because Steve was kind of disturbed by the blue ord that the tee anger sported in his chest. Steve didn't even stay long enough to see if his words and actions affected Tony, to see if the teenager was okay because it was clear that he wasn't, from the way he seemed upset whenever Steve was caught staring.
And God did Tony miss the coldness of New York, he missed the way New York seemed to smell; of street vendors and sewers; and when did he ever think he would admit that? That he missed such a city that only ever brought him tragedy and pain? Of a city so full of dull, grainy weather and loud traffic? But he did. Tony missed how New York shone at night, he missed how loud the city that Tony grew up in was, he missed dreary dark clouds that he use to watch roll into the city through his Warehouse window. He missed New York
"Well I'm not going to argue with that."Bruce shrugs from his place beside Clint in the backseat, half listening to the conversation as he works his way through a bunch of papers in his folder. Bruce looks up, pushing his glasses up his nose."Although, it would help your grades if you'd at least
Rebecca was somewhere in the house, her bedroom most likely testing out the new make up set that she had managed to plead for, Rose had been out down for a late nap to be awoken in time for desert and Mrs Barnes was doing the annual family phone calls for the entire family, caught between a conversation with a distant aunt on how much the kids have grown. Steve likes this atmosphere, it was family, one he was involved with even for just a short time.
"And work for you? No thanks. I'd rather stay here."He jesters to the room behind him, empty, quiet and clean. Tony sucks his teeth, remembering just how long ago it was that they have properly spoke. They were both busy people and Bruce being the introvert to Tony's extrovert made things a lot more difficult for them to spend time together. He pushes a load of paper to the side of the work bench, perching himself on the corner as he gives Bruce his undivided attention.
Sometimes when Tony is feeling down on his luck and isn't too busy, Tony likes to take up cases in the paediatric ward, sorting out kids with disabilities, from underdeveloped limbs at birth to children who have unfortunately lost ability of their limbs due to accidents and illnesses. As much as Tony doesn't want to have kids of his own, he sure does love them. He loves their fascination and wonderment, or the way they smile in gratitude and amazement when they take a first step with a new prosthetic, or move a finger for the first time. It was amazing.
The Chevy was a gorgeous model, early 1950's, a chipped baby blue and with original cream leathered seats. Tony had bought it off a kid in Queens whose uncle had recently died, looking for an extra couple of bucks off a car he had no interest in that was just collecting dust and rust. It gave him something to do, got his hands dirty, got his head cleared, and it also gave DUM-E something to do too by collecting tools.
, Rhodey."Tony looks up at the man, his face fallen is shock and disgust of what he had to endure. Of course it didn't happen every day, because not every day did he eat, and sometimes Steve came up with cheeseburgers which was excellent but still.
"I am, Sir. He's a pleasure to be friends with, I can't imagine being friends with anyone else but him."Rhodey replies with honesty in his voice because he can't imagine his life without Tony now that he managed to wiggle himself into his life. It was endearing, and he loves Tony with all of his heart In a way he didn't think he'd be able to.
"He disillusioned you. He wanted you to know him in his own manmade light, the softer, friendlier perspective rather than the harsher reality that he actually is. You knew
So far, Tony had been casted off to the basement when he wasn't forced to sit in Board Meetings or attend banquets or to snort cocaine off of the white marble counter tops, that in which, not being something he had been
"That's nice,"Tony hums, looking at his hand which was attached to the IV drip."Would it be okay to have your number? So we can stay in contact during the Hollidays? It's okay if you don't what to remain in contact, I get that, I just thought, Y'know maybe you'd like to text or something."
"Lucky guess,"Bucky grumbles, flicking a piece of eraser across the classroom and successfully hitting Clint in the face with it, watching how Clint whips his head around in confusion, trying to figure out what had hit him and who it was. Clint, despite the fact that his hobby and possibly future career is in dire need of being constantly socially away, is very much an oblivious, slow mess. He is the only person that Steve knows who could sense that you were coming his way 2 miles away but would jump out of his skin if you tapped him on the shoulder from behind.
Or how Clint, even after Tony had beat him continuously at Mario kart, still dragged Tony into the kitchen so that they could steal the best of the snacks before Thor came and demolished it all. Everyone seemed to be well too nice to Tony, sweet and generous with their actions, offering him food, letting him get involved in their conversations, giving him a blanket to sleep under incase he got cold.
"I'm not joking!"Steve says a little too urgently, noticing the way that Tony's voice flatters in unsureness. Tony flinches at the loud voice, finding himself reeled back to reality."That's really fucking impressive, I mean, like
Tony grew up in a household where marriage was toxic, that it was only used to breed an heir. Tony has no wish to carry on the Stark gene, not when he has seen what the outcome comes to; of alcoholism, paranoia and addiction. Tony wouldn't wish anyone to have even an ounce of Stark in them because intelligence is marvellous on its own, but it's a curse when coupled with toxic and death-dealing traits such as that that Tony is riddled with.
"Doesn't that saying only work for women?"Tony rhetorically asks, fully expecting the glare that Steve gives him."Or so I hear?"
Bucky, Tony, Steve etc are all 16 going on 17 or 17 (in Steves case ((it really depends when their birthday falls)). Rhodey is 19-20.
When Tony reawakens, he's being talked to by an army doctor. He's tall and broad and stony faced but he seems to talk to Tony with at least a sliver of empathy because Tony may have been shaped for war but it wasn't a physical war. It was a war of ability, of business and manipulation and spiralling mental health. A mental, realistic war. He wasn't built for combat, he was only human, after all. A broken, human blessed with a brain that makes him useful to keep around but cursed with a bountiful of bad luck.
"Well I hope it is,"She sighs, shaking her head at the teenager that stands before him, looking a lot healthier than what he was just weeks ago. It's always been a hard position as a nurse, to see children and teenagers alike be rushed into emergency, especially with having a teenager herself sitting at home.
It's not healthy, of course, and even with his extra deformity, Tony is going to change his angle with some healthy eating and meditation, he's very fine with his heavy lifting and daily intake of caffeine thank you very much. He's gets lost in his work, school work and his own little side projects and builds that he does on the side like mixing up motor cycles or fiddling with new ideas, and it's during one of these binges that he gets a visitor.
."Steve glares at everyone but especially at Tony for dragging along the conversation. Tony just shrugs his shoulders and snickers into his can of soda because when Steve tries and acts all father like it's actually kind of amusing."And the reason why nobody remembered Hitler as an artist is because he couldn't even draw a stickman."
"You going to love me and leave me, Doctor Stark?"And he looks so normal, so in his element that if it wasn't for the fact that James was visibly missing a limb, that you wouldn't think so in the slightest. So cocky and snarky and flirty and it weirdly makes Tony proud.
were the one that left when you saw the Arc Reactor and you were the one that came back so don't fucking stand there and act as if I was the one that came and flipped your life onto its head."Tony shakes with anger, fists trembling, body jittery as he marches after Steve who pauses, turns sharply on heels.
The next time Tony is conscious, he's in an air carrier, hooked up to all sorts of beeping machines, a trail of wires coming from his body, his mouth dry and feeling like it's stuffed with cotton wool. It's such a familiar moment, of waking up from a deep unconsciousness, of a beeping heart monitor and aching from head to toe. It's so familiar and Tony feels like he's reliving the explosion all over again but somehow, this feels so much worse.
Going back during the Holidays always helped like a chore, of course he loved to see his Mother - if she was even at the Mansion - and Jarvis - the man that has done so Much Tony and Tony could not be more grateful of - but it felt liked effort. That he had to go home, with a smile on his face and act like things were okay, to lick up Howard's Ass - and then receive backlashes for disproving his authority.
"I used your shampoo, I hope you don't mind."Tony decides to tell Steve, maybe hoping to get a reaction that Tony can deem good enough out of him, only to receive a snort from James instead.
speech, but it's basically the same."A weird sort of smile seems to ghost Tony's lips when he talks about Rhodey, even just thinking about all of the death threat talks that he's gave to so many people in the short time that he and Tony have became best friends.
to look after every person he met, despite the fact that he started off in life as a sickly babe who could be blown over by the slightest of colds. He developed, just like anybody else, and with that so did his need to look after his friends, his mother and anyone he thought needed his help.
Being body conscious is something that Tony is overly familiar with and watching the way that James seems to sink into himself, avoid looking at Tony or at his arm, almost trying to ignore his deformity suddenly makes Tony so much more conscious of his own, glowing orb of a deformity, nestled in the middle of his chest.
"Dude, it's fine. It's fine."Tony reassures, his voice softening as he speaks but not meeting Steves eye."If it stops glowing, it means it stops working, if it stops working, the magnet won't stable the shrapnel that is aiming for my heart meaning that I'll die a very slow but painful death."Tony says as if it's the most simplest of things to spill from his mouth.
The Warehouse ( a nickname that Pepper had once quoted without a slight bit of fondness and therefore became the name for Tony's house ) had been a work in project for many years until Tony finally kicked himself in the ass to completing the project, sick of sleeping in Stark Industries workshop with a crooked neck. The Warehouse was equip with JARVIS throughout as  trusty surveillance and included three main floors, the main floor, Tony's floor and the underground Workshop which lead to Tony's private garage.
"Must've owed God a few favours, I guess."He cracks a smile, going to dip his sunglasses  to flash her a wink but forgetting about one of his faithful new injuries that Tony can surely add to the growing list of '
"Yes I know that, Captain Obvious."Tony rolls his eyes the minute that his glasses are perched on his nose."But I'm telling you that it was annoying as fucking hell, especially when it's the only thing you hear for 8 days straight, 24 hours a day. So I'm changing it."
"I spend most of my day working out with Clint, spearing, boxing, weights. To build up my strength."He finally speaks up after what has to be a couple of silent minutes, flexing the fingers on his remaining hand as he speaks.
As much as Howard sees his son as a failure - and really, it can't be seen as Tony's fault because the only reason he has the campus label of a manwhore is because he wants to rub it into Howard's face - he can't disagree with the fact that Tony is a genius. It would be said to be the only good thing about Tony from the eyes of Howard, that he has a brain in his head and ideas in his mind that blow Howard Starks ideas out of the ocean.
"Oh."And Tony swears he almost pales, hands clammy by his sides as he averts his gaze from Steve's so open, so earnest eyes that Tony swears that he could get lost in if he stares into them for too long.
your fault."It's mocking, of course, because Tony has lead his life believing and being told that everything is his fault, in manners that don't show him off in a good light and make him out as the spoilt little brat that the media loves to portray him as."And I'll fix this, for a price, however."
"I may be deaf, but I'm not dumb. Who are you texting?"He asks, resting his chin on Steves shoulder and peering at the phone that Steve is so desperately trying to hide away from prying eyes."Is it the guy you're gonna meet today?"
And okay, Steve may be your local hero who was ready to climb a tree to save your damn stupid cat or run to the local supermarket just because you forgot milk, but that didn't mean he didn't get into some sort of trouble. Bucky has had to drag Steves ass out of a handful of fights he has caught himself in, busted up in the face and bruised in the torso.
"Because you're a social butterfly and have a prettier face to give bad news with."Strange quirks,  pausing to watch as Tony fixes the glasses on the bridge of his nose, a quirky white frame that holds it glass, clip his name tag to the breast pocket of his long sleeved black shirt. The blue of the Arc reactors light is dimmed by the black out shirt he wears underneath, but it does nothing to hire it completely.
"Yes, yes, I know that."He cuts him off just like he had moments before, sounding a bit irritated."But as much as you boast about how
"Gosh, Ty, don't look so upset, people might actually think you don't care about me."Tony bypasses the blonde on his way into a lecture that he's been signed up to, something about Biomechanics that had sparked his interest after Bruce went on an hour long talk about it to him that night at Steve's. Tony could honestly have sat their for hours and listen to Bruce talk about paint drying and he wouldn't listened, more so that Bruce looks like the type of guy not to open up much and another so that Tony liked the intelligent company.
."Tony says it firmer this time, each word punctuated, harsh, hard."For 10 years you never answered my phone calls, or postcards or even send me a fucking birthday card. For 10 years you
He knew his mum was going to flip shit when she spots her son in a hospital bed, nursing a broken nose and bandaged up chest. He was going to ruin the annual Christmas photo that the Rogers and Barnes usual took on Christmas Eve.
"Steve."Tony's entire body jerks up, his head spinning, his vision blacking out, his limbs moving at a frantic rate as he tangles himself in the bed sheets, thumps against the floor. There's no time to dwell on the pulsing pain in his head, the swooshing of nausea in his stomach, up to his chest, throat, mouth, as he gulps it down and hops around the room because he
Dum-E whirls and beeps in happiness as Tony snatches the thermal container out of his bots claw and he begins to spin in circles of excitement when Tony brings the coffee up to his lips and seems to take a sip of it. The liquid in the container is closer to the texture of dirt than actual coffee and Tony has to force a smile onto his lips with a content sort of hum just to keep Dum-E happy enough to race off to do something else while Tony spits the coffee out into the bin, the container as well.
Getting out of the car, Steve thanks Natasha for picking him up and dropping him off, Natasha driving away with a beep of her horn. Steve finally turns to walk up the drive whenever Natasha safely leaves the street, fishing his keys out of his pocket and stepping into the house. The house is freezing, Steve giving a tight shiver as he enters and locks the door behind him, kicking off his trainers.
In the will, Tony is majority shareholder, if only by a percent more than the board put together and a lot more of a percentage above Obie too, which Tony finds hilarious. However, despite his shareholder position and the company being left in his name, the perfect wonders of small print entitles Stane, Obadiah to head Stark Industries in the name of Howard Stark as business partner and maturity outwaying the likes of Tony's.
"She'll be good for you too, Steve."Tony adds quietly, watching how Steve seems to alertly look over at Tony and it's almost as if Tony can see all of the emotions in Steve's baby blue eyes, the fear, the anxiety, the sadness, the ever growing defensiveness but Tony straightens up, clears his throat as he taps absently at his StarkTab. "I'll be back in 27 days. He'll have that arm in no time."
Thankfully, tony doesn't have a thing against using other peoples bathrooms which makes for a quick shower, not dwelling under the water or scrubbing harshly at his skin like a usually shower, but he does make sure to use Steve's shampoo, rubbing it into his hair. He smells of Steve, of freshly cotton sheets, the way that the wind blows on a windy spring day, of laundry detergent and Tony wishes he could bottle his scent.
By the time that Pepper eventually used her emergency override protocols over JARVIS to inform Tony that he was currently
"Ignore him, it's what he does. I'll talk to him."Steve has to suppress a sigh but he doesn't hold back on the roll of his eyes. Bucky has always been that type of friend, the one that goes out of his way to make anyone new who gets close to his best friend as uncomfortable as possible. Steve was use to it by now because every single one of their shared friends have went through the same treatment, Tony just seems to be getting it rougher than the rest had.
"Phil has enough to do."Steve frowns, lines creasing at his forehead as he hunches his shoulders because he suddenly feels rather guilty for leaving Bucky alone at the hospital cause if he had stayed they would've shared a cab. But if he
"Fiddling,"Tony replies, licking his lips as he works."It kept making this annoying beeping sound which was driving me up the fucking walls."Tony mutters, wiping the back of his left hand over his eyes to wipe away some tiredness that was making his eyes droop, but he wasn't going to give in to sleep.
"And you are. Your friends mean no harm, I mean okay I know that James hates me and Natasha is a little unnerving but it's fine, they're fine."Tony shrugs his shoulders, opening the sods cam and taking a drink from it.
The bedroom door closes behind him and suddenly, Tony's back is pressed flat against the wooden door, hands braced on the smooth wood, his heart hammer in his chest, feeling it in his chest, his throat, hearing it in his ears as it starts to
"Maybe Tony will be good for him. Have himself a science buddy now that Betty is away. What do you think, Stevie?"Bucky looks at Steve who seems to be caught staring at the two, more jealously flaring in his stomach whenever Tony's eyes light up in awe at something that Bruce has said, followed by a laugh.
"Oh he will, he thinks I'm cute."Which was an understatement because Tony has seen the way that Strange has looked at him, with deep adoration and respect, the way he would enclose Tony from behind if he was reading at a counter, protective and soft. It didn't make Tony tense, it made him feel safe and goddamnit, Tony loves it but hates it.
"Exactly,"Tony chimes, falling into the singular bucket chair with his legs draped over the arm rest, glasses pushed up onto his forehead and hair."You gotta have the balls to ask me out on a date, not just assume."
"Would you? These drugs are making me weak and sleepy as fuck, I can barely keep my eyes open nevermind lift this back."Tony sighs sleepily, falling back onto the pillows with a heavy grunt. The pillows were obviously from home, soft to lay on and silk in touch.
He never really finds out what he missed from the Biomechanics lecture, which is a shame, but instead he heads down to his Workshop that is situated among half a dozen other highly equipped ( but not as impressive as Tony's ) workshops and labs of the sort. He's greeted by the comforting smell of motor oil, the delightful sight of his messy but messy-in-the-sort-of-way-where-I-know-where-everything-is workbench and the loud excitable beeps and whirls of Dumm-E who is urgently trying to tug himself out of his charging workshop.
Thor is possibly bringing Bruce with him, I'm not sure, and Bucky lives across the road but he'll be the past one here, I'm sure of it."
"I have connections. And older friends which helps."And that's a bit of a stretch, because they aren't his friends, their his fuckbuddies of the night, the laps that his ass will make home for for the rest of the night but that's as friendly as people get when they're in college.
Stark House is so much prettier than Stark Mansion, in so many different ways. It's newly furnished, with modern decor that decorates each room and surrounded by windows, and bright, natural light that gives the entire house a beautiful, handsome, gentle vibe. The house itself is positioned on a cliffside, overlooking the beautiful private white sand beach below and the dark blue waves of ocean that stretches out for miles and miles, a perfect view with a perfect sunset every evening and sunrise every morning.
Tony's hair is still a little damp, dark hair a curled nest on his head and his glasses folded over the collar of his overly thick hoodie with the MIT crest printed onto the front of it. Despite the smile on his face, Tony is looking a little uneasy for a reason that Steve wants to know but not enough to ask him.
"Picasso' paintings focused on cubism, collage work if you will. I focus more on still life or realism."Steve mutters bashfully from his place in the doorframe of the connection to and from the livingroom and kitchen. Tony bites his lip at the way that Steve brushes all over, it's adorable how bashful he can be.
It was so lifting to see that Tony wasn't letting the Arc Reactor get in the way of his shining personality, he'd been up the day he'd awoke, fiddled and upgraded everything in his hospital room and still managed to charm the nurses and wiggle his way into Sarah's Rogers heart with those coffee brown eyes and sleep ruffled hair.
"This Dinner is for you, set up by your Father and I to show how happy we are of your recovery. You are attending. Some of your Fathers business associates will be there, you will be on your best behaviour."
thing, it's just an annoying thing. Why can't the men in my life be straight to the point? Life would just be so cut easier if Phil just told me I can't have a dog because I'm deaf."
Dramatically, Clint is setting them on the coffee table with a clank, huffing a breath as he pulls the bag of marshmallows forward and settles into Natashas warmth seeing as she's the only human in the room that isn't being mean to him.
And sometimes, Tony would like to think that the man that his mother married was not how he turned out to be, that he had once been charming and handsome, sweeping ladies off of their feet with a charming smile and a flirty comment. A man that didn't spend all his free time drinking until a slumber, or shouting slurs across an empty house to a son who has done nothing in life but try to live up to his fathers expectations, and in which he failed to do.
Flopping onto the sofa, Steve pants for air, his face tinted red from sweat and the icy wind that had blown into his face for the good part of an hour, nose button red and ears numb. Bucky doesn't say anything and neither does Steve, for a while, and so he sits and pants for air while Bucky sits and munches on chips that he had defiantly stolen out of Steve's cupboard until the blond finally speaks.
But he's going to step out into the open - for the first time since god knows when, Tony has lost count of how long he's been here - and have cameras shoved into his space, that ever so famous fake smile plastered back on his pretty space and that Stark charm oozing out of him. He's going to have to make a show, probably pushed into a Stark Charity event so that Howard can show everyone that his son isn't dead and then have his ass beaten for
"All of you stop shouting or get out!"Natasha threatens, she slams on the breaks which makes everyone pull forward in their seat, Bruce grabbing the back of Clints jacket before the blonde is thrown through the front wind screen of Peggy. The wind is taking out of everyone, forcefully slumping back into their seats as the car sits on the edge of the road.
Steve had become haunted, a ghost floating above the empty husk that was his own body, his own mind, his own conscious. But he had nowhere else to turn to because the friends that he had had gained their own lives, new and exciting and just as dangerous as his own has become, and he couldn't bare to be a burden to his mother, hardworking in her older age. And so, Steve toured again, and again.
Steve has never been more thankful for the Burger King that was situated directly in front of the hospital that his mum works in, because as much as Steve dislikes burgers - and fries, and anything that is deep-fat-fried-in-heart-attack-oil - having the Burger King there made it a lot easier for him to take it across to the hospital for Tony, as somewhat of a peace offering to the young teen.
"Enough about me! I'm sure you're sick of hearing about me, god knows the media loves to talk, I'm an interesting person after all. I want to hear about you! Tell me, Dr Banner, what has been going on in that beautiful mind of yours?"
And James' equally annoying glares. He ends up himself crosslegged on Steve's front porch, a cigarette dangling from his lips and a sense of regret echoing in his head.
He'd gone to the bathroom, James had told Tony when the Doctor had reentered the hospital cubical that was currently housing James Barnes, neither of them acknowledging the massive elephant in the room, that 'gone to the bathroom' was code for too many words and a much bigger situation. Barnes was not exactly looking at the familiar young doctor but not ignoring him either as he shifted every moment or so on the bed, it's paper crinkly with every shift of his body and without words, it remained an awkward reminder of words neither shared with one another all those years ago but has outrightly said aloud to other people.
"Tony-"Rhodeys sigh is cut short also, Tony's body cutting him at a shoulder as he runs past him and back to the direction of where they came.
"What the hell do you think you were playing at?"She's angry, she's furious, she's exasperated, she's...she's unbelievably breathtaking looking as she storms onto the runway from the car and Tony never thought he'd be able to look at Pepper again. But here she is. In all her glory.
"Of course I am."Rhodes rolls his eyes fondly, allowing himself to be dragged towards the stairs with his backpack and suitcase in tow."Doesn't your house have like 20 bedrooms?"
"I can't remember, was this supposed to be a weekend of just the two of us or did I spontaneously agree to having 300 of your
"I won't let that happen, they lay a finger on you and I'll sort them out."Tony declares, whining just a little whenever Sarah slips the blue prints out of his hands to set them on his hospital bedside table.
"I know that, just- you need to wear a damn bell."Tony sighs, a smile on his face to assure Steve that he actually isn't mad. Steve seems to visually deflate at the smile, a sort of fuzziness in his own chest because the smile that Tony is giving him looks and seems so
Did he take his medication? And did he bring extra medication incase he spends the night? And what if he spends the next day as well? What if he runs out? Fuck maybe he should just turn around and go back home because knowing Tony he probably forgot and if he forgot then the risk or something going dramatically wrong is very very high-
to be put into his place."Obie's voice is a sneer in his face, lip curled up, his large meaty hand curled around Tony's hair and jostling his head back and forth painfully."But Tony, I'm too late to save you this time."
Peggy hadn't came. Tony didn't expect it either, or maybe, he had, clinging to a hope and a dream that she hadn't forgotten about her old life and too busy with her new one to even spare the likes of Jarvis a second thought. He had thought more of her, but only because she was held on a much higher ground than any other role model in his life, and maybe that's Tony's fault for being so naive. Or Howard's fault for being so abusive. Or Maria's fault for being so neglectful. Or Peggy's fault being so absent. Or Jarvis' fault for being so fucking
He was kind of glad that now it's the Holidays and that he has 2 weeks to sleep and eat as much junk food as his stomach can desire. Although, of course, there's this essay he needs t write which he can do before going into the school but for now, he has time to sleep and eat and hang out with his dumbass friends.
"Look, I'll do your work and I'll fly you over. Free food? And free drink?"Tony tries to bargain, swiping his free hand across the screen of the prototype tablet to bring it to life.
"Way to sound force, Stark."Tony grumbles bitterly, scowling at his Mobile phone in anger, hoping that somehow a mobile tower will fall over and his message is unable to be sent.
, they have been talking for a while now."It's such a relief to know I'm not going to be trapped in this god forsaken place
"Tony Stark..."The name feel familiar on his tongue but he feels dirty when it passes through his lips, as if he doesn't have the right to say that name anymore, and really, it has been an awful long time since he has said it out loud. Sure, Steve has spent many months, many years thinking of that name, thinking of the face, the body, the way it talked and walked and swaggered, but to actually say the name is something entirely different.
, it had been the middle of the night that Steve was awakened from his restless, dreamless slumber by the piercing sound of his ringtone and the dull thud of vibrations against that wood of his old bedside table. Steve is still groggy with sleep, half of his body turned in his bed to reach for his buzzing phone and half ready to tell Clint to fuck off and get a taxi home when a voice beats him to it.
"Talk to me. Talk to me softly, about your day, about your week, I want to remember the sound of your voice."
"Buck, you're being a bit weird."Steve scoffs as he moves past Bucky's sulking frame in the doorway and moves towards the garage where the washing machine is.
"You need to put your profession before your personal life."Is all that he says and Tony's head jerks from where he was staring at a sticky note that has been pressed to a mug, '
It's not as if he uses his bedroom often enough anyway, it was simply his own type of storage unit to keep his blueprints under his bed and prototypes stashed into boxes. Even when it comes to longer breaks, Tony doesn't spend time at home unless his Mother insists and even at that, it's for a short amount of time that he spends it with Jarvis more than his actual mom.
"Hey,"Steve offers a smile, glad to see that Tony is up and about unlike last time. He had been complaining nonstop about the dreadful bedrest that his doctor had put him on after news had spread of his fixing up the hospital room."You're looking a lot healthier."
"I've never seen a boy so capable of looking captivating even in bad publicity photos."He trails off, taking a puff of the cigar that's between his own lips."You know the ones. The coming out a club at 3am with a 30 year old guy grinding on your ass. You're lucky I keep those sort of things away from your Father."
"C'mon, sweetheart, let your hair down."Ty sighs dreamingly, brushing off Tony's snark and advancing forward, the tips of his fingers brushing across Tony's smooth cheek. That smile creeps up upon Tiberius' lips, that same luring smile that had introduced Tony into the world of clubs and drugs and sex and it makes his stomach scrunch up in nausea.
. God, that just makes me shiver and quake! I think I just creamed."Tony makes a show of tensing and shivering, smirking and winking seductively to the screen.
Tony arrives 47 minutes later, 17 minutes later than he had told Strange and 13 before he had expected himself to actually arrive at the door of an office that only ever hosts the occupants of Doctor Stephen Strange and Doctor Tony Stark. Which, by the way, is not some type of alias that Tony had magicked up for himself in order to fit in with the professionalism that he often surrounded himself in, but was one that he earned through one of his countless degrees on the way of becoming the best of the best of the best.
"I've missed you so much."Tony is quick to collide into Rhodey's chest, arms wrapping around the older man in a desperate hug that he's been longing for for weeks.
. His finger tips brush it's sharp metal rim, finding it in himself that he still recoils at his own touch of the foreign piece on top of him, inside of him. It's not his fault that he cringes still, or that he flinched and recoils, that everyone on planet earth knows that Tony Stark has no limits but one; that you can't touch the Arc Reactor.
"Asshole."There's a glare in his eyes as he turns to look at Stephen, walking towards him once he has deemed himself presentable enough to meet with the patient. Tony is always one for first impressions, or second impressions of the first goes as one usually does when Tony is involved. A Stark Tablet is tucked under his armpit, slender and light and everything Tony needs, a separate tablet than the one for S.I related work and that of his personal tablet too.
"Maria."Howard approaches, touching Maria's arm gently as a sign to get her attention. Tony sucks in a breath, cursing the fact that he hasn't been able to avoid interaction with Howard but maybe he can just duck away, back away and pretend to never have been standing here."Anthony."
But Tony hates the thought of it because not only is he losing his best friend, but he's losing him to unknown territory that Tony is yet to become familiar with yet. Tony doesn't like the unknown, he doesn't like not knowing. It's much the same feeling that he has with Steve right now, or not knowing how he is, or what he's up to, or not being able to send him a quick message before bed or have him on speaker phone when he fiddles in the workshop. He doesn't
"Fine, whatever."Tony waves his hand a bunch of times, mulling it over for seconds more before he's sitting up in the rather large, very empty bed of his with wide eyes and a pulsing heart beat as he changes his mind."No, tell him no- or rather, tell him to postpone- Jesus I don't know."
"Tony?"Rhodey's voice calls loudly, causing Obi to flinch away and for Tony to say against the wall in relief that he had been stopped before anything further could happen. There's a curl of fear inside of Tony's stomach at the thought of being
"Stop being so panicky. Nobody will suspect a thing."Tony grumbles to himself as he turns on the ignition and starts to unbuckle his seatbelt. It's been a miracle that he's gotten this far without Steve suspecting a thing, but then again, Steve doesn't look like the type of person who would be interested in weapon manufactural - something Tony
"Rumours? Oh, no. The truth."Tiberius Stone casts his eyes down to the glowing blue of the Arc Reactor in Tony's chest, body so casually leaning in the door frame of the lecture hall that Tony is about to enter but his face so dark, so set and calm all rolled into once. Tony has to look up, stretch his neck a little, in that way that he has to do when talking to Steve but very different.
"Would you believe that I was saving some kittens from a burning tree?"A kiss to the other cheek. Tony swears he hears her take a whiff of his own aroma.
"I thought you weren't talking."There's a pause in her reply and Steve almost sees her hesitate, mull over the silence and the months and years it has been since Natasha and Bucky were on
It's Tony, there's no mistaking those brown eyes, that glorious smile, the way he seems to move with a grace as if the world owes him something in return for his existence, the one-in-a-billion Arc Reactor that's nestled in his chest. It's Tony who's pictured laying half naked on a bar top, Tequila shots off of his stomach and thighs, it's Tony who's videoed grinding on the crotch of a man at least 5 years his senior, it's Tony who's-
."We work jobs around MIT, in coffee shops, bookstores, the sort like that. We saved and that's our goal."
The diner, in which Tony only realises that Peggy had picked for its nostalgia feels that come haunting back at Tony, is more than busy for a Wednesday afternoon, the wind howling through the busted door, snow melting on the pavement and being kicked as slush by passing kids. Tony hates it here, not only because Peggy picked it, but because it's in New York, a city that Tony is growing to hate the more he spends time in.
"Don't play this game because honestly, you're not very good at it Steve."Steve flushes at her tone of voice, suddenly feeling very embarrassed that he even tried to take on Natasha and her knowledge, knowing very well that he is the one in the wrong."You can't stand in the way between Bucky and his future, Steve, no matter what history you have with Tony. It's being selfish."
it. It's a feeling of fear that's been buried deep, unknowingly knowing of the troubles that Tony Stark brings and he's ready for it.
But he pushes down the guilty, self-loathing part of himself that rears it's ugly head during random parts of his day, when he's away on a jog or with his arm draped over Natasha's shoulders as they watch a film on the couch. It makes him tense, it makes him feel rotten, it makes him think that maybe he shouldn't have been so filled with smugness and eager to gloat that Tony,
"Tones."Rhodey grins whenever he spots Tony dashing down the grand steps, skipping two at a time and dressed in a tank top and dirty jeans, obvious that he was working on something in his room before the old man arrived. His hair is a mess of curls, forming a nest on top of his head and something that's only familiar when the younger man is just out of the shower or woken up.
Shamelessly, Tony had made himself right at home the first time he had visited the Rhodes household, bundled up with blankets and ushered in front of the fire the Second he came in front the snow blizzard outside. He was a people pleaser and a damn charmer, and Rhodey would've been jealous of affection his mother was giving to Tony but really, it made him happy that Tony was getting the motherly affection and attention he knew he deserved.
Because Bruce was not only smart, he was intelligent, a sort of intelligence that Tony has ever only been able to glimmer at during those deep, workshop dives where the sleeping part of his brain stirs just a little to allow Tony to finish a project, an invention, an equation, to remember where Tony had left his mug of coffee. Bruce was beyond
"Yes you fucking should've."The voice is muffled behind scarred hands, mumbled through chapped lips, caught between blubbered hiccups and choked tears. And really, what times are Tony talking about when she
"I- Sorry. I'm just worried, y'know? This is such a big thing and what if Buck backs out in the next 27 days and does what he always does, it worries me. He worries me. I know you're doing a lot, I'm sorry."And the thing is, Steve truly does look and sound like he means it. The I'm sorry sounds real, genuine, truthful, it doesn't sound forced and Tony thinks that's the thing that shocks him the most because it may not be the apology he initially deserves, but it's still an apology.
"Right,"Tony hisses through his teeth momentarily, turning his head to the right to look out of the grand window that stretches from ceiling to floor, wall to wall and overlooks the Hudson River. JARVIS is right, of course, the weather is miserable and Tony frowns at the sight of angry clouds and a greyed river so early in the morning."Do I have anything else planned for the day?"
"True that."Phil and Natasha Salute, raising their mugs before taking a drink of the warm beverage that goes all the way to their bones.
"Funny."A smile makes its way to Tony's lips and it's not entirely fake either. An ache seems to form somewhere deep within Tony because just a measly couple of seconds of Bruce's company has made Tony realise just how lonely he has been.
He didn't expect her to answer anyway, she rarely does nowadays and that's okay, Tony knows that he's busy with her job since her promotion, but it does still hurt that Tony seems to be the only person that reaches out and never receives a reply in return.
"Steve!"Tony near enough lets out a giggle, covering it with a sort of snuffle of a snort instead, taking another bite of his disappearing cheeseburger. He talks with his mouth full,"Stop panicking, I-I'd like to be your friend, I would really."
"It's so good to see you,"Maria whispers, pulling away from the hug but moving her hands to place on either side of Tony's slowly healing face. The scars were healed over and the bruises fading but he was still tender."I was so worried, Anthony."
"I have nothing to apologise for."Steve is suddenly offended, taking a step back as if he's been physically blown.
Tony falls back into his usual college routine, one that truly does play with ones sleeping and eating habits ( in which he sleeps none and 'eats' caffeine ) and resorts with Rhodey having to drag him by the scruff of his neck into a shower after his clothes is stained with the unusual mixture scent of motor oil, coffee and BO.
"Um, I'm looking for someone."Steve admits, watching how his mom walks by him with a raised eyebrow, almost walking backwards so that she can still speak to her son."I'm visiting someone."
Because Tony can't bare the sight of him, not now, not ever. But what Tony wants and what Tony gets is a totally different matter as he has his body bent over a reception counter, making himself seeming to be occupied with work but really trying to regulate his breathing, the heartbeat in his throat, the sweat on his brow.
Because then it becomes real, much how it became real to see him int he flesh, standing and talking and moving his hands as he spoke, for his chest to rise with every breathe, for that Arc Reactor to glow that continuous blue that reminded everyone that he was still alive. That was real, that was something that actually happened, and Steve is still in awe of it so. And goddamnit, does he feel 17 again and flustered and angered.
"Oh please, nobody calls me Dr Stark. People seem to think if they start calling me by my Dr title that it'll undermine my father."Tony has rolled his eyes, setting his empty tumbler onto a passing tray. Howards old associates preferred not to call Tony but anything more than his name, to call him Doctor would just be insulting to Howard's memory. It would make it out that Tony was in some way shape or form
"Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It's where I live, technically, I'm a student there. Studying Electrical Engineering."He speaks as if Steve should know and maybe Steve
You could say that this, Tony getting into trouble, started when he was young and it just seemed to get worse as he got older. It started with the simplest of things, stealing a cookie when Jarvis wasn't looking or maybe hiding Anna's purse whenever she left it in the kitchen, and okay, you could say that was Tony being Tony, a boy just being a boy. It was when he got older, started school, graduated high school and got into MIT that his trouble really started to alert everyone.
"Tony, are you okay? Are you hurt?"The urgency is still there but the breathlessness has faded, giving Tony the impression that Steve had been running to answer this phone call.
Sleep is something that Tony has never been ab,s to get the hang of, of course it wasn't as if he was an insomniac or had nightmares that made it unbearable for him to sleep, he just couldn't sleep and it has always been a problem. Ever since childhood, his set bedtime never meant a thing to Tony, being tucked into bed at a reasonable time would only resort to Tony awaking not even 3 hours later, wondering the halls for some sort of entertainment.
"Hey! Peggy is a healthy girl and there's hundreds of mileage left on her, she's going to be around for a long time."Natasha and everybody else hopes, seeing as Peggy is this only means of transportation for late night McDonalds or when coming back from a party. They all pitch in to pay for gas and repairs and despite all the money they would try and scrap together they wouldn't be able to afford a new car.
"Here's a towel for after your shower."Steve has it already into Tony's hands before the teen can protest. The towel is fresh out of the dryer, soft and smelling of that laundry detergent that had tainted Steve's sheets.
get into any sort of trouble before Christmas but here we are, in the same place with you injured and another Christmas photo ruined."Sarah Rogers fumes, trying her best not to flip out and break her sons nose any further as she secures a piece of medical tape over his nose.
"None of that is his fault."He suddenly finds himself defending a guy that he had shoved out of his life, snarled and commanded to leave his home."Stark Insurance is saving Buck's life."
He had been dragged to view various toys, make up sets, paint supplies, books from the minute breakfast had finished until the traditional Christmas Dinner was being served at 4 in the afternoon. He had been set in between Bucky and Rachel, with one ear being filled with absolute  garbage about how Barbie is way better than Bratz and the other the swear of how embarrassing the Barnes family is.
Steve hides the fatty food In his backpack, hoping that the insulation with hopefully stop the food from getting cold as he starts to walk towards the hospital after exiting Burger King. He places the milkshakes carefully in his bag, hoping not to jostle too much. He has his hands shoved deep into the pockets of his old jacket, a ridiculous - but made with love - knitted beanie on his head with a matching scarf around his neck, both bright with a rainbow of colours.
"Go on,"Tony had turned to look at Pepper who had remained unmoved, unsure, as she stood in Tony's workshop with strict instructions to drag Tony out by the ear and into a shower, changed and off to gala event by 7:30."Say
"Who are you?"And his voice; emotionless, monotone, dull, blunt. It's so unlike Steve, it's not Steve. Tony encrypts the question, he knows the answer that Steve is looking for.
Sarah sends him off with a cautious kiss on his cheek, patting his forearm to send him off, telling him that she'll sign him out and that he's free to go.
Bruce takes a moment and Tony knows it isn't because he doesn't recognise the patient, because he had just had drinks with him that previous night, but because he isn't quite sure what to say. Tony rocks back on his heels, tries to make himself look busy as Bruce remains quiet, rereading the profile, taking a good hard look at Tony, sighing loudly as he sits back in his chair and recollects himself.
"Yeah, I know, but teenagers are so ill-mannered and basic. You find one person that likes punk rock and then there's like a thousand more and they all claim to be a certains bands number one fan."
"Of course!"Steve grins, setting his cup down and fishing his phone out of his pocket. A flip phone, but a phone at least. He didn't use it as often as one would use a phone, mainly just to text or phone because hey, that's what a phone is for, right?
"California? How do you manage to afford that?"Steve asks in curiosity, head tilted in that puffy dog type of fashion that Tony has quickly grown to love. It makes the big guy seem to curious and innocent, haven't yet been exposed to all of the ugliness that is Tony Stark.
Steve is hanging up his jacket by the front door, closing the door with the heel of his foot as he does so. It's cold outside and Steve can still feel it's chill even upon entering his apartment, one that has settled deep as he shakes his shoulders and heads to the kitchen to make himself a cup of tea because Bruce has been on a herbal tea kick for the last several months and Steve has unwillingly become a fan.
Or the look of exciting, curiosity and wonder than had flickered in Howard's eyes as he set eyes upon the blowing blue arc reactor for the first time through the slim opening of Tony's bedroom door. The poking, the prodding, the questioning that everyone from S.I did as he was dragged by what felt like the collar around all of Howard's business partners to look at the
"Hey Pep, you didn't happen to bring that Cheeseburger I asked for, did you?"Tony is shouting over the turbines of the air carrier, famous dark shades thrown on to shield him from the glaring New York sun. It's May now. He's been gone for so long.
"Do I? Because I thought I knew you, that I knew you like your coffee black with two sugars or how cheeseburgers are your favourite food or how you listen to Metallica when you're fiddling with your 'bots but only listen to AC/DC when you actually have to do work for your class. You're not who you say you are, you're a liar, a deceiver, selfish, egotistic."
"Steve, your mobile has buzzed about 5 times since we've walked in."Bruce informs, eyes pointing towards the flip phone that lays on the coffee table beside the tray of hot chocolate.
mean that I'm fragile."Tony huffs, stepping back to allow Steve to pull out the suitcase because he hates to admit it but he's lazy and he's rather watch Steve flex those muscles than do it himself. Steve pulls it out and sets it on the bed, stepping out of the way whenever Tony rushes to unzip it.
Tony's home, because for once in his life he can honourably say that he has a home, is one of privacy and solitude to the extent that the number of people who have access to his home is counted on one hand, and those with its known location on his other. It's the remains of what was a warehouse, abandoned when it's company had went bankrupt and one that Tony bought off the bank for little more than his budget. It became his project and a project that he has been immensely proud of ever since being handed the keys.
The hug ends far too soon, with Sarah breaking it and taking a step away with a small smile. Never has a patient made such an impact on her life, it was terrifyingly odd but she doesn't feel regret towards it.
. And by god he wishes he could remember, but instead, he's staring into a half empty, half full cupboard or mismatched plates.
"-of what usually happens when it comes to fitting and placing a prosthetic limb. However, I and a surgeon that I will closely be working with, have noticed certain abnormalities to the remaining tissue of your shoulder that would be a perfect tissue candidate for a new prosthetic spec that we have designed and are wanting to trial. With you."Tony wants to pat himself on the back for keeping his voice so straight, so nullified and still.
It hurts. It hurts a lot more than Steve has ever felt in his life as he lies on his bed, palms of his hand dug into his eyes to take the pressure off from behind his eyes, to stop this pathetic cycle he has caught himself in. Steve would be lying if he told himself that the months have gotten better, that he's forgotten and moved on, but he hasn't, and his solution is a distraction instead.
"The hand hovering over my crotch."Tony points out, his eyes casting down to where one of Obadiah's hands are hovering over Tony's clothed crotch, suddenly feeling very cornered and concealed now that the man has gotten him trapped between the brick wall and himself.

"There are also better ways."Thor says from his place on the ground, trying to connect the PlayStation to Steve's television which always seems like a difficult situation even though it's something that happens at least three times a month.
Tony has that tight, fake smile on his face that Rhodey has came accustomed too, feeling the younger man tense by his side whenever he is now the centre of attention, the chattering dying down to an uncomfortable murmur.
"God help the day he finds out that his son is a slut. Oh what shall I do."Tony dramatically places a hand over his chest, holding back the cringe as his hand brushes the arc reactor before he continues."Maybe he'll cut off my credit card or worse, have to talk to me about it."
"I'm sure they do but right now, I would like to drink."It's like an itch that Tony can't scratch but it can be soothed with alcohol and when that isn't effective, other methods act as Tony's plaster to his hurting heart and aching mind. The bar is right in his reach and if only he could get to it and quench his thirst.
"I get out a lot, actually."Tony dryly chuckles, hands scrunching into fists inside of the pockets of his hoodie. Tony stood like some sort of bandit on the run, dressed in joggers, a hoodie and a pair of Amber tinted sunglasses rested on the bridge of his nose. It was for comfort, and maybe also because he didn't want to deal with people today or have people question why Tony Stark was hanging with Steve Rogers outside of the tower.
"Throw it over a radiator,"Steve tells Tony just as the teen is opening his mouth to ask where he should put the damp towel he used to dry himself off with. He's sitting on the sofa, Bruce is next to him and James on the floor, Clint just away in for his own shower.
"Explain that to my test subjects and their full stomachs!"Tony is snatching the screwdriver out of Dumm-E's claw, shooing the 'bot to his charging station and dumping the screwdriver into a passing tool kit.
There was just something within Steve that made him unable not to get up and approach Tony, making him quiver like a frightened deer in headlights when he was trying to be professional and do his job. It was stupid. Steve was being stupid. What else did he expect? For Tony to be all grins and wide arms, welcoming Steve with the same kiss under the chin as he had all those years ago when they were teenagers and Tony had been seeking affection and Steve was seeking someone to give affection to.
me over!"Steve has gotten defensive, squaring his shoulders, jutting his chin, standing taller than Bucky who is no stranger to Steve's stubbornness nor his short temper.
"Hey Mom,"Tony says with as much enthusiasm as he can muster at the moment, giving his Mother his best smile whenever she takes quick steps towards her son, heels clicking against the marbled flooring of the hallway.
Which, Tony had been fine with because he remains the face of the company, the social butterfly at events and charity galas, the charm at board meetings and presentations while Obadiah is lumbered with the paperwork, the stress, the plans. It works out, in all sorts of way, because Tony remains the brains as well at the beauty and he improves the company from behind the scenes and out on the field in his own types of way, also.
( Which more or less means that he'll give the 'bot a wrench or a screwdriver and make him feel useful for an hour or two around the workshop. )
"Scram, twerp."Bucky beckons with his head, his expression stone cold as he watches his little sister rise to her feet and stick out her tongue at him with sound of 'neh' with the vowel dragged out. Bucky mocks his littler sister all the way until she finally leaves the room with a huff, her head held high and determined to steal a cookie.
It happens too quickly, because before Tony can speak again, demand where he is, who was this person peeling at his eyelids and talking way too sweetly is, Tony is falling into another bout of dreamless slumber almost instantly.
Yesterday had been a great day, for Steve standards anyway. It was different when he was hanging out with Tony, Tony is so easy to talk to despite the fact that he's a riddle wrapped inside a puzzle locked inside a safe. Steve had left nearing 8, the two of them watching some British television show called Downtown Abbey and bantering back and forth. It was enjoyable, sweet and Steve has found himself waiting for Tony's message all damn day.
, he calls himself as Pepper left in the latest memo that he should take into consideration about a gadget he doesn't really care for but makes for on it anyhow.
"Well, so am I."Steve has rolled his shoulders back, squared them up as he sits up straighter, and Bucky
"Believe it or not, I use to bring you here for the tea."Her tone is teasing, just a little as Tony rolls his eyes.
."Bucky glares, icy cold blue eyes narrowed at Steve because for god sake. Sleep is important to Bucky, and if he doesn't get at least 8 hours of sleep he'll snap someone's neck."If you're that fucking worried, go to his house and check on him."
"Rhodey?"Tony calls in search for the man in question. The Second dinner had been called to an end, Tony was up like a flash to get some fresh air, to get away from the thick tension that was slowly starting to stir between himself and Howard with every ticking minute and every slurred word.
Bucky' face lights up in shock as he finds the most recent saved photograph of Tony, sent by Tony himself with a cocky caption. It a photograph still taken in hospital with Tony pulling what Bucky can only describe as a bored face, lips pouted out and glasses balanced on the bridge of his nose. His hair is a messy nest of curls, uncaring of his presentation, soft brown eyes hidden behind the glass of his glasses.
"Yeah, sure. It's perfectly normal to have conflicting thoughts."Tony nods, fixing the glasses on his nose in a sort of nervous habit that he had picked up from an old friend that he hadn't seen in years but has heard much about."I'll be back in a bit while you talk."
Heart thumping, head swimming, chest tightening, limbs frantic, knuckles rapping, the sound echoing into the night of the quiet suburban street as bone knocks against heavy wood. It's a little past midnight, not a sinner to be of sight, and only Tony seems to be awake as he raps against the wood of Steve's front door, a sight to behold with greasy hair and dirty neck and wrinkled clothes and bags under his eyes with a dead phone in his back pocket and hands fitter with nerves, a bleeding bottom lip.
"He didn't lie to me."Steve is stubborn, he's famous for his bullheadedness, headstrong that he's right, that nothing deceives him, naivety strung to the extent that he believes in facades and false first impressions and fake smiles and oblivious to sarcasm.
"No."Jarvis answers and it's hesitant as if unsure if he should be testing the limits of Tony today before he continues unashamed."However, I do urge that you contact Doctor Strange as he is requesting your assistance, quote 'When you are available to chat' unquote, something in which you are."
And it had felt so good to be talking to someone who thought the same way as you did. It had felt even better to be able to talk about inventions, ideas, plans, dreams that you never thought you'd be able to do and for Bruce to tell you how you could do it. He made everything that Tony thought was impossible, possible. Tony could talk for hours to Strange about his ideas, his inventions and dreams and as much as Strange was smart, he didn't understand. But Bruce did.
Tony had been called in as a consult on a peculiar case that an intern had thought would spark his interest. It hadn't. But Tony has already cancelled a meeting and ducked out on a board assemble to make it to the hospital, so he stayed long enough to keep an eye on the patient before lumbering the file on a passing doctor in exchange for the coffee they were carrying. Doctor Strange was just unlucky enough to have been on the floor when Tony was passing, sipping his stolen coffee.
"Now, Ms.Potts, I cannot control where burning trees occur or the kittens that get stuck up them. I simply save them, that's all."The smile that appears on his lips is handsome but condescending, the type of smile that graces Tony's lips only when he's talking to the team that surround Obie like the plague, or that of informers that shake his hand too tightly and smile with too many teeth and try to drug his drink when they think Tony doesn't notice.
Tony would like to say that he has a half decent life, he wouldn't go as far as saying he has the best life ever - because wasn't Naive and could clearly say to anybody freely that some parts of his life was utter shit - but it wasn't as if his life was the worse. Yeah, okay, he had parents that really couldn't give a shit about where he went, who he was with or how much money that spent, but he had people that do care about him, it wasn't as if he was on his own.
"Of course my mom has a fucking problem with it, what sane mother wouldn't?"Mrs.Barnes, despite everything, loves Bucky a whole lot more than people think. She's a hardworking mother of 4, 3 of which who need her care more than Bucky does, and he only understood that that morning he told her he wanted to sign up for the army. Bucky had stood there by the sink and watched every emotion wash over his moms features, watched the fear in her eyes, listened to the lecture of why he shouldn't go, how he couldn't go, why she didn't want him to go."But she knows I'm going, no matter what she says."
"You're 16."Steve deadpans, looking unamused with the fact that Tony has access into clubs at such a young age, younger than him by at least a year."How do you possibly have access into clubs?"
"That's a beautiful name,"Steve admits, blushing whenever he realises what he just let slip. He sees the way that Tony admittedly starts to blush, turning his gaze away from the wonderful blue eyes as he smirks just a little.
And a long time ago, Tony use to laugh at Jarvis' scepticism or his fathers paranoia or how his mom use to always linger in the door frame any time that Obie was caught alone in a room with Tony. Now, Tony wishes that he took all of those hints, the red flags, to heart because he wouldn't have ended up in so many of the situations that he has in the past, and he wouldn't be here right now.
"He usually texts back really quick."Steve frowns, creases in his forehead that Bucky forever teases him about that gives him an older look than he actually is. Steves phone usually lays dormant in his bedside drawer, but since befriending Tony it seems to be attached to him and as much as it's good to see him socialising, it was starting to get increasingly weird to see Steve
"I-"Steve pauses, looking at Tony whose face is scrunched up in some sort of sourness, mixed with an emotion that the teenager is trying his hardest to mask, but damn these fûcking medication, making his moods all loopy."I came to apologise, to introduce myself all over again."
, Tony would comment as he whirled around the workshop, grabbing a 1st place graded sculpture that some kid at a science fair Tony was judging at gave him, placing it on a shelf surrounded by coffee mugs and old Latin books.
Tony's appearance was not one that came from not sleeping until late, it came from not sleeping at all, and really, it wasn't entirely his fault. His phone call with Bruce had went on longer than Tony had intended it to, which was something he didn't resent because he truly does love Bruce's company (and he doesn't think Bruce gets enough company, either), and by the time it had ended, Tony's
"No! Not a date!"Steve laughs it off, something that causes Tony to immediately frown at the reaction. He turns quickly to focus on packing his suitcase before Steve can see the sadness that Tony knows is washed over his face."Just to hang out."
"Okay, Okay, give me a second."Tony laughs, throwing his backpack and coat onto a nearby chair before grabbing the Fuzzy yellow tennis ball out of Dumm-E's claw. The robot spins on the spot in excitement."I swear, though, if you break something-"It's an empty threat and he throws the ball across the workshop and watches in utter amusement as the 'bot chases after it.
"It's like talking to a fucking brick wall."Rhodey whispers to himself, throwing his pencil across the room as he pushes himself out of his chair. It's not as if he doesn't want to see Tony - because by god he does, as much as that boy does his head in sometimes, he brings entertainment to his life and gives him a reason of protectiveness - he doesn't want to deal with brining his news to his mom about getting up and leaving before University even starts back up.
who he is, that he knows of his father, his intelligence, his name, his worth. And Tony isn't sure what to do about it because what is there to do about it? The thing is, Bruce just smiles at him, gives him a wink in a way that almost says
"Jesus Christ, Steve!"Tony flinches, the hand that's not cradling his coffee coming up to his chest and he swears, if it wasn't already for his unsteady rhythm of a heartbeat, he'd think he'd be dying. Tony turns, face meeting chest and he has to take a step back to look Steve in the face, heart racing, eyes wide and lips slack."You scared the crap out of me."
"So are you going to tell me what that was all about or should I just head home?"Bruce had asked when Doctor Strange has left, Tony turning sharply around with a gasp.
But, it's fun, in a sort of way that Tony hasn't felt in a while, and it's harmless. They flirt, and that's
"Yeah,"Steve shrugs with a kind smile."I'll be right back."Steve makes a move to getup, self-consciously fishing into the pocket of his jeans for the spare change he had collected from Burger King and pocket money. Yeah, there should be enough, hopefully.
James eyes the packet up, body stiff as he stares the packet of premium cigarettes with narrowed steel blue eyes as if the offered packet of cigarettes are laced with poison. Tony has to stop himself from rolling his eyes at the suspicious look that's washed over James.
is for long, a phone screen being shoved into his face, eyes blinking to keep up with the flashing lights, the vivid colours, the movement of bodies upon another, lips curling, voice sluring, tongues-
"What does it matter, I'm working on it."Which he is, or will be, it depends on how you look at this progress track record on how long it takes for him to actually get into action. What blueprints that he does have to create his new arc reactor are far from being finished, and until he does finish those blue prints at least, as well as research and scavenging for equipment and material, all projects will be put on hold.
It wasn't a lie, Tony is Intelligent, a Prodigy at that, and there were many people out for his intelligence, to kidnap and use the brains inside of his pretty little head for weapons, for machines and technology ahead of their time. But it wasn't
"It's Steve,"Tony snaps defensively, bottom lip jotted out in concentration as his fingers dance across the screen of the tablet. He has it resting on a cleaner desk, papers piled up high with notes and ideas that Tony hasn't glanced at in years."And anyway, he doesn't know."
"Then don't fix it."Tony is quick because Obie's prices are never cheap, nor do they do good for Tony.
"I'd like for you to come down to Brooklyn, before you leave to go back to MIT, and spend the day with me. And my friends."Steve adds onto the end, something that makes Tony's smile flatter and for the butterflies in his stomach to stop for some odd reason because he shouldn't have been expecting
Which, if you asked Steve was poppycock because Steve didn't see himself as a model citizen, or a superhero. He was just a teenager that seemed to do a lot of good things in his life, like helping out at youth centres for less fortunate kids or doing the weekly shopping for his elderly next door neighbor Reta. He wasn't a damn superhero, there were far more people on earth who deserved that title and he wasn't one of them.
Tony. Sure, he doesn't know all of the big things in his life like his family or his actual home life, other than the fact that he lives in Long Island, but he knows all of the little things about Tony, all of the things that everyone else seems unimportant but is important to Steve.
"Can we hurry up before the ice cream starts melting?"Desperate to steer the conversation away, Tony pipes up and moves a round the Trolley to peer at the ice cream. He still didn't see the point on the food shopping because really all of the stuff that was in the tower was intact imported from different locations across the globe just to fit everyone's likings, paid for by Tony himself,
"Do you want my cheeseburger?"Steve asks once he's seated in the seat beside Tony's bed again, he watches as Tony takes off his glasses and scrubs at his eyes tiredly before putting them back on his nose again.
"Steve."Tony breathes our breathlessly with the smallest of smiles, playing it off as being breathless from the weight of the bags that he's carrying. Even in just jeans and a too tight of a jumper - it's Christmas theme and somebody wearing a Christmas themed jumper shouldn't be
Now, as a teenager and haven enrolled into a prestigious university of his choice at only 15, his sleeping pattern was even more messed up than usual. Tony could go ahead and blame it on his professors, but then again he didn't turn up to half of the lectures that he was signed up for and just turned in a piece of coursework and revived the best grade possible. He could go ahead and blame it on the frat boys that keep inviting him to parties every night of the week, but there again, Tony was never one to back down on an invitation.
"Steve. What are you doing here?"Sarah asks in a rushed tone whenever she spots her son stalking down the hallways, peering into random private rooms as subtle as someone who is over 6 feet tall can. She's rushing to get to the otherside of the hospital, with notes clutched in her hand that are crucially needed.
"Hey, no, it's all good! You can help me set things up, fuck knows that my friends won't."Steve reassures with a laugh."Oh, here, shit let me take the bags. Come in, come in. Make yourself comfortable, god knows everyone else does."
“That doesn’t mean anything, he’s just being friendly.”Steve frowns, looking at Natasha skeptically just in time to see her roll her eyes.
Tony had been elbow deep into a cars engine at the time, engine grease not only staining the material of his jeans or tank top, but smeared into the skin of his cheeks, of his arms, glued into his hair as he tried to reach for a bolt that was smack in the middle of the old cars engine. The car itself, is a mess, unkept and unloved by its owner and they're lucky that Tony is kind enough, and bored enough, to take the old Chevy off of their hands for a couple hundred bucks so he could tamper with it and sell it off for a couple of thousand instead.
"I don't have to be gay to appreciate how attractive another man is."Bucky rolls his shoulders in a stretch.
Bruce, however, took that reservedness to a next level. It had taken Tony 3 minutes to find and hack into the file that Harvard kept of Bruce Banner, it had taken Tony 3 years to hear of that same information from Bruce's mouth. They were alike, whether Bruce and Tony liked that fact or not, there was no changing just how much in common that the two had.
understand. She can only witness, she can only sit and see how her actions cause effects to those she had loved and those she had left too.
"It's fine, it's fine. I, uh, have a part time job on campus."Tony lies whenever Steve continues to give him that 'You shouldn't spend money on wasted food' type of look that makes Tony regret bringing food now."It's at this coffee shop, it's nice, I guess. My co-workers are cute which helps all the same."
, but he doesn't because the thought of stepping into the bathtub and not coming back out is all too tempting, so instead he grabs for a cloth and some soap and makes work with a post-sex wash that is usually followed by dragging soiled jeans up wobbly legs and stumbling to his 8am at 11am instead.
?"Steve wants an answer and it's not exactly like he's mad, or maybe he is a little, because he's barely heard a word from Tony for an entire week since he left his home in Brooklyn, and now all of sudden he calls him up in the middle of the night, looking like - in the words of Tony - shit and wanting
"No we're not."James seems to flare up in offence, his shoulders squared and jaw set at the accusation that Tony has just made.
Tony manages to shower and get changed in a record time for someone in his hungover state, emerging from his bedroom in his workshop gear of battered jeans and a worse for wear tank top. The tank top swoops low on his chest, exposing the top half of the Arc Reactor but Tony doesn't mind, nobody will see him in the confinement of his workshop.
"I am?"Tony questions, rummaging the bags so that he can reach for his phone in the pocket of his favourite MIT hoodie - which doesn't even belong to him and is in fact Rhodeys, evident from the musky cologne smell - and he frowns at the time because he's extremely fucking early."Fuck, I didn't realise. I must've sped here without knowing, I'm a speedy driver-"
"Thanks but no thanks."Tony declines blankly, pushing Ty's wondering hands off of his body as he turns sharply on his heel, heading back in the direction that he came in with his head held high and his legs moving fast.
"Jealous was more the word I was looking for but..."Steve pulls a face, leaning against the fridge and making it shift in its place, something that makes Tony's eyes widen. Standing in the small kitchen makes Steve look even larger than what Tony thought he was and okay, Tony might have a thing for blondes with muscles, sue him.
"Look after yourself."Rhodeys reflection appears in the window, standing behind Tony in a way that the male lead of a romantic comedy would then embrace the female lead during their tragic downfall. Tony scoffs, rolling his eyes and turning away from the rain stained window to look at Rhodey.
"Get in."She says, sunglasses perched on her nose, the dark tint of the shades contrasting against her porcelain skin, smooth as it was back when she was 17 and doing donuts in a parking lot as she waited for Steve or Bucky or Clint to come stumbling out of ER with the latest scar to their growing collection. The anxiety within Steve jolts a little, melting away when he realises who it is, but he's not over all convinced of her reason being here.
And if he's being honest, Steve loves it. He loves how close that their tight-knitted group of rejects are, he loves that everything just seems to natural and normal and unquestionable since the years that they've joined in the group, one by one. Steve is just as bad, he's not so much touch-attention-seeker but when you've grown up surrounded by family and friends that constant have the need to touch, you suddenly get use to it in a way that it's weird when you don't get it.
"This is sounding a lot like a date, Rogers."Tony giggles, waggling his eyebrows at the teenager that stands before him. A date with Steve isn't something that Tony would deny upon, mostly because Steve is a gentleman of a guy, handsome in all his might and willing to go to lengths to make Tony smile-
"Tony..."Bruce had reached out as Tony began to leave, leave to do all of these tasks and more. People to see, things to look at, maybe take a look at that car rusting away in his workshop that he's been avoiding for years, update JARVIS, play with DUMM-E, tinker at You. Spend time with robots and A.Is that can't leave him.
"You're a Doctor now?"Steve's mouth shapes the words for seconds as they stare at one another, Tony with his body half turned to Steve, not fully trusting to allow the full front of his body expose.
"You're not medical staff, shit, and here I am ordering you around."They nibble on their bottom lip, bringing a hand up to rest on the opposing wall for balance and using the other to run over his brow. Steve swallows thickly, taking in the little details of the teenager that is balancing on the chair.
"There's tissue, here,"He points with the tip of his pen at the photograph, suddenly closely behind Tony, using it as a pointer as he speaks to Tony."That you surely can't manage on your own."
"Why do you have to be so nice to them?"The fellow teenager scrunches up his face, flopping down onto the opposite recliner chair, pulling the lever and elevating the leg rest. He has his own class of similar liquid nursed in his hands."You're making me out as a bad influence, punk."
"I didn't ask to be picked up, I could've walked."Steve voices when he turns to see her expression, lips pursed as she drives, eyes shielded behind her expensive sunglasses.
"That's why I left."Steve looks away for a moment, watching as they past cars and street lamps. It's still early in the morning, he has a lot of things to do today."I just hadn't expected him to be there and when I recognised who it was- I don't know, just something within me just switched. He looked so
"Shit."Tony slumps in his chair, hands fiddling with the phone as he keeps peering for a message back from Steve."My mom is blaming me for her psychotic melt down and for the downfall of the company, and Howard is only finding interest in me due to the arc reactor. He'd probably rip it outta my chest if he got close enough."
Taking a glance at the tray, Tony is quick to ignoring what he has to do and gathers his phone back into his hands.
"Yes yes, I know,"Bucky flaps his hands dismissively, pacing the floors."I don't see why you're so angry at me, I'm just the messenger, he's the one that's fucked you over!"
But this is Steve. Wonderful, big hearted and kind Steve. Who goes out of his way to make sure that Tony is comfortable - because he never stares at his arc reactor, or brings it up in conversations whenever he noticed how insecure Tony was about it- and is on a constant text alert for Tony to text him. No matter what time of the day that it is.
Waiting in the underground carpark, Tony fiddles with a cigarette, rolling it between his fingers out of boredom, giving him something to fiddle with since he can do a thing without fiddling with
"Maybe- oh!"Tony exclaims as a coffee is shoved in his direction, nestled in his anxious hands and it feels good to hold something, to have his hands occupied and stop them wondering and touching things he shouldn't. The doctor smiles sheepishly, almost.
"You still winked at her."Tony points out, lifting his fork and taking a corner of the pie that Peggy had originally bought to start off with. Cherry. And Tony gloats for the roaring blush on her cheeks as she remembers the waitress, as she remembers Tony as he was when he was somewhere between 3 and 5, up on on knees on the booths seats with a fork in his hand and eating her pie. Just like he was now. And she'll remember that.
"You should critic less."He rolls his eyes, fingers dancing on the workshop bench before sighing."I forgot to call."
"God, sometimes I wish you just stayed back in New York with Stephen because I barely see you and then when I do see you you give me chronic migraines and constant anxiety."
There's an odd type of feeling in his chest as he watches the pair interact and he isn't sure why. It's not like there's anything to get jealous of, Steve couldn't expect Tony not to get on well with anyone, especially not Bruce since they are born so interested in science. It's just, he hadn't expected Tony to hit off so well with someone and now Steve feels almost jealous at the fact that Tony isn't paying all the attention to
much of a big deal ) but then again, his Father may pay a pretty penny to keep mouths shut but there's always someone fishing for more.
"Oh well, you know me, I can't commit."He shrugs, not exactly looking at Tiberius but over his shoulder, eyes casting the crowd behind him in hopes of catching sight of Pepper or anyone even remarkably interesting to pull him away from the glowering Tiberius Stone.
But she has changed in other ways because the last time Tony had seen her was a decade ago and a decade is a lot of room for changes even if you try and hide them with hats and concealer and a different ring on her ring finger than the one Tony knows that was there before. She's still beautiful, however, because always has been in such a way that reminds Tony of Maria, of how both women were so effortlessly beautiful, so effortlessly pretty in their own ways.
"He can't wait a month, he needs this thing now."And Steve will be dammed if he's waited all this time just for Tony to blow him off to start some other project.
It's where he finds himself now, bundled out on the balcony that leads from his bedroom, overlooking the fields of covered green that now is blanked with a layer of white snow that surrounds Stark Mansion. The concert Balcony is almost colder than the wind that's gushing into the side of Tony's face from where he's sitting down on the concert floor, his duvet draped around him, cocooning him with a warmth.
"Anthony."Howard addresses him, tone dull as he speaks. Tony should count himself lucky that he's being spoken to while he's sober, it's a rare moment.
Sighing, Tony is unbuttoning the buttons of shirt and pulling up the blackout vest that he created below it, exposing the Arc Reactor in all its glory to James who seems to gawk on the seat in front of him, hardened, ugly scars and all. Rolling his eyes, Tony is fixing himself up.
Tony doesn't get out often, and no it's not because he doesn't want to or because he doesn't to deal with the many cameras that follow him around - because honestly they have been following Tony Stark around his entire life, and even before he was even born was Maria Stark being stalked down by a bunch of nobodies with cameras - he just didn't have the time. Tony wasn't someone who had a lot of free time just being handed to him, he was a multi-billionaire and sure, he could jet off to any one of his homes that have been spotted across the globe, but he was still a CEO and not to mention now a Superhero.
Steve would never forget the look on his mother's face the day that he told her that he was joining the army, that her son, her baby, was being jetted off to a war torn third-world country to fight a never ending battle over land, oil, money, power. It had been a look of utter heartbreak, a freeze-frame imagine that would forever be etched into Steve's mind because despite the fact that this was something he had his heart set on doing for years, he was still breaking his mother's heart by going.
Tony has the Stark Tab untucked from under his arm, it's glass screen illuminating the patients information along side doctor notes and Tony's own as he slides the curtain open of the ER cubical. There's so many notes alongside his profile, from way before he had joined the army it seems he has been in and out of hospital as much as Tony has, maybe even more, for stupidity and knucklehead situations nevertheless.
"I brought you because you need out and about just as much as I do."Is what tumbles out of Steves mouth because he couldn't exactly pin point the words that he wanted to say without Tony looking at him as if he had 3 heads. It was just as much the truth as it was a lie because really, Steve didn't have anyone else to bring out 'Shopping' and he didn't exactly trust himself to get himself to the SuperMarket without making a run for any sense of danger.
"Black, two sugars."Tony speaks as he does, pulling the foam cup forward and picking up two sugar sachets. Steve nods, taking the other and adding another pod of milk into it as well as some sugar."If any of the nursing staff ask, you didn't get me any of this, alright? They'll have you head and my ass on a plate."
SuperHero. The word still felt weird rolling off the tip of his tongue and just didn't settle right in Tony's stomach. Tony didn't feel like a hero, he didn't feel like someone who deserved such a title as there were many people across the world who have fought in wars, saved people's lives and didn't even get a damn mention never mind a medal. Tony was just Tony, a man in his late thirties with billions in the bank, a brain in his head and the ability to create machinery and suits that even impressed himself.
One thing that Tony can admit is that his Mom sure knows how to present herself, beautifully made up in sophisticated clothing that costs a pretty dime and a smile that Tony would call fake if it wasn't for the occasion of which it's on her face for.
"Is there any further questions you would like to ask, Mr Stark?"Yinsen had perched himself on the edge of Tony's Hospital bed, in a way that respected Tony's personal space and that he was no longer talking down to Tony in anyway.
"I've missed you too, Tones."He lets out a relaxed sigh, the tension he didn't know was heavy on his shoulders melting away whenever he has Tony in his arms. His head had been swimming in worry over the holidays whenever Tony had failed to ring and message him constantly like he usually does, and even more so after he had woken up and told him of the situation.
"Stephen?"Bruce queried quietly, dipping his head as he approaches Tony, piles of pages tucked in an arm pressed to his chest. He had looked frantic and maybe that's because Tony had called for him urgently or maybe more for the fact that he's taking on a workload that he can't manage on his own. And there was still so much more to do, work to edit, others to publish, paperwork to sign, moving vans to hire...
Like the way that Tony has an undying love for coffee, black with two sugars, or how he constantly has the need to fix up things that are either broken or not up to his standards ( Steve learned that not only from Tony giving maintenance to the heart monitor but also because Steve had woke up from his nap that afternoon to find an old portable radio not only working but also picking up stations from different states, the hands of Tony Stark of course ).
"Enough about Rhodey! Your friends! What do I need to know about your friends?"Tony is changing the subject swiftly as he looks over at Steve, leaning further back into the counter as if it will make the moment any less awkward, instead it just makes his chest seem to stick out further and show off the arc factor under his hoodie more prominently in the kitchen lighting.
"Is he okay? Buck, is he okay? Nothing is wrong with him, right? The experiment can continue?"A sudden voice is asking frantically and Tony doesn't need to turn his head to know who that voice belongs to, but he does anyway. Steve stands in all his glory beside him at the station, 6 feet plus in height and weighted shoulders that could surely lift and carry Tony off somewhere far far away.
"Tony,"Tony smiles just a little, not looking bothered or alerted about the blue light in his chest. If he is being honest, Tony sometimes forgets about his new addition and carries on as if it wasn't there to start off with. It wasn't as if Tony was on bed rest, he was actually encouraged to get out of bed and take walks down the corridor and back, but of course, standing on a chair to fix a television was a little too extreme for his condition.
The weather outside this morning, and the weather that has continued to drip down throughout the last week, is wet, dreary, dull. It's autumn weather in the middle of spring, with gusty forces of wind that knocks loose pages out from between heavy pages of books and pellets of raindrops that leave you soaked to the bone in a matter if seconds that one time that you forget your umbrella. It's terrible, dreary, sorrowful weather that, without a doubt, matches the state of mind that Tony happens to be stuck in.
"That's, you can't be serious, Tony. He needs me in there."Steve looks eccentric and maybe that's because he's been running about like a headless chicken all morning for his bullheaded best friend and now he's being told that he's not allowed to be with him. Steve didn't see any signs that informed him on hospital policies, nor was any passing nurse quick to telling him of them either.
"O' course I can 'ear you,"Tony's words come out muttered, slurred and almost sounding as if he as confused because he is, in some sort of way because he has no idea what has happened or where he is or why his mouth feels like a bunch of cotton balls have been stuffed in his mouth, making him seem unable to speak correctly without him sounding like he has just had a stroke."You won' shut up."
It's silent for a while and remains so until Natasha is pulling up to Steve's apartment complex, stories tall and red bricked. She doesn't shut off the engine but she does turn in her seat, red hair whipped over a shoulder as she does so and face set with an unidentifiable emotion that does nothing but make Steve more nervous and embarrassed than he already was. She's beautifully terrifying and Steve has faced many a thing in Afghanistan but nothing will ever come close to the fear that Natasha holds.
"I didn't, but I'm working on improving the element. Research shows that paladium in the long run give off more bad news than good news which isn't helpful in my age."
Most of the time, Tony would have the Mansion to himself. Howard and Maria would be off to another home, another island that the Starks owned and called their own. Okay, and sometimes Tony would take advantage of being home alone and have a party packed to the roof with young adults doing all sorts of drugs - and it was safe to say, that Jarvis wouldn't tell a soul because he was more loyal to Tony than to any other Stark - but then, There were times that Tony just locked himself in his fathers workshop and fiddled with tools.
"That my sperm donor is Howard Stark, that I'm the next heir to Stark Industries, that I'm a genius all that type of stuff. And I don't want him to know either. He treats me like a human, that I'm the same, well not the same because of this arc reactor but y'know, as a teenager."
"I'm not doing this to be difficult, Steve, it's part of this wings privacy policy. A lot of our patients are very body conscious and we feel that having a family member in the room while we inspect their insecurities make our patients unwilling to correspond and answer our questions accordingly. I'm sorry."Tony explains gently, tapping on his screen and bringing up the policy for Steve to read.
"Save it, Cap. I'm only messing."Tony's smile is enough to reassure Steve that he's only teasing."Yinsen says if I can manage not to have a heart attack or die within the next 48 hours then I'm free to- oh! You bought me coffee!"Tony is snatching the coffee cup from Steves hands, letting out a blissful sigh as he takes a whiff of the coffee with a smile on his face.
"I don't know yet."Tony mumbles, scrunching up his eyebrows as he focuses on all of the bits and bobs in front of him. Sarah will have a heart attack if she sees that Tony has dismantled the one thing that is telling them Tony's heart beat is regular and not missing any beats, but Tony is making sure that he does this as quick as possible so that Sarah doesn't find out, well she will eventually but not right now.
"Jarvis will know of you, I'll introduce you to him. I've told him all about you."Tony smiles to himself in a fond way, remembering the way he had excitedly rang Jarvis and his Aunt Peggy about the news or actually gaining is first friend. He has sounded so much like a child, and to think, he was only 15 so that was being a child.
"Oh don't bore me with your attempts of acting like your group is so angelic. You're not as subtle as you think you are. The entire bathroom stinks of stale cigarettes, it's a miracle Steve hasn't figured out the fact that you're all smoking in his bathroom because you're all too chickenshit to tell him."
And they knew him too, obviously, as they shift in a sort of surprise that has their steel blue eyes widening in shock but it seems to be the only recognisable expression that graces his stoney features.
look. The type of look that can make even the biggest of men crumble under such an intense stare - and as much as Natasha is his best friend, Clint is fucking frightened of her.
in massive red block letters, his body bent over the workshop bench, a dirty blanket from his dirty couch in front of his make shift coffee table of bricks and wooden crates, draped over his shoulders by DUMM-E before making his way to his charger deck. He'd wake up with a crooked neck, dead arms and a dented line across his midsection, just under the rim of the Arc Reactor, JARVIS alerting him that he needs to get up and DUMM-E eagerly trying to shove foul tasting coffee at him.
the last person that I want to think differently of me."He keeps his voice low and quiet, as if he's afraid that anyone else that's in this coffee hut will over hear, as if they care of what Tony says.
but for not himself. He was a proud peacock who had just been turned down, shunned, made of a full on as he motioned out to the emptiness of the workshop, with no other soul but Tony and Pepper, of DUM-E who remained charged in his station, of a half built Butterfingers."To JARVIS, of course."
"Ms.Potts, it's fantastic that you've made it. You look divine!"Tony throws his arms open in a gesture for Pepper to come forward, welcoming and charming as Pepper steps into the open space of his arms so that Tony can place a hand on her waist and another on her arm, leaning forward to press a kiss to her cheek for show. He can feel the eyes on the back of his head. He's late. He's drunk. Everybody knows it.
Sarah reaches for the backpack, coming back over to sit in the vacant seat next to Tony's bed, setting the backpack on Tony's lap as the teenager munches on a piece of celery. As much as he hates vegetables, Tony knows that Sarah won't leave until he's ate food. Unzipping the bag, Tony pulls out a couple of photo frames.
Money was able to buy Tony out of a lot of speeding tickets and it kept the media quiet on numerous occasions when the young Stark was caught up in bed with A man twice his age, or caught in a college bar bathroom with some senior doing cocaine off of his ass. People wanted him for his brains, his body and the money and for once - second actually because Rhodey just wanted Tony
Some part of Tony wants to remain bitter for all of those times where he hadn't been hugged, or talked to, or looked at for days and weeks and months, for all those birthdays and Christmas's Tony spent in school, in collage, on his own. But he's not petty, and he's not exactly raining down with members left of his once family unit which has now been fractured by deaths grip.
"What the fuck, that was sore."James winces, going to rub at the assaulted area, almost pouting of it wasn't for the fact that James Barnes doesn't pout. Tony smirks, noting his comment onto the file as he speaks up.
The wind blows her red hair back onto the seats head rest as they drive down the streets, dressed in a pair of yoga pants and a jacket that she borrowed off of Bucky not that long ago and then never returned. Without any effort, and Steve has to admit that she is beautiful and can see why people say she's the most beautiful in all of their school.
Tony can feel a feeling of unsettle in the pit of his stomach as he comes to the realisation that he's technically 'gate crashing' a friend get together night. He knows that Steve invited him, but he wonders if his friends were comfortable with the idea, and if they weren't, how would they react with having Tony hanging around on a night that's only for best friends, not no good strangers from Long Island.
And then he was stranded in the desert. Until of course, by some miracle or because maybe someone up there thought Tony deserved a sliver of luck, he was found.
"Pepper."Tony muffles his grumble by taking a gulp of his favourite black liquid, the bitter taste of coffee seeming to give him a little boost. Tony isn't overly surprised that Pepper had given Stephen a heads up because Tony can be pretty unbearable without sleep or caffeine. When Tony looks back to Stephen, he smiles, and it's not as tight as it was before. "Thank you. Now, the agenda for today?"
"I got a heads up."He admits, thanking a nurse as he's handed back his StarkTab that Tony had gratefully gifted to him when they entered into their little work dynamic. As much as Tony and Stephen both like to tell people they don't work well with other people, the two work very well with one another.
"Take it for a spin around the block if you want."Tony offers because if this guy is more interested in the car than Tony is, somebody might as well enjoy it. The look of happiness that beams over Clints face is almost manic before he turns and runs out the open door without a second thought to anyone else in the room or a thank you.
?"Steve is asking, still sweeping dirty clothes into the washing basket. Now that he looks, Steve is pretty sure that not all of the clothes in the washing basket is his because last time Steve checked, he didn't own black leggings or red cycling shorts.
"Tony,"Steve approaches the table with care, face tinted pink from the run and nose numb from the sharp, icy wind. His hair and swept in all sorts of directions, blue eyes open and caring and
"Dork,"Tony rolls his eyes, unable to help the feeling of fondness that suddenly rushes through his chest or the odd blush that he can feel heating his cheeks. Tony bites his bottom lip, shaking his head to rid himself of the unfamiliar feeling that has seemed to take over his mind and chest, moving to focus his attention on throwing his wallet back into the drawer and closing it.
"You don't like anyone."The blond deadpans, looking over his shoulder at his best friend who seems to carry a constant air of hatred and disgust when surrounding the topic of Tony.
Steve loved his odd group of friends because they might've been through a lot, and the fight an awful lot, but they always came back together at the end of the day.
There's a silence that passes between the two friends, one that Steve knows is due to Bucky falling asleep beside him, evident from the soft snores that leaves his friend and the way the teen as shuffled closer so they can share body heat. It gives Steve to think, mostly about Christmas which is normally a big affair between the group of friends and one that Steve normally finds himself spending with the Barnes due to his mum taking the Christmas shift.
"What? Chill, Capsicle, I'm not going to die from a little grease and caffeine."Tony smirks, taking a sip from the dark coffee before Steve can protest anymore. He's melting into the pillows in relief, a blissful smile taking over the smirk as he feels the warmth slide down his throat and settle into his system. He's missed coffee so
"You just get busy swimming in all those circles."To Tony's surprise, Barnes let's out a surprised chortle and it seems to surprise Barnes too by the look on his face, eyes wide in shock and seeming to jerk to one side to cover his laugh, almost forgetting about the missing limb that stops him from doing so.
"Well, I pay for the water so you don't have to deal or fuss about that."Tony tries his hardest to bite back his laugh, the look on Steves face priceless and just damn right amazingly funny.
