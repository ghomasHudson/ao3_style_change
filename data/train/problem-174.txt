He had forgotten that about her. Always striving for personal perfection, at least on the outside. No better way to cover up your struggles and flaws than by offering to the world a seemingly immaculate version of yourself, and Sharon was still attempting to cover up not only her own flaws but the flaws of her family in tow. Alcoholic husband? Make sure your hair is perfectly clipped back, not a hair astray. Lesbian daughter? Iron that blouse until it looks as if it never had a crease upon it in its life. Son studying away from home with barely any contact in recent months? Smile until you forget how to frown.
He sent it with a hard tap to the screen, his leg starting to bounce beneath the table as he stared intently at his screen without a single thought to the students around him or the lecturer who was still going on about something that he no doubt already knew. Two minutes. Three. Four and a half.
"Sherlock -" John dragged his stare up to meet his taller friend's own blazing look – another erratic hammering of a heartbeat, a flash of confusion and, ah, yes, a definite dilation of pupils. Evidence. More evidence to collate. "I am asking you... nicely... to let go of my wrist and step back. I am tired and this is all just too much of a twisted power-play and I
"Ohhh, one or two," she giggled, bringing the plastic cup to her lips and taking a swig of whatever the red liquid inside was. "Greg made punch and it tastes like pick and mix, seriously -"
“Do you want to rescind your friendship? Take it all back? Go back to your accommodation and pretend we never even met?”
"Yes. Places like that, they're teeming with families and belligerent children. I can't say I was thrilled by the suggestion in the first place but, seeing as Mother seemed to have her heart set on it, I wasn't going to argue."
“Because he got hurt!” It exploded from him like a firework, his entire body vibrating from it as he whirled to properly face his brother, eyes wide and full of undisclosed emotion, “he got hurt and it was my fault for not thinking of him! He got hurt on my watch, Mycroft, and I don’t understand why it makes me feel the way that I do!”
rather drunk, I suppose... you could've been anyone, it would have had the same effect." He forced a grin, more for himself than for Sherlock who wouldn't be able to see it in the darkness. "Haven't had sex for months..."
in order to convince you of my... dedication..." there was a small, audible intake of breath, "is that I believe we may be able to come to understand one another on some small level. Depending on the longevity of our arrangement, it could even be on a somewhat... bigger... level. Evidently I am weak in regards to social interaction and I oftentimes say the wrong thing completely, I am not totally ignorant to that and I'll confess to you now that when I often cannot find the right words to say I'll simply say nothing at all – this is a point well made by my earlier comment of 'I don't know what to say to you now', if you wish to refer back to our instant messages."
"I was..." He sighed, rubbing his hand over his face. "I assumed you would rather it was less... emotional."
John fell naturally into step beside him, legs still slightly weak from the insane run he'd done just minutes earlier. "What does?"
Throwing the covers from his legs, Greg groaned loudly as he forced himself to sit up. His mouth felt as it were full of sand. Tasted a bit rank too. Whatever had been in that curry had not sat well with him, that much was obvious – his stomach had been churning since he'd left Lauren's flat, the burning acidity that came with heartburn tingling in the back of his throat and keeping him awake. He'd ignored it as best as he could but it was getting ridiculous now. He had to have a drink of water, or anything cold – maybe milk. Just something to soothe it a little.
"Yeah right," Greg snorted, pulling out his phone. "Sent him a text but no answer. D'you think he went to his dealer?"
His twin grinned, crossing her ankles and settling back against the wall as she had been before their conversation had taken a rather deeper turn. “Sure you weren't. You two been keeping in touch since you came home?”
"Please, John." Sherlock's tone was no longer soft; it suddenly had an edge, an irritability that somehow stretched beyond what it should have been. "I appreciate that you are just... being... a
It was a lovely room. On the left wall as he walked in there was a dark oak double bed furnished with throws, cushions and bedding in varying shades of deep green and brown, pillows plumped and ready for his head to sink into later that evening; on the wall directly opposite him there was a cottage-style window that somehow managed to let in a lot of light considering its size, edged either side with curtains that seemed to match the bedding perfectly. At the end of the bed was a huge wooden chest – he would fight his curiosity, it wasn't his house to snoop around! - and on the wall opposite the bed there was a door which no doubt led to the en-suite bathroom. Behind the door there was a large set of wooden drawers the exact shade of oak as the bed, on top of which lay a pile of fresh cream towels and decorated with a few candles that looked as if they'd never been touched, let alone lit.
“Because you're the one who's moving in, the one she wants to meet. I would think that was fairly obvious.”
Light off, curtains drawn and laptop sat in its usual place on the chair opposite him, John stared down at his phone screen with barely a flicker of emotion on his taut face. So, Mycroft had taken Sherlock home. He hadn't got to say goodbye, or any of the other thousands of things he probably needed to say, and now he was expected to simply crawl back into his hole and stay there until Mycroft decided that there was something more for him to do.
"So, what is Sherlock playing tonight?" Mycroft asked, sounding very much as if he did not care at all. "A song of his own composing?"
Basically, the man was a sociopath. Sherlock had even said it himself after his fifth scathing comment about a passer-by, almost a tinge of pride in his low tones as he had explained.
Neil put out a hand – so obscene, so farcical that he should think a single hand could stop Sherlock at this precise moment – and shook his head, dazed,
"Like I said before," Greg said, shrugging, looking vaguely helpless. "He's... falling for you. In a big way."
His eyes widened. "Oh, Jesus... fuck, yeah, all right. You... you take care of him then, Sherlock. John, mate..." He shrugged, hands raising to the night sky. "Thanks for coming, yeah? I'll tell John – I mean, Mike -"
A shuffling of paper, a shifting of posture. John was staring at the table beside him like his life depended on it, unable to face that look again for the foreseeable future. "I'm not looking at you like
John took a sip of his own tea; it was perfect. She really did make a damned good cuppa. "Yeah. Found a little Italian place near campus, really nice spot. Never busy, we never have to make a reservation."
“I'm concerned about you, John,” the red-headed woman on the opposing side of the desk to him sighed, ruffling through the papers she held in her stubby, ringed fingers, “and I'm not the only one. All of your class tutors -”
Exasperated, John watched his friend walk purposefully away before giving in and following him, wondering if this would be the way it would always be – Sherlock would always be right, and John would always follow.
John stared openly at Sherlock, partly aghast and partly confused. "I don't understand. You never said anything…"
John’s body audibly shifted on the bed. “You’d never make me believe it, Sherlock. You’ve never shown any hint of a romantic bone in your body.”
The lecture theatre was completely packed out. John was alternating between casually leaning on the wall outside of the room and subtly trying to see through the sliver of glass but, as of yet, he hadn’t managed to catch a glimpse of Sherlock in the mass of students taking notes. He vaguely remembered short, dark, messy curls from the night before – nothing
of different expressions over their time together, but never quite like this. "Tell me to be quiet if I'm being too pushy -"
"I told him, very reasonably, that I had no idea what I was going to do and that I would rather not make any rash decisions and end up screwing up a friendship that actually means quite a lot to me – quite a lot, Sherlock – at which point he let it go and, realising it was nearly time for your performance, we walked back inside."
"Why is it that you always get bored whilst I'm trying to enjoy a nice meal? You were the one who wanted to eat out tonight, Sherlock. Why do you bother to ask me out if you don't plan on actually
Ah, Mary. His crush, at least before the depression took away any form of interest in another living being. He rolled his eyes at himself, realising too late that Mike could see it - he leapt into the fray of conversation as enthusiastically as he could, nodding hard. "Oh, yeah, right, Mary! I do... I do like Mary. Mm. Sounds like a really good idea."
. Almost as if on cue, a pool of heat filled his stomach, coming out of nowhere and making him feel vaguely awkward at its presence.
This kicked John's emotions to new heights. Anger came to play. "After last time? Let's talk about that, shall we? What the hell happened to trying to stop? Trying to deal with the problem rather than avoiding it and just ending up back here again? Wasn't that what counselling was all about, Sherlock, wasn't that the whole bloody point? What did you even
"Too fucking right," Greg crowed, quickly (and with no precision whatsoever) pouring out a shot each of Tequila and Sambuca for the three of them, taking the shot of Jager from Mike with the tip of his fingers and looking at both of them in turn. "Ready for this, fella's?"
Shrugging again and plucking a lighter from his pocket, Sherlock began to click the flame to life in full view of the whole restaurant. John leaned over quickly and grabbed it from his fingers, slipping it in the top of his shirt pocket and narrowing his eyes; Sherlock reacted as expected, throwing himself back onto his chair and folding his arms tightly over his chest.
He pushed open the door and stepped out onto the cold street, glancing both ways up the high street. He slipped his jacket on but left the buttons undone, slipping his hands into his pockets as he waited for Sherlock to follow him out into the darkness.
"Pointless? But you're here, after all." Her head tilted to the side again, questioning. He decided to allow her this.
"Skipping the pleasantries again. Hm. No matter," Mycroft said with another small, unreadable smile, settling himself back and crossing his legs gracefully, "I merely wanted to see how you were doing after our little situation this evening."
A grin flitted across John’s face, turning for a moment to look down at his half-unconscious friend. “No change there, then.”
"YOU JUST SAID YOU LOVED HIM!" The screech was so painful John had to temporarily remove the phone from his ear. "YOOOOOU FUCKING SAID IT, JOHN HAMISH WATSON -"
"Mm," Sherlock hummed from behind him, the tiniest hint of amusement seeping through, "I'll have to take your word for it."
"Oh," John said loudly, rolling his eyes and flailing his hands up into the air, "OH, well, you and Mycroft figured something out, that must mean it
The lecture hall hazed out as his slender thumbs started to type out a message from underneath the desk, his head trying to get past the ridiculous shock so that he could reply with something that at least appeared to make sense:
Eyes that had been focused on the blood seeping into the drain snapped up and locked onto John's face. "I was."
Taking in an unsteady breath, John shook his head gently and closed his eyes again. His voice cracked as he spoke. "Sorry."
The look that Mycroft shot Greg was a hilarious mixture of horror and disgust. “Oh, really, I don’t think we needed to know that!”
The warmth in John's cheeks was suddenly no longer pleasant; a mixture of shame and irritation flooded through him. "Someone's in a bad mood. What, everyone too happy for you?"
"Good. Well. I'll speak to you later." Sherlock gave him one last nod before turning, out of the building and out of sight so quickly and smoothly that John found his stomach twisting with the ardent want to just follow him wherever he was headed – the truth was that at that moment he'd go anywhere at all if he could just get away from this building and avoid the inevitable.
"I reckon you're already halfway there. I mean, if someone as emotionally redundant as him can do it, then you can too. You remember Sarah, you were totally into her."
Also, my beloved Marcy (because anyone who reviews as often as she does is beloved to me: there are a few of you =3) mentioned her interest in having this printed as a book once it's finished... personally my mind is blown by this, but would it interest anyone else? If I did do it as a one-off sort of thing?
"Well." Neil Watson cleared his throat, slipping his hands into the pockets of his jeans and rocking back on his heels. "Your mother wasn't lying when she said you'd lost weight."
John did not move, but he no longer advanced either. "Right. So… maybe I should go then?" Sherlock watched as John's arm moved, pointing towards the door. "I mean, you didn't want me here in the first place, I kind of barged my way in here -"
Mycroft pushed himself out of the chair, voice almost dangerously quiet. “No, brother mine, I don’t think that you will. You will tell me what you came here to say and then you will return back to Well Place to look after John, as you promised to do.”
"That was my initial intention, yes. But intentions aren't always... simple to follow through." William suddenly sounded exhausted, slightly confused. "I don't know, these sorts of things are usually beyond me. I understand the science behind them of course, that much is very easy to understand -"
Lauren leaned across to Greg, eyes sparkling as she whispered something into his ear with blatant glee; Sherlock's housemate leaned away from her slowly afterwards, a grin spreading over his lips as he nodded, looking as if Christmas had come early.
He was just drifting into a delightfully heavy sleep when a half-conscious murmur came from the armchair:
"You're not looking at me," Sherlock observed wryly, the heat of his gaze hot against John's discomfort, "so I assume that I
"Barely." Sherlock turned away from him, striding towards the other side of the room. "Come on, we've got more rooms to break into."
"Fine. I saw you. I saw you two, standing in the dark with Sherlock up in your face, his hand holding your wrist and you two pretty much pressed up against one another. I saw it." Greg's tone was disturbingly matter-of-fact. "It was a... damned compromising position to be found in."
He found himself choking again, this time on a pea. "Oh – oh, christ, no. No. I really can't sing, Mrs. Holm- Wanda, I couldn't sing a straight tune to save my life."
Greg took a hesitant step forward, his hands out defensively. "Look, mate, there was nothing malicious about it, all right? I didn't plan on telling him but he kind of forced it out of me."
The look almost killed him. "If you want me to answer that in some form of comprehensible English you probably shouldn't look at me like that, for starters."
John reached out with his own hand, taking the man's and shaking it firmly, briefly. "And you... er... I'm sorry, she didn't tell me your name – your receptionist, I mean."
"I don't understand," John stressed, putting his hands out in front of him as if to physically stop Sherlock's advance – then again, that might be his last hope of righting the situation, if it came to it. "I didn't say that. Are you drunk? Did you have brandy with Mycroft?"
"Mm?" Sherlock's eyes swept back to the direction of John's own waiting stare, still distracted. "What?"
John stared blankly at the screen, gripping his hands tighter against his stomach. Wasn't he going to respond to what he had just said? At all?
John needn't have worried so much. Sherlock's tongue found its way back to John's lip, John meeting it instantly with a gliding sweep of his own; Sherlock seemed to jerk slightly, startled at the contact, but it was with a hesitant persistence that Sherlock flicked the curled warmth once more against the ridge of their kiss and John again moved to meet the moist heat and brushed it against the centre of a tongue that tasted of something deeper than spearmint toothpaste and was altogether more satisfying to him. He was unable to stop himself from shifting closer, his hands moving from Sherlock's shoulders to instead press their palms over the elegant collarbone taunting him and his thumbs skating intently over the skin beneath Sherlock's pyjama top. A jolt of raw want burned all the way from his chest to his lower abdomen as Sherlock's slender hands moved from where they had been supporting himself and instead came to rest, solid and unequivocally real, on John's mid-thigh; the fingers spread themselves out almost as if to hold on, the knowledge that Sherlock was so intent on increasing the heat of the kiss – his tongue slipping and sliding against John's with growing certainty – that he would strain his stomach muscles in order to do so making the low rumble in the back of John's throat grow a little more in volume and the very epitome of
"Why do you think it is?" Sherlock seemed to be genuinely bewildered, brow creased in confusion. "Why do you think we always seem to have to have some sort of... emotional...
John attempted to think this through and came up with nothing. "So... what are you trying to say to me?"
Wanda, however, looked delighted. "Oh, goodness, of course! Sherlock, you would have let me forget, wouldn't you? You
"The truth is that I was deeply concerned for you, John." The words were stiff, stilted, yet they came out in a rush as if he had been trying to withhold them and could do so no longer. "You are right in saying that it was a difficult situation and that I am not well-versed in taking care of people, yet it was a necessary task and one I had accepted… and I accepted because it was imperative to me that I deal with the problem that I had created."
Soooo sleepy... hope you enjoy! ^_^ Thank you endlessly for you comments, can't even put into words how much they mean to me!
John glanced around him warily, all too conscious of the people walking by, all of whom could very easily figure out what was going on behind him. "Sherlock, if I haven't said this already I think this is a
As if stripping down to his underwear in the middle of the shop wasn't uncomfortable enough – because a shop that small couldn't even fit a
Sherlock glanced at John again; he showed no signs of being involved in their conversation. Sherlock's brow wrinkled slightly, wanting to broach the subject of what was on his mind yet not knowing how to without either sounding like an arsehole or raising Greg's suspicions. “Am I to assume that she asked questions?”
“Well, whatever the reason, I'm offering you the chance to attempt to explain and – as we both know – oftentimes it makes it markedly easier to analyse and deconstruct ones difficulties in understanding something by voicing the matter at hand
Nina Reece cleared her throat, taking off her glasses and leaning forward on her chair to rest her elbows on the table. "William, we've been here for ten minutes and you have yet to answer any of my questions.
John was paler than ever, could feel that the blood had drained completely from his face, but at least he was regaining some of his natural calm. "Sherlock went to see Mycroft specifically to tell him that he... that he feels..."
"An hour and fifteen minutes ago you challenged me to get drunk and enjoy myself; naturally I was sceptical and unwilling yet I had made a deal with you to spend an hour at the party and therefore my only choices were to either detach myself from you and spend my time being rubbed against by strangers or to join you and Greg in a game so utterly ridiculous that I'm still somewhat amazed that I didn't leave fifteen minutes ago. Seeing as how you were so certain that enjoyment would come alongside inebriation I chose to go along with the rules of the game regardless of how idiotic they were, not to mention that this is most certainly the lesser of two evils and at least in this instance I can exact my revenge on the two of you for insisting I come downstairs and join this cesspit of a party when I would have been quite happy staying in my room for the entire evening."
? Was that the right word? Fled would infer that there had been something to run from, but there hadn't been. Not really. The images flooded back to John as he recalled the brushing of Sherlock's thumb on his wrist, the sensation of the warm cloth in its firm strokes over his chest and finally the feel of fingertips pressing briefly, unintentionally against his bare skin -
"But whether I'm gay or not, the fact that we're talking about the possibility of being something other than friends -"
- waiting to take their car and park it for them, "Lady Brooke Londonderry, who owns this house, she once lived in the village before she married up and above her station -"
The fact that John could not see Sherlock clearly and therefore leaving one of his senses limited seemed to simply work to heighten the others; as he crushed his lips to Sherlock's perfect cupids bow he became blisteringly aware of the rush of breath from Sherlock's lips as John allowed his chest to press against his, capturing the slightly minty heat against his demanding kiss and pushing away the space it created with fierce determination. He could feel the hesitation in Sherlock's response, the few seconds where doubt flooded his mind and fought against the desire to feel Sherlock's body properly beneath his own but, blissfully, those seconds were sparse – to his complete and utter surprise he felt long arms moving from beneath the duvet and sliding up to wrap around his torso, pulling John closer as Sherlock seemed to awaken to the emotions behind the kiss and met them with a blind fearlessness; John was not being gentle, he was not trying to coax Sherlock into intimacy... the situation had done that for him. In the dark of the room and with nothing but thin layers of material separating them from the burgeoning mess of body heat and limbs, intimacy was something that needed no encouragement.
None of the other stuff mattered. His father could do what he wanted, his mother could cope without him; this house was not his home and he did not belong here. All that mattered was this, this moment, this feeling, this infinite knowing of what was huffing and sighing and waiting for him back in Goring. All that mattered was getting through these damned few days and getting back to where he should have stayed.
has changed. I want you, as you are, not some clingy idiot who thinks I want to be in his company every minute of every day.”
icon flashing, rocking from side to side slightly in his determination to stay awake. After about a minute of watching the icon, it finally stopped, before:
"Be careful, all right?" John admonished, nudging the mascarpone over to him. "Now. Just get a little bowl and mix them together until it's a nice murky mess of greeny-white and then – are you watching? Right, once you've slit the chicken you just stuff the inside of the hole you made with the pesto and mascarpone mix. When you've done that, put them on the baking tray that Greg – Greg!" John raised his eyebrow at the man who was chowing down on an apple, watching as if it were a show rather than an activity he was supposed to be a part of. "Where's the greased baking tray?"
came in here because you didn't want to let me sleep. You said, and I believe this is accurate, 'if I can't sleep, you can't sleep either', and now… what, now you've changed your mind?"
“No,” John said, shaking his head. “They really aren’t important, they – WAIT.” One particular question began screaming itself hoarse in the back of his mind, probably the
Mike grabbed his arm as he sent the text, pointing eagerly at someone over by the doorway. John followed his finger and saw a girl standing there clutching a plastic cup and looking nervous; she had mousey-blonde hair and was rather thin, carrying a subtle sort of prettiness that John could appreciate. She actually looked a little like Sarah. He nodded his appreciation to Mike.
A male voice, one he didn't recognise. He brought his phone away from his face, staring at it in confusion.
He gave her one last squeeze and separated himself from her, taking a step back and feeling only mildly embarrassed as he offered her a small smile. "I hope so. I seem to have a considerably lax grasp of the English language recently."
“I’ll wake you up when he gets here,” John reassured him, gesturing towards his pillow. “Go on and lie down, you look about ready to pass out. Get some rest.”
"Tough," she said shortly, turning away and reaching for the cup of tea she had just made for her husband, "you're just going to have to stop acting like a seven year old and get on with it like the adult you are." She bustled past them, giving John a rapid knowing look which disappeared as quickly as it had come. "I'm sure you can find a way to make him behave, John."
"Oh, please," Sherlock snorted, tearing his eyes away from John's hand to look up at his friend's face in utter exasperation, "are you still under the misapprehension that I would take you along on a drugs collection? I already told you, I wouldn't take you with me for that." His voice lowered to a mutter. "You'd probably fall on a used needle and bleed to death..."
He gave up, giving a half-hearted shrug and coming up beside his wife to slide a light arm around her waist. "Eleven, I think."
John did not like the delicate threads of mockery lingering beneath Mycroft's seemingly innocuous words. "She was nice, Mycroft. I'm not saying I'm going to marry her."
Another chapter written whilst practically falling asleep - hope it's not too crappy! xD Still, I genuinely enjoy every darned second of writing this fic, so either way I'm happy! Love and hugs, thanks so much for the continuing support!
If he somehow had the strength to close his eyes against the silver fire burning into them he could not find it within himself. He could barely force words from his lips, surprising as there were so many he could offer. "It doesn't matter, I understand -"
you, Sherlock, there was absolutely no need for you to do that – you can take that look off of your face for..." His voice trailed off as Sherlock too forced himself into a standing position, taller, far more threatening simply in height than John could ever be. "All right, calm down - sit back down -"
“Yeah, you have. Come on, Sherlock, your observational ‘glances’ aren’t so much ‘glances’ as they are incredibly intense, invasive stares.” A grin twitched upon John’s face, seemingly genuine. “It’s hard not to notice your desperation when you’ve spent most of your time today watching me.”
"Oh, well," she said, turning away and gathering her little clutch purse to her chest and waiting for her husband to pull up beside one of the many valets –
Sherlock watched as Mycroft sparked a match and lifted it to light the end of the cigarette, embers glowing to life. “Certainly not. It is, after all, my decision to label it as I have. The ball is very much in his court.”
"Everything you described earlier – he makes your palms sweat, makes your heart go all fluttery, gives you butterflies, all that bollocks... John, love, dear brother o' mine, you are halfway there and you don't even
"Why are you being so difficult about this?" Sherlock's arms went akimbo into the air, looking every inch the impatient and disgruntled child. "They're very simple questions, John, I'm not asking you to explain the meaning of life!"
blur my vision enough that I could not see past it quickly enough to realise my mistake in time to rectify it."
"Yes you do – look, stop being an idiot and talk to me!" John leaned forward and reached out to grab the back of Sherlock's top, pulling on it and not letting go even as Sherlock continued to try and walk at the same pace. "It doesn't matter to me!"
Lauren looked between them with narrowed eyes. "What, this is about your weirdo housemate? What's he done now?"
John fought every instinct in his body in order to keep quiet – seeing Greg’s astounded gaze flit between the two of them made this exceptionally difficult, knowing that not only was Sherlock’s ‘game’ having an effect on Mycroft but also Sherlock’s housemate. He bound himself to the spot, however, keeping his jaw firmly locked as he waited for Sherlock to finish torturing his brother.
both Mycroft and Greg thought that something was going on between himself and Sherlock, and only because bloody Sherlock had been the one to start the whole charade in the first place… but John had gone along with it. He had gone along with it because he had seen how desperately Sherlock had initially needed to take Mycroft down a peg or two, his own personal feelings towards the oldest Holmes brother also being a fairly strong mitigating factor – at the time he was running so high on his anger that he'd had no issue with playing along.
John waited; he slept as usual, too long, too deep and then awoke to a grey morning, clouds cast across the sky enough that he considered putting the light on – but that would mean having to get out of bed, and that was a thought he didn't particularly relish. Instead he leaned over and pulled the edge of his laptop towards him, brushing his finger over the mousepad and waiting as the screen lit itself up to reveal an empty inbox. Glancing at the bottom right-hand corner – 10am – he wondered if this William guy had changed his mind, perhaps decided that John's obvious reluctance to embark on any sort of journey to academic improvement was simply a sign not to bother with him, and he couldn't really blame the man for that. If John himself couldn't see much of a point in trying, he couldn't blame the egotistical Personal Academic Tutor for not wanting to try either.
His stomach gave another twist, butterflies battling discomfort. His grin twisted into a smaller, awkward smile, feeling as if William could see through the screen and knew exactly what he was doing, how he was feeling. "Is it?"
It could have been for any number of reasons. He probably wasn't the only one who noticed the subtle changes in the dark-haired genius's body language or the palpable tension which filled the huge room from the very first time that bow met instrument, the premier note looping its way across the space between bodies and swirling through the endless heat of bodies until it reached the delicate whorl of an ear, hundreds of ears, the very vibrations of the sound coursing their way through heated veins and down to the epicentre of a place within John's self that he could not quite put a name to. He was sure he couldn't be alone in seeing the lucid, languid movement of Sherlock's arms as he dragged the horsehair across synthetic strings, the muscles in his hands rising and falling with their constant dynamism – in his prime position in front of the raised performance area John was almost achingly aware of the grace in which his friend teased the violin, his eyes tracing the fluidity in Sherlock's sway and the flutter of precise, demanding fingers against the solid neck of the instrument almost as if it were an absolute necessity not to miss a single moment of the genius and his ingenuity.
"Yes you are," John called as he turned away and made a small leap onto the next rock. "Get your arse up here and stop being such a prissy snob. After all... what would Captain William the Brave do?"
Sherlock's nose wrinkled in disgust. "I know enough of her to know she's far and away from being good enough for you."
An amused female voice slipped out of the speakers, quiet but audible in the quiet of the dark room. "I
"Yes, the point of speakerphone is that I can hear you both," John said impatiently, cheeks burning as his gaze flickered to Sherlock and saw his open-mouthed shock at what he assumed was his mentioning of sex. "That's none of your business, either of you."
John couldn't agree more. "When you first mentioned it the other day I started picturing something written by Jane Austen, I won't lie."
Staring at him apprehensively, Sherlock waited a few beats before responding, repeating words John had used only a few hours ago in low, melodic waves of sound. "I'm not your bitch, John."
Nina blinked, hesitating a moment before pushing herself to her feet. "Right, well, you'd better be leaving then…" She walked around the desk and extended her hand, misty grey eyes fixed on his as he reached out and grasped it briefly with his own. "It was nice to meet you, William. I look forward to seeing you next week."
A good point. "Mm. All right. Well, no, not all right. He could have... I don't know... he could've talked to
"Here you are," she sang, walking with her head held high into the living room and handing him a steaming cup of tea, "it's a new brand from that new posh supermarket that opened last month. A nice treat for your homecoming!"
"I'm not asking him if he's wanked before, Harry, christ!" He realised at that moment that he should have made Sherlock leave, seeing instantly the way that Sherlock's body froze and feeling the sheer extent of his discomfort emanating in the short distance between them. "All right, all right. Stop. Stop talking."
“Calm down,” Mycroft admonished, though not unkindly. “You’re losing control, you need to reign it back in.”
"Sherlock's not the sort to have friends, you see," Tim informed him, though it was fairly obvious from the novelty of his arrival that it was an unnecessary statement to make. "Neither of them are. You're the first person we've ever been introduced to."
As the rest of the family busied themselves in the kitchen, pots and pans clattering against plates and filling the dining room with the comforting knowledge that everyone was distracted enough that he could finally answer Sherlock's question of before without interruption, John watched out of the corner of his eye as Sherlock slid from his own chair and began to reach out to take John's empty plate within a steady hand; he did not know how to go about this, how to breach the subject with the genius so artfully avoiding his tentative stare... and it was frustrating. It was frustrating to watch him move around John as if it was of little consequence, picking up the plate and turning away as if he was completely untouched by the tension and the sheer solidity of the space settled awkwardly between them like a wall; he could not find the words, apparently he could
"Why would you leave it in there that long?!" John squinted his eyes at the label, recoiling again just from reading the date. "Best before the eighteenth of April! This milk has been in here nearly as long as I've known you, Sherlock, christ!"
"You had sex with Sally," Sherlock said, his voice sounding weirdly stretched as if it didn't quite fit in his throat anymore, "she isn't your friend."
Mycroft slowly uncrossed his legs, leaning forward a little. “You are never beyond comprehension, Sherlock. You just need to focus.”
If the tension had been too much for John before, it was nothing compared to waiting for William to respond. The silence dragged on.
"Please, John, I'm a graduate chemist. If anyone can handle ingredients and a naked flame around here, it'll be me."
Bloody hell. The implication was obvious. "Well, she's helping them better their lives. People like that are always... looked up to."
John stood abruptly, sending a blanket and two cushions to the ground; Sherlock stood up straighter out of instinct, tilting his chin up as the shorter man stood directly opposite him. He could almost see his friend's eyes flash. Ah. The familiar, unpleasant tension. It was disturbingly welcome. "No. No, I'm not surprised." John's voice was low, as if he were struggling to keep quiet. "I know what you are, Sherlock, and it's hardly a shock to me when you turn into an edgy arsehole. What
John's hand momentarily curled around Sherlock's; if the genius was aware of the movement he did not say a word about it.
"Well, at least he has a friend, no? Benedict," Brooke said with a gentle press of her manicured fingertips to her husband's forearm, "meet our dear Sherlock's friend, John... I do apologise, what was your surname?"
Turning and leaving the room to make his way down the hallway, he let himself enjoy his subtle contentment for a few moments longer before quietly entering the dimly lit living room, eyes searching for John; he was not on the sofa sipping wine, as Sherlock had expected, rather he was in the dining room holding something, examining it with wide eyes and running his fingers over it as if it were something quite alien but quite beautiful -
moment was the wrong moment for defenses with John Hamish Watson, and if he was to do nothing but this tonight, he would keep them down and away for the length of their communication. He must. He absolutely
John’s arms fell to his sides, standing as straight as he possibly could. “I’m sorry, is that a threat?”
Sherlock let the arm holding the papers fall to his side once more, his lips separating as he inhaled a breath in preparation for yet more words to stun and bamboozle John – yet it was to neither of their surprise to find the moment interrupted, tip-tapping on the stairs followed by a more casual thread of movement as both Wanda and Tim appeared at the bottom of the staircase, Wanda smiling brightly and Tim staring at his wife as if he couldn't quite believe what he was seeing; John turned to face them properly, feeling as though his face was on fire and suddenly thinking he knew
"Believe me when I say that I haven't needed your help in a very, very long time, Dad. And if Mum says you're having money issues then I don't doubt her for a second. I don't know where you got that money from or how you think it's as easy as handing me a wad of cash and suddenly everything'll be okay, but
"More than decent," John clarified, looking out towards the grass again, "way more than just decent."
If this is how you like to spend your time then you seriously need to consider jumping off a building or something, because that's really sad, and believe me, I know sad
The eyes that were focused on him held none of the intensity he was used to in such an intent gaze. "It doesn't bother you, then?"
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at the screen, clicking away with his mouse as if he had ever so many important things to do, none of which involving the conversation at hand. “I would’ve thought you’d like that sort of thing. You’re a romantic, after all.”
As John stared in shock at Sherlock, lips working over words that hadn't quite arrived in his mind yet, he became almost devastatingly aware of the sudden fear rippling in deep pools towards the back of Sherlock's gaze; it was almost as if Sherlock truly thought, somewhere in the recesses of his mind, that John would say no – that John didn't want to live with him. And Greg. Greg would be there too, of course.
My expectations are only as high as they should be considering your marks before this odd little downfall of yours. You were evidently well on your way to earning the equivalent of a first in your pre-medical year until a month ago, so it grieves me that you consider your current gradings as acceptable. I was under the impression that you were intending to bring your marks back up again, hence our current conversation, however I may have to consider the possibility that I am wrong.
“FUCKing HELL.” John wrenched himself off of the bed and onto his feet, head spinning slightly as he let his arms fall to his sides and he shook his head violently from side to side. “We're supposed to be going down to dinner with two very dysfunctional parents who have no idea that as well as having a lesbian daughter, they
"No? Hmm, all right. I guess I'll have to remind you again." The wicked grin was not dissipating. Sherlock's palms were starting to feel a little clammy. "So, the other night, after the ball -"
She put the iron down and turned to him, looking every inch like a mother who was about to ask a very, very awkward question - and John would know. His own mother was full of them. "I hope you don't think I'm interfering, and don't hesitate to tell me to leave you alone and go back to my ironing, but..."
Wrote this whilst I was absolutely exhausted, so if it's a pile of poop I'm genuinely sorry! I know it's really short too, but was still tons of fun to write!
"Well then." Neil blinked a few times, his hand lifting to wipe at his mouth as if he had felt the full impact of John's disregard for him and it had left him bleeding. "I suppose I've had that coming for a while."
"I gave you a chance!" There was no hint of sarcasm to Sherlock's tone as three hard thuds followed his words. "I came to your room and apologised!"
"Forget about Mycroft," Sherlock cut across him, tone suddenly testy. His hands gripped his arms tighter, tips of his fingers going white. "He is entirely unimportant. If and when I wish to discuss him I will bring it up in conversation, but until then I would very much prefer if you could just let it go."
Mycroft raised his eyes to the ceiling. “Which is it? As you said, brother mine, I don’t have all night. Some of us have jobs to get to tomorrow morning.”
"Well, if she's anything like you she'll have tons of them at her doorstep." She flashed him a smile. "She'll be beating men away with a stick!"
"Someone you're just friends with doesn't do all of that," she interrupted gently. "It just doesn't happen. I know you think you're being selfless by focusing on his feelings and I
Rather than the usual t-shirt and jeans ensemble that Sherlock had come to recognise upon the mousey-haired pre-med student, he wore what Sherlock could only describe as an ensemble far more suited to someone ten or even twenty years older than he was; he still wore jeans, though these looked oddly new, stiff and perhaps even a little uncomfortable – none of the soft-looking worn out bits or the danger of them falling over his slender hips. The shirt that John wore also looked new, almost painfully white in the light from the hallway and the collar so immoveable that Sherlock was certain that if he were to touch it the material would not shift underneath his probing fingers. Then, of course, there was the jumper. Old. A dark, blueish grey. Definitely soft. Worn often yet Sherlock had never seen it before.
Another reference to Harry; another awkward moment. "I just never really have anything I want to spend it on. The most I spend tends to be on textbooks and such, and the occasional meal out."
could in a situation like this. "I have no desire to form such a bond and certainly no willing participants."
"Yes. The moment you mentioned it I was filled with a blaze of triumph, a genuine thrill; perhaps I should have realised at that moment that I was without control of the situation, that if I did meet you I would find my intent to disregard the growing sentiment completely scuppered, yet I didn't see it. I didn't acknowledge it. I simply encouraged you, rather desperately I might add, to go to Greg's party, all the while utterly certain of the outcome."
Mycroft’s gaze was steady. “Gregory told me that John was injured. You are here, clearly shaken, resisting vulnerability, and you have yet to tell me the real reason as to why you turned up on my doorstep at 11 o’clock at night. You have blood on your shirt which is evidently not your own and considering he so blindly overlooked your drug addiction in order to pursue a relationship with you I am relatively certain that you feel a certain level of responsibility for him and his care.” His own chin tilted up, matching Sherlock’s arrogance without hesitation. “Therefore you wouldn’t have left him to care for himself.”
"Of course," she clarified brightly, pouring gravy over her vegetables, "they'd send out a search party if we didn't! John, dear," she turned to him slightly, handing him the gravy boat, "you'll come too, won't you?"
At that, John raised his head and found himself staring for the first time at Sherlock; the genius avoided his eyeline completely, but that didn't stop John from feeling like he was holding a live wire and all too close to being shocked. He heard the raucous laughter of Harry in his head and violently kicked at it. "Perform? You're going to perform?"
John couldn't refrain from rolling his eyes. “Like I said, we're not co-dependent. We're doing fine. It's no different to any other time we haven't been together.”
The casual reference to his roleplaying days made John's stomach fill with warmth and forced him to fight the desire to reach out and touch Sherlock to show just how much that small allusion to his childhood meant. "Well, far be it from me to stop you from pillaging and plundering. I could help, if you want."
He'd managed to get one button undone by the time Sherlock walked in with the bowl of steaming water and a white flannel. The look on his face was back to his standard impassive.
The smirk upon Mycroft's face deepened. "This isn't a test, John, you don't need to try and impress anyone."
John turned quickly, seeing the tall, pale form of Mycroft’s younger brother making his way down the stairs; god, he looked terrible. John had seen better-looking corpses.
The skin over John's hands tightened. "Fine. Lewis. You felt guilty for me getting hurt on the way to your illicit gathering of information or drugs or whatever you were picking up -"
Harry's lips twisted into a genuinely amused smile. “Pussy. But, all right, I'll keep quiet about it provided you actually tell me what you're thinking right now rather than stomping it down like you usually do. Deal?”
"No, we don't need to change anything," John said with a sigh, forcing himself to look up and at Sherlock as if it were no difficult feat. It disturbed him that it
“You know what I mean, Mycroft. Why are you here, at home, rather than working your way up to running the country?”
"I'll have to have some proof of this magical skill in the kitchen before he goes back in September," she mused, winding her way around a bush of berries and idly plucking one off to pop into her mouth. "You'll have to help me convince him though, John, I imagine I'll need your input!"
to taste, and so he did, his lips tearing away and brushing over the skin like wildfire and bringing about within him a sense of righteousness, a pulse of desire and a denial that there was anything wrong with this picture, nothing wrong whatsoever in finding his hands ceaselessly working at Sherlock's belt buckle as his own hips jerked ruthlessly to find the friction he so ardently needed and not being disappointed with the hiss of breath escaping from perfect lips and his own coarse grunt at the glorious sensation he had created –
Rolling his eyes to the ceiling and doing nothing to hide it from Sherlock's unseeing eyes, John gently pressed his palm to his friend's forehead – it was cool, clammy to the touch certainly but no sign of a fever. "Well... you don't have a fever."
He pushed the door open and climbed out after her, shaking his head and turning to stare up at the towering mansion in front of him. "Of course not, you don't flap at all – blimey, how many bedrooms does this place have?!"
John doesn’t miss a thing. His eyes harden again and, with almost awe-inspiring authority, he takes a step forward and closes a rather large portion of the gap between them: Sherlock can feel, now, the body heat emanating from the smaller man and, within an instant, he feels the magnetic force between them flip - suddenly his chances of leaving the room have settled to
Sherlock sighed again. "I wasn't aware that there was a universal standard. My hand is on his and our hands are therefore touching, you could in fact say that my hand, cupped as it is over John's, is
Mr. Holmes ambled into the room, holding a newspaper and wearing a pair of glasses that were so odd to see on the face of a man that looked so much like his son that for a moment John could only stare; christ, he looked so much like Sherlock. In glasses. "Did you burn one of my shirts again?"
Sherlock's voice had the warmth of his signature tiny grin within it. "You have my word. As amusing as it's been to see you spiral into a pit of embarrassment and confusion I think it would be better for the both of us if you were to refrain from encouraging me to drink what now feels like my body-weight in vodka."
To John's surprise, Sherlock simply smiled – a big smile, one with teeth and crinkly eyes... positively
"I wish you would, John," Sherlock murmured, turning his face away and closing his eyes. "Truly I do."
He felt increased pressure of fingertips on his thighs, Sherlock reacting to his words before the boy could even properly respond with words – and what words they were. "No. No. I couldn't have touched you, I knew I couldn't have touched you -"
"Yeah, well I think you're probably excited enough for at least half of the party, Molly," he said with a small smile, reaching up and untangling her arm from around him and patting it lightly with his other hand before letting it go. "Had a few drinks, have we?"
anymore, really?) and was very much feeling it go to his head, warm and constant bursts of confidence flushing through his system and making him rather chatty, more and more so with every group of people they came across. He had met a girl on his journey, the daughter of one of Tim's work colleagues, who was starting her medical course later that year if she got good A Levels, and she had asked him plenty of questions about his experiences so far. She hadn't laughed in his face when she'd told her that he was taking a pre-medical year, instead sharing her own stories of essay hell and her hate for Physics and the fact that she had to take it; she was rather charming, if he was to tell the truth, and he was rather disappointed when Mycroft had sauntered over and asked him to come and meet some other family that he would forget the name of within minutes of walking away from them – not that he was so rude as to not care, simply that he couldn't possibly remember
John rolled his eyes, leaning back on his chair and folding his arms. "Oh, what, you can interfere with my problems but I can't interfere in yours?"
felt – and he had to admit that there were still a few threads of doubt within him despite Greg's reams of confirmation the night before – he couldn't let his friend off the hook completely. There had to be
"Hmmph. I don't want to go to the supermarket." The tall, stubborn man-child noisily stirred hot water into the cup, soaking the teabags. "It's loud and... full of people."
"But I firmly believe, John, that if you give it a little time and if you just... risk it... you'll find that you come to look forward to these sessions. Well," Jim grinned, leaning back, the tension instantly bursting, "maybe not look forward to them, but at least approach them with a sense of relief. To offer you a complete cliché, this is a safe space for you. You can say whatever you like here and know that it won't go further than these four walls."
John stared at him for a moment, pursing his lips; well, as far as he could tell… Sherlock wasn't lying. Thankfully. "All right. Good. So, what, my medical records?"
"I'd rather keep my socks on if that's all right, but I'll give it a go anyway," John agreed, taking the bottle off of Greg and twisting the cap off, tipping until a quarter of the cup was full of the green stuff. "Will it make me ill?"
John slowly made his way back over to his friend, perching on the edge of the desk chair and looking at him closely. "
It was like going back in time: the construct of his sentences, the stiff tone, the not-so-vague insult - John could barely recognise the man from last night to the one sitting inches from him now, yet in an odd way he found that it was… reassuring, maybe? Though he hadn't thought on it much, whether intentionally avoiding it or not, the truth was that his biggest concern was that things would change between them; he wasn't ignorant, he'd been there before – the dynamic of a relationship changed when... other things... were involved. Of course it was true to say that they hadn't yet specified what the nature of their relationship would involve; for all John knew it would be a whirlwind of a confusing summer full of secret kisses and suspicious mothers but it would all end once Sherlock moved back to Well Place and John... well. John still needed to find somewhere to live.
Fingers were suddenly briefly touching his wrist, warm and hesitant - he jerked roughly out of his head and found John standing directly in front of him, a look of concern worrying the edges of his lips; he felt his heart jump erratically to find John this close. "Ah."
,” Mycroft interrupted, plucking an umbrella from behind the chair and leaning on it like a cane. “I assured your mother I would keep an eye on you during your studies and I am certainly not going to let you miss lectures simply because you’ve lost out on a little sleep.”
"Shh." The noise was far too close to his ear for comfort, the breath warm against his cool skin. He felt Sherlock shift, hands loosening their grip on his arms and eventually letting go despite him still remaining almost pressed against the smaller man. When Sherlock spoke, his voice was barely a whisper. "There's a security guard out in the hall."
Her arms were around him and squeezing him tight before he'd even had a chance to look stand up straight.
“No need to lie,” Sherlock said shortly, shifting from one leg to the other and allowing a quick glimpse up at his older brother – naturally he was in his dressing gown, likely having been woken up by Sherlock’s continuous hammering on the door. He felt no remorse. “Can I come in?”
Nina slowly moved back to rest her back against the chair, fiddling with her pen as she observed him before speaking quietly out into the silence as he lost himself in the images that were now overwhelming him. "Let's stop there."
Though he could not see out of the back of his head (and judging by the prickling sensation of the death-glare he was sure was being shot at him he was rather glad that he couldn't) he heard as Sherlock took his reluctant steps towards the counter and slid the sharp instrument towards him, and the deep sigh that followed. "I don't know why you're bothering."
"This is getting ridiculous now," William huffed. John could almost imagine his faceless body folding his arms and looking intensely sulky. "We may as well end the conversation here for all the good it's doing."
He shook his head, irritated at the way his head was making things seem. He tapped out a reply perhaps a little harder than he should have:
Sighing, a sound that seemed to have been on repeat all night – morning – John brought the phone away and noted with concern the exceedingly low battery, as well as three text messages. He fumbled behind his bedside table for the cable to plug his phone in, shoving it untidily into the slot and flicking through various menus to read his texts.
Sherlock's lips separated, surprise etched on his pale face. "What a ridiculous statement to make. Of
Perhaps it should bother him more that Sherlock had most likely used such a device to drag the truth of John’s distance into the open, but he was distracted – as he had been the whole day. He watched Sherlock’s face closely, trying as hard as he possibly could to glean something from it so that he ascertain whether it would be a positive or negative reaction, but as usual Sherlock was stupidly difficult to read… god, would he ever get any better at reading his friend? Or would he spend the rest of their time together constantly wondering, all the while with Sherlock able to ‘observe’ John’s innermost thoughts without having to say a word?
"About what?" Sherlock was frowning now, though John knew it was purely in order to mock him. "There's nothing more to say to you. The situation is as you've been told, though no doubt with a few embellishments, and nothing I can say or do will change what you think about it. So there's nothing more to say."
Eyes widening slightly, John moved the mousepoint to the little flashing bar and clicked it, watching apprehensively as the little window appeared before him on the screen.
"Sorry," John said, slightly abashed but knowing to take it in good humour, "but I promise it was meant in an entirely affectionate way."
take over his life as he had so far, he would never become a doctor. He'd never be what he wanted to be, dreamed of being.
An exasperated sigh drew itself from John's throat as he shook his head, placing his hands on his hips. "Because apparently I need to get pissed off with you at least once a day or the world will implode, I don't know." He brought his hands up to his face, rubbing it hard, skin still hot despite the cold air around them. "Goddamn it, William."
His cheeks flushed slightly at the compliment, his eyes trying to take in how different he looked and wondering if he would get used to it. Not that he'd probably wear one ever again. He tried for a positive comment. "I scrub up all right, don't I?"
As the game continued, John began to discover something happening the more and more he had to drink. He of course had two people either side of him – a guy who was blatantly an ardent smoker on his left and, naturally, Sherlock on his right-hand side. Both of them were wedged in just as tightly as he was, the sides of their bodies pressed against his enough that after a while and enough alcohol it seemed as if they were simply an additional limb, no longer bothering him... or, at least, that was the effect the guy to his left was having. Disturbingly, the effect seemed to be reversed for the man on his right. The more alcohol John consumed, the burning sambuca leaving a seemingly permanent lick of heat down his chest at every sip, the more aware he was of Sherlock's body mashed against his, warm from the amount of bodies in one room and the increasing amount of alcohol that was coursing through both of their veins. Every time Sherlock moved his arm John felt a zing of friction from the material of Sherlock's shirt against his bare arm – he had wisely chosen to wear a simple black t-shirt that night, knowing how hot it would get in the little house – and became rather highly aware of the way his hairs reacted to the contact, standing on end for a few moments before settling once more over his skin.
"Apologise to your mother," Tim ordered quietly, his own eyes on his wife rather than his youngest son. "And do as she says. Sit down."
"Ah." The lips that John could see twitched up into an almost insignificantly small smile. "Of course I am. And so? This is yet another part of myself that I'm seemingly unable to change and therefore something that you think to be...
Sherlock sat on the armchair with a laptop precariously balanced on the arm, a cup of tea in his hand; he was already dressed, no longer in a polo-shirt and jeans but the fitted shirt and trousers that John had come to associate with him. Over the top of the shirt it looked as if he were wearing a robe, burgundy and well-worn, an odd addition to his usual formality but strangely fitting whilst sitting with no shoes on and a cup of tea brought calmly to his lips.
They sat in silence for a few minutes, the ticking of the clock in the dining room highlighting the space of time in which neither of them spoke; John couldn't tell if it was awkward or not. More frustratingly, he had no idea what Sherlock was thinking or what his motivations behind everything that evening had been and he knew that without actually asking aloud he would never know the answer. The question the man had asked him to ask himself –
Mycroft turned the page, scanning the latest article covering the crisis in Syria and processing it within seconds as he allowed Sherlock a brief, patronising moment of silence before responding. “And that's why you've been sitting there in complete silence for the last two hours, is it? Has your mind slowed so considerably in the past 48 hours?” He tutted, the noise temporarily masking the incessant brush of fingertips against material. “Your sentiment is rendering you obtuse, Sherlock.”
“Fucking hell – I’m going to bed,” Greg grumbled loudly with a frown in John’s direction – clearly he was wondering how he had the patience to put up with one of the Holmes’ brothers, let alone both, undoubtedly questioning his sanity. “See you in a few hours, Sherlock. And John,” he added almost unwillingly, looking awkward at the possibility, “suppose I might see you too.”
There was no idle chit-chat; Sherlock had already made it clear he had no patience for such things, rolling his eyes whenever John mentioned the weather or tried to initiate a conversation about Sherlock's family. Instead they had sat in almost companionable silence, Sherlock occasionally remarking on people walking past the large window overlooking the high street – cutting remarks, usually, smirking depictions of their infidelity, nicotine addictions and general faults and failures. John was fine with this. He was starting to get used to the fact that Sherlock wasn't quite like any friend he'd had before and that the things he said weren't said out of spite or cruelty, merely because they came to mind and he saw no reason to hold back what he was really thinking.
Sherlock whirled around and was suddenly taking two, three, four steps towards him – John stopped dead: surprised, unsure - "
"Oh, I know." John took a dangerous leap onto a rock perhaps a little far out of his reach, only just making it as a rush of air escaped his lips and a childish rush of adrenaline raced through his body at such an easy pleasure. "You don't need to tell me that, Sherl- well, actually, no. I should probably be calling you, Captain, right?"
Now, however, there was more than just John's depression and Sherlock's unpredictability to deal with, and it was such a
She shot him a look from under lowered lashes, pulling away from John and tutting. "I don't know, wherever did you learn those bad manners from? Certainly not me or your father." She turned once more to John, the same warm smile offered to him that she had worn before, utterly changing her; she was beautiful. He accepted and returned the smile gratefully if not a little awkwardly, about to speak before she continued. "Take no notice of Mikey, he's just hungry."
It took John a moment to realise that Sherlock was referring to the observatory. He started to walk, knowing the tall pain in his arse would follow. "It's called
John's face was a sight to behold, torn between genuine frustration and confusion. “And you let me sit here, absorbing everything you were saying and feeling like my bloody heart was – no, that's not fair, Sherlock, that's just not on -”
"Oh christ, no, don't go there," John mumbled, shaking his head and burying his face completely in his hands, "I can't even think about that right now. Fucking hell. Jesus Christ. Shitting
"Sentiment will only get the both of you hurt, and believe me when I say that I would go to any lengths to ensure that my brother escapes that burden."
"You were right in saying that I don't know you, that you don't know much - if anything - about me, but I think... you should know..." William's voice broke off. "Ugh, you should be aware..."
"No," Sherlock dissented, head lifting and eyes swivelling until they focused, unseeing, on John's chin. "My head
So here's the deal: I'm 31 years old now. A proper adult, apparently, though I'd beg to differ in many respects; either way, I'm living a life, in a house, with a partner and a cat, and sometimes shit can get too big to handle. I haven't written in an incredibly long time, most likely not since that last chapter in 2017, and I can't say that I've felt the motivation or inspiration to do so - probably didn't help (in regards to the fic) that season four was such a hot mess. Kinda takes the edge off of it.
"Sherlock's mum suspects, though," John said quietly, bringing the phone closer to his lips. "She asked me about it a few days after I arrived, and that was before anything even happened between us."
As the driver came around to open his door for him (as if he needed assistance) the woman – Mrs. Holmes – began to hurry down the path towards him, all flapping hands, flowing sleeves and a genuinely warm, welcoming smile; her husband followed her, looking down at the path as he walked with a small, fond smile of his own, the expression clearly a response to his wife's enthusiasm. John had seen that smile before upon Sherlock's own face, funnily enough in response to his own thoughts of the very same woman. He knew before he'd even slipped out of the car and into her oncoming path that he would, whether he wanted to or not, love her.
John felt a bubble of nervous apprehension pop in his stomach – he'd actually forgotten about the damned counselling appointment. Ugh.
it was doing. He gripped the laptop hard, ultimately determined to hold onto it as best as he could whilst it lasted. "You'd be surprised."
Unsure as to whether he was supposed to put his clothes away in the drawers or not, he zipped open his little suitcase and took out the few toiletries he'd brought along with him, cautiously entering the en-suite and trying not to feel too much like a pauper amidst the shining white porcelain suite within – the shower was a veritable beast, the cubicle surely big enough for two people, so many buttons and settings on its power system that he felt, not for the first time since he had arrived, daunted. Never before in his life had John felt so exceedingly common, and if it were to ever happen – not that it would if Sherlock truly was intent on ending their friendship – he knew that inviting Sherlock to his home would be incredibly embarrassing and he'd feel almost ashamed to show him his small, unimpressive home and his simple, dull life.
Walking back around to the other side of her desk, Joanne sat down heavily on her desk chair and pulled her laptop towards her. With diligent fingers and John's downcast face in her mind, she opened up Microsoft Outlook and began typing a new email.
"You see? As ever, I am right." There was no victory to his tone; if anything he seemed to deflate in stature and lose any hint of defensiveness. He was a husk again. "Due to the incompetence of my brother and housemate, our friendship has reached the end of its course. The best thing to do now would be to walk away and refrain from contacting each other again."
John tried to force a smile as his fingers slipped over the button and he had to start again. "What about you?"
It didn't stop him. He squeezed her fingers as lightly as he could, so breakable she now seemed to him. Already so broken. He could not fix her, he had never been able to fix her regardless of all of his best efforts. Despite all he had realised over the past few days – her horrendous behaviour towards Harry, her unintentional but still undeniably damaging conditioning of his behaviour, the sheer narrow-mindedness that she simply could not change, no matter how much her children desperately needed her to – he could feel nothing but pity. It was an emotion he loathed, a useless waste of a feeling, but it clung to him like oil and would, he knew, be a stain that he would find near impossible to remove on his own.
John could not say that he was conscious. He was awake, it was true, but the sheer velocity of his headache and the constant desire to drift back into a sleep that tasted of Sambuca and hangover was just too powerful. His mind failed to connect with anything, though for the first time in a long time this was largely down to mitigating circumstances rather than the big black dog: yet another point scored for alcohol. Never before had he considered being hungover as a good thing, but suffice it to say that it was a welcome relief not to feel the crushing weight of nothingness and instead feel the dragging ache of a baby migraine.
John's stare flickered to meet his. Something darted across his expression, so quickly that Sherlock almost couldn't identify it – realisation, understanding, something odd and seemingly out of place – and disappeared as rapidly as it had come. Sherlock took a step back.
“You’re right, though.” The interruption sounded strained, as if Sherlock was struggling to say the words he was so often hearing himself. His hands twitched awkwardly at his sides, looking awfully like a lost child trying to find direction in a new place. “I will.”
Warmth flooded his veins like the rapidly diminishing sun; John found his fingers uncurling from his palm and instead unintentionally twitching in the direction of the man now looking at him as if he couldn't quite believe his luck, the breeze gently soothing the sudden rush of blood to his cheeks.
Laughing more still, Molly turned and headed back into the house, her slightly shrill voice floating back out of the door as he walked towards it - "MIKE! It's JOHN!" - and giving him every reason to want to turn around and call a cab to take him home... but no, he was in the door now and had closed it behind him, he might as well give it a few more minutes before he gave up entirely.
Sherlock looked away again, back at the screen. "When I was a child I wanted to be a pirate. In my head I was Captain William The Brave with my faithful first mate... Redbeard The Hairy."
Leaving a gaping Greg standing in the kitchen doorway, John allowed Sherlock to steer him to the other side of the garden and to the small metal gate. The taller man leaned down and unlatched it with a flick of his fingers, a murmur falling from his lips and onto John's shoulder as he did so.
A deep, recognisable voice. John shifted slightly, suddenly aware that he was lying down. His eyes were closed, too. Hm.
This situation had escalated so quickly, like every other situation when a Holmes was involved; her phrasing, too, was different this time, too hard to dodge – he didn't want to lie, not when she was no longer asking about a relationship but rather inferring that
A flash of ice-blue and razor-sharp cheekbones flashed before his eyes. A surge of longing flooded his entire body. "I've hardly spoken to her, Mum, I only know the basics."
"Recently?" The deep voice came from the entrance to the kitchen, Sherlock standing beside his father with a raised eyebrow and amusement glittering in his eyes. "John, you underestimate yourself. I'd be more inclined to go with
"Yes, my best friend actually. I'd always thought of it as totally platonic, we never mucked around when we were kids or anything, we'd kissed once maybe but that was just to see what kissing was all about." John stomach knotted slightly at the notion of kissing; he hadn't forgotten. He'd thought of it more than he wanted to admit. "But then, eleven years later, he's telling me he's always been in love with me and he'd do anything for a chance with me. It was hard to tell him no."
Sherlock paused at the edge of his rock, eyes scanning the other rocks around him before turning back to look at John. "Fearsome? You're not fearsome."
"It means that she's noticed that something's going on between us and she's concerned. So she's giving us a chance to make nice by working together."
expecting a barrage of demands to tell me what I’d been so distracted by. After all,” he said lightly, shrugging with just as much casual attitude as Sherlock himself was currently displaying, “you’ve been fighting the urge to do it all day.”
"Sorry," John repeated, shaking his head but letting his hands fall from his face; he was quickly realising how ridiculous his panic had been. "Sorry, that's not me, I wasn't... I'm fine. I didn't mean to overreact. I just... christ. Are you sure?"
John was well aware that everything Sherlock was saying made sense, yet the words he had given John seemed to litter his mind in a fragmented, confusing way which just made his head hurt and wish he had never brought it up in the first place. “Right.”
"Oh." John felt the uncomfortable pressure of knowing he'd asked a question that clearly had some unresolved issues attached. "Redbeard... is that in reference to anything?"
Greg shifted on his chair slightly, looking between them awkwardly. “Don't want to be a prick about it -”
John groaned for the millionth time that morning, dragging his hand down his face and feeling the images of the night before flood back to him. He could remember things in general, blurry detail, though some things stuck out in particular: Sherlock’s intense gaze during his warning about substance abuse; the clapping game; the final shot of Sambuca; Molly and her constant cheek-kissing; Sherlock’s hand on his shoulder; Greg’s face when he thought they were gay – oh god. Oh
"I tend to spend a lot of Friday and Saturday evenings down here; gives me some time to do my experiments and assignments in peace, though, so I withhold from complaining too often." A yawn, more muffled movement – stretching, perhaps? "I think I'd rather like to sleep now, if you're completely finished asking questions?"
"Please don't lecture me about what he is or is not feeling, John, I know far better than you the way that his mind works; I'm well aware that he's damaged and that this is a dangerous situation, I merely think that you've done all that you can do and it's time to deal with it in a different manner." His tone softened. "Go home and get some rest. I will call you tomorrow to let you know of the outcome."
His depressive habits hadn't changed much since those first few days of it settling into his system. He still slept too much. He hadn't really been eating right, mostly because he was loathe to leave his room for too long lest he see someone who would try to talk to him and end up wondering why they had sought him out when he was clearly no more interesting than a slipper. His thoughts primarily consisted of either not much of anything at all, a messy mulch, or the constant thought of what a failure he was turning out to be. Maybe if there had been some sort of situation that had set it off, maybe if a relative had died or he'd been rejected by a woman or even if his self-esteem had taken a plummet he could have blamed it on that and dealt with the issue at the base of it, but the cold, hard fact remained that there was nothing that had set the depression off. It had just... appeared. It had taken the foundations from beneath the usually grounded and sensible young man and turned him into a walking, barely-talking shadow of his former self.
His bottom lip found its way between his teeth and began gnawing away. "Can we not focus on that part right now?"
"Really?" John raised an eyebrow and turned to look at Sherlock properly, genuinely surprised. "Because it'd be all right if you are. I bloody am."
The look that flashed across Sherlock's pale eyes was odd; John couldn't quite identify it. It disappeared as quickly as it had come. "Quite right. Then did you at least find him acceptable to you as the means to an end of your depression?"
Greg's signature grin sparked to life upon his tanned face. “Sounds about right. Still, Mrs. H wants to meet John pretty soon to sort out signing contracts and whatnot, so either you're gonna have to take a train over to London sometime in the next week or you're going back earlier than you'd planned.”
Taking his hand back, John sighed. "I wish you'd stop lying to me about the food poisoning, though, I just want to help -"
John sighed; god, this was a lot of effort. "Well I'm not exactly in charge of how I feel day by day right now, am I? You'll have to just... be patient with me, as I'm going to have to be with you."
"If we had the money, John, you know we'd give it to you. We're in a bit of a tight spot at the moment what with your father having a bit of time off -"
"Yes, yes, quite... blimey, have you seen this, Wanda? Goring United have picked up Benjamin Greyson for the next season!"
Mycroft began to walk towards them with an eye-roll, hands in his pockets. "No need to exaggerate, Mummy, he knows very well that you didn't even know of his existence before yesterday."
Greg's no doubt inappropriate response was cut off by a low bleeping sound; he raised his mobile to his eyeline and quickly glanced at the content of the text message. "Oh. Greenwich Park."
And just like that, it was over. Silence fell over the ballroom and John was left so very full and so very hollow all at once as Sherlock let the bow drop to his side and the lulling piano ceased its pattering, the tall genius stepping forward without even so much as a smile, cheeks flushed as he gave a small bow as the applause thundered around the room:
doesn't even have the decency to tell me that he knows." His icy eyes were fixed on John's like a magnet. "Of course I'm overreacting. How very silly of me."
bed you can manage perfectly well in John’s.” The twisted grimace was back; it looked almost as if his brain had forgotten quite
"No, but it's more than that, it's more than just being an intense friendship. He is... more important to me... than anyone. Anyone." He found that he could no longer look at Greg. The staircase suddenly became of great interest. "And I'm not saying it's romantic or it isn't because right now I just have no bloody idea
Back at square one. "Fine. We're both too scared." His lips curved up into a humourless smile, his shoulder raising in a sharp shrug as he backed away and towards his bedroom door. "Let's leave it there, then, shall we? I'll pack and leave tomorrow. This was clearly the mistake I was trying to avoid and now it's... done. I realise that now."
As the two brothers stared at once another, misty blue fixed upon verdigris, the heavy weight of acceptance began to fall upon stiffly-set shoulders and it became increasingly and resolutely obvious as to how this conversation, this veritable mess of conclusions, would end. Sherlock would need to be pushed, and Mycroft – then, now and probably in future – would have to be the one in which to fulfil that responsibility.
. “When what? Are you...” Neil eyed the car again, clearly flummoxed. “Are you at the right address?”
John pushed the laptop away and muttered to himself, picking up some of the papers strewn around him and muttering a little more.
"No," Sherlock interjected quickly, leaning back as if trying to get further away from the switch, "leave it off. I would... prefer it to be dark."
"So make us drink already," John said with a sigh, slowly lifting his glass to ready himself, "because apparently we haven't already done enough of that
"All right boys," Greg said with a massive shit-eating grin, folding his arms as he leaned back and fixed his vengeful eyes on them both (when had he started blaming John for Sherlock's sadism?!), "Loz and I have decided that for the rest of the game you have to hold hands
John obeyed, letting his muscles relax into the soft leather – ah, this leather, this was familiar too. He'd slept here before. Well Place. Sherlock's home.
Tim's voice was as calm as ever in response to his wife's obvious distress, walking out of the bathroom and towards the bedroom. "Perhaps they're in your jewellery box with the rest of your collection?"
many times in his childhood, and knowing that she had done it – at least in part – because of what he'd divulged... god, it was awful. He had to fix it. He had to do
John stepped out into the hallway and padded his way slowly down the stairs; to his surprise the whole Holmes family was in the kitchen, dressing gowns aplenty and each one of them seemingly busy with helping to cook breakfast. Tim, mumbling to himself, was poking at some bacon frying in the biggest frying pan John had ever seen; Wanda, humming along to the radio, was cracking eggs onto yet another frying pan; Mycroft was lingering by the toaster, flicking through something on his phone – work, no doubt; and then there was Sherlock, messy hair completely untamed, buttering the toast that was already sitting on the countertop and glancing up as John stepped from the stairs and looking as if he were the epitome of a rabbit caught in headlights.
John shot Sherlock an irritated glance before turning his attention to Greg, determined not to let the grumpy genius get to him. "I imagine Sherlock is referring to the fact that we both got our counselling referrals yesterday. I have my initial consultation on Monday, he's got his on Tuesday."
Everyone around the table quickly pointed their fingers to the ceiling, some laughter as the slightly more inebriated of the group took a little more time to realise what was going on; Sherlock's hands remained around his glass, brow furrowed, looking completely bemused.
The point was, however, that John didn't want to survive anything. He didn't want anything to end, nor change. The important part to him wasn't that they needed each other, though he would at least admit that this
Her eyes, darkest brown and nothing like his own, were sparkling. "Oh, be on with you. You like her, enough to tell me about her – you must have more to say about her than that!"
Sherlock shrugged. "He wasn't exactly stunned when Mother started to insinuate that there was something going on. And no doubt she's told him what I told her the other day."
He took it with a nod of appreciation, holding it with the tips of his fingers so as not to burn himself. "Brilliant. Thanks, Mum. So -" he braced himself, " - how have you been?"
"Then you're under a misapprehension." Her words were almost stern. It was better than the warmth. "It takes strength, not weakness, to open up to someone."
Sighing in exasperation, John found himself standing in the middle of the room, ready to start pacing at any moment. "Well, what, is he ill? Drunk? In the middle of shagging someone?"
He was also in his pyjamas. As was John. As it turned out, John's pyjamas consisted of a plain white t-shirt and boxer shorts. Sherlock wasn't wearing underwear.
Yes, you do know sad, don't you? Mm, it's surprising to me that you have no energy considering the fact that you spend most of your days sleeping, avoiding the monotonous routine of life and all the greys and blacks that seem to accompany every waking moment you find yourself trapped within.
As he waited for the elderly barman to pour his two lagers and a cider, his foot tapping idly on the wooden floor as his eyes circled the room, he felt a buzzing in his pocket; he slipped his hand into the confined space, inching his phone out into the open and quickly tapping through to read his text:
John raised his hand, stopping her in her tracks. “No. No. Let's steer clear of that last thing, all right? I know I've told you some things about my aforementioned 'psychological well-being', but I don't want to discuss it. If we're going to have this conversation, we avoid referencing any of that entirely. Agreed?”
"Calm down," Greg said, rolling his own eyes, "and shut up if you want me to actually bother explaining. Mycroft and me had already figured out that you were different and that Sherlock was starting to change because of you. In a good way," he seemed to feel the need to add, "in the sort of way where Sherlock was actually starting to communicate with the two of us about... well, anything. Usually he kind of ignores our existence unless forced to acknowledge us, but since you started becoming a bigger part of the picture he started to talk to us. Started to respond to questions, giving minor details. Not about you, just about stuff in general. That in itself was pretty astounding."
going to start becoming a problem!" John was adamant despite his better judgement, his stomach fluttering and his palms starting to sweat once more, just like it had before with bloody Sherlock and before Greg had walked into the bloody room. "Please, just... you have to tell me. I can't guess this, I can't figure it out on my own and I don't even know if I want to, so just tell me. Get it out. Tell me and stop trying to protect either one of us as you're clearly trying to do." He leaned forward. "
me.” The tone was insistent, agitated. John raised his eyes and saw Sherlock frowning, lips slightly open. “I warn you, I have a very short fuse tonight. I won’t want to ask more than twice.”
John's spine straightened and his hands curled into gentle fists. "Maybe you should stop worrying about what -"
He allowed her to press a kiss to his cheek with no sign of discontent, grinning and shoving his hands in his pockets as he stepped back. "Yeah, they're just coming now."
"Make sure you rest, John. Don't wear yourself out with all that pondering you so ardently think you need to do. That's what the counselling is for."
"Hmm?" Sherlock finished his gulp, shuddering and putting the glass back on the table, turning his head slightly to the left to look at his friend. "What was that, John? You were mumbling, you know I can't stand it when you mumble."
Sherlock made a small noise in the back of his throat. "If that were the case, Lewis, I expect there'd be far more blood on James's person, don't you think?" The two of them laughed in tandem, and the laugh was so unfamiliar from Sherlock that John had to fight the urge not to turn and stare at him whilst Lewis was still so intently looking at him. "No, he cut his hand on the way here."
John strode into the kitchen with two plastic bags full of food in one hand, throwing his jacket onto the table with the other and shaking his head in almost embarrassed disbelief. "I am never,
"Well!" Tim placed his knife and fork neatly on the edge of his plate, leaning back in his chair and offering the room a smile of pure contentment. "I don't think I could possibly manage dessert for at least another half an hour after that feast!"
I don't have the energy or the patience to deal with it, and quite frankly you should bugger off and try to get a bit more of a life
John had completely and utterly forgotten about it. He hadn't even made plans to go home yet. "Oh, christ. Yeah."
John nodded his thanks, putting down his knife and fork and reaching out for his glass. "I'm in my pre-medical year at the moment, doing modules in Biology, Chemistry and Physics. I did completely useless subjects for A Level so I've got a bit of catching up to do."
“Quite.” Sherlock allowed the point, though did not explain his willing reticence. “It just appears to me that perhaps it would be less of an emotional uproar for you if you were to go alone rather than be accompanied by me – or anyone else, for that matter, though mostly me.” John separated his lips to interrupt but was not given a chance; Sherlock raised a finger in the air and briefly shook his head. “No, John, allow me to finish. I genuinely believe that the idea of me coming with you is causing you more stress and undue concern than if you were to visit your family by yourself. You’ve clearly spent most of the day worrying over this issue to such an extent that now you can think of nothing else, and I will allow you the acquiescence of saying that you’re probably right to have been so uncertain. I cannot simply turn off my gift for observation and you’re quite right when you assume that I will – no matter how hard I might try – form one judgement or another about both your family and the life in which you experienced before you came to university. What you’re concerned about, of course, is that the judgement that I’ll make is one that will be unavoidably insulting and that I will – as I tend to do – make that judgement perfectly clear to both you and your family.”
He looked away. "As much as I'd love to wear what I'm sure is a beautiful dress, I really don't think your friends would react kindly to me wearing something they've already seen. Maybe something in mauve?"
… well. That stretched it beyond all manner of comprehension. Naturally this lack of comprehension led John to find himself within a drinking establishment with no thought in his head other than the resounding memory of the words, endless words that had not been spoken and perhaps should have been; as he knocked back his third whiskey he discovered that lying underneath the disbelief was a steady flow of frustration, perhaps strong enough to be promoted to anger if he would let himself drink a fourth, and that the anger he was feeling would no doubt catapult into something far more explosive and life-altering should he continue to let it fester.
There was a gratifying moment of silence before Katie's voice piped up once more, sounding louder than before. "If you tell her whether she needs to give you her guitar or not she might stop, John."
Eyes flying open and a cold chill shuddering through his body, John twisted around and stared at his best friend in horror. "What? You… you answered it?!"
“Sherlock,” John said softly, watching as the hazy blue eyes slowly opened and found his, “why don’t you lie down?”
Suddenly John pulled away, almost violent in the speed and vehemence of it; his breathing was laboured, his cheeks flushed an endearing pink that Sherlock both appreciated and wanted to comment on, eyes opening and flickering up to meet Sherlock's before flitting over to the side of them, to the open door of the bathroom, then back again... it was all too fast for Sherlock to read, his only real knowledge being that John had ended the kiss and was most likely allowing himself to start thinking again, which if John's earlier comment had been accurate meant that John was about to start doubting everything and it would probably be better if Sherlock left
It was absolutely the right thing to say; Mrs. Holmes' face lit up with a giant beam. "Oh, you are sweet. He's lucky to have you too, John. Heavens knows where he'd be if he didn't have you."
And so, there you are, John. My little story. My fall. I have an addiction and it is not romantic nor interesting; it’s festering, continuous, an endless battle. There is not a day that goes by where I don’t think of it, want it – luckily my mind is advanced as such that I relish the challenge, distracting myself with such insanity as breaking into listed buildings and risking my life in the very dark, damp streets of London’s depths, mixing with criminals and making them both my allies and my foes – oh, John, it’s another type of addiction entirely. But it leads to the question: which would be preferable? The drug or the actions? The heroin or the adrenaline? I know which one you would probably pick – though reluctantly, as I’m sure any action that would risk my life you’d look down upon – and of course, that is the one which I choose more often than not. I distract myself well and I do not give into my temptation.
Doesn't really explain why you didn't bother responding to my email to let me know that you still wanted to do this, though...
"John, mate." He opened the door wide, stepping back to allow him the space to walk through. "Sherlock's sleeping, don't think he's really up for visitors -"
“How interesting,” Mycroft murmured to himself, eyes back to searching in the darkness behind John for his brother. “Well, as much as I appreciate your, ah,
This time when John awoke, still half-asleep and very close to being unconscious once more, he pulled his laptop towards him without needing the motivation of the usual 'bing' – this time he would talk first, speak the question that was flitting about at the edge of his barely-conscious mind still hazy from his dream.
"Fine, fine! I told him that it was obvious where this was going and that needed to realise what the fuck was going to happen and do something about it."
"Not sure that's a good idea," John admitted, the peculiar shyness in his voice escalating slightly as if he were confessing something he had been thinking but not allowing to be voiced in the darkness of the room, "I mean, y'know. Remember last time. The effect it had. Not sure I want your mum to accidentally walk in on me after I throw your violin across the room and tackle you to the bed."
"Yes, I'm... I'm here," John said with a slightly bigger smile than the one he'd offered Molly, trying as subtly as he could to slide out from underneath Mike's arm, "and it looks as if everyone is pretty much already sloshed. Did you save anything for me?"
"Anything I say now, you have to understand that it is not meant to offend you. If I have to make up for every word I'm about to speak I will indeed attempt to do so, but…" Sherlock's teeth found his lower lip momentarily, hesitation evident. "I said that I'd had access to a picture of you, and that I had looked at it often."
"You aren't wrong," John said with a polite laugh, watching with a somewhat apprehensive gaze as she fumbled with her door key; she eventually managed to get the door open, pushing the door wide and dragging John through into a beautiful kitchen, Aga stove and huge fridge-freezer amidst a myriad of country-style kitchen counters, the most amazing smells coming from the oven – John's mouth instantly began to water, his stomach growling all too loudly as it reminded him cruelly that he hadn't eaten more than a few handfuls of stale cornflakes in five days.
It was no surprise, really, that John had never even considered the possibility that his and Sherlock's friendship was something else entirely.
"I'm just going to keep asking unless you tell me. Or I'll talk more about you having sex with him. And being terrible at it. Are you hitting the g-spot? Because I think that's supposed to be amazing or something -"
Within seconds he had taken note of John's racing heart, his enlarged pupils and, yes, the increased body heat emanating from the man's body.
Greg dodged his way around Sherlock's parents and settled himself next to Mycroft (much to the older man's obvious exasperation), leaning on his arms as he peered at Sherlock and John over his sunglasses. "So. You two. Sorted?"
"You've never bloody had it," Greg intercepted as he passed John the spirit himself, grinning gleefully down at the curly-haired man, "so just give it a go, all right? You can barely taste it, you'll be fine."
There was a moment of silence; regardless of Harry's joking tone John was well aware of the sore subject. "Yeah. Yeah, of course. Sorry, Harry, should've realised that you -"
"No, no, I can do it," Sherlock said hastily, grabbing the jar and opening it. He put it down beside him and then reached for the mascarpone, almost cutting his hand on the knife that John was holding in the process. "Oh, no -"
"So that you could look at me with the horrified gaze you gave me earlier and stutter your rejection to my face? No thanks, I'd rather stick with denial." Sherlock barked out a humourless laugh. "Not that
Mycroft stared down at him, lip curling as he looked John up and down and acknowledged the fact that John had changed his clothes. "Mother would like to know whether you'd like white or red wine with dinner."
"Let's do this!" he agreed as enthusiastically as possible, raising the cup of now pale-green liquid in honour of his apparent 'getting wasted' mission and throwing the cup back against his lips and letting the citrus explosion burn its way down his throat. "I'm ready when you are."
Turning to look out of the window at the fields rushing by, he felt the now-familiar stab of apprehension at what he was headed towards. He knew, without a doubt, that he and Sherlock had made the right decision not to have his best friend accompany him to his parent's house but over the past few weeks he'd found himself far more comfortable in the company of the Holmes family than he had in the longest time; it helped that it had been a whirlwind, that much was true, but the fact that he had felt more at home at that cottage in Goring than he ever had done in his own hometown... well, now it just felt wrong to be so far from it, far from that growing 'normality'. Equally, of course, he missed university. He missed Well Place, he missed the domesticity of spending the evenings cooking or lazing about with takeaway, he missed waking up to a cup of tea on the coffee table next to him and Sherlock sitting in his armchair doing god knows what on his laptop.
John cleared this throat, deeply uncomfortable with the tension surrounding them – or perhaps just him. "You are aware that... it was
"Go home, John," Sherlock called back to him, not sounding in the least bit winded. His voice was emotionless. "We're finished here."
He left the room as quietly as he could, not wanting to wake up John – god knows what he and Sherlock had been up to. He wasn't a complete idiot, he knew that Sherlock did some seriously stupid shit whenever he left the house but he and Mycroft had both agreed that it was at least better than indulging in his heroin habit, so mostly Greg didn't bother asking about it; he couldn't deny though that now his curiosity had been raised. John was hurt – the bandage had given that away – and he had no doubt whatsoever that it was Sherlock's fault. Mycroft had thought so too. He knew that when Sherlock found out that he had sent a text to Mycroft to keep him updated with the situation that he'd be pissed off but that was essentially what Greg was here for; he was a spy. A well-kept spy.
John closed his eyes, trying to calm himself; he was overreacting – true, he was overreacting with a grin and it was in actual fact not a big deal at all, but
John had a feeling of where this was going and he felt his own frustration rise in response. "Don't even bother suggesting it, Sherlock, it's not going to happen."
John was starting to feel his irritation rise again. "Still not being specific enough, Greg, because I have no idea what you and Mycroft talked about."
Greg frowned, irritated. "That's a low blow, all right? He can keep his grubby mitts to himself unless he wants a black eye tomorrow -"
"Well excuuuuuse me for thinking my little brother might come to me for help. And if you're not in trouble and you don't know why you've called me, can I hang up now? Katie's got her hands busy and I rather want to join her."
“No,” Sherlock murmured back, shaking his head languidly back and forth. “No, I... shouldn’t sleep. I’ll have to be ready for when Mycroft gets here.”
"We have him here every year that we can," Brooke confided quietly to John, as if Wanda, Tim and Mycroft couldn't hear a word she was saying. "The first time I heard him, when he was a mere six years old, I was blown away. I insisted Wanda bring him along to the next ball and let him have a taste of infamy."
"From what Sherlock has said to me it sounds as if you were rather particular in your phrasing upon your confrontation in Greenwich Park; there was no mention of considering alternatives to your, ah,
"Oh, goodie, absolutely - let's talk about my heroin addiction," Sherlock interrupted sarcastically, rolling his eyes and leaning back in his chair. "Remember when I overdosed and had to be hospitalised? Or how about when I failed all of my exams at Brookling Manor? Oho, isn't it fun to take trips down memory lane? That coma, that was a real bunch of laughs!"
His patience slipped away like silk. "For crying out loud, why is it so important to you all that I decide on anything? What possible difference would it make if I do or don't?"
Anyway, I came back after a bout of nostalgia and re-read all of the reviews. Every single one. I remember the chat sleepovers with all of you, the Tumblr joys, getting to know you and genuinely finding an embarrassing amount of self-worth and happiness out of it all of it, and it got me thinking... well, it got me thinking that I miss that. A fuck ton. A big ol' steaming pile of fuck ton.
"I just... I got carried away and if I'd... if it had carried on..." John seemed to be having trouble finding the words as he tried to sit up properly, and Sherlock certainly didn't know how to help him when he was having difficulties with his own thought processes in the haze of the moment. "I don't want to do anything that might... y'know..."
"I had a guy in love with me about a year back," Katie piped up, her voice getting a little louder as she apparently leaned in closer. "He was really nice, actually, a really sweet guy but... well, you know, I like girls. Obviously. So I had to gently tell him to stop sending me flowers and move on."
"It's cool, no worries. Old wounds, unimportant in the grand scheme of things." She sounded as if she meant it. "You deserve to be happy for a bit, before they start shitting all over your parade."
"Yes," John said dully into the phone, his eyes still focused on the figure that was growing smaller and smaller in the distance, "but he's gone. Greenwich Observatory. He has drugs."
"Yeah, well, Sherlock's usually right." Greg was still staring at him with that 'look' on his face, not dissimilar from the one that Sherlock tended to use when he was wondering how John could be quite so ridiculously slow. "You're actually telling me – no, I'm really asking, don't look at me like that – you're telling me that you have no idea what all of this is about?"
, with your fingers in my hair and touching my throat." He suddenly found his mouth was quite dry, a tongue darting out to moisten his lips. "Your… tongue…"
Now it was Mycroft's turn to shoot his brother an exasperated glare. “Don't be absurd, even if it is your natural disposition.” He ruffled the pages of his newspaper once more. “That's only on a Wednesday.”
John could not help but sneak a glance at the boy sitting beside him; he found himself mildly surprised as he saw the beginnings of a flush dotting Sherlock's arched cheekbones. "It was a last minute decision made for no reason other than my own changeable tastes."
Taking the little leather book from the waiter and flipping it open to check the bill, John pulled out his wallet and took out a ten pound note. "It's quarter to eight, the observatory's closed now. You owe twenty," he added, putting the bill down with his ten pounds underneath it. "The wine and your untouched meal, you know."
“Yeah, extra support, sounds like a good idea – look, I really have to go but thanks Joanne, thanks again, and sorry, sorry...”
John pushed himself with his palms so that he was half-sitting, leaning against the headboard and quickly becoming distinctly aware of the bare half-torso poking out from underneath the duvet. "Mm, no. Well, a bit. It's fine."
John turned, walking over to the edge of the bed where Sherlock still half-lay with his eyes closed, looking down at his friend and waiting for his presence to be acknowledged; slowly Sherlock allowed his eyes to open once more, though he did not raise his gaze to meet John’s and simply stared at Mycroft’s trouser-leg. Hesitating, every former instinct he had ever felt to hold back being pushed aside for this single moment of absolute importance, John moved his hand until it rested gently on Sherlock’s shoulder and then turned back once more to face Mycroft.
“Indeed,” Mycroft agreed, plucking a non-existent loose thread from his trousers, “but it still remains true that you've spoken to me about such matters before and, apparently, chose me above others. You had your reasons then, so I ask; can you not find them again? If it would... benefit you?”
him, not like that, though he was devastatingly aware of his fingertips against John's hot skin and knew that he liked it, knew that it was a good feeling and one that he wanted all to himself...
He'd been warned, of course; Sherlock had made sure right at the beginning that John knew how it might be, that he could disappear for days and not contact him, but an entire
Sherlock allowed a smile. John forced himself to continue, still relatively sure that Sherlock was feeling like a twat.
Sherlock's throat was tight. "Isn't this session supposed to be merely introductory? We've been here some time."
Jim laughed. "It's not my personal e-mail address, John, it's all above board. We all have ways of working with the people who come to see us – my associates would tell you much the same thing – and some work better with different people. You obviously struggle with face-to-face contact and, even if your reasons for cutting this and the other sessions short are genuine, this is just an easier way for you to communicate with me. Smaller chunks, more often. Without having to tell me to my face." He leaned back in his chair. "Plus, y'know, we all have smartphones nowadays. Wherever you're heading, I'm sure it wouldn't take too much effort to type out a little e-mail every night."
Mycroft's eyebrow raised ever so slightly, subtle enough that his expression remained the same but impossible for Sherlock to miss. “Just like the last time, then?”
Harry was the one to speak, midway through a mouthful of peas. “He's not talking about you, Dad. For once.”
The door creaked open a fraction, the briefest moment of hesitation before it opened further and Sherlock could just make out the shape of a figure in the darkness – there were no details, no real identifier other than the lit-up screen of a phone and an outline that Sherlock would have probably recognised anywhere. Instinctively his free fingers wrapped around the edge of the duvet cover, pulling it up and over his chin as he watched John read his text before the young man let the arm holding his phone fall to his side as he took one more step into the room.
The ghost of a smile flitted across Sherlock's blatantly amused face. "You have quite the talent for avoiding what's directly in front of you, John."
"As I said." The edge of warning in Sherlock's voice was startling. "I'll take care of him from here."
A look of interest flickered over Sherlock's impassive face. "So... I drink my drink for as long as I like... and you all have to drink until I stop? What if someone stops before I do?"
The tiny, dangerous grin flickered to life once more as Sherlock glanced away and to the cards in front of them, calm, serene even. When he spoke, it was in his normal voice once more, loud enough for everyone else to hear.
The man reached out and took the small suitcase from John's right hand, walking towards the back of the car and pulling a door open for him. "If you'd like to get comfortable, sir, I'll put this in the boot for you."
. Thoughts like that weren't acceptable. He didn't know what was going through Sherlock's mind as he unbuttoned the rest of them in silence but he was pretty damned sure the young man probably wasn't nearly as aware of the weirdness as he was, and that in itself should have been enough to cease his brain from its irritating taunts. As the last button fell from its hole and the shirt sat half-open on his chest, John allowed himself a slow breath out and forced his eyes to open.
crossing across his younger brother's expression, Sherlock considered this proposal. “I suppose I have to ask again: if I do, will you please put me out of my misery and scuttle back off to your office?”
The interior of the house was, without a doubt, the most breathtaking setting he had ever laid eyes on – in pictures, in real life, even in the entire breadth of his imagination he had never been so completely overwhelmed with the richness and illustriousness of his surroundings quite like he was at that moment. He had walked awkwardly behind Wanda, Tim and Mycroft through an entrance hall unlike anything he had ever seen before, crystalline marble floors and delicate crystal chandeliers, a decadent double staircase covered in a deep red carpet that looked so thick that John felt relatively confident that if he were to jump on it he'd probably bounce back up by at
Sherlock could hear the smile lilting at the edges of John's voice; he fought the warmth that threatened to spread through his stomach and tried to hold on to the irritation, determined not to be bested. "Yes. You're extremely irritating."
and face what he should have predicted would be here all along, what he should have realised from their earlier conversation... eventually he was facing the right direction, eyes dragging themselves from their spot on the floor until he finally, painstakingly pulled his gaze up to the face of William Holmes.
I'm not a troll, John. I am exactly the person you thought I was last night – an arsehole, as you so delicately put it. I'm not going to tiptoe and pretend to be kind or supportive or even remotely interested in who you are as a person; all I have said to you are the clear, cold facts. I offered to help you academically and the offer still stands, though whether you are at a point where you are ready to attempt such a feat is unknown to me.
"I value you for your opinions, your outlook and your constant, ceaseless perseverance regardless of the odds stacked against you. I value your honesty, your generosity and your odd acceptance of me even at the very lowest point for us both when you could have quite easily walked away without a second thought or glance. I value your continued communication, your silences, your patience – even when I am being utterly incorrigible and unmanageable you somehow still manage to stay intent on being my friend regardless of my moods and my irrational behaviour. You don't judge me when you have every right to. I am a coarse, rude, ignorant and obnoxious yet you take it utterly in your stride and somehow, beyond any level of my own incredible comprehension, find it within yourself to look me in the eye and label me… extraordinary."
“You're only human, Sherlock, and a teenage one at that, much as you tend to tell yourself that you're above all of that hormonal nonsense. Regardless of your good intentions, you can only ask so much of yourself before you're simply in denial.”
John nodded, settling back down on the chair. "No problem. Just make sure you don't drink it too fast, all right? If it
“Well you were wrong,” Sherlock hissed, jaw starting to ache from tension, “weren’t you? He’s stubborn, beyond manipulation. You should have seen that, you should have known, then you could have…” He broke off, not knowing how to finish that sentence and realising too late that he had just proved his brother irrevocably right as to the mass of confusion spreading like a cancer through his brain. He swallowed thickly, his eyes closing. “I am beyond comprehension.”
Sherlock let a small smile slip onto his lips. “Mm. You needn’t worry about getting your privacy. I’m still likely to have days when I barely say a word.”
John stared at him, a flawed desperation making its way through his veins and fuelling him. "Please, Sherlock, just sit down so that Greg and I -"
"That you would choose to have sex with someone who doesn't mean anything to you. You don't strike me as the type to indulge in one-night affairs with strange women."
"That alleyway," Lewis said with a shake of his head, stepping back from John and motioning for Sherlock to move forward, "it's fucking dangerous, it is."
Sighing inwardly, John felt his fingers shift to rake his hair, hating every second of this conversation with a dull passion. "Mike... I'm just so
Sherlock grunted low in his throat, his eyes watching the dancing flames with mild disinterest. “So you were expecting me, then.”
you're dramatic. You just don't yet grasp the gravity of the effect my name can have within the underbelly of London."
The two of them looked up at one another, smiles slowly fading as the breeze swept around them and they both became quite aware of their renewed proximity.
It was perfect, perfection, the large hands reaching up to drag his face back to Sherlock's now utterly unyielding kiss as his own fingers mercilessly prised the gaping belt from its prison and half-pulled it from its holdings; he let it clatter against the door, not caring even a little that the noises might find their way downstairs to Mrs. Hudson, pulling at Sherlock's lower lip with his teeth whilst his hands gave up trying to undo the zipper and instead shifted down to cup the overwhelming heat and hardness of Sherlock's arousal, grinding his own erection against the shape of it and letting a primal groan slip into the limited space between them as he did it again, again, his tongue winding its way into Sherlock's suddenly parted lips and tasting the scintillating combination of tea, knowledge and regret for not having done this sooner. He wrapped his fingers around Sherlock and brushed his thumb over a spot that left the man rolling out a low keen, the lips that were surely now bruised from their passion forming his name beneath their ruthless kisses and the tell-tale arch of a spine as Sherlock moved himself to meet John's unrelenting fingers touching, stroking, pulling them both into a spiral they'd been gravitating towards for far too long –
Well, that was that. He'd truly hammered the nail in his sanity coffin with that one. He waited, huddled in his too-large hoodie, for a response.
from John as their bodies crashed together in the most unromantic and clumsy way possible; when Sherlock had managed to bring his head up to look at John again he saw that the man was staring up at him as if he couldn't quite believe his eyes... it could have been an intense moment, perhaps it should have been, but without a moment's pause the two of them were suddenly laughing and the hand that was still behind Sherlock's neck was shifting so that John's thumb could brush against the side of John's face in the fondest gesture Sherlock could have imagined and then they
Sherlock dipped his hand into his pocket, pulling out something wrapped snug within the many folds of tin foil, holding it up in the rapidly disappearing light; he did not need to explain. John knew without a doubt what was within that little lump.
