Sherlock raised one eyebrow as he sat down and began pulling on the brand new, incredibly polished shoes he had found on his bedside table that morning. ‘He’s such a bullshitter,’ he said to Irene, trying hard to sound like he was telling the truth. ‘Why would I be jealous-‘
were the best.’
Sherlock stretched, gently pushed John away in case whoever it was came in, and shouted, ‘what?’
John was the one that broke away, staring up at Sherlock, and then he kissed him, pulling the taller man down to meet his lips, gentle and soft.
John grinned, drinking in the sight of the boy. He was maybe six foot tall, about a year younger than John, pale, big hands, a shocking amount of black curls and intense, blue(ish) eyes that seemed to see right into John’s soul.
‘LONG LIVE THE KING!’ The crowd shouted in unison, and then Sherlock turned to the girl and whispered something in her ear, and as the camera zoomed in John could
The whole of the world seemed to shrink until it was literally just Sherlock, all over his senses, the only thing that mattered on the whole of the planet.
‘We’re good friends, aren't we, Sherlock?’
Jenny’s mouth had fallen back open. ‘What do you want to be when you’re older- oh.’
That scene on the roof was playing through his mind; Sherlock was going to jump, Sherlock wasn’t listening to John, and then when he had been persuaded to step away Moriarty shot himself and Sherlock just stared. What if there had been snipers? What if it had been a trick? What if-
‘Are you even listening?’ John teased, and Sherlock just smiled wider and nodded. ‘Of course. I always listen to you.’
Sherlock laughed. ‘Another one of the royal ten commandments. Number three;
‘Are you going to name your son Bradley?’ Morag said sarcastically. ‘Kane? Tyler?’
The next few minutes were a blur; the moment Sherlock was on the landing he collapsed and refused to get up. John ran, screaming for Mycroft, ignoring the staff as he tripped around the palace, cursing how big it was for what must have been the millionth time, and eventually he found Mycroft and he couldn’t even hear what he was saying, just burbling random words about dead bodies, shootings, the roof and James Moriarty.
John’s smile widened. ‘You seemed smaller.’ His fingers reached up to Sherlock’s tie, settling on the knot at his throat. ‘And I meant what I said.’ He yanked the tie, pulling Sherlock down with it, and kissed him once, gently, on the lips as he whipped it off. ‘You look better without a tie.’
‘I’m not.’ Sherlock interrupted, glaring at John. ‘Why would I be? Just a mistake, forgot to let go, didn’t mean too, we shan’t discuss it again, nothing to worry about, my fault completely-‘
‘Answer,’ Sherlock grinned.
‘That was amazing.’
Sherlock grinned and stepped out of the limo, putting all thoughts of Mycroft behind him. He was feeling nervous, certainly, and apprehensive, but mostly excited. He was at the Prom and in there John Watson would be waiting for him.
‘Mem- Sherlock, you’re impossible. Come. Now.’
The waiter stuck out his chest, clearly proud, though still looking at Sherlock a bit suspiciously. ‘Ta,’ he smiled. ‘Do you know him?’
and Sherlock was almost crying, bucking into the older man’s hand, gasping as he chased what he expected to be the most powerful orgasm of his life-
enough?’ Sherlock had been saying since John had come back, almost four weeks ago, that he was different. He wouldn't engage in activities viewed as
’ Sherlock didn't know what else to say, didn't know what else he could say, but he meant it with every single atom in his body. ‘
William (
Suddenly, Sherlock’s whole world stopped. Mike Stamford’s words were lost; the slight breeze didn’t touch his skin; and everything,
run off.
He just nodded, stood up and took off his shirt.
‘You’re everything to me, John, and I’m doing this for you, you must understand that. You can’t die, you’re far too good, valuable, kind, courageous.’
Jim Moriarty is going to fucking screw you over,
As Sherlock’s head shot up, Irene let out a short but genuine laugh. ‘Truly,’ she said to the bemused waiter, ‘Your timing could
‘And gay,’ Molly said. ‘I swear, none of our pairings are
Smiling like a madman, John followed him.
And suddenly John is kissing him, kissing him like he’s never been kissed before. It’s a promise, a commitment and a smile all in a kiss, and Sherlock knows right then that John Watson is his forever, his eternity, his land after five hundred years at sea. ‘John-‘
Sherlock cleared his throat. ‘Good day, John's family. A pleasure, I'm sure.’
It’s too soon after Mary. John is too broken. Sherlock is too broken. It’s not the right moment.
Someone grabbed his arm and pulled him through a door he hadn’t even seen.
who needs Sherlock, now: even with three children he adores and a loving wife Sherlock is all that matters.
People were openly crying now, and John had tears streaming down his face. Sherlock, heart aching with love, smiled at him, as John let out a choking laugh, before standing up and throwing his arms around Sherlock and kissing him, hard, on the lips. ‘I love you,’ he whispered, and Sherlock winked down at him. ‘Can’t blame you. I’m irresistible.’
‘I do.’ Sherlock grinned. ‘Come on! I swear, I won’t bite. And neither will the corgis. They’re kept downstairs, mostly.’ By now, Sherlock was at the door, gesturing outside. ‘Are you coming, or not?’
Sherlock smiled and struck a stupid pose, eyes twinkling. ‘I know, I’m fabulous.’
Sherlock took a deep breath. ‘That’s my phone number.’ He looked at John under those thick eyelashes, looking more worried than John had ever seen him look, and said quietly, ‘You’re my best friend, John, and I don't want to go another year without talking to you.’
John makes a noise in the back of his throat, and they’ve collided.
But now every part of John is broken, and Sherlock can see it so clearly that it almost kills him to look. So he doesn’t look- he stares straight ahead, at the chair that used to be John’s, and thinks about Culverton Smith and suffocation and, Christ help him, the drugs, the drugs that he went on because Mary told him to and the drugs that could have, would have, should have killed him. He thinks about James Moriarty, and Faith Smith, and the feeling of falling.  He thinks about the mess he’s made of everything, he thinks about a dead dog at the seaside, and he thinks about the light that he actually
Sherlock wouldn't do that. Sherlock had gotten enough of that before his father found out and he did not at all want that for Mycroft. John had been good for Sherlock in an incalculable number of ways but the thing that Sherlock was most amazed about was that his boyfriend had actually managed to convince him that Mycroft really and truly cared for him and would do anything to protect him. Two years before, Sherlock would have described Mycroft as his worst enemy: now, he would probably describe him as, if not his best friend, his closest confidant bar John.
‘Absurd?’ John cried. ‘He was in your room. How did he get in if he’s practically at the top of MI6’s hit list?’
The hard contours of Sherlock’s face seemed like a barrier, designed to make people think like Harriet did about him. It was like…
And that’s how Sherlock ended up, 119 days before the large social gathering involving dancing, secret drinking and everyone pretending to like each other held annually for the year 13’s at Sherwood Grammar School, baking cookies in Molly’s kitchen, with flour in his hair and an apron which read ‘I don't do work on days that end in day’.
Sherlock smiled at her. ‘I hear you like my- I mean, the royal family?’
Molly’s younger brother, a freckly boy with a huge smile and brown hair, yelled for her and she stepped away from John. ‘Have a good year,’ she said, and John stuck his hands in his pocket. ‘I’ll try.’
‘Please,’ Sherlock said before he could stop himself. ‘Please, James.’ John looked at him in surprise- he had probably never seen Sherlock do anything like begging, and here he was almost down on his hands and his knees- but Jim just shook his head and said, ‘too late.’ His smile widened and he said, slowly, relishing the words, ‘the third reason, Johnny boy, was because at the time I was
‘Someone’s been reading their Grimms Fairy tales again.’ Mycroft said, tutting. ‘You’re sixteen, Sherlock, not six.’
The anger leaked out of Sherlock as quickly as it had come. ‘Maybe.’
‘Just about,’ Sarah grouched. ‘Mike. This isn’t
‘To Baker Street,’ John agreed, and with a last look out the window, he was gone.
Jenny was blinking rapidly, sweating. ‘
The other soldier raised an eyebrow. ‘Are you upset because you’ve finally realised Sholto just wants to get into your pants?’ He stretched his arm and put his feet onto the metal rims of John's bunk. 'I do hope not, Johnny, it's been obvious for months.'
‘No!’ Sherlock shouted, grabbing the lapels of James’ jacket. ‘No!’
‘And Alicia,’ Sherlock continued, ‘told her youngest brother, Seamus, who’s in year seven, and now none of his year will touch me in case they get ‘weird gay creep disease’.’
He sat down on a bench in one of the cubicles, waiting. To his great relief, the water shortly stopped. Footsteps padded to the sink and then left the room. Sherlock groaned and stood up. He stripped off his t-shirt, wincing. His bandages were dark and dirty around the edges, so he took those off as well. He ran a hand over his ribs. A shot of pain flared through him. He removed his hand and figured he’d need to ask someone for replacement bandages.
“Please. For me.” Mycroft never said please, so Sherlock opened his eyes. Mycroft allowed a sliver of emotion to cross his normally cool demeanor. Pain. Sherlock saw raw pain. Guilt flared low in his stomach, an emotion he was becoming more and more used to feeling. An emotion he hated feeling.
“Love?” Sherlock shook his head to clear his mind. It only sort of worked.
“Yeah, okay.”
Sherlock hung up, turning to face himself in the mirror. His heart thrummed through his chest. As much as he told himself that it wasn’t a date, he couldn’t help but feel like it was one. At any rate, he needed to look his best.
“John,” Sherlock said, keeping his voice low. He moved closer to the bed. “John. Wake up. You’re having a nightmare.”
A heavy silence fell upon them. The room seemed frozen in time as John tried to keep himself together but couldn’t, clutching Mary’s lifeless body.
*****
Sherlock walked away, leaving John’s mind spinning. It clicked into place and despite John understanding it logically, he had no idea how to process this. Sherlock was in love with him.
“He claimed you attacked him,” the nurse said firmly.
“About Mary,” Sherlock agreed. The words felt thick and heavy coming through his mouth.
“Sherlock.”
Sherlock stood there, newspapers in one hand, the other clutching the table. “I’m high.”
“I love you.”
Not for any longer than that. “Why would she do that? The angle is too far away, even you could barely make that shot.” He scowled. “See, now she hit him. This is ridiculous. I don’t understand why you like this movie.”
“Are you insane? There are police directly below us.”
“Eurus. Making me choose. And I chose
Sherlock took off his scarf and coat. “No, I didn’t.”
“You can’t just-”
“We’re fine. He shot at both of us. I fired in self defense.”
Sherlock’s musings were interrupted by Angelo’s return, this time with two glasses of water and the dinner menu. “Here you go, boys,” he said, setting the drinks down.
“Why are you-” John screwed up his face in pain. “What are you doing here?”
The song sounded familiar, and John strained to figure out what it was. It was beautiful, notes weaving in and out of each other. The song began softly, the notes drawn out and smooth. It picked up pace a little, but still fairly smooth. The notes climbed high and fast, and Sherlock hit them with precise accuracy. Then the song became rough, the notes tumbling and falling over each other at a very fast pace, and John found himself tapping his finger along with the violin. At the very end, it became almost mournful. Sherlock’s expression was sombre, his eyes focused on the music.
He awoke with a jolt. He retched, but nothing came out.
Mycroft’s eyes swept over the flat as Lestrade walked over and picked up the list. The papers in disarray around Sherlock’s desk. The lack of John’s chair. The flasks, test tubes and beakers spread over the table near his microscope. Lestrade handed Mycroft the list. Mycroft read it, and then turned to Sherlock.
“Fine. Why did you call?”
He stayed in the bathroom for far too long, and when he came out, Sherlock was in his bedroom with the door shut. John didn’t even bother to go in.
“Not everyone is as brilliant as you, Sherlock.” John smiled at him. “No. I don’t want to break up. Yes, I want to stay your boyfriend.”
“I have a question.”
“John.”
Next chapter will be the last.
“Clever,” Sherlock said. “I can see how you would be fond of that.” Too late, he realised who he was. A children’s advertiser, yes, and the owner of a hospital. He was completely in control here. Sherlock was powerless. He knew Smith. He had been keeping tabs on him ever since he had first seen him. There was something off about him. Something not quite right. He blamed the cocaine for not realising it sooner, and cursed himself. He was off his game.
“Yes.”
“Now for you, Sherlock.”
Sherlock sat up. “If I don’t respond, it should be fairly obvious that I don’t want to talk to you.”
“Fine.” His body twitched violently again, and he wondered if he’d be able to survive the withdrawals. Maybe Wiggins could bring him something, just to take the edge off.
Kissed him.
“Why does this bother you so much?” John looked at him, clearly heartbroken. His eyebrows were furrowed, and Sherlock could tell he was trying to keep his voice from cracking.
Please read with caution.
“Sherlock.” John gazed at him. “Please believe me. It was a mistake to blame you. I’m sorry.”

“I need to go to Bart’s,” Sherlock choked out. “I think I may be bleeding internally.”
“Bloody hell.” Wiggins stared at him. “What happened to you?”
“What is?”
The next chapter might take longer as I haven't even started it yet, but we'll see.
Rosie plucked at the paper on Sherlock’s gift. John gently guided her fingers to the tape, saying nothing about the newspaper. She scrunched up the paper, ripping it slightly so that the yellow of the blanket showed through. John helped her unwrap it all the way. Sherlock watched anxiously. He was worried that it wasn’t good enough. Maybe Rosie already had enough blankets? It didn’t help that Sherlock couldn’t parse the expression on John’s face, either. He kept it stubbornly blank as the blanket was revealed.
and a few others. John and Rosie watched him silently. Rosie was enraptured by the instrument. John’s face was unreadable. He ended with
Once, before the fall, Sherlock had gotten injured during a case. It wasn’t bad, just a small wound in his shoulder that needed stitches, but John tended it immediately. His hands were gentle and steady, fixing him back up. That’s what John did. He fixed Sherlock, not broke him apart. Or, well, he used to. Now, Sherlock was just broken.
*****
“You’re early,” Sherlock said, and then his body gave a violent shake.
He sighed again and looked at John’s empty chair. So much had changed. It used to be the two of them. Then it was Mary with them. Sherlock hadn’t liked that. But then Mary died, leaving John to look after Rosie. John moved back into Baker Street with Rosie, and everything seemed to be better than before.
“Fine, fine,” Sherlock said, his voice burning from the vomit.
They had more physical contact than usual. John was usually the one who initiated it, but Sherlock sometimes found himself leaning against him while watching a movie or brushing his arm or hand when they were cooking. Sherlock broke down twice out of overwhelming emotion, and John was able to hug him properly until he felt better. All in all, it was very good for both of them.
“An order for Watson?” John held up his hand and moved forward to take it. Sherlock pressed his card into John’s hand. His fingertips were cold. So he was only imagining the trails of heat earlier, then. Interesting.
“Thank you,” he said, stiffly. “You did well. Officiating.”
John spooned some eggs onto Sherlock’s plate. He brought it over to him, relieving him of Rosie and dropping a hand on his shoulder in the meantime. Sherlock didn’t move a muscle. That was the first time John had willingly touched him since Mary’s death. His hand was warm through the thin fabric and Sherlock longed to stand up and press his entire body into John’s. All too soon, John removed his hand. Sherlock repressed a shiver.
“Take a moment, if you need to,” Sherlock said, his voice low. Taken aback by his thoughtfulness, John furrowed his brow.
“Nothing. We
“Don’t. Just don’t. Sherlock, okay? Just-” he cut himself off, panting. “Just go.”
Sherlock scanned the email. Below the signature was a phone number. He despised calling clients, but it didn’t seem too bad now. He dialed, waiting with baited breath. “Hello?” A woman’s voice crackled through the other end.
Everything sort of went back to normal after that, with the exception of Rosie. Having a child around was strange, but Sherlock found himself caring for Rosie. She was, after all, John’s child, and anything John-related was good. With the obvious exception of his girlfriends.
John didn’t cry. Good. That was good. Probably. Sherlock wasn’t actually sure. John had cried at his funeral, or so he had told Sherlock afterwards. And he almost did at the grave. Sherlock didn’t know what to make of that. He decided not to think about it. A few more speeches were made. Sherlock silently apologised to Mary.
“Yes,” Mycroft said. “Hence why we need to sit with him. Sherlock, for the next while, one of us will always be with you. To keep an eye on you.”
“Why?”
Sherlock groaned but couldn’t muster the energy to do anything else.
“I’ll make them,” Sherlock said, needing to do something. “Scrambled okay?” John nodded his assent and Sherlock pulled out a pan. Soon, the smell of cooking eggs mingled with the smell from the oven. “What will Rosie be eating?”
“It’s okay, John,” Sherlock said gently. “You’re distracted.”
Word count: 4,330
John flipped over. Sherlock mirrored him so that they were face-to-face. If it wasn’t dark in the room, Sherlock would have studied John carefully. He would memorise every detail of his face, of his hair, of his eyes, of
“Yes, fine.” He waved his hand dismissively.
Sherlock mouthed back. But he winked, actually winked, and for a second forgot Mycroft had been saying something. However, Mycroft was still talking, and while Sherlock didn’t usually feel the need to listen to anything Mycroft said, this time he found himself actually wanting to.
John closed his eyes as Sherlock wrapped himself back around him. He realised he was getting tired, but one more thing was plaguing his mind. He understood the consequences but decided to ask it anyway.
“Anyways, I’m not the one who should be upset. Your girlfriend broke up with you on Christmas Eve, as you so eloquently put it.”
he urged, needing John to listen. “I am angry at you for what you did to me. I am very hurt. It’s going to take me a while to forgive you, and I can’t do that quite yet. But it will happen. It will. I promise.”
Warning: mild violence.
Sherlock finally found Mary’s headstone. He collapsed to the ground in front of it as his legs gave out. Sweat rolled down his face, but he shivered. He rubbed his hands across his face. He was too far gone to feel guilt
“Please,” he pleaded. “He’ll take me away. You know he will.” His voice was rough from crying, his eyes red and swollen. Mrs. Hudson stared at him for a long moment.
“No one’s ever been jealous because of me before,” Sherlock said softly.
When he leaned back, Mary’s eyes were open, glassy and still.
Molly answered the door holding a sleeping Rosie in her arms. Sherlock noticed that Rosie was bundled in the yellow dog blanket. He smiled faintly at Molly. “Sorry about that.”
“No.”
Sherlock sighed. “Just water, then.”

The office was painted a turquoise colour. There was a stained-glass window at the bottom of the wall opposite the door. The side walls were cut in a way that the rooms next door were visible only through slits at the bottom. Sherlock figured that the blue was supposed to be aesthetically pleasing, but it’s resemblance to the light in the aquarium set his teeth on edge. The window was nice enough, the floor slits weird. The chairs were brown leather and not nearly as nice as his own chair back in his flat.
“Sherlock.”
“I do,” John said, his heart straining to leap out of his chest. “I meant in your…”
“Look, can’t you just go to a clinic or something? I’m really quite busy,” John said, verbally slicing Sherlock to pieces.
Damilola Taylor was a ten-year-old boy. Two brothers were convicted of his murder (ages 12 and 13). He bled to death. Before his death, it was said that he was being bullied and called gay. I picked this one specifically because he was only ten years old. He died 27 November 2000.
“This is brilliant!” Sherlock told Olivia when he was back in the sitting room. “Absolutely brilliant. Just what I needed.” He grinned broadly.
“Explain it to me.” Her eyes were stern, reminding him of his parents. He felt five again, being asked why he brought bees into the house or why he stole the raw meat they were using for dinner.
“Good, good,” John said, peering around her. Rosie was sitting on the floor looking very happy. “Sorry about the extra night.”
John took Rosie from her. “Thank you again.”
Abandoning that plan, Sherlock reached under his bed. He hadn’t bought a gift for John. He wasn’t certain if that would be overstepping, and in any sense, he certainly didn’t know what John wanted. But he had picked up something for Rosie while John was looking for ornaments. He’d slipped it in the cart when John wasn’t looking. He pulled it out now and looked at it.
“It’s not okay.” He closed his eyes. He could still see John, falling backwards. Still heard the shot, ringing in his ears.
“I’ll have the same,” John said. Angelo winked from behind John. Sherlock scowled at him.
“No, it wasn’t,” Sherlock agreed. “I thought with the party it might be. But surprisingly, it’s actually turned out quite well.”
“Shortly before my fifteenth birthday, Harry brought a girl home. It was probably her way of showing us that she was better than us and braver than us. I would have told her not to, not that day. It was late in the evening. Dad had had a particularly bad day at work, and his drinking started earlier than usual. He was angry about Mum, he was angry about Harry. In retrospect, I should have told her not to say anything the second she walked in the door. But I didn’t. Harry introduced the girl as her girlfriend. Dad said some horrible things. I can still see him saying them. The anger on his face was the worst thing I’ve ever seen.” John closed his eyes. His face was pulled taut with pain. Sherlock listened, helpless against John’s emotion. “He told her she had to leave the house. He didn’t want her here anymore. Not while she was gay. Her girlfriend protested. Harry protested. I was standing in the corner of the room, not saying anything. I don’t know if she saw me or not. Dad held firm and kicked her out.” John’s voice trembled. “She didn’t send me a birthday card that year. While it may not seem like much, it felt like a lot. I knew she hated Dad, but it really felt like she hated me as well.
“May I see her room?”
“Not yet, at least,” John said quietly. Hope stirred in Sherlock’s chest. He didn’t respond for fear of scaring John off. That was the last thing either of them said until just before John left.
There was a warm weight against his chest when he woke up the next morning. He felt constricted and nearly panicked before remembering the events of last night. And then he did panic, just for a second. What if John regretted it? What if John thought it was awkward? Sherlock certainly didn’t regret it. He was warm and content now. John was still asleep. His head was resting on Sherlock’s shoulder, his arm loosely flung around his stomach.
He gently replaced the music in the envelope and set the envelope on the stand. John looked at Sherlock sleeping one last time and wondered if he’d ever see him that peaceful again. Then he went up to bed, his mind blurring and feeling very guilty. It was probable that Sherlock hadn’t wanted him to see that. It was also probable that Sherlock didn’t really want John to know about any of his feelings. John felt like he was intruding on something private, something he wasn’t supposed to know about. Suddenly exhausted, he collapsed into bed and fell asleep almost immediately.
“Ever since I said I was in love with you,” he said dully. “I’ll take it back, if that is what you would like. We can pretend it never happened. I’ve hid it for years, no reason why I can’t now.”
“Nothing’s going on between us,” Sherlock said, dully. “Remember? He hates me.” It had become a sort of mantra. He seemed to be permanently stuck in limbo between
In answer, Sherlock picked up his violin. He placed sheet music on his stand and John leaned back into his chair. Violin playing meant that Sherlock was trying to get back into a semblance of normalcy.
“Oh,” John breathed.
He returned his focus back to the front of the room. Someone was speaking. Molly, he thought it was. He listened for a moment. Yes, it was Molly. She was saying something about how Mary was a good friend and mother.
“Sherlock. It’s obvious,” she said gently. “It’s nothing to be ashamed of.”
“I’m sorry. I think I have to. I mean, I still rent out the flat and right now, I’m far from my work. I also don’t want to impose on you any more than I have.” You’re not an imposition, Sherlock wanted to yell at him, but his voice remained stubbornly silent. John allowed the silence for a few minutes before starting to speak again. “Tomorrow would be best, probably, since it’s a Sunday and I have work on Monday.”
“No.” He glared at John. “I haven’t.”
She gripped his dressing gown and gazed up at him with wide eyes. She wasn’t crying. That was something, Sherlock supposed. It wouldn’t be good if John came back to his daughter crying in Sherlock’s arms. “I got you a present,” Sherlock continued. “To be honest, I don’t know what to get for babies. And now I’m talking to you. Great. You can’t even respond.” The tone of his voice was fond. Rosie beamed up at him. Sherlock decided right then that he liked Rosie. He hoped that John would bring her over more often.
A strange emotion rushed over him. He had to fight to keep his body still, his breathing calm and even. He was about to cry. “Please, leave.” If John didn’t leave, he was going to fall apart and that was the last thing either of them needed.
“So you do style it?”
John started to respond but cut himself off with another yawn. “Sorry,” he said afterwards.
“And then what?” John was looking up at him.
“Yes?” He was so, so close. John dipped his head a little closer and Sherlock stopped breathing. Then-
“Fine,” Mycroft said. “We are gathered here today to witness and celebrate the union of William Sherlock Scott Holmes and John Hamish Watson in marriage.” John smirked at him.
“I used to have it when I was younger,” John said, flushing slightly. “Harry and I would look forward to it every year.”
“Not at all.” Sherlock smiled at him. “And don’t even protest that you’re not doing enough. You’re a single father and you just told me something very important. Stay here.” Sherlock carried Rosie upstairs. He quickly changed her and got her completely ready before setting her down on John’s bed. From the cupboard he took out the sheets she’d used at Christmas and made up her cot. He settled her inside it, tucking the yellow blanket around her. She snuggled in and was asleep almost instantly. He sighed, relieved. If she’d started crying, he hadn’t the faintest idea what he was supposed to do.
Sherlock decided to archive the entire interaction in his Mind Palace. He spent an extra long time on the feeling of being held. He hadn’t been held in a long time. He decided he quite liked the feeling, like he always did when John hugged him.
“I know that you must miss him terribly-”
“Would you like it?”
“Because I was worried.”
But he couldn’t tell John that, could he? He settled for saying, “Who knows?”
“Is this okay?” John asked.
“That would be lovely.” He flashed her another smile and then turned to the fireplace. She didn’t say anything else as she went back downstairs, but later came up with a cup of tea, setting it beside him without a word.
“Do? Do about what?”
His eyes flew open and he met the man head on. He was yelling, but his ears were filled with blood roaring and what did it matter what was shouted? Using the man’s momentum, he flipped him over and pinned him down, one hand on his chest, the other raised above his face.
my latest conquest?’
‘Oi,’ Irene growled. ‘I’m not a slag. Dominatrix.’
Mycroft looked between him and John and smiled, tight-lipped. ‘I hear you perfectly, Sherlock. Have a pleasant evening. Nice to see you again, John.’
,’ Sherlock said, ‘but I also like
Mycroft had refused to let Sherlock say that he was being knighted for ‘services to the royal family, in particular fucking the King’s older brother.’
Sherlock was the one who pulled away, pressing their foreheads together and saying softly, ‘I should make Mycroft set up a parade for every day.’
Jenny was still crying and Harry, usually so dismissive of her mother's feelings, put her arm awkwardly around her. 'I know,' she whispered, and John knew that she
John was his sun. How could Sherlock be expected to live without his sun?
For a long while, John and Sherlock stared at each other from the opposite chairs and John realised something about Sherlock. He was unique, he was intelligent, he was…special, and all his life people had put him down for it. Now, he expected to be rejected, he expected to be made fun of, and he wouldn’t let himself close to anyone because he couldn’t stand to have that happen.
Sherlock had been willing to give up everything for him. And now everything was going to be different.
They had each other, and that was all they needed: two boys, kissing in the sun, reunited forever.
That would be the sensible thing to do, but Sherlock Holmes is anything but sensible.
John lays a comforting hand on his daughter’s arm, but Nathaniel has already stepped forward, clutching his gift in his hands. ‘Good morning, Daddy,’ he says formally. ‘It’s the first time I’ve ever come to see you and it’s very exciting. My name’s Nathaniel, and I’m your son, but you probably knew that because Papa says you loved me lots even though I wasn't born yet. Everyone says we’re very alike, so you must have been very cool.’ Despite himself John snorts, and Nathaniel looks up in disgust. ‘Please, Papa, don’t.’ He turns back to the grave and whispers, ‘he’s impossible. I bet if you weren't dead me and you would’ve made his life horrible, right?’ He pauses and John’s stomach twists because as grown-up as Nathaniel pretends he is, he still believes that his Daddy might answer him.
John smiled: he’d always loved a challenge. ‘Then let’s play a game.’
At this point John cleared his throat loudly, and said loudly, ‘Sherlock. I came to pay off my debt.’ He placed the money in Sherlock’s hand and smiled awkwardly.
‘And their children,’ Sherlock paused again, ‘Princess Talia Grace and Prince Alexander Jonathan.’
‘Another stupid idea, Lestrade,’ Sherlock replied, not turning around. ‘Just what I expected from you.’ The note idea, however, had been quite good, and Sherlock made a mental note to add it to his list when he got home. He was fast running out of time and it seemed like the best option out of a bad lot.
‘You know very well that will never happen.’ Sherlock said, looking at his fingernails. ‘Thanks, Mike.’
John ignored him and kissed Sherlock gently, smiling at his husband (John still couldn't get over that). ‘I’ll come up about two, yeah?’
John’s feet moved him towards Sherlock, even as his brain protested that this was a terrible idea, he couldn’t be friends with a Prince, especially not this Prince, this renowned Prince…
‘What?’ John didn’t know whether to believe her.
Walking away from his father, hearing his shouts, and suddenly tears were running down John’s face. Through the blur, Harry was approaching, but he ignored her, rushing past as he cried. There was only one person he wanted to see at that moment, and he ran, ran as fast as he could, trying to get to him.
‘He said,’ Greg paused, clearly thinking, ‘he said that his mother killed herself.’
Mrs Hudson appeared on the stairs, holding John’s disgruntled daughter in her arms. ‘Sherlock, I must insist that-‘
Sherlock laughed. ‘A flat? I never thought of it like that. I always called it my quarters, but I like flat better. Welcome to 221B, John.’
Trisha laughed. ‘It truly is the foulest name I’ve ever heard.’ she joked, looking at John. ‘I was all up for just calling him Archie George, but Morag,’ her lip curled, which John noted in surprise; Sherlock wasn’t the only one who hated the King’s advisor, ‘wouldn’t allow it. George Francis Archibald. That’s-‘
John’s smile widened. ‘I should think so.’
‘Why should I?’ John took a tiny step backwards. ‘You’re a liar.’
. Sherlock didn’t know how long they talked, only that when he finally turned away from Hamish to glance at the hall the tables were gone, and everyone was dancing.
I’m hopeful, and happy, and I think everything’s going to be ok, when it’s summer.’
‘I forgive you.’ He tilted his head as Sherlock visibly sagged with relief. ‘Am I the first person you’ve told that entire story to?’
Sherlock and his mother nodded. ‘Obviously,’ Sherlock muttered, hiccupping once. ‘It seems Myc’s soulmate’s been kissing around again, or he’s been whispering things to him.’ He couldn’t imagine what that was like, knowing the person you are destined to be with liked someone else, and he supposes it partially explains Mycroft’s constant anger. His voice was nice, when it piped up. It didn’t kiss other people.
John has never wanted anything more in his life.
John huffed- the boy
‘Isaac should go alone,’ Becca argued. ‘You’re a medic, you might need protecting.’ John rolled his eyes at the jibe but nodded. ‘Fine. I’ll go with Becca on the South; Isaac, you ok with East?’
Sherlock knew he needed to stop. If he didn’t, John would end their friendship immediately. He wasn’t gay, as he constantly reminded Sherlock, and there was no point in Sherlock trying to invent a sexuality for John that he did not identify with. It was miracle John hadn’t run yet, and if there was one thing Sherlock Holmes was certain of, it was that if John Watson were to leave him he didn’t know if he would be able to live anymore.
Irene shrugged. ‘Well, it’s true. You’re both weird, gay, creepy-‘
It had never happened before: Sherlock could deduce everyone.
something that makes you stand out.’
last week and it was very disconcerting.’
Hunter, who had the bunk above him, plopped down on John's bed and grinned. ‘Hey, Johnny.’
‘Pleased to meet you, your majesty.’ John bowed. Charlotte laughed. ‘None of that, child. Call me Charlotte, please. So…you’re my Sherlock’s boyfriend?’
John had only met Sherlock’s immediate family, his grandmother and Victor Trevor, who was his second cousin or something. Victor was there, hiding at the back of the room with a sombre expression on his face, but the others…
he says in his head, but James will surely stop him. ‘Good,’ he hears himself say. ‘Be swift.’
John had almost gotten used to Sherlock’s rapid deductions (‘I do not see,’ he had said when the conversation took a minute turn into Sherlock, ‘I observe.’) but not quite- he failed to hide the surprise on his face. ‘Woah.’
‘Oh my god, Sherlock.’ John was out of his chair before he could even realise what was going on, kneeling next to Sherlock in seconds. ‘I’m so, so sorry.’
‘How dare you say that!’ Jenny screamed. ‘Treason, Harriet! That’s treason-‘
John pulled back and opened his eyes, scanning Sherlock’s face. Sherlock’s brain was short-circuiting. All he could think of was John.
‘He’ll choose a pussy dare,’ Janine interrupted. ‘John, have you watched Orange is the New Black?’
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. ‘You gave me your sporting jacket?’ He wasn’t a fan of modern literature, or modern filmmaking, but he and Trisha had once watched a film in which the head of the American football team gave his girlfriend his jacket to show his love-
‘But I thought you liked John!’ Sherlock had whined, glaring at his brother. ‘Remember? The Ritz? ‘I believe that John Watson is good for you’? Mycroft, please!’
Here we have Sherlock and John meeting for the first time! Remember to comment and leave kudos for faster updates :)
‘So this is it.’
‘You’re gay?’ John said.
Mike shoved the other boy good-naturedly and added sodium to the decomposing liver. He and Sherlock had been friends since they were in nappies (their fathers knew each other) and Sherlock honestly liked Mike, though he could see why Jim and Irene found their friendship so odd. The older boy was exactly what Sherlock seemed to hate; a large, nice, normal boy who, despite his aristocratic heritage spoke in a soft London accent and preferred to go by his mother’s surname of Stamford. But Sherlock found him refreshing and far more intelligent than most people thought he was, and Mike liked Sherlock’s straight-to-the-point nature and intolerance to pretending to be nice. The two worked well together.
people. ‘And let’s be who we’re meant to be.’
‘I know,’ Sherlock says, and he’s shocked by how little the rejection has upset him. ‘I know that.’
And then they were kissing, lips fitting perfectly, though Sherlock had no idea how that was possible, his hands on Hamish’s waist, Hamish’s on his face and his shoulder, gripping him, pulling him so closely to him that they almost became the same person, Sherlock trying to hold Hamish to him just as much as Hamish was trying to hold Sherlock-
‘James is my oldest friend,’ Sherlock said, crossing off
Archie tried to look intimidating. ‘Archie.’ He said adamantly. ‘Not Archibald.’
John had wondered why Mycroft and Sherlock seemed familiar with each other and thought about asking, but it was explained by the
His parents had looked at each other worriedly, but like a fool John had just gone, not suspecting a thing. He hadn’t even been afraid when he realised he was not alone in the car; two men, one in a black suit (bodyguard, John thought) and one who didn’t look to be much older than twenty-four or five, who was clearly a copper. The bodyguard was fingering a gun and the policeman looked vaguely sick: John thought he recognised him as Lestrade, the man who supplied Sherlock with the case files that made him so happy, and had attempted to make conversation but Lestrade had just shaken his head and said quietly, ‘you’re required to remain silent, Mr Watson.’
’ John gasped. ‘
It had been about four months since they’d started going out, and Sherlock and John had been in John’s room. They had gone up on the pretence of playing Mario Kart (Sherlock was scarily good at Mario Kart. It made John physically uncomfortable to see him smash all the records, take home all the trophies and destroy every member of the race without even breaking a sweat) and ended up lying mostly naked in bed with Sherlock giving John one of his breath-taking blowjobs.
‘Sherlock.’ Mrs Watson tried, voice quaking. ‘This is surreal-‘
'It doesn't matter why you're here, John,' Sherlock said quietly. 'Just the fact that you are here is good enough for me. And I know, I know that there must be some motive and you're going to leave again but let me say, please let me say, that I have missed you more than I thought it was able to miss someone and I'm
‘That’s exactly what I said, when I first met him!’ John burst out. ‘Exact words, right, Sher?’
He didn’t reply. Instead, John stood on his tiptoes and kissed Sherlock in front of his kingdom and thought about the sixteen year old boy who had watched this same man on the balcony and wondered if he would ever be truly happy.
Sherlock leaned forward and studied the box, before picking it up and sniffing it. ‘No chemicals. Probably not an experiment. When I first moved in here I put a load of junk in the spare bedroom. It must have been something we missed when we cleared it out before you were born.’
Sholto nodded and looked John up and down again. ‘Nothing. Unlike ANY OF YOU! Waters, shoelaces untied. Murphy, dirt on sleeve. Hunter- where the hell is your gun, Hunter?’
‘Neither do I,’ he said quietly.
he was, by John and by Sherlock.
‘DADDY!’ Violet shouted. ‘You’re just doing that to try and make me clean.’
‘That’s good!’ Irene smiled, patting Charlotte on the shoulder. ‘But-‘
‘Fuck me, you’re hot,’ Hamish rasped, and bit down hard on Sherlock’s neck.
John dropped seven pounds into Sherlock’s hand and then left the bookshop as quickly as he could, smirking as he walked down the street.
‘You do that.’ John laughed again, one hand still clutching Sherlock’s shoulder, and
‘So…no wine?’ The waiter asked again, this time in a bored tone.
'Is that even a question?’ Sherlock smiled, even though his heart twisted, as it always did when John was mentioned. 'I made the worst mistake of my life, Mycroft, and I will never forgive myself, not for as long as I live. I would do anything to have John Watson back.'
‘I need to get to Hunter!’ John said, trying to be calm, even though Hunter didn't even seem to be twitching anymore. ‘Can’t this wait?’ He tried to stand up but Becca grabbed his arm, pulling him down. ‘I won’t let you go until you answer me.’
For the first time since he was five years old, Sherlock felt a mother’s touch, and suddenly all those memories, everything he had kept locked up for the past twelve years, came flooding out.
‘Shit,’ John whispered to himself. Sherlock, lying dazed on the tiles, was completely silent.
John’s mouth fell open. ‘You know
‘No.’ James said sternly, batting away the hand Sherlock had snuck to his cock. ‘No touching yourself. You are coming untouched today, Sherlock.’
For some reason Sherlock had dragged him down there to pick up some files from Mycroft, his snivelling older brother who had somehow risen to the rank of youngest MP ever. John didn’t like Mycroft, he was annoying and over-bearing and had offered John insane amounts of money to spy on his little brother.
‘Silence, Lestrade.’ Sherlock commanded, eyeing the man with distaste. He would be considered attractive, Sherlock supposed, in a very common way; his brown hair was silky, though greying despite his relatively young age of twenty-six; he was smaller than Sherlock but still an adequate height of five foot nine inches; his features were pleasant, though they did nothing for Sherlock, and he was fit. Ish. He supposed.
‘You’re staring,’ Sherlock said, a smile in his voice, and the feeling disappeared immediately as John coughed and looked out across the lake. ‘Yeah. Just lost in thought, thinking about girls and black ops and, um, rugby.’
‘No!’ Sherlock shouted, gripping John tighter, then, more quietly, ‘No. Please, John, ne me quitte pas.’
John didn’t reply. Instead, he was totally focused on the parade, which he couldn’t exactly see (there was a huge crowd of people in front of him, blocking it from view) but could most definitely hear, just as it had been nine years ago, if not a little louder.
‘Who doesn’t like football?’ Charlie protested.
‘Amen,’ echoed the crowd. Sherlock just stood there, a robot, still, not comprehending what was happening because all his brain could say, shout, scream was
‘Of course,’ Sherlock said. ‘You just beat me to it. Did I never tell you that?’
Mycroft rolled his eyes but Sherlock could tell by the slight blush and pleased yet bemused half smile that Mycroft did want to talk about whoever the hell it was who had captured the heart of a man who Sherlock had been almost convinced was utterly asexual. ’Do you swear on John’s life never to tell anyone?’
And John did.
Sherlock didn’t realise he had been stripped naked until he felt James pinch his nipples. He keened, kissing James wantonly as he grinded upwards, his cock firm and upright and leaking pre-come all over his stomach. James was still fully-clothed, smiling at Sherlock with a delight the younger boy had never seen before and why was he doing this he hated this boy this boy had hurt his country and his family and Jesus, Sherlock, why can’t you just say-
There was a wooshing sound in Sherlock’s ears, a ringing in the background, and he felt suddenly and strangely sick. He was stumbling to his feet and looking at Irene (was that even her real name? Was anything she had told him true?) and he knew he had to get as far away as possible.
It’s John that reaches up, in the end. It’s John that presses his lips to Sherlock’s, and it’s John who burns out Sherlock’s matchstick, blows out the last lick of fire, and consumes his soul with the universe. It’s John who snakes his hands into Sherlock’s hair, pulling him close, desperately kissing him like everything is ending, everything is broken, everything is destroyed, and all that’s left is Sherlock and John in the remains of the lives they’ve built for, with, against each other: the lives they might have had, if Moriarty and Reichenbach and Mary and Magnusson and the aquarium had never happened.
Sherlock had met someone else who he seemed to like
There is silence, John staring at the album, Sherlock staring at John, until the silence becomes too heavy. ‘Please, John, please talk to me.’

have been better.’ Still laughing, she stood up. ‘I’ll see you later, Sherlock.’
‘Yes.’ Charlotte acknowledged, dropping the subject, though she was looking at Sherlock with narrowed eyes. ‘I am. Lucy’s teething and her screams keep the entire castle awake.’ Charlotte lived with her youngest son, Zachariah, who was now fifty-three, and his three children. Sherlock hated them; they were insufferable, especially the toddler, who never seemed to stop crying.
‘If you mean St. Andrews, yes I did,’ Lizzie laughs. ‘Fuck you, nerd.’
‘Are you?’ John said again. His voice was lower than usual, Sherlock realised numbly.
He visits Sherlock’s grave one last time and tells him that they’ll be together soon. He then decides that he will spend five minutes alone with every single person in his family, and then he will die. Simple as that.
‘Definitely not a bad idea,’ Sherlock mumbled, and John bit down hard on his bottom lip (did Sherlock groan? He thought he might have). ‘No. Good idea. Very-
‘Not at all.’ Sherlock answered quickly. ‘I’d be delighted for John to join us.’
was. Love was wanting the other person to be happy, even when their happiness was breaking your heart: love was being willing to watch the other person loving someone else, because as long as they were smiling
John’s done this with so many grandchildren now that he feels like a professional: he congratulates Charlotte, who’s being wheeled away to be cleaned up. He suspects she only agreed to go because she’s high on pain medication - no way would the Charlotte he knows leave her children mere moments after they were born - but he’s happy, because he wants a moment alone with his son and his grandsons.
John didn't know how it happened.
‘That’s it,’ Ella said urgently, guiding Lila’s feet into the stirrups. ‘Come on, girl. Almost there.’
the last lick of flame’s been transferred to another matchstick
‘Yeah.’ Sherlock promised, fingers crossed behind his back. This was insane. Mycroft, aged twenty-five years old, and Sherlock, aged eighteen, were having a DMC (according to John, this stood for Deep Meaningful Conversation) about someone Mycroft liked.
His heart stops in his chest.
with the whole situation: the dying, the riddles, the lack of control. Maybe Mycroft’s right, and he’s been Moriarty’s puppet for months and months, but at least until recently he didn’t
Sherlock was smiling at him again, and John put it out of his mind for the moment. He kissed Sherlock again and flipped them over so Sherlock was under him. ‘Now,’ he smirked, ‘it’s your turn.’
‘Johnny’s gay!’ Seb cried, and the others joined in. ‘Gay, gay, gay, gay-‘
Sherlock scowled. ‘So what if I have,
John smiled and was about to say something witty back when there was a sudden cheer and catcalls. ‘What the-‘ Irene said, before breaking off with a small, ‘Oh.’
‘He’s
‘Me, neither.’ Freddy said, too focused on his Nintendo to really pay attention. ‘What did you even say, Seb? Fraggots?’
‘I slept with her, no feelings were involved. She’s infatuated with Molly.’ Sherlock crossed off
Sherlock rolled his eyes and ignored the voice. ‘Yes, of course. Always for you.’ Then, realising that he sounded like a love-sick fool, continued, ‘as long as there’s not a murder to solve.’
‘I’ve made no progression,’ Sherlock moaned. ‘None. He barely likes me at the moment as it is.’
And went down on John so fast he could barely see it. Sherlock’s mouth, sucking and licking the head of his dick, his hand moving furiously around the shaft-
‘Look who it is.’ William said, eyes fixed on John. ‘My son’s little fuck buddy.’
John opened his mouth, ready to ask what Sherlock meant when he said later; was he saying he wanted to see John again? Was he asking to be John’s friend? Had he actually made friends with a Prince in a coffee shop? Then he decided better of it. From what he had heard, from what he had read, Sherlock had no need for friends. Especially not ordinary, average-Joes like John.
‘They’ll kill you if I don’t, John.’ Sherlock said, voice resigned. ‘They told me that they’ll kill you-‘
Nathaniel is still talking but John has zoned out completely: it was the way he
‘Get out.’ Jenny said, shaking with anger. ‘Get the hell out, Harriet. You have no idea what they’ve done for us-’

‘I was named for my great-grandfather, Sherlock Thomas,’ Sherlock continued to whisper. ‘But shortly before my birth, my mother’s brother, William, died, and so they named him after me.’
Harry laughed; she liked Sherlock, John knew she did, and Sherlock liked her for some odd reason. ‘Oh yeah. Sorry, mate. Well. Don’t let me keep you.’
John made a noise that could have been a laugh and said, ‘I don't know. I've never done this before.'
Mycroft swallowed thickly and Sherlock looked at his brother curiously. ‘Mycroft? Are you alright?’

John smiled and turned away from Mycroft. ‘You haven't seen me in four years. You don't know me.’
John can see his shock in his face, he knows he can, because he laughs, a dry, broken laugh from dry, broken lips. ‘Texting. Just texting, but I wanted more.’
Molly dropped the plate and pulled Sherlock away from the oven; the flames were growing, intense heat directed straight at them. ‘WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?’ She shouted, grabbing a tea towel and flapping them at the oven.
‘For real,’ Rosie said, and both John and Sherlock turned their heads to look at their daughter. ‘Are you going to stare into each other’s eyes for the rest of the evening, or are you going to collect your child? Christ, fathers.’ Sherlock chuckled slightly, his colour slowly coming back, and chucked Rosie under the chin. ‘Alright, alright.’ And then, glancing at Greg, hair covered in dust from the untouched room and coat swaying around his shins, ‘You’ll have to solve this one alone, Lestrade. We have to go and have a baby.’
The thrill will make all of it
wrong.
There was a stunned silence. Irene looked surprised, John felt awful, and the boy’s snake smile widened. ‘You heard the man.’
‘Sherlock.’
‘Really?’ John sounded so surprised that Sherlock could almost believe it was genuine. ‘Even more than Jim?’
It was at this point that John began to feel slightly uneasy.
The taxi ride to Bart’s was long, tense and absolutely
The building was small, with only one room, and John couldn't help but wonder at the number of teenagers crammed into it. There were ten older teenagers aged between about 16-18 in one corner, another group of about fifteen in the 13-15 age range in another and over twenty in the last half of the room. The children in this half were John’s age or a year younger and were crowded around a tall boy about John’s age with a shock of dark, curly hair and really
Sherlock tightened the last screw and passed the model to his son, who smiled and took out a kidney. ‘This is very good,’ he murmured. ‘Did we say thank you to whichever university sent this to me?’
‘A hell of a lot worse than William Sherlock Scott or Edward Mycroft.’ Sherlock finished. ‘Why are we here, Trisha? Are we having a family meeting without that insufferable bitch?’
It didn’t matter, though. He wasn’t let out of the palace. He sat by the door for the rest of the day and waited for John to come back, hoped against all hopes that John hadn’t left him, sat there and waited for the person he cared about most to come back so Sherlock could say sorry and beg him to forgive him.
now. ‘Go on, you have my full attention.’
John sat up straighter. ‘Are you calling me a liar-‘
Sherlock’s breathing was coming in short gasps. ‘I’m not my father’s child?’
‘Go look, idiot.’
And Mycroft is right. They have a son together, the accomplishment of Sherlock’s life, his greatest achievement and his greatest weakness. They live together. When Sherlock thinks the word
‘Oh!’ John said, surprised, before sticking out his free hand and smiling. ‘Hi, I’m John, Harry’s brother.’
It hurt to think about how much he needed him.
‘So what colour is yours?’ Sarah fluttered her eyelashes, tracing the back of John’s hand gently. John smiled and pulled back his sleeves, revealing the large, dark blue bruise on his tanned skin. ‘Got that yesterday. Think they got hit by a ball.’
‘He thinks you’re trouble,’ Mike laughed. ‘He keeps saying you’re a bad influence on me.’
And then John was apologising, over and over. He couldn’t remember exactly what he said, but at one point the words I’m your biggest fan crossed his lips and he said the words your royal highness and your majesty about a billion times before Prince Sherlock, now looking slightly bored, said, ‘don’t apologise.’
He still hadn’t told him when they sat down to dinner, John spoon-feeding Rosie noodles as Sherlock picked at his beef.
And then, as suddenly as she had appeared, Harry had walked out. They lay in silence for a bit, breathing slowing, before Sherlock said matter-of-factly, ‘I do like your sister.’
Suddenly, a hand seized Irene’s shoulder and pulled her towards them; Sherlock frowned when he saw Charlotte Bennet, Irene’s once-favourite client. ‘Irene,’ Charlotte whispered, ‘I need to tell you something.’
Sherlock looked slightly shell-shocked; John felt slightly sick. ‘Yessss?’
Sherlock stood up and cleared his throat. His friends and family (and John’s friends) stared back at him.
The other members of John’s family were freaking out but John just focused on the children. They didn’t look upset; most of them seemed to be lapping up the attention. Dean, who looked about twenty, was actually waving; his handsome face was shown on the screens covering the square.
‘Brother mine,’ the man says, and Sherlock’s heart feels a little less heavy. ‘Mycroft.’
And so now I am here, and I am saying that I forgive you, that I'm sorry.'
That’s all that needs to be said. Wordlessly, the two remaining sons of Siger Holmes, two of the
John looked down quickly, wondering what he had missed. He was usually perfect for role-call, and racked his brains for what he had left behind or done wrong. Freshly polished boots, check; neat, clean uniform, check; rifle and knife, check-
Sherlock shook his head frantically, trying to delete those thoughts that James had planted in his head, so sneakily, so craftily, and said in a small voice, ‘no. He’s just emotional, hurt-‘
This was John showing no emotion, not even a flicker of anger on his features.
Harry moved closer to John and put her arm around his shoulders. ‘We’ll always stick together, right, Johnny?’ She said. The smell of alcohol was overpowering but John managed to nod, kissing his sister on the cheek. ‘Course, Harry.’
thing, Lestrade. Not John’s. James supplied me with a similar idea concerning body parts but we determined that it was probably a little risqué for him.’
Not again, John. Not again.
‘Only one in ten people are left-handed, Christopher, that would be illogical.’ Sherlock said, opening the newspaper and frowning. ‘John,
John stayed very, very still, eyes fixed on the gun.
‘No.’ John said. ‘I mean, I’ve had girlfriends, and I’ve done stuff to them, and they’ve tossed me off, but nothing with a dude.’
That’s what he called it: the line of dark blue skin that encircled his left wrist, exactly like a bracelet. He’d seen bond marks before: he’d touched both of his parents’, marvelling at the slightly puckered skin, but he’d never seen one quite so prominent as his. It was so noticeable that it was always the first thing anyone commented on, and then he had to tell them that no, he wasn’t with his soulmate, because all he could remember about his soulmate was curly dark hair, a masculine voice and brilliantly soft lips. He didn’t have a name, a number, an age, even a nationality. He had nothing.
‘I want you,’ he hears himself say, and Victor opens his eyes, brilliant green meeting bright violet. ‘I love you.’
Please comment and leave kudos, and comment any ideas for my next work! :)
‘Not lying?’ John chuckled. ‘God, Sherlock. You have no idea, do you?
‘At approximately 7 p.m,’ Mycroft continued as Jenny trembled next to Henry, ‘on the fifteenth of December, 2018, King William Henry Siger Richard, our monarch, my father,’ Mycroft coughed slightly and John could see his eyes, glistening with tears, ‘died at the age of sixty-five.’
‘What, Sherlock? What do you want me to say? What do you want me to do that I’m not already doing?’ His voice was rising, and Sherlock wasn't sure if he preferred it like that or not (he didn't really have a choice, really) but John was staring at him like…
John’s hand squeezed Sherlock’s as if reading his thoughts. ‘You and Greg-‘
Or at least, that’s what he told himself.
John snaps.
Sherlock shook his head. ‘It isn't a nice phrase. Ignore me.’
Sherlock had left him and Sherlock must pay. John realises how snide and awful he was, now, because he could have had four more years with Sherlock, if only he’d not wanted his own back.
‘I didn’t.’ Sherlock didn’t sound angry, exactly; he sounded more shocked. ‘How could I not?’
The boy on the floor raised his head in interest. ‘You never bring in new people,’ he mused. This boy had lighter brown hair, with green eyes, and was wearing a tie, a pair of very tight blue shorts and a tank top. ‘What’s so special about this John, hey?’
Sherlock let go of James and pulled away, taking a step towards John. As he moved forwards he felt something drip out of him and close his eyes.
It was no-brainer. John watched Sherlock walk towards his father and he resigned himself to the fact that of course Sherlock would choose his family, of course he would. It was the only sane option, particularly when you stood to inherit the most powerful nation in the world, God, John was being so, so stupid-
Sherlock swallowed hard and repeated, ‘no one,’ before turning, slamming the door and running back to his quarters.
‘Ignore the paparazzi.’ Sherlock muttered as they approached the guard post. ‘Don’t look at them. If Morag sees a picture of me and a boy sneaking into the palace with a headline like Prince’s bumboy; is our future King a fag? She’ll freak.’
‘I think it’s adorable.’ Jim wiped his mouth, grinning widely at the scowl that seemed permanently fixed to Sherlock’s face. ‘Look at them.
John jolted out of his reverie and smiled down at Molly. ‘Alright, Mol.’
He recognises the handwriting of the address, and opens it carelessly: he’s expecting the usual drivel from Mycroft, the
‘Do you go to Cambridge?’ John could almost hear the smile in Sherlock’s voice, and he bit his lip. ‘What do you fucking think.’
Sherlock blinked. ‘People generally tell me to piss off.’
Siger brushed past. His white hair was mussed up and John was pretty sure he was wearing his pyjamas, but he didn't seem bothered by this as he said to Jenny, ‘Have you seen or heard anything in the past few hours?’
'John-'
Now, however, was not the time, because finally,
‘Oh, god, yes, Sherlock, please.’ John managed to say, and Sherlock smirked again-
He didn’t hear back from John. He checked his phone throughout the night, as he sat up in bed, mind racing. He checked his phone in the taxi in the morning, his life packed into the suitcase sitting next to him. He checked his phone as they checked in their bags at the airport, and then he put it away, resigned. It was too late.
‘OH MY GOD,’ Sherlock screeched as flames shot out of the oven and singed his eyebrows. ‘MOLLY! YOUR OVEN HAS MALFUNCTIONED! HORRIBLY HORRIBLY MALFUNCTIONED!”
he can see Sherlock again.
‘Why would it matter to you if Sherlock was a homosexual?’ Charlotte said adamantly. ‘There’s nothing wrong with it. Are you living in the stone age, son? I had hoped I would raise you better than this.’ A real smile crept onto Sherlock’s lips as he looked at his grandmother. This was why he loved her, he thought. Because of moments exactly like this.
That was over. John needed to act, act now, before it was too late.
for the first time since he was fifteen-
‘Time for the weekly address, then?’ He said quietly.
Footsteps clattered past the door; after another moment, John was released. ‘What the fuck?’ He shouted, squinting. They were in a very cramped, small room; it was barely bigger than a broom cupboard, and John was pressed against someone.
‘How do you know him?’ The words were out of John’s mouth before he could stop them, and Sherlock’s smile widened. ‘If I didn’t know better, I would say you were jealous, John Watson.’
Mycroft nodded, eyebrows furrowed. ‘Trap?’
‘No!’ John shouted. ‘God, no. I’ve not got a girlfriend. I’ve brought them, though. Um, Sher? Come in.’
‘So,’ Hamish was saying, and Sherlock shifted his attention back to him. ‘Sherlock. Why
Their son is born in the early hours of the morning with his older sister, grandma and uncle sitting in the corridor, waiting. Their son is born as John holds the hand of their surrogate, wishing with all his might that his partner was still there to witness this, to see his baby
Sherlock had replaced John. He hadn’t loved John. He had never loved John-
John threw his head back and laughed and Sherlock couldn't help smiling because it was him who had made John laugh like that,
Him and Sherlock settle back into the routine they had before the fall: solving cases, chasing criminals and fucking in alleyways. The only difference is that John has Mary, now, and he can’t let her know because he needs her to help him break Sherlock. Even now he can see it starting: the pain in Sherlock’s face when he sees Mary, the anger in his eyes when John kisses her, the heartbreak that John can see written all over his face when John and Mary talk about the wedding, or the apartment, or their future together.
John shut up.
‘I love you,’ Sherlock interrupted, and John was hit by that overwhelming, swelling feeling in his chest, and he gripped the back of his head, ignoring the pain, pulling Sherlock’s head towards his own so their foreheads were touching, and he looked right into his beautiful blue eyes and said it back, repeating those three words over and over. ‘I love you, I love you,’ they muttered together, and John felt pure and unadulterated happiness for the first time in forever-
‘I’m here now.’ Sherlock reassured him. ‘Won’t have to go again until Easter, and then I’ll be back here for good.’ He looked a little sad and John instantly felt horrible: he knew that Sherlock hated having to spend all his time in London, barely allowed to go outside unescorted, and at least in Oxford he was at least partially free. On the other hand John was incredibly selfish when it came to Sherlock and he wanted the younger boy by his side whenever possible.
‘You.’ Sherlock said bluntly and Irene looked slightly ashamed. ‘Oh.’
‘Glad to hear it.’ Jim, who was carving something into an apple with a wickedly sharp knife that clearly did not belong on the table, stood up. ‘Excuse me a moment.’
‘Hey,’ John whispered, ignoring his daughter for the moment, looking his partner straight in the eye. ‘Hey. Stop. Look at me.’
As they walked to the Quad after John had flung on a pair of jeans and a black t-shirt, Siger explained what had happened. ‘The security guard tipped us off about an hour ago: he said he saw two or three shapes sprinting out of the resort into an awaiting car. We got up and checked the safe just to be sure and found the plans missing: about half an hour later, Violet got a mandatory text from the bank saying that fifty thousand pounds had been withdrawn. Two of her credit cards were missing.’
Sherlock sighed and ran a hand through his hair. ‘I don’t want to.’
He had asked his friend Molly, once, why she thought the royals were still so popular; even more so than they had been three decades before. She had answered with, ‘because the whole country adores them. They’re a symbol of all of us, and they do us so proud. We’re the most powerful nation on the planet, John!’
gasped in the corner) and pulling him towards the main pool. ‘Mike’s doing work experience in Paris until next month and I’m
‘Ok,’ John had said, sprawled across the red chair that Sherlock privately referred to as ‘John’s chair’ in his mind palace. ‘Tell me something you’ve never told anyone else.’
Jenny nodded, a strange look on her face. Sherlock wondered what was wrong but detained from saying anything as the woman smiled. ‘It was lovely to meet you, Prin- Sherlock. Surreal, but lovely.’
But Sherlock was standing there, a wicked smile on his regal features, and John wanted to know why he looked so sad.
Sherlock was next to John in under three seconds.
‘Because he feels like he owes it to my mother. He loved my mother, and he thinks if he protects me he’s paying her back.’ Sherlock explained. ‘Stupid, really.’
James closed his eyes briefly and for a short moment Sherlock thought (hoped) that James would just accept this, leave him alone, never trouble him again-
This was when Sherlock realised that he had two options.
Coming in a way he never had before as James filled him, but suddenly, in the midst of his orgasm, he was remembering John, John who had saved him, John who he loved with all his heart and what was he doing? Why was he doing this? His orgasm ended and suddenly he was thinking clearly and he’d made the worst mistake of his entire life.
‘I started that rumour that you were the bastard son of Prince Marcus,’ Irene said, ignoring him completely. ‘And that boy tried to kidnap you for ransom-‘
‘It means,’ Jenny said, shooting a look at Harry, ‘that whatever it is, it’s being broadcast to the entire empire and our allies, not just us. That’s unusual.’
John closed his eyes and sniffed the air. It smelt like candyfloss, and tears, and sickly-sweet perfume.
He had watched Prince Sherlock, standing there looking wretched and drawn with bags under his eyes, his older brother holding his arm tightly. He had watched the King glare at his middle son when he thought the cameras had been turned off and he had watched Sherlock visibly wince when his father mentioned James Moriarty.
‘I love you,’ Sherlock managed to say, eyes still closed and hair flopping beautifully over his forehead.
‘Ouch,’ Jim said sarcastically, doing up his flies on Sherlock’s bed. ‘A whore. Never been called that before, though it’s addressed to a friend of mine quite often. You’d love her, Sherlock. Maybe I should organise a, ah, playdate, with the three of us.’
him.'
Sherlock smiled slightly. ‘True.’
John didn’t say anything, though Sherlock could hear him breathing behind him, and it unnerved him because usually John chattered incessantly. Sherlock whipped out his phone and quickly texted Jack, his chauffeur: as expected, he received a reply within seconds.
‘Boys.’ Trisha snapped. ‘No.’
Water spurted out of the hose into the oven.
It’s been echoing back for days, along with the face that his flatmate/friend/blogger pulled as he said it: a mixture of disappointment and sadness.
John knew something had been covered up by the royal family, but he didn't know what and he didn't say anything because he didn't want to mysteriously disappear like the other liberalists. Instead he stayed quiet and tried to forget about the Eye massacre.
what to say to hurt Sherlock the
‘Language,’ John hissed as Sheila frowned and said, ‘I’m sorry, John, but when it’s time for the birth your daughter won’t be allowed in the delivery room.’
John hadn’t laughed when Sherlock told him this; in fact, he had looked slightly sheepish. ‘How did you get into that?’ He had asked curiously.
) in full-blown, child-is-imminent labour. John was dressed in blue scrubs, Sherlock was similarly attired but looking much grumpier about it, and they were about to be fathers.
Sherlock, probably more than any other person he’s ever met, and Sherlock likes him.
‘So are you,’ John murmured, and in that moment it seemed to only be them in the bar, staring into each others eyes. ‘To my rules, I mean.’
John, who had been skulking sheepishly behind an ornate pillar, appeared and walked shyly towards Sherlock, who introduced him. ‘Charlie, this is John Watson. John, this is my grandmother.’
Thanks for reading, kids.
Sherlock sighed, glared at John, and knocked briskly three times.
‘Yes.’ Sherlock acknowledged. ‘But I liked it.’
‘Stop apologising!’ Sherlock said through gritted teeth. ‘I hate it when people apologise for being rude to me! It’s so annoying! Wait,’ he scrutinised John quickly, ‘you won’t tell anyone about this? I’m not- I’m not really meant to talk to commoners. Or leave the palace. Not after…’ he trailed off and John looked up in interest, before remembering who he was talking to and bowing his head in shame again. ‘Yeah, I won’t tell,’ he said, though inside he was screaming at himself to shut up. ‘Can I have a selfie?’ He cringed, wondering what the hell was wrong with him. Why had he suddenly got verbal diarrhoea?
‘Don’t worry,’ Jim grinned, slapping Sherlock on the back. ‘My body parts idea is genius. And I have an even better idea for your first date-‘
Sherlock took the list and his mouth dropped open.
The door opened again.
‘Compared with everything else that’s happened today, it’s cake.’ John replied. Sherlock laughed, the laugh that he reserved just for John, hearty and real, and it made John laugh too until they were in hysterics, just feet from the balcony where Sherlock would be making an announcement that had seemed, this morning, impossible.
Christopher and Sherlock were very similar in terms of personality: both were incredibly intelligent and had sub-par social skills, though Christopher's were marginally better than his father's. They even walked the same way: that graceful, sauntering walk that exuded power, though Christopher, with his light brown hair and deep blue eyes, looked a real mixture of his parents.
‘Fine,’ Mycroft hissed. ‘Fine. But I’m telling you, Sherlock, I will drive you to that dance and there is

‘It felt like longer.’ John said sulkily. ‘I had nothing to do.’

‘This was the song on the CD,’ Violet shouted over the intro. ‘It’s quite pretty, isn't it?’
‘He’s a bit of a twat,’ John agreed, ‘but he loves you, Sher.’
Smith told him how they had thought it was a bomb; several people had scattered, several had drawn their rifles, some were even screaming that this was it, the rebels had found their camp and they were dead, all of them dead, and Smith said he hadn't minded, because a life without Hunter wasn't a life at all.
‘Give me
‘No,’ Sherlock agrees, and John pulls slightly back from him. Before he can help himself he’s raised his right hand, wiping a tear as it falls from John’s left eye. ‘But it is what it is.’
because Sherlock needed to be alright.
He was about to step in when Morag said, ‘you must have suspected me.’
‘Oh, I think I am, Michael,’ Sherlock smirked. ‘But you love me. I know you do.’
That’s all that matters, all that ever mattered, and John
Christopher lifted his nose and smiled at Charlie. ‘We are just debating what I’m going to call myself when I become King,’ he said loftily. Charlie’s face crumpled and she moved closer to John, moaning, ‘Papa, he’s being mean! Just because he’s a year older…’
And Sherlock kissed him again, as the moon trickled through the open skylight, and in that moment John knew that he would never love someone more than he loved Sherlock, not for as long as he would live.

The boy looked at him in despair. ‘Yes. Your name is irrelevant. Now we are acquainted, how can I help?’
‘Oh, yes,’ John grinned, and for the first time in months he felt confident, properly confident. ‘He’s being very good.’
‘My father can’t keep it in his pants.’ Sherlock’s stretched out on the bed, hands behind his head. John laughs. ‘What do you mean?’
‘I’m sorry about earlier,’ John muttered. ‘I didn’t mean- I mean, I know it’s not your fault, and it can’t be helped.’

Sherlock smiled coldly at his reflection and turned away, walking slowly towards the bed. ‘Do we have time…?’ He asked Irene, already fiddling with the button on his trousers.
Sherlock smiled back and shook Henry’s hand firmly; the soldier seemed delighted. ‘No offence, Prince-‘
‘I was born on the nineteenth of July, 1998.’ John looked up, confused. ‘Yes, that makes me just eighteen years old, but I’m in my third year. I am the second son of ordinary people, I grew up in a cottage in Surrey, I have an older brother who’s an utter prick. Victor lived next door to me then…’ he frowned. ‘There was an incident. He nearly died, but not- not quite. I don’t remember very well. I was bullied at school, I had no friends (Victor was in the year above) but I was smart. Really smart. At secondary school, I became friends with another...’ He paused, choosing his words carefully. ‘Another

’ most of the adults said collectively. John caught his mum’s eye: she looked more confused than John felt.
Sherlock had been doing exams at Oxford University for over two weeks. He had started Uni at the age of sixteen, just after John had met him, and now, a year and a half later, he was halfway through his second year. John couldn't have been more proud of him, of course, but Sherlock had spent most of the school year going between Oxford and Buckingham, preparing, and that had meant much less time with John.
The curtain twitched again, and a strikingly beautiful girl about the same age as Sherlock stepped onto the balcony. She stood next to Mycroft, who frowned at her and wrinkled his nose in the same way that he had done when he looked at John, originally, and Sherlock turned around, away from the crowd, and-
*****
John got ready as quickly as he could, pulling on an old t-shirt and pyjama bottoms, then brushing his teeth. He stared at himself in the mirror. His stomach fluttered nervously, and he scowled. It was just Sherlock, after all. Just Sherlock, who’d he’d been in love with for a very long time. In love. Fuck. He knew that he was in love with Sherlock, but their kisses made it all the more real, made his feelings more powerful. Steeling himself, he pushed the bathroom door open and stepped into Sherlock’s room. Sherlock was sitting on his bed, a dressing gown draped around him. He had changed out of his trousers and shirt and into pyjama bottoms and a t-shirt. John thought he looked beautiful. He couldn’t help smiling at the sight of Sherlock.
“Took you long enough, though.” A chilling laugh sent shivers up his spine.
“Absolutely not. No.” John shook his head. “You are not going.”
“You-egotistical-bastard!” He wheezed.
“I am warning you,” Sherlock said. “I don’t know if she’ll be in a good state.”
“Christ, Sherlock, no. I’ve wanted this for ages. I’m sure you can deduce that I don’t really care about Jeanette,” he said, trying to be reassuring. “I’m not upset about us breaking up. It’s you I like, it always has been.” He thought perhaps that was the least romantic speech he’d ever made, but Sherlock sagged against him with relief. “As a matter of fact, do you know what she said when she broke up with me?”
Sherlock entered his mind palace. The hallways were dark and gloomy, many of the rooms barred and locked. Including John’s. He briefly considered deleting John’s wing entirely, but couldn’t bear to erase him completely. Sentiment. Weakness.
“She said,
“I already gave you my forgiveness. That night in the tube. Where you lied again.” That was a low blow, and Sherlock knew John knew that. Sherlock also knew he deserved it.
Sherlock followed him down the sidewalk. The Chinese place John picked was only a few blocks away. They walked quickly, not really talking. Sherlock kept his eyes fixed on the small of John’s back. His hands were cold, even in his pockets, and he ached to reach out and cradle John’s hands in between his own. He gripped the material in his pockets, unwilling to betray his feelings that obviously. John wasn’t talking to him, and their once-familiar strolls through the city felt awkward and new. Sherlock was lost. He didn’t know how to talk to John again. Nor did he know how to forgive John for what he did. He wanted to, oh how he wanted to, but it was difficult. John’s actions landed Sherlock in a hospital, for Gods’ sake. A hospital. With a broken rib and a bruised lung. He swallowed, a lump suddenly coming to his throat, and blinked.
“I can’t see him,” Sherlock said, but he
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut as his breath came in short gasps. Tears pricked at his eyes. John. John. John. His thoughts moved rapid-fire, circling through his head. Images, words. The kiss. John pushing him away.
“Of course I would. You weren’t exactly subtle.”
“John,” he said, a little louder this time. “I’m going to tell you something. I suspect nobody’s ever told you before. So I will.” He took a breath. “Whatever happened during your childhood, whatever you might think, it wasn’t your fault. Your father’s treatment of you and Harry wasn’t your fault. The fact that he was abusive wasn’t your fault. He did this. He drank, he yelled, he hurt you. You were a child. You couldn’t stop him. Harry couldn’t stop him. Only he could, and he didn’t seem to be trying very hard. It’s not your fault.”
Sherlock wasn’t in the flat the next morning.
“Good.” He flung himself back onto the bed. The door shut with more force than Sherlock had anticipated. John’s footsteps echoed through the flat, heavier than usual. Sherlock heard him call to Mrs. Hudson. Good. Let him walk away. It wasn’t as if it hurt or anything.
The Admiral Duncan is one of Soho's oldest gay pubs. There was a bombing there that killed three people and wounded at least seventy. This bombing was motivated by homophobia. It happened 30 April 1999.
He tried to keep his face neutral, emotion threatening to overwhelm him. “Yes.” He blinked, his eyebrows drawn.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Mary knows, I think,” John said. “She doesn’t care much.”
“Shh, shh. Mary.” John was smiling at her, tears in his eyes, nodding his head. He smoothed her hair back.
“Right, well, I’m off then,” John said awkwardly. “See you Thursday.”
The beginnings of a headache started at the base of his skull. This was not the way he’d imagined spending John’s birthday. The uncomfortableness would be there, of course it would, but there would be talking and laughing and maybe telling old stories. Maybe John would talk about his previous birthdays. Maybe John would tell him about what he used to be like, before the war and before Mary. Sherlock knew that the war irrevocably changed him, of course it did, but to what extent? What was John Watson like before?
“What?”
“How what works? Sharing a bed?” Sherlock nodded. “Well,” John said. “Generally, you have to be lying down.” Sherlock flushed.
For the first time Mycroft’s cool demeanor flickered, briefly allowing anger to appear on his features. Something sparked in his eyes. “I won’t have you doing this.”
“Stay,” John whispered. Sherlock’s heart swelled. John was gazing up at him, eyes still watery with tears. He looked incredibly fragile.
You absolute bastard.”
John grasped his hand. The handshake lasted for a bit too long. Neither of them wanted to let go, to say goodbye.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. He was staring at John with such adoration that John thought,
The lights from the buildings reflected off the Thames. Wind tossed its surface, creating little waves against the current. John’s arm was around Sherlock. John was laughing, and talking, and telling stories, warmth against the chilly air. And Sherlock loved him. And John loved him back.
“Yeah, you do. You always have.” That was not a lie.
Rosie had fallen asleep on John’s chair, so John put the movie in. He pretended not to notice Sherlock closing his eyes and cataloguing everything in his Mind Palace, instead choosing to focus on the movie. Sherlock was next to him, but they weren’t touching.
“This will be an interesting one to blog about,” John remarked. “You hardly ever get this worked up about a case.”
Sunlight blinded him. He held up a hand to shield his eyes, walking quickly. He needed to get away. Needed to be anywhere but here. Anywhere but the dark room, too hot and too cold all at once. Somewhere where he didn’t have to hear John tell Mycroft all the ways he hated Sherlock.
“I’m okay. Thanks for picking her up.”
Sherlock thought for a minute. “Got high? Yes. Left rehab? Also yes.”
“I can see that,” Sherlock said. “Here, take my card. See if they’re ready.” He was halfway through the motions of taking his wallet out when John shook his head. Sherlock belatedly realised what it must have looked like: him, trying to get rid of John so he could go off to some alley and get high again. He
He barely contained an eye roll. It was evident why he was doing this, why did everyone seem so intent on forcing him to say it? “You know why,” he settled on saying.
“In saving my life, she conferred a value on it. It is a currency I do not know how to spend.”
Enjoy!
“Can you take her? I have to go to Tesco,” he said. “We need something more to eat than this.” John looked beyond stressed. His eyes were wide and his mouth was pressed in a thin line.
John chuckled. “That’s a good thing.”
“For...what? For you to get in another relationship? Why are you asking me this? Surely you know that I think it’s far too late.” Sherlock’s stomach plunged. Maybe John would break up with him now. Annoyance flickered over him. John should have said something earlier, before all this started. Sherlock didn’t think he could bear to lose John now.
“I said, go away.”
“I’m sorry. It’s company protocol.”
“I don’t know, either,” Sherlock said, still annoyed even though he couldn’t stop focusing on the
“Hear me say what?”
“Say it.”
“Shut up, Sherlock.” John said it softly, kindly, so Sherlock wasn’t affronted.
*****
Sherlock thought. He hadn’t gotten angry at her, not really, not about that. He was angry at her for lying to John. John didn’t deserve a liar. But then, John always did associate himself with people who weren’t the best. Case in point. He had crashed a funeral just to see John, who didn’t want anything to do with him.
Sherlock blushed at that. “Do you want the wine, or not?”
The room smelled faintly of John. Dust swirled into his mouth as he switched on the light. He coughed. He hadn’t allowed even Mrs. Hudson to come clean. The bed was neatly made, the sheets and blankets tucked in the corners with the military-precision Sherlock had expected from John. He placed the chair underneath the window. The wardrobe in the corner stood slightly open. A few of John’s old jumpers hung inside. Sherlock crossed the small room in a few steps, coming to a stop in front of it. He could see John standing there, right where he was. Could see him picking out what to wear for the day. He shook his head, his curls almost falling in his eyes. He hesitantly reached into the wardrobe and pulled out one of the jumpers. The soft material spilled over his hand and he brought it to his face. The John smell was stronger on the jumper than it had been in the room. He was aware of the dampness of the jumper on his cheek, aware that there were tears in his eyes. He sat down on the bed and clutched at the jumper, shoulders heaving. John. John. john. John put him in the hospital. John knew what he was doing, he was a bloody doctor. John
Fourth chapter. I didn't exactly mean for this to be as long as it is, but I got invested in the case in this chapter and made it longer than expected. Which means that there will be more chapters than I’d planned for.
“I’d still be in jail if it weren’t for you.”
“Go get dressed.”
“Good,” Sherlock said. “Everything’s in the kitchen.”
Sherlock’s phone rang one evening when he and John were sitting around in the flat. He had been working on a particularly tricky case involving more suicides, but this time they were all found with a gun. Only Sherlock truly didn’t believe they were suicides. For one thing, it was the same model of gun found with all of them, and the autopsy revealed the bullet fired hadn’t even been from that gun. For another, they all hadn’t shown any previous signs of being suicidal (Lestrade got all their medical files). The real issue was that they all happened at exactly the same time, all five of them, one per day. Starting with Monday, ending with Saturday. The murderer had left a note with the time of death on it for all of them. Typed, no fingerprints. None of them lived near the locations they were murdered at either. Today was the sixth day, and Sherlock firmly believed there would be another one. He was trying to figure out the pattern of the serial suicides before the next one died.
“I did, didn’t I?” Neither of them said anything for a long while. “I’m assuming you know by now. About the Detective Inspector and I. We’ve been friends for quite a while now, and I find myself enjoying his company.” Sherlock couldn’t miss the hint of fondness in Mycroft’s voice, and thought maybe something else was happening.
“What?”
Sherlock had to tell him. But he didn’t want to put any pressure on John. “John.” John tilted his head. “There’s something I should say. I meant to say, always, and I never have.” He paused. He needed to be careful about how he worded this. “Since it’s unlikely we’ll ever meet again,” that much was true. They definitely would not meet again, “I might as well say it now.” He wanted to tell him. John deserved to know everything. How much Sherlock loved him. How he wished things were different. How it should be them together, not him and Mary.
Sherlock exhaled and allowed John to take his hand away. “You scared me,” he complained.
to do that.
“You can’t just do that,” Lestrade protested. Sherlock ignored him and entered the hospital. “Go to the morgue! The body’s in there!” Sherlock followed the signs. The morgue was in the basement. The lights flickered once, casting an eerie feeling over the hallway. Sherlock’s ribs twinged as he pushed open the doorway. A man was sitting inside.
Word count: 4,344
John opened his mouth to protest, but found he had nothing to say. “Let’s just go home, then.”
“I figured. Thank you for telling me.” He trailed a hand through Sherlock’s hair.
Harry shook her head. “You’re a mess.”
“What?” Was John actually being polite to him?
“Yes,” Sherlock said. “Would you like to come?”
Sherlock breathed out, slowly.
He was transferred onto a bed and hooked up to a monitor. No. No! He had to get out of there. He had to warn someone. He tore off the monitor and sat up, ignoring the pain. He lashed out with his fists, making contact with someone. Garbled sounds rose from his throat. Voices called out around him. And then a needle was in his arm and he was sinking, down, down, down, into the darkness.
“I don’t want to feel all this!” Something broke inside of Sherlock and then he was sobbing. His chest heaved with each breath. Sounds came out of his mouth, wild, feral ones that he was completely embarrassed about but powerless to stop. His cheeks grew wet with tears. He tugged on his hair, relishing the small sparks of pain. He fell to his knees.
“That was beautiful,” John said.
Sherlock sighed. “John.”
“Congratulations, John!” Harry panted, her face flushed.
Sherlock abruptly pulled John towards him. John let out a little noise of surprise. Tremors ran through his body, either adrenaline or crying, Sherlock couldn’t tell. Though he didn’t think it was adrenaline. He wrapped his arms around John, hands spanning his back. John tucked his head into Sherlock’s chest. “Stop talking,” Sherlock mumbled against the top of his head. “Good?”
“Good,” John said, sleepily. Sherlock kissed the top of his head. John cuddled closer. “God, I love you.”
“We just got back.”
“To thank you, I don’t know, I thought you might want to know.”
Sherlock said with a huff, but they both knew that wasn’t true. He had been more closed off since he walked in the door, and Sherlock never accepted John’s hugs. Not to mention the gift, the shyness on his face as he gave it to him.
“Oh. Well. Good.” They lapsed back into silence.
John chose not to say anything. Sherlock frowned again. John kept his face infuriatingly pleasant. “Could you two please step out onto the floor? It’s time.”
A slightly slower song struck up and Harry lit up. “Dance?” She asked, holding out her arm. John let go of Sherlock’s hand to join her. Sherlock was glad. Harry passed Rosie to Clara and led John away.
“I love you too,” Sherlock said, and meant it. “I’m in love with you.”
Sherlock grinned back, shyly. He wanted every morning to be like this, and for right now he pretended that they could be.
Sherlock sprinted to the edge and leapt over, not caring if he fell or not. He flashed back to the first night with John.
“Oh.” A flicker of hope stirred in Sherlock’s chest. He ignored it. It didn’t matter how John felt. He would never see him again after this.
Sherlock was torn out of the (rather unpleasant and not relaxing, now that he thought about it) memory by John throwing open his door. “Sherlock!”
“Wine?” Sherlock offered. “Now that you’ve officially moved in?”
“Got it.”
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?”
“You look terrible,” Lestrade said, grimly.
“What’s going on?”
“You didn’t,” John said in that same, quiet voice. “I’m here. And I always will be.”
Sherlock didn’t acknowledge it, too deep in his mind palace. He hadn’t been sure of what to expect when he’d arrived at the funeral. He had no way of knowing just how utterly painful it would be. He took a shaky breath and envisioned John’s pain-wracked face. He had caused that. He was the reason John even had to attend the funeral. He should have immediately arrested Norbury, should have done something, anything to avoid her shooting at him.
“The pool. When Moriarty was going to blow you up. I looked at you and I thought that was it. I was about to lose the best thing that ever happened to me. And then, belatedly, I realised that you were the best thing that ever happened to me, which was mildly alarming.”
John’s sobs slowly dwindled until all that was left was quiet sniffling. Eventually, he moved away from the window. Sherlock turned to look at him. “Sherlock?”
John wouldn’t want him here, but his desire to see John was too strong. He needed John, needed him almost as much as he had craved cocaine. Hence why he was standing in front of the church. His plan was a good one. Arrive late, leave early. Stand by the door. Pay your respects to Mary, apologise silently. Make sure John was alive. Make sure he’s doing okay, or at least as okay as could be expected. Let no one see him. And then leave.
He couldn’t say any of that. He opened his mouth, intending to make a joke - maybe telling John that Sherlock is actually a girl’s name - but John interrupted him.
“I won’t,” Sherlock said.
The sun gradually set and dipped below the horizon. Across the water, lights flickered on in the buildings. When they passed a bridge, Sherlock saw the lights from cars. He privately thought that none of those people were as lucky as he was. He was incredibly lucky. John was with him. John wasn’t alone in his flat. John wasn’t with Mary. John wasn’t drinking alcohol in some pub. John was here, with him, and he was happy.
Sherlock had asked. John replied,
The park was near-empty, families inside celebrating with each other. Sherlock’s breath steamed in the chilly air, reminding him of a cigarette. His fingers twitched. He’d been doing better recently. Of course, he still woke up in cold sweat, body aching for drugs, but that was happening less and less recently. Distractions were good.
“She took a bullet for me,” Sherlock pointed out.
Finally he gave up, sinking into his bed, and was asleep within minutes. Normally Sherlock didn’t sleep. Sleeping was boring. But he had been out on a case with Lestrade for the past few nights, barely sleeping, and for once he was exhausted.
John grasped his hand again. After a moment, Sherlock folded his fingers over John’s, returning the sentiment. “It’s not your fault. I promise. I know I keep saying that, but I’m going to keep reminding you until you finally believe it. Mary made a choice.”
“You-utter-” John couldn’t even manage to form words. So he kissed Sherlock.
John glanced up at him when he reentered the sitting room. “Okay, Sherlock.”
Sherlock thought back to their conversation. Somehow, he ended up in Battersea Park, looking at the Thames. His walk took less than an hour, so the darkness hadn’t begun to fade yet.
“You’re here now,” Sherlock said. “And I’m clean. I want to be clean. I don’t want to go through that again.”
“It’s about Sherlock.”
“No.” John cleared his throat and took Sherlock’s hands. Sherlock intertwined their fingers together. “I understand. I do. I just don’t like it, because I cared about you immensely, and then you were gone.”
“Hmm?” Sherlock was too busy admiring their work to register that John was speaking to him.
