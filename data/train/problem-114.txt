could someone like him do? What kind of standard nine-to-five employment could possibly keep him interested and occupied? Practising medicine didn’t hold any appeal at all, and he didn’t feel like hunting the private security sector for work. Wasn’t he better than paid muscle?
Ten minutes later, a black government car pulled up outside the pub and two people got out, the driver and Mycroft’s long-time aide A. John gave A the keys to Lestrade’s car as the driver held the door for them.
Judith couldn't help making comparisons again between Stephen and Sherlock. They were the same height, the only difference between them was their accents, hair-styles, and what they did for a living. They both had a fondness for dramatics, and slightly ridiculous clothing choices. They could talk faster than most people processed a single thought, and were both much smarter than anyone deserved to be. Reckless, careless, but aware of their loved ones. She was pulled from her train of thought by a soft metallic clatter. Stephen had found her id-tags. He read them to himself, smiling.
“No, ma’am. We’ve been on this case the past two months or so.” John patted his leg and the dogs followed him out to the sitting-room. The woman introduced herself as Mrs Michaels and warmed up
“It’s a gift of sorts.” Will got down from the truck and turned to help her down, “You don’t seem to mind.”
“A roof over your head, a real bed, hell, I’ll throw in dinner and drinks to sweeten the deal.” He tapped the fingers of his right hand against the roof of his car, “Can’t have the likes of you sleeping on London’s streets tonight. Shabby home-coming for a soldier with your history. Damn hero you are.”
“I should go home. I need sleep.” She muttered as she crossed the street. She had never seen anyone come or go from this place, having spent time watching it on CCTV camera. Looking over her shoulder, she glimpsed one of the cameras fixed on this building, and waved. She doubted anyone was watching, but the recorded footage would show her going inside. If anyone was home, that was. As she knocked on the door, it popped open.
“Nice touch, this: the pool where little Carl died. I stopped him.” She tried not to cringe as she listened to the next words. “I can stop Judith Watson too.” She looked down at the laser point on her chest. “Stop her heart.”
you didn’t tell me anything, but a hint would have made all the bloody difference in the world so I didn’t have to find out the hard way two years later when I found myself in Pakistan tracking down a rogue agent who had gone off-radar and wasn’t making his check-ins.” John smirked, “And I thought James Bond was a proper menace.”
“Who are you?” Greg demanded loudly. A door opened at the far end of the pool and a soft male voice with an Irish accent spoke from that direction, drawing their attention away from Judith.
“He’s a friend and a resource if we need anything.” John leant his head back, a familiar posture of exhaustion. Sherlock took his hand and got him off the couch. Without a word, they went back to the bedroom and after making sure the flat was shut down, banking the fire and turning off the music-player, closed and locked the bedroom door. It was normal and familiar to brush his teeth next to John, who pushed him out to do his business before taking one side of the bed.
“Everyone.” Jim’s smile was delighted and sickening. “Three bullets; three gunmen; three victims. There’s no stopping them now.” Furious, Sherlock pulled Jim back upwards to safety. Jim stared into his face.
“Yes, I know.” A falter, a crack in the armour, “I was there that day, I know. You seem to take delight in reminding me. Sherlock may be dead, but he does not deserve to be treated the way he has been. Dead or alive, he deserves dignity. I know how hard Greg Lestrade is working to clear his name, and I’ve helped him. And don’t forget what I did to Moriarty. I’m not an idiot, Mr Holmes. There is nothing I despise more than being treated as one, and being lied to. You’ve already made me well-aware of your thoughts on my keeping company with your brother, you always thought he could do better, you told him to keep me out of the loop when this happened. Not to protect me, no, to get rid of me.”
Oh God he was drunk. But it wasn’t just alcohol making him light-headed. Judith was lost in the rhythm of her dance, eyes closed, head tilted back as she swayed and gyrated to the music. He might as well have been the only person in the restaurant for all that he paid not a whit of attention to anyone or anything else. He heard his table-mates murmuring appreciatively, chuckling at the expense of their unfortunate mates who weren’t really doing that poorly, and felt a bit heartbroken when the dancers vanished backstage after an enthuastic ovation from their enthralled audience, until remembering that he got to take his home.
“And then, together, we take our medicine.” He smiled and licked his lips expectantly, “Let’s play.”
Mycroft had memorized their medical records and all relevant information shortly after coming into a position where he could access those records, and wondered if having similar fingerprints had ever been an issue for them. Without much of a history of trouble with the law, it was unlikely, but it would no doubt raise a few eyebrows when people figured out that they shared the same DNA and the fingerprint on the index and thumb of their left hands. By some luck of genetics, the Watson twins had ducked a common condition among mirror twins known as situs inversus and were two of the healthiest people he knew of, John’s discharge injury aside. And even that hadn’t
“Not really.” Donovan shook her head, “He’s arrogant, more than a bit stupid, and won’t shut up half the time.”
“Hey, get home safe, you two, alright?” She warned, looking them over, “Didn’t drink enough for a hangover tonight, good for you.”
“It serves it’s purposes.” He smiled at them over the top of his laptop, his face lit in the blue glow of the screen, “I have information for you, Miss Watson.”
“Just trying to keep the peace and keep the people safe.” She repressed an urge to shudder as she shook hands with him, “Well, I’ll let you get on your way, then.”
At the moment, however, the only threat he posed was that of complete distraction from duty and her business with Sherlock.
“John, get her inside.” Judith put herself between her brother’s landlady and the ladder, “I’ll take care of this one.” She slid on her sling-ring and opened a sling-portal onto the slopes of Mount Everest. Before the assassin could react, she shoved her full weight against the ladder and toppled it. He pitched through the portal into the snow-field on the other side and she sealed the portal before he hit the ground. The ladder crashed against the wall, but that was one threat minimized. Her radio squawked and she took a frantic call from Sally.
John and The Ancient One joined them after breakfast, and Judith began a training-period that lasted all of the following two months. She spent weekends on-site at Kamar-Taj on intense training, and during the week at the London Sanctum between shifts at work. She never let on what she was doing, and Greg knew better than to ask. Now that she had tapped into a world of magic and tapped into powers beyond imagining, harnessing that power with help from unlikely allies, she started seeing little hints of it everywhere.
“I don’t suppose you remember this lovely number?” Q pulled the tarp off with a flourish, beaming and so pleased with himself. James Bond’s Aston Martin DB5 was Q-Branch legend, but John had a special place in his heart for a particular BMW 4 Series 2.0 428i two-door coupe, painted an eye-catching shade of red with all standard bells and whistles and then a few special Q-Branch extras that made it one of the most high-tech cars on the roads. Most of those after-market upgrades were more recent, part of routine maintenance as well as post-mission repairs.
“Nothing extra for you.” Magnus’s smile widened a bit and he worried his lip for a moment. He had the chance to personalize these rings. But what on earth would he put down?
flashy. He wanted to give her a ring she could wear all the time. The band had a mate, part of a his-hers set, and a quick check of the sizes had him wondering if his luck was
“Being rude doesn’t make people like you very much I’m afraid, Mr Anderson,” John said, getting carefully to his feet.
“Where would I live, Mike?” He huffed. “I couldn’t afford to stay in London more than a few months if I moved out of Agency housing.”
did. Told Mike Stamford just this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for.” That got a smile of sorts out of Sherlock, who accepted the offer of the lighter and John touched the flame to the end of the cigarette now between his shapely lips. “Then he comes back with an old friend, clearly just out from government service, and prior military service in Afghanistan. Wasn’t that difficult a leap.”
doesn’t want it to change. All I did was give her a choice, she said yes to it, but she is allowed to change her mind. She’s too important to me for that kind of thing to turn us over.”
“Roger that.” John adjusted the FLIR cameras and saw a mass of red and yellow moving across the blue. It had snowed here recently, so the mass of…something was very obvious. Dogs. He felt a stab of sheer relief, “Good eye, Sherlock! That’s them!”
“No, no, no. I’m smarter than that, more clever.” He smiled at John, “I take the cases no one else will bother with and I help The Met when they need me. Which is always, as they’re all a bunch of idiots.”
“Enough I know how to handle it. Get on the other side of the bed.” Sherlock peeked over the edge of the mattress, and they watched her brother’s shaking form. “Go.” She got to the corner of the bed before she had to stop.
“Oh, look at that. It has. Well, welcome to London!” John collected his few things and squinted at the sky, “I don’t suppose Mrs Hudson knows you’re alive, does she?”
idea, their words that were circulating in The Met. If friends were the first ones to say it was all a conspiracy, that Sherlock Holmes was a true psychopath and a dangerous liability, it would be better for him.
“If there’s one thing you should remember about me, Mycroft, it’s that I learned from observing. I saw, I observed, I learned. I’ve been gone for a week? Dodging your cameras is child’s play for me these days.” He leant across the desk, “I’ll disappear, and you won’t find me. Ever. Until I want to be found.”
threat beyond this to the people of London, we need to know.” Greg stood behind Judith, “We need his name, so that we can keep an eye out on him.”
“Well, that’s just it, then, isn’t it?” Mycroft shook his head and looked at the image frozen on his screen, unable to help a smile. “I suppose I shall have to once again get him out of difficulties.” He would give John a few hours to cool his head before springing him from Holding, and wondered for a moment if his husband had even recognized John. The two had met once, years ago, but he wasn’t certain if either had recognized the other tonight. Not likely, judging by the footage.
“Brave man you are.” He took a gulp of beer as Judith reached them. Without a word, she took Greg’s glass and emptied it, setting it on the bar-top and signalling for another.
“Not gonna happen.” Her brother muttered. They caught Sherlock with the safety-net of magic and lowered him to solid ground. The spells wrapped in around the troubled, disgraced consulting detective, and disappeared as soon as his head touched concrete. He was unconscious, and when they missed his pulse, John freaked out a bit. But cooler heads prevailed and Stephen took his pulse in his left wrist instead. He was alive but very death-like. A team of agents from Sherlock’s network disguised as hospital staff emerged and shuffled him off to the morgue.
“When I’m at home in London, I usually go for a run before work.” She slipped on a pair of flats and followed him out of the room, “That’s not an option here.”
“Not quite. Most of the trip will be taken in jeeps, but we carry everything with us.” She headed for the line of armoured trucks, “Here’s a quick prayer that nobody lined the route with mines.”
“Oh. Well, to be honest, I didn’t really have much to do with him once I thought it might not be such a bad idea to take his too-good-to-refuse offer.”
Returning to Dartmoor the following afternoon, she caught up with John and Sherlock laying out their plans with Greg to find out once and for all what was running around the moors after dark. Those plans were cut a bit short when Doctor Mortimer called in a panic to tell them that Henry Knight had taken his pistol and disappeared. She was afraid he was going to try to kill himself or someone else. They tracked Henry to Dewer’s Hollow, where they managed to talk him down from killing himself, but found themselves in serious trouble when the Hound appeared to them.
“He's done nothing wrong, you don't have any business here to arrest him.” This was to the very confused, very angry Fey representing The Met. “You absolutely have no right to do it!”
“I’m not very good at people, but you…stayed. You kept staying, you didn’t leave, and when I lied to you and didn’t deserve forgiveness, you forgave me for lying to you for our sakes, my sake, and hurting you like you never deserved to be hurt,” Sherlock looked out the window for a moment, collecting his thoughts, “Then you came and found me and put me right again and helped me. I never wanted to ask you to do that, I never wanted you to give up the chance of a normal, happy life.”
“Not a pleasant one. Keep me informed of Harry’s condition, please?” He went back into the waiting-room, “I’d love to nail a homicide charge on Beverley Watson’s sorry arse.”
“I’ll introduce you to Doctor Hooper first, she’ll be in her office right now,” Mike said in the lift.
“Oh, that’s, uh, that’s Henry Knight’s psychologist.” He studied the image, taken inside the dining room, “What’s she doing here?”
“Not exactly a state secret, Greg.” He rolled his eyes. He was never going to live that down, was he? It was always something, as Sherlock was so fond of saying.
Mycroft peeled off to go hunt down her commanders, but Sherlock followed her like a loyal dog. Several men they passed on their way between the helipad and the med facility recognised Sherlock from other visits and were happy to greet him.
“Yeah. Ta.” He huffed, shaking his head. Once inside the office, he made sure to close the door behind him.
“I happen to be very good at quieting a hyper mind. Seb knows that. And you’re very much like him, I see why he’s so
As he had suspected, he didn’t find anything at the small shop, but word had gotten around fast and the store-clerk passed him a card. It led him to a shop in Spanish Town, on the south end of the island. One of the water-sports instructors, a local islander, had heard about his troubles and offered to give him a ride down to Spanish Town on his ferry, which he ran on an as-needed basis. And Greg was much in need. He checked his watch and marked the time. Judith was still in class.
“Oh, Sherlock.” She knew all about the Fey Courts, the different sorts of Fey creatures that roamed London, the UK, and the world. “The both of you?”
“That’s alright, Mrs. Hudson. We’ll wait for them to come back.” Greg just smiled at the kind landlady. They cleared the seventeen steps to 221B and searched the flat. Not that they had to look very far, a pink overnight case sat open on the coffee-table.
it was. But whatever he had said to Judith, it had an effect none of them had been able to get out of her.
changed, he would know. Sure enough, his posture changed, stiffened, and she waited for his eyes to open. Judith smiled and touched his hair, tapping his temple. When he moved his head, she let her fingers slide down along his cheek and jawline, noticing the stubble there.
“Anytime, Sergeant Donovan, will be my pleasure.” Sherlock said with a flirty smile he saved for a few people, “You know the drill, love.”
Judith had no idea how long it had been since the incident at Camden Sports Center, but she did not wake up alone once she regained awareness of the physical world. Trying to protect herself after the stand-off at the pool, she had taken refuge in her mind. Stephen Strange had come to London for the sole purpose of pulling her back to the physical world, and she was grateful for that. When she resurfaced to the sound of steady, strident beeping, she knew she was in a hospital. She remembered Stephen telling her that. Judith forced her eyes open, blinking into dim low-light. After-hours, well after visiting-hours for certain, but she wasn’t alone in the private hospital room. It wasn’t John, or Sherlock, or Strange at her bedside. It was Greg. He looked terrible, like he hadn’t slept in weeks. How long had she been out? Judith moved fingers, toes, stretched stiff muscles, and contemplated waking Greg up. But he looked peaceful in his sleep, she didn’t really want to disturb him. But this was someone used to sharing the same bed with her, attuned to her every nocturnal twitch and shuffle. He would be on hair-trigger alert. If her
Mycroft letting her live was a bad idea, no matter how “harmless” she was, how inhibited she was. How secure her cell was.” It was clear there was no love lost between Lestrade and his late sister-in-law, but it was also clear that he had no idea that Eurus Holmes was dead and had been since just shortly after the East Wind Incident. John finished his beer and set the empty glass down carefully.
But, as they neared their destination, Stamford gave him a few more particulars about the young man.
“Brought you a little getting-to-know-you present,” Sherlock called out, announcing himself. “Oh, that’s what it’s all been for, hasn’t it? All your little puzzles; making me dance – all to distract me from
“I’m not like most of the students at Kamar-Taj, you know that.” She leaned her head back, “Took you three minutes this time. You’re getting faster.”
, and she wondered when John had found the time to go back to London and bring it through, or if he’d stopped by the flat and grabbed it
Judith was aware of Lestrade talking on the phone with someone, and tuned in on the conversation. She’d deduced a few things about him before. Judith knew that he was in a loveless relationship with a woman he had been married to for almost sixteen years, a dedicated man to his work and desperate to leave a good mark on the world. He was smarter than people gave him credit for, not a genius on the level of the Holmes brothers but smart enough to get through above average, careful in all things, a dual-citizen of the British Empire with family in France, in the LaBarre wine region, and spoke French fluently, mostly when he was under stress. He played acoustic guitar and liked to compose his own music. Along with speaking French, he spoke Arabic and Russian. He had taught himself the languages, spending time in each of the places that spoke them, and mastering a native fluency in each.
Yes, Moriarty's goons took Judith! No, he is NOT pleased, and neither is Judith. Come to think of it, I doubt ANYONE is thrilled about it. Wrong Watson, you morons! But, that was a dummy-vest, so maybe not too bad? But then we get a reminder that Jim Moriarty is always going to be a charming, sick, twisted psychopath no matter how fond of someone he might be.
“Miss Riley, open this door or it’s coming down! Open the door right now!” The door was pulled open by Kitty Riley, who took one look at them and frowned at them.
“Good evening, Mr Moriarty! It’s a pleasure to have you tonight! Can I get you something to start while you go over the menu, sir?” He might not like the prick, but he could be nice.
“With you, it’s ... I don’t know why it was so different.” Sherlock looked at him, “You didn’t ... ”
“Oh.” Sherlock’s eyes widened and his expression faltered. “John, I ... I didn’t know, I’m so sorry.”
“Yes, of course, I remember.” He said as he studied the car, circling it carefully as he touched the paint-job and chrome trim.
“I’m not stupid, Sherlock.” John’s voice was equally soft as he produced from his pockets an unopened pack of Lucky Strikes and a lighter. He ripped the cellophane off with his teeth and flicked the lid up with his thumb as Sherlock quietly took the wrapping from him and stuffed it into a pocket.
“It took far too much effort, consider yourself fortunate I cared enough to spend the time and effort to even bother.”
“Without getting a gun pointed at my head or elsewhere more delicate?” John tapped his knuckles against the cool reinforced glass of the window. “I’m the one who picked and trained Annalise Mackenzie from a pool of MI6 agents. She had the qualities I was looking for.”
“Oh, no you don’t.” John looked over his shoulder at Sherlock, eyes narrow, “I’ve been as many unspeakable places as you have in five years, Sherlock.”
“I got this.” He pulled the door open as she handed over his wallet from her waist-belt, “Thank you, dear.” She slid in behind him and waited near the door while he got into line. It was seven-fifteen, but even the early crowd wasn’t too terrible. When he got to the front of the line, he placed an order for two egg-and-bacon breakfast sandwiches and two mochaccinos for take-away and paid the girl behind the counter.
“No, you didn’t. To your credit.” Greg smirked. “I don’t suppose I could convince you to stick around at Gabriel’s Wharf, could I?”
“It’s a food-and-water run to the village of Maysarouz, about ten miles from here.” She sighed, hung the log back in its place, waved to the congregating soldiers, and went for her gear. Will continued to follow her as she got ready for the upcoming patrol. He watched her don different pieces of body-armor and the way his eyes widened when she picked up the patrol-pack was almost funny. She looked up at him and raised an eyebrow, “What?”
As they drove back to the Tesco, he looked through the wallet again, sliding the license out of its slot to look at it more closely.
Sherlock shoved him further back, now holding him over the edge. Jim whooped almost triumphantly and gazed back at him with no fear in his eyes, holding his hands out wide and committing himself to Sherlock’s grasp. This man was completely mad!
live by myself. I’m a terrible person, my habits are unspeakable, and forget being acceptable nice to people if I don’t feel up to behaving myself.”
After she was done eating, she binned her trash and went upstairs. He heard the shower run and wondered. It was his day off, but he was still a DI of New Scotland Yard’s Homicide and Major Crimes division. Going upstairs to his bedroom, Greg took a fast shower and got dressed before he placed a call to work.
He raised his eyes to Sherlock’s, grinned manically, and pulled Sherlock closer while he reached into his waistband. It didn’t occur to him how much trouble he was actually in until Jim shoved the barrel of a pistol into his mouth with his free hand and went to pull the trigger on himself. Shock settled in, followed by panic. Sherlock’s brain had shut down and he reacted on sheer instinct. Grabbing Moriarty by the hand, he pulled hard, fighting for control of the gun. The gun discharged between them, he felt a sharp pain in his chest. Adrenaline guided his body and he used his falling weight against Moriarty. There was a struggle, a release, and a yell. Sherlock didn’t feel anything when he hit the pavement. The broken body of Jim Moriarty broke some of his fall, but he was already dead by the time they landed. That sort of thing happened if you managed to get shot in the heart trying to be a hero.
! There’s more than just friends between them. I ain’t blind, and I ain’t stupid.” He looked over at John, who couldn't seem to decide if he wanted to punch Hope or kill him, and winked. Then he turned back to Judith.
“Isn’t she sweet? I can see why you like having her around.” Jim quirked an eyebrow, “But then people do get so sentimental about their pets.” Grimacing, Judith pulled him even closer, the bomb now sandwiched between them. Jim scowled at her.
With Sherlock Holmes in tow, Judith walked out of her office for the last time, or one of the last times. She walked back to her barracks-room and went through her shelves and drawers, packing up everything into a few bags. She tossed uniform pieces into the bags, wondering what kind of future awaited her in London with Sherlock Holmes. While she packed, Sherlock stripped her bunk and stacked fresh linens on the mattress.
“Yep. Kind of kidnapped John and me one summer, spent four weeks down here, it was amazing!” She bounced in her seat a bit, “We explored Virgin Gorda, the lower bit of it, but we visited this resort a couple of times. I’m fairly certain it’s changed, and help me if anyone here remembers! I only came that once!”
like John. The man with his back to Sherlock had very short hair, just shy of a buzz-cut, that was some vague shade of greyish blond, and in spite of the cool night wore no jacket. He wore denims that had seen much wear, these tucked into a pair of sturdy black tank-boots, a black cut-off denim jacket over a white vest and a pair of red suspenders. Sherlock could see trails of ink on the man’s arms and realized they were tattoos. He had seen John in all manner of undress and had
Mycroft Holmes.” Barrymore sneered, completely unaware of Judith’s presence on-base. This might actually be a bit of fun.
“John?” He spoke his mate’s name carefully.  Had he finally given up trying to hold his emotions in check? He had been so close at the scene, but he had managed to hold himself together. Sherlock got slowly to his feet, followed in turn by Mycroft and Greg, who traded a slightly guilty look with each other.
well, across the sidewalk to the front door, using the detective’s key to get into the house, and looked around a bit before going inside. He didn’t seem to notice them, or care if he did.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock asked softly, not wanting to disturb the peace that had settled between them like it hadn’t been five long, miserable years for both of them, like Sherlock hadn’t risked his life and nearly died more times than he cared to remember, like John hadn’t gotten married in what had turned out to be one of the most disastrous mistakes of
“Just look at me for a minute.” He waited for the petulant young detective to turn around and look at him, which he did eventually. John was ready when he finally turned his head and cut off his objection with a well-timed kiss.
“Well, if we’re doing this, we’re doing this properly.” John framed that unusual face with both hands, “I would love nothing more than to give you everything you want, but I want to do it properly. Safely.”
It took about thirty minutes to get home, and she got the cats situated in the store-closet where she found everything they needed for short- or long-term. It had only been a few hours, but there was a pet-flap in the door that allowed access in and out of the closet, but the kittens would be contained in a crate for the most part.
“Hello? Met Police, is anyone here?” Getting no response, and feeling very much like this was some weird out-of-body experience, Judith climbed the impressive staircase that led to the first floor. She still didn’t encounter anyone, but this house reminded her of a museum. A very
And that was the last he heard before the dial-tone buzzed in his ear. Confident that he was completely alone, Sherlock put both hands to his face and sobbed. It was adrenaline, fear, and ultimately relief. But he had no control over his emotions right now, and he couldn’t be bothered to care.
“One of Her Majesty’s Secret Service.” John straightened and went to hang up his towels, “Trust me, Sherlock, it’s exactly what you think.”
“Chief says we’ve got a lock on Miss DeVil. You two called it in, if you want in on it, you can go.”
“He’s into banking now, but not very good at it.” Sherlock looked at him, his eyes wide and wet. “I wasn’t very ... popular in uni, John, I was ... too smart, too strange. I was The Freak, I always have been.”
“Considering how much trouble I’m going to be in when this gets back to my commanders?” She rubbed the back of her neck, “Jesus, I’m so sorry.”
When they got to Baker Street, he let John worry about getting the door open and paid the fare, making sure to tip the driver. The house was dark and warm and it smelled like home. A bit musty, but it was home enough for his transient soul. Closing the door, he locked it and leaned his head back.
“I think I’ll be a bit worried. Well, this is my stop, gentlemen.” Judith got up as the train slowed to a halt and the recorded voice announced their stop, heading for the opening doors. She had a short, six-minute walk from Barbican Station to Saint Bart’s Hospital. Her phone buzzed in her pocket, a message from Sherlock.
“You do, because I said so, and you’re far too skinny to do without. Now up.” He got out of bed and found his pyjamas from last night. “Shower first.”
“Dogs are smart. I heard the Barking Chain the last couple of days, so I know word got where it needed to.” John smiled and squeezed Mrs Radcliffe’s hand, “They have channels of communication just like we do.”
“And for Lord's sakes, take a shower! Please!” She called up as they ran up the seventeen familiar stairs, “Both of you, my goodness! Pair of rightful hooligans!”
“It’s always something.” He looked over his shoulder at Sherlock, who had slid the door open and hooked into a roll-bar to sit in the door and scan the darkness that way, “It was never important to our work, was it?”
“Mm, more like there are a few people in MI6 who would rather I didn’t have to worry about the hassle if I get stopped carrying my service-weapon.” She smirked, “Figured me out yet, Mr Holmes?”
“Scared the socks off of one poor constable who wasn’t paying attention when she suddenly moved.” Greg smiled, “Get on with you, and don’t worry about Anderson.”
As he pushed the door open, a uniformed constable behind him to help with the arrest, he pocketed his phone. Time to put a spiteful, hateful woman away for good.
“Jesus. Between that flight, the food, the alcohol, and the dancing, I regret nothing, but my body is going to hate me in a few hours.” She groaned, rubbing at the back of her head, “What’s the time?”
“I’ll do my damn best to make sure no one ever hurts you again. And if someone does, I’ll make ‘em properly sorry for it.” John took his hand, “I promise.” That was all he could really ask for. Sherlock remembered what had happened earlier and wondered how long it would take for his brother to eliminate Moriarty properly.
Sherlock Holmes stood face-to-face with the only man who had ever given him a reason to worry about himself or any of his loved ones. Jim Moriarty was everything he could be without friends. That scared him. In a sudden movement, Sherlock grabbed him by the collar of his coat with both hands and spun him around so that Jim’s back was to the drop. He stared into his face and then shoved him back one step nearer the edge. Jim looked at him with interest as Sherlock’s breathing became shorter.
interested in a bit more than that. Not that he was going to jump that on Sherlock right out of the gate, of course, he wasn’t even sure where the man stood on romantic relationships.
It was mostly his fault, and Sherlock was man enough to admit it. He knew how poorly John had handled his “death”, and how badly he had underestimated the loyal man who had done everything for Sherlock and would have done more if only he had trusted him. But he hadn’t, because he wanted to keep John safe. So, he had watched, from a near distance, grieving as John moved on without him. He had a girlfriend, he proposed to her the very night Sherlock had intended to reveal himself. He hadn’t, in the end. And then John had gotten married. But it hadn’t been a happy marriage, and Sherlock could tell that John was bored.
“Mm.” He raised an eyebrow, “You bothered your landlady before eight in the morning? Sherlock Holmes, you scoundrel.”
“Your Majesty.” His brother was the first to genuflect, the rest of them followed suit. John dropped to one knee less than an arm’s reach from the small, powerful woman with his eyes.
“Yes he is, poor woman. But she’s as much an idiot as he is, so I don’t feel too bad. They’re kind of perfect for each other.”
She remembered to breathe a split-second before his lips touched hers in something slow and frantic all at once that tasted like toothpaste. They hadn’t eaten today, but she detected a hint of curry. Probably from yesterday’s lunch? A door opening downstairs broke the moment, and Judith caught her breath again.
“Sherlock!” John yelled, one hand outstretched as if that would be enough to stop time. Stephen stopped time for them just before Sherlock took that fatal final step off the ledge, and they set up a series of spells to break his fall. Even
“A little.” Greg turned his head and noticed that they had stopped outside of a little cafe called Cafe de Fred, which he recalled as having rather excellent breakfast sandwhiches. He raised an eyebrow and turned to Judith, who was looking up at the sign like it was the gates of Heaven. Neither of them were fit to eat in, but this place did take-away and the line inside was kind of short. Greg looked at Judith and smiled, “Hungry?”
about it.” He got a dirty look for that and he chuckled. Worth it to at least ask, wasn’t it? And if John decided he wanted to take Sherlock home, wherever that happened to be, Sherlock was not going to turn him down. Just this was fine, chatting over drinks and cigarettes, but he was not against more. He was not against spending the fading hours of the night in John Watson’s bed.
“Uh. Well, n-not ... not exactly. I’m ... so sorry, I didn’t mean to barge in on you like this, I’ll just ... ” Christ, was he really acting like a flustered teenager?
“I’ve been up since half-three. I figured once it got a bit later, I’d run Hyde Park.” She finished the juice and rinsed the glass out in the sink before setting it on the side-board rack to dry. He watched her tuck the water-bottle into her waistbelt. The zip-compartment held her wallet and phone, with room for keys.
“No, I want to see her.” John shook his head, “But I’m in no condition to drive, I shouldn’t have tried driving down here in the first place.”
“Figured you would, seeing you were this close anyway.” Lestrade smiled and showed them where to leave their coats, if they’d like to. But neither John nor Sherlock were about to leave their coats unattended. Bad things happened when you did that, and Sherlock had just gotten his
“Bets on who that is?” He muttered. If it wasn’t Mary, he’d be absolutely shocked. Sure enough, it was his wife. He sighed and swiped into the call after Hutchison gave him a connector to plug into his phone that was attached to a recorder.
that eager to face DeVil again, but he wanted to put eyes on her and make sure she ended up in handcuffs. “You got her associates?”
“Beth Davenport. She was reported missing earlier tonight after she went missing from a fundraiser.” Judith looked at her brother, “Looks like another suicide.”
“So, up for a longer run, old man?” Judith handed him the waterbottle, and he took it with a roll of his eyes.
“I think it did? I honestly don’t know. I lost touch for a few years while I was with the Army.” She headed for the shower, “And I searched that flat from top to bottom last time I was over, didn’t find anything.” And she had looked in every possible hiding-spot, including a few clever ones Mycroft had warned her about. She’d done the search while Sherlock had been out on a case, left absolutely no trace of her search, and reported back all-clear when she was done.
“Upstairs. Can’t make heads or tails of it, I was kind of hoping you might be able to.” Lestrade showed them where the bodies had been found and gave them everything he already had on it.   Sherlock did a bit of his usual showing off, and about halfway through a rant about how it was both a double-homicide and a murder-suicide (and oh boy did Lestrade give him a look for that one), he was distracted by a soft exclamation from off to his left.
“Send ‘em to boot if that’s what you think will do the trick.” John said around a sip of his drink, “I won’t just scare ‘em, Mike, I’m just as likely to kill one of them for being a mouthy fucker.”
hard to miss Sherlock Holmes. The young detective didn’t seem to have spotted him, but John wasn’t exactly standing out in the crowds tonight. He wore nondescript clothes and had his head down. To anyone else, it looked like he was minding his own business, busy on his phone. He wore a pair of ear-buds to add to the illusion, but he was absolutely paying attention. So when Sherlock paused nearby to him, looking at something on his phone, John lifted his head to study the young man. What was he doing down here? At nine o’clock on a Wednesday night? Sherlock never turned his way, so he wasn’t sure he’d been noticed, but John didn’t move an inch until Sherlock had moved on. Just before he disappeared from sight, John moved. It didn’t take long to catch up with him, though he was thrown twice and got completely turned around once.
“You’re smart, Donovan. And surprisingly open with a stranger.” She reached over and squeezed the fingers clenching the steering-wheel so tightly they were turning white, “You didn’t mean to tell me everything, did you?”
“I’m not stupid, Mary. I know Rosie’s not my daughter. And I know you tried to kill Sherlock twice.”
“Phew.” Greg shook his head grimly, “Ah, ta.” He took one of three cups from Mycroft, who set another beside Judith.
?” Sally pointed at someone coming up the street towards Riley’s apartment and passed over a pair of binoculars, “Am I imagining this or is
“He was my best friend. Saved m’life, that one, didn’t know he’d done it, neither. Never said it, didn’t want to.”
Bryan returned a few minutes later with their drinks and bread, and they ordered for their meal when asked if they were ready. John decided on a baked heritage beetroot & whipped goats cheese salad with chicory and roasted almond pesto for a starter and roasted stone bass with pomme mousseline, foraged sea herbs, and Champagne beurre blanc with a side of roasted Heritage carrots, almonds & coriander for his entrée, while Mycroft elected for the celeriac velouté with trompette mushroom and black truffle for
The highlight of the evening was watching the belly-dancers who entertained the customers. Judith recalled from past visits that occasionally, the dancers would pull people out of the crowds to perform with them, and had always enjoyed watching a few caught off guard as they floundered and did their damn best to follow the motions of the far more skilled dancers. Judith leant back against the wall, taking a sly sip of her beer. If she was a bit braver, she would raise a hand for a go on that stage. She had taken lessons from a couple of local girls at a pleasure-house back in Afghanistan, all done in secret, but for someone with body dysphoria, it was something that had made her feel legitimately beautiful.
“Ah, there you are.” He smiled and took a sip of tea after fixing it his preferred way. For this, he had to displace Kitty, who made a disgruntled noise as she hit the floor on all fours. Tail flicking in annoyance, she stalked across the room again towards the grey chair and John watched carefully as she sat on the floor by Sherlock’s feet and stared up at the tall young detective, who stared right back.
“Of course, little brother.” Mycroft’s touch was gentle and soothing and he calmed down slowly, shivering in his brother’s arms and uncaring of the indignation of sitting on his floor in tears, crying like a child. But no one in this house would judge him. Mycroft stroked his hair, humming some obscure lullaby from forgotten days until he was nearly asleep.
be a cousin, but you’re a war hero who can’t find a place to live. Unlikely you’ve got an extended family, certainly not one you’re close to, so brother it is.” Sherlock said as he inspected the personalized engraving. “Now, Clara. Who’s Clara? Three kisses says it’s a romantic attachment. The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend. She must have given it to him quite a while ago – this model was only six months old at the time she would have given it to him, but it’s four years old by now. Marriage in trouble then – six months on he’d just given it away. If she’d left
in tears, and a great weight had gone from his shoulders. Kissing her had always felt right, felt natural, and now he got to do it whenever he wanted to, anywhere he wanted to. Now that she was a Detective Sergeant, and well on her way to taking a new name if she wanted it, he could do just about anything he damn well pleased. And thank you.
“Work?” Sherlock finished rinsing off, noticing that he would now smell like John’s body wash. Something cheap and neutral but so very familiar.
“If we don't get on it will be easy to part company. It seems to me that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter.” John said quietly, “Is this bloke's temper so formidable, or what is it? Don't be modest about it.”
“Mmhm. We’ll see about that.” Pushing the door open with her foot, she stepped into the living-room. “Step out, please, and don’t cause a scene.”
“Sherlock! Sherlock!” The clever, manipulative púca burst into view at the top of the stairs, came to a dead halt at the sight of Lestrade and Alexandra, “Oh, thank goodness! I saw the cars and thought you were being arrested for something! Are you alright?” Before any of them could stop him, Moriarty had closed the distance between himself and Sherlock and seized him by the hands. Sherlock was aware of how his mate bristled when Moriarty laid hand on him.
“God, you’re a menace!” He groaned, covering his face with both hands. The guys were chuckling and someone wolf-whistled, which had poor Will turning bright red. Judith pulled his hands away and kissed him on the cheek.
“No one does, I did all of that against orders. Nearly got myself booted for it, too, but Mycroft’s superiors stepped in on my behalf. I don’t know who said what, but whatever they said scared my commanders straight and I didn’t have any trouble. Got off easy for what I did, knew it, too.”
“Oh, my son.” Her voice was soft, hoarse with time and trials, but still held a mother’s comfort, “My beautiful son.” Sherlock watched elegant fingers scarred and toughened by toil stroke through strands of hair the same colour as John’s pelt. Sherlock would never get used to the tinges of black and green in his mate’s hair, it was like nothing he had ever seen before and it was so completely unique to John. A soft sound broke the quiet in the room and Sherlock realized it was coming from John.
When he found himself in the back of a car after having his rights read to him, he didn’t dare breathe a sigh of relief. But when minutes passed and no one else was put into the car next to him, he began to wonder. The man who had arrested him stood just outside the car, leaning against it as he made a phone call to someone. The window was open just a bit and John could hear every word.
It didn’t take long for the place to be swarming with pups of all sizes and ages. John rounded up the Radcliffe dogs and got them settled safely, doing a headcount. Two adults and…fourteen pups. They were missing one. They called in a hundred dogs before the missing pup arrived last, making it a hundred and
As soon as that lot was safely on their way with bashful muttered thanks, Judith went back to what she’d been doing before being side-tracked. As she pulled a box, a coverall, and a couple of shock-blankets from the boot of her car, registered to Kensington Police Station, she noticed a vacant taxi parked behind her. There was no one in the taxi, all the lights were off. Odd. Well, no business of hers.  Returning to the build-site, she pulled the coverall on over her uniform and crawled under the trailer housing the family of cats. She suspected they were partly tame, certain domesticated, the mother didn’t hiss at her again as she pushed the blanket-lined box ahead of her. As she carefully lifted twelve tiny kittens, eyes still closed, into the box, she was startled by a lightweight pressure on her shoulders, a prickle of claws. The mother cat had climbed to perch on her back and shoulders, and was nuzzling her cheek, purring. She smiled and shifted a bit to rub the soft fur made grimy by living on the streets.
John’s voice was so steady, so…calm. It was a bit frightening, but not that surprising. Greg chuckled and pushed away from his desk.
Greg’s alarm went off at a quarter to four, and he groaned, coughing into his pillow as he rolled over to smack the alarm into silence. Glancing at his watch, he debated the wisdom of sticking to his routine and going out on his usual morning run. Figuring a bit of air and exercise might clear his head, he gathered his running-kit and headed downstairs to put on his shoes. When Greg found the front door open, he frowned. But a rustle in the kitchen revealed Judith Watson at the sink. She had her back to the range, a glass of orange juice in hand, and a reusable plastic water-bottle sitting beside her on the counter. She was clad in running tights and a pair of layered shorts, trainers in a rather alarming but stylish shade of pink and orange, a quarter-zip fleece hoodie, and a hi-vis bib with a waistbelt. Hearing him, she glanced up and smiled.
“Hmm?” He looked up and saw ... well, that would have to be Sherlock standing by his car. “Oh. Where’s Rosie?”
Hooper was young, not quite as young as Holmes, and pretty but not quite beautiful with long brown hair kept out of her face in practical hairstyles and wide, expressive brown eyes. She was small, built like a dancer with a slender build, a bit clumsy in her movements and shy but she certainly knew her business and knew how to get results from people under her. John found her endearing and wondered what kind of opportunities he might have to befriend the young pathologist. He had no interest in pursuing more than friendship, of course, and would never give her the impression that he did. He knew better.
Q worked some magic down in his lab and another set of cameras appeared on the monitors. She was now looking at cameras from Islington and Soho.
John Watson had known coming to the Billingsley’s monthly summer get-together was a bad idea. But Mary had wanted to go, said it would be fun. Well, fun for
It was quiet as they arrived, and she dismissed the on-duty patrol that was sitting on the flat. They were the only two cars left on-scene this long after, everyone else had been dismissed and either gone back to the office or gone home.
“No, they didn’t.” Greg shrugged and followed them back to the body, dismissing the other two to wait at a safe distance. He gave them the name of the victim and let them do the rest. Sherlock circled the body, muttering to himself, while John leant against his cane and watched for a bit before joining him in his inspection.
“That.” She thumbed over her shoulder as the door clicked open. It didn’t open all the way, and Mycroft never showed himself, but the door was very obviously open.
Judith walked into her office and out the back, not stopping until she reached the far end of the compound. If they were that desperate to talk to her, they would find her. Judith paced along the fence-line for a bit before she turned and left the hospital-compound, staying out of sight of her superior officers.
As the night wore, and his other tables cleared out, John was able to spend his time tending to Moriarty and his companion. The man didn’t speak much, but he obviously could. He didn’t make eye-contact with anyone, though John once caught his eye by chance while Moriarty was away from the table taking a phone-call. He knew better than to engage the man, but he so desperately wanted to. Once, he was processing another table’s bill when he was aware of a soft tap on his arm. The scent of sea-water hit him before he heard the man’s voice and he smiled, relaxing a bit.
“I can’t imagine what would make coming out here pleasant, Mr Holmes! Come on, step into my office, gentlemen, we’ll talk inside!” She beckoned them to follow, knowing instinctively that they would, and didn’t say another word until she’d reached her office in the Medical Treatment Facility.
“Of course, yes.” She worked in a bloody war-zone, trouble was part of the lifestyle. “Enough for a lifetime. Far too much.”
“Told me not to waste my time calling someone who might not be around to take the call. I told them to kindly sod off.”
“I’m fine.” She whispered as Greg continued tugging at the jacket and vest. It was hard for him to catch his breath. He’d seen the worst of his nightmares tonight, and they had somehow survived the madness.
doing it, and no one seemed too eager to haze the new girl or pick on her at all. She was nice to everyone, careful to say please and thank you if
“Ah, Donovan.” Sherlock faced off against a feisty sergeant with dark skin and a bigger attitude problem than hers. Judith looked over her shoulder.
“Don’t get involved, Beverley, or you’ll be arrested as well.” He snapped, mimicking the same words Greg had spoken to him that awful night in 2011. “Where is Rosie?”
to be friends, but there was still something about him that itched at her awareness, that warned of a darkness and a danger she should want no part of. But until he
“Molly Hooper, this is John Watson.” Stamford made the introductions, “He and I were at Bart’s together ages ago.”
Moriarty fell from the roof. At the last minute, she thought to use a bit of magic to soften Sherlock’s landing, for all the good it did them. He was gone before he touched the pavement at their feet. Moriarty hadn’t survived the fall, and neither had Sherlock. One had died of impact-injuries, the other of a GSW to the chest. John held Sherlock, silent and whiter than a sheet.
“You’ve had a long night, and a longer day. I was concerned about my brother’s well-being, but I have found him in safe company and am sure he’ll recover in time.” Mycroft tapped his brolly against the pavement, “I’ll take my leave and be in touch. Good night to you all.”
“Oh, God, no! No, Jesus! Believe me, I know how you swing, John.” Stamford shook his head quickly. “Nah, Doctor Hooper’s not your type. She’d be a
“But I would know you in any crowd, John.” He looked over, “I’m trying to decide what it is you’ve done with your hair and why you did it.”
“If I didn’t know any better, Mycroft, I’d think you were trying to set me up on a date with a stranger.”
“And I know people who don’t take kindly to the likes of her threatening a delicate balance of domestic content in London.” He was thinking specifically of Mycroft Holmes, “It’ll be done quickly once I put in word that Judith Watson is possibly in danger.”
It had been quite a while since he’d gone for a good run, but it didn’t take long to get his rhythm. John chased the man about a half mile before he tackled him, sending them both into a tumble. He landed on top of the suspect and quickly sat on him, wishing just for a moment that he still had handcuffs. Or someone in pursuit who did have them. Handcuffs? Oh, wait a minute! Chuckling, he moved so he was kneeling on the man’s shoulders and found the handcuffs he had gotten as a present from Greg Lestrade last Christmas.
“Hi, pretty girl. You miss me today?” Judith smiled as Queenie rubbed her head against Judith’s cheek, “See anything interesting?” Queenie told her about her day, most of it spent sleeping in the sun on Judith’s bed and hunting bugs and rodents on the terraces of their housing-block and in the neighbourhood gardens. Nothing really to report. After getting late take-away for dinner, she took a shower and fell into bed with Greg, who was so tired he couldn't keep his eyes open.
They had never once had anything to do with each other beyond one night of brief contact and crossed wires through the papers, and yet...they seemed to be thinking along the same lines of making sure the other was safe and properly possessed of their own liberties while still being...what was a good word for it? Mated? Married? Taken? Engaged? Whatever the word for it was, Sherlock took comfort in knowing that he no longer had to face the world alone. And that was a beautiful, liberating, and frightening thing.
“So, you saved a family of homeless cats and solved a string of homicides. That’s what I call a successful night.” John mused, holding one of Queenie’s kittens, “Speaking of cats, what are you going to do with this bunch?”
If those weren’t tears in John Watson’s eyes, Sherlock was truly an idiot. He hadn’t let go of John’s hand after getting him off the damp pavement, and Sherlock tightened his grip, thinking of the last time he’d been able to hold John’s hand at all. Ignoring the crowds on the street behind them, Sherlock stepped into John’s space and leant in close.
bad side,” Brook whispered hoarsely. A call came in from Headquarters asking for an update on the situation, she informed them that everything was in order and no arrests had been necessary. She ended the radio-call before Riley’s indignant outburst reached them on the other end. Judith silenced the reporter with a glare that had withered stronger people than she.
. John had encountered one or two partners in his lifetime who either hadn’t known or hadn’t cared about the degree of preparation necessary for anal intercourse. Basic cleansing usually did the trick, a shower would more than suffice, and knowing what he did about Sherlock, John had no problem engaging with him.
“I don’t have a clue what he gave you, so I’ll go basic. Sleep off the worst of it and pray for the best.” John murmured, “You fucking moron, Sherlock Holmes, he would have killed you!”
“I’ll bring the other case files over for you boys, see if you can put the pieces together before he strikes again.”
“You have twenty minutes.” Roben snapped, dismissing them. Judith nodded and departed to fetch the keys to her Rover. She rounded up three constables and followed Greg and Sally over to Baker Street. Greg sent her a text to let her know that he had Sally and Anderson, and he’d called Baker Street to warn the boys.
, at this location, together before. And there’s only one bloke in the world I know who looks even a bit like you. Even if you did do something rather unfortunate with your hair.”
“Oh no, my dear Watson.” Sherlock smirked, “They need my help. It is not a matter of want. If these fools had their way, they’d never get a thing done.” The hotel was a hive of activity, there were cars and lights everywhere, it reminded her a bit of a crime-drama she’d watch on telly. But the adrenaline spike was very real. When they got to the floor on which the scene was contained, they found the place by following buzzing voices.
“Too good for the messed-up Watsons, but thank God he decided to stay.” She looked over her shoulder, “On his right are my step-sisters Adrianne and Melissa, with their families. Mel’s a single mother, we never cared to find out what happened to the father after it got around that he had a drug-problem, but she’s one of the best mothers I know to the twins. Adrianne’s married to a well-off politican, probably knows Mycroft Holmes better than
“Old habits, lad.” He shrugged, giving his shoulder an experimental stretch.  This was one of his old fans, from back when he and Sherlock had worked together.
?” John raised his head, intrigued by talk of the future. “You get bored without something to keep you occupied.”
“That’s Sherlock Holmes.” If this woman hadn’t heard of them, he’d be shocked. They were infamous. He watched her expression and gave himself a mental high-five when her eyes widened.
“Just finished queuing up your cameras, lovely.” Q’s head popped into view over the top of an array of monitors, “You brought food, didn’t you?”
“Because when even my anti-social, rude bastard of a best friend notices there’s something not quite on with you, it’s definitely bad. My brother’s been worried about you all week, knows you haven’t eaten or slept. I didn’t tell him, by the way, I know better.” She circled the bed, “But we’re not idiots. If there’s anything we can do to help you, just tell us. I mean, even Sally’s noticed, Greg, that’s how bad it’s gotten.”
coming.” Sherlock heard a heartbreaking sound from Greg, who had rushed from the Pembroke Mews flat he shared with Judith once he realized what had happened to her. But none of them dared move, afraid of what might happen.
“It’s not simple.” She shoved to her feet and sat down next to him, “But think of it this way: she’s the one who lost.”
“You’re bad enough you should be taken in.” He frowned and rubbed two gloved fingers along the underside of her arm, “Can’t get a line started, and lord knows you need one! What did those bastards give you, anyway?”
Before they left the Hampstead Heath house, John stopped to speak to the Radcliffes, who looked like their world had fallen apart. Thirteen puppies stolen, and now the adults were missing.
“Please?” He sniffled. The coat in question belonged to John Watson and Sherlock had slept with it every night since Watson had given it to him out of a kindness because it smelled like the Fey. He was some manner of Cù-Sìth, but Sherlock wasn’t sure what. He’d have said Werewolf, but he didn’t think that was quite right, either. There was a soft rustling and he was aware of Mycroft lifting him from the floor and setting him on the couch, covering him with something.
“Fancy running into you on a late train like this, Colonel Watson.” The blond menace was just as soft-spoken and careful not to smile. Judith hadn’t been addressed by her rank in almost nine months and sat up a bit more. Had she
be happening again. It wasn’t fair, he deserved better than a simple “thank you for your service and efforts, good luck with your future endeavours” and a handshake. Which was, more or less, exactly what he was getting. John sighed and pushed the file on his desk aside, putting his head in both hands.
“We’ll keep an eye on the place for you, Mrs. Hudson.” Judith promised. Once Mrs. Hudson was on her way, they settled in for the long haul.
“I will do my best.” He smiled and pressed a kiss the back of John’s hand. And wondered, still, what on earth he had been doing working at a place like Quo Vadis? Well, whatever else, he would make absolutely certain that John never had to work like that ever again. He wanted to make his consulting firm into a proper business, and for that, he needed a partner. John would be ideal, with his varied background and skills. Sherlock would look into the logistics involved while they were gone, do the finances and such that it would take to convert 221C into an office, keep 221B separate. But that could wait.
“Because they never cared about me. I was on my own until I was sixteen, fending off my father’s abuses by myself until I escaped to the Army. When Joseph Watson died at the bottom of a whiskey-bottle when I was twenty-one, I was free.” Judith glared out the wind-screen, “My mother remarried two years later to a man named Richard Hughes, who deserves so much better than the messed-up, broken family he married into. I mean, the man has grown children and grandchildren to boot, for Christ’s sake! My brother barely remembers his own name on a good day, you don’t want to know what he’s like on a
“That will make things easier.” John watched the tall man move around collecting things from different drawers. Not to mention
“For once.” John rolled his eyes, “Why don’t you just apply for a position as a new police constable and be done with it all?”
“Still haven’t caught the bastard, have ya?” Kittern’s boyfriend, Louis Raleigh, shuffled his feet, swaying.
“To what?! I don’t know if it’s occurred to you or not, but I don’t exactly have much worth going home to!” She sniffed, “I sure as hell don’t want a thing to do with any of my family, and most of my friends are in the Army. Where am I supposed to go? What am I supposed to do?”
“Donovan!” Lestrade yelled from up the road, getting their attention, “Go with her! She’s gonna see the rest of the family!”
“No thanks, Johnny boy. This one’s rather protective of his coat.” Moriarty chuckled, a sour sound to John’s ears, “He’s afraid it’ll get stolen or some nonsense.”
“Don’t you dare.” John’s eyes were hard, his voice cold, “You are not responsible for anything. You had no choice. And that sickens me. I will take care of you, Sherlock. I promise. I will make sure you are safe, and appreciated, and loved the way you deserve.” Anything Sherlock wanted to say was forgotten as his phone rang. It was a text message from Lestrade.
“Yep. But we’re both in the same boat about Mycroft, so I guarantee you he doesn’t know that we know, and he won’t. Greg knew it was a fake as soon as he heard.”
“These are coming with us.” He said simply. Sherlock nodded and made sure he had everything he needed. Going out to the sitting-room, he found Alexandra in conference with his brother and Lestrade. Working out the specifics, no doubt.
“Be right there!” he swung around and hopped off the retaining wall. Sherlock was right behind him as he headed down the slick, narrow stairs.
Moran stayed behind a while and she leaned against him, remembering a very different time when she had looked up to him for so much more than taking orders in combat.
today.” Sherlock mused, petting the sleeve of John’s smock, “Not the friendly doctor in fuzzy jumpers, are you?”
About four days into their trip, Greg suddenly realized that Judith’s happiness was something he wanted to be responsible for for the foreseeable future. He wanted to be the one to give Judith stability, a home, the understanding and compassion when things didn’t go quite to plan. He wanted to celebrate with her, suffer, laugh, cry, live, and love with her. In plain words, he wanted Judith as his wife. It was just that simple and so ridiculously complicated.
“I love Dalmatians, and detest those who hurt them, or any animals.” John pulled his phone from his pocket and called Greg. It rang so many times he thought it would go to voicemail. It did. Cursing, he left a short message. “Greg, hey, it’s John Watson. Listen, we got a break in the dognapping case. Suspect, names, location, everything. Call me back or I’ll find you. Now!” Hanging up, he redialed.
After all of the madness that took her from Kathmandu to New York to Hong Kong, Judith resettled into her normal routine. She and John started the lengthy, laborious process of rebuilding the London Sanctum. Aside from a few rather interesting cases that landed in John and Sherlock’s laps, the remainder of the year was strangely uneventful. Which was fine with Judith, she had never been too fond of non-stop casework. They celebrated Christmas at 221B Baker Street with a small party that was only disrupted when an old case was re-opened and they received evidence that Irene Adler was back to trouble the boys a bit more. Judith did not involve herself, even John told her to stay clear. That little bit of excitement came and passed and they moved on.
“I don’t think it’s going to matter. Just give him a grounding.” He leaned against John’s shoulder. The last time Judith had sung Down to the River had been at Christine Almond’s informal wake. She had sung in English that day, but for her brother, she would sing in Gaelic.
“Act as if I know nothing. Let her think I’m ignorant.” He finished his report and handed it to Greg, who added it to to the file.
He waited until the group was out on boats and turned to the instructor who had offered him a ride, “How long?”
“No, I don’t suppose she would be.” Mrs Hudson shrugged, “I do like her, so she is quite welcome to come back any time.”
“I like you, Watson.” Greg chuckled, adjusting the cuffs of his coat. “Thanks, Molly, see you later?”
“Yes, it is, ain’t it?” He grinned crookedly as he passed on his way. Judith shook her head and went back to writing reports while still keeping an eye on him. He got into the empty taxi and she watched the light go on. The late-crowd was still trickling out of the bars following last call, so it didn’t take long to get a fare.
“You are not what people expect in a serial-killer, Mr. Hope. But then again, that’s not what you do. You’re just an average cabbie, fallen on hard financial times, trying to make ends meet.” Judith got to her feet, “I can respect that. We’ll take you down to the station and we’ll finish our conversation there.”
There was a swirl of fabric at the periphery of his vision and he turned his head as a handful of glitter dusted his hair and shoulders. He had a brief thought that the stuff would never come out of fabric and how much grief he would get from coworkers when his jacket and shirt shimmered. The edge of a scarf brushed against his cheek and he caught at it with shaky fingers, turning his face into the folds of silk. By the heady scent clinging to the fabric, he knew it was Judith’s scarf. With a quick flick of motion, the scarf landed around his neck.
“We spent Christmas in the hospital. Not the worst place I’ve spent Christmas, but not my favourite, that’s for damn sure!”
“Oh, Kitty, you silly thing. Did you sit on the grey chair?” John chuckled and rubbed Kitty between the ears. “You don’t be like that with Sherlock, he’s our friend. He’s a good one, okay?” That got him a baleful glare, but her foul temper didn’t last very long as he found her favourite places to scratch.
“Mmm, yes.” A tightening of his expression was all the warning he got, it was time to tread carefully.
Things go a bit more the way of classic ACD canon here, I borrowed a lot of the dialogue between John and Mike from the original "Study in Scarlet".
“I’d like to see this woman myself.” Sherlock wore that troubling smile he got on when things were going very well. John snickered and they headed for the indicated car.
“Be that better, yeah? For Christ’s sake, I’m dating a Detective Inspector! I think you can handle an A&E surgeon!” She smiled at him, “Never mind that John’s dating the world’s only Consulting Detective!”
“Yep.” Judith stepped away from him and announced herself to her family, getting about the expected reaction from them. Richard Hughes peeled away from the cluster of adults and came to Greg.
“M is one of the city’s most powerful women, pretty much the only person higher than her is the Queen. Not even the Prime Minister. Then the Prime Minister, then Mycroft Holmes, then Sherlock Holmes, James Bond, and then me.”
“We can’t change the past, as much as we’d like to, all we can do is make the best of whatever future is ahead of us.”
“And you, Mister, had better have a very good reason for all that awful business!” She said this to Sherlock as she poked him in the chest, “Nearly gave me a proper fright, you did! The both of you, pair of fine idiots!”
“Oi.” He bit gently on John’s left ear to scold him. The body under his paws trembled and he realized John was laughing.
“You’ve been all over the world with the Army, and this is still the furthest you’ve ever been from home.” Strange shook his head, “It was the same for me, and for your brother. Many who come here don’t travel as far.”
“It’ll happen when my hair gets wet. That’s my Da’s side of the family. Black and green fur, y’know.”
“He’s right next to me, John. Focus on us, focus on the sound of our breathing. Come on back, you’re safe.” She rested her hands on her thighs, keeping her eyes closed. Sherlock would be her eyes. He had one hand on her shoulder. Slowly, her brother came back from whatever dark place his nightmare had taken him to and Judith found herself rocking him in her arms when he came looking for physical contact. Sherlock was holding onto him as well, offering a grounding for John. After a while, Sherlock started to hum. Judith recognized the tune and smiled, running her fingers through her brother’s hair in slow, soothing strokes.
“Oh, you’re a clever girl, Constable.” Hope smiled, shaking his head as Judith and Sherlock switched places, “Clever girl.”
“I think ... you are the ... amazing one.” Sherlock turned his head and studied him, “I’ve never ... experienced something quite like that before. It was ... ”
“Like hell you are,” Greg muttered, looking down at the group of personnel gathered on the beachhead below. Most of the activity seemed to be focused down there. The tide was out, so there was plenty of room to work without getting anywhere near the water, but even John knew that this kind of work would almost guarantee wet shoes, damp socks, and stained trouser-cuffs. And the Tyvek PPE suits worn by the Forensic Specialists would be precious little protection.
They slept undisturbed from about three am until seven-fifteen, discounting the cats joining them at four, which was later than Judith or Sally usually slept. But since they were technically on watch-duty to sit on Baker Street until orders came to them otherwise, it didn’t matter if they slept in a bit. John fixed breakfast for all of them, and they went over the information Mycroft had sent her regarding Richard Brook. It was as she had suspected. Richard Brook was a real person, but everything else about him was fabricated. Well,
“Ciao, Sherlock Holmes!” Looking back at Sherlock with some distaste, he walked away calmly. Sherlock slowly stepped forward to keep him in his sights.
“Upstairs, third floor.” Mycroft patted her on the shoulder, “Either room is yours. I’ve already called Anthea.”
“Absolutely! And I have every right to be! You are perfect, John Watson, and I will do whatever I must to remind you of that.”
He was familiar with tall, dusky Riyah, who traditionally led the girls during the night, but last night the leadership had changed a bit and Riyah had pulled in a partner. Leading the current set was Riyah’s blonde British counterpart, who performed under the stage-name of Zazi. He had heard of Judith Watson’s hobby of belly-dancing, had viewed hours worth of compiled CCTV and rehearsal footage, but there was nothing like seeing it in person. She did not disappoint, and Mycroft found himself hoping that the others would make it to see a few sets before the night was old. Judith was aware of him, he watched her rhythm change and sent a brief text to his brother, Judith’s brother John, and to Judith’s NSY contacts.
“I’ll show you the way then, shall I? Last thing I need is Mr Moriarty down my throat because you lost your way and went in the wrong door.” Wondering if he was going mad, John led the tall, quiet fey downstairs and directed him to the gents. In the time the man was in the gents, John had seen to another table and was pocketing the tip-money after running the bill when he was aware of the man’s approach.
John Watson returns to London after two decades in the Royal Army Medical Corps, where he takes rooms in VA housing and a job wherever he can find work. He finds work at an upscale London restaurant called Quo Vadis as a waiter. One night, during a long shift, he meets an unusual patron. His life is about to get a whole lot more interesting.
“Yeah, might as well. Thanks.” Greg gave a tired, dismissive wave as he focused on the paperwork cluttering his desk, looking for the rest of the files. The attractive blonde just smiled brightly, a bit too friendly, and looked at John.
worlds, living, dying, going about their daily lives. She saw so many different dimensions it was hard to count them all. She fell for what felt like an eternity, listening to voices in her head. She heard John, she heard the Ancient One, and a voice that sounded an
“Don’t be silly.” Jim rolled his eyes at the unspoken question, “Someone else is holding the rifle. I don’t like getting my hands dirty.”
Once both bodies had been identified, Roben took his leave. Greg followed him out. Roben didn’t stick around, it was obvious this whole affair made him uncomfortable, and the presence of three sorcerers who probably had his number didn’t help much. But Greg didn’t care for his boss’s comfort or, in this case, discomfort. The prick didn’t deserve a clear conscience after what had happened last night. As soon as Roben was gone, Greg let out an audible sigh of relief.
going to live this down!” Judith got out first and looked over the roof of the car at the tape-line a few yards distant, “How are we going to explain this?”
“No, I know, but you don’t understand. Only one of them was supposed to die! Something went wrong and Sherlock died.” She looked back at the door to London Sanctum, “
“Good with me!” Greg rolled a kink out of his shoulders and they headed up the steps to the house. Judith nudged the door shut with her foot once they were out of the cold and looked around.
“Really really. I’ve got enough on my plate with this case, I can wait a bit to get your statements. Just don’t forget, Sherlock.”
“It’s easier to find Doctor Hooper, and wherever she is, I guarantee you Holmes isn’t far away.” Mike looked at him, but John knew he wore a neutral expression. Not uninterested but not annoyed either. Just … neutral. He was good at that.
They ran their ten-mile loop around Kensington, Hyde, and St. James’s. When they made their return circuit and looped past Mycroft’s flat on Chester Place, noting the light on in the front window, Judith decided to check on the wards she had placed on the flat.
convenient. Walk to the station, get the keys, get her roster, hit the streets. Her brother had moved into a flat on Baker Street with Sherlock Holmes about two months ago, and they got along rather well. John had taken a job with Sherlock as his partner/assistant, proving
“I noticed you when you boarded the train at Baker Street.” She rubbed her fingertips together, checking the map so she wouldn't miss her stop, “It’s kind of my
When the row ended with Holmes turning his back on Doctor Hooper and storming out, John simply stepped out of the way and watched him go.
“It is the same as the other three.” Sherlock snapped his gloves, eyes narrow, “But it won’t be his last.”
He fell asleep that night wrapped around a warm body, satisfactorily exhausted and sore in the right places for the right reasons, content to be safe with one of the only people he’d ever met who loved him despite his flaws and vices and loved him
“Oh. Interesting.” The cabbie looked at the pill with interest but his voice gave nothing away as he spoke. Well, nothing a
When they reached Chester Terrace, they ran into the scene almost right away. From Chester Terrace and Cumberland Place to 35 Chester Terrace, the street was completely blocked off from traffic. Beyond the line at Chester and Cumberland, it was full of police vehicles. The two constables guarding that line looked at each other and one radioed in, received an affirmative, and promptly sent John and Sherlock on their way.
“Of course they will. This is far from the first time you’ve come here dressed as you are tonight, and the staff know you by name.”
“I was wearing a red vest under my uniform, most of the medics did, and it wasn’t really obvious under the shirt and two more layers of clothing and an armour vest that I was actively and profusely bleeding.”
“It’s okay.” John smiled, “You had a gun pointed at your head a minute ago and then the moron went psycho, you’re allowed to be not fine.”
Making his way downstairs with a towel and change of clothes over one arm, John found the primary flat empty but warm. Mrs Hudson must have been up at some point, a fire burned low in the hearth. The kitchen was as much a disaster as it had been last night, which kind of made him smile, but there was no sign of Sherlock and Kitty was suspiciously absent. A double-check of the sitting-room revealed Sherlock’s coat and scarf hanging by the door, and he found Kitty sleeping on the grey armchair.
“Huh. Wasn’t expecting someone like you. I thought maybe one of Moriarty’s goons would get it, or some stranger had it and wouldn’t know the first thing about what it was.”
“Richmond and East Sheen Cemetery. Come on, it's this way.” He waited for the other two to join him. The driver stayed by the car as John, Mycroft, and Greg walked to a nearby plot. John looked around, despite knowing damn well there was next to no danger here. And even if that changed, he and Greg could probably handle it no problem. Not that Mycroft was unable to defend himself should he come under attack. John waited with Mycroft at a polite distance while Greg studied the grave-marker. The headstone had no proper name, just an initial and a surname and dates: E. Holmes 1 April 1981-17 April 2015. After a few minutes of tense silence, he turned and looked at them, his expression just this side of unreadable.
Mycroft Holmes sat in his office in MI6 Headquarters in Whitehall, studying recent CCTV footage with unusual intensity. He had been scouring the footage prior to the phone call he’d just received from his husband, which he did feel a bit bad about hanging up on Gregory as he had but he had something else to handle just momentarily. Gregory had, of course, apologized for the fact that he would be late coming home due to processing and paperwork for a call he’d taken. Someone had called in a disturbance and his husband had been among several officers dispatched to handle the situation, that had led to the arrest of several unruly inebriated patrons of a pub where a brawl had broken out. Mycroft knew, as Gregory knew, that his husband had far better things to be doing with his time than marshalling bar-brawls on a Tuesday night, but sometimes there just wasn’t anything he could do except take the call. Now, Mycroft was going over footage of the pub from earlier in the evening, going frame-by-frame. One of the patrons got his attention and he paused the footage, going a few frames back to see when he first came into camera-range, and then forward looking for a good angle.
“You owe me an answer, Gregory Lestrade!” His wife hissed, leaning over his desk. She was drunk, and quite possibly high. Behind her, completely unnoticed, the Watsons were gearing up to step in on his behalf. Sally stood in the doorway, blocking that escape, furious at being called a hustler by her boss’s awful wife. He was angry on his own for that, Claudia could do and say whatever the hell she wanted to him, but when she turned on his team and treated them like that, it was crossing a line.
“Posh bastard.” John recovered, covered his mouth, coughed again, and reached for his drink. Sherlock handed it to him and let their fingers touch.
“We’ll leave you to it, and be in touch.” John got up and they shook hands with the couple. At the door, Pongo came for a final pat and he ruffled the dog’s ears.
“Just doing a perimeter check.” She tugged her sling-ring from a pocket on her running-vest. She executed a spell to render the wards visible. Shimmering mandalas and spirals of mystic symbols appeared in a shield-wall against the front of the house, extending out to the gate where they stood on the footpath. There were no signs of any weak spots or splintered spells. Confident that the mystic protection measures were solid, she cleared the visibility spell. Multi-colored sparks showered down on the damp pavement as the wards were rendered invisible again. Beside her, Greg’s eyes were wide with awe.
“It is not easy to express the inexpressible,” he answered with a laugh. “Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes — it approaches cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of a vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness.”
“Don’t do that, you’ll start all over again!” Judith reached over the car and poked at Sally, “We’re at a crime-scene, for god’s sake, we can’t giggle at a crime-scene!”
“I did what I could. The rest is up to her.” Strange said quietly as Greg followed him out into the hallway.
“Yes, of course!” Riyah just smiled at her and pulled the curtain on a small changing-stall, “Off with that uniform of yours, eazizi.” Judith chuckled and carefully removed and folded aside each piece of her uniform, stacking her boots on top when she was done. She had showered yesterday while in Germany, but a cursory wipe-down with damp flannel did a quick job to freshen up. After getting into her costume, wondering when on earth Mycroft’s people had dropped it off at Maroush and how he could have possibly known, Judith sat still to let Riyah do something about hair and makeup.
“I’d have left The Met for my own sake.” She shrugged and looked over her shoulder. There was a rustle of movement inside and she narrowed her eyes.
. Hold still.” He scolded as he carefully turned her over onto her stomach. She rolled her eyes and pulled the pillow under her chest to support her head as he carefully stripped away her pyjama bottoms to get full access to the point of interest.
John, in my AUs, has Scottish heritage, so he would definitely call someone like Sherlock (who's about as British as it GETS, give or take the occasional traipse into French ancestry) "Saxon". It's a term of endearment between them, of course.
quickly to John and Sherlock now that she knew who they really were. Sherlock asked permission to inspect the kitchen, and Mrs Michaels told him to help himself. John stayed in the sitting-room and kept the dogs company. Well, Pongo at any rate. The bitch, a handsome Dal named Perdita, followed Sherlock around. He caught his partner talking to her in French as he searched for clues.
“Not a bit sorry.” She smirked and pushed him back on the bed until he fell backwards, pinning him down by sitting on his hips, “Now, we are going to sleep, in the morning we’ll run our eight-mile loop, we’ll get breakfast somewhere after, and figure out what the hell we’re supposed to do with twelve cats. I’m off tomorrow, and so are you. I checked your schedule this morning. So, barring any new cases coming up, you’re free.”
“Exactly what it looks like.” Greg cradled the box with one hand so it wouldn’t accidentally get dropped as he went down on one knee, wondering if the tremor he felt was in his hand or if they were both shaking.
“Your brother is a meddling sneak of the worst colour, came in here and took my clothes, had them altered, and brought them
“Mm. I hear Siberia’s nice this time of year.” He narrowed his eyes, “I’ve got friends in higher places than The Met who happen to be
“And having a friend at the morgue, someone good with dead bodies, might be just the sort of useful friend I need,” John said lightly.
Sherlock and John have solved the case and return to Baker Street to find themselves host to a few very unexpected guests. One is unexpected but not unwelcome on Baker Street. The other...well, there had better be a damn good reason Moriarty's back on Baker Street.
“Would you like me to bring more water, Mr Moriarty?” John held his tray under one arm, tucked against his body as he surveyed the situation.
“Oh. Um. Thanks.” John gave a weak smile and tagged along to a nearby Ford. He felt a bit queasy, and his palms were damp. It didn’t help that his heart was banging against his ribcage like it wanted to jump out of his body.
“Sherlock? You alright, sweetheart?” John’s voice was soft again, and Sherlock blinked, focusing on the other man. A cup of tea was pressed into his hands, and he instinctively grabbed John’s hand before he could pull away.
“Likewise, Inspector. It’s been a couple of years, but looks like life off the battle-field is treating you well.” John looked him over as they shook hands and smiled, “Well enough indeed. Sorry to hear about the trouble you’re having with your wife, though.”
“Of course.” Jim moved away across the roof. Sherlock took several shallow anxious breaths, then he stopped breathing for a moment as his brain kicked into gear again. He lifted his gaze and his expression became more thoughtful. After a bit, something occurred to him and he started to laugh.
“Good night.” She turned the paper over in her hand and set it down on top of the laptop. Once the door had closed, she toed off her shoes and set aside her uniform. She had been coming off-duty when she’d found the London Sanctum. After shedding her uniform and folding it aside for later, she brushed her teeth, let her hair out of the braided bun she wore on-duty, and fell asleep listening to the sounds of a foreign city. She didn’t know where Kamar-Taj was, and decided to find out in the morning.
“You’re getting stronger, Jude. You’re always careful.” Strange took her hand, a familiar touch she was used to by now.
“Dear Jim. Please will you fix it for me to get rid of my lover’s nasty sister?” Jim grinned as he recognised the TV show and catchphrase that Sherlock was quoting. “Dear Jim. Please will you fix it for me to disappear to South America?”
The music drifted out of the club like a vibrating pulse. Sherlock could feel it in his bones. The night was alive with possibility. He could even imagine himself sticking around the venue long enough to hook up with someone for a one-night stand. No names, no strings attached, just a good old fashion fuck and gone before sunrise. But who the fuck would ever look twice at him? The dark-haired genius sighed and turned away from the club, wondering what the hell he’d been thinking. He was tired, lonely, and...what? Suicidal? Desperate, maybe. And so,
“I’m fine.” John leant his head back and looked up at Greg, who stood before them with his arms folded across his chest and doing his game best not to smile.
She looked out the windscreen at people coming and going on business, unaware of the drama unfolding behind closed doors.
Getting into the house, he packed two bags with his belongings. Two bags, two boxes, and a suit-bag. Most of the stuff in the house was Mary’s. He didn’t take anything he hadn’t bought for himself, even going so far as to leave behind his wedding ring on the dresser. He would worry about annulments and divorce decrees later. He really wanted to go back to London, back to Baker Street, back … well, back to the only place he’d ever truly felt at home. Locking the house, he left his key under the mat and the drive back to Baker Street was pleasantly quiet.
“A…suitcase? No, I don’t think I did.” She shook her head, “But…oh! Wait, Sherlock!” she hadn’t seen a suitcase in the
under this, or on top of it! John, this is gorgeous!” Which really made him wonder what the Sìth soldier
“Those spots look like Dalmatian spots.” John handed the rendering to Sherlock, “She wants a Dalmatian coat and she’s stolen…what is it now, ninety-nine puppies to do it?”
“Christ, you’re mad to think I’d leave you here! I only leave for work or to take a shower and check on the cats!”
have.” Sherlock’s voice was just as soft, but his intent just as clear. John didn’t say anything, the message was obvious and understood. The young detective’s focus shifted and settled at last on the faded starburst scar on John’s shoulder. Sherlock would know, by touch and deduction alone, which parts of the scar were from the bullet that had torn through his shoulder and left a hole in more than just his chest, and which was from the numerous surgeries in the days and months that followed.
“What…would you like me…to make her say…next?” Sherlock continued to move towards her but he looked for anyone else who might be in the pool-deck with them.
seen something out on the moor, but what he might have seen was uncertain. John thought he might have seen the infamous Ghost Hound the locals talked about, that haunted Henry Knight, but there was no real telling. At the moment, she sat on a snow-covered ledge on the north slope of Mount Everest, watching the swirling snow as it gusted around her on the winds. The Ancient One had once told her that it took twenty minutes for a human body to go into shut-down in this place, two if they were in shock. She had been here for roughly an hour and despite feeling a bit chill, she felt fine. A crackling sound got her attention and she raised her head. She smirked, knowing damn well who had come after her up here.
“Oi! Watson! Sometime today would be nice!” Lestrade called, the others had already gone in. Judith waved to Donovan, who turned away to hide her smile, and headed for the sheet-covered bodies of the victims after donning blue PPE gear.
“Good night, H.” He watched Mycroft get into the car and waited until the car was out of sight before going back inside and back upstairs to his. That had probably been the strangest way someone had ever wished him a happy birthday. But at least Mycroft had thought to
“And I missed you too, Sassenach*.” Oh, he’d pulled out that old nickname, had he? Sherlock giggled and buried his face in John’s good shoulder.
“Yes, but it may be pushed to excess.” Stamford screwed up his face a bit. “When it comes to beating the subjects in the morgue, it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape.”
“Half-four. Here.” A paper cup was pressed into his hands, he drank without question. Sherlock Holmes was the one waking him up this time, not one of the nurses or the assigned physician. He glanced towards the window, where he could see a bit of light. Looking at his watch told him it was four-thirty am. On a normal morning, he’d be getting ready for a run right now. Instead, he had spent the past three nights sleeping on a cramped waiting-room couch, stopping by between shifts at work, hoping for some sign of life.
they’d done that. Roben’s eyes narrowed and Judith bit her lip. Oh, what had Mycroft done this time? He shuffled some papers on his desk and glared at her.
“That’s not one of ours, is it?” One of the lieutenants called over the truck as Judith shaded her eyes to watch the approach.
“Likewise.” John smiled and they shook hands on another case solved. The chief constable came to them as the van pulled away.
“Went into the Army Foundation College three months after I turned sixteen, I went to full service the next year and kept going until 2009.” She shrugged, “That was my life for so long.”
“Well, just ... make sure your car isn’t the first thing Sherlock’s going to see when he finally does show himself.”
“She has a way with animals,” Sherlock said as they reached the top of the stairs, waiting for John to catch up. The door of 221B was closed, but Sherlock opened it as John reached the landing. The flat itself was cluttered and messy, but it didn’t really bother John.
“No, thank you.” Mycroft gave a polite smile and dismissed their server again. Bryan just smiled and was gone with a nod. John took a sip of his tea after pouring a cup and fixing it the way he liked, and Mycroft picked up his wine-glass as they looked around the crowded dining room.
“Interesting place.” Donovan murmured, looking around the restaurant. Mycroft did not miss how Donovan, Lestrade, and Hughes all staking out the area, and at least two of them had eyes on the main entrance. Lestrade faced towards the kitchen, busy keeping tabs on the wait-staff and customers coming and going from that part of the restaurant while Donovan and Hughes took care of the other angles. Not that Maroush was a dangerous place, but old habits died hard and he appreciated their watchfulness.
“Strongest girl I know, but the shade of her mother’s cruelty and the memories of her father’s abuses hang over her shoulders.” Greg folded his hands behind her back and watched Judith interact with her step-siblings, “I’ve got a question for you, Mr. Hughes, if you’ve a moment?”
“Will you talk to me at Scotland Yard, or will you only talk to me here?” This was almost too easy, she was a bit concerned.
“Got a list of suspects, but I’ll tackle that tomorrow.” His expression was familiar, “It’s been about two days since I had a break, so I called it quits for now.”
time, you two! God knows you’ve earned it!” He hugged her, “Let us know when you get there safe, yeah?”
“That’s fine, Myc.” Greg looked up as he offered John a hand. “You really don’t need to stick around, I can get a ride back to the office.”
“Met Police, open up!” Judith knocked on the door with her torch. There was a commotion inside, she looked at Sally, who nodded.
“It depends on the player, I don’t mind the violin played well,” John answered. “Early-morning see-saw sessions, on the other hand, are a different matter. Pull that trick and I’ll drug your coffee.”
“Catherine House. This way.” She headed north a bit on the foot-path and turned the corner going left to reach Catherine House. She would bet money the rest of the Almond family already knew, but she owed it to them to give them the affirmative in person. She and Donovan climbed the many stairs to the third floor, and she counted doors and apartment-numbers until they got to 30 Catherine House. The door itself was propped open a bit, which she remembered as a habit from her childhood. People didn’t really close their doors around here, which would probably make canvassing the area much easier. And if her name got around before they started asking questions of the neighbours, all the better. Most of these people knew her, had for years.
“Holy hell, you’re still in London?” John chuckled as he sat down across from his old school-mate. He remembered a much younger, less-portly Mike Stamford at Saint Bartholomew’s Hospital, they had gone to medical school together for years before John decided the Army was more his liking.
“Mycroft can get you a special license for that,” Sherlock said quietly as they walked. Judith shook her head.
still here, yeah?” Judith leaned back to look up at him, “Greg, it’s going to be okay, I promise. It hurts like the dickens right now, I know it does, but you’ll be a better person for it, stronger.”
“You know, I’m not sure. He’s in the government, minor position is what he says, but he spends too much time in Whitehall and Vauxhall Cross for that to be true.”
“Very well, Mr Holmes.” Another notation was made and Bryan gave them a smile. “I’ll get your drinks in! Shall I bring bread for the table?”
When the dancers scattered among the tables to make their rounds of the customers and select the last few lucky unfortunates. It was random choice, or that’s what they said, and Greg was curious to see who would get pulled tonight. A few inebriated patrons were hauled from their seats to the great delight of their mates, including two from their table. Judith’s gorgeous companions did the picking, and Greg was a teensy bit jealous. The whole idea was to try, and in good fun make a fool of yourself, and Greg knew his skills were dismal when sober, he couldn’t imagine what it would be like drunk. He wasn’t drunk, but it was damn close.
When a missing-persons call came in for Beth Davenport, a Junior MP, around eleven pm on the 27th, Judith was among the few who didn’t think she was just wandering the streets of London in a tipsy haze, safe but out of harm’s way. Judith was on duty that night and spent a few hours scouring the out-of-the-way spots her associates skimmed over on a regular day, never mind the night a politician was reported missing by her aides.
“Worst case we put him under a 48-hour hold until this blows over. Jail might actually be the safest place for him today.” She started the car and headed for Kitty Riley’s house.
“Well, for one thing, I recognized you the minute I set eyes on you on the street down there. Thought I was imagining it, but we’ve been
“Uh, in the nursery closet, dear.” The housekeeper blinked as Mrs Radcliffe disappeared upstairs, her footsteps rushed and loud. A moment later, she came back down with an artist’s portfolio, which she smacked down on the coffee table and flipped open, rifling through the renderings inside.
