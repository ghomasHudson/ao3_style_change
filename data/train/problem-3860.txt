“No,” Dean wrapped his arms around himself, sounding petulant. “Of course not. That would be silly.”
“Boxers off. Now.” Castiel demanded and Dean grabbed his hands, pinning them to the mattress above his head.
Castiel kissed his neck. “Just relax,” he murmured into Dean’s skin, his voice even deeper than usual. Dean could feel him take a hold of his cock and slowly feed it to Dean. He was more than ready from Castiel’s prep from earlier but the position made it a tight fit.
“Cas.” Dean looked back up at him while he reached behind Castiel to open the door. “You know the fastest way to get me to do something?”
“Oh, a doctor?” Dean asked and Castiel nodded hesitantly. Dean should have understood him. “Yes, but they will just give you a full cast, not a splint like this.”
thought of him, that was not who he was.
Dean narrowed his eyes. “Meaning what?”
Mildred shooed him out of the kitchen early so he went to find Castiel, who was apparently just finishing up his afternoon yoga session outside in the grass. Not wanting to disturb him, Dean stayed back and watched from afar, mesmerized as always with Castiel’s fluid movements.
Now most people would not be able to tell, but Jimmy wasn’t the best at writing code himself. His skills were more at recognizing it and finding exactly those patterns to sniff out hackers who’d tried to change their names. Usually he was comparing their actual coding, but he couldn’t help but see patterns everywhere. It had been ingrained in him. And it looks like Castiel was about to get set up.
And in the blink of an eye, it was dark again, too early for even the sun to have risen yet. Yet here they were, Castiel crouched in front of him, still holding on to his wrist. Dean jerked back. “The fuck did you do to me?”
Dean rubbed his hands over his face. “What?” He’d been told official interviews were out of the question. Castiel, ever the mystery, refused to give them on principle. However Dean was a great reporter and he did indeed already have a list of questions prepared, just in case he got lucky. And it seemed that it paid off now.
“Man overboard!” Castiel yelled, but before he could take further action, a lifebuoy was already thrown over, along with a ladder. This was one efficient crew. Castiel started to believe that this was not as irregular an occurrence as it should have been.
“Or when you have to leave them,” Castiel added, thinking of those first few foster homes he’d been in, before he decided he’d be better off on his own.
Dean flared his nostrils. Shit. The adrenaline crash wasn’t coming. Instead it was still coursing high through his veins and he was kinda pissed that he couldn’t use it to interrogate Garth. Guy seemed shifty. He had half a mind to kick their door down, but they’d already been traumatized tonight and they’d both seemed legitimately scared.
“Really? Can you, Dean?” Jo finally turned to look at him instead of Jimmy.
“Yes.” Dean snapped a little too harshly. Castiel was a cute dork. A hard worker. And really smart. “Anyone should be happy to bring Castiel home.”
One year after their first meeting, they were hosting a Christmas party. Apparently one of their friends found it hilarious to hang some mistletoe while they were in the kitchen getting more snacks and drinks, because a little while later, Dean and Cas both found themselves unwittingly standing under it and all of their friends started chanting: “Kiss, kiss, kiss!”
“Wh.. whatever you think, Sir,” Dean eventually replied and Castiel grinned at Jimmy, conveying that this was what a good boy should sound like.
After Castiel came to collect him for dinner, which caused the rest of the kitchen staff to either wink or just dopily smile at him, Dean had been reminded of the tea. He actually had not been present for that. But if Castiel drank it himself, surely it was clean?
“Fuck,” Castiel cursed. “I hate you.” He knelt down next to Dean and stroked a hand from his lower back to his ass.
“The splint?” Dean asked, pointing at his branch construction. Castiel nodded. “Six weeks?” Dean guessed, scratching his eyebrow. “Unless you’re a really fast healer.”
“Oh, good grief.” Billie rolls her eyes. “Fine. Have it your way.” She slams her scythe on the ground and it suddenly opens up below him and he’s falling. And falling.
Dean nodded, regretfully moving to get out of the comfortable bed. It must be Castiel’s room after all, if the man had stayed here all night. “Yes,” he replied. “I’m sorry you had to sleep in the chair because of me.”
“What?” Dean asked. “Why are you looking at me like that?”
Castiel pouted. “But I wanna hear the story.”
leaving,” Castiel replied, entering the office and raising his eyebrow expectantly.
That was an odd question to ask unless Anael was in on the Odin operation but hadn’t informed him yet. Jimmy only knew about it because he’d snooped. His partner should have the same knowledge as he did.
“Uhm, yes,” Dean mumbled. “Just didn’t expect it to… taste so bad.”
He‘s surprised and mildly disappointed, but hey. Heaven is different now. It‘s a good place. He can feel it.
Castiel accepted the book and stared at it. The front cover held no title and instead featured a drawing of a huge snake coming up from below to eat a ship whole. Surely that couldn’t be right? “Are you… what?”
Dean lowered his gun, but still kept it ready. “Novak.” His voice was harsh. “What are you doing here?”
Castiel grinned at his brother, daring him to argue with that. He’d even helped Dean install special software meant to prevent his notebook from accessing the dark web. Of course Cas knew how to circumvent all of those security measures, but Dean didn’t know that and Jimmy wouldn’t be able to prove anything.
“Does it have to be right away? We were on a different path,” Dean sighed, looking troubled. Ana placed a soothing hand on his lower back.
Dean started to bind the branch to Castiel’s leg with the torn strips of shirt. “A make-shift splint?” Castiel didn’t recognize the last word, but that explained why he was so confused. It must show on his face, because Dean frowned at him. “To keep your leg straight while it heals?”
“He’s a trained FBI agent, you idiot. He’s not some spoiled rich kid who never had to fend for themselves and wouldn’t know if they’re being duped until it is too late,” Meg reminded him.
Dean’s legs were laid up on his chair and when Dean moved his head, he realized something soft was placed under it. “Here I am,” he replied dumbly and smiled.
milk.”
“What?” Dean’s voice was more harsh than normal. He must have realized that Castiel was staring at him.
Dean picked up the carrot once more. “I don’t know what you mean,” he replied innocently, shoving the carrot between his lips, a little deeper than before, and twirling his tongue around it, holding Castiel’s gaze, before he finally bit off and started chewing.
Cas smiled brightly. “I’d love to tell you about these things. It’s better than just moaning about how heavy the crates were that I had to heave around that day.”
Castiel flushed, looking up at the ceiling. “Sorry,” he mumbled. “For what it’s worth, I’m clean.” And he hadn’t had sex in way, way too long. He hoped that part was self-explanatory, though, considering how embarrassingly fast he just came.
“Of course.” Dean rolled his eyes, but he chuckled, already moving to get off the bed. Whatever helped Cas to relax. And hopefully this time, Dean would not be left out in the cold once the session was over.
The Kraken was thrashing against the ship, trying to destroy it, but Castiel’s wards held. He still regretted helping Dean with the summoning spell. This was suicide. The Kraken had already managed to knock three sailors overboard and then gleefully threw them up in the air before swallowing them with his many-toothed mouth. They could all hear the screams as he munched on them and most had abandoned posts and sought shelter below deck.
“It means you don’t have to steal Dean’s notebook for your extra curricular activities anymore.” Jimmy raised an eyebrow and reached back into his pocket, also producing a SIM-card. “It means you can get a damn smartphone so we can text each other or call even when you’re not at home.” Jimmy licked his lips. “Like I’ve been trying to do almost all day.”
“I feel so guilty at letting myself get tricked like that.” Castiel had reduced his blinking once again so he was able to let his eyes shine with tears. “I bet she added that damn peppermint on purpose, just so I couldn’t drink it, because it would implicate me, or at least suggest I knew about the drugs.”
That night, Dean grilled them burgers and they took them into the room with them. Castiel decided he would be better at pacing himself if he was less involved, so he pushed Dean down on the bed and proceeded to give him a blowjob. Dean didn’t know just where the connection came from when it started, if it was Castiel’s hands on his ass or his mouth on his cock, but the warm tingles definitely started in his groin and when Dean spilled down Castiel’s throat, Castiel reciprocated by filling him with his grace.
“The fuck I won’t. She was my mother, too.” Sam crossed his arms in front of his chest just as their boat bumped into the Impala, jostling them.
Castiel stayed awake, listening to the sound of Dean’s breathing and vowing to not let any more harm come to this precious boy in his arms. And he might have also been plotting just what he’d do if he ever met Dean’s father or that awful ex of his.
“Now where would you hear something like that?” Dean replied, giving him a once-over.
“Dean,” he greeted, hands crossed behind his back to keep himself from touching Dean and seeming too obvious in front of the others. “Did you enjoy the show?”
They moved back into the cave and Castiel checked the berries, grateful that Dean had been thoughtful enough to bring them, but assuring him that it wasn’t necessary. Apparently his body was already producing everything the baby could need.
Castiel returned the smile. “But listen. If it gets too hard, I understand.”
“We’re Emperor penguins,” Castiel mused, still smiling, the pills finally kicking in.
When Castiel stirred awake, Dean smiled at his grumpy look. “Morning, sunshine.” Castiel’s frown just deeped and Dean chuckled. “We should get an early start and maybe take two trips down into the jungle today. Gather more wood, maybe even find a mammal to eat.”
He could hear Castiel chuckle as he got his yoga mat and then Dean’s brain was preoccupied with watching him go through his motions fluidly once again. Except this time, without a shirt and just in boxers, Dean could clearly see his rippling muscles at play and was able to admire his ass and thick thighs thanks to the boxer shorts.
“Fine,” Jimmy acknowledged. “But next time we’ll take you apart.”
He immediately abandons his current occupation of checking the rodent feed’s expiry dates and inches closer to the guinea pigs. As soon as he spots him, Dean sighs. The man currently pressed against the glass and engrossed in watching the pigs had been coming by almost every day for over two weeks now. He never comes in. He probably has never even noticed Dean checking him out. But damn.
At that, Dean laughed. “Listen, Angel, you know HR ultimately decides on those. Which is a good thing, considering…” He pointed between the two of them.
“No, wait.” Dean tugged him back in. “I meant no, don’t go back to your desk. Stay here.” He looked up at him pleadingly. “Please.” Dean opened his legs so Castiel could move in even closer. “Let’s, uh, burn those calories.”
“Me, too.” Castiel replied, without missing a beat. Dean was grateful he didn’t offer his sympathies or any other platitude. “Still can’t read or write notes.”
“Look, I give them a chance. When it becomes clear they just want the Castiel experience, I give it to them and then I go and blow off steam elsewhere.” He shrugged. “What good would it do to repeat a performance I can’t top?”
Dean was laughing too much to complain—or give an indication that he liked it—but they weren’t that far progressed yet anyway. Joining in on the laughter instead, Castiel jumped into bed next to Dean, making him bounce on the mattress and laugh harder.
“Cas! You’re back,” Dean exclaimed, resisting the urge to fall right into his arms and kiss him. It had been almost two weeks this time and damn, he’d really missed him.
Dean glared at him, but shook his head, wetting the toothbrush before using it. Now that he only had one arm to hold himself up, he wobbled a little more and Castiel stepped closer, pressing himself against Dean’s back.
“That for me?” Jimmy took a hold of the coffee, waiting for Dean to nod. “How’d you know I didn’t want something else this time?”
“You look like you’re freaking out,” Castiel explained, blinking groggy eyes at him. “Don’t.”
“I can tell.” Castiel was still touching the outside of his hands, where it didn’t hurt so much. “Come on, let me heal you.”
“No,” Castiel tried. “Go.”
They stay like this for the longest time until Sam finally pulls back a little. He mouthes a word that looks like Dean and she frowns. “Is Dean ok?”
“Yeah?” Castiel smirked, kissing his thigh again. “It’s gonna feel a lot better soon, just be patient.”
“Your Latin really is useful, though,” Dean mused. “I should have Ana show you the spell to send messages to our allies. It’s better if you both know it.”
When Cas came back out, hard cock bobbing with every step, condom still on but sliding down because he didn’t keep a hold of it, he looked so ridiculous that Dean just had to laugh.
Was that a no? Dean was about to entice him further, when Castiel suddenly picked him up and slung him over his shoulder in a fireman’s carry. Dean yelped, not expecting Castiel to be able to lift him, but here he was, being carried to the bedroom and unceremoniously dumped on the bed.
“Guess I still had some of your juice left in me, huh?” Dean remarked and Castiel squinted, not laughing. This should not be possible. That’s now how his powers worked.
Castiel’s smile brightened. “Nonsense. I keep telling you, you deserve this and more.”
Dean shrugged. “This is nothing like what you were doing though.”
“Only like half the movie,” Charlie scolded him cheerfully. Castiel gave her a look but then forced a smile onto his face as well.
All in all, they really were a smart species, and Dean was glad their daughter apparently had enough of Castiel’s DNA to reap all the benefits. She could heal Castiel, and was growing up so quickly they would be able to take her along on their trips soon. As it was, Dean and Cas still took turns, deeming it too dangerous for her yet. She was just too curious, touching everything. If she got snatched up by the vines, or had a run in with one of the boars,  or those tentacle monsters pulled her under in the river...
Not needing to be told twice, Dean thanked her and went outside to where Castiel’s yoga admirers would probably be ogling him again. Maybe Dean had really missed him all day and was feeling a little jealous of those who got to spend more time with Castiel than he did today.
“Oh,” Castiel’s whole face lights up and he pulls the pig back towards his body, gently petting him. Dean pulls his own hand back, but not before their fingers touch again and Dean has never been jealous of a guinea pig before, but… dammit.
allergic to peppermint,” Castiel was quick to say. After Dean just gave him a confused look, he elaborated further. “I was a little afraid that if we kissed later, I’d have a reaction. But if you only had a sip, we should be ok.”
It had to be painted in blood and Ana insisted both he and her used their own, in the hopes that one of them would work. He wasn’t quite sure what difference a blood type could make, but Castiel didn’t mind cutting his hand if it meant avoiding death by snake.
He pulled away and slid out of bed before he could second guess himself, feeling a pang of guilt when Dean looked at him dejectedly with his sad green eyes. Castiel sighed and walked around the bed to Dean’s side, holding out his hand.
Dean had a really hard time connecting this gentle man to the cult leader he had expected to meet going in. Maybe Castiel himself was being played too and someone else was the brains behind the operation. They still didn’t even know just what the operation was though. Either it was drugs or weapons or prostitution, but it must be
Not wanting to miss his chance, Dean got directions for the class and headed there. Castiel was stretched into a complicated but sensual looking pose, head tilted towards the sun, when he arrived. Most of his students were copying his pose, but none of them did so as gracefully, or made it look as easy.
“We still have all weekend,” Castiel informed him. “I don’t want you dehydrated by the end of it.”
Dean sighed and sunk a little further down on the couch. “Haven’t thought about it in a while.”
Castiel joined the effort and was there just in time to help drag Dean back on board. Ana followed gracefully, wringing out her red hair before whipping it over her shoulder. Her wet blouse clung to her skin, but none of the men leered at her. In fact they all looked in awe and full of respect.
“Could you… I mean, I saw your browser page the other day. And I did some research myself…” Dean was fidgeting, face aflame.
“Oh hey. I have found the only reporter in America with a moral code. What is wrong with you, dude? Did they not cut this out of you at college?” He leaned closer conspiratorially. “Have you found the secret to withstand brainwashing?”
“The fairest of them all,” Castiel laughed, feeling elated and comforted in knowing that whatever they had, it was going to continue. He cupped Dean’s face in his hands and captured his lips in a hungry kiss before Dean could protest any more.
“Cas, don’t.” Dean cupped Castiel’s cheek and Castiel turned his head, kissing his palm. “It’s… too much.”
“Oh, I told you that?” Castiel faked surprise. That’s why he would always come out on top. He had learned to play the long games and always covered his bases with a fall guy at the ready.
He had to speak with Jimmy though. Make sure he knew he was always welcome to stay over. His joke the other night about kicking Jimmy out hadn’t landed so well. But hopefully they’d reach a stage in their relationship where they would all feel comfortable and reassured enough for them to be able to say dumb things without hurting each other.
“I have no other friends.” Castiel tensed up but tried to calm himself down again before he woke up Dean.
He was saved from his misery when Joanna just snorted and left him alone. As soon as the lanky guy left with a handshake, Castiel moved in. “I hear you’re looking for crew?”
Castiel dared a glance back, as well, and was surprised to find a swarm of mermaids swimming towards them, their tails visible because they were swimming close to the surface now, more and more of them emerging. Did they… come to feast on more men falling overboard, or come to help? Sam seemed hopeful.
Castiel chuckled, sitting down on the edge of the bed and trailing his fingers through Dean’s hair teasingly. “What do you want?”
“No,” Cas chuckled, throwing his sweater and shirt behind him. “Just let me get my shoes off first.” He threw him a shy grin, sitting up so he could reach down. But after the first shoe was off, he glanced up again. “Unless this is too fast for you?”
Wincing again, Dean made a face. “Adler will have my ass if I sign any more of these. I’m really sorry, Angel. But please, I hope you know that it’s ok to leave. I don’t want you to work for free.”
Dean and Castiel found a pathway that led further up toward the mountains and they followed it for about half an hour until they reached a dip in the hills that had trees which, unlike the ones in the forest, seemed to contain fruit. Excitedly, Dean ran over and picked one up, sniffing it. The tantalizing scent was enough to convince him to risk a bite, but as he opened his mouth Castiel whacked it out of his hand.
“Cas.” Dean‘s voice is sharp. “Look at me,” he commands. Castiel‘s eyes snap up. “You were. You
“No shame in watching a little porn,” Jimmy tried to reassure him. “Though I personally prefer a bigger screen.” But then, he also had excellent protection on his own devices.
“Morning,” Castiel mumbled, voice even rougher than usual. He cleared his throat and scratched his head, blinking a few times until his lips finally moved into a genuine smile. “Dean,” he said.
Now that part Castiel could relate to. As would Dean. However, the both of them also knew what real tragedy was like, what poverty felt like. And Castiel would never go back. If he could provide Dean with the life he deserved, he’d do that as well. If he submitted, of course. He’d not let a Fed take him down, no matter how beautiful the agent was.
“No, but Adler would.” Castiel tilted his head. “His company would go under without you. He’d get all of the FBI to look for you and then I’d be fucked.” Castiel clucked his tongue. “In the very unfun sense of the word.”
“Cas, you ok?” Dean asked, sounding worried. He took the plate of food out of Castiel’s hands and Castiel frowned down at it.
Castiel whined. “Hot burger,“ he admitted. “Dammit.“
“Join me for yoga?” Castiel asked again and Dean frowned.
Henriksen shook the empty container. “Follow me.”
“Yes, I fucking really am a big, big fan. Please just let me say hi. I promise not to be embarrassing.” Sam pleaded.
“I admit this tea tastes good,” Dean concluded when he sat the mug back down. “Definitely better than your weirdo toothpaste.”
“Cas,” Dean moaned when they closed the door behind them and he could back Castiel up against it. “I need you.”
“You gotta trust someone,” Jimmy stated. “Who else do you have?” Castiel narrowed his eyes. Apparently that was the wrong thing to say. “In the hacking community,” Jimmy quickly added.
Dean stopped his train of thought. He’d never really talked with Cas about his powers. And from what he’d witnessed the night before, Castiel wasn’t a part of that community anyway. So no way could he have relayed anything. None of this was Castiel’s fault. Dean sighed and slid a little closer to the medium. Sam noticed and raised his eyebrow. But a withering look from Dean made him shut his mouth.
Dean blinked. Actually, exactly that was the question he had himself. “Why do you?”
Cas raised his eyebrow, but stuck out his tongue, twirling it around Jimmy’s finger to get a small lick of the frosting, before sucking the whole finger between his lips, looking straight at Dean as he sucked it clean. And Dean’s brain just sort of short circuited.
It was mildly concerning. Castiel didn‘t do cuddling. Or sleeping together when the sex part was over. But something about Dean had drawn him in. And he was glad he‘d followed his instinct, because the second he laid down and closed his eyes, his brain reminded him that he‘d just gotten shot at and he could have died.
“Yeah, just bring them all back, ok?” Ana looked truly worried and Castiel vowed to do his best.
“Alright, you made your point,” Dean said from somewhere far away, sounding angry. Castiel closed his eyes and shook his head. Dean. Yes. “We’ll go take care of your damn snake.”
Dean looked up and caught him staring. It caused him to flush and look back down with a private smirk and Castiel realized he was mirroring Dean’s action. Even his own cheeks felt warm. Usually he didn’t have physical reactions like that. He frowned, wondering if he should rather look into this when Sam announced he’d found a case very close by.
“True,” Dean smiled, lowering the dagger even further once they were at a safe enough distance. It was fully dark, the sea only illuminated by the faint moonlight, and as soon as the Impala was in clear sight, the shore a distant memory, Dean stepped back and waited for Sam to turn around to embrace him in a hug.
“Could be more,” Castiel teased. “And here I can touch.” He trailed his fingertips over Dean’s arm and kissed his cheek.
Once he was firmly ensconced in the comforter, eyes drooping, Castiel leaned down again. “Good boy,” he whispered, placing a soft kiss on Dean’s forehead. It made Dean’s whole body tingle with warmth and he closed his eyes on a happy sigh.
“I… I…” Dean looked at Castiel’s hands, feeling the warmth emanating from them. He couldn’t give this up. Not yet. “Can I… can we talk tomorrow? I’m feeling really wiped out right now. I think maybe I’ve not fully recovered after all.”
“Maybe. Didn’t want to take my chances. I couldn’t be sure you’d truly found another ally.” Sam looked at Castiel with a smile.
In any case, he insisted on consecutive rooms. After parking the car as close as possible, in case they needed to make a hasty escape, they made their way to the rooms. “Anyone need anything from the vending machine?” He asked as they passed it.
Castiel’s mouth felt dry and he quickly grabbed his coffee, taking a small sip, then another, then one more, and then he just held the mug in front of his lips, inhaling the steam and decidedly not looking at Jimmy. He thought he’d be over this. That it was too late. But… his heart broke all over again and a warmth spread throughout his whole body, replacing the cold it had come to associate with Jimmy.
“Thanks for being honest, Sir. I promise to always be honest with you?” Dean tried.
“On a Saturday?” Dean started. “Usually an egg white omelette.”
The alien held out his hand and said something, but Castiel couldn’t understand him. Shit. Of course they don’t understand his language. “I’m sorry. I don’t speak your language,” Castiel replied and by the way the alien recoiled, it was clear that he didn’t understand him, either.
Dean shrugged. “Saving that for when you dirty me up again after lunch.” He winked. “If I wash my hair too often, it’s gonna get too soft. Especially with your inferior product.”
were going home?”
“At no point do we ever have to invite Jimmy into our bed, I need you to know that.” Castiel continued and Dean started squirming. “Dean,” he warned.
“Whu?” Dean blinked uncomprehendingly, following Castiel. But Castiel held out his arm to keep Dean at bay.
“Yeah, sure.“ Dean sighed, a little subdued. He opened the lid of his burger and saw Castiel do the same. The mood was ruined, but he didn‘t know what to say to change it. They only just had sex. Dean had no right to demand anything.
“Any siblings?” Castiel wanted to know.
“Of course, Dean.” Castiel smiled. “I won’t let you out of my sight as long as you’re not feeling well.”
“You like cartoons?” Castiel asked when he saw that Dean was almost done with his salad.
She might not know the full extend of Castiel’s involvment, but she wasn’t stupid. She’d been around a lot longer than Dean. She must know that he wasn’t all innocent. But she’d been so willing to accept everything was Meg’s fault, he didn’t worry about what she’d tell the FBI. She wouldn’t implicate him.
“Can’t let him stay in there alone thinking…” Dean can feel a sob rising up again and fuck it all. He’s been so good at repressing it lately. Does Hell have alcohol? It should, right?
Dean snorted. “As if they wouldn’t hang us either way,” he whispered. “I can’t believe this worked. How stupid are they?”
They made it back to their shelter by what Dean guessed was mid-day. Both suns were high in the sky and it was becoming really hot. Dean put the wood inside their hide-out and was about to crawl inside when Castiel grabbed his arm and shook his head.
“Is that his name? We haven’t been able to ID him yet. So if you have any further information?” Dean prompted.
“Fiend,” Castiel complained. “If you think I’m just gonna let you go to sleep in my bed on your own, you’re sorely mistaken.” Dean looked disturbed for a moment, but Castiel quickly got up and offered him a hand to get off the couch. “Because I’m definitely gonna be joining you.”
Castiel gripped two bottles and muttered the spell, Sam doing the same. He handed one off to Dean and they all stepped toward the railing, looking at the struggling Kraken. He’d almost made it out of the net, but was now bleeding profusely from a thousand small wounds.
Castiel itched to feel more of Dean though and he slipped his hands underneath his shirt, pulling it up. When Dean raised his arms so Castiel could pull it off, he also used the momentum to bend Dean backwards, following him to kiss and lick at his chest.
“Cat?” he asked.
Dean nudged him with his foot. “It’s just hard to believe because you’re so…” Dean gestured and Castiel’s blinding smile returned.
“What?” Castiel repeated, his voice smaller now. He could feel Dean take his hand and squeeze in support, but his ears started ringing anyway.
“No.“ Dean vehemently shook his head.
Jimmy’s lip trembled but he nodded. Dean looked equally disappointed. Castiel rolled his eyes. “Don’t worry, Dean. You’re still gonna get filled.” Dean perked up. “Get your cute butt on the bed and present.”
When Castiel noticed Dean’s eyes beginning to droop, he roused him again. “Time to put you to bed,” Castiel announced, realizing it was better to not even ask if Dean wanted to stay. Castiel definitely didn’t trust him to be alone yet, so he didn’t even give him the option.
Castiel closed his eyes and allowed himself the familiar comfort of Jimmy by his side. His brother, helping him. Hugging him. Being there for him. It was all going to be ok. It was all going to be ok. He could relax now. Jimmy had him.
Dean wasn’t sure what it was, but Castiel basically commanding him to leave seemed to have given his brain permission to shut up about it and let him go home without a bad conscience at leaving work behind. Castiel had a point. It would still wait for him tomorrow. And he couldn’t even remember the last time when he’d actually finished all his tasks for the day before having to give up from sheer exhaustion, because as soon as he’d finished one task, two more seemed to pop up in a new email.
Dean took a peek into the mug. The usual latte art was missing and he was slightly disappointed, but Castiel had at least still steamed his almond milk for him instead of pouring it in cold. “Thank you, that will be all for now.” Dean dismissed him, but before Castiel could leave, Dean called him back. “Oh, wait.”
“It’s not gonna be a punishment if you enjoy it, is it?” Castiel explained.
Dean hummed. “Yeah, ok. Or maybe you can help us and we take her down first.” He only briefly glanced at Jimmy before searching out Castiel’s eyes and giving him a pointed look. And by the way Castiel was looking at the ground, he figured Cas leaving was not a plan Dean was on board with. And why should he?
“Yeah, well, you killed Cas,” Dean accuses, though deep down he knows it isn’t true.
Dean paused. Did Castiel view him as something serious now or was this just because the article would be a nice way to come out? Shit. He really wasn‘t ready for any of this talk. “Only if you feel the time is right, Cas. I don‘t want to make this into a bigger deal than it needs to be. I‘m ok to hide in the bedroom and leave 10 minutes after you tomorrow or take a seperate car or something.“
So instead, he visited the chickens.
Castiel could see why other men would try to mingle with them, but they held nothing on the beauty of the captain of this vessel and… Castiel stopped his train of thought with a flush, realizing his gaze had shifted from the mermaids to the man in question.
Castiel placed his hand over Dean’s and looked up at his friend, noticing that he was torn between glaring at Jimmy and giving him a soft, concerned look. “It’s not Jimmy’s fault,” Castiel explained. “He just gave me bad news.”
True to his word, he wasn’t disturbed until he’d sat back at his desk and gave Castiel a thumb’s up.
“No.” Dean glanced up at the sun. He could tell that it was beginning to set, but that was all. “How do you do that?”
“Uhm.” Dean wriggled his toes but then stood more firmly. Castiel could tell from the tension in his back.
“She was waiting for me when I got home,” Castiel explained and before he could continue, Jimmy interrupted him.
“Yeah, it’s really getting me places,” Castiel remarked darkly. “Damp, dark places without sunlight.”
“We should’ve hired someone,” Mildred mused. “I could’ve paid for an accountant.”
Dean nodded. “I’d go and buy a replacement tomorrow, but…” He trailed off. Dean didn’t have the funds. They both knew it. Castiel didn’t have the funds either.
,” Castiel mocked him. “Only one kind of shower gel but ten different hair products, huh?”
“And you’re focused now?” Dean questioned. “You just added more milk than coffee.”
“We’re gonna go to bed,” Castiel suggested, moving over to his kitchenette and getting out his herbs again to brew them another tea. Dean had followed, looking at his herbal collection curiously. Good thing he’d hidden the shrooms in the back.
“Well, that’s… good?” Dean was still regarding him warily.
“Soon,” Dean replied, not moving anything other than the hand he was still stroking through Castiel’s hair.
Castiel must have noticed the change in his expression because before Dean could explode, he’d swiped a bottle of Whiskey and led Dean out of the room.
So they did.
Dean got up from his chair and went in for a full body embrace instead. He buried his face in Castiel’s neck and breathed in deeply. “Thank you,” he mumbled, clinging tightly. They stayed like this for a few minutes, Castiel stroking Dean’s hair and holding on with his other arm until they eventually separated. “Thanks, for… uhm… everything,” Dean repeated, this time looking Castiel in the eyes.
“Cold,” Castiel decided. But then he remembered that icy cold drinks actually made you sweat more and if there’s one thing he definitely didn’t want right now, it was to sweat more. “No wait. Hot.”
“Would you… would you still like me if…” Dean nibbled at his lower lip again. “If I were less… buff, you know?” He pulled the blanket tighter around himself. “More… twinky?”
“You know?” Jimmy gestured randomly. Dean must know what he was asking. He wasn’t stupid, just apparently stubborn.
“Not tonight, I won’t.” Castiel shrugged.
“Fuck. Seriously, I don’t even think I need you anymore, Jimmy. This is so much better.” Castiel babbled, because it really felt amazing. But when Jimmy stared at him, face ashen, he realized he’d gone a little too far. “C’mere,” he demanded, reaching out his free hand towards his brother.
Jessica shared another look with Garth. “Is that what the pills were for, Castiel? To drown out the noises?”
He made it for almost an hour before he decided to sneak down into the kitchens to fetch himself a second breakfast of bacon and eggs.
He realized he should be more wary of his enemy, but Castiel was just glad that the alien hadn’t pulled his gun on him again. Castiel had only been trying to get them to safety before. The alien had been unconscious, so what was he supposed to do? Let him die alone, out there under the hot suns? But he could see why the alien wouldn’t take too kindly to Castiel dragging him along the ground like that. He’d tried a better way, but the alien had just been too heavy. He’d had to grab a leg and pull.
“I really don’t like her,” Dean whispered, leaning in.
“I’m fine.” Dean reassured him. “Nobody saw me.”
Eileen nods. He’ll tell her more when he’s ready. “Where is the body?” She inquires, wondering if he needs help to wrap him up and move him.
“Cas, we gotta give them something,” Jimmy pleaded with him.
Castiel raised his eyebrow. “So you admit to forging it?” Was this going to be easy, after all?
Castiel bit his cheek. “So you broke in the back door?”
“I definitely had reason,” Dean started. “And… and maybe in the end, it can actually help you?” Some hope returned to Dean’s gaze. “Yeah. Yeah, I guess it will ultimately help you.”
“Seriously?” Castiel asked. “You offered to suck my cock five minutes ago.” He lit up the joint and took a deep drag.
“Not that easy if you have to hold it, is it?” Castiel questioned, without bite in his voice. He kept his hand on Dean’s lower back, letting him rest for a moment. “Alright, try one more time and then we move on. This time, remember to breathe.”
Castiel himself quickly focused on Dean and helped lie him out flat. He positioned himself at Dean’s head before Ana could kneel down and started giving him mouth-to-mouth, inflating his lungs with air. With an unexpected snort, Ana joined him, pushing both hands on Dean’s chest. Did she not think Castiel could do this task?
“Dean, of course.” Castiel flipped him over and hovered above Dean. “I can’t explain it to you, because it doesn’t really make sense to me either, but I most definitely want you.” He brushed his lips over Dean’s. “All.” Brush. “The.” Another teasing brush. “Time.” He finally stayed down, giving Dean a quick and filthy kiss.
“Ruby.“ The girl shook his hand. “So what‘s it gonna be, handsome? Fight for a chance to lick Castiel‘s boot, or gonna hang out with the rest of us actual music lovers?“
Cas twirled the second package of lube between his fingers. “What do you know, it’s waterproof.” He announced and started the shower. While the water was heating up, he was watching Dean still standing at the sink, washcloth in his hand. Castiel smirked and licked his upper lip seductively, his gaze meeting Dean’s in the mirror.
Perking up at that, Dean straightened his position a little, wiggling his ass to signal he was ready.
Castiel hesitated. He’d take Dean in a heartbeat, but he had no other choice. Dean had a whole life here. Could he really do this to him?
“He doesn’t.” A deep voice interrupted them as Dean came to stand by his side. “It’s mine.”
And this had been the second time that Dean had shortened his name. He found that he didn’t mind too much; it helped him embrace the character he had to play, for now.
“Stop,” Castiel simply said. “Just stop it, Dean. Don’t presume you know what I want and what I see in you. You’re a kind, gentle person. A hard worker. You respect your peers. You don’t look down at me even though I am just your secretary.”
Dean waved him off. “It’s not your fault the FBI are pigs who keep harassing you for no reason.”
“Good.” Dean smiled and pulled away. “I want you to make out with Jimmy.” And not just because Dean was a pervert who wanted to see the twins kiss, but he needed to see if Cas was really fine with this. He knew the brothers had talked it out and Cas didn’t sound sad or bitter when talking about Jimmy anymore, but still.
“But you made sure I was never incriminated.” Dean pointed out. “I mean, even if they had found it on my device, everybody saw you using that laptop. You always just did it in my coffee shop. In plain daylight.”
“Off,” Dean demanded, pushing on Cas’ sweater and shirt in one go. Cas raised his arms but because Dean tried to be fast and rid him of both at the same time, it ended up taking longer and Cas got tangled and argh! “God dammit,” Dean cursed.
“So we can have your record cleared? Compensate you for the time you served?” Jimmy said it like it was obvious and Castiel just stared at him.
“Last night?” Balthazar perked up. “Last night what?”
Dean shrugged. “I don’t know what their problem is.”
Dean flicked a wet strand of hair out of Castiel‘s face and shook his head. Damn. He had no right to be this adorable after incredible sex. He leaned in for a closed lipped kiss and then ventured into the bedroom to look for bath robes. Of course the suite they had came with very nice, fluffy robes. And slippers, which he ignored.
“Yes,” Castiel confirmed. “Of course.” He frowned. How could Dean doubt himself? Did he never meet other people outside of work? Then again. He probably really didn’t, workaholic that he was.
Castiel didn’t reply but looked Dean over critically, probably making sure he was uninjured and not for sexy reasons. Dean’s pout grew. This morning had started so promisingly.
Dean went to his assigned bus, attempting to write, but he was just too wired. Hoping some fresh air would help, he left the bus, distracted by the sweet smell of weed wafting over. He followed his nose and found a few crew members sharing a joint. Dean grinned and after a quick round of introductions, he was invited to partake.
“Can all of you… heal?” His own side was definitely losing this war, weren’t they? Then again, it was mostly fought in space through ships. If anyone was shut down and their ship crashed or exploded before, there wasn’t much left to heal. He cringed at the thought.
“Of course not,” Dean protested. And Castiel believed him. Dean was too good a person for that. Unlike Castiel himself. That’s why Castiel’s plan had worked.
Both of Castiel’s eyebrows climbed up. “Dean, please. Your life is worth so much to me.” He placed his hands on Dean’s forearms, gently stroking his skin with his thumbs. “If you need medical help, it could never be an inconvenience. I will do whatever I can to save you.”
“Aw, come on,” Dean wheedled.
Castiel cocked his head. “Yes.” He paused and frowned. “Did you not understand?”
Castiel sighed and kissed Dean’s chest before melting more into him. Yeah. He had a feeling that a big part of his new job would be to keep Dean alive, which seemed to have been solely Ana’s job so far. They would probably get along just fine. And assuming they all survived the upcoming battles, he looked forward to fighting alongside Dean Winchester’s infamous crew.
“I don’t want that.” Castiel frowned. “You’re the best boss I’ve ever had.” He held up his hand before Dean could protest. “I do mean that, Dean. You’re always fair and you’re never demeaning. I like working for you.”
“I’ll help you,” Castiel offered, stroking over Dean’s back to get him to straighten it out. He had to touch his tummy to get him into a better position and couldn’t help but trail his fingertips over Dean’s side again, tickling him once more.
“You hadn’t before today?” Castiel asked, kind smile back on his face. “Why?”
“Shit, no,” Dean shuddered a bit and it made Castiel feel dirty so he scooted away towards the passenger door. “But he does.” Dean pointed at Castiel.
He was a good sailor and even better at following the rules, so Castiel had climbed the ranks quickly enough that he was still more of an unknown face within the Navy—and especially outside of the Navy. Perfect for the job. He just didn’t expect to have to care for chickens or help out in the kitchen. Of course he lied and said he had experience, because really, how hard could it be?
And while Castiel had been itching to go back to Earth, he had also been dreading it. Facing Dean after his confession… He never thought he’d have to do that. So he readily accepted Jack’s request to help him restructure Heaven.
Cas got lucky at the coffee shop and also found a job as bike messenger, so by February he was able to pay Dean some rent. When Sam came down for Dean’s birthday that month, Cas offered to move out for the time being or at least sleep on the couch, but Dean wouldn’t hear it. Sam slept on the couch and got along really well with Cas. Dean overheard them one night, when Sam was thanking Cas for looking after Dean and how Sam was really glad his brother wouldn’t be alone and he could attend Stanford with a good conscience.
“Oh,” Dean sat up straighter. “Listen, you don’t have to bother for me. If you want to go on your run and do your usual routine…”
“Boys?” Ana called down to them. “Can you finish this once you’re on deck? I’d rather set sail and get the hell out of here.”
“What does this mean?” Castiel asked.
Or maybe they didn’t want the soldiers to be so distracted with beauty that they forgot that the enemy was still deadly.
“Fuck,” Dean moaned. “You just know how to push all my buttons, Special Agent.” He slid a foot to rub up against Castiel’s calf, slowly moving higher.
Dean sighed happily and snuggled into the pillow, the tension slowly oozing out of him. He didn’t feel the need to clench his eyes as hard anymore, but he still kept them closed. Castiel was rubbing his earlobes now and it would feel weird, but it was
A loud sound from the TV distracted him and he reached for the remote, switching it off. Suddenly he was assaulted with Jimmy and Cas very audibly moaning into their kisses and he wanted in on that. “Ok, stop,” he commanded and they broke apart, looking at him expectantly. “Join me?” He asked, patting the couch.
She faltered a bit but then rolled her eyes. “Fine, don’t tell me then. But I hope you get the job and that brings you out of my hair and off Dean’s wallet.”
Castiel chuckled and kissed the top of his head, picking up the lube and towels. “I’ll be right back,” he promised and vanished towards the bedroom.
He could understand why Jimmy left though. They would still need a little time to figure out just how they all fit. Castiel was still in a relationship with Dean. That wouldn’t change. And he somehow doubted that either of them would feel comfortable if it was just Castiel and Jimmy or just Dean and Jimmy without Castiel present. But who knew. Maybe that would change over time.
Before they could start anything, Castiel opened his bedside table drawer and got out the massage oil he had stashed there a few days ago. “Listen, Dean, uhm… This is all I have.” He showed him the oil. “I’m good to wait until we get out of here.” He’d happily find other ways to take Dean apart, but he figured he should give him the option.
“I don’t know who told you that, but Dean, you could gain forty pounds and still be attractive. Hell, more even.” Castiel shook his head. “Attraction isn’t just the shape of your body.”
Castiel chuckled. “I’d rather wake up with you by my side though.”
“You’d have a whole harem of beautiful women doing that for you though,” Dean offered, wiggling his eyebrows.
A few groupies outright hissed at him as he entered backstage. Before he could start an argument however, Ruby pulled him fully into the room and handed him a drink.
Castiel moved closer, bumping into his shoulder. “I’m glad you’re here, Dean. Usually my weekends are a lot more boring.”
“I know.” Castiel was floored. Not only would this get him off without a trial but… he could be honest with Dean. More honest. He definitely wouldn’t be able to tell him everything. Maybe one day. Definitely not before the trail was over. Or… Well, he’d see. But… “Would you find out? What I confessed to?”
Dean’s face was stoic. “Thank you for returning my laptop. Goodbye.”
“Always trying to get yourself out of these lessons,” Castiel scolded good naturedly.
“Good plan,” Dean nodded and gave him another peck. “But for the record, if you’re still leaving after that, you will take me with you.”
Dean shuddered and pulled back with a raised eyebrow. “Am I gonna survive this?”
But Castiel didn‘t notice anything off. He kissed Dean‘s cheek and slid out of bed. “I‘m going to take a quick shower. Can you call in? A cheeseburger for me and whatever you want.“
There was a snort from somewhere behind him and when he turned around, a tall, beautiful redheaded woman stepped into view. “Don’t tell me you recruited a moron,” she chided Dean as she elbowed her way in.
“Oh,” Castiel frowned, abandoning his task. “Do you want one?” He looked at his remaining two eggs a little guiltily.
“Couldn’t risk this one betraying you, no matter what you wrote,” Sam replied.
“Do not finish that sentence,” Dean snarled and Ana stepped between them.
Castiel nodded. Finally he’d be able to set the last piece in motion. Though he mourned his earlier post-dinner plans of spreading Dean out on the bed and having a feast.
It was a quickly scribbled note from Mildred. Apparently Meg had woken up and seemed very angry, even more so than usual and Mildred was worried. Underneath the note, Castiel found a second note, from the looks of it having been left earlier. It just said that sandwiches were waiting for them by the door and to have fun.
, Dean.” Castiel looked into his eyes imploringly, making himself appear smaller, non-threatening.
Castiel bit back a snarky remark. He had to remember to keep Meg calm and appeased, so she wouldn’t get any more suspicious than she already was. “Hard detox. Make him think he’s got the flu. Maybe throw him in the sweat lodge for a day. Then I’m gonna break his heart. He’s gonna be so devastated, he won’t be able to think straight. He’s just gonna leave and think nothing illegal went on here. He had a nice time until he fucked it up and I had to discard him.”
Castiel started playing with Dean’s hair, because right now he still could. “If that had been my plan, I’d definitely cancel my wedding for you.” He wasn’t even lying. He’d never fit this well with anyone before. “I’m leaving. Tomorrow.”
Dean snorts. “I hadn’t thought of that until you sugegsted it just now.”
“You can’t leave the country, you’ll be arrested on the spot if you try,” Jimmy reminded him. But he had a feeling his brother already knew.
So either they knew he would find it anyway and didn’t bother or they knew he’d look and wanted to leave him paranoid that they were better than him if he didn’t find anything. But there was no way that was the case. He ground his teeth.
“Yes, much,” Dean replied honestly. Castiel was magic. No wonder people flocked around him. “Thank you.”
Castiel caught Charlie’s wink before he proceeded to lie some more.
Rowena agreed to stick around for a few days while they explored this further, as long as they kept her updated. She really seemed invested in their relationship. Dean couldn’t tell what her angle was, but they’d deal with it once it would reveal itself.
“My juice?” Dean asked, hopefully, but Castiel just gave him a baleful look in reply.
Cas waved him off before grabbing the cookie, his whole face lighting up when he realized it was still warm. Dean couldn’t help but mirror the smile. “Thanks,” Cas replied and then took a large bite and moaned around his mouthful of warm cookie. It made Dean want to do a lot of things, one of them was eating a cookie himself. But he didn’t work as hard as Cas and it would only land on his hips. He’d already had some cherry pie with lunch. And much as he loved his job, it was way too full of temptations.
“What?” Castiel frowned down at her, like he’d only just realized she existed.
Dean sighed happily and as soon as Castiel had turned around, he wiggled under the comforter, effectively hiding his crotch. When Castiel came back with the face cloth freshly chilled and the promised water, Dean felt a little presumptuous though. “Uhm, I can stay here, right?”
“You should’ve thought of his livelihood before using his computer for your illegal hacking operations, brother.” Jimmy’s voice was dripping venom. “How many more innocent people will you drag down with you?”
Jimmy smiled. That was actually… considerate of him. “Shielding my little brother from your depravities. Thank you for your service,” he saluted, looking at the coffee. He hadn’t actually ordered anything yet.
Cas rolled his eyes, but he tugged his tie loose when he followed Dean back to the front of the shop. “That’s just not me, huh?”
Castiel laughed again. “Man. It’s gonna take me a while to get to your level of fucked up.” He took a deep drag and sat down on the floor cross legged. Dean looked up at him, still lying down, unable to move. Even though he knew he should. “You’re new.” Castiel observed.
“Excuse me?” Castiel asked. “Did you just insult my way of life? I thought you were here to learn it.”
“Don’t worry, Castiel.” Mildred now cupped his face with both of her hands, trying to comfort him. “I still remember how mad you were when Meg refused to just use your more expensive blend for everybody. I’ll make sure to tell that to the police.”
Castiel melted into him, but then pushed back. “Dean, I’m not… I don’t think this is a good idea.”
Dean raised an eyebrow in challenge. “Not even a little bit?” He crossed his arms above his head in a submissive gesture.
Balthazar looked frantic, but then his eyes fell onto a kitchen knife. “Do you trust me?” He asked and Castiel could only nod. At this point, yes. Most definitely. “Take the knife and slice it along your tattoo. Any part will do. Then press your right hand into it.”
He moved closer to the entrance of the cave and was putting a strain on both of his knees until he realized what he was doing. But there was no pain at all, today, so he slowly pulled himself up against the wall and tried to stand on both legs.
Dean grumbled but swung his legs over the edge of the bed. “Alright,” he sighed and passed his hands through his sleep tousled hair. Dean had probably fallen asleep again during the day. He must have looked adorable.
At 6:40 pm he finally got a text from Dean. “Too wiped, just going home. Went ok.”
Jessica looked back at Garth, who just shrugged. “I don’t know him very well. Just mixed him some sleeping aids before he stopped coming.”
The alien said something else and Castiel sighed. “We should go seek shelter,” he tried. In reply the alien snorted, shook his head and said something else. But he was waving one arm and pointing in the direction Castiel was headed, as well, so Castiel took a chance and nodded.
Dean considered this. He didn’t want to become a bother. Additionally, he should finally get back to working his case. He’d been neglecting it for a little too long.
Dean scoffed. “Get a better shower.” But he stayed on the side, looking through Castiel’s shower gels and deciding on a citrus flavored one.
Today was a warm day so Dean gets treated to him in just slacks and a white shirt, top two buttons undone. Not like he isn’t also sexy in that rumpled trench coat of his but Dean feels especially blessed. The guy has dark unruly hair and the most stunning blue eyes Dean’s ever seen, especially when they get shiny at watching the guinea pigs.
“No, that’s his name. His real name. Clarence Allen,” Meg instisted.
“Come on, Cassie, introduce us.” Balthazar smirked. “Then maybe I will tell you the clue.”
Castiel’s eyebrows went up and his lips went down, smile gone. “Ok then.”
“Alright, listen. I wasn’t lying about the cargo. I thought it was looted art getting shipped in, but you’re telling me it was people?” Bela uncrossed her arms. “Looks like we both got played.”
Castiel touched his thigh under the table and Dean looked at him, again instantly calmed down. “This isn’t a competition,” Castiel said quietly. “You’re a great detective.”
“Spent a lot of time outside,” Castiel replied, looking too uncomfortable to be talking about scouts or anything else that might have been fun reasons for it.
The next morning, Dean woke up to Castiel already awake and stoking the fire, a hand on his belly and a serene expression on his face. “Good morning, sunshine. Feeling better?”
“Will I like it?” Dean questioned, getting up with a wary look.
The alien didn’t hesitate any further and dropped down to his knees, cupping both hands and drinking greedily. Then he dunked his whole head into the stream and came up laughing and wet, shaking his head. Droplets flew everywhere and some landed on Castiel’s cheek.
Castiel raised his eyebrow. “Did you just insult burgers? That‘s a mean thing to say.“
Dean’s shoulders tensed. Caught. “Naturally,” he mumbled.
“I didn’t….” Jimmy got interrupted when his cellphone rang and he jumped, not even looking at it. But his body language changed to less aggressive immediately and all the color drained from his face. “God dammit, Chaos. I wasn’t…”
“Maybe Dean will decide to stay,” Castiel suggested.
Cas says nothing, then, “Oh.” His mouth falls open and he tries to process. Dean smiles. Still so clueless. A true Winchester in spirit. Not believing he was worthy, too. Always focused on the rest of them.
“But Dean… I don’t really know anything.” Castiel bit his lip. This was a conundrum. Of course he knew things, but… not as far as Dean was concerned.
After explaining what he’d seen in the time piece, Balthazar made Castiel look up the blonde girl in one of their magic forums. She wasn’t even too hard to find. Jessica Moore ran a prominent magic shop in town, selling trinkets and offering palm readings in the front, but apparently having a vast array of real magical supplies in the back.
“No?” Dean looked deeply displeased but Castiel was ready to get the fuck out of here. He grabbed his trenchcoat and then joined Dean, taking ahold of his arm and starting to drag him out of the warehouse. “Hey!” Dean protested, but Castiel wordlessly walked them both away from the building.
? Their armor seemed impenetrable and encompassed their whole bodies, hence it had earned them the nickname Tin Cans. Maybe Dean would just piss it off by firing at it?
Dean’s flush deepened but he ground out a little gruffly, “Anything else?”
Not a happily drugged up member, Dean decided. But someone who apparently wanted to look capable in front of Castiel. He tried to apologize, but the commotion had disrupted the class and Castiel had definitely noticed him by now. Dean was proven right when Castiel was standing next to them before the girl was even done with her tirade.
He wondered who took care of Castiel. If they were alike in that sense. Dean really wanted to reciprocate. “Castiel?” He asked, waiting for the other man to look up and meet his eyes. “What can I do for you?”
It worked. Meg arrived, eyes going wide, expression thunderous. Castiel held her gaze, daring her to make a scene, so he could publically raise Dean up and knock her down at the same time, but she didn’t give him the satisfaction. Instead she schooled her face into a fake pleasant smile, inclined her head demurely and sat down at the long table with the rest of his followers. Well, she wasn’t dumb. It’s why she was his partner, after all.
“I was never in any closet, Dean.“ Castiel sat down and pointed for Dean to do the same. “The media just assumes everyone is straight until people make a big announcement to say otherwise. That is not my fault. It‘s yours.“
Castiel shrugged. “It’s double research. I study my specimens and Balthazar studies me. He’s a fellow professor and is going to see if prolonged isolation is going to make research more effective or if it’s eventually counter productive.”
“Alright, fine.” Jimmy rolled his eyes and then shifted in his seat, suddenly uncomfortable. Castiel was afraid he’d continue with the conversation they were skirting around, but instead he turned his laptop around. “Congratulations, you have a new account on the Cayman Islands.”
“Unfamiliar surroundings?” Castiel guessed. “Too quiet?”
Resting his head on Dean’s thigh so he didn’t have to look at him, Castiel groaned. “Either.” He hated that he had to even ask this, but hopefully it would help ground him. Remind him that he was definitely with Dean and nobody else.
“Always,” Dean said, squeezing Castiel’s hand. “You hear me?
Well, according to his editor he was, but Dean himself wanted to write about the whole experience. The world didn’t need another article praising the elusive Castiel’s genius.
Or maybe he
“Oh, yes.” Castiel preened. “I will heal faster, too.”
“The bike messenger,” Dean said, looking in the rearview mirror to get a reaction.
“The flu?” Dean frowned. He wasn’t congested or anything. He just had a headache.
When Dean returned, the door banged open and Castiel turned around in surprise. Dean seemed surprised to see him still reading, but his expression quickly changed to neutral. “Guess you’ll get a chance to leave sooner rather than later. We should be in Port Fairhaven within a day.”
Dean‘s mouth falls open and a tear threatens to escape. Sammy‘s made it. He really died of old age. “Thank you,” he says.
He’d love to swallow him down again, but it had been a while for Castiel and now that Dean was fully erect, it probably wouldn’t go as well. Still, he tried, until he had to pull off and gag, breathing hard. Dean’s hand in his hair was loose, soothing and petting him more than directing him and he was reminded that Dean was definitely not like any of his old partners, from back when his life was very different and…
Castiel ate the disgustingly sweet fruit and wondered why Dean suddenly seemed to be suspicious of him. He kept giving him squinty looks, like when they first met. Did he still not trust him? His suit had quickly determined that the fruit he was currently ingesting was safe for Ceruleans. But when he‘d pointed it at Dean, it had concluded that there was a 20% chance the fruit would kill him, but an 84% chance that it would weaken him enough for Castiel to easily kill him with his bare hands. That had been enough for him to keep Dean from biting it by slapping it out of Dean‘s hands.
Meg shook his hands off and took a few steps back. She shuddered and pointed at him, but no words came out. At last, she just turned around and walked away, leaving Castiel to grin at her retreating form.
Cas slumped into the seat but eyed the cup holder with the two cups inside. Jimmy handed him his and Cas mumbled an almost inaudible thanks before taking a large gulp. “Alright,” he stated. “Talk.”
When they were done, Dean took the tray away and heaved a sigh. “So, we should talk about this.”
Once he’d made it and felt the sunlight directly on his face again, he breathed a sigh of relief. Not only would he need both legs to squat when the egg came, but he felt a lot better now that he would be able to grab her and run if need be. He realized that, so far, they’d been safe in this cave, but he should definitely not rely on it.
Dean looked up. So this was going to become a regular thing? He definitely wouldn’t mind it. Probably. They still had to talk about boundaries at work and expectations and… “It actually tastes better like this. With normal milk,” Dean admitted instead, because it was easier to give one tiny truth than to continue his train of thought.
“Oh no.” Mildred’s face fell. “But he makes you so happy.”
He opened the door with an authoritative bang and then sat down with a displeased look on his face, slamming down the file on the table. “Winchester. You belong behind bars.”
“Shh,” Castiel slowed down his thrusts and instead twisted his thumb over the sensitive head of Dean’s cock. “Open your eyes, Dean.”
Dean beamed. Damn right it was. He wouldn’t object to appropriating more of those super soft shirts though. “I’m gonna raid your closet while you sleep and then steal away into the night,” Dean threatened, leaning in and kissing Castiel before he could reply.
Castiel stared at it, at the number presented, and then looked back at Jimmy, all the color drained from his face. “Did you set this up?”
“I’ll be the judge of that,” Jimmy decided, confiscating the notebook.
cat toys, even if the actual cat has to go?”
“Well, hot damn,” Dean could hear one of the groupies next to them. “You think they’d let me join that? I’d be ok to just watch.” And Dean had to break the kiss because he had to laugh too much.
“Do you have a place to stay when we close this place down?” Dean asked, before he was too distracted.
Dean just shrugged at the brush-off. “Alright, Grumpy. Are you ready to go in?”
“A lot less dangerous, too.” Dean once again didn’t find it funny.
Dean nodded and they shared a sad look. Yeah. So much for their one day. But they’d soon get many more.
“Lie down,” Castiel ordered, once they’d reached his room. Dean happily complied, kicking off his sandals before lying down on top of the comforter with a sigh. He could hear rustling coming from the bathroom but closed his eyes to block out the light.
Jimmy smiled at Dean and patted his back, letting him know he’d definitely helped them a lot.
“I believe you,” Castiel replied, then held out his free hand. “Now be good and give me the toy.”
“Shut up, the both of you.” Dean’s strong voice boomed through the room. “What kind of impression are you giving our newest crew member? You’d think we were lawless pirates, or something.” There was loud cheering to that, people raising their mugs and toasting each other. It diffused the situation and both guys sat down.
Castiel knelt down on the bed where Jimmy had been before and stroked and petted Dean until his shivers had subsided a little bit. “Shh, shh, baby. I’ll give you your reward, just as promised. You earned it. So good to me.”
The alien blinked at him and then produced a round object which he dipped into the water to collect some. Oh. That was smart. He held it up proudly and Castiel nodded, because the alien was apparently not learning his language. He shrugged and took another drink. That would last him until the morning, hopefully.
Three days later, they also had pants and another shirt each. There was still some fabric left, but Castiel stashed it away for later. The next day, Dean caved and asked if he could use it as a blanket. After Castiel understood what that was, he readily agreed—and apologized for not realizing it sooner. Apparently, the alien’s blood ran a lot hotter, which was ironic, since it was blue.
“I’ll eat whatever you make,” Dean promised him, able to do so because he knew it would end up being scrambled eggs and bacon, and probably some toast.
Dean rolled his eyes. “You’re a real lightweight. What ship did you say you served on before?”
Slowly, Castiel was able to make out the alien’s language’s structure and if he was lucky, he’d pick up a few words by nightfall. He looked up at the sky. Two suns, one of them just starting to set. Whenever nightfall might be.
Castiel sighed and looked at the clock. It was 8:30 pm on a Friday and Dean was still hard at work. He knew it was well within his rights to leave, Dean wouldn’t even be mad. There were no more appointments and there most likely wouldn’t be any incoming calls to field either. Everyone else had already gone home to be with their families, or at least had the decency to not call other people and expect them to still work at this godforsaken hour. But… he didn’t want to leave Dean all by himself.
“Wait,” Dean protested. “Shouldn’t we move her closer to the fire? Keep her with us?”
“Dean did what?” Castiel pretended to be shocked even though he was sure Meg wouldn’t buy it.
“What?” He asked her harshly, reigning in his temper to close the door behind him softly.
“Right. I keep forgetting you really are exactly the hippie you look like,” Dean nudged him, but readily snatched the last slices of bacon off the plate.
“What?” Castiel frowned. Fattening him up? He’d specifically chosen healthy sandwiches in the hopes that Dean would eat them.
“I’ll say.” Dean brought their still joined hands to his lips and kissed Cas’s, then let go to pull him down for a proper kiss.
“You’re a good person, Castiel,” Dean told him, squeezing his hand. He would have to find a way to talk more later, now that he had an opening.
“No, I really don’t,” Castiel admitted, hanging his head in defeat before he reached out to move Dean into a better position. “Alright, if you’re doing this, you might as well do it right. Back straight.”
“No,” Castiel ducked away from Dean’s lips, which landed on his throat instead, licking and sucking. He couldn’t hold in a moan and buried his hand in Dean’s hair. “But we really shouldn’t…”
After placing a few kisses on Castiel’s cheeks, Dean gently spread them and started kissing his pucker. When his tongue came out to lick Castiel’s rim, Castiel finally let out a tell tale groan that let him know he was awake. Good. Now Dean didn’t need to be so gentle anymore.
Castiel hummed in reply, already half asleep.
Sam holstered his gun and crouched down, closer to Castiel. “Help keep the seas safe?”
“Jesus Christ, you’re really bad at this.” Dean clucked his tongue, scolding him. “You’re lucky you’re cute.” He pumped Castiel’s cock a few times before getting distracted again. “Keep it clean? What does that even mean?”
And with that Dean feels himself shift once again and suddenly he’s in front of the Roadhouse and Bobby is there, waiting for him.
Not waiting around for a reply, he went to a box on deck and switched out his gun and his sword. Ana and Charlie shared a long look but then they joined him at the box. Curious, Castiel went over, as well.
Castiel snorted but carded his hands through Dean’s hair lovingly, anyway. “You’re lucky I love you.”
“Everything.” Castiel shrugged. “You, why you’re here, what we suspect about Meg.” Dean leaned against the counter, breathing heavily. “She deserved to know,” Castiel added. “I trust her. And look, she’s helped.”
Maybe this was all a sex thing and he should try pressing in more. Nobody in the bureau had to know that it would not actually be a hardship for Dean, sleeping with Castiel. That a part of him really, desperately, wished Castiel would take him up on his offer and make a few
—on taking them all with her and promised her guards could be trusted.
The alien flinched back, but Dean had aimed far enough away that it shouldn’t have gotten hurt. His blaster worked and the first vine fell off. After the second vine fell off the alien’s hands, the alien suddenly tumbled face down to the ground. But it was still being held up by the vines around its legs. Dean felt relieved and hoped that now that the way down wasn’t that high anymore, the alien wouldn’t break its neck in the fall.
Dean definitely didn’t protest, closing his eyes and enjoying the safe feeling of being in Castiel’s arms until they had to leave for dinner.
Well, fuck. Castiel looked on, impressed. That was hot. He couldn’t hide his delighted grin and thankfully Dean was fully focused on Meg, so she was the only one who saw it.
“Yes. I admit I’ve ignored things for too long,” Castiel replied. “I’m glad you’re here to help me figure out if I’m just paranoid or if Meg has really been abusing… this.” He’d almost said
Dean almost looked impressed. “Sadly, not sleeping soundly next to you.”
“No, no!” Castiel held up his hands. “Not like that!” He flushed and passed his hands through his hair. Though Dean was certainly even more handsome in person, and his mission did require close contact, and maybe… He flinched, coloring further. “Uhm, I, uhm…”
Dean deserved to be taken care of. And Castiel would provide that for him.
“We’ll start you off helping, since even though I like you,” Castiel leaned closer, like he was telling Dean a secret. “I can’t play favorites. We’re all equal here.” As per the ideology they were selling. Of course Castiel himself was exempt, because they still needed a leader to take care of them. And soon enough, hopefully Dean would be exempt as well.
It turned out to be more strenuous than Dean expected. Parts of it were fun, like when he could watch Castiel stretch and bend, or when Castiel abandoned his position to correct Dean’s and maybe touch him a little more than necessary. The parts Dean didn’t like were all the quiet times, when he was just supposed to hold and breathe and relax.
Somehow, he doubted that anyone had called in a burglary. And if they had, it would definitely not be a detective showing up to the scene alone.
“You realize this is the FBI and you’re handcuffed to the table? You don’t really have a choice.” Castiel opened the file to get to his notes.
“Yoga,” Castiel exclaimed before Dean could suggest sex.
Castiel grinned and let go. “But you love me anyway.” He winked. “Now enjoy the show, while it lasts.” He considered ordering Jimmy on the bed with Dean to get a close-up view once more, but Jimmy would be way too tempted to rub himself against the sheets. And this was still about him not getting any contact.
“Good to know.” Dean took a drink. “I might have something for you to read, at some point.” He pointed his spoon at Castiel and then dug into the stew. “So, how’d it go with the chickens?” Dean asked next, mouth still full.
So after a restless night, receiving a call from Dean’s number that was actually Castiel was putting him at ease a little bit. And when they left the apartment complex walking towards him hand in hand, Jimmy was equal parts happy, jealous, and relieved because this probably meant Anael had just been checking on the bugs while Cas hadn’t been home or something. Still didn’t explain why she did that herself, but he’d surely soon find out.
Cas stood up and smacked the back of Jimmy’s head in reply, before walking over to join Dean on the couch. “We can still throw you out.”
“It’s ok,” Castiel cut him off. After scanning their surroundings to make sure it was safe, he quickly leaned over to brush a kiss over Dean’s lips. “I’ll see you in a few minutes.”
Castiel placed a hand on his cheek and Dean opened his eyes, looking into Castiel’s cerulean blue ones. “You should drink more,” Castiel suggested, collecting the face cloth and helping Dean sit up. He propped him up with another pillow and after Dean emptied a bottle of water, Castiel went back to rubbing his temples.
He grunted and glared at Bass, who was working on securing the parameter. Thankfully, by now the overeager rookie knew better than to try and make small talk with him. He ducked under the police tape and entered the scene, catching his first glimpse at the corpse.
Balthazar shrugged with a smirk and looked him up and down. “Not a lot of marks. I’d have pegged Dean for a biter.”
Castiel hummed. “I never… healed someone during intercourse before.” Castiel explained. “It felt different.”
Dean collapsed on deck and started shivering. Ana frowned and touched his head. “He’s in shock, I think. You better get him out of those clothes and under some warm blankets.” She pulled her fingers through his wet hair fondly before letting go. “Maybe some additional body heat might also help.” She winked at Castiel. “He’ll be fine.”
Since arriving at the Farm, Dean had barely slept. He didn’t eat the food they gave him and just pushed it around on his plate, pretending, and he stayed away from any drink that didn’t come from a closed bottle. And by now, it was all getting to him. Why did he think this was a good idea?
“Safe,” Castiel proclaimed and handed the fruit to Dean.
“You know, after what you did to her…” Bela started.
He was no damsel in distress, and he didn‘t need a protector, but having Dean there sure calmed him down. And the sex before had also been pretty sweet. Maybe they could turn this into a regular occurrence. Without the sleeping over part. Because Castiel definitely didn’t want a repeat of that. He snorted. Yeah. He was definitely in deep denial about how much he craved to feel calm and safe again. But if he didn’t get used to it, it wouldn’t hurt when Dean inevitably found someone better later and it ended.
Dean bit his lip and looked over his shoulder. Castiel knew he wanted to lie, but instead he nodded. “A little, yeah.”
“Rowena.” He tries for a smile but grimaces instead, hurting too much. But what did he expect? It was only the beginning of his torture. He swallows, suddenly regretting his decision. “Just… just put me on a rack, but do me a favor?” He bites his lip, looking down. “Don’t let me get off of it. I can’t… not again.”
Dean sighed. “That is a good thing though. I will be able to help you, get your name cleared from all that Meg did to your community.”
Dean pouted. “But you’re so cute when you’re tired and grumpy.”
Dean accepted the clothes, grateful for everything, but still mildly frustrated. “I will,” Dean told him, walking towards the bathroom while Castiel went to his kitchenette. “Hey, Castiel?” Dean called, waiting for him to face him again. Then Dean buried one hand in his unruly locks, pulling him in for a real kiss. He didn’t drag it out, just a little teasing with his tongue, until he pulled back. “Have a nice day.” Dean winked and entered the bathroom, closing the door behind him and feeling like he’d finally gotten some power back.
The alien looked at him with a funny expression but then they both started to walk again. Castiel made sure to look out for more vines and didn’t say anything else, but the alien kept chatting the whole way.
Castiel glared at him now. “You’re weird alien lady.”
He held up his hands to show that he was unarmed when he approached them, and they didn’t raise their weapons either. When he was close enough, a new person ran towards him, wearing one of the special suits that allowed their beige wings to show freely. Castiel startled. It could be Anna, but it could also be Michael, or a distant relative sharing the same color pattern. Michael himself would be highly unlikely, rationally Castiel knew that, but he was still immensely relieved when they suddenly opened their helmet and Castiel could see Anna’s red hair spilling out. Letting out a deep breath, Castiel allowed himself to smile and hope for the best. “Anna!”
Dean could leave it there. Not his problem. In fact, the vines might actually get rid of one of his problems
Dean perked up. “You are?”
“Close the door, will you?” She asked him before he could say anything, sounding polite but still mildly threatening.
Eventually, Meg got up from the table, one of the last to finish. Most of the others were still just sitting around, waiting, because Castiel was still present. Meg wobbled when she took a step and Castiel was up in a flash, motioning for Dean to stay before he went to help her.
By the time lunch rolled around, Dean had finished his water and decided to try the community tea after all. Castiel had kind of opened his eyes to how good it could taste. After his first sip, he frowned though. It didn’t necessarily taste bad, it just tasted a little weird. And it definitely wasn’t the tea Castiel had been drinking at dinner.
And now Dean had brought himself down, too. Damn. Cas wrapped his arms around him and nuzzled into his neck. “Dean. You know I don’t just like you for your coffee.” He pecked his cheek. “Though I admit that it
Happy that he didn’t even protest, Castiel shook his head. “Nonsense. You take the bed, I can take the couch.”
“Of course,” Castiel exclaimed. “Dean, you’re the best thing that’s happened to me in such a long time. I would be devastated to lose you. The Farm, I can live without. I can start fresh somewhere else, be more careful, build something better. But you…” He cupped both of Dean’s cheeks. “You don’t even know how precious you are to me. How dear.”
The place was trashed. Loose leaves from handwritten spell books scattered around, orbs smashed, bowls broken as well as all sorts of ingredients strewn all over the place. Castiel leaned down, trying to get a reading or maybe discover another time piece, but nothing immediately revealed itself.
Dean was surprised. He never would have suspected that. Meg always seemed rude and... “But she’s so... bossy.”
“Oh,” Castiel nodded, still not really understanding. Where he came from, there was always a healer around, or they’d send for one. “Do you not have healers on your planet?” He used his own word for healer, since he didn’t know Dean’s yet.
“Would stare at me like that, too,” Dean rolled his eyes fondly before catching himself and hardening his gaze again.
Castiel could see the stress drain out of Dean’s body. “Oh, ok. That sounds better.” Dean moved further onto the bed, straddling Castiel. “Can we keep in touch though? By text messages? And maybe video chats?”
Castiel almost choked on his coffee. That was… new information. And so much worse. “He what?”
Meg looked at him for a while, then finally gestured wildly with her hands. “Gonna fill me in, or what?”
“Yeah, they didn’t work anymore.” Castiel felt defensive. “Your pills sucked.”
“Uhm, yes. Sorry. Detective.” Jessica frowned a little. “We didn’t do anything wrong, so if you’d just let us out at the next bus stop?”
“I thought we’d eventually do them together,” Castiel replied. “But I like the way you’re thinking here.” He stroked his fingers through Dean’s hair again.
Castiel decided to take him literally, because he had a point. “You’re right, Dean. I should guide you more. My apologies.” He placed his hand on Dean’s lower back to make sure he was in a straight bend and then walked behind him. “In,” he took a deep breath. “And out,” he let out his breath and took position behind Dean.
“What? No, he…” Castiel stopped, glancing towards the two-way mirror yet again. Fuck. Was he being hazed? He’d only recently transferred to the Chicago field office after a brief stint in Nebraska following his FBI training. But he’d spent years in the military before, so he was used to some posturing in front of the new guy, but he didn’t think they’d be this… childish.
Castiel smiled. Damn. He knew him too well. “Let’s call Jimmy and see if we can’t face this head on.”
“Of course not,” Jack replies. “Why would we send you to that place?”
They had fallen into a nice routine. Dean was unexpected, so Castiel had to be strict with himself to not slack off at work too much. A first for him. He’d tried to chat with Dean during the time he had reserved to go out and watch the penguins, but when Dean found out, he’d stopped chatting, scandalized, and told him he was definitely not cute enough to distract from penguins. Cas begged to differ, but Dean had a point.
Of course that didn’t mean that Dean didn’t miss the hell out of him and he smiled brightly when he saw the rest of the Angels make their way back on stage, because it meant after the encore Castiel would be all his. Anna winked at him when she passed and Dean slung an arm around Ruby. “How did we get so lucky?”
“Of course,” Dean replied. “I’m not stupid.”
“Arrest me?” Castiel’s eyes grew wide. “I thought they’re going to arrest Meg?”
“No, c’mere.” Dean pulled him back in, burying his face in Castiel’s neck and breathing in deeply. Damn. Dean had been so busy, he didn’t even realize how much he’d missed just being able to hold Castiel until just now. And it had only been a day. “Sorry you had to spend the night.”
messy black mop and Dean’s mouth fell open.
He carefully entered her room and found her passed out on the bed, still in her clothes, snoring loudly. Meg’s room had almost the same layout as Castiel’s, so he checked her cupboards first, finding a place to stash the hallucinogens which she hopefully wouldn’t notice. It didn’t look like she used it often, so he should be in luck.
“Yes,” Castiel stated, then opened the container, revealing a chicken sandwich and some coleslaw on the side. “Don’t make me hand feed you while there’s still people around.”
He closed his eyes and let out a deep breath. “Thank you.” She wasn’t that much older than him, but Anael had been with Cyber Crime longer than him. Initially they had been reluctant to let him in, given his past. Even though he had been cleared of all possible charges when Castiel got arrested, Cas was still his brother. And having a convicted felon as your brother wasn’t the best basis to establish trust with your superiors. Or colleagues. Anael had always been the exception.
“Meg?” Castiel asked, not waiting for a reply. “Yeah. My bad feeling about her just keeps growing.”
“Thanks. That makes me feel a lot better,” Dean dead-panned in a tone that should make it clear he was lying.
One hour later, he found himself petting Bertha, a black hen, having hopefully learned enough from Charlie, who was actually the navigator on this boat. Castiel had never met a woman who could read maps and charts and measure the stars, but she grew up on her dad’s ship and learned from him. The one thing she missed while living on boats was having a pet, but she’d soon realized chickens could be really good company and insisted that if she joined the Impala, none of them would end up eaten. Only in dire emergencies. She had almost cried when she told Castiel about that part, insinuating there had been such an emergency before.
With his mug of tea by his side, he shuffled his notes and spread out the few papers he had, really missing access to his office printer. But the university was closed to the students and it would be imprudent of him to risk a trip over there. At least he was saving some trees.
“Thinking what, honey pie?” Rowena’s voice has softened considerably and Dean glances up at her.
He could see it in her face when she caught his drift, but she was still angry. “So, leave it to me to break him?”
“Not right now, you’re not.” Castiel felt emboldened tonight. When Dean gave him a sharp look, he shrugged. “Off the clock, remember?” He dug into the bag and got out his extra bacon cheeseburger, gleefully taking a bite, well aware that Dean was watching him transfixed. He wasn’t sure if Dean was jealous of the burger or intrigued by Castiel’s attitude, but right now, Castiel didn’t care for anything other than his meal.
“Ugh, no.” Castiel finally let go, laughing as well. “I should’ve done this a long time ago. It felt… freeing.” He ducked his head. “Though I am not used to being this… mean to people. I don’t know how I feel about enjoying it.”
Dean snorted. “Guess it takes one to lead a cult.”
. The Farm was bleeding money but Castiel was always flush.
“Make it up to me? What? You want to come in and fuck me, for starters? Take care of me like you used to?” Castiel spat out, really irritated by his brother being so close to him again.
Maybe Castiel shouldn’t mention that he had even more scents in his cabinet. These five were just what he felt most like right now. “I enjoy nice things,” Castiel shrugged, twirling his index finger to indicate Dean should turn around.
. Fuck. He feels himself breaking.
Dean felt even worse, but slinked into his office, finding his desk tidy - not the way they’d left it on Friday - and his computer already booted up, awaiting him to just enter his passcode. Shit, it would suck to lose Cas.
“Please use your other hand to give me your credit card. Thank you,” Dean deadpanned and Jimmy slid his finger free with a pop.
Castiel frowned, hand rubbing over his faded jeans subconsciously. Was Dean implying…? A warm hand landed on his thigh and squeezed. Castiel swallowed and looked up at Dean. Dean licked his lips and leaned in a little, but then, as per usual, the doorbell jingled and their spell was broken.
“No, wait.” He first held up his hand, then reached it out towards Castiel tentatively. “Show me.”
“It’s fine,” Dean replied, finishing his mug and swinging his legs out of bed so he could sit and eat his stew. “I understand. Thanks for taking care of me. Still. Again.”
Castiel had a feeling that had happened before, so now Dean was more cautious. “Good thing I’m here now, huh?” Castiel joked, immediately feeling bad about it. If he succeeded, Dean would hang from the gallows before he could ever face the Kraken.
Their next few days passed by pretty uneventfully. Dean grilled more of the boar’s meat and stored it in the coldest part of the cave, but it had only been good for another two days. They dragged the rest of the carcass back into the forest before it could fully rot, fearing that the growing smell would definitely attract scavengers to their location. The pelt was still drying and Dean left it to Castiel to take care of it. He regularly checked and seemed to know what he was doing.
you always know, though?” Dean asked, voice sounding half-asleep.
Not daring to mess with the planks again, he walked a few steps back and started running, jumping to reach the ghost ship the same way Dean and Ana had. Thankfully he had enough momentum to land on the ghost ship. The ship itself proved to be solid, even if it seemed too close to the Impala to not be bumping into it. It was as if the ship was half solid and half not. He just hoped he could stay on the solid parts.
After a little while, Dean blinked open his eyes. He looked up at Castiel and seemed to be amazed at what he saw. In any case, the smile stayed on his lips and he didn’t move away. Castiel let out the breath he’d been holding and stroked through Dean’s hair. “Shower?” Castiel suggested.
Dean’s frown returned. “You’re
He walked a little further but quite suddenly found himself at the edge of a canyon. His mind must be playing tricks with him. He should’ve seen this from a lot further away, but somehow he took one step and it was as if the bottom had suddenly dropped out. So weird.
“You’re very powerful, Castiel. Why did you never check in with us? Who trained you?” Jessica asked.
Castiel sighed and passed a hand over his face, looking at Dean in consideration. “Guess I’ll have to talk eventually.” He took another sip of coffee, looking around and then adding some whiskey from a small flask to his cup. Dean didn’t comment on it. “My parents kicked me out when they caught me with another boy. Inias’ parents took me in.”
A deep rumbling coming from the ground literally shook him out of his thoughts. He quickly knelt down, placing a hand in the soil to attempt to determine if they were in danger. But as soon as it started, it ended again. He looked up at Dean, who said something involving the words “you” and “too”. Castiel didn’t catch the rest, but he thought he understood. .
Dean basically fled the cave.
“No,” Castiel shook his head, squeezing Dean’s hand. “We don’t need the warmth as much as you do. She’s better off in the back of the cave. But we will guard the cave, make sure nothing gets in.”
Mildred explained that she hadn’t even hesitated and been involved since day one, slowly learning to feed more and more people. And she’d never been more fulfilled in her life. She only wished they’d accept more needy people into their flock. When Dean questioned her about recruitment, she had to pass though, saying she was only responsible for feeding everybody.
“I like you, Castiel. I always considered us good friends,” she casually continued.
“My turn to take care of you,” Dean promised, latching onto a spot on Castiel’s neck and sucking the soft flesh between his lips.
He noticed a broken bike not too far away and strewn documents all around them. But they were in a dirty back alley, so who knew if it was related to this case or left by someone else. But it was better to be safe in these instances. “Bass!” He yelled. “Secure the papers before they get blown away, or God forbid this night gets even better and it starts to rain.” Dean glared up at the sky as if daring it to prove him right.
Cas sniffled and pulled him in again. “I don’t want to. But… I have no other choice.”
“No,” Dean confirmed, noticing that the blue now took on an interesting glow as Castiel tried to hide a pleased smile. Ok, then. Dean looked down and smiled, as well, before he continued to sew a shirt.
“Oh, now look who’s full of themselves.” Castiel pointed an accusatory finger at Dean. “If I just wanted to get laid, there’s at least twenty people on the other side of that door who would do it at the snap of a finger. Why would I work for it with you?”
Bela had stopped typing. “I’ve sent you all I know about the newest shipment. I need it on record that I assumed it would be more art. I don’t want to know what you do with this, I just need you to leave me alone.” She pointed a warning finger in Dean’s direction. “I’ll forget you pulled a gun on me and you forget about the tiny mishap with your fingerprints, yeah?”
Castiel snorted and stuck his finger into the waistband of Dean’s boxers, letting it snap against his skin. “Go take a shower. I’ll see you for dinner.” Castiel went to his closet to dig out new clothes for Dean. “But if you need me before, please don’t hesitate to find me.” He kissed his cheek again.
And Jimmy had the audacity to cock his head in consideration, like Castiel had actually meant it. It was the final straw. Castiel pushed him out of the door, making him stumble backwards until he could close the door in his face. He locked it for good measure and then leaned against it, panting heavily.
“Dean,” he said, to get his attention. Dean was lying down, with his eyes closed and a relaxed smile on his face, looking very pretty under the sun. He sat up with a jerk, Castiel apparently having startled him.
Ana made a noise to stop her and Charlie shut up. “Dean. We have a duty to keep the seas safe. You know that. We have time. It’ll be fine.”
“Um,” Dean scratched his eyebrow. He’d dug himself into this hole. “A special person you share your life with? A partner? But, um…” He put down the fabric and embraced himself, miming a kiss.
Once Castiel was ready enough, Dean pulled on a condom and blanketed Cas before entering him. They both moaned when Dean slowly bottomed out. Castiel pulled up his leg to give Dean more room to move, but this way he still felt impossibly tight.
Dean nodded, looking down at their joined hands. He squeezed Castiel’s and took a deep, bracing breath. “I’m an FBI agent.” He looked up to gauge Castiel’s reaction and Castiel looked appropriately confused, not saying anything yet and also not letting go of Dean’s hands. “Sent here undercover to find out if anything criminal is going on.”
, but Castiel had peed standing up, so... And more importantly, they didn’t even have sex.
Dean sighed and looked down, shuffling his left foot. “I really want to take you up on that, but I’d probably feel shitty the whole time.”
“Now, may I?” Dean asked, practically salivating, sword back in his hand. His gaze was wild and Castiel knew he'd jump no matter what they said. If they held him back this time, it might be a mistake.
She smirked at them confidently. As far as Castiel was concerned, she had definitely earned that look. “I trust you can take care of yourself, for now,” Ana announced, reaching for her hair again and wrinkling her nose. “I’ll see if I can’t get rid of that nasty snake smell.”
“Of course. Zachariah. Did he not give you guys enough to drink, or what?” Dean still seemed suspicious.
Predictably, Dean knelt down with him and wrapped his arms around him. “I’m so sorry, Castiel. I know you meant well.”
Dean would have to look into this once he was out again himself. They hadn’t found any accounts of former members online or anywhere else, other than those who’d been forcefully extracted by their families.
With a jolt, Castiel’s brain kicked in and he realized that it didn’t matter. He should definitely let go. As soon as Dean was free, he jumped up and ran into the bathroom. Castiel heard retching sounds soon after and quickly got up to follow.
“Look what the cat dragged in,” she greeted him. “You sure it’s safe to leave Dean alone? You two seem to be attached at the hip lately.”
“Alright, fine,” Dean grumbled, stroking his hands over his shirt, which Castiel would never get back. The softness in combination with it being
“Mildred never baked any?” Dean asked, giving Castiel first dibs at the bag.
Dean nodded his understanding and just as Castiel was about to touch his shoulders, he said, “No.”
“Wait, the ship itself is real?” Charlie asked, looking at Dean, still out cold on the ground.
Castiel wouldn’t trust him to investigate. The Farm almost exclusively recruited wealthy members, so they’d had to make him desirable and give him enough of a reason to want to join. Being cooped up in a high stress desk job and being close to a burnout sounded a lot better than being an out of luck mechanic, Dean’s usual cover.
“Was glad I could just watch,” Dean replied with a grin.
Castiel considered this and had to agree. “She likes me now, though, right? She’ll let me work with her?”
Dean groaned, embarrassed. But Castiel just laughed. “You’re definitely getting a Christmas bonus, Donna.” He hesitated. “Well. Depending on what food you ordered,”
“You say that now, but… I know how much you hate lying.” Dean briefly leaned into his touch and then turned his head away. Castiel took his hand down.
“Like a fragile, needy loser?” Dean suggested.
Castiel wrapped his arms tighter around Dean and breathed in his scent. Not long enough. “I have a few hours.”
Leaning up to kiss his chin, Dean nuzzled into his side. “Hey,” he whispered softly. “Good morning.”
Dean chuckled, looking back up. “Sounds like a deal. And I guess I’ll know what to get you for Christmas then.”
“I…” Dean faltered. “I’m sorry?”
Cas shrugged, indicating it was ok. “Either way. She knows we’re on to her. And she gave me a day to flee the country before she would blow up all of our lives.”
Castiel finally turned back and focused on making his scrambled eggs and frying the bacon. Dean decided to take pity on him and just silently watch him move about, not distracting him further. He was getting hungry himself as well and that bacon smelled amazing. It had been a long, long time since he’d allowed himself pork, but he wasn’t even hesitating when Castiel placed it in front of him. It was one of the food items he missed the most.
Ana stayed and they compared more notes. Nothing was really helpful. Apparently, since there was more than one kind of sea snake, each had its different weaknesses. One story in Castiel’s book suggested a virgin sacrifice would satisfy the snake and cause it to hibernate for another year before it demanded a new sacrifice.
“I don’t think they’re that out of it,” Dean tried, but he wasn’t even sure why he should convince Castiel to leave. He wanted to stay in bed with him all day as well. They already had the evidence, so even if Meg got suspicious, it couldn’t hurt them anymore?
Dean yawned and sat up, stretching himself. It made his shirt ride up and Castiel couldn’t help but admire the strip of milky skin it revealed. “Did I miss something?” He asked sleepily.
Castiel nodded grimly. Great, just great. He should’ve let Dean climb, after all. He could’ve healed Dean of a minor injury such as this. But he couldn’t heal himself, that wasn’t how his powers worked. “You should leave me here,” he said, resigned. “I have fruit and don’t need the warmth of the cave.”
Castiel sighed. “I’m gonna order us some dinner. Burgers ok?”
Dean grumbled but had to admit she had a point. One of the first things he’d noticed on the Farm was how revered and beloved Castiel was. He glared at him anyway. Castiel had the gall to just shrug.
Castiel jumped in as well, scratching it with his dagger, but it didn’t seem to penetrate the skin. The wound Dean had caused was oozing a nasty, black substance but again, it dissolved as soon as it hit the ship.
Castiel’s eyebrows couldn’t climb any higher than they did. “That’s new.”
And stuff. “Wait. Did you seduce me so I wouldn’t betray you?” Castiel accused him.
“I am in cyber crime. I can do that from anywhere,” Jimmy explained. “Well, anywhere with a cell tower.”
“I was a little too distracted with other things,” Dean admitted, flushing, his gaze falling to Castiel’s chest.
“Dean,” Castiel narrowed his eyes. “I’m happy you enjoy it, but I know you’re stalling.”
“Why would you do that?” Castiel blinked, now very confused.
“I’m gonna buy you at least 30 minutes if you promise to finish that sandwich and recover. I’d also give you a Snickers, but…” Castiel trailed off when Dean recoiled. “Yeah. Call me if you need anything.” He turned to leave but then stopped and squeezed Dean’s shoulder. “I mean it, Dean. Press the button. I’m just outside.”
“Wow, that’s…” Dean’s eyes widened. “Far away.”
“What? You thought I was gonna let you rot in jail?” Dean asked, feeling irrationally hurt.
“After you’ve had your tea,” Castiel replied. “It’ll help you, I promise.”
Jimmy nodded and bit his lip, looking at Dean. “So, do I get my own cupcake, or…”
“Yes. There are no friends among hackers.” His mind flashed on Illyria, who he’d only known for a few months but had a strong suspicion had been around for a lot longer under different usernames. It was smart, actually. Keep others off your trail. Even if it meant a lot less credit.
“The hell? I would know if I was being drugged,” Dean snapped back, but then he remembered just how out of it he’d felt after a few days on the Farm and how much better he’d gotten once he’d stayed at Castiel’s place. How much his mind had cleared up…
“If there’s anything I can do…?” Dean offered and before Castiel could decline, Jimmy waved his empty mug at him.
“Take a break, Cas.” Dean leaned across the desk, further into his space. “You’ve already helped me a lot.”
So with a heavy sigh, Castiel snuggled back in, decision to stay confirmed when Dean moved and wrapped an arm around Castiel’s chest, shuffling closer. God dammit. Could they not have met at any other time?
“Three months?” Dean hit his leg. “Are you kidding me? You asshole.” He got up, grabbed a pillow, and hit him again. Castiel almost spilled the coffee.
“Drugs, Cas. I definitely think some of your flock are high,” Dean explained and Castiel was a little impressed that he had figured this out, finally. They didn’t dose them very high. He’d put a much higher concentration into Dean’s water. Though he didn’t control how much tea everyone drank. So for some, the drugs probably had a much higher effect than on others.
When the rest of the daily press along with the groupies started to crowd the room, Dean nodded at Ruby and Anna. “Alright, I’ll get out of your hair. Have fun.” He could just hear Anna ask who he was as he discreetly made his way to the exit, only fishing out his crew badge once he absolutely had to.
“Storm it?” Castiel frowned. “They’re not… gonna shoot anyone, right? They know we’re not armed? That this is a harmless commune?”
“But I didn’t...” Did Castiel tell everyone that he’d offered? But why would he?
This time, the alien did not chat on their walk, so Castiel didn’t have a chance to pick up more words. Once it was getting dark enough to make it hard to see, the noises started. Shuffling and crackling leaves. Whines and growls. Sometimes he thought he saw red or golden eyes flashing between the trees, but they were always gone before he could be sure.
But soon enough reality set in. He still had to leave. And there was a very real chance that he’d get intercepted at the airport and thrown in jail, if he got a great fake passport or if he tried to use his own. Didn’t matter. They’d probably be extra suspicious of someone looking as scruffy as he did flying into such an expensive location as the Maldives. Maybe he should try Chile instead. Or drive up to Canada and then make his way out from there.
“Of you getting your hands dirty,” Meg stated calmly. “Guess what I haven’t found?”
Jimmy gaped after her when she left and then thought back to when they’d checked Castiel’s finances. He was broke and besides the occasional check from his job at the docks, there was no other source of income. He’d found that suspicious and figured Jimmy had another off-shore account or one under a different name. Or maybe he operated on a cash-only basis. But after getting a glimpse of how he actually lived and this off-hand comment…
“Meanwhile I’ll keep doing the grunt work and actually investigate.” Dean interjected. He knew he was petty, but Sam swooping in and taking over his case was not happening. He’d get it wrapped in a bow when Dean was done investigating.
Castiel shrugged and realized Jimmy’s hand was still on his when he pulled it back to unwrap the iPhone. “Sorry. Went to work straight from Dean’s and then, uhm, straight to The Good Bean.”
“I mostly use the one in my apartment complex. It’s empty,” Dean explained.
“What…” Dean tried. “What are you doing?”
“That bitch.” Dean spat. “You interrogated Meg, didn’t you? And she’s already started pinning everything on Cas.”
Not waiting for an invitation, Dean took a hold of Castiel’s wrist, pulling his hand in so he could slowly lick it clean, keeping eye contact with him the whole time and making sure to convey how much he liked it.
“You gotta give me something on Odin. And when we have a strong enough case, we’ll go to my superiors and…” Jimmy tried to explain but Castiel interrupted him.
Castiel hesitated before leaning down and kissing Dean right above his left eyebrow. “Thanks for coming to find me, Dean. It means a lot.”
“I owe
Dean knew it was probably a joke, but his insecurities still set in. How many people did he have sex with in here before him? And how much better had they been? How much less neurotic, how much more slim?
That made Castiel laugh. “I promise you, it’s not tea.”
“Dean…” Castiel’s face melted and he cupped Dean’s cheek. “The lengths you go to for me. I can’t…”
“But we just kissed.” Dean rubbed a hand through his hair. Was he still dreaming? Was that it?
“I just don’t want to make any mistakes with the translation.” Castiel pointed at the book. “Assuming there really is a sea snake, I am on this ship now, too. And I’d rather not get eaten.”
They got dressed quickly and headed out, Castiel leading them in the direction of their office first of all. If Meg wasn’t there, at least he could use the opportunity to delete the security tapes. He’d gotten Dean to agree to wait outside first and Castiel would call for him if he was needed. That gave Castiel the chance to control the narrative a little better.
“Let’s go then,” Dean announced, already on his way out.
physically touch him whenever he wanted, but he refrained.
Castiel’s light engulfed him wholly and Dean felt so loved, so comforted but also, on a much baser level, the sex suddenly felt so much more intense. It was like Castiel was squeezing his cock but at the same time heating and cradling it and… Dean’s mind couldn’t handle it anymore. He came and promptly blacked out.
Castiel mock gasped and grasped his chest. “No tea at all? Not even generic chamomile or peppermint?”
Dean rolled his eyes. “Figures. I dunno where you guys put it. If I drank half as much coffee, I wouldn’t be able to sleep. Ever.”
“Hey,” Dean whispered. “That’s my boat you’re talking about.”
Feeling sticky, Castiel itched to take a shower, but he didn’t want to disturb Dean. So instead he just watched him, feeling a little proud at the peaceful expression on his face. It was most likely just his normal sleepy look, but Castiel still took credit for relaxing him. He silently vowed to continue with his mission all weekend, if Dean would let him. And then maybe… for even longer still.
By the time he’d had a light supper and finished his second bottle of water, Dean wasn’t so sure if he really wanted to leave anytime soon though. Gossip aside, working in the kitchen was peaceful. Dean realized that working with his hands to produce something that would help feed a whole bunch of real people was very rewarding. He hadn’t felt like this while trying to collect vermin or weeding the garden, or when he had failed with the stupid corn. But all of those jobs had been mostly solitary, with Meg breathing down his neck, and nobody else connecting to him. They’d all been too aloof.
“Nothing. See you in three months.” Charlie saluted him and got on her snowmobile, driving away.
The arrows found their target and the ship started burning. Castiel quickly realized that it was burning for real and not just flickering out of existence the way the big ghost had. Some of the crew realized this, as well, and they ran to the railing to check how close the Impala actually still was to the ghost ship.
Dean gave him a thumbs up and he got a confused head tilt in return. He smiled fondly. The alien was growing on him.
He strokes Castiel‘s cheek, hoping the gesture is reassuring. But his fingers are trembling and they‘re both still silently crying. “I love you,“ Dean says, no hesitation, no more build up needed. He can see Cas‘s expression fully break and he‘s openly sobbing again, but happily so. He flashes back to that cursed night in the bunker, when Billie came for them. He couldn‘t react then. But he sure can now.
“Well, shit,” Dean chuckled. “Henriksen must really like you.”
Castiel turned on his laptop and made a cup of tea while it was starting up. It was an old thing, and he didn’t like looking at it too closely during the booting process because as soon as something took a little longer than usual, he started to worry. At least Jimmy wasn’t here right now to laugh at him.
Castiel hesitated. “I hope it will not be six…” he looked for the word. “Weeks.”
If it wasn’t for Dean who had hooked himself under his arm to be even closer and offer silent support for whatever his answer might be, Castiel would have jumped up just to get away from Odin. But fine. Two could play that game.
Castiel crouched down and shuffled in to lean against a stone, putting his helmet next to him on the ground. He should shut it off to let it recharge, but if anything attacked them, he would need it. The alien followed and said something that Castiel identified as “we” and he perked up, trying to understand.
Dean’s whole body was buzzing pleasantly and he was acutely aware of where their skin was touching, the way Castiel’s warm breath was puffing against his skin, how his hairs tickled him when Castiel rested his head against Dean’s back. He could feel Castiel’s erection nestled against his ass, not fully hard but definitely not soft. It was cozy. He felt happy and loved. Cared for and secure. It was more than enough to satisfy him exactly as they were. No need to move.
“Help him.” Castiel looked out at the sea. “I don’t think he knows what’s waiting for him.”
In the ensuing struggle, Castiel’s gag came loose and as soon as he could, he yelled out at Dean. “Dean! It was Cole. He’s just tried to shoot you.”
Dean caught his eyes and raised his eyebrow. “Don’t objectify me.”
Jimmy smiled, realizing that he was not hurt in the least. Instead, he was genuinely happy to see his brother so in love.
Castiel spotted Ana down among them, swimming like a mermaid but not affected by the net. She seemed to be doing the most damage. Turning towards Dean, Castiel realized that he had climbed up on the railing and was just about to jump down, sword raised. Castiel quickly raced to him and caught him around his midriff, holding him back.
Castiel was at home on his couch trying to watch a documentary on beetles to distract himself, but it didn’t really work. His phone was in his hand and he checked it every minute or so to make sure he hadn’t missed a message. He had activated the sound and vibration alarms as soon as he’d come in the door, but just the same, he couldn’t stop himself from checking.
“And buried on six different islands,” Ana supplied with a grin.
Dean seemed to sense it as well and mostly behaved himself. He still ate his food as suggestively as possible whenever he noticed Castiel look over, but at least he kept his hands to himself. A part of Castiel was a little sad about that. He couldn’t wait until they left this place. Maybe they could even go on a little couples getaway just the two of them.
Dean turned onto his side, facing away from Castiel. He didn’t think he could handle anything else without being tempted to accelerate this. And once they started, he had a feeling they wouldn’t be able to stop again.
Castiel was looking up at him curiously now and Dean closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. He ushered him into their room and closed and locked the door, putting a chair against the door handle just in case.
“You saying I’m filthy?” Dean asked in return.
“Ok. So, fuck that. Whatever. I’m ok with that,” Dean stated. “I’m definitely not better off without you. What the fuck, Cas?”
Castiel snorted. “Well, if I start a new band just so you can write a piece on them, I’ll make sure to have a less restrictive set as well.”
“This isn’t my first rodeo. I can handle myself.” Dean frowned, offended. He’d been writing in depth features for the Stone since years. He wasn’t new to following on a tour. Granted this was the first time they let him ride with the actual crew and not follow along on his own terms. And Castiel was his biggest charge yet. But still.
Castiel frowned, taken aback. “Yes, it does. But also, Dean, do you own a mirror?”
Oh. Fuck. “Nobody.” Castiel glared at Balthazar. “I’m talking to nobody.”
“Dean,” Castiel interrupted.
Dean didn‘t even wait for a reply and just disconnected the call. When he put his phone face down on the table, he became acutely aware of Cas who was sitting right next to him at the table. Cas was fidgeting with a thread on his hoodie but Dean was sure he‘d listened in, even if it was involuntarily.
“I couldn’t heal you. I don’t understand why I couldn’t heal you.” Castiel still seemed worried, his eyes flicking across Dean’s face and down his torso to confirm that he was alive.
“I don’t want you to resent me for it. I mean, you probably already took a hit for not knowing that your partner was a criminal for years.” Castiel raised his own eyebrow when Jimmy was about to argue. He was right, but Jimmy was too proud to acknowledge it. “And leaving DC will just be another obstacle for you.”
“Eh,” Dean made a dismissive sound. “Don’t sample your own product.”
“Alright. I didn’t forge those transport papers. But if I had, purely in theory…” Dean gave him a meaningful look. “I definitely thought they were smuggling in art. Not people. And if you found my prints on that document, then I’ve been set up.”
The pig must like being held so gently and close to Castiel’s body, where it was warm, because he gives a happy squeak. ‘Yeah, buddy,’ Dean thinks. ‘I’d like it there as well.’
taking care of me.”
Castiel took his cock in his hand and guided it to Dean’s entrance, deciding to not tease him anymore. He gently guided it inside, groaning at the silky heat and sinking into Dean slowly. It took some restraint, but if there was anything Castiel was good at, it was holding himself back. He watched Dean closely to make sure he wasn’t going too fast. “Good?” Castiel asked.
Dean couldn’t decide if he was more turned on or more uncomfortable. In any case, he hated the knowing smirk Jimmy directed at him, so he took his pillow and threw it at his smug face.
Granted, back when he’d been young and dumb, he’d hacked a few sites just to prove he could. But so did Jimmy. Back when they’d studied computer science at MIT and shared a dorm room and…
Sam let out some kind of snort and Dean chose to interpret it as a sound of pain. Castiel’s fingers still hovered close to Dean’s forehead, but he conceded and turned towards Sam instead, healing him quickly.
“Love you, too,” Dean smiled and placed a kiss on Castiel’s chin. “And I’m sorry. Didn’t mean to mess with your work.”
“They… you didn’t have them killed in prison?” Castiel interjected.
“Yet you’re here yourself,” Dean frowned.
He’d just reached the steps down when Dean caught up with him. “Where do you think you’re going?”
Odin squeezed the bridge of her nose. “Alright. I can realize my mistakes, too. And I don’t know why I didn’t think about this earlier, but how about we work together and put it all on Jimmy.”
Sam read through the part about drinking demon blood also included in the book and said it was pretty accurate. The human mentioned didn’t get powers quite like him, but he said the gist of it checked out. Neither of them mentioned it, but Sam was visibly shaken at not only the reminder but also that his relationship with Ruby had not been as unique as he’d assumed.
A part of him was afraid though. Especially once they rejoined the real world and Dean’s assignment was over. And Castiel didn’t do afraid. He’d chucked that out of his life years ago. Now he planned and played and manipulated and he didn’t get himself truly invested. It only led to pain. Would Dean bring him pain?
Ah. But there was definitely a reason. Nothing the FBI should get involved in, though. Most definitely not domestic terrorism. Castiel has never been a black hat, even if he definitely had the skills for it and could use the money. But no matter what…
when he fell completely in love or if it was Castiel’s expression of pure joy when he saw Dean’s hamster habitat or when he pulled out an actual notepad to scribble down what Dean tells him about preparing the wood and which chemicals to definitely avoid. But he ends up actually helping Castiel build his pig pen and he home delivers Castiel’s three new flat mates once it’s done - and then stays the night to make sure they settle in smoothly. Because he really cares about animals. No other reason at all.
Castiel couldn’t help but steal a sip. He was disappointed to find that it definitely did not taste how it used to. It was the one thing he missed. Enjoying sustenance. He smiled wistfully and shoved the mug back towards Dean’s hands.
“Not gonna break. Let go,” Dean offered, satisfied when Castiel gave up, slumping down and resting most of his weight on top of Dean.
Castiel looked at him in surprise. He’d never asked before. Should he reveal his secret? He smirked. “You both have lousy poker faces. I can definitely see the guilt in yours.” He kissed Dean’s forehead. “And the smugness in Jimmy’s.”
“I have found evidence suggesting he did,” Jimmy revealed.
“Twinky?” Castiel frowned. “Dean, I don’t care how you look. Do I find you attractive? Of fucking course.” He shrugged. “But the more I get to know you
“What?” Dean frowned. “She can… do that?” He put down his gatherings and walked closer. So that’s what he had tried to tell him the other night?
After ensuring they weren’t the carnivorous kind that grabbed him before, Castiel used some nearby vines to bind the boar, and they made an early trip back to their cave. Cas carried the boar while Dean collected wood again. Maybe they should gather more vines so Cas could weave something larger, to carry more in one trip. As he had expected, as soon as they reached their cave, Dean was anxious to go back to the jungle and gather more supplies. They would just have to hope that no scavengers found the boar carcass while they were foraging.
And just like that, they were back to watching the actual movie.
“I’m gonna make you more tea,” Castiel announced and went to his kitchenette. Dean watched him roam and dutifully ate a few grapes, plotting how he could improve this day and get Castiel back into bed with him.
Once they stepped out, they saw that three moons had risen. Without the dense foliage it was easier to see their surroundings, but there was still no cave in sight. Castiel sighed and looked back at the forest with its carnivorous vines and unknown creatures. He turned towards his companion and raised an eyebrow.
Cas responded eagerly, pushing up Dean’s shirt and slipping his hands underneath to scratch at Dean’s back. Dean hissed and bit Cas’s lower lip in retaliation, then scratched at his scalp. Castiel moaned again and ripped open Dean’s shirt. And somehow in the back of his mind he realized they didn’t have any other clothes for the next day. But that didn’t keep him from ripping at Castiel’s shirt as well, trying to even the score.
room and change my clothes. Talk to you later, Cas.” He had started walking, but added over his shoulder, “Glad you’re back. Dean really missed you.”
Ana snorted and even Dean raised an eyebrow at that. “Alright, I think you need more rum. You’re coming with me.” Dean grabbed him by the front of his shirt and dragged him along, down below deck and to his private quarters.
“You fiend,” Castiel accused him. “Hungry for actual food.”
“Let me,” he asked. “I don’t want to hurt you.” He pulled out and thrust back in, getting about halfway, allowing himself to move further in small increments.
Dean turned around, wild eyed. His whole being was keyed up. It wasn’t just his body that was humming with arousal, but all the deep, even breathing along with Cas kind of opened up a headspace where he felt even closer to him and now he was stepping back?
Castiel gives him a wide smile. “I saw you, too.”
They both stayed quiet and the knocking finally stopped, but something was being slid under their door. Castiel tensed, having a bad feeling about it. “I should go check,” he announced.
He clicked on his helmet to analyze the branches he was using to climb, but it was once again running low on battery. It had been overcast lately and there hadn’t been enough sun to recharge. Now that it was twilight, his vision started to glitch. It was driving him nuts, so he took off the helmet and waited for Dean to be ready to catch it before he dropped it, then continued to climb on instinct.
The sight breaks her heart and she pulls him in, kicking the door closed and then pulling him close. Sam trembles, collapsing against her and Eileen is stronger than she looks, but not by that much. She goes down to her knees with him and lets him cry on her shoulder, shushing him and cradling his head, rubbing soothing circles over his back with her other hand.
“Sure,” Castiel smiled encouragingly, glad that Dean was taking the initiative.
While he was fully confident that he’d implicated Meg enough to come out of all of this clean, he was wondering how much of his old self, his real self, he could show Dean and still have him stay. Dean had been surprisingly good with Castiel being less than kind earlier that day. But Castiel had just been too annoyed at Kelly—or more so, protective of Dean—that he’d seen red when he realized she’d attacked him, if only verbally. He had lost his cool and just said what he wanted to say. It didn’t seem like Dean thought less of him for it.
Castiel froze. “How do you know that name?”
Dean bites his lower lip. He should maybe go outside and talk to him. Invite him in to hold one. Only to be a good employee and make a sale, of course. Not because he wants to drag him back to the employees-only breakroom and kiss those plush lips and bury his hands in that glorious hair and… “Oh shit.” Dean’s eyes widen. Charlie has clearly decided Dean doesn’t deserve to live today. She went outside and is now talking to Blue-Eyes.
“I said I wouldn’t kill him,” Dean yelled back.
gun. You shouldn’t have let me go in there defenseless, anyway.” Dean accused. “I am a valuable asset. I had to protect myself.”
Meg was awake and she was angry enough to worry Mildred. And Mildred had known Meg for almost as long as Castiel did, so that meant something. There were too many bad scenarios playing out in his mind and he was immediately trying to come up with fixes for all of them. But that meant he was so lost in his own head, he didn’t even realize Dean was with him still, until Dean placed a hand on his arm, making him jump.
“Sorry, it’s just…” Dean wrapped his arms around himself. “You tickled me.”
“Well, you know here at the Farm we firmly believe that everybody has to do their part for the community, so yes, Dean, if need be, you’d peel potatoes.” Castiel tilted his head, trying to speak softly. “But definitely not before your hands are healed.” He trailed his fingers up Dean’s arm in a featherlight touch, delighted to see him shiver.
Dean laughed and nursed his drink, wondering if he should get one for Cas the way Ruby always got a drink for Anna. But he didn’t expect them to spend much time in the VIP area anyway.
The destroyers had come to one of their planets and started harvesting resources. Valuable resources the Ceruleans, Castiel’s people, needed to secure the wellbeing of their offspring. But he had voted to try and talk to them. Maybe the aliens didn’t know. Maybe it wasn’t an attempt to wipe them all out. It could have been a simple mistake.
Dean smiled happily when he straightened himself back up. “I like that you’re flirting back now, Agent. What made you drop the shtick?”
“Nah. You know how much work that would’ve been to make them for the whole compound? Besides, we had a no sugar policy.” Castiel licked off some of the frosting, just enjoying the taste before he took a whole bite.
“Thanks, Oscar,” Castiel patted his arm as they passed and Dean wasn’t even surprised that Castiel knew his name. A car was brought around just as another girl ran out, bringing Castiel a fresh shirt. “Thanks, Donna.” Castiel smiled at her. “You’re a gem.”
“What?” Castiel felt shivers run down his spine. He could live with being shot. Well… not really, but… If it was him, so be it. But was she threatening Dean?
It caused Charlie to laugh and soon enough, the others in his vicinity joined in. Dean himself refilled Castiel’s mug. “So, Latin, huh?” he asked. “Are you good enough to read scripture?”
“Because you just looked too delectable,” Castiel shrugged. “Siren.”
“He was. But after my mom died, he just took odd jobs, going where he was needed. Leaving us with friends, sometimes.” Alone, other times. Dean sighed.
Castiel was fighting hard not to smirk. “Thank you,” he replied. “For watching.”
“Yeah, but why?” Castiel asked, two fingers going to Dean’s throat and pressing in. Castiel glanced at his watch and Dean realized he was taking his pulse.
“You’re such a slut, Dean.” Bela clicked her tongue.
The alien blinked rapidly and Dean patted his shoulder. “Yeah,” Dean continued. “I know, I probably talk too fast for you to process, huh? Sorry.”
With a smirk, Dean laid Castiel flat out on the table, stepping away to take off his leather pants and orange briefs. He looked him up and down, once he was fully naked. “That’s the kind of buffet I was expecting tonight.”
Dean pulled in a chair and sat down. “Like what?”
“Listen, Cas. I hear you, but… I gotta call this in.” He gave him another small kiss. “Ok? I’m not saying no, and you’re definitely not sleeping alone tonight, but…” Dean sighed, kissing his temple. “I gotta call this in. And you gotta come down to the station. And Jess probably needs to come as well, and…” He stopped, wrapping his arms tightly around Castiel and taking a deep breath. “Fuck, I’m glad you’re safe. You have no idea.”
Castiel nodded and left to prepare it and as soon as he was done, Dean’s brain caught up with him. Castiel was proud of him for eating? And Dean was happy about the praise? What was wrong with him? What was wrong with the both of them? Eating was nothing to be proud of. His juice cleanse would’ve been a feat.
Dean had a weird feeling once he’d made it inside though. Like somebody had tampered with his room. He frowned. Nothing was obviously out of the ordinary. Maybe someone came to clean it? He’d kept it tidy himself, but maybe they just randomly checked?
Dean had also turned more tactile, touching him constantly when they were together. And they exchanged DNA more frequently now—Dean called it kissing. Castiel had tried to explain that he couldn’t conceive again, but Dean had just frowned and waved him off. It wasn’t unheard of for [Castiel’s people] to remain affectionate even without the task of procreating, but Castiel was still pleasantly surprised.
There was a loud snort in reply. “Since you went straight to ass-kissing, I assume you know why I’m calling.”
had mentioned it, Dean couldn’t stop thinking about it. He’d lie if he said he’d never had twin fantasies before. Or was generally curious about a threesome.
Mildred gave him a look that told him she knew he was trying to placate her right now. “I never liked her, Castiel. I wish we’d never let her join us.”
There was an incessant knocking on Dean’s front door and he stumbled out of bed bleary eyed. Opening the door revealed a distressed looking Cas and Dean immediately opened his door wider to usher him in.
The both of them were still a little tired and clumsy until they stood under the spray of water. Dean had gotten in first and closed his eyes, letting it bead over himself and clearly enjoying it. Castiel’s cock stirred at the enticing picture, but he still pushed Dean out of the way so he could get wet himself.
“We sent word to Sam to tell him we’ll be late. Hopefully he can stall.” Ana reported cryptically.
“Do I have to?” Castiel asked back, holding the toothbrush out for Dean to take.
“Anyway,” Castiel kissed his cheek and then turned back to his counter, starting to crack the eggs. “What do you usually eat for breakfast?”
“Do you need my help?” Mildred offered.
Castiel narrowed his eyes, arms crossed in front of his chest. But then he sighed in defeat. “Yeah, ok. I’ll go… feed the chickens.” Ana placed a hand on his shoulder and gently guided him away, her eyes unusually soft. They made it to the door, but she didn’t usher him inside. Instead, they both watched the crew leave in a small boat to get to shore.
Dean turned around, looking betrayed. “Cas? I can’t believe you’d really sell me out. How about not leaving, huh?” Dean was still wearing his normal clothes but two of his crewmen had donned the Navy uniforms. They’d already opened the shirts and ditched the hats, so their disguises would not be helpful in a possible fight.
He’d screwed up the last two jobs on purpose because nobody was talking to him or they didn’t have anything of value to say. He’d hoped maybe here he’d find a source willing to speak out, but it was just another failure.
“Yes,” Dean grabbed it and inhaled himself. “Suck it, not ride it.”
Dean tried to protest, but Castiel’s grip was strong and Dean’s hormones took over. He went pliant and melted into the kiss, knees a little weak when they stopped. But after a few deep breaths, he realized Castiel had just toyed with him again, using him to get those groupies off his back for now. Or maybe he just wanted to mock him. And he started to get really pissed.
Cas’s lips wobbled and he bit the inside of his cheek. Probably to keep from crying. Shit. But then he slowly nodded and Dean smiled. He only knew Cas for a few minutes, but the thought of him out there alone on Christmas would’ve really worn him down. Especially since he wasn’t lying. He didn’t want to be alone either.
“Of course.” Castiel had to admit that he was a little relieved at that admission, especially considering how long it took the both of them to get to where they were now. “If at any point this changes, that’s ok, too.” Jimmy had yet to fully let his guard down around Dean. He was lovable. If they both opened their hearts a little more, they’d still work. “As long as you don’t stop loving me.”
Castiel nodded. “Since the beginning.” He jumped up and down and fiddled with his tee shirt’s collar. “Goddamn, I need to get fucking laid.”
Instead, Castiel placed his own hand above Dean’s, stroking his fingers before taking a hold of his wrist to pull it away. “Cute, Dean. Still not going to get you out of yoga.”
Shit. Dean took a hold of the cup with both hands and took a large gulp. “Mmmmhm,” he faked a happy smile.
“What?“ He‘d need a little recovery time, but they could still have fun in the meantime.
“Now we throw the firebombs.” Sam instructed, looking at Dean intently until finally Dean stopped struggling and closed his eyes.
Dean closed his eyes, his breathing evening out to the point Castiel almost thought he’d fallen asleep. “You can ask, too, you know,” Dean finally murmured softly, keeping his eyes shut.
Whatever it was. Castiel looked back at Sam, who seemed to be almost done with a net he had dipped into water and was now bespelling while dipping something into it. Was that a rosary? Castiel looked closer and realized it was indeed a rosary. When he was done, Sam pulled the net out and joined them.
Monday morning, they jerked each other off lazily in the shower and then dawdled until they absolutely had to make their way to work. The car ride was strained, neither of them talking. Dean stopped around the corner from the parking lot to let Castiel out first, seeming genuinely sorry about it.
“Guess we’ll just have to do our job and find something that sticks,” Jimmy ground out in reply, choosing to ignore her goading.
, he laid back down in bed and waited for Castiel to return.
Castiel winked at him and then vanished into the office.
Castiel was looking up at him with a stunned expression. Then he licked his lips, collecting some of the come off his face with a smirk. “Well fuck. I did tell you to knock me down a peg. Didn’t think you’d do it.” He swiped his finger through another glob of come, licking it clean while keeping eye contact with Dean, before he pulled off his shirt and wiped the rest off, throwing the shirt behind him when he was done.
By the end of soundcheck, Dean was tempted to take a picture after all. Castiel had worked himself up so much that he was left without his hoodie, no tee and his sweats were slung very low, giving Dean another glimpse of those orange briefs. And the thing was, Castiel didn’t even try to put on a show. He just naturally belonged on that stage and made it his own, if he tried to or not. Dean was a little sad that he hadn’t discovered them sooner. What a sight it must have been, to see Castiel perform in front of twenty people in a dive bar. Ripped pants or not, Dean was convinced Castiel would have gotten famous eventually either way.
and was sporting an impressive morning wood. He was almost tempted to reach down and subtly take care of it, but that would definitely be crossing a line and Castiel would notice and… Dean was not that kind of creep.
When Dean’s eyes met his, Castiel realized he’d fallen for the bait yet again. “Spankings, Special Agent Novak. For being a naughty boy.”
It suddenly hits him. “Fourty years?” he yells. “Fourty fucking years, Cas? I only just got behind the wheel, man.”
While sex on the beach sounded nice in theory, Dean immediately worried about sunburn in bad places and sand in even worse places. He buried his hand in Castiel’s hair to keep him still. And also… they should probably actually have sex in a bed first. “How much time do we have left?”
“You didn’t fail. I am here for these kinds of things. So you are getting your own lunch. Just think of me as ordering DoorDash.” Castiel busied himself with putting the credit card away to keep from reaching out to touch yet again.
“A burger.“ Castiel blurted out. “Like, a really good, juicy burger, maybe with double meat and definitely cheese and just…“ He moaned.
Suddenly he heard a noise and went on high alert. He didn’t know what planet he was on. There might be dangerous animals. Or the aliens had come to hunt him. He reached for his gun and charged it before proceeding with caution.
“Good how?” Dean asked, arms crossed in front of his chest.
The alien said something else and splashed him with water, and Castiel realized he had been staring. He could feel himself flush blue and quickly splashed some more water on his face, as well. Now the alien was staring at him, in turn. Great. Giving him a nickname should not be a priority.
Hence, Commander Castiel Novak was sent to infiltrate Dean’s crew and report back his findings. If his mission ends with the capture of Dean and his whole crew, or better yet, the whole Impala destroyed, even more medals for Castiel.
“Sit,” Castiel told him, putting the bags on the couch table and getting some cutlery and napkins from his kitchen.
Dean flushed immediately. “Of course not.” Cas worked on that laptop. So he was using his phone. God forbid Cas saw his browser history. He’d also read that it was safer on your phone, but he wasn’t sure if that was true.
Castiel froze and pushed him back. “No, I’m not.” Was this how Dean had always gotten out of his convictions? It certainly wouldn’t have worked on Henriksen, though. That guy was as straight as they come. But the mere idea that Dean might have tried rubbed Castiel the wrong way, somehow.
Dean shivered. If anyone was the siren here, it was the blue eyed god in front of him. “We’ll make sure to build something solid together.”
The only thing Dean regretted later on was that he didn’t take a picture of the scene. It would have been awesome for his article. Maybe he’d get lucky and it would happen again.
“Why?” Dean prodded.
After a little bit of wrestling and playfully shoving each other, Castiel had managed to get them both under the covers, and himself wrapped snugly around Dean. “I’m gonna snuggle you so close that you’ll be hot in no time,” Castiel promised.
Castiel buried his hand in Dean’s hair again, caressing him softly this time. No more punishing tugs. He broke the kiss and licked over Dean’s plump bottom lip instead. Looking into Dean’s green eyes, he shivered, suddenly having a hard time to keep up the slow grind. “Dean, I…” Castiel blinked. No.
“Because I was the only one who was ever allowed to call him that.” Jimmy sighed, looking away again. “Until he used it as his hacker alias, anyway, I guess.”
“That girl is definitely scary,” Castiel agreed, pulling Dean closer. “But seriously. Tell me if it gets worse, you hear? I want you to keep coming for visits as much as your schedule allows.”
“I told you there was going to be a lot of touching,” Castiel informed him. But he quickly righted Dean’s position again, behaving himself and pressing down on his lower back a little to help him stretch. “If the stretch gets too much, tell me.”
“Let me help,” Dean offered immediately.
Thankfully they discovered that those toiletry bags included lube and condoms, which possibly made this motel a little seedier than he’d expected, but in this case it was highly appreciated.
Dean stopped and crowded Castiel against the wall, nuzzling his cheek before giving him a soft kiss. “I’m good for now. Don’t worry. Besides, I have Ruby to protect me.”
Dean looked at him, frowning briefly and opening his mouth, but then he closed it again and nodded his head instead. “Maybe you can charm the snake like you charmed the chickens.” Then Dean gave him an elated grin. Castiel didn’t know how he could look so devilishly handsome and carefree at a time like this and also, fuck no, the chickens were a desaster, but somehow a smile still slipped its way onto his own lips, as well.
Dean avoided his gaze. “But listen. Same deal. If you and a fellow researcher suddenly get close and need to keep warm up there…”
When Dean was done brushing, Castiel insisted on helping him back into bed, even though Dean tried to wave him off. “God dammit, Dean,” Castiel snapped. “Stop being so stubborn and let me help you.”
But as the saying goes, the devil appeared and he ran into Meg just as he was about to head back.
“Monday,” Dean cocked his head. Castiel should know this. “My yoghurt?”
“Yes.” Dean shrugs a little. “That’s why I have to do all I can to give them the best life possible.”
“If you ask me,” Charlie continued. “This just proves that Balthazar’s whole experiment was a failure. By all means stay in your lab alone but for fuck’s sake. You should’ve had to check in with us whenever you ventured outside and when you were expected to be back. This was quite reckless of you.”
“You really want to know?” Jimmy turned in his seat so he could see his brother better.
Castiel turned in Dean’s arms and wrapped his own around Dean’s waist as well. “My sweet boy,” he crooned. “I am truly blessed you found me.” He gave Dean a small kiss. “And I can’t wait to have you all to myself soon.”
Castiel glared at him. “It’s what I’m doing right now. I’m exhausted, so I’m taking a nap.” He curled in on himself and closed his eyes, hoping Balthazar would take the hint.
Castiel turned his head to smile at him before he focused back on his herbs. “Some ginseng for energy, ginger for general health, a few peppercorns and rooibos for the taste.”
“Masturbation?” Castiel frowned. He’d much rather just fool around with Dean.
Castiel gave him a look like he was insane and Dean passed his hands through his hair. Alright, then. Dean had stopped fiddling with the clothes and apparently Castiel was ok with how they were now, because he didn’t say anything. He just panted and groaned like he was in pain. Dean wanted to help him, but aside from trying to rub his back, he had no idea what else to do.
Dean smiled back. Yeah. He was willing to believe that. “So Meg… runs the books?”
“Dean. Dean, it’s time. Dean,” Castiel tried. “Let me go.”
“I hope not,” Castiel looked down to make sure Dean was still sleeping. “I have a bad feeling about this. I’m clean, but I was clean last time, too.” Charlie raised her eyebrows at that and he amended. “Well, I don’t actually sell state secrets or support terrorist groups.”
So far they’d worked together surprisingly well, right down to not having to fight over food, it seemed. He’d been a little wary yesterday, but awful taste aside, the fruit Castiel handed him had been filling and hadn’t made him sick.
“Oh.” Castiel said. “I heard you sing the other day.”
“Sorry,” Cas apologized, reaching for another tissue and blotting at his eyes. “Your shirt,” he noticed and reached into the tissues box again to dab at it uselessly.
“I’ll never forgive you if this doesn’t work,” Dean threatened coldly.
The door said ‘Sam Campbell’ and Dean scoffed. He wished he could have left the name Winchester and all that it stood for behind himself, but Dean had chosen to redeem it instead. Make the world a better place and have it stand for justice again. For helping the innocent. Sam had chosen to abandon it along with everything else.
“The one where I get to work with this cute, green-eyed idiot,” Castiel snarked back.
Touching dead bodies at crime scenes and being shot at were two different things though. Dean knew that. Rationally, he knew that. But he was itching for a confrontation and Cas was the only one who was here. “Alright, Novak. What other powers do you have?”
“I better finish it before Charlie gets jealous,” Castiel decided. Charlie probably wouldn’t mind, but he’d take his alone time with Dean where he could. When Dean nodded the affirmative, Castiel took another long gulp, swallowing before focusing back on Dean. “And how was your day?”
“There’s more fun ways to do that,” Dean suggested.
Dean opens his eyes and he’s still in the barn, but it’s empty now; no vampires, no Sam. He reaches back and feels for the wound, expecting pain or for his hand to come away bloody, but nothing. Oh, right. He remembers, just as a reaper shows up for him.
“You’re so sexy, Dean,” Castiel whispered. “The way you open up for me, the way you lean into it, seeking more.” Right on cue, he added two fingers.
“I wasn’t…” Castiel felt a flush creep up his neck. Yes, he was. And he needed to cut it the fuck out.
So of course, something had to ruin it.
“Yeah.” Castiel pretended to be stricken. Actually, his idea had worked perfectly. With a few hitches, but he could overlook those. He’d definitely come out of this a lot richer than he went in. And not just monetarily. He had Dean now. And Dean was worth losing some land over. “We’ll start fresh somewhere else,” Castiel promised her, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder.
Ana sniffed and turned away, focusing her suddenly spiked anger on Castiel. “You stupid idiot. Why did you not go below deck?”
Castiel snorted. “I have been off the clock since 4 pm, Mr. Winchester. Unless you want to sign my paid overtime form? Then I’d be happy to leave those bottles unopened.”
The sharp crack of impact stopped the boar’s momentum but didn’t knock it out like Dean had hoped. Instead, the boar simply changed direction and headed straight at Dean. Castiel had turned in the commotion and aimed his gloved hand, shooting an energy beam at the boar before Dean could bring his stick around again. The boar let out a high-pitched shriek and fell onto its side. It still wasn’t dead, but Dean didn’t hesitate. He used his branch to bash the boar’s head in.
Dean shrugged. “It’s ok to be a little mean to people who deserve it.”
Dean paused, then holstered his gun once again. “Oh-kay.” He drawled it out in such a way that Castiel knew he didn’t believe him.
“You just had her kicked out?” Dean asked.
Jimmy smiled. “You really like him, don’t you?”
“Well, maybe you’re just too powerful for even sigil blood magic to work on you,” Balthazar suggested.
Castiel smiled. “That’s all I want.” He stood up and tugged Dean out of his chair as well, pulling him into a proper hug. Dean relaxed into him and sighed and Castiel made up his mind about the rest of this night. “You’re coming home with me,” he announced.
Suddenly there was an ethereal glow moving to the window and blocking any further incoming bullets. Castiel turned around and saw Jessica and Garth holding hands while they both did movements with their respective free hand while mumbling a spell. He’d never seen such a strong protective spell and watched on in awe until the shield came back down and Jessica collapsed in exhaustion.
Castiel allowed it, wrapping his arms around Dean’s waist. “Fine. You can watch me and then I’ll watch and guide you. I’m gonna have to lead you a lot in the beginning.” He slid his arms up Dean’s sides, under his arms and stretched them up over his head. He took the opportunity to gently stroke Dean’s skin at the same time. “A little like this,” Castiel explained, trailing his fingertips down Dean’s back and slipping just barely underneath his pants, tracing Dean’s hips.
“So…” Dean started and finally reached for his coffee. “What are your plans for Christmas?” He took a large gulp of the black liquid, happy when it burned going down. It was better than the numbness that was quickly starting to spread. He was looking at Cas over the rim of his mug but Cas avoided eye contact.
“Yeah,” Castiel smiled a little. “Mine, too.” It seemed to be an unspoken agreement that this included keeping Dean safe, first. “Do you have any intel on this?”
But they should still have a few more months of being left unbothered. Enough to make sure this world would be able to survive on its own, without the need for future interference. Still. Castiel bit his lip and glanced at Dean. He should send a message to Anna now, while he was so close to the ship. The boost from his ship’s remaining tech would increase the chance that she actually got it. If Michael’s people found them first…
“Ginger, lemongrass and ginseng.” Castiel smiled at him and slipped back into bed. “It should give us some energy for the day.”
“It’s just… this feeling I got.” Castiel shrugged. “It’s probably just a coincidence.”
Dean stopped with the fork halfway to his lips. “But then why are you trying to fatten me up?”
Castiel conceded and they started going through the Men of Letters’ library. It didn’t take long for Sam to join in as well. He didn’t even ask questions, just nodded when they explained their theory and grabbed a tome.
“Do we have to talk about it?” Dean asked, handing over Castiel’s mug as soon as he had settled.
“Cas!” he cried, spilling into Castiel’s hand, happy to feel Castiel follow him soon after.
Castiel took a deep breath. “I was going to tell you eventually.”
He had also picked up basic toiletry packages that they thankfully sold in the motel so they wouldn’t need to go into any stores with cameras. He knew the Impala was not inconspicuous though and if anyone wanted to track them, they’d probably succeed. But they should be safe for one night.
ok?” he asked.
Jimmy looked up, surprised. “Actually, yes, it was.”
Dean nodded and gave him a quick, closed mouthed kiss before rolling out of bed. “Well, alright then, sleepyhead. You can join me in the shower.”
“I have time,” Castiel offered.
While the jungle below them kept growing and flourishing, the trees closest to their cave did not multiply at the same miraculous rate, and had started to run out of fruit. Today, Castiel had had bad luck at trying to spear a boar and it was too late to go fishing instead. Dean would have appreciated the meat, but he’d mostly wanted the boar for its skin. The pelts would be great to drape in front of their cave as protection. None of his fabrics would be strong enough to withstand the elements but the pelts would harden enough, and if he had a few of them, he could sew them together before blasting them with an energy beam from his suit to speed up the process.
