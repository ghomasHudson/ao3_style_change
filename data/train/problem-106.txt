"Pick a word that's easy to remember, but not something that comes up in everyday conversation, say, 'microscope'." John grins. "That might get awkward, if you catch my meaning. It is a commonly used word in the flat."
Oh my gaawwwd, why is this story taking forever? Why can't my boys just bugger each other already so I can wrap this up and move on to other things?
"Shhh...be still."
John's cock is dripping way too much to considered anything other than obscene. Pre-cum is splattering all over the floor in decidedly decadent splotches. Abruptly it's all too much. He hears himself growling, delirious with lust and needing to
And now, 15,000 words later, we finally get to the down and dirty.
John's inner captain bellows angrily.
Sherlock shivers with lust. "Yes, John. I believe that you are right."
I am working on wrapping this one up so that I can get working on a lengthy and very exciting crossover. Also, I'm going to tidy up The Holmes series and try to finish it before I start wearing dentures. If it seems like I'm leaving this with loose ends, be assured that I'll revive it when I get writer's block. The same goes with the Sally/Jim busting chops thingamajig. It is why these two stories were started in the first place.
"I might, puh- possibly," Sherlock stutters, full-on shivering. "I'm rather skilled at deduction." His teeth flash, a shaky attempt to ignore his bodily mortification. "Tragically, however, rumours speak to a circumstance whereby I missed something, a fact of great significance. Indulge me, Sir? I'd be remiss not to inquire." John ignores him, rather opting instead to walk away "John?"
Well, that  seemed overly theatrical when a flash drive would have done quite nicely.
Limbs flying, Sherlock's thrashing side-to-side. He's a panicked turtle flipped upon his back, crazed in an overwhelming paroxysms. He's blind and deaf to John's eureka moment, which the captain realises simply won't do. John spies his chance and traps Sherlock, hands vice-like around his ankles. "I told you to be still, man. For shame." The captain clears his throat. "I
Ha. So much for longer chapters. *Couldbe smiles awkwardly  and unplugs her laptop.*
"Insubordination, private! Whore's drawers! Exactly who in this room gave the order for you to touch yourself?" Captain Watson bellows so forcefully that the detective's teeth vibrate up against his lips.
"Hmmm?" This is not the direction John anticipated Sherlock to go. Frankly, he's having difficulty keeping up, what with that mesmerising voice and that
John peers at his watch and eye-balls Sherlock's throbbing carotid.
Sherlock's cock. It's standing at attention, full stop. The last lingering shame ebbs away. John's so relieved. It's all okay. It's all okay, Sherlock is definitely okay. He's not afraid or upset, or worse, angry. It's all fine. Sherlock's dripping, gagging for release, and Captain Watson is just the man to fulfill the private's needs. Just like that, it's turned around...the game is
Yes. His blogger's a sneaky, sneaky bastard - in sheep's clothing, no less - and no-one can convince the genius otherwise.
John blows steam and exhales a sigh of contentment.
"No, you sodding twat, I was not," the little man actually smirks. "So very sorry, my love. Especially since I've a use for those later."
Sherlock's body writhes so energetically he feels he's doomed to tumbling off the mattress. He's so sensitive he fears he'll not last two minutes; that is, if and when John ever decides to bugger him. He mewls, keens, cries out, a kitten drowning in a burlap sack.
"Ack!" The private rears at the unexpected contact, his fringe just brushing the tip of John's nose. The captain's touch feels like a bolt of electricity; the shocking surge of pain-pleasure-panic galvanising his brain, Dr. Frankenstein's monster brought to life. Cold cunning logic, co-pilot to his brain, suits up and fastens it's safety belt. Syllogistics - it's Sherlock Holmes' superpower. Approximately 50 milliseconds later, Private Holmes' mouth opens to give report. "Apologies," he says, cool, calculating and confident,  "for the delay. There was a problem, and it's been dealt with."
Sherlock, stiff as a board, stays silent. His muscles are sinewy rather than bulky. They line the length of his limbs tight as steel cording. Swallowing, John wonders if Sherlock's long-held position has led to cramping. The captain steps back to provide Sherlock with more space. "At the very least, private, straighten up a bit. At ease." Nothing doing, the man might well be a lawn ornament. "Back straight. Head up, chest out. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart." The bloody git does nothing. "Now, soldier", John barks, kind of losing his shit.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes, Sir!" Sherlock bawls.
But, first, he needs to do a bit of shopping. Milk is not on the list.
" he spits, "or at least for the moment, in this chair. So listen up, you bloody egotistical blowhard. You. Will do. Exactly what I order you to do, and nothing else." John threads deceptively gentle fingers through his locks, and then yanks
"Two?" John titters madly. "Two. Not what I expected. Fine, alrighty, then. Do carry on." Feeling playful, John reaches in to tweak both of Sherlock's nipples.
"Thank you," the private pants wetly, lapdog he. "Captain Watson, I...thank you." Sherlock's language skills are crumbling and the transport's clearly gone daft. He's shivering, quivering, quaking painfully, a sodding mess.
Take the presence of combustibles in the kitchen, for an example. Fingers in the fridge. Eyeballs in the microwave. Bloody harpoon propped up against the Victorian-styled wallpaper. Mrs. Hudson never did get all the traces of pig blood removed, despite dabbing at it with cold water for over an hour. She took it out of their rent, of course. A silly gesture, really, muses Sherlock. Mrs. Hudson promptly rendered the censure useless, using it to purchase several items from Sainsbury for her boys.
expecting a clear answer, but no, you're not that clever. If you would be so kind as to repeat the question?"
(See the end of the chapter for
John throws back his head and roars, pelvis pumping furiously. Sherlock feels his lover's cock throb, and scorching liquid floods his centre. "Fuck, fuck. Sherlock, fuck, I love you so much. That was brilliant." He drops, forehead clunking carelessly on Sherlock's collarbone.
And just like that, John is done being a tyrant. He throws a wobbly now and again, with good reason; fits of temper a natural by-product of sharing life with a maniac. This here, though, saps his energy. John intends to store whatever precious energy he spares now of. If he's lucky, John plans to make use of it elsewhere. His left shoulder aches, Sherlock's walloping straining his joint. It feels a bit knackered
"No, I don't want 'tea'," John snarls, aping his partner's tone, "you twat. What I want is a bloody explanation for today's news!" He pursues his query by slapping that morning's paper over Sherlock's head. "Now!"
"Despite you're being a manipulative bastard, I'm intrigued," John steps back.
By and large, John is a considerate man. He moves around the experiments with courtesy - and more than a modicum of caution, in deference to their value to The Work. Yes, it is true that
I see my knees slipping and unable to find purchase on the leather." It's true, the man keeps slipping, sodden leather producing trumping sounds as he moves.
"Sir..." the private burbles, lips drooping. The bottom one is slightly swollen.
The genius squeals, wriggling furiously. It's unclear if he's chasing the touch or dodging it. Sherlock's lips shape a protest which his airless chest cannot support. He's being accosted, attacked, tickled, teased, and fucking tormented with a bloody hellish peacock feather. It drags across his thighs, toes, nose, arsehole. The touch is agonisingly exquisite, a flicking lick kissing his supremely sensitive rim. Sherlock's glad he takes the time to trim and buff his fingernails, else bloody crescents would mar his biceps.
He must wait. The Captain plans of demonstrating precisely how a commander's respect is earned. The small man grits his square, even teeth, begrudgingly easing away from that smell.
lust-filled behavior. Bitter-tasting bile burns rancid, utterly despoiling Sherlock's taste.
"Ah, smart move, soldier. Now head north-east,

, so says Mycroft. In his head he hears the dooming snap of engaging locks sharp as a slap to the face. The loathsome weight of steel tugs at bony wrists. That had surely hurt more than it ought of, but then again, at the time he was two stone lighter.
Taken at face value (which in Sherlock's case, is never wise to do), the movements shape a familiar, standardized sequence. One dot, and three dashes - the letter "J". In Morse code. Determinedly, his lover's phallus dips three times slowly in succession.
"No, Captain...I mean, yes, Captain. Everything is perfectly satisfactory. If you are ready Sir, I'll to pay my dues.
I am still not 100% back on my feet after Covid, unfortunately, and have also returned to teaching. Let me tell you, dear readers, it's a strangely  awkward thing to write sex scenes after reading "The very Hungry Caterpillar" to a Bambi-eyed class of preschoolers.
"Good God," the captain chortles, "we're not at sea, Private. Do keep up." He reaches to peel the spoon from the hob with a
John smartly snaps the newspaper, folding it in half, and then quarters. "Hand me a biro, will you? I've figured it out on my own. Surprising, really, considering that I'm a complete idiot. Yes, now I have it. It starts with a capital "s".

Damn, he's turned into a milksop.
opinion." The detective swears he catches the susurrus of short fingers effecting air quotes.
He parses through recorded data whilst simultaneously putting his tangled hair to rights. Neither task is going well.
"Yes, Sir," Sherlock bleats, humiliated at his obvious weakness.
John's not blinked once since his playful nip. He'd have heard. Worse, he's aware of John's physical distancing of himself.

"Let's play," John growls, throwing down the gauntlet. The phrase seems to tumble from his tongue, the words weighty in their quintessential John-ness. Sherlock
"Private," John snorts, "what's your point?" Best to keep the man talking before he caves in to the implied suggestion and hunts it down.
Sherlock catches a change. John's hands are touching a heavier weight of paper.
Obviously, Sherlock is demanding about sex.
I went back through the previous chapters and found some glaring errors in the narrative. Hopefully, I edited them all out.
John's high-pitched giggle mixes with his lover's. "Poodle? How the bloody hell did you come up with 'poodle'?"
funny, with my funny little brain and low IQ. How little you must care, soldier, for your captain." Sherlock's lips refold themselves from smirk to straight line at the words. "I am here to inform you," John seethes, "you vain, self-centred tit, you've compromised our company's morale."
"I see a foolish private acting out of bounds, Sir. He's incorrigible, not fit for duty. He needs to be taken in hand."
Sherlock salutes, sporting a shit-eating grin. "Yes, Sir!"
"John! Don't be obtuse!" Sherlock snaps.
The detective startles, fuming instantly.
"Immensely so, Captain. Thank you. You always do take such good care of me," the genius whispers. "How is it that you
John smirks, his cock happily twitching in approval.
The burbling plop of a blob of single cream interpolating with a hot liquid.
Sherlock caves, curling inward for self-preservation whilst John plays his rib cage like a banjo. He struggles for air, his nose mashed up against slick leather cushions. John's called checkmate. Sherlock lays down his queen in defeat.
Penetration of the Center: having fast, elite forces smash at a specific point in the enemy line while reserves hold your opponent and drive quickly and immediately for the enemy's base
"Uhhh," Sherlock bumbles. "Sorry, Sir. I'm unsure of what precise information you're seeking." He shifts awkwardly, knees beginning to ache.
John cuts him off. It's just like the wanker, too busy running his mouth whilst bare-arsed to remember that he's fending off a spanking. "Private Holmes. I've indulged you enough for one day. Stop jabbering, dickwit, and get on with it; else I lock your sorry arse in the glasshouse."
"whilst keeping your own mess kit pristine and hanging in the wardrobe - poncy bastard - but treat your captain's favourite jumper like shit-stained loo paper."

There's a split plank of oak in the hallway. Besides being a death trap for splinters, it squalls like a cat in the Thames. They've circumvented that board since the day John yanked what for all intents and purposes was a shiv from his toe. Yet, glued to the couch; bound, blind and gasping, aching and spent, his nerve endings overly-sensitized, Sherlock hears it squeal. He snaps out of his fog only to find soggy clots of...something...in his mouth. Ah, balled-up bits of grimy well-worn leather. Christ, at some point, he's gone and gnawed the upholstery.
************************
"So, on me," Sherlock detective squeaks, quickly coughing to cover the noise. He's not a sissy, for Christ's sake. "And so...what would happen next, that is, after I put them both on?"
Sherlock's heart pounds so madly that John actually hears it. He rolls his eyes up, wondering what mischief the married ones are on about now. "Private Holmes!"
Nothing of interest supervenes; rather, a Mycroftian-sized fat lot of nothing. Some metalli...no, some animate creature is creating the racket. It's a cricket.
As usual, Sherlock has absolutely no comprehension of John's nonsensical ramblings. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters but this: he needs John to tickle him again- using handcuffs, and rope if necessary. They were always kitted up with rope at 221B.
But wait...something's wrong. Sherlock right foot is bobbing up and down. Fidgeting is shameful behavior. It broadcasts his loss of composure.
But, he'll wait, nonetheless. Sherlock would be lost without his blogger.
"I can hear you breathing, you know," Sherlock snarls blindly. "Dirty pool, Captain Watson, dirty pool." He's utterly exposed. It's not a good feeling. Seeking shelter from the refrigerator is pointless, but he edges closer anyway. It's not as if a bag of thumbs can be weaponized.
John lunges in, snogging Sherlock within an inch of his life. The men flounder about, each struggling for physical control. To John's secret delight, piteous whimpers escape Sherlock's lips. It would horrify the genius to recognize these utterances as his own. They're desperate, the mewling of a cat rampant with heat. Fortunately for them both, Sherlock's mind is lost in oblivion. His brain has switched off, floating in a chemical flood of lust.
"My my, Private Holmes. If only you could see what you look like, bent over like some back alley whore," the Captain smirks. Sherlock knows that John is smirking. He knows it by the timbre of John's voice, and the subtle changes in inflection that develop when he flashes that one-sided smile.
Sherlock presses closer to him, one hand coming up to grip his jumper. He scrunches the material between long, pale fingers. “Make it go away,” he begs, his voice almost faltering. The pitiful sound of him makes John’s heart clench in sympathy. The ordeal finally seems to be breaking his resolve.
John came hard in his jeans, over his own hand, curling into Sherlock as his cock pulsed rapidly and spurted several wet streams of cum into his underwear. Sherlock huddled around him, glancing sideways to ensure nobody was being overly intrusive to their activity, while John shuddered through it, his breathing heavy and ragged. As his body gradually relaxed, all John could do was lean into him, spent and slightly breathless, until he recovered his strength.
Sherlock Holmes. Was
That's probably true; the less they speak to the staff, the better. If they let anything slip it could prove disasterous, but John knows this already and probably wouldn't take kindly to a reminder, however well-intentioned he would mean it. The last thing he wants to do is disappoint John again by showing so little faith in him. In fact, he's coping well so far; he's earned a break. The feel of solid earth under his feet for a few hours wouldn't hurt, and might be just the boost he needs for what Sherlock has planned tomorrow.
The sounds Sherlock was making in his ear— grunting, panting with effort, certainly weren’t helping. His lips were brushing against him occasionally, accidentally, just beneath his earlobe. It was all so painfully intimate. Almost indistinguishable from the real thing. And combined with the see-saw swaying of his slender hips as they ground against John in just the right way…
Sherlock’s arm slipped away from him. “Would you rather explain why we’re
Sherlock puts on his most expressive pout. “But you haven’t even looked in the bag.”
John gave him a suspicious look. “Why?” he breathed, but Sherlock only smiled to himself and settled back in his seat.
John frowns down at his phone. The
The pain in his temples pounds ever harder. “Whatever helps settle your nerves. But I do hope you did more than simply eat and drink your way around the ship all day. We are rather on a time-limit.” He considers bringing up the flirting as well, but he’s not in the mood to be accused of jealousy again and besides, he knows where he stands where John is concerned. That wishful ember was smothered long ago.
“Shaddup. Just spin the bloody bottle already.”
It was perhaps the wrong thing to say at that moment. “You didn’t let someone know?!” His limbs stiffen and his weight shifts, pressing Sherlock’s head beneath the water again. He kicks harder, resurfacing with a groan and spitting the water from his mouth. He has to keep John calm— at this rate he’ll drown them both, just like he almost did in the pool.
“Yeah, I dunno about this,” John said cautiously. “Don’t get me wrong, I love a good snog as much as anybody. Just not sure I fancy the idea of having to wrestle tongues with you or Anderson. No offence.”
? How do they stand it?”
He raises an eyebrow. “I believe your exact words were, ‘I’d live.’”
But it’s too late; Sherlock’s mind is sparking with questions and leaping to conclusions and bubbling with ideas, and oh, this
Sherlock had no control over this situation from his position across the room, and neither did John; this was
“And no hand-tying,” Sherlock hastened to add, to which both Molly and John nodded. “The blindfold should suffice. If someone tries to cheat, we can think up some kind of penalty for it.”
“Is there anything off-limits?” he forces himself to say, traitorous mind already running through the possibilities in his imagination.
His blood chills.
“And once received, it is glanced at for approximately five seconds in total, before being forgotten on a mantlepiece for a day or two and then ending up in the rubbish bin.” He scowls, deepening the crinkle across the bridge of his nose. “Does that strike you as money well spent?”
“Christ, Sherlock, that’s good…” he heard himself say. It was a different angle than he was used to, in a pleasing way, and felt better than his own hand. Sherlock seemed surprisingly good at this for somebody who presumably never masturbated himself.
!” he yells, his calm snapping like a tightly wound string. Panic prickles along his skin and raises the hairs on the back of his sweaty neck. He tries again to push Sherlock out of the way but those big, solid hands return and hold him in place. It takes every last scrap of his control to not lash out and remove them by force. “Sherlock, I’m not kidding. Let go.”
A hand touches him on the shoulder. “Doctor Watson.”
The MV Aurora pulls into port at Cagliari at the turn of midnight, completing the first leg of its circular journey around the Med. As the gangway is secured, John joins him on the promenade to watch the passengers as they filter off the ship.
“That’s not very helpful,” John says, leaning against the doorframe to watch him. Sherlock flicks the bedside lamp on and stoops to reach underneath the bed, pulling out a black travel suitcase. He tugs the zipper open in one smooth motion and begins packing items inside.
“Woah, hang on a minute,” John said, sitting forward in his chair, “so it’d just be the blokes playing a kissing game while the ladies watch? Is that what you’re suggesting?”
At first, Sherlock knew exactly what he was doing. Okay, so this wasn’t exactly his area. Of all the ways people could be observed and understood, Human intimacy was the one thing he’d never quite been able to crack. But he was an excellent mimic; even if he didn’t feel what others felt, he could still replicate their actions. It was a simple matter of mechanics. But here was a perfect opportunity to kill two birds with one stone.
On the surface, John was an unremarkable man. In the months before meeting Sherlock, his life had been following the time-old script of the soldier returned home from war, injured and struggling to rediscover his place in common society. Had it not been for his limp, it would have been so easy to overlook him, to dismiss him off-hand as not worthy of a second glance.
He takes a shaky breath and closes his eyes, as if he can’t bare to see John’s reaction. “I am so sorry if this means the end of our friendship, John, but I fell in love with you the first day we met and it only got worse from there.”
“I mean this, the whole letters… thing.”
He let go of Sherlock’s wrist then, his breath catching in his throat when those long, slim fingers curled around his cock. Their lips glided together again as John fumbled at Sherlock’s shirt buttons, hell-bent on getting his hands on the lean, muscular torso beneath.
Sherlock considered this quietly for a few minutes. “Do we have to
John laughs so hard that he nearly spills his tea. Oh, this is going to be good. He should snap a photo of a tanned Sherlock for posterity. Or possibly blackmail; the kitchen is overdue for a good cleaning. “So where are we going, Mahon? Ciutadella?" he asks, reigning in his amusement. "Do we know where this bloke is hiding?”
He can barely stand to swim more than a few meters before his posture collapses and he is unable to mask the sound of misery that claws its way out of his throat.
The second he’s able to, he calls out with all his strength. “John!”
Maybe the fact that he killed a man to save Sherlock's life on the very first night had something to do with it. But to be fair, Sherlock saved him first.
John meets her eyes. When did she even see them together? “He’d probably say some very choice words and then sulk over it for a few days. I wouldn’t recommend it.”
“Don’t I?” Sherlock said. He straightened, looking into John’s hooded eyes. That gave him an idea. “Let’s take a scientific approach then, shall we?”
“I’m not entirely sure what just happened,” Sherlock admitted. He swallowed heavily. “I didn’t mean… But, I’ve never felt…
As John struggled to kick his mind back into gear and figure out exactly what this ploy was supposed to be, he felt a pair of hands come to rest on the back of his chair, and then the lips returned, firmer this time, and with them came the uneven breath Sherlock had been holding back before. He felt Sherlock’s body looming over him, and he had to tip his head up further to accommodate him. Sherlock’s mouth slid against his own, parting in a manner that could be nothing short of deliberately intimate. Before he knew what he was doing, John was returning the kiss with zeal.
?” she presses. The question strikes a nerve. Maybe there have been lingering glances on occasion. An odd spark in the air, moments of tense silence after a chase, when the criminal is caught and the only sound in their ears is their heaving breaths and wheezing, disbelieving laughter. But it’s the cases that get Sherlock’s heart pumping and his adrenaline flowing. Of course there’s going to be odd moments; that’s just the nature of the beast.
Mycroft glares at Sherlock, who is too busy wiping his face dry to retaliate. Apparently this was something John was never meant to hear.
Close-up, he could see that Sherlock had already cut several letters out of various magazines, and had arranged them in rows by his feet. There were a multitude of colours and typefaces; some bold, some elaborately curly, some with drop-shadows. It took John a moment to realise that he’d spelt out most of the phrase ‘Happy Birthday’ and had the beginnings of what would probably end up being ‘Mrs Hudson’.
Sherlock seems mildly amused by it all, obstinately blocking him even as John tries to pry his grip away. Beneath him, the ship begins to tip in an entirely new direction, and he has no choice but to stop fighting and grab fistfuls of Sherlock’s shirt for stability. He swallows down a wretched wave of sickness, squeezing his eyes shut against the rising urge to vomit.
,” Sherlock sulked.
John hesitates. “Say something if you run into trouble, okay?”
At last the game was underway. It took him a while to grasp the rules, but soon John found himself quite enjoying the spectacle. Sherlocked appeared neither impressed, nor particularly bored by it. In fact, he seemed to be fidgeting a lot in his seat. If John didn’t know better, he’d say he looked distracted.
?!'" he exclaims, a little louder than intended in the quiet cabin. What does that even mean? Is that John's nickname for him, or something he picked up from Lestrade's crew of braying hyenas? He leans closer, hushing his voice. “First of all, that makes absolutely no sense. I am not
And just like that, his mood plummets like a lead anchor. “Lovely,” he growls, what resolve he had moments before dissolving like acid in his gut. “Always on the pull. Glad your priorities are in order, but do try to remember why we’re here. Sex traffickers, lives at stake, that sort of thing? You can let your mind wander south later when we’ve done our job.”
And nevertheless there is a nugget of truth in the fact that his preening and posturing is largely for the sake of watching John's dazzled reaction. His awed utterances of 'brilliant' and 'amazing', as often as they come, never grew old. Not the way he says it. Not when everything Sherlock does to impress him has the same full effect, as if John could no less grow tired of being amazed by Sherlock as Sherlock is of amazing him.
Sherlock gives a long-suffering sigh. “They can’t ‘handle him.’ Weren’t you paying attention earlier?”
) he nodded curtly and waited for the first uncomfortable invasion of his personal space.
Something pale reaches above the water twenty meters away from his current position, give or take. It’s gone a second later, but it’s all he needed. He plunges forward into a front crawl, arms arcing out of the water, legs kicking furiously behind him. The ache in his torso becomes a searing pain that makes his limbs jerk and stars bloom in his vision. He doesn’t stop. His soaked clothes drag against his efforts, sapping the energy from rapidly tiring muscles, but he pushes through it, quickly closing the distance.
Greg nodded in agreement. “Alright. So, first thing’s first…” He proceeded to clear a small space on the table, pushing aside empty bottles and glasses and putting a few gift boxes on the floor underneath to lay one of his empty beer bottles flat on its side on the table’s surface. With a flick of his wrist, he set it spinning, and a few seconds later it settled… on him. His cheery expression fell instantly. “Oh, bollocks.”
“Sorry,” John shook his head, still grinning at the mental image. At this entire situation. This was ridiculous; here they were, trapped in a car boot, tied together with Sherlock frotting against him as if his life depended on it, because it actually did. John’s mind stuck picturing Mycroft in a brassier and lacy panties. Ripples of laughter ran through him, made unsteady by Sherlock’s movements.
“I’m not afraid of death, but I am afraid of dying without having let you know how much I’ve appreciated your companionship these past few years. You’ve become incredibly important to me, and I believe you have a tendency to undervalue your worth. But that is, admittedly, partially my fault.”
Anderson huffed. “By and large, I don’t think any of us is particularly keen on kissing or being kissed by anyone else here. I don’t think we have to worry about any funny business going on.”
“That’s why God invented the weatherman.”
“Why?” he snaps. “Do you think you’re being noble? Hoping to score extra points with the man in the sky once you keel over? Don’t be stupid, John. You’re throwing your life away for no—”
“You won’t sink. Trust me.”
“What are you smiling about?” Sherlock asks, bemused.
“Oh?” Sherlock theatrically looked around at the ceiling. “So there are. I wonder if anybody’s watching through them?” And with a coy grin, he prised John’s hand away and left him standing there, his fly undone and his cock out in full view.
“I fail to see how this is my problem,” John complains as he’s pouring himself a cup of tea, and he can hear the resulting pout all the way from the living room.
, indeed.
“You really think I’d try the same thing twice?” John said, almost managing to sound offended at the notion that Greg really thought him that stupid. But the D.I. shook his head.
“Those are electrical burns, are they not?”
“What a case,” Sherlock agrees, swinging the front door shut behind them. He unwinds the scarf from his long neck and tosses it over a hook on the wall.
He just had to ask. Could they? Was he…?
That same man sat across from him now in the tiny chip shop, staring thoughtfully into his plate. Whatever troubled him was a mystery. He knew it was something about what happened in the boot of that car. But it couldn’t be such a simple thing as embarrassment, could it? That simply didn’t make any sense.
Greg wrapped the scarf around his own eyes and tied it loosely behind his head. Satisfied with the fit of his blindfold, he clapped his hands together. “Okay, now someone else spin the bottle again, and whoever the lucky lass or lad is gets to give me a peck on the cheek. Then I’ll see if I can guess who it was. If I get it right, they have to drink.”
The ping of his phone draws his attention back. He’s grateful for the distraction, but the message is far from sympathetic.
“’Come and chase this dangerous kidnapper around on his big boat, or kiss the Posh Boy goodbye!’”
The memory of Sherlock’s words float back to him:
“Awright, how about this one: Kiss & Guess,” he announced to the pleasantly hazy group. He lifted his beer bottle to his lips in a mildly successful attempt at hiding a smirk, curious to see who might be brave enough to accept such a challenge.
Sherlock took a delicate sip of his single malt whiskey and frowned at himself. Try as he might, he couldn’t stop his pinky finger extending from the glass in his hand. How infuriating. If losing one’s ability to control their extremities was an expected side-effect of being drunk, he wasn’t sure what the appeal of it was supposed to be.
Greg pulled the scarf from his eyes. “Well I knew it wouldn’t be Mrs Hudson, and there’s nobody else in that direction from where I’m sitting, so…” He shrugged, smiling apologetically. “That round was a bit of a bust. Hang on, I’ve got an idea.”
John Watson: Blogger, Flatmate, Monumental
“Beautiful,” he murmured. “God, Sherlock. You are
It takes a few seconds for his intent to sink in. When it does, John digs his heels into the floor. His forehead creases with growing concern. “Sherlock.” His eyes grow impossibly wide. “Sherlock, don’t.” He shoves against Sherlock’s chest, but his grip is like a vice, and every effort to push him away only bringing John helplessly along with it. “I’m warning you, Sherlock. Don’t you
“I fucking knew it!” John exclaims, slapping his hand into the water and nearly upsetting their equilibrium in the process. “That’s what tipped them off you were coming. It made a bloody noise!”
With a parting smile, she turns to leave. John sinks back into his chair, eyes dancing around the room, hoping to God that Sherlock didn’t happen to be snooping around here at that exact moment. He can just picture the epic sulk that would ensue. It’s a relief when he recalls their text conversation from a few minutes ago, realising that wherever the morgue is, he can be pretty sure it isn’t anywhere near where they’re serving the food.
“Idiots,” Sherlock agreed, a smug grin on his face as he pulled out his phone. “They really thought they had us. You’d think the criminal classes would have learnt to stop underestimating us by now.”
He must have heard that same question a hundred times over the past three days. His tongue swipes across his bottom lip. “I wish you wouldn’t keep asking that.”
It was gone midnight, and the wind howled through the street beyond the living room windows, cold and aimless. John took his time in the shower. When he finally emerged, he simply wished Sherlock good night and climbed the stairs to his room.
The gallery owner, Mrs Patterson stood between them, with her back to John while she spoke to the detective. “You are as good as they say, Mr Holmes. Very good indeed. I can’t thank you enough for your assistance in this. That piece was a priceless work of art; our reputation would have been utterly destroyed had it not been recovered in such a timely fashion.”
“Yeah. They gave up, figured it had been too long. I wasn’t going to let them make that decision. I, ah, was still a bit wet at the time, though.”
At least they’re all suffering equally. Even Sherlock, who typically never looks put out by the weather, is looking alarmingly fatigued. Head propped up with one hand, he sits slouched over against the rattling door as he scans his cruise brochure with droopy eyes. Despite this, he’s hardly sweating at all. John knows a sign of severe dehydration when he sees it. He digs a bottle of water from his bag and tosses it into Sherlock's lap.
“Right.” Snippets of the past few hours play themselves back in John's ears, a white noise of Sherlock arguing with half the Met about some detail he seemed to think was being overlooked whilst everybody else seemed happy to call the case closed. Including John. He shakes his head in confusion. “Wait. I thought we were letting the Spanish police handle him? He’s not operating out of London anymore. As Lestrade would say, '
He’s not sure whether he’s still inhabiting his body, or floating somewhere above it. Brief, unknown sensations and half-remembered dreams tease at the edges of his mind. A flicker of light, and something touches his skin. Sharp— a familiar prick in his arm. He doesn’t so much feel it as observe it from afar. A chill spreads up his arm until it reaches his heart, and from there sends icy tendrils unfurling along every vessel in his body, numbing him, smoothing out his thoughts, turning his mind liquid and featureless.
“I wouldn’t bet on it,” he replies, wiping his mouth. He spits into the tissue and grimaces at the lingering foulness at the back of his tongue. “I could do with a drink after that.”
Mrs Hudson looked scandalised. “Oh really, Greg! I suppose I had better sit this one out, then, hadn’t I?”
The mystery of it piques his curiosity enough that he wills his fingers to move. They twitch, then curl in on themselves, weakly grasping the hand that covers them, and that voice —
ever want John in that way. So how could this — being together, being lovers, or partners, or whatever they’d call it — satisfy either of them in the ways they both needed? How could John be with someone whose touches and pleasures he could never give in return?
Sherlock’s eyes narrow in thought, returning to the case of the mysterious injury. “It must have happened some time after our stint in the sea, from the time we were rescued to you being here in the hospital. Judging by how they’re wrapped, I would say burns of some kind. Probably second degree. Any less and they wouldn’t look like that. Anything worse, and you’d not let me touch them at all.”
He needs time. Time to sort through the mess of his wounded ego and figure out Sherlock’s honest intentions. He’s in no state to be forgiving anything just yet. And besides… he’s not technically wrong.
Sherlock gazes at the stars. An entire arm of the Milky Way is silently watching over him from an unfathomable distance. There’s something oddly comforting about that. John once sat him down with a children’s book about the universe, pointing out pictures of different types of planets, nebulae, and stars. He thought it was trite at the time; a pointless waste of memory space, but somehow it stuck with him. He listened all night to John’s soft voice prattling on about concepts and phenomena that would never affect their daily lives, because there’s nobody else in the entire world who would even think to do that; to try and teach him something, to weather his attitude, his complaints. Despite himself, by the end of the evening Sherlock was rapt, and John had the warmest, most pleased with himself expression he’d ever seen.
“You’re soaked, it’s too dangerous!”
Sherlock could still remember the way his skin had tingled with delight the first time John had called him ‘amazing’. Even now it still had that same effect. His praise was a novelty that never wore off, steeped as it was in such genuine affection.
And on his part, it was a rare pleasure for Sherlock to have such a captive audience. John had, over the years, grown immune to his sudden bouts of musicality. In the beginning, it had always caused him to stop what he was doing, or drift into the living room if he was elsewhere, and just listen while Sherlock caressed some mournful tune out of his instrument. And Sherlock loved that, really. John had an unusual talent for making him feel special, as if he appreciated him not just for his mind or his keen deductive abilities, but for all these other useless parts of him too. His music would never solve a murder, would never uncover the secret identity of a blackmailer or lead anyone to a hidden cache of stolen riches, yet John was, at one time, as fascinated by it as everyone else was of his intellect.
He was right, of course. He was always right, especially when it came to matters concerning John.
He does look tired, John thinks. Not half as tired as John himself feels, but it says something that Sherlock lacks the energy to even fully conceal his fatigue. The dark circles under his eyes add years to his impossibly youthful face, making him look gaunt and harsh under the pale flourescent light in the kitchen. When this is all done, he should find a way to bribe a full night's rest out of him.
His jaw clenches. He shouldn’t have to put up with this nonsense. The worst of it is that John will get angry at
Regardless of anything else, John’s praise alone would be worth it.
Sherlock looms over him like a shadow. “You don’t want to go.”
John rises to his feet so fast it makes him dizzy. He cringes, sucking air through his teeth. “Tomorrow? Sorry, I can’t go. I’m totally swamped this week. The surgery is understaffed and I’ve been filling in for someone on maternity leave.” He turns to the sink, wringing out the tea-soaked cloth over the drain. Any excuse to hide his face, though Sherlock can still probably tell the lie for what it is just by the tone of his voice.
A silence fell over the group.
Throwing off the scarf again, Sherlock stormed back to the coffee table, plucked up his glass and finished off his Whiskey in one gulp, his pinky still ridiculously extended despite his furious temper. He slammed the empty glass back on the table (John winced, imagining it shattering and them having to spend the rest of the night stitching up his fingers) and threw himself back into his chair.
. I had no idea it would be so… populated. Luxury cruise?” He scoffs. “I’m finding it quite hateful so far. Inside, at least.”
John’s pulse quickened as Sherlock’s hand glided downward over his tensing stomach, towards the inner crease of his thigh, and brushed lightly over John’s fist as it moved rapidly over his cock.
What terrified him most of all was knowing he would allow it. If Sherlock took it upon himself to make the first move, John would follow unquestioningly, and doesn’t that sound just like him? Except, in this particular area, it went against everything he thought he knew about himself. Finally he had to admit, privately at least, that it is something he might actually want. There’s something there, some spark that he’s expended so much energy to deny in the past. After what they’ve both been through, he doesn’t think he can deny it much longer.
“Cor, that wasn’t much to go on,” Greg sounded disappointed. “But uh… I think I know anyway. That was Molly, wasn’t it?”
Panic momentarily gripped him when Sherlock was forced to rub his face along John’s crotch, because God knows what it smelled like down there. He froze, not daring to move an inch, until at last Sherlock’s upper-half was freed of its binds. John shuffled over to allow Sherlock to settle on the floor of the boot beside him, and together they made short work of the rope tying their legs.
“Ah.” He took out a piece and started munching, and was visibly surprised when Sherlock did the same, but his friend either ignored or simply didn’t notice his incredulous look.
“Not much. In hindsight it wasn't that good an idea to begin with.”
So he did it— John slipped his hand down the front of his trousers to touch the hard length of himself, in front of his best friend, while standing in broad daylight on Regent Street amidst hundreds of people. And it was incredible. Dangerous. So wrong, but it felt so good.
. And John was a man with a drive that could only be fulfilled in a certain way. The fact that it was technically considered illegal was of secondary concern in Sherlock's eyes to the more important matter of John’s wellbeing.
“There. At least direction can’t give it away now.” He sat back down and tied the scarf back around his head. “I’ll go again. Let’s give it a proper try this time, eh?”
“No.”
“Not that there would have been such evidence, either way.”
“John, watch me,” he urges, meaning to demonstrate how to tread the water, but at the sound of his voice John's blue eyes snap to his like a pair of magnets, and the fear in them is unlike anything Sherlock has ever seen. His usually brave, stalwart face is void of any sense of familiarity. John is no longer a man, but an animal fighting for survival. Sherlock's mind reels from it.
Mid-drink, John spluttered and choked, coughing into the sleeve of his arm. Well, this was a bit sooner than he’d anticipated. But he had. Sooner or later, he knew one of them was bound to be in that chair and the other was bound to be standing over them… But it was just a game, wasn’t it? He wasn’t sure why this suddenly felt like such a big deal. He hadn’t felt weird when it was Greg. Why should this be any different? Because they were flatmates? Best friends?
“You’re ticklish,” he chuckled, feeling a stab of deviousness when Sherlock glared at him.
Oh, he thought, a cold panic rising up his spine like a wave of frost.
The sun is bright and high overhead, burning his hands where they remain locked onto Sherlock’s flanks, propping him up on the surface with all that he has left to give. Sherlock must be burning, too, but there’s nothing he can do about it, there’s nothing to shield him with. The seas have warmed up during the course of the morning but he can barely feel it. His whole body is numb from exhaustion.
It was brilliant. Genius. He would win Greg’s silly little game, and find out what it was like to kiss John without making himself vulnerable. Then he’d tear off John’s blindfold and John would say exactly the same thing.
“Not until you admit it.” His fingertips press into John’s skin, as if expecting him to try to wrestle out of the hold. He might try it. “You need to stop avoiding this and deal with it. I need you.” He bites his lip, a flash of regret in his eyes. “I need you at your best on this case.”
Sherlock laughs freely. “You’ll have to get me here. We both know I can outrun you on dry land. Come on, you can do better than that!”
, and much like his deductive analysis, he seems unable to switch it off. If Sherlock thinks he has the solution to something then nothing in Heaven or on Earth will stop him from testing his theory. And Sherlock is well aware of this. He describes it as an itch he needs to scratch, otherwise it will occupy his mind and bother him constantly, but John thinks it’s probably a form of mild OCD. If it were limited to himself and his own possessions, that would be fine, but his need to control aspects of John’s life can sometimes border on intolerable. John knows he doesn’t mean ill by it, but all the same, Sherlock’s definition of ‘helping’ can be heavy-handed.
Sherlock lingered there, almost unsure, as if fighting some rebellious instinct to stay. But then the moment passed, and as the other broke contact, John felt, rather than heard, a soft release of breath against his mouth. He breathed in— whiskey. Definitely Sherlock, then. But surely that couldn't have been deliberate? He must have known John would recognise him from that alone. He’d given his game away.
“It’s like if I were to arrange a get-together in 221B for your next birthday without warning you. You’d like that, wouldn’t you? Ten, twenty people crowded in our little flat, laughing and dancing, sticking party hats on you and taking pictures?”
The coffee-soaked air has grown too sour to bear another second. Sherlock storms out of the café, ruffling his heat-flattened curls to feel the breeze through them again. If John needs this to take his mind off things… Fine. But he won’t need it for much longer. Tomorrow, Sherlock is going to teach him to swim. No more nausea, no more coping strategies, and no more flirting with anything that passes by him on two legs. No more
Sherlock presses into the touch, a plaintive whisper escaping him. “
“I’m not sure,” he says, studying the perfect line made by John’s thin, pressed lips. “You seemed adamant about not coming along. Then you changed your mind, all of your own accord.” He lifts a shoulder. “It is a mystery.”
A memory pricked at the back of Sherlock’s mind: The night they first met. Angelo’s. Candlelight gleaming in John’s bright, cerulean eyes. A look of bare-faced admiration, centred and directed at him like a sunbeam, honey-gold and warm. Nobody had ever looked at him that way before.
The bottle was spun. The group collectively held their breaths until it came to a stop, pointing towards Molly. Her eyes darted around, panic stricken. John jerked his head towards Greg, silently mouthing ‘go on then!’
“Yes, lucky you,” he said, bending down to plant a soft kiss on John’s stomach. He trailed more kisses down, shifting back on his knees until his face was hovering above John’s solid erection. “Especially considering that I do rather enjoy sucking cock.”
If only she knew how lucky she’d struck with that particular gem. Because as it turns out, Sherlock can only achieve orgasm when he's retreated into his Mind Palace, divorcing body from mind. It’s all too noisy in his head, he explains, such that he isn’t able to concentrate fully on the physical pleasure in order to allow it to overtake him. His brain simply won’t relinquish control long enough to let it happen.
The clunk of a car boot unlocking echoed through the underground level. Two things kept circling in John’s mind: One, that these thugs probably intended to kill them and dump their bodies somewhere they were unlikely to be discovered. And two, how much he wished it didn’t require the excuse of a hostage situation to be this physically close to his flatmate.
“Whatever for? This is a hospital ward, not a
The spinning bottle selected its next contestant. Sherlock grimaced, but nevertheless stood up to take his duty as kissee. He smoothed down his shirt, snatched the scarf from Greg and sat in the chair. Securing the blindfold (it already smelled of Lestrade,
“Wanna bet?” John growls, reaching out for him and grabbing nothing but air. Sherlock bounces easy circles around him in the water. “I will get you for this. Mark my words. In here or out there, either way, you’re in big trouble. This is
Well, that was the plan, at least. And if he’d stuck to it, it might’ve even worked.
“I don’t want to,” Sherlock pouts, his vocal chords catching on the roughness in his sore throat. He feels a familiar twinge in his lungs, another coughing fit threatening to bubble up at any moment, and suppresses it with all his might.
“Good point.”
human being John has ever known.
And if not? Well, a little sea-sickness won’t kill him.
—one thing to use against me,” John managed, pressing himself into the warmth of Sherlock’s palm. The deep chuckle by his ear was satisfying in ways that made little sense for mere sound. The smooth baritone rumbled through him on an express journey straight to his cock.
By the time they were rescued, he was dying not only of his wound and blood loss, but of his generally weakened state. At some point he slipped below the threshold of what his heart could endure and went into ventricular fibrillation. For how long, they don’t know. If it was more than a few minutes he could be brain-dead.
me with a puddle, there will be Hell to pay. Got it?”
. Is that what Sherlock did on the plane— install a tracking device on his phone? Couldn’t he at least have put it on silent, for Christ's sake? Now they'll be ready for him. He’ll be walking right into a trap! The kick of adrenaline sends a renewed burst of energy surging through his limbs. He twists in Mikhail’s grip, managing to wrench an arm free, and swinging his fist over his shoulder he makes solid contact with the man’s face. Mikhail grunts and stumbles back, but doesn’t release him. A second later, John’s nose breaks with a sickening crack beneath a well-placed punch.
“You arse!” he screeches, his voice choked. Water runs over his face in rivulets and sprays from his lips. “You prick! You absolute fucking prat, let go of me! Let go!”
“Wh-what are you doing?” John stammered, finding his hand suddenly trapped between them. Despite this, he was still fumbling to pull down his fly, even with his friend enclosing him with his body. He had no control over it.
John glances around the deck. “So this is what ‘Lido’ means. I wondered.” His eyes snap back. “Hang on. Are those mine?” He steps forward and plucks the sunglasses off Sherlock’s nose, glowering up at him in irritation. “Pickpocket. When’d you even get the chance?”
“Uh, before you get too carried away,” John hedged, “maybe you should try a different approach to this. Something that will end up looking a bit less like a threatening note from a kidnapper.”
“I’ll play, too!” Molly chirped, suddenly much more into the idea for some reason, though nobody seemed surprised. When Anderson also sat forward and declared himself in, Greg raised his eyebrows at John questioningly.
, no less — had shattered that boundary and left John reeling.
John approached him again, and after a moment of hesitation, slipped his arms back around Sherlock’s waist. When he looked up to meet his eyes, Sherlock slipped his hand around the nape of John’s neck and urged him forwards.
“’Kiss Cam’?” he parroted. “Is this some American thing? What’s—”
“John.
“I’m not going in—” They take another step back, and John glances down at their feet in alarm. Sherlock’s heels are dangling off the edge. John’s voice climbs comically high as Sherlock sticks one foot out over the water in an exaggerated gesture. “Sherlock, for Christ’s sake! My phone!”
"John, stay calm—"
“Sherlock—” John gasped, and then Sherlock’s soft, cupid-bow lips were pressed against his. Almost chaste, at first, but John’s current state and the reality of what was happening was tearing through him like a falling meteor, and he couldn’t hold back any longer. The kiss quickly turned carnal, and at the first insistence of John’s tongue, Sherlock’s lips parted and allowed him inside.
John hadn’t even realised they’d both eventually fallen asleep. He wakes when Sherlock stirs in his arms and stretches his long legs with an accompanying yawn, before curling back into himself like a cat. London’s sky is already dark outside their windows.
“No need to be catty, William,” Mycroft scolds, and John has had enough of this. Before he can react, John snatches the umbrella out of Mycroft’s hands, opens the window, and tosses it out. Then he stares down the room as, three floors below, they hear the wooden handle clatter onto the pavement. “All done?”
John throws up his hands to argue, but Sherlock interrupts before he can get a word in. “You had ample time to get some hours in last night. It isn’t my fault you chose instead to spend most of that time restlessly pacing about your room for some unfathomable reason—”
He means it as a joke, mostly, but Sherlock’s eyes pinch and his voice chokes. “Oh, John. Please forgive me for how I’ve treated you.”
“And secondly,” he adds, jerking his head towards the Tiki bar, “that sign over there says the pool’s closed. Bad luck! No swimming today.” His cheeks pull tight with satisfaction, but his victory is short-lived. Sherlock rolls his eyes.
His strategy was infallible: He would begin by throwing John off-guard, kissing him in the last place he’d ever expect, which of course was the lips. The shock of it would give him just enough room to orchestrate a perfect amalgam of every other attempt he’d observed that night. He would linger there just for a moment — not too short, but not too long — to cast doubt and suspicion over his identity. He would keep the touch light, but tender, and avoid brushing any part of his chin or cheeks, lest John feel a hint of stubble on his skin. His delay said Greg; His breath said Sherlock; His softness said Molly; His careful avoidance said Anderson. Sherlock could be any one of their group in that instant. He was everyone and no one. Most critically, however, he was anybody but his true self.
When the curtain of numbness pulls back again, he realises he’s still breathing. So he rests. It’s comfortable here, lying on something dry and solid and warm. The air smells freshly bleached, like their kitchen at home after John has spent the day scrubbing every surface until they gleam. Sometimes there’s an urge to open his eyes, to test the bounds of whatever reality he finds himself in. But it’s so easy to ignore. He’d rather drift for a while longer. He’s never enjoyed sleep so much as this.
All John could do was nod.
“I was turning it down,” Sherlock explains, his voice sleep-thick and a little slow from the opiates lingering in his blood. “The pain is manageable.”
A luxury cruise ship. A
This hand— he’s catalogued its every contour, every crease, every line. He knows it like he knows his own.
Small waves lap at his cheeks and occasionally spills across his mouth, but his noses remains beyond the water’s reach, and that seems safe enough for John nod his readiness. Sherlock then walks him through a beginner version of the backstroke, arms scooping the water in time with broad scissor-kicks, like those of a frog. It’s simple enough that Sherlock manages it despite the dwindling sensation in his legs. John takes to it with relative ease.
A moment later, Sherlock’s patience was rewarded.
Next time, he might not wake at all. Exhaustion is pulling him under. With nothing but miles of emptiness beneath his feet, he can’t carry on much longer.
Sherlock felt the tremor of indecision swaying him, torn as he was between pressing closer towards that which he so obviously longed for, and tearing himself away. Their lips barely parted, but neither of them moved, and Sherlock didn’t dare open his eyes just yet. “Have you ever known me to do something I didn’t want?” he whispered. Without waiting for a reply, he slid their mouths together again.
As they made their way home, Sherlock stared ahead, seemingly lost in his thoughts. He looked every bit as perfectly
“On the sea,” Sherlock supplies, watching him carefully. A light sheen of sweat blossoms over John's upper lip, and he shifts his weight. “Ah…”
.” And with that, Sherlock closes his eyes and takes a deep, steady breath. His hands drop to his sides and he goes entirely limp from head to toe, like his brain let go of the steering wheel and jumped out of the car.
“It might be, at this rate.” John huffs a tense breath. “Sherlock…”
As ever, Cluedo was ruled off-limits, so that Sherlock couldn’t embarrass himself with his unorthodox playing style. And spirits were too high, on the whole, to bring the mood down with a tedious, sobering game of Monopoly. They quickly grew bored of playing cards. Then, eventually, someone had the bright idea of playing Truth or Dare.
A short, miserable laugh escapes him. “Of course you will. You’ll try to accept it for the sake of our friendship, but inevitably things will get awkward. You’ll grow increasingly uncomfortable at home. You might even feel guilty for something neither of us can change. I never would have admitted this before, but after how it all nearly ended… I couldn’t go on pretending. I know you could never feel the same, and I— You wouldn’t want—”
“I… Love…?” Sherlock’s eyes suddenly went wide. Did he? Was that what this feeling was?
“Lord knows why everyone assumes they’re a couple,” Anderson muttered under his breath.
As the national anthem was being sung, Sherlock re-appeared next to him holding a big box of chicken wings, handing them over while he sat.
John groaned. “Why does that not surprise me?”
Mikhail is gone. The hall is empty, so John moves up, pressing himself against the door that Mindy and her stalker passed through moments ago. It’s impossible to hear anything outside except the rushing of water; for all he knows, Mikhail might be standing right outside the door, but he has no choice. He has to follow. Mindy could be being attacked at this very moment.
“Please, listen—!”
Reaching the bottom of the stairs, he barely catches sight of the bald man disappearing through a door labelled ‘Staff Only’. Mindy can’t be too far ahead of him.
He looked back at Sherlock. His friend’s breath was warm and steady against his lips, his eyes closed, perhaps thinking he should give John a modicum of privacy. But privacy isn’t what he needed right now. He needed to feel exposed, vulnerable. Sherlock was a shield around him that blocked the view of him from the crowds, and it was necessary, but John couldn’t bring himself off fully like this. He felt the stirrings of his orgasm drawing close, but couldn’t tip himself over the edge.
There’s a flutter of noise like bird’s wings as letters and case files spill onto the living room floor. “They’re refusing to provide assistance on the grounds that we don’t have a positive ID.”
Sherlock hasn't moved or made a sound, and his face is placid and relaxed. Feeling a bit bolder, John grips his hard length through the material and gives it a squeeze, then begins to stroke it with a slow, steady rhythm. Would this be enough to make him cum, he wonders?
“Shall we move to the bed?” he said in between gasps, and Sherlock nodded, walking him backwards across the room, still cocooned in his embrace. John’s heels contacted the foot of the bed and he lost balance, falling backwards and dragging Sherlock halfway down with him.
Talk is sparse once they get going, but he calls out to Sherlock every hour, or what he approximates is an hour, and Sherlock’s strained voice picks up in response. It’s a rasping, pitiful sound, but it’s always nearby. Sherlock’s plan to slipstream in his wake appears to be working, letting John really put his back into it. He cuts through the water despite the drag of his wet clothes and the cold creeping into his muscles. It’s given him hope. They can make it.
He hates it.
About an hour before they were due to leave, John knocked on the door to Sherlock’s room and was let inside. He sat nervously on the edge of the bed, quite obviously preoccupied with some matter on his mind. Eventually Sherlock had to sit next to him and force it out.
“No, I wouldn’t. So you won’t do anything like this again, will you?”
Sherlock seemed to realise his mouth was hanging open, and shut it with a click. It took John a second to realise what could be troubling him, but when he did, he couldn’t help the warm smile that spread across his face and wrinkled the skin of his eyes.
John glances up at him. “The what?”
. You avoided windows, you got drunk. You flirted around.”
Sherlock makes a frustrated sound. “Damn you. If it were you in my place—”
He has no idea what he’s doing, but he’s not going to stop it. His mind blanks as he leans over, bringing himself close enough that he can feel Sherlock’s breath quickening against his lips. Sherlock’s eyes fly open, pained and pleading, locking to his as if terrified he would never set eyes on him again. John brings his hands to cradle Sherlock’s head between them.
, John.”
Sherlock glanced up from where he was sat cross-legged by the coffee table, wrapped in his navy blue dressing gown and surrounded by a scattering of junkmail booklets and magazines. A pair of scissors stilled in his hand, threaded halfway through a glossy page with a printed headline that read, if John squinted hard enough, ‘
Sherlock nods, peering down at his bare feet. Some of the tension ebbs from the air between them. When he looks back up his expression is soft, almost vulnerable. A single drop of liquid falls from his hair and tracks down his cheek. “Exposure therapy,” he says. “I found it in one of your medical books. It’s supposed to be shocking at first, but I didn’t imagine you would be quite so affected. If I had known…”
Sherlock went still at that. John’s erection throbbed between them, as obvious as the nose on his face.
“Sherlock?”
Before they knew it, they’d spent two whole hours bent over the coffee table, cutting shapes and gluing things and arguing lightheartedly over tiny details. By the end of it, their fingers were sticky and covered in sparkles. A silver foil star had somehow found its way onto Sherlock’s forehead, and John burst into giggles when he spotted it.
That most decidedly was
John struggles with his phone in futility, muttering an array of colourful curses under his breath. Sherlock ignores it, secretly pleased with himself. There’ll probably be no need for Mycroft’s little toy, but one can never be too careful. He fishes a partially-squashed packet of airline peanuts from his pocket. He pops it open, flinching at the burst of salt that invades the air. John generally responds positively to the sight of him eating. Crunching a peanut between his teeth, he keeps a surreptitious eye out for John’s reaction. It soon does the trick; when John finally looks up from his screen and notices him, the lines of frustration around his eyes smooth out.
, and statistically I’ll win more rounds sitting here than relying on random chance of being picked as the kisser for someone else.” He drummed his fingers on his knees impatiently. "Are you going to spin it, or shall we just declare me the winner by default?"
John glanced around warily. “You think so?” to which Sherlock nodded in response. “You’re right, then; time to leave.”
He had woken that morning fully convinced of his decision to leave. With his feelings in turmoil, there was no way he could live here any longer. It had seemed that, not only did Sherlock not want to be anything other than his friend, but even if he did, John saw no way they could be together in the way both of them would have wanted.
Mindy pauses, pulling a pack of cigarettes from her pocket. She exits through a bulkhead door. John cringes, knowing that the poor girl has just cornered herself. Mikhail pauses outside the same door, turning to glance back down the hall, and John’s training kicks in just in time for him to duck out of sight, heart thumping wildly in his chest.
“Please. Give me something…”
“Is it?”
. That was—”
He hauls himself over the metal rail.
Because that’s what it was, wasn’t it? Displeasure? Sherlock found himself adrift in confusion, because the clues he was picking up painted the absurd picture of a man appalled, possibly even disgusted, by his friend’s inability to reciprocate in an act that had been entirely unintentional to begin with.
He re-emerges again and hears John pleading above him. “Get me out,” he cries. “Fuck, get me out!”
who needed saving. But for you? I’d do much more than that,” he replies. “I’d live.”
Sherlock sweeps past him with an armful of toiletries. The door to his bedroom flies open and he dumps the pile unceremoniously onto the bed. “You know why,” he replies.
“John, may I make a deduction?” Sherlock asked. It seemed only a few short seconds had passed, but during that time John’s intensity had withered, as if the very foundations of their friendship were crumbling beneath them.
John chuckles, embarrassed, but warmed by the unexpected compliment. He can’t be certain if he’s ever heard Sherlock call him ‘good looking’ before. He lets it roll around in his mind and decides that he doesn’t feel weird about it. Quite the contrary; he likes it. Judging by the heat in his cheeks, it probably even made him blush.
Sherlock’s already on the move, then. He should have expected as much.
The first day on-board the Aurora proves daunting. This ship is more than just a big boat— it’s an entire floating city. The densely-packed decks thrum with activity and noise, music and sweat, packed as it is with bronzed holiday-goers and the harried staff who attend to them. Only now does Sherlock truly appreciate the enormity of the task he’s set himself. Nevertheless, he goes about it in his usual style: Systematically. There is no other way to tackle a task so huge.
Either way, Sherlock got off lucky. He’d come this close to throwing a punch. Only the look on Sherlock’s face stayed his hand at the last second, a suggestion that he did, in fact, recognise something of the pain he’d inflicted. Good. Let him stew on it for a while. Maybe he’ll think twice next time he tries something so outrageously stupid.
Sherlock couldn’t help the huff of laughter, feeling the sting of his own tears threatening to well up. “No. Look again, John. Be specific. What do you
“I’ll play,” Sherlock said evenly, not taking his eyes off his glass. Everyone looked at him in shock. The sudden attention startled him enough to look up. “What? These so-called ‘guessing games’ are simple tests of deductive reasoning. I’m clearly going to win every round. Of course I’ll play.”
“So do you.”
“Alright, I’ll play then,” John said, “but no Frenching.”
“Don’t stop! What are you doing?!”
His eyes drifted shut hours ago and feel lightly stuck that way now, crusted with seawater and sore from sleeplessness. It’s nearing morning when he first notices something amiss; he calls, and for the first time, Sherlock doesn’t answer.
“If you have so little faith in me, why am I even here? Why did you insist I even—”
He’d wanted to win the game, of course. But that was a secondary goal. Much more importantly, he’d seen an opportunity to experience a side of John that he’d always been curious, even yearning to explore for years. That side of him he’d caught a brief glimpse of whenever John brought home a new girlfriend. That softness, that shared warmth between John and his flavour of the week… Witnessing that had a similar effect on him as whenever John watched him play the violin, except it was a little sharper somehow, even painful sometimes, and these feelings came from a part of himself that he didn’t quite understand.
Back in Sherlock’s hotel room, the detective pulled him in for a slow, loving kiss. Their arms wrapped around each other and Sherlock was pressed against the wall, the long length of his slim yet muscular body against John’s own. Their tongues moved together, tasting, playfighting. When John realised his hands were wandering across Sherlock’s body he broke the kiss and moved to pull away, but Sherlock held him close, his eyes brimming with concern.
thing he’d wanted to hear.
The ride continues in silence for long minutes as the road snakes down towards the coast. The next time John looks over to check on him, Sherlock is wearing a self-satisfied smirk on his face. It sends a fresh wave of cold sweat trickling down his neck. "What are you so giddy about?" he asks. Sherlock doesn't respond, save to adjust his position to something more dignified. John's stomach twists with dread. He only gets that look when he's planning something, and that usually equals trouble. Being trapped on a ship for seven days is a bad enough prospect by itself, but with Sherlock having figured out exactly why it bothers him so much, he has to resist a strong urge to fling open the cab door and go running for the hills.
John quickly retreated back to his chair. The group watched Sherlock, who gaped for a few seconds, seemingly thrown for a loop.
“Sherlock?” he whispers, loathe to disturb his rest, but thinking this probably won’t be the most comfortable way to spend the night for either of them. Sherlock hums in response. “We should get you to bed, hmm?”
“That’s barmy.” The kettle clicks off. John goes through the motions, squishing the teabags around in the water a little more forcefully than necessary. “So they’ll happily let a known kidnapper carry on operating in their country, rather than risk bringing the wrong bloke in? What sense does that make?”
Mycroft looks at him, puzzled. “You would give up one of your own organs?”
So he had imagined an asexual’s experience of sex to be like a permanent state of the latter. Sherlock had shocked him by not only being open to the idea of pleasing him in that way, but having undeniable enthusiasm for it.
“How are your hands?”
John huffed in annoyance.
Sherlock makes a pleased sound in his throat and straightens up. He enters the kitchen, a dog-eared passport twirling between his fingers. “Who knows what goes on in the minds of most police detectives, John. Very little, I imagine. That's why we do this.”
It takes a moment for the words to register.
But John won’t accept that. He didn’t give up then, and he isn’t going to give up now. He’ll wait the rest of his life if he has to, just as long as Sherlock comes back to him.
A damn swimming pool. What little hope that Sherlock was bluffing dies in the pit of his stomach.
As the night wore on, Sherlock stole an opportunity during a quiet moment to serenade the group with his violin. He played, swaying back and forth in front of the lit hearth, its warm orange glow illuminating his elegant frame like an aura and dancing along the edge of his bowstring. It was moments like this, John thought, wherein his brilliant flatmate seemed almost ethereally beautiful, something quite otherworldly. It was so different from his usual persona, that piercing scrutiny of his eyes and the hard, mechanical instrumentality of his mind; when he played, he seemed to melt into the vibration of the notes, became one with sound— a being of pure reason transformed, as if by magic, into the very avatar of Music.
Sherlock pinned him with a mildly pained look. “What do you mean?”
“Hmm,” John hummed. “Like anal,” he offered, without really thinking about it. Sherlock, bless him, looked mildly alarmed at the idea.
He made a move to haul himself upright, but Sherlock stopped him with a finger to John’s lips. “Stay there. I’ll grab something.”
John is stunned by the revelation. “That’s what all this was for? Whatever happened to ‘I can’t abide loose ends’, Sherlock? You said—”
All the while, Sherlock’s sharp eyes fixated on him, wide-eyed and enthralled by the powerful reaction he’d wrought out of the body beneath him. His fist, still wrapped around John’s relaxing member, massaged him through the remnant aftershocks. After what felt like an eternity, John went boneless beneath him.
“Your face will get stuck that way,” Sherlock comments.
“I know you do, but… I mean, for instance, you don’t want to see me naked… do you?”
John moves in swiftly to support him.
“I didn’t—”
they’re underestimating. I’d say their estimation of me is pretty on-point.”
“Glad you’re in such a giddy mood,” Sherlock’s voice came out rough from the exertion, his breath hitching between the words. “You could help, you know.”
Sherlock had known this, and everything else about him instantly. Because of course he did— he’s Sherlock Holmes. And he’d accepted it, recognising it as something John simply couldn’t help about himself. It wasn’t a perversion; something more along the lines of a nervous habit, or a tic. John explained to him that while the company of family, friends, or even just people that knew him (but didn’t necessarily know of his unusual proclivity) was a horribly tempting environment, bordering on mental torture, there was also a singular thrill for him in the company of strangers, too.
The annual 221B Christmas party began ordinarily enough. Despite its tiny size, the flat had somehow fallen into the tradition of hosting the evening do for Sherlock and John and their close group of friends. It was never a loud or rambunctious affair; just a small gathering, with drinks and food and music in pleasant company. And it truly was. Pleasant, that is, not that Sherlock would ever openly admit that. But it followed, logically, that whomsoever was patient enough to stick around and not be driven away by his acerbic personality was either destined to end up being a cherished friend, or a mortal enemy to the mercurial Sherlock Holmes.
“It’ll be fine. It’s your fault we’re playing this, and we’re not using one of mine,” John pointed out, sinking back into his armchair. Sherlock pouted into his drink, muttering to himself. He
“Anticipation. Excitement.”
.” He scrunches his nose in disgust.
Not stupid, then; he actually thought John was cleverer than that. Interesting. There seemed to be more value to this game than he’d first thought. He was starting to properly enjoy this. What else could he learn about his friends tonight?
"I… Are you…?"
His eyebrows climb up his forehead. “But… Are you not afraid to, after…”
“John. Stop.” John turned to look at him, and that was a mistake. Sherlock’s uncharacteristically open expression told John everything he didn’t want to know about the conversation they were about to have.
But before he even had a chance to get closer, Sherlock confidently answered: “Anderson.”
Their lips met then, cutting off his words. Sherlock’s soft, gentle lips against his own. It was the lightest of touches, almost familial in its innocence. But it was so abrupt, so unexpected. John’s mind shut down like a city grid losing power. Sherlock was kissing him… on the
What exactly he was getting from the experience, John didn’t know. The comfort of another body, perhaps. Feeling safe to be this open with someone, to touch him and explore him in ways that would otherwise be forbidden. Feeding the hunger of Sherlock’s mind, rather than his body.
“Right. Just… It would be a lot easier than”—his hand fluttered at the mess surrounding them—“all this.”
. A traumatic injury, something laden with guilt. A friend had died, perhaps while John was still working to staunch the flow of blood, to keep him conscious just a few minutes more until help could arrive.
It was hard to pin down the reason John accepted him so readily, but it was nothing like the kind of selfishness others so frequently used him for. John had nothing he would consider ‘valuable’ to gain by staying by Sherlock’s side— on the contrary, sometimes merely the fact of their acquaintance put John in considerable danger.
He keened into Sherlock, who cupped John’s cheek with his hand as John’s face drew tight in pleasure. He whimpered and moaned helplessly into Sherlock’s mouth as he came. Sherlock captured his tongue between his wetted lips and sucked on it, further encouraging the shudders of orgasm crashing like waves through John’s body. John felt his cum pooling against his fist in the bottom of the cardboard box, which Sherlock was helpfully keeping held in place lest it suddenly get knocked away in front of an entire stadium of watchers.
“What’s wrong?”
“Hm, by threatening to pre-invite me to the next five family get-togethers. It was effective, I grant you.”
“John. Look at me.” He looked, but it felt almost painful to maintain eye contact. This was horrible. To be this close, but have to deny the one thing he wanted most in the world. And the worst of it was, it was neither of their fault; this was just who they were. So right for each other, and yet…
“Because if they got picked again, I’d know who it was. It’s an unfair advantage, ruins the fun.”
“I know.” He puffs his cheeks, dropping his chin to rest on the metal rail. “Sorry. A splitting headache is no excuse for snapping.”
Eventually he got up, mumbled something about a shower, and left Sherlock alone in the room. The bathroom door closed a moment later, and Sherlock heard the creak of the pipes as the water was run.
Being a doctor — and a bisexual, to boot — John had seen his fair share of cock and balls. As such things went, he found Sherlock’s to be on the prettier side. The member seemed average in length, though it was impossible to tell for sure unless he was to somehow get an erection. It was slightly darker than the rest of his complexion, but not visually striking.
Sherlock looked thoughtful for a minute. “I suppose,” he began slowly, “Anything is fine, but I wouldn’t suggest attempting to stimulate my penis. I’m not
Sherlock hums in agreement.
“Petrov, yes. And he’s a trafficker, John. Not a
“Will you be staying again?” Mycroft asks. John nods. “Very well. Anthea will be along with a fresh set of clothes for you in a few hours. I must return to work, but I would appreciate a call as soon as anything changes.”
Sherlock’s eyes open, focusing slowly, and whatever expression they contain is unreadable. They look so drained in this light. The sky is brightening, warming the salt breeze in the air, and his eyes look almost grey. The shimmering greens and bright flecks of gold that John has always found fascinating now appear dull and lifeless, like a pair of unpolished gems dirtied by the ravages of the sea. But despite this, something in their depths glows with a warmth he can’t look away from.
“Wonderful.” Their cases come into view, and John tugs them off the conveyor.
“A card?” John narrowed his eyes in puzzlement. “You’re actually… making a birthday card. From scratch.”
Sherlock’s eyes softened, his mouth quirked into a patient smile. “It’s alright, I promise. Get it out of your system.”
He can’t believe Sherlock would do that— just let him swim on, completely oblivious. Couldn’t he put himself in John’s shoes for one second and realise what his life would have been like, if he’d made it back to shore only to discover he’d left his best friend behind? At the same time, John should have expected it. Sherlock is nothing if not ruthlessly logical in his reasoning. He’d worked out that John had the best chance of survival without him, but he didn’t stop to consider whether surviving under those conditions would even be worth it to John.
Sherlock briefly wishes he had the power of telepathy, because his reply would be something along the lines of, “Yes, actually. We’re supposed to be hunting for a very
John slides his cock out with a wet slurp, then repeats the process, wanking the base with his fist in a redoubled effort. He's a little worried that he doesn't know when Sherlock is going to tip over the edge, but he finds he's caring less and less about ending up with a mouth full of semen considering the copious amounts of pre-cum he's currently happily drinking. Sherlock's body is reacting beautifully now. His muscles continually tense and relax, twitching, quivering, and he's making noises John has never heard come out of that mouth before. Utterly unconscious, unmoderated moans, driven only by the forceful push of air as his body contracts whenever John's suction around his cock intensifies.
John grabs the bag and tosses it towards him. “I’m going back to my room. Have fun up here by yourself.”
‘Seriously?’ Greg mouthed, and several eyebrows raised quizzically. Sherlock confidently stood, straightened his clothes, combed his fingers through his dark curls and strode briskly over to where John sat, blindfolded and patiently waiting. Then he leaned over, bringing his face very close to John's.
And yet, he couldn’t push it out of his mind: The memory of how it felt to be so close to him, being brought over the edge by him, with his scent in his nose and his body pressed close. He couldn’t delete things like Sherlock could. It would be with him for the rest of his life.
“I know what it says, I put it there. I told them the water was contaminated with Cryptosporidium.”
would like a chat about that, too.”
“Want to get off the ship for a while?” he offers. “It leaves at 6:00 AM. You could probably get some sleep then. I have a feeling our trafficker is working the night hours, but I’ll have to clear the morning crew tomorrow to be sure.”
“I’m not wrong, John. You weren’t coping. Maybe you couldn’t see it, but
Slowly, John grips the handle and inches the door open, wincing at the squeal of its rusted hinges.
“What? Why?”
It was weird; they were just friends. John had never done this in front of him— not deliberately, anyway. Not with his permission. And certainly not pressed right up against him like this. But he had to admit, there was an appeal to it. Sherlock was urging him on, but they weren’t lovers, they weren’t intimate— and yet John would he wanking himself off right in front of him. And if Sherlock was okay with that, how could be refuse?
And he’d bet money that she knows exactly what effect it was having on him. He can see it in her eyes; the way she watches him, it’s too calculating. Her words too precise. This is a practised art, and she’s a grandmaster at seduction. But for as good as the performance it is, he can tell that it’s well rehearsed. She probably does this sort of thing on every contract she takes: Picks one sad, lonely, sexually frustrated guy, lures him in with the promise of a night to remember. Takes what she wants from him — most likely his wallet — while he’s too blissed out to care.
“What, this?” John holds them up in display. “That’s what you’ve been dying to know first?”
A dry laugh squeezes from his chest. “That’s rich, coming from you.”
“We’ve got some free time.”
He barely had the presence of mind to climb off of Sherlock and collapse next to him on the bed, rather than on top of him and the rapidly cooling puddle of cum on his chest. He buried his face in the pillow as he fought to steady his breath, and was nearly dozing when Sherlock’s voice interrupted the quiet air.
He hadn’t actually met anybody asexual before. He knew of it, of course, but textbook definitions were far from an adequate primer when faced with all the complexities and nuance of a real life example.
His chest constricts with guilt and fear. He has never seen John lose control of himself like this. He seems intent on drowning them both, overtaken by his body's drowning response. He might just succeed if Sherlock doesn't snap him out of it soon. Adrenaline surging through his veins, he manages to encircle John and lock his arms safely to his sides, keeping John from grabbing at him again but forcing his legs to do all of the work. Summoning his strength, Sherlock manages to bring them above the surface. Their gasps fill the air.
It suited him. It was an odd thought, but John could imagine him walking around the house like this, completely naked, and he would look as prim and as elegant as he did in any of his tailored suits.
here!”
“Penny for your thoughts,” Sherlock nudged him playfully. “I can hear your mind turning.”
Molly smiled sheepishly. “How’d you know?”
Holding the box close to him, John glanced around to check if anyone could see, before unzipping his jeans and carefully pulling out his penis. The box provided a shield on all sides, but the removed panel in the back allowed room for his hand to accompany it inside. He kept the lid closed, just in case people in the rows behind them could see over his shoulder.
He’d hoped not to resort to this, but proactive measures are called for. “John, hand me your phone.”
Glances were exchanged around the group. Yes, that did seem like a problem. Not that any of them were particularly uncomfortable with the idea, but what would be the fun of it without any girls playing?
Tentatively, John begins kicking. Too quickly at first, but then his pace settles with more confidence. His weight lightens, and soon his arms begin to relax, instincts no longer teetering on the knife-edge of survival. Sherlock’s hands stay clutched tight around his middle, even as it quickly becomes obvious that John should probably be the one supporting
John finds he's enjoying this far more than he has any right to, and he’s quickly losing his inhibitions. Wetting his lips, he takes the cock head into his mouth, giving it a firm suck. Another twitch, a sound like an elongated
Their blood-curdling cries force him out and into the line of fire. He can’t leave his friends behind.
“—Risky as hell. And yes, fantastic.”
His ears buzz. The air crackles with electricity. He smells burning ozone.
“Scared?” John asks.
It catches him off-guard. Denial hovers at his lips, but John is once again being too observant at the worst possible time. “It’s superficial,” he says, attempting to wave it away with a half-truth. “Mikhail caught me with the knife. Just stings a bit, that’s all.”
“Don’t,” he hisses. He pins Sherlock with a glare so fiery it could melt the sun itself. Gone is the admiration, the warmth, the unquestioning trust in John’s eyes; only a red mist of anger and betrayal remain. He may actually throw a punch. If he does, Sherlock knows he deserves it. John's tortured expression cuts itself deep into him, etching itself into his memory and promising to refuse deletion later on. If he should even try. Sherlock bites his lip, overcome by regret, and braces himself.
. What has he got himself into?
Sherlock lifted one laconic shoulder and dropped into his leather chair by the hearth. It seemed the only way he would be able to tease out John’s secrets would be by revealing some of his own. It was a fair trade, he supposed, for such an intimate topic. If John felt backed into a corner, exposed and vulnerable, he was that much less likely to share his thoughts.
For a dangerous moment, Sherlock didn’t let up. John was right on the edge when he finally withdrew, slipping off the spit-soaked head with an obscene smack. His face was flushed and he was breathing hard, but his eyes were pools of black delight when he smirked up at John, wiping errant dribbles of saliva from his chin with the back of his hand. The debauched sight of him alone almost had John coming there and then.
." Doesn't exactly scream
“Wait!” He whispered, grabbing his arm. “I need that— Sherlock! There’s
further up in his schedule, but first he needs to become attuned to the ebb and flow of this new environment. Then, like the silvery dart of fish scale that ripples the surface of a calm pond, any disturbance in the natural rhythm will be all the easier to pick out.
He doesn’t miss the innuendo in her tone. Christ, even complete strangers think they’re an item. “He’s a good friend,” he says, keen to dispel the notion. “We work well together.”
“You alright?” John asked against Sherlock’s head, tasting for a moment the thick curls brushing the corner of his mouth. He winced at how the combined weight of himself and Sherlock lying over him was crushing his hands against the upholstery. “Felt you knock your head a bit on the way in. Does it hurt?”
Morphine. His oldest friend.
That should satisfy him. An easy compromise, and sleep can wait a little longer. John leaves the phone on the bed and hauls himself to his feet.
His mind has grown lethargic and sluggish, and the lack of a response doesn’t immediately concern him. He’s grown used to the silence. The sky, empty and cloudless, is a dead audience to the sea’s waves as they quietly bob up and down, carrying him along like a piece of flotsam. And he hasn’t seen, or heard, a single screaming gull, nor the distant engines of any passing ships.
“Are you in pain?” he asks, testing Sherlock’s pupil response with a penlight. “I can call someone to unlock the settings if it’s not enough.”
“So the problem is me, then.” Checkmate. Sherlock turns away, nodding decisively to himself. “I worried as much. I should have noticed sooner. Your tolerance of me is notably higher than most, but I suppose everybody has their limits.”
Ever the mind-reader, Sherlock’s arms circled his neck and urged him to lie down, carrying Sherlock onto the bed and down on top of him. John’s heart skipped when their members brushed together briefly, before Sherlock shifted himself to a more comfortable position and laid himself flat.
Well. Maybe he had miscalculated that, a bit.
Out of the corner of his eye, John spotted someone turning towards the front of the room where John stood jerking himself. His stomach flipped in horror, his balls drew up tight and he barely held back a cry as he came suddenly into his fist, his free hand clenching tightly onto the material of his jeans as he striped the polished marble floor with ropes of warm cum. In an instant Sherlock was by his side, holding the coat to him protectively, and through watery eyes John saw that he’d blocked the visitor’s line of sight with expert timing.
Now he was panicking that they could never go back to how things were. That he could never look at Sherlock again and not think about what happened. Sherlock could see it clouding his expression, even now. He had to make him see that it didn’t matter.
John's face pales. “You… contaminated the pool? On purpose?”
“No, you're wrong,” John says, raising a finger. “Whatever you think you’ve figured out, you’re wrong. I just prefer a hotel to a ship, that’s all. End of story.”
In the face of John preparing to remove himself from Sherlock’s life for good, Sherlock could find no other desire in his heart than to keep him here. Not to be his blogger, and not so that Sherlock would have a companion to accompany him on cases, but because Sherlock
“Bye Johnny! Sorry we couldn’t get better acquainted. But to be honest, you were never really my type.”
He delivered the last bit with a knowing glance at John, who hid his grin behind a scratching of his nose. His other hand was already preoccupied at the front of his jeans. His cock was out, albeit hidden under the coat, and he was stroking himself covertly.
John snorts. “Feels like we’re the entire bloody force, at times. I’m starting to understand why you never sit down for more than five minutes. Nothing would get done, otherwise.”
Sherlock opens his mouth to argue, but he’s right— this is distracting him more than he’d like to admit, and the look of disappointment in John’s glare is so sharp that it forces him to avert his eyes. Guilt solidifies beneath his ribs like a stone, weighing his heart down into his stomach. At home, John tolerates his fluctuating moods up to a point; there’s no controlling it when the cases are scarce and ennui begins to set in. But on a case, John has always held him to a higher standard.
John was sure he meant it, too, so he wrapped his arms loosely around Sherlock’s thin waist, careful not to tickle him there, and pressed his mouth to the firm margin of his sternum. Sherlock’s fist worked in a slow rhythm, testing him with varying pressure, unsure and inexperienced. But it didn’t take him long at all to learn where and how John liked it most.
now — was okay with this. An affectionate smile reassured him, and he couldn’t resist grinding against him slowly, the friction causing him to gasp again against Sherlock’s lips.
“Listen, Mindy. It’s been lovely getting to know you, but I—”
“I hadn’t forgotten that night at Angelo’s,” he continued. “The questions you asked, the… interest you showed. You wanted more. You still do. But last night appeared to you as an explicit confirmation that I did not reciprocate your desire for a closer relationship.
, damn it. He’d long since tamped down any hopes of anything like that happening for real. Sherlock was… He just wasn’t like that. And John had come to accept it, reluctantly, because there had been a hope, once. Back when he’d first moved in. Sherlock had seemed to be deliberately serenading him with his violin, and John would listen, enraptured, as if Sherlock was sending ghostly strings of himself into the air, and it was all John could do to absorb them into his very soul. They felt connected. Or at least,
His eyes say what both of them are thinking: Sherlock hasn’t exactly earned trustworthy status recently. Nevertheless, John tilts his chin up and mutters something that sounds like a prayer. Then the weight of him lifts away from his shoulders entirely. For the first few seconds, John’s limbs swish wildly back and forth, frothing the water around him, but soon he finds a gentler rhythm, the movement tightening into something smooth and controlled. The deep lines of worry above his nose loosen incrementally, reflexive fear giving way to a quiet awe, and even joy at his new accomplishment.
Sherlock turns to him. “I know this case has been difficult. We're both ready to be done with it. I don't say it often enough, but your assistance has been essential, and more than that, I enjoy your company.”
If there’s any sarcasm or manipulation in the words, it’s invisible. John wants to believe it. But Sherlock is a master manipulator, and he’s seen this act before. This wouldn’t be the first time he trotted out a perfect facsimile of sentiment in order to sway someone to his side. The question is, how much does he trust him at his word? After what he pulled earlier— not as much as he might do.
. And now this was it: This was the last time he would experience the two of them sharing each other’s body heat, and not once had it ever been under more pleasant circumstances. Was it possible to mourn the loss of something he’d never had? Because he was pretty sure this is how it feels.
“Here we are,” he affirms, his voice thin and falling silent as the weight of it sinks in. John spends long minutes carding his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, idly wondering if the nurses would let him wash it one of these days.
So he simply watched.
Down the hall, the automatic doors glide open with a soft noise. It sets his nerves on edge.
. There was no point in pining after the unattainable.
.’ Not to mention probably giving Mrs H a heart attack. Look,” he lifted a finger before Sherlock could protest, “I’ll pop down the shops in a bit and pick up some supplies. Then we can both sit down and make a proper card, with— I don’t know, glitter or something. Alright?”
But on that first night at Angelo’s, there had been something more. Praise of a different kind; a deeper, fuller appreciation, something all-encompassing. Something hungry, carnal, possessive. It was a look of sheer
John wasn’t exactly sure how to answer this tactfully. After a moment, he sighed, removing himself from Sherlock’s arms. “I don’t… I don’t know how to deal with this,” he said, waving his arm between them. “You are so bloody fit, you have no idea, and kissing you is making me
“Oi, give me a little credit,” John says, nudging his shoulder. “I was making a few friends, that’s all. Couldn’t say no to a few drinks. Chatted up some of the stewardesses while I was at it.”
“Ah… Right. Yeah, I will.”
“Let me call for help,” he pleads, his voice straining to stay level. “He can’t swim. He’ll drown if you don’t let me get help!”
“I’m afraid I must leave you now, but please— feel free to enjoy the gallery while you’re here.”
Sherlock releases him with a shaky sigh. “I’m not very good at this.”
It slips out before his brain has a chance to parse the subtext, but Sherlock’s wide-eyed, deer-in-headlights reaction makes it utterly worthwhile. He has to laugh. That makes
, and a dollop of precum spills into his mouth. Well, that certainly seems to work well. He cringes, but swallows the liquid. It doesn’t taste all that bad; just very warm, and a bit too salty. Sherlock really should drink more often. He gives the head another long, hard suck, and an unbidden moan is wrenched from Sherlock's lungs sheerly through the force of muscular contraction.
He waved it away. “Don’t worry. I’ve never actually tried it, and not sure I see the appeal in doing so. Seems a bit… destructive, physiologically speaking. It’s enough of a worry knowing most of us end up incontinent in our old age. Seems a lot of people are in a hurry to get there far sooner.”
He’s taken aback by the stark humility. “Sherlock…”
“That’s not true,” he said, biting his lip. “You know what I’m like. For me, sex and romance are two sides of the same coin. I can’t have one without the other.” John looked down at their joined hands, and Sherlock felt something wet splash against his skin. “I can’t,” he choked, shaking his head. “I can’t ask you to be something you’re not. It wouldn’t be fair on you, and I’d hate myself for it in the end.”
His knees were growing weak. Sherlock seemed to sense he was drawing close and withdrew his hand from John’s pants. Ignoring John’s whine of protest, Sherlock took his wrists and pulled him away from the wall. “Come over here. Sit,” he said, turning them both around and pushing John down onto the edge of the bed. “And take off your clothes,” he added, before sliding his crumpled shirt off the rest of the way.
you are. You’re not going anywhere, Sherlock Holmes.” She tips her head to the side, pushing her bottom lip out in an exaggerated display. “Sorry about your beau. You regret not fucking him when you had the chance? Too late now.”
The threat of impending boredom seems to do the trick. “Let me see them, then.”
“And now we just do this for a day or two.”
“That wasn’t a proposal,” he assures. “Not yet, at least. We should probably at least go on a date first.”
Leaning forward, Sherlock shot a smoldering look at John, who saw in his eyes the same kind of intense energy that he’d often witnessed during a particularly stimulating case. He recognised that look. Apparently, the game was now
Mycroft’s grim reflection appears beside him in the window. “You are not the only one concerned for him.”
“It’s Mrs Hudson’s birthday tomorrow,” Sherlock mumbled, focus dropping back to his enigmatic task. He carefully adjusted his grip on the page and closed the scissor blades with a gentle, pleasing
. That’s well within acceptable health standards. Human beings can survive up to two weeks without serious long-term side-effects; that’s a fact pulled straight from one of your own medical textbooks, by the way. Honestly, your proclivity towards time-wasting activities like sleep borders on unabashed gluttony.”
“But the case…”
“Understatement of the century,” John said, chucking the towel unceremoniously across the room. “Thank you. That was amazing.” He leaned over and planted a soft kiss on Sherlock’s lips, lingering there to look into his eyes, and seeing that they looked every bit as lax and satisfied as someone who had just come with him. He idly wondered if emotional orgasms were a thing; if so, he's quite certain Sherlock had just experienced one.
Sherlock showed John the tickets Mrs Patterson had slipped him earlier in the art gallery. They were seats to the annual Super Bowl game on Sunday. Neither of them were particularly into sports, let alone one so Americano-centric, but they had some time to kill before heading back to London and figured it was better than any other plans they’d had for the evening, and so they decided to go see what all the fuss was about.
Of Mycroft in women’s lingerie.
Unimpressed, Sherlock prods at his shoulder with a bony finger. “John. You’re blocking the way.”
He’s had a lot of time to think these past few days. About himself. About Sherlock. About all manner of little things he’d apparently missed before, all the little signs and signals that passed him by unnoticed, either because he was blind to them or he just didn’t want to acknowledge their existence. As he stood day and night like a guardian by Sherlock’s bedside, it occurred to him there was still so much he needed to say. Things he could say now, if only he could put into words this thing that is so desperately unspoken between them. Perhaps it’s worth a try now, but the prospect of opening that Pandora’s box is still daunting, and the last thing he wants to do is put any extra unnecessary stress on Sherlock while he’s recovering.
.” He looked into John’s eyes. “John, you won. Does that mean… we have to stop kissing now?”
“Yeah, why is that?”
he thought, turning the word over in his mind appraisingly. Yes, that sounded accurate.
“I’m sorry, mate.”
John’s heart was still pounding in his chest when Sherlock pulled at the ropes again. John could feel the difference in the tension, but it still amazed him when Sherlock’s right arm slipped up and out of the coils, followed by his left. Then, having created enough extra slack in the rope by freeing his limbs, Sherlock slid his torso down through the coils around their chests. Honestly, the man was like a god damned contortionist.
If looks could kill, John would have to avert his eyes. “Mycroft, ever heard of knocking before you enter a room?”
John fishes the room key from his shorts. Fumbling to unlock the fancy sensor-based lock, John musters a few embarrassing words of thanks. “Yeah, I’ll be fine. Thank you. For the help, that was very… I appreciate it. Thanks.”
"But no, too risky. It’s possible I might be able to detect whether someone is being coerced to leave the ship against their will, but I’d rather not let him get that far. He could also be sedating them and having them offloaded as cargo.”
His chest aches.
Was there any truth in those observations? It was merely intuition, but Sherlock found himself at a loss, bereft of further data to expand upon any theory that presented itself. His friend, always such an open book to him, had suddenly closed himself off, as if Sherlock’s gaze could accidentally spark at some brittle part of him and set his entire, fragile inner world ablaze.
Before he could finish voicing the flawed sentiment, Sherlock stole another kiss from him, cutting off the words. This time he parted his lips and ran the tip of his tongue pleadingly against the pliant seal of John’s mouth, and John surrendered for him almost immediately.
. This none of your business.”
Sherlock’s dark head hovers above him, heavy with thought like a storm cloud ready to burst, and John steels himself for an onslaught of cutting truths. But the downpour doesn’t arrive. Sherlock is oddly quiet as he finishes gathering the debris and tips it into the bin, all too conscious of his being watched far too closely.
It’s been one of those days. They’ve just finished up a month-long case for the Met, concluding in a heart-stopping showdown inside a circus tent when Sherlock had chased the killer (a homicidal clown) up onto a tightrope and wrestled him into submission, all without losing his balance. He'd then addressed the shocked audience and stated not to worry, the vast majority of clowns
A subject like this one required an even playing field.
— if you don’t stop, I’m—”
had not been among the list of possibilities.
Sherlock was deep-throating him.
As he stood over Sherlock, watching him sit perfectly poised and still, John focused himself back on the game. He artfully contemplated his next move. He knew all too well Sherlock’s ability to deduce someone’s presence without even seeing them. But no matter how certain Sherlock was of the man standing in front of him now, John was equally sure he could trick him into reaching an entirely different conclusion. It was time to test his skills.
He glances over at John, a smirk hovering at his lips. “Don’t be silly.”
John settled on the couch and scrubbed his hands over his eyes, looking for all the world like he wanted the furniture to swallow him up. “Yeah. Of course, that makes sense.”
John sat in a dazed, happy state. Having given him a few minutes to recover, Sherlock cleared his throat. “I think we should call it a day, don’t you?”
Once it began, he couldn’t stop it. The air was forced out of his lungs as he came, groaning helplessly into Sherlock’s shirt collar. His hips jerked up, hard, meeting the solid resistance of Sherlock’s thigh as his whole body tried to curl against Sherlock’s pinning weight. His fists clenched tight behind his back and his toes curled in the confines of their shoes. A litany of ‘pleases’ and ‘Sherlocks’ spilled from his lips as his cock pulsed between them, thick and hot.
He twists to watch the Aurora shrinking into the horizon, already so distant that its engines can no longer be heard. It continues to sail straight and true on its preordained route, oblivious to the loss of two of its human cargo.
was wrong with him?!
him: Mind, body and soul.
Surely he’s kidding. John twists to look over his shoulder. “You’re serious. You're still going.”
Across an ocean of glass-top tables, John stands chatting with one of the female wait staff. He’s positioned about as far from any sea-view windows as one could manage; a strategy that seems to be serving him well. He looks relaxed, his hands stuffed casually in the pockets of his shorts, much improved from the state Sherlock last saw him in. Then again, maybe his mind is on other things. The buxom young woman he’s caught the attention of is so obviously flirting with him, it makes Sherlock cringe.
“Turn your head.”
and his pulse races, fear and adrenaline surging through his veins.
It was true, too, that Sherlock enjoyed these moments almost as much as he did. Not in a sexual way — as Sherlock had never had that kind of feeling — but he seemed to genuinely enjoy finding ways to keep John happy and entertained, and he didn’t believe in trying to repress or pretend that people weren’t simply
With steady effort, Sherlock guides him to the tenth deck suites. John pours all his focus into the simple act of putting one foot in front of the other. If they’re getting strange looks from the other passengers, both of them pretend not to notice. When they eventually arrive at their rooms, Sherlock extracts himself from his living manacle and leaves him propped up next to the door.
“Someday,” he compromises, and Sherlock nods his understanding.
A hand catches his wrist mid-sweep and they both see the tremor in his limb. John pulls away. “I’m fine, honest.”
“Here,” Sherlock pointed at his chest, and fixed his sight on John’s face. “Come for me, John. Show me how good this feels to you. I want to watch you coming on me.”
“I’m not sure I can,” he admits. “I’ve felt so bloody useless these past few days. You have no idea how happy I am to see you awake. You could ask me for pretty much anything right now and I’d do it.”
Sherlock listened carefully. He could distinguish John’s footsteps, drawers being opened, and something fabric being dropped to the floor. A zipper opening. Indeterminate rustling. The zipper closed. He didn’t like these sounds; they weren’t part of John’s normal morning routine.
Sherlock managed to be an endlessly fascinating friend. He was everything John could ever ask for in a companion that would, in all likelihood, be with him for life. Before tonight, John had found he could live with that quite easily, in the end— just being near to him, caught in the orbit of his celestial gravity. Always up close. Always from afar.
With one last look, John swims on ahead, allowing Sherlock to fall into step behind him.
John’s phone vibrates in his pocket again, reminding him that Sherlock is still trying to catch up. Shit— what was the last direction he gave? A little backup would be handy right about now. He can’t drop his guard to read his phone, much less answer it.
He can’t stop thinking about all the times they’ve stood in the hallway of their flat and shared a long, burning look, breathless as they came down from the adrenaline of a case. It was almost like they were waiting for something to happen next, or for one of them to make a move and… do what, exactly? He always tried so hard not to think about it. He used to pretend it was his imagination, just his brain playing tricks — intrusive thoughts, the call of the void, whatever you’d call it — but there was a part of him that dared to believe it could be real, and he was afraid of its potential, as if that gap between them could close so effortlessly if only one of them was brave enough to take initiative.
“Don’t talk to me,” he warns, fists clenching so tight that his nails dig into the skin. He can take a lot of abuse, but this has been a step too far even for him. Sherlock doggedly follows him all the way back to his room, hovering behind him even as he fights through the soggy material of his shorts to untangle his room key. By some happy miracle, the electronic key still works. John throws the door closed behind him, imagining for a brief but satisfying second that it gave Sherlock the smack in the face he deserves.
John eyes the loosened tie around his neck; it’s unusual to see Mycroft Holmes anything less than immaculately dressed. He really must be worried. “I know,” he offers. “Sorry. I just don’t like saying it.”
“Nnnnope,” Sherlock said, side-eyeing John with a mixture of astonishment and competitive jealousy. “It was—”
As John’s other senses came back online, he realised the crowd was cheering around them. His muscles relaxed, and Sherlock pulled away slightly, roaming his eyes over John’s face. He was barely holding back a fit of giggles.
John shrugs. “Told you I would.”
So then why was
“Yep,” Sherlock replied.
The air is thick with tension. At any moment Mikhail could attack either of them. John stands defenceless, and on the wrong side of the standoff to be any help. He has to find some way of defusing this before it gets any worse. He raises a hand, palm forward. “I’ll leave. Right after she does.” He risks a glance past Mikhail. “You alright, Mindy?”
“Not once during our association have you ever declined to pursue a case to its fullest end. That alone was my first clue that something was different about this one. I must admit, I couldn’t quite figure out what the issue was at first, but once I had ruled out the impossible only the improbable remained: It seems that somehow, in all your years and despite your Army training you never learnt to swim. Such an unlikely outcome suggests you went out of your way to avoid it. Avoidance suggests fear, ergo you fear being anywhere near water.
Sherlock glances aside to assess the state of him. Rosy-cheeked, John is visibly tired. He sways a little on his feet, but shows no other signs of nausea and seems to be in conspicuously good spirits. There’s something off about it, but he can’t quite put his finger on why. John takes his silence as an answer and does what he usually does when Sherlock is being quiet: Fills the gap with idle chatter.
” he replies, and John can’t be entirely sure whether his interruption was accidental or a deliberately calculated move. Probably the latter. Either way he seems aware of having interrupted
He was right, of course, but Sherlock wasn’t about to admit that he’d severely underestimated John’s abilities. He made a mental note to watch him more carefully from now on; apparently, John was much smarter than he looked. He’d done exactly the same thing Sherlock had tried before, mimicking someone else’s technique. Maybe being around Sherlock so much was rubbing off on him?
Eager to keep John riding the crest of his orgasm, Sherlock quickly started pumping him with his fist as he clambered back up towards eye-level. His hair was wild and his skin gleamed with sweat, but John was in no better state. He was a wreck; breathless and whimpering, unable even to properly move his lips as Sherlock snaked his tongue between them, tasting of salt and John’s own heady arousal.
John uses the opportunity to stretch his legs a bit. After letting the nurses know about Sherlock’s condition, he takes a walk outside, enjoying the fresh air that isn’t laced with the clinical smells of antiseptic and lemon cleaner. He finds a bench and sits by himself, letting the breeze cool his face as he watches the cars come and go along the busy streets, a familiar ache flaring to life at the back of his mind.
Because God, he’d been an idiot, hadn’t he? How many months had it been since that night at Angelo’s? Their first case together; chasing a serial killer through the streets of London. And John, already so infatuated by Sherlock’s strange charms, unable to contain himself any longer.
“It’s nothing lurid,” he promised. “Actually, what I have in mind is a bit different to the standard game.”
John searched his face, his mind spinning the possibilities. Could they…? Could this really happen? It was no longer a question of whether either of them wanted it. They both wanted it. But there were still so many unknowns, so many risks he couldn’t foresee.
“Only the cheek, Greg?” John asked in a faux-innocent tone. “You were so eager to get this one started, I figured you would be lobbying for a little more than that.”
But that fascination had also scared Sherlock in a way he couldn’t quite comprehend, or explain even to himself. The way John looked at him when he played was unlike anything he’d ever seen directed at him before; it was almost too much. Too raw. It gave him a strange sensation of second-hand vulnerability, as if John looking at him like that could flay him open somehow and physically hurt him, even if he didn’t intend it to. Which was ridiculous, of course. He recognised it as such. But he couldn’t shake the feeling that growing too attached to John’s admiration would leave them both at risk for some terrible, unnameable pain. And so, whenever John paid attention to his music, Sherlock would pretend to be uncomfortable, would stop playing whenever he noticed John staring at him with that look that made his stomach do flips and his fingers forget the notes. Eventually, John stopped paying attention. Nowadays, whenever Sherlock played, John ignored him entirely.
“Right. So he takes them to some secluded area and then attacks them. No evidence, no witnesses. By the time anyone might suspect him he’s off serving aboard another ship. Clever son of a bitch.”
That last one, unexpected but horrifically detailed in his mind, caused him to break into a giggle.
True to Sherlock’s word, his penis hung soft and light between his thighs, in stark contrast to John, who was so hard by this point he was desperate to escape his own confining clothes. He set to work quickly stripping everything off, tossing them aside, until they were both exploring each other with their eyes. Sherlock seemed every bit as absorbed in the sight of John as John was with him, and for a moment this was enough for both of them.
The sound of the door latch rattling open sends John bolt upright where he stands. Someone enters the room behind him, and judging by how quickly the affection melts from Sherlock’s face, he has a pretty decent idea who it might be. Biting back a curse, John hastens to compose himself before turning to their untimely intruder.
