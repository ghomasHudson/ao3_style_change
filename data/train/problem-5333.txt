"We could have waited until the rain let up," Sam says and folds his jacket in his lap.
"What's up, Sammy?" He downs his glass and immediately remembers why he doesn't drink this stuff. "I thought you said you needed your beauty sleep."
He's half tempted to call up some shrink and go "So there was this, well,
In this car here there are no memories weighing him down, no ghost in the backseat breathing down his neck. Driving down the highway, he enjoys the silence and - once they put the windows down - the soft sound of the wheels running over uneven roads.
He felt like he was under water, muted somehow. Not just today; he’d been feeling this way for a while now. He had trouble pinpointing when exactly it had started. His perception of time was out of balance. All the days travelling here by car had felt like one long dream sequence, but he knew he’d felt off before their departure too. It wasn’t necessarily a bad or good feeling, but it was unsettling. He couldn’t even say exactly what he felt  while he was helping his daughter prepare for her wedding. Whether the joy and hope or the fear for Charlie prevailed. He was looking at everything, including himself, from a bird’s eyes view.
"It was empty, ok!" Now Dean was the one who pushed his hair back. "There was nothing in the bottle for fuck’s sake. Just because you're in a bad mood, doesn't mean you have to-"
The white of Akiko's sclera underneath the sheath of blood. He made sure to close her eyes before he closed the trunk.
"They shouldn’t have started changing up the room so early on."
"Why?"
They park in front of Jody's house.
"Lila? What the hell are you doing here?"
He thought of Sam’s comments about that measly beer, his allusion to John, and grew angrier.
"Yeah, and?"
"Yeah. Maybe," he runs a hand through his hair, "maybe that's a good idea. I just need to get used it."
"Hello." He greeted her with a hug. "How was school?"
Charlie lay on the couch, dried tears on her red face, her hair a messy bun on top her head – like a chicken's nest, Castiel thought. Her right leg was raised onto some pillows and soaked in red. He ran the last steps to her. It took him a moment of horror before he realized that despite the blood, she was in no immediate danger.
Her hair falls over his face, tickling his cheeks, as she returns his kiss.
Dean put the phone down. Castiel didn’t know any better. He would never understand that sometimes it was better to stay silent.
"Can we just play for a little while?" She begged without letting go of Dean. "Only for a few hours?"
Castiel considered this for a moment. "Dean and I don’t tend to fight."
"That's like the bare minimum."
"Will you come with us to Oregon?" Castiel asks. "If Sam thinks going is wise?"
"I’m not talking to myself, Sam. Show me some respect. I don’t just show up for anyone. I asked you a question. Why am I here?"
"Look, man, I don’t know what you’re talking about. What girl?"
"The water is for Sam," Castiel explains, although Dean hasn't asked. "Sometimes he wakes up a little dehydrated."
“If you’re from heaven, does it mean I belong there too?“
"Yes, could be." Castiel turns his head towards the empty field beyond the gas station. "I read an article last night about a woman in Vancouver who revealed to her daughter that she’s adopted. This itself was, of course, not newsworthy. The strange thing was that the woman insisted she never meant to tell, that she didn’t mean to." He looks back at Sam. "Now her ex-husband is trying to get sole legal custody and she is fighting it by saying she wasn't of sound mind when she told their daughter - which I personally don't think is a very good legal strategy. But the relevant information for us is that she swears she didn't mean to tell her daughter. That it was like someone else was making the decision for her."
But Dean only tried on an encouraging smile.
Now it was two hands running over his face, as if he was trying to wash himself clean of his thoughts.
"But he's supposed to pay for the whole thing," Dean says, and Sam nods.
"Please don't say that," he says, his voice small and tired.
Dean smiled, satisfied, and went back to the tree.
Castiel's lips are drawn out into a thin line. He leans against the driver's door, looking entirely too human.
Sam seems fine, kinda.
"Oh, Sam…"
"Do you want to go outside, discuss things with Dean?" Sam shrugs helplessly. "I don't know."
When they had split up earlier today, he'd known that Sam and Castiel would have preferred to stick together —it wasn't exactly rocket science, even without the constipated look on their faces.
"I'm getting a drink," Dean says, as he reaches the end of the stairs, "anyone else?"
"What are you?" Sam asks. "What do you want?"
Castiel looked down. "They say they got her."
"You know you’re one of us too, right? That you belong with us?"
"We're out on a date," Sam says and shoves the milkshake towards Castiel.
"But you've not been in contact with her since you've slept with her."
They share a pained smile.
Sam stops brushing, when he realizes his gums are bleeding. They feel raw. He spits out red foam. He rinses. He opens the medical cabinet and finds some Ambien.
Castiel squints at him.
"Don’t say it like that. That’s not what’s happening."
He isn’t limping anymore.
Her head snapped around. “Are you saying I'm too stupid to find him?"
He laughed.
Sam puts his hand on Cas’ arm, his brows furrowed. "Why did you go looking for a case? You just got back and you’re still recovering."
"What is this?" Dean asks. "You know you're my best friend."
"So, I’m going to get some popcorn. And when I return you’ve decided on something or I’ll make you watch Metropolis again."
And Dean would have asked what exactly it was he felt sorry for.
When Sam turned to his brother, he expected an amused look on his face, but Dean had turned his back on him. He knelt on the floor and was busy emptying out Bobby's backpack.
It makes him stop and think for a moment. Maybe —yeah, maybe Sam is right. Maybe he’s been doing this more lately. The touching and the joking. The trying to be there for Cas, to make him feel better. But it’s not like he’s doing anything.
"It's alright," Sam says, "we are."
They kiss slowly and elaborately, tasting the new clarifications.
Sam nodded.
For God's sake.
"You just held hands, kissed and talked about your feelings."
"Long drive," Dean shrugs.
"Don't put yourself in danger." Sam looked at the child in his arms. "You know that Charlie needs her uncle."
Dean raises an eyebrow at the surprise in Sam's voice. What, like he's incapable of typing in 'weather portland today' into his phone?
Dean watches the tank guzzling up the gas and eat up their money.
"That's not what I meant," Sam says, although he thinks it might be true. "I just meant, you'd generally try to show yourself from your best side."
He thought that he played his role as a normal brother very convincingly, as he followed Sam into the restaurant area with a shopping cart full of things, a stuffed unicorn sitting on the very top.
"Why would she do this?" He grabbed Castiel's arm. "We can't let her do this!"
Dean takes a look around. It's your normal waiting room, kind of bougie, with no signs of anything supernatural. Across from him hangs an oversized oil painting of a woman lying in a sea of cornflowers. She looks peaceful, her eyes closed, her arms spread over her head and sunshine bathing her face. Dean feels a strange sense of envy.
"Does it seem logical though?" Dean tips his empty glass with only his index finger, balancing it carefully. "Because I've seen you stressed before and I've seen you on some heavy medication, and you didn't start hallucinating then. So what's different now?"
"What were you thinking?" he asked and loosened the hold on her to look at her face. "If you trigger the alarm then we will... then the whole evening will..."
"I don't think so."
Jodie Mills picked up after the first ring.
He kissed her hair and then gently pushed her away.
"I think you’ve misunderstood Sam."
"You think you know someone..."
"Dean-"
"Cas... what the hell did they do to you?"
"We only got him back today and he is in a very vulnerable state. I am definitely not going to do anything that might endanger him now."
He grabs his jacket and leaves for the counter to pay.
"They had Cas," Dean says. "I'd have done the same thing."
"Well, great," Charlie said, standing up. "I guess then I'll bow to you and your tyrannic regime once more." With that, she disappeared out of the room.
"You can cross-check tomorrow, Sam. When you're less likely to make mistakes."
"As long as you're alive, Sam wishes to return."
Sam stretches out, takes a disposable napkin in his hands and balls it up in his fist. A nervous gesture. "Some stuff the therapist said, you know, it got me thinking… " He squeezes the poor napkin to death. "About living an authentic life."
He’s got his eyes closed, but it feels like they're open. He’s seeing things, not just imaging them.
"You broke up with him because of them, didn't you? I think then the two should at least own up to it. The way they are right now... it's just kind of ridiculous." She shook her head. "He takes Cas away from you and then he acts like nothing's happened? Not like that's the only thing I don't get about Sam. He always makes me so, ugh, so angry."
"No. You can't seriously want to hand over Charlie?"
Castiel gave Sam a quick look before answering. "Dean, what's wrong?”
He silently watched Sam stow away the rest of the shopping. Then Sam said, “I’ll go and see how Charlie is doing."
"Same." Dean ran a quick hand over his mouth. "The weekend with Charlie was great."
He's buttoning it up when Castiel walks in.
Sam swallows hard. "I don’t think Dean likes to be reminded of that fact. It’s kind of… a lot of pressure to put on one person."
Castiel didn't see how that could be possible, but he listened in silence.
"Your Dad taught you to hunt?"
"I just care," Dean says. Again, it sounds weirdly genuine, as if he’s actually convinced himself that that’s what he’s doing. Helping.
Sam can easily move away, if he wishes to do so. He doesn’t.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Your shoulder." She touches it, and he winces. She pulls her hand back. Even in the vague light, he can see there's some blood on her fingers. "Maybe you should go to a-" she starts saying, and he can feel her wanting to move away.
"So?" Sam shrugs. "Maybe it scares me for a good reason. It’s always gone wrong. And it’s also-" He looks at the bare wall on the other side of the room. "The last time I tried, actually tried to get out, I did. I loved it, but in retrospect, it was selfish. And even then I only managed to leave, because Dean was, well, I thought he was gone for good. You and him, both actually."
Back in this other life, the one he’d shared with Jessica, after Dean had pulled him away for a supposed weekend and he’d returned to a charred ceiling, he had thought he had lost the great love of his life. It didn’t lessen the pain he was feeling right now that he no longer believed in it. In the one great love.
Dean imagined hearing Sam sigh as he opened the door. »Take care of yourself, Bobby. Thank you for the Christmas party.«
"It wasn't a movie you would be interested in,” Castiel replied, then he added: "You were not here. When Sam asked me if I was interested in accompanying him to the movies, I answered truthfully.”
"No, of course I'm not giving up."
Dean's overeagerness to get him out of bed, to cook him food and act like an all-around mother hen suddenly makes a lot more sense.
"He lives here now," Dean said.
"Guess not," he says, after a second. He looks down at the body in front of them. "Thanks," he says again. "Silver bullets?"
"Don’t Charlie me! I was looking forward to seeing him so much and then he goes and treats me like this."
He was a burden, Dean had made that more than clear. Someone who had failed him both as a human being and as a brother.
He lowered the phone, a thoughtful look on his face.
"I wish you were real," he mumbled.
"No, I’m just thinking."
"He's definitely not in hell, if that's what you mean."
"I'm irritated, yes. It feels like you don't trust me enough to do my work."
"Maybe you should have thought about that earlier!" Dean knew that look, even though he'd rarely seen it on Sam. Most of the time he himself was the one whose helplessness turned into rage, while Sam remained patient and kind. "Before you called down all of heaven!"
How's that gonna feel? Losing Sam because he couldn't hear himself think over the sound of his own heart breaking.
"I hardly think that this counts as a real fight."
They kiss for what seems a long time, but in reality is not even a full minute.
"Dean," Sam pleads. "Just drop it."
"Not really."
It’s time to leave the pool table when raised eyebrows turn into accusations.
Sam turned to the door and seemed about to leave.
"All I'm saying is that Sam might have done a few things some might consider a sin."
Sam pointed in the direction where he had come from. Then he pushed past Castiel into the bathroom.
He wishes they’d have turned her before he’d arrived so he could have just killed her easily. It wouldn’t have been quite so clear then, that this is on him and him only.
"I have a great sense of humor and comedic timing."
He doesn't zap away, instead he moves towards into the corridor and up the stairs.
It’s been so damn long that he’s kissed anyone —voluntarily and not just in his dreams.
"She belongs to heaven and I will take her back there."
"No," Sam says. "It's fine. I didn't."
Something has changed between them. She is on his side now, and wants him to succeed. Despite the blood on his shirt and his strange demeanour, she thinks him trustworthy. What would she think if she knew there was a corpse in the back of his car?
"Is that irregular? One would expect parents not to hit their children."
Castiel squints. "I don't understand. "
It's not exactly a big kitchen. There's not a lot of room to do anything. On the counter, maybe. Against the fridge? It all seems bizarre. The images in his head aren't corresponding to the two people before him.
Sam closes, no, opens his eyes again, and tries to sit up.
Dean leans back against the cool tiles and shrugs. He looks away from Castiel's troubled face again. He doesn't want to think about Castiel's "new experiences".  A look at the door prompts him to wonder what kind of daring person scribbled ACAB with a Sharpie on the frame. Especially considering there are cameras in the bathroom.
Sam smiled.
Her blue eyes were on him, thoughtful and red-rimmed, as if she had cried.
It’s near empty. The three of them stand out like a sore thumb. Cas’ get-up alone would be enough to get everyone to stare. Dean should have gotten him to wear some of his clothes instead.
The movie from the 60's Sam mentions is
"I understand," Castiel said. "It won’t happen again, I assure you. I wouldn’t want you to think you can’t trust me with her."
"It didn't get you, did it?" she asks, breaking the spell.
Then she closed the door with a loud bang behind her.
It was not unusual for him to wake up alone in bed. He got it. It had to be boring for Castiel to just lie awake next to him with nothing to do; he wouldn't have expected him to stay all night. Still, Dean appreciated seeing his face first thing in the morning. Waking up alone always left him feeling a little hollow.
"Well, thanks for trying anyway."
"We have nothing but time. We don’t have anywhere to go."
"Yeah, I know. You were just reminiscing."
"Not really. Dean said we’ll return to the school in the morning to ask around."
"Sam." Once again Castiel tried to put a hand on his shoulder. Sam brushed it off. "Yes, you're right about most angels' attitudes towards nephilims. We were taught to consider a nephilim as an unnatural creature that poses a great danger. ”
The car ride back to Lebanon is long and feels even longer thanks to how uncomfortable he feels.
He pulls out the files and starts reading. He hopes this was worth it.
The puzzled look on Sam’s face is just maddening.
"Don't do this." He grabbed Dean's arm as tightly as carrying Charlie would allow him to. "Please."
"I'm sorry," Sam says. He rubs a finger over his forehead. "I'm trying to be. And I'm sorry you feel like I told Cas something that you wanted to keep private."
"Jesus! Will you stop saying that like it explains anything? What does that mean, you helped him?"
Sam stared after him.
"Wherever you are right now. Don't go there."
"You think I was joking?"
It took a while until Sam finally answered.
Castiel doesn’t really react.
Castiel said the same thing last night in bed, but Sam could still tell how rattled he was. More annoyed with himself than anything else. Sam understands. He throws a commiserate smile at Castiel, lets his hand slide off his shoulder and picks up his phone from the table to call Dean. He can tell that Castiel is getting more nervous with each silent second the phone is pressed to Sam's ear. And when he puts the phone down, Castiel looks at him like he expected more.
"Yeah," Dean nods. "I told you it went fine."
"I already told you why. I'm not saying people aren't acting weird. I just don't think it's anything supernatural."
"What did you want?" Dean's mouth twisted. "You wanted to tell me you're sorry for hurting me when I was always on your side? Let's not kid ourselves: You are not sorry."
»It's amazing, Cas! But also thanks for... well, everything else you did.«
Dean didn't turn up that night. Not the next day either. Sam told Charlie he was probably on a hunt, and not to worry, but he knew how hypocritical it was, considering the lump in his throat when he repeated the lines to her.
It hadn't been the cheating that Dean hadn't been able to forgive, and it hadn't been the lying either. It had been Charlie. And while Sam knew that his actions had causally determined her existence, there had been no way for him to foresee any of it.
Sam turned his head to get a look at the sleeping form of his brother.
Castiel being his thing makes sense. He’s improved Sam’s life drastically. It’s not just being close to someone who appreciates you, but also the act of loving itself. The knowledge that he's still capable of it. There's some baggage there, sure, but it's about as pure a love as Sam has felt for anyone since, well… How long ago was Jess? And even that relationship was rife with guilt and denial of his past.
Sam draws his lips into a thin unhappy line and tugs his hair behind his ear. Then he steps out of the car. Castiel and Dean follow. They're not dressed as FBI, they're not dressed as anything. It's on Sam.
"I told you we were trying to get you better textbooks. It's just that you need to know the boring bits too, so can take the exams." He put a hand to her back, coaxing her out of Dean’s hands. "Come on, Cas is probably already waiting for you."
"I know. So you'll understand that I have to protect my family."
Castiel had been silent for so long that his voice seemed unusually deep to Sam now. Castiel put the wine glass down onto the table and went to grab his daughter's hand, but she pulled it away.
"Nothing. Must have imagined it." Sam kneels down next to the box. "Just some noise from one of the other rooms, I guess."
It feels nice and he doesn’t want to ruin it, so he lets him. He doesn’t say that he’s pretty sure Castiel got it wrong.
"Anyway," he says. "We can talk about how good I am at compartmentalizing my time in hell another time. Right now I'm more interested in the fact that my brother fantasizes about rolling in the hay with Lucifer. You think this was the first time? Is this like Stockholm Syndrome or something?"
"Alright. So that's still your plan, bringing him back?"
"Forget it, Sammy. It’s fine. So I can’t ever fully forgive you? So what. Hardly the first time.”
This was not going to end in violence. He needed to stay calm, if he wanted to see Charlie again. But it was difficult to think of her while his head was spinning and his fist wanted nothing more than to smash into Sam's face.
"We need to be honest with each other if we want it to work."
"Look at you and all your 10 dollar words."
Sam reaches out to touch his delicate and distraught face, to smooth out the lines of irritation around his lips.
He already knows what Dean’s is going to answer and he agrees. It’s not a good thing.
"Dad! Dean! Over here!"
"Yeah, maybe not."
That was a strange question too. After all, they were all waiting for the children to put on street clothes. Where was he supposed to be going in the meantime?
"Here?" Dean asks, not understanding.
“You have a couple of hours before you have to get up. Let's go back to bed."
Dean followed him into the kitchen and sat down at the table. He'd never gotten this far into the apartment before. It was clean and more spacious than he'd expected it to be.
"So you were out together when I called Cas?” He asked Sam, who gritted his teeth in response.
He wants to turn the volume down, he's not interested in war right now. But he doesn't move a muscle and keeps his eyes on the screen.
Sam gets shaken out of his thoughts, the memories fade into the background slow as molasses.
Jesus.
"He wanted to make extra sure that he'd die," Dean says, so much resignation in his voice that the officer must think he's sad about the suicide and not the fact that they got no case here now.
Castiel threw his daughter a doubtful look across the table.
"What’s in the bunker that can’t wait another day?"
Finally Dean understood. He got up and wiped over his mouth with the back of his hand, as Castiel hurried to pull his underpants and pants up.
"She called us in need. The world of men is not right for an angel. You especially should know that."
"What?" Sam asks. "Who?"
"No."
"What do you think? Of course we did."
"I’ll be with you in a moment," Castiel told Sam. "I’m just going to clear the table first."
Castiel tried to reach for Dean to embrace him, but he pushed him away.
Dean tries to ignore the burning sensation the touch drives up his thigh.
Dean rubs his hands together, the bacon grease leaves an oily film. "So witches, huh?"
If anyone else said this, it would sound cheesy and off. Sam knows Castiel means it. It's not just a phrase to him; he actually knows Sam's soul.
Of course the accidental explosion had only worked as a diversion, but it had been enough to buy him time.
"Last night when Sam wanted to be on his own, you told me Sam might just need some time for himself. I thought it might be similar today. But I don't think this was it."
"But they were when they came in?"
Not for the first time, he thinks a bunker might not be the best place for someone depressed. Maybe he should try and get more daylight. Spend more time outside. They could do research outside in the woods instead of in the library sometimes. They could get away more often to get lost in each other and forget time. It's different in the bunker, where it always feels like you're only waiting, going from one case to another and another. Where Dean is always at the forefront of Sam's mind.
He’s a little bit surprised when Sam does start talking.
He knows what Castiel is about to say before he does.
"It's a very special door. It is different from all other doors. Maybe you've seen it?"
Castiel holds his gaze. "The desired amount of food?" He guesses. "How hungry you are."
"If you don't attempt to speak to your brother, do you think this problem, this insecurity will go away by itself?"
"Oh, you guys are keeping secrets from me again?" Dean taps his fingers against the table. "Great, that's just great."
"Yeah, yeah." He seems far away as his hands muss up his hair. "Just need some air." Then he’s out of the door.
"So you really have no idea who I’m talking about, huh?"
He just wishes Castiel could see him for who he really is too. For someone to fully see him.
The doorbell caused Castiel to stop. Sam got up automatically. He glanced at the clock. It was almost eleven. Maybe someone had rung by accident.
"I really don't want to take a shower right now."
In the cupboard, he finds a Single Malt he’s kept there for a few months now, waiting for a special moment. This will have to do.
Sam snorts. "Yeah, I don't know. My dad could get really scary when he was drunk. And at times, when he wasn't drunk too, to be honest. But what I meant was, that he never hit me for disciplinary reasons, even though he was all into that military shit... I'm not sure why he didn't."
He had spent so much time saving Sam from others, monsters and humans alike, but he'd neglected saving him from himself.
"Of course it’s my fault," Dean says.
"No," Sam agrees. He's taken out full nests himself before. He has vague memories of it happening more often when he was soulless, but he doesn't want to dwell on them. These memories always feel weirdly detached and technicolor at once. They are like intense nightmares where he remembers the feeling so clearly but the dream logic is off. He doesn't want to be reminded of the high of killing when it's detached from a conscience.
Dean swerves his head around, stopping Castiel in his tracks.
He almost bumps into Castiel, when he appears just inches in front of him.
"What are you doing here?" Dean asks.
They've been so bogged down in work lately, he hasn't had a chance to go out and forget about everything. He'd probably be less paranoid if he could just drive over to the next bar, chat up some lucky lady and spend the night at her place.
He goes to lean against the car.
"Sure."
Dean looks down at the limp slice of pepperoni pizza in his hand and snorts. "Not really. But you're still going to finish it."
"What's wrong?"
"If there is anything else that is bothering you, please tell me. After all these years, I hope that there is no need for you to hide things from me."
He remembered bits and pieces of the night, memories like a vague dream that he's overanalyzed to death. It hadn't been about Castiel. Sam had been such a drunk emotional mess, he probably would have slept with just about anyone who'd offered compassion. He didn't want to think about what that said about himself too deeply. But while he knew he hadn't been interested in Castiel that way back then, he blamed himself for getting so drunk in the first place. As a consequence, he had become much more weary of and careful around alcohol since then, something that hadn't exactly helped things between himself and Dean.
"I really didn't want to go to heaven," she whispered. "I just prayed to be home again."
"Okay." Sam looked around the room for his bag until he remembered that he had put his clothes into the closet. He had to pass Castiel to get to his stuff.
"Pull yourself together!" he snapped at Sam. "We'll save her, alright? But I need you to be a hunter right now, and not a panicked father, you hear me?"
Sam’s always acting like he’s going to scold him or punish him for his actions, when really he should know that most of the time, Dean’s letting everything slide.
He drops the wallet onto the floor of the car and dives into her.
Sometimes it even feels like not that much has changed. Just him and his best friend and his brother. A best friend he’s aching for, sure, but the gift of suppression’s gotta be good for something.
"I know what you meant."
"Alright." Sam nodded.
Dean felt a little fuzzy for a moment. He gripped the steering wheel more tightly. It shouldn't hurt to hear these words. She seemed to sense his uneasiness.
Sam's smile broadens. Something about it knocks the breath out of his chest.
Sam seemed to gain the upper hand in the discussion. Castiel didn't know if he liked that.
He must have caught up with her somewhere outside the door. Dean's voice sounded even darker than usual, compared to hers, which grew louder and overturned with emotion.
Dean knew at once it wasn't one of his own tapes. Pearl Jam's "Alive" started playing in the middle of the song. Dean didn't like the song or band very much. He turned up the volume.
He can feel it in the tenseness of his shoulders and his jaw, the acidy taste in his mouth.
"I don’t care about that." Dean’s brow furrows. "I told you to be careful. You were literally doing the opposite of that."
"We are?" Cas asks, when the waiter’s left.
"Right, and if it does turn out to be something supernatural, I'd drive you guys back to the bunker, before taking it on alone. Yeah that makes perfect sense."
He lay still but for the slight tremor, spread out like a starfish, and closed his eyes.
"You're always being so literal."
Sam nods mechanically.
"In heaven we will teach her to overcome these feelings. Just like everything else human in her."
"We talked about things not pertaining to the case."
"Everything okay?" Dean asks Castiel.
"Dean!" Sam smiles brightly. "Dean, finally!"
The sentence came out wrong, a few aggression levels above the one he'd intended.
"You're hardly a war criminal," Sam says, and then, "well, I mean, to be honest I'm not sure what the Geneva convention says about intergalactical or celestial warfare."
"Why?" Castiel really doesn't seem to know.
Dean walks past him to his jacket. He fumbles until he finds his flask.
"I'm sorry, I should have probably asked for your permission first."
Just like that, they end up sitting across from each other, reading through online newspapers and other assorted websites. Dean gets them another beer and Sam drinks it too.
It seems inexplicable to Sam now: the fear, the dissociation, the flight response. Nothing about this is dangerous or scary.
He looked up and saw Sam behind her, closing Charlie's room door.
"I didn't want that! I never wanted that. And you know that!" Sam shook his head. "Have you ever asked him why he did it? Why he wanted a child from me but not from you? Should I have just known? I know what I did wrong, Dean, I know. I shouldn't ever have gotten so drunk, I should have been able to say no, and I shouldn't have lied to you, but... this all happened a decade ago. There's no way for me to change it now." He breathed out slowly. "What do you expect me to do about it? Do you really not want me to talk with him at all? Do you want me to ignore him completely? Alright, I’ll do it. I’ll move out and I’ll cut off all contact. But if I'm supposed to stay here and be cordial and be a family..."
"She was just such a wonderful girl", the mother repeats again and again, while she tugs on her white blouse. Everything else she’s wearing is black. She’d probably attractive when she’s not grieving. "Who would do something like that?"
He stretches out his cramped legs. Trying not to hit the table in the process, he ends up shoving his feet against Castiel’s.
Castiel gets out of his crouching position. He looks at Sam with big eyes. "Yes," he says, "let's." But he doesn't move. So Sam doesn't either.
Sam gets up, too, to clear the table, and to go to the bathroom. On his way back, he runs into Jody in the hallway.
He’s going to try. Goddamn it, he’s going to try to hard, like his life depends on it, because it fucking does.
"You are not going to die."
Sam gets up and reaches over the table to take Castiel's hand. With his other hand Sam reaches into his pocket and fishes out a 20 dollar bill, that he throws onto the table. All of a sudden he can't wait to get out of here now. At the door, Sam catches the waitress' eyes across the room and smiles. She returns his smile, unsure, her notepad pressed closely to her chest.
He took a sip from his glass. She looked at him with so much pity in her eyes that he wished he’d kept his mouth shut.
"I don’t know."
"This was definitely not my intention." Castiel raised his arms and then lowered them again. As if he didn't know what to do with them. "I just thought —Dean needed this translation and I wrongly assumed I could do both simultaneously. I thought I could translate and look after her at once."
He closes the laptop, puts his head in his hands and tells himself to think. Think, Jesus. First off: operate under the assumption that they're fine. They're not dead. They're fine. Did they go back to the therapist? Maybe he can call there - and say what? No, he calls Akiko first. Maybe whatever is behind this, knows they're on its tail. That still wouldn't explain why they would only target Dean and Castiel, and leave Sam alone, but first things first. The phone rings for barely a second before she picks up.
"Greek version of Veritas."
"What was he like? Hobbies? Friends? Did he show any eccentric behavior? Any recent changes his attitude or routine?"
"It's okay. I know how it is. It's good to hear from you now. And at least I knew you were doing okay from Dean."
"Look." He sighs, and runs a hand over his mouth. "Don't take this the wrong way. I like you."
"I guess that makes it okay, huh?"
Cas gazes up at him with searching eyes, looking for approval, and it takes all the strength Dean has not to show him just how much he approves.
Castiel answered quickly. "No, it’s not."
"So, this is a bit unusual for me. It’s not really customary for two men to dance like this."
He seems about to say something, to argue back. Instead he just puts his fingers to Sam’s face and pulls him closer.
He exhales sharply. "Nothing about our lives is
got a child now." Sam hated how he emphasized the words. "It sounds like a simple salt-and-burn. And anyway, you made it very clear that it’s not like it matters if something happens to me or not." He snorted. "Wouldn’t that make things easier for you anyway, with the whole happy nuclear family thing that you got going on?"
"I did, too. I am. I was. I-"
"Angels have their own music, too," Sam informs Dean. It's obvious how much that fact excites him. "But it's in wavelengths humans can't comprehend."
He liked it. He liked some of it.
"Um, yeah, sure." She takes the menu from the table and turns it around. "We got all kinds. Our customer's favorite is the coffee milkshake, though."
Dean had been with him in just one swift step.
"He can be a little awkward at first. It's nothing personal."
No answer.
The first people from the next table turned and looked over at them.
"She's pretty. If you're into that sort of thing."
"He was killed in a suspected animal attack," Sam adds.
He takes her gun, and puts it next to his. Then, gently, he disentangles her from the glass. He digs out the car keys from out of her pocket, before he takes her up in his arms. Her body is limp and lifeless, heavy in death. Her head lolls to the side, exposing her face.
"Well, you were kind of busy just now."
He looks beautiful.
Sam smiled as if he was in pain himself. Dean didn't remember his brother getting wasted. But he was quite hazy on a few details of last night anyway. The tinsel, for example, which he'd found on his body in various locations under the shower this morning.
"It is my business." Unlike Sam's, Castiel's cup of coffee is empty, the sound of it against Castiel's flat hand hollow. He puts it down, between his feet, out of Sam's eyesight.
He thinks he gets it now.
"Really? Wow, that's a lot of extra time on your hands."
"No."
It’s weird. The way Cas says his name.
Chapter Title taken from The Shins' "The Past and Pending".
"It wasn't me," Sam disagrees. "It was Lucifer. He told me-"
"Good luck, man," Dean croaks. "I’m gonna," he nods towards the sky, "watch the sunset or something. Can’t really make it much worse of a chick flick moment that it already is."
"No one. Fallon and Gary were meant to bring someone today, but they never got back… " He says the names like they’re meant to ring a bell. "We all wanted to leave tonight."
"He didn't actually tell me anything."
"The doctors have no idea."
"Well, she had many reasons, the angels weren't good to her, but that's not it. I think she has been pursuing the plan to bring you back to life all of this time."
The baby in Sam's arm was gone, instead a three-year-old Charlie stuck her face through the door frame.
"No," she says softly. "Look, I'm not trying to step on your toes here. I know you're all doing what you think is best. But I have to say, if not for your own sake, then at least for Sam's, you should really reconsider your stance. Hallucinations aren't a joke... And if he is as depressed as you say he is, that's a lot to put on a brother and a boyfriend."
It was a joke anyway. He just can't picture Sam sexting with anyone, let alone Castiel.
"You're talking about pie. That's not the same."
"You were gone for quite a while,” Charlie said, went over to one of the bags, took out a bright red apple, and bit into it with a loud snap.
"What?"
"No," Sam straightens up, a hand on the chest pocket of his suit. "You're right. We should split."
It’s not like it’s a really big deal. They are doing fine, better than most couples, Sam would wager, and for the most part talking to Castiel comes easy. Castiel has strong opinions on a lot of things from fantasy movies to people incorrectly quoting scripture. Sam loves hearing all of them.
"What?" She looks bewildered. "What do you mean?"
He averts his eyes, pushes some buttons, puts in some coins, and buys one can of coke and one soda water.
It's obvious that Dean doesn't believe there is a case. He doesn't need to say it; it's written all over his face. There's also the fact that Dean keeps looking for other cases on their supposed drive to Oregon. He takes a lot more breaks than usual or necessary - another dead give away. They are three stops in, stopping for gas first, then for snacks and lastly a bathroom break. Dean walks back from the gas station slowly while scrolling through his phone. It's obvious what he's doing. He looks up with a content look on his face, strolls back to the car and he tells them about hanging in Salt Lake City; the police has ruled out suicide but there was no break in. Sam begrudgingly agrees to check it out. At least they will be halfway to Portland by then, and Dean won't stop the car every five minutes.
"So you've only ever been with women," Dean nods.
They follow Dean to the car.
"Well why the hell not, Sammy?"
"Do you have Monkey with you? You know you have trouble falling asleep without him."
"I don't want you to be irritated by me either," Sam admits . "But I know that's a lot to ask for."
Castiel is still standing in that awkward way of his.
But he stays and watches as they get closer to each other. Dean has his arm slung around the woman’s waist as he pulls her out of the bar through the backdoor.
"Why?"
She looked at him questioningly.
"No," he shakes his head. "You’re a hunter?"
Dean knows something's wrong the moment they're ringing the doorbell and there’s no immediate reply.
"Who are you?" she asked when he found himself in the middle of a kid's birthday party that included a bouncy castle in the garden and a huge table full of cakes and sweets. The other children continued to play and paid him no mind. "Are you the wizard?" Sandy asked.
"I’m not pretending anything. I know what I am, who I am."
"Do you worry that I consider you simple?" Castiel narrows his eyes. "Because I can assure you, that's very far from the truth."
»I don't have a fever. I'm not sick.«
"You think that's what's going on here?" Dean put his fork aside.
"He was looking forward to seeing you too. You know him. You know he didn’t mean what he said." Castiel reached out for her. "I think as upset as the two of you still are, it would be best if I talked to him. What do you think?"
"Let's just get out of here," Sam says and presses past Dean's shoulder and towards his side of the car.
The only thing Dean does is keeping him from ending it all. Out of habit, maybe. And because he can't let go. Because he can't accept the fact that Sam would be happier if everything ended right now. Completely. For real. Finally.
"So you went out in the middle of the night? On your own?"
"Irrational?" Sam looked over his head at the wall.
"You think I would have cheated on her?" Sam wasn’t angry, he was rather fascinated by her train of thought. It seemed impossible he would ever have treated Jessica that way, but he knew you could surprise yourself by making bad choices.
"Already?" Sam asks.
"You've got to thank Sam here." She bumps her shoulder into Sam's arm. "He's not half-bad at cooking."
She jumped up to hug him and for a moment everything was fine.
"It’s not even that hot."
There was that discontented look in Sam's eyes again.
"I'm not hiding anything from you."
"You said that we wanted to move to California to live closer to Charlie and I happened to find this really great, empty house and somehow, that’s not good enough for you?" He couldn’t help his voice from getting louder. "What do you want apart from bringing us all down with your shitty mood?"
"I’m fine," Castiel repeats. "I don’t sleep at all anymore."
"That's just… Life with Dean," Sam says. "When he cares about you, he puts you on a pedestal. He creates this perfect version of you in his head, one that's impossible to actually live up to. So you start feeling bad because you're bound to disappoint."
It looks like Dean is about to cry, but he just bites down hard on his lower lip until all the color drains from it.
He thought of Dean's eyes burning into his just hours ago. He could still feel him, and could smell his musky scent - so different to Sam's.
"No, I mean — Most people who come in this late seem a little off and tired. I didn't notice anything. They didn't really talk much. Well, only one of them talked at all." Sam shows her the picture again and points at Dean. "Yeah, him. I spoke to him. The other one hung back. But really, there wasn't anything strange about them. He asked for a room for the night. He paid cash. That's it."
"I don’t know for how long I will be gone. I will try to make haste, of course."
It feels odd to see Dean in a clothing that Castiel associates so closely with himself. It feels good.
She turns to him, scrunches up her face. He notices there's a small scar between her eyebrows. "Maybe the property manager put it there?"
"Well, it wasn't vampires." Dean walks to the couch and sinks into the pillows. He goes through all the things that might help right now and he's mostly coming up with alcohol.
"Yes, but the things I said that night. I was so wasted."
It's the second time he's doing this today, undressing someone else, and it couldn't feel more different.
Sam assures him that he is. Castiel catches him by the shoulder, makes him face him again.
"And?" Sam asks, his face blank now.
"I am fine," Castiel keeps insisting, when he's still clearly anything but.
"And I feel a very strange sadness and confusion relating to your brother."
Sam nodded. He had taken off his shoes in the entrance area, which was strange because Dean was still wearing his. The rustling of the kettle filled the silence between them and from Sam's expression he could see that he was just as grateful for it as he was.
"You told me I'd ruined your life. You never wanted to see me again and I should never show my face again. You said you hated me." Castiel had stepped up to him. "Is that true?"
"Okay, so you didn't argue all the time. Sometimes you were having fun. Sometimes Sam was just being passive-aggressive and sometimes, when you looked at him with pleading eyes and- "
The room is surprisingly modern, the interior tasteful and personal - and nothing obviously deity-like about it.
"And I know I did," Sam says, softly shaking his head. "But I'm telling you I'm okay now. I'm fit to hunt."
He watches Cas watching Sam for a long time.
It felt like a glowing knife was being stabbed into his chest.
Sam doesn’t think he’s showing any kind of reaction but apparently he is.
"Well," she huffs out a laugh, "they seemed pretty compatible back in the kitchen. Before I turned around and ran out." Her expression flickers back to confusion. "I'm racking my brain here. What did I miss? They really didn't seem like a couple to me at all. Before five minutes ago, I mean."
It's harder to tell because this thing looks and sounds exactly like the Cas they know right now.
"Well, not nothing. She's clearly connected, she's just not the monster."
How did you explain the difference between sex and love to your eleven year old child? How did you tell her that not everything in life made sense or had a deeper meaning? He didn't even attempt it. He just smiled at her.
He stretches out his legs. A root sticks out of the ground and presses into his calf. It is not unpleasant to feel his body in such a way. It is not pain, just a punctured, concentrated sensation in one bundle of nerves.
Castiel had joined him in bed a few minutes ago. He did that most evenings when Dean went to sleep, but not always. He wasn't sure what Castiel was doing all night long, except taking care of Charlie, who, unlike him, thankfully needed to sleep.
The man squints up at Sam. "They gave me 50 dollars. Why would I rat on them?"
It feels like a really weird open invitation.
He's wearing his trousers, but he's shirtless, drying his hair with a small towel.
Dean nodded. They both didn’t mention that it had been so late, because Sam had planned to give Charlie away after the birth. Sam was probably thinking about it too.
"Mmh?" Sam said.
"I’m your worst nightmare if you don’t stop his bleeding right away."
Liking.
Sam sighed. »I just hope there won't be too much drama if you guys decide to break up and I have to keep working with the both of you.«
Sam leaned his forehead against Castiel’s. They were silent.
He had addressed it himself, and yet Castiel’s words irked him. Why didn’t it sound like Castiel was stating a fact to him, but like criticism? As if the condition of the house was Dean’s personal fault. Maybe because ever since they had moved here four months ago, Sam had thrown him the same dark look every single day. As if the world was going to end and as if this house, this life, everything was beneath him.
"There was no oath," Castiel says. He contemplates Dean for a moment. "I don't understand why you don't want Sam to know. He knows you well. He understands why you would not want to draw attention to your suffering."
"I wanted to apologize," Sam started the sentences that he had prepared to say to him over the last days. "I shouldn't have said what I said."
Dean takes the bags out of her hands and puts them down onto the pavement. She offers no resistance.
To Castiel's surprise, Sam nodded. "Alright. Thanks, Dean.”
"I was, I swear."
"They want to kill them?"
Castiel blinks. "Yes. Sam said it did, at least." He furrows his brow. "Is this what you wanted to talk to me about in private?"
It wasn't until he was in the house that Sam realized how cold he really was. The heat from the stove burned itself uncomfortably into his joints and muscles, now that the numbness slowly subsided.
"Okay."
"Please try."
She fiddles with a ball pen. "Are you police?"
Charlie shook her head. "And if I say no, will you let them kill us?"
"I'll be quick, sweet girl," the man whispered close to her face. "I'll give you a wonderful dream."
"Can I take a look?"
Chapter title taken from Aerosmith's "Dream On".
Sam hesitates a second, looks at Dean as if to check if he's allowed to shake her hand. "Yeah, I am. I'm Sam. And you are…?"
In his desperation, he even imagined Sam being there with them and the lectures he would give him about the city’s historic development. He smiled just before putting another spoonful of Cioppino into his mouth. He didn’t even like seafood.
A quarter of an hour later, he was about to get up and start looking for him, when the door finally opened.
Castiel really likes hugging, too. Sam is pretty sure that Castiel doesn't technically need to breathe. Sam likes to think it still means something when the rhythm of his breathing changes. When Castiel presses his face into his chest and the muscles under Sam’s finger start to relax. Or when they kiss and the opposite happens. Castiel’s exhales become ragged and there’s a hitch to his voice when he speaks against Sam’s lips.
"So I get that you're weird about food," he says again, "but what I don't get is: why is this," he draws a little circle over the food on their plates, "any different?"
Dean's sure it's costing Sam all his energy not to point fingers.
He’s only ever met one vampire who was different. But it doesn’t feel good to think about him, either. He always tries to push the memories of Benny away. The longing for the camaraderie and feeling understood and accepted are equally as tormenting as his bad conscience.
He looks at her. She's petite, young and pretty enough that Dean would probably make a move on her. Although, come to think of it, Dean hasn’t really been doing much of that lately.
He averted his eyes as Bobby sat down again.
"It's fine. Really. It's there for me to use it and I can't think of a better way than making you better."
“Oregon?"
She brings them herbal tea and puts down a metal box filled with rock-hard cookies onto the round kitchen table surrounded by four chairs. The small kitchen is full of cookbooks and pots and pans. On the wall hangs a huge black and white Nick Cave poster. Dean is still trying to get a read on the place and the woman, as she ushers them to sit down.
"Are you?" Dean huffs.
"Yeah," Dean says. "That’s what I generally mean when I say something’s worth checking out." He looks at Sam like he’s an idiot. "I'm gonna take a shower to get the stink off and then head out."
Dean follows Cas into the kitchen.
He laughed, then got up and went to the window. It was important that Sam could only see his back.
She glances at Dean and Castiel, and then she steps aside.
"Alright, in that case, I'd say what can when do so that wont happen again? I know you wanna play the martyr, but this isn't just about you. If you freak out like that again, there are lives at stake. Besides, if you're gonna die out of stubbornness, I'd kick your ass in heaven for eternity."
"He is supposed to arrive in three hours."
He thinks he can see it in Sam's body, too. He's more relaxed around him. His shoulders are less hunched. He smiles more. At Dean, too. Or at least, Sam's smiles don’t drop when he’s around. Whatever. Pretty much the same thing. It feels good. Proof that he's acing the "taking care of Sam" thing.
»So this ghost in Nevada.« Bobby coughed up some phlegm. »Should be a simple salt and burn.«
Het lets his hand wander from Cas’ shoulders to his elbow, lets it stay there and wills the touch to say what he can’t.
"You could just call Cas. He got a new phone."
"A week maybe?" She smiles at him, gentleness in all her features. "They will come back to you if that is their truth."
He breathed heavily. His heart was racing. The strong pounding in his forehead still kept the repentance at bay, which always followed his emotional outbursts. But it would set in soon.
"So what are you saying?" Dean huffs. "We just leave him like this, and hope for the best?"
"I do not owe you," he hears Castiel argue behind him. "And I did not voice any doubt about the existence of a nest, I was merely stating my objection to-"
"I don't know."
She had given up her cover and dashed forward. That was the moment the monster had been waiting for all the time. It also shot forward, but collapsed lifelessly onto the ground the next moment as Dean's blade pierced his heart from behind.
"No. Of course not. What would that help? You are safest here, too."
Sam orders buckwheat-pea waffles. They don’t sound that enticing, but the rest of the savory food sounds even worse.
"I'm harder to kill," Castiel says, a smile slowly spreading across his face. "I think that speaks in my favor."
Castiel put his hand to his aching forehead.
The voices had died down. They were not fighting anymore, and when Dean stepped into the library, they were sitting on the couch in silence. Sam had his arms on his thighs, his face in his hands hidden behind the curtain of hair.
(There’s no number great enough).
"Are you hearing him now?" Dean asks.
He didn't know exactly why he didn't enter the hallway, but he suspected it was Dean's tone that made him stay inside his room.
Dean watches as Castiel pushes a strand of hair behind Sam's ear and kisses his forehead. Sam smiles at the touch.
"Yeah, sorry," he mock-apologizes. "I forget you’re the expert on him now."
"Jesus Christ, Sammy."
"It's not so bad," Dean says. It's true. The blood makes it look worse than it is. "I got him off before he could take a proper bite. It's not deep"
"We're not really fighting.”
Sam leans onto his arms, a habit he often falls into when he’s trying to seem less intimidating. "Your google reviews say that you guys do great coffee," he says.
Dean pulled himself together.
"Okay, forget about it. I just thought." She stopped and looked at the clouds in her coffee. "Okay, so, in all seriousness: Where do we want to start? Police station? Mortuary?"
Now they were strangers facing each other again. Dean reached for his cup. The coffee had gone cold long ago.
Sam bites his lips, he hates watching these scenes. The hardened features on Dean's face, trying to not let any emotions show. Castiel's sunken shoulders, the neutral expression he tries to hold onto.
They both look down at their still entangled hands.
Dean stops the car, and looks out at the two story house behind the white picket fence.
Dean laughed.
"Being with someone who's so — " Dean makes a face. "You know." He shuffles his feet. "So hard to read."
Sam bites down on his lip. "You can't force me not to hunt."
Dean laughed. "No wonder where Charlie got it from. You were always good at running off too."
"Why wouldn’t I have?"
There's no waterworks, no wailing. Instead, Dean emits a single sound that's closer to sea lion than a human being.
"No?" She cocked her head. "Then why does Dad spend so much time with us?"
Dean glares. "And what the hell is that supposed to mean?"
Castiel pulls away, a slight upcurl of lips, almost a smile on his face.
Castiel shook his head and followed her.
"He didn't say."
Dean raises an eyebrow. "I never said it to you."
The door to the therapist's office opens. A young man with a nervous look on his face hastens outside. Dean wonders if he should warn him. Maybe he's already infected. But he can't think of a way of doing it without raising suspicion. And anyway, the hope is that when they kill the therapist, the curse or whatever it is will be lifted from everyone else too.
He couldn’t answer. He felt dizzy. No, he felt like he was drowning again. Felt the pressure on his eardrums grow with each second he stood here.
The water stops running. The boiler is quiet again.
»I'm cold.« Sam forced the words out of his trembling lips. »I need a warm shower.«
. We're just friends." He's thinking about saying "I don't swing that way" but decides against it. It's an unnecessarily lie, even though he once believed it to be true. It's irrelevant to the discussion at hand and needlessly defensive.
"No. I just wish he took me more seriously."
Sure enough, when she opens the door, they find Sam asleep. He’s on his stomach, decoratively draped over the small bed, his arms sprawling over the frame. Dean can see his hand, in a tight fist, touching the floor.
There is a good chance he'd survive and he doesn’t want to end up in a wheelchair. He doesn’t want to be more of a nuisance to others than he already is.
"Why didn't you answer me earlier when I asked where you were?” he asked Castiel.
"Yeah, thanks." Sam quietly shuts the door behind him. "Think I'm just tired. I need some sleep, I guess."
"Oh for fuck's sake." Dean scowls. "He'd be
"No." Thank God, small mercies. "He doesn’t have to say it. I can tell."
Dean hates getting Baby's interior wet.
"Hey," Sam says. "Sorry. I tried to catch up with you, but you'd already left."
"I still don’t quite understand," Jason said. "So…" He looked between Charlie and Cas. "So you think your Dad would have just died again if we had taken him with us, right? Because of, um, some rules? But why? I mean I still have trouble wrapping my head around the whole idea of a man having a child in the first place and I still don’t quite understand how that is supposed to work from an anatomically point of view —" Charlie threw him an angry look and he sat up straighter. "But that’s on me of course!" He cleared his throat. "So, um, what I meant to say: Sam died because of Charlie’s grace, right? And he would have died again if you had brought him back. But - and maybe that’s a stupid question - but: what’s different now? Why shouldn’t he die again this time?"
"I'm sorry," Castiel says. "I didn't immediately understand you wanted to be alone with Dean."
"Are you hungry?" Dean asked.
Yes, Dean the great hero.
"Yeah, man, you sure seem concerned about my well-being." His words very dripping with sarcasm.
Castiel looked at him, waiting for more of an explanation.
"Cas…." Sam sounds much too confused.
"Sam knew something was wrong when you didn't text back right away."
Sam presses Cas' cold hand closer to his cheek, unravels the fingers one by one until they’re starfished over his face.
"That we’d both be with him."
"What are you sorry for?" Dean asks, just as Castiel says: "There's no need for you to be sorry, Sam."
"I'm not good at this," Castiel says quietly. "I have never had to do this before."
Sam gets undressed. It's unnerving to have Castiel watch, but it would be even stranger for him to tell him to turn around now. And anyway, he's seen him in boxers many times before, there's no need to feel self-conscious now.
Castiel's face remains grim. "It seems like in so many cases I'm more of a hindrance to you two than a help."
He turns the volume up.
The fields on the side of the road blur together with the sky. It makes Sam think of that one big famous expressionist painting Jessica had liked. He can’t remember the name or the artist, he just remembers the framed print above the headboard.
"I still think it would be a good idea," Sam suddenly said. "To send her to a kindergarten, I mean. Or any other place where she'd get to meet some other kids. I know she's not like other children, but we can't protect her from everything all of our lives. I don't want her only people of contact to be us and Dean."
"And tell them what? That some of my patients stopped coming to therapy? That a few of them behaved erratically?" She shakes her head. She has calmed somewhat. "Besides, there's client confidentiality." At this she throws a meaningful glance at Sam. "Who are you anyway?"
"Oh, I almost forgot about the pie." Sam bent down for the tote bag that stood next to the table. "I hope you still like cherry?"
“If you don't mind, I'd prefer to stay in. Maybe watch a movie on the couch and then go to bed early. I'm really beat."
Sam shrugged and reached for the plastic-sealed menu that was on the table. He was hungry but he had no appetite.
"No, okay. But I could tell people about events in the future and when they come to be true, everyone will think that I'm –"
He jumps in his seat, when Castiel's hand appears on his knee.
Dean nodded and raised the phone into the air, then they both started running. The beam of light danced over weeds that had bored their way through the asphalt and debris.
"I... My boyfriend has my wallet." She pointed outside. "If you want you can go ahead." Then she walked away and everything suddenly made sense to Sam.
"Hello," Castiel replies and closes the tab he was just reading, but not before Sam can see it’s a Nebraskan newspaper.
"As an angel she will-"
Sam did not say anything anymore. He just looked silently out of the window.
He eyes Dean’s jacket.
"You are the one who suggested Sam might need more space," Castiel points out, accusatory.
"What can I say? I’m just a nice guy, Sammy."
Sam nods.
Things have been a little strained ever since the early morning between them. Which is entirely on Sam.
His amusement slowly turns to anger, as Sam’s denial of everything plays back in his head.
"Yeah, that's my name, so?"
"Come on, Zeppelin," she shooed the dog over to a blanket designated for pets.
Dean turned around without another word. The next moment, the heavy wooden door was slammed shut so loudly that Sam thought the recessed decorative windows would fall out of the anchorage. Charlie flinched.
"I can always provide you with opioids, if you wish, Dean," Castiel says bemused. "But why would you need them when I’m around?"
The line between perceived intention and blunder blurs more often. Innocent mistakes can feel like disinterest, brute honesty like personal neglect. There are times when Sam finds himself irritated or hurt by Castiel's behavior. But the more time Sam thinks about each individual case, the more muddled his feelings get. Until he’s not sure anymore if irritation is fair, jealousy warranted, pain appropriate.
Cas and Sam are still his and he doesn’t give a rat’s ass how possessive that may sound. They're still his. They’re just, also, each other’s now.
Dean pressed his lips together tightly.
"Moveantur!"
Dean made his face disappear in his hands. He took a deep breath. “Sorry."
"It’s fine," Cas says. "Maybe I was mistaken."
It's why Sam has never been very attached to places. Not to the bunker as a home, not to Kansas. Not even to Stanford. Once Jessica had asked him about dream places to live. He'd been able to think of cities he wanted to see, countries he wanted to visit. And sure, there had been places he'd feel more comfortable than others. But he's never felt tied down to a location.
"Charlie!" Castiel tried to reach her before she could close the door.
He touches his neck, as he takes in the woman in front of him. She's breathtaking. His eyes wander from the gun in her hand over her torn flannel to her hooded, almond-shaped dark eyes.
He turns around. "If they've been finding at least two of their victims at the same coffee shop, they gotta be really familiar with this place. They're probably regular customers or even employees maybe," Dean says, matter-of-factly. "They're comfortable enough in their routine and don't expect to be caught. They don't have nests like vampires, since they don't run in big groups. But I doubt they keep their victims in just any old regular flat. So I'm thinking warehouses in the surrounding area, something like this."
"It'll just take a minute." Dean slams the door, muffles their voices inside the car. He just needs a breather. Just one second to think.
"I don't know, we could play mini golf? It's a nice day out and - " Apparently Dean's laughter deterred him, because he stopped speaking for a moment. "Or we could drive to the furniture store. I still need a small cabinet for the bathroom and some towels. Besides the food's not too bad there."
"What’s wrong?" Castiel furrows his brow. "You still don’t seem happy to see me."
Sam’s attempt at mediating was so heartbreakingly helpless that it only added to the dull feeling inside Castiel’s chest.
"I get it, there really isn’t enough space in a car. It’s deadweight."
"I don't think there is a list," Castiel says, all serious, and Dean laughs.
Places that mean something to him are exactly those he wants to avoid. Meaning is hardly ever tinged in anything that doesn't depress him.
"I don’t know."
Like they’re former roommates and not whatever you’d call what they were. He tends to shy away from the words his mind offers up. Abuser. Victim. It doesn’t sound right. It doesn’t seem to correspond to what he knows happened, what he felt and still feels.
He felt like being pushed, but in a good way. "Heaven is not space. Heaven is —As far as I know, there are unfortunately no documentaries that accurately depict heaven. But you'll get to know it one day. It's the most beautiful place there is."
It was a loud, almost hysterical laugh. Everything about this situation suddenly seemed so absurd to him, that his reaction did not even feel inappropriate.
Sam scans his face for a moment. "Are you saying that because you really think so, or because you don't want to tell me there's a case as long as I'm not ‘supposed to’ hunt?"
Castiel looks down at his hands. Without saying another word he picks the phone from the inside of his jacket.
"Probably. And he's definitely going to get smashed."
"You don't care about that? But I heard your calls. You were asking me-"
"How many pills did you take?"

"It smells like cat piss," a voice in Sam's head provides. He only realized he's mumbled the sentence out aloud when Castiel says: "There’s no feline urine in the near proximity. What you perceive as such is just very salty fear- and dread-induced human sweat. But I see how you could mix up one for the other.”
, I know that. But she's still so young, Cas. She shouldn't make these big decisions until she really knows what that means for her.“
"I think you explicitly telling me to keep information from Sam would count as keeping secrets."
"You know,” Sam continues, “I don't think I'd ever truly hated my father before that moment. Like actual full-on hatred." Castiel is still watching him. Sam scrapes the top of his sole over the kitchen floor. "And Dean... I was so angry with him. He didn't even seem to really mind! I get that he was pretty young himself and I know he was always trying to protect me and wanted things to be as normal as possible for me. He wanted me to think our family was... functioning? But to me back then, it was like he was saying it was fine, you know? I felt almost betrayed? That he was saying Dad acting out like this was okay. Dean's always had this tendency to act like everything's great, when the world is falling apart around him."
"I’m doing well."
Sam sat down next to Castiel. His legs pressed uncomfortably against the underside of the table.
Someone approached him.
The bench felt hard under his buttocks. He slid back and forth to find the most comfortable sitting position possible.
"Do you think Dean would have been more welcoming to me if I had had another vessel?"
It’s still pre-noon.
"You almost died," Dean says matter-of-factly. "Not just that. You could’ve gotten other people killed, too. You ever thought about that? When you told me you were fit to hunt, that you were fine?"
"Thanks for helping me decimate the population of eviltown again." She smiles. "Goodnight, Sam."
"I think you're mistaken." Castiel shifts in his seat and turns his body towards Dean. "Sam doesn't deserve me. He deserves something else. Someone better."
"Yeah, maybe." Dean pulls out the gun. "You can go and check for him there. I’ll just make sure we got everyone."
He towers over Castiel. His posture isn’t intimidating —humans will never not seem tiny— but his anger is.
"Yeah, don’t worry." Maybe this coffee does taste a tad too bitter after all. "I’ll make sure to ask Cas next time, if I want to hear how you’re really doing."
"I get it, okay?" Sam says, and takes ahold of Castiel's shoulders, rubbing his thumbs over the fabric of his coat. "You don't want to feel caught in between any fights. But Dean and I aren't even fighting. We're just," Sam pauses to think of the right words, "in a slight disagreement. I think two weeks sitting around on my ass is enough time to prove that this whole... the whole hallucination thing was just a one-off. Dean still doesn't trust it. That's it."
"You know that's not true. We all love you and you just got into a little fight with Lila. That's no big deal." Sam pulled her close. "Who do you think doesn't like you?"
Dean was surprised to only find Sam inside. "Where’s Charlie?"
A warm feeling spread through Sam and pictures - memories of touches, laughter and kisses - flooded him.
"Did you drink from it?!" Charlie's eyes widened in terror. "Was there still something in it?"
Except of course this time Castiel's not that human. He's just a weak full-blown angel. And Dean’s not the only one taking care of him, not by a long shot.
Sam raises an eyebrow.
"Last night after you fell asleep, I was browsing the news." He turns his head sharply towards Sam. "You remember Portland? You asked me to tell you if I planned on going again."
"Are you cold?" Sam asks.
"I have no news."
"Is everything okay?" He felt Castiel's warm fingers on his hand.
Dean nodded. "Should we get you something?"
"Don't worry, mom,” Dean patted him on the shoulder. "I'm gonna get her home before midnight.”
Sam glances back at him. It's strange, Sam thinks, as he watches Castiel walk out of the room, that it's exactly the things we care the most about that paralyze us, that seem so insurmountable.
Sam smiles. "Thanks," he says. When he moves his hand over the table, Castiel understands and does the same.
Castiel's voice now also seemed strangely husky. Sam had never heard him talk like that before. Normally, he only sounded this human when he got angry.
The lady at the desk wears her hair in a red-tinted perm. She pretty much waves them through, as she’s leafing through a battered romance novel. She doesn’t want to hear their story.
There had been moments where he’d been so sure. Moments in which it had seemed like Castiel would have kissed him, if Sam hadn’t put a stop to it. If he hadn’t pulled away, said something to shift the mood, mentioned Dean… Now he wonders if he’d just misinterpreted all the signs.
"When I got here and you weren't there -” Dean closed his eyes for a moment, as if he felt a dizzy spell. "I thought I lost you. I thought something had happened and -”
Unhealthy, tangled-up, crazy? Oh yeah. Most definitely.
It was just a cut, he wants to say.  He takes a step back, lets Castiel slide off him. Castiel opens his mouth again. "Don't," Dean says and puts up his hands.
»What exactly are you doing out here? It’s freaking cold!«
“Oh wow, that’s really reassuring to hear!“
"Maybe you're right." Sam's voice was firm now. Maybe he was just exhausted. "This is a very good hospital and maybe they or we will find a solution and everything will be fine, but maybe not." Sam reached for Dean's hand with an intensity that startled him. "All I want to say is that I might die, whether we like it or not." He swallowed. "I know I have no right to ask anything of you. Not after what I did. But still." He took a deep breath. "Please Dean, take care of them when I can't do it anymore. You have to protect Charlie."
"Are you satisfied with your pool endeavor?" Cas asks.
Through the swing door, they’re alone in the foyer.
"What's the FBI doing here?" The startled rotund man in his 50s offers them some of his donuts anyway. Dean accepts and tells him why they're there.
"I know you made it very clear that this is your point of view, but sometimes I feel quite certain you're referring to it anyway."
When Castiel's put his hand on Sam's nape, his trembling grew visibly stronger.
"Why are you being like this?" Sam asks, quietly. "I know you're angry with me for messing up, but you can't think that this is helping?"
"Who is getting the kid's plate?" She pretended to look around.
"I know, I just thought-"
Dean shrugged. In moments like these, Castiel realized painfully that Dean was mortal and aging. His eyes looked as tired as if he hadn't slept in years.
Whatever Castiel had wanted to say, he never got to say it. Sam kissed him with such force and intensity as if he was fighting monsters. Castiel's eyes widened in surprise before he answered the kiss.
"So maybe the connection isn't her, but the place, that office."
The door to room 12 is unlocked. On one side of the room there's a wardrobe and a bookshelf, empty except for a pristine looking bible. On the other side, there's a hospital-like bed, the mattress stripped of any bedding.
She puts a hand through her short hair, and releases a soft sigh.
"Unless you were hoping for this, of course. You don’t even want to be on your own right now, do you? You prefer my company."
It’s difficult to get blood out from under the nails, even when they’re cut very short.
"What's on her birth certificate?" Dean repeated. "When you reported her, back when we decided it was safer, so we wouldn't all eventually be charged with kidnapping. I doubt you told them you gave birth to her."
"No, you're not."
With every "Mhm" and nod that Sam made, his face became a bit more serious.
She shrugged before trailing Castiel outside into the big city.
Saying goodbye to Jody half an hour later is uncomfortable. Dean tries to keep it quick. Thankfully, Jody doesn't offer any more wise words. She hugs him, thanks him for his help, tells him to mind the forecast and wishes him a good journey home.
"Yeah," Dean agrees. He sits down in one of the armchairs. "We've asked everyone I could think of, but maybe..."
"I know," Dean admits. This conversation has taken a weird turn and he's not sure how to feel about it. "I'm sorry. I'm just a bit testy. From everything."
"I'm just trying to help her! Get her prepared for the real world. And what are you talking about, I'm not making decisions for her. Like you and Sam don’t do that all the time. Do you think just because I don't share as much of my gene pool with her, I don't – what? Love her as much? That I don't care about what is going to happen to her?”
"My wife?"
"Sunday night. We found a really nice guesthouse and —"
They way Sam is standing next to the projector makes him look like an unruly child getting caught red-handed. The way he’s looking at him too.
Dean shrugged. He had hoped that Castiel would sit down next to him, but he remained leaning against the house. Dean stood up to embrace him. Castiel studied Dean with interest in his eyes, but he didn’t do anything for or against the touch. He just let it happen.
"Dad!" The shout came from Sam's room. "Dad! The documentary is over!"
It was merely excruciating pain they could give him. They would not kill him: they clearly needed him for something.
don't want to hunt anymore because
Dean had always claimed there was nothing there to smell.
"And I should bring Sam his water."
"How can you tell?" Castiel asks, sounding defeated. "If it's working or not?"
He turns his face away.
"You are right," Cas says from the back seat. "It really tastes like watered down coffee. I enjoy it nonetheless."
"What do you not want me to do?"
Dean grins. He hums along and then —just as Sam dreaded— starts singing along.
»Yeah?«
"God, Sam... You're so good at this."
"Water under the bridge," he said. "That was all years ago."
"So he’s just gonna be a totally different person?"
"Sorry," he mumbles, pulling his legs in quickly. He bumps against the metal feet of the table.
All he’d have needed to say was "Oh, no, he's actually my boyfriend". It would have been awkward for a second, and then it would have been fine. He'd be out there in the front seat of the Impala now, doing his goddamn job.
"I don't."
He walks for many miles until he sees the first car. He tries to get the driver to stop, waving frantically, but he passes him by. The car raises a cloud of dust that throws him into another fit of coughing.
“I shouldn't have asked you at all, I'm sorry."
"You know that is not the truth. You know my feelings for you."
"Yeah. It was just —I was thinking —I know we've talked about this before, but are you really sure it wouldn't maybe be a good idea to send Charlie to Kindergarten?”
"No one understands anyone perfectly. That's not how it's supposed to be."
"There's not really a protocol for this kind of shit. Most people don't have hallucinations of their actual time in hell and being tortured by the devil."
"It would distract me," Dean says. "Man, I'd just be worrying about you the whole time."
Next to him in the booth Castiel is reading a newspaper. He rustles the paper with a slight frown on his forehead. He has the stern concentration, rigid posture and old-fashionedness of a Victorian gentleman. Sam is only a little surprised that this is doing it for him.
Sam thinks of the way Castiel sounded when he asked about the hunter. Not just curious, but like it was really important to him to know. There are lots of good reasons for that.
"If we can make it."
Castiel's eyes follow Dean's hands as he starts unbuttoning Cas' shirt.

It is poignant and true.
But this, holding hands on a coffee run, you couldn’t explain that away by circumstances and external needs.
The Segaki went smoothly.
»He's avoiding you.«
Sam looks at Dean pleadingly. "Let’s just focus on the case, okay?" The fidgetiness from earlier has turned into something more desperate.
Dean suppressed the urge to just get up and leave for his room. He wasn’t sure how much longer he was going to keep up the happy facade. But he needn’t have worried because soon Sam announced that he was wiped and that he didn’t mean to be impolite, he just really needed some sleep.
He was confused for a second, until he remembered that Sam had cooked pasta for lunch today.
Dean's FBI suit is still damp from the rain the next morning. He dries it with the weak-ass blow dryer for a good ten minutes, but even then the cloth still feels sticky against his skin.
Dean's hands wandered under Castiel's trench coat and pushed it off his shoulders.
"Something else you need to get off your chest?"
Sam turned his head back to the window.
"Have you still not gotten it?" She shook her head. "You will never just be Jason Miller again."
"Why are you talking about traveling now? You're the one who never wants to even talk about going on trips."
Castiel wiped his hands on his shirt and let them fall at his side.
Sam had been lying awake in his bed for nearly an hour now.
Thankfully, the drive home is going to be a short one. It was one of these rare in-state cases, and they're slanted to arrive at the Bunker when it's still light outside. Maybe he can go for a run still. It tends to help with getting a clearer head. At the very least, planning to go on a run always feels like it's going to help in advance, unrelated to the actual outcome. Having completed a run feels good too.
"No idea." He sighed. "You can’t always tell just from looking at them."
After his post-run shower, he stands in front of the old-fashioned sink and squeezes his wet hair into a towel. He doesn't like hair dryers, has never trusted them, and avoids them even at times when Dean tells him to hurry the fuck up and get his ass out of the bathroom.
