He went to the kitchen, turning off the coffee machine, and poured the black liquid on his cup. Steve twitches his nose at the bitter taste of it. He usually splashes some milk on his coffee, but since they ran out of milk two days ago Steve hadn’t had the chance to go to the grocery store, and Bucky was way too busier than Steve. Steve prepared some scrambled eggs for him, again, Steve remembers he needs to do the grocery to get bacon. He makes a mental list to go get supplies as soon as he goes home.
"We're gonna need pasta for lunch," Steve says, taking a sip of his coffee. "And some sauce, too." He adds.
"It's just..." just what, Steve? He thinks to himself. "the government wouldn't accept it so easily, neither the U.S. Army, being a public figure, well, it's a shit."
“Hold on!” Someone shouted when the doors were almost closing, and Steve made the favor of putting the folder in his hands between the doors that quickly opened again.
Tony glances to Steve, he lifts a brow presumptuously, he starts to walk, getting closer to the warehouse, but Steve stops him, holding his arm.
Tony took a deep breath. He would come in and take Steve out with him to the safety of their apartment, although HYDRA agents already should know where they've been living the past two weeks. Tony turned around, decided to continue with his plan, well, he only had one plan, a pretty simple one matter-of-factly: Attack.
“Don’t hide, Steve. Don’t worry about it. Everyone’s here is very respectful,” Wanda assured him. “Also, their model number one is a bisexual involved in many scandals. Really. Don’t stress about it.”
Steve can't contain the groans of pain who come out of his mouth, and even though it disturbs Tony, he keeps cleaning the wound, he owes that to Steve, even if Steve keeps saying that is not his fault and he shouldn't apologize.
Tony reaches the knob, keeping the door open to Steve pass. They head together back to the apartment.
Natasha was a good person to work with. She was good at catching nice angles to empower the collection. The details seen by her eyes made a lot of difference during that afternoon, and Steve almost regretted that the red-haired wasn’t there for the lingerie photoshoot, it surely would have made an enormous difference. Not that Wanda wasn’t good, no at all. But Wanda was an intern, and Natasha had years of experience that showed the greatest differential during today’s photo session.
"You two finish the gauntlet as fast as possible. We'll find a way to bring everyone back by tomorrow."
Steve thrusts again, and this time the hand slide from his lower belly to his cock, Steve's thumb circle the head of his cock slowly, and Tony thrust in his hand, eager for friction, Steve is good with his hands, Tony knows it now, he attempts to thrust one more against his hand eager for the blond's touch. And Steve starts to pump his cock, the sensation of pleasure takes over Tony, and the brunet lets his head falls backward, his lips parted widely with the astonishing sensation.
Steve's eyes wide in shock and horror at the view of Tony covered in blood. He must have fallen, because Steve's arms are wrapped around him, sustaining the weight of his body. Steve lead him to the room sitting him on the bed, taking off his sweatshirt, in the next moment Tony feels his back against the headboard. Every feels blur, he want to succumb to the urgent need to sleep. Steve gets out of his camp of sight and then suddenly he appears again holding a first aid kit.
“I… I don’t know?” He knows he’s a bad liar. Bucky always tells him that. His indifferent pose doesn’t mean anything. However, since Steve knows Tony, the brunet has always been good at reading people around him.
“Do you have any questions, Steve?” Natasha asked. Steve looked down at the papers in his hands again.
When they finish it's Steve's turn to wash the dishes while Tony dries them and put it back in the cupboard. They always work in partners, always helping each other.
"The idea of me was." Tony is looking around, he seems clumsy, Steve never thought that one day he would think in Tony Stark as clumsy, in fact, he just seems out of his time.
“I know,” Steve mutters more to himself than to Natasha. The soldier opens his hand, looking at the memory card. He hands it out to Natasha. “The photos were taken before the incident are in there, in case you want to check them up.” The red-haired.
Tony looks back to the TV showing the ambiance that's when two workers caught his attention one of them puts his hand on his gun, but the other one puts his hand above the first stopping his for whatever he was thinking in doing.
So, when Tony pulled Steve to a kiss inside the elevator, Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s waist, pulling him even closer and deepening their kiss. They embrace in a hot, suggestive kiss. Steve’s hand runs under Tony’s shirt, caressing his back.
Steve looked down facing his shoes, he only heard Peggy's high heels approaching him, she took his chin in her hand and lifted it up so she could look straight into his eyes.
"He's not here." Steve started putting one his hand on his hips and looking to the brunet. Tony understood right away.
So, Steve paid for his products and the fuel and made his way back to the car. Tony was leaning against the vehicle, arms crossed over his chest.
He doesn’t even hesitate. He took off his clothes and got on his knees on the couch, bending over the back of the couch. He heard the sound of Steve undressing and going away to get the lube. He comes back soon. Steve put one of his hands on Bucky’s shoulder while the other hand gripped on his waist. Steve massaged his muscles there, caressing his neck and sending pleasure shivers all over Bucky’s body while he pressed his length between Bucky’s cheeks.
Not only Tony and Steve were missing. Clint also hasn't come back, he's gone for forever, sacrificed himself for that damn soul stone in Vormir, there is no going back for him, at least for Steve and Tony she could still have hope, she believes that they can find a way back somehow, after all, she couldn't lose them, too. She is already mourning Clint, she could not handle losing her two other friends. Right?
They exit the establishment. There was only a long road in front of them, the Army Base was not so far, but there was not a hotel to be seen.
"Don't. Don't come with this optimism." Tony answers taking out the fucking tie and throwing it nowhere to be seen.
Tony wakes up with the smell of fresh croissants. It smells marvelous. Steve must have asked for the hotel's breakfast, turns out, Tony has picked a decent hotel this time. No need for more creepy places, he has not sold one of his favorite watches for nothing.
Steve paces back and forth, looking at the skyscraper in front of him. He might have been pacing for half an hour now, and his nervousness didn’t get any better. He still had another half hour before finally had to come in. Natasha said in her e-mail that he should be there at 09:00 a.m. She had also added a list of documents that they would need to hire Steve, which the soldier had separated carefully, and even made photocopies in case they needed any.
“So are you enjoying the job so far?” Clint asked, pulling Steve out of his thoughts. The soldier blinked, then took the seat where Wanda was just a few minutes ago.
"Same. I'm glad," Steve shrugs, putting the coffee in front of Tony who pours some in a mug. It was strong, thick and bitter, just like Tony likes it, no sugar or sweetener. He took a sip, in the corner of his eyes he sees a sketch, he stretches his arm to reach it, putting the mug back on the counter to take a good look of the drawing.
The red-haired waited patiently as Steve read the contract with SHIELD Clothing. The soldier took a deep breath when he read the value of his salary. That was more than enough, and he thought he has never been so well paid before as a photographer. Not even right after his graduation when he worked in small agencies. Steve read every single clause of the contract, which might have taken him 15 or 20 minutes. Natasha was casually sanding her nails on the desk by the time he finished it.
Steve clenches his hands into fists, and he feels the empty glass of champagne break, pieces of glasses sticking on his palm before he puts the rest of it on the table next to him.
"Did you just swear, Rogers?" Tony lifts a brow and has a proud smile on his face, which makes Steve smile too before turns his gaze outside the window. "I got it, though, you deserve to have a life, a private one, being happy no matter who you love. You deserve it, Steve. It's not fair to let the authorities take this off you." Tony thighs his grip on the wheel, and tenses a bit.
"Are you okay?" The blond grunts. Tony just nods affirmatively, resting his head against the wall. Steve walks in his direction, turning Tony's face to analyze the scratch on his cheek, no need for stitches,
Tony dresses the clothes they have stolen from the Army's base laundromat again, the badge clipped on the lab coat says that he is Howard Potts, an engineer, physician, and professor from MIT. As to Steve, that is the first part of the plan, to get Steve in. Tony needs to steal a card from one of the securities guards, get a uniform from the staff room, and hand it to Steve from the back door. Once this is done, they would be able to circle in all offices and labs with the ID card from the security guard.
She goes away. Tony and Steve remain in silent. The snack bar is empty, except for them and a guy drinks his huge chocolate milkshake. The waitress comes back 10 minutes later, putting their milkshakes and cheese balls on the table. They don't say anything to each other.
The Alpha knows he's cornered, that there’s no way for him to run from Steve’s anger, and that’s exactly what Steve wants. Steve runs toward him mercilessly, punching the man on the nose and hearing the satisfying crack when it’s broken, and the man falls on the floor holding a bleeding nose, the fact that the man is not reacting doesn’t make Steve slow down. Steve seated on the man's chest punching his ugly face repeatedly making him losing a few teeth, well, he deserves it, he should’ve never tried to hurt Tony.
So, they talked about their lives, their childhood, the Avengers Initiative, but most of all, they cuddled. They still had a mission, take the Tesseract to 2023, but this break was precious and unique. That's something they have been needing for so long and they haven't realized. That was the universe's push to make Steve and Tony finally being together, all that they have been living since Steve kissed Tony was exquisite and breathtaking, they deserve that, they deserve to be happy. Even though Tony knew that happened these past five years was a big mess, and a lot of people were mourning for their loved ones, Tony forgets all the guilty and he was just being happy. Because for the first time since Afghanistan Steve made Tony realizes that he was worthy of happiness.
Someone was moving in his direction. He couldn’t tell who. His sight was blurred, not with tears he hoped, it was just a consequence of the shock. Steve blinked, trying to get his sight back to normal. His eyes watered with how hard he closed them. When Steve opens again, the man is crouching down in front of him, pulling away from the blond strands of hair sticking on his forehead.
The door opened and a man came in. He wears an elegant black suit, his hands are inside his pocket, but with Tony still wearing his glasses, he could see that this man did not carry any weapon with him.
The door opened, and a dark-haired man stepped inside carrying paper bags, apparently, their dinner in his left arm.
"I'm sorry for early." Tony furrowed, then a light of knowledge appeared in his eyes. "I shouldn't..." Steve starts to say.
He doesn't need to be numb. He needs to feel that pain, he needs to talk with Steve, to see things through his perspectives, only that way he could understand. He's worthy of happiness, he tries to remember himself. Tony took a deep breath. He would stay there and wait until the crowd fades. He would sit there and put himself together, and allow himself to feel.
He was calmer, his breath was almost regular even though the lump in his throat persisted. His head is still aching, he should go home and get some sleep, in the morning he would talk with Steve and fix it whatever he did wrong. So he thanked the bartender for letting him stay even if he hasn't drank anything, but looked pretty miserable.
Steve acquiesced gratefully. Then, he started to organize the equipment on the desk again. Taking the memory card out of the camera and keeping it safe to hand it over to Natasha before he got to lunch. Wanda had mentioned something about a Winter’s Collection that has been suspended too, and they had to get it half-done after lunch. She also said that Natasha would be there to assist them.
"You wouldn't see it." The billionaire replies, pushing away the sand with his foot, Steve hears a metallic sound. "Find it," Tony shouts.
Tony leaves. The hotel is not so far from their old rented apartment, but it keeps a safe distance since Hydra knew where they were. Tony knows that this is not the end of Hydra, in that warehouse, there were only a few soldiers and Pierce, Hydra is everywhere, there are plenty of them, but they'll keep themselves hidden in the Army and in SHIELD. Tony imagines that whoever is in charge now must not be happy about the damages that he and Steve caused, well, mostly him.
"You wanted to protect us, Tony. I couldn't see that at the time, but I see it now. I forgive you" Steve scoops Tony's face on his hands and places a gentle kiss on his forehead."I just hope you're able to forgive me, too"
"We need to go," Steve says from the doorway. Tony nods, holding the bomb safely inside of his jacket.
"Better put it in a bank. It's not a good idea to do a road trip with this amount of money." Tony says lifting the package. Steve agreed. "I see a bank down the street, I'm going there." Steve follows a few steps behind the brunet, then Tony turns around to face him making him stops. "You can stay here, see around the town, maybe. I won't take long." He assured. Steve hesitates at first, he didn't think it a good idea left Tony's alone, but maybe he was being too protective, so he just nods and Tony goes ahead without him.
She throws the mug in the sink and walk to the living room. It's weird that her last memory from this room was that she was agreeing with Tony for the accords, the Civil War wasn't exactly a happy memory, it was in this moment that everything seems to go to shit.
"I know. The bullet is out, and I heal fast, I'll be fine, Tony." Steve sighs. "I'm gonna need some stitches, though."
"I got it." He said showing the greenish envelope in his hand. Steve's gaze change between Tony's face and the envelope.
The man leans closer to Tony’s ear whispering something, then Tony smiles before nodding in agreement. Honestly, Steve hates Tony’s acting skills, he can be really convincing, actually almost as good as Natasha, the Russian spy of the team, she could quickly change her accent and adjust her corporal behavior to sound natural in any culture, any country. She fits everywhere.
"Me too." She tiptoes, a gentle smile on her face, and drops a kiss on the blond's left cheek. "Goodbye, Steve." She steps on the car, she doesn't glance back to him, and he watches the car disappears down in the road.
Though, no one in that enterprise knew that they'd been hanging out. Okay, maybe Natasha knew about it since she was Tony’s friend, one of the few friends he had, at least, that Steve knew. Tony talked about his best friend from MIT, Colonel James Rhodes, he remembers Tony telling him that they would get along very well. There was also Happy Hogan, his bodyguard and sometimes driver, and Pepper Potts, Tony’s assistant. James Rhodes, or as Tony liked to call him, Rhodey, was on a classified mission abroad, Tony expected him to be back by Christmas time.
The room gets silent when she finishes the letter. Each one of them try to hide their emotions, but they all look sad, they had ended up losing three friends, after all. At least, Steve and Tony had a life together, a calm, happy and delightful one, she expects.
"You could've said that we're friends, teammates, more like partners, actually," Steve says approaching Tony slowly.
Steve approaches to see what looks a door leading it to the underground, there's a device on it. Tony knelt typing a number code on it, there's a click coming from the door, and Tony pulls it up. Steve sees a stair leading below, Tony got in already going down.
Steve approaches his ear to the wall, trying to eavesdrop on any chattering, but is not much because the Alpha just offers another drink to Tony. Steve moves away, his hands clenching the elegant and classic iron bar on the hallway. Down the hall, Steve finds Natasha looking at him expectedly, awaiting orders, so Steve nods, indicating that they should get prepared, Clint nods from the other side, recovering his hidden bow and arrows from the vents.
When he didn't sign the Accords and protected a fugitive, even though Bucky was innocent, he broke so many laws, being qualified and chased as a criminal for the U.S Government. Two years in complete hell, he couldn't trust anyone, his home was taken from him, the home that Tony gave to him. Tony was taken from him, and it was all his fault. Tony bringing the subject up make Steve realized that the brunet may not forgive him completely, and God, it hurts, he had lost Tony so many times, he couldn't stand lose him one more.
Rhodey is the one that talks again, he looks sad, too, but there is also an understanding on his countenance, he was ready to fight and complete the task that Steve and Tony had left for them.
Tony can't think a moment where he took better care of himself than this one. He is eating at least two meals and a few snacks, breakfast is something holy for Steve since he does not leave Tony skips it, he is sleeping seven hours per night, which is a record for Tony Stark who never stops working and tinkering. And he is happy, like he never has been before. He is proud of himself.
Tony parks the car. They take the elevator up to the penthouse, and Steve has to admit that they can’t keep their hands to themselves.
"Yes, it was."Tony mumbles, hiding his face on Steve's arm, snuggling by his side, which Steve happily accepts while caressing his dark hair and dropping a smooth kiss on the top of it.
"You know, I said this to Peter." Steve frowns. "Spiderman, Peter Parker, the kid from Queens," Steve remembers the sixteen-year-old clumsy boy fighting in the airport, he didn't know how Tony knew the boy, but he didn't ask, it should be a story for another time. "And, then, he died when that fucking purple guy snapped, and I have to watch him turning in dust helpless on my arms. Far from home." Tony looks down to his hands and Steve squeezes his shoulder reassuringly. "Then, that day you came to my house and mentioned this crazy idea, and I only could think in Peter and how he deserves to have a future. A bright future." His voice failed and Tony's eyes watered.
“Huh-huh,” Bucky said, putting a fork full of macaroni in his mouth. “Humm… Peggy’s food is wonderful.” Steve smiled, putting macaroni and grilled vegetables on his plate.
“Dad was telling me how the Avengers won!” replied Morgan excited. She seems too agitated for someone who should be sleeping.
He left Tony sleeping, after everything the brunet went through these past days, he really deserved to get some rest, and now that the Tesseract was safe Steve felt more relaxed, Pym would be back in four days and then they would finally get home. Only a week had passed and a lot of things had changed, but Steve felt like Tony and him were together for longer, Steve still hasn't thought how he would tell the team about their relationship, though he still had a couple of days to think about it and talk with Tony.
He stood up, even though the soreness is still present. He puts on his boxers, and makes his way to the kitchen. The smell of coffee is intoxicating. In the kitchen, there was Steve, he had already showered and dressed. A pity, because Tony, would've loved showering with the blond, but now that they were together, yeah, Tony Stark was committed, opportunities will appear more often.
But he certainly remembers the day he woke up, at first he listened to voices around him, people talking, he recognized Steve’s and Pepper’s voice. He made an effort to open his eyes, to say something, to tell them that he was there, but his body didn’t respond. So he was there, he couldn’t move a single muscle, nor scream, nothing. It took a few hours for him to wake up fully, he blinked a few times while his eyes were adjusting to the light in the bedroom. He wanted to tell Steve and Pepper that he was there, he has been there for the last couple of hours, however, his voice didn’t come out. He was too weak for that.
“I’m coming up in five minutes,” replied Tony, but honestly he wanted to stay there with Steve, frozen in that moment, because it was so comfy.
Steve and Tony know very well that those are not the only agents inside here, and they could be running right to a trap, however, they did not have many options to consider.
Peggy got excited when asked if he could bring someone along for dinner. Of course, she knew who the person was. On the other hand, Bucky was curious. Steve hasn’t been at home often lately, so his best friend knew little about Tony, but that wasn’t a problem, they would have the time to get to know each other during dinner. Peggy loves to talk, so Steve was sure that she would be the one who speaks more at the table.
"One of them had a hippie beard." She says like she had just remembered. They head into the elevator, the guard starts talking over the walkie-talkie.
So, Tony starts to put their things inside a bag, which is not much, just their clothes, hygiene products, and Steve's sketchbook. That's when he remembers the floor plan of Pym Technologies that he had stolen a week ago, it is the only thing missing in the entire apartment.
She didn't take it seriously when she moved in, keeping only the necessary, some clothes, a few souvenirs from her sister, and hygiene materials. That's all. Then, after the snap, she stood in the compound more often and now she felt she was in home, matter-of-factly. The five years she spent here gave her enough time to redecorate it the way she wanted
Steve enters the office right behind her. Nothing had changed since the last time he came here. Natasha does not seem to be fond of decoration or personal items in her workplace, so there wasn’t much he could tell about the woman. The place was neutral, as neutral as her countenance when she pulled away from a few papers on her desk, sitting at its border.
"What? We just jumped all the steps and now you're asking me on a date?" Tony replies amused making Steve blushes successfully.
Tony blinks when reality hits him back. That memory, that specific memory was when he realizes that he, indeed, loved the blond super soldier, the man that he grew up listening about. What a coincidence! Life is
"Hum. My assistant is a little busy today with this lecture thing, but I can guide you around the labs. Then, Mr..." Hank glances at Steve badge, one that Tony had improvised. "Mr. Rogers can guide you to the other departments."
Tony is worried. Steve can see that clearly, a mix of emotions was stamped on the brunet's face. He is scared, he is lost. And Steve was feeling this way too, but he already has been through there, he knew he would adapt to the situation and he needed to help Tony to do that too.
Steve gets himself comfortable with Tony, who had just kicked out his shoes and was chilling on the couch as the episode played on TV. Tony snuggled close when Steve sat. The blond couldn’t help to wrap his face around the model’s shoulders, pulling him closer to place a gentle kiss on the top of his head. This only encourages Tony to put a kiss on Steve’s chin. He needs to shave soon, tonight, otherwise, he could already listen to Peggy's complaints about Steve’s appearance at the Thanksgiving dinner.
"You okay, kid?" He asks pointing the chin to the boy cornered, the sound of Steve's voice made the other three jump and quickly move to a safe distance from the boy who sighed relieved.
Steve thrusts once, sliding his hand to Tony’s hips to keep him steady as he thrusts over and over again, deeper, pistoning inside the tight hole. The coupling becoming a true mess of Steve’s grunts and Tony’s moans sounding loud into the room as they reach their peak, they surely can be heard from the outside, but Steve doesn’t give a damn, and neither does Tony.
"You like it rough, huh?" Steve hummed close to his ear, Tony can feel the warm breath sending shivers all over his body, he didn't even reply he's too caught with the amazing sex he's having now to bother it. It's insane what Steve is capable to do with him.
Steve sat close to Tony on that fancy couch as Tony asked Jarvis to put on the show Steve just mentioned. The soldier repeated it out loud, and the screen lit up with The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel's first episode. Steve went to get his camera and bag he had dropped in the kitchen when Tony tripped. Steve threw the bag over his shoulder. He was just passing next to the counter on his way back to the living room when he saw a few not open correspondences on it. Steve glanced at them longly, noticing the logo in the front of it.
Steve got a plastic bottle he had bought in the corner, taking a few gulps of the still cold water, he closes his eyes before throwing the rest of the content on his face, passing his fingers through his hair and the palm of his hand on his face, feeling the blond hair thick growing on his chin. He opens his eyes and jumps backward.
Steve had met Peggy yesterday, just because of it the soldier had been scattered the rest of the day.
"Honey, you know we can't." Tony turns his gaze to the crowd around them leaving the theaters, he's biting his bottom lip, a clear sign that it bothers him as much as it bothers Steve. "Same-sex relationships will only be allowed in 1976 in California."
“Shit,” Tony mumbled. “I’m okay,” he said, seeing Steve’s worried face. “It was just a long day, you know.” Steve nodded, still frightened by Tony’s almost fall. “I should leave the coffee for another time.” Steve couldn’t agree more.“Let’s watch this show,” Tony took a step forward, but his balance still seemed quite uncertain, so Steve just kept his hand next to Tony’s waist and walked closer to him.
Steve raises his hand to apply pressure on his shoulder where the bullet went through. Tony takes a step forward toward the supersoldier to check his injury, concerned. He feels his chest clenches with the sight and his breath becomes short and fast.
Tony looks at Steve, he opens his mouth to say something, anything, but nothing comes out, he just ignores the questions Steve had asked.
Steve didn’t let him complete the sentence. Instead, he leaned in and captured the lips of the short man. It doesn’t matter if people around them were looking at them. Oh my God. He was dating Tony Stark. Tony Stark of all people in this department.
There's bell sign, then the elevator doors open on the floor, Steve slides in followed by Hank and Tony.
"No. But it is probably the best chance we have to go back home sooner. Hank is going there when he comes back."
Tony did not have any idea how much time has passed, but he imagines it was hours when he recovers consciousness. His body and head were aching like hell and he tastes blood in his mouth. Memories of the day came up fast as he sat on the cold floor leaning on the wall. His hand goes to the back of his head, the place was sore but it wasn't bleeding any more.
"Okay. You're right. I'm freaking out." Tony turns around and then turns back to Steve. "We better find a place to eat, then."
He knew they needed to talk about what happened early in the alley, plus, Steve needed to know if Tony was really jealous of Peggy, or if it was only an imagination, his mind playing tricks with him. The blond had dozen of questions but he didn't know how to begin this conversation, after all, he didn't know if Tony really feels something from him beyond the teammate's affection. Steve was a mess when it comes to talking about his feeling, and maybe, right now he was overthinking.
"You weren't actually born here, right?" says Tony referring to the sign outside the base that says birthplace of Captain America.
Bucky had gotten over the moon when Steve told him the events of the night. How he had met Romanoff in an apparently random event he wasn’t even supposed to be. She said she sent him an e-mail, which he verified on his way back home. It was almost certain that the job would be his. Well, the job was his, in fact. Steve couldn’t believe in his luck, even with Bucky repeating ‘I told you so’ over and over again. Steve felt like he could punch the dark-haired for being annoying, but instead, he just laughed. Steve was extremely delighted with the outcomes of the day.
Steve repeats for the hundredth time since last night when they arrived at the hotel, this does not make Tony feels any better, it was him who made that bomb, all the deaths and injured's weight was on his back. He had broken a promise he has done to himself, and he was feeling the consequences of it. Tony passes his fingers through his hair.
Tony observed Steve and the way his eyes moved to the document. He is a strategist, Tony could even see the supersoldier's neurons working at lightning speed to get them in.
Steve wasn't surprised when Tony pulls some kind of tool out of his pocket and opened the door of the lab so effortlessly, that genius probably brought all his lab inside of his pockets, all those nanotech things were crazy, and Steve thought that he would never catch on it, no matter how many times Tony had explained to him how it works.
Tony got on his feet swiftly reaching a hand out to Steve that roll his eyes, taking it and intertwined their fingers following Tony's out of the roof. The sun was already high in the sky.
. And he should be sleeping now, but he couldn't because Captain America gave him a lot to think about in just two days since they got trapped in 1970. He didn't want to lay down and being kept awake by his thoughts or nightmares, he also felt so defenseless when he's lied, he could feel his breath getting irregular at just the thought of sleeping. Tony Stark is a mess. So, he better stay there on his feet, looking out the window to a sky full of stars, where he can name the constellations, and the fresh wind of summer blows on his face, messing his hair. The stars seem so bright from that hotel's window. He was glad that Steve suggested to make a stop, so they could get a proper shower and a comfy bed to sleep, well, it's not like Tony is going to sleep tonight, even though he's tired. the day was freak insane.
So, Steve rushed against the crowd direction, pushing people the way down to the bank. His heart pounding hard inside his chest,
He opens the front door feeling the warm air inside of the house wraps around him like a safety blanket. He puts the grocery on the kitchen’s counter and makes his way to the living room, the fireplace was still emanating a soft heat and the lonely flames were almost over. Steve sighs and he leans over the fireplace stirring the flames making them emit a more intense glow and light crackles. He stands up and his eyes fall over a picture above the fireplace, he takes the portrait cleaning the slight dust with his sleeve, that pic, ops, he should say that selfie was taken during his and Tony wedding, he had taken the picture himself because he was taller than Tony, so the brunette was right behind him making a funny grimace. That was definitely one of the happiest days of his life.
There is a loud noise when the door comes down, and Hydra agents come in. Steve reacts first. Damn those supersoldier reflexes! Tony fights back, always having FRIDAY assistance studying the enemies fighting patterns, but even with this, all his advanced technology, they are clearly outnumbered.
Steve does not even have the time to stop him before Tony steps in the middle of the corridor, all of the guns aiming at him. Suicidal tendencies, Steve has said once, huh?
"Pym Technologies." The brows only got more intense. "I woke up with this idea. If we're gonna steal the particles we have to know where they're hidden, right?" The blond apparently was not following his train of thought. "I got the floor plan of the building, so we can study a way into these secrets labs," Tony said taking the floor plan out of his lab coat and handing it to Steve who just smiles.
"I believe you, Steve. I'm sorry it happened to you." Steve nods. Then, Peggy points her chin toward the door, asking "Who is he? A time machine? That's unbelievable." She blinks impressed, and Steve smiles.
"Because..." Steve begins, then he sighs painfully. "Because you were in a relationship with Pepper. Then, when you broke up, Sokovia happened." It was curious how destiny was always fooling them, it seems like the whole universe was conspiring against them and any chance of them getting happy. "Also, you were a playboy, Tony, how was I supposed to know that you are bisexual?" Steve adds and Tony blushes, that's the second time Steve makes him blush in less than 24 hours, it should be some kind of record.
Steve thought with a silly and in love smile on his face. Tony's eyes found his and the brunet leans to kiss him.
Tony sits on the bed, too, in front of Steve, blood sample still rolling on his fingers, he reaches for the supersoldier's hand.
"Hum, I don't know. My taste isn't used to sweet food..." Steve doesn't finish the sentence, because Tony gasp exasperatedly cutting him off.
"Well, he didn't." She shrugs nonchalantly, accepting the beer and the sandwich that a guy, a boxer, offers to her.
“On your knees,” Steve whispered. That was an order and as a soldier, Bucky knew very well how to follow orders from his superiors.
Tony was leaned against the wall next to the door, the lab coat folded upon his left arm, and his glasses hanging from the collar of his shirt, a few bottoms opened now. The genius turns, he gave in, he's sick of hiding, so he directs a sadness look upon the couple.
He turned the keys in the knob, stepping into the apartment and being welcomed with a deadly silence. Bucky hadn’t come home yet, or maybe he went to Peggy’s. Steve didn’t get to know since his phone had been discharged in the middle of the day. Shit, he really needed a new phone, how can he work with this one during only half-day? Steve connected the phone to the charger and entered the kitchen. He sighed longly at the sight of the pans and plates building upon the sink since breakfast, he’s very aware that it’s his turn to clean them up. Then he opened the fridge, however, instead of cooking, he decided to take a slice from the cold pizza inside the box on the microwave.
“Okay, go to sleep, it’s late, we have a long day tomorrow,” Steve said leaning to kiss her forehead. “I love you.” he gets up and walks to the door waiting for Tony.
"I don't need one. It's summer." Steve excuses, but he catches the jacket when Tony throws it in his direction.
However, he didn’t understand why he was so nervous, though. Steve has always been a peaceful person, even in the field, and mostly in the field since his men’s lives depended on his decisions. But here he is. The Captain feared what expected him when he stepped in. Natasha seemed a good person, exigent and critical yes, and she seemed a good boss. Steve thought he would not have trouble working with the woman.
"You know you broke my heart, right?" Tony whispers. "When you run away. I mean you broke it figuratively and literally." A smile appears on his lips.
She keeps her green eyes fixed on him for a moment, she dodges it when she feels her eyes watery. She shrugs as an answer to Bruce's question.
"Not exactly." He answers, maybe a little too quickly. The doors open and the supersoldier turns to her. "Have a good day, agent..." he tries to read the name on her badge. "Agent Rose." Turn away, it just works to let the woman even more suspicious.
With a single punch from Steve, one of the agents falls unconscious on the floor. Tony kicks the agent in front of him, making him hit the wall with his back, the agent bounces unsteady he uses his hands to restore the balance, the object he was holding falls next to him, and Tony notices it is a syringe before the man tries to reach it Tony punches him on the jaw, the man grits his teeth angrily and rushes over Tony, pushing the brunet through a glass wall, pieces of glass flight everywhere when both Tony and the Hydra agent hit the floor.
"FRIDAY, look for fingerprints." Tony stands in front of the digicode while the AI reveals the numbers touched by Hank, probably earlier when Steve and Tony had seen him coming down on the cameras.
"What's wrong, Capsicle?" He raises his head to face Tony, the brunet's was pretty relaxed for someone who was attacked, anyway, he was talking about Tony, whose actions were incredibly unpredictable.
They talked for a few more minutes. Steve is unable to take his eyes off Tony, his protectiveness instincts are screaming at him, and Steve has to admit that he never felt so useless in a situation before. Then, the man held Tony’s left wrist and pulled him next to him. Steve straightens his body, watching carefully as their target pulls his Omega upstairs.
"What's so funny?" He asks twitching his nose, he doesn't look up at Natasha, he doesn't want to see her face mocking at him.
"What, Cap? I thought you trust me." The genius says. Steve sighed and let go of Tony. He approaches a nanotech device to the card reader beside the door and it opens. They got in the elevator.
“You know you just have to ask, right?” Bucky finally turned to look into those blue eyes, only to be welcomed with a smirk.
Did Steve want to? He looked to the man on the cover again only to realize he was already paying for the magazine. Steve wondered why the name of this man looked so damn familiar. Stark. He had heard it before Natasha or Pepper mentioned it. Perhaps, he had watched an interview with the model on the TV. Of course, if Tony was this famous he would appear on TV, also, Wanda had mentioned something about a model involved in scandals back then. Was it Tony? Steve thought he would figure it out when he read the magazine.
"Up for a morning sex, honey?" Tony says smirking, taking the sunglasses off, and putting it on the collar of his shirt, revealing the bruise still red next to his eye.
Steve grins while he drops one more kiss on Tony's forehead when the philanthropist closes his eyes to relax. Then, he turns to the bathroom, getting a washcloth to clean the cum and the rest of lube out of him, then gets another wet washcloth and walks towards the bed, where Tony is laying, tired of their recent activity.
Their ride downtown was strangely quiet, not that kind of uncomfortable silence, just the silence's type that they were trying to absorb everything that had just happened. Generally, the silence was broken by Steve and Peggy talking about their lives after the war and nowadays, Tony remained in silence for the most part of the path, occasionally answering some questions made by Peggy, who was being so gentle that he felt bad for being such an asshole with her. He shouldn't have poured his chagrin on her, it wasn't her fault that he was in love with Steve, and Steve loved her.
Steve had the TV on, even though he wasn't paying attention in the news, he was drawing again, the amazing sunrise that they had the pleasure to watch together yesterday, he wished he had a canvas to paint it, though he was sure he couldn't reproduce that stunning scene perfectly.
The place was empty, of course, it was still 5 a.m, Natasha knew that the other avengers wake up around 6 and 8 a.m, but she kind of expected to see Steve up, ready to go for a morning run, he wasn't there, he didn't have come back from yesterday time heist, neither him or Tony and no one knew why, not even Bruce had answers.
"We're gonna keep it safe. We'll leave the coordinates to the others, when they find it, they'll bring everyone back safely."
They were crossing the street now, the Army Base on the opposite side, when a car turned the corner at fast speed. Tony was too absent-minded to notice it. He probably would be hit and dead now if he hasn't felt someone pulling the lab coat he was wearing, he bumped his back against Steve's chest, the blond suddenly hit by an adrenaline spike, Steve crossed his arm in front of Tony, holding him tight against his own chest in a protective way, pulling him back to the sidewalk. The car kept his way down on the road, everything had happened so fast.
"Look who's talking!" Tony mumbles feeling Steve's lips curls upwards at the compliment between their kiss.
Bruce's eyes lay on her, watching and studying her. Natasha didn't blame him, of course, but she really want answers. She needs them. It takes one or two minutes to Bruce replies, he shrugs.
Tony feels a drop of water rolling down his spine slowly. His hair is wet and a mess right now, while he has his forehead leaned on the ceramic wall in front of him. He's gasping, and his body is half folded, his right-hand clenches in a fist when Steve thrusts deep inside him. He's gasping, too. Steve's fingers trailed a now yellow bruise on his lower back, a reminder of the first night they had sex. Steve leans and kisses it.
His hands are gentle, cleaning the brunet's stomach, then his inner tights and Steve's seed coming out of his ass.
Suddenly, the same woman who was with them in the elevator turns the corner accompanied by two other security agents.
“I guess we are going to see each other a lot since we work in the same department. It’s nice to meet you, Rogers,” Wanda smiled fondly. “Everyone is like a big family around here, so don’t worry. You’re gonna be okay,” Wanda patted him on the back.
Tony had mentioned that the head office was in Malibu since Tony is from there. In fact, he lived in California, although he was spending some time in New York to accomplish the photoshoots and the end of his contract with SHIELD Clothing, much to Steve’s dislike. He didn’t want Tony to go away, but he also could not ask him to stay.
"We will." Steve approaches and holds Tony arms squeezing it slightly. "We always do. This time is not gonna be different. We just need to wait till Pym comes back from the trip." Tony let out a sigh, Steve let go of him and Tony rubs his hand over his own chest, where the arc reactor used to be, a gesture that Steve had noticed a few times.
"The hot blond, guy?" Tony can't help but rolls his eyes, ignoring her compliments toward his boyfriend. He nods, agreeing that that is the one who is talking about.
“Me too,” replied Tony. “I’m sure she is happy for us wherever she is.” Steve is done with his tie and the brunet squeezes Steve hand slightly attempting to reassure him. The blond nods in agreement.
The super soldier didn't reply, instead, Steve walks there and throw a white buttoned shirt, a lab coat, and a tie to Tony, while he got himself an Army uniform, the traditional green khakis. Miraculously, the billionaire didn't complain at all, he just got the clothes and started to dress up. Steve turns his back and does the same, but he can feel Tony's gaze on his back and he can't hold his smile, even though he knows that the brunet can't see his face. In a matter-of-fact, the genius can't see a lot of him. He wishes Tony could see beyond, he wishes Tony could see Steve Rogers. The super soldier turns back.
The boy was right, he just needed to go ahead to find a glass blur door with the name of Hank Pym, CEO of Pym Technologies. A piece of cake!
It's a simple and silly plan, they both knew it is going to work, the main concern for them was dealing with Hydra, supposing that they would break in the building.
He seems familiar, Tony thought. His coat is too big for him, he looks nervous but at the same too agitated, the way he talks reminds him of Peter, the spiderboy. That's it. The boy looks like Peter. A pinch of pain crosses his chest. Peter that died in his arms.
Tony bites his bottom lip until his mouth tastes blood. A terrible habit of his when things don't go as planned and he feels like he should find a solution.
"You know if you tell me what we're looking for, we can find it faster," Steve says sitting on a rock while Tony was looking to the ground with the briefcase in his hand.
People were shouting orders outside, some of them were holding their flashlights looking for the attackers, the fire was spreading quickly and the wind direction wasn't helping to stop it.
"FRIDAY, Trace the call, will you?" Tony asks the AI that quickly agrees to her boss request. "They don't have this technology yet."
Tony gets up approaching the man while Steve finishes untying himself. The brunet puts his hand on the doctor's neck still feeling the pulsation under his fingers. Good, he's not dead, just unconscious. He lets out a sigh of relief.
"Someone once said that love is weakness, Mr. Stark. I saw that whoever said it wasn't wrong at all." He tsked.
Tony finds the blond's lips again, biting his bottom lip. He wanted it so bad, he's been craving for it for so long, having Steve like this, naked on top of him. Then, Steve's eyes mouth move, stopping above Tony's bulge. The blond strokes his cock and Tony's body shivers with lust, then he leans and kisses the bulge.
"What? I'm a traditional guy," Steve starts to say, but stops when he saw Tony lifts a brow. "Okay, maybe not much that much anymore, but I still care about these things." Tony sighs defeated, but in fact, he is loving it, he loved that Steve was old-fashioned. Also, that was Steve's way to redeem himself for yelling with Tony.
A cheerful song starts to play and Wanda joins Peter and Morgan on the dance floor, while Clint finds a quick excuse to leave the couple alone, in fact, he goes to help Bruce who was trying to stop Thor from drinking the whole beer of the wedding. Then, Steve turns to face Tony who was still holding the glass, Steve looks to it, but before he could even open his mouth, Tony frowned his brows and started to talk.
The blond watches him, his blue eyes taking a good look from Tony's behind, a provoking smirk on his face, the brunet was teasing and leading the soldier to the edge. Steve follows the brunet, locking the door. Tony was playing dirty with him, but thankfully in this game, two can play.
The rest of the day passed by fast. Wanda was right, the Winter’s Collection was immense, full of details that needed to be photographed, even though they spent the afternoon among makeup, change of clothes, and set arrangements, they haven’t done yet. Another would be needed to get everything ready before the edition process. Thankfully, Natasha was there monitoring and barking orders to the team, which relieved Wanda’s work, and helped Steve to be more active, and less shy around the others.
"It's beautiful." He mutters, more to himself than to Steve. He takes another sip and glances up to see Steve serving them. "I didn't know Captain America was an artist." Steve smiles shyly.
"Can you stop doing that, please?" He opens his eyes. "It's annoying." Tony stops and Steve can't deny that he was a little surprised, the billionaire didn't have the habit to follow orders.
They were genuinely happy. Tony couldn't stop smile at Steve who was blushing furiously, Tony didn't know that someone could get that red. They seem so intimate for a public space, but they didn't care about what the others would think, not tonight.
Steve took Wanda’s phone and saved his number. He looked down at his phone chiming in his jeans pocket when Wanda sent him the address. He really needed to get a new phone, maybe in a few weeks since now he had a job and he could possibly afford it.
That night, dinner was tasteless. Tony did not have an appetite after everything that had happened, Steve seems to feel the same, but he made sure that both of them were well fed and rested, they would need strength for tomorrow, since a fight against Hydra seems inevitable.
Steve stepped out of what might be the fourth, maybe the fifth, company he had left a CV that day. He just hoped that he got lucky in any of them because things are not easy since he came back home six months ago. Steve only expected that those brands would check his portfolio, then schedule a job interview. He really needed to find a job. The ones he has been doing, well, it’s not like working for a brand company, where he would have his money guarantee in case anything happened. No, he has been photographing local events, sometimes, a wedding or college graduation, that’s all, even though the money was good, it wasn’t enough for him to pay the rent, the endless bills, the food, and to keep insurance. Although Steve didn’t get sick easily anymore as he used to when he was a child, he still preferred to have insurance just in case, so he was thankful that being a veteran meant that medical care cost lower for soldiers. However, that’s how Steve’s life has been lately, ‘just in case’.
Behind Steve, Tony notices the two guys who were fighting Steve, one of them was unconscious and had a bleed nose, the other one was tied to a shelf with a black eyes, probably broken ribs.
"As you wish, sweetheart." Tony smiles with the pet name, then Steve takes his fingers out of him and Tony feels empty while he watches the blond pouring lube on his length.
"Anytime, you can always count on me." Steve looks deep in those brown eyes. Tony nods and lets go of his hand. Steve goes back to his side of the back, turning off the lamp by his side. Tony lays down and quickly falls asleep again. He doesn't move again, apparently in a peaceful and deep sleep, so Steve turns his back and closes the eyes.
“I hope she’s not giving you a hard time on your first day of work,” Carol said, smiling. “Do you want a drink?” The blonde woman pushed a menu filled with all sorts of drinking. Steve waved his hands, grimacing at the options.
The Captain increased the pace on Bucky’s cock, up and down incessantly, recklessly. Bucky gripped on the couch when he felt he is going to come. He almost didn’t have the time to warn Steve.
Tony was just tapping on the hologram that his phone projected when Steve traces slowly and carefully the hickey on the crock of his neck, the touch gave Tony goosebumps, and for a second he closed his eyes appreciating the touch.
Tony’s eyes sweep the crowd around them while the Alpha asks the bartender for another drink who quickly attends to the man's request. Tony’s eyes found Steve’s and locked on the blue ones for a while. However, Steve’s gaze is fixed on the Alpha leaned over the counter, both drinks in front of him, the hand slides into a pocket of his suit, and something is poured in one of the glasses that the Alpha categorically pushes in Tony’s direction.
Later that afternoon, they were in bed, they didn't feel like leaving the house today. Also, it wouldn't be necessary since they still had supplies, and Pym would be back in over a week now.
Steve turns his back looking for an empty room, he spots the next, the room was dark and it seems empty, without second-guessing, he slides in the room. He closes the door behind him and moves forward to the desk in the room, there was a notebook, some documents with SHIELD ensign, a couple of pens and a frame with a black and white picture of him, in the early forties when he got in the army, received the serum, and fought in the World War II. Steve frowned his brows and turned to look at the name on the office's door.
Tony was dragged out of his thoughts when he heard the bathroom lock switched off, revealing a supersoldier shirtless, exhibiting his amazing chest and muscles, wearing the military pants from yesterday with his blond gold hair wet, drops falling from his forehead.
"Well..." Tony faces him and Steve wasn't exactly prepared for what came out of his mouth next. "We're gonna steal a car." Steve was kind shock for this statement, that wasn't exactly his idea, in fact, he didn't have any idea of how they would get in California, but surely a robbery wasn't in his plans.
Anyway, Steve started to massage his foot, putting the exact strength to make it pleasurable. And, Bucky knew that massage always leads to sex. Steve seemed to enjoy it, even though the winter soldier had told his boyfriend a lot of times that if he just wanted to fuck, then he only needed to ask for it, but Steve liked to play, and massage is the blond’s favorite foreplay.
"Oh, really? As you said just minutes ago, no one has my expertise nor my technology. When your fucking system reboots I'll be already far from here. Now give me the damn keys!"
They take a shortcut back. Well, guess they are ordering takeout after all. Steve doesn't let go of Tony's hand all the way back, they shouldn't be holding hands in public, the tight grip on his hand showed that Steve was still mad, even though Tony didn't understand why or who. The blond keeps looking behind and Tony followed his gaze, no one was following them, at the corner of the street they heard the sirens when two police car passed through them going straight to the grocery store.
Steve should've remembered that Hydra had grown inside the Army after World War II, creating roots and growing along with SHIELD, always being a shadow, always crossing Steve's path and hurting the people he loved. Steve sighed frustrated and Tony stops tapping.
Steve got into the old building, the red brick ink was peeling. Steve wouldn’t be surprised if he heard that that building collapsed in the news. He just hoped he wasn’t there anymore. After all, since Steve’s mother died when he was eighteen, he moved in with Bucky, and maybe he got too comfortable to find a place of his own, instead, he stayed at Bucky’s place as long as possible, though Bucky had never complained about it. Plus, Bucky was buying his own house, which means he would leave soon, and Bucky’s place would turn into Steve’s place.
"No, I'm serious. Why are you fumbling on my things, Steve?" Steve cheeks reddened, and Tony is not sure if he is ashamed because he was caught or if he is angry for Tony hides something from him.
Steve chuckles, shooking his head while he leaves the bathroom to save his boyfriend before Tony sets fire in the building.
"Want a better version, Cap? Tell her your fucking extend version, then, it's not like we don't have anything to do today." He clenches his teeth. "You know what? Maybe, you want to stay here, right? You just found what you've been regretting these past 11 years. That's it. Go ahead, Captain America." Tony stands his hands up and turns on his heels leaving the place.
Steve missed training days in the Avengers' compound. He also missed the morning jogging with Sam, well not exactly with Sam because he is faster than him, so he always outruns him, though he enjoyed his company.
They got in the store where quickly a salesman comes to greet them and offer for help, in case, they needed it, wich Tony immediately thank and decline, turning to the closest clothing rail to check the clothes. God, Steve had just remembered that it would come from Tony's watch money and he hated the thought of Tony paying things all on his own.
Natasha looked at their hands, though she didn't say anything. She just shrugged in response to Wanda.
The billionaire gets the folder on the other side of his bed. Steve approaches curiously, sitting on the bed again.
Someone bumps onto him, passing to help the woman, and the amber liquid feels on his shirt, leaving a terrible smell that quickly makes him feels sick again. He blinks looking far too long to the wet shirt. He didn't want to feel pain anymore, but how the hell he'd know that he is alive? Pain reminds us that we're alive, that we still feel and it's okay to feel.
“It’s after midnight, which means today is the big day,” says Tony, smirking and looking to the blond’s swollen pink lips.
"Okay. It's just the threat is imminent..." Tony sighs. "and I feel I have to protect the one thing I can't live without, not anymore, and that's you."
"How do you think our teammates will react when we tell them about us?" Tony furrowed. He wasn't exactly expecting the question nor even thought about it really, but it would be fun to imagine their teammates' reactions.
“I’m not gonna clean it, that’s your fault, soldier,” the dark-haired stated, reaching out to get his shirt on the couch.
He could almost see Steve’s lopsided smirk with the soldier’s plea. But the Captain wasn’t a sadic, so the bottle lid flew somewhere as Steve poured the content on his fingers. Steve didn’t waste time, though. He spread Bucky’s cheeks and pressed a finger inside him. It’s only when Steve adds another finger that Bucky couldn’t help but arches his back.
“Baby, you had too much. If Steve doesn’t want it, let him alone,” Carol gave Steve a reassuring smile. Wanda didn’t mention it again.
“It is. One of the best brands, indeed. You’ll see,” Clint assured him, then took his phone out of the pocket and looked at the screen. “Sorry, I need to pick this one,” Clint said, standing up. Steve only nodded in understanding.
His tongue playing with Tony’s sensitive nipples, pulling out a moan from the needy Omega. He trailed his thumb on Tony’s bottom lip, letting out a groan of satisfaction when the Omega licks his thumb, and his hands fastly unbuttoned Steve’s shirt, throwing it on the floor next to the bed.
Steve didn’t have the intention of hearing the conversation between the red-haired and the blonde. But, well, Natasha’s office has thin walls that didn’t help to hide any sounds made from the inside, plus the half-opened door allowed any noise coming from the inside to be heard. Steve detected the sound of a chair racking on the floor as Pepper sat, he supposed.
"You should be resting, Tony." Steve replies turns his eyes back to the horizon, Tony stops beside him, then he sat cross-legged.
Steve looked around the room, there’s no blood on the carpet. Great. Then, his eyes fell over Thor and Bruce still in the room, obviously eyeing at them, but pretending they are not, at Tony who was half-naked in the room. That’s an outrage! A possessive and threatening growl came out of Steve’s throat.
Hank asks Tony about the project he is developing, he seems genuinely interested in Tony's idea about clean energy to the world and the benefits it can bring to the countryside and how it can have an impact on disadvantaged populations all around the globe. Steve remains silent all the way down, but Tony knows that the supersoldier is attentive to every person who comes in and out of the elevator.
Tony follows Steve, only stopping to get a candy bar in the middle of the aisle without the blond seeing it.
A woman laughing out loud calls his attention and he turns to see her sat on the floor, her high heels broken and her ankle twisted in a strange angle. The woman was laughing, drunk, the alcohol taking the pain away. He wanted it. He didn't want to feel pain anymore.
Then, the man shots. Tony uses the guy he's holding as a shield, blocking the bullet designed to him, and the bullet hit the man in the chest. The sound of the gunshot in the small establishment is loud and disturbing, echoing through the aisle and ricocheting in their ears. It's enough to make Steve turns in the direction of the sound and see the man Tony was holding falling on the ground.
They turn the corner, and Steve pulls him to an alley, Tony's back bumps against the brick wall, both of them were being consumed by the desire to touch each other. Steve smashed his lips against Tony's, the taste of the beer they had was still strong inside their mouths, their tongues intertwined in an eager kiss. Tony fists Steve's shirt pulling him closer to his body, the billionaire feels his cock gets hard under his pants. The proximity of them allows Tony to feel Steve bulge against his body. Steve's hands hold his hips with a steady grip while he peppers kisses on his neck, Tony bits Steve earlobe, the blond moans against his mouth before pulls himself back to catch his breath, Tony sees those beautiful blue eyes filled with lust.
"He's out of the country, that was Howard says. Apparently, he left two weeks ago. There's no way we're going back." Steve isn't scolding him, Tony knows, but he is still blaming himself. It's all his fault. "We both knew it could happen, Tony."
He's sitting on a wooden chair, his legs folded up on the bed where a sketchbook rests on his knee. He's biting the tip of the pencil when he glances up and his eyes find Tony's brown ones. A smile surges on his red and swollen lips. It's a magical view. Tony wishes that he could spend the rest of his life like that, waking up with Steve by his side while those eyes look at him full of awe and love.
The elevator emitted a bell sign again and the door opened to reveal a corridor filled with several labs well-equipped, any project could be developed in here, and they definitely had the best technology of the seventies.
But now, they could change it. He could bring Peter and the others back. He has a mission and he has to accomplish it. He has to take those rare particles and takes the space stone back. He can do it. For Peter. For all of the people who had lost their loved ones in the snap.
“I wish she was here.” Steve sighed. Tony knows exactly who he is talking about. The crew doesn’t seem the same without her here. She was the glue who kept everyone together. If she was there, it would be here celebrating the ceremony. She probably would be the happiest person in the party, besides the couple.
Tony slides a hand inside his pocket to feel the four particles, they weren't broken, at least not yet. He sighs, and he is not sure if it is because he is relieved, although there is nothing to be relieved, or if it is just because he is tired. Deep down inside him, he's done with fighting.
He missed Clint always complaining about something or someone, and Bruce pacing back and forth in the middle of no matter room, until Steve asks him 'what the hell he was doing in the kitchen or in the gym room', while he mumbles something to himself. And Natasha eating a peanut sandwich while sat on the kitchen counter after a hard afternoon of training or shot practice.
"I'm okay." Tony stands finally upright. "No more runs, please." He inhales the maritime breeze deeply. "Geez, Steve! I can't keep your pace. I'm getting old." He finishes, panting.
Steve puts Tony gently on the bed, crawling over him, taking the brunet's shirt off revealing his chest and the scars where the arc reactor used to be, he didn't care about it, instead he kisses Tony's chest, dropping kisses on the scars until his tongue found a nipple licking it. Tony arches his back in pleasure.
Steve steps in the corridor, pulling Tony again when the bullets fly in their direction, seconds before the bomb explodes, setting the whole corridor on fire. Steve leans on the wall, panting. Tony raises his gaze to see the blond's shirt bloodied.
“Huh. Steve Rogers,” he replied. He observed as she tapped and searched for something on the computer in front of her. Then, she opened a smile.
He turns left, hoping that he was following the right direction, since when he came in he was unconscious, he was not sure about any direction he was taking.
"Okay, then. Let's do it." Tony says getting on his feet. Steve attempts to hug him, but Tony steps back swiftly. "Ah-ah, you're all sweaty, and I just took a shower." He complains, even though his hand is on the blond's chest.
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean those words, it's just-" Steve sighs defeated. "I just hate seeing you in danger."
"Steve," the brunet sounded serious, and Steve felt a cold passing through his spine. "I guess I'm being followed." The Captain stood up at once.
"You're ready?" He asks putting the low-pulled cap and mirrored sunglasses he had just found. Tony nods, takes his own clothes, and hides it, so when they finally get the tesseract and the Pym particles they could get their clothes back and go back to 2023.
“Well, yes, if I can get Tony to get his ass here in time,” Natasha leaned back, sighing loudly. “God, this boxers’ collection is waiting for too long now,” She thought out loud. “Anyway, we have a few pictures to take some unfinished projects from the former photographer to finish. Don’t worry about it, I’ll get Tony back,” Natasha assured him, and Steve acquiesced. “Alright. Let’s get to work then, Cap.”
Tony looks at Steve who keeps his blue eyes shut, grimacing because of the car balance. He does not ask if Steve is okay, he is clearly not okay. He got shot, for God's sake!
“I’m so glad you came, Tony. I’m pleased to meet you,” Peggy said, sitting on the couch, pulling Tony with her.
On the other hand, Tony had a bad feeling inside him, all the cells in his body screaming to the danger he was put himself in. Despite all the weaponry, the place does not seem active or with enough people to deal with an attack. Perhaps, they were not waiting for Tony to attack? Come on, that is HYDRA, they are merciless.
Steve was aware of Tony's body lying by his side. It was comforting to have a known face when he seemed so lost in this brand new world, in 1970, which remembers him of how lost he had felt when he woke up in 2011. At least, now he has Tony here, even if only as a friend.
Twenty minutes later, he's sitting on the bed again, dressed in warm clothes, even though his body is shivering and his teeth are clenching. Steve's hands are soft when he puts a bandage over his scratched forehead. There's not much that the blond can do for his black eye and the dark purple bruises on his back and ribs. Tony watches him attentively, Steve hadn't said anything beyond his name since he got home. He finishes with Tony's injuries, putting everything back to the first aid kit, his hands fall on his laps and Steve looks at them for what seems a long time before his blue eyes look up to Tony's brown ones.
Tony slams the door of the apartment, going straightly to the owner's house, when he knocks it is her niece who comes to the door, Tony throws to her a sour smile remembering that she has a crush on his boyfriend, however, she calls her aunt very quickly. The owner shows herself sad when Tony gives back the keys, and thanks her for the short accommodation and he bids her goodbye and leaves. It will be better for everyone.
