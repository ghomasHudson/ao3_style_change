The rotors had hardly stopped turning when they were already hopping out (that Dean breathed easily for the first time since they’d taken off was his business only) and starting for the nearest car.
“You know him how?” Dean asked, more exasperated than anything. Of course Cas knows the King of the fucking Crossroads. Why wouldn’t he? He tutored a reaper and heard voices.
His husband proved himself to be his usual sneaky self. To his credit, he did eat a bite of his French toast and was almost successful at hiding his grimace. Dean finished off his breakfast fast, ready to down his coffee and that was when Cas swapped their plates with a motion much too elegant and agile for him. When Dean arched a brow in question, he just looked at the toast and then back up at Dean.
“I won’t.” Someone shouted in the background. “Have to go, Claire needs help with her homework.” His voice got a little softer. “Thank you, Dean.”
“I have a condition,” Cas interrupted him. “I had a strange headache yesterday and other symptoms and we don’t know what it means. It’s nothing bad, I feel fine, but we have to get more information.”
“We’re not here for the Winchesters,” she said and it sounded like a reprimand. “The Omega already has the seal of Hell on his soul. They’re not our problems.” She looked back at Cas with a somewhat soft expression. “I’m sorry.”
“Yes, Jack and Claire,” Cas kicked him under the table, his smile that of a proud dad. “They’re wonderful. Right, Dean?”
“Alright, let’s go, idjits,” Bobby gruffed out. He seemed pale as they helped him into the back, Rowena waiting with a first-aid kit. Sam took the front seat.
“They’ve got Castiel,” she said immediately. Dean almost turned back. Rowena grabbed his arm. “You’re no good to him dead.”
“Then my death was like, thirty years ago!” he yelled at Cas. “I’ve been here for thirty fucking years and you didn’t even think about popping in?”
“You’re awesome,” he breathed out when he had enough brain cells working again. His hand was clean with a thought and he combed his fingers through Cas’ hair in a soothing motion. His angel hummed against his skin from where he was draped over him and smoothed his knuckles down Dean’s pectorals and back up his side.
He spotted an empty booth and decided on that. Private enough to not let their conversation be heard by anyone near, but directly across the bar. Dean hoped that if anything happened, someone would notice it.
“Faith, mostly.” Cas smiled ruefully. “Imagine Heaven like a big, international company. There are different branches, each with thousands of employees. God’s the CEO you never see because He has the money to stay home and do nothing. You only know He exists at all because the company wears His name and He’s the answer your superiors give you when you ask them anything you find ambiguous.”
“Heard about it,” Crowley had that irritatingly smug smile on his face that always made Dean want to punch him. “The Winchesters are in trouble.”
“Cas, I’m not dressed,” he gestured at his pajama pants and shirt. He didn’t even have his robe on, for fuck’s sake.
The rest of the ride was spent mostly in silence. Dean tried to call Sam just to check up on him, but his brother didn’t pick up. They hadn’t spoken in almost a week, just the rare text here and there. Dean had a hunch that Sam was up to something but he couldn’t guess what that something could be. The midnight calls about and to Cas had completely dried up and that meant that Sam had found something more interesting than an angelic brother-in-law. At least Dean hoped it would be a girl and not something potentially more dangerous.
“Oh, Dean,” Victor stopped him before he could sit behind the wheel. “Next time you talk to Sam, tell him to pick up the freakin’ phone, okay?”
“Yes. Like when you hear a hunting owl or tires when you hit the break except… louder and constant and… I could understand it.” Dean just gaped silently. “It was like a thousand voices screaming at each other inside my head and then it just… went silent.”
Before he could’ve gotten further, he noticed it. The wound didn’t bleed. No, it was glowing, like someone had put a damn flashlight under the skin. Cas didn’t even twitch as the edges pulled themselves back together. The gash disappeared like it had never been there, not leaving even a drop of blood behind.
“Hi,” Jimmy nodded, looking Dean over with a familiar pair of scrutinizing eyes. His voice wasn’t as rough and deep as Cas’ either. “Why do you always go for the outside, Cassie? Some people have nice personalities, you know.”
It didn’t take another fifteen minutes before they were ready to go. The Impala was parked before the garage so that made it necessary to interact with their neighbors who were leaving for work at the same time.
They couldn’t delay leaving after that. Garth and Bess’ house was a little way up the street from theirs, so it was only a short walk there. The sun was going down, the heat of the day turning bearable.
The words didn’t even register at first. Because it was impossible and he certainly didn’t deserve them. Cas surely couldn’t mean –
He hesitated in front of the nightstand. The drawers of a guy’s nightstand were a pretty intimate place. But it could be full of important things, too. On top of it lay a black paperback, a bookmark stuck in the middle of it. Its spine simply said Supernatural. Maybe it was a mistake, but Dean left the drawers alone.
“You too,” Cas shrugged. He was gorgeous, the street light hitting his profile just right. Dean tried to drink in the sight without Cas noticing it.
The hunter’s walls had already crumbled to dust a while ago and the thought, “I wanna kiss you,” slipped out before he could do anything against it. Cas’ nod was quick and came without hesitation and even though Dean was technically dead, he felt his heart hammering in his chest.
The preparation was quick but thorough, Cas pressing little teasing kisses on his cock as Dean took his fingers, soon three of them. They occasionally pressed against his prostate, making him choke on some really embarrassing sounds. Cas was looking at him with rapt attention and that just made Dean’s blush deepen. He was really glad for the semi-darkness.
“Oak’s the symbol of strength, leadership and knowledge, sometimes resistance.” Cas looked at the screen thoughtfully. “Some cultures consider it the tree of life.”
Dean carefully rolled onto his back, arm at his side and Cas was straddling him almost immediately, the light coming from the bathroom surrounding him in a warm light.
Cas gave him a questioning look but his face cleared in understanding when the screen changed from P3 to B1. Dean heard a muttered, “Damn spies,” coming from him.
He hadn’t sensed any movement so he glanced up. Cas looked him over with a familiar expression that made Dean shiver.
They had been passive-aggressive with each other since then, Cas letting Dean handle most of their interactions. It was the best outcome because Cas could be really mean if he wanted to be.
“I have to get back for that a bit,” he admitted. “Angels are the most powerful beings in existence – beside God or Death, of course. If you see an angel in their true form, you perish just from the sight. You go deaf from their voice.”
Sam must have read something on his face, because he asked, “It was more?” carefully, voice less hard.
“Maybe there are records for this. They didn’t need to know it was an actual angel falling to notice a shooting star.”
“Three years ago I’ve been sent to Iraq for months,” he started what he was sure Cas wanted to ask about but never would. He was too considerate for that. “Sam got a partner, Ruby. They worked great together at first from what I heard. They were having an affair – she got into Sam’s head and the kid fell for it.” His hand curled into a fist. “She wasn’t dirty, no. But some people up the chain wanted to experiment. They arranged a fake kidnapping and got Sam hooked to a new drug called Demon Blood, which is basically LSD on Speed. Ruby ‘found’ him and kept him provided with the stuff because she was nice like that. Played him, tested how long Sam can go without it, experimented with the doses.” Dean sighed. “When I was back, Sam kept it from me and I knew something wasn’t right, but I didn’t find out anything until it was too late. Sam and Ruby were on a mission in Beirut and Sam OD’ed. He killed a bunch of civilians and almost sent a building flying. I was sent in to diffuse the situation.” Dean paused to finish off his beer. “I killed Ruby, took Sam to a hospital. Both of us retired quickly and quietly after that. Since then he’s been…” he made a probably incomprehensible gesture with his hand.
“Claire’s trying to seem like she doesn’t care about her studies but she’s got a steady 3.8 average,” Dean grinned proudly.
“That’s why I want them to suffer,” a male one growled but there wasn’t much force behind it. Beta. “We’ll kill them slowly for what they did.”
Dean was driving the limo, Sam and Bobby in the back. Cas and Rowena were going in through the woods surrounding the house.
It took a couple agonizing hours where Dean tried to occupy himself with tinkering around the house (the vacuum cleaner had been tricky to fix) but well after they hung up the phone with Jack and Claire, Bobby was ready to put an old tome in front of Cas before putting his empty plate in the sink.
“Sweetheart, you blew up the lights the last time,” Dean put the cover on the dresser and crossed his arms.
That was a good incentive, Dean had to admit. He was the kind of guy who could be persuaded with food and Cas knew it.
It had been like that since Gordon had moved here over two years ago and Dean had been the first one who’d met him. It had been fine up until Gordon realized he was talking to one part of the token gay couple in the street (which was ridiculous, they were both bi), when Cas had come out of the house to ask something. Gordon hadn’t made a sound when Dean had introduced them but his expression had told them everything.
He was on the ground with the guy on top of him, the impact forcing all air from his lungs. Fortunately, Sam took up the speaking where it was left off, the holy water making his demons backing up, shrieking in pain. The air was heavy with sulfur.
So Dean wanted to argue, but he noticed how the air had thickened and it seemed to crack with electricity. His eyes jumped to Cas who straightened in his chair and his shoulders shifted the way they did every time just before his wings materialized. Dean couldn’t see his eyes but he would bet they were a shade brighter already.
Claire stayed, her arms crossed almost defensively over her chest, the frown she learned from Cas appearing between her brows. Her eyes were shining with concern she was trying to hide.
“We won’t lie, we promise that,” he locked eyes with both of them. “But we may keep secrets for a while to keep you both safe.”
Darkness was creeping up on him and Cas’ face came into focus for a single moment, eyes determined and hurt and why would anyone hurt Cas? Cas was perfect. Even his face glowed in an ethereal light.
Instead of answering, Charlie grabbed her girlfriend’s hand and weaved her other arm around Dean’s, pulling both of them at the little restaurant next to the parking lot.
Claire did that, too, and Dean heard her muttering an almost shy – as shy as she ever got – “I’m sorry,” into Cas’ shoulder.
Cas glanced down at the blade with the same small, amused smirk but his eyes when he looked back up at Dean were all warmth. Dean didn’t know if he was seeing it because he wasn’t oblivious to it anymore or because Cas didn’t have anything left to hide.
It was maybe around ten that he decided to find something else to do. There was a clear sky outside so he went for a little stargazing, perching on the sturdy, old picnic table at the corner of the parking lot. He’d always liked just watching the stars. That was something he and Sam had done a lot in the past.
Dean was just a little stressed about that, since the first and last time John and Cas had been in the same room the angel had decked John with a perfect right hook, which would’ve broken a living human’s neck with the force put into it. Dean hadn’t known if he should’ve laughed or cried at it. He’d kind of expected it, anyway, Cas had never had a good opinion on the oldest Winchester and had never tried to hide it.
They were getting well into the second hour when Cas’ phone started ringing and he took a look at the screen. Dean saw Gabe’s name flashing on it.
“I’ll pack up till then,” Cas opened the door but instead of getting out he put a hand on Sam’s shoulder. “Thank you, Sam. Truly.”
She looked ordinary, or at least not like an all-powerful, millennia old creature. She was wearing a form-fitting gray business suit, her hair long and dark brown, pulled into a ponytail, her fringe covering her forehead. She was probably in her forties, her light blue eyes looking at Cas with a surprisingly soft expression.
The smell of rotten eggs slapped him in the face and almost made him cough. They were in a long, dark hallway, with only one door in sight at the very end of it.
So when Cas asked Ellen after a bit more of Heaven-talk if he could have a word with her privately and Ellen’s face lit up with wary hope, he didn’t pry and let Cas go with a parting kiss to his cheek. His angel would tell him what this was about. Not that Dean couldn’t guess.
“Okay,” he said when he realized his situation. He was glowering at the three of them, probably a little pissed-off, but he seemed relatively calm. “Who are you guys?”
“I can see most supernatural beings’ true faces,” the professor said. “I also hear voices that I don’t exactly know the origins of. Actually, I spent months in an asylum because of it.”
“You, too, Dean,” the impossible guy smirked back at him, his gaze lingering on Cas for a moment before he winked at Dean suggestively. Dean smacked his chest before turning around and marching out, Cas falling in step behind him as they walked out of the safe, through the office and to the elevator.
“And I would’ve waited for you. Hell, I probably would’ve gone with you, Dean. We should’ve talked about it like adults, not you assuming things and choosing for me because you thought you knew better.” He looked up at the sky in sheer exasperation, taking his previous position at the edge of the table. Dean was a little offended. “I knew you were a stubborn ass with poor communication skills, but that’s just plain stupidity.”
He went through the kitchen to the living room and found the slide door to the backyard open. He stepped outside and the sight made him stop dead in his tracks. Sam almost tripped over him.
They rolled into Sioux Falls around three. Being back here always made Dean smile. How many summers had he spent here just strolling the streets with Sammy or disappearing under the hood of one of the cars in Bobby’s garage, either helping him or later doing it by himself? Or when he had dragged Cas with them after being together for almost a year and sneaking away every chance they’d got to find the most random car and make out in the backseat.
Dean looked at Cas if he was sure he was comfortable with being alone with Sam and he nodded seriously.
“We’re gonna have to find somebody to plug this leak,” Bobby shook his head as Cas passed him more gauze.
“I’ll message through Charlie when I’m safe,” Gabe nodded, clapping Cas’ shoulder when they took a step back. “I’m taking this seriously now, little bro, don’t worry.” He shot a look at Dean and the intensity of it was the same as Cas’ murder glare. “If he’s harmed, hope you’re already dead.”
“I love you,” Cas murmured into his neck, nuzzling into the skin there. He sounded content and sated.
“It’s friggin’ hot here,” she complained. “Why did I think it was a good idea to move to California?”
“See, Cas agrees with me,” Dean gave his brother a cocky smirk and promptly tripped on a root sticking out of the ground. He had just enough balance not to fall over. “Shit!”
“Don’t worry, beloved,” Cas probably rolled his eyes at him fondly now and leaned over to kiss his cheek. “I’m okay.”
“Dean!” Cas was in the driver’s seat, making a kind of urgent motion with his hand. Dean was in the car in moments. The door was hardly closed behind him when Cas was already flooring it.
“And where did you learn to fight like that?” Sam was asking real relevant questions. Dean liked that when it wasn’t directed at him.
“I don’t want to.” For the first time there was feeling in Cas’ tone. Distress. His breathing stuttered lightly, hand twitching.
So it was kind of shitty to wake up around two in the morning by the binging danger-radar in his head. Something wasn’t right.
“Because you hate snow,” Dorothy quipped from behind her. She’d lost her usual jacket somewhere, too.
As soon as the door of the passenger side closed behind Dean, Charlie pressed on the gas and they lurched forward.
She seemed like she saw through him anyway, her eyes narrowing into the same squinty glare Dean had had decades to get used to so he was almost completely unaffected. Then she turned back to Cas.
“Long day,” Dean waved his hand dismissively. He would handle Cas. He looked around to see of anyone was in hearing distance before continuing. “The morning we had the FBI over.”
“Come on!” Claire crossed her arms over her chest with a scowl. Dean knew she’d learned that from him. The defiant tilt of her head was all Cas, though. “We had it under control.”
“Cas, this is Rowena,” Bobby introduced her. “Best wet work asset in the business. And a true artist with an RPN.”
The stress of the day was slowly leaving Dean and when Cas finally pulled back he was almost cross-eyed from the whole thing.
“Lilith told me you had promise,” Roman told him as Victor neared Dean and cuffed his hands behind his back, Bela following and using him as a living shield. “So this is how it goes. Winchester just shot the V.P. You kill him and his boyfriend, and you’re head of the CIA.”
“Sam?” Dean asked, just as the bomb exploded. He could see the smoke at the end of the corridor in seconds.
“Out and proud lesbian,” Charlie grinned. “My girlfriend, Dorothy and I are trying out this whole white picket fence thing.”
The Alpha didn’t seem to like that much. He was probably one of those bigoted knotheads who didn’t like when an Omega said no to them. Playing nice and charming until they met the first resistance.
“Great,” Dean smiled honestly for the first time in four days. He knew Henriksen was as honorable as someone in their profession could be. “Then let’s talk business. The Vice President had ordered these hits you were doing to cover up the war crimes she committed in Guatemala.”
“Hmm,” he said after the pair went quiet. “I’m gonna tell you something I never planned. But you can’t look at the world the same way after this anyway and I think you need to learn this.” He took a deep breath. “The thing you’ve said about that article, Cas? You’re right. Missing hearts are pointing to werewolf.” Another pause. “Those creatures you read about in fantasy novels or see in horror movies? Most of them are out there.”
Here Cas asked how could anyone even turn into an angel in the first place and why had it happened now. Lily admitted she had no real data for that because it never happened the same way. She knew of maybe a dozen angels all over the planet of the probably hundreds or thousands. Some changed as early as their teens, others not until they were way into their fifties – her husband had been just over twenty. The only things that seemed to match were the angelic names (which were more and more common these days) and the way there were no blood-families. The origin of the species was still a mystery.
Waiting for his call to get forwarded was always the most stressing part. Would they still connect to the right line? What if Cas wasn’t in today? Technically, he could just hang up and call back another day but that would make him initiate plan B, and he liked his well-tried system, thank you very much: calling every other Wednesday to talk to Cas as much as he could, then wait another two weeks for the next call.
“Yes, it was a very unprofessional job,” Dean agreed. “But me and my partner decided to take another look.”
“I know you’re suffering from cabin fever,” Cas stepped up to him and took his hands, entwining their fingers. “But I’d like to wear my coat tonight. It makes me feel safer.”
“I don’t know what she wants yet, so I indulge her. I plan on capturing and interrogating her soon,” he announced like it was nothing.
“I wouldn’t have,” Cas huffed indignantly. Dean knew he wanted to cross his arms, too, but that just would’ve proved Dean right.
“We should start to plan,” Sam stood up to put his plate in the sink. “How’re we gonna get close to Roman?”
“Sure,” he sighed. Dorothy nodded at him gratefully. Dean nodded back, then extracted himself from Charlie’s grip and with a last, tired smile shot in their direction, he walked (limped) across the street.
“Condom?” he looked up at Cas who meanwhile repositioned himself to the middle of the bed. He was all stretched out on the sheets, looking at Dean with half-lidded eyes and stroking himself lazily. Dean’s mouth went dry then watered quickly at the sight.
“Good. Now you can perch on my shoulder all the time,” Dean grinned before clearing his throat. “I mean, if you still want that.”
Cas pushed them up with his wings enough to get them out from under himself and turned them over without pulling away, many years of routine making it easy to pour lube on his fingers and kissing Dean stupid at the same time.
He woke from a restless sleep by strong arms pulling him close and a familiar body pressing against his back.
They stayed like that for a while, looking up at the stars and the Omega remembered that Cas liked to observe them, too. He always did it with an almost wistful expression on his face, like he wanted to get closer, like he was missing something he knew was up there. That look was present now, too.
He gestured at Sam to pull him up and they were standing on the closed-off roof a couple seconds later.
“Babe, we can deal with this like we’ve done every time with Claire,” he said after another three rounds.
And now he was using the puppy eyes. Crap, he sucked. The worst thing was though, that Cas was maybe the only one who could actually do help him. The guy was like a walking encyclopedia on the darkest kind of monsters. That was why John had sought him out in the first place. He was a specialist.
“That’s just the tip of the iceberg,” Sam continued, unbothered. “None of them knows anything about their families, they were all in the foster system or adopted.”
“You’ve been living in Santa Clarita longer than us,” she started. “You noticed anything weird with our neighbors in the last month or so?”
There was nothing but a row of number written into the left corner, no address or other message. It had been probably put in his mother’s mailbox by Kevin himself.
“You’re right,” Sam sighed, drumming his fingers on the dashboard. He was nervous and with reason. “We’ve got work to do.”
“Of course you were,” he said and covered his face with his palm in annoyance. “Just my luck. You have to be a damn spy.”
“It’ll be alright, Dean.” Cas looked at him with a frown. “We’ve talked about it. As Sam advised, we should stick to the truth as much as we can.”
“It does,” he agreed and opened the door, his gaze not stopping on Dean but not avoiding him either. “Try to rest. We have strenuous days ahead of us.”
“God,” he murmured as he led Cas to the bed, following him onto it. Cas’ fingers tightened in his hair when he leaned down for another long kiss, the grip just shy of painful and he moaned at the sensation. Fuck, he was so hard and he felt Cas’ erection pressing into his hip. The pain of his wound was aching more with every second but he didn’t want to break away from Cas.
“Cas, if it’s anyone’s place, it’s yours,” he sighed because he'd fucked Cas over enough and the Alpha deserved to know. Not that this made it easier to talk about it.
“You mean in the middle of the night without a word and texting me back not to bother you ever again after you got enough of me calling a hundred times because I thought something took you?” he asked in the most deadpan voice and Jesus, Dean hadn’t even thought about it like that before. Not then and not since. Of course Cas had had that impression. He’d woken up and the Omega was just gone, not answering his calls. Of fucking course. Dean was such an insensitive asshole.
“The wall thing?” Cas repeated incredulously. “That’s what we calling it? You could’ve died, Dean, bash your head in! I was terrified!” He took a deep breath and slowly let it out, his voice turning to steel. “I’m not losing you. I’m not.”
Bobby had stayed in Sioux Falls, waving them off with Cas’ freshly painted wardings on his walls and windows. It’d taken them all night and morning to get to Crossville, Cas’ Lincoln staying safe in the yard.
“Well, I don’t think I’m considered human anymore,” Cas said bluntly, the wings fluttering behind him as if confirming that theory.
He was babbling and he couldn’t stop. He was so close, he wanted to come so badly, he just needed that little push…
“You didn’t get the check again, did you?” Cas sighed, but it was a fond kind of sigh like Dean was a troublemaker cat which was too cute to really get scolded.
In the study Sam was leaning over a book, Bobby sipping a glass of whisky. Dean walked over to the bottle to pour himself a double and while he was at it, an inch for Cas, too.
“Good luck with that,” Dean chuckled, then felt is heartbeat quickening again. He took a deep breath. “So I, uh, I’m in Indianapolis for a couple days next week.”
Dean waited until the day before the mission to make the call. The others were ready to move, this was just the last step before starting the mission. It had been four days since Chicago.
“Should I undress you, too, while I’m at it?” he asked cheekily, seeing that Cas hadn’t moved a muscle.
They took up a steady rhythm, gazes boring into the other’s, and Dean tried to keep them open, pleasure making it hard to hold eye contact. Their bodies were moving against each other, sweat easing the way. Labored breathing and the slap of skin-on-skin were providing a constant background noise to the grunting and moaning and whispering of the other’s name that filled the room.
“But that’s it,” Sam interrupted. He seemed really excited as he pushed away their beer bottles to put the thing before Dean. “This Castiel’s not –”
“We’re going to shower, then we’re continuing this in a bed,” Cas told him, his voice full of promise.
He clearly remembered that when they had first started dating Cas had never bitched about Dean winking at a pretty waitress or bending a little too low on the pool table when he’d tried to hustle someone. He had always looked on with something like faint amusement dancing in his eyes and sipping his beer and waiting for Dean to saunter back to him and kiss him senseless. He had known that it hadn’t meant anything.
“Our children are present through the history of humanity. You think the ancient texts are describing another Castiel? No, that was you, every time. Angels, as mankind calls them, are powerful, yes, but they only live as long as any human. They live too long, they get estranged, lose their love for them. So they have to be born again.”
Cas had explained clearly that angels didn’t feel the urge to touch and be touched and that was mostly true for him, too – the exceptions were Dean and Jack. As always, it seemed. He felt affection and was ready to reciprocate such gestures anytime for Sam, for Charlie, for all their friends, but Dean was the only one he wanted to be around constantly and missed every moment they weren’t by each other’s side. That was completely okay by Dean even if he’d been beat red by the end of this confession. They were pretty good at the communicating stuff, actually, now that they were doing it properly.
Well, the gun wouldn’t be of much use and he couldn’t keep the demon bound. He was screwed either way.
Dean broke the kiss to lick his palm because not like they needed lube in Heaven. Cas used this to let his lips wander down to Dean’s neck and start sucking and biting on his pulse point, leaving a nasty bruise and Dean relished in it, momentarily forgetting what he was about to do.
“She deserves to know,” Cas nodded and sat down beside him. Dean didn’t really understand the reasoning, but Cas said it was a civilian thing and that Dean was too antisocial compared even to him in these cases, only charming when he had to be. He might had been right. “What about Crowley and Rowena?”
The only warning was the faint rustle of a brush and a glint of yellow eyes before the thing was on them. It was a female, probably an Alpha by her scent and the size of her incisors. She was faster than Dean expected, the first bullet only grazing her arm and it only made her angrier.
“Same team took him out who appeared at my house,” Dean explained. “He was onto something, we just need to find out what.”
” Charlie told them, breaking the moment. It might had been intentional, with the cameras and all. And she was right. Making out right now was probably not the best idea. “
“Time’s up. We need to go,” he jumped up from his seat, automatically grabbing Cas’ elbow to pull him up and towards the back. He trusted Sam to bring Gabriel but he shouldn’t have worried, because Gabe’d passed him in a jog, leading them into a hallway just as the gunfire picked up. They heard the screams and shouts as the four of them ran by doors, the back exit already in sight. It would be risky, but that was their best shot.
“I know, but… you said you wanna do it,” Dean said with a full mouth Cas was much too used to complain about. “And we could be over another scary and probably dangerous experience and I don’t need you to knock me out because I’m too stressed to sleep.”
Cas probably didn’t need to hear Dean’s exact thoughts but he could guess. The hunter’s less than stellar care-and-share skills had made sure of his own reading abilities. He was quiet for a long time, just looking and Dean couldn’t even assume what he was feeling.
“You think I might be one of those?” Cas asked, a hint of apprehension in his voice. Dean took his hand and shot a sharp look in Bobby’s direction. If he wanted to hurt Cas they’d have a problem.
He slid down until he was kneeling between Dean’s legs. He looked good there, Dean really wouldn’t have minded if he stayed there for an indefinite amount of time.
“When you were doing that upside-down shooting move he looked like he wanted to eat you – which is disgusting, by the way,” he added hurriedly. “Also, notice how he sticks around?”
The woman with the rusty crowbar – didn’t look like a djinn and hella sure wasn’t a ghost either – charged again and Dean ducked with a shout. He’d lost the shotgun but he grabbed the silver knife from his belt quickly, slashing out with less grace than he wanted to. He got her arm but it didn’t seem to deter her. It seemed to just make her angry, her rotted teeth getting replaced by sharp, needle-like fangs.
“My mate, Michael, couldn’t come right now. He’s a little more… hands-on, if it comes to it. I prefer to stay in the background, myself. But both of us follow our children’s lives and answer to their calls, even if it hasn’t happened in the last three hundred years.”
“We should take a shower,” Cas murmured and Dean would later deny how his breath stuttered a bit at that.
“It’s unique,” she put it into her waistband, away from Sam’s prying eyes and walked a little closer.
“Hey, Charlie,” Cas grinned fondly and that was enough to make Dean’s stomach churn with a feeling he hadn’t felt since high school – jealousy. Which wasn’t fair in the slightest, Cas had a life of his own, connections stronger than what he had with Dean now. They’d only met a couple days ago, for fuck’s sake.
“Ah,” Dean leaned against the edge of the desk next to him. It was not the first time they were called into the school for a talk. “What’s Claire done now?”
Cas leaned in again and pressed the softest of kisses on Dean’s still tingling lips, thumb sliding over a freckled cheek.
“How the hell do you know that?” he asked, feeling a little violated and scared. If Charlie knew about that, what did she know about Cas?
“Thanks, Ash,” Dean squeezed his shoulder. He was pretty sure he was seeing him for the last time. “You take good care of yourself, okay?”
“The entire back half of the Guatemala file has been blacked out,” Bobby started as soon as he was finished, looking through the pages again. “But there’s a list. Eleven names. Plus one that’s been redacted.”
Then he slowly lifted his hand and his eyes brightened with the same ethereal blue-white light his cut had shone with. Dean saw the self-satisfied smirk melting off Dick’s face, turning into absolute horror, but it was already too late.
“Wow, you seem really busy,” Dean spoke up. Following Cas’ eyes, Eileen looked at him like he’d just caught her cheating her diet or something (which wasn’t probable, Sam was the health-freak in the family), then shot a look at Cas and started signing rapidly. Dean could make out the words
“Heaven is whatever you want it to be,” he shrugged, the gesture more human than ever before. Dean hurried up his steps.
The pillow under his head felt fluffy and soft, the memory foam cushioning him the way it used to at the Bunker. Faint sunlight shone through his eyelids and the air was warm even where he wasn’t covered by silky sheets.
Cas was sitting in a row somewhere in the middle, Dean would’ve recognized that mess of hair anytime. He walked up to the Alpha and slid in the pew behind him. Cas’ head turned a fraction of a second from the altar but otherwise didn’t acknowledge the Omega’s presence.
“Not my fault you’re better with your hands,” Cas shrugged innocently as Baby came to a stop in front of the old house.
“Did you lose your damn mind?!” Cas growled and he was on his feet now, his scent filling with that dangerous, storm-like electricity. “How long do you have?”
Cas was already waiting in the passenger seat, Miracle laying calmly in the back. She looked ready to sleep.
Huh. So her rebellious daughter turned polite and his well-mannered son got into a fight. Dean’s life was getting even weirder than it already had been.
After Gabe assured the security that there was no need to throw everyone out, they found a booth as far away from anyone as possible, Gabe and Cas on one side, the Winchesters on the other.
Cas stood on the side, looking like always – looking alive – except for maybe the black trench coat that fit him way better than the previous ones and a matching tie instead of the usual blue. He was hot. And Dean did the first thing that'd come to mind.
Dean’s phone pinged with a message half an hour into their drive. Typical Sam, he had been almost asleep, just blinking at Cas sleepily, head leaned against the window.
The inside of the house looked pretty much the same. Old books all around, but otherwise everything in its place. The living room Bobby used as his study was just as inviting as before, at least to Dean. He remembered shared nights with popcorn, trash movies and arguing about snacks.
Bobby was already waiting for them. They told him everything they’d known so far and the Beta didn’t even twitch a brow. No, instead he and Cas bonded over a book the Alpha had spotted as soon as he stepped into the study. It was as good a pastime as any while they waited for Jimmy and the psychic chic.
Sam sighed theatrically, head tipped back and everything, before putting the file to the side and opening the book. It looked older than anything Dean had seen at Bobby’s and that really said something.
It took a moment to adjust, but then he started to grind his hips down to test the waters and Cas’ grip tightened around his waist.
“You asked Dad?” he swallowed thickly. John had never said anything to him. He had looked suspicious of Dean’s behavior for the first week or so, but never tried to talk to him beside telling him to pull himself together after his son’s third bender in as many days.
Dean wasn’t a hacker, but he knew enough that the system of the General Services Administration, which fortunately wasn’t the Fort Knox, didn’t cause him much trouble.
They checked if any of the bodies was still alive, but no dice. They had only spent an hour or so in the glade but half of that time was spent getting branches for a big enough pyre.
Cas’ fist closed around him, jacking him off with quick, tight strokes and he was slamming into Dean with almost punishing speed. His scent sharpened, his knot teasing the Omega’s rim with every movement.
“Gonna make a couple calls,” he put those aside and picked up the old-fashioned phone from his desk.
He still counted on a good twelve hours before a unit would be sent out. It gave him some time to sleep and eat something. He still set up a constant surveillance on the block, just to be sure.
“You’re right. I’m sorry,” he leaned his head on Dean’s shoulder. “We’re not hunters. I should just ask Bobby to send someone over. Or you could tell Charlie about it.”
“I’m yours, Cas,” he nuzzled into the Alpha’s stubbled cheek and the sentence was way easier to say than he had expected. It was true anyway.
“Wow, the priorities!” she mocked him. Dean shot her a look that made her back off a little. “I’m happy for him, really, it’s awesome that he can just
They were maybe ten minutes in and Dean was seriously considering calling an ambulance when Cas finally sagged against him, his muscles unclenching all at once like his strings were cut, taking large, heaving breaths.
The knowledge that he could see Cas in the shower, wet and very, very naked in, say, five minutes was a very strong incentive.
“Please don’t talk about Rowena,” Dean grimaced but he immediately forgot everything else when Cas sat back down on him and rubbed their cocks together, making sparks dance behind Dean’s eyelids and giving a groan that almost sounded like a growl.
bursting out from thin air, huge and otherworldly and growing out straight from Cas’ back. The view was frightening and Dean almost fell to his knees from it.
“Alright,” Dean stood up. “I would love to get some actual sleep in here but I think we should move our asses. Cas, where’s Gabe now?”
Dean didn’t like this teaming up thing, but he guessed the two of them hadn’t really had the opportunity to bond outside of Heaven and couldn’t deny that them liking each other was kinda cool – not for him and Sam, apparently, but in general.
“They’re the ingredients for an angel summoning ritual,” he relented in the end. “It’s the safest way. I could pray to him, I guess, but he could easily ignore me and I’m not sure it would be safe. Others could listen in on that.”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas pressed in for a deep, heavy kiss. Dean’s mind fogged up immediately, almost making him forget his plan.
“Good for you,” Dean nodded, Charlie’s happy demeanor making him smile despite his exhaustion. “Sorry we missed the party. And I’m not devastated, I’m just tired. God, so tired,” he massaged the bridge of his nose.
“Sorry about that,” Dean winced, taking a gulp. He was pretty sure that if he told Bobby that Cas had used the same mojo on him he had on Roman to cure his hangover, it wouldn’t go down well. “We talked, so I’m good now.” He swallowed the first spoonful before admitting, “Well, not good, but less like a non-functioning alcoholic.”
The card worked and then he was out, shots ricocheting just over his head. He stopped for a long moment before he opened the next door, trying to get his shit together. He needed to get to Cas. What was his next move again? Oh, yeah, fire alarm.
“How do you want to do this?” Cas panted above him, his hips making these little twitchy movements that were driving Dean insane. He grabbed Cas’ waist to still him so he could focus on thinking about the question. Cas looked really good on top of him and Dean could imagine him riding Dean with abandon. It was an awesome picture in his mind.
Dean moved. He grabbed the closest gun, emptied the magazine and dropped the bullets into a clean pan, then turned on the stove. The second wave wouldn’t come so quietly. He needed to get out of here.
When Cas flew home around four, Dean was in the kitchen, putting the already prepared dinner in the fridge.
“You talked to him yet?” the Omega had to ask. If it was about Sam, he would be out of his mind with worry.
“Castiel,” the demon didn’t flash the red of his eyes. It wasn’t exactly necessary, Dean knew, but it surprised him. These fuckers liked to show off. “Been a long time. How’ve you been?”
So no, Dean wasn’t really surprised by his reaction to learn about his parents. The flying out had still been overdramatic, but that was just Cas.
He knew he was swearing up and down like a sailor but fuck it. Cas was pulling an orgasm out of him in record time, his eyes glinting and hair a mess from Dean’s touch and he looked so sexy Dean’s breath stuck in his lungs for a couple moments. Cas played with his balls and then his fingers drifted lower – careful still, like always, no matter the rush – and circled around his hole. A strategical suck on the head and a thumb pushing in to the first knuckle was all Dean needed to come. His vision whited out and a silent scream left his throat and Cas was swallowing around him and it was so, so good he wanted to cry.
“You’ve had that tattoo since before we met,” he looked at the tan, inked skin on Cas’ ribs and licked his lips. It was not his fault it was so sexy.
Dean wouldn’t have minded if they stayed that way for a while but there were things to do and he pulled away reluctantly. He threw in a wink and a charming smile before getting out of the office and into the garage.
“You two?” the demon looked them over skeptically. “Maybe for that famous Colt I could give you another year.”
He drove Baby carefully but with skill and Dean needed to concentrate on getting them out of town without being seen, not salivating over the guy.
“Nah, meeting’s adjourned until tomorrow,” Dean smiled a little. “I think they were even happy with the interruption, so they could go to bed.”
Dean was more than happy to follow him. Sharing pie with some of his favorite people sounded amazing.
Cas was already halfway to him before Dean could blink and he only caught the sleeve of Cas’ coat as he swirled after him. His panicking brain sped up and came up with the only thing that could probably snap the prof out of it.
“Claire said something she probably didn’t mean to. Kaia connected the dots but she only arrived after us.”
He was three fingers in and now hitting Cas’ prostate with every other thrust when Cas started cursing, eyes squeezed shut.
The only interesting thing he found was the garment bag hanging next to the shirts in the wardrobe, otherwise the apartment was excruciatingly ordinary. He still had time so he slipped back into the bedroom, his curiosity finally, finally getting the better of him.
“Yes,” Cas nodded. “She doesn’t know it was me and she shouldn’t find out – I don’t even think they were important to her. So I asked her to make a deal with me.”
“So this is even over your paygrade,” Dean nodded mostly to himself. Crowley lived on information. If he didn’t know what the fuck was going on, nobody did.
“One would think you’d be more forthcoming since you’re the one who got me into something I have no clue about,” Cas pointed a fry at him accusingly before biting it in half.
“No, you didn’t, at least I hope so,” Cas corrected her hurriedly, then turned back to Sam. “Legal issues aside, what else did you find, Sam?”
He hadn’t been asleep for long when he woke to gentle, closed-mouthed kisses on his jaw and neck and a hand wandering up his back.
It took a minute until they were both aware enough to move. Cas pressed a light kiss on Dean’s lips before slowly pulling out and rolling onto his back beside him.
“Lunch tomorrow, Sammy,” Dean patted his shoulder. He would check on his brother tomorrow. Now he would hopefully be a little busy for a heart-to-heart.
Cas’ answer was simple enough. He wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck and pulled him in for a searing kiss that took his breath away.
Cas lifted their clasped hands and pressed a gentle kiss to Dean’s knuckles. Relief flooded the hunter. If Cas could do this, wanted to do this, he was mostly still the same.
” came Sam’s voice a couple seconds later and it was followed by another round of shots. Dean sat up straight because they were supposedly done with the shooting.
Roman was the last to get out of the car, dressed in an elegant black suit. Another goon joined him.
He pressed a last, lingering kiss on Dean’s lips before walking out the door to put together some lunch for the kids before he left.
An undeterminable time later he woke to a pounding head and a cotton-filled mouth. He groaned pitifully.
There was a solid crowd and Dean spotted some familiar faces from other times he’d been here – the guy he’d beat at pool two weeks ago, the waitress who’d flirted with Cas, or the man in the expensive suit who always came here after work before going home to his wife and three kids (he was very loud about his domestic problems, too). This made Dean calm down a bit. If the place would’ve been full of strangers, that would’ve made him more cautious.
The rest of the night was spent in an awfully familiar way, the conversation flowing easily between the four of them. (Dean sent a text to Claire and Jack so as not to worry them longer than necessary.) The only difference from previous get-togethers were that now they spoke without any important secrets between them and Dean could finally truly relax in their company. It was easily one of the best night-outs he’d had in a while.
Cas’ expression was mirroring his own terror, but then he was already running towards the door not far from them. There were the typical sounds of a fight going on, and Dean hardly realized they were in the library not far from the kids’ school as he was in the room full of metal shelves and boxes filled with books, probably the storage.
“I don’t know,” Cas huffed in frustration. “It’s just what came to mind. But werewolves are not a farfetched thought in our situation. There could be a bunch of mythological creatures out there without us realizing it. I am not human, we know that already, so maybe –”
They had stopped for breakfast in Iowa. By that time Cas’ coat, suit jacket and tie was in the backseat, the sleeves of his shirt rolled up to his elbows, the top two buttons open. It had been a very distracting sight and Dean had had to force himself to look at the road straight ahead, especially after Cas had fallen asleep around one a.m. to the low hum of the radio.
“Listen, Cas, you ever try something like that again, I’m gonna kill you myself before anyone else has the chance. You can’t just confess things like that to a guy in five minutes and then die immediately after. That’s a jackass move.”
“Actually, yeah,” Sam nodded and put his computer on the book but at Bobby’s narrowed eyes decided to lift it instead. The screen showed the homepage of the Catoosa WMA. “In spring some tourists found a clearing that wasn’t there before with a hundred-year-old oak in the middle. It’s weird, because that area is populated almost entirely by pine.”
“This way,” Dean tossed him his bag and lead them through the parking lot of a theatre center, then into another alley. Cas kept up with his steady jog easily, but they’d slowed down when they arrived at the open street. He could already hear the sirens in the distance. He could also see the Impala’s front.
Dean took Claire in his arms and let Cas take Jack, and they put them in their respective beds. The last time he’d tucked in either of them had been probably five years ago, and Claire still looked young as she laid there, features slack and peaceful.
“Nah,” Dean gave him another thorough kiss before lowering himself to his knees. “I guess I just have to take the edge off.”
Dean was lost in sensation. He felt dizzy. Cas was everywhere around him, in him, and his heart was going to give out from feeling so much for one man.
He released Dean’s hand and walked up to the tree, mindful of the big roots under his feet. He stood there for a long moment, searching for something Dean couldn’t guess. When he finally pressed his palm against the mossy bark, Dean expected… something. Maybe a bright light or a choir singing. But nothing happened.
“Wanna go for a walk?” Dean asked Cas, his hand once again clasping the angel’s. He’d never been much for hand holding or casual PDA while he had been alive but he was almost addicted to the feeling of Cas’ palm pressed against his own.
The lasagna was still in the oven but the table was already set. They waited by talking about everything that came to mind and after three minutes got stuck on Star Wars.
“Actually, I may have something,” he pulled out his phone, twirling it between his fingers. It was a surprisingly elegant and fluid movement – and now was not the time to think about the guy’s capable hands. “But I need you to trust me with it.”
“They’re hunters, are you sure it’s safe to keep them alive, Ainsley?” Dean could hear the worry in her voice. “If they’re dead then just more will take their place.”
He didn’t have more time to think about some miraculous plan, because a fancy black car just stopped before them. Sam was already pointing his gun at the black-clad driver as he got out of the car.
“Hi, Charlie,” he huffed out with a grin. She picked out a soda and drank half of it in one go. “Thirsty?”
He stood before the door of 3B with Sam next to him and doing everything to not make his nerves showing. If he knocked and some pretty Omega opened the door with a pup on their arms, he wouldn’t be able to handle that.
He grabbed an old envelope from a drawer and a knife from the counter, working quickly, efficiently and cleanly. Then he changed out of his pajamas, pulling on jeans, a black undershirt and a dark green flannel. At the door, still open, he shrugged on his favorite leather jacket that was miraculously unscathed, putting on his boots last. Then he grabbed his bag and walked out. None of his neighbors dared to peek out yet and the police wouldn’t come either. His estimate was a good half an hour head start. It was more than enough.
“Yes. I was close enough to touch her briefly and heal her just enough to keep her alive until they got her into surgery. I couldn’t do more in such a short time.”
“Took a page out of your book,” Balthazar shrugged. “Faked my own death. I love this freedom thing.” He slowly shook his head. “You’re not meant for humanity, Cas. Even if I can understand the appeal,” he glanced at Dean with a leer that earned him a scowl. “Swallow the grace, grab the Omega for the time he has and you can join me later.”
eased with the three rounds of spectacular sex last night and he was really glad for that. But he still felt on edge, his thoughts all over the place and he found himself leaning against a tire, sipping a bottle of water and absently turning a wrench between his fingers.
“Huh,” Dean said. They had suspected it but it was good to have solid evidence that they’re safe at the moment.
It took a couple uncoordinated movements to turn on his side but Dean managed it, resting his head on Cas’ arm and relishing in the warmth of his skin.
He almost fell over, but then Cas was there, catching him and lowering him to the floor, grace already healing whatever injury Dean had.
“Yes,” Cas confirmed with a nod. “His father’s ring was burned and his spirit’s now here. As the last prophet of the Lord, I welcomed him myself.”
Cas was the one to pull away and he chuckled when Dean tried to chase his lips. It was the definition of fond, and Dean couldn’t even bother to be embarrassed about it. Cas’ eyes were bluer than the sea just a couple yards away from them, his face shining with something that Dean had only seen once but now his gaze wasn’t clouded by tears.
“I hadn’t seen it before, but your soul is the most beautiful I’ve ever laid my eyes on. If we weren’t romantically involved, I would come back just to bask in its light.” He tilted his head in thought, letting Dean blush in peace. “And as if Jimmy wouldn’t kill me if I just disappeared.”
“Oh, sunshine, you’re pretty good with your hands, believe me,” Dean winked at him and opened the door. God, it was good to be here after two whole days spent in the car. He wasn’t young enough to not feel it anymore.
“This way!” Gabe opened a door just on their left, which led to a kind of storage room. There was an iron ladder in the back of it, probably leading to the roof, closed with a metal lid.
A young guy wearing a red sports jacket had just cornered Jack and Claire, and Dean saw a faintly familiar face and blonde curls disappearing out the back door – he barely recognized her as Harper, the girl Jack had protected some time ago.
“I think I can do it. Burn all of him, I mean,” Cas stood up. He seemed to be back mostly to himself and Dean was infinitely grateful for that practical side showing up again.
“What the hell is that?” Dean asked. The blade looked like a run-of-the-mill hunting knife with a curved, serrated edge and as the blood dripped off of it he could make out strange symbols engraved in the metal.
“So you called them and they just told you everything?” Jack frowned, hands clasped together on top of the table.
John had handled it well, all in all. Dean had hardly recognized him when he’d simply gotten on his feet and muttered a “You must be the angel then.” Mary had taken it upon herself to explain that Bobby and she had already been through with John about a couple things concerning his treatment of his own sons. (“Told me about your guardian angel, too. Guessed he’d be protective.”)
“We have to get out of here,” Sam sounded a little winded, his gaze jumping between the edge of the roof and the lid of the ladder.
Dean knew they wouldn’t get any sleep until him and Cas were home safe and sound. The waiting would be enough punishment for them.
Dean hadn’t had a good spar in years and the adrenaline coursing through him was exhilarating and he kind of needed it. He’d trained with Sam almost his whole life and he could predict his brother’s moves blindly. But fighting with someone for the first time was unfamiliar and dangerous, the uncertainty giving it an edge, making it exciting.
Dean let himself be pulled in, dread clogging his throat, and Cas flew them out of there with a powerful beat of his wings. The last thing Dean saw made his heart stop altogether: Charlie and Dorothy, who had probably followed them inside, standing at the end of the hallway and looking at them with open mouths and wide eyes. Then they were gone.
“And Jo?” Dean had to ask because that was important. That was what brought up the meeting in the first place. Because even if Ellen had been blown up, Jo had been technically killed by a hellhound. And as it had been with Eileen at first, she hadn’t made it upstairs.
The ribbing was kept up the whole two hours they had spent there and Dean liked how Cas had a witty comeback for his every word. He hadn’t had anyone telling him off since Sam and it felt good to banter with someone again – and it was banter, yes. Cas bitched about his sudden appearance, but it was more exasperation that true bitterness. Dean liked him even more as the minutes passed.
Dean stepped inside the dimly lit hall and three armed men were already on him, guns pointed at his head. He raised his hands in surrender.
“Cas,” he groaned in frustration, nipping at the other man’s lip which earned him a deep, husky moan.
“Hey, princess,” Dean ruffled her hair and grinned at the laugh that got from her. He wasn’t envious of her parents who had to deal with that much energy.
“Yes,” Naomi nodded. “You were always a rebel, though. The only child of ours with a soulmate.” Soulmate? What? “Oh, don’t look so shocked.” If immortal non-humans would roll their eyes, Naomi would’ve done it now. “Normally, when two souls are connected, which is rare in itself, they follow each other into the After. In your case, it’s a bit more complicated.”
It took a blissful, amazing week until their appointment with Roman. Dean’s arm was feeling much better by the end of it and he could now actually shoot without it giving him any real trouble.
Dean opened the side door just as Bobby shut off the light in the garage. He wasn’t prepared to find someone on the other side.
“You’re right,” he sighed. He frowned in concentration and the new appendages disappeared like they’d never existed. Cas rolled his shoulders. “Jack and Claire will be home in a couple hours.”
It only took them ten or so minutes to turn up again, finally dressed up and the girl wishing Dean good luck as the front door closed behind her.
“No, no, no!” Dean protested, now completely awake, propping himself on one elbow. “This is an important conversation. Like, could you hold me up long enough to screw me against a wall?” Neither of them had ever been light and even though Cas had been strong before – something Dean had admired on many occasions – holding the other’s full weight was something they could do only for a short while or with some help from either the other or sturdy inanimate objects.
“I remember, you went into hysterics,” his brother nodded. “You were afraid of your ‘real father’ and what he would say about your disobedience. I was the only one you felt safe around.”
“Gabe’s got my message,” Cas strode up to them. The leather aviator jacket he was wearing, paired with the sunglasses sitting on top of his tousled hair made him look really dreamy. “I don’t think he took it very seriously. He texted about staying low which just means he’ll be at the nearest strip club.”
Had he made a mistake somehow? Hadn’t noticed something, too smitten to realize he’d been played? Leading the enemy straight home?
The waiter brought their breakfasts, shooting shy looks in Sam’s direction who thanked him with an awkward smile.
Dean’s head snapped to the side to look at Cas who was clutching his temples with both hands and was swaying on his feet.
I can’t believe it’s over, I loved writing this thing. If you liked it, please, let me know. Also, I’d like to thank everyone who followed this story and extra love to those who commented on every update. You’re the best!
“Mrs. Tran, I’m Detective Novak, this is Detective Winchester,” Cas started talking before Dean could even open his mouth and held out a hand for her to shake, his voice soft and somber. “We’d like to ask you a couple questions about your son. We’re sorry for your loss.”
“I’m pr– proud of you,” he got them out after what felt like forever because he damn sure was and Sam needed to know. He still had to get a mate and children and maybe a fucking dog. Wouldn’t be hard, he was a good kid. Dean had done a good job with him. Cas could be his pups’ uncle. “Cas,” he choked on the name. His vision was getting blurry and his hearing was like someone was playing with the volume of Baby’s radio. Whoever it was was an asshole. Probably messed up the heating, too, because the Impala was never that cold if he could help it.
It had been Cas, actually, who had noticed this because he noticed everything about him. And he had been the one who had said that Dean should apply to college to learn mechanical engineering and get a degree in something he knew and enjoyed.
The journey there hadn’t been as awful as Dean’d thought it would be. Cas had become surprisingly accommodating after he’d been told what was going on. The accusing stares had disappeared, replaced with ones of puzzlement and a bit wonder. He hadn’t asked any question which Dean had been very grateful for.
The weapon looked like a short sword, and pretty familiar from Lily’s teaching – an angel blade. It fitted greatly in his hand, the balance perfect. He would’ve marveled at it, if it wasn’t for the fact that the demon tried to claw his eyes out with her bare hands.
He took the half-full bag and put it on the couch in the living room. The windowsills looking at the street were full of potted plants, healthy and green, enjoying the sunlight. Dean didn’t find much personal items, though, no photos or gifts. The fridge was half-full with both take-out boxes and healthier stuff. There was a coffee mug in the sink. Dean washed it, because he was a nice guy like that.
“Dean,” Cas groaned, voice impossibly deep, scent like heavy, warm summer rain and Dean moaned back. Something was digging into his back, cold metal against his clothes as he was pressed into Baby’s backdoor. Soon he was practically buzzing out of his skin with want, Cas’ expert tongue doing that thing that made his knees buckle.
“Of course,” Dean agreed hurriedly, putting the card in his jacket pocket. Now that he had it, he wanted to get out really fast. They’d spent too much time here already.
“I’m Sam Winchester,” he introduced himself, keeping his hands visible for her. “This is my brother, Dean, and his husband, Cas.”
“You’re an absolute idiot,” Cas almost growled. “You just up and disappeared, because you thought you’re not good enough? Guess what, I thought the same but I was counting my lucky stars that you decided to stay. You were the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me and you just –” He was almost shaking with fury. “That was not only your decision to make.”
“What are you doing?” he asked, hooking his chin over the Alpha’s shoulder, one hand around Cas’ waist, stroking his hip.
“Maybe I can put some things into perspective for you,” Dean shrugged even though nobody could see it. “I retired because the people I was working for, the ones I put my trust in, used my brother for a science experiment. They ruined their own agent. So that kinda put me off. It taught me never to care because it could be easily taken away from you. Didn’t make connections, relationships. Never worked out anyway, because they could just never understand our situation, y’know?” He paused, counting the seconds. “Then I met this guy. Cas. He actually gets it. And now you have him. Now I can’t think of more horrible than to know that your enemies can hurt someone that you love.” Henriksen didn’t answer. There was complete silence. So it had worked. Bless Charlie. “You still there, Victor?” he grinned.
When everyone was finally in their own room, preparing for bed, he was just sitting in the armchair in the corner and looking out the dark window. God, he wanted a drink.
Cas had the nerve to blink up at him innocently while his damn fingers were brushing lightly the length of Dean’s cock through his briefs.
Dean got his wallet and keys, then was out the door. Charlie was already waiting with her small yellow car parking next to the sidewalk, tapping impatiently on the wheel. Guess they were not using Baby. Dean frowned at the thought.
“Are you alright?” Cas turned to look at him fully, hands twitching with the urge to check him over with his powers.
“You know you can find out from your textbook,” Dean put the knife down, taking the now cut-up chicken breast and putting them in the fridge for the pesto he would make later.
“You can’t help a little more than that?” Dorothy asked, her usual seriousness of a responsible hunter and Woman of Letters replaced by an almost childish whine. Gordon must’ve really made life difficult for them.
The tea was perfectly cold, Cas’ side was pressing against his, and he was gonna have his family together in a couple minutes. Everything was great.
He took a step closer, his hand moving towards his belt and Dean reacted immediately. His hand shot out to Gabe’s throat, who grabbed his wrist immediately and gripped a hunter knife with the other – the only thing stopping him from nicking Dean’s neck was his shorter reach.
“Not much trouble?” Cas repeated. He looked like he wanted to punch Dean. “I don’t even know I believe you.”
“You control your own time, Dean,” he rolled his eyes. He sat down and took the beer from Ellen with a quiet thanks, his free hand resting on Dean’s knee.
“You’re lying,” he downed his drink, putting the glass back on the table, slowly looking back. “You love deals. So what do you want?”
“And you want to help,” Cas said and Dean could almost see his worried frown. “Dean, she was probably hunting something, you know that, right? I don’t want you to endanger yourself.”
The Alpha was probably in his mid-thirties, dark hair and dark eyes that complimented his fair skin. He wasn’t bad-looking, but the hunter really wasn’t interested.
“Lay back,” Cas gasped out when they pulled back for air for a moment, like he was reading Dean’s mind.
“Hold it. Let me see him,” a security guard stopped him, not even looking at Dean. He leaned down to check the knocked-out fireman’s face. “It’s not him.” He straightened up, waving Dean onward, his attention already elsewhere. “Yeah, yeah, go ahead.”
He threw the glass to Cas without preamble, thank God. Cas caught it and clutched it tightly for a moment, eyes falling shut and peacefulness taking over his features.
There was something familiar in her tone and it took Dean a moment to recognize it. Cas had been just the same when he had met first John, then Bobby. A person who otherwise didn’t care about anyone’s opinion, meeting someone who was important. Important enough to take away something they didn’t want to lose. So they had to be careful.
“You’re beautiful,” he said quietly, leaning forward to kiss the nape of his neck. He felt a shiver going down Cas’ spine and he followed it with his mouth, his hands grabbing onto Cas’ waist to keep him in place. Those toned muscles relaxed under his touch, the skin becoming slick with sweat. Dean enjoyed his little journey over Cas’ body, his neglected erection bobbing between his legs as he sucked a bruise on the small of Cas’ back, his husband letting out a low moan.
Dean ran. He felt the shots landing only inches from his feet before Rowena opened fire. He just reached the first line of trees when he’d heard a painful grunt behind him and then Sam’s shout.
“You should get laid, kiddo,” Gabe said cheekily as the lid finally opened. “I bet Dean here would be eager to help you out.”
They searched him uncomfortably thoroughly, and then he was led up the polished stairs and down a corridor made of stone like some medieval castle. They stopped in front of intricately decorated double doors and a man nodded at Dean to go inside.
“I don’t have your fucking knife, jerk!” Sam was looking at him and Dean could make out his bitch face without problem.
“But I don’t know what Crowley will ask in return,” Cas squinted at the blueberry in his hand. “What if it takes weeks? Or months?”
“Where’s your phone?” he asked Cas when they were sitting in the darkness of Baby, just waiting. Fuck, the thought should’ve occurred to him sooner. That would be like a beacon pointing straight at them.
Bobby would be alright. He was maybe grumpier than normal, but he hadn’t lost a lot of blood and within a few weeks would be good as new. Dean was glad for that but his wound meant he was also on the bench.
Now though, his husband was looking at Gordon with narrowed eyes and a tilted head as if he was trying to see inside him.
“I know. I’m sorry,” Cas murmured. “Jack asked me, when he pulled me back from the Empty, before he… was gone, that I keep the peace up here, looking over the souls.” He paused briefly, eyes narrowing with annoyance. “To be honest, I thought you wouldn’t die so soon that I don’t even have time to consider going back down.”
“Just if I don’t follow through,” Cas had a touch of that smirk from a couple days ago back on his face. Now it didn’t seem so out of place, somehow – maybe because they knew more or because Cas felt more confident than before. Dean could get used to seeing it, actually. “So what if we call that Lily Sunder, then we go home and try it out.”
Yeah, the kids. They didn’t need to know about any of this until he and Cas knew what the fuck was happening.
Cas nodded and turned on his heel. He fumbled with something in his trunk before striding to the middle of the Devil’s Trap and painting a symbol in the dirt before putting a bowl in it. Dean could not make out much in the dark but the three lit candles were hard to miss. He did it all with ease and practice.
That didn’t sit well with Dean either. He knew enough about demons to know they were no easy cases. Exorcising only worked for a little while, just until they crawled out of Hell again. They tortured and killed for the fun of it, ruining lives in every way they could.
“This was scary,” he tried to whisper but he didn’t really manage it. “What the fuck are they doing here?”
Dean snuggled up to him, pulling the wing closer. Cas handed him a mug full of steaming hot chocolate. Dean pressed a grateful kiss on his neck, taking a sip and looking over at the other beautiful view.
“Dean’s a very capable mechanic with a charming personality,” Cas leaned back. “He handles every car trusted in his care respectfully and our clients know that.”
That was nothing they hadn’t expected. They had talked about it, what they would say or do when the feds would come knocking.
Cas walked over to him and with a swift movement pulled out the knife in question from behind the big bowl sitting in the middle of the table. He held it out by the handle and raised an eyebrow.
“I have no idea,” Cas shrugged. “I spotted it in her belt. It can kill most demons. You wouldn’t stand a chance with it against a Knight or a Prince of Hell, not even talking about Lilith, but it could come in handy.”
The woman looking at them was in her late-forties to early-fifties, with short black hair and an impeccable business costume. She seemed haggard, her cheeks hollow and pale, her eyes empty.
“We may have talked more than I've let you know,” Sam ran a hand through his hair. “I asked her not to say anything. But come on, these are angels, was I just supposed to
“I talked to Rowena and the new Death. We made arrangements with the hellhounds. Not that there would be much of a problem with that, Rowena still keeps away from the deals. Says the hounds are looking better around her throne and guarding her door. But if they kill someone it doesn’t automatically means they go to Hell. Same goes for angry spirits. Death – his name’s Dearil – will talk to Anubis about that, too.”
“Hey, would you listen? I’m trying to save your soul here!” his little brother smacked his arm, scent turning a bit irritated. “Dean, I really think this guy can help you.”
“Excuse me,” Dean spoke up. “Ms. Sunders, I’m not trying to be rude but how can we know you’re an expert?”
“I know who you are, Dean,” she tutted. “You’ll join us soon enough. I already called dibs at your rack.”
“Hi there,” he grinned at Dean, coming well into his personal space before he could even react. “What’s a sweet-smelling Omega like you doing here all alone?”
like Charlie, despite his best efforts. He hated it, because she was almost certainly a Woman of Letters and her very presence was a danger to Cas and their family. In any other circumstances they probably would’ve gotten along great.
Dean turned into their driveway and while they waited for the garage door to open, he asked, “You know this sounds insane, right?” He had half a mind to turn around and take Cas to the nearest clinic.
“And I was a closeted nerd,” Dean rolled his eyes and squeezed back. “Anyway, what I was trying to say is that I was a sure thing then and I’ve been since. So whatever… whatever’s going on with you, I’m here. Forever.”
“After Bobby?” Sam shot him a bitch face. “No, of course I’m in. Just saying. We’re gonna need some serious help.”
“See you later, guys,” Sam nodded at them and asked Charlie if she wanted to join Eileen and him for dinner at Jody and Donna’s. Dean knew the answer so he started walking towards Bobby’s house, Cas right by his side.
“You already suspect anyone?” Dean sipped his drink just so he wouldn’t have to look at them. They wouldn’t involve him in this if Cas was on their list, surely.
“This may be a terrible idea,” Cas said after a few seconds. That wasn’t an outright no. Dean waited. “Call me when you’re in town and we’ll talk about it.”
As Victor opened the front door again to leave, he almost bumped into Charlie. She looked just as surprised, fist lifted in the air like she was just about to knock.
Homework was forgotten for the rest of the evening and Dean didn’t even really tried to remind them. Kids had to put up with a lot of family drama these days, they deserved a break.
“And you sure about this?” he asked, trying to stomp down on his worry but it was futile. “You didn’t fall just to get it back thirty years later.”
“I might need a vehicle to find him then. This case cannot wait,” he nodded at Sam and Dean at his back who were trying to be as imposing as possible in their fitted suits they had decided to wear. Lucky for Dean, the Bunker still had most of his stuff from his active days.
“You scouted out the forest,” the guy, Ainsley barked at her sharply. “You picked up any other scents or footprints? Hmm?”
“Man, I only looked up your address last night,” Dean protested. “I wanna stalk someone, I would know everything within hours. I didn’t even know what you looked like until you stepped in the door.”
“Shut up, boy,” Bobby marched over to his desk and turned around the really old computer sitting on it. “Care to tell me what the hell did you do?”
“Couple months ago,” Cas sighed. “Gabe’s a pilot. What the fuck has he done that ended with him on a hit list?”
Dean gave him a brief smile and handed the flash drive and the box to Sam, getting his gun back in return.
Cas’ hair was a mess as usual, face flushed, his eyes glinting up at Dean wickedly. His lips were stretched around him obscenely, and Dean’s heart pounded furiously at the sight, no matter how often he’d marveled at it throughout the years.
“It’s –” Cas licked his lips nervously. Dean put a hand on his shoulder to calm him a bit. “It’s about the biblical apocalypse. The appearance of the four horsemen.”
Dean wandered into the apartment. It hadn’t changed much. The living room was maybe more full of books and scripts than before. The pristine white walls were covered by bookcases, there was the old, comfortable couch they’d spent hours on cuddling and talking and watching trash TV. The adjoining kitchen was all dark wood and black marble, and across from it was the hallway that led to Cas’ study, the bathroom and the bedroom.
“I’m not the one whose mind will be dissected tomorrow,” the hunter shot back. “What are you doing out here?”
The agent was standing in front of his desk with his back to him, but he turned around just as Dean hung up the coat and the cap on the rack next to the door. There was the beautiful flash of recognition downing on his face before it changed to determination, then a coffee mug was flying straight at Dean’s head who blocked it effortlessly.
“You don’t know that,” the hunter couldn’t help the low growl in his voice. Cas fucked up this chance for them. Who knew when would they have something like that again?
“Whoa,” he gasped but he was already pretty okay with flying with Husband Airline. He only got a little wrong-footed when Cas was doing it without warning, like right now.
“I better get going now.” She stepped forward and took Cas’ hand in both of hers, keeping eye-contact all the while. “I would be grateful if you could send this incantation to your brothers and sisters. They deserve to decide for themselves if they wish to see us. Probably not, but knowing that the possibility’s there would maybe give them some closure.”
“Hi, Dean,” Charlie sat down across from him, her smile for the first time a bit unsure. Dorothy didn’t say a word.
“It goes the other way, too,” Cas said to her. “You dedicated much of your time to angels and I’d be happy to help in any way I can.”
“Fuck, Cas, do that again, please,” he whimpered and Cas swore quietly before he started pounding into him wildly and Dean anchored himself with his arms around Cas’ shoulders, trying to meet him every time.
“We’ve come a long way,” he sighed and went back to admire the sky, sliding a bit down so he could comfortably rest his head on Cas’ broad shoulder.
They had been teenagers and broke so Dean had taken Cas up to that small lake in the mountains. It was a hidden spot, a rickety old wooden picnic table and two benches the only sign of humanity and the scenery was beautiful. They’d gone there often after – Cas had even proposed there on a warm summer evening when they had been twenty. But that first one…
It didn’t last long. Dean hadn’t expected it to, not with months and months of pent up tension and with the tiring day they had behind them. He was ready to burst in minutes, Cas hitting that sweet, sweet spot inside him with almost every thrust, and Dean was leaving biting kisses on every inch of skin he could reach, Cas’ name mixing with curses when he had enough air to utter them.
He didn’t know how long they stood there but Dean felt better already, like a weight had been lifted from his shoulders.
It took only minutes until he felt the familiar pressure in him building, ready to erupt and the heat consuming him from the inside.
“Let’s get out of here,” Dean walked back over to them as Cas pulled his hand away from Eileen’s forehead and Sam put the file back into the holder.
The MoL squad rolled in just a couple minutes later in a black SUV. The girls asked him to stay – Charlie could get in trouble for bringing him along for a hunt – and left to greet their colleagues.
Dean was the one who knocked on Lisa’s door to tell her they couldn’t make it after all and how sorry they were about that. She was completely understanding because she was a nice person like that. Meanwhile, Cas called Benny that they would be out of town to take a break and then Bobby whom they somehow hadn’t had the time to inform of their arrival.
“Alright,” his brother nodded and went over to Cas to hug him tightly for a long moment. The angel hugged him back immediately. “Glad you’re alright, man,” Dean heard him whisper, and Cas had a gentle smile on his face when they pulled away. “Don’t be a stranger, okay?”
The cut on Dorothy’s scalp was treated as soon as they reached the car. At least Dean felt useful while doing it, the experience of raising two accident-prone kids coming in handy.
When they landed, it was cold and the sun was pretty much still up. Cas’ left wing curled around him immediately, keeping out the wind and cocooning him in warmth.
There was not much talking after that, the unhurried tempo Dean’d sat perfect for the both of them. The only sounds breaking the silence were their uneven breathing, the whispered swears and bit-off moans. Cas was soft and completely yielding, his face reflecting a kind of pleasure Dean couldn’t take his eyes off after he’d seen it.
“Thank you for your time, Professor Novak,” she fluttered her lashes, sending an annoyed look at the other men. Her scent was full of blooming lilies and aconites. Something ugly twisted in Dean’s stomach.
That had been the most brutal undercover op he’d ever had and he’d loathed every second and got a bunch of recurring nightmare out of it. But being Alistair’s assistant had also given him such a thorough training in torture that the CIA could never match. It was Dean’s most hated skill.
Dean almost landed on his ass from the shock of it all. They were busted. They knew. Fucking knew about Cas, and that was more terrifying then his husband turning into an angel in the first place.
“You can take others with you, but a human wouldn’t perceive it the same way,” Lily spoke up. “But if the two of you could fly here, we could talk in person. I’m sure your husband wouldn’t wanna be left out of this.”
They tried to be as silent as possible, which Cas managed way better. They reached the door too soon for Dean’s liking, anticipation making him jittery and the itch to reach for his gun only growing, even when he knew it wouldn’t do much.
There was something else in there, Dean was sure. Cas was getting more and more agitated by the day. Sex quenched it for a while, but it wasn’t enough. Cas had a bunch of emotions he hadn’t processed yet, boiling just under the surface and they’d have to find a way to get it out of his system. A real, actual hunt would be a perfect solution for him, but…
“They ruled it as a burglary, yes,” Dean nodded. He’d had a whole night to look it up and he’d relayed the details to Cas, too. Kevin Tran had been a college student, barely twenty-one and already halfway to a great career as a reporter. Exceptionally high IQ, part of an orchestra as a cellist, working part-time at a library, ready to move in with his girlfriend. Then he’d stumbled upon something he shouldn’t have.
“Dean, you went for a drive,” he said softly. He seemed… lighter somehow, the permanent frown on his face almost gone. He looked like someone who didn’t have a care in the world.
Cas got rid of his tie as soon as the door closed behind them, halfway to the shower already. Dean grabbed him with his good arm and turned him around to kiss him again. Cas gasped into his mouth, kissing back immediately, deeper and with more force that Dean kept up with readily. He was pretty sure that he could kiss Cas for a long time, just letting their hands slowly wander and it would take hours before they went any further. Well, next time, maybe, because he’d wanted this for months and he had to get the edge off before he could get himself to really relax into it. Maybe tomorrow. He had every intention to ravish Cas right now.
Getting in the actual gate was easy, Dean only had to say the name of Bobby’s alias and they were in.
“We should shower,” he pointed out after some time. He didn’t want to move but they really needed to get cleaned up. Cas probably reached the same conclusion because he sighed and nodded.
Dean pressed P3 and kept his thumb on the button. It gave him a kind of nostalgic feeling. He’d done this countless times in the fifteen years he’d worked here.
“When I’m getting out of here, I’m gonna meet up with my ex. So you’d do me a favor,” Dean gave him his most charming smile.
“All right. But I want you to look further back… When you were very young… Just a couple of years old.”
He only had a moment to glance at the white shirt opening to reveal Cas’ toned chest before the angel was back on him. The skin on skin contact was amazing, Dean let out a low moan and pulled him closer, their erections rubbing together through the layers of their jeans. Cas hissed and nipped on Dean’s lower lip, then started pulling him towards the bed.
The take-off was smooth and Cas was obviously experienced. It made Dean’s competence kink kick in but he still clung to his seat, avoiding looking out the window.
“Shopping list,” came the answer. He dropped the pen a couple moments later and tried to get out of Dean’s embrace but the Omega was strong enough to stop him – at least for a moment. “Dean.”
Dean’s only frustration, really, was Claire’s reluctance to bring Kaia over. Not even for studying, or hell, just making out in her room, like Dean had done from the moment he and Cas had been official. She hadn’t brought her up in conversation, not since their movie night. And Dean didn’t want to pressure his daughter, he and Cas had promised they wouldn’t, but it was getting to him.
The room was only filled with the sounds of their heaving breaths and the quiet rocking of the bed. Dean couldn’t even curse properly, his groans swallowed by Cas’ bitten-off grunts.
“Dean.” Sam now sounded placating as he looked him over with careful eyes. “Are you alright? You didn’t hit your head or something?”
“I know the feeling,” he shot an amused look at Dean who made a wounded noise at the accusation. It made Kate giggle.
Cas walked out a minute later, drying his hair with his towel, but stopped in his tracks when he saw Dean and what he’d done with the room. His whole face softened and Dean grinned back at him, stepping up to him to share another, sweet kiss.
He drove a little farther and got rid of the two knocked out agents, leaving them on an empty sidewalk. He wetted down Bela after cuffing her because he didn’t trust the woman, and he found a small caliber gun in his purse.
The city of Fairborn was right next to the base and Cas navigated the streets with ease. It didn’t take five minutes until he stopped the car in front of the Night Craving. It was obviously a striptease bar with the lack of front windows and the neon female forms and signs. Dean had to admit it was a great business move to put it so close to a military base full of soldiers.
“You’re awfully sure,” Cas grumbled. His coat was billowing behind him dramatically, but they looked ordinary enough that nobody payed them any mind.
Kaia’s eyes turned murderous again as she glanced back at her girlfriend. Jack had moved to the background the moment Kaia showed up, probably to get away from the lecture. Smart decision, but it wouldn’t save him from his dads.
“Yes. But that’s because you feel. You’re killed for showing any emotions – empathy, mercy, anger, anything – when you’re an angel. You can only feel faith and loyalty and love for Father.” Something occurred to him. “Dean, do you know how many angels have actually seen God? Face-to-face?”
Not instinct. Not self-preservation. A conscious decision. He’d never done that before. Cas knew that, too.
“You’re putting too much faith into my abilities we haven’t even tested yet,” Cas crawled under the covers, the book for the night waiting on top of the bedside drawer. “We don’t actually know if I can fight demons.”
“I would’ve killed him myself if I had the resources, but he knows about every step I take and would’ve got rid of me the moment he found out I even entertained the thought of turning on him. He has better connections to the CIA than me, for sure.”
“Kate?” he mumbled as his legs gave out. Someone caught him, his nose catching whiff of Cas’ scent as he was pulled from the door and back inside.
“It’s no problem, dearie,” she smiled back at him, charmed by both of them from the beginning. “My husband snores, so it’s kind of a relief,” she added in a mock-whisper.
“They’re working according to a profile the Men of Letters put together. It’s a bit screwed, at least it doesn’t fit you. Turns out having a family and friends is a great alibi nowadays.”
Dean unbuckled the belt with efficiency and opened Cas’ pants just as quickly, freeing him from his boxers. His husband was already aroused, not really a surprise, and Dean’s mouth watered.
He kept most of his important stuff under his bed – a bit cliché, but very handy. The duffel was already packed with spare clothes, money and an untraceable laptop and phone. But the most valuable ones were kept under a floorboard in a locked iron box: fake IDs, credit cards and his beloved Colt M1911A1, nickel plated with ivory handles and engraving.
“I have good reason to,” Dean grinned at him, leaving towards the maze of hallways. Henriksen should be two doors away. He needed to be fast, before the cameras recognized him. Thank God for the cap.
“Get him off!” he yelled at Dean and he was happy to do so in the next corner, Henriksen flying off and onto the concrete.
“Yeah,” Sam nodded, getting a kerchief from his back pocket to wrap his palm in it. Dean did the same as he moved closer to Cas.
“You know,” Sam spoke up as they sat into Baby’s front. “I think I get what you saw in him. He doesn’t look it but he’s kind of a jackass.”
“You sure you’re alright with me chillin’ here?” she asked as they walked into the library, but was soon distracted. “Is that a real scimitar?” she ran to the shelf and lifted it. “Whoa! Can you teach me how to wield this? I could be such an Azeem at the next LARP event.”
They didn’t have much time to ponder on it as the door opened and the principal’s head appeared in the gap.
Cas flew them out of there and Dean was immediately at the window to look out over the street. The house across them was completely dark, Charlie’s car gone.
“According to his calendar, he came here more than was strictly required of him,” Morris said. “If you don’t mind, we’d question you and your husband in a place where we won’t be disturbed. Meanwhile Officers Henriksen and Reidy will do the same with the others.”
Just as Dean parked down in the curb next to the garage, Bela and two of her men were running straight towards him (or more likely the car marked with the Vice President’s logo he was sitting in), Sam sprinting after them with a toy clock and some inactive ammunition taped to his west like a suicide bomber. He probably had that glint in his eyes that tipped everyone off he was not so right in the head, too. It was not a calming sight.
“Love your hand,” he mumbled and moved back into the thrusts, feeling Cas’ blazing gaze on him the whole time. His hand slid over Cas’ back and up his neck into his hair, the other grabbing onto the sheets.
“Here,” Cas pulled it out of his pocket. “But it’s untraceable and not even on my name. It was a gift.”
“I got a paper cut while working,” Cas sighed. “It did the same thing then. I wanted to call you but Dick showed up.”
“Why?” Dean frowned, honestly curious. He couldn’t imagine why anyone would voluntarily not keep in touch with their family. Not talking to Sam was for both of their safety but to abandon his brother of his own volition?
There were voices coming from inside and Dean felt the urgent need to run away. Before he could make up his mind, the door opened, and there stood Castiel Novak in a crisp white button-up with a striped white-blue tie, navy slacks and sensible shoes. He'd put on some muscles – not like he'd been slim before but now he completely filled out his clothes and just seeing that made Dean’s thoughts go straight into the gutter. His dark brown hair looked artfully tousled but Dean intimately knew it had nothing to do with combs or products. He was still sporting that lickable five o’clock shadow, his full lips were still chapped and his eyes still the most mesmerizing things Dean’d ever seen.
“Cas, the problem wasn’t you. It was me.” Cas was fantastic. A stubborn, sassy asshole, true, but he was caring, gentle, freakishly smart and passionate about everything. He was like a ray of sunshine in Dean’s pretty cloudy existence. And he had wanted to give the Alpha everything he ever desired, a happy apple pie life with a couple kids and maybe a cat because Cas liked them. And Dean’d needed to help his father with hunting down the demon. “I couldn’t give you what you deserved, we both know that.”
“Guys, come and see this!” they heard Sam’s shout from the library. Dean shared a look with Cas before both of them ran down the corridor, following Sam’s voice.
“It’s so good to see you,” Balthazar seemed genuine about it. He behaved more human than Anna and Uriel, that was for sure. “Even in your current… condition. But that can be easily corrected.”
He was pretty sure Cas couldn’t read minds but he always had a knack for knowing what Dean was thinking. His eyes widened as he realized something.
The sunset only lasted a couple minutes, regrettably. But Cas only moved to lean back against the stack of pillows and took Dean with him.
“I already told Cas this, but I think you should go and visit Bobby,” Sam said after Baby’s wheels were rolling on asphalt again. “It would get you out of town and I know no one else who has a better chance in helping you.”
“I’ve got you,” Cas rumbled into his ear and changed stance to more or less drag him inside. As soon as the door was closed behind them, his palm cradled Dean’s jaw and the sliver of grace coursing through Dean’s body felt magnificent.
“Bobby could slip out and take her out from behind,” Cas said. “She had a new nest hiding just out of town.” He shrugged. “They’re not a problem anymore.”
Dean changed into a loose shirt and sweats and sneaked into the bathroom to leave Cas clean underwear and nothing else. He walked over to Cas’ side of the bed and pulled out the mixtape kept there.
They’d just finished college, finding steady jobs quickly after graduation and they had decided to try adoption. When they’d met Jack and Claire at the center, the superintendent, Sandra told them that it would be a ‘two for one kind of deal’ if they wanted either of them. They had decided to give it a try.
He turned and was probably about to walk back to his room but the panic and the uneasy knot in his stomach made Dean’s hand shot out and grab the prof’s wrist. Both of them froze and it took the hunter a moment to realize they hadn’t even touched since they’d met again. Cas’ soft skin under his fingertips was as thrilling as four years ago.
“Hey,” he murmured sleepily, eyes blinking open. The room was still completely dark so it should be really early. “Why are we up?”
“You’ll understand, believe me,” Crowley shrugged uncaringly. “So don’t be an idiot and start digging deeper. And I make the contract disappear. Find me again when you feel ready.”
“Stop it,” he muttered. So Cas could see his soul if so desired and obviously liked it. It could be worse.
They decided to meet with Roman on his estate just outside of Chicago. It was way easier than an office building in the middle of the city – too high, lots of civilians, harder to get away. It was just easier this way.
“Back at you, Dads!” Claire narrowed her eyes and probably the only thing keeping her from making a rude gesture was the idea of being grounded.
“You can’t just take on a monster – a zombie – all by yourself. You’re not hunters and this was way too dangerous for you.”
“You use what you have,” Cas shrugged with a smug smirk on his face, twirling his club with elegant nonchalance. Asshole. “I wouldn’t call that cheating.”
“Right. Okay,” Dean nodded probably a little dumbly, his mind rebooting after the image of Cas under the shower had stuck in there. He decided to just go.
“Claire and Jack?” he responded with a question of his own, tilting his head in the way he did when he was listening to something that was out of a normal guy’s (like Dean’s) hearing range.
Dean was too preoccupied with a frozen brain and fluttering stomach to appreciate how the smirk on Sam’s face melted into a disgusted frown.
They wouldn’t try to kill Cas, anyway. They would make him disappear, yes, but just to get any information out of him (which wasn’t much or important) or to get leverage (which would work).
It took maybe a minute before anything happened but then there was a gentle but firm touch on his shoulder, turning him enough so Cas could look at him properly with an earnest gaze. There was honey in his scent.
“We’re going to Michigan,” he said. Cas raised an eyebrow in question. “I’ll tell you more on the way.”
He was on top when they landed diagonally across the sheets, straddling Cas’ waist and grinding his hips down without hesitation. The strangled moan leaving the Alpha’s lips was beautiful and Dean leaned down to feel it resonating in Cas’ throat with his lips. While he was there, he decided to nibble on the skin a bit.
He pulled out the lock-pick kit he’d ordered online – he had a lot of free time with Cas and the kids out and about so much – and leaned down to the handle to get to work. It wasn’t easy, but he earned his living by tinkering with things.
“So we just act like we have all week, like nothing strange happened,” Jack summed up. His determined expression was so cute and Cas-like Dean melted a little inside.
“Just fuck me,” he gritted out, feeling full in every way possible and his heart wanted to burst out of his chest.
“One of the men you ordered killed,” Dean told her stoically, watching her through the rearview mirror.
They arrived at the park’s parking lot maybe half an hour later. There weren’t many cars, the day being a Tuesday, but Dorothy’s red bike was there, the chrome glinting in the sunlight.
Dean got a little chocked up by that and he wished not for the first time to be able to kill someone twice.
Dean turned his gaze away and back to the fifties comedy he couldn’t hear but could guess the plot just fine without sound anyway.
“You never felt the urge to protect Castiel from that?” Valente tried to goad him. “Never wanted to just… make this problem disappear?”
Cas came back alone and he didn’t need to say to not disturb Ellen for a while. Ash stayed behind as he always did and the others packed up and piled out onto the porch. The rain stopped just as they stepped out, the air pleasantly warm.
“Not really, he’s more used to her getting in trouble.” Jack closed his mouth and swallowed, looking at his parents with wide eyes. “Am I in trouble?”
“You wanna dabble in the supernatural, fine,” he said. “You can help Uncle Bobby reorganize his books in the weekend.”
“Y’know Garth would invite everyone,” Dean shrugged. “Just because we hate the guy doesn’t mean everybody does, too.”
They were in a kind of tranquility the next month or so. The kids went to school every morning, Dean and Cas to work. Sam came over every couple of days for dinner. There was a gathering they had to attend, hosted by Charlie and Dorothy as a kinda house-warming. Speaking of the Women of Letters, Dean and Cas met up with them a couple times in a nearby bar as sort of double dates, still not risking bringing them into their home.
Dean picked up the closest pillow from the bed and threw it at Cas’ head. He leaned away easily with a grin.
As the incantation went on, the wind picked up and after a while turned into a miniature tornado, the sand around them making it hard to see anything. Cas’ wing curled around Dean to protect him from the worst of it. It would be a bitch to get all of that out of the feathers later, but Dean was grateful.
“Joined the eco club,” Cas told him. “And volunteers at the animal shelter. Talked Claire into it, too.”
Wooden cabin. Minimalist, but certainly lived-in. He and Sam were sitting against one of the walls, and there was a crick in his neck from keeping his head tipped down to his chest for so long. There must’ve been some time since they had been captured then.
“More than I’d like,” Cas answered and stood up. He lit a match and dropped it in the bowl. Whatever was in it made the flames flare up for a moment before simmering down to a tiny glow. The prof backed out of the circle and waited. Dean and Sam did the same, looking around restlessly.
He parked Baby at the opening of an alley and went the rest of the way on foot. He stayed off the main road and used as many shortcuts as possible. He’d memorized the map of Sioux Falls the moment Bobby had moved here. It gave him an exceptional advantage.
“Oh, whatever,” Roman rolled his eyes, shifting his wrists uncomfortably. “I made her Vice President.”
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Sam answered sullenly, probably put out that Bobby had gotten one over him. He was probably over the ‘Thank God you haven’t really died!’ phase already.
They piled into a booth at the back, Dean on one side and the girls on the other. They waited until they got their coffees and a small bowl of peanuts before Charlie launched into it.
“Cas, uh,” he started to stumble through it, but he wanted to ask this and hadn’t found anyone who could’ve a better answer. He certainly wasn’t gonna ask a demon and Cas had a probably close to infinite knowledge in his brain. “If we can’t get your mojo back, if you can’t bargain with that Crowley – what’s gonna happen when they come for me?”
“It’s energy in its purest form. Angels don’t have souls, just grace, which is a source of their power as well. Without it, angels become humans. I ripped out my grace, was stuck with a soul. But souls have to go somewhere. Mine chose our mother. She got twins.”
On the road home Dean still tried to come to terms with the fact that he’d had a previous life. Or like, hundreds of it.
She called everyone into the kitchen to prepare themselves some early dinner (how was it so late already?) before they would go over the file Bobby had in his hands. They collectively sent Dean upstairs to change into some clean clothes and he found a t-shirt and some jeans in one of the guest rooms that fitted him; Rowena was shockingly prepared for anything and Dean had always respected her for that.
The wings were another thing that had taken time to get used to, but not in the bad way. Dean was dead, he couldn’t come to harm by seeing them. They were vast and full and perfect, restored to their full glory by Jack. Gotten an upgrade, too, as Cas had said, their ever-changing colors nothing like the black and dark gray they had been, marred by hellfire and the Fall. Dean was almost as much in love with them as he was with their owner.
Dean’s heart stopped for a moment. It would be a logical move, Cas sticking with his brother instead of trying to get this mess solved and survive while the whole secret service was on their tail. Somehow it never occurred to Dean that Cas would be anywhere else, though. The thought made his gut all twisted up.
“Not to make Squirrel moody here, but we have to count on the CIA torturing him,” Crowley shrugged. “He knows an awful lot.”
“I’m Charlie, just moved in across from you,” she pointed behind her back. The once empty house had new curtains in its windows, a cute yellow AMC and a red bike stood next to each other on the driveway. He hadn’t even noticed. “I saw you here sitting on the stairs all by yourself and you seemed pretty devastated. You must be Dean.”
“She’s beautiful,” Dean hummed, thinking back of the picture he’d seen her. Tall and slim with her dark hair in a braid and eyes kind even through the picture. “I’m guessing the third one wasn’t the charm either, huh? What happened? She was tired of the traveling? The irregular work hours? The secrets?”
The demon who was almost on him twitched and stopped, giving him enough time to pull out the iron knife from his boot. It wouldn’t do much, but it could give them time. For what, he didn’t know.
“I just know it’s not easy to get the jump on her,” she shook her head lightly, her lips pressed into a thin line. “She called me maybe an hour ago. She was scared, Dean, and Dorothy just doesn’t get scared.”
“What do you think you’re doing?” he looked at the prof who was standing by the Impala’s driver’s seat with a hand outstretched towards Dean, palm up and waiting.
There was a long moment of eye contact, Dean trying to reassure him without words. He saw the moment Cas let it go, his fists unclenching slowly, shoulders relaxing and his eyelids fluttering slightly.
“That’s just a bonus,” Sam waved it away. He let Dean process the conversation before changing topic. “You know, if it
Dean felt full by the time he ate everything so he passed the car keys to Cas without a word. He was going to nap a bit more.
“This is another family emergency,” Jack nodded with a solemn expression. It was not a question. “I’m on it.”
“I talked to her,” Cas said, a sadness in his eyes. “It’s already too late for her, have been for a long time. She played her cards right. Never took a side before Rowena. Kept herself low-level, vanished when she could. Now she’s one of the best warrior she has. Rowena seems to collect Winchester-sympathizers around herself because one of her advisors is named Bela Talbot. Said you’d recognize the name.”
“You got a better idea, then?” Cas opened his mouth but Dean cut him off. “You don’t go alone.” Cas looked pretty aggravated, but didn’t say anything. “Thought so,” Dean smiled smugly. “What if we would be your backup, then? You calling the shots.”
“No,” Cas said quietly. “I’m not talking about that to my… siblings. It’s maybe not fair but I want to think about that spell before I do anything.”
“We have to look into these kind of anomalies,” Dorothy continued. “The only known creatures that could overcharge a whole town like that are angels.”
With a flap of wings Dean found himself in the bedroom, pressed against the wall next to their wardrobe.
There was a devilish smile curling at her lips at that and she looked over at Sam with interest. Dean decided to left them to it.
“Missed you too, Baby,” he stroked the wheel and pulled out into the alley, then was back to pull down the door and closed it.
“Yes, I am,” Jack smiled briefly at the concern, then he turned serious. “And I didn’t start it. I just wanted to defend Harper.”
Surprised shouts were heard before they threw themselves at the three of them. Cas was on one with a flap of wings – they were just there long enough to use, then gone again. The others stopped in their tracks when a bloodcurdling scream and white light filled the whole room and the demon landed on the ground with burned-out eyes.
“Not yet, but we brought in a team. Bevell and Ketch are already working on it,” Dorothy said with a grimace, distaste for her colleagues clear in her voice.
“Oh, you haven’t heard?” Victor shrugged. “The house across from yours got sold. Lisa met one of the new owners.”
Dean saw from the corner of his eye that Cas went deathly pale at the name and he really didn’t want to know who exactly Alastair was.
“Hi,” Dean greeted her with a forced smile of his own. “Sorry to interrupt, but I really need to talk to my brother. It’s kind of an emergency.”
“Hey, sunshine,” he grinned at the angel when he pulled back an inch just to look into those impossibly blue eyes. “You were gone when I woke up,” he whispered between them.
Cas walked straight to Dean who pulled him down by his tie for a kiss. He never got tired of this feeling and he had no clue how he’d lived his whole life without it.
The hike back to the entrance of the park was long as Charlie told Dorothy their part of the story. The hunter wasn’t happy with her involving a civilian but couldn’t argue with her bringing the closest she’d found to reinforcement.
“Dean?” Cas asked, reading his face immediately. He put the food on the counter and sat down on the other chair, pulling it closer, his knee brushing against Dean’s thigh. “What happened?”
“Dry-cleaners!” Cas yelled back. There was some unidentifiable grumbling before Claire appeared in the kitchen.
When they finally reached the bed – cleaner than what Dean was used to, thank fuck – Cas was bare from the waist up but still had his boots on and the hunter was still in his flannel and t-shirt with only his boxers on. Dean didn’t even know how they’d managed that exactly.
He felt a hand on his forearm, a thumb sliding over his wrist in a calming gesture. So Cas had spotted it, too.
Taking off layers of clothes had come gradually, fingers slipping under a shirt or teasing at the waistband of pants. Cas in that new, black trench coat of his looked admittedly hot, way more fitting than the previous ones but it still hid those solid muscles and broad shoulders Dean had drooled over in secret on Earth and mostly openly since he had died.
“Hey, Cas,” he answered as calmly as he could. “We’re in Waterloo, Iowa. Got whiff of a case. Series of ‘wild animal attacks’ at Black Hawk Park, Cedar Falls. Sorry for the delay, we’ll be back when we killed this bitch.”
“Now, where should I start?” he grabbed a simple, sterilized needle and stepped up to Roman, gently touching the tip to his cheek. “Corner of the eye?” He moved the needle, pointing with it at Roman’s hand. “Under your nails?” Then he changed the direction until it was directly turned towards his groin. “Or let’s be literal abut you being a Dick?”
“Sure do,” Dean laughed out loud. Of course Bela was right by Rowena’s side, where else would she be? “Thanks for this, Cas.”
“Sammy, you need to find someone more permanent than a one-night stand.” He wasn’t judging, he just wanted his little brother to be happy. Dean was living the domestic dream for almost half his life now and he wanted that for Sam, too. “I know your work is important but you could find a balance.”
“I’m hot-headed but I’m not stupid,” Dean scoffed. “Yeah, I was pissed that Roman couldn’t take no for an answer, but I wouldn’t have killed him for it. Imagined strangling him a couple times, sure, but it was more therapeutic than seriously considering it.”
“You were right, it’s Roman,” Dean told Crowley, the first part with obvious reluctance. The flash of a smug smile was there only for a moment, though.
So they got up and ready to go downstairs. Kate and her husband, Ralph were already in the little dining room, along with a young couple, the woman with a baby on her lap. Cas and Dean took a table at the corner.
Cas was also a sentimental idiot. He wouldn’t let Dean damage his car. He wouldn’t flip out like Dean would if Baby got so much as a scratch, but he really wouldn’t be happy with Dean and that always had uncertain and tiring consequences (mostly paired with weeks – weeks! – without sex) until he got what he wanted.
“They would wait at least until it’s dark,” Dean shrugged. “But I’d wanna leave before that, if it’s not much trouble.”
Cas’ crazy new sex drive was an amazing thing and not like their bedroom activities had ever been boring but now they reached another level of awesomeness. Dean was already planning to get away at the next opportunity to buy a new set of panties just to see how it would affect Cas.
“I know. Religion was something we never agreed on.” He hesitated for a moment. “You should probably get out of this while you can.”
“Fine, we’re coming.” Cas didn’t need much more incentive as he started towards the house, looking back over his shoulder expectantly. Dean hung up and hurried after him.
“We talked about it, guys,” Dean drawled out as he neared them. “Don’t let strangers into the house.”
“Talk to Sam,” he said lowly. “I’ll call Benny and tell him we’re skipping today. I won’t leave the house because we don’t know what the hell could happen and you need an outsider to talk to. I trust Sam.”
“You’re all broody and dramatic and I don’t like it,” Dean stood up. “So yeah, you’re coming with me.” He turned to Sam whose lips were doing a bad job at containing a grin. “Meet you at the motel later, Sammy.”
“Thanks, Cas,” he lifted Cas’ hand to his mouth and pressed the fingers to his lips. Cas’ face turned a little pink at the touch.
Both of Bobby’s eyebrows jumped high and his mouth opened a bit but that was the most floored expression he was probably capable of. It took him a moment, but then he cleared his throat.
They found a bar on the coast of Whitefish Lake. It was full of patrons, the smell of cigarette and cheap drink filling the place. Dean’s shoulders relaxed slightly. Maybe he could hustle someone if they were lucky. That would give him an adrenaline rush. And maybe Cas’ angelic precision could come in handy.
The plan was simple. The brothers would try to keep the demons occupied and in place as much as possible until Cas could smite them one by one.
“Me?” Dean asked incredulously. How had they come to that conclusion? He doubted Roman had told anyone about his obsession with Cas.
There were four of them, he realized when he followed Cas into what once must have been a storeroom: concrete walls, couple crates in one corner, the main entrance big enough for a truck. The demons looked ordinary enough, two men and two women in simple clothes and apparently in the middle of some kind of party, if the number of beer and tequila bottles were any indication.
“Angel,” Cas read aloud the title of the chapter. His brow arched in disbelief and Dean couldn’t help but mirror his reaction. “You’ve gotta be kidding me.”
“Can’t promise anything,” Dean grinned after him and Sam gave him the middle finger over his shoulder as he walked out of the dining room and towards the stairs.
His brother was asking about where they were and reporting that he'd just dropped Claire and Jack off at school. Dean texted back quickly. They had agreed previously that they would speak of Roman only in person and Dean wasn’t idiot enough to google the guy for news.
The wide eyes narrowed, a frown appearing on Cas’ forehead as he tilted his head a bit like a bird. It was kinda adorable. He hadn’t moved otherwise.
He pulled on his robe and started downstairs without switching up the lights. Just before he left the bedroom, he saw a shadow move outside.
He started pacing while he talked so Dean couldn’t make out what Charlie had said, but Cas hung up with a quiet “Thank you,” after a minute.
The orgasm washed over Dean like a tidal wave, drowning him completely, sweeping him away. He was faintly aware that he was cursing and screaming and Cas’ name was in there somewhere, too. His back arched off the bed and the Alpha’s shoulders would be a total mess from his nails clawing at them.
“Do you need any help?” he turned his fond look away from his husband to watch as Bess was ready to take out the next set of snacks.
“Your life is miserable. Pointless. Just a blink for someone as old as me.” Dean noticed he was talking about the angels and the humans both like he didn’t belong to them. “But you keep going. There’s love and loyalty and forgiveness. Creativity and free will.” He took a deep breath. “I was watching over humanity for too long. I started to feel. To doubt – you’re God’s most perfect creations, why would He let you suffer so much? Asking things like that is pretty much a death sentence. I fell.”
Dean walked to the side door that was leading to the reception area and from there to the little office behind it, Cas on his heels.
The door opened with a loud creaking noise and Dean blocked the gun pointed at his head before it was fully open. There was a loud bang as the bullet glanced off the railing and Dean was already twisting the wrist in his grasp, pressing his thumb on the pressure point on the inside of it to make the weapon clatter to the ground.
The hunter swallowed the mix of arousal and unease clogging his throat even if he was sure his scent betrayed him. How could Cas be so hot while threatening him?
Cas kept up the torture for another minute or two – time seemed a bit irrelevant and blurred together anyway – before he pulled off with a loud, lewd
“So get this, I went over the names after decoding them. Your reporter was smart, by the way, he probably came up with this code himself.” He paused. “Dean, did you know Bobby –”
“I want to know what the hell that was all about!” Bela screamed, just a hairsbreadth from freaking out.
His husband disappeared with a flap of wings and a couple seconds later was back with the Colt in question, handing it over without a word. Dean thanked him with a quick kiss, hiding it in his waistband.
He hardly finished the sentence when the lights started flickering and the wind took up outside, rattling the whole building with its power. The air became heavier, charged with electricity like there was a storm coming. It was ominous and Dean felt the hair on his arms standing on end. He sidled closer to the wall. Cas walked into the middle of the place, his eyes meeting briefly with the brothers'.
“And when we’re out of here and I’m not mad at you anymore, I’m kissing you,” Cas said with an expression that could be seen on people talking about the weather.
“Mostly. It’s hard to say. I have my wings back and those were about the only things I missed.” He grimaced. “I feel like I’m overcharged and I can explode anytime.” He gestured at Dean’s form on the bed ruefully. “That’s why you’re here. I didn’t trust myself in healing you more than what was absolutely necessary. It was pretty clumsy work, but in my defense, I was trying not to blow up everything in a mile radius.”
“Good to know,” Bobby grumbled. He seemed more relaxed, so he had probably worried a bit, too. “I’ll call Lily while you finish that up. Tell her what’s up with you,” he glanced at Cas.
His eyes met Sam’s across the table and his brother smiled at him which Dean returned easily. Even if it was just for a brief time, because life seemed to fuck them over constantly, he felt safe and happy and he hoped it would last a while. For now, he didn’t have to deal with dangerous situations but he certainly couldn’t say that his life was boring. He’d just have to carry on and see.
“That’s true,” his husband admitted. “But I thought we could stop for an actual lunch. You didn’t eat much yesterday except what we bought at that Gas-n-Sip. And I hear bacon sizzling downstairs.”
“We can take baby steps, we’ve done that before,” he suggested. Before Cas could’ve objected, he continued, “I’m not saying that we should go in full-time, that’s just suicide. But we can do a little recon, then tell Charlie about it. If they are brave enough to go against angels, maybe they have something permanent against demons.”
“You practically dragged him through history,” Naomi sighed. “Your siblings are more mission-oriented, even if they don’t know they’re doing it. Not you. Every single time, the moment you meet Dean, you’re changed forever. And he always finds you. We’ve come to peace with this a long time ago.”
“Fair enough,” Dean frowned. He took a deep breath. “Okay, what if we get the hell out of here but wait for them when I think they’ll come. We can spend those two hours at a public place. Early dinner? Then we come back, you see that I’m right and we can get the fuck out of town.”
Before he could answer (Dean was sure he had a couple other reasons up his sleeve that would grant him alone time with Cas), a painful groan interrupted their talk.
Or almost. A battered trench coat was thrown over the back of the chair and Dean grinned to himself. Damn angels.
“Never woulda missed it,” Dean smiled at him. He had a soft spot for Garth, willingly or not. The guy had that effect on people.
The tree was incredible. It was like a Disney movie, really. Almost the middle of a forest, a perfectly circular glade full of wild flowers with the damn oak in the center of it, sun shining through the branches. There were tall evergreens all around them.
“Cas, do you know what’s wrong with this country?” Sam leaned a bit forward, his eyes shining in a weird way scarily similar to when he’d been high on Demon Blood.
They sketched out the plan as much as they could without actually getting into detail, while they cleaned up after dinner. Honestly, Dean was getting tired. It was a long day and his injury didn’t help matters.
“Bobby,” he murmured into his palms before jumping up to start pacing across the room. He wanted to smash something, destroy the whole damn room in his anger but he couldn’t afford it, not now.
He reached the top of Cas’ pants after spending some time on his tattoo, beautiful hipbones peeking out and damn, had he missed them. He sucked a bruise on one, hands fitted perfectly on the Alpha’s lower back, fingers dipping under the waistband. The fist in his hair tightened, not enough to hurt, just to send a thrill down his spine.
“Thank you, Mr. Winchester, please hold for your representative,” said the woman on the other end of the line.
“You’re awesome,” he breathed against Cas’ jawline, lingering for a moment. There was a rustling sound at Cas’ back, a flash of rainbow-colored feathers obscuring Dean’s vision for a moment, a sure sign of Cas’ happiness.
They spent most of their time together but somehow this almost aimless cruising was freeing and Dean had really missed it.
Dean looked back with as much venom as he could muster but his thoughts wandered over to how the light was casting shadows on Cas’ face, making his eyes a beautiful crystalline blue. God, he really wasn’t fit to drive. Fuck.
“He sprained his elbow when he tried to distract the vampire but otherwise he’s alright,” Cas nodded, finally looking at him. His gaze was… off, somehow, his voice reserved. “Visiting hours are over so he went back to Bobby’s.”
If you liked this little fic and want to know what's gonna happen next, I have the sequel up as well. Thank you for reading, it means a lot.
The door opened in a couple moments, not far from the break room where a couple agents were having coffee.
“Dean, he looks at you like you’re the angel of the two of you,” Sam said like it was obvious. “Look, it’s not my business –”
“Nice to meet you, Mr. and Mr. Winchester,” Lily held out her hand. “Thank you for not landing inches away from me this time.”
“Where’s the Impala?” Cas asked as he parked the car halfway on the sidewalk like the driver had lost control over it. Damn, the guy was adaptive.
“Today. And yesterday. And the last twenty years,” Cas smoothed his thumb over the freckles on his cheek. “Thank you, Dean.”
And… there. Just before Victor took a step aside he pressed the key to the cuffs in Dean’s palm. Dean had to try really hard not to grin, nodding at Cas.
“Yeah, that’s his name. Castiel Novak. He’s a professor on occult and religious studies at the University of –”
“I was going to English Literature and the classroom is on the other side of the schoolyard, you know?” Jack started. “I was going through the yard and I saw Harper talking to a guy in a red jacket. They seemed to be arguing and then he grabbed her. So I walked over and asked what was going on. Then he just jumped on me and I hit back to protect myself. When Principal Shurley spotted us, he ran away and Harper disappeared by then, too.”
The hall was large and white, but the furniture was mostly made from dark wood, probably amaranth, going from the slightly purplish hue. There was an elegant staircase just on their left and a huge dining room on their right with large windows.
“I love you, too, Dean,” Cas said it back because he always did before he leaned down to press his lips to Dean’s.
Dean sighed and pushed Ash’s chair to the side with him in it so he could stand right behind the desk.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” her voice was much cooler and more collected. She opened the purse with a flick of her fingers.
Jack and Claire took seats at the nearest table and Dean walked down a couple rows of bookshelves until he found the office. It was open and empty.
He was probably right. What were the chances of those Men of Letters turning up in Santa Clarita anyway?
“Okay, uh,” Sam searched for a moment through the file before pulling out a sheet of paper. “Yeah, according to old school records all of you have high IQ and almost no absence from school. Mostly clean medical records.”
the pants, not out of them. Cas most likely understood because he had an amused glint in his eyes as Dean put the yellow helmet on.
The others didn’t talk much, but he always knew what was going on. Bela told her campaign speech with her usual wit and charm while Rowena and Crowley, who were in the ball room with the other guests, bantered quietly.
Their two hours were up before he knew it and they were soon walking back to the Impala. The streets were mostly empty already, they only saw a passerby or two and a couple cars. The air was cold and windy, not really a time for a walk.
It was almost past two and both of them were ready to give up when something changed. Maybe it was the wind or their monster liked hunting late. Whatever it was, it brought the smell they were waiting for. Sam signed him he got it, too, and they slowed into a stalk, gun at the ready.
He didn’t expect Cas to come impossibly closer and push in for a gentle, breathtaking kiss. Dean’s brain shut down immediately, his eyes closing without his permission, air getting stuck on a sharp inhale. The soft touch of Cas’ chapped lips, his scent everywhere and Dean had missed this so much he wanted to cry.
His father had let them find themselves through hobbies, had bought Sam’s first law book when the kid was twelve, payed for Dean’s piano lessons, and any trophy or award they had gotten in school had gone on a shelf in the living room. The only thing John Winchester had been adamant about his sons learning had been how to handle weapons.
Of course, he wasn’t just training with Cas, they had sneaked away to quiet corners for languid make-out sessions and spent a good amount of time on the porch talking about anything that came to mind – Dean was surprised to say that he hadn’t had such an honest relationship with anyone who wasn’t part of his family. The nights were mostly filled with awesome sex and cuddling.
“Crowley,” Cas greeted him and he already seemed exasperated. Dean reluctantly admired him for it. Facing a demon still made every hair on his neck stand on end.
“You should’a use your nose, asshole,” he gave back a cocky grin. “I’m taken. You’ve got no chance in hell, so just fuck off.”
“Walker?” Cas scoffed in displeasure and Dean could imagine how his nose scrunched up like always when he was offended. “They think it’s
As soon as Dean was in, the door closed behind him with a bang and he found himself in what could only be described as a throne room. There was a dais straight across him, pillars leading the way there, and a high-backed, carved chair – really, it was a throne, what the fuck? – standing proudly at its center.
“We can always move,” Dean admitted. “To Nebraska. Nobody would look for us in Nebraska. There’s nothing there.”
Cas was there, Dean knew his touch, felt the press of his lips against his hairline. God, Dean loved him so much and he hadn’t told him, Cas didn’t know and fuck, why couldn’t he talk. Where had all the air disappeared to?
Three men and a blonde woman were standing at the edge of the clearing, all of them wearing wicked grins.
Like clockwork, a white limo pulled into the building and stopping on the other side of Dean’s than Henriksen’s had, followed by a jeep with a heavy machine gun on it, a thug standing at it at the ready.
“Calm down.” Pamela didn’t seem fazed (probably the only one), but it was obvious she was trying to get the control back.
“I don’t see why we should change the plan,” Rowena tilted her head a little. “Just one more men to shoot.”
“Says the one who lighted up the curtains in our first apartment because he was playing with his lighter,” he crossed his arms.
“Why?” He could see Cas’ agitated expression from the corner of his eyes. “This is because of the wall thing?” he guessed.
Now Cas rolled his eyes. This was getting a little bizarre. They acted a little too chummy with each other. Judging from Sam’s suspicious eyes he felt the same.
Cas’ eyebrows shot up in surprise as he shook it. He probably remembered Dean’s bitching about how his brother had been out of the life.
“We still had to check if she’s got a chip or something like that, but otherwise yes,” Cas smiled at them. “Dad named her Miracle.”
“I just keep it safe, darling,” Crowley arched a brow and the thing disappeared. “It has my boss’ name on it.”
“You kidding me,” Dean grinned, his heart suddenly jumping up to his throat. He held himself back of kissing Cas until they were sitting. “You’re a sap.”
“That shit,” Cas leveled him with a glare, “saved your life, Dean. You were dying before my eyes and your blood was everywhere and –” The lights flickered briefly on the ceiling as his hands curled into fists, scent betraying how upset the image made him. “I couldn’t let you die.”
“Please, sit down, Mr. Winchester,” Valente gestured at the couch and waited until both Dean and Cas obeyed. Neither of them were trying to be intimidating, casually leaning against Dean’s desk. “There will only be a couple things we’d like to know. This is more of a routine questioning than anything.”
“Man, you can’t keep her in your sight forever,” he said into the phone as he paid for the groceries. He was getting out of research by going to the store. Sammy wanted rabbit food, Bobby beer. Why he bought anything for Sam was a mystery, because his little brother sure as hell never brought him pie. “She’s twelve. A sleepover’s not the end of the world.”
“You alright?” Dean sat down in his vacated seat, scooching closer so his knees were knocking into Cas’.
“My grace is in angel hands,” Cas told them as soon as they were in hearing distance. “No human or demon could’ve touched it. So we have to let them find me.”
Great. At least Dean didn’t have to worry about being a good husband and dad more than he already had.
“Really?” That was news for Dean. Yeah, Cas had been horny but that wasn’t completely out of character for him.
Cas was back in a couple minutes, flashing Dean a brief smile and handing over a Styrofoam cup and a ham sandwich.
“Castiel –” he pleaded, his voice little more than a whisper, but Cas heard him anyway, pulling Dean impossibly close and taking him in his hand, jerking him off with tight, quick strokes.
And Jack was… Jack. The purest soul out there, adorable in his seriousness, fiercely loving and protective if the need arose.
Sam already had a silver knife in his hand, and he cut the bitch’s neck successfully before she tossed him at the nearest tree. There was a low thud as his head bumped into the bark of it and he crumpled soundlessly. Dean instantly saw red and he growled protectively as he emptied the whole clip into her back. She howled in pain before sagging to the ground, one of the fallen flashlights shining on the growing pool of blood seeping from under her.
With his guardian angel and future mate in the passenger seat he cracked up the radio and pulled out onto the street.
“I wouldn’t heal her completely, I’m not stupid, Dean,” Cas looked back at him. “Just enough to get her out of here in a day or two.”
“Let’s get home and I’ll tell you about it,” Dean suggested. He didn’t want to be here when the MoL showed up.
“I don’t have it. You know I’m not lying,” Cas shrugged and gave them a cursory glance. “But neither do you,” he hummed thoughtfully.
“Kevin worked at a library, right?” Cas frowned. “Could it be a classification for a section there?”
“The guy with the ugly coat?” Dean felt insulted on Cas’ behalf. Who was this douchebag to criticize his fashion sense? “You can do better than that, baby.”
“We’re not that bad,” he argued. He heard the front door open with a loud creak and a broad smile crept onto his face. He saw Sam and Charlie share a glance. “Shut up.”
It turned into a kind of small talk they’d had countless of times with new people. Now Dean couldn’t really relax into it because every question in their direction sounded like he was sitting in an interrogation where every word could be the end of them and he was freaking the fuck out. The only reason he hadn’t made an excuse to get out of here was Cas’ steady presence at his side, his knee pressing into Dean’s thigh reassuringly. He couldn’t even enjoy the meal properly, but Cas was pretty good at pretending he did.
Cas walked over to the demon’s corpse – because it was a corpse, it was dead – and calm as a cucumber pulled out the knife with a disgusting squelching sound.
Before he could’ve even start to panic, the door of the cabin opened and Dean exhaled loudly in relief for more reasons at once.
Cas was out of the room as soon as Dean straightened up, pulling him out with a hand on Dean’s good arm, hardly letting him close the door behind them.
“What?” Dean looked at him in surprise as they stepped in and the door closed and Dean pressed the button of P1.
“Stop, Cas, I’m –” he took a deep breath and didn’t look the other man in the eyes. “I didn’t mean it like that.”
“Give him time,” he said to Sam. “He’s gotta process it.” He looked down at the book. “You think that could actually work?”
He let Cas go and contemplated getting his gun from the bedroom. He wouldn’t have the guts to kill another human being, but it could still be useful if it came down to it.
“Sleep, love,” Cas’ soothing voice rumbled in his ear and a light, lingering kiss was pressed on the back of his neck. “I’m here.”
” Charlie directed him after he was in, walking down the corridor confidently, not running into anyone. “
“You stay out here,” he shepherded them out of the room and closed the door on the body. They could deal with that later.
“If we were on a road trip, we would avoid the interstate,” he pointed out. “We should use back roads.”
He only had enough presence of mind to pull the blade out, the body bleeding out on the ground before he had to turn away or risk throwing up on it. That would’ve been ugly.
They had slept (well, Dean slept) in the same bed, in the house they shared, a strange mix of the Bunker’s structure and a two-story farmhouse, snuggling close and sharing simple touches and lingering kisses until Dean had fallen asleep just looking into Cas’ eyes. Then one time he just hadn’t wanted to stop, had pressed tight against Cas and kissed him stupid, a hand shyly sneaking into the angel’s pajama pants and had started stroking him with unsure movements that had become more firm after getting used to the feeling. The way Cas panted and whined into his mouth, too distracted to even kiss back, hips thrusting into Dean’s palm and fingers grabbing onto any bare skin he’d found had left Dean himself breathless and turned-on beyond belief because Cas was beautiful and powerful and trusting and
“There’s a loophole for everything.” He already seemed to be deep in thought, pulling a heavy tome from a shelf.
Waving goodbye to Bobby the next day was followed by a long and strenuous car ride. They did make it to California in just two days, sometimes using the interstate, not really trying to play into their cover anymore. The sun felt good on his face and it was just setting when Cas parked Baby on their driveway.
“If you need any help with anything, just ask,” Cas added. Dean threw an arm around his shoulders, itching to finally get out of here.
There was an ambulance waiting in the otherwise empty area, just where Sam had told them he would be. Dean could also see his brother in the driver’s seat, but something wasn’t right. Both of his hands were on the wheel, looking straight ahead and… was that a gauze plug in his nose?
Dean took that in with a glance, then stopped to look at Cas’ beautiful face properly and wanted to laugh because Cas didn’t seem scared or subdued. No, he was royally pissed-off, back straight, head held high, his deep eyes blazing with fury, lips pressed into a thin line. He was the most amazing thing Dean had ever seen and he just couldn’t look away for a couple seconds, the stress of the last couple of days leaving him.
The growl torn from Cas’ throat was booming and probably would’ve scared anyone shitless, but he hadn’t let go of Dean. Sam echoed it, and when had Sam joined them?
“I’m not an idiot, Dean,” Cas rolled his eyes. “I’m going to take a long shower, then I’ll just sit here, playing on my phone.”
“It wasn’t easy,” he admitted. Dick Roman falling to the ground with his empty eye-sockets flashed in his mind. “But we worked through it.”
Jack was sitting in a chair on this side of the desk, looking a little bit lost, like he wasn’t sure why he was here, either. He seemed fine.
“Charlie, calm down,” he said. “I’m alright, okay? I’m fine.” A pause. “Actually, I need to ask a favor.”
There was a moment of complete silence then Cas came closer, scent losing its edge and turning into something soothing with that hint of honey Dean adored.
“Alright,” she said and Dean’s jaw almost dropped open in shock. “But I want to know if we need to kill people because Dad turned into a zombie.”
The drive back to South Dakota was long and tiring even when they took shifts behind the wheel. Dean sent Cas’ list to Sam so he could buy anything Bobby didn’t have.
Dean opened his mouth to argue, but then he actually thought about it. Whoever was chasing them was powerful. Powerful enough to have more than one unit at their back-and-call. There was no guarantee they wouldn’t be found sooner or later. He really would need to be top of his game. But he needed the info.
“I love it,” she answered, a frown appearing between her brows as she focused on the needle. “I love the quiet. The routine.” A tiny smirk appeared on her lips. “Well… I do get a bit restless sometimes. I take the odd contract on the side.” She shrugged. “I just can’t stop.”
Dean finally opened his eyes and was met with the sun shining through the guest room window. He sat up.
“Yes,” Cas nodded and made a movement with his hand, like he was knocking. Sign language. Since when had Cas known sign language? “I volunteer there. I helped you heal.”
Dean kept Cas close all the way across the road and up to their own house, senses on high alert, almost expecting an attack on their backs, but nothing happened.
“Fellas, help me out, here,” Dean found the nearest EMTs who were standing just a couple feet from the metal detector, keeping his head down the whole time. Cas waited for him, the case where they’d put the Guatemala file in one hand, the other hovering over Dean’s waist as they walked away from the crowd.
“Weaknesses, Charlie,” Dean listened carefully. Charlie had hacked into Henriksen’s file and they had to be quick in reading it before someone noticed Charlie was in the system. Again. “Family, friends, favorite Golden Girl, anything.”
His Alpha made sure he was slicked up before pushing inside slowly, watching Dean’s every reaction even when his mouth opened in pleasure. He shouldn’t have to worry, the Omega opened up to him without a hitch and Dean felt full in more ways than one and fuck, he'd missed this.
Dean slid down to the floor, his head tipped back against the wall. It was almost over. They just had to reach Sam.
“Uncle Bobby has a lot of books on obscure and mythical subjects,” Jack said, looking like he was putting it together as he spoke.
Roman walked by both and stopped next to a polished record-player fixed to the wall. He pressed play.
“Guatemala?” Ash’s eyes went a little glassy as he went through the ops in his head. “Yeah, I think I can help you.”
