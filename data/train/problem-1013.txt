From there it just seemed very natural to let things proceed as they would, Mrs Hudson and brunch forgotten. John and Sherlock stood there and kissed, standing in the debris of the present opening, holding one another and just being together. Kisses grew heated and were joined by caresses, each man eager to touch and familiarize himself with that which had recently been off limits. Sherlock, ever impatient, finally dragged John right into his bedroom where the rest of the day became quite noisy, and a bit damaging to Sherlock’s bed which broke after the third repeat of their initial endeavour. Laughter arose briefly before the mattress was hastily dragged right onto the floor so that the lovers could continue to use their bodies to demonstrate the vastness of the feelings and devotion they felt for one another.
rather delightful, so I understand her appreciation of them, but poor form getting pregnant, Mary. You’re a nurse, you have access to birth control, do you not, or did you think John wouldn’t notice that the woman he hadn’t bred was pregnant? Also, where do you find the time to service so many alphas at once? Group sex? Lines? Oh, I know, you have one of those ticker-tape number thingies…I bet you have to replace
“Oh?” David said mildly, his swings at Sherlock becoming less aggressive. He stepped back unexpected, dropping his arms and sheathing his weapon. “Then you don’t need my help. I’m a bit surprised what with all the begging for it you did earlier today. I guess I’ll just take my gun and go home.”
“He’s been bitten.” John snapped out. He was filled with indescribable jealousy and fury.
drugs! He was doing research! Look, you saw all the equipment on the sidewalk.
As a flatmate, Sherlock had initially supplied the scenario where John could fight, followed by the need to flee authorities and their burgeoning suspicions. Sherlock had directly taken care of John’s need to feed by bringing him to his favourite Chinese for a very late dinner, but in all their years together, Sherlock had not taken care of one of John’s most cherished basic needs – the need to fuck. This week had been a busy one, the last three cases they’d worked had ended with rather vigorous tussles, an extended chase for one of them, and being chased in return before Lestrade finally showed up to pull his weight. John was
Two more weeks went by and Sherlock’s energy output only increased. He obeyed Danny implicitly when it came to food and rest, but otherwise listened to no one about how hard he was driving himself. His entire focus was on tracking John down, Sherlock wasn’t interested in anything else. Sex was no longer a part of their lives, not even kisses or cuddles. Sherlock and Danny slept together, but that was it, neither man seemed interested in physical gratification when there was so much information to sort through. They were driven. When he had enough information to act on, Sherlock began to do what he did best – legwork.
promise, in front of anyone you see fit to witness it. If you’d have me, Sherlock, I’d marry you right here and now, and announce it to the entire planet.”
John laughed softly and tilted his head up. There was no reason not to so John just moved the rest of the way and kissed Sherlock’s mouth gently, “No, I don’t mean it literally but I do mean it sincerely.” His second kiss wasn’t nearly as gentle as the first but Sherlock didn’t seem to mind at all, “Everything is better when you’re around, so, stay around, you know, for me?”
“Has he moved out?”
Sherlock still wasn’t moving as fast as he was used to, so he was surprised to see that John had commenced making lunch, had already finished doing their laundry, and had completed what little tidying Sherlock allowed in their sitting room. “Watch the chicken, yeah? I need a quick shower.” John left Sherlock to stir a large pan filled with blandly seasoned chicken bits and finely chopped veg. By the time John returned, Sherlock had added the curry sauce John had reluctantly chosen, and was plating up. “Curry before sex?”
Women were kind to him when they finally saw it, and complimented him, but he knew the truth – they were just being polite because while his prick was tiny, his oral skills in bed were what he used to make up for what he lacked elsewhere. If he couldn’t satisfy a woman with his nubbin then he could at least do so with his tongue.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft sounded reluctant, “Lisa is married.”
an idiot. He walked for an hour before he called another cab. He checked his wallet but his credit card wasn’t in it. Cursing, John recalled that Mary had used it to order some bedding and he doubted that she would give it back without more fuss. He’d have to cancel it tomorrow, but it meant that he could not get a hotel tonight. He didn’t have much more folding cash on him, so he found an ATM on the way and withdrew the maximum amount allowable. John divided it into three parts, kept some in his wallet, some in his duffle, and some in his left sock. He’d been around the world enough to know that a person on the street was a target, and he had to prepare himself for the possibility that he might be out on the street for good. He’d burned every bridge he’d had. John was so unhappy. Everything in his life had changed from being full of healing hopefulness to complete emotional disaster.
“Yes, Sherlock, yes, that. I’ll give you that. Let me.” John’s voice was broken and thick with emotion, “I need it. I need you. You…” John lost his words when Sherlock accidentally contracted around him, his body spasming slightly as the unfamiliar pleasure grew, “Oh god!” Suddenly, John grasped Sherlock’s torso and twisted them around. Now Sherlock was sitting on John’s cock, his knees on the bed, John’s hips beneath him, “Ride me.”
John tried to ignore it.  He needed to focus, to put all distractions aside. His comparatively nose-deaf beta girlfriend, Mary, was just re-seating herself and he forced himself to focus on her. She deserved it. He had been so ill and disconnected when they’d met but she’d helped him through it all until he was back on his feet and functional once more. John barely recalled how their relationship had begun, but it had solidified over the last year, mostly due to Mary’s unusual persistence. He was very grateful to her for being so patient, so focused. She was the one who had convinced him to try, even though she wasn’t an omega. He was fairly certain they could work out all their possible problems together because she was just that good for him.
“Yeah, er, what are your return policies if he hates it?” She laughed and gave him a gift receipt just in case it didn’t fit Sherlock exactly right, or if the red piping along the seams didn’t match his lovely shoes, though Kiran was pretty certain that it did. John took it home and stuck the box into Sherlock’s wardrobe beneath the box holding the shoes. John felt that Sherlock might prefer to try it on alone, no pressure, and double-checked to make sure the receipt was right on top.
Sherlock tried to ignore the endless emotional isolation he felt, tried to ignore the increasingly strident demands his transport was making.
Sherlock bit his lip to hold back a large grin, “Very true.”
“Liar. You are indeed taking medication but it’s not helping. You are 20% lighter than you ought to be. Your skin, hair, fingernails, and muscle-tone tell me that you haven’t lost this weight recently, it’s been ongoing for well over a year, possibly two. You’ve been incrementally denying yourself. You have insomnia as well but utilize chemical sleep aids to overcome it. John, what is going on?” For a moment, Sherlock’s mask slipped at he looked older, more tired, unhappy, and worried.
Sherlock rolled his eyes because it was clear that unlike the
They kept walking. Sherlock was deliriously happy and wanted their walk to last forever but John wound them around until they were back at Baker Street stamping the snow off their shoes before going in. It was over, and now he was sad. John would go back to pining for Mary and Sherlock would die lonely and unfulfilled.
“You’re not with me for
Sherlock felt his face heat with a blush at the coarseness of John’s words but also with more than a hint of arousal. “Really, John,” he scoffed.
It was all far too fast, a bit too rough, incredibly delightful feeling, but before Sherlock was really ready, the sex was over. He lay there, covered in a sheen of exhausted sweat, his penis still deep inside John’s arse, while the doctor gasped for air and shook with the aftershocks of what had been a loud and earnest orgasm. “I think I only lasted for about three minutes.” The words from his mouth were rough and hoarse. Gingerly, Sherlock pulled his still fairly firm cock from John’s tight grip. “Sorry.”
With a voice filled with concerned pity, Harry said, “John, you do realize that you refer to 221 B Baker Street as
It took all of Sherlock’s acting skills to remain limp and pliant long enough for John to fall deep into slumber. His mind was swimming at John’s stunning revelation. Now he was glad he had shammed sleep, there was no way he could have dealt with such a declaration whilst needing to remain conscious. He felt dizzy and needed time to process the broad scope of thoughts and feelings he was simultaneously experiencing right then. Recalling John’s wish, Sherlock eventually turned over, encouraging John to spoon up behind him, making sure to wriggle back so that his bottom was firmly placed over John’s very substantial bulge. It was oddly calming, a promise for something they both wanted that would still be there later. Without hesitation, John wrapped his arm about Sherlock’s torso and continued holding him as if he’d spent every night of his life doing so.
faithful even though Sherlock had left him under a cloud of suspicion and anger. There was one point he felt the need to mention, “You were married once already. It didn’t go well.”
“Fine, Dr Frankenstein.” Danny collapsed elegantly onto the sofa, casually sprawling across the cushions, “Nice place. I have a nice place too, but due to a series of unfortunate events, I can’t access it right now. Don’t ask, it’s complicated.”
“John, yes, oh fuck yes!” Sherlock’s cries were ecstatic, so without hesitation, John began to fuck his omega hard and fast, ruthlessly pounding into his body. Sherlock was wet with slick, his body producing copious amounts of it to aid John’s quest. His entrance was stretched tight, a pale pink ring that engulfed John hungrily, “Bite me, alpha, breed me! Bond me!”
It didn’t matter though because he seemed to want was to be near John, alone, and John seemed to want the same. Due to the injuries, the amount personal care that was in the hands of strangers was embarrassing, even though John did his best to do everything himself. Having someone literally willing to wipe your arse for you out of love was a very humbling thing. John had apparently quit his job at the clinic to remain by Sherlock’s side day and night, his devotion to his best friend clear to absolutely everyone. Since they shared a blood-type, Sherlock was only partially surprised to hear that the transfusions he’d required had mainly come from his best friend. John was within Sherlock on a cellular level, sustaining him. It was a heady realization.
Sherlock gave him the first genuine smile that John had seen from him in months, “If you want, John. I hope you succeed.” He paused again, “I’m really happy you’re back, John.” John felt something glowing pleasantly inside his chest as he returned Sherlock’s smile, their eyes meeting steadily for a long moment.
“I want to fuck you.”
Moving back to 221 B Baker Street was the most uplifting thing John had ever done in his lifetime. Sherlock explained that he’d finally received his entire inheritance and that was why he was able to spend so much on furnishings, rent, and other expenses. John had some income, and it wasn’t paltry, but Sherlock wouldn’t hear of him laying out any cash for the core expenses for the flat.
John went to the kitchen and washed up. He didn’t want to do it in the morning, not when he had to take an early train just to drop Rosie off with Harry for the day so that he could go to work. Just because he was living at Sherlock’s didn’t mean he could quit his job. He still had a future to save toward, and a child to plan for. With a sigh, John put the leftovers in the fridge in a container, destined for his lunch on the morrow. Glancing out the kitchen window, he spotted the security detail sitting down the block. There were two of them today.
“Mycroft,” Sherlock demanded, “I want Mycroft.”
I’ll always be nearly a decade younger than you.”
“It’s not, and even if it were, I’ve just had my heat. I won’t have another one for two months at minimum, more likely four. It’s difficult to parse due to my…issues.” Sherlock sounded like this was the last conversation he wanted to have, “He can’t stay like this, Mycroft, it’s not right.”
“What’s going on?” DI Lestrade was at Sherlock’s shoulder, peering through the same space and eyeing John suspiciously, “Does someone need a talking to?”
Mary had characteristics he didn’t care for, like how much perfume she wore. His sense of smell was second only to an omega’s and too much too often would deaden it. Some days when he came home it would smell as if she’d bathed in the stuff. Everything smelled of it, even their sheets. Still, that was a pretty minor grievance. Overall, she was pretty, quite clever, and funny, and she tried to be what he needed.
John would pay good money to witness someone trying to set Sherlock up against his will, especially if they somehow managed to compel him to wear what he likely still thought of as the
enough to satisfy, and let me inform you honestly, thanks to John, I’ve never been more satisfied. Have you even managed to be with an omega, David? I’m sure Mary is very exciting to work with and to play with, but have you ever managed to seduce even one omega? There’s nothing like it, nothing to compare it to, ask John. He’s been with loads, but none finer than me. Oh dear, by the vacant look on your face I’m going to say no, you haven’t, have you? No, you just work for criminals and settling for some other alpha’s leftovers, sad little beta wanna-be-omegas with nothing left to offer but her artificial stink and an unsatisfied hunger for something better.”
about marriage but also, both old enough to make John think twice about passing up a viable long-term relationship that had domestic potential. Neither of them was getting any younger and it had made sense to ask her to be his wife. She was stable, reliable, and it was about time that he had some pups, or one, at least. They hadn’t talked about it, though Mary had hinted several times that having the pups from an alpha was about as big a dream as beta women could have since alphas chose omegas over betas for breeding purposes. She’d always made fun of bonds, calling it
He awoke hot hours later. His back was covered in sweat but he didn’t make a twitch of effort to move away because along with the heat was John’s cock. It was thick, full, and wedged right between Sherlock’s welcoming buttocks. Sherlock closed his eyes and enjoyed the sensation, a small smile curving his lips. He lay there in John’s arms and dreamed about being penetrated by it, wondering how different it would feel than his own fingers if it would hurt if John just pushed it in, or if they might have the patience to open Sherlock slowly. He wanted both. He wanted the tearing pain of entry to permanently embed itself in his mind palace as
Danny had grown even more still and tense the moment Mycroft spoke, “How did you know him?”
“On our way now.” Sherlock was grateful that Lestrade understood his needs so well. Being alone right now was the worst choice Sherlock could make. Left to his own devices, he knew it would be only a matter of hours before he found a dealer, a den, and oblivion. “When did you get the call?”
. You didn’t tell me he could cook! It smells incredible in here!” Danny was grinning, rubbing his narrow belly and bending down to peer at the baking tray, “
“Do that,” urged Sherlock, “She’s not worth your time.” Sherlock stepped closer to John, but not so close that his alpha couldn’t continue fighting the enraged beta.
“No sugar tonight.” Sherlock looked puzzled when John giggled at his answer, “What?”
Sherlock’s entrance seemed to go on forever as his long thick cock forged its way inside John’s virgin passage. He wasn’t forcing his way, John’s body was practically sucking him in. John could feel the heat of him deep inside, and he couldn’t help the whimper that escaped his lips, “John? Hurts?”
sulking
“I need to fuck you, make you mine.”
She looked at John, her face filled with compassion, “Live and let live, I always say. Welcome back, John.” She led them upstairs, and into their old rooms. The differences were jarring. All their familiar old furniture was gone, even the worn old carpet. All that remained of their once cluttered front room were the walls, the wooden floor, and the fireplace. Everything else was gone. The kitchen was entirely bare, all the appliances and tables gone, and the cupboards bare even of dust, “I sold off everything of value. My last tenants had their own things. She got pregnant so they moved off to somewhere larger, she’s having twins. It’s been empty for a good while and I had expenses.”
The pressure was incredible. Sherlock worried that John would grind his fingerbones to dust. His master was stroking his own cock now, his eyes still closed as Sherlock struggled to push three long fingers deeper. “Crook them, find my prostate but don’t poke it, just flutter around the edges.” Sherlock obeyed and listened to the deep groan that he caused his master to give, “Oh yes, that’s exactly right, pet. That’s so good.”
To her credit, Harry looked abashed. John knew for a fact that Clara was firmly single, patiently waiting for her ex-wife to get her shit together, and Harry knew it. Penitent, she said, “I get it, I understand. Sherlock probably wasn’t really on board with having you right there again, everything considered, but that still doesn’t help me understand this Danny bloke. I can’t see me encouraging an ex-girlfriend of Clara’s to move in with her, so what’s the deal with this man? There’s something more going on there.”
A chime on his mobile alerted him that someone had posted something to John’s blog. Heart sinking with prescient dismay, Sherlock saw that a photo had been added to a comment thread beneath their latest case. It was a picture of Lisa and John sitting in
Sherlock realised at some point that he’d eaten some toast with almond butter on it, and several wedges of cheese, as well as most of an orange that had been peeled and left in a pile of segments. When he checked the time, he realized that nearly twelve hours had gone by. Danny had been setting down platters of food within arm’s reach, a trick of John’s, and Sherlock had just helped himself while he’d paced or stared off into the distance. He drank the hot tea he found, and the occasional glass of water, and went back to reviewing footage. He knew that Mycroft had an entire team doing the exact same thing, but he couldn’t just
“Both?” Sherlock felt his heart fill with contentment at the happiness on John-his-friend’s face. Still, for a dark moment, Sherlock recalled
It made Sherlock want to foam at the mouth when he thought of
It still took two days more than he was prepared to deal with before Sherlock was released into John’s care. Physical therapy sessions were organised, and dietary regimes were designed, and the gradual cessation of all his meds was planned. John reluctantly left Sherlock’s side only long enough to coordinate with Anthea regarding clothing for their invalid. One short shopping trip later, Sherlock was garbed in loose flowing clothes that wrapped comfortably around his recuperating body but gave the appearance that Sherlock was dressed for a lovely walk about the park. Mycroft arranged for his best car to deliver the pair to Baker Street, considerately providing special cushions for Sherlock’s side of the vehicle.
The next morning, John got up, brushed his teeth, fed his child, dressed them both after calling the clinic to reschedule his shift to accommodate his time with Rosie, and to clear his afternoon.
Danny was
Sherlock looked up from his half crouch, “Say that again.”
“Alright then,” John was both agreeable as well as helpful. It took the better part of an hour but John managed to wrangle all of Sherlock’s scatter possessions into his room, and packed a large bag with his clothes and essentials, “Is that everything?”
you and I are together forever?”
Now John was standing right behind Sherlock, and they were both were naked. Sherlock wasn’t exactly certain when the nudity had happened, but it had, otherwise how else would his naked arse be waving around in front of their fireplace? John was doing filthy things to it, but of course, he would.
“It really was.” Sherlock felt content and happy. John had gone through a lot of effort to make today pleasant and he was grateful, “What now?”
Sherlock couldn’t lie to John, not here and now, “I might in time but this is just
said…”
Gentle lips kissed his forehead. “Thank you.” Sherlock didn’t know what he was thanking the man for but instead, wrapped his arms around Danny’s thin body and held him close. He was having a hard time breathing and his heart was beating in a strange manner as if there wasn’t enough blood present to keep it functioning properly. Danny rubbed his hands up and down Sherlock’s back and it soothed him. “You knew it was him.”
. You want him back. I want you to be happy. My life is fucking shit, and it’s going to take a miracle of miracles for it ever to be right again. There’s a chance for you and I want you to get it. See, it hasn’t even been a fortnight and he’s selling his house and rushing back here to squeeze into a single room with his kid! You don’t think he couldn’t have found another situation
Later on, they met with Mycroft in his private offices at the
John crumpled, “Yes. Yes, I got married even though it was wrong of me to do so, I can see that now. Back then, though, Mary...god how she manipulated everything...the things she said, her timing was just...no, I can’t put all of it on her. I made my choices, even though the reasons for them were weak. I did it to myself because...” John kept trailing off as he floundered for words to explain, “There were so many factors and I was too stupid, too blind, and too stubborn to even try to see them. I blinded myself, trying to make a martyr of myself because of how hurt I’d been while I thought you were dead. I wanted you to hurt too, and I never allowed myself to think about everything you had already suffered. I know what kind of man I am now, and it’s not a good one. I’m a terrible person, you should never trust me, and you should definitely never marry me, but I want you to, desperately. Give me once more chance, I’m begging you, give me the chance to try and make you happy. Please, just let me try.”
Mycroft’s voice was filled with pity, “I’m sorry, Sherlock, there’s nothing I can do. This is the version of John that there is now. It might wear off eventually or perhaps this is permanent. Take him and keep him or send him away. The choice is yours.”
“Yes?” John was still reading the paper.
“You haven’t been available for some months now, John,” Sherlock reminded him sharply.
but John remembered them with shameful clarity. He now had
. Taking a careful minute, he looked himself over as best he could. He was swathed like a mummy in reels of cotton bandages. They were loosely wrapped all over him and gingerly, he tried to move his limbs. His ankles were tightly bandaged, and Sherlock could feel the pads taped to his back. Everything felt like his skin was too tight, inflexible, and reluctant to allow him motion. He didn’t push it, not wanting to damage what did indeed look like successful grafts before they were entirely healed. He needed to find out how much time had passed, and what had been done to him.
“I’m not dressed to go out.”
“Nice of you to look out for her.”
“Oh, my pretty boy, I want to. Oh, I’d love that, to fuck my come into you, and leave you wet and wanting more.”
married, in fact, I can’t even call you my boyfriend, can I? You’ve never allowed it. No one really knows we’re together, do they? With the exception of Mrs Hudson and Mycroft, both of whom only learned of this by accident, does anyone we have in common even know that we’ve been sleeping together for the last ten weeks? Does Lisa?”
what I need, and I regret so much that I make you feel so undeserving so often. You are worthy, John. It is I who is deficient.”
Sherlock managed to open one eye but he wasn’t interested in bothering with the other one. “I hate you.”
. “We weren't certain the skin grafts would take but they did,” John spoke casually as if they were just chatting, but Sherlock knew from how carefully John was holding his hand that the doctor was aware that Sherlock was in distress.
“Yes, yes, yes, you’re pissing your pants over Mycroft, I remember.” Mary scoffed openly, “He’s the real reason you want to run, don’t even pretend that it’s because we needed to kill Holmes and Watson. You seem to forget that we work for someone more dangerous than the Holmes brothers could ever be, so now that we’re on the job again, can you fucking find your testicles and put them back on again? I haven’t even got a cock and I’ve got a bigger pair that you do. Check that basement stairwell, they could have ducked into one of these closed businesses easy. Go on, move it.”
Sherlock glanced around at the once decorated walls but didn’t ask, “Bring whatever you like John, there’s storage downstairs, you know that. Rosie doesn’t take up much space, but I’m afraid the evidence board will have to remain. Danny and I are working on a case.” Sherlock wasn’t going to stop working because of John, not again.
A server came to take their order, but John had no clue what was even on the menu. He didn’t care, “Can you light our candle, please, and bring us a bottle of wine, something special.”
-best friend a best friend could be. That’s all he had of Sherlock right now, and even
“I’m not sure I understand.”
that’s something that happened on its own. This is something being forced on you. If you were bound to me like that, then spell or no, I would tie myself to in whatever way you are to me. We’re partners, Sherlock, aren’t we? Best friends? Why would I take from my friend that which I’m not also willing to give?” John grinned and looked bashful, “I’d be lying if I tried to say I didn’t love you like that. I do.”
I don’t recall but they were a very
His quick recovery time made many a man feel like the world’s best lover. Sherlock didn’t care, stroking their ego meant them fucking him hard, and that’s what he wanted, just to be fucked senseless. He kissed the soldier, momentarily dominating his mouth before eagerly relinquishing control to the older man, “Come back to mine.”
today. After he was ready for the day, he called a realtor he’d met during one of Sherlock’s many cases, and they were more than happy to give him a bit of assistance. It was a good beginning, he needed to remove himself from his misery and step into a place that was healthier.
The first full day of the conference was a whirlwind. The sessions were short but plentiful, and he’d booked the entire day. By the time evening rolled around, he’d been to seven presentations, sat in during a luncheon lecture while holding a veggie wrap that he never put to his mouth, participated in two breaks where he sipped tea and crumbled muffins into pieces without consuming even one, and now, at the second formal dinner with his assigned group, John was trying to choke down a mouthful of salad. He managed half a plate of it, but nothing else. When he got up to leave, Sherlock was frowning at him once again. Sick with guilt and regret, John fled.
“What are we talking about?”
“I am an addict. I am scarred. I am damaged goods, my John.” Sherlock turned his face away, looking ashamed of himself.
Sherlock felt even more tired just taking in this information. “How long? What happened,” he managed to get out.
John scrubbed the kitchen clean and then went into Sherlock’s bedroom to change the bedding, his ears attuned to Sherlock’s regular call-outs. Mrs Hudson had clearly kept up with her
“I practised safe sex.” John protested instantly. He made very sure to keep himself as safe as possible. He always brought his own condoms as well as lubricant and took care not to expose himself as much as possible, though there would always be risks. He felt a bit defensive for getting a talking to, and once more, the feeling of being caught out doing something that was beginning to identify itself as
“What if you can’t solve it?” It was a valid concern. Sherlock had taken apart Moriarty’s empire, but it had been disadvantaged by its wide distribution. Here in England, everything was much more entrenched, much more difficult to change or fix because of it. He may very well be unable to help Danny, but he could at least look, and help where he could. It was likely that he’d get Mycroft involved. His brother was just as much a spider that Moriarty had been, he had his own net in place, his own traps to spring. If anyone could help Danny get his life back, it would be the Holmes brothers.
John watched Sherlock’s jaw flap wordlessly for a moment before he sagged back, “You’re right.” Sherlock turned to John, “I know you were just being you and here’s me being awful all over again. I’m sorry, John.”
, okay?
that John was stepping out on him.
“You’re welcome, Sherlock.”
They were scrubbed down, swabbed from head to toe in some kind of antiseptic fluid. John’s neighbour was restrained before he was ruthlessly shaved from head to toe until he was as bald as John.
. I’m not from this world at all. I am here as a visitor, as it were, on a kind of temporary visa. I’ve only got one more year before I am compelled to go home, maybe. I was supposed to keep myself a secret, but right now, I have been caught in a most unexpected trap. The thing is, it’s very easy to get out. I need one kiss for every berry on the sprig. I count six, each need to be plucked off after each kiss is concluded. The problem with that is although the mistletoe’s hold on me will wane with each kiss, a bond with you will only grow. A normal kiss wouldn’t affect me any more than it does you, but these are
Mycroft’s mouth crooked into a momentary smile, “Bargaining. That’s a good step, John. Agreed. Go on, we’ll see you here in four hours.”
“Where is Rosie, John?” John recognized the tone of Harriet’s voice. She was making herself be very patient, and it wasn’t easy.
John drank. He knew he was in shock, that he was likely becoming dehydrated. The water quenched his thirst but also let him know that his stomach was empty. “Hello?” he called out, “Where am I? What do you want?” John strained to hear a response and felt his heart begin to pound when he heard a shuffling sound to his right. He backed away from it, pressing his body to the wall furthest from the sound. A moment later, the extremely dim light helped him see a male figure standing on the other side. The man was naked, sported a long, ragged beard and snarled hair that fell to his shoulders. He had horrific looking scars on his shoulders, lower abdomen, and along one thigh. “Who are you? Where are we?”
They spent an enjoyable hour laughing and hanging baubles onto their tree, genially arguing about placement, and indulging in far more touching than was required. Neither man remarked that their hands lingered on shoulders or backs, or that they stood so much closer than normal. John unnecessarily gripped Sherlock’s hips when the consulting detective reached up to place the tree topper he’d selected, a model of an atom that also looked like a star. It made John laugh and hold Sherlock’s hips a tiny bit tighter.
not so repellent. Anyone who knew Sherlock Holmes even a bit, and that was a rare handful, knew how differently he treated John compared to anyone else. Oh, he lied and manipulated as much as anywhere else in his life, it kept his talents sharp to do so, and frankly, John expected it, it kept his own skills honed. John was a military doctor and had a knack for winkling out information a reluctant or possibly embarrassed, patient might be trying to not refer to, and it worked on Sherlock too. John kept the detective fed, watered, and sewn back together when required, no matter the protests and complaints. Sherlock kept experiments in the fridge next to their food, and still refused to do the shopping, but John enjoyed being in control of all of that even if he didn’t get on with self-check-out. Sherlock
In the meantime, John, being as accommodating as possible, had not only set up Sherlock’s laptop beneath the bed where he could see it, but had also connected an ergonomic keyboard to it, one that split into two halves, now placed very conveniently at each of Sherlock’s hands so that he could type. John had needed to use some medical tape to secure them there, but he had. Now Sherlock could keep up with the news about scientific breakthroughs, browse the archives of a variety of research facilities, adjust information on
Sherlock opened his eye to seek her aid, “Nurse. Remove this vicious intruder and bring me my brother,
Simultaneous protests of “It’s
John felt horrible as he now saw that this was exactly what he had done. His sister was impossible to hide from, she knew him far too well, better than he knew himself. “No! I loved Mary, I did!”
When dessert was brought by, John tried not to heave at the sight of the rich creams and sugar-soaked fruits. It made him want to gag because he was so very hungry, but he just couldn’t eat. His therapist and doctors both had told him his trouble was all in his head, but that didn’t make the problem go away. John just couldn’t eat.
Sherlock had never been so excited to be wounded.
John cleared his throat, “I haven’t appreciated you, Sherlock, or thanked you properly for everything you’ve done for me if thanks are even possible. You’ve done so many incredible things for my sake, and I’ve paid you poorly for them. I didn’t ask for you to do so but that doesn’t mean I should have just shrugged it off as if it were all unimportant, it
where Sherlock is coming from. I understand
. John was
“Still.”
The fourth kiss was breathless, filled with soft gasps for air as two bodies struggled to rub together. Sherlock managed to get his hand beneath John’s button-down, yanking the tails out from his waistband to plunge his hand in. John didn’t try to stop him, merely reciprocating by grabbing two large handfuls of Sherlock’s ample backside until he remembered the berries once more. Sherlock’s fingers were on a quest, and John almost didn’t have the leg-strength to stretch up to pluck off the fifth berry, especially when one long finger found his hidden entrance and began immediately probing, much to John’s obvious enjoyment.
This world was broken, tragic, and exciting. Sherlock loved so many things about it, especially John. In this plane, facts mattered, logic existed, and magic was mere superstitious nonsense.
“Doctor Watson has invited himself to the
starving himself slowly, eating less each day that passed. His self-loathing was overwhelming his self-preservation.
Sherlock wanted to weep. He had never felt less valued. Numbly, he fetched paper-towelling from the kitchen area and cleaned up his own sick before he went into the shower to wash his body from head to toe. The second he was done brushing his teeth, John appeared. His master was holding out a clean set of pyjamas, also too small, “Do the laundry. It stinks in here.”
“He’s at Baker Street.” John looked down at his knees, “I’m just such a mess.”
for complicated.
, nutbar. When you care about other people it isn’t an effort to be considerate.” Danny actually had his hands on his hips as he scolded Sherlock.
Hours later, the last of the alcohol had worn off helped by many glasses of water and several cups of tea. John was ready to sit down and share a very late meal with his sister. He felt better than he had for months now. His head felt clearer and he felt a little more able to deal with reality. He watched his daughter for a moment. Rosie was in her highchair, earnestly colouring an entire sheet of paper blue. She’d worn her crayon down to the nub and showed no signs of stopping, “She’s fed already, I gave her a bath. All you need to do is read to her and get her ready for bed.”
Sherlock was scowling harder than ever. He looked manic, and John was taken aback by the strength of his friend’s obvious fury. “The women you rent have a high statistical probability…”
. Without further hesitation, John shed the last of his clothing and climbed onto the bed. “John. My alpha. John. Yes, I need you,
Later on, they returned to the Yard to process their prisoners. Sherlock was muttering over his laptop, seeking to make a connection he knew had to exist now that he had the information he didn’t previously have access to. He ignored everyone’s attempts to console one another regarding their shared experience, but Sherlock had no time for it, and his unwillingness had caused John, gentle caring protective John, to lose his temper and call Sherlock a heartless machine because he hadn’t stopped to spare a moment of kindness on a distraught child. It made Sherlock angry.
Sherlock’s hands stopped moving. He stood still for a minute before slowly shutting the water off and leading John from the shower. After John was dried and in a pair of clean pyjamas, Sherlock spoke again, “When you are better, John, and
The cold water chilled John just enough for him to exclaim, “I sucked you off!”
“Yours.” Mary insisted.
Sherlock couldn’t be flirting back. That just was not what was happening. Sherlock was just telling John that he’d done something strange but really, how did you quantify strangeness when it came to him?
Sherlock found himself nodding immediately.
“Please, let him live. Please, please, please.” Someone was praying softly, their voice barely above a whisper, hoarse and quiet.
home; those spaces are for
“What was the other clue?” Danny asked, “Something must have made you think it was John.”
“John has found someone else, some time ago, apparently,” he replied woodenly. “I’m going to stay with my family until I can deal with this a bit better.”
“Oh god, yes, John!” Sherlock found himself face down on the sofa in a trice, “I mean,
Ideas percolated slowly through John’s much-diminished consciousness. He wasn’t so much generating new ideas as he was responding to the stimuli he was presented. If his omega wasn’t happy then John had to try something different, or maybe, he thought, he should try something the same. Sherlock would lead the way, so all John had to do was emulate his omega.
John Watson
he breathed, his voice deep and husky, “It’s so...perfect.”
John looked extremely pleased with himself and made no effort to lead Sherlock to view other displays, content to allow the rapturous consulting detective to pore over this one, taking in every detail meticulously. After a good long while though, John’s tummy grumbled. Sherlock stood, knowing his friend would require some kind of sustenance, “Shall we?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Doctor Watson,” Mycroft was literally growling. John felt instantly chastened, and if he’d had a tail, it would have been firmly tucked between his legs. “Why are you here?”
Hours rolled by as they drowsed and eventually, Sherlock woke up. He was snuggly and happy, wriggling his way deep into John’s embrace with a smile on his face, “Happy, my angel?”
Will you give it to him? If you cannot, then I must regretfully make arrangements for an
It was awful at 221 B Baker Street. John felt cold and alone. Mrs Hudson wasn’t even there, she was still on her cruise with Mrs Turner. John took a bit of time to bin all the mouldy food now present in the fridge, considerately bagging samples of everything for Sherlock to play with later, before ordering a massive selection from his favourite Thai takeaway. John showered and shaved, and by the time his food arrived, he was re-dressed and feeling more like himself. While he ate, the silence gave him an opportunity to really think about everything that had happened since Sherlock had come back. John felt it was a bit ironic that he was the unstable one considering how much trauma that Sherlock had undergone. Yes, Sherlock had been a tad over-the-top with his recent demands but the very fact that he was alive to make them made it easy for John to remain over-indulgent with his mate. After all, he was the one who couldn’t seem to pull himself together. John felt a bit guilty for being so fragile when Sherlock had dealt with so much for so long, and he’d done it alone. That was no small feat for any gender, being an omega made it the most amazing achievement John could imagine.
The sixth and final kiss was fevered, both men tearing open their shirts and tugging down their pants until they were bared barely enough for their hard cocks to meet. Sherlock’s long arms were serving him well since he was more than able to keep his finger buried deep inside John, heaving him closer as they frotted. John fumbled around enough to rip away the final berry and fling to the floor. Sherlock groaned as he was released, and without pause, heaved John up into his arms so that the startled doctor was instinctively required to wrap his legs around Sherlock’s hips. With some strain, Sherlock carried John to his bedroom where he flung the man down onto his bed, “John, I need you, I want you so desperately.”
“I bet your bed will be very nice. I love being places you spend time in.” John was still a bit bleary but not so gone that he missed the fond and tolerant smile on Sherlock’s face, “I love you, Sherlock, you’re my very best friend. I’d marry you if you were the marrying kind, but I know you’re not, that’s why I’ve never asked, not that you’d ever settle for someone like me. Don’t tell yourself, okay, it’s a secret that I’ve been completely gone on you for years now. Shhh.”
“Does she live with you?”
, and there wasn't a
Her name was Kiran. She gently led John toward the section of the store containing an assortment of outfits. When asked what he was looking for he shrugged helplessly, “Something to go out to dinner in?”
“Take you to bed. I don’t want to wait, Sherlock. I’ve been waiting years already. You don’t owe me anything, I don’t mean that. I don’t expect anything, but if…”
“Thank you.”
Ironically, his mobile vibrated. Mycroft checked, and John was only mildly surprised to see that it was from his fiancée. “Remember, Miss Morstan is no longer your concern.” John felt odd because he was engaged to Mary, but if Mycroft was warning him, then there was obviously more to her than he had ever been able to learn. It made him angry again that he must have missed something tremendously blatant, but Mycroft was supremely unimpressed, reminding him, “You are here exclusively for Sherlock. Do not mistake me, John Watson. If I learn that you have not given my brother 100% of your time and attention, things will go very poorly for you. You will use the mobile I have left with my brother to let me know when his heat is finished, to request supplies or assistance in case of a medical emergency, but nothing else that does not relate directly to the care and maintenance of Sherlock.”
“You’re out for dinner with a man wearing women’s clothing. No one is ever going to look at me and mistake me for female.” Sherlock sounded faintly bitter.
“Good,” John understood Sherlock’s inability to manage more than one syllable at a time. All the sensations they were creating together were overwhelming. John’s body was confused on how to react to the invasion, and while it didn’t exactly hurt, there was a stretchy sort of tingling that wasn’t wonderful. “It’s good.”
Sherlock sifted for clues. When Sherlock found the database that matched the human cargo with a wish-list being assembled for paying clientele, he had clapped his hands with glee.
he looked as rakish as you do. Really, John, is that the best insult he could offer?” Sherlock was entirely incensed, glaring in the direction of the cab’s departure. “You are brave, handsome, selfless, and of a quality far above such as he.”
“I’m an arse.” John walked over and dropped to his knees in front of the obviously aggrieved omega, “I’m sorry, Sherlock. I never should have left without talking to you first, I should have at least waiting until you woke up instead of leaving you alone. I haven’t been thinking straight since you got back, fuck, since you left. I’m a jerk, a cad, and just…I’m the worst alpha in the world.” John looked up at Sherlock and his heart ached for the misery he saw there, the misery that he had caused, “I don’t know what I was thinking, or if I was even thinking at all. I don’t know why I say or do anything these days, all I know is that here with you is where I ought to be, and if you’ll permit it, I’d like to do exactly that.”
an arrangement like that but now John’s stomach settled. He wouldn’t have to decide between Sherlock and Mary, not now. Mary had made this choice easy for him. “No, he wouldn’t. The only reason he even allowed me near him is because he would have died otherwise. If I’d been his before this I
John was still smiling as he stepped forward. It was so easy to bend down to meet John as he stretched up the tiniest bit so that their mouths met. It was brief, only a moment, then John was reaching up and tugging off a berry from the sprig. Both of them felt a tension they hadn’t immediately noticed, fade away. Their second kiss lasted a bit longer, their lips sliding sensuously back and forth over each other’s, familiarizing themselves with the feel of the shape of their lover’s mouth. When the second berry was tugged off, the tension lessened more but the men stepped closer despite that. Their third kiss lasted longer still, a gentle movement from John became a silent request for entry, one that Sherlock granted. They groaned as they let the kiss linger as they tasted each other. John’s free arm found it’s way around Sherlock’s waist, his hand splayed over the small of Sherlock’s back to keep their upper bodies tight together. It was a while before the berry was recollected enough to be plucked.
John remained absolutely still, waiting for his omega to recognise his ownership and dominion of John. “Subservience? I don’t want a slave! I want John Watson!” Sherlock was kneeling in front of John now, “Snap out of it, Watson. This is a terrible look for you, what would Anderson say if he saw this? Answer me?”
“John?” Lisa trilled from the top of the stairs, “Things alright, love?”
John was in raptures. His omega was so happy, so content, so needy. It was heaven. Sherlock was all over him, rubbing their bodies together, kissing him deeply, stroking and fondling his aching cock, rolling his bollocks gently. It was exciting, thrilling, delightful. “You’re so…”
The others were horrified at his apparent lack of compassion. John was especially disturbed.
They fell asleep together right after doing a quick clean-up, but Sherlock woke a little past midnight. John was deeply asleep, and Sherlock was filled with regret and self-loathing all over again. He crept out of bed, the twang of worry for leaving his master’s side not quite strong enough to keep him from slipping into his pyjamas and slippers. Carefully, Sherlock dug John’s wallet from his pocket and extracted some folding money. Silently, he ghosted downstairs, wrapping his robe tight before he stepped onto the street outside
I believe it was named. John wasn’t badly hurt, mostly due to the almost impossibly safe landing he managed because he landed in the back of a furniture store delivery lorry filled with mattresses. You, unfortunately, caught the brunt of the blast along your back and legs, and you landed on the hood of the same vehicle. John wears many layers of clothing and they burned before his back was seriously scorched but your clothing was too fine to withstand the heat and your burns were significant. Parts of the windows and their casings were also ejected, and you, unfortunately, were the recipient of many jagged pieces of wood, in some rather sensitive areas.”
John was about to insist that he would certainly not become accustomed to it but was interrupted by a firm knock on the front door. Mrs Hudson called up before sending through a messenger who held an expensive-looking envelope. “Ah,” Sherlock looked discomfited for the first time, “It’s from Mummy.”
Sherlock really didn’t need him any longer. All John was good for was…was…was nothing.
The first time he’d touched his anus out of curiosity was revelatory. He’d known theoretically that a great deal of pleasure could be derived from that entire region regardless of gender but he’d never followed through with tests to verify. He corrected that error, working nightly to learn how to tease himself open. Sherlock invested in a variety of personal lubricants, charting his reactions to different thicknesses and bases, bringing himself off at least once a day, not including the times where John showered and Sherlock listened secretly.
“An experimental serum to help accelerate the healing. Do you remember the explosion at Baker Street?” Sherlock had a vague recollection of light and heat but that was it. “You and John were blown out of your rooms by a detonation meant to kill you,
branch of
John has just had a shocking and eye-opening experience. What will become of it?
John wasn’t sure and opened his mouth to ask but Sherlock kept speaking, “It was incredibly gauche of him to even make the attempt. I don’t know him. This wasn’t a social setting. He had a job to do, one that I paid him to do…”
“No, later than that, gorgeous. We’ve quite a bit of personal ground to become familiar with.” Sherlock knew that Danny was referring to his mysterious opponents, yet his new lover clearly worded his phrases to make it sound like their only interest was to have sex. While Sherlock was sure that he was going to copulate with Danny, the case was his primary interest. John would just have to adapt, after all, Sherlock wasn’t asking any more of him than John had asked of Sherlock. It was entirely fair, as far as he was concerned, to put his new unplanned boyfriend before his ex-flatmate/heartbreak. Decision made, Sherlock huffed, “John, in case you didn’t understand, Danny and I would like to get on with our
Sherlock felt hollow. He hardly noticed Danny pulling his pyjamas back on, nor how the thin man had wound himself around Sherlock, petting his head and kissing his cheek, making comforting sounds. Sherlock realized that he was crying again. Sherlock closed his eyes and wished his heart would stop hurting so easily. He
John knew he was being given more miracles than he’d ever hoped to deserve. Humbly, bent forward even deeper, pressing his forehead to the floor, not rewarding himself with further sight of his omega until he’d been given permission. He would treat Sherlock like the benevolent angel he was; Sherlock Holmes was the most incredible person John had ever had the fortune to know, and he would never cease worshipping him and counting every moment in his presence as a blessing. “Till my last breath,” he promised and fell completely still, waiting for an order.
“Yes, John.” Sherlock knelt in front of his master and gave him the intimate kiss he’d asked for previously without needing a command. He understood fully that he was there for John’s sexual pleasure, to be used and set aside whenever the whim struck his master. Tucking John’s cock away after he was done, Sherlock got to his feet and kept his eyes down until John left for work. Once he was alone, Sherlock sighed and wandered around the building for hours, bored to tears and aching everywhere. He considered what he’d learned about his master. John obviously preferred to start the day with anal sex. He was almost insatiable, Sherlock hadn’t met anyone with a sex-drive as high as John’s, certainly not a man of John’s years, at least.
, John, and here we are, together again. I thought our friendship was over last year at this time, I thought I would die in another country, and that I might never have a chance to say that
David shouted, also incensed enough to be careless, “How many alphas are you fucking currently?”
, John, aren’t you listening? I’ve wondered so many times what it would be like to be with you. Don’t you want me? People say I’m attractive,” Sherlock had an awful thought. He blurted the words out without being able to stop himself, “Do I turn you off? Is that the phrase?” Sherlock felt sad now, and hugged his John tight to make himself feel better, “I’m sorry John. I’ll let you go. I know you only like women. I’m sorry.” Sherlock found that he was sniffling, and he felt so terrible. “Okay. I am going to go now.” Miserably, Sherlock rolled off of John and lay flat on his back, staring up at the blank ceiling before heaving himself up and wobbling off to his bedroom where he curled up around a cold pillow.
John was on autopilot as he got himself ready the next day. He hadn’t slept well and was in a bit of a zombie state as he left the flat with his daughter. Travelling to Harry’s so early in the morning was always a trial and John almost got on the wrong train, forgetting for a moment that he was leaving from a different station. Everyone on the train seemed grumpy and snappish, and even Rosie was fussy and miserable. When he arrived late, Harry was taciturn from lack of coffee, taking the baby wordlessly and sleepily shutting the door on her brother’s face. To make things weirder, John felt like people were watching him but whenever he attempted to glimpse who it might be, he only found disinterested or occupied persons in their stead. It made him feel paranoid, especially on the ride back to work. The tube was even more crowded than earlier, and fragrant besides. Too many people crowded into each car, and not everyone was fastidious about their personal hygiene nor how they packed their lunches. There was nothing to do but endure it.
“I didn’t bring it. I didn’t need it. Harry has it.” Now John
Years ago, Mycroft had purchased 221 Baker Street from the pair of seniors that owned it, compensating Mrs Hudson and Mrs Turner handsomely from Sherlock’s portion of the family trust fund in exchange for the deed. Sherlock had technically been dead when he’d done it, and part of the terms was allowing both old ladies to have their suite of rooms for themselves for the remainder of their natural lives. Mrs Hudson was no longer Sherlock’s landlady though she still acted a great deal like his housekeeper, no matter how the scientist protested. Mycroft was the official manager of the entire building, so if Sherlock wanted to live by himself, then it was in his brother’s power to make it happen. Sherlock’s mobile cheeped as Mycroft sent a reply, “

The room reeked of sex, of
John argued a bit at
The trip seemed to take longer than it needed to but at the same time, the sight of his old home was more than he was prepared to dismiss. His emotions welled up, and Sherlock knew he was moments away from weeping like a child just from seeing the black lacquered door and the knocker that was still tilted to the side. His heart sank down to his toes, and he briefly contemplated simply dashing down the street before John’s taunting words came back to haunt him.
John was no fool. He’d lived with Sherlock Holmes for a long time, and he knew how Sherlock reacted to things. For the first time in his life, he was absolutely certain of what he was witnessing. Sherlock was attracted to him. There was a chance here if John was brave enough to take it. It was still a risk, but the odds seemed to be favouring him at the moment. John took it. “To do a proper comparison though, I’d need to use my other hand.” John got up from the table and stood directly behind Sherlock. Leaning forward so that only an inch of space separated their torsos, John placed his hand right over Sherlock’s, even spreading his fingers so that he was directly in line with all of Sherlock’s digits. John dragged his thumb a tad slower, rubbing against Sherlock’s larger thumb as he placed it with greater precision. “What do you think?”
Sherlock watched the play of feelings dance across his friend’s face. John was always internally complex, and Sherlock was lacking in emotional intelligence about these sort of things, but somehow, Sherlock understood something
Sherlock smiled. His heart felt good, and his body did too, even the mild sting of his behind was merely a reminder of the huge step forward they’d just taken together. “Marry me, John.”
try. Would you do that, please? Try as earnestly as you can, not just lip service to a promise, but honestly try?”
When it was time to leave, John absently paid for their meal while gazing up at his very significant other. Sherlock was so tall in his heels but John found every long lean inch to be enticing and hard-to-resist. They strolled out of the restaurant after John helped Sherlock into his long fur cloak, “Cab though, I think.” They looked at Sherlock’s feet ruefully. His lovely fancy heels were gorgeous but there was no way he could keep his pretty toes from freezing, not in the winter chill. Still, John enjoyed helping Sherlock into the taxi, enjoying how his legs looked as he demurely draped the corner of his cloak over them after he was seated, and how he held his knees genteelly together.
“Forgot?” Harry sounded sceptical. “John Hamish Watson. You made me come over to celebrate both the birthdays that happened when you thought that Sherlock was dead so we could commemorate him but now that he’s back and alive, you what, fucked off with some random skirt and just made him look after your daughter?”
John looked solemn now and moved his arms back down to hold Sherlock’s waist. “No, you have every right to doubt me. What you said, you weren’t wrong.” John hung his head and his entire body seemed to radiate a bone-deep shame, “I
!” John was so passionate in his exclamation that even Sherlock was tempted to believe him even though he really had been high enough, enough to nearly die from it.
“No. I just…forgot.” She wasn’t going to believe it, not after everything.
Watson?” Mycroft scowled at John, but John scowled right back at Mycroft for putting him this position, but he couldn’t think of a reason powerful enough to refuse. He’d just have to find another clinic after this was all done.
David laughed without humour, “Whatever, Aggie. You lie so much, I’m just going to bet my life that you lied about the penalty too.”
John’s face turned puce. With a clatter, his teacup landed on the table, “Well, it’s been a good visit, but I’ve got to go. Rosie needs picking up.” Rushing them to the street, John stumbled out of the house and nearly fell down the stairs in his haste to go in the opposite direction.
Sherlock sighed, “No, I’m as enamoured of Dr Watson as I ever was. Danny and I have many things in common in that regard, he has his own…situation. We met just the other day, at the park, the day you walked Rosie and me there. One thing led to another, and now we’re helping one another with our respective problems.”
John hummed happily as he made Sherlock take a long hot bath after. He rubbed Sherlock’s shoulders, petting his hair, and stroking soothing hands over his body. Sherlock loathed him. After he was out and dry, John inserted a suppository which instantly numbed the entire region, much to Sherlock’s relief. “You’ll be too sore to fuck tomorrow if I don’t do this, not that I’d stop myself. This will help you heal right up, though you’ll still feel the strain of it all but you’re a fine strong lad, aren’t you? You’ll be right as rain in no time. Such a pretty boy.” John hunted around the room until he gathered up some old bedclothes of his that were too short for Sherlock but covered him better than the sheet he had arrived in. “Come on, we’re going to eat and then we’re off to bed. You need to heal, and for that, you need rest.”
Rosie didn’t deserve that. John had no family left to care for his child, they were the last two Watsons left on his family tree. Shaking his head, John made himself take a deep breath. He kept walking until he came across a small park. He found an empty seat and considered his options. If he truly found Sherlock to be beyond forgiveness, then John had to cut Sherlock out of his life. It wasn’t right, not how they were now, not this toxic death spiral. Sherlock had proven without a doubt how he felt for John, and John didn’t deserve it. He then had a deep realization. Sherlock might seem insane to others but to John, he was pure and beautiful, far too good for this world, even at his lowest, Sherlock was a far better man than John. No one could ever understand Sherlock, and they didn’t deserve to. John had been lucky to know him, blessed to have received his regard but Sherlock deserved better. He deserved more. He deserved everything.
“Get out the way, you fucking
“My homeland never changes. You won’t age there. You’ll never be ill there. Everything is perfect all the time.”
“I’m asking once more, will you please come to mine? I can’t protect you here. It would be easy enough to relocate Mrs Hudson, there’s a theme cruise departing soon, I can have her and Mrs Turner on it soonest, they’d be out of harm’s way and we could deal with things without hesitation.” Mycroft sounded as if he had made a similar offer before.
Mycroft was silent for a long moment, his face an unreadable mask. “Very little,” he replied tonelessly, “Sometimes, nothing at all.”
Sherlock forwarded the tiny scraps of information he found to his brother. No matter how it made him feel, Sherlock was determined to do anything at all in order to find John and bring him home.
to close the contract or accept the penalty. You remember what that is? Yeah, he finds every soft spot we have and pushes so hard we cease to exist. Why you didn’t just let me shoot that little fucker in the head before this, I’ll never understand. We need the cash to get off this forsaken rock and onto the continent, enough money to disappear someplace comfortable and stay missing. If his brother finds us…”
John couldn’t disguise the scepticism in his voice, “Supersoldiers. What, like in the movies?” In the back of his mind, John was listing all the people he was worried about.
“Doctor Watson insists that he has not been unfaithful, that you’ve made unsubstantiated suppositions, that there’s been a misunderstanding, and that he’s sick to death of trying to explain this.” Mycroft sounded as if he were reading off a list.
Sherlock were being earnest, and he could tell. Of course, John didn’t know that Sherlock had ulterior motives and wanted John back where he could see him, speak to him, to feel at home with, and to have him there as soon as possible, today, even. “Really?”
"And the worst part was that I had to keep playing through the entire thing, with my cock making an enormous tent in my dress trousers."
“Come on, git, we’re still going to Molly’s. You can return the favour later.” John stood, wiping his mouth on the back of his hand, and then reached to help a rather dazed-looking Sherlock to his feet.
"Now, now, none a' that, my dear wuh.... sir. You wouldn't want me to 'ave to bind your hands or nuffink, next time. I'll bid you good evening." I kissed him once again for good measure, to show that I was not at all frightened by that threat, and I felt him smile against my lips. Then he drew back from me, straightened his mask and clothing, and stepped lightly across the windowsill and out into the night.
Perhaps my brains could flow, so red.
It was apparent that my interloper had gone quite some time without refreshment, and he attended his task with the zeal of a desert wanderer stumbling across an oasis. I cursed and balled my fists in the material of his shirt. He glanced up and held my gaze from behind his ridiculous mask, and winked before he sucked me deep into the well of his throat and wriggled his tongue against what felt like the full length of my cock. It was more than I could bear – I overflowed and spilled and gushed into his mouth until I was completely dry.
"Yes. So, my turn now. Give. What was your worst sexual experience?"
"Enormous is right. Oh god."
The man approached the bed with a willowy grace until he was standing near enough to reach out and touch. He stood there, looking down upon me with eyes the colour of April leaves, for some time, I do not know how long. I licked my lips to speak. “Sir, what…” I began, intending to ask him his business in the cottage, but he interrupted me with a long sibilant shhhh, bringing a paper-cool finger to my lips. I thought I heard the rustling of gentle leaves again, and was calm.
You're dungeon and you're my master.
I dreamt that I had been fast asleep in the still summer heat of the cottage, and I suppose I must have previously been dreaming of sunny afternoons in the green glade, for I recall seeming to start awake at the sound of the rustling leaves of the proud birch. The rustling seemed louder and closer than usual, as though I were perched amongst the topmost branches like a squirrel. The smell of moss and earth and bark filled my nostrils and I breathed deeply, it having become the dearest scent in the world to me.
John stood over the sofa for a moment, considering just expediting matters and giving Sherlock a sternal rub with his knuckles. It would certainly be faster. But no. That would only result in hours of sulky, surly Sherlock, and his midnight kiss would certainly be forfeit in that case.
"I don't want to fall out of love with you."
I stared at my newly revealed term in utter disbelief. That all I had of myself, and all I had with you, should have come to this, inextricably linked to this monster of a man, was unconscionably appalling. I wrenched my hand from his in horror and immediately fled to lock myself in my bedroom, like a child afraid of a thunderstorm.
Only a fool or a romantic ignores the inevitability of change when life is as you like it, and I was neither. I catalogued the days spent with you the way a miser tallies his pennies, hoarding the details of each one in the previously precious space of my memory.
Pushing the trousers open into a V, John scooped Sherlock’s penis free and bent to take it fully into his mouth. It began to harden slowly as he suckled lightly at it, swirling his tongue completely around the head while it was still small enough to do so.
It is to my great relief that my body appears to have taken to the lonely rustic life - my strength is quite returning to me, and I am much improved in form again. I have lost none of my tan - being out of doors every day has kept my skin as brown as a nut, although I flatter myself that I have far outgrown Mr Stamford’s simile to a lathe. And this despite the somewhat dire remainder of my preserved stores. Life in the wilderness is as restorative and constitutional as could ever have been hoped.
"Mmmm. I agree. But you've said that several times before."
"I'm not encouraging. I'm insisting. Move."
I have resolved to be open and honest in this, my confession, and so I shall be. If you will read to the end of this letter, despite all I have done, I would be most grateful to you.
As we neared the chaos of the waterfall, you were persuaded into returning to the
"No. No. Stop. I can't."
Sherlock Holmes
Sherlock’s head thudded back against the arm of the sofa, twisting his fingers into John’s short hair. Sherlock gasped as John took advantage of his now-awake status to pull his trousers down over his hips and then nuzzled into his balls. John continued to stroke firmly, running his thumb over the slit in a circular motion as he drew first one, and then both, of Sherlock’s testicles into the wet heat of his mouth.
And yet, here they were, an hour and a half to midnight. Sherlock had dressed, sprawled out across the sofa, then promptly fallen asleep and not moved for the past three hours. Lanky, inconveniently dozy git.
It was late September in the year 1895, and London was damnably, unreasonably, disgustingly hot.
How will I.
"And I could see that Mummy and Dad were in the front row, and they were incredibly embarrassed for me - they thought it was just an unfortunate side effect of puberty. But I could tell that Mycroft knew exactly what was going on. That fat smirking toad."
"My story wasn't as funny."
JHW, July 15
I dreamt I caught his pale, cool hand in mine, and drew it down to rest on the bed beside me. I tangled my hand into the felted disarray of his hair and pulled his mouth down to meet mine.
"Excellent. Come here."
No matter - I am able to afford the property, and I intend to live out my days here in quiet and peace. I have procured seeds for planting; I have a number of books on the subjects of botany, wild animal husbandry, garden sustenance, and lowland fishing. There is a brook not half a mile from the cottage, where trout are abundant; the woods around me shall provide me with shade in the summer and shelter in winter. I am resolved to be content.
It was only a matter of time before the spider crept into my parlour. I swear to you that I did not seek him out from suspicion or hope or jealous revenge. I considered him a worthy enemy, and the man likely to be the death of me, nothing more.
I might never have found the place, had I not been practicing the lining of bees. I was following a fat and dolorous little fellow from the wild roses near the cottage - where there are bees, there must be a hive, and perhaps in time honey. I clambered over logs and gorse in pursuit until my lame leg was quite shaking with exhaustion. Sliding down the banks of a small valley, I spent more time in watching my feet than in watching my quarry. The bee was nowhere to be seen. I had lost the creature, to my great disappointment.  I had decided to give up the endeavour, when I heard another go purring past my ear, heading decisively to the left of the direction to which I had until recently been oriented.
"That doesn't make sense. You wouldn't have had so much sex if you hadn't enjoyed it enough to repeat the act over and over."
I would not have been surprised if he had remained, waiting for me, when I emerged some hours later, but he had gone. I did not know whether I was thankful or hurt to find myself alone with my newly branded wrist, and my realization that the cruellest term is not always one’s own.
, Sherlock,” he said, adjusting the sporran strategically. “I should have left you asleep. You’re a bloody menace, awake.”
I'm going to fuck and make it rough.
On the fourth of May, 1891, the date you bore proudly and I still concealed, we set off towards the abyss of the Reichenbach together. The day had dawned clear and cold, and neither of us had slept well. We walked in silence, each of us preparing ourselves privately for whatever the day might hold.
“I confess I am a ridiculous man,” Sherlock mutters, lips twisting into a frown.
Sherlock grunts an affirmative, rapidly losing patience with this sharing of his feelings.
He looks up and – oh. Mike has returned from his lunch break (a large flat white with two sugars, a ham sandwich and an afterthought of a cinnamon doughnut) with a guest.
Sherlock’s lips twist at the crude phrase. His mind feels like it’s spinning, hovering on the cusp of something long hidden.
“Yeah?” John asks, half-incredulous.
He shoved all thoughts of his best friend from his mind. John had been so worried about him just the day before — and a couple of hours ago, even after he had discovered Sherlock’s latest deception — but now it seemed that he hadn’t a care for the safety of his flatmate. Had the anger finally set in? Had he realised that he didn’t care about Sherlock as much as he’d thought?
“Very well, then,” Sherlock said, sounding resigned. “Yes, of course he’s coming. I’m sure he’s adequately rested. We’ll meet you there.”
Irene hums.
All of a sudden, John understood. He placed his empty teacup atop his plate and put them aside on the bed. “Sherlock, listen to me.” He clasped his hands together in his lap and sat straighter so as to be as level with his flatmate as possible. “I’m sorry to remind you of something you loathe, but not everything is clever. Not everything is as brilliant as you wish it would be.” He swallowed, knowing full well that both of them were thinking of Moriarty and what Sherlock had told him of the conversation on Bart’s roof.
“He kissed me.” Sherlock distantly feels that next to him, Irene had tried very hard to stifle an actual gasp. “He was speaking about how strange the waiter was and how he must’ve had a chip on his shoulder or some such thing. I wasn’t paying attention and he asked if I was alright. I shrugged it off and he told me –” He clears his throat semi-nonchalantly. “– that he’d had a fantastic night and he wanted to see me again. And then he kissed me.”
Reality intrudes, unavoidable and unwanted, when closing time eventually creeps too close to ignore any longer. Sherlock finally admits that he should go. It takes a startling amount of his self control to give voice to a fact he knows to be true, even if some desperate part of him wishes it wasn’t. John scrubs a hand over the back of his own neck when he nods. A similar hesitation is clear in his expression, even as he smiles graciously.
Sherlock is so intrigued by John that he goes to the café to "start his biology essay."
Sherlock’s brain supplies. It's a familiar sentiment, but he doesn't –
John laughs – that melodic arc, entirely free of self-consciousness – and it eases the tension in Sherlock’s jaw.
Glancing once more at the rows of tarts, pastries and assorted confectionery behind the glass, Sherlock finally says, “I’ll have a chocolate chip croissant, thanks.”
, Joseph –”
John straightened up, accepting the peace offerings.
) and that he’s most likely studying medical science. He does not know enough to warrant jealousy of other people’s interactions with him. Sherlock clenches his eyes shut for a moment, internally reprimanding himself.
But that went against every fibre of his being. If there was anywhere that he belonged, it was next to his best friend, protecting him as the familiar blaze of adrenaline surged through him.
Or – shouldn’t have been.
He talks to the anatomy bust his mother bought him when he moved out for university. He talks to his reflection the morning of an exam, reciting facts and formulas until he can no longer see any trace of panic in his features. He talks to Mrs. Hudson in a way that makes her smile fondly over their plates of shortbread biscuits. He talks to Irene about how dull his calculus professor is and whichever girl she thinks is most not-dull at present. He even talks to himself in his own head – mostly about trivial things like how much milk he’s likely to need over the forthcoming week, or the probability that he might eventually obtain a sample of francium to experiment with in the twenty or so minutes before it decays into other elements.
His friend shifted and Sherlock’s mind snapped back into place: the case, the markings on the bodies, an unremarkable killer, unsuspecting victims.
. So that was new.
“I’ll see you later, then.” It comes out as more of a question than a sure statement, despite his best efforts.
He wouldn’t have thought anything of it if he hadn’t memorised every sparkling cadence of that voice.
She noticed him mid-sentence, her lips shaping a most likely prepared excuse that would also notify Lestrade of Sherlock’s undoubtedly agitated state. Sherlock met her half way, glancing behind her at the man she had left – a different one to the stage-five clinger who had been with her when they first arrived.
He gestures vaguely, uselessly, tears his gaze away and decidedly hates himself.
That is, until a new barista is hired, who’s more than happy to work frequent mornings and who never forgets a pretty face or its accompanying name.
to make a soy latte with an extra shot. Whichever poor soul is behind the counter sounds as if they’re expending every ounce of their patience; their voice strains with hints of a kind of tired desperation while they attempt to confirm that what the customer actually wants is a long macchiato with soy. It’s a pointless endeavour, and Sherlock wonders why they’re bothering at all.

Priestley had a huge impact on chemistry and philosophy in the late 18th century. I’m not a chemist but, in simple terms, Priestley discovered that air was made up of multiple components that break down when heated, including oxygen. He had some admittedly funky terms and explanations for this, but when he told Lavoisier, Lavoisier got the chemical reasoning (more) correct and came up with “oxygen”. So Lavoisier generally gets the credit for “discovering oxygen”.

They walk in silence past the now-empty football fields and cross the footbridge under the university’s old-style yellow street lamps.
Sherlock’s eyes positively light up. “Exactly. Nicknames give others the chance to tell us who we are. How they see us. That’s why it feels so odd when people who don’t know us well use our nicknames: it feels like they haven’t earned that perception of us yet.”

Sherlock exhaled like he had temporarily forgotten how to breathe. He almost couldn’t believe how relatively well this awful situation had panned out. It seemed to finally sink in that John was staying. He was suspicious and hurt by the breach in trust, but he wouldn’t leave.
The phone is passed back to its rightful owner without eye contact, Sherlock resolving not to allow himself the luxury of openly staring at this wonderful anomaly any longer. John feels strangely as though he’s floating while a mousy woman slips past him to hand over a mug of steaming coffee.
He hears John calling after him but only speeds up, walking without thinking back the way he came. Over the uneven footbridge with borderline-hazardous planks; past the university football team practising on the fields. He kicks through a substantial pile of crunchy autumn leaves.
More like Sherlock.

So John had gotten his way and was agreed to be the more acceptable choice. The safer choice. And then his voice had begun to sound distorted and slurred, the vowels blending together and tripping over the consonants, and Sherlock had
He can hear the wind swirling dust and crumpled leaves around them, hear foot traffic and cars in the distance. The automatic door opening behind them. John’s breathing.
Lestrade’s concerned tone was met with raised eyebrows.
Conversation had flowed like good wine. John spoke about how glad he was to get a job at the café, how much he enjoyed Molly’s company. It was a change from the long hours he spent studying on the ghostly upper levels of the library. Sherlock asked if he played sport; it seemed the kind of thing a man like John would like.
Mike Stamford is a fairly antisocial man, without a sprawling circle of friends. He lives with his longtime girlfriend Fiona and their pet Labrador, makes monthly visits to his parents’ home in Blackpool, and has generally amicable-in-passing relationships with the other lecturers at Barts. The appearance of the man who enters the room with him is a stark anomaly.
Sitting down, Sherlock makes a hasty decision, one that is quite possibly bolder than any other he’s made in the last several years. He reminds himself that his phone is switched to silent before he takes an imperceptible breath inward and speaks.
Glancing at the ceiling, John wondered what would happen if he simply stood up, grabbed his towel and left the room. Sherlock would be unbothered, no doubt, but John’s pride would surely sustain a beating.
The mobile shimmers like a mirage as John passes it to him. It feels small in his grasp; he flicks the screen upwards to reveal the keypad. There is no passcode.
Unlike the push and pull, ebb and flow of waltzing, in dancing there are no rules besides those you construct yourself, no squares but those you fight for with elbows and sheer determination. This dancing was freedom.
Fiery indignation all burnt out, John is patient now. He starts again: “Sherlock.”
The night prior had brought the conclusion of the fifth case and, with hardly time for a short kip between each, Sherlock had returned to Baker Street more blurred and frayed at the edges than usual. He normally slept for at least twelve hours after a case, although sometimes up to fourteen after particularly taxing ones such as this had been. Therefore, John had no qualms about slipping past his friend’s figure early the next morning – draped haphazardly as he was across the lounge in the sitting room, as though he had simply fallen onto it and into slumber in the same movement, and remained in both – and into the bathroom for a relaxing bath and a wank.
“My name is not Joseph,” Sherlock says, his voice level. He lowers his hands and finally opens his eyes, tracking the bewilderment on John’s face. “I lied to you. My name is Sherlock Holmes.”
John cast a glare at his friend for the interruption, but it lacked any real heat.
John returned beside him before Sherlock had even noticed he’d gone.
He hadn’t thought this far. He glances up at the barista and his gaze catches on ocean-blue eyes before it has a chance to reach the name tag.
hidden in his tone, peeking through his frown.
“And he just destroyed it. Demolished any pure motivation I had to study for it. I drank so much coffee that semester.” John shakes his head, the remembered disappointment flickering anew in his eyes.
“For the last time, if you could factor it into the limited amount of knowledge your level of intelligence allows you to retain at any given time –” Sherlock ground out, though was apparently cut off.
Finding himself back in the university library, Sherlock walks up three flights of stairs for good measure before sinking heavily into a chair in an empty corner. He scrubs a hand over his eyes and focuses on his breathing.
No, John made him stronger with the fiery intensity of a comrade found on the battlefield. Every time John muttered
“It’s time-sensitive, so naturally, I had set an alarm on my phone. Really –” Sherlock extracted what looked like a toothpick, a butter knife, some tweezers and a small glass vial from the pockets of his ratty pyjama bottoms, and placed each gently on the floor. “– you should be thanking me.”
“You are worthy of happiness and affection. This didn’t happen by mere chance or coincidence. He chose
“I’d love to see your flat.”
“In a romantic capacity?”
– listen to it now.
He’s overthinking this, and dear god, he might yet go mad with it. Eyes are made of fluid and collagen fibres, cells and optic nerves, ligaments and muscles. Not
Sherlock scowled, thinking quickly.
Sherlock grimaced. “An alleyway a block from a club called Phoenix. I had thought that Bonfire was a surer bet but it appears that it was simply the more obvious choice. And yes. It’s… complicated.”
“Stop. Look at me,” Irene’s voice is calm now, instilled with some sudden clarity. He relents begrudgingly. “Tell me what happened next.”
Every time he gets up to do a quick walk around to other customers or ducks behind the counter to serve a harried student on their way home from the library, he finds himself just a little worried the spell will break. Worried that when he walks back to the table, this low-voiced chemistry student, with eyes like electricity and a face seemingly chiselled by Michelangelo himself, will tell him it’s been nice to chat but he’d rather not do so again.
John shrugs a little, his steps slowing. “It was empty and I signed out earlier than I left, boss won’t mind.” He takes a breath as they finally reach each other, the tiniest of smiles pulling at his lips. “I wasn’t sure I’d catch you. I was trying to think of the fastest way to search floor by floor.”
When he arrives, it’s extremely quiet, with only a handful of customers tucked away in corner booths and hunched over at hushed tables. Many wear oversized headphones, tap away at open laptops and are generally shrouded in overt messages to leave them alone. A lone female barista is sweeping behind the counter in light, controlled movements. Her long mop of hair is tied back, although the edges of a side-leaning fringe escape her navy hair clip and obscure much of her features.
In a general sense, Sherlock talks a lot.
When they break apart, they’re both breathing hard. Sherlock’s porcelain nose is tinged pink with cold. He leans his face a little into one of John’s hands, which still haven’t moved.
on you in a way that –” He paused for the briefest of moments, wherein his gaze flickered down and back up John’s frame. “– suggested interest of a kind deeper than is usually present between a worker and their customer.”
Finding a seat far enough from the counter that he’s not disturbed by any new customers, but not so far that he can’t observe John if he wishes, Sherlock pulls out his ecology textbook. He almost doesn’t want to disturb the perfect picture in his coffee. Taking a careful sip, he promises himself that he’ll look at John only after he’s completed a rough outline for his essay.
He revelled in challenging the impossible, but would gladly profess defeat if tasked with deducing an entire room of women, each one almost instantaneously, while weighed down by the superfluous background data that his senses absorbed.
Irene looks at him imploringly. “Sherlock, what would it matter? He wanted to go out with you and he did. He wouldn’t care about any of that shit.”
Despite having no obligation to leave his flat the next day – it being Saturday – and having actually planned to start a rather pressing biology essay, Sherlock finds himself pushing open the door to the cosy café in the early afternoon. John looks up and greets him with the most gorgeous smile he thinks he’s ever seen – it’s positively radiant, all easy charm and a carefree nature. He bets John doesn’t have to work at all to look that happy to see someone.
“Yes.”
Feel free to come talk to me over on
The lapping of water and the obscene sounds vibrating from within Sherlock’s throat while he sucked John echoed in addictive harmony around the tiled room. John’s eyes slid shut. A hand rose to thread fingers through Sherlock’s hair. He held on for dear life as the man sent him crashing into ecstasy, obstinately ignoring the single, unambiguous tug on his curls.
“You’re welcome.”
“Yes, I
John appreciated the concern. The fact it was coming from the position of both a friend and an officer of the law meant that Lestrade definitely had John’s best interests at heart. He wouldn’t hold it against him if he simply said,
“I already knew you used my conditioner on infrequent occasions.”
“This is an old friend of mine, John Watson.” His pointing the man out is completely unnecessary, but Sherlock hardly even registers it, attention fixed elsewhere.
“I love you, John Watson.”
Overwhelmed by the sudden wave of guilt and shame that washed over him, he burrowed further into his slump. How could he have been so careless? He had probably bollocksed the whole night’s investigation.
Sherlock felt more than heard John say something, but his voice was drowned out by the nonsensical lyrics blaring throughout the room. He leant in, feeling John’s breath brush his ear as his friend repeated himself.
“You can call me anytime.” Sherlock chuckles bashfully.
“I know that.” Sherlock’s jaw clenched, but his tone betrayed that he had accepted John’s point as valid. “I have considered it at length, however, we mustn’t dismiss that this may be a possibility.”
particular thought.
John was holding a photograph. A little torn and weathered with age, like it had been kept in a wallet or a back pocket at some point. It was an old Polaroid, undated but for the caption:
“I see you boys finally decided to show. Done with the domestic of the day?” Donovan said, typically coolly.
“You seem a bit rattled – on edge, maybe. I need to make sure you’re not distracted. This is dangerous.” His voice was firm.
Sherlock accepted the drink he offered and motioned to a lounging area slightly removed from the buzz of the main dance floor. Although the area was mostly populated by young couples – all, thankfully, still upright – it would provide a less overwhelming space for the two men to briefly assess their surroundings.
So now he waits in the café: later than he’d like to be, in a much longer line than he’s accustomed to, with a new barista. Sherlock sighs internally at the thought, feeling a physical craving for caffeine already. He steps forward.
“To the very best of times, John,” Sherlock whispers into the love of his life’s ear. Then he releases him, turns, and – with a nod to his brother, their earlier conversation fresh in his mind – boards a plane that will ensure he never sees John Watson again.
And wrong.
A compact and tasselled brown handbag hung from a long strap that was strung across the woman’s torso, and her hair was bleached with pink, blue, red and probably some other shades, too – it was difficult to tell in this light. Sherlock immediately knew she wasn’t who he was looking for, from her bitten nails, unsteady movements and the dreamy, childlike grin that adorned her face. Not to mention that she was much too short, and far more lacking in control of her motor skills than a violent murderer would be in this situation.
– meets his eyes and Sherlock can see that he’s smiling just a little, just enough. Can see, from how close they’re standing, the gorgeous sparkle in his ocean blue eyes that tells him John doesn’t hate him after all.
No, John is
Sherlock was immensely appreciative of the small kindness: it gave him a physical point of connection with the case and their true objective, preventing his focus from whirling away onto the music, lights and hyperactivity of their location. John had a knack for doing that, Sherlock thought: reading and responding to Sherlock’s needs with ease, as if it was a routine they had followed and perfected over the course of their whole lives.
“Oh. Okay.”
. It’s just a word. Just tell him!”
“Excuse me?”
“What?” He glanced back just in time to see her eyes rolling.
Donovan levelled a calculating glance at him, the slightest hints of tightness around her eyes giving away her concern. “Here, then.” She held out her cup.
“What are you even doing?!”
John half shrugs. “I’m not bothered.” He’d gladly walk all night in the blistering cold, unbothered so long as he has Sherlock’s hand in his. “I like it better, by the way,” he adds casually, peeking through open curtains into living rooms as they pass by.
Frowning, Sherlock ignores the voice in the back of his mind.
“To Sherlock, not to Joseph,” John clarifies lightly.
He had also neglected to shave, a practice he usually performed daily with religious devotion. His five o’clock shadow made him look younger, owing to that ironic tendency within young men to grow facial hair in a bid to outwardly prove their maturity. The slightly dishevelled result somehow appeared both intentional and effortless.
“So what about you, then? Where are you actually going now?”
If you were wondering... yes, that was a sneaky Merlin reference.
Irene’s expression is one of deep exasperation. “It’s not that, okay. It’s just –” She gestures tightly with both hands before turning to face him properly on the bench. “Sherlock, darling, my favourite brain to pick, the only person I’d trust to know which professors I’ve slept with, possible platonic love of my life – you’re an idiot.”
“Yes.” Sherlock nods. “He was in my class last semester.”
“Why did you volunteer?” John questioned.
“You should call Lestrade. I’m assuming you’ve yet to explain anything properly.”
Not for the first time in recent days, Sherlock considers the relative merits of simply accepting his fate and commencing the lodgement process to legally change his name.
He could remain focused without John; he had no other choice. Any wavering of his concentration in a situation such as this could be fatal.
“Sherlock, I swear to god,” John said through gritted teeth, his voice deciding to sound a little choked for good measure. “Either help me or get out, I don’t give a fuck, but please,
a voice in the back of Sherlock’s mind whispered. Treacherous thing.
He blinked languidly, sure that there were vital pieces of evidence still evading him. An absentminded shifting of his legs assured him that he was still wearing trousers, however the woollen jumper he had worn the day prior lay folded at the foot of the bed. In its place was the old t-shirt he usually wore to sleep in. His shoes were placed neatly on the floor.
John nodded thoughtfully as if turning the words over in his mind, holding them up to the light for consideration. “Good,” he settled on. “That’s a start.”
do you have this in your bedside drawer?”
“For a bath, I’m certainly much less clean than when I stepped in.”
. You’re still
Despite Irene’s input and generally uncharacteristic encouragement, something in Sherlock rebels at the prospect of seeing John again. It’s as if their immediate magnetism has been reversed, the incident with the waiter having tampered with Sherlock’s internal polarity.
“Good.”
John smiles and Sherlock can’t help but mirror it – he never is able to, is he? His flatmate, his best friend, the man who saved his life… he is the anchor to which Sherlock’s heart is tied; the pin in his compass, the air in his lifejacket. His easy smile is so freely given, and Sherlock wonders how he had managed to take it for granted all these years. Now that he knows he may never witness it beyond this encounter, never watch it bloom across his features like the smell of spring in gently thawing air, he wants so much to stare at it with abandon, to absorb it through his very pores so that his senses may never forget the image.
Distantly, he recognises the adrenaline of standing on a precipice. Feels like he could all too easily become addicted to someone caring about him this much.
Gone were John’s beloved cardigans, oatmeal-coloured jumpers and respectable trousers. In their place were a simple white t-shirt and dark wash denim jeans, the latter of which Sherlock thought made the blue of his eyes even more prominent.
“Nothing!”
Sherlock looks at him sharply and almost stops walking. The back of his mind whispers
Squeezing his way through the outskirts into the thick of the crowd was a challenge in itself, which he soon realised could be achieved by moving in time with the music, rather than simply trying to elbow through gaps between clusters of people. They tended not to like that. Besides, he preferred not to do more damage to his shoes than was strictly necessary.
It’s retrieved at long last, having fallen from his bedside table and onto the floor. The power socket his phone charger was plugged into hadn’t been switched on; that explains why his usual alarms had failed to rouse him.
“The bartender! It was the bartender. Are you satisfied?” John couldn’t understand why Sherlock looked so annoyed. It wasn’t like
Also, shout out to the two professors at my uni whose last names I stole. I’ve never met either of them, but they have brilliant names. And to the professor whose Tuesday morning classes I consistently fell asleep in – thanks, I guess.
Several long moments later, which had consisted of John staring at the object, silent and still, the door opened and Sherlock strode in.
After fussing with it for a time, he stepped back to admire his handiwork and took notice of the amusement in his flatmate’s expression.
John ran a hand over his sleep-worn face and glanced at the bedside table beside him. As if by some miracle, a glass of water and a small bottle of ibuprofen sat there, waiting to be noticed. He squinted at them, unsure whether he should blindly trust that Sherlock had had the foresight to provide such things. A cursory examination of the bottle and the contents within revealed that they were indeed the right pills. They slid delightfully smoothly down his throat.
Breathe. How does one breathe? It seemed an impossible task, especially laying naked in a bathtub, still half-hard, locking eyes with your deadpan flatmate from across the room.
“Why did you say it like that?”
“- but I will swear not to keep something like this from you again.”
“Don’t be.” John shakes his head, his eyes burning with sincerity.
“Vodka raspberry. Thanks!” she yelled back with something close to a sultry smirk.
“The waiter at the restaurant.”
“She’s spelling my initials,” he said with a long-suffering sigh.
After a few moments he speaks again, so softly she almost doesn’t hear the words: “Thank you.”
“You’re an idiot,” Sherlock says, turning away so rapidly it’s almost a flinch.
(See the end of the chapter for
Finally: the calculated effect.

“Doppio, three sugars. Take away.”
Sherlock glances skyward, before dropping his head until it hangs heavy on his neck. “We went to dinner at that dumpling place – the one with the red and gold streamers in the window?”
John hums. Listening.
“I prefer to text.”
“And the request?” Sherlock pressed.
Sorry for the cheesy ending. I couldn't help myself.
Lestrade scowled. “You do actually know my name, don’t you? You just like to rile me up?”
On a whim, Sherlock texts himself. Throughout the course of the past forty-five seconds, he has inexplicably developed the distinct impression that this man, this
Although Sherlock can’t see his own expression, he isn’t sure which of them looks more bashful. John hides it well with what is positively a beam, while Sherlock thinks he might actually faint.
Sherlock grumbles about the stupid phrase from the moment he wakes the next morning, all through the breakfast forced upon him (Mrs. Hudson knows he’d neglected to eat yesterday morning: there’s no hiding anything from her), and up until he pushes the coffee shop’s door open.
If a particular course of action is recommended to him one too many times, he has a habit of purposefully doing the exact opposite out of pure stubbornness. Mycroft hates it; he calls it spite, says Sherlock is unappreciative of how much his older brother cares about him. Sherlock always retorts that Mycroft should learn to stop flattering himself by taking his behaviour so personally.
Extraneous. Focus on the features of interest.
Just the corner of John’s mouth lifted before he turned to catch up with his friend.
“I’m sorry… what?”
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth pulls up in a rueful
Sherlock’s fingertips came together under his chin as he arranged his thoughts. “Lestrade called three nights ago, saying that a man had been found outside Ignition bar with a fatal stab wound to the back of the neck, which had severed the brain stem. The letter M had been carved into his chest, post-mortem and haphazardly, with a knife – something easy to conceal. Hard to tell if it was due to unplanned rage and a subsequent desire to leave a kind of signature, or a violent urge becoming unrestrained while performing a preconceived act.”
None of those experiences are quite like talking to John.
John’s eyes crinkled with mirth at that. He spoke about how he used to be pretty good at rugby when he was younger, and his roommate often urged him to try out for the university team, but he just didn’t have the time to commit to it right now.
Sherlock nodded and turned to the insistent woman. Thankfully, she seemed to think nothing strange of the mens’ interaction. He had hoped that if he acted casual, angled his lower body away from John and neglected to touch his chest, then the woman would conclude that they were merely friends, attending a club with the intention of finding each other suitable women to go home with.
He resisted the urge to close his eyes for a second’s reprieve from John’s piercing stare. That would be as good as admitting defeat. He just needed to

“He could’ve – researched me, asked around to see what I was like. It wouldn’t be hard if he had the right name.”
Hope you liked the chapter!
He ended the call, finally opening his eyes and spinning to find John seated before him. Sherlock spent a moment keenly observing John’s appearance as a whole, picking out the subtle differences he had opted for in order to blend in as much as he could within the younger demographic of their intended destination.
“No, don’t – look. It’s just that you
Exactly thirty-eight seconds later, he breaks his promise.
His fingers appear a little stubby at first glance, although his knuckles protrude just slightly when he fists them around the handle of the milk pitcher, giving the brief impression of length. Hair falls over his forehead when he bends to tamp coffee into the portafilter, but Sherlock still notices the bright, intense focus in his eyes. John is careful and sure in his every movement. Sherlock feels like he shouldn’t be so fascinated by the process – after all, he’s not performing a ballet number, he’s just making a cappuccino. But the fluidity with which John moves and the care that he exerts in such a task is startling.
“They were upside down.” A tiny amount of wonder dawned on John’s face.
“With all the growing pains?” John asks.
, I don’t doubt that. But you always keep these little – little escape hatches. Outs you can fall back on if things get too real or if someone might get too close. I adore being your friend but you know, this could be good for y–”
but his hands cupping Sherlock’s face say
“It would help us blend in and probably give you a better chance to look for anyone suspicious. I know –” he added, seeing that Sherlock was about to interject, “I know it’s a lot to take in, even for you. It would be too much to observe every detail and deduce every woman in all this chaos.”
of his shoulders, every shade of his storm-cloud eyes while his gaze never strayed from Sherlock’s own. Suddenly unable to restrain himself any longer, Sherlock bent down and captured John’s lips with his own, in the same movement as his left hand slipped down to join the other man’s.
Irene glances at a spot of mud beside her right shoe, then fixes him with a piercing stare that doesn’t match her softened tone. “Shame. But recent heartbreak won’t get you out of telling your best friend what happened, Holmes.”
“Shall we go?”
to understand? The disyllabic is spelt exactly as it is said but still, he receives cups with untidy scrawls reading all things from Cheryl to Shylock. (The latter wounds him so spectacularly that he resolves never to step foot into that particular shop again.)
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth quirked upwards. “Good.”
“Was never going to happen.” Lestrade’s face tightened a bit in frustration. “We asked if the owner would consider allowing security to check bags on entrance,” he explained for John’s benefit. “He not-so-politely refused. Apparently business is more important than preventing murders.”
“Seriously?” John asked incredulously.
“Joseph?”
freeze.
Bracing himself on one side of the tub – he didn’t yet trust the solidity of his knees – John leant forward and licked a daring stripe up the other man’s neck, followed by an array of kisses dotted across it. Judging by the moan that erupted from Sherlock’s mouth, the sentiment was well received.
Thus, he frequently departs annoyed and stroppy, often with an inadequate amount of spare time to conduct an experiment in its entirety before his first class.
“Not a word.” Mike shakes his head.
“Nothing. Do you have anything or can I go back to pretending to care about a man’s problems? Oh, wait.” For once, although Donovan’s smile was plainly humorous, it was without malice.
“What?” Sherlock’s face was blank, which John knew meant that he was hiding thinly-veiled confusion.
Sherlock’s face split into a wide grin. “Not that I wasn’t glad for the invitation.”
Their eyes find each other and Sherlock’s are searching for an answer he knows the other pair does not hold. Does he want him to say it aloud? Does he want him to break both of their hearts, and demolish any remnants of hope for a future in which they meet again? Would it be easier for John to be with Mary that way? Easier to sleep next to her at night if he can fool himself into believing that Sherlock is off in the world on some noble adventure, fighting criminals and ensuring the triumph of goodness?
“So here we are,” John says when they’re alone, and Sherlock already hates the way the conversation will play out. The air between them feels awkward and strained, and he
John barked a laugh at the sound of his friend’s voice shamming at timidity.
Disclaimer that my knowledge of pharmacology is limited to high school chemistry, a 2am google search, and a very brief discussion with my third-year med best friend, which veered mainly into how much organic chemistry sucks.
Why does a predominantly theory-based stream of study impress you?” The words are out of Sherlock’s mouth before he can stop himself, his brow naturally furrowing in confusion. His brain immediately responds with
John leans toward him and whispers, “The game is over.”
“John,” Sherlock said finally, tentatively, unwilling to shatter the peaceful moment but aware of the knowledge that he had to anyway.
Suddenly Sherlock is no longer worried about getting ill in the cold, about exams, Irene, or his posh name.
“Yeah.” He nods uselessly, ignoring the sudden hoarseness of his voice.
Eyes widened in reply, a head nodding eagerly in spite of overt disbelief. Water sloshed as the conditioner was rinsed off.
It is also no secret to him that his playing the violin and being prone to extended bouts of silence are not his worst qualities, nor is the latter even entirely true. But for some unknown reason and with more fervour than he knows how to explain rationally, Sherlock
But John finds himself talking about all kinds of things at the other man’s request, unthinkingly spilling details of his life like a child handing out sweets. It’s addicting to have his full attention, to feel like whatever he tells him, his secrets will not only be kept safe but remembered, treasured.
“Donovan has, yeah.” The remnants of humour slipped from the inspector’s face. “No one particularly unsavoury has been sighted entering the club, but obviously with the killer’s record of discretion, that’s to be expected.”
John blinks. Looks up and away again, frowns. Looks back at Sherlock.
They drained the rest of their small drinks and departed the safe vantage point – a little reluctantly, on Sherlock’s behalf. He tried to retain an awareness of John by his side as they moved into the throng.
that, what with the victims all being your twins.”
The woman was surprisingly strong, he had to admit. Each time he made to release his grip – even under the guise of grabbing her hand to spin her around once more – she held them there with an iron grip, reaching behind her to pull his waist toward herself. Roughly calculating what he believed to be her perceived strength against her height and weight, Sherlock thought that she was definitely physically capable of having committed the murders. Her hair was neither brown nor long, but such things could have been altered on short notice and it was clear from the roots that hers had been dyed recently.
John knows he can only perceive these things in Sherlock because he has known the man so closely for such an extended period of time. And, more than that –
Maybe he should have guessed that life is chaotic and messy and, despite Mycroft’s insistence on the contrary, just coincidental enough to cause pain if one is open to it. They signalled for their cheque, already arguing over who was going to pay it – “I asked you out, so I’m obliged to pay!” “Exactly, John. Your courage got us here so it’s my turn to do the gallant thing.” – when the waiter interrupted them.
“– and it wouldn’t
you idiot.”

“That – it – my NAME!” Sherlock bursts out, suddenly breathing hard. He closes his eyes and presses his fingertips hard into his eyelids, feeling overwhelmed. Feeling embarrassed – a foreign concept he doesn’t enjoy at all.
When he reopens them, he approaches the counter with a small intake of breath. John had appeared quite beautiful from where he was standing a moment ago, but the effect is magnified from closer up.

John finally –
“Hello, William.” There was the barest hint of glee behind the words.
He took it somewhat meekly, passing her back the empty cup.

(See the end of the chapter for
“Uh,” the barista clears his throat, halfway between impatience and growing concern that this guy can’t seem to remember his own name. Is he having a stroke? “Gonna need a name with that, pal.”
A mere croak: “
She had no pins in her hair and wore no bracelets or necklace.
Two weeks after the date, Sherlock slips into the coffee shop on a Friday afternoon. The door bell is barely disturbed and neither of the two seated patrons glance toward him. Sherlock is glad for it, feeling of late some old and long-buried self-consciousness that makes him crave invisibility.
Sherlock smiles as she stands upright. Feeling compelled to answer, he replies, “I don’t really think I’m either.” He pauses. “Not really a food person.”
“He’s over there.” She pointed to a spot on their left, careful not to make her gesture too obvious. “Like I said – occupied. I’m sure he’s still, er, on the case, though.”
That isn’t to say that the man was not a gentleman – he was, without a doubt – but he had always found himself somewhat subservient to the whims of his more base desires. Certainly, whenever circumstances permitted, he enjoyed the surprises of dating and the familiar comfort found in serious relationships, but he could not deny the primal pleasure he derived from pure sex. Filthy words being growled into ears, sweat-slick rutting in alleyways behind seedy bars, legs beginning to shake uncontrollably beneath him while his head was dipped between thighs – he loved it all, drank in every ounce of sensation with wolf-like satisfaction.
“Hello.”
It was locked with a passcode that he had neither any desire or hope of guessing correctly, though the lock screen showed a missed call and four unread messages from Lestrade. Hazy images that may have been memories flitted through his mind, and he remembered the case. The noise of Bonfire bar; the bartender smiling amicably at him and saying in a silky smooth voice, “You waiting for someone?”; turning away after an offhand response and striking up a casual conversation with a woman standing nearby; waiting and waiting and then the sudden onset of disorientation; Sherlock’s arms around him and his cologne engulfing him in the cab... He must have been drugged.
At John’s prodding, Sherlock told him a little about his brother and the games and experiments they used to occupy their time with as children. That they’d almost ruined their father’s yacht pretending to be pirates caught in a heated duel, and been banned from the gardener’s shed after an unfortunate minor explosion. He quite happily admitted that Mycroft was now a stiff government official who liked to think he was incapable of logical infallibility and wouldn’t know a sense of humour unless it grew on him like an additional appendage. Even then, he’d likely throw a fit and get his secretary to arrange its immediate removal.
– Sherlock narrows his eyes momentarily at the unfamiliar face and plain name – shares a glance with the woman on the other register. (
They walk in silence a little further, leaving campus and being greeted by the intermittent flurry of restaurants serving dinner and cars passing too quickly. The occasional stone tumbles down the street under their absentminded steps.
“Worth a try,” John offered with a shrug.
When the barista retreats to the counter, Sherlock looks around and realises there are only a few remaining customers in the café. The clear afternoon has become hazy dusk, and streetlights outside have come to life while he's studied idly.
There was no escape, no way for Sherlock to downplay this with a roll of his eyes and a careful examination of his wristwatch. This was far beyond the level of invasion of privacy that John had grown tolerant of, instead veering dangerously into the uncertain territory of a momentous transgression that could cost Sherlock his best
Honestly, he didn’t care all that much what she thought, as long as she wasn’t suspicious.
Sherlock blinked, wondering if he’d misheard.
The only response was the cocking of his friend’s head to the side in askance. He realised very quickly it was of imperative consequence that Sherlock departed the bathroom as swiftly as was humanly possible.
“Lestrade, you first made my acquaintance almost
Sherlock is too distracted, far too interested in other current circumstances to quite bring himself to care. He needs to choose his next words carefully.
“Sorry?” John says in a quiet voice. Unassuming, again.
It's been a hot minute! I'm basically unable to write during the uni semester, but now that's over for a bit I'm free to work on this fic again. I do love it. Thank you if you've stuck around and you're still reading. x
Sherlock blinks before turning the full force of his scowl on her.
John was in the thick of the dance floor, performing some approximation of dancing while in the embrace of a woman. Sherlock squinted to get a better look at her. She was even shorter than John and had cropped black hair. He glimpsed her features as John twirled her, the two laughing heartily, and discovered that she had a highly symmetrical face, with brown skin and almond-shaped eyes.
hands obey me. Favours making
It is an excessively queer feeling to be certain that one has at last met one's counter, but upon shaking hands to have one's wrist remain stubbornly blank.
It didn’t take long until John was barely able to contain the entire cock, so he gave up trying and ran his lips down the side and his tongue back up the urethral ridge on the underside. He parted his lips and engulfed the head, wiggling his tongue into the hollow at the base of the glans. John kept his eyes fixed on Sherlock’s face, watching as his eyes began to dart rapidly back and forth behind his closed eyelids. Still asleep then, unbelievably, and apparently dreaming. But John would bet his entire pension that it was a very good dream.
The crops are growing well, and the fish and rabbits and berries of the wood sustain me. I pore over the herbal handbook in the afternoons. I have not seen another soul. The last of the spirits I brought with me have run off - and probably for the best, as I no longer have the luxury to recover for a morning or day.
There are few places in England where a soldier's pension will permit one to live in as much comfort as a man can hope for, so I have returned to Scotland, where the land is wilder but the livings are to be secured far more affordably. I expect that this cottage, deep in the Gramalchladdich Wood, will sustain me as well as can be hoped. The solicitor implied that it was a family’s living not fifty years ago, but it is most inconveniently located now that the nearby road is no longer in favour with the tradesmen and requires at least a day’s journey by foot over overgrown paths reclaimed by Nature.
John smiled and shook his head. He put the kettle on for a cup of tea, and made perhaps a little more noise than was necessary getting out the tea bags and mugs. It didn’t matter. John knew from long experience that once Sherlock was asleep, he was unlikely to be roused by or for anything.
Sherlock jammed the flesh of his thumb into his mouth as he came, biting hard against a shout that would surely wake Mrs Hudson, Mrs Turner, and probably Mr Chatterjee as well all the way up in Doncaster. John stroked him through it, swallowing the bitter taste as quickly as possible. Might have to break into the Highland Park a little early.
"And covered in yogurt."
I have often dwelt on the moment you took Miss Morstan's hand in the gardens at Pondicherry Lodge. I have wondered whether you had been eager to find a moment to test your skin against hers, or whether you thought that you were somehow immune or incapable, since we had not found ourselves to be counters. Did you, like me, believe your counter to be inescapably male, or were you always equally curious about whether the touch of either sex's hand had the potential of revelation?
"It was not. I was sixteen, and I'd been fooling around with my girlfriend, Shannon, for almost six months. We'd gone from second base to third base and we were definitely heading to home. So neither of us knew what we were doing except that we really, really wanted to keep doing it. And then Shan heard about these warming lubes that were just coming out, and she wanted to try one, but neither of us wanted to go to the chemist's to just pick up lube. I think I'd've died of embarrassment, and Shan didn't want anyone to see her buying it. So she told me she'd just nick the chili oil from her mum's pantry and we could try that and see if we liked it."
