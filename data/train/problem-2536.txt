, John tried to say, but the word lodged in his throat with everything else.
Tea and toast and quiet Baker Street mornings. Crime scenes and danger and the triumph of getting it right. Waking up in Sherlock’s--no,
Sherlock’s heels were shoving at his arse, not-so-subtly encouraging him to pick up speed, and John took the hint and began to thrust in earnest. Sherlock fucked John’s mouth with his tongue as John fucked into his body, and his hips rose to meet John’s with every thrust. Something primal and raw seemed to overtake them both, and John was only barely aware that the headboard was slamming into the wall with the force of his thrusts and that Sherlock had shoved a hand between them and was frantically pulling himself off. Their mouths were still pressed together but they were only gasping now, and then Sherlock cried out suddenly, his back arching impossibly higher as he came between their stomachs. As Sherlock’s muscles clamped down around John’s cock his thrusts became shallower and more erratic, until he was following Sherlock over the edge, shouting his name as he spilled into the condom.
She tried to charge past John. He caught her around the neck at the last moment. She squirmed like an eel, but he wouldn’t relent. For awhile, it almost seemed that he’d caught her. Then she pulled out a knife as sharp as a scalpel with a handle crusted with old blood. John didn’t notice it until it sliced through his jumper. He drew back in shock and she was off like an arrow.
The third was that his vampire flatmate spent a suspicious amount of time with the police detective named Lestrade. Every few weeks or so, he'd come by and visit. Sometimes he'd have a file for Sherlock to puzzle over, but usually he didn't. Every time, they'd both disappear into Sherlock's bedroom for hours. After which Lestrade would stumble out with rumpled clothing and strangely bright eyes and Sherlock would spend the rest of the day in a hazy cloud of self-satisfaction.
Enjoy!
Except… with slightly sharper cheekbones.
Before John could respond, he spotted a small grassy field utterly overrun with police vehicles. “I think I’ve found our destination.”
“How about explaining exactly what ‘this arrangement’ is.” John suggested, a point that always confused him. “I’ve been living at Baker Street more or less rent-free, you sometimes pay for dinner and takeout that only I eat and you’ve never actually asked anything of me aside from helping you with cases and fetching your phone. I assumed the reason you made that offer was because you needed blood.”
From the second he walked into the flat, he could feel the tension. It was like the air was stretched tight like a thousand bowstrings. John opened the door slowly, gently. As if doing otherwise would end with an arrow through his eye socket.
Sherlock threw himself onto a nearby rock, glaring at the fire pit as if that might make it burst into flame. Then John climbed up from his nest in the ground. Hair rumpled, posture loose and naked as the day he born. Sherlock leapt to his feet and turned his back, both in attempt to give his friend some privacy and hide his burning face.
Somewhere in London, a phone rang.
Sherlock didn’t even stir. He hadn’t budged since their last bout of feeding roughly… two hours ago. He was sleeping the sleep even the dead only dreamed of sleeping. Every once and awhile, his nose would twitch against his neck. But otherwise, he might as well have been made of wood. Wood that hummed.
"Of course," John sighed, shoving the various plates haphazardly into the safest parts of the fridge that he could manage. The army doctor then took his laptop from where it was charging on the coffee table and opened it as he settled into a chair by the fireplace. Now was as good a time as ever to write up a blog entry.
This was a day he wouldn’t share with anyone. Partly because there wasn’t anyone remotely tolerable in a hundred mile radius to share it with. But mostly because what he was doing was slightly unsavory, less than moral and probably at least a little life-threatening and if anyone knew, they’d prevent him from doing it.
Ok, this chapter took like three rewrites and I'm still not happy with it, but it's done and that counts for... something. I guess.
Sherlock scoffed. "Hardly the bo-"
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Obviously not-“
"Yes... Well." Sherlock slumped, losing steam rapidly. “Money really isn’t my primary form of currency anyways.”
Sherlock grinned, making himself comfortable by straddling John's knees as John giggled at the absurdity of the situation. "Mad and just a little bit dangerous. Try the shoulder. Not too deep."
John grinned lazily. That’s what he said last time. He wound his fingers into Sherlock’s curls, dragging him down into something that was similar to a kiss, but just a little too wet.
“Where the fucking hell did you learn to drive like that?” John gasped, smiling despite himself.
John woke up feeling… dry. Very dry. It was like the gobi desert took a shit in his mouth then, as an encore, reached its arm down his throat and sanded down his esophagus. And yet… he felt amazing. He felt like he was floating just half an inch above himself, his skin glowing with a golden warmth. He curled his arm tighter around the vampire sprawled across him, nudging at the top of his head with his chin.
“What are you doing with that?” Sherlock asked, leaning closer to watch John scrape at one end of the branch with a sharpened rock.
WARNING: SHAMELESS SELF-PROMOTION
“You are right. I will not get it on my hands.” The vampire growled above the tension in the room. His japanese accent bleeding through, adding extra syllables to the words. “I’ll drain his filthy blood onto the streets.”
Lestrade sighed at the man's theatrics. Sherlock always got to his point eventually, but Lestrade didn't have the patience to wait for it today. "Could we just... skip to the end?"
It was a good minute before Sherlock regained consciousness. This time, though, he seemed more lucid. “John. Please tell me you didn’t throw out all the morphine.”
“Sorry. You didn't need to hear that... -it's the vampire saliva. Effects everyone differently, but it makes me a soppy idiot."
“Can you tell me what’s causing the pain?” John spelled out carefully. His relief at getting Sherlock to his usual state fading by the second. “Or the location of the pain?”
He plodded along at an easy pace, allowing his horse a rest after his mad sprint from the stables. He took this time to take in his surroundings, searching for changes in the landscape. He’d never actually been near the forest he was riding to. He couldn’t imagine what would make it so different from all the other forests and woods in the area. Sherlock assumed it must be a particularly lethal species of nightshade or some fearsome beast which made that particular forest so foreboding, but it could easily be something entirely different that he’d never even considered. To be entirely honest, that’s exactly what the boy was hoping to find.
John set down the fork, the handle pointed in Sherlock’s direction. “This is something you need isn’t it? Like the special sofa and the special knife and having me cut myself. This is a part of the ritual too.”
“Oh, I don’t mind riding in the dark. The roads are-“
He leaned closer to Lestrade. "Is it a good idea for him to be here. What with all the..."
“I’m all ears!”
John did not like the way Mycroft made the word ‘associating’ sound like some perverted act.
“True, but she sent me this text roughly four months ago which states clearly that I am ‘welcome any time, dearie’.” Mycroft responded, coolly flashing his phone which had been scrolled down to that particular text before he had even approached the door.
Sherlock smiled wistfully, as though such a thing was just too good to be true. “Too soon to say. But we’ll have to be careful. Act as if we’ve given up on investigation and are just… having a bit of a holiday before we have to go back. This case will be much more slow-burning than most of the ones in london. Just keep your ears open, your head down and take note of everything. We’ll have to unravel this mystery thread by thread.”
“No. No, it’s not. You’re entering into this… arrangement completely blind. If I don’t explain these things to you, someone could get seriously hurt.” Sherlock explained, the strained tone of his voice giving off the impression that he wasn’t too keen on this either. “I wish I was in a better position to do this yesterday, but I’m afraid the whole ordeal left me rather… vulnerable. So… uh… I’m not actually sure where to begin, actually.”
"Anything you need." John murmured, pulling his shirt out of the way just far enough to slide the blade through his skin. "Take anything you need."
This morning, he was particularly eager because he’d brought his newfound brother a present. He thought of it as a kind of birthday present, although the fair folk don’t celebrate birthdays and neither of them had any clue of when John was born or if he was even born. For all they knew, he could have sprouted out of the ground. But none the less, Sherlock thought it fit to celebrate his friend’s continued existence. With a crossbow.
"Basically, you brought me to a murder investigation as... a first date?" John asked incredulously over his gargantuan plate of lasagna. The owner of Angelo's, unsurprisingly named Angelo, was very eager to please. Perhaps a little too eager. He had kicked out another couple so they could have the window seat, repeatedly congratulated Sherlock for his 'fine catch' and was half a second away from hiring a violinist to 'set the mood' when Sherlock politely suggested that he piss off. It was.... a bit awkward to say the least, considering John wasn't aware a romantic involvement was a part of the agreement (if they even had an agreement) and he wasn't even sure if he was into men, let alone vampires. But hey, the lasagna was excellent.
“It’s… nothing. A gift. It’s silly, really.” Sherlock bumbled, still trying to regain his natural complexion.
“But not like this. Leave. Let me prepare.”
Hey! It's summer and school's over, so I should be able to post more often. We'll see if I actually do though. I've been trying to keep myself busy with art shit and trying to sell my art shit.
“Then go on.” John smiled, nodding towards the fork. He tried his best not to feel too weird as Sherlock fed him like a newly-weaned toddler. “And for the record, I prefer my eggs scrambled.”
“They always break anyways.” a set of pale, slender fingers brushed the bald ivory brow of a grinning skull. “Eventually.”
Sherlock drew the blankets tighter around himself and shut his eyes. John would’ve liked to believe he was asleep, but knew it was only to gain some relief from the light streaming in from the hall.
“If you were that hungry I-” He cut off the morgue attendant by pushing the empty vial into Molly’s hands. Then reached into his jacket pocket. Despite his better judgement, John found himself watching his every move closely.
The voice hummed, disappointed. “Pity. He would've made the perfect toy. No matter.”
The crime scene wasn’t nearly as dramatic as the crowd of police cars might have suggested. No body, no murder weapon, no elaborate display, just a slab of stone and a lot of blood. In fact, it was rather tame compared to what they usually get. He wasn’t even sure if it warranted such a massive crowd of investigators and police officers and even a few firemen. For all anyone knew, the blood came from an injured sheep. It was reckless to cause such a panic so early.
It was good, though. Sherlock needed this. He was obviously worn down to the bone and this was probably his first time actually sleeping in weeks. John didn’t care how different his biology was, he needed actual sleep occasionally. Everything does.
School's started again, so updating might be slower than usual.
Then the finishing touches. He arranged himself in the center of the couch. Legs crossed just so, hair lightly ruffled, back straight- or would it be better if he were sitting back? Yes, definitely. He’s in his own home, not ballet practice. He should be relaxed. Sherlock took a deep breath and tried his best to look living.
“I think I’ll make tea, you want a cup?” Sherlock asked, uncurling himself. He would’ve liked to administer it the old fashion way, by mouth. Or perhaps even the Victorian way, curled up in each other’s arms reveling in the sheer joy of shared body fluids. But he doubted John would be up for that.
“Good morning.” Sherlock said cheerfully from the plush armchair just a few feet away.
"Why." John took a step closer. "Do you." He took another. "Care." He came close enough to see the dignified, floral pattern of the man's brocaded waistcoat. Close enough to give him a clean punch to the nose, should the occasion arise. He came no closer. He smiled a mad, dangerous grin. "What could you possibly have to gain by... this."
“And I’m left-handed. What does that have to do with... anything?”
Sherlock kissed with his entire body, every part of him flexing against him, pulling him closer, deeper. His thighs contracted around his waist in waves, hands seamlessly alternating between caressing him and guiding his movements. His skin devoured his touch and his mouth savored his taste. His entire body resonated with pleasure and desperation and ache, age-old ache. John was being consumed and it was all he could do to just hold on and not lose himself entirely.
A/N I didn’t know how to end that last case so I am COPPING OUT. I was this close to pulling the old ‘and the he was knocked out until all the action was over and everything was ok’ scheme. So if it feels like you’re missing something, don’t worry. I just… left it out.
"Jesus, Sherlock." John slurred as his head lolled back. Thankfully, the vampire wasn't the only one affected. "Shit, did you drug me?"
“What on earth are you doing?” John asked blearily as consciousness slowly dawned on him alongside the realization that Sherlock’s knee was jabbing him in the back and there were gunshots… somewhere. He flopped over to get a better view of what was happening.
Sherlock gave him a sympathetic smile as he shrugged his dressing gown on, catching his arm before he could go to work setting the room back in order. He leaned in close to whisper into his ear. “I’ll see you tonight. For now, I’m hungry.” It was an apology wrapped in an innuendo and topped with a flirt.
“You two disappear into his room for hours…. You come out looking like- uh. That. It’s kind of difficult not to.” John muttered awkwardly, pushing the carton of expired orange chicken to the side.
Sherlock admitted to himself that maybe it’d be better to wait until John awoke of his own accord.
It felt like this one only made things worse
Sherlock stared, a little dazed by the comment and the ringing pain in his nose, but he caught on the meaning quickly enough and darted into the bathroom like a cat running up a tree.
“Think of it as advice.” He flexed his fingers around the ivory handle of his cane as he considered his next words. "These creatures... they're not like us. They've preyed on humankind from the shadows for centuries. Preying on the lost, lonely and desperate. Luring them in with their beauty, promises of money, security and your heart’s desire. Tell me, has he told you that he’ll do anything to please you? Or has he found a different line?"
He was thrown so off balance that he briefly forgot what a violin was. “I’m… sorry?”
John whistled, his eyes dancing over the blade with awe. "Is that-You're using that... instead of fangs?"
John waved him off, feeling a little better about the wank he would have to have in a bit. Can’t blame the man for having to eat after about a week of just tea and water. Just before Sherlock could disappear down the stairs, something nagged at his mind. John called out “That’s not seriously your idea of seduction, is it?”
“Oh, you’ll find it is very much my business.” His smile dropped. John found himself actually missing it. “All creatures such as him are my business. In fact, the reason I brought you here today was to make a sort of… proposal. I’m not asking for anything too strenuous, nothing you’d be uncomfortable with. Just some information. His habits, hobbies, routines. And of course a little discretion.”
.” John shot said vampire a pointed and amused glance.
“I would like to express my gratitude to you, John.” Mycroft started, sounding like an infuriatingly polite rejection letter. “For what you’ve done for Sherlock.”
Ten minutes later, it was 6am and Sherlock was tickling the bottom of his foot.
They left while the cashier was entering the number into her phone.
John fell into his chair in relief, melting into the overstuffed piece of furniture as he toed off his shoes. “Is all your family like that?”
John wouldn’t let this ‘Sherlock’ character fool him into thinking he’s anything more than livestock in this deal. “As well as the more… traditional forms of compensation.”
"Yes." Sherlock answered John, ignoring Mycroft with a quiet fury.
“Take whatever punches you can manage. I won’t hurt you, you can’t hurt me.” Sherlock rolled his shoulders and smirked. John huffed a laugh, thinking how silly the otherwise poised vampire seemed with his tiny pink nipples out in the middle of the day.*
“Sherlock. I hope you’re not thinking of burning my letter before I’ve read it.” John warned him as he walked back into the living room.
The violin let out an ungodly shriek as Sherlock pulled the bow in a harsh down stroke. He set them both aside and stood with a growl, his face pulled into a grimace of severe distaste. “I need to make a call.”
“I… was just-“ Sherlock tried to defend himself while simultaneous trying to wrench his ear from Mycroft’s grasp.
John giggled and shook his head. “You’re an awful teacher.”
Sherlock fumbled behind his back, searching for something as John laid back against the armrest and giggled to himself. "What's tha?"
"Don't mind him. He can be as skittish as a cat, but he'll warm up to you." Mrs. Hudson reassured him from the sofa, with a nostalgic smile lazily resting on the rim of her favorite teacup. "I remember when he first moved in. He wouldn't unpack his bags for a month because he was convinced I'd change my mind."
A glass of wine materialized on the table. “A little idle conversation might help also.” He mumbled over the rim of the glass.
"I doubt she'll come up to our table and introduce herself. She has gotten away with this before, after all." Sherlock caught the attention of a waiter and ordered a glass of wine. Red, with way too many syllables for John's budget. He nudged John's plate. "Eat. But slowly. We need to look like we're not waiting for her.”
Also, if you like my work so much that you feel compelled to give me money, I've got an etsy shop where I sell a bunch of cute mini paintings. Some of which you can even wear on your body!
“He stole my children. They are all I have left of her.”
“Glad to hear it.” Sherlock replied as John walked off to fetch their lunch. Once he was out of ear shot he mumbled something under his breath. “Happy birthday.”
"Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you're not a morning person." John was sure there wasn't a good way to take that, but Mrs. Hudson found it anyways. She turned her attention back to the other human in the room, whispering as she laid more food out in front of me than a grown man would usually eat in an entire day. "That one's got a tongue as sharp as his fangs, but don't let it get to you. "
1) No one would believe anything he said.
“Hm…” John nodded thoughtfully around a bite of definitively expired orange chicken. He discreetly spit it back into it’s carton. “So, you and Sherlock.”
“You missed.” Sherlock announced. “But… Not bad for your first shot.”
“No, thank you. I’m fine.” John replied. Sherlock pulled out two cups anyway, spitting generously into one of them with practiced silence. As the kettle boiled, John’s typing slowed from two words a minute to a word every two minutes. Eventually, he saved whatever progress he made and shut his laptop a little harder than usual. Sherlock shut off the kettle just as it began to simmer, dunking a tea bag in the barely hot water and wringing it gently to speed up the steeping process.
“Sherlock is in danger.” Mycroft finally announced, making a swift and precise slice through all the usual bullshit. “More danger, that is. Sherlock’s chosen lifestyle puts him at considerable risk, but the danger of which I speak is entirely separate and infinitely more dire. The part I played on the night we met was not me, but it was not entirely made up either. This city is infested with vampire hunters. It always has been. The common hunter chooses to go after the lesser houses and the poor souls that live in exile than risk the vengeance of the elders. Several have made an attempt at capturing Sherlock, but there is one that I fear might just succeed.”
Sherlock crawled into bed next to his distressed friend, arm curling around his chest as easily as butter on toast. John thrashed against the restraint. An ankle collided with his bony shin, an elbow poked at his ribcage. Nothing that would leave lasting bruises.
It seemed to disturb everyone in the room, but it petrified Sherlock.
Sherlock flashed the kind of grin he usually reserved for crime scenes. John got the brief touch of arrhythmia that usually only happened at crime scenes. “But in all seriousness, giving over a pint of blood in your first go was not the brightest idea.”
"Well, we're taking a brief detour." Sherlock explained unhelpfully, turning down a random street. John followed a few feet behind, a habit he was becoming increasingly familiar with. They weaved through alleyways and shadowed streets to a more fashionable side of town. The kind of place that even tourists would find a bit too pricey. Sherlock, with his understated elegance and subtle dramatics, fit in like a drop in a rainstorm. John tried his best to hide in his shadow.
In the living room, Sherlock stood in front of the fireplace, his tightly drawn face reflected in the mirror. His burgundy dressing gown billowed around his ankles, revealing that he had just finished a round of pacing.

“Are you dressed?”
“You…” He began again, speaking quietly to his knees. “You’re a soldier. Accustomed to packing quickly. Take anything you need. My account’s fairly dry, but the chemistry equipment should sell well.”
“That… you could at least wash the blade after using my razor?”
“Four, five days? He's… entirely unresponsive. Eyes open, but glazed over.” John listed as he examined Sherlock. “He’s barely reacting to physical stimuli. Occasional muscle twitches. What is this, an overdose?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and hopped over the coffee table to loom directly above his comfy overstuffed chair. “Just a friendly sparring match, John. To get the blood flowing.”
“What on earth are you doing in there, styling your hair?” Sherlock shouted through the door, prompting John to take a step back from the door and begin brushing his teeth. He eyed the glass cup containing a pair of partial dentures as he scrubbed away at his gums, wondering at the fact that he’d never seen it in the bathroom at Baker Street and the possibility that Sherlock had been consciously hiding it from him this entire time. Then the impatient vampire started pounding on the door and John stopped caring.
“You aren’t seriously going to ask me to take the case, are you?” Sherlock asked once the made it out of earshot.
He did. Thankfully. “Well, I’m not going to just sit here and do nothing.”
For now, this chapter comes with a lot of feels. Based vaguely off of the canon 'the dying detective' story. But, surprisingly, is not a case fic.
"Yeah, that'd be shame. Well, I'll tell her you were concerne-"
“Where on earth have you been, anyway? You’re filthy.”
"If I had the room, I'd have her stay here for the rest of the week. It's alright when her mum's around. But otherwise... He just seems off." She paused for a moment, considering something. "It's strange, Amy never told me she plays the cello."
“Too much pain, not enough morphine.” He grunted, sinking deeper into the sofa. One of his hands reached up and clutched at the armrest he was using as a pillow, the muscles in his arm twitching worryingly.
He waited for some sort of answer but got none. "
“What’s that?” John peered over Sherlock’s shoulder, catching a flash of color before Sherlock scooped the contents out and whirled back to his feet.
"It's causing you pain. It doesn't look very clean. Might even get infected." A cold breath fluttered through his arm hair. That was definitely a nose. "Please, let me help."
Several events then piled on top of each other in that moment. John realized that since the kidnapper didn’t have a gun, there wasn’t anything keeping him from immobilizing the bastard and lunged. The bastard in question realized that, because everyone in the room knew he bought his gun from the kid’s section, there wasn’t anything keeping John from immobilizing him and darted towards the door. One of the kidnapped children managed to dislodge the gag from her mouth and shouted to her father in japanese. Her father forgot about the kidnapper and ran to free his kids. Sherlock tripped the kidnapper as he lunged for the door. John hit the ground. Lestrade opened the door. The kidnapper broke his nose.
He landed, almost by sheer luck, back in his chair. The detective brandished one of their better forks, stabbing at a generous pile of eggs and holding it about mouth level in front of John’s face. His eyebrow twitched expectantly.
'hmm?' Sherlock said, never lifting his eyes from the telly. He had an odd fascination with Jerry Springer that John didn't really want to understand.
"-my life, yes." He interrupted confidently, letting the menu fall to the table.
But he didn't mind that terribly as he had plenty of material to write about even after subtracting the borderline supernatural elements. Just the other day, a man broke into the flat and threatened them with a fire extinguisher. The strange thing was, he didn't demand money or valuables. He wanted them to solve the disappearance of his wife and clear up the suspicion surrounding him. Of course, John wasn't too keen on helping a man who was currently holding hostage at the business end of a fire extinguisher, but Sherlock was so intrigued by the case that he didn't even charge him for solving it, let alone destroying a window and terrifying the wits out of Mrs. Hudson.
“Uh… yeah. Definitely.”
John sighed as he pulled some clothes from his bag. “I feel like you tell me that every time.”
You raise one eyebrow mischievously. “Not yet, I’m not.”
days. The ones where nothing at all went right. No case, no experiments, no interesting articles to read, not even a comfortable position on the sofa. Everything is dull and wrong and deeply unsatisfying. Like an itch in your mind just out of reach. A physical one, too, if you were being honest - though not a literal itch so much as a... yearning. A need you can’t put a name to and therefore can’t fill. It is positively maddening. About the fourth or fifth time you roll over and huff into the leather, body face down in the sofa cushions in wide odd angles all tangled up in a throw, you simply hope to sleep. At least that passes the time a little faster.
by a Dr. Gary Chapman PhD under Mycroft’s account, and fishes his phone from his trouser pocket.
John doesn’t seem to want to argue the finer points of buttocks, though, and continues to massage your gluteal muscles and kiss you firmly. Without any other option, you melt into his touch instead.
You feel a crease form between your eyebrows,
Just like that, the battle between mounting frustration and attempted patience to see this experiment through was over with a clear victory. An already blush-splotched face fills in with a deeper shade of red, and an unintended pout forms on his mouth. Both thoroughly over this conversation and trying to ignore the twist of confused hurt under his sternum, Sherlock Holmes whirls toward his bedroom door including a billowing of his shiny blue dressing gown for maximum drama.
Thankfully, Mycroft is either too busy or doesn’t care enough to respond.
Sherlock looked very deep in thought as they rode back to Baker Street, so he decides to look out the window at the blur of color in silence. Thankfully this ride is much quicker than earlier today, and soon enough they climb the steps to home and hang up their coats. When their eyes meet, John smiles full-on, trying to show his appreciation for the outing, to say thank you. Instead, his mouth says: “Tea?”
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmGe-LY5HQs
I am so so so sorry about how long it has taken to update this story. I was caught up in other little things, and then I lost my job, and this story kind of filtered down my Word Document list, and.... yeah.
John’s face twists and shakes his head.
John stops all movement immediately and looks up at you with a sliver of fear, holding his breath. You swing your arm vaguely in the direction of the bedside table.
(See the end of the chapter for
I've succumb to the idea this has become a Song Fic. Sue me, everything translates to song lyrics in my head eventually.
then that would be my worst mistake.
no.” He’s so emphatic that you smirk involuntarily.
By the time John returns to 221B, Sherlock has read through it and a variety of other research that cites the book as a reference. His head rests forward on his pressed together hands, now swimming with information and data, barely noticing when John enters the sitting room, hangs his coat, and sits opposite him in the other armchair.
“You see, my good Watson, I find the look of you to be most appealing to my Royal Person. Indeed, I have ne’er-to-fore cast my sight upon a more picturesque arse.” Your voice cracks with barely contained laughter on the last word. John bursts into snorts and gasping, clinging to your hands. You both are a fit of laughter for several minutes.
And yet... here he was plodding through the whys of the warm bloom that spreads in his chest at the sight of stale biscuits.
“Thank you. Seriously. Can I please change out of these wet clothes now? I’m miserable.”
As he sets the tea cup and plate on the kitchen table and continues down the hall to his bedroom, another thought slides by. This one dimmer and nearly missed in his increasingly fatigued state: Did John feel this warmth when he thought of Sherlock? Is that why he set out tea despite knowing Sherlock would not drink it? The detective falters in his stride, a tightness in his throat that he recognizes as anxiety makes him take an involuntary deep breath. Sherlock mimics the face-first fall back into viscous emotions by tipping himself fully clothed face-first into bed. It was too much to contemplate right now, and sincerely hopes sleep will come soon.
“Close the lid, John; I can't delete the image of Lestrade naked while I'm staring at his--his--
“Only people with limited imaginations, which is almost everyone, wrap their Christmas gifts in brown paper and tie them with string,” he said loudly, grabbing the door handle to fling it open. “And it is ludicrous to imagine that thoughts alone, even of one’s dubiously satisfying favorite things, can ease the pain of a dog’s…” The door swung wide.
“I'm perfectly capable of making things unpredictable on my own.”
Greg slumped back on his chair, dropping his mug to the table with a thud. "
Molly groaned in frustration at Greg’s pronouncement and dropped onto the edge of Sherlock and John’s bed with a huff. “Maybe they won't notice if we just slip out?” she asked, even as she knew that was impossible. She and Greg had been the last two guests at the Christmas party when the low level sniping Sherlock and John had been engaging into a full-on fight. With a glance they’d mutually agreed it was time to leave the flatmates alone, but by the time they’d located their coats in the downstairs bedroom, the shouting had begun.
“Delete the fucking app right the fuck now, Sherlock, if you'd ever like to get laid again.”
“I don’t know about that, Mrs. Hudson, but I’m here anyway. How--well--do you think he’s okay?”
To: “John Watson”
“You never saw a Magic 8-Ball before?” The implied “freak” at the end of her question was clear. She shook her head. “You must've grown up on the moon. Ask it a question; shake it up; read the answer in the window.”
He should have known better.
They'd been distracted for about forty minutes on that alone.
"Away from..."
“Cheeky bastard,” John said, and let the wet heat engulf him.
“I'll explain fully another time, but Mycroft is the one who told me about the private blog posts.”
There would be more, very soon. There would be the shattering of walls, and the crashing of resistance, and the sighs of contentment. But right now there were just two hearts and two hands softly brushing against one another in the pale London morning, while all around them a city began its day, never knowing that within the four walls of one flat the entire world was different.
That gave John momentary pause, and then he let out a sigh. “He told you I was coming over. Wanted to make sure you'd be here.” At Sherlock’s brief nod, John let out a short laugh. “Hard to fault him for that. I think he feels invested in this visit. I am glad you're finally home tonight.” He crossed to his chair and sat down, taking a deep breath before opening his mouth to plunge in.
. "Delete. This." For John, just speaking the words was like putting a sword through his own gut.
The best Sherlock John had ever known, though, was a new one: in-love Sherlock. In-love Sherlock had many subsets--cuddle-loving Sherlock; tandem shower-loving Sherlock; the gorgeousness of orgasming Sherlock--but it was the basic, pure, simplest in-love version of Sherlock who had brought John to his knees (often, quite literally). This Sherlock smiled freely at John, constantly. This Sherlock was nearly always touching John, often without realizing it: hands entwined as they walked; an arm tossed across John’s chest in sleep; a hand on a thigh under the breakfast table. This Sherlock tracked John everywhere with his eyes and loved him openly, with words and hands and glances. This Sherlock was all in, and was making no secret of it.
Sherlock stepped in closer, the timbre of his voice lowering. “You certainly seemed to enjoy it when--”
“Please tell me you aren’t answering their Tweets now.”
Sherlock bent his head and ran the tip of his nose along the shell of John’s ear. “Show me?”
6 o’clock, and it wasn't like Sherlock to be an idiot. “You're both miserable. Why don't you tell John to come home?”
There was a hesitation, and then: “No.” And then, before John could say anything else: “I believe we may have each made an error, Doctor Watson.”
"I've warned my brother time and again that caring is a liability. Letting people get close to you ultimately brings nothing but pain."
"London," Sherlock said.
John knew what Sherlock looked like asleep in the dark, and in full afternoon sun, and in the pale foggy light of morning. He knew that Sherlock slept on his stomach (when he wasn't sleeping on his back) (or his left side). He knew that when the air was very dry, Sherlock snored (just a little) but would become very defensive if you ever brought it up, especially if you called it anything like “little nose wheezes.” He knew that Sherlock’s hair looked ridiculous if he slept on anything but a satin pillowcase; that Sherlock would steal the entire blanket and John’s pillow if given the chance; that Sherlock looked both heartbreakingly lonely and impossibly young when he slept.
, who posted that charming article to tumblr.
He felt John chuckle. “The only thing you're required to kiss is me.”
Molly wasn’t surprised to push open the doors to the morgue at 6 o’clock in the morning and find Sherlock slumped over a table, his legs tangled around his stool and his head pillowed on his arms. It had been almost a month since she’d seen him, and she knew from Greg that he hadn’t been taking many cases. She could also see for herself that Greg’s observations about Sherlock’s health had been correct - the detective looked terrible, even in sleep.  Her normal inclination would be to leave him there, but she had a group of students coming in for a rotation at 7 and she needed to prepare. She shook his shoulder gently and then harder when he didn't respond. “Sherlock.
Leave. Leave London, then; that's what Mycroft meant. Leave the clinic, his life, his friends.
“Turns out some anonymous citizen tracked down all 500 bees in the first two days and uploaded the pictures and data to a private website. The scientists are hailing the effort, but there's a bit of a public uproar over...hang on, I want to get this right…’spoiling the most fun offered to amateur melittologists in a decade or more.’ The London Apiology Enthusiasts seem to be quite up in arms about it.” John folded his arms and sat back, waiting. Sherlock met his gaze evenly across the table, but John could see a tiny twitch at the corner of one eye. “Tell me again, love; how were those two days you spent at your parents’ house?”
Except of course Sherlock knows a back way into this museum, has figured out how to jimmy the lock to a sanitation closet that has both an outside wall and an air duct just big enough to crawl through if you're either a lanky consulting detective or a doctor who hasn't been eating enough as of late. By 4:30 Sherlock is cradling a bruised face while John sits on the suspect, knowing that the tripped alarm will bring Lestrade and his raised voice soon enough.
“The public is interested in my methods, John. Who am I to deny them their chance to expand their tiny minds?”
“Wanted to help.” There is a warmth stirring in John’s chest, brought to life by this man who planned an entire crazy jam packed day so that John wouldn't be hurt. He takes the last step to close the distance and carefully slides his arms around Sherlock’s waist, leaning his forehead against the taller man’s shoulder. “You did, Sherlock. You do. You do.”
After another minute John pulled his fingers free and crawled onto the bed, straddling Sherlock’s chest, and bent to kiss him. “I love you,” he breathed, pressing lingering kisses to temples and forehead. “For this, and for everything.” He returned to Sherlock’s mouth and the kiss became sloppy, John’s teeth first grazing and then tugging at each of Sherlock’s lips in turn. Sherlock groaned low in his throat and pulled against the ropes, but John had learned to tie knots in the British Army and they both knew there would be no escape.
“I wouldn’t have done it.”
This fic has the most amazing readers in the world. I've only gotten halfway through the comments (and will get to them all) and wanted to take a minute to say thank you for your fantastic comments, support, angst, and love.
“Yes, honey?”
John sat dumbly in his chair, shaking his head a little. “But. Sherlock, no. No. That isn’t the choice I want to make. I choose you, Sherlock.”
“We should kiss now,” he concluded.
“How did you arrange for the attempted theft?”
“Yes, but…”
It was long moments before they had recovered enough to pick up where they left off, but this time, when Sherlock sank to his knees, John pushed his fingers through the wet curls and just hung on.
Sherlock didn't speak the word aloud, but he might as well have.
From: “Gregory Lestrade”
(After he snapped a quick picture with his mobile to send to Greg and Molly.)
“Sshh.” John laid a finger over Sherlock’s mouth and then replaced it with his lips, tears prickling behind his eyes as Sherlock’s breath hitched and his arms closed tight around John’s back. They kissed for long moments, John trying to soothe as best as he could, before pulling back and cupping Sherlock’s face in his hands. “I knew I shouldn't have gone. I knew when we said goodbye, and I knew every time you texted me. I changed my ticket and skipped the last half day,” he said, rubbing his thumbs gently over Sherlock’s cheekbones. “I'm sorry, love.”
“Tea?”
“You have got to be kidding me,” he groaned, reading over Sherlock’s shoulder. On the screen, under the typed line
.” The alcohol was a bad idea; the unshed tears that had been threatening to burn his world down for days were back in his throat, and eventually he wasn’t going to be able to swallow them away. He could feel Greg waiting for him to pull himself together, and he took what he hoped might be a couple of calming breaths before he tried again. “I told him.”
After, Sherlock took the proffered flannel and gave his mouth and hands a perfunctory wipe. “I'm certainly not complaining about the idea of spending tomorrow in bed, but are we in some sort of competition I don't know about? You have been particularly insatiable the last few days. We're not going to stop having sex when the holiday is over.”
“John, we can--”
“You’re afraid to trust them.” He hesitated, and then nodded, and she took a deep breath and squeezed his hand to stall for time. Somehow he had trusted her enough to bring this to her, even though he knew she hardly had a stellar track record in this area herself. If she didn’t distinctly remember waking up, eating breakfast, and taking the Tube to work, she would think that she was still dreaming. She didn’t want to give him the wrong advice. “Do you want me to take a look and let you know what I think?”
They ended up back on the couch with heaping plates of food and more still on the table next to them. Sherlock insisted everything John had selected tasted better but refused to switch plates with him, nibbling delicately at the choicest pieces of everything available while John shook his head and ate around him. In this way, it was as if they’d never been apart. Sherlock filled him in about Mrs. Hudson and the hip replacement she had scheduled for the spring and John talked about a few of his favorite regular patients that hadn’t made it into the blog posts. They talked about cases Sherlock had been working on and Molly’s nice but incredibly dull new boyfriend and how Sherlock had been trying for two months to get Lestrade to admit that he and Mycroft had gone out to dinner.
“I do mind.”
“19 hours, 42 minutes.”
Sherlock was impatiently rocking back and forth on his feet in front of the window when the cab finally pulled up to the curb. He watched John get out, watched the cabbie help him lift two suitcases to the ground, and watched John shoulder a large backpack (green, left over from his Army days) as the cab pulled away. He should go down and help; that’s what people did. At the very least he should open the door, even though John still had his keys. Or maybe he should just wait in the flat, ready to welcome John home with all the unfamiliar giddiness that was coursing through him.
Sherlock wakes him in the middle of the night and though he is clumsy with the fastenings of his clothes, he is fully awake by the time their feet hit the pavement. It's 3:30 am and the thief has finally made a reappearance, and they are meeting Lestrade and his team at the museum to make the catch.
, okay? Can you?”
“From inside his own bedroom? And then he’d expect there to be, you know, an actual case.”
The vehemence of Greg’s response had John’s head snapping back up. “I’m not moving back to Baker Street, I’m moving to Ireland. For a year, anyway, and then after that, I’ll see. I fucked it up. Sherlock got tired of waiting. Can you blame him?”
John’s heart sank further.
It had been almost two weeks since he’d seen Sherlock, and the last time had been in dim light; they'd been investigating a murder in an alley behind a florist’s, and Sherlock hadn't needed to come by the Yard after. The light in 221B showed Greg everything he'd missed seeing then--skin paler than usual; hands thinner than usual. Shadows under the eyes that looked more like bruises; hair absent its usual product and care.
“And I love you.”
They stayed a while longer, drinking and talking about everything besides Sherlock, and eventually working their way through a couple of burgers. By the time John shook Greg’s hand at the end of the night, he still hadn't decided when to talk to Sherlock.
He'd promised to take Mrs. Hudson’s Christmas cake out of the oven so she could run over and visit with Mrs. Turner, who'd broken her hip.
And he flipped the coin into the air.
John stopped walking and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Well, you're being insufferable
Sherlock’s mouth began to stretch into a smile. “Could have done it faster if I didn't have to keep texting you with false questions from Mummy.”
“I don’t think you’re making the right decision.”
It really only works if they do it together.
“Shut up, you git. Your fan club’s here again. Do they all have police scanners now?”
“Well what the fuck else is new?”
Long moments later, Sherlock raised his head from John’s. His mouth was wet, and his hair had the marks of John’s fingers in it, and he looked relieved and overwhelmed and happier than John had ever seen him.
Something--not a laugh, not a sob--broke free from John’s throat. Hysteria was building. It would burst from him eventually, and he began to silently promise the universe anything it wanted if he could just hold the explosion back until he was alone. “No. It didn’t go well.”
“I can't get him to answer his phone half the time, even when I'm promising an eight. Mycroft says he’s sleeping in his bolt holes half the week and walking the streets all night the other half. You're never with him at crime scenes. He never mentions you. Hell, he never mentions anything. What the fuck is going on?”
“Please...let me suck you, John, I want it…”
“Not at the moment, no.”
He glanced at his watch: just after midnight. Sherlock would still be awake. John could do it now, could tell him now. Suddenly nothing seemed more important.
They might have stayed there awhile longer, just smiling at each other, if John’s stomach hadn't growled again. Instead, they pulled on vests and pants and padded out to the kitchen. The hamper seemed bottomless as they lifted out one dish after another, spreading them across the small counter. John pointed Sherlock toward the dish cabinet as he pulled a corkscrew from a drawer and set to opening the wine that had been nestled underneath all of the food. There was a knock at the door, and he set the wine down.
“I know.” Sherlock began to run one hand slowly down John’s spine, over and over. It was grounding, somehow. “I read all of your letters, and I still didn’t know if I could do...this. I tried to set all of those feelings aside.”
Not until he looked up at his wedding as Sherlock loved him in front of everyone, unflinching and unafraid, and he realized that after all this time he might still be in love with his best friend and not with the woman he'd just pledged his life to. And the merest hint of that mistake was the most terrifying thing of all, so he waltzed with his (pregnant) wife and he went on a honeymoon and he came home and just stopped calling Sherlock.
“Of course not, John! I’m just putting in a search for the new hashtag so I can look at everything later.”
They walked back to the house with their hands tucked into their pockets, each lost in his own thoughts, in his own mix of certainty and fear. Sherlock crowded John into the door as he wrestled the lock open, and barely let him over the threshold before he had engulfed him in a tight embrace.
So it was with complete confidence that he could say that nothing in his life had hurt him more than this moment.
. More than once Donovan had snarked about putting a red carpet along the tape line, but Sherlock just brushed her aside as usual.
. It didn’t help. It could never help. The moon wouldn't be far enough. There’s a difference between moving and moving on, and there is a vast difference between living in the world and surviving in it. Sherlock, surely you have to know by now that since the day we met, any day spent away from you has only ever been a day I survived. I need...I need. For you to understand. To hear me when I tell you now, not just in the letters, that you are the love of my life. That you are all I want.”
John stills briefly, then presses down into your body again firmly. This is a sensitive subject, apparently.

The hand on your shoulder starts to pull away. Before you can overthink and let the moment slip away, you reach up to clasp your hand over John’s. Very deliberately catching his startled gaze, you give his fingers a gentle squeeze. To your absolute delight, a faint pink blush appears on his face and the tips of his ears.
Thank you so much for your patience as my brain meandered its way through this story. I hope it lives up to expectations.
That therapy technique is something my own Therapist gave me years ago. Maybe I should show her this to prove I remembered it!
I feel it, when I sorrow most;
Couple things:
“I... Wh-” John stammers. It’s all too much, the horrid day, this Twilight Zone version of his friend. He’s speechless. He can only scoff and stare incredulously.
A dark chuckle is your only reply. Thankfully, John doesn’t appear to be mean spirited enough to tickle further, but somehow you know this information will be used against you at some point in the future. You open your mouth to lay out, in no uncertain terms, that this is to be kept in absolute confidence but fingertips hook under the elastic band of your pants and the only sound you manage to make is a quiet gasp. Dark blue eyes, mostly black, look up into yours, searching. You raise your jaw minutely, taking in a deep breath, and then nod. John grips the fabric more firmly and steps onto the floor, pulling as he goes. He kisses down your left hip, over your thigh and suckles gently at the inside of your knee when the boxers fall to the floor.
Closing his mouth that he only just realized was hanging open, John fixes his eyes on Sherlock again. He was now fidgeting his hands, waiting, seemingly frozen in place. A cautious smile pulls up the corners of Sherlock’s mouth, while still holding a portion of his lower lip between his teeth. Surprise?
Please feel free to leave feedback or kudos or just say Hi - it really makes my day!
Sherlock rolls his eyes as he rinses the conditioner out of his hair. Certainly, this was a tedious step but the data would be worthless if John realized he was being used as a ‘guinea pig’ (‘lab rat’ would be more appropriate term in Sherlocks’ opinion, but John objected).
Once again fighting to maintain self-control, John closes his eyes and sets his jaw. Despite his best efforts, he can’t hold back a soft grumble, annoyed with this odd coy game while he stands dripping rain water on the rug. A couple heartbeats go by, and he feels a bit steadier, so he decides to play along and properly looks around the room. Really looks. And the longer he does, the more he is sure he must have slipped into an alternate dimension version of his flat. The desks, mantle and bookcase have all been tidied and dusted, no longer looking like a paper bomb went off in their front room. There was a still steaming mug of tea on the cleared off and gleaming coffee table near the sofa. And, the most damning evidence of all this was some kind of hallucination pulls a quiet gasp out of John’s chest.

Mrs. Hudson comes up at one point to be nosy under the guise of bringing up dessert. She claims she made too many lemon bars by mistake, but it is fairly clear she just wanted to prod them for more information. Hadn’t the aural clues of your lovemaking been loud enough for her? Thankfully, John was able to field the questions with grace and only a minor flush of his cheeks. The sight makes your chest feel warm and melty.
You hear footsteps on the stairs on the other side of the wall and warmth fills your cheeks.
“Fuck, John...”
A wet sensation on your belly greets you when you surface again, just to the right of your navel. Involuntarily, you curl away from the contact, abdomen muscles tensing. John pulls away in surprise but then looks up at you with a dangerous sparkle in his eyes.
To his dismay, Sherlock nearly answers. He almost pours it all out on the table before him and let John pick through the raw, jagged mess while he’s stood there without any emotional armor left, stripped naked.
and you can have this heart to break."
Finally, it is finished!
He refocuses on the bright screen in front of him, clearing his throat.
“I’m sure we can find a use for them.” You reply in your best ‘sexy deep’ voice and grin at the sight of the tips of John’s ears growing pink while he replaces the dressing gown on the hook. It is delightful to know you have that effect on him. The euphoric feeling of knowing he wants you rushes up again, filling your brain and nerve endings with bright sparks. John turns back to find you grinning ear to ear and stops short.
Pale, scrutinizing eyes glance up from his laptop to his flatmate, tinkering around in the kitchen, and he intones: “What are your plans for today, John?”
“Take me to bed, John.”
John’s hands on Sherlock’s arse are encouraging as Sherlock moves over him, his mouth back against Sherlock’s, deepening the kiss, as his thighs slide down around John.
John laughs, warm and low, and the sound makes Sherlock feel as though his stomach has detached itself from his body and is floating somewhere out over the open ocean.
He wants to shut it out, it’s too intense; and then he sees the rest of Sherlock’s face, hovering above him.
Other than the sailors up in the rigging and those doing work on deck, the only other men around are a team of lieutenants deep in conversation at the helm.
“Oh my god,” John says and his head is falling back against the mattress, his eyes sliding shut.
And then all thought leaves him as John leans down and takes the head of Sherlock’s cock into his mouth.
Sherlock nods miserably.
Stamford laughs and shakes his head, as if still in disbelief.
John goes on speaking, his voice like syrup, like honey, like molten chocolate drizzling off a spoon.
“J—John…”
“Sherlock, I’m not joking. Let me up.”
Sherlock looks around the table at the faces of John’s messmates, wondering if any of them know what John is up to.
In the wake of his newfound misery, he’s forgotten all about the humiliation at dinner—Anderson’s cruel words, the judging eyes of every passenger in the saloon fixed on him, reading his obsession with John in every shamed line of his body.
, and Sherlock interrupted him before he could complete the task.
Sherlock makes a small shocked sound.
The sounds of the party above them are as raucous as ever, but Sherlock is filled with a sudden anxiety about how much time they have. They cannot afford to waste a moment.
His relationship with his mother has always been strained, but it seems to him that his memories before the age of five differ starkly from those that come after. There is a coldness, a distance in the way his mother has always treated him that seems to have grown markedly worse after that summer. It isn’t as if he saw very much of her growing up, having been looked after by a nurse until he was sent away to school, but to this day, every time he is in his mother’s presence, it is impossible to mistake the penetrating feeling of disappointment emanating from her in regards to every aspect of his person.
The ship’s progress south is evident in the growing warmth of the climate. Each day as they draw nearer to the equator, the winds gather force and the heat of the sun intensifies.
Sherlock feels his cheeks burning again. “What about me?”
As good as it felt, the movements of Sherlock’s mouth on his nipple clearly anticipated what he was planning to do to John’s cock, which so far had had almost no direct stimulation. The need for something,
The rest of the officers disperse in silence. It seems the captain has effectively quashed all feelings of fellowship between them.
John breaks away, breathing hard, his hands dropping to grip Sherlock by the upper arms, holding him in place. “Woah, woah. Easy. Easy now.”
The shot caught the dog directly in the skull. The dog fell motionless with a whimper.
He lies curled in around himself, bleeding fist pressed tight against his heart, heedless of the blood surely ruining his shirt.
He quickens his pace, making sure that the tips of his fingers brush that spot inside of John on each upward thrust—not too hard, but with just enough pressure—until John is moaning, the sound low and helpless, and lifting his hips up to meet every stroke.
“Fuck, just kiss me already.” John rose up against him, capturing Sherlock’s lips with his own. John felt Sherlock melt against him at the contact. He opened his mouth wide and found Sherlock’s tongue. Sherlock let go of his wrists. His hands came down to hold John’s jaw.
Sherlock seizes Miss Hooper by the shoulders, completely forgetting any attempt at discretion in the excitement of his discovery.
“Mr. Holmes?”
The boy does as he is told, and as he lowers himself down, the nickname that the sailors give this particular form of punishment flashes suddenly through Sherlock’s mind:
John is silent for a long time, his fingers continuing their rhythm over Sherlock’s skin. He suspects the gesture might be as soothing to John as it is to him and he is grateful for it.
Next chapter coming very soon. Thank you so much to all of you who have left comments, I can't convey how much I appreciate it!!
Sherlock would hunch up his stiff little shoulders and do just that. He preferred the woods to the large dark house where his family lived. There at least, there were no people to bother him, and there were miles and miles of fascinating plants and creatures to inspect.
Reluctantly, John forced his thoughts back to the situation at hand.
Sherlock is not sure how long they stay in the water, diving through the waves, dousing each other in sea spray before coming together again to kiss in the cool-green shallows, their mouths soft and sliding, their bare feet sinking in the wet sand, their hands moving leisurely over one another’s bodies, the sunlight so bright even through their closed eyelids.
He hesitated on the front step, digging in his pocket for his keys, the glare of the afternoon sun nearly blinding him, as Sherlock loomed behind him like a small, ill-mannered thundercloud.
“Y-yes, John,” Sherlock pants, his whole body shuddering.
John leaned over to set his wineglass back on the floor in an effort to hide his face from Sherlock. The room reeled around him at the movement.
The church must be just on the other side of the building they are standing beside; the sound is so loud Sherlock can feel each peal of the bell vibrating through him.
“Nothing
And so, instead of in a sad lump on the sofa, your yelp brings John dashing down the last few stairs to find you breathless on the floor. You just manage to prop yourself up on your elbows, face flushed and curls fallen in your eyes. With one bent knee leaning up against the sofa and your other leg stretched out straight, it occurs to you much too late that the position is unintentionally provocative. It further does not help that your dressing gown was hiked up your back during the tumble and put your choice of wearing only a t-shirt and pants underneath on full display. Despite obviously not being naked, the posture and long expanse of bare legs in the open air feel nearly as vulnerable.
“Sherlock?” John’s blue eyes were on him. His question was thick with meaning – What's wrong? Can I help? Do you want to give up and go home?
“This is insufferable, John!” He snaps darkly, gripping the edge of the kitchen table dramatically.
Judging by the widening of his eyes, John is just as surprised as you are. The entire world holds its breath.
Thank you for reading! :)
We end now, as they begin.
A thought flies though his mind, bright and a bit jarring: Had John both placed the snacks and also cleaned them up without ever mentioning it? Or, had he mentioned it and Sherlock hadn’t been paying attention? That second one struck him as more accurate, so he accepts it as true.
Welcome to the Awkward Zone, population: 2.
Thank you very much for the comments and kudos so far! I am feeling more confident now. :)
“Oi!” Suddenly, a pillow bounces on your face and both of you collapse into giggles again. Whatever this is (because it isn’t quite sex yet, is it?) is so unlike any other encounters you ever had. Is this how it was supposed to go? Or is this unique? You have no frame of reference. Either way, it is spectacular the way feelings, talking, laughter, sparks of passion all flow into each other near effortlessly. Maybe this is why sappy romance films talk about falling in love with your best friend.
A trip to the A&E
“How long?”
A smirk pulls at the right corner of John’s mouth and you lean to kiss at the bunched skin at the corner of his smile. He hums good-naturedly, squeezing your hand before releasing it to encircle both your wrists loosely with his fingers. Tilting his head slightly, John nuzzles his nose against yours, pressing soft quick smooches across the entire width of your mouth. The exhale through your nose is a blissful hum.
Heads up, there is a somewhat graphic description of John's injuries. I put a line of asterisks (***) so anyone can skip it if needed.
I hold it true, whate'er befall;
“I find myself stuck. On a case. Shouldn’t have shouted at you...”
(See the end of the chapter for
When was the last time someone touched you with such gentle affection? Honestly, you probably would not have let them. Were this anyone else, you would have been
. Maybe a little.”
“What ca—Ah, case! Yes. It’s only a four, but there was nothing else on, so...” Before he could finish the sentence, his mobile phone buzzes on the arm of his chair. His icy green eyes flick down and see Mycroft’s name and:
Without the weight of holding back all of his feelings, John turns his attentions back to you with positively ravenous intent. He brings you both back to full hardness with his deliciously hot mouth all over your neck and chest and grasping hands everywhere. Deliriously, you try to remember to check the bruising on your hips tomorrow. You do your best to return the affection in kind, to impress how much you want him with your touch, but John seems entirely lost and quickly taking you along. You are at his mercy now and are perfectly content to stay that way for now. Tentative John is gone, replaced with the sensual, passionate lover you knew was there somewhere, evidently hidden under his own restraint. The levee had broken and all you could do now was ride out the wave.
You grumble so low it is almost a growl, not particularly fond of being lumped in with ‘everyone’ in general, and especially not after getting such lovely singular attention just a moment ago.
Sherlock barely contains a look of victory. John hadn’t said ‘no’...
“Does knowing that I love you make you less interested in intercourse?”
“John.” You groan, rocking your hips up into his gently, tentatively.
Thank you so much for reading! This fic has exactly 1,000 hits at the time I posted this chapter, which blows my mind.

. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to take a little bit of control here, return some of the adoring affection he had been doling out generously. You smile, putting your hands on his shoulders to push just enough so you have room to stand. You press your lips to John’s once, quick but firm, while pulling his tucked shirt out of his jeans. Both hands slide up under his jumper to his underarms, until he relents to putting his arms up and being disrobed. Once the neck of the jumper has popped off his head, he is grinning with his eyes closed. It is impossible not to grin back, even if he can’t see it. His delight, his sense of humour, the way he finds pleasure in sometimes inanely simple things can be infectious. It was irritating at first. You did not see the benefit of childlike wonder or being ‘easily amused’, but lately you seem to smile and laugh so much more. Begrudgingly, you had to admit it was superior to being haughty and sneering all the time.
.” John tries to mimic your posh tone with a giggle. He curls his hands around yours and kisses at the tips of your fingers. “And what, pray tell, have I done to please you, m’lord?”

ah... involved. Oh, stop looking at me like that!”
“Of course, I remember.” Your voice is a bit more clipped than you meant it. You had been annoyed about being wrong about Irene’s body and John had shouted about being ‘Not Gay’. Not exactly a great memory, given the current circumstances.
In which John needs a little help
When he is finally home, John hangs his sodden jacket and worthless umbrella, and runs his hands through his hair to stop it dripping down his forehead. His plan is to go upstairs to his room, change out of his cold, wet clothes and maybe get a hot shower, but only a couple of stairs up he hears his name called. He takes a shuddering breath and turns, carefully resisting the rising pressure to absolutely unload how bad his day was if Sherlock so much as hints that something around the house needs done. The very last thing he needs after this wretched day is a shouting match.
Sherlock experiments with the Love Language of 'Touch'
John thinks, followed by a fleeting mental image of brushing his own fingers across that mouth, testing how soft his lips must be. He blinks and sweeps the daydream aside, a little surprised by it. He must be pretty tired...
John starts to move, pulling you back to reality. There is a detangling of limbs, murmured words of comfort and love. You don’t know much more after that; sweet, gentle kisses on your face send you off to sleep.
Questions flood into your mind with bright chasers of panic because you can’t answer any of them. How long? When? How? Why me? Why? How did I miss it? Me?
With an almost audible crack, the tension coiling up and ready to pounce as anger breaks instead. He finds himself laughing high pitched and wild like a hyena. When it subsides, he takes the mug from Sherlock’s hands.
“It’s fine.” Came John’s quiet response. “I’d be happy to help.” This was more gentle than the detective anticipated, which, frankly, did nothing to alleviate the twist in his chest. Hope, however, did rush through him that this experiment may work after all.
I promise I won't cry if you point them out so I can improve. Thank you for reading! :)
Sherlock wraps up his experiment and presents his paper for peer review.
Your knees are suddenly unsure they can hold your weight anymore.
Despite the current empirical evidence, it is difficult to believe this is real. Maybe you did fall asleep in the nest on the sofa after all, and your touch-starved body was imagining the leather as a warm body. Maybe that was the ineffable need that had you aching this morning but couldn’t place why. Even as you think this, John’s hands slide inside your dressing gown to grip gently on your ribs, then slide feather-light down your sides to settle on the top of hipbones, never ceasing his soft kisses. It feels like your nerve endings light up in bioluminescent ripples under his palms, cascading sensation into a shiver.
Thank you very much for all the kind comments and kudos. It has been a real pleasure to connect with people on this little sliver of my mind. One more chapter for these two sillies.
