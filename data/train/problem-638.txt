Greg: God, that WAS brutal.
The sound of a throat being cleared was like a gunshot. They both looked up to see Lestrade silhouetted against the dull light of the streetlamps behind him. He shuffled his feet a little.
I’m not dead.
: It is, yes. But again, they are trained for difficult situations.

Irene: We have no communication…..yet?
The Hab temperature can be adjusted to create a good environment for plants, there are no pests or weeds or anything, and no bad weather conditions. I think this could work.
: You are in contact with the crew, though?
Well, everything is fine! Pressure is good, all the machines are working. I checked the soil under the microscope and the bacteria were alive and well! Going to clean up the Hab and celebrate with a Friends marathon!
Irene: Oh, shut it.
“I’ve hurt you too,” He placed his hand on John’s smaller one. Long pale fingers against tanned blunt ones.
“You’re always brilliant,” he says.
I’m going to drive in circles around the Hab, to test the lifespan of the batteries and to make sure the harness and the solar cells stay put. That way I can easily walk back to the Hab if anything goes wrong.
But Ares IV won’t be for another 4 years! Isn’t this too soon?
If we want to get it there in time, we need to build a presupply in three months. That’s half the time it usually takes.
I’m going to clean the solar farm this afternoon, as I’ll be looting it tomorrow.

Sherlock beams at her.
“John?” Sherlock looked at him questioningly, a little crease between his brows. John’s hand was hovering between the bowl and Sherlock, and the cloth had been dripping on his jeans. Right. He cleared his throat again.
Date: Dec. 24
“We’ll find it, love”, John soothes. “Let’s have some tea first, alright? I’ve bought those apple tarts you love so much. Lisette says she makes them just for you, I guess she still wants to steal you away.”
Molly: Okay.
for helping me with this chapter! And Risah also made the artwork for this chapter and it's so amazing, she's the best!
LOG ENTRY: SOL 23
Commander Sholto is not at fault. God, I hope he doesn’t beat himself up about this.
“I smell coffee,” he croaks. John nods at the table.
: It was very moving. We now know, of course, that John did survive. How do you think he’s doing, based on your professional knowledge?
12.25.2035 - 14:32
I hope you guys are doing okay. I understand it must be hard for you to deal with everything that has happened, but I want to stress again that we admire the way Commander Sholto and the rest of the team have handled the situation. You have all correctly followed the emergency protocols, and you all know the risks involved with these missions. Please don’t blame yourself for this tragedy. We will all miss John. In fact, that is why I’m contacting you now.

“It was quite...sexy,” he continued, his voice a low rumble.
“I know what you mean,” Sherlock interrupted. “It was a good night.”
They stood there for a few long moments, sharing warmth and promises.
Irene: Well, welcome to the big leagues, honey!
: We have some footage here to illustrate, this is from the Hermes - during their trip to Mars.
Well, that wasn’t a complete failure!
He feels the blood rushing to his face, his heart beating in his ears, waiting for a reaction. Sherlock is studying John, his hand slowly coming up to touch his own face.
Molly: He wrote on it with a marker.
: We’re back with a new Watson Report! John has been very busy the last few days, so let’s find out what it’s all about! We have an interesting guest for you today, don’t we Richard?
Nitrogen: 22%. Oxygen: 9%. Hydrogen: 64%.
Prompt: Adrenaline-fueled rough Johnlock kisses after solving a big case.
I think the USS Potato is ready for a real test.
“Who’s this?” Sherlock asks, planting his finger on one of the pictures. John leans in close to see who Sherlock’s asking about.
Jesus, Sally. Why do you only have ancient series and rom coms on your personal drive?
Many thanks to my lovely beta's:
Mars is, once again, not very cooperative.
And I’m talking to a non-existing audience. Fantastic. Isolation is really working out for me.

I can’t tell you how hard it is to bring all this dirt for the potatoes into the Hab. I need to get it through the airlock, which takes AGES and I need to do it in stages, so the soil can become fertile. I can’t just dump it all in there. I have to be careful with my shoulder and my whole body is aching.

At least all my misery has paid off.
Sherlock
Date: Jan. 23
SH: The direction he took triggered my memory. I had to check to be sure, but the coordinates match with Watson’s direction, and it’s also a longer trip, so that fits with the data as well.
So that is my current status. I’ll need to check up on the rest of the equipment and find a way to get the communication back, but for now I think I’ll go get some sleep.
: Of course. We do have a little clip of James Sholto’s speech here.
: That’s still a long wait, though. How about food and supplies?
Now, I know my specialty is medicine and the human body, but I am a biologist, so that should get me somewhere. I also have all the notes our dear botanist friend Henry has left behind - so I went through them and I think it might be possible.
At first I was a bit hesitant to go back into the Hab, but I tried not to think explosive thoughts. I rigged the regulator, bringing the oxygen level down to 3%. Then I used a battery, some wires and a small canister of oxygen to burn of a little hydrogen at a time. Worked great!
Irene: Right. You’re a director?
Irene: You guys better get ready for the press conference, it will be fucking brutal. They are like bloodhounds out there, watch your ankles.
“I didn’t like her!” John protests.
I’m not exactly sure how to proceed, I’m still a bit dazed by the news, but I know we can’t keep this quiet for long and we need to formulate a plan.
From: michael.stamford@nasa.gov
I’ve more than enough space in the Rover to store food and water for the trip. If I drive to the Ares IV site, I’ll have to bring the oxygenator, but for this drive the O2  and CO2 filters will do.

Subject: Rescue
According to analysts, the best rescue option would be to travel to the Ares IV site, could that be what he’s planning?
Houston, January 26, 2036
: And how does the Ares IV crew feel about this operation?
Although Sherlock was oddly touched, he still huffed and sulked all the way back to 221B, where he dropped on the sofa and ignored John, thinking about several ways he could put the maggots to use in combination with John’s sock drawer. When John brought him a cup of tea in a clear attempt to pacify him, he softened a bit.
Mike: Still, if he finds it and manages to fix it, it could be a means of communication…it might be as simple as cleaning the solar cells. And if he can’t, it’s a good thing he’s not going to Ares IV right now.  I’ll need to call JPL, just in case he manages it. Sherlock, can you come to my office, please?
Subject: Sherlock Bloody Holmes
From: michael.stamford@nasa.gov
As we agreed earlier, we will research all options we have to try to save John Watson. As Director of Mars Missions, you are in charge of this project, and we will contact all necessary people when our research demands it. We will still continue preparing for Ares IV, but Watson is clearly our priority now.
The song came to an end, and the next track was another slow dance. They stopped moving, but John didn’t look worried or shy. Relieved, Sherlock found it was the easiest thing in the word to pull at John’s hands to press their bodies together and settle his hands low on John’s back. He felt John’s arms circle around his neck and his soft hair tickle against his cheek. John sighed softly, his breath grazing Sherlock’s ear.
Yours,
I have just saturated the soil in the Hab with most of the water I had, and I deactivated the atmospheric regulator. That way it won’t pull the water out of the air and the place will be nice and humid. There will be enough condensation to keep the potatoes happy until I’m back.
John felt his face heat up, the memories of his stag night flooding back. He hadn’t realised what it all had meant, not until Sherlock’s speech, and by then he had made his choice. John wasn’t someone to go back on his steps. When Sherlock was gone, he had mourned him, and the feelings he’d never expressed. Mary had come out of nowhere, a light in the darkness. And then the stupid git had come back, and it all went tits-up. But despite his confusion, he had made a promise, and he had intended to keep it. Of course, when Mary didn’t turn out to be who he thought she was, that changed everything. Between him and Mary, anyway.
Greg: Thanks for the uplifting pep talk. I feel so much better now.
I have plenty of oxygen, but no hydrogen. But I can use the rocket fuel from the MDV! Bill landed the thing so well (thanks, mate!), we have a bunch of fuel left: litres and litres of hydrazine. Each molecule has 4 hydrogen atoms, so every liter of fuel makes 2 litres of water!

To: michael.stamford@nasa.gov
Irene: John is alive.
All it needs is a spark. And I’m a crater.
There are other things I could plant, but I need calories, and potatoes are the best source I have. We have enough vitamin supplements on board, so I don’t need to worry about that.
From: mycroft.holmes@nasa.gov
Irene: Hmmm. It could have been better. You kept reminding them that Watson could die.
The art for this chapter is a collab with Risah - thanks for whipping up a sketch so quickly, you are the bomb!
This is not easy to say, but during the processing of the Ares III site satellite images Molly Hooper found some irregularities that seem to indicate that John Watson survived the storm that led the crew to evacuate. There is strong evidence that he’s still alive and living in the Hab at this moment.
“They’ll love your garden, Sherlock, it’s gorgeous!”
Mike: Sure thing!
“Thanks, Sherlock,” John answers sarcastically. “But can you just go over it with me one more time? Slowly? Please?”
Sherlock swooped down again, capturing John’s mouth once more and John tasted the coppery tang of blood where the skin was broken. He brushed his tongue over the wound, lapping at the blood until Sherlock hissed impatiently. John deepened the kiss then, keeping Sherlock’s head in place with one hand, while the other was still clutching his hip. Sherlock pulled back, breathing hard and pushing his nose against John’s, so he could look down where he reached for John’s fly.
Michael,
“It’s Molly.” John whispers. He feels a large hand on his shoulder, smoothing his jumper down his back. He turns and grips at Sherlock, his hands fisting in the crisp shirt. He cries. He cries for Molly, for Greg, for Mrs. Hudson, for Sherlock. The tiles are cold beneath his feet, but they don’t move for a long time.

WELL FUCK!
I have an idea, but it’s insane.
: We have some of the images here. Let’s have a look. What is going on in these?
“Morning, John,” Sherlock said briskly, getting his mind back on track. “Tea?” John nodded and suddenly froze in the middle of the kitchen, staring at Sherlock. “Are you alright?” Sherlock inquired. “You’re not hurt, are you?” It would be typical for John to take care of others and minimise his own wounds. John cleared his throat and sat down.
Before we left on this mission, Ella told us that keeping logs was good for our mental health. I really doubt that, but it might be useful for NASA in some way if they ever find this. And besides, it keeps me busy. But maybe I should start at the beginning.

NASA GROUP CHAT/ TEAM WATSON
, for all their patience and support!
Anyway, it’s a really really good thing that NASA doesn’t know what I’m about to do. Or that Commander Sholto isn’t around. They would lose their collective shit.
Sherlock hated to go in for paperwork, but on the other hand he loved the opportunity to gloat and show the incompetent idiots of the Met how it’s supposed to be done - so generally he didn’t make a fuss about it. John certainly seemed eager to get it over with, and the sooner it was done, the sooner they could go back home and watch crap telly or check their inbox for a new case.
Mycroft,
: Communication would be brilliant, the problem is that there are no supplies at the site. We’re not sure he can make the return trip when he gets there, it’s incredibly dangerous.
The soil is doing pretty good, and it’s great to keep me busy, but I’ve been calculating and even if the potatoes do really well, it won’t be enough to live off for a very long time. My estimate is that the potatoes can buy me about 90 days. So if I add that to the days my rationed meal packs can get me, my food will be gone by Sol 490. And Ares IV will land on Sol 1412...
Molly: Oh, no - I just work there. I’m nobody, really.
I’m a bit worried about safety, but if I don’t try this, I’ll starve to death, so I don’t have much choice here.
: Without any form of communication, I can’t imagine it being easy, no matter how strong you are. But John performed really well in his tests. Of all of them, I think he’s definitely the best at putting things in perspective, he’s not one to give up easily, and he’s very resourceful. That’s also the reason he’s still alive in the first place, I think.
Irene: Yessir!
So, I’m hiding in the Rover now. Because I’m an idiot.
He still doesn’t understand how Sherlock doesn’t know. Sherlock knows everything about everybody in one glance, but he seems oblivious to Johns intentions in setting up this stupid study date. He can’t rely on Sherlock simply figuring it out. He can’t wait any longer, he can’t keep it contained, he feels so wound up around Sherlock lately. It needs to be over today.
Irene: Well, it’s seems like risk is no objection for our friend, what with the plutonium and all.
“Mrs. Hudson…” Sherlock’s voice trails off. John takes his hand.
Then Sherlock starts inching forward, very very slowly. His hand trembles a little when he places it on John’s arm. John’s breath rushes into his lungs, Sherlock’s fingers burning through his shirt. Still moving carefully, Sherlock presses first his nose, and then his lips against John’s cheek. John realises he’s mimicking his own movements, but so softly, as if he wants to savour the experience, and perhaps make notes after.
LOG ENTRY: SOL 36
Mike: Working on that as well. Just say we’ll try everything to bring him home.
SH: Well, yes. But it’s quite sturdy.
Irene: You asked for my opinion, if you don’t like it, you can piss off!
But for now it’s just you and me, Mars. I hope we’ll get along.
Greg: But where else would he go?
To: Mycroft.holmes@nasa.gov, michael.stamford@nasa.gov, gregory.lestrade@nasa.gov
Apart from my eardrums and burned clothes, I seem to be fine too, thank god. The shoulder is acting up a bit, but I’ll just have to deal with it. I’m going to call it a day, and tomorrow I’ll check the equipment and do a full system check.
Date: Dec. 22
: John looks like a fun guy.
“You need to loosen up for this, Sherlock! Just feel the music and stop thinking so hard! Have fun!” John shouted over the music. Despite Sherlock being almost a head taller, John was confident and sure in his movements, and Sherlock noticed he felt instinctively where John wanted him to go. He realised John wasn’t judging him, wasn’t looking for mistakes. He also noticed he wasn’t thinking about whether John was making any mistakes, or how they looked together. He was just enjoying himself, letting the music and John guide him.
NASA GROUP CHAT/ TEAM WATSON
Subject: Satellite time denied?
John is struggling with the plastic bags, fumbling to get the door open, when he hears Sherlock shouting and, apparently, destroying his study. He drops the bags and goes to investigate. He finds Sherlock in the middle of his room, surrounded by papers and books, the chair pushed over, hands pulling at his hair.
I better get back to my manure. On the plus side: I’m getting used to the smell.
Hope to hear from you all soon,
From: gregory.lestrade@nasa.gov
Let me tell you: it’s not fun to crawl through the Martian desert with an antenna sticking out of your body. But what else was there to do?
He loves Sherlock like this. Relaxed, calm and completely in John’s hands.
John helps Kevin unpack in silence. Once they’re all done Kevin turns to him. “John..?”
Greg smiles back at him. “I’ll keep you on that one!”
John sits up straight. “What’s in it for you?"
“I might have changed something~” Sherlock answers in the same soft voice. “Do you regret it?” Sherlock’s smile disappears.
“Oh John, I’m so glad you’re okay…” She says and she pulls back, looking John all over. “I missed you so much.” She says with tear in his eyes. John doesn’t say anything back. He just looks at her as if she’s something he can’t explain. “Sherlock told me what happened. It was not your fault John, it was all selfdefense.” John blinks a couple of times and slowly progresses what his mother has just said.
A week has passed and John finds himself at the address that was on the card the guy gave him some time ago. It is a normal looking apartment. Not too big neither small. John takes a deep breath and knocks on the door.
“Did you do something to him?” Sherlock bit his lip and she forms her lips in a small ‘o’. she pulls him closer. “Whatever it is he obviously forgave you by looking at the texts.”
“Mind if I join?” Johns asks and Sherlock shakes his head. John starts to strip as well and they both get into the bathtub. John decides that he’s going to sit behind Sherlock now. As much as he liked what happened last time they shared a bath he wants to enjoy this day a bit longer. Sherlock leans against John’s chest and closes his eyes while John plays with his hair.
John can’t believe it. He just walks off like this. No 'thank you', nothing. But he doesn’t want him to go. He wants to spend more time with Sherlock. He likes him. He likes talking to him because he was so bloody interesting and smart. He can teach John things. Things about his kind, about the ocean, about the creatures that live there. John clenches his fist.
He stands slowly, trying not to look anywhere but the man's face. Outside the car doors close. On his left the handle of the closet door turns gently. Brent rushes to him impatiently, pushing his shoulder forward while the gun almost brushes his nose. 'Come
Not beta-ed, not brit-picked, not first language. If there's any grammar error, please tell me.
'Oh.'
‘It's okay.’
'I love you.'
He squats slowly. 'Sherlock was not supposed to die.' he informs the cat, who opens both eyes now. 'How can we fix this?'
'Yes.' he answers nonchalantly. 'She's working at the TI department  of an unimportant enterprise in Canary Wharf. Only façade of course. Mycroft made sure there will be a restriction order by tomorrow morning, when she usually is at her job. Perhaps they will even get free publicity.'
'By all means do it.'
'What case? He didn't tell me anything.' John feels anxious already. He had sent messages the whole day and even called Sherlock, but there was only silence on the other hand. He had decided on a whim to pay him a visit after picking up Rosie from the sitter, only to find 221B empty.
-- * --
'Wait,
They collapse against each other. Anna shoots, and the bullet scratches his shoulder on its way to the ceiling. It burns painfully, but he still manages to throw her on the floor and hold her arm straight to her side. She is stronger than she looks, comprehensible in her chosen profession, but still weak and sloppy from being in the hospital.
Sherlock talks to Mycroft on the phone by the entrance of the cafeteria, out of range enough so John can’t listen to him, but mindful to keep himself always in sight. Which is very good, because John really needs to look at him now, so he doesn’t think about things he’s not prepared to. Sherlock borders on hyperactive child. He can’t speak without gesticulating wildly, walking in circles and making faces that belong to performing arts.
'Harassing some nurses.' Mycroft replies. 'You'll find him at the reception.'
'I want to to go back to the clinic after my maternity leave finishes.' Anna just
Some hours in the night his bladder troubles him so he goes to the loo. When he comes back there's a faint light in the room. Anna is checking her phone. Climbing back on the bed, however, he realises it's his own phone.
Later, Sherlock takes a shower and John stands by the sink brushing his teeth. Sherlock keeps talking about how easy it is to identify the sexual predators in the reality show house, but the producers just generally opt not to. John gives one or two comments on it with his mouth full of foam.
'He's probably afraid you'll disappear on him again, you know.'
'Word has spread out, I'm afraid.'
Sherlock tries not to show his trembling hands, so he grips hard the man's shirt. 'John. John.' he murmurs to the doctor's neck, eyes closed.
The men look at him in confusion, not knowing how to proceed. He surges forward and removes the box from the closer one's hands, throwing it over the bed. The second one raises his hands in a placating attitude a second before John closes the drawer on his fingers. 'Don't doubt for a second that I'll get physical if you don't leave the room this instant!'
John groans. 'I question myself everyday if all this is worth and then I feel guilty for doing it, and then angry that I can't feel comfortable and-'
It's not Mycroft, but one of his minions, who delivers a small envelope in his hand and leaves without a word, to which John just raises one eyebrow. The envelope is addressed to him, and the USB stick is inside. He sits Rosie on the high chair with her giraffe and her toy piano, and she proceeds to smash it randomly to produce noise. Sherlock has been setting up his laptop, and it is ready for them when he sits down beside him.
'Of course I'm going to try again.' Sherlock says in his best "You are an idiot" voice. 'You are a semi-feral animal, and these things take time. I'm going out.'
His eyes were bluer than ever, John thought idly. He shrugged.
'It was in the engine.' Mary says quietly. 'I turned on the car and heard a strange noise. I ran back here without turning it off, and it exploded.'
'Don't play silly with me Dr. Watson. I'm tired of you.
John exhales, not sure when he had held his breath. 'It worked?'
-- * --
His head is foggy and the tub starts to move, making him fall to his knees on the wet floor. An automatic part of his brain guides him to cover his mouth with his hands in a shell shape, and breath into the tiny space created.
'Really? Deal with him, that's what you do now? I thought you had stopped dealing with people after Magnussen.'
John takes the opportunity to slide his arm around Sherlock's waist. None of them are much for PDA, but Sherlock is welcoming, tilting his body an inch to his direction. 'You don't have to worry, you know?'.
'No!'
'No.' he falls back in a relaxed manner, as much as possible given the circumstances.
'Are you… cooking?'
The video ends. Sherlock sits still beside him. 'Are you all right?'
. He promptly returns it to the bag. Sherlock grabs it and tucks it inside a cupboard. He looks terribly embarrassed.
Sherlock boggles at John, who is beaming expectant at him. 'Certainly yes. What do you want to dance?'
She looks at him in awe. 'What you mean, "about what"? Don't play dumb with me John Watson. You disrespecting me!' she answers with an already rising voice.
‘Well, I’m not really sure we advanced much.’ she answers. ‘But she wasn’t hostile to the conversation. I tried not to push too much at once, and I was hesitant because she was a bit strange.’
John turns to him, worry written all over his brow and eyes lines. 'You don't have to, you know that right? In the end, Rosie's safety is my responsibility. You love the work. It's part of who you are and if I take that from you...'
He flinches. ‘He is amazing. Abrasive and cocky sometimes, yes. But most people don’t
He reclines once again, taking a moment to regard the older Holmes. He sees some parallels between them, just like he and Harry have their similarities, and yet the two pairs of siblings are so different from each other. 'But you're not minor either, Mycroft. He can do something else, I'm pretty sure there are a number of services he can provide without being thrown to the lions every opportunity. Look, if you want me to beg, I will.'
'Ok, can you explain what were you doing?' his initial anger coming back.

'It's comprehensible, John, ' she had told him with a condescending smile. 'It's a new phase of your life. Obviously you are nervous. Why don't you and Sherlock leave for a bit, uhn? Catch some criminals, fresh air!'
Dinner is a bizarre affair in all aspects. First, Anna is behaving like nothing ever happened. She's all sweet smiles and bold looks and easy conversation, like back when they were dating. But the cherry in the pie is when she reclines a bit in her seat to consider him. 'You never ask about me.' She affirms with wonder.
'What did you eat?'
'You were walking with your eyes closed?' John questions while cautiously maneuvering the teenage's fractured nose, whose cartilage was so flaccid his mother stayed outside, not wanting to look.
Sherlock takes a look at him and John
'Great!' he throws his hands up, smiling at her. 'I am so grateful you are back at killing people just so you can buy a fancy coat for your husband.'
The stairs to the floor were going to be redirected and remodeled into a spiral staircase to give space for another spiral staircase going downstairs, to 221C, which was going to be converted into several smaller rooms: a guests bedroom, a lab for Sherlock, a storage room and a reception office for clients, equipped with a lavatory. The front door of 221C would lead to the office, and a private corridor that only someone with a key could access would take them to the rest of the flat. The staircase gets to a foyer in front of all the rooms, that would share the bathroom in the foyer. The idea was to separate the Work from their day-to-day life, specially for Rosie's safety.
'Oh, you never saw the photos from our honeymoon! I printed an album, let me get it!' she bolts to the bedroom and comes back with a white cardboard box full of pictures, and he spends the next 40 minutes looking over every photo from their honeymoon at the beach. About to start on the wedding photos his phone chimes once.
Todd had started to show his hand through anonymous letters, proclaiming to admire her work as a public prosecutor. Keona had dismissed the letters at first, but their tone grew more and more alarming. The writer knew which cases she had been on, and talked about them, telling her how she looked, and what she ate at the intervals, and how late she arrived home. She showed the letters to the police for the first incident report, but they told her if the audiences were public, anyone could be watching, so they could do nothing about it.
'Wait, did you try to enter my bedroom?'
The man in question grunts from the kitchen. He is putting his lab equipment in boxes to take downstairs to his recently finished new lab room. Both spiral staircases going up and down are the last things to be added, and by the next week (and after a good cleaning), the flat would be ready.
Not betaed, not brit-picked, not first language. Any mistakes let me know!
It will take at least six weeks for the project to be finished, and this is only after they can finally begin the service. It turns out Sherlock had consulted a number of architects before reaching a final proposal with efficient alterations within his budget. The plumbing that supplies the bathroom at 221B for some reason cruises over 221C's ceiling, being the culprit for the constant mould. So the pipes are going to be redirected.
They avoid each other's gaze some more. They hear some clacking noises and are reminded of Anna's presence in the living room.
'John, there's something… I should say;'
'Technically second. And many times jealousy isn't logical anyway. I just wanted to say that… I don't see myself going out there ever again, ok? I don't even entertain the possibility. I don't just say I love you to anyone.'
'Some years ago. Lestrade knew him, briefly.'
Greg stands awkwardly, waving his arms, clearly not knowing what to do. 'I have to get back to work then. Give me a call when you are discharged.'
'Yeah, well. Developed new habits. Once my body gets into routine it's hard to break it.'
He sits down close, while Sherlock positions himself better in the bed. John passes him the notepad.
His chest lifts a bit, when he hadn't noticed it was so constricted. 'Thank you, Lestrade. I owe you this.'
Sherlock minimally shakes his head, like swapping away a mosquito or a strange thought, and ignores his sad attempt of a joke. 'Not only that, but you seem to have developed strange habits. You hole yourself up at night, lock your bedroom when you leave-'
Out of nowhere a door bangs and he sits up quickly, making the room spin. It takes a bit to realise with great confusion that he had been sleeping in Sherlock's bed and he doesn't even remember getting there.
'You don't have a sleeping pattern or you avoid sleep so you don't have nightmares?'
Sherlock obeys, finding himself once again sitting in John's lap. When their lips touch he stops thinking about Anna or Sholto or Victor. Mrs. Hudson hums downstairs to a pop song on the radio, the smell of fried bacon and eggs coming up. Everything was fine.
Mary is giving the bottle to Rosie in the living room. She doesn't really like to breastfeed, so she usually pumps it out many times a day and saves the excess in the fridge. Having already lots of bottles stored helped a lot when she ran away.
Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective - only one in the world! - has a sweet tooth. He writes on a post-it "Buy some treats to Sherlock" and puts it on his agenda. Then he is taken aback by the date. Tomorrow would be January 6th.
He straightens up. 'I'll get a bucket. Will you be ok for a minute? I'll be very quick.'
Rosie rolls to her back on the carpet.
!' he yells at them.
John doesn't answer him, so he leaves. Closer to lunchtime, Mrs. Hudson comes over. John had been dreading this would happen, so he pretends to sleep the whole time. He can hear her sniffing, so he counts backwards from 100 to distract himself. She also leaves.
and tries to move away, but John holds him firmly and turn his back to his own view. Sherlock's shoulders get very tense.
'I need to categorize better the patterns of human behaviour.' he ignores her, murmuring to himself. 'I got too much data all at once and now it's messed up.'
'Remember I suggested a dinner to thank him? This is a perfect opportunity! A celebration dinner! Tomorrow night, what do you think?'
Sherlock smiles dryly. 'We have to try.'
Sherlock blinks once at him. 'You know what, John? Piss off.'
He swallows and nods.
Mary is still watching TV when he closes the front door. A rerun of Strictly Come Dancing is on.
'I'm here.' he murmurs, massaging the long hands to increase the blood flow. 'Everything will be ok.'
Greg whistles. 'Sounds bad. Not trying to be nosy, but what could you have possibly said that he was that angry?'
'About my life before.'
'Last time you were here you said you were going to propose to your girlfriend. Also, your friend came back, which was quite surprising by the way, but you seemed very content. And the last post was about your wedding day.' she says with a knowing look. He flexes his hands. 'Is this about your marriage?' she finishes.
At Milwaukee she had lunch and played tourist. Jake Chapman worked late on tuesdays. It was dark and the street deserted when she parked around two blocks from his house. She had to wait just an hour or so to see him coming down the avenue in his motorcycle.
They just stare at each other for a long moment. Sherlock keeps the towel between them as a shield, very much aware that he's starkers, and it makes him the most vulnerable person in the room. 'I'm not using drugs, if that's what you're thinking.'
, and John bites his smile.
As for the house per se, he had to wait but finally the confirmation came: UK State officially changes his status to widower.
’Yeah, I’m… coming to terms about some… stuff.’
The flat isn't the same without Sherlock in there. Too much silence for once. And yet there is something purple-ish growing in three saucers on the kitchen's table, rosin stains by the windowsill, and a handmade diagram for inflicted asphyxiation resting on the sofa. John feels more at ease here than at his house in the suburbs.
'Stop that. What's the point?' he sighs, rubbing his face. He doesn't approach the bed, keeping at least six feet of distance between them.
It's only in the next morning that the penny finally drops about everything. It's not good.
'Nope. I don't want to hide behind alcohol this time. I need to move on.'
Sorry for the delay. But I have internet at home now *yey*
She succeeds in turning their positions, straddling him and bringing the gun to his face and he can't
John immediately drops everything, pulling back his head to look at his face. The grey-blue eyes are hidden behind closed eyelids. The muscles around them are locked, he couldn't be mistaken as a sleeping person. Some seconds later, John's being stared down again. He can't move much farther than he is because Sherlock never released him.
Sherlock appears again fully dressed to leave. 'It just crossed my mind that you could possibly not want my presence while dealing with marriage issues, will that be a problem?'
They regard each other for a moment, and Mycroft does a concession move with his head. 'Ok then. Dr. Watson, would you see me to the door?'
There's a pause. 'Is this a case you're busy with?'
'You could have died today.' John replies with a constricted voice.
He goes to safe distance from the plane. Anna holds his hand triumphally, still smiling, and in comparison to Sherlock she's so repulsive to him, but he lets her, he goddamn lets her because that's what he and Sherlock planned, and he had thought they would be together for him to bear, and now he foresees miserable months as the plane takes off.
'Would you mind staying with Rosie for the day? Can you do it? I can't go over details on the phone, but you know the drill.'
So Mary… Anna-Greta's transgression wasn't so bad. He could live without knowing. It wouldn't matter - or it shouldn't - that someone wanted their past to be erased.
He adjusts his position on the chair. 'After I came back to London we didn't have much to talk about. We emailed amenities few times, but after the scandal about him he stopped answering. Suppose we couldn't understand each other anymore. But I was happy that he went to my wedding.'
'Go on, I'll stay with her.' she rushes him. 'Take that silly man out of trouble.'
? You don't want to kill her!'
(See the end of the chapter for
'Well, yeah.' he shrugs. 'Are you ok? Did Sherlock do something? You sound a bit… I don't know.'
'Ah, well, you know, we were all brothers in arms, cliché and everything' he told looking at the table, his mouth doing funny moves.
'Not really… Let's say I did lie after that. I wanted to be with me daughter.'
So he logs on Facebook instead. There are some messages in his inbox, but a quick check guarantees it's nothing important. He scrolls down his feed, past cat videos and stupid jokes and someone campaigning to help a child's surgery when a Time's post popped. Magnussen apparently died of sudden cardiac arrest caused by an undetected hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It made him slip on his bathroom and hit his head on the sink, so it was too quick for help. John has never seen a bigger euphemism for shot in the head.

And then he came back like a phoenix

'Yeah, sorry. Lovely dinner!' he's speaking in the manner he reserves for obstructive clients. John and Anna get up too.

'Let's start over, John.' she says suddenly, softly. 'Let's erase all this. Let's move somewhere else. Only us. Let's make plans! We never did it, we just went along with the moment, but we can do it now! I promise!'

'John.' Mycroft smiles at him close-lipped. 'I was in the middle of a meeting with a chancellor four time-zones away.'

people react certain ways. Obviously this leads to disagreement as to how valid someone's reactions are, since many are fairly irrational and should not warrant the consequent attitude. John always argues with him that if one can identify patterns of conduct caused by a specific set of emotions, reactions may not be rational, but are indeed logical - and therefore predictable.
'To move in.' Sherlock says in his "you're an idiot" tone. 'Aren't you, moving in?'
'What are you talking about? What is it that moron-John hasn't seen
He spent months regretting the pregnancy, and when he finally sets his mind and heart to it, it's taken away. It's his fault, it's his fault. He caused it, he wanted it and it happened.
'Really though?' he replies sarcastically. 'I don't know a single creature with poorer social skills than you. And you throw the sociopath card around so people don't know. You are aware of your limitations.'
On the first day he waits in vain, because nobody appears. He follows Keona to work, and Todd is there. Keona does what Sherlock told her to, which is to take a pre-accorded cab to a place at home's general direction, and then get another random cab back to a different hotel. Todd wouldn't see the move if he took the tube, and would be slow in getting a cab during rush hour, so to keep the pretence she had come back home. He can't know she's not in her original location now.
'Very well. Please contact me if you need anything.' he leaves as suddenly as he arrived.
after all these years? You can't be that stupid!'
. He stops himself and deletes the post.
The git has the nerve to roll his eyes at him. 'I know that, John. It's the whole point of all the scheme.'
‘Such as…?’
(See the end of the chapter for
Kitchen and living room are the biggest frogs. He starts with the kitchen since it leans on the practical side. Fridge first: everything that seems expired or rotten goes to the rubbish bin. Experiments… he's not so sure about the stage of those, but it's been two unsupervised weeks, so they are probably spoiled anyway. Bottles of chemicals are left where they are, body parts starting to get green go to rubbish. The ones in the freezer he leaves untouched, surely they will have some purpose later.
A man wearing a balaclava and Liverpool cap stands behind her, holding a knife to her neck. He nudges her back and she speaks.
He can see the signals quite clearly right now, which annoys him further. Is it possible for someone to actually gaslight themselves?
‘Still not good. Let me do this.’ he clears his throat and turns to David. ‘Well…’
They meet at a pub midway for both of them. Greg is already at a table, sipping a beer and pecking some chips. John gets another round for both of them. 'You'll need the extra beer, trust me.'
ends, or you can make it easier and just show me.'
Not exactly what he expected. 'What?' he turns back, finding Sherlock alone again in the sofa.
'Anything else you want to ask?' he insists.
‘No.’ he sighs. ‘That wouldn’t be fair. He likes her.’
Full lips contort in an unhappy line. 'Honestly? Tired. I've been so tired all the time. If there's something I gave up during all that happened, is trying to over control things. I'm just glad. That you.' he looks so mortified an actual blush paints his cheeks. The nerve of him to look so adorable and uncomfortable at the same time. 'That you are here with me. I didn't think this could happen.'
He closes his eyes for a second before looking up to the ceiling, trying to regain composure. The gunwoman kneels to cut the tie around his ankles, while Jim watches him with a satisfied smirk. At the corner of his eye, he sees the cat still perched on the top of the stall wall. They stare at each other, and John motions his head in Jim's direction as subtle as he can.
'I never… we didn't… Oh my god.' he suddenly realises they never really really
'What?' Sherlock asks with his voice subtly indicating the panic John is feeling.
'That… sounds lovely actually.'
Next time he wakes up, he is audibly literate again. One nurse asks how he feels. He manages to say 'ok', and they look satisfied. He is explained he needs a chest radiograph to look for possible diffuse infiltrates, and he needs to be awake for that. He nods, feeling like his whole body is heavy, but at least in compliance to his orders.
Anna has never been one for storming off or yell during a discussion. This is mostly John's department. He doesn't know if this a true characteristic or just part of her Mary Morstan persona. It doesn't matter, he knows better now. She's been acting as she always had, except John is not blind to her anymore. How he never realised she Is textbook manipulative is beyond him.
She writes for a moment on her form. 'Are you engaging in the preparation activities?'
Sherlock looks a bit uneasy himself. 'I have no idea what to say, to be honest. Perhaps you could go back to your therapist?' he suggests tentatively.
Another cliffhanger. Gosh.
'Cambridge.' he answers. 'He was volunteering in a dog adoption event, when one of the dogs escaped and bit me. He came to rescue it and offered to help me. I wasn't much sociable but he was very kind and kept talking to me after that. He asked me on a date few months after.'
'So, does she prefer throwing the rattle or the giraffe?' he asks, taking a sip of the coffee he just prepared.
'Yeah.' he then thinks about the strain he's been putting on himself, and how her advice could be more generally applied. 'Yes, you are right.'

'John, I don't want to press you, but your hour is almost up. Surely we can talk about this another day, but I'd like to understand what you're feeling.'

Heating might be a problem, though. Half of the energy will go to heating, and I can’t afford it. I guess I can be my own stove, though - I’ll just wear layers and turn the heating off. The rovers have insulation too, so I think I’ll be alright. I need all the power I can get.

He still felt unsure about Sherlock, worried about reading him the wrong way. But now being together was easy again. Effortless. They had fun together, both during cases and in between. He thought about losing Sherlock again, and still not having said all the things he had kept to himself for so long. Maybe it was worth the risk.

“God, yes,” John groaned, maneuvering himself so that Sherlock had a bit more room to move his hands.
This statement concerns the Ares III mission, part of the Ares Program, which was intended to be a month-long mission to further examine the biological, atmospheric and geological history of Mars in an effort to learn what is was that depleted the planet’s atmosphere and depleted its oceans.
I know that you have decided not to tell the Hermes Crew about John, but I really don’t feel good about it. They have to trust us, they depend on us and the information we give them and I feel like we can’t deny them this news.
He walks around the flat with her, stopping by the window to watch the street. Evening is approaching already. Rosie holds the bottle with her tiny hands, eyes closed and throat working on the milk. People outside start to leave work and commute home. Mrs. Hudson is suddenly visible out there, coming from the supermarket judging by the packages on her hands.
when he found out about the agreement last night.
‘He wouldn’t if he knew other people notice him.’ he mumbles miserably.
Sherlock promised him he would think of something. So John let him scheme, and he was only going to listen, even if staying with the child was more of an impulse to do the right thing, and not a careful deliberation of his future.
' he pronounces the word with a tone of distaste. 'And going back to your little house and family. Sherlock is enough of a fool to permit this, but things are… dramatically changed now. And I can't say I approve of this.'
Not betaed, not brit-picked, not first language, and very late.
'Ahn.' John pauses. He hadn't taken really seriously her proposal, and he's not sure is a good idea. But then, it could be a good way to check her over. And Sherlock is a far better actor than himself. 'Ok. I'll invite him. Do you need me to buy something?'

That's exactly what worries him.

'I think it could help. Choosing furniture for the nursery, her little clothes, this kind of silly things make what is only an idea now into a concrete prospect.'
'We can get pizza, and there's a documentary on honour killings at 11pm.' Sherlock proposes as they hang their coats. John's watch reads 10:02pm.
‘Who?’
John finishes his drink and gets up. 'I just want to sleep.'
Next chapter will be posted next Thursday, 21/01/16.
'Murdering people usually makes things messy.' Sherlock responds, putting his cup aside.
'Excellent.' he murmurs distractedly, checking off some bullet points from his spreadsheet. John peeks over, and there's also a rating system for a list of foods for each month until the one year old mark.
'We have to attack from all possible fronts. And you are too close to make a logical judgement.'
She looks at him in confusion, so he mouths

Mrs. Hudson is leaving in her flirty dress when he opens the front door, which makes him raise an eyebrow to her.
I'm thanks-mike-stamford on tumblr.
'Nice.' and adds more to the pot.
jasndfajlnfljndjf *hides behind a rock and screams to the void*
And that was forty minutes ago.
Sherlock grins at him. John grins back, heart fluttering for an instant.
'I know the drill, Holmes.' she replies matter-of-fact. 'Talk to you later.' and closes the door behind her.
'Ahn, that's okay. At least you didn't have to put up with attempted murder.' he tries for a whimsical attitude. Anna smiles dryly and Aadhya sparkles with something he can't put his finger on it.
'Probably tampered. A child is the cherry on top.'
He turns back to the heavy bag, punching it lightly, adjusting his position. His wedding band is safe at home, in a drawer of his bedside table. He would put it back when it came the time. But right now, even feeling tense for weeks, he can't think of dating or anything related. He barely masturbates, and when he does he finds it hard to concentrate. Now he interacts with a hot woman and doesn't even have the impulse to flirt with her.
“Yep, definitely bi,” he mumbled. “Now, I’d love to lay here and keep doing this all evening, but –”
(See the end of the chapter for
Eight years later, did these two manage to make it work?
“I’ll take what I can get. You have yourself a deal!”
Until Sherlock’s fully recovered? Did she think this was temporary?
“Shit!” John yelped, quickly shutting the door before any more snow could fall into the foyer.
“It’s not like that. He’s… he’s not like that.” John blushed, avoiding the actual question. He hadn’t even realized his bisexuality was that obvious. He didn’t exactly hide it – and he wasn’t ashamed of it – but he just always preferred girls. Hell, besides that almost thing with James last year, he had only felt a passive attraction to other guys; but now this thing with Sherlock. Of course whatever he was feeling with Sherlock was like nothing he’d experienced before, guy or girl, so it was a bit hard to compare.
“What? Are you serious? I’d love to!”
“Oh, right… Do you have a boyfriend then? Which is… which is fine, by the way.” God, could he sound any more like the ‘
“I don’t know what I did to catch your attention, let alone keep it. I don’t know what it was I did to earn your love or your loyalty –”
“I know how anatomy works –
“I bet! How long have you two been putting it all together, a month?”
“I wouldn’t dream of it.”
His mummy let out a sad sounding sigh. “We all need friends, Sweetie,” she said, leaning down to give him a kiss on the cheek. “We’ll leave you alone now, but it will be fine, we promise.”
“My hand felt wrong all evening,” John continued, “and I absolutely hated see you without my ring on your finger.”
“Wow, slow down there. It’s just after seven, so you’ve been asleep for about six hours.” Six hours, shit. “And Sherlock is doing just fine, he actually woke up a few hours ago.”
After barely managing to force down bowl of chicken soup and a couple slices of thick bread, Sherlock lay in his bed, wide awake, staring at the ceiling, itching to be out searching the streets. Refusing to let himself think about where John might be, what he might be going through at the moment, Sherlock found his mind wondering back to the previous evening, when he last saw John.
“There,” he said a little while later, as he slipped the thin silver band onto Sherlock’s finger, and Sherlock slipped one onto his, “we are officially engaged for all the world to see. There’s no backing out now.”
his boyfriend, but it wasn’t like it mattered. Why should he care if she thought they were dating?
“Oh, you are a bad, bad man, Sherlock Holmes.”
“Hmmm, yes, I’ve been told before that I’m ‘stealthy’”
Alright, maybe he did. But anyone who spent more than five minutes with Sherlock would feel the same, or at least they should.
Getting desperate, Moriarty tries some different tactics, and Sherlock and John take some important steps.
The sunlight streamed in through the window, and John was luminous. His sleep – and sex – rumpled blond hair shown golden. Sherlock could see the muscles shift under his skin, skin that still showed vestiges of the Middle Eastern sun.  His dark blue eyes blinked open, bright and fresh from a restful sleep. John was gorgeous.
A small smile tugged at Sherlock’s lips and he let slip a quiet giggle as he watched John shiver at memories of Mr. Sedgeway and spitty mouths.
“You had the words ‘Skype with Mum and Harry’ written on your hand the day you tried talking to me again. Plus there were a few brochures for various sobriety programs sticking out of your bag, along with an envelope addressed to a Harry Watson.” Please don’t let this be the thing to drive John away. But he wanted to know, John asked to be told. “I was just assuming you don’t refer to your father by his first name, so Harry must be a brother. Older, because well, his drinking is serious enough that you’ve looked into programs, and you’re only twenty years old.”
“Yes, that’s what Heather said too,” Sherlock hummed. “According to her, the water will alleviate the amount of weight and strain on my leg when doing the exercises.”
“Friends? Really?” The man raised a questioning eyebrow, the smug son of a bitch. “Because as far as I can tell, you went from simply being a classroom assistant –”
“Interested in Sherlock? Why? You’re clearly not friends.” Sherlock wouldn’t throw his lot in with someone as creepy and underhanded as this guy.
“I don’t know,” Sherlock shrugged. “It’s just another day, it doesn’t really matter.”
“A compromise, then.” Sherlock said, a wicked grin once again spreading across his face. “We spend the night pressed together in my bed. It’s larger, softer, and has far better support than this couch.” Absolutely shameless.
into it.” The Jailers fist connected with his mouth, and John could feel his lip split as it hit against his teeth.
– fucking gorgeous.” John’s breath was hot against his lips as frantic kisses turned in to panting moans. “Sher –
“John! John, I thought that was you.” Came a familiar voice, and John turned just in time to see Lestrade jog up to him. Thank God, a familiar face. Lestrade looked haggard, and any other time John would have been the first to check how he was doing, but at the moment…
“I know, I know. You and Sherlock ‘aren’t a couple.’ Hate to break it to you, mate, but you’ve been in a relationship for over a year now, and a pretty serious one at that. Just make it official.” Greg says, receiving only a glare from John. “Alright, fine, I’ll shut up. But seriously, what’s got you in such a good mood?”
*******
“Who are you? What do you want?” John demanded, trying to get another glimpse of his guard, and thinking back the other door he saw, asked, “Is there anybody else here?” But John’s questions were met with silence.
“As long as you’re happy, I guess.”
“Let’s just hope I’m not too rusty.” John chuckled. “It has been a while.”
His body still singing from John’s touch, Sherlock, entangled around John, tumbled completely naked and still wet from their shower, onto the bed. Hands roamed, hips rocked, and mouths licked and kissed away the water still dotting their skin. John was right, he did taste better after the shower – not that he didn’t taste amazing before. If it weren’t for John’s mouth on him just ten minutes earlier, there would have been no way he could have lasted a single second of John’s shower slicked skin sliding against his as they rolled around on the plush bedding. Even so, he felt the familiar tension building in his lower abdomen – a tension that only John could inspire – and he felt himself start to stiffen once again.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well
“Hmmm?” John hummed, lifting up on his toes to run the tip of his nose along one of Sherlock’s sharp cheekbones, their lips mere millimeters apart.
“No. No you can’t leave. There’s a war going on, don’t you know that?” Sherlock starts pacing back and forth, not even looking at John. “What would even possess you to join?”
“Clean towels are on the bottom shelf.”
“Okay.” His mother looked as if her heart was breaking for him. In truth, he thought it was, just one more ache to add to his ever heavying heart. “But we are going to pick up something for you to eat, no arguments.”
“Hmm…” Sherlock nodded, furrowing his brow as if in deep contemplation; number fourteen on John’s list of favorite Sherlock looks. “I think I’m going to have to disagree with you there”
John runs into some familiar faces, some more welcoming than others. He also comes to some decisions.
The series of events that followed, occurred so fast, Sherlock didn’t even have time to properly process them. Seb’s legs gave out – thanks to John bringing down a sharp blow to Seb’s shin – the gun fired, Seb collapsed on the ground, unconscious, and John stumbled backwards, letting out an almost inaudible cry.
It was quiet for several long moments. Sherlock tried to refocus on the article before him, but he was all too aware of John’s presence next to him. He could feel the heat radiating off of John’s body, soaking into his skin. He could feel John’s shoulder just barely touching his, John’s naked thigh next to his. It was… distracting. Not unwanted, but still distracting.
There were questions, endless questions, but Sherlock heard none of them. He just nodded along, making the occasional noise as the A&E nurses and doctors answered Mrs. Holmes’ litany of questions. Sherlock’s ribs were bruised but not fractured; the cuts and abrasions, while extensive, would heal easily with no lasting damage. They did insist on keeping Sherlock overnight for monitoring, and hooked him up to IV fluids to combat electrolyte imbalances and malnutrition that was far worse than a week and a half in captivity should cause.
“Well… He’s never said anything about it, but I think Sherlock knows about them.” How could he not, his bedroom is directly below John’s, surely he’d hear the tossing and turning, and more embarrassingly, the whimpering.
“Again, not true.” Sherlock protested. “I spoke to Mike’s girlfriend at length. And I promised that Alec guy I would pass on his regards and phone number to Molly. You can account for him being trustworthy, correct?”
“Hormones, the thought of sharing…
Alright, maybe John couldn’t do it.
Shaking those last thoughts from his head, John steps right up to the police tape, hoping Sherlock will spot him soon. If he’s being honest, he feels a bit awkward just standing there, a bit like a rubbernecker. Finally Sherlock turns, eyes making contact with John’s. If John didn't know better, he could have sworn Sherlock actually brightened.
“Exactly, John! It’s been an entire month! I should be back by now. I should be healed, I should be able to walk without a damn crutch. I should be better! But just look at me!”
A stranger manhandling and manipulating his broken leg, this should be fun. At least John was getting a bit of a laugh behind his paper.
“I’m in no hurry. I’ll stick with the bus, thanks.” There was no way he could take the driver – bodyguard, hit man, hired muscle – one on one, but perhaps he could outrun him.
Sherlock’s head popped out of changing cubicle, the curtain held tightly shut blow his neck. “It was a stupid idea, I shouldn’t have agreed in the first place. I’m not doing it.”
John was thrilled when Greg tackled him before practice earlier in the week, practically yelling that he was on his way to becoming a detective. But right now, John was regretting his earlier enthusiasm when Molly told him about the party. Five more minutes, five more minutes in the cold, and John is calling it quits. Four minutes and twenty seven seconds later, John walks through Molly’s door.
“Well obviously they’re boring,” Sherlock sighed, relaxing a bit because John really did want to be with him, “but you do go in for some really boring things, so I didn’t know.”
“I’ve known him for five years now and no, I don’t.” Lestrade sighed. “Don’t get me wrong, I like Sherlock, I consider him a friend… It’s just… Well, I guess what I’m trying to say is, I’m glad Sherlock’s found a flatmate he’s comfortable with, someone who partially understands and isn’t turned off by who he is. It’s good for him, Sherlock Holmes is a great man, and now I think there’s a chance he’s on his way to being a good one as well.”
Heads up, more interrogation typical violence in this chapter. Again, nothing graphic. I still hate myself.
“Of course you don’t have to stay, we’re not holding you hostage.” John hears Greg’s droll voice say.
“What do you mean by most of the damage?” He said in a horse voice, once he’d full processed everything that was said.
“The screen lights up, it caught my eye. You know what, I don’t know why I’m even explaining myself. I did nothing wrong.” Sherlock scowled.
“Everywhere is, as long as you know where to look.”
“Well in that case, thank you for your service.” Sherlock’s voice was husky, coming from somewhere around L3.
Sherlock just stared at him blankly. Yeah, definitely not a reference, John thought as he carefully lifted Sherlock’s gift from the padding, and hid it behind his back.
“So I’ve been trying to figure out what you do.” John called from 221B’s kitchen as he washed his hands.
'I want to do something. Can I?'
this is the way he's going to die, and John will have to see his bloody body again when a loud crack startles him. Anna slumps on him, blocking his view, and then she is pushed away by no one else than Mrs. Hudson.
WARNING: there is anxiety involved here, in case it upsets anyone.
John cringes internally, trying not to show anything on his face. "Please don't make it more difficult." he thinks.
'Ahn,' he says eloquently. 'ok?'
Keona gives him her flat's keys. Sherlock knows the man goes home at 6:30 pm and always comes back to stalk the house for a few hours at 10pm. He waits for him during the time up on the roof, setting up cameras all over the house.
It says tons that Sherlock just nods faintly and complies. John feels impossibly fond of him, waiting outside until he hears the water coming to a halt. He enters the loo and lets the door open so the steam escapes. Sherlock is sitting on the closed lid of the toilet, wearing a towel only, and looking more awake but still tired. John gets his kit and goes to inspect him.
'It's a terrible idea to give your location to random strangers who could for all you know stalk you and murder you.'
John goes to the sofa and sits heavily beside Sherlock, eating three biscuits before speaking.
'But you said she wasn't pregnant.'

honest with you,' he repeats her statement, 'neither did I.'
'She can't just leave. You're bluffing. She has a baby daughter here, and the pathetic husband.' Brent scoffs at him.
He goes to the bathroom. While removing his clothes he fishes his phone out of his pocket. He stares at it for a moment and decides to turn it off. He doesn't want the real world. He had been waiting for the mess to finish, but certainly not like this. He remembers coming back to the flat when Sherlock was at the hospital, questioning himself if he really wanted a child.
'Mary tried to kill Sherlock yesterday, she was also the one who shot him months ago, her name is in fact Anna-Greta, she wasn't really pregnant and she's going to a prison in Hungary right now.'
The blonde - Robin - was watching him with a strict look. 'We need to get into the helicopter.'
'Ok then.' he sighs, watches Sherlock face while feeling warm all over his body, inside and outside. 'Good night.'
'What? When?'

'So, Mary.' Sherlock starts diplomatically, holding his hands behind his back and nudging John to move with his shoulder. He decides to make tea. 'What brings you here?'
He snorts, and envelops her shoulders to smack a kiss on her cheek with a loud "muah!".
' George's voice is muffled by the stone floor, and he still manages to sound pissed.
Mycroft sighs and pinches his nose. 'I can't deny that Sherlock's work is highly regarded by my colleagues. He would be permanently on the payroll if only he agreed to it, which would be a much better use of his abilities.'
And then his body is… doing something. Acting generally weird. He opens the wardrobe door to look at the full-length mirror at the inside of the door. A shiver runs through his whole frame, and an involuntary hum grows at the back of his throat, like an engine. His shoulders hunch painfully all of a sudden, and he falls to his knees. But his weight is quite light, so it doesn't make the thump he expected. In fact, he feels lighter and lighter and lighter.
'Watch me.' he says, already pushing the door open.
What she hadn't been expecting was to hear the soft voice whisper her birth name
I want to thank SO MUCH everyone who subscribed, left kudos, who bookmarked, and specially the few ones who took their time to leave a comment. You're amazing!
Sherlock looked very dangerous and much like his old self. 'Oh, I have an idea for that. Don't worry'.
I thought living didn't matter anymore
