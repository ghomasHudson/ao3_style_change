Natasha rolled her eyes, pinching Clint in the bicep. “I’m sure you two have it handled,” she told Steve and Tony. She looked to Tony. “Don’t let him mess it up,” she said very seriously, eyes flicking to Steve.
“It’s okay if you are,” Rhodey told him, squeezing Tony’s shoulder reassuringly. “I know you have a complicated history with Rogers considering your jerk of a dad, but it’s okay to move on from that. I’m just hurt you didn’t tell me that you moved on Pepper. It’s good that you did, you know?”
if you can believe that. Likes complaining about how all the houses look alike and so they should just pick one.”
The door slid shut behind them once they were inside the room. Tony almost wished it made a sound to accommodate the pervasive feeling of dread that had settled in his stomach.
to get his hands on some of their technology and maybe also see what their ship looked like on the outside, but priorities were priorities and right now Tony was trying to figure out what to do with their current dilemma.
Once upon a time, Tony Stark had hated Steve Rogers’s guts. Once upon a time, Tony had been raised on stories of Captain America’s exploits and his beautiful, virtuous nature and how he could never live up to such a gorgeous ideal of manly perfection. Once upon a time, Tony had been the biggest Captain America fanboy, down to stuffed bears, somewhat iffy posters, and Halloween costumes.
The others were trickling in as Tony joined Steve outside. Clint looked the sleepiest, with pink marks on his face from his pillow, bed hair, and eyes still half-shut. Bruce probably hadn’t even slept (not that Tony could judge as he hadn’t slept either).
(Never mind that falling for your best friend was easily one of the most common romantic tropes in literature.)
“Yeah…” Tony kept looking at the panel he had removed so he wouldn’t have to look back at K’salk’adi (there wasn’t much to see on the panel). “It’s the same on Earth between countries.”
“Because it’s a nice, shiny gun? Besides, it’s what separates me from you. I don’t want people calling me Iron Man because the gun’s gone.”
“I’m…” Steve exhaled, shaking his head. “I’m not excited about everyone thinking we’re in a relationship. It’s…it seems a little cruel, like there’s a certain intimacy level that friends aren’t allowed to have. When I grew up…” He shrugged. “It was different. We wouldn’t have looked twice at two guys like us.”
Tony nodded again, giving a lopsided smile and ignoring how his heart wrenched in his chest. “Rhodey does, anyway. Not sure about the rest of the team.”
“Good talk, buddy,” Barton said to his back. “Say hi to the love child of Captain America and Iron Man for me!”
“Indubitably, sir,” JARVIS said, sounding slightly sympathetic. “If I may…perhaps things are not as hopeless as they seem?”
As Steve’s hand dropped, Tony had the wild impulse to grab it in his own. He stepped back before he could act on it, jabbing a thumb back. “I’m – uh – going to head back to the workshop,” he managed, eyes skittering away from Steve before he could do something to incriminate himself. “Going to make sure I’m good to go regardless of what the little green men want.”
By the time Steve came out of the bathroom, Tony had composed himself. (Mostly composed himself. Steve still looked at him strangely.)
“My memory’s failing,” Tony said, “what with not being able to remember your first Christmas with us.”
In the back of his mind, where Rhodey wasn’t stunned and trying to figure out how this had happened, he thought it looked kind of cute. Even domestic.
“I had a question,” Rhodey said when Barton said nothing more. He sat down on the couch, a cushion’s space between them. “It’s about Tony and Rogers.”
“Keep apologizing like that and I’m going to start thinking you don’t like me,” Tony said teasingly.
“Yes, we are…” Tony glanced at Steve, smile coming naturally when he saw Steve’s trusting face. “We’re the paired leaders for Earth,” he continued easily. This was going to bite them in the ass later when the
“Thor informed us of your abilities with technology,” K’salk’adi had said. “I assume you would be interested?”
“So you’re…calling me…” Tony trailed off, lips twitching. “Okay, I’ll…go and tell Steve. You…er…” He raised a hand to his mouth, coughing as he tried to hide a snicker. He didn’t think it worked from Fury’s unimpressed expression. “You man the forts like a good pirate?”
Tony had seen Steve drink it, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t ask. Especially if Steve was under the impression that Tony didn’t remember his first Christmas party (which was
Funnily enough…Tony liked this team. Liked this team enough to build them all rooms in this tower. Liked them enough to throw himself wholeheartedly into this whole team thing. And that was something Rhodey could never have predicted.
last time. And the one that you gave me as a present but we’ve never been able to watch it because we’ve been too busy.”
know that reference?” Rhodey asked Tony, eyes flicking between the two and the easy camaraderie they shared.
Tony didn’t have time to ask how K’salk’adi knew they were here as A’gel’fush and Steve walked in. Steve looked rather odd, like he’d been hit upside the head with his own shield, but he didn’t seem physically harmed.
Rhodey covered his mouth with his coffee, refusing to give in. After a long drink that gave him the time to compose himself, he set his cup down, taking a seat across from Tony. “So…” He reached over to steal a piece of bacon from Tony’s plate, avoiding the fork that was jabbed in his direction. “What’s up with you and Rogers?”
“Oh.” Steve let out a sigh, sinking back down and snuggling into Tony’s side. He slung an arm over Tony’s waist, pressing his lips to Tony’s shoulder. “You do pretty well, I think,” he said, cheek pressed against Tony’s shoulder.
Tony had seen Steve cry a grand total of once and that was when he was talking about Peggy and Bucky in the middle of the night. It hadn’t even been crying because it had been a few manly tears and then a solemn promise that he was absolutely “fine” and Tony should definitely go to bed now because he’d been up for forty-eight hours with only cat naps.
“You’ve got the suit, I’ve got the serum.” Steve stepped forward, touching the back of Tony’s neck. He regretted not taking his gloves off when he’d had the chance. “And most of your circuits seem to be fried.”
Then, before Steve could reconsider, Tony grabbed the back of Steve’s head and mashed their lips together.
The last stop on the tour was the engine room, which was more Tony’s element than the squishy sciences. He’d geeked out over the area of the control room K’salk’adi had shown him but
Sure, Rhodey had shared a bed with Tony a few times, but that had been back in MIT. He loved Tony, but Tony was not the best bed buddy. He got clingy.
Exhaling slowly, Rhodey noted with relief that the floor was free of any incriminating and embarrassing debris. There did appear to be a knife or two stuck in the ceiling, but that could be excused.
“You weren’t exactly quiet, sweetheart,” Tony said, smiling widely. “I especially liked the part where you were telling yourself to ‘buck up, buckaroo’ and swearing in Italian.”
“I’m not leaving, all right?” Steve was still hugging him, his breath warm against Tony’s skin and setting his nerves afire. “If you need anything…I’ll be here.”
“The Malnussians are a very particular race,” Thor said. “They value paired leaders, preferably those who are lifelong companions.” A sorrowful expression crossed over his face. “At one point I could have done so with Loki but…” He shook his head, face clearing. “I know of no one else that I would trust with his mission.”
There was an encouraging nod from Thor’s direction. There didn’t seem to be a reaction from Natasha, who hovered in the background (like a spy).
One year it had somehow lost all its needles. No one had fessed up to it, but Doreen had looked rather shiftily innocent in the aftermath.
There were better options than Tony Stark. Sure, Tony was technically speaking a catch seeing as how he was rich, good looking, and smart. But he was also neurotic, definitely an asshole, a playboy, too smart for his own good, and
Tony’s smile twitched at the reminder. He closed his eyes, seeing that enormous army laid out above the portal, and exhaled. Steve’s hand came to rest at the small of his back, reassuring and warm.
“I recall when A’gel’fush and I met,” K’salk’adi continued, the wistful words at odds with the translator’s monotone. “It was at a social gathering; our eyes met across the room. It could have simply been a chance meeting, but I accidentally dirtied his clothes. The rest came so easily.”
Tony narrowed his eyes, clearly suspicious. “Something about me and Steve?” he said slowly. “He likes
Steve’s answering smile was warm and affectionate and sent Tony’s stomach wiggling again (it didn’t stop when he told it to). “I’m glad, Shellhead.” His eyes darted up briefly before returning to Tony.
In any case, it was nice to be here without wearing the suit. He could actually eat something that wasn’t liquid and designed to be ingested through a straw.
Stiff as a board, Tony hoped that Steve didn’t notice that he wasn’t sleeping – that Tony was wide awake and desperately trying not to roll over and touch Steve.
Steve’s smile was gentle. “I, uh…overheard you in the engine room. What you said. About our relationship.”
Tony made the executive decision to shut up, taking solace in his drink and resolutely staring anywhere but at Steve.
“Steve?” Tony blinked, glancing over at Rogers, who had a bulging cheek where he was sucking on the candy Tony had tossed him. …That drew up a mental image Rhodey 100% did not need, thanks very much. “I’m…not sure.”
“I, uh…” Steve shifted his weight, folding his arms over his chest. “Left,” he said eventually. “If you…don’t mind.”
“Sounds like the start of a porno,” Clint muttered, just a shade too loudly. Tony glanced over to see if he had his aids in, relieved to see he did. Tony was passable with ASL now but not fluent; Natasha the only one who could translate quickly enough for Clint.
Thor frowned, looking to the others as if seeking confirmation of this. From the head shakes Tony saw out of the corner of his eye, they weren’t backing Tony up on this.
“It’s real,” Steve said. “I’m real and you’re real and this is real. It’s not a dream. I hope you don’t think the last several months were a dream either.”
“I didn’t think about it,” Steve admitted. “What we fell into was so easy…” He shrugged. “I didn’t realize what other people thought of it until you told me what Rhodey said. And then I got to thinking…”
“As if people would think Iron Man would go for the current color scheme you’re sporting.” Tony smirked. “What was it? Iron America? Cap and Iron Man’s love child?”
This time when Tony kissed him, it wasn’t because of mistletoe (even if that sprig was still hanging over their heads). It was because he wanted to. It was because he
“What’s up with me and Steve?” Tony parroted, pulling his plate closer to himself. He put an arm in front of it. As if that would stop Rhodey if he were truly determined.
Steve huffed, arms folded across his chest and eyes narrowed at Tony. “Now you’re just being ridiculous.”
“I’m not sure how this toilet works,” Steve said from the bathroom, “and I’m not sure I want to know. But I think we can use it?”
There must have been something in his tone that alerted Tony, since he stopped what he was doing to look up at him in concern. After a moment, Tony pulled his hands out and dropped the fine tools he had been working with, turning to face Steve fully. “What is it?”
“No,” Tony said defensively, taking a bite of eggs. “Steve does. We’re friends now,” he added more slowly.
“I’ll be right back.” Steve shot Tony a look, fingers digging into Tony’s hip briefly before he let go. “Stay here?”
Tony stared after him as the bathroom sealed shut behind him, never having seen Steve be that clumsy before. Captain America was usually the epitome of grace, especially since Steve had picked up gymnastics and incorporated it into his fighting style. Steve and clumsiness just didn’t go together.
“I told the Malnussians that you were involved,” Thor admitted. “As in…” He lifted his hands, miming an act that if one squinted could probably be sex. “They were most relieved to hear that there would be a pair suitable to speak with them.”
want to date Steve. They were just factors be considered because Steve wasn’t perfect. America liked to paint their golden (red, white, and blue) boy to be without flaws, but Tony had seen Steve squinty-eyed and annoyed in the early morning hours and chewing on his thumbnail when in the middle of a good book and biting his lower lip when sketching and—
It became instantly clear that Steve hadn’t done much kissing before. Which was fine, as Tony had done
No, it had just been Tony and Pepper in the penthouse, but with the nightmares of the empty void and an
“Yeeaahhh…” Rhodey sighed, setting his cup down. “Look, Tones…is there something you want to tell me?”
Now…there were so many, and it was like the large extended family Tony had never known he wanted until he had it.
There was a quick blink that Steve would have missed if he hadn’t been paying attention. Tony didn’t say anything else, tilting his head and spreading his feet to assume the basic stance that Steve had taught him when they first started lessons.
Tony stayed still, registering that Steve’s hands were still on his face, that his lips tingled from where Steve had kissed him (
“I want this,” Steve said, face mere inches from Tony’s. He looked startlingly vulnerable. “I want you.”
“If you do not tell them, I do not think there is anything to fear,” Thor offered, giving the two of them a scrutinizing look. “If you had not told me, I would not have believed otherwise.” He paused, then added, “I still do not believe you. Are you certain you are well? There have been no arguments? Are you in hiding?” He looked concerned now. “I know that your world can be intolerant of those who are different, but you need not hide from us here! We are your shield-brothers; there is no judgment from us.”
Staring at the doorway where Rhodey had left five minutes ago did absolutely nothing to answer any of Tony’s burning questions. And he had them.
“Okay, message received.” Steve reached up and curled his hand around Tony’s eggnog, pulling it away without much protest. He finished the rest of it, thumb stroking gently at Tony’s skin under his shirt.
It was just sharing a bed with Steve, the man he would desperately like to date (and was probably a little bit in love with).
There was no logical conclusion that led from “Tony Stark hated Steve Rogers’s guts” to “Tony Stark was possibly in love with Steve Rogers” that didn’t read like one of those bad rom-coms Natasha secretly loved.
“I’m afraid we can’t promise that others won’t be violent,” Steve said honestly, giving them a genuine smile. “But I can tell you that we will do our very best to make sure that discussions proceed smoothly.”
“Ah.” Tony refocused to see Steve in front of him, holding two glasses. One was eggnog, and the other looked to be apple cider, steam curling through the air. “Which one’s for me?”
There was plate, a pair of utensils, and a glass out to dry on the counter for some reason. There was a perfectly serviceable dishwasher not even a foot away.
He hung up before Fury could say anything else, lowering his head and reevaluating what he knew of Steve to include the label “big, giant troll.”
Uncertain, Tony stalled by taking another sip of his almost empty eggnog. He wasn’t sure why Steve was asking him about Tony Stark’s whereabouts. Especially since Tony Stark had done his best to not get too close to any of the Avengers.
Judging by the exclamation marks he got back, Pepper didn’t seem to mind. It also answered his question as to whether Tony had told her about the relationship.
spy. Ex-Russian? Rhodey wasn’t sure what her nationality was these days, only that she was no longer working for Russia and he had no idea how damn old she was.
“Better neither of us, Shellhead.” Steve pulled his cowl off and leaned in to press a kiss to Tony’s cheek. “That’s what we’ve got the team for. We could’ve figured something out that didn’t involve you being electrocuted.”
The team hadn’t always been so big. Once it had just been Jan, Hank, Thor, Steve, and him. The five founding Avengers.
“I’m down so long as they don’t go for mind control,” Clint said, stretching and rolling to his feet in one limber move that had Tony’s spine aching in sympathy. “But you said possibly hostile, right? So we might not need to fight?”
“Well, I’ll say it again.” Steve took another step towards him, bit his lower lip, and then ducked in to press a soft kiss to Tony’s cheek. “Merry Christmas, Tony.”
“You—” Tony was blinking rapidly, sounding stunned. “Am I dreaming? Did someone stick me in a machine?”
“I guess you’d know, huh?” Barton gave Rhodey an easy grin. “So…you don’t trust Steve either, right?”
“But you are the paired leaders for planet Earth, yes?” This seemed a supremely important piece of information for A’gel’fush, the tip of their antennas becoming slightly pale. It could be agitation, but Tony didn’t know enough of the aliens’ biology to know for sure. The translator’s monotone voice didn’t help, and Tony couldn’t tell if body language was the same between humans and the Malnussians.
straight! Yet that didn’t change anything, did it?) He forced himself to let go before he could do something as foolish as hold Steve’s hand. Even back in Steve’s time, holding hands had been a romantic gesture. “So are you okay with it?”
to say “We need to talk,” largely because the last time he’d accidentally used that phrase Tony had dropped his coffee and also hit Peter with a wrench. Peter had been fine; the coffee had not.
Tony slowly opened his eyes, moving his face enough so he no longer had hair in his mouth. The first thing he saw was that he was not in his room in the tower, which reminded him that he was on a spaceship and sharing a bed with Steve.
Tony dropped his gaze, the back of his neck burning. He pulled in a deep breath, closing his eyes as he imagined Fury in a pink tutu. It killed the gooey feelings quickly enough.
It was loud, but then he hadn’t expected anything else. Parties usually weren’t quiet unless they were the unhappy kind, and this was anything but unhappy. That and the superheroes. Put a lot of superheroes in one place and add good food, music, cookies, and warm drinks and one inevitably ended up with a loud smorgasbord.
“I’m just glad you’re here,” Steve said quietly. His words would have gotten lost in the din of the festivities if Tony’s ears weren’t so finely tuned to the sound of Steve’s voice (he was aware that he was pathetic). “Last year…” He exhaled. “You scared me.”
A glance up confirmed this, although Tony was relatively sure there had been no mistletoe there when he’d first started standing here. He suspected meddling, but it didn’t bother him. He tilted his head, smiling at Steve. “You gonna kiss me properly, then, Winghead?”
‘There you go,’ Tony smiled as the blond moved quietly in his arms. He let him twirl on his feet before holding him even closer, his forehead resting against the dolls.
‘You think she’s telling the truth?’ Tony asked as he and Steve looked out the office window and watched Pepper enter the passenger side of her car, the door being held open by who they assumed was Bucky Barnes.
Stane?’ Tony wanted to ask a thousand questions, though he first had to guide the bot back onto his bed as its legs nearly gave. ‘Steve, what do you mean? How is it you know Obie? He send you as a present, you can’t-’
‘Well, my old man mostly left me jazz and big band style records, so…’ He searched through numerous songs, eventually pulling out an old jazz LP. ‘Can you dance?’ he asked with a smirk as played it, the soothing notes of a saxophone setting the tune.
It didn’t take long for Tony to be pushed over that edge, filling the doll with his cum. He would have felt ashamed at how quick he came had Steve been human.
At that moment, the five Avengers ate their candy, a bright red light illuminating the house, blinding the heroes for a second.
‘Because you threatened to kill him?’ Tony asked smugly, raising his brows. He looked at the man’s strong build. Thor was tall and months of working as a carpenter had clearly strengthened the blond’s body. ‘Killian might have been a powerful man on paper, but he was weak compared to you.’
‘Were you and Mister Killian close?’ Steve asked as the two detectives were now in the next interrogation room.
The man was standing behind a working bench, working on an old oak chair. He looked up with bright blue eyes, his blond hair wrapped in a short ponytail. ‘Thor, Odinson,’ he commented curtly.
‘You better get comfortable down there, kid.’ A cold smile formed on Obadiah’s face as Peter looked up at him in a panic. ‘Might be a while before you’ll get out again.’
‘Mister Killian, Miss Potts has asked for your attendance later today. She would like for you to look into some financial documentations,’ Wanda tried again, but in vain. She placed her hand against the door, opening it gently. ‘Sir?’
‘Y-yes master,’ Steve panted, perfectly following the playboy’s orders of telling him how much he wanted him. ‘Please give me more. Kiss me. F-fuck me. Please!’
He would give Tony instructions to stay still and quiet while he got things prepared. This was a test, and Tony was smart enough to realize it. But Steve still expected some push back. After all, it wouldn’t be Tony if he wasn’t pushing boundaries and buttons.
“Fine by me,” Tony said, already too distracted by mentally planning out his first message to care what they ate.
Tony opened his mouth to speak, then paused, looked like he was concentrating on unspoken words again, and grimaced slightly. His eyes darted to Steve’s once again, and Steve could see a similar blush creeping onto Tony’s face as well. When Tony finally spoke, his voice had gone hard and cruel, and it caught Steve off guard. “I’m just embarrassed to be seen in public with someone wearing
But you’d hand me a cup, and I was always grateful, because it meant I didn’t have to mess with that stupid machine that would get clogged half the time. You stopped me from ripping apart the coffee machine more than once to rebuild it. And that was probably for the best. I absolutely would have overloaded it with special settings.
Steve, apparently satisfied with Tony’s lack of reaction picked up the book, flipping to the next clean page, and plopped down into the chair.
Steve continued, “I’m just worried about him. He seemed so out of it. When was the last time he slept? What do you guys think?”
And he really was run-down after all the excitement today. Sleep would him good, he had to remind himself. No use in working himself ragged when he could approach the project with fresh eyes tomorrow. This was progress, he realized. A year ago nothing could have dragged him away from his work. Now he was willingingly following Steve, and it felt right.
Tony blinked, unsure of what to do next, so he reached out a tentative hand to cup Steve’s face, hoping he could communicate some level of reassurance that he felt the same way.
The playboy smirked, hearing Steve nearly growl in frustration as he placed his foot back on the floor. He stared straight into mesmerizing, bright-blue eyes, tainted with want. A challenging smirk formed on Tony’s face and mischief gleamed in his eyes. ‘Oops,’ he let out in a virtuous whisper as he leaned forward, his breath hot against the blond’s ear. ‘What’s wrong, officer?’ His attitude changed, lust replacing innocence, a smooth and dark voice vibrating against Steve’s skin, ‘I thought you were going to properly punish me.’ He bit down in the blond’s helix, softly moving the skin between his teeth which rewarded him with lewd moan coming from his partner.
‘Drugs, mostly, I think…’ his shoulders slumped. ‘I have seen many, many people come here. All taken upstairs at some point. Most of them don’t- they don’t return. And the ones that do, well…’
‘Wait a minute,’ Thor suddenly interrupted, his voice dark, ‘you mean to tell me that you have no knowledge on my little brother’s whereabouts?’
Thor held out his arms, ready to take his baby brother from the woman’s hands, but she walked straight past him without even looking, causing Tony to snort loudly at the god’s flabbergasted expression.
‘Well, he made sure to install the new serum into your suit… but I created the fluid… and Steve made your lunchbox for school today, so hey! We all pitched in.’ Bruce and Peter laughed.
‘I think so, yes,’ Loki nodded slowly. He opened his mouth, ready to ask the teen another question, but the sound of clashing metal and gunshots distracted him from his thoughts.
‘Who dares to pass through these great gardens of Midgard?’ Peter stated in a heavy voice. He held his hands in front of him, as if he was holding reins, his legs slightly parted as if he was sitting on a horse.
‘Good,’ Tony clasped his hands together, trying to shrug this haunting feeling of guilt. ‘Jarvis will tell you what to do when you’re done, so, no worries there.’ He quickly turned around and closed the door as the bathroom was slowly filling with steam, only later realizing that the doll had no idea who or what Jarvis was.
Tony nodded, ‘Rest mode it is. Also, call me Tony. The whole “master” thing? It’s not really my style. Not outside the bedroom, anyway.’
‘Want me to help?’ Peter offered, already looking over the captain’s shoulder, ‘So, you’re white, huh? Yikes, doesn’t look to good for you.’ He said as he noticed that most white pieces were already carefully lined up next to the board. ‘Who are you playing against, anyway? Mister Banner?’
Steve sighed, nervously biting his bottom lip. He didn’t want to be examined again. Didn’t want to lose these few pleasant memories he had with his new master. What if he would not recognize him when he woke up? What if he wouldn’t recognize anything? What if his master will forget about him and he will never reboot and he-
Now Steve was kicking himself for not taking more of an interest. When he first met Tony he hadn’t cared much for him. And then, over time he learned more about the man under the suit. He caught glimpses of what Tony’s childhood had been like. The absent billionaire father and his mother who was trying her best to keep the family together. Tony had basically been raised by his butler. It was no surprise he’d named JARVIS after the only person who’d really looked out for him.
Tony glanced at Steve, who had smears of the stuff on his face and drying into his Cap suit. Steve shook his head and said, “Probably not, Tones, I think these clothes are going to have to be trashed. I’m honestly trying to figure out how we’re gonna get this out of our hair.”
Steve grabbed the half-empty jug from the middle shelf in the fridge and poured it into a tall glass. He wasn’t quite ready for a meal this early, so juice would have to suffice. Gathering up the cup and the newspaper that had been delivered, Steve made his way to the living room, planning to catch up on local events and see how the Dodgers’ season was going so far.
He leaned into the embrace, hands winding around Steve’s neck, gently coming to rest in the hair at the nape of his neck. He smelled like lemons and sunshine. And he tasted even better. His lips were warm and wet and supple. Tony knew his own lips were probably a little chapped, but he pushed the thought out of his mind and focused on how goddamn good everything felt in this moment.
Tony’s sobbing had quieted, and though his breaths were still ragged, he seemed to be coming down from the panic attack he’d been having. He slowly turned to look up at Steve’s face, his brown eyes watery and wide. He hiccuped and took another deep breath, all the while Steve kept his palm firmly on Tony’s back, rubbing little circles.
Steve leaned into Tony’s touch as they debated where to go for their first date, version 2.0. ‘Not such a disaster after all,’ he thought to himself.
Steve could feel the heat in his face intensify, but for a different reason this time. He had put a lot of thought into dressing nicely for the date, even though he didn’t think it would go anywhere. Sure, his clothes weren’t as fancy or expensive as Tony’s, but he liked them, and he felt good in them. With one sentence Tony had managed to make him feel ashamed and angry. Who was he judge anyway?
He finally glanced at the alarm clock on his bedside table. 11:37 pm. He’d been reading for 11 hours. Had anyone even noticed he was missing?
And just maybe he’d think of Tony as he stroked himself, groaning into the sensation of tight pressure building in the base of his gorgeous, huge cock. He’d chase after that feeling, letting himself get just up against the point of release, but then back down, slowing the tempo of his strokes, lightening the pressure of his hand. Steve was such a fucking smart-ass when he wanted to be, and it wouldn’t surprise Tony at all if he loved to make a game of it, to toy with himself and challenge himself to see how long he could last through the delicious agony of it all.
Steve wouldn’t have normally picked this guy for a date, all show and no substance, he assumed. But there was something charming about the way Tony grinned sheepishly as he took off his sunglasses and sat in the chair opposite Steve. It was somehow cocky and shy in the same look, and Steve found himself suddenly a little more interested in the date. It also didn’t hurt that this Tony guy was incredibly hot, with his slim muscles and deep brown eyes.
Tony grasped onto his warm, large hand, noting how soft it was, and the title of his book, ‘The Private Lives of The Impressionists.’
Steve’s hand was covered, the milky white fluid cooling. He pressed his hand into Tony’s mouth, letting him taste. Tony, who was dazed and blissful, licked his fingers clean with a happy sigh. He settled into Steve’s hold, letting Steve rock him gently as he petted Tony’s hair.
“Monday/Wednesday Nurse Eileen makes better coffee, but Tuesday/Thursday Nurse Mark is more thorough about warm-ups and cool-downs for physical therapy, so I’m a fan.” He held out his hand to Tony, closing his book as he did so. “Steve, Steve Rogers.”
‘Steve…?’ Peter called as he walked into the dark building, holding out his gauntlet to light the way. ‘Come on honey, I know you’re…’ He took a deep breath, ‘I know you’re here, dad.’
First of all, thank you so so much for all your awesome comments! You guys have no idea how many times my family/friends/coworkers have raised a questioning brow at me while I stare at my phone, smiling like an idiot XD
‘No, it’s not.’ Wanda continued, quickly wiping the tears from her cheeks. ‘Miss Potts, the landowner, she invited him to stay. He came here a lot.’
Steve took a deep breath, averting his eyes for a second. How he wanted to tell the kid that everything would be okay. How he wanted to tell him it was all a big mistake and that they would be just fine.
‘I knew that there could only be one person who could have done this to my brother,’ Thor looked up, tears escaping his eyes. ‘I went to Killian and barged into his room. He was just… just sitting there, watching tv. Drunk.’
‘Ah, yeah, that explains everything.’ Scott chuckled. ‘No, you see, I can communicate with ants, you know, control them. Plus, I can turn into the size of an ant as well… or a giant. Wait, hold up your hand, kid,’ Scott waited for Loki to do as he said. He put on his helmet and shrank himself, making sure to stand in the palm of the trickster’s small hand.
‘This might be none of my concern,’ Thor started as he stared at the two. ‘But if it is so much to your disliking, why choose these costumes?’
‘She is,’ Wanda took a step back, inventing the two to come inside. ‘Are you here to tell us that it was murder?’
‘Oh no!’ Loki suddenly shouted dramatically as he let himself fall on his back, causing both Peter and Bruce to look at him with wide questioning eyes. ‘You have brought reinforcements! And you have defeated me with the powers of your friendship!’ Loki chuckled as he closed his eyes, ‘and with the lasers shooting from your glasses.’ He quickly added, directing this last sentence to Bruce.
Tony wanted to keep asking questions, yet stopped as the image of the bleeding and naked doll finally forced him to calm down. ‘Shit, Steve, I’m sorry.’ He took a deep breath and quickly wrapped a blanket around the doll’s body. The blond flinched as the playboy got closer, causing Tony’s heart to shatter. ‘Really, Steve. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have yelled at you.’
‘Well, I know you’re crazy but not crazy enough to start entire conversations with yourself, and since I’m the only one here, well,’ Steve shrugged, then got on his hands and knees and placed himself in front of the playboy, looking him in the eye. ‘I just assumed you were talking to me.’
“Has Tony seemed weird to you guys?” Steve had to raise his voice a little to be heard over the sizzling bacon.
“I’m here for my best friend Bucky. We served together. I made it back unscathed, but he wasn’t as lucky. Been coming here ever since we got back to the States,” Steve offered, turning in his seat to better face Tony.
Tony told him about SI, about how he’d rather spend his days developing new technologies than trying to please elderly board members in shareholder meetings. He’d been thinking about offering the CEO job to Pepper anyway, and that was starting to seem more and more appealing.
Then he offered his hand to Tony, the implication clear on his face. He wanted Tony to clean off his hand, to lick him clean of Tony’s own come, and that was perhaps the hottest thing Tony could possibly imagine in this moment.
Tony told him about his current designs for a clean energy source, and just as Steve was in the middle of asking him about when it would go into its testing phase, a rather bizarre expression came over Tony’s face. It was almost as if he was listening to someone Steve couldn’t hear. His eyes went distant, and he glanced nervously at Steve before zoning out again for a moment. Steve didn’t know what had just happened, but maybe Tony was just as nervous as he was, he reasoned.
Steve, to Tony’s utter delight lifted his hand to his mouth, jutted out his tongue to kitten lick at Tony’s come, and hummed happily.
He sat there awkwardly, letting the moment stretch out into unbearable silence. Steve fiddled with the wrapper from his straw, cleared his throat, and glanced at Tony again. The man across the table from him looked tense. There was an almost strained expression on his face, like he was torn between two choices, Steve thought.
If Tony happened to be keenly aware that Steve was probably drawing him right now, Steve didn’t seem to notice, and besides, it’s not like this hadn’t happened every time Steve drew in the workshop. Tony just happened to know what his subject matter was now.
He rubbed an open palm firmly across the spot he’d struck, soothing the sting with a murmured “There, there.” Tony wiggled, adjusting his wrists against the ropes wrapped around them.
“Are you ready for your reward? You’ve been so good for me.” He could feel Tony nod eagerly into his neck.
Despite the viscous fluid no longer belonging to a sentient Symbiote, it had a rather uncanny quality, almost like it was still moving on it’s own. If you looked at in the right light, it seemed to be swirling just slightly, reaching upwards and outwards, not unlike the tendrils that had lashed out from the being it once belonged to. Tony had read theories about alien fluid dynamics. The leading theories posited that some fluids from other parts of the galaxy might behave in very strange, non-earth ways, even when on earth. He’d not had the opportunity to study them yet, but he supposed now was as good a time as any to brush up on xenophysics. Besides, he had a feeling this stuff might be a useful tool if he could synthesize its properties.
He was itching to get back there and ask Helen about Rhodey’s progress, but even Dr. Cho seemed on board with barring Tony from coming back with Rhodey. She’d given him a gentle smile as she had explained that while the hospital was incredibly grateful for his generosity, that part of his friend’s recovery process was letting him do things on his terms. In the most polite way possible, she basically told Tony to fuck off until Rhodey was ready to let him be more of a part of his rehab process.
‘What? No, I,’ Scott raised a brow and he looked at the teen who managed to get back on the couch, hoping for explanation.
Obie would give him a perfectly reasonable explanation and he would make sure the doll would be taken care of properly.
‘I am sorry for your loss, Miss Potts.’ Steve handed the woman a cup of coffee and sat down behind his desk. As the lady remained standing he kindly gestured her towards the seat opposite of him.
Steve made a noise that was a perfect mixture of a growl and a sigh. He crossed his arms, pensively looking up at the ceiling, ‘We’ve got a suspect. He has a motive and confessed to have been in contact with our victim at the time he was murdered.’
‘That happens from time to time,’ Wanda quickly added as she shifted to the edge of her seat. ‘Loki tends to fall asleep when he watches movies. It happened before.’
The billionaire’s heart skipped a beat at the rough, Brooklyn accent. ‘I feel retarded for asking you this, but… You really are, like, a robot, yes? No emotions or whatever?’
‘Wait, what? Marrying T’Challa?’ Tony asked as he stopped, his hands on his hips. ‘Can you imagine?’ he frowned heavily and opened his mouth again. ‘“
‘It’s really fun, Lokes, don’t worry.’ Peter assured him, only now realizing that the god must have no idea what he was talking about. ‘We’ll watch a Disney or something, I’m sure you’ll love it.’
Loki looked at Rhodes for a second and then smiled, ‘No! War Machine never gives!’ He kicked Peter against his arms, surprising the teen at how strong the little Asgardian still was, and quickly climbed on top of the back of the couch.
‘Yes, master.’ He could hear Stane walk away. He wanted to stay silent, for a machine should never question, yet couldn’t resist asking one last question. ‘Master?’
The three men then looked up in surprise as the ground suddenly trembled beneath their feet. A loud, roaring sound like thunder hurling through the air.
‘Okay, wait!’ Bucky growled softly in frustration, the stress bringing out his Russian accent more than ever. ‘Killian, he- at first, he was kind and patient with us. He helped Miss Potts with her company, he even helped around the mansion sometimes. He came more often as time went by, but, about half a year ago, things changed. He started to threaten us behind Miss Potts’ back. Telling us we needed to pack our bags and leave America.’
The first person Loki would speak to was Peter. The teen had spend hours trying to talk to the trickster, telling him day to day stories or funny anecdotes every time he saw him, even though Loki did not seem to care much about them. He brought the raven Earthly snacks to try such as M&M’s, Oreos and Twinkies because, according to the teen, “they are the freaking best”. It was only when Peter’s daily visits had come to stop that Loki actually left his room for anything other than food. Wondering where Peter was, Loki had asked Thor and he told him that the teen had fallen ill after his last mission.
‘War Machine is amazing!’ Loki shouted, suddenly jumping up the couch. ‘War Machine, attack!’ He laughed and tackled Peter, causing the teen to fall of the couch as the sudden assault caught him by surprise.
Tony disappeared into his workshop after his shower, needing something to focus on other than the doll. He soon lost track of time, his entire world now safely confined within these four walls.
Stane hang up before Tony even had a chance to comment. He watched his phone a second longer and listened to the beeping of a dead line before turning to his present again.
The radio was turned off, causing a very uncomfortable silence to fill the car. The two children had never met this man- Stane, before, yet Peter was grateful that someone had finally chosen him after living in the orphanage for as long as he could remember. And even though this was not exactly how he had imagined the car ride to be, he was still very excited.
‘… Of course it did,’ Tony looked the trickster up and down one more time before jumping back to his feet again.
Steve laughed as he saw how the trickster’s hands were still hidden inside the fabric of the now oversized dress shirt. ‘Here, let me get that for you,’ he smiled as he gently rolled up the sleeves.
‘Sure,’ Clint nodded, ‘And don’t worry, I’ll go easy on you, old man.’ The two chuckled as they walked back to the compound together. They then looked up in the sky as they saw Sam with Loki on his back, both wearing the same black and red goggles, both with the same concentrated expression on their faces. ‘Would you look at that,’ the archer scoffed, ‘those guys
Peter crawled in on himself, hair falling in his face as he wrapped his arms around his legs. He was cold, confused and absolutely petrified. Soft sobs filled the room as tears streamed down his face.
The creature tried to stand, it’s claws ripping straight through wall paper as it tried to support itself against the wall.
‘And above all, Loki would be safe,’ Tony grabbed a handful of peanuts from the bowl that was standing in the middle of the table.
‘Our victim was charged with several crimes, most of them were not really all that significant. Fraud, money laundering, etc. however…’
child, not two! If Thor would see them like this, he would surely take him to Asgard and lock him up in some creepy dungeon for torture or whatever Asgardians do with prisoners. Peter flinched as his vivid imagination started to portrait this scenes in his head.
Peter chuckled and pulled the trickster close, hugging him and letting his head rest on his chest. ‘You’re an idiot, Lokes.’ He smiled as he listened to the god’s soothing heartbeat, the raven placing one hand on his back and one in the back of his neck, giving him another precious kiss.
Loki nodded. He jumped from his chair and disappeared into the hallway, old wood creaking slightly as he continued his way up the stairs.
spend the rest of the afternoon in bed? You know, watch some Netflix or something? Just a lazy day.’
‘Miss Potts, were you aware of the fact that Mister Killian still tried to buy your company even after you rejected his offer?’ Steve asked sternly as he sat down across the woman.
‘You know,’ Stane continued as the creators set out their equipment, their black boots squeaking against the stone floor as they readied for surgery. ‘We’ll be able to fix that rotten brain of yours. Turn you into a nice obedient little puppet,’ He grabbed a syringe from the table tray, the needle glistening in the fluorescent lights. ‘But those damn eyes of yours…’
‘I cannot sleep,’ Loki’s shoulders dropped as he stared at the floor. ‘It is that room, it frightens me, and I just thought, well…’ he fiddled with the brim of his Spider-man sweater and took a deep breath. ‘Might I sleep in your bed tonight?’
‘But he was,’ Steve leaned forward, his elbows resting on the small table, hands folded in front of his mouth. ‘Mister Killian threatened your staff, Mister Barnes and Mister Odinson already confirmed this.’
have laughed and made a joke about how his stupid brain couldn't have waited eleven minutes to spring to action, if he didn't wake up because his entire body felt like there were sparklers going off inside him.
"Yeah on the floor." Oh he'd said that out loud. "You slid right down before you made it onto the couch." Steve feels a cool hand on his own cheek and hums. Cool hands really are as nice as Tony makes it sound. The blond leans into it, his eyes slipping closed a bit. He almost fell asleep right there. Almost.
"Tony, please? Just let me take care of you." His plea is followed by another, more persistent yawn. Definitely not helping his case.
"Yeah, yeah. Shut up yourself old man." Tony sends his boyfriend a playful smile, clearly feeling better if he was back to poking at Steve's age. "Thanks for taking care of me, Stevie."
Steve leans over and presses a kiss to Tony's temple, resting his hand on the back of his neck as he did. The last time Tony had been hit with a migraine, he said that this helped him. That it felt nice.
"Tony? Hey, sweetheart you're okay. Come on." Steve grabs the shorter man's hand gently, ignoring his resistance, and places it over his own heart and holds it there. "Okay, you've gotta breathe, breathe with me." He takes a deep breath in and holds it for four seconds before slowly releasing it. Steve watches Tony's stuttering attempts at mimicking him and wraps his free hand around the back of Tony's neck. Inwardly, Steve smiles as Tony grips his shirt, wrapping it into his tight fist.
"Yeah. I'm fine. I'm sorry." He sighs and sits up to look at the other man. "It's just the beginning of a migraine. There's not much I can do about it now. You can go back to bed, I'm gonna keep working." Tony stands up from where they had ended up kneeling in front of his workbench. He rubs at his neck a bit with a grimace before picking the wrench back up.
Steve is dumping all of the used paper towels into the small trash bin when he hears stirring from the couch.
"I'm right here, Tones." He slowly reaches over to Tony and puts a firm hand on the man's shoulder. Steve needs to choose his words carefully now and he knows it. He knows what comes next.
"Damn- I- No. Shit. Not... here. No-no-no." Tony vaguely feels a hand on the back of his neck, vaguely sees his boyfriend's face, mere inches from his own. Steve's lips. Are they moving? Oh. No. Wait-
"Shut up and drink your soup." The blond quips, no real heat to his words. "You're exhausted, remember?"
Sam had told Tony that Steve had barely slept or ate in the time he was missing. Steve was a wreck then, and Tony would never be able to take all that pain away from him. The best he could do was try to fill his boyfriend with as much love and appreciation as he could to the man who takes care of him so well. Tony couldn't blame him though. If their roles were reversed, he couldn’t imagine that he’d do any better.
Steve opens his eyes again and looks at his boyfriend. "No. Stop. I'm okay. This should be the other way. I should be helping you."
It's been about three days since the migraine, and Steve had gotten about that many hours of sleep. Three. Which is why the two men were currently arguing. Really it was a stupid fight. The only reason it was even happening was because Tony's irritability has been through the roof for the last few days.
Steve nods and murmurs, "I figured as much. It's alright, you'll get through it. We'll use the tap system." Steve squeezes the other man's shoulder before helping him  to his feet. "Let's go sit on the couch. I know that's the most comfortable for you when you get these headaches."
though. Letting out a frustrated sigh, he throws down the screwdriver that he had been using. "Damn it."
. That pressure, keeping Tony from spiraling with the rest of what he was seeing. "Stage two?" His voice is quiet, not knowing what symptoms his boyfriend is facing right now.
Steve nods to himself, grateful that the side that was bothering him most was the side that was up. He wouldn't have to jostle Tony too much.
He leans over the couch to check and see if Tony was awake, sighing with relief when the man is still sleeping in the same position. He hums to himself as he starts to clean up around the couch, occasionally glancing at Tony and smiling softly at how calm and peaceful he looks. Times like this when Steve gets to see Tony sleep are the times that Steve loves the most. Tony always has his walls up around the others, so he likes that he's the only one who gets to see Tony this way.
Tony's eyes fall shut and he leans into his boyfriend's hand in an attempt to ground himself. When it doesn't work he shakes his head.
"Oh Tones..." Steve mumbles, grabbing a small trash can from under the kitchen sink. Half walking, half jogging into the room with it. He sits down by his boyfriend's head and grimaces at the pile of puke near the couch. He soothingly rubs Tony's back, only earning an angry groan from his partner. "I know, sweetheart. Let it out. You're okay."
He pauses his working to look up at the ceiling and winces at the shooting pain when he lifts his head too high.
The telltale waves of anxiety and fatigue should have been enough. Adding a suspicious pain in the back of his neck? That should have been the final straw. But anyone who knows Tony Stark knows that there's no way in hell that he's going to stop working until it's done. His latest project is a new modified web shooter for the kid. It's designed to convert water into web fluid, and it's a good idea.  Tony is tired of getting panic calls from Karen that tell him his kid is falling and out of web fluid.
"Do you really wanna know?" The blond nods a bit, so Tony answers. "You." There's a dramatic pause and Steve almost thinks Tony is going to be sweet.
This time, however, he didn't pick up on it until the hand that had been gently holding his wrist suddenly gripped tighter.
"Go to bed, Tones. Sleep it off." When he earned a groan in response to his encouragement, Steve stifles his chuckle so he doesn't disturb his boyfriend. "It'll pass. Just go to sleep."
"Yeah, I'm sure it does. But you're so strong. You're doing great." Steve praises as he watches Tony sit up slowly. Before he can tell the man to lay back down, he feels Tony sagging into his side and knows exactly what to do. Steve  settles himself in a position that he could maintain until this passes. He leans against the arm of the couch and gently, slowly leads his boyfriend to lay on his chest. He turns Tony as he lowers him and has him facing the back of the couch so his head is on Steve's left side, right above his heart.
Steve nods and says, "Okay, Tony. Lay down." He starts guiding the other man to a more comfortable position, laying a pillow under his head as Steve stands up. "That's it. Nice and slow."
Tony nods a bit but quickly closes his eyes, stopping the movement. He holds his hand up in a peace sign—or in this case, a number 'two'— to signify that yes, it is the second phase.
"I will. Just give me a few minutes. I have to get this done." The mechanic frowns and his face hardens as he looks down, going back to the task at hand. He feels a presence behind him a few moments later and his hands tense up.
When they got to the floor, Tony was immediately slumping forward, which helped Steve's goal. "I figured. Head between your knees." Steve helps guide him, knowing that it would help with the dizziness, which in turn would start to lighten whatever vision problems Tony was having.
"Tony, I'm fine." It must have been the fourth time— at least— that he'd said that. Also the fourth time that Tony hasn't believed him.
Steve glanced up at Tony and watched his pupils dilate angrily at the dim lights. Tony winces at the roar of traffic outside and looks to his boyfriend for help.
With a short sigh, Tony lets himself relax in the other man's hold. Steve doesn't miss how Tony sets the tool back on the table. "Thanks Steve." Tony's voice is quiet, but it's clear that the massage is helping.
Steve whispers to FRIDAY as he starts to gently massage Tony's temple with the cool tips of his fingers. "Don't respond FRI, but can you turn the lights completely off?" He smiles slightly when the well-programmed AI follows the two commands.
"I'm kind of... exhausted." He rolls his head to the side to look at Steve and sends him a sheepish smile.
When Steve hears Tony groan again and feels the latter shift in his lap, he lets out a soft sigh and stills the hand that was on the back of his neck. Gently, Steve leans down to whisper in Tony's ear.
Steve nods to himself before scooting towards the edge of the bed, but frowns a little at seeing how shaky Tony was. "Okay, sweetheart, I'm gonna try and help." The blond knew from experiences with Tony in the past that during the aura phase he was almost always dizzy. Guessing that that was the case for today, Steve gently wraps Tony's arm around his neck and helps him slide to the floor.
And it was true. Steve had gone longer, but it was a completely different circumstance; Tony and Nebula were lost in space for an entire month right after the initial snap.  Steve Rogers was the highest form of Avenger then. In that month, Steve surpassed avenging someone he met once. He skipped over avenging a friend. No, none of that. Steve went straight to avenging a lover. Avenging someone he needed in his life almost as much as he needed air.
Steve leans down and places a gentle kiss on the crown of Tony's head while he continues to massage his temple.
Tony felt his knees start to wobble and sat back on the edge of the bed. His actions jostled a slowly waking Steve, who became more alert, when he saw Tony in distress.
Then his boyfriend keeps talking. "Specifically you and me. Last December." The smirk was all Steve needed to confirm what the other man had referenced.
Tony winces as he opens his eyes to look at Steve. He shuts them immediately and frowns, mumbling into Steve's chest. "Left."
He definitely hadn’t meant to say that out loud. Tony kept his mouth firmly shut as he closed his eyes, breathing in and swimming in Steve’s warmth and scent. He was so
“Oh, a joke. Didn’t know you had it in you.” Tony tapped his fingers on the desk, calling up another hologram with information JARVIS was still sneaking from S.H.I.E.L.D.’s servers. “You say ‘possible.’ Have you talked with them yet?”
“But maybe we should tell them something,” Steve continued, scratching the back of his head. “Because…they think we’re dating?”
When he did, it was with a more relaxed posture than before. He sat down in the same spot, picking up his cereal as he did.
It was like that one Swedish goat that always got set on fire every year. The Avengers’ Christmas tree never made it through a party without something happening to it.
“Uh…huh…” Rhodey blinked slowly, considered his possible options, and decided the best decision was to just not say anything. “How long has he been down here?”
“Okay.” Steve sighed, rubbing his forehead. “We’ll let Fury know what’s going on, that we’ll have to be the first line of communication here. Let’s hope they don’t find out that we’re…” He shook his head.
“There are not many planets that have paired leaders,” K’salk’adi continued. “When Thor informed us that your planet did have one such pair, we were greatly relieved that you would understand our way of thinking. Discussions on how to align two different planets always work more smoothly when we have cultural similarities.”
Despite the heavy lurch in his heart, Tony couldn’t help but laugh. “You have a one-track mind, Rogers. Let’s satisfy that bagel craving, hm?”
Tony stared back, keeping his breathing carefully even. “We’re friends,” he answered honestly. “Not sure what else you’re expecting, Clint.”
He wasn’t yet going to hinge his bets on the relationship lasting but…he had a pretty good idea that there may be wedding bells in the future. Not even Pepper had made Tony that comfortable, and Rogers –
“It’s nine in the morning,” Barton muttered, leaning forward to put his almost empty bowl of cereal on the table and getting up. “Sue me for not wanting to put the damn things in this early.”
“I changed my mind,” Tony said quickly. “We were dating, we were definitely dating before. We went on so many dates. You can kiss me.”
“It’s not like I need another suit,” Tony muttered, slathering the last of the peanut butter on his bagel. “Besides, can you see me flying around with a giant gun on my shoulder?”
“Great,” Tony said brightly. “I usually sleep on the right anyway.” Lies. He slept on the left, but he could definitely sleep on the right for now.
Fury shrugged, clearly unashamed. “I’ll get the reports from Barton or Romanov. You two have some snuggling to do if you’re going to cozy up to the Melnassians.”
“I love you,” Steve said. “You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, and I want to hold onto you. I can’t imagine fighting with anyone else by my side. I…hope you understand that.”
Steve still heard him. “I didn’t want to lose what I already had. But then I almost lost it anyway, and I couldn’t stand knowing that you almost
He hadn’t trusted her anyway after figuring out that she’d basically just strung Tony along and then essentially blacklisted Tony by saying only his suit was any good. Tony had acted like an ass that time, but the suit wasn’t Iron Man without the man piloting it. Rhodey had a suit and
“We’re definitely friends,” Tony reassured him. “I just…” Rhodey had been reading too much into it, hadn’t he? “…wanted to make sure we were on the same page.”
Steve gave him a sweet grin, one that he’d given Tony plenty of times before. Only this time it made something in Tony’s chest squeeze painfully tight.
Fury studied them for a moment longer before relaxing, leaning back in his chair. “You couldn’t have come out a week later? I owe Hill twenty.”
Steve made a sound first, exhaling loudly and running a hand through his hair. “I wasn’t ever going to say anything,” he said, turning to face Tony. “I didn’t want to risk anything, you know?” He huffed out a small laugh. “Always was a coward when it came to these things.”
Glancing to the side, Rhodey saw the TV and that it had been switched off. They’d probably fallen asleep watching something – God knows what. Rhodey didn’t even
Tony pressed his fingers together tightly where he had them laced behind his back, sudden, visceral panic making his heart race. “Yeah, we can. You sure everything’s fine? You’re going to give me a complex at this rate.”
As chill as the Malnussians were (not that Tony knew many aliens at all but he could definitely say that these particular aliens were chill), Tony really,
“Indeed!” A’gel’fush agreed. They seemed excited even if the translator kept their voice a dull monotone. “We have heard tales of your Earth. Is it true that you vanquished the Chitauri army with a single blow?”
Their movie night wasn’t interrupted by any villains making an appearance. What happened after the movie was also uninterrupted and Steve found himself in a rather bright mood as he went through his routine the next day.
. He was relieved to find nothing of the sort but rather something with a dark, metallic sheen seemed to resemble nothing more than a hole in the wall.
There was a ringing sound in Tony’s ears as he started the drive back, unable to look over at Steve. He wasn’t sure what he’d find on Steve’s face. He wasn’t sure what Steve would see on
“The pants stretch,” Tony said offhandedly, “but they sure don’t like to shrink down. Be a shame if we saved New York only to be slammed with a public indecency charge.”
Tony could definitely say it wasn’t him, but he knew who probably was at fault. He should give JARVIS an upgrade or some extra server space.
“I should be asking you that,” Steve said, eyes seeming to cover every inch of Tony’s frame (which was a ludicrous thought). “You’ve always been in the suit before.”
Tony pushed Steve back, grinning at him when Steve caught his hands and pulled him in. “Why, Captain…I thought you’d never ask.”
“You know I had him, right?” Tony griped, dropping his helmet off to the side. His hair stuck to his forehead, damp with sweat.
But each Malnussian only did the antenna touching with a very specific Malnussian and it was always in pairs.
The speech was rubbish and not at all what he’d planned, but it was everything he needed to say and everything he hoped Tony heard.
It had gotten him to this point after years of dancing around, and he could be patient a little while longer.
Bruce had hung around for a bit but then withdrawn, ill-equipped to handle the situation but offering his lab for a quiet space. Tony hadn’t wanted Clint or Natasha around, and Thor was a giant puppy but not around enough either.
“Truly?” K’salk’adi seemed perturbed as best as Tony could read their body language. “I would not have thought so.”
Tony closed his eyes, turning his head to press his nose behind Steve’s ear and inhale, Steve’s scent reassuringly familiar. “We are.”
Rolling his eyes, Tony continued, “Apparently we have another group of aliens, possibly hostile. Fury’s not sure as Thor elected to be first contact. He didn’t tell anyone but Jane, so Jane let S.H.I.E.L.D. know, who let me know. My guess is Thor’ll be here soon to let us know what’s going on.”
By the end of his stay, Rhodey was armed with enough ammo to be 100% sure that Tony was in a romantic relationship with Steve Rogers. He was also increasingly hurt that Tony hadn’t
The tower was quiet when he returned, the only lights that of the stylized A on the outside and the few offices where people were working late. Given it was Stark Industries, there were always overzealous people working late in hopes of squeezing out that last bit of brainpower.
Tony shared a look with Steve, reading resignation in the other’s face. They’d had discussions on aliens before, Tony telling Steve what he had seen in the void when he’d carried that nuke through the portal. He’d told Steve there was more out there, that they were vulnerable to attack if they weren’t careful. That they had to be prepared in case the worst happened and another alien invasion occurred that they couldn’t stop.
(Tony wondered how the translator did with such inane phrases like “River River” because there were a lot of rivers named like that if one translated the typically native names alongside “river.”)
Now they were sitting in a bagel shop and Tony was reevaluating all his life choices that had led him to this moment in time where even his closest friend thought that Tony Stark was dating Steve Rogers and didn’t think that was the funniest joke ever.
Tony reached out to touch before he realized what he was doing, stopping dead before his fingers made contact. “Can I touch?” he asked over his shoulder. “Fair warning, I might touch it anyway.”
Which left Thor – who was not in residence as he was visiting the brilliant Dr. Foster – and Barton.
). “I know we made this kind of a tradition for us but even tradition has to skip a year sometimes—”
“I know,” Steve said, meeting Tony’s eyes. “I know you’re real busy, so that you’re still here – that you put this together for us every year – it means a lot.” He paused, hands going to his waist belt; Tony suspected if he had pockets in the uniform he would have used those. “You know,” he started slowly, haltingly, “I was always a little…disappointed that Mr. Stark was never there. Because he would arrange the parties, but then he’d never be there. I wanted to thank him for everything, but he never showed.” His smile was wry. “But Iron Man did.”
‘Well, he is an alien on Earth, just like us, Thor.’ Loki smiled as he drank the last of his juice. ‘I mean, I like that he is blue and, and, he came to Earth to destroy it but all it took was someone who had the patience to show him what a real family is like. And, there was even a group of special people to stop him and punish him, but that makes me really sad… I mean, can you imagine what would have happened if they would have actually taken him to prison? While all he needed was someone to be kind to him?’ Loki then looked at the three adults, noticing how they had all fallen completely silent. ‘Did I say something wrong…?’ he asked in a small voice, his big emerald eyes now directed at Thor.
‘Pirate-Angel,’ Quill greeted back, his voice lower to imitate that of Thor’s. ‘Hey, uhm, question, can your brother come and play outside?’ he added with a scoff, trying to look over Thor’s shoulder to see if he could spot the raven.
‘Don’t know sir, but if you could just sign this form, that would be great.’ He held out a yellowish paper, barely meeting the billionaire’s eyes as he stared from under his cap. He had a sluggish posture, loudly chewing his bubblegum as he just seemed completely done with his job, and his life for that matter.
The man moaned softly, feeling the warmth of Tony’s leg through his boxers. He let his teeth sink into his partner’s neck, roughly, yet still careful enough not to break his skin. He could never really hurt Tony, not even if his partner wanted him to. He wanted to move his hips against Tony’s leg, to just rut against him and feel the friction through his boxers.
‘I see,’ The billionaire tilted his head, finding it almost entertaining to watch this teen fail to get in. ‘Unarmed, huh? You know what, open one of the windows. Let him in.’
The raven stared at the stranger for a second with wide eyes. Apparently, the blond knew who he was, making Loki wonder if he had ever seen him before. ‘You know my name, sir?’
‘Yes, certainly.’ Loki turned to his work table again and placed the five champagne glasses on a tray, followed Peter through the corridor and down the stairs.
‘God, you really are made for this, huh?’ Tony nearly growled, one hand roaming down the blond’s back, the other resting in the back of his neck. He pulled himself free with a devious grin as he felt Steve’s hand moving towards his crotch. ‘I’m gonna take the lead for now, Rogers. Don’t really trust you just yet.’
‘A spell backfired, Thor’s looking for a remedy on Asgard,’ Steve smiled, placing a hand on the raven’s back.
‘Hey, remember Wanda mumbling something in her native language? You think she cursed me or something?’
The blond looked up at his master and frowned at the man’s stoic expression. Tony had been awfully quiet for the entire trip, hardly speaking a word after they had left the spare bedroom in the middle of the night. It made Steve wonder if he did something wrong, his stomach immediately twisting and tightening with worry. ‘I think your superhero suit needs a name,’ he offered as humbly as possible, hoping to bring his master back to his energetic self again. ‘The one we worked on?’
Loki stared at the man for a full minute with wide eyes, observing all the colors of his suit and the yellow cape that was draped over his shoulders. ‘… Are you an Iron-man suit as well? The one Tony is working on?’
‘If Loki is here, I swear I will-!’ Thor threatened, jumping to his feet the moment the two detectives entered the interrogation room.
‘I am afraid not, Miss Maximoff,’ Steve’s eyes remained locked with Loki’s. ‘He admitted he was with Killian on the exact time of the murder and he is the only one with a motive.’
He gave a few more gentle thrusts, making sure that every drop would be utterly spend into Steve’s body. He panted heavily, his entire body trembling in heavenly pleasure. He let himself fall on top of the doll, catching his breath. ‘Fuck that was amazing.’
‘Cool! You hear that, God-man?’ Quill smiled, wrapping an arm around Thor necks. ‘We’re family now!’
‘Analyzing content, sir.’ The calming voice of the AI echoed through the room. ‘Analyze complete. Content seems to be hybrid, a fusion of both biological and inorganic material.’
‘What?’ Strange managed to reply in disbelief as the woman walked away. ‘Hey! Wait, how is this my fau-’ But as the brunette turned around, her dark-brown eyes glaring at him, the doctor wisely decided to shut his mouth.
‘Uh-huh, yeah, sure,’ Quill said absentmindedly, admiring the innocent and large emerald eyes that stared back at him.
The ride home was silent as Tony had turned down the radio, the only sound audible coming from the engine of his Audi.
The two Disney princes chuckled awkwardly. Tony held op his hand, revealing two small candies. ‘Come on, Cap.’ He smiled. ‘Eat it, before the last rose petal falls, remember?’
‘Well, that’s just another one for my “stores-I’m-banned-from” list.’ Quill smirked, taking another sip from his XXL slurpee.
He sighed and wrapped his arms around the child’s waist. ‘No problem, Lokes,’ he smiled at the god, placing him back on the floor and watching him jump up the stairs, hammer held high.
The teen could barely contain his excitement and leaned a little towards the middle seat to try and look at the man who now was his father. ‘Uhm, dad? M-mister Stane, sir?’
Thor smiled and went downstairs. He joined some of his fellow Avengers in the lounge, drinking a beer before heading to bed himself.
‘Come on, Stark, let’s go before Fury gets to us,’ Steve quickly gave his partner a light push against his shoulders, the two of them hurriedly making their way towards the interrogation rooms again.
‘Not “girl”,’ Steve corrected him, his eyes glued on the tabled Natasha handed him. ‘It was a boy.’ He took a deep breath and shut the tablet down, his attention directed towards his team again. ‘Romanoff, Wilson, I want you guys to take a look into our refugees’ papers. I want to know what would have happened to them if Killian would have succeeded in throwing them out of the mansion. Stark, I want Miss Potts and Thor here, right now. Oh, and Wanda. You know what, bring the whole gang. Put them in separate rooms once they get here.’
So, about this chapter... It's not really one of my personal favorites, but I really hope you will like it.
‘Ah! Rogers!’ A voice sounded behind the main counter, coming from watch commander Rhodey. ‘Commissioner Fury wants to have a word with you. He’s waiting in his office upstairs.’
‘That must be Thor, maybe he has news on how to break Loki’s spell.’ Steve immediately let go of his boyfriend, quickly looking out a window and catching a glimpse of the Bifröst as it disappeared without a trace, except, of course, for the large mark that it left behind on the concrete driveway.
‘унбелиевабле,’ the woman growled in her native tongue, nearly forgetting to switch to English again. ‘You clearly have no idea what you are talking about, do you? Thor and Bucky are like brothers to me!’
‘But we don’t have a confession,’ the blond argued in frustration. ‘Why tell us that gruesome story, why tell us what Killian did to him but deny murdering him?’
‘So we could stay, of course,’ Loki nodded again, tears trickling down his cheek without him even blinking. He held his fingers in front of his mouth, absentmindedly tugging at his bottom lip between his fingernails till it almost bled. ‘I overheard Bucky and Thor talk to each other. They said that Mister Killian tried to send us back to our- our own countries, a-and that there was nothing they could do about it. I wanted to know if that was true, so I went to Killian and, h-he said that we had to leave. I begged him to-uhm, to let us stay… I didn’t want to leave, I didn’t want to go back to the Faroe Islands… So, Killian, he, he offered me a deal.’
Peter suddenly heard a voice from behind him. He turned around and started to laugh as he saw the little trickster wrapped up in toilet paper, a grin on his face so wide that the teen could easily count all his teeth.
It was only then that he felt a body tightly pressed against his own. It was warm, soft, chest gently heaving in peaceful breathing. He looked down, noticing the contrast of pitch black hair against porcelain pale skin.
‘That’s a good name.’ The blond held out his hand yet didn’t come closer. ‘Why won’t you come down, Peter?’
The three turned their attention up the stairs again as they heard the unamused voice of the captain.
‘Did I… Did I not do well…?’ Steve asked cautiously as he tried to sit up. He moved slowly, his body trembling though his expression remained stoic. ‘Did I-?’ he froze as he felt the pool of blood and semen underneath his legs. ‘I… I stained the bed. Master. I am so sorry. Please. Let me take care of this. Allow me the chance to clean up the mess I made.’
‘Oh, hey, Thor,’ Natasha said as she walked in as well, a slight smile on her face, Bucky and Clint right behind her.
‘Not really, no,’ Wanda frowned, her voice steady. ‘I already told you this when we met, I hardly spoke to him.’
‘Yes,’ Loki mumbled but still wrapped an arm around her neck. ‘It is good to see you again.’ He then looked past the woman and saw the two other Avengers standing behind her, his eyes wide as he noticed their battle outfits.
The trickster nodded along, not really knowing how else to react. ‘Might I ask you for something to eat, sir?’ he then asked, his hands now on his stomach as he came to realize he had not yet eaten breakfast.
But there was just something about it that made the hair on the back of his neck stand up. That something being its dull and milky eyes.
‘Sorry to interrupt,’ Thor said as he walked towards the two, ‘but could you pl-’ the god stopped midsentence as a knife came down and landed right between his feet. He then looked at the trickster and the soldier with a heavy frown.
to get in as well?’ Peter asked in disbelief and he crossed his arms. ‘First of all, no. I am sixteen, I’m way too old for that. Secondly, it can be dangerous to-’
Loki remained silent for a moment as he thought this through. He then nodded and looked at Peter with a smile. ‘Agreed. I will go take a bath and then we shall watch this Disney.’ He let his head rest against the captain’s chest, closing his eyes as he listened to the blond’s heartbeat. ‘I am not tired yet, so I can watch this movie all night. I hope it is pretty to look at… or fun… or pretty fun.’
‘I don’t,’ the woman stated curtly, her black leather shoes tapping against the marble floor as she continued walking. ‘I simply don’t think much of the police.’ She smiled at Tony as she said this, earning her a slightly irritated hum in return.
‘Well, no,’ Wanda frowned. ‘Why do you ask? He fell out the widow, right?’ Her eyes then widened, ‘You are from the Criminal Investigation Department, does that mean he- was he murdered…?’
‘Loki,’ Steve approached the young child as Wanda was now washing his face with a warm wet towel. ‘Why were you crying? Did something happen?’
‘It’s okay,’ a male voice, gentle and warm, whispered. ‘I won’t hurt you. I promise.’ The rattling stopped, by which Peter guessed the man had stopped moving.
‘I know,’ The blond responded, his voice strong and demanding, his sharp blue eyes instantly silencing the woman. ‘but our pathologist told us that the chances of him falling out of the window just because of the alcohol were very small.’ He looked at the others, ‘No… someone pushed him.’
‘Our Russian isn’t much of a talker,’ Sam said as he joined his partner, the four of them now being together again. ‘All we got from him was that he hardly knew Killian and that he was taking a shower and going to bed somewhere around midnight.’
The playboy rang the doorbell and took a step back, hands buried in his pockets as he admired the large stones that made the foundation of the porch. He wondered how his business partner could afford such a grand place, knowing Obie made good money, yet also knowing it could never pay for all the costs coming with such an extravagant building.
