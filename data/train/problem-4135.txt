“I know,” Claire grinned as Sam and Dean stomped in, throwing their bags in the trunk of the Impala.
“It seems like I offended you in some way. I don’t quite understand the nuance of human interaction, but if I’ve hurt you, I apologize.”
“It’s ‘cause the baby ain’t a baby,” Dean said. “He uh, he knew that he wasn’t safe, so he aged himself up? Looks like he’s about twenty.” Sam made a noise of confusion but Dean just shrugged. “I gotta get the kid some clothes.” He pushed past him to head to his and Cas’ room, gathering a pair of sweatpants, a pair of boxers, and one of his old, threadbare band shirts.
“Yes, her name is Lilith,” Cas replied. “She is the first demon. She is one of the most powerful in existence.”
“Meat,” Dean said, opening up the fridge. He found a package of ground chuck and emptied it into a bowl, handing it over to Jack. “She can have that, but we’re taking her to the shelter tomorrow.”
Sam shook his head, “If it’s alright with you, I think Bela and I need to go apartment hunting and I’m going to need to try and get my transcripts in order so that they’ll admit me again.”
“Hello Jack,” Cas replied, returning his smile, “I want you to meet Claire and Kaia. They live here too.”
“Yes, they were witnesses to things outside the normal human scope of reality,” Castiel said. Dean snorted.
“When I took over as God, I recreated Heaven into paradise for people that deserve it. People who are good and kind. People who tried and sometimes succeeded to make a positive difference while they were on Earth,” Jack explained. “You did not. You did none of those things, and thus, you do not belong in Heaven any longer. Dean deserves to have the peace of mind that you will never be able to hurt him again. That your opinions of him and what you could do will never weigh on his mind. He deserves to be happy.”
“You know, Dean,” Sam said, looking up, meeting his brother’s eyes, “Kaia getting ready to go to college has me thinking about how I want to go and finish my own degree.”
“That’s a nice thought Sam, but you won’t be alive long enough to do anything about it,” before Sam could respond, Bela’s hand was around his throat, squeezing until he couldn’t breathe. Sam gripped her wrist with both hands and pulled as hard as he could but the supernatural strength of a ghost was hard to fight. He stumbled back, to the table, and fumbled for his bag. Eventually he found the salted-holy water filled flask and unscrewed the cap, spraying it over Bela. She disappeared and Sam gasped in relief as air filled his lungs once more.
“And it wasn’t enough,” Bela said sharply, her eyes hardening and muscles tensing. “I still died, I still got drug down to Hell and Sam, you know exactly how terrible it was. How much it hurt, how much it tore us apart. Tore and ripped and chewed until we broke.”
“You did learn some nice carving skills from Alastair,” Pestilence mused, but before he could continue, Cas popped in right behind Pestilence and wrapped his arms around the horseman.
“I won’t break, Dean,” Cas said after they parted, though their foreheads still rested against one another. “I’m not made of glass. I’m an Angel, I’m as old as the Earth itself and my true form would incinerate most that look upon it. A single kiss will not be my undoing.”
“Claire, you must know...what happened to you and your family,” Castiel truly did sound remorseful, she noted. “There is
“It’s perfect.” They had the tree chopped, wrapped, and strapped to the top of the Impala all within thirty minutes. “Can we get hot chocolate?” Claire asked, noticing the stand as they were about to leave.
After Cas disappeared, Sam and Dean gathered up their things and dropped a few bills on the table. Sam sent Mary a quick text that they had found the Cupid, and they headed out to the alley behind the restaurant. Dean yelled out when a laughing, naked man tackled him in an approximation of a bear hug.
“Ellen called but I wasn’t - I couldn’t…” Mary stuttered out, struggling with her words, “How did this happen?”
“Ellen! Hi! I know this is surprising, but uh, it’s me, Sam,” he blurted out, flinching when Ellen yelled and swore into the receiver.
“We will,” Claire mumbled into Dean’s chest. “See you in a few days.” She hugged Cas goodbye as Dean did the same for Jack and soon they were in their car and on the road south.
Before long, Sam and Bela returned with a stack of pizza boxes, and everyone gathered around the long tables in the library. They shared pizza as they chatted and laughed, the relief in the room was palpable without the looming threat of Michael coming to kidnap or harm Jack. Eventually, people broke off from the group and headed to bed, exhausted not only from the events of the day, but from the weeks prior.
“What could have done this Bobby?” Dean asked, shaking his head slightly. “No EMF, no sulfur, no ectoplasm. The salt lines were intact, all the warding...how does something get past all of that and leave no trace?”
Looking out the window, Sam saw Dean approaching, so he opened the door and stepped out. Dean shook his head laughing a little, “I can’t guarantee that you won’t get a face full of holy water, but they’re ready to see you now.”
“No, Cas got to me before I ever drank a single drop,” Sam said. “But…she’s still down there. She doesn’t deserve to be stuck there. I promised I would get her out and I will. After all this apocalypse shit is done, I’m saving Bela.”
It started when Bobby received a worrying call from a hunter - Olivia - that was cut short. He pulled Dean along with him to go check on her only to find her slaughtered in her home - all locks engaged, protection sigils and wards untouched. There were no clues to how she met her death. They cleaned up her place, gave her a hunter's funeral, and made their way back to Sioux Falls.
Bobby rushes out of the room and his blood is rushing so loud in his head he can’t hear anything else.  He keeps yelling at her, but he’s not listening, he’s got his hands on a rifle and he has no idea what he’s doing, doesn’t really remember getting from one place to another, everything is rushing around him.  His heart is pounding so hard he can feel it in his fingertips.
They had shown up two weeks ago, the three of them driving up in the Impala in the thin early morning sunlight.  Bobby had met them on the porch, cup of coffee in hand.  The steam was curling visibly in the chilly air.  Dean shivered and tugged the sleeves of his hoodie down further over his knuckles.  He was glad to be here.  Just seeing Bobby there dressed the same as ever, in that ratty old hat of his, made the tightness that had been curled in his chest the past couple of days loosen a little.  He helped Sammy get their stuff from the trunk and made sure he didn’t forget anything in the backseat, and by the time the two of them were making their way up the stairs Dad and Bobby were already talking in clipped tones to each other.
“It’s not your job to worry about me!” Claire protested, slamming her hand on the table. “I’m an adult, I can take care of myself!”
It was November.  Too chilly in this part of the country to be outside in just a flannel, and the metal is cold under his fingertips.  The wind hasn’t stopped blowing all autumn, and as still as everything feels in this moment he can still hear the chaotic tumbling of the windchimes from a neighbor’s place being carried over on the breeze.  He can hear Alex Trebeck’s voice drifting out from the living room, a reminder of the peace of the last month that had ended the moment John had shown back up.  Barking orders, telling his sons to get a move on.  Dean had hopped up and gone straight upstairs to pack their things, but Sam hadn’t moved from where he was sitting on the couch.
“Claire?” Cas spoke, squatting in front of her in the open doorway. “I know you’re tired but you need to eat this before you take a nap, okay?” she looked down to see a sandwich in his hand. She took it and ripped open the plastic packaging, taking a large bite.
“You’re not gonna heal her,” Dean said shortly. “She got hurt on the hunt, she needs to deal with the consequences and learn her lesson to be more careful.” Jack tried to protest but shut his mouth with one look from Dean, sitting quietly next to Claire at the table. She knew that Jack considered Cas and Dean his fathers, but was he really going to obey them like that? He was
Sam looked around the room, noting that the gods seemed to be arguing over a wide range of topics, “I think we run,” replied Sam.
Claire was thankful for the break, her leg was burning and she knew she needed to clean it and put on fresh bandages. She quickly found a larger truck stop and pulled into the lot, parking near the back to settle in until Cas reached her.
“No,” Cas said as he watched the screen. “He will likely know you two on sight, and he will be able to sense my grace as soon as I get close enough. We need a distraction. Something that will keep his focus off you two.”
Susan smiled at their interaction, and Dean thought she might’ve been figuring out they were together, but the next words out of her mouth nipped that idea in the bud.
“I just told you Dean,” Sam huffed. “Be direct. Ask him for his number without any excuses. Ask him to grab a coffee sometime. Tell him you want to have his babies. Make it incredibly obvious that you’ve missed half of what your professor is saying in favour of staring at him.”
Dean wasn’t sure what he expected when he rocked up to Professor Azazel’s office for the preliminary meeting, but it wasn’t
Dean froze in return. Although he’d been mentally referring to Castiel by the shortened version of his name for some time now, he’d always been sure to keep to ‘Castiel’ when the other student was around him. He couldn’t exactly go around having a nickname for his rival, after all.
Through everything, though, Cas had been by his side. No matter what mood he woke up in each morning, no matter how much energy he did or did not have, he knew he could rely on Cas’ support. That he would be able to forevermore. That Cas didn’t care if he had a purpose, if he did anything with the rest of his life beyond simply being as happy as he could be. And a lot of the time, that was enough.
“I don’t want to inconvenience you and Sam though, and I’ve always been perfectly fine without a birthday before.”
the Empty in the first place, and there weren’t exactly ready-made portals they could step through that would conveniently give them the access they needed, as much as Dean wished there were. Things would be so much easier if there were.
I'm considering reworking how i title these given we almost 100 days in and it's still all supernatural but idk if i can be bothered changing all the old ones,,,,,,,,,,
Sam made a ‘go on’ gesture at Dean, realising his brother was just gonna stare at him unless prompted otherwise.
i reference a couple of petty incidents in this that i haven't actually written out fully yet (obvs) but i think they're fairly easy to get/unimportant in the grand scheme of this drabble if u don't know what its referencing, but obvs I have full context so i may be wrong
yall im so fuckin tired my brains in full-on fog rn i used the last of my energy to try and make today's thing coherent but i probably failed lol
Cas had mentioned wanting to experience the more simple joys of life without the weight of a hunt overshadowing them, and Dean had been unable to do anything but agree when he was met with the force of the angel's bright eyes. The first of these ‘simple joys’ he wanted was apparently a beach day with friends, so they’d organised one the next time they were near enough to one at a convenient time.
,” Bobby said. “Now I’m not. That kid of yours, well, he made some changes here. Busted my ass out. And then he set some things right. Tore down all the walls.”
to verbally acknowledge it to Sammy in this case though. The look on his face definitely said everything he needed it to.
As he complained, he again risked taking his eyes of the strangers to peek at Cas, only to see a small smile spreading across his lips.
The first time Dean blinks himself awake to find he’s curled up on the couch with Cas, a pinkish light washing over them from the sun setting outside, he has to take a moment to pause and laugh at himself.
“I cannot believe you used to not need to sleep at all, babe. I’m happy to lie here for a little while longer, but you know I get antsy after a while, so don’t complain if I disturb you again, alright?”
“Oh, good. I mean, I’m bi— which you already knew, considering you saw my pin the other week, but it’s always good to connect with other people from the community especially when they’re attractive and I’m going to shut up
i did manage to finish that yoi series I was talking about!!! its amazing what one can achieve by ignoring their other responsibilities <3
changed, no matter how monumental his confession had seemed as he was giving it— there had been this unspoken
Cas grinned, knowing he’d successfully distracted Dean again, but didn’t move his hands from their new position.
Dean had a soulmate somewhere, and she was waiting for him to crash into her life and uproot it in all the best ways, just as he had Castiel’s. It didn’t matter that he was becoming more and more sure that the individual he was dreaming of each night was Dean— he was an angel, after all.
im genderfluid so my lived experience is obviously different to that of an ftm trans person, but obvs I have all the love and respect in the world for y’all. also I went into this going ‘ok how could I see dean coming out to John go down’ then ‘and how can I make it still fit in canon’ because my brain has been blaring the goddamn ‘dads on a hunting trip’ quote constantly as it’s seemingly in Every Episode Recap for season 1 & 2. This may one day be extended but idk lol
surprised when he slips down to lie next to her a few hours later and somewhat gruffly asks what’s been bothering her.
y'all i'm officially NOT gonna be homeless in a month when we have to vacate our house, we got an accepted rental application finally!!!
It probably shouldn’t have been, he realised, sitting himself down next to Miracle and wrapping a comforting arm around his body. Most dogs didn’t react well to storms, and they had no way of knowing if Miracle had ever encountered one before. All Miracle knew was that there was a scary growl like sound coming from outside, one that might pose a danger to his home and pack.
The blonde was wearing a tight Led Zeppelin tee, and a lifetime ago he probably would have hit on her. As it was, he saw a slimmer of interest rise in her eyes as he approached their table in time to hear Cas clearly state “Yeah, my husband
And as he shoved his hand in his pocket again, nervously checking for the familiar shape and weight of the ring box, Dean smiled.
“I told him it couldn’t possibly be true because I’d seen you bring a girl back to the motel that evening. That you must’ve made a move on a girl some dude in town liked and he was spreading rumours as payback”
“Well,” he said, glancing over to see Cas looking predictably bewildered. “I guess that’s what she meant about ‘booked wrong’.”
Chaps 20, 62, 64, 67, 72, 79, 102, 118, 136, 159— Cas and Dean's convo continues, and Dean is horribly confused
Cas glanced across at him, and obviously something was showing on Dean’s face, as the angel crossed the room in an instant.
Dean felt Cas nod as much as he could while they were still wrapped around each other, and tightened his arms before walking Cas back blindly towards the bed. Later, they would talk over Dean’s worries and Cas would share some of his own so Dean would understand it wasn’t just him that was concerned about these things. Later, they would make a plan for how they wanted to proceed with everything surrounding hunting, what they would do in case of another (albeit unlikely) apocalyptic emergency coming their way, how much they themselves would do to prevent it and how much they would leave to the other hunters. Later, they would do all the practical work to ensuring that if either of them started worrying about these things again, the other would have something solid to point to and say ‘It’s okay, we can handle it, we know what we’ll do if there’s ever a next time’.
Dean snorted from where he was at the stovetop, only glancing back to see the slightly wild look on Cas’ face.
It wasn’t until he saw the tension leaking out from Cas’ stance that he realised how stressed this whole conversation had been making the angel. A small smile crossed his lips, and Dean couldn’t resist tugging him in for a gentle kiss.
Dean snorted slightly and raised an eyebrow at her. While that was technically true, Claire did not have the
Now that Cas has acknowledged the truth of the matter, however long it took him to reach this point, he finds himself
“Ok, good. So you know that everything I say to you comes from a place of genuine affection and care.”
Although Cas had known what to expect, this time round — had decided dealing with the vulnerability and powerlessness that came with humanity was worth the privilege of growing old alongside Dean — some parts of the experience still grated on him.
“If we finish the prep work early we can take a break before starting to actually cook everything? Have a little quality time and work to scar Sammy when he inevitably wanders through the kitchen?”
So, they hit the books. They started with the bunker library, of course, but they also reached out to the hunters and other in-the-know people they’d learned to trust over the years. Their friends may not be able to dedicate themselves as wholly to the task as Dean had decided to, but that was fine— they were looking, and that was enough.
for those days. Not really — he wouldn’t trade what they had now for the world, so trading it for the days they spent sleeping in shitty motels constantly on the job would be actual insanity — but there was something comforting about being watched over by an insanely powerful being every night, and it wasn’t something he’d allowed himself to appreciate when he’d had it.
If he wasn’t usually seeing them in conjunction with those impossibly blue eyes, he’d almost imagine they were disconnected. And given that he very much doubted his soulmate was walking around with an actual pair of wings, symbolism was all he was left with.
, but that meditation thing you do to pass time sometimes is pretty much the same thing, and I know you read in bed a lot of the time.”
i wasn't planning on writing this again today (as u can probably tell I've been tryna rotate through aus over the past lil while) bUT i think that not worrying abt that and just. writing for what i want to write for even if its a few days in a row of it is much more sustainable.
much detail and more just implies shit) and also how I imagine Sam’s soulmate situation is. I’m imagining that his dreams are abt Eileen but I’d probably have to retcon a lil about the first drabble I wrote for this au in terms of when dreams start happening (as I imagine dean and cas would get together earlier than the two drabbles read together would imply abt the timeline)
, even if Dean felt like his soft smiles were a lot less adorable than Cas’ were (and that was saying something, as Dean felt he was pretty damn adorable at the best of times). Dean wasn’t exactly stupid. He
“Then you have as much cause for concern as I do. If you have a scholarship, people saw as much intelligence and potential in you as they see in students like me, if not more.”
his vids are all excellent, both informative and entertaining. they also make me feel things because like— as a community we truly have fought so hard for so long for mainstream recognition. like, idk how I would explain it to someone whose not part of a minority, as idk what would make it relatable to someone who hasn't experienced it/a similar feeling, but I almost get overwhelmed by the mix of pride, gratefulness, kinship, and grief i feel when I look back on queer history
Cas grinned at the tease, putting his mug down in favour of manoeuvring himself behind Dean and wrapping his arms around his waist in mimicry of their usual sleeping positions.
im trying to catch up to whats been posted of a long ass yuri on ice fanfic series I really love that I started reading in early 2017 and I just caught up to where I got to on my last reread/catch up attempt and I'm so scared that I'll lose the momentum again ZSHDFJKZSF. last time I was fairly fresh of my cfs diagnosis and was entering year 11/12 school subjects stress, tho, so hopefully my better management of life even in times of great stress + more relaxed schedule with online uni bode well for me keeping the momentum and finishing with catching up
As Dean spoke, he drew his attention away from where he was packing things in a day bag one-handed in order to lean in closer to Cas, till their lips were brushing gently. Cas’ pupils had dilated slightly in response to Dean’s words, and he lingered for a second more before pulling away with a smirk and a shrug.
Was almost more terrifying than the idea of confessing first and getting rejected out of hand had been. Because he had his hopes up now, felt like he was
“And? I don’t suddenly lose the ability to go shopping when the clock ticks over into pm, you know.”
i rly sat down like 'fuck idk what to write' then started a second fucking soulmate au huh. the other one isn't even finished. why am i like this.
was reading platonic best friend vibe fics today and it was whack bc it made me think of my closest friend but also was bittersweet bc it made me think of the girl i had the friendship breakup with, but in an afterthought type way? and it's good bc it means my brain is like, moving on or whatever, but also sad that it has to happen and also that sometimes connections that we thought we'd have forever are fleeting in the grand scheme of things. like, two months ago i thought she'd be by my side for the rest of my life and now our friendship reads more like a footnote to my teenaged years.
per se, it was just that, Cas only had so much time to spend on Earth on any given day, and the newfound friendship between Sam and Cas really cut into the occasional late-night talks that Dean had grown used to with the angel.
As it turned out, they didn’t need to find Death, because he found them. Sam and Dean were sitting in a relatively empty diner in the middle of the night, nursing shitty black coffee and dry scrambled eggs when the bell hanging from the door rang out, letting them know someone had walked in. They took no notice of his entrance beyond that until he walked over to them, stopping beside their table.
Dean hung up the phone and dropped it onto the table in front of him, Cas looking up from his book. “Is she okay?” he asked worriedly.
When the Cupid finally put Sam down, Dean advanced on him with an angel blade, “You’re going to tell us what the hell you’ve been doing to people and why, or I’m going to kill you right here.”
Once they got into the car, Sam set up the tape and pulled out of the driveway. Cas sat in the passenger seat and stared out the window as the unfamiliar sounds washed over him. Though Sam raised his eyebrows at some of the songs Dean had chosen - he did wonder how oblivious Cas was to not see Dean’s feelings for him - he remained silent through the duration of the mixtape.
“I think I can make an exception just this once,” Jack agreed and before her eyes, the entire kitchen was sparkling clean.
Sam smiled softly and reached across the table to grab her hand reassuringly, “When I was in Hell, I met up with Bela. At first, I didn’t know what to say to her, and it wasn’t like we had much time anyway. Before I saw her, they’d string us up and torture us, and just when we couldn’t take it anymore, we’d be healed and the day would start again. And then, after I...after I said yes, talking to Bela was the only thing that got me through it -” he was cut off by the sob that escaped him.
“I’m glad she did, and yeah, why you did it was pretty shitty, but you were a different person then. You didn’t know all the stuff you know now,” Dean reminded him, reaching down to card his fingers through Cas’ hair. “And I think she’s starting to realize that.”
“You’re pretty too,” Kaia whispered, giggling a little when Claire leaned up and kissed her, taking the book from her hands. “Don’t lose my place!” she insisted, tugging herself away from Claire to try and reach for the book.
“It’s been ten years,” Dean said bitterly, cursing under his breath when Cas walked in, dropping the books he was carrying onto the nearest table when he saw John.
He had a feeling Cas would be reminding him of exactly how happy they both deserved to be very, very soon.
He might not know Castiel well yet, but he wanted to provide whatever comfort he could to his new husband.
That… didn’t happen often, given Cas' continued lack of familiarity with a lot of social cues, and seeing him so comfortable with a stranger was odd. And to see the women smiling and leaning in closer to Cas in response made something that felt a lot like jealousy flare up within him.
(although a niggling thought at the back of his mind whispered that he had a good guess as to why, even if not ‘why
to), and Charlie’s accompanying grin had him instinctively bracing for trouble. He didn’t bother turning to see the mystery customer— they’d both been trying (unsuccessfully) to set him up since he explained what happened with Daphne, and it wouldn’t do to encourage them. Instead, he stayed leaning against the counter, sipping at his second mug of coffee for the shift.
He was probably more surprised than he should’ve been when his next conscious moment revealed that he was in a hospital. Or as far as he could tell, anyway, given he was yet to open his eyes. The beeping seemed like a good indication that this was
i've been writing almost daily for a bnha wip so I keep forgetting I need to update this fic as well LMAOO, like even if one day I Do forget bc of that I'll still be sticking to the letter of my resolution so it's fine but its the principal of the thing you know?
He didn’t say anything Dean didn’t already know. They’d had conversations similar to this one before, back when they were first discussing the possibility of children together, before they were even engaged. Neither of them had had particularly healthy or happy family lives, growing up, and the confirmation that they would actually be getting a baby had brought up all their residual fears that somehow they’d end up fucking up their children in the same way. Some part of Dean suspected they’d
Sam and Dean are shooting him slightly concerned looks at this stage, with Dean in particular pushing him to stay back at the motel if he’s not feeling up for a hunt, but outside the burning in his chest and the heavy feeling in his lungs, he feels completely fine. It’ll go away soon.
Sam doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t have to. All it takes is them meeting each other’s eyes for everything that’s happened while he’s been stuck out here is communicated instantly.
this is my emotion-based coping strategy for the stressor of sitting through way too many fucking academic integrity lessons.
Cas would just have to deal with the reality that he would likely never know, not without changing his vessel. And he’d grown quite attached to this one, despite the general confusion gender brought.
“Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure my parents and tutors wish me and Sammy were more formal than we are, but they’ve never tried to stop us from being friends with someone, regardless of status. It makes us ‘more approachable as rulers’, apparently, not that I’m complaining. Nobles tend to be much more stuck up.”
These scenes probably wouldn’t appear next to each other in the full work but they both were what came out sooo
have the start of some unrepentant crack (treated seriously) which spawned bc i listen to sawbones and in one of their eps sydnee was talking abt how may cultures/countries had a belief that some form of 'tooth worms' existed and i thought it would be funny if a case somehow revolved around that. i don't fucking know ok. my brain creates these things and i simply write them down for you all.
Once the hunters got back to Sioux Falls, Mary called Bobby and Karen to come over for dinner as well as to discuss the new information they had gotten. As everyone gathered around the dining room table with takeout containers of Chinese food, Mary stood back for a second, smiling at how full her house was. She had once feared that the death of her husband would leave her and her children without family, but she was so grateful to have been wrong.
While Odin regaled Dean with his villain monologue, Sam had broken free of the ropes that bound him to the chair. He surged forward and situated himself next to Dean, Ruby’s knife angled to stab anyone who challenged him. “Yes, I unintentionally broke the first seal, but we intend to stop this apocalypse before it happens. We have the Four Horsemen’s rings, we have a spell to track down Lilith, we’re doing our best,” Sam said, almost pleading.
At Cas’ comment, Dean tasted it himself, eyes widening, “Jesus,” he said, suppressing a cough, “Can you get some heavy cream out of the fridge for me?”
“I know it was you three, and you will pay,” Dean growled and stomped out of the room. They made sure to wait to hear his bedroom door slam shut before all three teenagers burst out laughing, Claire falling from the bed to the floor.
“Not quite, but there was a bit of intrigue. Because at first I thought it would be your pretty little girlfriend that was killed. What was her name? Joy?” Famine clasped his hands together, looking up at Sam with a cruel grin.
“I know,” Claire rolled her eyes and pushed Dean away lightly. “Now go, you guys have to get on the road if you want to make it in time.” She waved to the three of them as they drove out of the bunker’s garage, shutting the door behind them. She sighed and descended the stairs, hoping she could make it back to her room where Kaia and Jack were sequestered before John spotted her, but no such luck - he was sitting at the map table.
“I don’t give a damn about Lilith!” Bela shouted suddenly, glaring at Sam with wet eyes. “You were supposed to save me! And you failed!” Just before she could reach Sam, she blew up in a burst of smoke. Sam was breathing heavily as he watched the spot where Bela stood only moments ago, and when he received a call from Dean that they completed the spell and the spirits were put to rest, he finally allowed himself to collapse onto the floor, and let out a painful, heaving sob.
“I just have one more thing I want to do,” Claire said decisively, “And then we can go to the park or something to eat.”
Kaia looked down at her hands for a moment, steeling herself, “Sam has been helping me apply to some colleges and...I got accepted to one that I want to go to. Sam said that the Men of Letters have some crazy savings and that they’ll pay for all of it and...I really want to go to college, Claire.”
“Shh!” Claire held her finger to her lips. She and Jack were hiding around the corner as they watched Cas try and locate his reading glasses. They were currently sitting on a shelf in the library, but he had left them sitting on his bedside table.
“You mean since this morning?” Bobby said gruffly. “Not too much. There have been some more strange, biblical occurrences, but we still don’t know who or why besides demons.”
“I look forward to spending time with you too, Cas,” Dean admitted, feeling his cheeks heat up, knowing they would be a bright red.
“I don’t really know how but...it was Claire,” Jack’s voice was barely a whisper. Cas took a deep breath and closed his eyes to think. “She didn’t mean to! I don’t know what happened but I know it was an accident. She’s...she’s really scared. She’s not talking.”
Just as the circle of angry deities converged on them, pressing ever closer, a voice from the crowd shouted, thundering impossibly over the clamoring of weapons and murmurs.
“It’s okay,” Claire said, turning to face Jack with a smile, “I suppose it does. We’ve all been so anxious to meet you.”
It had only been a week. Claire had been stuck in the bunker for a week already, but it felt like months. She had spent the first few days protesting by staying locked up in her room but that grew boring almost instantly so she took Dean’s suggestion. She began helping Cas in his small garden, listening to him ramble on about the different types of plants, vegetables, and fruits he was growing and how to care for each one the best. She took Miracle on a walk every morning, and sometimes another one in the afternoon if there was nothing else to do, and she helped Dean man the phones and research any lore that a hunter needed.
“No, not yet. You two got any opinions?” Claire began walking down the row of trees again, looking each one up and down. She finally stopped at one, it was tall, taller than Sam probably, and it was big around too.
The old man didn’t pick up, so Dean left him a voicemail, explaining the case in as many details as he could without raising suspicion to anyone around him. He flipped the phone shut to end the call and stored it back in his jacket pocket.
“I don’t know. Sam and I don’t really do anything but since it’s Cas’ first Christmas as a human…” Dean trailed off.
“Bela,” Dean confirmed. “You mentioned her before and you say her name in your sleep all the time. And what Alastair said about her in that church? I always figured there was more than you were telling.”
Cas and Dean’s facial expressions shifted from anger to concern instantly, “What’s wrong?” Cas asked anxiously.
“Why do you always provoke him?”  She’s looking at him when she says it, and he feels like he might be sick.
Cas put the heart back into its container and used his grace to clean the viscera from his hands, “Not one single Cupid, multiples. They’re a low class of angels. We need to find it before it kills again, this is incredibly abnormal.”
Dean drew a shaky breath once Cas had finished explaining everything that had happened, “So...even if you find the sire… there’s no way…”
“We just scoop some in and move it around so it sticks to the butter?” Claire shrugged and dumped a little bit of flour into each pan. By the time they were all covered, both Claire and Jack were covered in flour, though she wasn’t entirely sure how it happened. They began working through the recipe, the mess increasing the further along they got and by the time the cakes were in the oven, they were covered in their dry mixture, Jack had egg in his hair, and Claire had some melted chocolate swiped over her forehead and cheeks.
Cas decided, for Dean’s sake, that he would move to one of the other bedrooms for a few days, just so that Dean could grieve in the way he needed to, without seeing the man responsible for his father’s death.
Everyone turned to Cas when he spoke up, “Back before the situation with Metatron, Heaven was very rigid. Orders came down from the authorities, and it was our job to follow them. Naomi led the sector that was responsible for...reprogramming those who dared to disobey orders.”
“Well then, get outta that accountant get up and come here,” Dean said, gesturing to the Impala. Castiel looked unsure as he took off the trench coat and suit jacket, but did as he was told anyway. Dean rolled his eyes fondly and walked over, rolling up Cas’ sleeves for him, as well as undoing the tie. Dean did his best to not think about how close they were standing or just how easy it would be to lean in. He cleared his throat and stepped back.
“Hello Father,” Jack said, a wide smile spreading across his face. Claire’s eyes flicked to Cas for a brief, nearly-imperceptible second, but she chose not to comment.
“I remember every single minute, Bela,” Sam whispered, closing the distance between them so they were practically standing chest to chest. “I’m sorry - I’m sorry I couldn’t save you too. If I had known what was happening, where I was going when the angels grabbed me, I would have brought you with me.”
“Castiel?” Mary asked as he stepped into the kitchen where she was sitting at the table, drinking a coffee. “What are you doing here already?”
“You think you’re better than this? Than me? Just because you don’t want to hunt? What we do saves lives!” John yelled, and they were standing face to face at this point, wearing matching expressions of anger.
And his mother will hop up to get him and mutter apologies.  Maybe she’ll bump into his chair and he’ll tell her to be less goddamn clumsy and his mother will apologize some more and hand him the knife with shaking hands.  They’ll sit in silence until his father complains that they aren’t having meatloaf, and then he’ll look at Bobby and say
“It’s in Sioux Falls,” Kaia explained, “I thought maybe we could stay with Mrs. Winchester or something, I don’t know. I think it would be good for us to be somewhere close to people we know, you know? And it’s not far from here, we could get a car, maybe, come visit Sam, Dean Jack …”
“We need to get out of here now,” Cas said gruffly, abandoning their shopping cart. Dean patted his pocket to ensure that he had one of their angel blades on him, making eye contact with Cas once he was sure. Cas nodded, and they made their way out of the store quickly.
Claire was about to switch from 400 to 196 and she texted Cas to let him know when he called immediately to tell her to find a place to wait for him, as he was less than ten minutes from Wichita.
“Fuck man,” he said, looking up to see Castiel standing in front of him. “What the fuck, can’t you knock?”
John went to pour himself another.  “I’m their father, I know what’s best for them.”  There was no room for argument - there never was, not with demons and not with his kids - so Bobby’d shut his mouth and asked if he’d seen the latest Cards game.
“Wait, I thought you would want to be near your family,” Jack said, turning to face Dean. “That’s why I put them all so close.”
“Okay, but why don’t they blame me? It was my fault, I did get them killed,” Dean clenched his hands around a new bottle.
After he hung up the phone, Sam grabbed the Bible that he had open near him on the library table and began searching for a specific passage. Before he could find it, however, he felt a gust of wind and when he looked up Bela was standing in front of him. She looked like she did the last time he saw her alive - before the Hellhounds had drug her down.
Sam pulled the car back onto the highway, letting Dean explain the entire situation to Cas. He pointedly ignored them and turned up the radio when he couldn’t make out the sound of their voices anymore. About an hour into the drive back to Sioux Falls, Cas told the brothers that he was needed back in Heaven, and disappeared in a flutter of wings.
“Well, it’s about a six-hour drive to the bunker, so if we leave at eight, we’ll get there at about three or four depending on how long our breaks are,” Claire mused. “Sound good?”
“It’s people that they couldn’t save,” Dean said without pause. “That’s who’s been killing the hunters, at least that’s what it seems like. Mom and Bobby have both seen ghosts of people they didn’t save.”
“Hey Sam,” Claire said as she sat down, seeing the younger Winchester the first time since they returned. “Jack said he went on his first hunt.”
Castiel shook his head, almost sadly, “I don’t know their location right now, but if you can get ahold of them, I can transport us both there.”
Sam and Dean didn’t notice the difference until they drove by the hospital which was….deserted. There were no cars in the visitors lot, no ambulances coming in or out. If they didn’t know any better, they would think the hospital was closed.
“I think I’ll do it tonight at dinner. I want Dean to know that I love him and that I really do consider him my father, but I would also like to see him choke on his beer,” he mused.
“You had to do it, Sammy. There was no other choice,” Dean said through his own tears, “It’s going to be okay. He would’ve killed us if you hadn’t killed him first.”
“Guys, what if this is Famine?” Sam asked suddenly, sitting up straighter in the passenger seat,  “And it’s not just food that people are hungry for? Maybe it’s like… people overindulge on the one thing they’re craving? Maybe Famine is somehow able to corrupt the spell that Cupid put on them.”
“Of course,” Jack smiled into Dean’s chest and inhaled deeply. He had missed the comforting scent of pine, leather, and gun oil that seemed to always cling to Dean. “I’ll see you soon.”
“What do you think this is?” Claire asked, pulling out a woven leather bracelet with several multicolored beads. There was only a small tag attached by a piece of twine. “It says…’Band of Veracity’ and nothing else.
Sam shook his head, “I still don’t know. This angel, Castiel, pulled me out of Hell. He said something about Heaven having a plan for me, and how I needed to be alive to finish my mission on Earth.”
When he was finally able to pull himself away, Eileen had shown up as well. The five of them were all sitting out on the back porch of the cottage, overlooking the lake, as they drank and reminisced over their happy memories.
“That sounds delicious,” Kaia said with a smile. Growing up in the system and life on the road meant home-cooked meals were few and far between.
“Why don’t you kids go on in and put your stuff down.  Pour yourselves some cereal or I can fix something in a minute,” Bobby said, shooing them past the adults and into the house.  As the screen door banged shut Dean could hear the two of them going on about something, but he didn’t bother listening.  It wasn’t his problem, not in this house.  Instead he ran up the stairs with his bag to the room that he always called dibs on when they stayed here.  He threw his bag on the bed and immediately went back downstairs to the kitchen.  He opened the cabinets one after the other, pulling stuff out as he went, and then opened the fridge to stand there and survey the contents.  He grabbed the eggs, bacon, and milk out and turned when he heard Sam pull out a chair.
She was startled anyway, “Jesus Christ, Dean,” she said, slightly breathless, “I need to get you a bell or something, fuck.”
The drive to Colorado was awkward, to say the least. John had insisted on driving, leaving Cas to entertain himself in the passenger seat. John didn’t turn on the radio, didn’t bother to hold conversation.
Cas let out a sigh, “Yes, John. Not only have I been alive for millennia, but I’ve also killed vampires alongside your sons for more than a decade now.”
“And Michael is working with Naomi, so excuse me if I’m worried about what could happen to him.” Cas said icily, narrowing his eyes.
“You...you lying little queer!” Claire saw John rushing toward her and before she could tell what was happening, she was hunched over and John was above her with a knife in his gut. And her hand was wrapped around the handle. “You…” John tried to say, though as she spoke, he spat up blood. Claire could do nothing but watch in horror as he slid to the floor, the knife easily slipping from her grip as John’s body sprawled over the tiles, blood pooling around him.
“Man, I don’t even know who the fuck you are, and you expect me to sit here and kiss your ass? Why aren’t you out there trying to stop the apocalypse?” Dean retorted, with a roll of his eyes.
“Dean,” Sam whispered but Dean just shook his head. They stood together for hours, waiting for the flames to finally die down and their father’s body to be nothing more than a pile of ashes. The sun was rising over the horizon when they finally climbed back into the car and drove a hundred miles north before Dean pulled into a motel. He got them a room and led Sam inside, sitting on the bed.
Dean clenched and unclenched his fists a few times as he played over the conversation in his head again. For a brief moment, he remembered the nurse from the day they arrived in town - the case was over, he could go find her now and spend his last night in Greybull with some stunning company.
“It’s obviously something. You were in Hell, Sammy, that’s not something you just get over or move on,” Dean said worriedly. “I just don’t want you to get lost in there or something.”
“That it’s demons, just like we suspected,” Dean said. “He said he doesn’t know why the demons are doing all this, just that the angels are trying their best to stop them whenever they can.”
“Has it? Time...moves differently in Heaven. What can I be of assistance with?” Castiel asked, either not bothered by Dean’s frustration or he hadn’t even noticed.
“Because you believe them to be better than you are and thus, they would not have broken the first seal,” Cas said assuredly.
When neither the exorcism nor the holy water had an impact on the demons, the hunters looked at each other in concern. Even more shocking was the way that the demons recoiled when the hunters aimed shotguns at them. Mary was the first to take off in a run, and everyone else followed suit. They managed to find their way to an empty church and barricade themselves inside.
Gabriel explained that he and his allies in Heaven had built an army, and were working on a plan to stop Michael, but that they were unsure of his plans, and he didn’t feel that they were ready to take him on quite yet.
If not for the podcast playing through the headphone Cas had put in one ear, he probably would’ve opened the passenger door and thrown himself out of the car.
He was about to give up and go to sleep when he had an idea. He opened his bedroom door, surveying the hallway quickly to make sure that nobody saw him. As quietly as possible, he snuck towards Claire’s room, where he could see light peeking out from under the door. He knocked quietly and waited.
“But now that we’ve talked, are you okay with us helping you through things like your nightmares?” Mary asked.
“They are?” Claire asked, and her voice sounded so small, even to her own ears. “Even though I’m a hunter, and I’m…” she couldn’t say the word, but she knew Jack knew what she meant.
He was almost done when Cas joined him, taking the proffered mug of coffee Dean held out to him. “Thank you,” he mumbled, leaning against the counter.
is him?” Claire looked back at Jack with wide eyes. He didn’t look like he had the conviction to kill a fly and she was supposed to believe that he was
“And that’s not sketchy at all, to you?” Bobby prompted. “He’s an angel of the Lord, he’s been alive for millions of years, and with the entirety of Heaven trying to stop the angels, he has no idea what the demons are doing?”
“I think it’s best that Dean finds out what happened from someone that’s not Claire, so that he has time to process everything,” Jack said decisively. “You go, Claire is going to need you.” Kaia nodded gratefully and hurried to her and Claire’s room to get some clothes, picking a pair of sweats and one of Dean’s old band shirts. She brought them back to the bathroom, and fortunately Claire had gotten undressed and was scrubbing her body under the water, perhaps a bit too viciously, but Kaia understood the feeling.
The two of them fell asleep like that, curled up in a bed that wasn’t theirs, stomachs churning with guilt of unfelt grief.
Dean woke up far earlier than he needed to, anxious about Jack’s training with Rowena, though he wouldn’t admit it. He knew that he needed to be confident to alleviate Cas’ obvious worry. He smiled at his boyfriend’s sleeping form, pressing a kiss to his temple as he crawled out of bed. He knew that Cas wouldn’t be awake for the next few hours at least. After millenia of never sleeping, the former angel couldn’t seem to get enough of it as a human.
“Come on Miracle!” Claire cooed as she took plenty of pictures of the dog, dressed up in a very cute cupid costume for Valentine’s Day. Jack stood next to her holding a treat to keep Miracle’s attention. “That’s a good girl! I’m gonna give you so many treats!” Finally, she stood and carefully took the costume off Miracle before Jack fed her a handful of her favorite snack. “Now I just have to print these off and leave them for Dean to find,” she said, scratching Miracle’s head. “He’ll be furious!”
“You sure you don’t have any Godly duties to attend to?” Claire asked, not quite sure how she felt about sitting down to watch a movie with Jack.
Castiel began showing her the different letters and words, telling her what each was and what it meant as it was not at all comparable to English.
She punched him in the shoulder lightly and gave him a wry smile, “Don’t ever do that again. Next time, you bring me with you.”
“Cas, do I really have to stay here for four weeks?” Claire asked, turning to face him as he poured himself a cup of coffee.
“I...I’m not sure?” Sam said, though it sounded more like a question. “He’s...he’s my dad and I’m upset that he’s dead because he’s my dad but…”
“Yes, I noticed something was off the moment I landed. Give me a moment to search the town,” Castiel nodded solemnly and then disappeared. Dean opened his mouth to complain but before he could even get a word out, Castiel was back.
Ash nodded, “It looks like some weird stuff has been happening in River Pass, Colorado. It looks like several bridges were destroyed, the main river in the area is heavily polluted as of recently, and it looks like the power grid in the area is totally down.”
“Alright, go on and get it over with,” she said, looking between Cas and Dean. “Yell at me for doing something I know I shouldn’t have and for dragging Jack with me.”
“Great,” Dean muttered. “I’ll go get him some clothes, and tell everyone what’s going on.” Cas smiled gratefully and turned his attention back to Jack. Dean pushed the door open with a heavy sigh, grateful that only Sam had remained, likely wanting to give them privacy.
“Now what is that supposed to-” John stood from his chair angrily but Jack interrupted him before he could continue his tirade.
“It’s just me!” Jack said quickly. “I am very sorry for startling you, but I wanted to speak with you before going back to the bunker.”
The air around them pulsed with a kind of energy that neither of the brothers had ever felt before, despite their frequent proximity to Cas, and other supernatural beings. Sam supposed, off-handedly, that the shift was due to the fact that these beings were far more powerful than any they had encountered before. Dean mentally inventoried the number of Colt bullets he had with him, knowing that it was far from enough to get them out of the room alive. He reached out and squeezed Sam’s arm briefly, as much of a goodbye as he was going to get.
“If by names like mine, you mean biblical, then yes, all angels have biblical names. Or rather, all biblical names come from the angels,” Cas pondered. Dean laughed again, laying his arm over the back of the bench, his hand close enough to touch Castiel’s shoulder.
“How are you in here? I thought there was too much warding?” Dean asked, stepping over the body to face Castiel more head on.
“Cas,” he said, reaching forward to cup the other man’s face, moving it back and forth gently to try and get him to rouse. “Buddy, come on.”
“What demon have you ever seen that could handle a full exorcism rite, not even flinch at holy water, but then cower at the sight of a shotgun?” Dean retorted.
Kaia nodded, pulling Claire into her arms, “We still belong here. They still want us here - God, they’re going to want us here even more with a baby around. Plus, we can’t leave this baby to grow up with just the Winchesters… even Bela isn’t powerful enough to keep it from turning into a full-blown Winchester without us.”
“And Lilith is the first, therefore the oldest. So her idea of fun is playing house?” Dean asked incredulously.
Dean nodded, “I fixed her up nice for you, figured you’d need some way to get around town and, like Cas said… you know.”
When Mary and Jo seemed satisfied with his answer, he turned to Dean, “How’s he doing? Have the doctors said anything?”
“Doesn’t really make it okay, dude,” Dean said gruffly, downing the rest of his beer. “So, you’ve checked on us. We’re all alive and kicking. You got any other heavenly duties to attend to?”
“If you got something to talk to me and Sam about, you can do it here,” Dean said. “Everyone here, they’re family.”
Dean worked in silence for a few moments, occasionally placing a t-shirt or pair of pants that he didn’t mind parting with on the chair beside him, before he addressed the elephant in the room, “So… ‘Father’, huh?”
“Don’t you talk to me like that, boy,” John pushed himself up from the table, his chair falling back, hitting the linoleum floor with a crash. Dean hurried to put himself between the two, creating a physical barrier.
Claire really didn’t know how she kept getting herself into these situations. She was in the boiler room, hiding from this fucking rugaru who had jumped her as soon as the door opened. She had her gun cocked and ready in her hand, she just had to wait for the perfect opportunity. She was staying as silent as she could to listen for footsteps. She could hear them nearing her, but she wasn’t certain which direction he was coming from and she didn’t want to take a shot she could very well miss by a mile.
“Okay, but how? Are they signs because she’s doing them or is she following like a list?” Sam asked, raising his eyebrows after a moment when Cas refused to answer.
“It’s so stupid, I know it’s fucking stupid,” she said, not looking up at Kaia, but knowing that she was listening regardless.
“I may have been...distracted,” Dean said. “But I still heard Famine. When he talked about why you weren’t under his influence.”
“Alright, Jackie,” Claire whispered once they were alone outside the classroom door. “You’re gonna do great. Just be you, you’re awkwardly charming and weird, kids love that.”
They all froze when they heard a door open down the hall, Kaia peeking her head out the door. “It’s Bela, she’s heading to the bathroom, we’re good, let’s go!” she whispered, and they all filed out quickly to rush to Jack’s bedroom. Once they were safe inside with the door closed, he made them all visible again.
“I was thinking…” Rowena hesitated, “Considering what we’ve been doing, the room you’ve put us in is a wee bit small. It might be best if we used that field you have outside. I wouldn’t want to damage this little… bunker of yours.”
Sam rubbed the back of his neck, “I was thinking… since, for once the world isn’t ending… maybe I’d move out. Maybe Bela and I would move to Manhattan so that I could finish my degree up there.”
The man narrowed his eyes, turning his head to the side in a way that made Sam think, offhandedly, of a dog. “Samuel Winchester…” the man said, “Whether or not you pay for those items is none of my concern.”
“Didn’t think angels would have a sense of humor,” he said. “So, you gonna tell me what Alastair was doing or am I gonna have to play Clue to figure out what he was doing in the attic with the reapers and the rope?”
“I was eating lunch alone in my classroom,” Troy said solemnly. “Next thing I know, I’m in the gym with all the b-bodies and I’m being arrested.”
Before Cas can finish what he’s saying, Sam is out the door. Everyone watched in shock as he left, both by the revelation about what he had done, and by his abrupt reaction. Bobby, Mary and Dean exchanged looks. “Who’s going to go after him?” Mary asked, “He shouldn’t be alone right now.”
“What do I do?” Dean whispered brokenly, keeping his eyes up toward the sky. “What do I do when I see her again?”
“Where are Mom and Dad?” Sam asked after a lull in the conversation. Dean tensed up immediately, looking down at the beer bottle in his hands.
“It...it really is,” Jack forced out between laughs. “You look like you got run over by a paint roller, like in a cartoon!” Claire rolled her eyes and wiped both hands up the back of her thighs, coating them in as much paint as she could.
“And what about the shit Pestilence was saying? About Lilith?” asked Dean gruffly, “You think we can trust it?”
Jack was quiet for a moment, taking the now clean pot from her when she handed it over. He rinsed and dried it, putting it back in its rightful place before answering. “Cas and Dean are my fathers. I love them and I respect them. I know that the things they ask of me are things that they believe are for the best. So I listen to them.”
Dean paused before leaving the room, taking a minute to himself. He had been prepared for a baby not for...this. Not for a fully grown person who can walk and talk right out of the womb. He had no clue what to do about any of this.
“See, there’s always something good. Sammy dying was the worst part of my life but I got you out of it,” Dean smiled down at him. Cas returned it and tugged Dean down to meet his lips in a kiss.
“Great! But we have to wait for Jack to decorate it, okay?” Claire said and without waiting for an answer, took off down the hall to her bedroom. She changed into some of her warmest clothes, quickly braiding her hair and shoving her hat on her head, meeting Cas and Dean at the entrance to the garage. “Are we taking the Impala?”
Now that he was over the exhilaration of actually killing John, the guilt was beginning to overtake him. He took a page out of the Winchester book of not dealing with things, and poured himself a glass of whisky, and set about making the bed in one of the guest rooms.
“If you’re not careful, you’re gonna spoil me,” he quipped as he ripped the paper off. He slid the top of the box off to reveal his gift: a t-shirt, mug, beer stein, and key-chain, all proclaiming in a big, almost obnoxious font “Best Dad Ever”.
“Jack,” she whimpered, drawing in a shaky breath, “He left. He said he had to go to Heaven and he told me to apologize to everyone,” she broke down again, and he pulled her close, rubbing her back.
“I’m proud of you too, you know?” Bela said, finally pulling away from Sam’s lips. “For finishing your degree. It’s been so long since you had to drop out. Over forty years, if you count your time in the pit.”
“I am!” Claire led the way to the kitchen, pulling the recipe up on her phone. She had already read through three times and she did it again with Jack.
Jack began to explain that he had just been practicing some of his powers, and that he had wanted to show Claire and Kaia what he had been learning, but then he had gotten confused while levitating Claire and then somewhere along the line, a small fire had started. Dean shook his head, “The three of you need to be more careful. No more messing around with your powers until we find someone to help you out more often than Gabriel can,” Dean said with a sigh.
Sam made his way to the nearest road and picked a direction to walk in, assuming that he would eventually run into civilization no matter which way he followed it. Just when he was considering stopping to give his legs and lungs a break, he saw a telltale marker of a convenience store: a sign that offered a mediocre deal on beef jerky and Pepsi.
“Yes, Dean has asked me to cease looking into his mind. He says it’s a breach of privacy the NSA wished they had. I wasn’t sure what he meant, but I do as he asks,” Cas explained. Sam let out a small snort of laughter.
Everybody turned at the fluttering sound they’d all become accustomed to - some more than others. “It means that Lilith is possessing the body of a child,” said Castiel.
Sam looked down at the table, falling silent once more. “Baby,” Mary reached out and took Sam’s hand. “You held out far longer than anyone else would have. 30 years of going through that, of being...tortured daily, you are so strong.
At that, Azazel shifted his eyes and Dean flew several feet, colliding with the side of a crypt with a resounding thud. He didn’t move, didn’t even make a sound.
“This should go quickly,” John said, “They’re probably still sleeping because it’s not quite night time yet.”
“Hello, Jack, did you need something?” Cas asked once he picked up. The kids were all fairly independent and wouldn’t call unless it was something serious.
“Do not think that I will hesitate to end your existence if you try anything,” Cas said with a tilt of his head. “Now, where is Famine?”
“How? What happened?” Cas asked, keeping his voice steady and calm, hoping it would help Jack feel the same.
John’s mouth flattened into a thin, hard line, “Don’t tell me how to raise my sons, you don’t know the first thing about being a father.”
.  He’s gasping for breath then and standing and shoving everything he can into the bag.  His head is buzzing.
Claire made sure Jack remembered at the last family dinner so that he would come down for the entire day. She also talked to Cas and convinced him to get Dean out of the bunker for the entire day so that she could complete her plan without interference.
“Uh, no, not yet,” Dean shifted and grunted. “But now that you’re both here, I’ve got a grill out back that I’ll fire up and we can have good, old fashioned Kansas City barbeque.” Jack knew that Dean was changing the subject on purpose and decided to respect his wishes. He knew it wasn’t his business why Dean had not spoken to his parents and yet - he was still curious.
“Yeah, he’s hanging out in a nursing home about 30 minutes away,” Dean said. “Not sure why he gets off on killing people that are so close to the grave, but,” he shrugged.
“Sammy, come on,” Dean tried once more to insert himself between them, but John was seething at this point.
“Uh-huh,” Dean replied sarcastically, “See, when some creep dressed like a Mormon who dabbles in serial murder walks up to me and addresses me by name, respect isn’t my first response. Start talking before I shoot you.”
“Definitely a demon,” Dean said as they stepped inside. There wasn’t much left behind of the crime scene, all the blood and bodies cleaned up days ago. “See anything?” he asked as they walked around the perimeter.
Chaos broke out, gunshots and shouting from more directions than Azazel could keep track of. While none of the shots damaged him, his shock was evident. Mary seized the moment of his confusion, aimed and cocked the Colt. She screamed  “This is for my boys, you fucking asshole,” and pulled the trigger. Miraculously, the shot hit home and Azazel twitched and flashed before them, eventually crumpling on the ground.
“Good night boys,” Mary said and kissed each of their cheeks. “Get some rest, you two have earned it.”
they’re entitled to, you aren’t their Dad,” John said.  It’s not the first time he’s said it, he’s always dropping them off there and then acting like he had any right at all to decide what his kids got up to while he was gone.  As far as Bobby was concerned, it was none of his fucking business if he let the kids be kids.
“I am ready to return to Heaven, yes,” Castiel said, head tilting as it often did when he was unsure of what Dean was referencing but knew it was
Their eyes met as Castiel approached, and the knot in Dean’s stomach somehow managed to both tighten and loosen at the same time when he was sent a small but genuine smile. God, now was
The hardest part of hyperfixating on a show with 15 seasons and deciding to watch it from the start with ur mum is being terrified about characterisation and also not knowing whats fanon and whats canon. This is all dialogue because my brain was like w o r d s. also I wrote this while cuddling my cat, unsurprisingly
“Do you think I’d be pushing you to try this if I was planning on one, putting you in any real danger, or two, pushing you further than I know you’re capable of?”
technically it this could/should be called internalised biphobia given dean b bi bUT given its abt liking dudes/being seen out and about with cas rather than liking multiple genders i went with homophobia. can u tell I'm tired and rambly lol
At some point after things had settled, Castiel started wearing nail polish. Dean couldn’t pinpoint the exact moment it started, having seen it as a relatively unimportant development considering Everything they’d been through in the past few years, but he couldn’t help but smile every time he saw what flash of colour Cas had adorned his fingers with each week.
“Would it be too forward of me to suggest that I know a way to make your week even better?” He asked, and Cas straightened up while raising a cool eyebrow.
“Ah, that’s okay. You were the one who said you needed help, dude, if you’ve figured out what you were having issues with then that’s a good thing. Is Meg your... girlfriend?”
Another moment of silence elapsed, but Sam didn’t dare speak and break it. It didn’t seem like Dean had finished speaking yet, even with the pause.
I'll try and post tomorrows earlier again but that's mostly to help fix my sleep schedule again, its not at it's best rn (also because if I continue the trend of writing and posting these later each day eventually I might just. not finish b4 midnight lol, esp since often the later it gets the slower I write. also the quality probably goes down slightly lol)
, despite all the loss he’d faced in his life, and goddammit if he wasn’t gonna grip onto that happiness with all the force he could muster in order to keep it in the here and now, because he
“Love you,” he murmured pulling away just far enough that he could form the words, before Cas joined their lips once more.
so uh i wrote this in ao3 bc formatting (less autocorrect) and accidentally reloaded the page because I'm a fuckwit sooooooo :) had to rewrite it :)
“No, I don’t want you to ignore our marks. It… brings me great joy to know you may reciprocate some semblance of my feelings towards you.”
They stayed staring at each other for another moment, a sort of giddy relief flooding their systems at
“You don’t think he cares about the nightly well-being of his beloved pseudo-parental figure?” Dean asked. “How heartless! Kids these days, they become all-powerful and all-knowing ethereal beings and then lose all respect for their elders. I can’t believe it.”
Cas had pulled him out of the crib, likely to forestall any cries he otherwise would have made upon waking. He had a bottle in one hand, and was cradling Jack with the other, looking down at him fondly as wide eyes blinked back up at him. Now that Dean was closer, he could identify the noise as Cas humming softly as Jack fed, and a soft grin spread across his face as he observed he quiet moment.
melt into Cas’ embrace, it didn’t take long for him to pull away, especially if someone else was in the room with them.
believe it took us almost 10 years to get to this point,” Dean admitted, wiping the evidence of his mirth from the corner of his eyes.
low key wasn't in a writing vibe today but we've come this far so we know I can't give up now dfslfjah
“I think she thought it might force us to put aside our differences and work together for a change.”
“It’s not like knowing that birds take actual baths is something that would help me on a hunt, ya know? That’s usually a big factor in what random knowledge sticks in my brain.”
“I think that using her as a starting point for research is probably best, in that case,” Sam decided. “We can start looking in the books I brought with me, and we can check the bunker’s library when we get back. And we can explain what’s been going on to Dean over dinner later.”
last honeymoon drabble! the pieced together fic isn't quite finished bc I've been distracted but I'm planning on spending ten minutes or w/e each day to write something to stick in this fic while i finish it up in the next few days.

and therefore couldn’t reject Cas and his matching soulmark and everything it represented for the two of them.
Despite the amount of focused attention he’d put on trying to organise the wedding in a way where it would run smoothly, Dean had no real opinions on what he and Cas would do for the honeymoon.
, as of late. Like whatever force God had left in charge of developing soulmate dreams had gotten pissed off at him ignoring the truth and had stuck up a dozen neon signs and a loudspeaker all blaring ‘DEAN WINCHESTER IS YOUR SOULMATE’ at him every night.
was gonna respond to comments today bc i know I'm a day or so behind bUT i slept rly badly last night so i don't have the braincells unfortunately. hopefully tonights better!!
Dean had pinked and started to back away as the flood of words left his mouth, and Cas felt his cheeks darkening in response.
Dean doesn’t know when he fell in love with Cas, because there wasn’t a single defining moment where it happened. He didn’t look over one day and fall in love in an instant, didn’t have an epiphany where suddenly everything made sense— it was more of a slow-building realisation, an understanding that grew over the years they’d spent fighting side by side, an innate fact of his life that came to the surface more and more as time passed.
this was almost a hp au because the fanfic I've been reading today is a hp one (a series i rly love just updated for the first time in ages but i was actually already rereading it before the update zdlvfdh) b u t i couldn't get the vibe right so y'all get this mess instead (oh and in case it wasn't clear by past chapters/ans what my view is, fuck jk rowling and her transphobic bullshit)
make his own move. If losing Cas in a way that seemed so permanent had taught him anything, it was that he couldn’t take these things for granted anymore. The only real question was what would that move look like, and how would he take it??
“Well, more’s the pity. I have to get going, but I hope the rest of your road trip goes well! I’ll give you Tasha’s number just in case.”
to, as such— honeymoons were about relaxing with your new spouse and taking advantage of some time away from responsibilities. And it wasn’t like they’d avoided going into town completely— They’d eaten at a few different cafés and had gone for a walk through town when they first arrived.
Dean tried to respond, tried to find the words to explain the depth of his feelings, but the words failed him. Cas seemed to sense this, as he squeezed Dean’s hand tightly when Dean opened and closed his mouth a few times.
(also dw abt me its not anything rly bad i just haven't left the house much recently but also haven't done any virtual meetups w my irl friends as the reason we haven't seen each other isn't entirely covid. like the mini 5 day lockdown we had in melb prevented our planned meet up but we couldn't do a virtual one instead as one of my friends parents are rly strict abt technology use on Sundays which is when we were gonna see each other)
(“Loverboy was asking after you today!” Meg later announced, walking into Cas’ dorm room with the dramatic flourish he’d come to expect since they first became friends.
Chaps 46-52, 73, 75, 107, 141, 177, 181, 195, 213, 233, 246— to the surprise of absolutely no one, my love of soft mornings has infected this au once again
putting in the time and effort this venture deserves from this point forwards,” Cas declared, before leaning in and connecting their lips once more.
As he combed through the wings, most of Cas’ misaligned feathers straightened out quickly. This worked to dislodge the already loose feathers that had been trapped, and he soon had a small pile of angel feathers built up in front of him on the bed.
Although he’d made a big deal out of celebrating Cas’ birthday, Dean didn’t actually have many grand plans for the day. Sam and Eileen had initially been planning to pop over for dinner, with all their other friends and family members unavailable till the coming weekend, but an emergency with a younger hunter had led to them sending their apologies the day before.
So they sat on the beach, arms around each other, and held on tightly to the last few hours of guaranteed peace they had.
, not knowing if the vestigial amounts of grace he had left would be enough to heal the hunter, and Dean had come-to to wide, terrified blue eyes and the desperate press of lips against his own. Sam
Cas grabbed him before he could pull away to tug him into a proper kiss, flushing lightly when their lips eventually parted.
Chaps 20, 62, 64, 67, 72, 79, 102, 118, 136, 159— cas again just. does not communicate his feelings with anyone. bc bottling them up inside is healthy, isn't it? that's how being a well adjusted human works???
Ten or so minutes later, Dean and Cas found themselves sitting across from the tall man — who apparently went by ‘Alec’ — in his personal office.
Before he’d had a chance to, a glowing portal opened up next to his desk. Dean instinctively flinched, as it looked
But that sorta thinking was a little bit heavy for 7 in the morning, so Dean found himself mentally filing it away for later. Right now, he had a newly-human boyfriend to cuddle.
Magnus and Alec both looked increasingly shocked as they went on, even as Dean and Cas responded nonchalantly to every follow-up question they thought to ask.
Dean glanced at Cas to see him looking, unsurprisingly, incredibly bemused at Susan’s question. He hooked his foot around Cas’ ankle before deciding to field the question for the both of them.
planning on taking a meandering route home, they’d have a long drive ahead of them, especially since Dean was prone to give into Cas’ obvious interest in every dumb tourist trap they passed. Sam had told them to take as much time as they wanted, that him and Eileen could hold down the fort together, and Dean knew they were enjoying the privacy as much as him and Cas were.
“Are— How is— Am I making you unhappy, in some way? Have I been a bad friend? Because Cas, man, you gotta know by now that you’re important to me and Sammy. I’m— I’m not always the best at showing it, we know how I am about chick-flick moments, but god, we’ve all been through
Dean blinked at Sam silently, a small part of his brain rising in hope before the more rational sides tried valiantly to quash it down again.
Chaps 121, 124, 132, 149, 154, 171, 183, 202, 211— sometimes you gotta drive ur best friend to the verge of homicide just by being a little shit, ya know?
“I just…” Cas paused and sighed, trying to gather her thoughts. A moment passed, then another, before she thought she’d be able to adequately express herself to Dean. “Do you ever feel
the shoes that i impulse bought last week of depop arrived today and they bring me so much fucking joy

still not in a writing vibe bUT this was easier than yesterdays was! nothing exciting is really happening to me rn except for end of semester uni stress lol, so idk what to say here fkxjfvslxj
be pushing it down. Dean deserved happiness, no matter how he found it. Castiel had no right to feel entitled to his affections, no matter how he personally felt. Soulmate connection or not, Dean’s free will to choose who he pursued was his right.
“I don’t want to inconvenience you and Sam though, and I’ve always been perfectly fine without a birthday before.”
flying got him this nervous, didn’t have any specific incidents he could point to as having awoken this deep-rooted fear within him, but he guessed things just worked like that sometimes.
After the barn, Dean has to take some time to process. He’d spent such a long time wondering if he’d get to meet his soulmate, if the demon deal he’d made had fucked with whatever forces were in charge of bringing their paths across each other's, and here was this being claiming to be an angel that looked like he’d walked out of every single one of Dean’s dreams. If it wasn’t for the wings, he’d wonder if Castiel happened to be possessing his
WOW I WONDER WHAT IVE BEEN DOING THIS WEEK AHAHAHAHAHAHA I TOTALLY DONT WANNA MURDER INCOMPETENT REMOVALISTS RN AHAHAHAHAHAHAHABAHAHAHHAABAHBAH
I've been watching a lot of michael reeves and lilypichu (offlinetv in general tbh) bc michael uploading again made me realise a) i haven't rewatched his vids in a while and b) i never subbed to otv for some reason and only had watched a couple of their vids. in some ways its been a vibe because i love the chaotic energy but on the other i am procrastinating way too fucking much. this is not relevant at all to today's drabble but i figured i tend to tell yall whats going on in my life and this week that's been forming shiny new parasocial relationships to cope (also it explains why this is a bit distracted lol)
Dean squeezed his hand slightly tighter for a beat, hoping Cas could read the unsaid message of support, before swinging their arms lightly between them.
the shadowhunterse verse and it wouldn't leave my brain so here we are. as always idm if u skip drabbles as not everything is everyone's cup of tea, and i know that applies even more to crossovers for various reasons.
(If Dean pulled Sam into a hug and thanked him for forcing the two of them to talk when the brothers next got a moment alone, that was between him and Sam, thank-you-very-much. And if a few months later, at a quiet wedding ceremony held with all their friends and family in attendance, a toast was held in Sam’s honour thanking him for ‘getting the pining idjits to pull their heads out of their asses once and for all’, then. Well. No one would try and argue the toast was undeserved.)
Chaps 167, 168, 169, 178, 192, 198— conversations with oblivious people can be annoying, but they don't know that that's what this is yet
Deans free hand lifted up to rub the back of his neck, but he didn’t make any attempt to loosen the hand he had entangled with Cas.
Castiel honestly didn’t know which possibility would be more devastating to him, and he wasn’t exactly looking to find out. So, silence it was.
“Everything’s fine, Prince Castiel. I was just wondering if you would like to accompany me for a walk in the gardens? I feel as though it may benefit the both of us if we were to become friendly sooner rather than later, considering we are expected to spend the rest of our lives with each other.”
we only watched lazarus rising bc mum had to go to work but i was very excited the entire time and damn near vibrated out of my seat any time cas' presence was felt. my mum was,,,,, concerned. but to quote sky, joy is stored in the cas.
it's gonna make me cry. I decided I don't have the emotional energy to read it tonight and I'm gonna probably sit down with a couple of hours to read it and cry tomorrow (it's called "holding the man" if anyone curious, there's also a movie)
“Ah, yes,” Cas stated, nodding dryly. “All that pop-culture knowledge you have is absolutely vital when it comes down to vanquishing spirits. It’s a wonder that I made it through hunts before you started introducing me to television.”
But above everything else, losing the ability to instantly soothe all the aches and pains Dean dealt with on a daily basis hit him harder than anything else.
nuh uh’ phase, and that didn’t always flag with people as the clear overcompensation that it had been. There was a reason it'd worked effectively for Dean for so many years, after all. Who knew?
to having everything he’d ever wanted, and he didn’t want to feel that all crumbling beneath him ever again.
Castiel was slightly dishevelled when he opened the door, formal clothes a mess and hair rumpled as though he'd been sleeping, and he seemed slightly surprised to see Dean standing outside his room.
He briefly considered that his soulmate could be a supernatural being of some form, but he usually dismissed those ideas. For one thing, most supernatural beings didn’t have soulmates. Those that did, the beings who had previously been human but were turned, such as vampires and werewolves— Well. None of
Now that he had Cas — real and here and not just in those dreams he’d never been truly able to suppress back when they were still not talking about things — he wasn’t ever planning on letting go.
It was after a particularly messy hunt, an incredibly violent pair of vengeful spirits that had left them going back to their hotel room to lick their wounds and recollect themselves after salting and burning the bodies. Dean had patched up Sammy’s wounds as diligently as he always had after a hunt and looked expectantly at Cas as he hovered next to the chair awkwardly.
anyway this one has a linked full fic in the end notes because it's 1k of me projecting my own feelings abt how I personally plan to handle any serious relationships I enter into w non-ace folks, although obvs I'll be careful because douchbags are out in the world 😔
to make up for the fact that i also have no clue why tf cas is crying I'm just gonna pretend that in every instance he was getting his w a wave of sad vibes from soul-selling au!cas somehow
decided to swing by and had sent him an ‘I’ll be interrogating you about this later’ look when he reacted to her presence with obvious surprise.
we had the house auction today! it didn't go as well as we'd hoped but. welp. the house be sold at least lol. I'm not in a writing vibe unsurprisingly, too much s t r e s s but hey somehow I always end up with new aus/stand alone drabbles on these days. its bc I pull from the vibes of what I've been reading each day. i might repurpose this for an existing uni connected au at some stage, it could probs fit in them with a little bit of editing and is kinda floating on its own rn (we know the coffee shop au is gonna eventually touch on dean & cas' study lmaooooo even if currently their ages are unspecified)
“Sometimes I wonder how you got hired,” he stated, already grabbing out a dustpan and broom, and Dean waved him off.
Suddeny dean kissed me passiojtately. Dean climbed on top of me and we started to make out lyingg on the couhc. He took of my coat and I took off his flanal. I even took off my tie. And then….
But outside of that connection, part of him wondered if he’d chosen Dean because of how theoretically easy the transition would be for his family. They already called him ‘Dee’ half the time anyway, what was tacking one little ‘n’ sound on the end gonna hurt? And the simpler that transition was, the more likely that John would actually manage to stick to it, if he ever decided to actually make an effort to understand his son.
saw friends today, which was nice, but that was including the friend id been having the friendship breakup with so that was slightly awkward. we kinda settled into 'we're still gonna be friends just less close' given we're in the same friendship group so we can't like, cut each other off completely (I wouldn't want to anyway) but it means I'm gonna have to be careful abt my emotional investment for obvious reasons as otherwise things could get real unhealthy for both of us (+ we've said we'll use this as a period where we're more distant with the possibility of being as close as we were prior to this year remaining open but not a guaranteed future outcome)
Chaps 167, 168, 169, 178, 192, 198, 205, 215, 221, 237, 253, 265, 272— end of w/e encounter this one is
“I’m glad you were allowed to form those types of connections growing up,” Castiel commented, smiling softly at Dean. “Eden encourages a much more… Formal view on relationships, and while on some level I can understand why my parents believe it is the best way to handle things, it means I feel quite lost when I need to socialise with people.”
At Sam’s question, Castiel recalled Dean asking the exact same thing, back when they had only met a handful of times. It was funny how the brothers could mirror each other so well even unintentionally, although Sam’s question seemed less out of the blue than Dean’s had been.
Rather than responding, he glanced down at his phone again, knowing that it had rung out. There weren’t any new calls or messages yet, but the fact that Cas had called
i don't even know if they read these (the only person I know for sure does is sky thanks sky ily sky) bUT troy deserves to have a little baby jack content. as a treat. this will probably turn into something longer eventually (or at least I'll write a full baby jack fic eventually even if it's not a continuation of This Specifically) however my mums work schedule means our spn marathon has slowed down slightly from the breakneck speed we entered it at and given I've committed to watching all 15 seasons of this hot garbage (I love it but why am I doing this to myself) I figure I should wait till I have like. Even the tiniest bit of actual, non-fanfic related context for everything I know happens in the show. also I'll be very busy staring pointedly at my mother every time dean is Obviously Bi bc she's not yet convinced. i have no clue what state cas was in re:being an angel (most of the canon plot based fics i've read are ~s5/s6 ok) when jack arrived so I've called him an angel in this even though that might not be canon accurate? don't question it i couldn't be bothered reading the wiki and also good omens has made me feel like everyone with an angel/former angel partner calls them angel as a pet name as well as that just being What They Are
The next morning, before Deah had had a chance to start cooking properly, Sam cornered him in the kitchen; meeting his eyes calmly. It wouldn’t do to spook Dean now, before Sam got the answers he needed.
yeah sorry for the weird vibes on this one, i had a serious conversation with one of my best friends abt how disillusioned our gen is with the world and capitalism and also successfully dissuaded them from a slightly ecofascist mindset (in the 'is humanity even worth saving' way which like. very valid to grapple with as humanity sucks at times b u t it's important to remember that humanity isn't this amorphous whole, it's made up of individuals, many of whom are good and worthwhile and deserve to live happy and full lives even if they are not born yet) and then immediately sat down to write this as I write in the evenings and me and my friend were talking through the late afternoon lol. this is like, a
“Cas, who the fuck told you that and where are they now, because I need to go kick the ass of whoever led you into thinking that way.”
“Yeah! God, yeah, Cas, I’ve been alright since you kissed me yesterday. I just— forget you’re not the only person in your body, sometimes.”
tried to hit on Cas but had backed off when Cas made it clear he wasn’t an option. Good to know. He just hoped she had more luck with the next attractive man that entered the bar.
“Knowing your father wasn’t the perfect person you used to pretend he was doesn’t erase the years you spent trying to get him to stick around, nor the relationship you had with him prior to his passing. The fact that it wasn’t a
one of them. Additionally, he had a spark of magic in his bloodline, no matter how small, and usually that scared off creatures that might otherwise attempt to prey on him in the night.
now, and it was hard to stay oblivious when you’d lose focus in a conversation only to realise you were daydreaming about macking on your best friend.
In this particular instance, Dean and Cas were in the middle of a date around a local museum when Dean noticed a woman looking at him with
uni starts for me tomorrow officially 👀!! I still need to like. work out where on my unit site i go to access my classes but I'll work it out tomorrow somehow x,vkzdbjfv,.h bfvk
“Dude, it’s chill. I mean, I’m a little offended you didn’t mention it before now, but I get that soulmarks can be private. God knows I don’t like to talk about mine constantly.”
decided to weaponise my muse against itself for a bnha series I'm working on by jumping back and forth between the fics in it given I have all the major beats planned out and as such will not fuck myself over by setting something up in a future fic that unavoidably contradicts earlier stuff. this is weaponising my muse against itself bc writing often feels like a race to complete a story b4 I lose interest in it, but by jumping all over the place I should essentially trick my brain into never losing interest (as its like I'm writing 4-5 fics at once with shorter updates to each, kind of like this drabble fic.) hopefully it works well enough that I'll eventually be in a place to publish the series lol, as I do not want it to live in my docs/notes forever.
Perhaps that’s why, when Sam had shoved them out of the bunker with the insistence that they ‘take some time off, seriously, you guys are so overworked it’s stressing
He padded out of the room quietly, leaning against the door frame as he observed his angel interact with Jack.
“I told you yesterday, angel. I’m all in. Shit might be a little, uh, hard for us before we sort you out with a hot new vessel, but we’ll get through it. Anyway, I’d feel like a dick if I was shacking up with someone else for a night knowing I could be having you, even if we can’t act on our relationship a lot of the time. You’re kinda it for me, Cas.”
YES i am starting a new au YES i still only have an Australian jaffy's understanding of how uni/college works (for non-aussies— jaffy is a slang term used at aussie unis that means 'just another fucking first year' and can be used in both affectionate and derogatory ways. i have no clue if its used anywhere other than Australia dvnczbg)
“I’ve seen videos of them online before,” he responded. “I was more curious about when and why you’d bought them, as they don’t seem like your ‘type of thing.’”
He kept his eyes closed for a few moments more, not yet willing to open them up to the stark white fluorescent that he was sure would greet him, and became vaguely aware of a hand clasped tightly around his own. That was odd, as Sammy wasn’t prone to
as such this is abt what y'all probably expect from my "oh my god I'm so fucking t i r e d" updates given they are very common even when i do get sleep dkgjbx,
of the mornings of their honeymoon. But Cas had agreed to it much more easily than Dean had expected, for all that he seemed to be regretting the decision now.
seem to be pulling up the writing braincell for me and I've been too distracted reading some longer works to think abt writing that much so this is Questionable lol.
also i am once again asking you to use ur imagination and probably superior knowledge of the spn timeline to mentally place this fic wherever it makes sense timeline wise
I’m writing and posting this from my phone and then collapsing into bed I’ll do all my usual clean up shit and comment replies (if there are any djsjsk) tomorrow ✨
started coming through so I'm loaning you money to buy one' and i almost fucking cried except family was around and genders still an ~awkward topic~ with my mum so i didn't wanna talk abt it with her. but seriously i tear up every time i remember I'm so fucking excited i know I'm way too curvy to go fully flat (I'm an au10G us32I lmaoooooooo literally kill me) but because of how curvy i am, literally Anything would b an improvement on the days that i need it. since then it's just been general up and down vibes, but I'm tryna organise seeing my
are there dozens of hogwarts/Harry Potter aus involving dean being scared of flying and Cas helping him get over it? yes. do I care? no
stated Cas was his boyfriend, but he hadn’t thought he’d need to! He wasn’t being particularly subtle— He’d been touching Cas through the entire interaction, and hadn’t expressed interest in her at all. He was just so
It was strange, taking in its new form. Looking around and knowing that he wasn’t just reliving memories, that the borders that had kept it so segregated and rigid had been torn down. It seemed like it allowed for a better afterlife, which had obviously been the goal, but Dean still didn’t think he was ready for eternal peace. The sooner Dean got through to Cas, the sooner Jack would be able to send him back to Earth with the angel in tow.
found a mystery document in my year nine english folder that contains what appears to be a creative oral presentation i did but the writing feels too good to be from year nine me (although there are some errors that suggest it wouldnt have been from a teacher) and also the book its on is one we both didnt study and i dont remember reading. its fucking weird.
Should have tried to, been slightly less focused on his revenge quest and more focused on making sure Dean didn’t have to shoplift just to keep his 11-year-old brother fed on a regular basis.
acknowledging everything that was between them, and Dean felt laughter bubbling up from within him. When it sprung free, bright and joyful in a way that seemed at odds with everything he’d been through in his life, he was slightly surprised, but it didn’t take Cas long to join him. Their laughter filled the hospital room, and Dean found himself grateful that no one came in to check on them. He wanted him and Cas to stay private for a little while longer, without any nosy nurses butting in on their moment.
He’d known that travelling would get more dangerous as he got deeper into the forest. Magic ran wilder here, after all, mostly undisrupted by the noise and technology humanity had brought to life over the years. It was a sort of inbuilt protection and hunting method all in one—Most humans that wanted to harm the forest and its inhabitants would be deterred by the danger involved in such a venture, and those that did risk themselves would often end up as food for whichever creatures came across them.
I didn’t tell you it. I very specifically made sure not to mention his name to you,” Dean questioned, glaring at Sam’s nonchalant expression.
legitimately my first female crush realisation (aka the oh fuck gay???? moment) was me going 'ah how nice would it be to just spend quiet mornings w my best friend, just like cuddling in bed and having breakfast together and shit,,,,, this is totally platonic feels right??
an overly angsty au, the chars don’t give in to said coercion at any point (although they may consider it at times), but if you have issues around that sort of thing then I’d rec sitting this au out 💜
what podcast is it? You said ‘media franchise’ so I’m assuming it’s more a story-based one than knowledge-based, but I can never tell with you. Do story-driven podcasts even exist?”
“I guess I’ll go and watch some Gilmore Girls for the afternoon, then, because you clearly think it’s more important for me to waste an afternoon on binging tv than it is for me to save my
, but they definitely stemmed from his belief that Dean would be happier without having him for a soulmate.
In the weeks before pulling Cas out, when Dean’s every waking moment was so utterly consumed by his grief, by the fact that he
y'all i've been doing so much thinking(/writing and refining) on the fix-it fic that i keep forgetting i have to update this as well lhdczxbvc
i wasn't rly sure what to write today but sky's been talking abt how much dean & cas deserve a baby lately and also all the aus we've discussed at length in servers have included baby talk even more so than usual so i was thinking abt it today and then this happened. it's supposed to b a continuation of chapter 21, so if anyone wants to go peek at that for a refresher then feel free lol but this does not require much context. if i can b bothered i might post the teacher au as a separate work at some point and add more detail to this section (i tried but the convo wasn't flowing write so ~vague and questionable quality it is~) and then people that are put off by drabble comps can appreciate it dsfjdk,bvgh
yeeyee so im not. perfectly happy w all the phrasing in this one. but i figured i should probably work on it again considering the last chap was almost 3 weeks ago dvfhag
Cas blushed again, then held up a finger to signal Dean should wait a second before ducking out of the doorway only to return holding a tray.
theres actually a scene and a bit that fits in between this drabble and the last for this au, but it follows the episode so y'all can put the pieces together yourselves lol. I'm trying to toe the line of putting enough info in that this all flows and not completely rehashing what happens in the show, but i have no clue if I'm succeeding or not lol
“Fuck, I sure hope he does,” he said, wry grin on his face, then he turned to pull Cas in for a proper kiss. “Happy birthday, love.”
open his eyes, a fond grin on his lips, he feels almost bowled over by the amount of love he can see in Cas’ eyes. Even after all these years, he can’t quite believe he’s lucky enough to have this, to have
It was almost better this way, honestly. They’d decided to take advantage of the weather to walk hand in hand through their town, nodding warmly at other couples and families they passed on the way, and no visitors later meant no one they had to be home to greet.
so i've done barely any work on this fic outside of whats posted, so imma just continue writing it as one of the aus I'm writing for this. posting it separately is more to draw in people who don't read drabble comps, lmao, so I'm gonna stop worrying abt having the majority of it already posted in here as it won't decrease traffic
have an early update today! im tryna see if shifting my writing time to before dinner on days where its an option will be a better mental health vibe for me bc i have more energy and am thus less concerned abt the quality etc
He knew he wasn’t imagining the way Cas’ voice was slightly choked up as he continued speaking, as it matched the sudden wateriness of his own eyes.
They’re eating at a proper restaurant together, for once, rather than just going to the closest diner to their motel. It’s probably slightly antithetical to the whole ‘road-trip’ thing to most people, but they’re not exactly ‘most people’. They’ve spent years eating out of shitty diners for 90% of their meals while on hunts— going somewhere without sticky red pleather seats is a luxury that they’ve decided to allow themselves for once.
couldn't write b4 dinner today and BOY i do not like it shflsjk truly I had two days of it being better and I wanna keep that up where possible <3
But Cas had met his worries with a calm smile, and he knew that he wouldn’t be pushed any further than absolutely necessary while Cas tried to coach him through this.
the human, after all, it stands to reason that you would be more proficient in these matters than I.”
He said it simply, like it explained everything, and in some ways it did. Dean smiled down at him softly, leant in to leave a lingering kiss against his slightly sweaty forehead, then pulled back slowly.
Dean held back a groan of annoyance when he saw he’d been sent an email about his most recent assignment from Professor Azazel. He’d had to sit through classes with the man for the past year and a half, and something about the man had seemed
“Other than the case we had a month and a half ago, I haven’t even been near any. I already checked for hex bags.”
Cas’ eyes snapped to meet Dean’s fully, widened slightly in surprise and interest, and Dean felt his grin turn into a smirk.
god my life is boring rn i have nothing to say in these notes fkhjag,sdjk,,,, wheres a personal crisis when you need one, honestly 😔😔😔
When all is said and done, Dean spends some time thinking about Cas— their relationship, what he wants it to mean moving forwards, all the feelings he spent a full decade ignoring the existence of. He knows he should’ve done it earlier,
made him flush lightly, especially since they’d engaged in much more scandalous acts that very morning, but he guessed a decade of pretending he
“Jack! Dean’s soul has disappeared from Earth—” Cas froze, eyes locking onto Dean, his initial panic giving way to something very different in an instant.
Cas, who had seemingly collapsed onto the couch next to him, sighed before shifting to curl his body around Dean’s.
anyway have the prelude to them shouting at each other (probably) <3 (I keep trying to make this conversation aggressive and they aren't cooperating. maybe next time I'll successfully wrangle them, but given my track record probably not)
Dean’s face is still flushed slightly in embarrassment, but he manages to nod back with a grin, and Cas’ smile broadens.
Chaps 46-52, 73, 75, 107, 141, 177, 181, 195, 213— idk theyre doing mini golf now. this follows more directly from chap 195
all the doors were being guarded, two royal courts were currently occupying the castle) before he recognised the soldier and relaxed.
about everything. Dean had even asked him once, why he put up with it, why he didn’t ever get annoyed at Dean for pulling away, and Cas had met his eyes calmly.
i do think posting before dinner is better, although it feels a bit weird after so many months of writing in the late evening lol. I've been going through a low motivation period, probably bc I'm not meeting my social needs for a variety of reasons, and because of that, writing after dinner means that I just. put off writing in favour of reading fic (which brings more immediate serotonin/dopamine) till it gets to the last minute, meaning the quality is down bc I'm tired and that I then stay up later than I otherwise would. like, last night I slept earlier than I've been posting lately lol
this was a weird one to write because I've been reading prison fics today (idk i was just in the Mood™) and like. they have a
Cas had on his best thoughtful expression, and Dean had to stifle a grin when he seriously nodded in response.
so this is definitely pulled from the fact that I've been in a bit of a depressive period lately but today i like. actually got things done on my own merit when left alone. granted one of those things was making dinner and mum would've been mad if i hadn't b u t i also baked (box but still) brownies and cleaned the toilet. baby steps :)
it, not really. He still occasionally felt a tiny twinge of guilt over Cas’ humanity, but they’d had that conversation years ago now, and he knew Cas was happier now than he’d ever been as an angel.
“I’m just going to empty my bladder, angel, don’t worry,” he said, the lie coming easily as he knew Cas would slip back into a deeper sleep before it could register as one.
And sometimes he said nothing at all, just staring wide-eyed at Dean as he flailed and made awkward noises before beating a hasty retreat, worried he’d do something he couldn’t take back, like pulling Cas close and kissing the tear tracks away.
and don’t think playing dumb with me is gonna get you out of trouble for not mentioning it to me before now! What was with ocean eyes at the shop this afternoon?”
i continue to be thinking abt names and i keep going back to ember but like. idk if it’s a good name for
Guilt would get him nowhere, however, and Cas knew why he had to go in, so he settled himself by cleaning up the toast and boiling another mug of water to make Cas some fresh tea. He stayed as quiet as possible, wanting to let Cas sleep as long as he needed, but was met with a pair of blinking blue eyes when he walked back into the living room.
“My apologies, Dean. I did not intend to make you anxious by calling you in the middle of the school day. If I may confess, I’d forgotten you’d be in class when I rang.”
it, that I’m enough on my own and all of that hippy crap you and Sammy force on me constantly, a part of me still craves the feeling that I’ve made him proud, that he cares about me. And the idea that I wouldn’t get it because of shit as basic as me fucking. Embracing that dudes are just as hot as women at times screws with my head.”
falling asleep. That plan of action was significantly harder when you had an ex-angel’s arms wrapped tightly around you, especially when you didn’t exactly want to wake said ex-angel up with your restlessness.
He just hoped Sammy wouldn’t murder him when they got back to the bunker and he inevitably demonstrated that love and excitement at every available moment.
we love still having 0 developments in the friendship issue, its so much fun knowing that ur relationship with ur previously closest friend is being potentially irreversibly damaged and having no clue how much it will be in the end (or if the friendship will even
yeah i hope y'all don't hate soulmate aus or something bc with two of these, i imagine they'll take over this drabble collection for a little while ,zjxvbh,dfm
“I know I don’t know mine yet, not in person, but I couldn’t imagine life without her,” he’d explained, as boundlessly enthusiastic about the topic as any 16-year-old was, and Dean had snorted.
certainly isn’t capable of working while being entertained by you. At all. I’m honestly surprised he hasn’t been affected by a spell yet. Or accidentally inflicted one on you.”
Part of that probably went back to how many years they’d spent unsure of themselves and their relationship. They’d spent so long pretending there was nothing between them, that their bond was profound but not in
but he’d have thought Dean would be back by now, Castiel in tow. His phone dinged as he was idly contemplating the ritual components that were still lying on the table in front of him, and he checked after reminding himself that staying here and doing nothing wasn’t going to change the outcomes for Cas and Dean.
they got Cas back, so that when they yoinked him out of the Empty Dean would have a solid idea of how to approach it all.
and as he stared up at the ceiling of the dilapidated barn, he found a part of himself wondering if this was where it ended, for him.
thank god dodie exists because putting on her music is pretty much the only way to get me in a writing vibe when my brains bouncing around like a screensaver lol
He knew Cas could tell something was up. His husband had been staring quietly all day as they walked around town, concern obvious in his eyes, and Dean wasn’t surprised to find himself drawn into a hug as soon as they reached the comfort of their resort room.
“Ah, Charlie’s mentioned it a few times. I think she was trying to convince me to start listening to it on hunts. Something about gay wizards and tacos…?”
And things between them have been— not great, admittedly. For all that he wished he couldn’t see the similarities between some elements of their relationship and Michael and Lucifer's, sometimes there really was no arguing with fate. Things haven’t been good for a long time, not like it was when they were kids, and this whole shitstorm with the apocalypse was just shining a light on their fucked up family dynamics.
settled, that he’s in danger here, that all it would take was a blink for everything to disappear again.
so i started reading the eldest curses today (because why read the og series when u can read the concurrent/intermediate(?) sequel focusing on the two chars u actually care abt in canon s,frh,hsbi. I'm highkey thinking abt writing a shadowhunters x spn crossover but also idk what it would be about lmaoooo I'm not good at crossovers.
Dean had been napping comfortably on the beach with Cas’ fingers carding through his hair for about 20 minutes when his husband’s hands stopped rather abruptly.
meant the portion of his brain that constantly worried wouldn’t shut up. Making an executive decision, he glanced back up at the class again to see most of his students looking curiously up at him.
wasn't expecting to add to this verse again so soon if ever but I've already projected name feelings onto Cas for my genderfluidity verse so.
need help from Sammy and any lawyerly connections he’d managed to make through his time in college so far, as few as they may be, but it suddenly seemed a fucktonne more likely than it had before the meeting.
sort of movement to indicate he was more awake than his close eyes would suggest, because his hand was released and he heard footsteps as a nurse bustled in. Dean opened his eyes when he was prompted, and was only slightly disappointed to see the chair beside his bed was vacant. Sam would be back later, he was sure.
I saw friends again today, sorted out some ID stuff, and also might be joining an idol group so that's cool.
extravagant for the day, well aware that Cas didn’t want that, but no good birthday started without breakfast in bed.
But for now, Dean wanted to surround himself with his husband and forget about the world and all its practicalities for a while longer, to remind himself that the future didn't matter, not when he had and would
thing to do. A way for their more feeble minds to process the events they experienced on a day to day basis and categorise them as needed. For an
out,’ Dean hadn’t protested as much as he probably should have. They might’ve stopped the world from ending multiple different ways now, but the work was never truly finished, and some small part of him would always rankle at the thought of leaving Sam in the bunker to research cases alone.
Their relationship was made up of little moments like that, of small smiles and I-just-thought-you-might-appreciate-it-gifts and plates pushed at each other towards the end of meals. They’d spent so long denying things, denying the significance of their bond even while knowing ‘profound’ didn’t nearly cover how much they cared about each other, and now that they
Rather than walking back to Dean, Cas had decided to lean against the counter space next to the coffee machine while cradling his mug in his hands, and Dean took the opportunity to admire his face in the early morning light. A few silent minutes passed that way, with the two of them quietly staring at each other, but it didn’t take long for Cas to gently place his mug back down on the bench in a clearly inviting manner.
They’d been technically together for just under a year now, and he’d known Cas loved him for longer than that, but voicing sentiments like that still felt new enough that they bowled him over almost every time. He sent Cas a warm smile when he had verified all the food was still doing ok, and found Cas was looking at him with a fond smile playing at his lips over the coffee mug.
“No, you know what I’m talking about, brother, even if you don’t wanna admit it. What’s the deal with blue eyes anyway? He not into guys?”
Castiel remained silent for a few moments, studying Dean intensely. He would’ve felt unnerved by the stare if he hadn’t already spent years on the end of it. Instead, he just felt
The only downside to permanently sharing a bed with someone, Dean had found, was that he had much less idea of what to do on the nights where he couldn’t sleep.
The nurse who had been providing them with updates about Dean’s condition had privately admitted to him she found it adorable, then was very surprised when her question of how long they’d been together had turned Sam’s expression haunted as he desperately whispered,
i feel kinda bad bc i know i have quite a few comments I haven't responded to but my vibes have been whack this week and I like responding to y'all when I'm in a slightly better headspace if possible. hopefully I'll respond to them tomorrow but just so y'all know I Am reading them and I Do appreciate them very much
giving myself a deadline helped a lot!! I've always shied away from them in the past, not trusting my creative muse to keep up, but i think if in future I work to make said deadlines centred around things I'm really passionate abt writing, it may be useful for me effectively writing more long-form fics. this drabble fic has proven that I
“Cas!” Dean exclaimed, caught in a half turn away from the stove. “You were supposed to stay in bed!”
soulmate marks (chaps 76, 77)— sometimes u gotta panic to ur soulmates brother for a little while b4 u do anything about everything
I'm broken-hearted today,,,,, can't believe they're successfully breaking up my favourite ship of ever given/the suez canal 💔💔💔💔
improvement on the rare physical affection they’d allowed themselves before getting their shit together.
this is most definitely the most angsty of these I’ve written? like it's not the most angsty thing in the world but maybe skip this one if transphobia (esp from a parent) will be a bad vibe
Somehow, even knowing what he did about Cas’ feelings, Dean was absolutely friggin’ terrified at the idea of confessing his
anything. Cas hadn’t opened the presents Dean had left wrapped on their kitchen table yet anyway, and Dean suspected he didn’t want to inadvertently try and buy something Dean had already gotten him.
the concept is this: me + a group of fellow writers all choose a fandom (i have a mental list of ones that i feel fit the vibe). we then cowrite a story in which ~2 chars from each of our chosen fandoms attend a dinner party hosted by Hannibal Lector. that's it that's the fic FRKSDJHSHA
Cas contemplated the question for a second before turning in his spot on the bed to present his wings to Dean.
But there were always going to be those people who stubbornly ignored the obvious, too attached to their own preconceptions about the world to consider any other possibilities.
want a hug from the very hot angel he considered his best friend was bound to fuck up his internal wiring somewhat. Still, he found himself standing up and moving closer towards Cas when the angel himself got up from his seat, and he saw a glimmer of a smile cross Castiel’s face right before warm arms wrapped around him.
“Well, Cas— Do angels have soulmates? Because that sounds a hell of a lot like the dreams I had in the meetup to meeting Jess for the first time.”
“I— Just not until we’ve worked out what’s happening? It’s not like he particularly enjoys research,” Cas pointed out, but Sam continued staring at him in disbelief.
“I’m sorry, Dean. I did not sleep as well last night as I would have hoped, and I am unused to feeling so tired at this point of the day.”
“And you usually get here later,” Cas pointed out dryly, a faint smile on his face. Dean flushed slightly, but didn’t move, and Cas sighed. “I have been better,” he admitted. “This week was… Difficult.”
for them, just for Dean, just to see his smile and feel his joy in the arms that he threw around the angel and the press of their lips together (and oh had their lips pressed together… Sam was lucky enough to not be in the room for
(He just doesn’t know if that lifeline is the idea that he still doesn’t have a soulmate, despite everything, or the idea that he
“I had intended to bring this topic up in a… very different manner,” he said, and Dean glanced up, confused.
i project my mental health doing down the drain for no reason on fictional characters: castiel edition
Sam could apparently see the moment Dean flipped back from nervous anticipation to resigned acceptance, because his face softened.
also i actually wrote more of this today bc i rewatched lazarus rising while writing but it was more than i wanted to post as one chap so guess we'll see how that goes. might be a similar situation to all i do is dream of you where i finish it and post it without it being the daily drabble for the day i post it (bc like, we getting close lmaooo i just have to decide how i wanna handle stuff + given we're literally in canon episode territory now i don't wanna go through all of season 4 steadily making it more gay when yall can do that in ur heads you know??)
Cas cocked his head, the very picture of innocent confusion, but the glimmer in his eyes told Dean he knew exactly what he was doing.
there was a moment where I almost rejoined supernatural because I was reading through my bookmarks tagged w ‘fluff’ and ‘established relationship’ bc I’m a basic bitch when I’m not doing well and I read a destiel fic and was sad when I didn’t have much w those specific tags that weren’t part of a series bUT rather than going looking for more I continued scrolling through my bookmarks and found the parley/parkner/whatever ship name u prefer section and was like ‘oh this is bringing all the serotonin actually’. sometimes u just need to read a dozen field trip fics and Twitter fics ok. but also if my vibes continue being rancid I may switch fandoms again this week because that’s how my brain provides the good chemicals. like I literally made it 5 days in fb and like maybe 3 days in my brief dip back into hannibal.
He still believed what he’d said that first night. Unlike his year with Lisa and Ben, he had no doubts about what would happen when it inevitably did— Cas would stay, with him, support him through it while they ganked whatever they needed to in order to hold on to their stability. Gone were the days of Cas disappearing in a flutter of wings— they had each other,
mean to use it just yet. I figured a certain degree of familiarity was probably fine, given we’re literally married, but I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable. I can just call you Castiel, if you’d prefer?”
its whack bc I'm not very sporty but I almost was. when I was in prep I did auskick (which is weekend program in aus to get primary school kids into aussie rules football) but I quit after a year bc I was the only girl and I got teased by the boys for not having a footy jumper and being a girl in footy etc, instead choosing to focus on dance. but like. I'm much more built for footy/rugby than I am dance. i don't regret choosing dance, I've never felt like professional sports is something I wanted out of life and who tf knows if I would've actually been any good and stayed enjoying it if I hadn't been teased, but like. tis strange to think abt. when I was 12 my mum tried to convince me to pick up rugby bc I was having trouble with my classmates in dance and it was already obvious I had the build of it, but by that stage I already disliked that sort of sport after having avoided it so much for years. who knows what could've been/what i would've been like if I had stuck with footy,,,,,,
well who had been sitting at his bedside earlier and was waiting for Cas to come in in preparation for them to
It’s heating up in Aus and I’m so excited I fucking LOVE summer/warm weather and it was weirdly non existent in the 2020-2021 season?
best friend in person either tomorrow/the day after so if that goes ahead that'll also help. it can only go up from here lol
“Hey! Credit card fraud ain’t easy, you know!” Dean winked, and dramatically swaggered across the room to meet Cas in the doorway. “That’s
He’s even less surprised to find the other side of their bed empty, residual warmth indicating to him that Cas had only recently slipped off. He knew that Cas would probably be feeling slightly out of sorts, even with the joy and relief that
Dean stared at him silently for another moment, and Castiel fought the urge to squirm under his scrutiny. Is this how Dean usually felt, when he gave in to his urge to watch the other man? If so, Cas could understand his protests more.
This could be seen as related to chap 69  but was mostly bc I paint my nails as a grounding tactic sometimes lol— Dean sometimes needs a hand getting out of his own head
i'm happy to say i officially finished writing the fix it last night, a full month and a bit before I'm planning on posting it dgfzjshj. it's amazing what three days worth of intent writing will get you!!!
oh also i finally googled how to get em dashes in word so i might actually start using them lmaooooooo imagine me adhering to actual grammar conventions sdlzfgvjg
“It’s fine, I get why you’re coming to me about it rather than Dean. It’s not something he really talks about freely. But seriously, this is good news. For one thing, it means that you ditching heaven was
being back at uni today was interesting— i have a class with my friend this sem and that was today so that was a good mental health vibe
Later, when Dean was thinking back on the incident, he tried to think of anything he could’ve done to handle the situation differently.
When Castiel first started having the dreams, the primary emotion he felt was probably best labelled as confusion.
It took Dean a while to truly realise the damage John Winchester had had on his whole mental… situation.
i remembered that halloween being a Big Deal in America meant that Halloween drabbles outside of my planned one (aka one written and posted on the day) would probably not go awry fhzdbjsn. it's becoming bigger here but mostly bc capitalism and also the americanisation of media— while i've worn costumes for school free-dress days, i've literally never been trick or treating before. i was invited once but my mum said no bc she was worried abt safety, didn't want me to come home with a shittonne of lollies (i probably wouldn't have a lot of houses don't even bother having any), and also was like. annoyed that American culture & traditions has become so common here gjkrdfsb. last year we had the most trick or treating groups we've ever had (which compared to the grand total of, uh, 0 we had in 2018, isn't exactly hard) and we'd exited a 112 day lockdown literally 5 days prior (the longest continuous one in the world at that stage (and possibly still currently)!!! what joy!!!! but also it worked really fucking well at the time, we had a glorious period of 0 cases, then international and interstate travellers fucked us over again)
similarities to our universe, but I can’t think of any groups that are rocking tattoos like all of you guys are. Back home, we’re hunters.”
“Yeah, but we were up multiple nights hunting this week. We both have some sleep to catch up on, especially since another case has already come through.”
“Dean, I know you hate this kind of work. And I get it, I really do. But we need to get through these storage rooms before we can properly set this place up for travelling hunters, and that means all hands on deck, so stop distracting Cas before I have to separate you two entirely.”
“It’s fine, angel, I know you wouldn’t have called if it wasn’t important. My kids will be fine without me for a few minutes. What’s up?”
It was obvious that they needed a different plan of attack. Jack had tried calling Cas to him, annoyed that he hadn’t thought to somehow prevent the angel from leaving that first time, but at least Dean now had visual confirmation that he was out. That he was
cont in chaps 20, 62, 64, 67, 72, 79, 102, 118, 136, 159, as well as the full work being linked in the endnotes of this chap & all the continuing chapters
His views on happiness may have changed fairly drastically over the years, with both the more he saw of the world and the further he was able to develop from his father's black-and-white influence working together to tell him that it was okay to want a life outside of hunting, and for that life to be with a man (or man-shaped being)— but that didn’t change his heartfelt belief that this was as good as it got. If further down the line he got proven wrong, he wasn’t gonna
Cas flushed, and Dean instinctively reached to brush a hand across the line of red on Cas’ cheek. It darkened in response, and he found his hand lingering to cup his face rather than pulling away as Cas begun to speak.
They both made affirming noises and gestures before wandering off to find their room, following their room key when they realised that she’d never actually clarified their booking for them outside of checking Dean’s name against their records. It shouldn’t matter, and he’s not expecting it to as they enter their room, but he finds himself stopping short and raising his eyebrow when he sees
now, had committed to spending the rest of his life with Castiel, for worse or for better. They hadn’t even had a chance to talk yet, not since exchanging their vows, as every visiting dignitary seemed determined to give them separate blessings for the union. He’d caught Castiel’s eyes across the ballroom a few times, seen that he was more visibly off-balance from being thrown into the midst of what seemed to every noble-person in
My computers fucking broken in some way and I’m potentially watching what I considered to be my closest friendship literally crumble into pieces in front of my eyes, but BOY HOWDY GOOD OMENS SURE IS GETTING A SEASON 2
that, soulmates in general are amazing. When I first realised me and Jess matched, a month or so after we first met... everything just clicked into place, you know?”
and as he stared up at the ceiling of the dilapidated barn, he found a part of himself wondering if this was where it ended, for him.
one of them and this is my coping mechanism. ignore how short it is lmao it fits the criteria (aka is 100+ words fkxjdh)
chaps 7, 101, 109, 161, 214, 232— you thought they'd stop talking now that grooming is happening?? hahahahahah
“Nah, it’s fine. All else fails, I can make the pie tomorrow instead,” he said, waving his hand dismissively, and Cas beamed at him.
And that was part of what made him scared. Because on one hand, he got it— Cas wasn’t exactly looking to get rejected, not after being pulled out of what he’d been sure was certain death, and he hadn’t been able to imagine a world in which Dean loved him the same way he loved Dean.
“Now that I’m acquainted with the person I’m helping snatch and sell my father’s cadaver, I figure we can get to work? Just. Tell me how to help.”
i tried to find a balance between readable and looking sufficiently glitched but idk if i managed lol the generator u used didn't go up in particularly small incriments
anyway this chap is a challenge to me to write a kiss scene that's more detailed than "their lips press together briefly" or
writing off some of the myths he previously would’ve felt sure were dreamed up by humans for various reasons — there were many that had a kernel of truth in them. Especially the ones that replicated across cultures. And even for those that weren’t
“It’s possible he decided helping Jack fix up Heaven was more immediately important,” Bobby pointed out. “No one was really expecting you to die just yet, idjit.”
Dean had expected Sam to be when he figured out what Dean had done to save him. He just hadn’t expected
However it had been decided, Dean wasn’t going to complain. He doubted he’d have been able to walk as elegantly as Castiel seemed to be, the years of court training never fully getting rid of the gait his bowed legs gave him.
But it didn’t stop the mix of nerves and excitement he felt when he woke up on the morning of Jack’s first birthday.
The spell didn’t fall through. Dean wasn’t fully up to date on how exactly the mechanics of it all worked, but he didn’t really
true, sometimes the believing was enough— usually when ‘helped’ along by another creature or witch of some sort.
“You know I did, given I’d started complaining about it before you even left the room,” Cas grumbled, and Dean laughed.
also alec has blue eyes in this simply bc i think dean and magnus silently competing over who's partner has prettier eyes is funny, but their heights are pulled from show canon (with magnus being shorter than alec). i just think magnus should have to go on his tiptoes to kiss his husband sometimes okay <3. this mix of show lore and book lore is probably gonna be evident in a few other things as well, but the overall storyline is gonna stick with the show's canon.
“Although Nephilim exist in our world as well, they are the direct result of a human and an angel conceiving. Our angelic systems are likely quite different as well.”
He probably should’ve listened when Sammy said that it was too dangerous to take on cases as occasionally as he had been, but he’d never been good at doing things that were good for his health. And he’d figured that even if he was now more out of practice than not, his ‘out of practice’ was better than most hunters.
of people assuming he and Cas were just friends, tired of wondering if he was somehow subconsciously hiding their relationship even in moments where he felt comfortable being open.
So, Dean thinks about it. He goes on another unsuccessful date and Angel Radio, this time with someone who seemed unengaged with him from the start, then matches with a guy named Benny. This time, when organising their first date, he asks Benny where he’d like to go, and they end up at a place that reminds him of the Roadhouse.
people that liked to ignore the obvious implications of Dean and Cas’ relationship, as has already been established. And people like Susan may have more commonly worked to ignore the (fairly obvious) signs that they were more than just friends, but they weren’t the only ones who seemed to be almost
A small smile rose to Dean’s face, unbidden, and he slipped his hand down Cas’ arm to clasp his hand gently.
“Do you want to do the whole process, starting with calling the broom to your hand and everything, or do you just want me to worry about all of that?”
This was usually a signal that they were slated to meet their soulmate soon. Not immediately, not even necessarily in the next few months, but soon enough that fate kicked into high gear to say ‘Hey. Remember this person. Reach out to them when you meet in person.’
The bed was empty, albeit unmade, so he moved on, figuring he’d probably migrated to the living room after growing bored lying alone in bed. Sure enough, he heard the low murmur of the Discovery Channel as he continued down the hall, and found Cas’ head sticking out of a lump of blankets on the couch. He had an empty mug of herbal tea and a plate of half-eaten toast on the coffee table, so Dean was reassured that he’d managed okay enough on his own for the day, but he still felt a pang of guilt at not staying home to take care of him.
They’d gone through so goddamn much to be together the way they were now, and Dean wanted everyone around him to know that he’d managed to con someone as amazing as Castiel to dedicating the rest of his existence with his dumb ass.
(They don’t know it yet, but 6 years later they find out. Jess’ life goes out in a fiery blaze, her meticulous handwriting fades from Sam’s skin, and Sam
“Yeah, the afternoon rush can be insane,” Dean explained. “It’s because of how close we are to both the local high school and the college campus— people swing by after their classes to get a pick-me-up. Any reason you’re out in particular?”
Castiel honestly didn’t know which possibility would be more devastating to him, and he wasn’t exactly looking to find out. So silence it was.
travellers are warned off spending too much time in these woods, after all. It’s just that before this, he’d managed to get himself
trying to appear as heterosexual as possible and thus didn’t know how to react when those assumptions were still made about him now that he had said ‘fuck it’ and kicked down the closet door — didn’t know how to make it clear it wasn’t a reflection of them or their relationship.
“No, I mean— earlier. When I was waking up, and you were doing a dramatic grieving widow thing and clutching my hand desperately. You left before I could open my eyes.”
“The stall was being manned by a youngish child when I went,” Cas admitted. “His mother was out back, I believe, but he was very eager to make a sale without being watched over.”
“Woah there, Sammy, who said anything about ‘finally’? How do you know this isn’t something I’ve just figured out about myself?”
as such i was stressed when i was writing this so don't expect it to be good lol. i have no clue why I'm so attached to this au lmaoooooo
stupid. All the possibly cursed objects hoarded away in here will not make contact with anyone’s skin. Also, I’m honestly convinced this is just a stick that just ended up in one of the supply boxes.”
also i wanted to give this verse a punny name based on worms/teeth but i could not think of one so ig this is just gonna be 'an important case' till i come up with something better
“At least she seems to be accepting if he is,” he says and they both contemplate the struggles Dean had gone through to accept this side of himself before continuing their conversation.
“Anyway, I have a solution that I think you will find is both much more effective than buying hand warmers. We can just hold hands! It’s free, and I run warm.”
Had a good day at uni today!! I saw my friend and offered her an ear bc shits going down within her family, and I talked to some folks in my second seminar (although unfortunately it's the one that happens fortnightly and as such I won't see any of them that regularly to see if we gel beyond general seminar buddy vibes 😔)
don’t seem like the type of man I’d expect to find in a museum,” she said, coy look on her face, and he sent her an awkward smile in response.
this is once again a mess but eh beach vibes are good. i didn’t even write about them actually at the beach but the attempt was made. im very tired
just so yall know, this may or may not be the last piece of this au that i post directly in this drabble fic. i say 'may or may not be' bc idk how things will progress, and I may end up giving y'all a snippet of later sections at some point if no other aus are coming to me, but i have Plans and those plans involve Cliffhangers alongside Specific Posting Dates. i just wanted to forewarn yall so you wouldn't be confused about Where It Went— I'm still gonna be working on it, I'm literally so fucking excited about completing it, but i wanna do the rest of it justice and i feel it's gonna be best served to be experienced all at once.
, even if it didn’t remove the sting completely. The similarity meant that his brain could ignore the second half of the name, tell himself that he was being referred to the way he wanted to be. It wasn’t perfect, and was really friggin’ depressing to think about for any longer than needed, but also? Sometimes lying to himself was enough.
“Now, Claire, you know perfectly well why that rule doesn’t apply to us teachers the same way it does to you guys. We’re generally on top of things enough to know when it is and isn’t okay to be checking our phones.”
He could do this. He could get through one interaction with a hot guy without seeming like a massive creeper or the disaster bi he truly was. He did it with hot girls all the time.
In response, Dean shook his head ruefully while flipping his mute button across, tamping down the instinctive feelings of worry. Claire most
Tension Dean hadn’t even realised he was holding bled out of his form, and he grinned as he finished affixing a gauze to Cas’ arm.
He doesn’t know how. Call it years of his instincts being honed carefully by hunting, teaching him to take note of that prickle when it appeared at the back of his neck.
who, last he heard, was living practically on the other side of the country, but he still wasn’t a morning person). Dean simply chuckled once again.
i feel like every time I write for this au i'm experiencing vastly different vibes lol hopefully it flows properly
Dean no longer worried Castiel would leave at any moment, off to hunt on his own or to deal with his ex-brethren or whatever other reasons he’d had in the past. And Castiel no longer worried about whether or not he truly belonged with the Winchesters, about having to find a new place and new people eventually.
)— that's right, our main gal ever given is now the star of some of my quality writing. it lead to some funny conversational moments including me genuinely asking one best friend what pronouns she thought the suez canal would use and my
Cas is standing in front of him, their son is cradled in his arms, and they’re both peering at this tiny human they’re both now wholly responsible for taking care of. And they’ve
Something visibly broke in Dean at Sam’s words. He didn’t cry, he wasn’t exactly the type, but the careful blankness that had overtaken his expression was gone. He slumped back down into his seat without making a noise, and Sam let the silence hang.
Dean lost his trail of thought when he glanced up at the man who had caught him and found himself peering into impossibly blue eyes. The other man was staring down at him inquisitively, and Dean found himself flushing despite himself.
As he settled onto the broom behind Cas, Dean made an effort to not obviously tense up. He trusted Cas, he
“Come on, we both know very well that you aren’t working for any sheriffs office. I’m mostly just curious about how much you’ll get for him.”
Technically this counted as a free upgrade, Dean figured, so they may as well just take it without thinking too hard about the ‘why’.
when he didn’t have to worry about any bedpartners on his insomniac nights, but he didn’t mind having to form new routines.
Dean settled on the sofa next to Cas to peer at what he was talking about, then he huffed out a laugh.
But to have a completely static and unchanging name the way that he did, especially one that was longer than a syllable??
honeymoon vibes as its the only way imma get a full fic lol (chaps 46-52 if u wanna reread them all, but its specifically a continuation of chap 51 and I'd recommend rereading that one as this references specific dialogue from it lol. I'll get them in the actual water one of these days, i swear)
also u can tell I've shifted more into my 'writing for IT' style because I've started capitalising certain words unnecessarily which is something I do when projecting onto Richie while writing lmaoooooooooooo. hopefully it doesn't seem to outta place for Dean's pov.
i finished and submitted the second assignment I've been talking abt. now just one next week and another the week after then a lil break in things being due again, hopefully my brain functions better next week as a result bc I've got through some of the stress! :)
still, despite all the shit they’ve put him through since he fell. He gets excited about the unimportant things that humanity comes with, he watches the Discovery Channel whenever they’re in a motel with a television, he grins so brightly at Dean when they go to a new diner. This is the angel that fell in love with humanity and developed free will to defend it, and that fact shines through no matter where they are in the country.
in more amusing vibes my best friend was sending me tipsy messages this evening bc her mum bought her wine to celebrate getting through the first semester of uni (its been a Stressful Time. also legally we are both old enough to drink lmao no underage shenanigans are going on here)
“I didn’t mean to get so much shit,” he said, “But I kept seeing stuff I figured people we know would appreciate, and…”
“So, I just use my fingers? Also, should we grab a towel or something? I don’t want you to be left with a wet bed tonight. I mean, I know you don’t
“I suppose my book can wait until tomorrow,” Cas finally acquiesced, and Dean grinned before leaning in for a proper kiss.
“In one of the towns, some of the rumours definitely made it back to him. He, well, he asked me if I knew anything. Apparently someone saw you kissing a guy out behind the general store.”
Benny’s near daily reminders. He was a coward and a bi-disaster who could be as suave as the next motherfucker when it came to chatting up chicks but became a flustered, stammering mess whenever a hot guy so much as
It wasn’t that he hadn’t trusted what Bobby and Jack were telling him, but being told something and seeing it for yourself were very different things.
Cas made a considering noise, sinking into Dean’s hold as he read through their options, before coming to a decision.
also this is exactly 100 words because it was vibes based not ideas based and i wanted to challenge myself. it
The first time Dean accidentally cut himself after everything, Cas instinctively found himself reaching to run his thumb over the back of his hand. And when the small line of blood stayed present on Dean’s finger, Cas couldn’t help the tension that entered his shoulders.
Cas glanced down, feeling even more awkward than he had at the idea of broaching this topic to begin with
, he’d had fun so far, getting tipsy with everyone and winking at the girls (and one guy) that had hopefully hit on him before informing them he was an almost-married man and they’d better go looking elsewhere.
Chaps 121, 124, 132, 149, 154, 171— wot is this? an actual conversation??? also deans making other peoples drinks while making cas' still dw lol is it Realistic maybe not but its Happening so
so my friend is doing biomed at uni and was curious about whether or not she'll get to see a cadaver and i made a joke about how even if she doesn't do it in her course, grave-robbery exists. then i immediately thought of both spn and resurrection men because those are the two things i associate with grave robbery. and thus this was born. ignore any horrible historical inaccuracies i was mostly vibing and basing this off what I remembered from the sawbones eps on it. also this is probs slightly ooc but,,,,,
It was not the most effective grooming technique, admittedly, being more akin to petting than anything else, but it seemed to loosen Cas up just fine. When Dean felt Cas was relaxed enough, he dropped a kiss on the nearest bit of wing, then dug his fingers in more firmly.
“Oh, baby,” Mary cooed and cupped Sam’s cheek. “We weren’t upset you didn’t tell us, not really, we were upset you were hiding something that was hurting you so much. You hid it and we couldn’t do anything to help but we knew you were going through something awful.”
“What are you two idjits doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be halfway to Wyoming by now?” Bobby asked as he joined them at the table.
Not soon enough, Sam and John were both asleep in separate beds, leaving Dean to the couch, which was all right with him. It meant he was able to sneak out without the two of him noticing. He made sure he was as quiet as possible as he closed the motel room door behind him and climbed in the Impala, turning on the engine with a wince as it roared to life but he seemed to be lucky as neither his brother nor father came to inspect what was going on. With the knowledge that he was successfully sneaking away, Dean pulled out of the parking lot and drove through the small town until he found a bar that was still open.
“Hey,” Dean said with a little salute. “Think I’m getting better at figuring out if you’re about to drop in.”
“Neither could I, babe. I’m 29, and I’ve somehow got three teenage kids now,” Dean said with a laugh. “Didn’t know if I would ever even have any and now I’ve got a fucking pack. We have a pack.”
“Uh, not really,” she panted, leaning her head back against the headrest. “I’m down in Joplin, there was a werewolf. I killed it, but it got a good swipe at me first.”
After successfully getting past the receptionist by impersonating Mrs. Huntington’s grandsons, the three of them began sneaking around the different hallways. “How in the world are we going to figure out which of these doctors is him?”
“Alright, let’s make a deal. If you can get up and walk to the bathroom, I’ll let you drive,” Dean said with a short nod before moving back, giving her room to stand. Claire took a deep breath and hauled herself up and out of the car. That was when she finally saw Cas standing only a few feet away, looking worried as all get out.
“That’s not something we need to worry about at this moment. We need to get you into some clothes and get you some food,” he said with a tight smile. “And there are some more people that you will need to meet.”
A few days after John’s death, the brothers decided to pay a visit to Bobby, both to explain the situation, and to get some comfort from the only real father figure they’d had.
Sam, Dean, and Cas had successfully taken out the pack of werewolves with little fanfare, but it was late enough that they would need to stay the night before heading home to the bunker. Sam was out getting them dinner at a local diner, leaving Cas and Dean at the motel. Dean was in the shower when Cas’ phone rang with a call from Jack.
“I think I found him,” Sam said after a few moments, pointing to one of the monitors. It was one of the resident’s rooms, a single doctor with them.
“I’m good, I’m fine,” Claire panted, sitting back against the headboard. “So...they’re home?” Kaia nodded. “Suppose I should face the music, huh?”
“How can I say no to that?” Dean said and followed Karen back into the kitchen, as if he wouldn’t stay just to spend time with her. Growing up, Karen had been like a second mother to Sam and Dean, often watching them while Mary and Bobby worked a case or helped another hunter research their own.
“You want me to call Mom and fill her in or wait until we get home?” Sam asked, already pulling out his phone. Dean checked the time on the dash.
Without another word, the woman ran off, one hand pressed to the wound on her neck, the other furiously dialing on her cell phone.
“Thank you for this Dean,” Castiel smiled warmly, tucking the tape into the inside pocket of his trenchcoat where it lay over the chair he draped it on earlier. “I look forward to having the chance to listen to what you consider to be the greatest music of all time.”
“Jack?” She called as she walked down the hall toward the kitchen, frowning when she heard a beeping. She quickened her pace and when she walked into the kitchen she saw her phone sitting on the counter, alarm going off for the cakes. “Shit!” she gasped and rushed to pull the cakes out of the oven, dropping them on the counter. They were dark, much darker than they should be, and very heavy. She shut the oven and poked at one of the cakes, wincing at how dry it felt.
After finishing his business, he stepped outside and froze when two people were standing a few feet outside the door, staring at him. “Didn’t realize there was a line, fellas, sorry about that,” he joked, breath hitching when their eyes flashed black.
Several of the deities nodded at that and began murmuring among themselves. “What do we do?” Dean hissed to Sam.
“His actual actions and location are hidden from us, but we do know that wherever he goes, he leaves a pile of bodies and broken seals,” Castiel explained.
“Oh uh - I, I’m sorry. I was going to pay for these, I just -” Sam stuttered out, tripping over his words.
It was nearly a month before they got a lead on the next horseman, largely because tracking illness, hunger and death was a monumental task.
“We need to figure out why this is happening,” Mary said. “If this all just individual demons or if someone is orchestrating all of this.”
“What the hell are you? Sam is dead, he’s been dead for 4 months. That poor family has been through enough, and
“Troy, and sure, we can talk about it. Nothing I say can make anything any worse,” the teacher and definitely not demon, thankfully - Troy - replied.
“We were sitting in the park and some crazy lady came up and started demanding that Jack come with her,” Kaia replied.
“You’re the reapers then?” Dean asked. One of them nodded. “Things are gonna go back to normal now? People dying when they’re supposed to?” They nodded again. “Good. Get out of here, we’ll clean this up.” The reapers didn’t need any more encouragement and disappeared from the room without a word.
“Yeah, actually, I do think I’m better than you. I think that you spent the last twenty years grieving over a woman without actually doing anything to move on. I think that instead of being a father you became a drill sergeant. And I think that we would have been better off if it was you that died in that fire instead of Mom,” Sam snarled and before Dean could mean, John’s fist met Sam’s jaw, knocking him into the wall with a grunt.
“See you soon, Cas,” Claire said and hung up, dropping her phone. She reached into the backseat, wincing at the strain on her leg, and grabbed her first aid kit. She cleaned the gash in her leg as well as she could and then wrapped bandages tightly around her thigh, slowly removing the tourniquet. She didn’t want to risk losing her entire leg due to a lack of blood flow. She threw everything over her shoulder into the back seat and then started the car, pulling onto the road.
He pulled a syringe of Dead Man’s Blood from the pocket of his trenchcoat, sinking it into John’s neck.
“Is that so?  That why you leave them here with me for weeks?  While you’re off god knows where living out some revenge fantasy?” Bobby yells.
“I can accompany you back to Sioux Falls,” Cas said, following Dean out to the car and sliding into the passenger seat. Dean sent Sam a smirk over the car. Once they were all in, Dean began driving the route out of town, stopping at a gas station.
Cas shook his head, “He likes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, he loves Star Wars… he listens to pop music. He doesn’t have any interest in dominating Heaven. He’s just a kid.”
Ignoring him, Cas reached forward and grabbed the back of Jack’s coat, pulling the nephilim towards him, before speaking in a low voice, “Jack can you hear angels nearby?”
Grabbing Cas by the jaw, Dean looked into Cas’ eyes for a second before leaning in to kiss him soundly.
“Shit, kid, what are those boots fucking made of?” he muttered as he rubbed at the spot where she made contact.
“Claire!” Cas spotted her first, rushing over to her side to help her to the couch. “You shouldn’t be out of bed, you need to rest and keep your weight off that leg.”
Dean woke up first as usual and he left Cas in bed, clinging to his pillow. He glanced into Claire’s room, frowning when she wasn’t asleep on her bed; Claire never woke up early if she could help it. Dean walked a bit faster down the hall, intent on checking the kitchen, but he walked past the open doorway of the rec room, he froze because there, on the couch, were Jack and Claire.
“I’m fine, but your dad…” Cas said, surveying the streets around him as he drove through town, “One of the vampires bled into his mouth. He ran off to kill it and get the blood for the cure but I can’t find him.”
“Of course we did!” Claire took Dean’s hand and tugged him into the library, pointing at the chair to sit. “Do you want to eat your cake or open presents first?”
Jo and Mary stared at him as he stood there silently, startled when they heard a fluttering sound behind them. “You prayed to me?” said a gruff voice, causing them all to turn, “Why? I was just down the hall.”
“We’re good and we’re all packed. You checked last night,” Claire said and grabbed a couple of granola bars from the pantry. “One of us will text when we get to Salina, okay? And when we kill the son of a bitch, and when we leave, and when we’re almost home? Sound good?”
“Are you okay?” he asked the woman that John had been feeding on, “Did his blood get in you at all?”
“We can’t take Paperclip to the shelter. We have bonded and it would hurt the both of us a lot to be away from one another,” he said confidently, just like Dean taught him.
“Angel,” Dean reached over and took Cas’ hand in his. “I know how you feel about what you did to the Novaks and Claire, but she understands the circumstances, we all do. Things were different then, you were different. And what her mom did was awful, but you had no control over that. What matters is that you’re here now.”
It was Dean’s turn to look shocked as he turned to Cas, “You… are you sure?” he asked, knowing how much his boyfriend hated his father.
“Right right, Jessica,” Famine pondered as he curled his hands over the armchairs of his wheelchair. “But that’s not who you desire is it? No, she’s not who you want. It’s the one that’s still down in the Pit, still suffering for eternity because you couldn’t keep one simple prom-” Sam lunged forward and cleanly sliced off three of Famine’s fingers - the ring on one of them - before any of the demons could take action.
Dean nodded toward a pile of clothes on the chair next to him, “I’m trying to see if I have any clothes that’ll fit him. We can also go into town sometime this week to get more supplies for him. Do you think he sleeps? We can set up a room for him either way.”
It was only a second before he was assaulted with holy water and salt, then a cold silver knife was pressed to his bare arm. Once it was clear that he was neither ghost, nor demon, nor shapeshifter, both women flung themselves into his arms, still in disbelief.
“It’s a demon thing,” Sam spoke up, “Our friend Jody needs our help. There’s no way we can get out of it.”
“That’s rich, coming from you,” she said before taking a bite of her dinner. Jack was right, Dean did make really good mac and cheese. “You ate nothing but burgers and pie when I met you.”
“So, she’s not just here to kidnap Jack, she’s here to brainwash him for Michael?” Dean asked, rage evident in his voice.
“Absolutely not,” Dean said immediately, shaking his head. “Jack needs some more experience before he goes on a hunt with anyone that isn’t me.”
The first week the boys are there, Dean wears long sleeves every day.  And Bobby wouldn’t think much of it, except for last time they stayed it was June.  They’d stayed for four days, and on the third day he and Dean had been out in the yard working on a car.  Bobby was teaching as he went, and the kid picked it all up quick.  Dean had stood to stretch and wipe his sleeve across his sweaty forehead, his sleeve rode up, and Bobby saw them.
Dean flushed, clenching and unclenching his fists at the mention of the angel. “He’s been around,” Sam said, “He’s been really helpful for processing the things I went through down there.”
Sam felt his blood run cold as he overheard the conversation happening between his father and brother.  He finished salting the doorways and windows, and then crept closer so that he could listen to the conversation more closely.
“I love you,” Sam muttered, licking his lips as he watched her. “And I’m proud of you. For everything, really. You deserve everything after what you’ve been through.”
“No, we’re not flying. We’re driving. Get in the car,” he said and gestured behind him. Cas stared at him for a long minute before he silently made his way to the passenger side and slid into the front. Dean smirked, glancing at Sam inside the store. He wasn’t gonna tell the angel to move.
“Yeah, I’ve got some stuff in the trunk that’ll work to strap a tree to the top,” Dean said, all three of them heading into the garage. Once they were back on the main road, Claire looked up the nearest tree farm and directed Dean to it. Once there, Claire took off ahead of Cas and Dean, darting through the trees to try and find the perfect one. When she glanced back, the two men were walking close together, hand in hand. She could tell they were talking quietly to each other but had no idea what they were saying. Claire couldn’t hold back her smile as she watched them.
“400, it’ll be the fastest,” Claire took a deep, shaky breath. “Alright, I’m gonna start driving. I’ll keep you updated on where I am.”
“I wouldn’t get close now now, Sammy, he’s very contagious,” Pestilence said. “Wouldn’t want you to get anything.”
When they nodded in reply, he took off in the direction of John’s yell, machete ready to take out whatever vampires John had awakened. When he arrived, he saw that John was being restrained by one vampire, the other poised to sink its teeth into his neck. Cas swung the machete severing that vampire’s head from its body, but was too slow to decapitate the other vampire before it was on John, holding its bloodied wrist to his mouth, forcing him to drink.
“I need to talk to you and your brother. Alone,” John looked between Jack, Claire, and Kaia. “And how many fucking kids you got around here?”
“Oh,” Dean couldn’t help the blush that rose to his cheeks. “Uh, you know, Castiel. Figure if he’s gonna be hanging around a while he should have something easier than Castiel.” Sam snorted. He knew what his brother looked like when he was flirting.
The man, Castiel, smiled, ”It was never the will of Heaven for you to die, Samuel. Heaven has plans for you, and my orders were to rescue you. You don’t belong in Hell, for right now, you belong on Earth.”
“That’s why I’m here, your mother. I found a way to bring her back,” the room was dead silent, Claire glancing between the two Winchester brothers as they had a silent conversation between themselves. Jack moved closer to Claire, standing slightly behind her and taking her free hand in both of his. She knew he needed it, needed the comfort, and she was going to give it to him as his pseudo big sister.
“Alright then, once you two finish dishes you can go watch your movie,” Cas said, standing to take his bowl to the sink, rinsing it briefly.
“Don’t worry about it, Jack. I heard what you said and I can talk to Sam and Dean about everything later. For now, you just go be with them, okay? They’ll find me when they’re ready.” Jack nodded gratefully and Mary watched as he flew away.
Dean nodded as he poured his coffee, “I’m sorry to hear that. I’m sure you deserved better than… whatever happened.”
“Unfortunately, yes, I do. There is currently a battle ongoing in eastern Europe that I must participate in. WIth any luck, we will secure a victory soon and I will be able to return and help with anything necessary from anyone that requires my assistance,” Cas hadn’t taken his eyes off Dean the entire time he spoke.
Thankfully, they parked in front of a restaurant before Dean could crash the car indulging himself. As they climbed out, Bobby had a bottle of whiskey in his hand - God knows where he got it - and was taking large swigs, while Mary’s fingers were twitching and she glanced around quickly. Before any of them could stop her, she had taken off across the street to a liquor store.
“Just on my way to visit some old college friends,” Dean lied easily. “Met them at Mizzou our first year and I had to transfer. Figured it’d be nice to see them again.”
“I quit when I found out I was pregnant with Dean. It wasn’t something I wanted my babies around, even if your father disagreed. He still smoked a pack a day,” Mary said with a small laugh. “It’s not something I’m very proud of.”
“Absolutely! Which one should I open first?” Cas volunteered and handed Dean his gift, a vintage Led Zeppelin vinyl, a set of Agathie Christie novels, and a beautifully carved wooden ring with a line of blue that ran straight through the middle, and it seemed to be glowing faintly.
. They had to wait almost three hours before Pestilence had finally retreated to his office where only his secretary was nearby. They agreed that Sam and Dean would get closer to make sure he didn’t slip out during the alarm with everybody else and Cas would actually be the one to pull the trigger. They all got into positions and on Dean’s visual command, Cas set off the fire alarm. Sam and Dean waited until they saw the secretary hurry down the hall before rushing the office door, throwing it open with their guns aimed at Pestilence as soon as they saw the demon.
Before Claire knew it, it had been over two months since she was completely healed and given her car keys back, but she had yet to even try and find a hunt. She needed to, though, she was growing restless, and her daily walks with Miracle weren’t cutting it.
Cas hesitated for a second, “Do you want to… meet Jack?” Claire and Kaia looked at each other for a moment and then turned back to Cas, nodding.
Claire sniffled, “I can’t lose anyone else. He has to be okay.” Kaia moved her chair as close as possible to Claire’s and grabbed her hand. Claire leaned over, resting her head on Kaia’s shoulder.
Cas zipped up his duffel, “If he doesn’t keep his mouth shut, I’m not the one you should be worried about.”
“Oh shut up with the villain monologue,” Dean groaned. “I don’t care to hear it. What I want to hear is where Lilith is.”
Claire and Kaia laughed, drinking from their own cans. The three of them chatted as they ate and drank, so engrossed in their own world that they had stopped paying attention to their surroundings.
“Of course,” Sam said, depositing his phone on the nightstand. He briefly pulled open the drawer just to double check the ring box stashed in the back corner - still nestled safely amongst a few books and a box of condoms. He shut the drawer and slid into bed behind Bela, pulling her back against his chest. “Whatever you want.”
None of the hunters - or Rowena - dared to comment on the situation, watching the conversation unfold between the current and former angel.
“Blech, I don’t get why anybody would make a chip out of the grossest vegetable,” Sam said, and they devolved into debating chip types.
“Alright, what you got so far?” Claire explained each of the potential cases, letting Dean look over the articles as well.
“Because I’m a guy?” Dean scoffed. “Don’t know if you know this, but that ain’t all that popular around these parts. Or anywhere, really.”
“Oh,” Cas whispered, letting his hands, which had previously sat awkwardly on his knees, come up to grip Dean's arms. “And are you mine?”
Dean laughed, knowing that Cas hadn’t intended to be insulting. He held the bottle out towards Cas, who grabbed it, fingers grazing over Dean’s. He opened the bottle easily and handed it back. Dean refused to let himself think of what else that angel strength could be used for.
Dean clapped Jack on the shoulder, “We know, kid, Sister Jo told us. We’re just sorry we couldn’t have been there to help you. Nobody should have to kill their own father. If you have some weird feelings or you wanna talk about it, or anything, that’s okay.”
“That’s not what I mean,” Sam explained, “I’m sorry for how he treated you. I’m sorry he hit you, I’m sorry he blamed you for everything, I’m sorry you had to become a parent when you were fucking four years old.”
“C’mon then, I’ll make you a PB and J,” Dean agreed, leading the two of them to the kitchen. Luckily, no one else was in there, leaving the space empty save for the three of them. Cas had Jack sit down at the table as Dean prepared the sandwich, asking him easy questions about what he remembered and what he knew about his own conception and birth.
“Yeah, he’s dead,” Dean confirmed. “Help me wrap him up.” They worked together to wrap the corpse up in the plastic sheet. “Go back the car up right in front of the door, as close as you can get. We’ll put him in the trunk and find a place to burn his body.”
As predicted, Azazel wasn’t far behind Jake. He sauntered into the graveyard, yellow eyes scanning between headstones and statues for any potential threats. He smirked, approaching Mary. “Oh, Mary. It must weigh so heavily on you that both your husband and your son are rotting in Hell and it’s all your fault. If you hadn’t been so selfish all those years ago…” he nonchalantly examined his fingernails and tsked, “Things would look so different now, wouldn’t they?”
“You keep her name out of your fucking mouth!” Sam shouted. Dean was surprised at how angry Sam was at the mention of Bela. He glanced around to see if there was anything that he could use to get themselves out of this situation. “You don’t know anything about her.”
“You fed, John, why the fuck would you do that?” Cas asked, “We could’ve cured you easily if you had just stopped and thought for a second. Instead, you ran off, and you fed, and now you know what I have to do.”
Dean pulled on some jeans and a flannel, and padded into the kitchen to get some coffee going. He was surprised to find the kitchen light on, despite it being just barely after 6 in the morning. Bela sat at the table, sipping some tea as she flipped through what looked to be a tacky YA novel. Dean smiled to himself, knowing that she had probably stolen it from the stash Claire would never admit to having.
“Tell me more about this thing you’re hunting so I can give you the answer and go to bed,” was his reply. Dean was comforted by the familiar no-nonsense attitude. Dean relayed everything they knew, leaning against the Impala’s front bumper as he spoke. “You three are idjits, it’s a goddamn Siren. Get out there and kill it before it kills anyone else.”
Eventually, all the demons had been incapacitated one way or another and only Sam, Dean, and War were left standing. “You boys do put on quite the show,” War said, giving them a condescending slow clap. “But time is up.”
“We’ll call Cas,” Dean said. “Have him come with us. He’s got more firepower than all of us combined.” Mary sighed but conceded to the compromise. “Alright, we’ll get packed and on the road.”
Dean pushed open the door and stepped into one of the more run-down but well-loved bars he had been in. The linoleum under his feet was cracking and sticky, some booths revealing more foam core than vinyl, and more than half the lights above his head were burnt out. But the place was filled with people, all of them laughing and smiling and the bar was crowded, almost every stool occupied.
“I am not positive,” Castiel said. “But there is a church that has been heavily warded and I cannot see inside it.”
“I am sure that you’ll figure it out soon,” Jack said, and Claire wasn’t sure if his optimism was to make her feel better or if he was just like that, but she was leaning toward the latter. “After all, there are only so many truths you can say before you eventually get to your deepest one.” Claire just rolled her eyes and dropped her head back on the table.
“Claire, Dean loves you. You’re...you’re his daughter. This might change things but it doesn’t mean he’s going to kick you out or something,” Kaia siad, squeezing her hand. “Come on. They’re in the library.” Claire let Kaia lead her out of their room and down the hallway. She shook the closer they got, clutching Kaia’s hand in a death grip when she saw Sam and Dean. She felt her eyes well as Dean looked at her, and she knew it, he’s angry and he’s going to tell her to pack her shit and leave-
Claire woke up late the next morning to an empty bed. She shrugged one of Kaia’s cardigans on and stumbled out to the library, Dean and Cas sitting at one of the tables. “Where is everybody?” she asked, dropping into a chair across from them.
