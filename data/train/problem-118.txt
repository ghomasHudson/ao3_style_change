“She worked at the University, same as the other two. She was knocked unconscious brought here and tied up, looks like this one woke up before he broke her neck. There are signs of struggle around the ropes.” Anderson explained.
“Dogs.” John glanced over at Sherlock before returning his gaze to the road. “Cap’ is very affectionate. Never could get him to break the jumping on people habit.”
“Look at those cheekbones. I bet you had all the girls at Hogwarts vying for your attention.” Adler gave the detective a cheshire grin before her lidded eyes shifted to watch John walk into the room with a bowl of water. “Pitty you play the other side of the fence, in more ways than one.”
“I heard! Coming!” There was the patter of footsteps from the stairs as the detective clattered down from their spare bedroom which after many arguments had become Sherlock’s laboratory.
It’s not until the man throws Sherlock a freshly loaded shotgun - which the detective reflexively catches - that he remembers where he is and that the two of them are going to have to fight their way out. The first guard comes running into the room, his loud slapping footsteps cause Sherlock to turn towards the sound and fix his awkward hold on the gun in his hands.
“Johnjohnjohnjohnjohn!” Sherlock chants like an incantation as John rubs his rough fingertips over his prostate. “Please! John! I can’t!”
“Sher…” Moriarty was turning gone blue, his mouth makings fish like gulping movements. The blood vessels in his eyes burst and he collapsed onto his knees.
Sherlock slams the door of his mind palace closed behind him and folds himself into his armchair in 221B. He quickly touches his face.
John lost a little ground in his hesitation and struggled to catch up with the longer stride of Mr Blue Scarf, but as they reached the end of the alleyway he was only a step or two behind. They entered the main street, the thief re-appeared nearby running straight even as Mr Blue Scarf shouted, “Turn left!” at John while he swung right.
Sherlock gasped as John spread the lube around his arsehole, rubbing and swirling his fingertips around the sensitive ring of muscle. “John! Please!”
It had taken a fair amount of convincing on Sherlock’s part to ensure that he was alone in the room when John woke up. He needed to be because otherwise he would be terrified, just like Sherlock had been to wake up in another body.
“Then you understand why I will be immediately sending obliviators to this muggles house and, once again fixing up your mess. Really Sherlock, you need to either give up on apparition or focus a bit more. The three D’s and all that.” Mycroft waved a hand absently.
John rolled his eyes, “That was you, you berk. I shot the guy through the window if you remember, saving your life in the process. You were the one who ran off without me.”
Their mouths met, wet and sloppy their tongues wrapping around the other. Tracing teeth, licking and tasting. John leaned back, encircling his legs around Sherlock’s waist. “John...” Sherlock panted, “you taste…”
“You’re in hospital, love. I think there was an accident.” John rubs firm circles on Sherlock’s back and starts to gently rock them. “Tell me what you remember? The last thing that happened before you woke up?”
The nurse had finished her examination and left. He’d passed with flying colours but he was still somehow stuck inside John’s body. Further investigation was needed, but first Sherlock needed to relieve himself. It was fine, he was a man, John was a man. He knew how to pee, but… He also wasn’t quite ready to see and touch John in such an intimate way.
“Hhhuuuummmmmmmfffff!” Sherlock whines as John slides the head of his prick up and down Sherlock’s arsehole. The tip of his cock catches on Sherlock’s rim and slips inside. “AH! YES!” Sherlock’s hips rock back onto John and he grinds down.
“You have an intermittent tremor in your right hand, which is odd given the placement of your wound, I suspect shrapnel damage or perhaps nerve damage. Which leaves you without a steady hand to perform surgery and I would assume an honorable discharge from the army. Except they offered you a desk job and you took it. You couldn’t face the idea of being without some part of your identity.”
The inane chime went off again. “Good morning everyone, this is your Captain speaking. We’re about to make our descent into Brisbane international airport. The time on the ground is 5:34 am the 10th of February, I hope you brought some sunblock it's a very warm thirty-seven degrees celsius, with a humidity of sixty-eight percent. No rain or showers are expected today, so enjoy those blue skies! Thank you for flying Qantas. We hope you enjoyed your flight, and please don’t hesitate to ask our stewards if there is anything you require.”
John grinned down at Sherlock, “Right where I want you.” He winked and then moved. Sherlock’s eyes slammed shut, the feeling of John squeezing around his cock, lifting himself up and dropping down, was intense.
John was dreaming. He was back on the battlefield, trying to drag one of his squadmates under cover. He needed to put a tourniquet on the man's leg before he bled to death. There was a soft thunk on John’s right, one of the Taliban soldiers had thrown a grenade. Thinking quickly, John picked it up and threw it back over the car he’d hid behind. It exploded before it hit the ground on the other side, shattering the windows and jolting the car.
“John!” Sherlock shouted, feeling like he could cum already. Forcing his eyes open again was a mistake, the sight of John’s body flexing and moving. The pink scar tissue of the crocodile bite stretching tight over his skin, the flush over his cheeks, the sweat dripping down his chest, the smell of them together. It was too much. “I’m gonna-” Sherlock groaned.
“Oh, there’s always something.” Sherlock panted into John’s mouth, “Wh-why are you telling me this?”
Rosamund laughed, “Blonds have more fun, I certainly have. How were those two years locked away in that cell Johnny? Did you get bored? Cold?” she tilted her head slightly almost like a bird of prey sizing up their next kill. “Perhaps that’s going a bit far. Have you
“I’m afraid Major Jones has been called away, you can start with me if you like.” The Captain offered. “I’m free now in fact. Please, Holmes have a seat. Can I get you anything? Tea, coffee or a glass of water perhaps?”
“I’m sorry to interrupt you Mr Watson, do you often mumble to yourself when lost in thought?” The Doctor asked, smiling down kindly.
Sherlock froze, the cold, soft voice on the other end of the phone could only belong to one person. “Moriarty.” Sherlock greeted. “How wonderful of you to call.”
“John, these are for you.” Sherlock said, his voice rough and croaky. He gulped, trying to fight back tears, offering the bouquet of flowers to John. “I’m-
“Oh, pish-posh you’ll be fine. That didn’t hurt.” Mrs Hudson suddenly became deadly serious. “I want you to imagine the rest of your life here, without John. You’re thirty-eight years old. How much longer do you think you’ll be able to run around after criminals? Ten years? Twenty? Then what?”
“Screaming for the last ten minutes has obviously achieved nothing, I don’t understand why you believe continuing to do so will change the outcome of your current situation.” Sherlock sneered down at Scotland Yard's Commissioner, “You’re lucky I’m feeling so generous, really. With the number of murderers you’ve allowed to go free over the years, I should do the citizens of London a favour and just drop you into the Thames and be done with it.”
“Still a puppy then.” Sherlock couldn’t stop the fondness in his tone. If he had one weakness it was dogs. John’s house was neat but homely, it had been too dark to see much when they’d gotten out of the car. From the inside, Sherlock could see that the house was untraditional in its construction. Almost resembling a wood cabin, gnarly unfinished timber had been used for the majority of the building. It gave it a wonderful warm feeling. “This is a beautiful house.”
The feeling inside Sherlock’s chest was unlike anything he had ever experienced before. It was almost like what he remembered his first Christmas morning felt like. The excitement and happiness filling him up, the anticipation of what was to come. What treasures he would find wrapped in festive paper under the tree. John wasn’t just physically beautiful to Sherlock, he was perfect.
“You’re entirely too coherent,” John growled again, pulling Sherlock up so he could kiss those sinful lips again. “I want to be inside you Sherlock, will you let me?”
With a twist of his fingers, John pressed against the nub of Sherlock’s sweet spot. The curly haired brunette squeaked, then shuddered with pleasure and practically melted on top of John. Then the quiet moment between them was over, Sherlock was rutting into John’s stomach with determined movements. John was rubbing, twisting and stretching Sherlock’s arsehole with renewed dedication.
John chuckled and took a long, deep sip of his tea. “Sebastian and Rosamund Moran. They’re mercenaries, and Moriarty's right and left-hand men so to speak. Sebastian was a Major in the Army until he was dishonourably discharged, his sister Rosamund is an assassin. Seb was caught selling ammunition,
Or at least hoped that John would ask him out to dinner, he liked Italian, Thai and Chinese. All the same foods that Sherlock enjoyed, when he could be bothered to eat. John laughed at his jokes, even when they were in poor taste or horrendously morbid.  They just worked, in a way Sherlock had never experienced with another human being before. But John was still hiding something from Sherlock.
“Glad I could help, seriously. I want to help you. Not just for revenge, either. They need to be stopped, what they’re doing isn’t right.” John had moved from his chair and was now standing very close to Sherlock. His eyes blazed, his body seemed to almost glow, he looked powerful and capable of anything. Sherlock wanted to trust him, he wanted to
“As you should, Lestrade. I don’t understand why we go through this every time-” Sherlock broke off his usual rant as his phone started to ring in his pocket. Sherlock pulled out the smartphone and glanced at the screen before swiping to accept.
John’s eyes met his own in his reflections, his eyes were glowing. Like fire. “Fuck!” John shouted at himself, how long had they been glowing? Had Sherlock noticed? He hadn’t said anything. “Shit.” John stared into his own eyes, watching the way they sparkled and glittered like hot embers. He needed to get control again, push the energy down.
They didn’t have any lube, or at least they hadn’t even tried to find the medical jelly that most likely would be stored in the supply cupboard on the opposite wall. Even so, they were both wet with precum and sweat, John spat down at his fist, coating their cocks in his spit before capturing Sherlock's mouth with his own, tongues sliding. John’s mouth captured Sherlocks own again, tongues sliding, breaths meeting. It wouldn’t take long now, Sherlock was so close. His hands gripping onto John’s shoulders, nails dragging down his back into John’s flesh.
Sherlock shrugged, “No.” he glanced down at the plate in front of the muggle picked up a slice of bacon and popped it into his mouth.
“Fucking hell!” Johno grunted, his lips sliding off Sherlock’s mouth to suck on his jaw. “You’re so sexy.” The Zookeeper’s arms wrapped around Sherlock and tried to pull them closer together, as close as they could possibly be.
The sound of Captain Barks’ deep howling and George’s more high pitched yaps exploded from behind the closed door. If Sherlock’s knocking hadn’t been loud enough to wake John, his wonderful dogs certainly were.
John’s brain did an automatic head count. There were only four of them left, including himself. He’d watched almost all of his unit die today. The reality of the situation they were in suddenly hit John with force. They needed to retreat immediately before the house was overrun by the enemy. “Back door!” John shouted over the crack of gunfire and the popping of bullets hitting the walls of their sanctuary.
“How about; We need lube so you can make make me all slick and wet for you.” John grinned up at Sherlock as he straddled his waist, his wonderful lush bottom sitting over his cock. John’s hands reached out automatically and squeezed Sherlock's arse cheeks again.
“Oh baby,” John smirked, pulling his mouth away from Sherlock’s chest and returning to kiss and lick at Sherlock’s mouth. His lips were already turning pink, and swelling from the stubble burn. “Been wanting to do this for weeks,
“Lestrade said if I ever withheld evidence again he’d lock me in a cell overnight. I stole his badge.”
“Clothes.” Sherlock demanded as his head fell back against the wall with a gasp. The tension between them had become so thick, so strained. The moment the door had closed to the medical prep room, and their hands were clean of chicken blood, they’d come together. Violently.
The Captain’s only response to the suggestion is a sharp glare while his wheezing breaths puff the lycra material over the man’s mouth in and out.
“No!” Sherlock threw himself out of his armchair. “You’ve made your point crystal clear, I’ll visit John again and wipe his memory. Happy? Now, don’t you have a war to start? Surely the ministry needs you back, it certainly can’t run itself.”
For the first time in John’s life, he was wearing a tuxedo. The collar was stiff, starched beyond belief, the waistcoat was too tight across his chest and the shoes were half a size too small. John supposed it was a bit much to expect Sherlock - MI6 agent extraordinaire - to come up with two bespoke suits in less than twenty-four hours. Still, Sherlock looked like a walking wet dream, which John could only be smug about.
“I was undercover.” Sherlock said as he quickly texted Lestrade to come to the University as fast as possible, they needed to catch Major Jones before he claimed another victim.
“Good morning everyone, we’re going to skip inspections today lucky you. I want you all to do four laps of the field while Holmes completes his punishment. I’ll be watching so keep up the pace! Go! Left! Right! Keep those knees high Cadet Hall!”
Their ‘Honeymoon’ phase was brought to a swift end with a phone call. The sound of his phone ringing brought Sherlock out of his deep sleep instantly. The caller ID was puzzling at first… ‘Mr. Sex’ but the phone had been given to Sherlock by Mycroft. It was secured, the only person who called was Mycroft himself or one of his MI6 minions.
“Move. In. With me.” Sherlock said with a precise slow pronunciation like he was talking to a three-year-old.
“What do you mean you didn’t obliviate him?” Mycroft was being annoying again. Why did siblings have a predisposition to pissing off their kin?
Sherlock’s hands immediately slipped over Cap’s warm fur, rubbing and petting the big dog. “You’re just wonderful!” Captain Barks made an excited rumbling bark, looking over at John and trying to climb further into Sherlock’s arms.
“Take a seat John, I’ll see about finding you some warm clothes. If you know how to start a fire, please do so. I’d rather not play nursemaid for the next week if you happen to catch pneumonia.” Sherlock waved his hand towards the large cast iron wood heater on the other side of the cabin. “There’s flint, sticks and dried grass in that box.”
John shifted about in the bed some more before his eyes opened and he looked at Sherlock. He was instantly confused, “Huh?”
However, the blinking panel appeared too much to resist. Curiosity had always been one of Sherlock’s greatest weaknesses. With a few quick strides, he made his way over to the lights and observed the panel closely. There were oily deposits on most of the buttons from repetitive use by ungloved fingers.
John’s cock was hard and hot. So hot. Sherlock let his fingertips just softly brush over the length of it. It twitched again, it actually lifted up off John’s lower belly and brushed against his hand. “John!” Sherlock wriggled down the bed and spread his legs wide. He grasped John’s cock firmly,
Was it consensual for Sherlock to touch John in this way? Sherlock didn’t know but it was too late to ask John. He was unconscious possibly stuck inside Sherlock’s body and if Sherlock waited anymore he would pee all over himself.
onto my kitchen table. Fucks sake, you gave me a heart attack you posh git.” Sherlock’s eyes swept over John’s body again, just like they had yesterday morning. It felt like being under a microscope.
John’s skin had returned to normal now, only his palms and eyes were still glowing with fire. Sherlock steeled himself and reached out, placing his hand on John’s shoulder. Turning him away from Rosamund's body and towards his own. “John, focus on me. Look at me.”
John reacted instantly, his hands coming to rest on Sherlock's hips. His eyes darkening. “I didn’t want to push my luck, not after last night.” He leaned forward and nipped at Sherlock's lips. “But I hoped, you might like to…” John bit his lip.
Sherlock gathered all the moments his mind was clinging to and tried to shove them into one room, but the door refused to close. The taste of John’s kisses or the sound he made when he’d cum all over Sherlock earlier would escape and he’d have to snatch it back and shove it inside again.
“Desperado or Bloodhound, it matters not. I’ll stop your evil schemes no matter what you call yourself, although if you prefer I could always call you by your
The sun was just peeking over the horizon, the sky beginning to turn a brilliant orange-pink as the light chased away the darkness of the night before. Sherlock glanced down at his hands, perhaps it was time he started believing in something as silly as fate. As he’d been sitting on the plane coming to land in Brisbane Airport the pilot had wished all aboard a Happy Valentine’s Day.
“Oh for fuck's sake,” John growled, curling himself into a tighter ball, lowering his legs from Sherlock’s shoulders to wrap around his waist, rolling them over. Sherlock’s stomach lurched, for a moment thinking they’d roll right off the kitchen bench and onto the floor. John controlled their movement perfectly, Sherlock found himself laying on his back right at the edge of the counter with John sitting on his cock.
As he listened to Mycroft talk, Sherlock reached for the now whistling kettle. “I’m not a pawn for you to move around your chessboard Mycroft. Once this is over my debt to you is finished, no more calling in little favours big brother.”
Sherlock shook himself, his mind palace had never been like this before. His breath was short, his chest tight. He couldn’t breathe. “John!” Sherlock gasped.
“Lestrade? Has there been another one?” Sherlock asked when he picked up his phone later that evening.
Sherlock stopped climbing and glanced down at John below him on the ladder. “Now is not the time for your terrible flirting John.”
The Captain clapped his hands loudly right in front of Sherlock face, which caused him to jump. “Now I have you attention Cadet Holmes, I want you to drop and give me twenty pushups. Now.”
Oi Johno!” Sherlock’s guide called, cupping his hands around his mouth to get even more volume. Sherlock wondered if Mycroft could hear them back at the Diogenes Club. Sherlock rolled his eyes, turning back to see who the crazy Australian had called out to.
The thick black smoke that trailed out of the stranger's mouth as he released his breath caused Sherlock to forget himself again. The detective was captivated, watching the peculiar shirtless man make his way across the room to a steel cabinet, ripping the doors off their hinges. His powerful arms bulging, pulling the silver scars that cover his entire body tight across his skin.
Sherlock opened the door and immediately had to clench his teeth to stop the gasp that wanted to escape. The recruiter was a middle-aged man, clean-shaven and hair cut military short. He wore an officer’s uniform, his white hat resting to the left on his desk. As Sherlock entered the man stood and offered his hand.
“Aye, he is. Indeed.” Moriarty watches as John struggles for a moment, realising he’s back inside a glass cell. His eyes blazing orange, yellow and red. Burning with hatred and barely contained power. John looks around and spots them standing beside the pool. He makes eye contact with Sherlock for a moment before looking into James’ eyes.
Sherlock made his way, unaccompanied this time, back to the Reptile section of the Zoo. He was to meet with Johno, who would allow him into the crocodile enclosure and keep the residents occupied so Sherlock wouldn’t become lunch himself.
He was safe now, warm, able to breathe. He didn’t need to channel, he needed to let go. He needed to look normal, or Sherlock wouldn’t have a reason to hand him over and be experimented on. He couldn’t let that happen
The Captain glanced over him with a considering look on his face. “I see, but that’s no excuse Cadet. Your punishment still stands. Drop and give me twenty push-ups, now.”
“I could shoot her from here.” John offered, pulling his handgun from his holster. Together they made their way over to one of the access ladders up to the rigging above the stage, there were crosswalks at the top they could walk on at least.
Sherlock called his brother the moment he stepped out of the Coroner’s Office. It rang and rang and rang before finally going to voicemail. Sherlock frowned, Mycroft always answered his phone. Just as Sherlock lifted the phone away from his ear, he heard it: Moriarty’s voice.
“London survived without you for hundreds of years, Sherlock. It will carry on after you’re gone.” Mrs Hudson reached over and took hold of the hand that had been curled around the now cold teacup. “Take this advice from an old woman. You don’t get a chance like this more than once or twice in a lifetime, Sherlock. You’ve found someone who makes you truly happy.”
Sherlock kicked out at the Assassin and managed to knock her gun out of her hand. It sailed over the railing and landed with a clatter on the stage below. The fire spread quickly, the curtains lighting up like dried grass. John took a deep breath and began to pull the flames back into himself, but he didn’t need to. The smoke set off the alarms and within seconds the theatre's sprinkler system started pouring water all over them.
The body of the secretary was found in the same pose as the previous two had been. She was tied up in a kneeling position in front of the Queen Victoria statue. The words ‘Hail Empress of India’ had again been printed in large block letters and stapled to the victim’s chest. Her head fell back at an unnatural angle proving that her neck had been broken, the same cause of death as the previous victims.
Moran’s shoes appeared beside John’s head for a second before the mad ex-soldier laughed. “You’ve lost Holmes! How about I finish this now aye? I’ve always wondered how flammable muggles are. Incendio Tria!”
“There you are.” John smiled and reached out to take Sherlock’s left hand. “You haven’t answered my question.”
“Maybe. I’d have to test it. Follow me.” Sherlock glanced up to where he could just make out Rosamund climbing over a railing to get into a better position. “I’m not a fan of climbing up there, she might see us. We need a better plan.”
“As you say. However, it doesn’t really matter how it happened. Now we must deal with the consequence.” Mycroft reached for the silver teapot between them, making a gesture towards Sherlock’s empty cup. He shook his head, he didn’t have time for tea. Apparently, Mycroft was sending him to the other side of the bloody world. “Our infiltration was discovered. Moriarty’s men are looking for you, we don’t know how far his network can reach. It is possible that they know the location of this safehouse. After all, it is no secret how you favour London. You need to lay low for awhile.”
Azza, also known as the Zoo Administrator, laughed heartily. “No no! I like the aircon too much, bloody hell it’s muggy today. I’ve worked up a sweat just showing the officer around!” Azza shrugged in a self-deprecating way and motioned towards Sherlock. “This ‘ere is Nigel Humphrey. He’s been sent by Interpol. If you can believe that?”
“I know you’re working alone, Sherlock Holmes. I wonder, how much would your brother pay in ransom for you? Maybe I’ll cut off some of your fingers, your hair too perhaps and mail it to him. Do you think he’d pay triple or quadruple digits?”
. Mycroft had called him… Nigel Humphrey. Sherlock shuddered. He was going to take scissors to Mycroft's Van Gogh. He would drug his brother and shave him. He would… he would… Sherlock turned the page in the folder. He’d been given a case. Quickly Sherlock’s eyes took in the photographs of the crime scene; It was a bloody mess. Quite literally.
John laughed and then flinched, “Bugger, yeah okay Sherlock lets swap back now. You climbed that pole you can put up with the pain of lightning burns. I am a little pissed that I don’t get to wank you off though. You’re going to have to make it up to me.”
The blond muggle lowered his gun and stared gobsmacked at the stranger sitting crossed legged in front of him on top of his breakfast. “That was amazing.”
Sherlock leaned exhausted, against the door and groaned pitifully at the stairs the he would need to climb to make it up to his flat. Captain Watson was the devil. After running four laps of the field he’d allowed the cadets a moment to catch their breath and drink some water before they had to suit up with weighted packs and run through several obstacle courses.
Sherlock groaned, his soapy hand wrapping around his erection and stroking firmly. God, how he wished it was John’s hand. John kneeling before him, taking his cock into his mouth. John’s beautiful deep blue eyes darkened with lust, just like they had been only an hour earlier.
Mr Blue Scarf stood up, ran a hand through his mess of curls and took a few deep breaths. “Consider yourself under a citizen's arrest.” The stranger quickly fished his smartphone out from within his coat (which seemed strangely similar to another coat John had seen recently) and put it to his ear. “Lestrade, send one of your least irritating officers to Black Prince Road. I have caught Mr Amberley.”
Sherlock forcefully moved his attention from Johno’s face back to the black sack on his shoulder. “Pleasure. I’m to investigate the death of Sebastian Moran.”
John shivered at the words and the sensation of heat rippling off of Sherlock’s looming form. Directly behind him. Nearly pressed up against him, right there behind him. He gripped the countertop tightly and tried to screw his eyes shut to block the cascade of images that now ran unchecked through his brain.
John lifted his head from where he was staring straight ahead to the black sky before falling back to the black water.
“Keys John,” Sherlock asked the slumped figure at his side. There was no response. Sherlock half expected to hear snoring. “Keys,” he repeated slightly louder. When he was met with the same silence he decided to scavenge for them himself. He patted his hands down John’s sides, the only acknowledgement of the action was a small flinch from John. Retrieving the keys from John’s trouser pocket, Sherlock eased the door open and as quietly as possible urged his unresponsive former flatmate upstairs. Sherlock had no particular wish to confront Mrs. Hudson just yet.
“He’s peculiar like that, my brother. He acts so closed off to everyone. Never letting anyone get too close. But at the same time, without you even noticing, he gets close. So close that he crawls under your skin and you feel at loss when he's gone.” Mycroft’s expression was reminiscent as he said it, dreamy almost. John understood what he meant though. Living with Sherlock had definitely not been easy but by living with him he had developed a bond with the man that he couldn't quite explain. With Sherlock gone now John felt an incomprehensible loss. As if a part of him were missing. A part that he had given to Sherlock and a part that he had taken when he left.
Sherlock opened his mouth to respond, John’s name about to slip from his lips but he was beaten to it. “Fine,” John said sharply, letting go of Sherlock’s hand so quickly that he almost threw it back towards him. “Leave.”
Sherlock stiffened his body as John leaned harder against him, slumping forward onto Sherlock. A sheen of sweat had beaded around John’s face and neck and his breathing was loud and almost laboured where his agape mouth was pressed against Sherlock’s shoulder. Moving his hands to clutch John’s waist, Sherlock stumbled them both back away from the door, allowing John to lean into him. Slowly, Sherlock manoeuvred John to face to the side, his arm snaking around the bottom of his rib cage, John’s weight still resting entirely on Sherlock.
John was so lost in his thought, trying desperately to remember where that must be from that he didn’t realised he had been wondering for hours. He had made it so far that he was actually stood on Blackfriars Bridge. The cold air nipped at his exposed face as he leaned on the edge of the, surprisingly empty, iconic bridge.
“I’m sorry. It’s not something I say often and I’m not trying to manipulate or placate you. I am truly, deeply, sincerely sorry. For leaving, for hurting you, for making you feel like you were less than me. But please, believe me. I do love you John.” John made a sharp noise at that last sentence, his chest pushing out with the force of it. For a moment his mouth twisted, as if there was a bitter taste on his tongue. He seemed to want to argue, to fight, but his face took on a pale pallor and he seemed to physically deflate.
When the sobs had finally subsided to small, pathetic whimpering noises and then to nothing, John went about his usual shower routine. After reluctantly turning off the shower, John moved back over to the bathroom mirror. Wiping off the condensation, he grabbed a razor and a fresh razor head from the bathroom cabinet. As John brought the razor head up to attach it to the handle he hesitated as his eye caught the shining metal blades. He dismissed the idea almost as quickly as it appeared, the voice in the back of his head oddly deciding to remain quiet at the seemingly innocent gesture. Although he tried to push the thought back into the furthest reaches of his mind that didn’t stop him from being more acutely aware of the blades as he dragged them over his skin. Just as he was finishing the last stroke the razor nicked his jaw. He was aware that he reacted much slower than usual. Foregoing his usual curse, he just stood, staring transfixed in the mirror as a tiny rivulet of blood made its way down his throat. The innocent crimson droplet brought back flashes of images of masses of blood matted into curly black hair and running over ivory skin. John physically flinched at the image and looked away, wiping the blood quickly with his thumb. Ambling out of the bathroom and to his room, John picked out some fresh clothes from his wardrobe and dressed quickly. Already he was beginning to look like a functioning human being again.
With a renewed passion John tried again to walk forward. Sherlock tightened his grasp as John struggled against him, unconsciously making shushing noises as if John were a frightened animal. As a surge of strength went through John in another effort to pull away which led to him almost tipping over the edge, Sherlock acted. With all the strength he could muster, Sherlock pulled himself back, causing John to drop back off the ledge. Still entrapped in Sherlock’s arms, John was in an odd suspended position. He wasn’t standing, more being supported by Sherlock.
John stood fully under the spray of the shower, not caring that the water was turned up hot enough to burn, turning his shoulders and back red with the heat. He tried to avoid looking down at himself. John was quite a modest man but he had always been quite well built with clearly defined muscles from his days in the army. However, in recent times he hasn’t managed to keep to his usual routine of eating and exercise and he often found himself disgusted by his shrunken body and gaunt features. At some point John had actually gone around the flat and covered all the mirrors. If Ms. Hudson had noticed she had chosen not to comment. When John had finally gathered the will to move, he shut off the water, only hesitating a second longer, before clambering out of the tub and wrapping a towel loosely around his waist.
“John,” Sherlock said gently, almost carefully. “Let me go.” He was greeted by prolonged and tense silence. “John.” His voice firmer to the point where he sounded as if he were reprimanding the ex-army doctor. “Let me go.”
Flinching, John rolled his shoulders and jerked his body backward in an attempt to dislodge his friend’s hands. Anticipating the move, Sherlock swiftly removed his hands when John rolled his shoulder, transferring them instead to capture John’s wrists.
“I’m so sorry,” his whispered to the prone form beside him, pulling John’s jumper back down to hide the scars once more. Sherlock knelt forward, hunching over John’s chest, bowing his head down.
Sherlock wanted to refute what he was saying. Obviously, he didn’t think that. The only reason he hadn’t told John was because it was safer, for the both of them. And, he supposed, it was easier. Did John really believe that? That he didn’t matter? That Sherlock didn’t need him?
“John turn around and look at me.” Definitely an order this time. Sherlock almost sounded angry at John’s refusal. The implications of the situation had finally caught up to Sherlock and his outrage at what John had tried to do triggered an emotional whirlwind within the detective that manifested as his anger.
A vibration from John’s pocket disrupted his thoughts, dragging his mind back to reality and leaving him alone in the empty room once more. Sighing, he leaned forward to put his untouched tea on the coffee table. He reached into his coat pocket and pulled out his battered and scratched phone.
“Sherlock?” The single word released the floodgates for both men. Simultaneously they broke out into loud, wailing sobs, clutching each other as tightly as they could. A fruitless attempt from Sherlock to manoeuvre them to the sofa ended with them both sat on the floor. John was practically in Sherlock’s lap as he was leaned so far into Sherlock. The crooked sitting position that Sherlock had adopted was uncomfortable and his back was strained from bending to clutch at the back of John’s jumper, but he couldn’t find it within himself to care. Instead he simply dug his fingers deeper into the scratchy material and pull it closer toward himself. Again, Sherlock began to make reassuring shushing noises between his own tearful cries in response to the whimpering from over his shoulder.
Just for the sake of choice he pocketed them and stepped out before he could think any more about it. As quietly as he could he descended the stairs, aware of Mrs. Hudson sleeping in her room.
“Why?” Sherlock pleaded. The whisper of his words ghosted over the shell of John’s ear. There was a long pause between the two men. For a long moment they just stood intertwined in an intimate embrace on Blackfriars bridge under the midnight sky just listening to each other’s breathing.
“Pull yourself together Watson, you’re a soldier. He wouldn’t want this for you.” John muttered to his reflection.
It wasn’t a real question. Because of course Sherlock knew why there was blood on John’s shirt. If Sherlock had felt up to it, he could have said how old the blood was and the brand and thickness of the razor used to spill it. Regardless of how much Sherlock already knew, he was struggling to grasp the truth of the concept.
Shutting the door behind him, John followed after Mycroft through the impeccably clean and organised hallways. They ended up in a reasonably sized living room with a large flat-screen on one side of the room directly facing a long, black leather sofa and two armchairs on either side with a small coffee table sat in the middle of the semi-circle of furniture. John hesitated rather awkwardly on the edge of the room while Mycroft just plopped rather tiredly down onto the sofa. Noticing John’s hesitation Mycroft made a feeble attempt at a smile, that held none of its usual pretentiousness, and said, “please, have a seat.”
They remained like that for a minute or two more, until Mycroft was all cried out and his slender frame shook with the effects of weariness and grief. All the while John just calmly stroked his spine, shushing and cooing the fully-grown man as one would an upset child. John didn’t even notice some tears of his own had slipped down his cheeks. When Mycroft pushed back more firmly, John let him go. They both wiped the tears from their faces, John watching the other man intently as he studiously avoided eye-contact.
Genuinely want to apologise for such a long break. I'm doing my A levels right now and applying to Uni. Please forgive me. Please enjoy.
Without even loosening his grip on John, he pushed himself up onto his knees, awkwardly shuffling over to John until he was settled in front of him. He waited a moment, staring expectantly at John’s bowed head but no explanation was offered. As his patience wore thin, Sherlock began to extend his hand towards the hem of John’s jumper. John’s fist shot out like a striking cobra, catching Sherlock around the wrist in a vice-like grip. Other than that, John remained in the same position. Sherlock stared at his still bowed head and tried the wrest his hand from John’s grasp. It could not be done. John’s fingers clamped harder around Sherlock’s wrist when he began to move, making his whole hand fully immobile.
Pain struck Sherlock at the expression distorting his dear friend’s face. John’s eyes were screwed painfully tight and his mouth was contorted into a half-open silent cry. Sherlock brought his hands from John’s shoulder, gliding over the flesh of his throat, up to John’s cheeks. It felt so natural for Sherlock to so lovingly frame John’s face. He rubbed his thumbs over John’s cheeks, wiping away the tears as they fell. They stayed like that for a moment. The noises of the mundane world waking up around them played as background music to the two men. Sherlock was acutely aware of his surroundings, as he always is. Out of the corner of his eye he could see people beginning to drive through the area, the occasional pedestrian from a late-night escapade were also beginning to appear. Wanting to avoid a spectacle, Sherlock once again stepped closer to John, pulling him flush against his side. Using his black trench coat, he covered John as well as he could and began dragging him back to the flat.
London’s sky was grey and miserable through the window of 221b Baker Street where John Watson sat slumped in his armchair staring through the glass panes. The heating in the apartment was off and the chill of winter had seeped into the lifeless building. In the silence John could hear Mrs. Hudson bustling about downstairs, ever so often coming to the foot of the stairs and hesitating before turning back around. That had become almost a routine by now. She always came to check up on John in the mornings and evenings. That was routine. In the first few days she would come up more often, sometimes even spending the whole day with John. As the days progressed and John became no more responsive she began to distance herself more, leaving him to his own thoughts and allowing him to brood in solitude. John felt grateful and guilty, after all she had lost him too. John was never fully sure of the relationship between Mrs. Hudson and Sherlock but they had been close and he could tell that she grieved too.
“No!” John cried as Sherlock managed to hook an arm around his waist. For a fraction of a second Sherlock thought he had irritated the cuts and so flinched his arm back slightly. It was all that John needed to easily worm his way out of Sherlock’s grip, making a beeline for the door. Just as she reached it Sherlock came up behind him, slinging one arm across John’s chest and grabbing his arm, he spun him around and pinned him against the door. Before John could even gather his thoughts, Sherlock took a step closer and pressed each elbow to the door on either side of John’s head. He allowed no space for John to escape, his body pressed fully into the shorter man’s front, his face so close he could feel John’s trembling breath on his chin.
Straightening, Sherlock looked down at John’s mobile form. He looked painfully stiff. More like a corpse than a living man. His gaunt features and sickly-white skin in his sprawled position on the floor mimicked the scene of a man who had supposedly had a heart attack that the two of them investigated years ago. Sherlock shifted his thoughtful gaze of Johns face. Blood was still seeping through his jumper which had ridden up very slightly. With one more glance at his face, Sherlock steeped over John’s outstretched arm and crouched by his side.
Although his head spun, and his vision went black when he struggled into a standing position he still managed to rush to the bathroom within seconds. He slammed his shaking fist into the light switch, squinting against the sudden blinding light that tinged tiled walls into a dirty lime-green colour. The blade was exactly where he had left it. At this point he didn’t bother with hiding it. At this point he may as well carry it with him in his pocket.
John grabbed his jumper from the bathtub and pulled it on over his head. The blood from his sides stuck to the jumper and pulled the rough fabric of it against his irritated cuts. Dropping the razor in the sink he stumbled out of the bathroom, not bothering with the light. Quickly, his eyes scanned the dark apartment for the vague outline of a pair of shoes. He spotted some laying on the floor by the door and stumbled over to them. Supporting himself with an arm against the wall, he shoved his feet into the trainers, the backs of the shoes folding uncomfortably under his heels. Ignoring it John unlatched the door, swinging it open. From the corner of his eyes he saw his keys, his hand half-way to them before he hesitated. Does he need them? Is he coming back?
“John,” he whispered as he reached his friend. Sherlock resumed his earlier position by planting his hands firmly on John’s cheeks and gently tugging his head up to face him. Instead of having his eyes shut as Sherlock had presumed they would be grey-blue met with teary blue-green and it felt as if a jolt of electricity passed through Sherlock.
When the cold London air hit his face, he felt sobered almost instantly. The hysteria from the remnants of the memory began to fade into nothing, taking all else with it. Suddenly and instantly he felt drained and numb. His legs began to carry him, leaving his mind behind to catch up. Although only half-present he knew where he was going. He understood what he needed to do. So, he let his body drive while he retreated into his mind. Going through his life frame by frame.
“You left.” John whimpered. His lower lip trembled although he tried to still it. Again he refused to look at Sherlock, instead staring resolutely at the upturned collar of Sherlock’s trench coat. “Not only did you leave but you lied. Because it’s fine to lie to John. John doesn’t matter enough for me to be honest with him. He’s not smart enough to understand my great master plans anyway. I don’t even need him so why wouldn’t I leave.” His voice raised as he mimicked Sherlock but lower to almost a whisper on the last sentence.
“I know what you mean,” John replied, putting a genuine effort into the smile he offered at the older Holmes. John remained at Mycroft’s home for hours. They shared stories, not only of Sherlock but of their life experiences, it was the first time in a long time that John had spoken to anyone of his days in the army. It was the first time in a long time that John had spoken so deeply to anyone at all. When they ran out of words they simply sat in a comfortable silence, each lost in their own thoughts until something in their internal monologue would resurface another memory that they chose to share. Talking with Mycroft, while it didn't lift the sadness that John felt, it eased the isolation that had been suffocating John since Sherlock’s death.
“It doesn’t matter right now. I’ll tell you about it later,” Sherlock reassured as John made a displeased look, a frown pulling his wearied features downward. Finally, Sherlock allowed himself to fully absorb every detail of his closest companion.
A fresh wave of tears welled up in John’s eyes. Almost sheepishly, John ducked his head. The distance between them made Sherlock’s skin itch. They had spent so long so far apart and the hour that they had spent together they had constantly been touching. Over all of the years that the pair had lived together, touching had never been part of their everyday existence. Sherlock always ensured that all touching was measured, planned or entirely avoided. The fragile concept of masculinity had always put a certain amount of distance between John. Touching was always a rarity reserved for dire situations or necessity. Perhaps Sherlock’s mind was clouded and overloading with emotion and confusion, but he had quickly grown fond of the sustained contact he had shared with John. He even felt that he had begun to crave it.
“What DID your grandmother do in her village then?” Sherlock countered carefully, trying to level her with a frosty glare. Vida paused for a moment before she spoke. Sherlock could almost say she looked a tad embarrassed.
“Looks like she has a slot open right now - she had a no-show. She's probably grabbing a quick break in the kitchen. It's been ridiculously loco today. Must be a full moon or something. C'mon. I'll take you to her.” Hamish gallantly pointed around the corner.
Without moving away from John, the noticeably taller man opened his full, rosy mouth (not that John was staring, he just HAPPENED to be looking, just there), and cocked his head at John.
John hastily removed the offending search from the machine's memory and closed a few more of Sherlock's open tabs. This morning’s weather report was the last one open it seemed, when he noticed it at the bottom of the screen. There was a Google Docs file open. Confused, he clicked it and was greeted with something that made his heart lurch to the depths of his stomach sickeningly:
“I'm still asleep, dammit,” he mockingly groused. “I got you coffee, though I wasn't sure what you might like to eat or if you had any restrictions. It's cream, no sugar, right?”
“You are being very agreeable John,” he watched his dream-self demure to his flatmate. “Pass me the scones….the butter...the  marmalade...mmm try the syllabub... now kiss me…”
“Yours if you want, Sherlock. I do. If that's what you wanted too, I'm right there.” John stroked the thumb at Sherlock's jawline and felt him lean into his touch.
Also- Thanks for following along thus far! Feel free to comment at any time and let me know things you liked or struck you along the way. Your thoughts and impressions are my locked room murder case...
“That good, huh?” smirked Hamish. They don't even have to pay. Better than being in the States. They get a free ride here. I brought 22 to 25 gauge needles. Maybe I should have brought a few big adrenaline needles for show and scare them into soiling their Depends?”
Once they had directives, the two responded much more efficiently. Deirdre called the authorities quietly and Hamish began to herd the smattering of early morning patients and the other nurse under the pretense of a threat to the building. It was a sign of the more dangerous times they lived in in Great Britain that they got little resistance from the waiting patients. Most of them had experienced an evacuation drill or had been in a similar scenario before. They grumbled a bit, but followed Hamish out to the sidewalk outside. He left Deirdre with wait with them and went back inside to try and get his things from his locker- like his coat.
He would definitely have to remember to thank that nice doctor at Bart's that helped him get into the program before he left for his eventual assignment.
“Sure, sure,” John eyes softened. I'm still more upset about my stethoscope, if I'm honest than all the other goings-on from today. What does that say about me really?”
John leaned menacingly over the table to get Sherlock to even LOOK at him while he attempted to dress him down.
“I got your agar plates and those depression slides from Molly to keep you until you get the ones from Belgium that you like.”
Sherlock raised his mental estimation of Dr. Sawyer up a few notches. He nodded his thanks and slipped out of the room, down the hall, and into John's office. The bag was exactly where she described and he pushed the stethoscope down to the bottom of the capacious bag. He left the room unobserved and returned to await Sarah back in the kitchen. He heard John's footsteps and voice as he brought his next patient to the room and the noise of him closing his office door.
John meanwhile, was doing some head clearing of his own. He showered and put on clean clothes all the while not being able to shake the, well, pleasure of waking up with Sherlock in his arms. Who would have thought that the tall, lanky, usually pain in the arse man would fit so nicely tucked against his own body?. No one had panicked or insulted anyone for doing such an idiotic thing. Just a quick blush that colored the younger man’s cheeks fetchingly as they untangled their limbs and separated. Sherlock just felt good against him. What did that mean?? John tried to take that quietly in and with the small shake, realized he'd been standing in his room half dressed for who-knows-how-long thinking about how warm and pliant and affecting Sherlock had felt curled around him. So much so, that he had feigned sleep when he felt Sherlock stir, just keep them together on the sofa a bit longer.
“Uunnhhh!!!” Sherlock shuddered and mewled helplessly, totally overwhelmed by the sharp firing of the neuroreceptors in his scalp.
They fumbled out of pants and pajama bottoms, kissing and touching everywhere; their scents intermingled and heated the entire room into one great frenzy of molten desire and need.
Hamish was terrified. He had no idea of what to do and honestly felt as though his legs were going to give out, right there. John was a few feet away, but it might have well have been miles. John was radiating confidence and doing his best to calm the hysterical patient, but even Hamish could tell that things were going downhill at an alarming rate.
Mr. Chamberlain  was suddenly on his feet, shouting at John. He needed something. NOW. It was unbearable and he needed to make it all stop and Dr. Watson better do what he asked. John quietly hit the intercom button on his desk phone as he made a pointed display of putting his clipboard and pen down slowly and non threateningly. His thought was that what was happening in his office was now would be broadcast to all the phones in the clinic. Someone could then get the police here as soon as possible. He just had to talk the raving drug deprived man down a bit.
“She was a Matchmaker. She helped arrange marriages back when that is what was done. She said she always tried to find love matches, though sometimes that was more difficult, but she felt it was important. That and she's a hopeless romantic,” Vida shrugged with a touch of affection. “I see you got her message though. She adores being dramatically unfathomable. Bloody nuisance most of the time when she gets going.”
Hamish looked jumpily around as well. “I don't think so. Should we go help Dr. Watson? Oh, man. What if that guy gets violent or crazy?” Hamish froze. He and Blondie looked at each other like proverbial deer in the headlights.
Sherlock could hardly contain himself when he circled one last time and then, without warning, painted a wide, wet stripe up John's shaft with the flat of his tongue, twirling at the tip, and sucking it gently before popping his mouth off.
Sherlock wondered if he could salvage the blanket without having to consult with Mrs Hudson about the washing machine.
“John,” his low rumbling baritone implored, as he held the shirt collar a bit more fiercely over the blonde man's nose and mouth. “Do not move your hands anywhere near your face. If I am correct, we have discovered the murder weapon.”
Dr. Sawyer. I feel like such a twat. Thanks. Thanks so much!” Sherlock beamed painfully at Ms. Dark Roots.
Sherlock moaned as he tried to straighten his legs out. He had been sitting on his heels for the better part of an hour waiting for word from John and for his supplies. Once he had them, he would be able to wrap up the salon murders he had been working on that night. Lestrade thought he was SO amusing with that one. Like Sherlock would have some sort of inside information about the life of hairdressers, just because he took SOME pride in the appearance of his own coiffure.
was he bringing Hamish anywhere NEAR Sherlock. The last thing he needed was deductions that he really didn't want to have to think about. Really.
Why had he never made that connection before? HIS body wash had a rosemary component to it, however blended with cardamom and lemongrass, that he had always found it soothing and sensual.
fine, thanks. Hamish seemed to be fatally embarrassed that he had gone over all wobbly and insisted that he take John to dinner tonight to make up for it. I think Hamish has a bit of a thing for John, actually. He's angling for a cozy dinner at somewhere called The Little Square in Mayfair. A bistro, I think, though he made a reservation. You heard of it?”
John's eyes fluttered shut at the feel of the warm breath from Sherlock's mouth so close to his sensitive neck.
John stopped in his surprise, completely ignoring the tortured innuendo. “Dinner? I couldn't possibly with the way my shoes reek of cat piss right now. I'd get thrown out of anywhere you could think of. Thanks, but no.”
John opened the door to the flat and was met with a contemplative Sherlock resting on the sofa, hands together and tucked just under his chin. He regarded him affectionately as he made a space for himself with Sherlock's head in his lap.
“Both of us seem to have a great affinity for the sense of smell. We find it pleasing and comforting and even arousing.”
Sherlock roused to the sensation of John caressing his arms and back with obvious affection. He was chuckling a bit to himself and Sherlock had to know what he found so amusing.
John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's slim waist, and pulled him flush against his own body. Both men groaned in heady approval.
Why were you kneeling for so long?” John huffed, trying act causally scolding. “Do you know where the hot water bottle is? I'm going to do that up for you to loosen up your muscles.”
Sherlock's face frowned distractedly. “Dr. Watson relayed that he spoke to your grandmother a bit in her native language before he had to defer to your translations.”
“You didn't like my method for gaining further information from Eric?” Sherlock dangerously drawled. His eyes flicked down the John's mouth and back.
Sherlock look relieved. Sarah got up and left the kitchen. She walked by to see if John’s office was empty and accessible - Check. John was courteously walking his patient to the front. She casually re-entered the kitchen.
“What does it say then? I know you opened it and looked up what it says without me already. And what was so amazing about the first one anyway?” John folded his arms across his chest and waited warily. Sherlock slowly stood to take the offered paper. He stepped into John's space, and without consulting the note in his hand, started to speak.
American. Sideburned. Dark curls flopping artfully over one eye. A bit on the thin side. Had it been a difficult for a male nurse to find a post? And a handsome one at that? Did that make office politics a bit more strained for him? John willed Deduction Mode Sherlock out of his head forcibly.
Sherlock took advantage in the moment that followed and snicked open the bottle, twisted and flipped himself on top of John and coated his hand in the thick, fragrant emulsion.
Sherlock ground his hips into John's and rational thought was no longer possible. John kissed him back ferociously until he felt Sherlock pull on his shoulder.
Why did he just get a flash of Sherlock doing exactly that as he stalked out of the room at Bart's in search of his riding crop? John's brain was in danger of system shutdown.
John, who had been frozen since Sherlock had manhandled his own collar over his face, was glad of his military training. Otherwise he would have automatically panicked and thrashed and swung at Sherlock's sudden move to apparently smother him. He could feel the warmth from Sherlock's fingers through the collar and his body heat from the long line of consulting detective pressed almost against him. John silently cursed the awareness and tried to let his mind empty of Sherlock's closeness.
John sank back down into the chair and pinched the bridge of his nose dejectedly. He didn't want to even THINK about how oddly satisfying that had felt. Touching Sherlock. Damn damn damn. This day couldn't get any more messed up.
“Sherlock, I have to ask you, though,” John's voice intoned mellifluously as Sherlock tried to settle himself even more comfortably on John's warm chest.
John dragged the palms of his hands across his tired, achy eyes. He happened to catch a glimpse of his watch as he did so. Shit. He was going to be late for the clinic. Epically late, actually,  if he didn't get a move on right NOW. He hauled his protesting carcass up, went through an abbreviated morning routine, and flew down the stairs as quickly as he could manage. The door shook on its hinges in his wake.
Sarah cocked her head to the side thoughtfully and nodded. “I know you care about him. We all do too,” she added. “Perhaps you should do something about that.” Sarah held her breath and waited.
They fell into easy conversation and the evening passed very pleasantly. John even managed to ignore a few texts from Sherlock, dismissing them to Hamish as being from his “manic flatmate looking for late night shopping services”. John returned to Baker Street a bit tipsy and to a rather stroppy and uncomfortable Sherlock.
Finally done with dressing, John squared his shoulders, came down from his room and called out a quick goodbye to Sherlock as he closed the door and headed down the stairs and out into the street to the clinic.
Sherlock spent the remainder of the evening on the sofa, tirelessly combing the internet for who knows what. John turned on the telly mindlessly, and joined his friend on the neighboring cushion as the younger man absorbed information. At one point, John leaned over to have a look at the screen. He saw tabs filled with maps of Pakistan and Iraq and Iran, Middle Eastern language sites, even an essay on women's social roles in rural post WWII Afghanistan. He sniggered quietly to himself and patted Sherlock's leg, as it was smashed up against his own, in a friendly manner, and went back to whatever idiocy Jeremy Clarkson had been up to.
“Obviously,” deadpanned Sherlock as he rolled his eyes so hard he probably could see into the back of his own skull.
It tasted as sumptuous as it smelled. Yeasty and sharp, with the tang of the garlic and the damnable rosemary.
fucking hot right now, so damn sensitive and responsive, I can hardly stop myself from trying to make you come right in your pants right fucking
John had a moment before his next patient. He dropped heavily into his desk chair, breathed in a deep lungful of air, and rubbed his face.
think, and instinctively thrust his hands into the dark, tangled mass of curls above him and let Sherlock invade his mouth. The flick of the tongue across the seam of his mouth was indescribably mesmerizing and John automatically opened it for more. Their tongues and lips clashed, sliding over and around each other madly; probing and teasing as he could feel his heart racing inside his chest. The taste of him, flooding his mouth, and the spicy, clean smell of Sherlock's skin from the vee of his poncy designer shirt was utterly intoxicating. The kiss was clumsy and artless, but visceral and shockingly intense. John's faintly working brain distantly reckoned that he could never get enough of that feeling. He slid his hands blindly down the long, supple back beneath his fingers and hauled him in closer. A knee came between John's thighs as Sherlock regained his balance and pressed the advantage of leverage.
After donning his white doctor's coat, John walked into the supply room, intending to grab a few of the new nicer patient drapes before they all got picked over. He quickly discovered he wasn't the only one in the cramped room.
Sherlock began to haltingly grind out words between strokes and slides of his mouth on John's and down the sides of his deliciously short neck. He punctuated the words with almost an assault to John's skin.
“Ah, that,” Sherlock grimaced for just an moment and then beamed beatifically at him. “You are always going on about how I finish the milk, so, um, there you are.”
John frantically scanned the street for any signs of a flapping Belstaff or a lanky stretch of leg boarding a taxi.
Another flash of dream memory set upon him. Syllabub. They had tea and scones and a sinfully delightful lemon syllabub swirled with raspberry jam. Sherlock knew how much John enjoyed the fruity jam, so he always endeavored to include it in meals and treats as much as he was able to for him. Raspberries and John just went together. Just like tea and sunshine and the smell of damp wool and the faintly sweet and lingering scent of green herbs and the citrus tang of bergamot…
John paused a moment and waited for some kind of response. Sherlock's head dipped a fraction down as if in benediction. John took that as affirmative, drew Sherlock's face down to his, and gently pressed their lips together.
“I just do. You are the most important person in the world to me and what I feel about you?  God, it's taken me SO damn long to get past the whole, ‘I'm not gay’ thing. I'm not. Not really. I'm not gay, or bi, or any sort of certain category or label.
“You look positively radiant, Mrs. Greene. Can I take your baby bag? It looks terribly heavy. Allow me, please.”
John sunk to the sofa in defeat. He refused to watch a rerun of Gaslight that was on even though he had always loved Ingrid Bergman.
Sherlock stood and walked to corridor that led to the loos. Once inside, he removed the glasses, cardigan, and the hat.  He fluffed his curls by shaking them up to the roots and extracted the Belstaff from the messenger bag. A quick look in the mirror verified his transformation. Satisfactory. He went back out to the waiting area and took a different seat.
Hamish straightened a bit on his bar stool and smiled. “I'm finishing my certification to be a nurse anesthetist. Bart's has a program that funnels medical personnel to humanitarian organizations around the world and that's what brought me here, That and the fact that I have some family I can sponge off of.” He paused and took a sip from the glass he was toying with again. “I can get my certification and have a clear path to join Doctors Without Borders. You wouldn't believe how competitive it is to be involved in medical humanitarian work. Luckily, I speak French, which is really in high demand -  Arabic is the other one they want. The NHS is obligated by the EU to send a certain percentage of medical personnel to help aid groups, so I enlisted, as it were. I guess it's like signing up for the military on work study. They didn't care that I was American to be in the program, so they get to exploit me a bit and use me a while I'm here to fill in for warm bodies within their system. So, here I am. Lucky you, Dr. Watson.”
“Fine, Sherlock. Whatever. But believe me, you were doing more in that dream that having a tea party. Now I'm going to bed. YOU clean up for a change.”
“You are your brain, John. And your cock just has to convince you that this will be BRILLIANT if you let it. It wants this too, just as much as I do. ”
John smacked a soft kiss on Sherlock's shoulder as they relaxed, lost in their own thoughts and content in the shift their lives had just taken.
Sherlock realized what he had just done. He had just compared Hamish to himself physically and gone right for the throat. How Neanderthal.
