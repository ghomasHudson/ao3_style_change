She left the shop a little while after she’d finished with his phone, waiting by the door to ask him and make sure that he really didn’t need her to stay.
They waited until nine thirty before she arrived, her girlfriend in tow. Dean looked at him with question in his eyes, as if he was asking if this was his ex wife. Almost ex wife. Soon to be ex wife.
“Watch it.” Dean was grinning now, though. If Dean hadn’t been holding Claire, Cas was sure that he would have gotten smacked in the head. “What about you?”
If anything, if Dean didn’t love it so much, Cas wished that he would do something else. If he didn’t know that he poured his heart and soul into it. But if Dean loved it, he supported him.
Claire was back at the house with Dean and Cas kept telling himself that is was fine. Even though his heart had been heavy when leaving, he trusted Dean. It was only for an hour or two, they’d be back together soon.
Neither the cot nor his arms seemed to be good options when she was hooked up to the machines though. In the crib, she cried and made the alarms go off every couple of minutes. When she slept in his arms, she kept finding ways to kick the wires off. Both were much to the dismay of the nurses who had to come back and check on them. Eventually, she’d fallen asleep and they’d cleared her. Finally, she could sleep with just the oxygen monitor on her foot.
“Oh.” Dean realised it at the same moment that he did. “What will you have to do?”
She was cold, so terribly cold. Her body hung limp in his arms, the teddybear fallling to the ground, pacifier now fully out of her mouth. He made his way to the door, almost burned his hand trying to touch it. It was searing. Soon, it too would go up in flames.
Cas had taken a liking to him though. He knew virtually nothing about him, yet something about the way that he’d been with his kid and the way that he held himself intrigued him.
It was silent on the other end of the line. “You hadn’t signed the paperwork yet?” Cas was aware of the fact that it had been a couple of weeks. “Of course you hadn’t.”
“We’d been together for a year, just moved to the house. We always joked she got pregnant the day we moved into the house.” Cas didn’t quite know when the pregnancy had really changed things. “It wasn’t nice, you know? Because at first she was very hormonal and emotional and we fought a lot.” He remembered the fight over leaving the jam on the counter by accident and how she hadn’t spoken to him for four days. “I even slept on the couch a couple of nights. Still don’t know what I did wrong there.”
It was well past two when all the families finally left. A couple stuck around, talking to Charlie as their kids browsed books or snuggled with the big teddy bears. Cas had withdrawn himself for a moment to the break room, just to get a snack and a drink in him. To catch just a little bit of a break.
“They cleared her,” Cas said as he put a new diaper under her. “Told me just as I came back to the room.” It had been a pleasant surprise, the first inkling of good news after the last couple of hours.
It was a habit that had started in the last year, right after he had opened the bookstore. Slowly, it had become as much of a habit to the people surrounding him as it had to him. Even though there was a varying public, the same faces kept showing up. If anything, it was part of what made him happy - people liked him enough to return.
I run 'long side the car turning numb to the sound.
“That’s the one,” Dean confirmed. “Actually, this is ours, too.” He reached out for the green pacifier. “I have a spare but. Thanks again man, you really saved my night here.”
He had to admit, it made him chuckle just a little.
“Me neither.” He really, really hadn’t. They’d always been good friends, from the moment they met. They’d been seven and Cas had just moved to the neighborhood. Within weeks, the boys became best friends. Whenever you saw Cas, Dean wasn’t too far off and vica versa.
“That doesn’t sound okay, man,” Dean said. Claire was somehow still asleep on his chest, her hand clasped around the hem of his shirt. It made Cas’s heart melt and a grin form on his face.
“The number you’re trying to reach is currently unavailable. Please leave-” He had expected her to pick up, but still, it hurt. Not even her voice - a random computer telling him.
Castiel got distracted before he could even properly start the car, the radio softly playing in the background. There were two all too familiar figures walking past him, or at least, one of them. He recognised the new father from the store - Dean. The one with the gorgeous smile and the sleeping kid.
It hadn’t always been easy. Cas remembered vividly the day that they paid a final visit to the piece of land the house had sat on. They’d toyed with it, with rebuilding the house, with moving there, all three of them. They could make a home all for themselves, specific for what they needed.
That there might be a day that his colleagues called to say something terrible had happened. If they would even call. As much as they knew that Dean had a roommate, he knew that Dean hadn’t gone into a lot of specifics.
He needed to be alone sometimes - to just sit and think and connect. With his feet buried in the sand, he felt more at home than at his parents’ house, at his siblings’. There was no searching and questioning looks thrown his way here. No sly remarks made to him.
Some days, they stayed up until nine and talked about what happened that night. Especially if Dean had had a rough fire. Cas remembered when someone in his team had gotten trapped under a beam that had fallen down. He’d broken his leg, but gotten lucky with that being his only injury.
“Listen, I am not calling you to get yelled at.” He didn’t have the energy to fight with her. Not with Claire starting to stir in her bassinette. “I just need you to get the paperwork my way and come sign the papers. Why didn’t you call me back?”
He told himself the words over and over and over until he could not imagine not thinking it.
They’d gotten to the diner early. Meg had said around nine and they’d arrived at eight thirty. Just in case she would arrive early. Just in case they might otherwise miss her. The bad news was that Cas had already had two cups of coffee before Dean had told him to lay off and ordered him a tea.
Today had been a calmer day when it came to tasks, which was the biggest reason he’d asked Charlie to leave early. It didn’t mean that today he felt any less exhaustion. By seven pm, when he was finally closing up shop, he felt it in his bones.
Cas hadn’t told his brother yet, hadn’t had the heart to say that she’d walked out on them, that he was still hoping for her to come back to them.
Through doing it, he had built up a connection to not only the parents, but also the children. They waved when they met him on the street and sometimes, the kids would hand over drawings at the beginning of their reading hour that he put on his fridge.
He couldn’t say just how glad he was now about that quirk. There was some soot on the car and some of the things they stored in the garage because of the smoke getting in. Apart from that, everything seemed to be okay.
“I don’t know,” Ellie whispered back at him, her little sing song voice cutting through the tension in the room. “You know?”
He grasped at empty sheets, his hand falling off the edge of the single bed. It all came raining down on him like a thunderstorm breaking through: the fire, the memories of her leaving, everything.
Dean sat up sleepily when Claire eventually stirred and whined. It was clear that he really wasn’t awake and if anything, Cas loved it. He wished he could stay in this moment forever. That Dean could be sleepy and cute and Claire small and that he didn’t have to make the scary jump into the unknown.
he thought to himself. They had never been that. Part of him was glad that at least with this girl, she was different. That this girl wouldn’t get the same treatment as him. He wouldn’t wish that on anyone.
“Of course.”
from falling asleep the way he had, perched awkwardly on the pillow.
“What about Charlie, are you guys still friends?” Charlie had been one of the only people he’d kept in contact with, mostly because she had kept messaging him and bugging him. He’d enjoyed that she did regardless.
Mary Winchester opened the door, a smile lifting her lips when she saw her son standing there. Castiel allowed himself a good look at her as she pulled Dean into her arms. It had been too long since he’d seen her. She’d aged, but she’d done so gracefully.
Gabe didn’t talk about him a lot. After it happened, it became an unspoken rule not to bring it up. Cas remembered too clearly the way it had affected his brother in the months afterwards. How much it had hurt Gabe when they announced that Meg was pregnant.
Cas didn’t know what to say to that. It was an amazing offer. He couldn’t refuse something like that. Even though it was more than he deserved, from someone who hadn’t spoken to him in years.
After a while she had also done that when she wanted him there. He would say something and he would hurt her with it, but she would refuse to explain. She would refuse to say what was going on. She refused to have anything to do with him, going as far as being in separate rooms at all times.
Cas didn’t know what to say, how to even start with explaining the mess that his life was just about to become.
“Yeah?” she answered, curiously poking her head out from behind a bookshelf. With most of the pillows now sorted and back on the couch, she’d gone back to stocking the shelves and making things look nice. “What is it?”
Before going in for the night, Cas stood and watched as Dean walked up the road across from him and disappeared into the trees. Not long after, the porch lights turned on and he could see the faint shadow of a guy carrying a stroller up the steps. It had to be Dean who was renting the cabin, who would be his neighbor for the next two weeks.
Without wanting to, Cas clutched the handle of the carrier a little tighter in his hand. “I’m sorry too.” He didn’t know what to say. In the darkness, it had all seemed
“Hey, I’m tired,” he mumbled, looking away from Dean, who now had his cat on his lap. “Would it be okay if I go and have a nap?”
For a moment, he said nothing. Dean just sat down on the couch next to him and leaned into him. Cas moved his arm so he could lean in closer. When Dean didn’t speak, Cas ran his fingers through Dean’s hair slowly. It smelled like Peppermint. It had been a shampoo Sam had gotten for him for his birthday and Dean was still using it, as much as he hated the smell. Personally, Cas loved it.
Cas had moved away again during their final year of high school, because his parents job took them all over. Somehow, they hadn’t kept in touch, Cas didn’t know why.
In seventy years, every single soul in his family had presented their gift before the age of twenty. Most of them started young. He remembered how his brother had been barely two and he seven, and how the teacup in front of him had hovered in the air. It had risen steadily in a straight line before going straight for his brother, who had taken it with a smile and just about managed to not drop it in his lap.
“You better help,” she said, throwing a pillow in his direction. “Here’s number one.”
God, he wanted to kiss him.
“I think Sadie knows,” he said, eyes once more flicking up to the person coming in, almost expecting it to be someone he knew. And yet, it wasn’t. It was a stranger. The guy sat in the back of the group, a brown haired kid sitting in his lap, stuffed animal pressed closely against his chest. The boy stared at Cas intently, pressing back just a little bit against the man’s shirt.
okay. She actually made it sound as if just he was supposed to be okay. Didn’t ask about her daughter. “I’m fine. Claire had to be in hospital for a night but she’s fine. It’s not why I called, though.”
It was then he smelled the smoke. The all too familiar smoke. It was then that he heard the crackling of flames, could feel the heat of them. They were licking at the door, the smoke quickly billowing from underneath it. He reached for his daughter, his heart beating out of his chest, arms trembling. His lungs aching, closing in on him.
“Is this better? Or do you want a bottle too? Is it the time for both, huh?” It was her time for both. Usually, Claire wasn’t too bothered by wet diapers and she would wait until her next feed to get them changed. Cas couldn’t blame Dean for that being his first instinct.
He stood there, ready to let himself fall. He felt gravity pulling at his body, pulling it down, down, down. He had to, he had to keep them safe, he had to.
Dean had still been shook by it, and had taken an hour just sitting there, staring at his cup of coffee, before he’d started on the toast and even then, they barely talked. Dean didn’t say anything before going to bed, and ignored it afterwards.
He ate in silence and watched as Dean walked down the road with Ben. It was dead quiet, only the distant sounds of birds were audible. So it had worked and the boy had fallen asleep.
He disregarded the porch lights. If they’d found the place they were smart people, they could fend for themselves.
“I’ll see if I can lend you something.”
Dean was just sleepy, had confused him with someone else but didn’t want to act on it further. Maybe he just hadn’t wanted to make things awkward between them. Because Cas knew that would make things weird. They had
The Winchester family had slowly become the only family he had after his parents had found out about him being into guys too and promptly ignored him. He hadn’t spoken to them since the only comment on his wedding was that as much as they hated Meg, at least she wasn’t a guy. But the Winchesters were that for him now. Family. Dean was family, but not in the way Cas wanted him to be.
They’d had long conversations, while Claire scooted around and bothered Trix. Or while Claire napped during lunch hour. It was no secret that the space meant a lot to Cas. It had been the place where he had brought Claire home. The place where he’d, for the very first time, tried to build a home for himself.
He didn’t want to talk about the way his heart skipped a beat at any weird noise or how he was still smelling the smoke even though they were hours and miles away from the place. How he felt uncomfortable in his own clothes.
He’d be escaping the feeling that he was a stranger in his own home and he would exchange it for the feeling that he didn’t even have a home anymore.
“Thanks, man.” It was clear that Dean felt a little uncomfortable underneath it all, even though there really was no reason to be.
“No, of course.” Dean squeezed his shoulder. “Come downstairs, with me, have a drink.”
“Claire.” She was still asleep in the stroller, stirring occasionally. Mary didn’t ask about her mom, didn’t see for a wedding ring. She must have known from Dean that it was a sensitive subject.
When Dean had been out sick, they’d call and ask him how he was. Cas only had Dean who would do that for him.
Cas wondered if she ever had been.
Despite the clean and clinical feel of the hospital and the smell of disinfectant everywhere, he still smelled the burning. There was still the sense that something was on fire, that there was smoke in the air. He kept looking around, wondering, waiting. Looking for the smoke, looking for the heat of the flames.
Castiel vividly remembered the few times that he hadn’t been able to come, because he’d had school work, because he was working on his thesis. “She always used to be different if I disappointed her, which I get. She got disappointed, you know.”
She had been one of the constants during their childhoods: eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in the sun on a hot summer’s day, movie evenings with Sam, Dean and their mother, staying up too late on sleepovers.
When this summertime ends, we will not part as friends,
“I mean. The house is in ruins and I have no clue how I’m going to pay for a motel for more than a few weeks.” It came out harsher and more bitter than he’d intended to. Dean had done nothing wrong, he shouldn’t take it out on him. In fact, he’d been the saviour for him in more than one way. “Not great, but we’re trying and figuring something out.” He was attempting to, at least.
“I don’t know.” Cas took a sip of his beer before answering. “They want Meg’s signature on the paperwork as well.”
“I don’t know,” he had shrugged. It was too complicated right now. “I’m not really thinking. Divorce isn’t pretty.” He hadn’t known why he told Sam. “But no.”
“Still like before, huh?” Sam had asked, looking at Cas for a second. “Did you ever tell him?”
It dawned on Cas that it had been years since he’d seen him like this. When they were younger, they’d had plenty of sleepovers, where mom Winchester would make them pancakes in the morning if it was the weekend, or they would rush out of the house to go school. Even as a kid, Dean’s hair had been tousled just like this with one side of his hair flat as a board and the other standing up in the oddest angles when he got out of bed in the morning.
thing going on. Their good thing, despite the circumstances.
“Why don’t you just come with?” Cas asked, car keys in one hand, the keys to the store already in the other. “I only just closed the shop, I’ll quickly open it up again, that’s no problem.” Considering that Dean wasn’t a paying customer but just needed to grab something, it wasn’t too big a deal. Yes, he’d be home later and his stomach was growling at him, asking for food as was, but he couldn’t bring himself to mind.
Castiel was happy to lock the bookstore door behind him. After checking one last time that he had indeed turned on the alarm system, he threw the keys in his tote bag. He’d been self conscious about carrying it around at first. People would stare at him and even his mother had asked him why he was carrying the thing around. It didn’t matter to him: it was a practical way to get all of his stuff from point a to point b without having to carry around a full backpack.
It hadn’t been that for her, and somehow, realising that afterwards
The house had been a home to Cas. To Cas, it had meant a warm and comfy place, where he could relax on the couch with his wife. Where he could have a glass of wine with her and watch a movie, or sit outside and talk. Where he felt like he could be whoever he wanted to be.
“Oh, look, she’s in an ocean!” Castiel said, focusing his attention back on reading and the story. “She’s a pirate.”
Maybe he’d left the phone accidentally and they’d gone out for breakfast and he couldn’t reach him. That would make sense, right?
He knew the pain of screaming kids the entire night because the parents either forgot to say something or they just missed them more than well enough. It wasn’t easy or nice and if he could save Dean’s rest, that would be completely worth it.
“A little grey dog. It smells like his mom, which is why he wants it.”
“I’m sorry,” Dean sighed, rocking the stroller back and forth, “no matter what I try, he doesn’t want to go back to sleep. He’s been crying bloody murder and driving me crazy.”
Cas had never thought about this much. He knew the tension between them. He knew that some nights, he was afraid to touch her wrong. But the in between moments had been so great. They almost overshadowed the rest.
“Hey, Meg. Something has happened. Can you call me back? It’s important.” He didn’t care for a second that he didn’t go into more detail, that he could worry her.
“It can sometimes do that to kids,” Cas admitted, “and I won’t take it personally - that I promise you. Are you staying for long?”
.•° ✿ °•.
Gabe stood awkwardly in the door now, not speaking as Cas changed Claire’s diaper.
Maybe it was just the company he had needed. Not being alone with a crying baby that wanted things all the time. Maybe it was that. He truly didn’t know. He didn’t know a lot right now.
“It somehow feels even worse the second time around.” It had taken Cas a while to open the papers when he had first gotten them, together with her wedding ring. For days they’d lingered on the kitchen counter while Cas tried to get his life in order. He’d felt lost without Meg, as if part of him was missing. He had to build an entire new routine without her in his life. And it had sucked. Now he had the routine, as shattered as it was right now, and it sucked to have to give it up again, possibly.
“You’re cute with her,” Cas mumbled, full on blaming the sleepiness for the fact that he allowed the words to roll over his lips. “Thank you.”
That night they fell asleep on the couch. It was one am when the baby monitor lit up and Claire’s shrieking cries sounded through the living room. Cas’s neck
Just thinking about it made Cas’s heart clench. He didn’t know what he was doing, didn’t know what kind of things to take into account. Didn’t know where to go with what information.
Cas now had a completely different theory on why she hadn’t wanted to go. He thought that she had known she didn’t want to be a mom all along, that she didn’t want Claire to be born.
Cas was almost proud of that as he threw out the pizza box outside and grabbed his stuff from the table. He was well overdue for a nice, long sleep hopefully without getting disturbed. No alarm in the morning trying to get him to get up before his brain wants to, no work traffic. Just a nice relaxing day with a book to look forward to.
After being friends for so long, it almost seemed natural, to bounce back. To talk for hours and catch each other up. To instantly be friends again.
Once the days grew longer and warmer, they sat outside with Claire in their arms and Trix curled up in Claire’s stroller. The cat had long ago decided that, whenever the crying human wasn’t in it, it was the perfect place to sleep. With a warm cup of coffee and breakfast, they’d watch the birds flying around and listen to their chirps.
It was like a slap to the face, a cold shower. He didn’t think he’d ever truly realised that, not until this. Not until this happened.
Cas fell silent for a little bit. He didn’t quite know what to say to that. Inside, he knew Dean was right. He had to do it and get it over with so he could move on. On the other hand, as long as it didn’t, he was okay. Things were okay.
He’d gone out two days ago to the office, to get things sorted, pick up some paperwork. They allowed him to work from home for now, understanding that he had a lot to deal with. Some arrangements had to be made to make it possible. He’d been set up with a replacement laptop, since his had gone down with the house. They ordered a brand new one for him, but for now, the replacement had to do.
She had packed up her bags late one night when he was working overtime, brought Claire over to the office with the excuse that she needed to run an errand and couldn’t take her with her, and left. He’d never been so angry. So hurt. Cas couldn’t describe what he had felt those first days.
“We’re sorry,” he repeated, “but without your wife’s signature, we’re afraid we can’t proceed with the claim.”
“Good night, Dean.” He was walking towards the stairs, but seemed to hesitate on the first step. It felt weird, somehow, saying good night like this. “Dean?”
By the time he finished up the story, the boy was fast asleep in his father’s lap, fingers twisted in the fabric of his shirt. Cas had done his best to stay with the kids and the story, to stay invested, but every once in a while, he’d noticed his attention slipping latecomer.
Cas pretended to be asleep as Dean came downstairs with her and fed her. Only when he accidentally dropped the remote from the side of the couch did Cas open his eyes.
Cas wanted to share his bed and wake up with him, wanted to be able to ruffle his hair and kiss his cheek and his nose and his lips. Wanted to be fathers, together. Unless he stopped being a chicken and asked Dean, he knew that wouldn’t happen.
He didn’t think he was ready to face that. Not yet. He’d not gotten over her and the confrontation would only bring everything back. He was almost sure of it. Almost.
The rest of the family was different. Gabriel refused to understand - his mother refused to even think about it or give it a chance. He was happy with the way things were. He had a life, a steady income, his own bookstore. A life that he was slowly building for himself. In between the moments where his family pushed him, he actually thought that he was starting to be comfortable with the place that he was in in life.
“She’s here,” Cas said, but his voice was thick with emotion. All he could think was: oh, he cares about her. He cares. And that was a wild thought, a reassuring thought. Something he loved with his entire heart. “She’s safe.”
“Thank you.” He didn’t know what else to say. He could have lost her. But because of Dean, he didn’t. “You.” He shook his head. “You saved her life.”
“Years.” There were two cars out front. Cas wasn’t sure if the Winchesters had for some reason invested in another car, or if Mary Winchester had visitors. Part of him hoped that she wouldn’t have company. It would feel awkward as is, not having seen her in such a long time. Being around strangers would make it worse. Still, it would be nice to spend some time together with Mary. Regardless of others being there.
Maybe he should have opened them a long time ago. Yes, he had seen Dean feed her before, but somehow, it tugged on his heart strings that he had become so tender with her. When she was done, he laid her against his chest, where she promptly fell asleep.
He pulled the door of his own house closed and locked it behind him.
“Yeah.”
“How was it?” Dean settled down in the single seater next to the couch.
is that beautiful things never last,
“I’m going to go sleep,” Dean mumbled, before making his way upstairs. Cas was still too preoccupied with just how good Dean’s lips had felt against his. Just how right they had been. He’d longed for his hands on his waist and his fingers in his hair, longed for the kiss to be longer. Wanted to kiss him again and again until their lips started tingling.
“Hey,” Dean said quietly, opening the door for him. “She fell asleep in the bouncer.” His hair was tousled in the way that made Cas wonder if he’d taken a nap when she did. “She’s been an angel, though. Very different from Ruby when she was younger. She’d scream your ears off.”
“Yes ma’am,” he said and couldn’t help but smile at her too. She pulled him into a hug. “Not so little anymore.”
Cas almost felt his stomach turn.
Her face had fallen a little, and the crows feet had gotten more pronounced. The smile on her lips was still the same, though, and the way her eyes lit up when she was around her son. Her hair was still cut the same way, and even though her clothes fit differently and were different, it was still her.
It was adorable, really. How much his friend wanted to help him. Sometimes, Cas thought back at how two months ago, they hadn’t seen each other in over three years. Now, it felt as if they’d never been apart.
In the dark, it took him a minute to recognise him. “Cas? Hi.” He seemed surprised to see him there, which Cas couldn’t blame him for. It was a random hour to meet here again in the best of scenarios. Especially after they met only so briefly.
It was where they’d brought Claire home for the very first time and where they’d spent their wedding night. It was where he was supposed to teach Claire how to walk and talk and where he and Meg were supposed to grow old. They were supposed to dance around, all three of them, laughing and goofing out.
He called Gabriel on his way back inside. It was that that he hadn’t wanted to do. Even though he and his brother didn’t necessarily had a bad relationship, they still hadn’t talked in months. He didn’t want the only times that they called to be because one of them needed something. The last time they talked, he’d helped his brother move to his new house. As much as the move was tense and different, it had felt nice to connect with someone. That was the last time he’d seen anyone in their family. Still, he expected the call to go to voicemail.
“We had to call in people on call to come help us, the flames were pretty close to getting to the other houses.” Cas could imagine it as Dean told the story. He had been there before. For a moment he could get a flash of his old house, engulfed in flames. “We were there for hours. Wrapped up around eight. We. We thought we got everyone out. Then they discovered a body by the front door. She was so burned up. The mom.”
“Hey, baby,” he heard a distorted voice on the baby monitor. “What’s up?” He heard the creaking of the crib as the bars were lowered, her cries seeming to be coming from further away. “Oh. I see. Should’ve woken up Cas, huh.”
“Let’s just get through the night, Claire,” he mumbled, “we’ll see where we go from there.”
It’s only when Dean pulled back that Cas could see him stiffen up, as if reality finally caught up with him, crash landed into his garage. His hand went limp, fell to his side.
“It was my pleasure,” Cas answered, escorting Dean out the door. He turned off all the lights again and turned on the alarm system, and locked the door for the second time that evening. “I hope you’ll have a good night and that he’ll fall asleep soon. I’m hoping to see you again next Monday, same place and time. If you enjoyed it.”
He hadn’t noticed it the first time around, but he would need some time to get used to the silence of the room and the house. Their house had been right next to the train tracks. Even during the nights, he could hear the loud rumble of the transport trains, the horns blaring.
“Cas? I have you on speaker.”
Castiel got home half an hour later, pizza in hand. He didn’t even bother unlocking the door or putting his things inside before falling down on the porch chair and lighting a cigarette. It felt like ages since he’d taken a smoke break and even though he hated it, he knew it was a habit and he could enjoy it.
He still didn’t know what it would do to him. “I mean, we’re getting a divorce. No, it’s not on bad terms but-”
“Nice to meet you,” Cas said with a soft smile. “Castiel, but please call me Cas. Will I be seeing you again next week?” It was forward of him, but he always enjoyed seeing new faces. Especially if they were cute, like Dean’s.
Even as a kid, Cas had been mesmerised by it. Then, when things changed between them, he’d thought it was cute. Right now, with Dean clutching the cup in his hands, he couldn’t help but think it was still cute. Especially in this house. Somehow, the cluttered atmosphere fit Dean. It was a mix of Mary’s nick-nacks everywhere and a cleaner, more indie feel. As much as Cas hadn’t expected it from Dean, he liked it.
It was a couple days later that Dean eventually asked him what was happening with the insurance paperwork. Dean had known that Cas had gone and had also known that Cas had promised to talk about it.
That shit was reserved for movies, he realised now. Things didn’t magically feel okay. Yes, they felt awkward. Just sitting at the table together, Dean’s cat asleep on the window sill, made the air feel thick with tension. He could almost cut it.
now. That it could be restored, built up again. That maybe things wouldn’t be as bad. Maybe something could be salvaged. “We’ll have to go some place for a while.”
It did mean that Mondays were extra exhausting for him. He didn’t know what exactly it was that was the final drop that made the bucket spill - if it was the cleaning or the reading hour or the small easy tasks that seemed to be coming and coming and coming.
“I’ll need to make a call to insurance.” It should be covered. With a house that old, they’d taken care to take insurance out on it, specifically for fires. Meg had always had a feeling something might happen. Sure, they hadn’t known what; she simply hadn’t seemed to trust the house.
“I don’t know. If anything, it’s not the most important thing.” He had to get the insurance taken care of, he had to figure out how he could continue to work and look after Claire, figure out where they would stay in the long run. Yes, Dean was letting them stay for now, but he couldn’t continue to do that until the house was rebuilt, or until he somehow got the credit to rent out a new place.
He wouldn’t blame her if she had. If she’d wanted to put everything behind and start a new life. She’d made it seem with the way she left that they were just a blip in her existence. Something to just take out like trash. He couldn’t keep himself from glossing over that part, almost ignoring that she had. Yes, he hated it, but at the same time, he loved her. He probably still loved her.
Castiel decided to start in the far corner, where the strollers were stored. One way or another, there were always pillows that landed there. Even though they tried to monitor and keep everything in the designated area, he knew that with kids, it was almost impossible to keep things the way they were.
“I mean, it’s okay? Better he figure it out now than in a couple of years.” Which was also true. Better than figuring it out when you had a kid and a husband. Better than leaving and never coming back. “And it’s a while ago. I’m over it.”
They didn’t talk about it further that night, Dean took the hint. Cas knew that he shouldn’t push it off forever - he should call her and let her know. In all forms of the way, it still was her house too, right now. As fucked up as it felt. He should tell her.
“Meg,” he said, his voice more bitter than he meant for it to be. “It’s been a long time.” It had been months.
Dean’s lips were soft and still tasted like the coffee that he had drank probably hours before. His hand was hot against his skin, just a little rough.
“Anything else, Cas, and I’ll do it,” she promised him, before they hung up the phone and she went back to sleep. He couldn’t blame her - part of him wished that he could do so, too. But he couldn’t, he was too wide awake, despite the lack of sleep.
She’d have to open the shop by herself the day after and stay until closing so it wasn’t like she didn’t deserve to leave a little earlier than usual. They’d had the same arrangement from day one. Most days, they were both at the shop, doing the random tasks that needed to be done but no one seemed to have time for otherwise. It meant the shop was clean and orderly and that people always remarked on how nice it was when they came in.
“Electrical fire. The entire house burned to a crisp.” Are
He knew that it was late, and if anything were to happen he’d have no means to call for help. It felt strange, not having a phone on him after years of having it glued to his hand.
“Thank you,” she said and for the first time in a long time, she sounded sincere. “We’ll be able to move on. Don’t take any offence, but I can’t wait to not have to spend my days knowing I’m still your wife.”
He’d called her up in a fury - with the conversation getting heavier and heavier and heavier, until they were yelling at each other. Their insults became petty, comebacks nonsensical. They’d gotten themselves trapped in the same old place, where there was nothing but anger and frustration.
Staring her in the eyes, Meg felt different. As their relationship moved on, her eyes had gotten harder and harder. The soft looks were getting fewer and fewer. The last couple of months, Cas realised, they’d barely looked at each other at all.
The professor was lecturing and asking questions that Dean knew the answers to while no one else did, but he did not answer them, he kept on doodling and he never once looked up from his notebook until the lecture finished.
Castiel rolled his eyes “one less problem? You’re a whole new set of a 99 problems” he mumbled then existed the email not looking at the document attached because he knew it wasn’t the final one so he moved up to the next one.
“Meg what have you done!” Aaron exclaimed as soon as the elevator’s doors closed. “it’s your boyfriend! He is the leak who else could it be!”
“exactly. Did you know that Dean the CEO has reached out to me?”
They stay silent for few seconds then Dean says disappointedly “why Meg? I really expected this from anyone else, but not you”
A tear fell down Meg’s face “I was just having a stressful week and this guy I’ve been talking to was there and- and I wanted to vent and talk to someone whom I’ve been talking to for two months, I did not expect anything, he told me he was a painter and-“ she gulps dow5n and tears her eyes away from Dean, feeling no need to explain the rest because it was obvious to her that Dean figured it out.
For another two weeks Dean only barely wakes, hardly moves, doesn’t seem to receive anything Sam says. His expression remains vacant. His waking is unpredictable and it keeps Sam hungry and exhausted at his side until the other start taking shifts to watch him. They feed him, update him on what’s going on in the world, but after the first time one of them dares to try and gets a teary, livid tirade in response none of them attempt to convince Sam to take a night off. Sam refused to leave, just in case.
“first of all, he is not my boyfriend, just someone that I’ve been talking to and had a one-night stand with, don’t associate me with him. Second of all, he is a painter, why the fuck would he leak what I had told him?” Meg whispered nervously to Aaron who was freaking out. “someone else must’ve leaked it”
Cas immediately looked up at Dean who was looking down “of course I like having intercourse with you” Dean looked up and responded “then why won’t you sleep with me? It does not make sense. There must be something wrong, is it because I tease you a lot?”
“Meg for fuck’s sake, who else? I know for sure it isn’t me, why the hell did you ever tell this random dude that?”
Meg bit her bottom lip and glanced away “remember that article that came out one month ago? About the sexual harassment in the workplace about the incident that happened in the Seattle branch? Now that I think of it.. it probably him too… but I never suspected him because everyone knew about it and anyone could’ve talked about it”
stay tuned for chapter 3, the last chapter.
“don’t you think this is a personal question?” Dean asks
Dean always wanted to see Cas’s eyes without the sadness that conquered them, and now he is looking at the same blues, they are not big, they’re not glinting with tears and pain, they are sharp, focused, and out of emotion, he cannot detect any pain, and happiness, anything in them. And it’s much worse than when his eyes were held by pain, it scared him.
“Castiel Novak?” Dean asks and Meg nods
“.. why?” Dean asked the question he was terrified to ask
“I am sorry Dr. Novak but I had forgotten to conclude my research, this is the final document.   –Dean Winchester”
Dean has just gotten back from cursing around the town with his friends, they usually did that after school finishes, he wanted to have as much fun as possible now before his senior year requires a whole lot of studying. He opened the front door to his house at 6:30 m and walked straight to the living room where his little brother Sam was playing video games with his friend Cas. He took off his leather jacket and threw it over his little brother’s head and grinned “hello Sammy”
The journalist tried to seem as put together as much as possible, but the thought of him standing next to Dean, talking to Dean, breathing the same air as Dean, was suffocating him, it didn’t matter how much he got himself ready for this day, he was a complete wreck.
Dean stared blankly at his professor, he did not expect this at all. He did not know how to respond to that but his eyes watered a little, though no tears rolled down, no matter how much they wanted to. All his life, Dean worked hard, for himself and his little brother with only little help from his uncle Bobby. he worked very very hard, he studied a lot and did tens of part time jobs, and this is the first time anyone have ever told that they’re proud of him.
“this sounds a bit childish, don’t you think it’s YOUR job to fix YOUR company?”
“the version I have just sent you is the version I first made without a conclusion I am extremely sorry I do not know what is wrong with me and I am extremely embarrassed with myself, here is the final one. I am sorry again.  –Dean Winchester”
“your employees hate you” Castiel said bluntly
“we told you already we didn’t leak-“
Dean frowned “why?”
“yup” Cas answers, still not taking his eyes off his phone.
“sory abt it here si the asignmet  –dean winc”
“good.”
“well, never come in my room without my permission, now go play with Sammy” Dean pushed him towards the door lightly but Cas stopped.
“what do you have to say for yourself?” Dean asked, feeling extremely pissed at Cas for not opening up to him about whatever’s happening.
They stay silent and just stare at each other’s faces, Cas with empty expressions and Dean with all the expressions that his emotions produce.
Cas felt so weird whenever he walked by and saw them kissing, his stomach twisted and it wasn’t just because he was jealous, which of course he was, but also because whenever he saw them making out he would picture a pile of plastic melting over low heat, creating the worse smell ever, it made him nauseous.
Castiel knew he liked Dean. He knew that whenever he saw any couple on the TV he imagines them to be him and Dean, but he never admitted it to anyone because it’s not normal to fall in love with a man, especially considering the fact that he is dating the most popular girl in the school, Beth.
Professor Castiel stared at his laptop silently as the sounds indicating he got a new email rang one after another not stopping until the 10th email. He sighed and pressed his hand to his face because he knew exactly what was happening. The professor has told his students today about an assignment due on March, it is January now. But of course, Winchester who has taken a class with the same professor before, will do his work the same day as the announcement, and it would be a mess, and because it would be a mess, the student will notice every minute a new mistake, fix it, then send the work again. Today he sent it 7 times and professor Novak is cursing himself for existing and becoming an educator because of course he’ll meet this kind of very weird students.
now it was the professor’s time to cut him off “stop it, Dean.” He demanded and the student stopped rambling and looked down. Dr. Novak sighed and continued “I understand, a mistake like this can happen, do not beat yourself too much about it, alright?” Dean quickly looked at the professor’s face, he did not expect the professor to say that. “I am just concerned for you, look, you did not interact in class today whatsoever and you did not seem to be focused, and I am afraid that this incident would affect you academically. You are a very bright student Dean, and you have so much potential. I do not want you to drop out of this class because it will miss up your graduation plan. You have come so far and I am very proud of you, don’t mess it up now”
“I think the CFO of the company exaggerated that, it was one machine that exploded, it was in the warehouse and it was going through a test. We examine our machines thoroughly before putting them out for use.”
“and what does that mean?” Dean asked
______
Cas swallowed and mumbled “no.. I like that”
it’s been a year since Cas first knew Dean, after their encounter at the park, the two didn’t talk that much, only greetings and little smiles. Cas met Sam in school and became his friend. And since the school was huge it had two sections, one for middle school kids and one for high school students, which meant that Cas got to see Dean in the hallways, got to see his friends and how he is normally like with other people who are not his brother.
“I told you to not call me that!” Sam exclaimed and threw the jacket back to his older brother then shifted his attention back at the video game.
_____
Castiel looks with no expressions at Dean, he never talks first, the other party has to start the conversation, but Dean doesn’t, he just stares at those blues.
let me know if you want chapter 3! enjoyy
He sat on his desk and looked at his reflection on the closed black screen, he doesn’t know why, but he dressed well today to meet this Novak.
“um so, I realized I accidently deleted the last paragraph while adding the conclusion, I am very very sorry and I promise you this is the last email I am sending.  –Dean Winchester”
Dean glares at Castiel “no. I am not.”
“man.. this sucks, why don’t you complain to Human resources?”
“you’re not helping, Beth,” Dean said while grinding his teeth.
“and.. you knew this since when?”
the professor exchanged his smile with another one “what you do in your personal life is none of my business, all I care about is that you’re a good student” he said as he stood up and started collecting his stuff “alright now that we got that out of the way, see you next week, alright?” he looked at Dean who nodded at him.
“yeah I guess so, this newbie rocky child doesn’t know how to do shit. Anyway thanks man, you’re the best waiter ever”
file attached
“Good morning professor Novak, how are you? I have finished my assignment and I am aware that the due Date is two months away, but work would probably be stacked up by then and I thought why not give you one less problem?  -Dean Winchester”
“what? Of course not it’s not your fault that this guy takes his job a little too seriously, not even the FBI would stay in disguise for two months.”
“really?”
Dean stopped his train of thought and his smile disappeared. ‘what the fuck are you thinking of?’ he thought to himself, but then he remembered again the words that his professor told him. somehow “good student” was translated into “good boy” in Dean’s head and he couldn’t help but blush when he imagined it coming from his professor’s lips. He covered his eyes with his arm and tried to make his dick chill down a little by ignoring the blood rushing to it. But the words really didn’t leave Dean’s head “I’m such a good boy” he moaned to himself as his dick twitched in his pants “so good for you professor Novak”
“I know” Cas states confidentially then he puts his phone down and turns his head towards his coworker “but you know what? I shouldn’t be this proud, my ID card fell when I approached Meg two months ago in the bar and she saw my real name. They’re gonna know that I am the journalist”
The professor sat down on his chair again trying to ignore the uncomfortable and painful boner in his slacks that wants to break free. Castiel decided he would not do anything regarding his dick and he will continue working until it goes down in itself, so he opened his laptop and the first thing he saw was of course Dean’s exposed ass. His cock twitched and Castiel quickly existed his email page to go back to his desktop. He took a sharp breath and then opened the e-book he has for another course he lectures, to highlight some important things that he needed to lecture for next class.
When Dean opened his eyes they were dull and vacant, and that too will haunt Sam until he dies.
Neither of the brothers thought Dean would be the one to leave first, but ultimately it was too much. The noise, the bustle, the constant reminder of a war still waging. A war he was built for, and now could have no part of. A war leaving his brothers and sisters in arms battered and bloodied day after day, with him helpless to do anything but look on. He doesn’t feel like a man who can take care of people anymore. He isn’t sure he ever was.
. They seem to move at the same time, inching into the center of the bed and folding into and around each other like it's second nature until Dan is pressed to Castiel once again, his head resting on Castiel's chest. Castiel falls more easily into sleep than he ever has before with the solid, warm weight of Dean's body against his own.
“Sam,” his voice is low, stern, the way their father’s used to get. And it puts a shudder through the both of them but it’s enough to interrupt Sam’s train of thought. “I’m not sorry. I needed to do it. We’ve been over that and I don’t want to beat that horse again. It’s done, it was my choice. I’m living with the consequences - we both are.” He ever so slightly smirks at his brother, “Better than the alternative.”
If there's a chapter anyone liked that they'd like to see more of, just let me know!
He worries about the future. The collective human future. And not in the specific, dire ways that he used to when the apocalypse seemed ever-looming and the threat of Croatoan or Michael v. Lucifer was legitimate and just narrowly missed. No, now he worries about politics, and smog and triglycerides. He tries to throw himself wholeheartedly into those worries because he thinks, he hopes, that it can distract him from the bigger issues.
When Michael took Dean, Sam hoped that Dean would have the same mercy.
It started with cooking for Dad and Sam, when he was a kid. Or maybe it started even earlier, hanging at his mother’s side as she cooked and hummed and asked him to taste-test. Feeding someone has always been the most straightforward and deeply meaningful way to care for his loved ones and Dean could do it on a penny.
He never seems to remember having woken before.
Sam snorts, smiles, shaking his head, then looks at Dean for a long moment. “I guess I kind of miss you. Is that weird?”
Sam is alive, that’s true. But, much to Dean’s surprise, it seems like he’s not done after all. Dean can’t find in himself to hold all of the years of Sam toeing the line of retirement against him. Dean’s always understood that struggle, the innate desire to live a normal life, even when he refused to admit so out loud. He can’t say his heart doesn’t ache knowing that Sam didn’t follow him out of the life, knowing that Sam, even now, had to zig when Dean couldn’t help but zag. In a way - though it hurts every time - Dean is always ready for Sam to need something different. In a way, he wasn’t unprepared for civilian life to have less of Sam in it.
. Everything it
For creativity's sake I'm imagining the program to also have access to volunteer counselors, separate from the sponsors.
Dean is closing up the shop. It’s a rainy, grey afternoon; stormy and powerful and electric. Humid days like this are worth the extra ache in his battered body for the visceral reminder of Cas - the threat of lightning and the smell of rain on the air. The force of nature. It’s sweet punishment, to be reminded so clearly of his friend, to not be allowed to forget.
“look at the Brightside Dean, homophobes would absolutely LOVE your company. You might even get new customers” Beth, Dean’s wife says as she looks for something to watch on the huge TV screen.
“no shit!”
Dean stares at Cas with knotted eyebrows and parted lips.
“need to get articles. Didn’t practically target your company, your company targeted itself at me” the answer wasn’t as scary as Dean anticipated it to be, but it was kind of degrading.
His hand was now under his boxers, stroking his hard penis while calling out his professor through moans and needy whines. “fuck, professor, f- fuck” he pictured the professor fucking him senseless. The view of his professor was slowly becoming more and more vivid and Dean’s orgasm was building up fast, he wanted to be touched and felt by the older man so much, he wanted him to praise him in a proper way, show him how proud he is of the student.
“I’m straight” Dean answered and emphasized on the straight
Castiel furrowed his eyebrows and hid his face in his hands again. He was thinking if Dean is alright. How is he like this? Why is he like this? How does he get with his days? How didn’t he die when he was a child? How did he survive with such a brain? And why must Castiel be its victim?
A sound of peeping interrupts his thoughts “hello Sir, Catiel Novak the journalist is here for the interview”
“stop it” Dean demands
Cas held Dean’s hips more firmly “d-dean” he groaned his lover’s name and it went straight to Dean’s hardening cock.
Cas has just moved into town, he moved a lot but this time the family was going to finally settle, which the 11-year-old was insanely excited about. He did not know anyone and did not have any friends, so he used to take his acrylics and drawing pad to the park and paint.
A few seconds and Meg walks in nervously to her boss’s office and sits down. Dean doesn’t say anything because everything is obvious from the expressions on her face.
“so..” the professor started but Dean cut him off “I am extremely sorry, I know that offended you but I swear it’s not what you think it is, I needed the money and the photographer emailed me the photos while I was trying to submit my assignment. I am sure that was disgusting for you and-“
“jeez don’t get mad now, I don’t care, just make sure we don’t lose this condo”
“I knew someone named Castiel, a very long time ago, they have different last names though,” Dean says in a low tone while staring at the name blankly, memories flood back to his mind as he keeps on re-reading the name. “I wonder how he’s doing” he mumbles.
His whole face turned red and he licked his lips as he pictured the professor’s naked body. His mind repeated to him that he shouldn’t do this, he shouldn’t look at his role model like this. But his arousal was insane, he didn’t know that praise can do things to him like this, he knew he liked the professor a little bit more than he thought, even if he didn’t admit it to himself. He always fished for his approval and pleasure, the days he praises him would be Dean’s best days and his good mood would be unbreakable. Even in some one night stands, Dean’s sex partners did praise him, but it did nothing to him. When his professor praises him, he knows that he means it truly.
He stares at the door of his office nervously waiting for the journalist to come in, the door opens and a man in a dark blue suit and a black tie walks in, he has black feathery hair, broad shoulders, and huge arms, all these things make Dean's heart aches with desire, he never expected a very nice looking, hot man to walk in, Dean almost drooled. But what really made Dean gasp was the man’s blue eyes. He stares at them till the journalist sits on the chair in front of the huge desk.
Cas stared at her for a second then she corrected herself “wait.. not a natural one, but you learned it from someone, is it right?”
“is that all you did for that?”
Dean’s cheeks heated up, now that’s really embarrassing, Dean is as forgetful as a goldfish. he put up a mental note in his head to submit the assignment as soon as he returns back to his dorm room.
(See the end of the chapter for
He locked his eyes with the shorter guy and stroked his thumb slowly and softly against his cheek. “tell me baby, what’s wrong” Dean whispers, his lips are just inches away from Cas’s. Cas placed his hands on Dean’s hips and closed his eyes.
Cas let out a groan after hearing Dean’s word, remembering the very good feeling of Dean around him, the view of Dean panting, the moans he lets out, and when he calls Cas’s name as if he’s the only one in the universe.
-----
Castiel gulped down and answered dryly “good.”
He put Lulu on the floor so she can roam around, maybe chew some boxes open and save him from the task he never plans to do. The journalist walks towards his balcony and looks out at the view outside, living in New York means that no matter what window you look out from, you’ll only see buildings, hundreds of buildings, but Cas’s eyes fixated at that one specific building, the one where Dean Winchester works. He lights up a cigar and starts on inhaling it. he remembers something that drew a sarcastic chuckle out of him.
The professor knitted his eyebrows and opened his mouth slightly being extremely confused and concerned. He stared at the email for almost five minutes and kept rereading it then rereading the name of the sender. He took in a sharp breath then went back to the sixth email. The professor pointed the mouse at the document debating if he should or should not open it. He circled around it hesitantly, he knew he shouldn’t open it, it is obviously something not meant for his eyes but he was also so curious to know what could have made the student think that Castiel would be extremely offended by, he wanted to know, he had to know. So he took a last breath and opened the document which turned out to be three pictures, he opened the first one and holy shit, it was a very high quality picture.
13 years ago –
Dean smirked “after what you did? You wish.” The hunter placed kisses at the base of Cas’s shaft, and kissed up to the top but before he reached the tip he went back down again, he kept doing that, depriving the tip of Dean’s lips, and the angel was starting to lose his mind.
Dean stroked his cock through his orgasm, and he came calling out his professor. When he finished he picked up his phone while panting and typed out a text to his friend Charlie “something happened, I think I’m fucked. I don’t know what to do”
He sighed for the thousand time today and took another sip of his coffee to move to the fifth email.
Cas looked at Dean with confusion and he saw tears in the other guy’s eyes. Dean looked so angry, so mad and so broken “if you want me so fucking bad then why the fuck did you avoid me for a whole fucking week? Please make sense of yourself Cas!” Dan scolded the panting mess on the chair. Dean thought to himself before that if the sex was bad, at least they can find ways to make it work, but Cas really enjoyed it, then it must be an issue with Dean’s personality he does not love me. Dean was hoping that Cas would get him off of him and storm out, but he really liked not only fucking Dean’s ass, but also fucking with Dean’s emotions. If the problem wasn’t the sex, then it is probably that Cas does not like Dean himself.
Castiel Gulped when he heard that. What if Dean remembered him?
“bullshit” Winchester interrupts Meg then sighs “look, I get it, you guys were probably afraid for the public’s well-being and safety, but you took an oath to be loyal to this company and that was only a malfunction that probably never happened in all the sixty years the company has been running. So, to not fire you both, I am hoping to get a confession by the end of the day. Now Leave”
“You still did not send me your finished assignment.  –professor Castiel Novak.”
Castiel found himself giggling at the email but he stopped himself immediately before smiling warmly at the clumsy boy, he did not want to reward unprofessional behavior that gives him a headache, even when no one is looking. The professor scratched his eyebrow then comforted himself “three down, four to go” he clicked then on the fourth email.
“oh my god I am extremely sorry and extremely embarrassed I did not mean to send that to you, I just received these documents now via email and accidently put them instead of my assignment, this was not intentional whatsoever. It was an honest mistake I did not mean by it anything I promise you. I will drop out of your class if you’re disgusted by it and I’ll never show my face here ever again just please do not report me to the administration of the university I am sincerely sorry.  –Dean Winchester”
“he’s not my son” Rowena answered as if she read Cas’s thoughts “but one of his advisors is!” and Dean wanted to do an interview with us, to fix the company’s reputation”
Dean’s eyes widened after he read the email and he was relieved, only a little though, because it did not seem like his professor was going to report him. but nothing ever erases the fact that his professor saw him in that state.
“yes. They say all my articles sources are anonymous which makes them unreliable” he finally spoke.
Dean took deep breaths, and tried to relax himself as much as possible, he did not have the courage to walk in that classroom where professor Novak is going to lecture him, he couldn’t show the man his face. He was already five minutes late, and that never happened before, he always was punctual and coming late would indicate to the professor that something is wrong and that would make things awkward. Dean needed to act normal and pretend that nothing happened but he found himself debating if he should go in or just run back to his dorm. He was overthinking everything, where would he sit if he went in? he always sits in the front raw, but he really does not want to show his shameful face to professor Novak but by not doing so he would break his rule of pretending that everything is normal.
“Since you got the job 10 months ago.”
Cas orgasmed first, filling Dean up just like asked him to, then after few strokes Dean was cumming all over his stomach. Cas laid next to Dean, both breathing heavily feeling the after sex glow. Cas was looking towards Dean, then Dean turned his head to look at his lover. “I guess I learned my lesson” Cas said with a weak smile “but you didn’t because you still called my dad’s name” Dean raised his eyebrows “weird.. I thought that was supposed to turn you off not make you cum inside me” Cas rolled his eyes “my head was too clouded”
“it’s just… a little weird… I mean.. every time we have sex you start calling my father’s name”
The professor smiled at him and sat at his desk as students started to get up and leave. some of them went over to his desks to ask him some questions, Dean just sat nervously waiting for everyone to leave. He wondered what the professor wanted from him, scold him? tell him how disgusting he is? Blackmail him? Dean counted the students left in class as they walk out until the last one left.
“Dean.. I don’t understand, why? Okay, I get that knowing someone who has the same rare name can bring back memories, but why are they consuming you?” Sammy asked and Dean stayed quiet.
“Maybe if you stopped being such a materialist for one day I wouldn’t begin to lose it” The frustrated Husband said as he opened his phone to text one of his advisors.
Dean hurried to open the door, he welcomed Crowley and led him to the living room where his wife sat “honey our guest is here!” Dean said happily and his wife sat up enthusiastically
“me too!” Cas exclaimed
Both Aaron and Meg gasp when they read what’s written on the screen, they face each other, speechless. “that son of a fucking bitch”
“yes, being a CFO is difficult, I could imagine…and what about the sexual assault incident in Seattle where a man employed in the company flashed one your receptionists?”
He walked up the stairs and stood in front of Dean’s room and before knocking he heard noises of whining and moaning from inside the room, Cas knotted his brows and squinted his eyes trying to figure out what these voices might be, Dean is in pain, why else would he moan? That was Cas’s last thought before opening the door wide open to rescue the love of his life who was... not in pain.
“I like it. it must hurt to eat your own bad-tasting flesh, just so others won’t get a bite of it, I am sorry you feel this way” Cas said with his eyes on the floor then he walked out without even looking at Dean or waiting for him to respond.
“what baby? You want me now? You want me to help you cum?” Dean whispered against his angel’s ear and Cas started bucking his hips forwards and upwards trying to get more friction “ah- dean, want you so so so bad” as soon as dean heard these words coming from his lover’s lips he immediately got off of Cas’s lap and stood in front of him.
And now he has sent nudes, not only nudes, but sex shots of him sucking cock and having cum leaking out of his ass to his role model. Dean cursed his friend Charlie for suggesting he takes the job and model for a porn website, well he did need the money but if he knew the consequences to it he would have not done it. When he realized earlier that the document he sent to his professor was the pictures, he sat down on the floor and cursed a lot while imagining the disgusted look on Dr. Novak’s face.
“you don’t like fucking me?”
Cas nodded
Sam doesn’t say anything
Dean opened his eyes wide open and quickly stood up “what the fuck Cas you can’t put that”
“no” Cas shook his head. “I throw my blues away, I don’t like them in paintings”
Dean stood by the library looking angrily at Cas who was pretending to read books with Sam. He did not like being ignored, or lied to, and that’s exactly what the angel has been doing for the past week. The hunter and the angel had been dating for about 3 weeks now, but Dean did not understand why suddenly Cas did not want to sleep with him, the sex was great and Dean was 100% sure that Cas enjoyed it a lot, it was obvious in his blue eyes that went dark whenever Dean teased him, how quickly he’d get a boner after Dean just kisses him, and the fact that he bounded Dean’s ass like a dog in heat was enough to prove that the sex was alright, then why is Cas avoiding him especially when he knows that Dean is in the mood for it? Something was up and Dean had to find it.
“I missed you too” Cas chocked out and Dean immediately removed his fingers from his ass and sank down Cas’s cock, “I need you Cas, I need you to fill me up” Dean cried as he started riding Cas. Cas gripped on to Dean’s hips and flipped them over, now Cas was on top and he was fucking Dean hard and fast, hitting the Dean’s prostate every time “Cas- cas- s’good you feel so so good” Dean moaned and the angel kept on fucking him and groaning. “so close- so so close im gonna cum oh God!” Dean realized he had called out Cas’s ‘father’, he looked at Cas to see any signs of discomfort but the angel was too gone and too drunk in lust to give a damn.
The interview starts with Dean introducing himself, then the questions begin.
“yes Beth- I, yeah don’t worry too much everything will be alright- n-no I’m not going to lose my job who the fuc- no we will not be poor for fuck’s sake- you know what? I’ll be home in few hours and we’ll talk about it” Dean hangs up the phone on his wife then practically throws it on his desk.
“yes. You’re Dean Winchester. We used to live in the same neighborhood” Cas answered as if it’s nothing.
“I never really thought about it this way.. but yeah it kinda is suspicious” Meg agrees and she starts to seem a little bit calmer than before.
“is it because I keep on sucking your cock even after you cum?” Cas who was now flushed, clenched his fingers against his thigh, he looked at everything but Dean’s face, he licked his lips and answered “no” but it came out breathy.
Dean’s heart started to bound quickly, he looked up and nodded “yes, I mean no, I mean I do not have a class after this one, I can stay”
“we all let him down… you think he is alright now?” Dean asked
Cas squatted next to him on the ground and held his lovers face between his hands “I was so embarrassed to tell you this because I thought you’d laugh at me, I must apologize I thought wrong of yo-“ before cas could continue dean busted out laughing hysterically on the floor with tears peaking from the corners of his eyes, he laughed way too hard and Cas got pissed and got up “anyway, when you’re done laughing you’ll find me in your room.”
