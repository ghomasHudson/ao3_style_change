John swallowed, then nodded. "Okay. Fine. Whatever you feel. It's all fine." He got up to leave, but Sherlock grabbed his wrist, staring intently into John's eyes. John sat back down immediately.
Sometimes, he got the outliers. The occasional couple who want to be spontaneous but don't have the money or time for a surprise trip to Paris, so instead go out for a coffee date at two in the morning. There are people returning from clubs and concerts, or pre-teens who thought that running away from home was a good idea for all of two minutes before remembering that they are totally helpless on their own and that their parents probably won't kill them for losing their school bag. Once, he got a group of men out on a stag do who came in drunk, demanding where the strippers were. (John couldn't blame them - the owner thought it was funny to name the coffee shop 'Hot and Steamy', so misunderstandings are inevitable.)
“Is that what your diagnosis would be for a patient experiencing the same symptoms as you are now?” She asked, her voice calm and patient. John hated it. “I don’t think it would be.”
"The finger was removed post-mortem. It's a clean break, done with a sharp instrument. Whoever did this was obviously well-practised. Bit disturbing, that."
Go easy on your older brother though. Us older siblings have a lot of shit to deal with and we've been sort of forced into the older brother/third parent role. He probably got a lot of 'you need to set a good example' and 'you're too old to be *insert perfectly acceptable behaviour here that the younger sibling would totally get away with at the same age*' over the years. I know this because I have a younger sister called Harry, but you could probably already tell that, smart thing like you.
“Come on, Sherlock. How about a full English first? All that grease should soak the booze up. And you’re so thin already…”
suggests the exact opposite of sanity and happiness.” Something akin to pity lights up in Mycroft’s eyes. It’s revolting. “I worry, brother dear. You’ve become isolated.”
Back in John's room, when they're both lying on John's bed leaning up against the headboard, Sherlock's head on John's shoulders, he asks, "So you told Harry then?"
Sherlock jumps at the sound of Mycroft’s voice, and turns to glare at the god currently standing in front of his throne. “What do you want? You never visit me. I’d assumed your eating habits had left you perpetually stuck in your throne.”
Sherlock appears a few minutes later, grinning from ear to ear in a way that makes John's heart flutter. "Well done. You performed your role excellently."
"I want to study chemistry at uni," Sherlock admits. "And after that..." Sherlock trails off, unsure whether or not to continue. John cuts in for him, saying proudly, "Sherlock wants to be a detective."
He collapsed onto the couch and curled up, his back facing away from the tent door. He felt his eyes sting bitterly and inhaled shakily, trying to calm himself down.
John was one of the last students out. When he got out, most of the students had spread outside to wander about with their friends. Sherlock was stood by the wall next to the door, leaning non-chalantly and relaxed as he waited for John.
“You know, John,” Mrs Hudson says as she dishes up the food. “If you two ever want... time to yourself, I would be happy to take Rosie for a few hours. Just pop down and drop her off, whenever you need alone time.”
Professor Slughorn made his way around the classroom, observing potions, smelling them, then occasionally nodding in satisfaction or shaking his head, disappointed. At Anderson's cauldron he shook his head and Anderson scowled, muttering under his breath when Slughorn left. John discreetly smirked at this. At Sherlock's cauldron the man nodded and congratulated Sherlock on a job well done. John didn't expect any less. Then he went to Molly's cauldron. Potions, John knew, was not Molly's speciality. In fact it was the only lesson which she neither enjoyed or was good at - unlike herbology or charms, which she excelled at. So as Slughorn carefully inspected Molly's potion, and Molly anxiously chewed on her lower lips, glancing at her friend for some form of comfort, John watched intently, nervous for her. When he saw that Molly had passed, by the way she grinned and hugged her friend excitedly, he smiled and let out a breath he hadn't realised he had been holding.
Molly made a shushing noise and placed a comforting hand on John's shoulder. "Hey, it's fine. Don't stress about it - stress will slow down recovery time. He's just doing some research."
John sniggers, almost spilling his drink onto his chair as he does so. “Yeah. I bet the murder guy’s wife didn’t lie about her identity and where she went every night, shoot his best friend and fake an entire pregnancy.”
John quickly realised that no one had spoken for several seconds and that they had been staring at each other for just as long. He cleared his throat.
John turns a few more corners, almost entirely certain he is going the right way. Sherlock sighs impatiently. "If this is that walnut museum, I told you I was joking when I said - "
Sherlock carefully extracts his arm from underneath Marco and climbs out of bed, putting on his discarded pants and shirt as he travels across to Marco’s coat on the floor. His phone is in its pocket, with little security except one four letter passcode: his birthday. Sherlock scoffs. Idiot, thank goodness he’s only seventh in line to that spot at the head of the Alfonsi table, otherwise he’d be genuinely worried for the state of the Italian Mafia. Still, he has the information he needs and Sherlock isn’t going to question when he has to do a little less work for it. In a matter of minutes, he has numbers, contact details, transcripts of key phone calls, and his next location, all downloaded onto his laptop. There’s nothing left to do now except pick up the rest of his clothes and leave.
"No. This memory stick means that the cards are in our hands. You can use it to prove your loyalty to Mary."
"Yeah. I met him, you know. Victor." Sherlock's features darkened at the mention of that name. "Turned up right after you threatened me. He seemed like bad news, and you seemed - well, it had probably been a while since you had last celebrated being sober, let's put it that way. But I couldn't undo you two meeting without compromising my sister's success. So once I undid everything, I just...posted leaflets through your door and hoped you'd take it as a sign from above to go to rehab."
"Superb. Fantastic." He replied drily, sitting on the floor. "Unless you count the fact that I am currently incredibly hungover, suffering from migraines and nausea, I got punched in the face by my date last night and I don't think I can ever show my face in public again. But other than that I'm good."
Irene: You haven’t even heard anything about the role! You’ll love it, honestly. It’s perfect for you
He wiped his eyes dry of moisture threatening to make himself known, then looked around the room. The familiarity of the Ravenclaw dorm room was somewhat a reassurance
Thank you for sending me the photo of you. I have to admit, you are very 'photogenic' too, even in a mud-caked, grass stained rugby outfit. There. Now I've returned your compliment appropriately.
Boss, as the young woman sitting at a computer desk had called him, raked a hand through slicked back, dark hair and groaned impatiently. There were multiple cameras on the inside and outside of the building, none of which had been discovered yet. The two men living there hadn’t even noticed that people had broken into the building a mere few days after they had first moved in there together. But then again, the operation was run smoothly and efficiently by Adams.
“No. Nothing. You’re it for me.” John shifts closer, cups Sherlock’s cheek in one hand and strokes his cheekbone with his thumb. Sherlock forgets how to breathe. “I don’t want anything else. I want
"Actually, it's alright, Dad. I was just going to show Sherlock around the flat for a bit. Mum, how long until tea's ready?"
“But she’s dangerous! Certainly dangerous enough to warrant bloody MI6 agents being there. She shot you once. If you’re on your own without me there, she might do it again.”
The dance floor was crowded with bodies, a tangle of limbs and movement as the music pulsed around them, the melody barely discernable over the chaos. Some had arrived in packs, including a group of women clearly on a hen-do, whereas others arrived in couples, who danced so close to one another that the expression 'glued by the hip' would be an understatement. Some had arrived alone, but found themselves a fellow loner, or maybe even two, to dance with. John Watson did come with a friend, another doctor, but was since left alone to drown his bitterness and loneliness in whiskey, sat at the bar while his friend was at the flat of a girl he'd managed to pull. He wondered if it was even worth staying much longer or if he should just go home and maybe watch some crap telly before falling asleep. Travelling back in time to make the choice not to come was pointless - staying at home wouldn't have been any more interesting.
Sherlock sniffed, aggressively wiping tears from his cheek. "What's to be sorry about? You didn't kill him."
Sherlock frowns in confusion, and John cuts across any protest he is about to make. He turns to the lady at the desk. "It's a shame, really. Sherlock here,  my boyfriend - well, my soulmate actually," he beams proudly up at him, "It's his first time in the UK. It's hard, you know, being overseas - he's from France, you know. And he loves the ballet. I just wanted to please him. Make his time here in the UK worthwhile." He feigns a sigh, and subtly kicks Sherlock to get him to play along.
"Oh, a whole two hours? You're spoiling me." John rolls his eyes with a smile. "See you soon, Sherlock. Get some more rest."
"...I suppose, hypothetically, my emotional state may have been compromised by my dog's absence the day before."
"Mary was born Alissia Grace Rosamund Adams. She grew up with death eater parents during the second wizarding war, and was frequently used as a spy for her parents, so from a young age she had learnt to control and use her magic for her parents' benefit. When her parents were killed in the war and the death eaters defeated, she was adopted by family in France and had her name changed. This was probably either to keep her identity a secret for protection or out of shame. So when Moriarty came along offering her power, the ability to fulfil her magical potential, as well as revenge on you and me, she took it, without really knowing what she was agreeing too. Or maybe she did, and whatever ideology her parents had drilled into her was still there. Either way, she's missing with Moriarty and Moran.
"Yeah. I get you're not into relationships. You're - asexual? Is that the term? - and that's okay." John's voice had lowered, and if Sherlock didn't know better he'd say it was sad. Most definitely tired. From staying up late with Mary? He tried not to think about it.
On behalf of everyone at Edinburgh University, I am pleased to congratulate you on our acceptance of your application. We were very impressed by your academic history and achievements and feel that you would make an excellent addition to the Edinburgh University alumni.
“Oh, of course, it won’t. It’s just, you know, your parents, whose approval I have to win and make last for as long as we will continue to be associated with one another. No pressure, of course.” Sherlock’s deadpan voice doesn’t quite hide the anxiety, the nervous way he bites his lower lip and drums his fingers on the counter.
“Shut up. I’m hugging. We’re hugging now.” John giggles slightly. “Nothing bad will happen. Remember, regardless of whether she will remain your wife once she comes home, she can help us take down whatever the threat is. She has valuable information.”
“Fuck work,” John murmured, as he crowded Sherlock against the wall, closing the door behind him. "I was planning on calling in sick anyway."
“He’s a god of death, like you. Granted, he’s only been around for one millenium, but I can assure you he’ll be kept under close observation. I can ask Eurus to ease off drowning innocent sailors and toddlers learning to swim, to ease his load, and I will be more... compassionate around irritating mortals.”
The events of the night before came crashing through and Sherlock groaned again, this time out of embarrassment and frustration. He remembered Victor and his cat-like grin as they danced at the ball. He remembered Victor walking them calmly out of the hall, his hand on the small of his back. He also remembered the flask Victor pulled from his robes and the way that though it tasted utterly revolting, Sherlock kept drinking from it until the flask felt light in his hands and his brain slowed down, to the point it almost switched off. Then he found himself pressed up against the wall by Victor, and he panicked, releasing a long flow of last minute deductions that Victor may have found a bit not good. Sherlock touched the cut on his cheek - cleaned, which explains John's medical kit. Ah. John.
John smiled and leaned over to kiss Sherlock gratefully, which he eagerly accepted. Sherlock was right, they will see each other again. It’s just that only John would be aware that this would be a do-over of their first meeting. He didn’t mind too much: as long as he could get back from the theatre in time to meet Sherlock at the club, chat him up again, take him to dinner, and have another round of spectacular sex, everything would be back on track. He pulled away before he could become too distracted and started gathering up his clothes. “I’ll see you soon, yeah?”
“Tattoos. Jewellery. Bracelets, rings, and the like. Anything that can be hidden under clothing or be passed off as normal. The most common being a pendant with two, small intersecting crescent moons. Like yours.”
If Sherlock has something more to say or ask him, he doesn't admit it. Instead, he turns back around to face the screen, watching it with a half-focused interest. John's concentration isn't faring much better.
"Why aren't you with John? Surely such a triumph should be celebrated with his... Pals." Sherlock wanted to punch that smirk right off his brother's face.
Molly then starts talking as Viola, saying her lines with perfect understanding in a way that makes Greg visibly stare in awe, his brown eyes wide and adoring like a puppy. John chuckles, deciding to
“Of course, you’re wonderful company, Redbeard. The only person I can talk to around here who isn’t obligated to respect me just because I rule over them. You don’t complain. You don’t cry about your wasted lifetime and your mortal regrets. You don’t beg to be reunited with your long-lost love who isn’t even dead yet. But still, sometimes I wonder…”
Thank you again for seeing me off at the station.  And for your gift. I haven’t opened it yet as I’m waiting until I get there. Or when I get too bored of staring out of the window. We’ll see which one wins out first. I wish I could say that I did think to get you a gift as well but, let’s be honest (and your book did say that honesty is key to a good relationship with your soulmate, ha ha), I really haven’t. But I will. And I’ll send it to you soon so it will arrive by the time it’s your first day too.
"Maybe she assumed you already knew. Maybe she was going to wait until after dinner. So, come to think of it, I probably shouldn't have said anything - "
John broke away, panting as he tried to regain control over himself, calm down enough to think clearly without the fog of relief and affection and arousal. "Wait, wait, wait. Before we go into - any of this. There's something else you should probably know."
Thank you for the picture of Redbeard, by the way. I just got it in the post this morning. I was correct, he was cute. And by the looks of things, very energetic - he looks ready to run off at any moment. You do look very happy in that picture. Significant improvement from the frowning in the last picture (though it's a shame you're not in a wedding suit this time - haha! Not that you can't pull off your jeans and dress shirt look, that is.) Overall, 10/10.
He rolls the sleeves up to his elbows, puts product in his hair and forms it into 'the swoop' as Harry had dubbed it, then waited for Sherlock in the living room
"Lucky you. We can't all have mind palaces or whatever and never forget a single detail by accident." John stood beside him.
"None of it! Yeah, I mentioned quidditch and that I'm pretty much an adrenaline addict and that case with the lake, but it's all either made up or paraphrased. Did you see the bit about me being a sidekick?!"
"Beneficial?" John huffed out a small, humourless laugh. "It's our NEWT year, Sherlock, of course it's beneficial."
Stella rolled her eyes. “Shut up. Yes, this one is different. It has a note, this time, and we’re stumped. Will you come?”
"Well, I'm guessing the next round is the psychological one, so to speak," Sherlock explained, "testing of your mental strengths: decision making, resistance to temptations, morals, that kind of thing. The last one at Hogwarts was a test of decision making, morals and responses to being in a difficult situation. They had to find a person they were close to - friend or family or...otherwise - at the bottom of the lake in under an hour."
The contestants and their headteacher a stood in a circle around Mcgonagall. John noticed that in Mcgonagall's hand was a purple velvet bag, and that something inside the bag was moving. John hoped that inside was the actual creature he'd have to fight, rather than anything bigger.
"No you didn't," Sherlock chuckles, standing up. "Come on, let's stretch our legs. That hiding place is murder on the knees."
Sherlock waved a dismissive hand in the air. "Irrelevant. You are a doctor who went to war to save lives, you revealed your most hidden secret to me for no reason other to save the lives of a couple of children. You are one of the few people I've met who tolerate my deductions, and you have done since the very beginning.  you make me eat and sleep when I forget to and take care of my wellbeing. You let me do experiments in the kitchen - yes, I know, as long as it stays away from anything edible. You flirted with me within 24 hours of meeting me, and immediately retracted it when you were rejected, without pushing further for a positive answer. You then shot a man to save my life. And to top this all off, you can time travel. So yes, I'd say you are rather strange. In fact," Sherlock's smile grew, eyes bright. It took John's breath away. "I'd say you were a puzzle."
John is woken up the next morning by Rosie’s crying. This is nothing unusual. What is unusual is the fact that the crying continues, without sound of Mary getting up to quieten her, since it's her turn that morning .
The students parted and spread themselves around the room. Sherlock saw Mary and Janine making their way towards them and suppressed a groan. Mary headed straight for John.
"Right. That's a shame though. It's a lovely flat, and I'm sure if you asked someone would happily move in on your terms, without them cluttering up the space with books or DVDs or partners." John himself would move in if he was asked. The flat is far better than his own, with much more space and a homely, authentic feel about the place, unlike the cold and unwelcoming atmosphere of his bedsit. 221b is designed to be a home; his bedsit is designed to be a prison. "Right, then. Your turn?"
, John thinks with pride) and John gets out his own from his jacket, as instinct tells him that it's probably not room service.
"One. We booked one. Thank you ever so much." Sherlock flashed a false grin at the man who handed them the tickets, before ushering John away, his hand on his arm. When they were a safe distance away from other people, he turned to him and whispered quietly, "You're going to go in alone. Keep an eye on the audience."
Sherlock waves his hand dismissively. "Only in title. I knew it was three days because you're ignoring your discomfort in a way that shows you're used to it by now."
“Perhaps, If at home you show improvement, recovery from your trauma, you could apply again, but at the moment you are in no state to be back in active duty. I’m sorry, Captain.”
"If only. Unfortunately that would make me a hypocrite." Mycroft gave a tight lipped smile. "I sometimes miss the days I practiced what I preached."
During their fourth or so break, John realised that he hadn't spoken to Sherlock all evening. He hadn't even seen him since the beginning dances. He looked around the room and there was no sign of him: not dancing in the centre of the room, not sitting at a table, not (thank Merlin) one of the couples kissing - less discreetly than they probably thought - against the wall or in a corner.
looking Sherlock reading the newspaper on the same chair he'd slept in last night, the blanket folded neatly on the arm.
You lean in, but suddenly your eyes flit towards my left and your eyes widen. "Sherlock..." You whisper. And then you run. You Run like he's there. I look to where you seem to be heading. A tall man in a black coat is walking, his back towards us. His hair are a mop of black curls. And then, sensing someone is calling him, he stops and looks behind. I can see you stop abruptly. It's not him then. I can see you physically deflate. You really did think it was him.
Though John had come with the intention of having a meaningful conversation, now that the opportunity presented itself, he wasn't quite sure what his actual words should be. He decided to begin with the core issue, the thing that had started the disagreement in the first place.
Mrs Hudson began going on and on about the show-piece, and John tried to get involved in the conversation, hoping Sherlock hadn't caught on to anything.
Once again, they faced each other, and instinctively John brought up his hand to cup Sherlock's face, at the same time Sherlock leant towards him with a jerk, both surprising the other, so that they let out a soft chuckle.
John looked at the worry lining her face, and affection bloomed in him, warm and sudden. Unexpectedly, he reached out and covered her frail hand in his, “No, its alright Mrs Hudson. Nothing’s wrong.”
Of course, Vanshika has had a HUGE hand in my regular updates, and in having the story make overall sense. So lots Of love to you!!!!!
John started. "Wait, what do you mean, 'what he thought'? He has dismantled the entire network, hasn't he?" He asked, both confused and hurt, and a bit frustrated by the fact that all of Sherlock's efforts, all of these injuries and pain was for nothing.
Their last night in the safety of Baker Street, protected from the press and the media and having to pretend they were a couple.
"Shut up for Christ's sake! I was really sleepy when I wrote that." John's neck and ears were red and he was furious at not being able to reach his phone.
The next morning he woke up in his bed, a blanket carefully arranged on him, his flat swept clean of drugs, as he would later find out.
Below them on the pavement, and nearly on the road, hoards of people were standing, crowded all chatting with each other. Most of them were reporters, in the middle and the front of the crowd, with their cameras at ready. Then there was another group of mostly women- supporters, John guessed. And finally, to the extreme right, was a group of people with boards that looked like--
But somehow, before he broke down completely, he pulled himself together, reminding himself that what had happened had happened and that he couldn't do anything to change it.
And he smiled with understanding, not of unrequited love, but a way of caring for each other that had been accepted by both of them.
He himself was wearing what he thought was one of his nicer jumpers, though Sherlock had shown some signs of distaste when he first saw it. Well, the bastard could go to Dolce-and-Gabbana Hell for all John cared.
There was a certain smugness on Sherlock's face, in light of all his victories over Mycroft. He didn't spare a second glance at John, as if he was merely an object that was transmitting the message to Mycroft, directing his rage not at John, but beyond him, to where Mycroft lay listening.
"S alright! I promise. I promise I 'll stop." I take another swig. This time everything looks even more blurred, and the alcohol burns my throat, but leaves that warmth that makes me believe everything will be fine. I fall asleep like that, making false promises to myself. But in the dimmed light of the room, and the soft lull of the drink, I believe in them.
"Shit." He cursed. He couldn't just walk inside and yet he wanted to be near his home, their home, as his knees threatened to give away.
Ignoring this, except for a condescending glare, Sherlock said, “Now, we just sway from side to side. This is not a very practical position at all, since very little dance can actually happen between two people. However, I believe that the proximity is a show of affection in such matters, and since you’re not much of a dancer, this should suit you just fine.” Saying this, he quickly relieved them of their position, noticing that he was enjoying it too much. His disastrous mind had also calculated their exact heights, and how john would fit perfectly in the crook of his neck, and also how comfortable he felt being held by john.
A co-worker coming up to Mr Tilney in the middle of the night might have been suspicious, but a desperate son-in-law with some or the other pity-inducing excuse was not. After all, Mr Tilney only wanted his daughter to be happy.
Apparently, it was the son-in-law who was the perpetrator . A search through the victim’s flat had produced some documents which looked like pieces of evidence to Mr. Tilney’s son-in-law’s gambling addiction.
And so they left each other in that moment- not as friends, but neither as lovers- simply as they always had been: Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.
Years of living with Sherlock and their lack of personal space had made touching him - nothing sexual, just small touches to affirm their support or agreement- an instinct and knowing Sherlock took comfort in them made it a habit.
.He repeated to himself, like the word was a spell that would make things easier to understand, easier to decide upon. He had made a choice when he called out to Mike Stamford. When he'd distracted Sherlock. When he'd said goodbye.
Rosie let out a cry of distress at the shouting, and looked on as her parents fought. It seemed a little confusing to her.
"But you know it will." Mycroft didn't say it in the way of a taunt,but simply as a fact they were both aware of.
"Nice." Mary said, surveying them intently. "It's television anyway, people won't be able to take more than a few seconds of kissing from two men."
"She's your daughter, mom and dad." Your voice is a plea, John, like you're asking them to consider the fact.
Mycroft looked like he wanted to feed John to the hound in Baskerville, but said nothing except giving John a glare.
Both of them were surprised to hear the tinge of sincerity in it. He then looked around a flat, and inhaled, as if taking in the smell of it and preserving it on his mind. Then, with a lingering pat on Sherlock's shoulder he left.
It seemed as if a circuit had been completed, for sparks of electricity, like fireworks clouded their brain.
If John was being honest, he had always wanted to know what it was like to run his fingers through those smooth luxurious curls, and well, now was his chance.
"And now all this drinking. That's the kind of things i/those/i type of people get in." I want to cry. I hate hearing the utter disgust in her voice. I hate myself.
And like all the other times John had been indulging in his little impulses, he let it happen this time too.
It was 5 in the evening before there was any sound in Baker Street. Sherlock’s phone rang. There was a call from Lestrade.
It wasn't a thought really, it was the passing of an electron from one neuron to another with the synapse just connected. And he pushed it away as fast as he could, not even allowing it to take the shape of words.
"It-it will be alright if you do not wish to accompany me in my investigations, as I understand you disapprove of my methods. You needn't go out of your way to help me, you're already doing enough." He'd evidently been worrying about the matter while John was away, and his brilliant, genius mind had jumped to a lot on conclusions in the interval.
I try to hide my bottle, but in vain. I am too drunk, the glass of the bottle clinks as it touches the floor.
Mycroft slowly walked towards him, as if approaching an animal; for an animal Sherlock was, wounded, hurt.
But now that he thought hard about it, he realised that it might not be the case. There was a chance that he'd never meet Mary in the new future.
"Mission accomplished" John said to himself in a weak laugh, before a curse escaped his lips and he held his head in his hands.
They both knew what John was saying. Sherlock had been known to go in a downward spiral due to John's absence before. How would be take to John permanently leaving his life?
To this Sherlock gave no response in particular, only a gruff sound. Rosie noticed that her dad had come home, and gave an exclamation of delight, before a stuffed elephant caught her eye and she started playing with it. Sherlock looked at her and smiled tiredly in response. He walked past John without meeting his eyes, as if the latter did not exist at all. His anger fueled, John roughly grabbed Sherlock's arm, and turned him around to face John. His earlier worry about whether or not Sherlock would accept the role of being Rosie's father had temporarily subsided.
John and Sherlock rushed to the Yard. Before this new evidence, both Lestrade’s and Sherlock’s leading theory had been that the culprit was the victim’s coworker, and the motive was assumed to be something to do with the project that Mrs Tilney had mentioned. They had been about to go to his office and look up some papers and begin questioning the employees.
being there than anything else. The detective drew the curtain close with a dramatic sweep, pacing the room. Then, he asked John, who was still peeking from behind the curtain, observing at the window, "John, take a good look at the crowd below. Do you notice anyone that seems out of place?"
“I am not, John. But Mrs. Hudson seemed to have picked up the song from somewhere, and had been babbling to me how wonderful the song is, ‘God bless Ed! Such a wonderful song he’s written!’” Sherlock imitated her with a sour look.
They'd breezed by John's interview, and other than a strict warning to not bring up Sherlock's, er, experiments on human body parts, John had played the role of the lovesick boyfriend exceedingly well.
"Yes." Mary said softly, and then something in her features changed. Her eyes seemed to melt into pools, and her smile eased into something mellow.
Mr Tilney seemed to have been collecting them since the past few years, perhaps threatening to show them to his daughter if the gambling did not stop.
The sleeping pills bottle had not been paid much attention to initially, Mr. Tilney already took prescribed pills of the same brand, and a bottle on a side table had not seemed very important.
At this Mycroft sneered at his younger brother, and looked away. They stood for a few moments in silence.
"Hello Doctor Watson. I have tried to call Sherlock multiple times, but as always, he refuses to cooperate with anyone." Mycroft's tone had the same diplomatic tones heavily laced with sarcasm, and he put on a theatrical sigh for John's benefit.
Tears stream down my face. I sniffle, and the pathetic state I am in becomes apparent to me. Anger spurts randomly, but soon gets mixed with the pain and fades into it.
Before he could even finish saying it completely, however, the darkness groped at him and sent him into oblivion.
"Very good John!" Sherlock looked very pleased with him. John couldn't help but feel a little happy himself, though he knew it was stupid. "Yes,binoculars! But why would a reporter carry binoculars? He would want a picture of us, if he were one."
"Of course Sherlock." Mycroft said this in a very patronising tone, sure to tick the younger Holmes off, "but Lestrade will still be coming around this evening. Goodbye, Sherlock and Doctor Watson."
He wasted no time in going upstairs, to the lab where Sherlock would be conducting an experiment, ultimately incriminating the brother with the green ladder.
John had just kept down his phone when Sherlock materialised behind him. "Did the conversation last so long?" He inquired, his head tilted, looking straight into John's eyes.
He couldn't. John couldn't live with this man for two months and experience him in all his brilliance and take money for it, like it wasn't the most amazing thing to ever happen to him.
“You know, on the wedding day, the bride and groom dance, right? And the thing is, I am rubbish at it. so I was wondering…” he left the sentence with a shrug.
John couldn’t help it. He let out a giggle at this, and Sherlock looked up at him with a blush creeping from the collar of his shirt, and face looking very embarrassed and slightly confused.
Beside them, on the table, was a little diary in which John insisted they keep all the observations that Sherlock made, so he could remember: what the man below on the street looked like, what did he do during his shift, and so on
When we got together, John, I was sure that you were over him. But on that day, when Sherlock came back I realized how wrong I was. I had then decided to accept the fact. And I thought that we could share you, John. Not like a commodity, you know, but that we could share a place in your heart.
John was a bit frustrated with the long line at the bookshop, but he supposed that he should be happy knowing that more people were visiting the bookstore. It was surely welcome break from their screens.
', how wonderful John." Sherlock's voice was disdainful though not unamused as he read out an excerpt from his phone.
They’d both said that they had forgiven each other, knowing all too well that they hadn’t. John had pushed his feelings away, tried to forget it all, for happy times to return, but it was too difficult.
The fingerprints of course had thrown a wrench into that theory, and Sherlock was both annoyed at having been proven wrong and thrilled at the prospect of a challenge, and their awkwardness was forgotten for the time being.
It was a nice feeling. And then, again, Sherlock locked eyes with her. It was purely coincidental, and yet, when he stopped to look at her, it felt as though he had invaded her mind, and gone through her thoughts, seen her free herself from him, in a way.
"What does it matter to you?" It was a cold and curious question, not yet progressed to the point where he could understand the depth and genuineness of John's concern.
It sounds like it needs a little more explaining, and so I say, "For helping me believe that I could, you know, kick the bottle."
John hadn’t raided Sherlock’s bedroom for quite a while, too busy with Rosie and the cases, and because he hadn't thought about anything, he hadn't had a clue about the troubles stirring in Sherlock's brain.
Part of him was angry with himself, wasn't this what he had wanted all along? Why had he flirted with her and come down every time to see her out?
"It should have been sooner. We deserve so much. So much. Christ, Sherlock, why did we wait for so long?" He burried his face in Sherlock's chest, sobbing, "So much time lost. Can't we turn back time?"
Perhaps, it is your way of caring, being candid. Or maybe you do not know the extent of damage your words do.
name, isn't it fair that I know yours?" John waited with a small smile, sliding his tongue over his lips.
Now came the moment that Sherlock most dreaded. He might have enjoyed it, but he did not trust himself to hold back. So he decided to get on with it quickly.
"So, John, how does it feel to be romantically entangled with the heartless detective?" She said the word heartless mockingly, as if they both knew that it wasn't true.
John had to restrain himself from taking the man in front of him into his arms, to beg for forgiveness and return things to normal. But this Sherlock did not even know John's name.
"Now, as I was saying," Mycroft continued, like he hadn't just threatened John, "a few guidelines. Don't attract too much attention, don't talk to too many people. Here is some money dated 2010, a cap and glasses for a disguise," Mycroft handed John a wallet, presumably full with cash, and a blue plain cap and dark sunglasses.
"Uh, no actually, I haven't read the papers yet." John said, looking up at Sherlock expectantly, who'd been up who knew how long.
"Oh, she doesn't. But this is probably to wish us a happily married life, and provably an invite to a session to teach me how to master action in bed."
Their heads grew closer together, and John's heart was beating, quick and erratic, as he thought of how Mary's lips would taste.
“we’ll take a break”, he said awkwardly, “And then practice once with the music.” He hurriedly went to his own bedroom, leaving John standing there.
He indeed did. Wearing a matching tux as Sherlock's, his silver hair were combed backwards, as Sherlock had taken a likening to, John stood still with Harry fluttering around him, making little adjustments, and looking at him critically, as if to find imaginary mistakes. There was only one difference between the way Sherlock wore it, and the way John did. Sherlock looked like an aristocrat, whereas John, like a army man, a commander, if you will. Harry stepped back a little, allowing Mrs Hudson to take over, and as the latter chatted excitedly, Harry looked at them, warmth flooding her chest.
Of course, John did not make the mistake of staring back into the detective's eyes. He had once before, foolishly, found himself staring into those blue-- no green, a bit of golden maybe? Those indescribable coloured-- eyes, and had found himself wondering what it would be like to look at them up close.
Then the older Holmes took his wrist, strapped the wristband onto John's right hand and John saw that under a leather flap on the band, a variety of buttons and screens were lighting up, chiefly among them a big red button.
He packed away the chemicals and test tubes for later use, as John busied himself by sitting on his old chair, and looking around. nothing had changed. Of course it hadn’t. Why did he assume his departure was important enough to produce any change?
Hey guys. We're only one chapter away,  and yes Sherlock finally decided. Aah.  Has this been wild...
They stayed like this for a moment, tasting each other, but chastely, trying to calm down their respective hearts and 'living in the moment' the best they could.
The atmosphere in the Baker Street living room was warm, cozy. Both the detective and his doctor were quite content after a dinner of rather good Chinese.
John chuckles. “Hardly masters of deduction, are they? Anyway, we should probably head out now. Bring your coffee with you.”
If you were to ask John Watson the same question, he would panic briefly, pausing for thought, before remembering that he was still in the timeline where they met at St. Barts, and tell you exactly that.
John woke up to find clothes lying on his bed, neatly folded into a red, yellow and black square. Of course. The uniform for the tournament.
“Of course not. She and her entire forensics team couldn’t solve the case after three dead bodies. This woman -“ Sherlock gestured to the body on the floor – “needs the best minds to solve this case, and it just so happens that the next best one available is yours.”
They came up to the door outside Sherlock’s flat, and they just stood there, Sherlock not moving to unlock the door, and John hovering.
The taxi drives away, and John is left waiting for the next cab to come along, so he can drive to the other end of London.
“You won’t forget. You’ve spent the last month constantly practicing with Sherlock and us.” Molly pointed out. “Besides, if you can remember the content for twenty different exams and practicals, getting all Es and Os, then you can remember stuff for the tournament.”
The words make him smile. Sherlock loves doing this for John - John doesn't mock him or treat him like a performing monkey to throw peanuts at and laugh at. He listens in fascination. Still, Sherlock shakes his head. "That's not fair. We're in a village. Everyone knows everyone around here. You could ask old Agatha over there for his life details and she'd be able to tell you the weight he was at birth and the fact that he once got into trouble with the police for marijuana possession, and that his mother is a dear who always contributes to the cake stall with her homemade mini-meringues."
Over dinner, it feels like they talk about everything and nothing: the ballet they've just seen, Sherlock's childhood days sneaking into ballet lessons when he was supposed to be with his nanny, the weather, John's rugby experiences, school, Redbeard (who Sherlock still misses terribly, if the weak smile and distant look in his eye when he came up is any indication).
"Lila Madison. Dead twenty-four hours," Lestrade informs them from the doorway. "She was found by the postman, who saw her body lying there through the window, and called 999 immediately. The door was unlocked and there was no sign of a break in when we found her, so she obviously knew and trusted the murderer enough to let them in. The same goes for the other two victims."
I can't imagine what you're going through right now, but I'm glad you're feeling at least a little bit better. Storing Redbeard's things away can't be a particularly pleasant experience. I don't know whether you will find it better to leave them out or not, but it's up to you. Is it the right time to do that? I mean, it's only been five days and you probably don't want to rush the whole moving on thing. But then again, I've never had a dog, so I wouldn't know if it was too soon.
"Need to know what, John? How I have made a fool of myself?" Sherlock said bitterly. He hated, in that moment, every feeling of affection he had ever felt for John. How could he have ever thought John would reciprocate his ridiculous sentiments? He was afraid that John would unravel them, and then look at him in disgust as he picked up Rosie and walked away; out of the room, and out of his life. He couldn't lose John, not again.
“Yes, John.” Sherlock beamed, as proud as John was. “Good work.” The detective’s smile was contagious, and soon John was grinning too. Thumbing through the report, Sherlock continued.
It was just nine in the morning when John woke up, sunlight nastily falling right on his sleepy eyelids. He opened his eyes, slightly disoriented, and froze.
It will all be fine, John thought, I have enough money to temporarily stay somewhere, and then I can continue at the clinic and--
"Both of you, stop talking!" Mycroft thundered, his patience wearing thin. Both John and Sherlock immediately stopped their bickering, "now that you have made this mistake, we must turn it to our advantage. John," there was a pause, "you will write a blog post every five days, about your life with Sherlock."
On his nightstand lay only his phone, a cigarette and a silver lighter. His phone had received a solitary text from Mycroft.
This is about Mary Watson. I know a lot of people think that she is bad and all, but this Mary is what John imagined her to be.
"Sherlock, rest now. I will check your temperature after a few hours." I am about to leave, when I hear you mutter something.
He reached out to graze his fingers against the cool metal of the knocker and the rectangular plate that had in it engraved the letters “221B” that John called 'home' in his head. His touch was reverent, trying to map it out under his touch and preserve in his memory, even though soon he'd remember none of it. Closing his eyes, he inhaled the scent of the wood, the air around him and London in general- the place that both he and Sherlock loved.
This seemed to have hit a nerve somewhere, because Sherlock's neck swerved towards John, defiance etched into his features, plain as daylight. "Again, I'm not a five year old, I am capable of making my own decisions, and if I decide to become unclean, there is nothing that Mycroft can do to prevent it. I have done so before, and as he's already remarked 'rehab doesn't have much of an impression on me'. So tell Mycroft to piss off."
“No, it’s okay.” Sherlock spoke, turning to face John, “It felt quite good. Is this what couples do to each other John?”
"Oh, my assistants will email you the content. You will write it in your own words," that sounded a lot like '
The air was knocked out of him as he realised fully the meaning of never seeing Sherlock again after a month.
John and Sherlock meet again. This time, at Angelos, and simultaneously do a stakeout to catch a criminal.
As I add my final touches, you talk about your honeymoon, and Sherlock. You talk like you're in constant awe of him, but not with the blind admiration of a puppy, but of someone who's seen his devils. Seen him conquer them. Like you're proud of him for doing it. And now I can see you two, old and fragile, holding hands, smiling like two lovesick fools. But you deserve it, you know. And I really am happy for you.
Taking the phone out from his pocket, Mycroft dialed Sherlock's number. He let the phone ring five times, then cut the call.
We never shared John Watson, Sherlock. Because that would mean that half of his heart was mine. No,.Sherlock, you always had his heart and his love, I had just borrowed it.
And I should thank you. Because you helped, helped me get rid of the drinks. You, Sherlock and Clara. She came back to me after everything, when I was at my worst. It was then, I realized, how grateful I am for having her in my life. It's like Sherlock, isn't it,  he's changed you too. I know he was the one who forced you to meet me again, and help me kick the bottle. He helped you trust me. But it's not just that.
Aaaaaaaa another chapter, hope you guys are liking it, and please leave kudos or comments if you do like it!
"And so today, I will be giving Sherlock a specimen, on how to not prepare a best man speech as if you're in love with the groom. " At this Sherlock reddened, and laughed embarrassed, and John looked at Shelrock with adoration in his eyes. Everyone who had been to the mentioned wedding couldn't have agreed more, and resounding laughter echoed in the room.
He reached for the remote, turned the telly off, and settled comfortably into the couch, already apologizing for another night that his back would have to survive sleeping on a 'not-bed'.
I knew it on the day we had our first date. It seems like a lifetime ago, probably because it is. Back then, when you were still grieving over Sherlock.
"Shh-shh." Sherlock's voice was calm over John's own, which was really the result of a tremendous amount of self control. John needed him, and he had always given John his all. "John. We don't need to turn back time. I have never felt that the time we spent together was a waste. Every second with you is a pleasure." It seemed as though he had rehearsed it a million times, but as the words spewed out uncontrollably, Sherlock surprised himself. He was not very good at expressing emotions. Until now, probably.
At the table, when Sherlock returned, a rose the colour of blood, passion, a deep red that was almost a black, and yet not quite that, lay, with a card attached to it.
Mycroft only glared in reply and Continued, "She calls herself 'The Doctor' and has previously been of much help in protecting the country.
name seems familiar. You are John Watson, partner in crime of the famous, or rather, now infamous Sherlock Holmes.
This time however, they couldn't bring themselves to laugh. Something about their whole demeanor had changed. John's hands felt sweaty as his fingers brushed Sherlock's cheek, his tongue paralyzed, his heart nearly bursting out of his rib cage.
The people who fall in love with you Sherlock, there's a bug, a defect in their wiring.The people who love you, Sherlock. They can never stop. Never fall out of love with you. They might love others, but they will never stop loving you. However little , however detached.
“Get into position, John.” John placed a hand on Sherlock’s waist, still fascinated on how slender and delicate it seemed placed in John’s hand, and placed the other in Sherlock’s hand. He looked up and was surprised to see the amount of softness in his eyes.
“Oh, Sherlock. Have you let your emotions slip away? couldn’t resist Johnny boy, could you? oh!” she gasped mockingly, “and he’s going to get married! How very unbecoming of you Sherlock. But you will think of something. After all, brainy is the new sexy.” She sat on top of his bed, arms wrapped around her chest, and smirking as though she knew something he didn't, vanished.
They were, moreover, getting used to each others' close proximity, and didn't flinch or freeze or do anything of the sort if the other touched him anymore.
Then, they were both laughing, giggling. Mary made a few annoyed remarks, and then they did attempt to calm down, but some brief eye contact set them off once again. It was some time before they could be anywhere near serious.
He lit the cigarette and inhaled deeply. It was a low quality, high tar, and it made him cough from the unfamiliarity, but it was perfect. It was strong enough to meet his needs.
It was the next day, when the afternoon was fading into the oncoming evening, when the trio started their tour of how John and Sherlock Holmes had truly met.
John remembered all the praises he'd lavished at Sherlock the night before and wondered if this was what it had looked like to everyone else around them.
He removed his hand from john’s and placed it on his back instead, indicating john to do the same. As a result, they had to step closer, and Sherlock’s increased heart-rate didn’t aid him much, except make him worry that john would hear it. and then he would know everything. Then he would lose john. Something, that he could not bear to happen.
"It hurts Mycroft. It feels as though I have been physically injured." And then, with the whimsical reasoning of a child, "Make it go away."
Mary chuckled, drawing John away from his thoughts. "You're a loyal man indeed, John." This time, there was a sting to her words.
Mycroft paused for a moment, then with his face contorted as if there was a lemon was in his mouth, said something. He had lowered his voice, to make his words inaudible to John.
He pushed open the doors, walking into the lab, trying not to fidget, his entire body shifting to battlefield mode. Sherlock looked up from the petri dish he was examining and experimenting on. His attention snapped onto John and the latter felt exposed.
You look happy, Sherlock. You don't look so sad anymore. Not like the day, when I told you you look sad, when you think he can't see you. You still look a little sad sometimes, when you think no one's around. But it's different now. As though the thing that made you so sad, is simply a memory of the past, tinged with a little melancholy. As if you let go of it. That's good isn't it?
"I need to know, if you feel the same way. If you- if you--" John choked a little, and at the same moment Sherlock looked into John's eyes, and he knew.
John had wanted to ask where they were going, but said nothing knowing he wouldn't get an answer, and walked behind Mycroft, still doubting the latter's sanity.
I chuckle at this, and gently caress your forehead. It burns at my touch, and I recoil my hand with an exclamation.
His eyes looked so broken, Mycroft thought, and anger seared in his chest, and for a moment he contemplated physical harm to John Watson. He knew better, though, and distancing himself from Sherlock, prepared to leave.
They would strike him before too, in the time before their current 'practicing', as he and Sherlock would be doing a household chore, or researching together.
And with that she walked away, behind the nearest pillar. John knew that if he checked there would be no one behind it.
They chatted for some time, and suddenly Mrs Hudson recollected the mantlepiece Mary had bought. “I had no idea why she bought it, but really, it was ever so nice of her!” She exclaimed, “I asked her to stay for a cup of tea of course, but she was just in such a hurry, and then you came down, John.”
Throughout the day, they sat in close proximity to one another, often holding hands, or with an arm around each other, and once both had gotten over the initial shock of close contact, it was actually quite comfortable, John thought.
It of course, caught John's attention immediately. "The Woman again? I didn't know she still texted you."
For a split second, there was darkness and John felt as though he was floating in a void, before his feet were suddenly on the ground again and John buckled under the sudden pressure that gravity exerted on him.
The detective and his army doctor left the Yard in good spirits, picking up some takeaway, and even stopping by Mrs Hudson to have a cup of tea with her.
"Yes, doctor Watson. Consider yourself on a 'lockdown'. One of my agents will constantly be at your call and will bring any necessities you ask for. Mrs Hudson can go in and out, as long as she uses the back door."
"Hey," your voice is cautious. "I told mum and dad, okay? They'll understand, Harry. We're family. And family always sticks together."
What Jared McArthy didn’t know, however, was that the pills he’d been planning to use to drug his father-in-law were the same ones that the latter had already been prescribed.
Suddenly his entire expression softened, and he looked up at John briefly before looking down at his phone screen again.
Our date is over by seven, and it seems too early to have dinner. So we stand outside the cafe, looking at each other, trying to make small talk, anything to stall the inevitable. That we have to leave. Suddenly we both fall silent. We have nothing to say. Our eyes meet, and we laugh at the awkwardness of it all. And then it all fades away, with the realization of what is to happen next in both our eyes evident. And then you lean forward, and my heart races. You are going to kiss me. This is the moment that will define our relationship.
John fumbled a bit in the beginning, and almost tripped, which might have brought both of them to the ground, but Sherlock caught him by the waist in time, and jerked John towards him.
“Actually, you know, with the wedding going on, you being best man and all that, there is a small favour that I wanted to ask.” His hand reached out to rub his neck, showing embarrassment.
The tension between them was straining as it increased each day, pushed forward by the weight of the things unspoken between them. There was an urgent need to talk, to discuss things. To settle old scores. To be rid of the past that had settled, John knew, on Sherlock too, making his shoulders sag under it pressure.
It had been a silent afternoon, as each marinated in the awkwardness, dancing around each other in awkward circles, far from resuming the ‘Practice in Intimacy’ that they were supposed to.
It was three hours later, when Rosie had been given some toys to play with, seeing that sleep was no longer an option, that the door below opened, and footsteps ascended the stairs, John breathed a sigh of relief. The handle turned, and John wasn't sure whether he would be relieved or scared at what was behind the door.
He could imagine Sherlock in a dark dump somewhere, high on drugs, a list loosely hanging from his fingertips.
But that's it. That is were I stop Every time, Sherlock. Because I never know what it feels like to kiss you.
John gulped, sending a silent prayer to whoever it was that was looking down at them from the heavens. This man had no business saying things like that with
He simply stood there, breathing. Not knowing whether to jump off a roof like Sherlock had, or dissolve right here and now into a puddle of sobs.
An absolutely sinister thought crossed his mind, and before his rationality could stop him, he blurted, “You could lie with your head in my lap y'know. You'd be more comfortable that way.”
This had become a pastime of his, he supposed, looking at the detective as he slept-- admiring the soft features and innocent expression.
John was still for a moment. He had forgotten that Sherlock was listening too,and now the lanky git was reading snippets from his blog! "Give me that! How did you get to it so quickly?" John snatched at the phone in vain, blushing horribly.
John's shoulders sagged under the weight of his current circumstance, and he wanted to stop all of it by the sheer intensity of his desire to do so.
He looked at Sherlock with such fierce emotion, that for a moment, the latter stood shocked. He had not expected John to love him back- and never so much.
But they aren't, here in the real world, they aren't. Not mine to claim. But even so, when you kiss me on the cheek, I get that glimpse, a glimpse of all that could be. Your lips, they aren't soft and smooth. They are a little cracked and rough, with a firmness to them. Like every action they partake in, every word they utter, is final. But there is a surprising caution to the kiss. It's just as unsure as it is tender.
You kiss me on the cheek, ever so tenderly. I have thought about it,how your lips would feel. They aren't anything like I have imagined. In my imagination, they are soft like rose petals, and they taste like something, I never know what it is, but it's somehow you. And there, you kiss me like my lips are the only place where yours belong.
Then, unable to hold it in any longer, they simultaneously turned around to face each other, and froze when they found the other staring into their eyes.
For their faces were close. Close enough for John to see the wrinkles that were slowly becoming more pronounced, the faint hint of grey at Sherlock's temples. The tenderness of the eyes that held his own, the galaxies hidden in them. It stirred something inside him.
He had been so alone. And then, like a miracle, John Watson had entered his life. He owed john so much. Too much. He had to convince John to stay. He had always believed that it was the danger that the work provided that kept John here in Baker Street. And so he made his plea.
that you didn't want to sleep and were doing experiments. Why?" John really hoped the hurt hadn't been too evident in his voice.
John was surprised at the smile that the idea left on his face, and the warm feeling that seemed to radiate from him.
With that he sat on the armchair, and Sherlock sat at the foot of it on the carpet, every notion of pride or dignity thrown to the wind.
Once everyone was settled, the priest began with the verses, and though Rosie tried to concentrate at first, some of the words went above her head, and she gave up. Instead, she looked at her dads, and smiled.
“No, no. Sorry,” John said, not hiding his laughter, and most certainly not sorry at all. “It’s alright, lie down.”
John's jaw clenched, his senses heightened, his eyes roamed over Sherlock, looking for signs. Sherlock's eyes were blown wide, his hands a little shaky. John stopped mid sentence, his breath caught momentarily, anger quickly rising. He wanted nothing more than to strangle Sherlock to the ground.
When he finally came to, he found himself in a large room, his vision hazy and his mind foggy, his mouth completing the word he'd lost halfway through.
Sherlock looked up sharply at him at this, as if analysing him, and John stammered a little, "by, er, help I mean- I mean that y'know I'll tell you when you aren't being a 'bit not good'. And then you can work on that, yeah?"
hand rest on the other's thigh, rub circles on the detective's hand, inch a little closer, stare just a little longer.
"Not my fault you weren't there." Was all the detective would say, with a small frown, but John couldn't help that small surge of pride.
"List them out? All the usual things that you do, haven't you ever been in a relationship?" Mary meant it as a harmless query perhaps, but Sherlock looked distinctly uneasy, and an embarrassed blush spread over his cheeks as he looked down, avoiding John's gaze.
The way Sherlock always wore long sleeves these days, the way he didn't come out for hours from his room, and when questioned said he was doing an experiment. And John hadn't given it a second thought.
Now that Rosie’s name was mentioned enough times to gain her attention fully, she gave a low cry to voice her despair at her parents arguing. John moved towards her, shushing her with a quick reassurance that everything was okay.
Sherlock's eyes were rimmed with red from crying, and he looked tired; no, drained was the word, for it seemed as though a person has physically drained every ounce of will that he had.
And then a moan emitted from his phone. The people near him stopped for a moment, unable to figure out the source of the sound, and turned away again.
"Good morning, Sherlock." John said politely, joining him at the window. "What's causing all the fu--" He stopped mid sentence, as he got his answer without the detective having to say anything.
Yeah, I married John to Sarah! I wanted to experiment in a world where John married someone normal. Not a secret assassin, just a normal person. And I did like Sarah a lot.
"Mycroft! At least spare her from your antics." Sherlock sounded dramatically tired of it all, and John wouldn't have thought a theatrical slump of shoulders and sigh amiss.
“Well then, sir, what must we do next?” John’s voice had the mock-sincerity of a pupil to his teacher.
Trying his best to sound mature and serious, John cleared his throat and nodded, “They do Sherlock.”
"John, due to the architecture of baker Street, the two bedrooms in your flat are clearly visible to the person in the opposite building. There are a few old women living in adjacent flats who have a direct view to them, and are quite eager to talk to the press about everything that they see.
She listened with great pleasure, as she always did with the cases, to their story, and whatever awkwardness of the morning was left, for the moment, had eased away.
Sherlock's eyes widened, at first, their grey irises slowly consumed by the black of his pupil, until he was completely distracted from anything else, even breathing, and settling Rosie in the corner of the bathtub, eagerly grabbed John's neck, pulling him closer, reciprocating enthusiastically. His hands were soapy and wet, but neither minded, and soon they pulled apart, albeit hesitantly, purely for the need of air, panting.
"Shut up, Sherlock!" John's voice was dangerously low, "You know that nobody can ever replace you. And it was never I who left you, you did." He pointed a finger accsusingly at Sherlock.
A mock cry of surprise that John was going to emit was cut short by a genuine one, as an odd sensation pulled his stomach, and John descended into darkness.
Press that, John thought, and all the pain would be over. Press that and he would never know what he'd lost.
Scared though he was, Sherlock kept his eyes wide open: for he didn’t want to blink—lots of things can happen in the blink of an eye. It was idiotic yes; sentimental, but he couldn’t care less. All he did care about was John. Now. His face, marked with lines of hardship, worry; the last few years, Sherlock noted with a slight dismay—had taken a toll on him. but all these lines, for now, were softened—with an expression Sherlock could not point put exactly—but it was surely an expression of calm, bliss. He had never seen it before.
The rescuing of Harry Watson, and the unveiling of her brother's. The past that they'd always kept in silence, finally catches up.
His laughter was contained at first, but then he burst into a fit of giggles, marvelling at the ridiculousness of the situation.
Two more chapters to go!!! (maybe three),  until the end.  Gawddddd Poor John. And poor Sherlock.  What choice will he make? Only god knows (and maybe I do).
The sinking feeling that he'd done something wrong wouldn't evade him no matter how much he tried to rationalise it away.
John imagined pale white hands with long elegant fingers holding the syringe, shaky with anticipation. If thoughts could physically injure, this had come close enough for John. But he did nothing as the man disappeared behind the door.
He opened his eyes, made a brave attempt at keeping his voice and determination strong. He failed at both.
"Stand in front of the mirror, Sherlock." she said to him, and he obediently turned, so that they could look at his reflection.
Rushing downstairs, I bring up a tray of water with ice cubes bobbing in it. I stay with you for th next two hours. I take the cloth soaked in the ice cold water, and press it onto your forehead. It's a tedious process that I have to continue, but I never complain. All that matters is that the fever should fade away. There is a sheen of sweat all over your body, and you look slightly delirious because your lips twitch a little, and you look sick, Sherlock. Properly ill, and so I take care of you. Then the temperature starts to fall, and though not wanting to leave you, I know you need your rest, and so I know I should let you sleep.
John found out that all his 'preaching skills' had been used up quickly, and he felt very awkward now, sitting there under the detectives dissecting gaze.
From morning IST to evening IST, because my 11th grade college has started, and I've to travel a lot.
And then, things changed little by little. Perhaps It was the presence of a child, that the domesticity that they had always shared, escalated to new heights.
a comfortable pose, but really, the chair was no place to sleep and suddenly, John felt very angry and concerned and a little hurt.
The next day John woke up to a brighter room than he was used to, and a lot of noise that he wasn't used to, coming from the outside of the house. Even busy streets did not have this much commotion in the mornings. He checked a clock on the nightstand, it was ten past nine now. He'd slept longer than usual.
He cried all night, a result of both pent up emotions and the drugs. He mourned his unrequited love, and it's extent, cried for the hurt it caused him, and for the hurt it was about to.
"Umm, okay. But what should I even write?" John wasn't sure if he could effortlessly make up a smooth tale of his and Sherlock's romance, when there was none.
John had been taken by surprise when Sherlock had grabbed him by the waist and dipped him. Had he not known Sherlock, he would have thought the action to be one done in the spur of emotions. But then, it was Sherlock he was talking about. The man with no heart. he had probably done this to catch John’s attention, thinking his mind to be diverted, he reassured himself. However, his quickening heartbeat did not seem satisfied.
, mom?" Your voice has risen to a shout, John, you've never done that before. For a moment I am taken by surprise at the anger in your voice. "I see a scared girl, suffering from peer pressure, and doing all of this, because she wants acceptance. And the one who made her feel like that are her parents. She probably hates her guts now, dad. Please. " Your voice breaks a little, you sound tired. "She's family. We can't do that to her." There's silence. You storm off.
"But you do not, I understand, feel for him as a best friend should. You feel something more." At this a sob, this time more audible escaped Sherlock.
Standing up quietly from Lestrade's side, he first looked at the room, then. At Sherlock, and taking a deep breath, began, "Brother mine, as you know, I have always despised sentiment, and everything that comes with it. I have always considered it to be a chemical defect, a weakness." There was no sound except those of his even, carefully spoken words, and as he looked at Sherlock, who had grown stiff. Sherlock knew that Mycroft did not approve of sentiments.
For John, the nightmares came. He would wake up in the middle of the night, in cold sweat, shaking, disoriented. And then, like magic, music would float in from the living room, calm, tranquilizing notes from the violin that soothed him and helped him go back to sleep.
Should it have made John as hot and bothered as he felt? Probably not. But then again, John had not snogged or gotten a leg up in quite some time, which really, he explained to himself, made up for everything without the slightest bit of doubt. Just a bit touch starved.
Sherlock danced on, and for the first time, his mind was blank. Blank so that all he could see was John, the sun in John’s hair- making it glow, like a halo around his head. Like an angel- his angel. Sherlock’s angel. The angel, who had always been there for him; who watched over him, saved him, over and over and over again. but this frightened him, for this blankness, this feeling of completeness of just being in the moment was new to him. he quickly tried to summon the digits of pi. All that came was a random, floating thought:
He sighed, and using a remote that he found in a coat pocket, he switched on something behind John, who stood there frozen.
Sherlock feigned breathing out loudly, “Thank goodness! Honestly, I couldn’t care more.” “Shut up you git!” they laughed in unison, and something of the knot in Sherlock’s stomach seemed to have eased slightly.
One that he could shout from the rooftops now. His voice was scratchy and his hands shaky, when he issued out four more words.
John looked away hastily, forcing the thought out of his mind, and pretended to look out of the window.
There's a pause, and I close my eyes, waiting for you to say yes. Say that you see it, see what a mess I've become.
There was such wonder in the gaze Sherlock cast upon John, but it was only momentary, before the impressive facade fit back into place. "How much longer has Mycroft asked you to spy on me?"
Anyways, two more chances to go. Maybe he won't need all of them, but the fic name IS "third times a charm" so...
The impulse to do things that he wouldn't have dared to do before-- nothing untoward-- just those stupid, mundane fantasies about domesticity.
He walked on without knowing where he was going, and when he stopped to see his location- his eyes rimmed red and slight tremors running down his body- he found himself at Baker Street.
Lestrade tried to defend Sherlock, John decided to talk to Sherlock, and everything goes awry when John gets a phone call.
John tries, a second time, the approach of distracting Sherlock, and learns more about the man he was before he met John.
This time when the darkness gave way to blinding sunlight, John was prepared. While he still stumbled, he did not completely lose his balance, and in a minute or two, he was ready for action.
"Victor turns out to be a complete /connard/ and your feelings for John remains strong and unrequited."
John watched as they walked out of the Great Hall, heaving an irrepressible sigh of relief that that experience was far less awkward than imagined.
Sherlock walks off to his room, leaving John alone with the client. “Right,” he says brightly. “Tea?”
Irene: We have a lot in common: both English lit students, both lesbians, and both in agreement that the Heterosexuals(tm) get everything wrong about Twelfth Night, and only we have the wisdom and insight to properly direct it
Sherlock whined, 'No', turning over with his back facing John and curling up stubbornly into a ball underneath the covers, heat be damned.  "This is completely unfair."
"Mycroft has found some new intel on her. Though we're uncertain about most things, we know she's far more dangerous than I initially suspected."
When his friends turn around they immediately greet John with cheers, pats on backs, hugs. "We were wondering when you were going to get here," says Liam - a boy on his rugby team, currently accompanied by his soulmate Rebecca, who smiles awkwardly at him. John wonders if he could get her and Sherlock to talk, in case they ever feel left out at any point in the evening.
They walk down the street until they come to the theatre, a large queue flowing into it, posters for various plays and musicals and shows adorning its walls and windows. Sherlock blinks in surprise at John. "I thought we weren't - "
The suspect has run off. All they did was knock on the door to his flat to ask him some questions about the bank he used to work at, after a full day of research and questioning witnesses, and yet this sent him into a panic, the door bursting open as the suspect flew past them and down the stairs into the streets. Sherlock and John simply glanced at each other, nodded once, then ran after him: the chase begins, John’s favourite part of their cases together.
He would not remember complaining that the school's pedantic traditions wouldn't allow for a camera system so they could actually see what was saying, and his friends agreeing.
Sherlock begrudgingly took a chicken drumstick and nibbled at it. 'I don't enjoy this part of our dynamic.'
“I also know the numbers for the lottery next week.” Lies. But he’s caught his attention now. “Five hundred thousand rubles, I believe it’s worth. Should be enough to put a dent in your debt and start to live independently from your sister. As a real
Sherlock reaches behind him and brings out John's cane. John's smile fades as he stares in bewilderment, eyes flicking between the object and the person in front of him. He didn't even notice that he had gone the whole day without a limp. "But I - how?!"
John pulled his wand out of his pocket and shouted, "Expelliamus!" causing the Milverssen to fly back away from him and land in a heap in the sand, only to stand back up again with an even bigger grin, exposing sharp yellow canines.
First of all, congratulations on your new job. I'm sure you'll be excellent at all the coffee-making and the coffee-serving and dealing with stubborn customers with wailing babies. I personally can't imagine a more hellish place to work. It would be hard for me to stick to the 'customer is always right' rule when usually it is the customers who are so incredibly, annoyingly wrong: holding up queues with long, complex orders, complaining about petty manners they feel entitled to. Not to mention how the steam from the coffee makers would make my hair frizz. So I applaud your patience and strength in this truly challenging time.
"Well, I wouldn't have done it if I had known that Sherlock Holmes had such a sensitive stomach," He teased.
"I'm not 'nervous'. I'm on a level way beyond 'nervous.'" He poured himself some cereal, looked down at it, then grimaced and pushed it away.
John's last thought before he fell asleep was whether Sherlock looking away was intentional, and what word could identify the colour of Sherlock's eyes. He settled on a word he once heard some time ago - "resplendent". He wasn't even 100% what it meant - he just knew it was right.
Sherlock looks younger than he has looked in a while, his grin spread across his face and his blue-green eyes bright with mirth. He says goodnight, agreeing that they need their rest now, and John’s eyes follow him as he walks to his room, stripping off his suit jacket as he does -
As the summer turns cool and the leaves turn dry and brown, Mary remains a constant, standing by his side even when he wakes her up with night terrors, letting her eyes glass over in sympathy when he brings Sherlock up of his own accord without her prompting, jovially saying 'whatever you like!' whenever John asks what they wanted to do for date night every Saturday. She is warm and inviting and as predictable as the sun's rotations. (No - Earth's rotations. Dear God, Sherlock is probably laughing in his grave.)
“Good. Ok, I have to go now. The house is suspiciously quiet, which means I have about an hour of undisturbed study time before some kind of hell breaks loose. I’ll talk to you soon, yeah?”
He unfolded the newspaper and looked up at the headline, in large, bold letters. 'RIDING OFF INTO THE
I look up, surprised. Of course I am. You never apologize, Sherlock. You never have. Have I broken through, Sherlock? All those barriers, that facade of never feeling, have I seen through it? But then it strikes me. It isn't me. It's never me, is it? With you, at least. It's John. Always been him, come to think of it. He's changed you, hasn't he? Can you feel now, Sherlock? And what do you feel? Do you love him? I suppose you do.
Instead, he reached out to Rosie, murmuring that everything was okay and that he'd be back soon, left her amidst her toys the argument forgotten, took his coat, and stepped into the winter evening, the cold wind sharp as a slap in his face.
To be honest,he might have overdone the laughing, seeing as it was irritating Sherlock no end, obvious from the deathly glare directed at him. He eventually stopped, and placed a hand on Sherlock's waist, albeit a little awkwardly.
John woke up to sunlight planting soft kisses on his skin and the pleasant hazy buzz of having slept well. That, however, was falsehood, since John had spent the better part of the night researching "Sherlock Holmes".
Having to endure Sherlock's low baritone up close had not helped matters at all, not to mention this new side of Sherlock-- comfortable with this intimacy as opposed to the Sherlock who'd been reluctant to snuggle up to John the other day.
There was the detective, pulled down by sorrow. Sorrow caused by John. It pained him to see Sherlock reduced to this state. It killed him to know that he himself was the reason.
And then, when he couldn't speak anymore, he found the strength for one more sentence. His confession.
He lay in bed, silently for a few minutes, his face sticky with the aftermath of tears, and lips dry and parched.
"Very well. " Mycroft paused. He straightened up a bit. "I see that you and my brother have been having... arguments very frequently these days. I'm disappointed to know that you didn't find out about his activities sooner."
"Of course you do. You understand everything John, but nothing at all." Sherlock was surprised at the extent of bitterness in his own voice.
"I sometimes don't know what you are thinking, Sherlock." I mutter, mostly to myself, but you are close enough to hear it. "Chasing criminals, and what not in the streets when it's raining cats and dogs outside."
Both of them looked anywhere but at each other, feeling a warm feeling like a gentle flame bloom in their chests.
It had a visible effect on Sherlock. For a second he stood with his lips slightly parted, and then stood up straighter, clearing his throat, his voice constrained when he spoke, "Fine then. We will follow the new sleeping arrangements."
Sighing, with his chest feeling strangely hollow, he tried to distract himself, and not face Sherlock lest he picked up on something. But inevitably, every few seconds he caught himself looking at the reflection of the detective's face in the window.
"Follow? But didn't your brother specifically ask us to stay indoors?" John had asked, as ever the voice of reason, and Sherlock had huffed in a manner that made John sure he'd acted just like this when he was seven, complaining about Mycroft.
John's features contorted in concern. "No Sherlock! You can't use again. I mean, Lestrade's given you a case, why do you need drugs for stimulation?" John's voice, though level in its own way, was somewhat disbelieving at its edges, as if what Sherlock had said defied some basic laws of the universe.
"Dear god," Mary sighed, "I'm not asking you to go French or get off right here, y'know? A simple peck on the lips is enough."
Anyways I thoroughly enjoyed putting John in one of the most frustrating situations ever: yOu have to make a decision, but someone else or some circumstance makes it for you, and you suddenly realize what you wanted all along. And the SHEER AMOUNT OF FRUSTRATION that follows.
Finally, having recovered enough to stand up, John got back on his feet, leaning on the wall a bit, then, shaking himself vigorously, he proceeded towards the door of 221 Baker Street, stopping in front of it.
Mycroft was taken aback for a moment. He had rarely seen his brother this passionate. But he chose to carry on slowly; Sherlock on drugs was a man with no control, or idea of control: he would act instantaneously, and powerfully.
If only adorable could explain the rush of affection John felt for the detective, and when Sherlock scrunched up his nose in displeasure, John couldn't take it anymore.
There was complete silence in the room, for no one had suspected that Mycroft Holmes would have any interest in sentiments, especially where marriage was concerned.
Exasperated, Mycroft asked him, "What did you think, Sherlock, that John would be waiting for you when you came back, and you could pick up where you left off?" The last sentence had a touch of incredulity.
Both the Johns and Sherlock unearth truths about both universes, as the tale begins to unfold in front of them.
By this time both of them were comfortably into the rhythm, and save a fumble or two from John, they danced pretty well.
Sherlock hummed, seeming more comfortable, and then, once again in synchronicity, they shifted to sleep on their backs, much more relaxed, and sleep seemed much easier.
I was so desperate, John, to get rid of my old life, and everything was going well until Magnusson came into picture. I shot Sherlock, John, that day, and it was a shot to kill. But somehow, I didn't. I couldn't. I missed a little, just enough so that you didn't die immediately. But you were supposed to die there, Sherlock, somehow you didn't. I thought then that perhaps It was your will to live that had been so strong. But it wasn't that, was it Sherlock? It was never the wish to live, but your love for John. You came back from the dead for him. Twice.
One might reasonably assume that John would have recovered his dignity in the time this explanation was given, but the situation there was even worse.
Also I've never written an action/fighting scene before, so please feel free to give any constructive criticism on it!
He tried to call her twice, but she didn't pick up, and texted her to call him, worrying slightly. He hoped to god she wasn't drinking heavily with shady strangers in some dingy bar. The thought made him shudder and also feel slightly guilty. He felt that he should have been there for her, but then again, he had been there for her plenty of times, only for her to go back to her old ways and show everyone that the drinking was more important than everything, even Clara.
His expression was calm, content-- a stark contrast from the chaotic frenzy that he was so often in. John liked the look a lot. Liked seeing all these different aspects of the man who seemed so ethereally untouchable and aloof most of the time. Not that John didn't like that smartass side of him that spewed deductions and clever insults faster than one could comprehend them. Maybe he liked all the different angles of Sherlock Holmes.
John, he really did love you, didn't he? He would go to the ends of the universe for you John. That's the thing with people like him. They love seldom, but they love with everything they've got. And you deserve that kind of love.
The drug was pumping through Sherlock's veins, and his cocaine-addled brain was shocked into silence at the mere thought of John leaving.
Before his existence as it was, was erased from the canvas of the universe, he had one final chance to record whatever he thought was relevant. Whatever that had to be preserved.
The John and Sherlock of the other universe bid goodbye to each other and the world, and the John and Sherlock of this universe say hello to a new future.
"Hello Mycroft." John did not possess much politeness at the moment, because he was still trying to figure out how his phone was here and what Sherlock had to do with it.
A little boy with a curious mind and a golden heart, who flings himself into the world, going on adventures, and figuring out the impossible. And underneath it all: a will to love, grieve, get angry, and be surpised with what the world has to offer, hidden only for the fear of getting hurt.
John walked about the flat for a while, looking at the experiments on the table, regretting when he saw something too alike the part of a human spleen. His eyes were constantly drawn to Sherlock's sleeping form, until he realised he was being a creep, and returned to their bedroom to try to sleep again.
"Just, be a bit more kinder to them the next time yeah? And," John chose his next words carefully, "if you, um, want me to that is, I can help you."
John looked at his shoes, then at the piles of papers on Mycroft's desk, and back at his shoes. He didn't know what to say.
John stared deeply into her eyes, and then looked away, silent for a few seconds, as if thinking about something, and then replied, "I suppose, I did. Yes, I did, didn't I?" He said the last sentence with a shake of his head, and a chuckle, looking down at his feet.
This is about Molly, her relationship with Sherlock. I also wanted her to let go a little, and so this is what it is about.
Abruptly, John drew back, with perhaps a mere inch between them, the overpowering feeling that he could not kiss Mary making him feel repulsed at their closeness.
Sherlock bent forward too, so that their faces were only centimeters apart. “John,” his voice seemed to have dropped an octave, “This is the part where you kiss Mary.”
The person who'd been following them had disappeared into the shadows. But there was a possibility that they would be followed further.
He idly mused that one day, perhaps he would have seen that face enough to pick out every wrinkle, every fold of the skin, every expression-- and then stopped himself hurriedly. No, it would not do to get carried away like this, he had promised himself.
What could he tell her anyway? That Sherlock was upset over a kiss that had never happened, that he himself felt guilty about it, that neither of them had the slightest right to have either of these feelings?
Sherlock turned around and went to the desk, fuming. John walked up to him, standing beside him, arms folded across the chest, "That's okay Sherlock, I'll help you go cold turkey. We'll do it together."
Is it wrong Sherlock, is it sinful to be jealous that I wasn't the one? The one to break this a barriers, the one to help you feel. The one you fall in love with.
It looked at him and shook its head, “There’s only so many times a boat can be repaired. If not the old wood, one of those patches will surely let water in.” Sherlock gulped, and took a deep breath. Surveying his.situation, he realized he had made no inappropriate gesture, and hadn't tried to make an advance on John. But he was almost sure John could read him emotions back there. Dilated pupils, hitched breath, pulse going crazy, and deepened voice. Could he have been any more obvious? He hoped John hadn’t read between the lines, and reassuring himself, looked into the mirror.
And John did seem content. Content as if there were no problems in the world, as if he had everything he could ever wish for. Content like this was the only place he belonged. In Sherlock's arms.
"Shut up you git." John said, smiling, and so Sherlock smiled back too, playfully dodging John's attempt to swat him.
He'd only just finished his rant when John's phone went off again and he left his place at the window to retrieve it. Sherlock peered over his shoulder, then made a 'hmfph' sound and sat on the chair by the window.
Then, with moisture prickling his eyes, he opened them, and brought his right wrist up, surveying the leather band.
. That didn't bear thinking about. John had not forgotten his scandalous moment of distraction that had only been saved by Mycroft's call.
"We'll have to stay in for one whole week?" It was more of a remark than a question from John's side. He'd only just met Sherlock, and he didn't know if the two of them would survive cooped up like that.
He couldn't help staring at this Sherlock, the man before John knew him, still in danger of succumbing to the high and so brilliant it hurt. He feared that without he himself being there for him, Sherlock would once again reach for the syringe, but he hoped, however unlikely it was, that his speech would help him.
That, and John couldn't stop staring at Sherlock's sleeping face, as that was when he actually noticed it.
He was about to open the drawer to get his and Sherlock's cups, also known as 'the few pieces of cutlery not subjected to human parts', when he felt two arms slide around his waist and a long body pressing against his back, warmth circulating through John's body at the warm embrace. It was pliant against John's back, moulding into his smaller frame.
He'd spent the first week with Harry, out of courtesy. He should have noticed something off about her by the bills scattered around the house, by the glasses of whiskey constantly waiting by the sink to be washed, by the dismissive hum Harry would give whenever Clara said she was off to work, buried in her messy notebook of ideas that couldn't quite form. He should have noticed by the first morning staying there. It took him three days, having been absorbed in his own loss and survivor’s guilt, while he was having breakfast with Harry.
John watches the plane turn back around, not noticing how beside him, the blood drains from Mary's face.
"Uh - yes. Oui. I am from...Le France." John stares incredulously at Sherlock, who mouths sorry, I panicked. John looks back at the lady before he gives himself away completely, and is pleased to know her face seems to have softened.
"Yes, well, I dislike having my photo taken, and Rosie is far more photogenic." John glances at a photo of Rosie drooling in her sleep, sceptical. Sherlock chuckles. "Ok, maybe, that's debatable. But still, I'm happy for this album to be Watson exclusive. I already took up far too much room in the first half."
"I wasn't intending for it to be, but I would win if it were." Sherlock grins. "Anyway, you'd best be on your way. I'll permit you one hour of sleep."
Just a quick note to say thanks for all your comments. Even if I don't reply I really appreciate them.
On the final day, Sherlock and John said goodbye to Molly and Greg on the platform. Molly hugged everyone fiercely, made them promise to write to her "Especially you, Greg. You have a new job now and I want to hear all about it." Greg looked considerably less tired and ill than he did when John had first seen him in the infirmary room, but he still seemed in no mood to be working. Still, a job was a job and he had had it available for months now, as he had reasoned when his new bosses had visited him to offer him time off.
Once they're done and John paid ('No, I insist, Sherlock. I didn't pay for the ballet, I can pay for this), they walk to the station together, barely a centimetre of space between them.
“Please, I know you wouldn’t have signed up if it weren’t for Mr I-must-correct-everything-and-everyone.” Harry snickers, earning herself John’s glare.
The man eventually leaves his seat to go to the loo (proof that he is somewhat human and not some ethereal creature who runs on espresso and goes without normal bodily functions) and John lets his curiosity get the better of him. He makes his way over under the pretence of a refill and looks inside the notebook, left open on a page full of scribbled writing.
"Ah yes. Well, we can stay here drinking. Or we can go up and dance, but you almost definitely lack any kind of coordination - "
“No one’s asking you to take care of her,” John explains calmly. “That’s mine and Mary’s job. But you’re my best friend, Sherlock. If the worst case scenario happens, heaven forbid, then yes, I trust you to take care of her. But not yet. For now, I just - “ he takes a breath - “I want to know you’ll be in my baby’s life, as much as you are in mine.”
"You've always been in love with him, yet you never did anything about it." The Milverssen-Irene tutted. "You just got back together with the first girl to fling herself at you, swept along with the current. You don't actually love her." It was not a question.
But Sherlock must have paused. He must have stopped to breathe long enough. Or maybe it was Mycroft, whose eighteen years of sitting eating cauldron cakes was catching up with him and causing his exhaustion. Whatever it was, the two brothers were overpowered, and they found themselves forced onto their knees with their hands bound behind their back, their wands cast to the side on the floor. Moriarty came and knelt in front of Mycroft, his head tilted patronisingly.
The two of them entered the ravenclaw common room: circular and large with a dark ceiling made to look like the clear, starry sky on a Summer's evening, and midnight-blue carpets on the floor. They then walked up the small staircase on the left to the boys' dormitory. Sherlock almost immediately rushed to his bed - the one with his violin case lying on top of it - and collapsed face down on it. John couldn't help but smile slightly. "If I had known that all it takes for you to want to sleep is a bit of alcohol, I would have given you some ages ago."
He finally approached the bartender. “I’m looking for a friend. Sherlock Holmes. Curly dark hair, blue eyes, cheekbones, eyeliner. You seen him?”
The lights went down and thunder cracked. The orchestra began to play with tense, tremolo violins while the witches chanted, huddled together in grey cloaks around a cauldron. John ignored what was going on onstage as he looked around at the audience, but everyone seemed rooted to their seats, transfixed on the play.
“Yeah. Though it’s very difficult to carry on as normal while watching the world collapse around you. I can’t believe they’re not cancelling exams.”
“Well, no. It’s a very good part. You should be flattered that the hat we picked your name out of thought you were suitable for the role.”
Your questions aren't overwhelming in the slightest. No, I don't have a girlfriend or boyfriend and I've never had one. Nor do I need one, so I don't require your pity. I'm surprised you didn't already guess this, as I've already made my general social life, or lack thereof, quite clear.
“This isn’t necessary,” John protests, but it’s weak and barely above a whisper. Sherlock tries not to think about the precarious position he’s in, kneeling between John’s legs, gaze pointedly directed at the wound just above John’s knee.
John and Sherlock leant back against the wall, breathless and laughing and full of adrenaline after running from Angelo’s through London to chase after a cab that had turned out to be the wrong one, the passenger being a confused American tourist as opposed to a cunning serial killer.
“With any... certain features. Physically speaking.” His cheeks turn entertainingly pink. If this is all it takes to get Sherlock to blush, he’d have to discuss this sort of thing more often.
"I will do." Again, Sherlock's lungs filled with panic at Moriarty's confidence. "With a little time, a little money, a few allies," Sherlock glanced at the two students pointing their wands at Sherlock, "I will claim my crown."
"No. But now she can't leave Moriarty. She can't do any less than what he expects of her. The unbreakable vow leaves no room for regret."
“Lazy git,” John chuckles, not minding in the slightest. “Well, Sherlock Holmes, you’re about to be my last customer of the day. I’m locking up once I’m done clearing up. Shame, really. I was hoping I was going to be done for the day sooner.”
"I've heard you help people with things. Solve puzzles. You helped my sister two years ago," she said, "her stuff was stolen - "
“You’ll have security with you, thanks to my brother’s involvement. Well I say that, but MI6 will be there anyway regardless of your presence or not. And I will be there too.”
"No. In case she gets mad or something, I don't know. Come on, Sherlock. You can be my... Wingman." Both John and Sherlock cringed.
TW: Character death. I don't know if this person counts as a major or minor character but...it sure is a death.
“Nice.” This system of Sherlock getting a new dead body part every few weeks or so from the morgue (as a favour from the woman who works there for getting her off a murder charge) for experiments had continued for so long that John was no longer phased by it. As long as Sherlock cleaned up and decontaminated after himself and didn’t place decomposing body parts near food. “So no cases then?”
Though Sherlock was not entering the tournament, during the wait his nerves were on edge. He didn't let it show, of course; he had a reputation as 'heart-of-stone-sociopath' to protect. But he mentally ticked off the days, knowing that John was probably doing the same.
Something in John’s brain clicks into place, as he looks up from the photos at Mary with cold suspicion settled deep in his stomach. Sherlock must be having the same dreaded realisation, because he asks, his voice betraying only a slight waver, “how do you know all this, Mary?”
"Morning, Mycroft." Lestrade smiled back, so disgustingly sweet Sherlock almost physically gagged. They had been dating since around May last year, and Sherlock could never decide whether it was an improvement or not. On the one hand, there was no more depressing pining from both parties, or side-long glances mirroring that of a damsel in distress in those overrated muggle cartoon films about princesses and a mouse named Michael. But now they were dating, there are more open displays of affection, like flirting (more than beforehand) and holding hands. Once, when Lestrade came to visit, he heard them in the night - doing... Stuff. He had never felt so regretful that his bedroom was right next to Mycroft's. Ugh.
They had barely left the hall when Sherlock realised with anxious regret how angry he had probably sounded at the mention of Mary's name.
John scoffs and reaches a hand up, tucking a damp curl behind Sherlock's ear. "Still, I'd rather not stand here for too long. You'll get a cold, and I don't want you ill while I'm here visiting. Is there a cafe we can warm ourselves up in?"
“I think we’re alright on the diseases front, you and I. The idea is that it shows you’re not carrying a knife in your hand. So I know I can trust you.”
"I have a few questions." Sherlock said. "The first is, for how long have you li- been in love with me?" The words sounded foreign in Sherlock's mouth.
"Really? Because there's this boy from my school who came here and I think he will be perfect for you."
They sit on the sofa together at a suitable distance apart, close enough to ground them both, so that Sherlock's temper and shaking calms, and John is reassured of his presence; it is still incomprehensible to him that Sherlock would have been dead by now had the plane not turned around, and even if he didn't take those drugs, the exile would have killed him in a matter of months. He still feels the bitter nausea that came about when Sherlock explained his decision to overdose, his guard and walls crashing down with him hours after the plane landed. He’s lost him twice now - once on the rooftop, the second time on the surgery table; a third might just kill him.
"The fact that he keeps glancing over at you says that things aren't going well with his soulmate and he is very obviously attracted to you."
After a few minutes of Sherlock sitting in silence by John's bed, relishing in every pulse beat he could feel on John's wrist and tracing illegible patterns on the back of his hand, Molly and Greg entered the hospital wing. Sherlock didn't look up, but he heard Molly's gentle gasp of sadness when she saw John, and Greg's muttered profanity.
"It's not like Gryffindor common room is right next door, is it?" John snapped, before cringing regretfully. "Sorry. Sit up?"
“Yes. If she’s not gone into hiding, she’s probably done something really, really stupid and gone into more danger than before.” A lump forms in his throat. “Do you think - if I hadn’t said what I said last night - “
From upstairs in the guest bedroom, he hears the front door shut and assumes that Sherlock let himself out to work on his case without the interference of a marriage on the verge of a breakdown. He doesn't hear the front door shut again in the early hours of the morning.
Sherlock shakes his head, pulling a face. “I probably wouldn’t like it. Baths are for cleanliness. It seems counterproductive to initiate that sort of thing in there.”
"Hello everyone," the woman went to shake hands with everyone, "I'm Kiara Singh. I'm a journalist for the Daily Prophet and I'm here to interview you all."
"You can read John," a deep voice said behind the book, "Look at the spine and see what you can deduce from the letters."
I hope you're having a good time in France and you're not getting too bored. I'm having a pretty good time here in Scotland, myself. The weather is way too cold here, I've eaten far too many Mars Bars and drank too much Irn Bru and my parents haven't spoken to me except to ask me to pass them the salt, but it's still pretty good. We've been going swimming in the outdoor swimming pool which, surprisingly, isn't too cold once you're in. I'm yet to die of hypothermia so let's see how that goes.
John smiles, then catches himself and clears his throat. “Well, I suppose you have things to do. People to kill. Scythes to swing.”
“Excuse me. I’ll be going back to my lunch now.” The doctor strides out of the room before anyone can protest, and gives Sherlock a meaningful stare as he passes that tells him to follow him. The king of the underworld obeys.
“Of the three of you out on walks,” Sherlock nods. “Different days, different places. All of the Watsons. This, combined with the case I had today - ”
“...I wasn’t trying to, but I’ll keep that in mind for another time. Seriously, Sherlock, I know this is poor timing, but it doesn’t make it any less true.”
He realised that no one had spoken in several seconds after Sherlock had entered the room, so he gave a small smile, "Hey. How do you know Gryffindor's password?"
Once they're done, Sherlock lingers at the threshold of John's room, looking towards the living room, but swaying on the balls of his feet. "So. I'll see you in the morning, then." He whispers, barely audible.
He was sent home later that week, to a bedsit he could barely afford on his army pension, to a therapist who did not help, and to sleepless nights spent staving off the inevitable nightmares of explosions and bullets and anarchy.
But the thing is, Redbeard had to eat while he was away. He was clever enough to know to look for food, but not clever enough to know what was food and what was dangerous to eat, namely a dead battery, most likely. And it's because of that I'm here. At the vets. Waiting for the vet to come out and tell us what's going to happen to him.
"Stop it!" Both Greg and John fell into silence. Molly glared at the two boys. "I'll propose a deal, okay? Sherlock comes back tomorrow." Molly glanced at John, whose face remained unreadable. "He should hear it from him."
“...Yeah, Alright," John said, then bowed his head so his lips met Sherlock's again, who then pulled him even closer as he wrapped his arm around his neck, humming in approval. John's fingers were weaved through Sherlock's hair, his tongue pressing tentatively against the seam of Sherlock's lips. It was then that the kisses deepened, grew more heated, as Sherlock climbed onto the chair too, knees planted either side of John's thighs. John sighed as he reacquainted himself with Sherlock's mouth, those cupid-bow lips pressed against his own, the deep, rumbling hums and sighs which had not changed, not in the slightest, since the last time -
When they arrive later - having flattened down their hair ruffled by the other's hands, smoothed down the creases in their clothes caused by the risen up shirts and being pressed against the sofa -  many have already arrived. They are mostly stood in groups or pairs, either simply talking or awkwardly bobbing their heads in time with the music, not yet confident or drunk enough to actually start dancing. In one corner there is Mr and Mrs Watson, talking to another couple with Mr Watson's hand protectively placed on his partner's lower back. In the other corner are John's friends with their soulmates, chatting and laughing together. John looks over at Sherlock questioningly, and he nods reassuringly.
The doors burst open. John turns around, as do the other cast members, and in storms Sherlock, his curls wild and windswept, his coat flowing behind him, and his a deadpan expression covering his face. “Sorry I’m late. I didn’t want to be here.”
Sherlock took the tie hanging around John's neck and started to tie it, while saying instructions as he did it. John probably should have taken notice - for future reference - but currently, his mind could only focus on how close they were standing and the baritone tones of Sherlock's voice. Then when Sherlock's finger's skimmed the base of John's neck, very lightly, he flinched.
"Good afternoon, class. Welcome to sixth year potions. Today we will be making a potion called Amortentia..."
He entered his mind palace immediately, to the room where short-term memories were stored. It was the potions room, without the benches and shelves of bottles and vials replaced with drawers and files. In the middle of the room was John, lying on a stretcher covered in blood. Sherlock choked down a whimper as he approached the body. It was just like how he remembered it, merely a few minutes ago. He felt John's pulse point  on his wrist and again, it was weak and fast.
