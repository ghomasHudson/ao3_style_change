Sherlock popped from the box as casually as if he was simply coming home from the market. He immediately hopped into his chair, somehow managing to make his long body fit so that he was curled into a ball on the cushion.
"After about five years we noticed that I still looked twenty. Or, I guess we didn't, my mum did. You'd like her, she's a great woman. We know someone else who became immortal after a run in with the time vortex, it wasn't too unheard of. That was sixty years ago. I've hardly aged three years since."
"When he was six he decided he wanted to be a pirate. He spent an entire summer studying to be one, refusing to set foot on land. Seriously, three months."
It was so dark in his flat. He couldn't even remember the last time he had left his desk. This case was just so difficult, and the random thoughts in his head didn't help. He had to continuously remind himself what he was doing. Why was his focus so scattered? He was a genius, this shouldn't be so hard. Why were the lights out? He could not remember. He would have to speak to Mrs. Hudson about that.
"Coming from the man with almost no medical experience who named himself 'The Doctor'."
"Sherlock's in there?" John asked.
"He went towards people," Sherlock mused as they started up the trail. "He could have gone for help, or ducked into an empty building, but he wanted people to see him. It doesn't make sense."
"You always sound like you're yelling. I get my very own friend, and you don't get to bully him. Only I get to bully him."
"Fine," Sherlock said quickly, tossing his jacket onto the floor. With two long bounds of his legs he crossed the room and hugged John tightly, taking the older man completely by surprise.
"No," he said quickly, "nothing like me. They're fast, and they're deadly."
"Sweetheart, I can't hear you very well, is there something wrong?"
"Yes, yes, Amy, I understand that they're purple, but what shade of purple? Yes it matters. They have to match the blue ones," a voice said from the other side. The man walked around the consul, then suddenly caught sight of Sherlock. He froze, the phone still gripped in his hand.
"What?" he asked a bit defensively.
"A pirate detective?"
“There not demons, Cas,” Sam said pointing towards the flask still in the Doctor’s hand. “The Holy Water didn’t even phase them.”
Sherlock wracked his brain, trying to figure out what she was talking about. "I remember this. When I was eight I was kidnapped. It was just for an hour or two, nothing terribly drastic. Father had me back in the TARDIS before supper."
"I see," he nodded. "Tell me, while they were here, did they happen to discuss...home life? Vacations, perhaps?"
"Well, General is the name given to people who lead others into battle and wear uniforms, but if you put on a costume and rounded up a posse we still wouldn't call you General Sherlock, would we?" The Doctor asked a bit snidely.
"Forever," Mycroft said in a deep voice. "You're trapped."
John took a breath, staring him down. He walked past him grabbing his coat. "If you don't want to tell me the truth, fine. I'll be at the bar."
The Doctor grinned. "I didn't even realize they were dating. I mean, I knew he cared about John, but I thought it was just…companionship. You can love someone without being in love with them. I suppose it makes sense though, eh? I mean they already live together, I should have assumed—"
"You were taken by a Dalek, Sherlock. It's okay to be afraid when you're in danger. I was afraid, Dad was afraid, even Mycroft was afraid."
Sherlock hopped into the bench, clicking on the seatbelt he always wore when the ship was in the vortex. "I don't like new people."
"No, I don't."
John was about to say something when he heard it. Somewhere within the house, up the stairs, someone was calling for help. He looked at Sherlock and the detective nodded, dashing up towards the stairs.
"We don't need to fight, John. I understand. My debit card is on the table. Use it for your hotel, please."
"I know you did it," Sherlock called. "Just come tell Mum you ate her pie and we won't turn you into the police."
Sherlock snorted.
She shut the door behind them, leaving the two of them alone together. Sherlock looked back at him, hands in the air. "What's happening?"
"Ah, ah!" The Doctor said, covering his ears. "I try not to peek ahead at the boys' futures. We are trying to let them live their lives as linearly as possible. No spoilers. Don't tell me who you are, and don't tell him. All I know is that you're on my trustable list, it doesn't bother me if you're Sherlock's landlord, or plumber, or boyfriend."
The Doctor bit his lip a moment, trying to keep them walking. "Good job Sherlock, very good. I made the path. I've…been here before. Once or twice. A few times."
"Don't 'mother' me," she said decisively. "You chose to delay my meeting John Watson for far too long. Any and all embarrassing childhood stories are entirely allowed. If you had invited him to eat with us and Mycroft the last time I told you to, I could have split the embarrassment between two sons."
John sat in the chair next to the bed, pulling his work bag onto his lap. "Ah, he knows I'll be back the next day." He assured her.
When it is over, the Doctor will offer to wipe it from his mind. He will decline.
"Can I go to Uncle Jack?"
Sherlock grinned. He was about to say something when there a knock at the door. The boy gasped and dived underneath the kitchen table, hiding himself expertly. John felt a twinge of empathy—how often had this boy needed to hide to know how to do it so well? It was just as well, he didn't know how he would explain it to whoever was at the door.
Thanks,
"I'm the adult right now. The adults are talking about a very serious matter."
"Do you care?" Sherlock asked, a little quieter. "I understand if you were playing nice for my parents. You can still choose not to know this. Uncle Jack has developed excellent Retcon pills, we could erase this Sunday for you."
Sherlock stood on shaky legs, walking slowly to the door. "I don't know how to do this. John, is it locked?"
The Doctor turned back to Castiel as he lifted Sherlock up into his arms. “Wait, you said recent deaths. What deaths?”
"Bloody…bloody Anderson. Can't…work with him John…"
"Have you ever known me to date?" Sherlock asked, and John could hear the smirk in his voice.
"Oh, come on," the Doctor smiled, waving an extra pole at her.
"That's it?" he asked innocently.
"I could help now."
The client frowned. "But he knew all those things about the body, how to find the killer, even what the man did for a living. You mean… you're not with the police?"
"Of course," the Doctor nodded, pulling a banana from the basket of fruit at the center of the table.
"Go ahead, say it" he heard Sherlock call from inside. "Everyone says it."
Sherlock swung down and into the TARDIS, smirking a little. "Okay, then, you've seen the Earth. Now, where do you want to go? Anywhere in the universe, any year that was or will be. What do you want to see?"
John sighed, rubbing the back of his own neck in sympathy. "It looks like someone grabbed his neck and twisted it all the way around," he admitted. "Look close enough and you can even see finger holds."
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean muttered, jumping slightly. “Where’ve you been?”
John looked to his friend. "Where would you go? What's your favorite place?"
He frowned. Why would he wonder who he was? He was Sherlock Holmes, the consulting detective. Life had always been like this. Moriarty was to blame, that was it. He had to solve this case or he could not be with John, or Molly, or Lestrade. That's why he had to jump off the roof. He had to jump into nothing. Then why was he still alive? Why did he remember watching John at his grave? Why were the lights out in here? He would have to speak to Mrs. Hudson about that.
Sherlock stopped, and for just a second John saw something like regret cross his features. "It's gone, John. Gallifrey was destroyed in a war, long before even Mycroft was born. The Doctor, he's the last full Time Lord. Mycroft and I are only hybrids, but we're the only two in the universe, ever."
"Sure," Sherlock said, going to fuss with his beakers at the kitchen table.
"And how do you know that?"
"That's not what I'm talking about and you know it. We need to talk about John."
"Of course you weren't," My croft said, uncharacteristically soft as he headed toward the door. "Nice to see you, little brother, but it would be best if I am not here when Father returns to collect you. Timelines and all, you know. Very tricky subject. John, please tell the adult Sherlock to call me when he gets home. He may actually do it if he remembers this conversation."
"Shouldn't pirates camp on the beach?" Sherlock asked, huffing under the weight of his small sleeping bag. Redbeard carried Sherlock other small bag around his neck, and looked ridiculously proud of that fact. It freed his master up to ask his normal barrage of questions.
"Oh, uh, yeah of course—"
John walked back in slowly towards Sherlock, touching one of the tall columns of coral. "It's…the inside doesn't match the outside."
"Oh," the Doctor said with a face that made it clear he did not understand. It melted into one of surprise and then excitement all in less than ten seconds. "Oh! Really? Are you sure?"
"TARDIS, Mycroft."
"Sorry," John shrugged, getting comfortable, "I don't do it too often. Since when do you need an alarm clock, anyway? I've seen you space out for days on end before."
"Are there more?" John asked, running a hand through his hair. "The Angels I mean, are there more of them here?"
"He's just excited," Sherlock said, trotting over to his seat and buckling himself in. "We're going to bury treasure."
"John! I've got that one, look behind me!"
Sherlock stared at him a moment, suddenly realizing what they were fighting about. "It doesn't matter, John. I'm not hiding anything that would affect your life in any way."
It was a small fish, a little wriggling blue things that had wide eyes on the side of its head, but Sherlock was ecstatic. "He's like Nemo!" he exclaimed, holding it up.
"What time is it?"
"But your brother can't," the Doctor said, laying a hand on Mycroft's shoulder. "He's too young, and I wouldn't send him somewhere on his own. I trust you to help look after him."
"Four or five hundred," he admitted, watching as the light illuminating her face turned to a sweet blue. "I used to come here when I was lonely—after I lost someone or didn't trust myself to be around humans. Haven't been here with this face yet of course," he smiled.
"Like I said, John, I know my son. He doesn't have friends. He just has you," she said, hopping down from the counter. "Come on. That should be long enough."
"Really, Rose? I thought the name Mycroft was bad. You're setting these boys up to be drama queens, you know that?"
"Well," John stuttered a bit, "you like sugar in your tea. More than you should really."
"Sherlock—"
John Watson had just walked back into the flat after work when he heard the sound of the TARDIS echoing through the rooms. He pulled off his jacket quickly, calling out for Sherlock. No one answered, and he remembered the detective saying something Lestrade calling for assistance before he went to work. The case had seemed too trivial this morning, but he had a sneaking suspicion that the severe lack of anything to do the last week had pushed Sherlock onto a relatively boring case.
"He's covered in sweat. Of course, he was a badly paid street dweller, but look at the state of his palms and knees. He fell in that mud, but didn't bother to wipe off the mud from his hands. He must have been in a hurry, and since we know he has just been murdered we can assume he was running from someone. Someone with very clean hands."
“They’re not human, they can’t be,” Dean argued. “She just admitted she’s over fifty. Does she look fifty to you?”
Every time, every single time Mrs. Hudson promised herself that she would not clean the boys' flat, she would find herself at it again. She didn't know why she bothered sometimes—Sherlock would just leave his little experiments all over the place and clutter it up in a few days. She supposed it was more for John's sake; if he was going to help all of London by keeping Sherlock complacent and happy, she could help him avoid living in squalor.
There was a long pause, and finally Watson leaned back and looked at the book. "Okay. The Adventure of The Empty House, there's a good one…"
"I don't understand."
Sherlock stared at her. "Fine. Yes. I love him. It doesn't matter."
"Not with the Doctor's equipment. We can keep you alive without a single drop of heroin ever touching your system again. The withdrawal…it's going to hurt. Oh, God, Sherlock it's going to hurt. And I'm so sorry."
"Show me, Boy," Sherlock told him, hopping to his feet.
"What pie?"
She gasped, jumping out of her calm state. She yawned, rubbing at her face. "What?"
"Your notebook," Sherlock said suddenly, "John, do you still carry that notebook you were using to write down my observations?"
"How are we today, Mr. Holmes?" John asked, patting him on the shoulder.
He stared at her. "How did you miss Christmas?"
"Come on, Mikey," The Doctor said gently, tapping the distracted infants leg to get his attention. The Doctor lay across the living room floor, his striped suit wrinkled horribly. He had his head propped up on his hand as he tried to make his young son look at him. "Mikey, hey. Mycroft, look at me."
"The water is pulling it harder."
"Here it is!" the boy cried, holding up a little framed picture on the dresser. John looked at it in surprise, he had never even noticed the little photograph before. It was a modest portrait of Rose, the Doctor, and another, older woman that looked a lot like Rose. In the older woman's arms lay a small baby with black curls, and over the Doctor's shoulder he was holding a young boy, about the age little Sherlock was now.
"Why am I even revisiting this?" Sherlock asked himself, looking around the room. "Seems a bit random."
John's frustration went out of his voice. "I don't… I doubt we'll be able to really talk about anything while you're like this. If you're going to sleep, I'm going out. We're out of milk anyway. See you tomorrow morning?"
John obeyed, turning to face Sherlock. He gasped, pointing over the detective's shoulder. "Sherlock—it's the angel statue from downstairs! It's right behind you!"
Her eyes closed slowly in the dim light, and for just a second she drifted away.
"A bully," he mumbled, pulling his knees up to his chest the way he'd done when he first got there. John smiled a bit realizing it was a defense mechanism. The boy liked to make himself as small as possible. No wonder the adult Sherlock curled up on the couch when he was sulking.
He took one tentatively, glancing back towards the stairs. "Shouldn't we be heading back up?"
"Well," the Doctor said in long, drawn out voice, "that's not exactly what I said. But, you know, by and large, time travel is a pretty peaceful venture."
Jackie stared at the dark tufts of hair on the infant.
"No, I don't think so," she spat at him. "If you're about to try to explain to me why I had to find my son in an abandoned house with a needle in his arm, you talk to me as your mother."
"How is Grandmother doing?" Sherlock cut in quickly.
"Well, it looks like you've found a companion of your own," the Doctor smiled. "John seems nice. Perhaps he can take care of your checkups from now on?"
"Well, you know…time. Say the wrong thing, and the German's win World War Two."
"I didn't think…It wasn't necessary."
John smiled, watching the little blue box materialize in front of him. It had been only a week since he'd first met Rose and the Doctor, but he was glad to see that they were safe. He found himself worrying about the couple since that first day—their chosen lot in life was dangerous work. He wondered how Sherlock could cope, never knowing if his parents were in a life or death situation. Actually, being Sherlock probably helped.
"It's not that. He might be interested in men, I don't know for sure. I just mean he's not interested in…me."
Redbeard trotted over to older boy and started licking at his face. Mycroft was cocooned tightly in the blanket, and he started trying to wiggle away from the dog but couldn't get free. "Sherlock, call him off!"
Sherlock knew exactly where to look - a missing pie could only be one place. Mycroft, already sixteen, had been spending more and more of his time in his locked room. Sherlock tiptoed up to the door and laid down gently, peering under the crack.
"The man had this business card with him, and he looks like he was headed home from work. I need the two of you to get down there and see if he had only just left for the day. It could be invaluable in establishing a timeline and finding his killer."
He stepped forward.
"It doesn't matter," Mycroft spat, "I won't be here for long."
"I'm not a child anymore."
His expression dripped in feigned condescension. "Sure, fine, I'll call more often. Terribly sorry to ignore you, I'll do better this year."
"I picked it on a whim and you refused to let me change it."
"You have to stop bothering your brother. It's okay to be with him during our family time, but he doesn't want to play as much anymore. Mike's getting older, he has his mind on other things."
"I'm being a detective."
"I know that. I trust you. I've never given you any reason to believe I didn't. Why is all of this coming out all of a sudden?"
"Not for long, I promise," the Doctor said, searching frantically through the list.
The client shifted uncomfortably. "It's just that—you said he must have ducked into the Savings and Loan to get out of the rain. There hasn't been any proper rain, not for weeks. It's a bit humid, but nothing serious—"
"This is silly," Mycroft grumbled audibly when Rose and Sherlock came into the TARIS. He was laying on the floor of the consul room with a blanket wrapped around himself, pretending to be asleep. The Doctor stepped over him easily, setting up the TARDIS for the trip.
"Not this time, Sherlock," the Doctor called from the front of the line. "No maps of this place exist. Totally uninhabited, wildlife only."
The other man tapped his fingers. "Well, then, I need to be certain you understand the gravity of the trust placed on you. There are organizations that would kill to get ahold of my parents and their ship. Since members of my family have decided to bring you into this confidence you need to be aware that the eyes watching you are going to be twice as vigilant as before. If you were to betray that confidence—"
He liked to assume he was talking to him, but in all reality it was unlikely that he even knew someone was there with him. He assumed he must have known another John before he overdosed. Whatever the case, John always tried to answer him as though he could hear. "Yes, Mr. Holmes."
John smiled. It was an easy deduction, really, but not one he himself would have realized. "Amazing, as usual."
"The wall had it coming," he assured him, waving him off. "John, this really doesn't bother you.
"Ours. I've been planning it all night. I've bought everything and loaded it into the TARDIS. Tents, coolers, marshmallows, fish, everything we need."
He turned back to the Doctor and Rose, but they were smiling cheekily at his panic. John ran a hand through his hair, shaking his head. "I think I've finally gone mad."
"Police box," John continued, "is larger on the inside than it is in the outside. That's impossible."
"I know I didn't tell you, sorry," John said flatly.
"No, a regular one. There's a hole in the tile but I can't figure out why and it's boring."
He grumbled a bit, rubbing his arm where she'd hit it. "I want to keep him in my life, okay? If I ever tried to be more than his friend and he decided to leave…I couldn't handle it." Rose noticed with a shudder how his hand came to rest on the inside of his arm where his old scars were hidden under his jacket.
"What you are? If he's been living here he knows everything important. You're brilliant, you're unique, and you come from an interesting family."
"But it's not cheating to ask me?"
He jumped. It must have been a trick of the light before. The room wasn't entirely empty it turned out. In the far corner, between the two doors, someone had left a bit of art in the run down house. He supposed the cement walls had made it blend in before. There was no other explanation as for how he would miss an entire statue.
She closed the door quietly behind her, poking her head in to check on Mycroft for just a moment before she slipped into her own bedroom and settled into the covers of her inviting bed. She heard quiet footsteps down the hall and smiled, recognizing them instantly. Those were not little boy footsteps.
"You love him," she said simply, daring him to disagree.
"You never pretend for anyone, Sherlock. You never exactly how much sugar to put in someone's coffee, you don't reassure them when they're worried about you, you don't pull them into your life and drag them on cases and apologize when you've argued. I know my children, and I know when they're hurting."
They shook hands for a moment, and then he closed the TARDIS doors and began to disappear.
"Sherlock," John started, gripping on of the rails slowly and leaning against it. "Where are we?"
"How am I breathing?" John asked, suddenly concerned.
"Well, where is he?" Mycroft asked.
"Why not?"
"Just let me say this—"
"Doyle," the man said, still staring at the pair with a glint in his eyes "Arthur Conan Doyle."
"You've been here before then?" John asked.
The boy helped his father reach into the bag and they started pulling out blankets, picnic baskets, chairs, and lanterns.
"Not that I know of."
"You do realize there is no Thompson's Savings and Loan on that street," the Doctor whispered to Rose, a few streets away from the crime scene. "There never has been."
"No," John said, patting him once on the shoulder. "You want to order in?"
"We…we're on a case. What were we just doing? Just now, where were we?"
"Can they…can they see us?" he asked.
She sighed. "You know, for a genius, you can be really thick sometimes."
"You've been awake for four days now, Sherlock. It's definitely a sleeping night. Mycroft is asleep in his room, it's your turn now."
"No! Don't tell me, I want to figure it out. Can I use the Sonic Screwdriver to take a reading of it?"
"Hey, I know how the TARDIS works," the Doctor said, a bit higher pitched than necessary. "I've been piloting it since long before you were born."
They sat in silence nibbling on their dinner for a bit. Sherlock was the first to notice when it started, and he told them in a very matter of fact way.
Jackie rolled her eyes as the Doctor came bouncing in, holding a giggling Mycroft upside down in one arm and a camera in the other.
"What are you talking about, Sherlock? We woke up, had breakfast, I read the paper and you experimented with chemicals. It's just a normal day."
"Of course I know Sherlock, I'm his—"
"None," John smiled. "Thought I'd stay in. I suppose, if you're hungry, we could go get a bite later on. You should eat something, God knows when you last had a decent meal."
"Can we just stay here and," he grimaced, "visit? If we absolutely must get through a few hours, that is."
There had been many things about life with Sherlock Holmes that John did not believe at first. When he met Sherlock on that very first day, he did not want to believe that a man could deduce everything about him with a glance. Later, he had a lot of trouble believing that any one man could be so annoying while simultaneously being an amazing human being. However he absolutely could not believe this. There was no way in hell this young couple in front of him had been in love with each other for more than a week.
The calm room he was in melted around him, turning into another room entirely. Not a real room—this was just another part of his palace, a little memory tucked away. He blinked in surprise, this wasn't a memory he visited often.
The boy bit his lip, his curiosity overriding his obedience easily. He could still hear his mother talking to his father in the distance, so technically he wasn't in trouble. Besides, somebody might be in trouble. Dad wouldn't let him get grounded if he saved someone.
"What camping trip? Why do you keep saying that?"
"I'm still not sure how you knew that," John scoffed, leaning back in his chair.
"Lying? I'm not."
The Doctor shook the mud off the pole and set it in Sherlock's hands. "Do you know what fishing is, Sherlock?"
Sherlock was quiet for a moment. "Okay."
"You're all grown up, perfectly okay with me having a new face."
"Probably not. How about you go ask Dad?"
Rose came in behind him, practically beaming. "I'm so proud of you, Sherlock. This was very brave."
"Much later," the Doctor smiled, watching the boy's awkward legs trying to keep up with his dog. His mobile rang.
"No," she said, shaking her head. "Not this time."
When the TARDIS was finally in the living room the door popped open and the Doctor stuck his head out. He smiled at John. "Hello there!"
"The detox has already been accelerated by the Doctor's machines. You should still be unconscious, but everything is in fast forward. That doesn't mean the withdrawal will be much faster, but you'll move through steps quicker. I can't…I can't be here when that happens."
John was going to protest but the Doctor shut the door behind them, and suddenly it was just him and Rose in the hallway. Rose held a finger to her lips, gesturing for him to follow her down the stairs. "The Doctor's just going to have a quick word with his son while we get the tea ready," she whispered.
"It's only morning for you," he reminded her as he jogged backwards out of the room. "The boys and I have been making plans all night."
It started a very normal day at Baker Street—or so John Watson thought. It was Sunday, finally, and he allowed himself the rare privilege to sleep in. A bit of rest was long overdue; he had been running back and forth between his job at the clinic and his cases with Sherlock for a solid month now. On average he managed about five hours a night, but those missed hours built up on him quickly nowadays. It wasn't like he minded much. When there was an interesting case to solve he enjoyed the late nights, as long as Sherlock was talkative. Their last case had been wrapped up only days before; it had been a trying ordeal having to do with an elephant ending up somewhere…unexpected. Sherlock was on his usual 'just proved my own brilliance' high, but they never lasted long. As he lay there Sunday morning he kept expecting the detective to knock on his door (or more accurately burst in unannounced) and drag him away to find something new to investigate.
"Terribly sorry, we're ill today. Perhaps you could come back tomorrow—"
"Would you like to?"
"Doctor, why does Miss Pond say you told her not to call me? We have things to do before next week." Rose grumbled as soon as he answered.
He eyed the man suspiciously. "You…you want to know? Really?"
"It's a time machine, Dear," she reminded him, "tomorrow is not the boss of us."
"Aww…" Rose sighed. "How old?"
Castiel frowned, letting him shake his hand. “Time Lords aren’t supposed to exist either, at least not anymore.” His eyes darted over to the rest of the small family. “I believe your child is… in distress.”
"Sherlock—" John started, but he was cut off.
"Oh, good, you know who I am. That'll save us some time."
He either didn't hear her or didn't care. He was already across the room, helping the man into a chair. "Do you know who committed the murder?" Sherlock asked animatedly, "Because if you do then you can just go find a constable. It's boring if you already know who did it."
"No! Wait, don't turn your head. I'll get it."
"Please!" a voice broke through the silent barrier around his palace so suddenly that it shook the imaginary walls, fading in and out. "Please, Sherlock….don't think that…why…Sherlock!"
Mycroft tried to protest but the Doctor just held his hand up. "I'll take care of it, Mike. How's the research on the TARDIS manual going?"
"Why?" John asked.
She almost dropped her cookie. "January? We missed Christmas again?"
"Think!" John yelled out a bit too loudly, wincing when he realized the Doctor and Rose could probably hear him. He lowered his voice, but that wavering dangerousness cut into his tone. "You're the best detective in the world, figure it out."
She shook her head, settling back down and pulling him close to her. She pointed up at the ceiling to the mess of stars over their heads. "You know that star, there? The one that's just a bit different?"
"Why didn't you tell me about this place?"
"Do you want him to be more than that?" she asked, narrowing her eyes.
"Mycroft is asexual, I know, he has no interest in any kind of physical relationship at all. There's nothing wrong with that. Unfortunately he also seems to be incredibly resistant to forming close ties to anyone other than his family. I worry about him sometimes, that he might be lonely or regret his decisions later, but we're not talking about your brother right now. We're talking about you, the little boy who decided to idolize his brother and act exactly like him."
Mycroft didn't answer. He stared straight ahead, trying to ignore the man. He had only been off the phone with his mother for a few minutes when someone had struck him from behind. How they had managed to get into his private office, he had no idea. What mattered was that he had awoken in an unfamiliar, dark place, handcuffed to a very thick pipe.
He seemed to think that over for a moment. "Why wouldn't they just sleep on the ship?"
When Rose was busy heating the oven, Sherlock slowly slipped out of the back door, Sonic Screwdriver in hand. The end of the device was coated in a yellow glob-part of the pie mix Rose had sitting on the counter. He knew he only had a few minutes to finish this mystery. For all he knew the Doctor was already looking for him.
"Well, plans," John shrugged noncommittally. "That…can indicate a date."
"What was it, then?"
"What?" John asked, genuine confusion on his face.
John didn't ask questions, he simply started walking away from the statue behind him, getting closer to his friend. John reached to his back pocket, but his head turned slightly and Sherlock yelled out a warning.
"But isn't everybody?" he asked. "Everybody gets old and dies. Even daddy gets older, just really slowly. When you're born, you start to die."
Rose was still smacking the second Angel in the face with the hammer, muttering. "Stupid, irresponsible, evil, sons of bit—"
"Okay," he said, frustrated that she was not budging on her seemingly obvious lie.
"Oh," John said again with a pause. "You…have a date then?"
"I've got one!" Sherlock said as he glanced conspiratorially down at the dog following closely at the family's heels. "Someday, in a distant scary world, Dad will wear a bowtie."
"Sher…Sherlock?" he asked.
"Sure," he nodded.
"Friend. I'm sure that's what the Doctor thinks too. He thinks of everyone in terms of their worth as a being, it's one of the things I love about him, but it blinds him sometimes. He loves his companions. He'd go to the end of the world for any of them, in fact that was our first date, but he doesn't see what I see."
John grinned, bounding the stairs two at a time. Sherlock was in a room to the right, and John could only just make out his back. He ran into the room, ready for anything. Anything except what was actually there.
"Won't be long," she murmured as he stroked her hair.
Say what you like about how careless the Doctor was about his own life—he was a very careful father to Mycroft and Sherlock. He'd lost children once before. In the horrible days of the Time War, his children and grandchildren had died, and there was nothing he could do but watch it happen. Now he had another chance; he had two boys just as intelligent and wonderful as his others. They would have loved their siblings.
"Do you want me to tell you anyway?"
It was about eight years since he had received the list, and it had come in handy a dozen times at least. Today was no exception. The Sontarans were on earth in the 3,765, and no one was safe. They had placed cars around the Earth—Atmos cars—and poison was pouring from the vehicles. There was still a chance to save everyone with minimal casualties, and he and Rose were grasping at that chance. They decided together at almost the same moment that this was not safe. If they failed for some reason, no one on Earth would survive.
"No," the Doctor said quickly, pushing Mycroft's shoulder. "We just see if any fish bite, and then if they don't we'll go back to camp."
Sherlock frowned angrily. "He can eat if he wants to, Mycroft."
They set up two large tents and unpacked a few bags. As soon as they were done Mycroft pulled out a book. "Can I go and read now?"
"Boooring," Sherlock moaned."
"Well, there you go, you're going to learn. Then there's the whole Mind-Palace thing. You store your memories in there so you can keep them all organized."
"How could you?" she whispered.
Sherlock smiled. He loved not remembering.
“Twelve people in the last four weeks have all been found dead within a ten mile radius of this place,” Sam answered. “The bodies were all…” he glanced at the children, “A little weird.”
He sighed, grabbing his head. It hurt. He was so tired. He just wanted to go to sleep. Why was this case so important?
"Um, TARDIS? What was that?"
"I'm afraid not, but don't worry. I'm from far in your future okay? When you go back to wherever you came from, I'll look normal again, okay?"
The little family was at a UNIT base when they made the decision. Rose told him to go, get the boys somewhere safe, and then come back as fast as possible. He promised he would, and then scooped up the eight year old Sherlock and grabbed his brother's arm, pulling him along into the TARDIS.
"What's going on, Sherlock?" John asked, wondering briefly if he should dash upstairs for his firearm.
The Doctor pretended he hadn't heard him, but Rose stopped walking. "Wait, Sherlock's right. Why's there a path without people?"
"What?"
After three weeks the Doctor returned to his TARDIS, and to his delight he found the list, penned by his future self, lying in the compartment. There were some names he recognized or course; Sarah Jane Smith, Jack Harkness, Jackie Tyler, The Brigadier, Barbara and Ian, and few other he knew would be capable and willing to help him in a pinch. Some names were of people he had met, but didn't necessarily trust yet. He wondered what great act former-Prime Minister Harriet Jones must have pulled to warrant her spot on the exclusive list.
"Me?" he scoffed. "Never. Hardly ever. I mean if you take the amount of moments I have lived collectively and compare the amount of times I have been up to something it would only be…definitely less than half the time. Why are we talking about this? Everyone follow Dad. Come on."
"My Sherlock gets admirers. Of course he does, have you seen him? But Sherlock…he has never been one to need socialization. He used to sit in his room for days if I'd let him, just reading away and exercising that mind of his. He had it in his head that he wanted to be as smart as his father, but that's just not realistic. Not with my lousy genes anyway. The point is, never once in all of his life has Sherlock lied about who he is."
"You have the same parents."
Their 'client', the man whom they had met in the pub, shook his head sadly. "Poor devil."
Holmes was flat lining.
"Are you a doctor?" the boy asked suddenly.
The Doctor sighed, running a hand over his face. "God, your mother is going to kill us both."
"I believe he was running north," Sherlock said. "Deep footprints—he wasn't tired yet. Perhaps if we start out north we might find another track."
"I suppose I just don't think of it in those terms."
"It's noon on a Sunday, Sherlock. I've just woken up, I don't want a drink," he eyed the detective suspiciously. "You've never asked me to miss one of your meetings before. You once called me back from the clinic with a rubbish lie about a fire to get me home to make a meeting with a client. Why so secretive all of a sudden?"
Redbeard turned suddenly whining about something in the distance. Sherlock frowned. Redbeard was a good guard dog, especially for a rambunctious boy who tended to get into trouble, but he never whined. If there were something dangerous back there he'd growl or pull Sherlock back towards camp, but he was doing neither.
"Yes, Love?"
"Just, The Doctor," the man said. Sherlock mouthed the words along with him, then worked very hard to suppress an eye roll.
"Um," John said, trying to think quickly, "well, you know, we're friends. We visit each other a lot."
John wasn't sure what to do. "It's not a lie. Really. If anything, Sherlock, I think you're my best friend."
"Give me a sign. Anything," John said, still looking at the door.
"Because digging takes a long time, and they can't leave the treasure on the shore overnight or someone could come by and take it."
"He's talking again, Molly. He's pulling through. He not here yet, but he hears me. He can hear me, Molly. I won't let go. I'll be here, every day, until he comes back."
"Client?" John asked.
The teens face fell. "I don't understand hardly anything. I understand the dimensions we enter but-"
"Fix it?"
Dr. John H. Watson (especially for Sherlock)
Before the private room, Mr. Holmes had been staying in a room with another patient, a conscious one, but the mere presence of the man had appeared to agitate him. Anderson, that was the other patient's name, he's been staying in the hospital long-term for intense Chemotherapy treatments. He'd watch television far too late into the night, and it seemed to bother Mr. Holmes somewhere in his subconscious. He'd scrunch his face up in disgust and mutter something about drug busts.
"I made you a cake last year," he protested.
Rose sighed, not exactly sure what to say. She brushed the hair back from his forehead. Sherlock was smart. She realized with a sinking feeling that this was not something he had just thought of tonight. She had to do this carefully, he would detect any lies or condescension. "Sherlock, how old do you think Mummy is?"
"Like you?"
"Six."
"I'm older than I look," she assured him. "Do you want to know the other half, then? Do you know what really makes you stand out, Dr. John Watson?"
"Quit bickering, I mean it," Rose said, pointing that powerful little finger at them.
"What?" he asked.
"Let's just drop it, okay? Why don't you come help me in the TARDIS? We can go swimming later if we can find the pool."
The Doctor just nodded.
"I don't want to leave you alone. You need to get some rest."
"Well, it's just something he'll have to get used to," his grandmother said, "now that we've got to pay some attention to…what was the name again?"
"Go away, Sherlock," Mycroft sighed. "We can talk later, I have schoolwork."
"Sorry," John said, holding up a finger. "I don't know that word."
"Sherlock?" he heard his father call out the back door.
"Cheese!" the Doctor called, snapping the photo.
Rose scoffed and crossed her arms, but finally sighed. "Fine, but you stay within earshot. If you can't hear me and Daddy, you stop right there and turn around. I want you to check back every ten minutes."
"Daddy? Why make him say that?"
"Mum!" he whined, following after her. "You can't!"
"As you probably know then, the TARDIS is a time machine. Things don't always happen to me in the right order. You've met me, I but I have not yet met you. Understand?"
“My name is Castiel. I am an angel of the Lord.”
She ushered the Doctor out of the door, grabbing Sherlock's jacket sleeve and pulling him close to her. "Talk to him. Right now."
"I don't appreciate this, Sherlock," John said through gritted teeth.
"It's not Sherlock," she told him, answering quickly. "Hello? Mycroft? Can you hear me?"
"Sort of," Rose said, opening the door wider for him. "There's a perception filter around the TARDIS. They don't want to notice us, so they don't. Do you want to try for the future again?"
"You still don't understand," she said softly. "Sherlock I've always tried to show you, but you just won't listen to me. When you hurt, when you're scared, you don't have to pretend. Don't hide, Sweetheart. You don't have to hide in here where the world can't see you. There will always be someone who loves you who will pull you out."
Breakbreakbreakbreakbreakbreakbreakbreakbreakbreakbreakbreakbreak
She sat up, squeezing Sherlock's arm. "Sherlock, you shouldn't think about things like that. You are not dying, Sweetheart."
John might have found that suspicious on another day, but his mind was a bit occupied. The Doctor led him to the pub, leaving Sherlock and Rose behind.
Sherlock sighed, turning his head from Rose. "Rose, I—"
He ran forward and took Sherlock's hand, pulling him into a brief embrace. He reciprocated, but not as warmly as he had with the woman. "Sorry about that. I was aiming for the sidewalk. You have admit, based on my track record that was a pretty close landing."
The Doctor said nothing, but he and Rose shared a look. He took the medical wipe and balled it up, tossing it into a waste basket they had placed a few feet away.
The Doctor shot him a look, handing back his jacket. "You need to take care of yourself."
"You two are literally his parents, so, Sherlock, you're half…alien."
"I love you," she said simply, kissing him once on the forehead. She turned on her heel, walking away from him.
"Good morning."
"Is he still in Cardiff with…um…Iago?"
"Don't," she said sternly. "You've been gone a week. How many times have you shot up this week, Sherlock?"
"How did you get a new face?"
"It hasn't rained," the man from the pub said.
"Seven AM, exactly," he said. "You asked that I never try to pull you out of bed before seven unless it's an emergency.
The Doctor frowned. He hadn't meant to be so specific, but if he would one day choose to specify that this man was particularly good at watching Sherlock then there must have been a good reason. He set in the space time coordinates underneath the name as Sherlock peeked at the list.
Please Sherlock. Answer the phone.
Sherlock approached John slowly, not looking at him. "I…I'm so sorry. This was my fault."
John nodded.
Rose was crying. The lights around him were still slow and sluggish to his eyes, but he saw his mother now with perfect clarity. She placed a hand on his face, over the cheek she had just slapped. It was a comforting gesture, but her face was not as soft. She was glaring at him.
Mycroft briefly turned his head towards his mother's voice, but then resumed his examination of the small multicolored blocks in front of him. More specifically, he was testing to see if different colored blocks tasted differently, but of course his parents had no way of knowing that.
"You alright?"
Rose just laughed at him, giving her son a taste of the sugary treat as the Doctor continued to grumble.
"Yeah, thanks," she muttered sarcastically. She stared at his camouflage pants and bright orange shirt. "What are you wearing?"
Rose sighed, making sure the boys were out of earshot, before she stopped the Doctor and laid her hands on either side of his face. She placed a quick peck on his lips, then pulled back. "Listen to me, Doctor. I'm talking about Sherlock's love life. Sherlock is in love with John."
Sherlock nodded, pushing his face into the pillows. He was quiet for a long minute, and Rose was hopeful that he had finally fallen asleep. He turned his face to her suddenly. "Mummy, I'm bored. I don't think it's a sleeping night."
Dean smirked. “Wow, Lady. You look good for five hundred.”
"So Mycroft," he asked, "that means he's an alien too."
She sighed. "You've stayed with your Uncle Jack long enough to know that most people aren't black and white. He doesn't have to be gay to love you, Sherlock."
"I doubt you would have succeeded at keeping anything from us," Sherlock conceded.
John followed Rose downstairs, still trying to wrap his mind around what they were telling him. It was impossible for this young couple to be Sherlock's parents, but they all seemed very committed to the fact. The way Rose had seen right through Sherlock's façade – it made him want to believe that they had to be related.
"I'm not," Sherlock said quickly. "I'm perfectly aware."
"Ianto," the Doctor corrected. "Yes. Still at the hub. Mycroft's been pulling some strings for them, getting the best equipment to keep the rift in check."
"It's the eighteen hundreds, John. I don't think Hitler will hear you."
"I did not steal a pie! Dad!" Mycroft called out the door.
"And you never did," she said simply, laying her hand against the side of his face. "I asked and asked but you never wanted to admit that you were upset. I could see it, the way you dropped your fork at dinner, the way you kept your room door open at night for four days, I saw it all. The night after you got home and you thought everyone was asleep, you looked into our room for five whole minutes just to make sure you weren't alone."
"Oh, God," Sherlock moaned, placing a hand over his face. "Small talk."
"Oh, I don't think that's a good idea," Sherlock started quickly, but Rose cut him off.
John stared at the boy for a second, and then the Doctor's words hit him. "I—Doctor wait! Where are you going?"
"No, that's okay. I like it the way it is," he said with a small huff, fidgeting in his blankets.
"No, don't" he said. "Not yet."
"Boring, isn't it?" Sherlock asked, leaning against the doorway next to him.
"What was the word you used earlier?" John asked. "Um, spoilers, right?"
She rubbed her eyes. "What's wrong, Love?" she turned and looked at the little boy laying in the bed next to her. She was resting back on the bedspread, but Sherlock was nestled under the blankets, his gravity-defying black curls bouncing slightly as he shook his head. He was in his pajamas, he had a glass of water, and he'd been up to use the bathroom four times already. They'd been there for hours.
"A new case, John? I haven't finished the last one," Sherlock said, trembling with his hand on the door. John just stared forward, looking at him. Sherlock took a deep breath. "Okay. For you. I'll do it."
"Relax, the wood was very thin," he promised, shoving the note deep into the wall. "Come on Mycroft…"
Finally he sat up, his little nose wrinkled high on his face. She smirked. This little boy was absolutely beautiful, and he would grow to be a beautiful young man. His chubby cheeks had already receded slightly, and his eyes seemed to not be able to decide whether they wanted to be green or blue. She sighed, pushing him back onto the bed gently. "One more question, Sherlock, then you have to sleep."
"Must be going!" Sherlock called, already walking briskly down the street.
"Now it's bedtime," Rose said, trailing after them with a smiling Mycroft and some lighted lanterns.
"Of course," she sighed, "but if he wants to be alone with John that badly then we'll give them a few minutes. I figure one stroll around the block will do it."
John stared at into Sherlock's room, the shook his head. "It's a box. What is this, a new experiment?"
Rose came in to living room, flopping on the bowl with the batch of cake mix. "You're right, too. Who need's baking?" she dipped her finger into the bowl and ate a blob of the chocolate.
"John," he said, a bit more hesitantly, "these are…my parents."
Rose turned and found that, in fact, the grass around them seemed to be tinted a deep rouge. She turned quickly to the Doctor, afraid they should run, but he was grinning madly.
Or course, that was back when he was talking.
They were all frozen, watching as the grass turned redder and redder, when suddenly she realized it wasn't the grass at all. It was some sort of light emanating from between the blades.
"Bigger on the inside," rose muttered.
Sherlock had not budged. His usually calm face had turned pale white, and he stared out among the trapped humans in the room. "You," he called suddenly to the one John was trying to help, "what brought you here? What keeps you here? What do they look like?"
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "Okay, that is a bit new actually."
The beeping machine next to him slowed, and then alarms went off.
There was an uncomfortable silence, then the Doctor clapped his hands. "Well, off to the 21st, eh?"
(See the end of the chapter for
The patient's eyes darted back and forth under his eyelids. There was a world in there, a place that no one except Mr. Holmes could go.
"Sounds a bit like you," John chuckled once, no humor in his voice. "They just look like statutes."
Sherlock blinked. "That seems a strange conclusion to jump to."
"Meet anyone interesting?" Rose asked. She took the Doctor's hand, leaning in to whisper to him. "You're right, you know, it is more fun when you have someone new on the TARDIS. You sort of take all of this for granted when it's just your life."
"I'm not an alien," Sherlock said with a roll of his eyes. "I was born on Earth. Not necessarily in the year my birth certificate says, but on Earth. Rose wanted us to have a home planet, and Gallifrey wasn't an option."
He paused, then smiled. "Okay. Can Redbeard come?"
So I will eventually finish the supernatural crossover, but this is not that. I am working on a lot of series right now, and I just wanted some one shots to get over some writer’s block. Besides, this clears up a plot hole I left in the chapter John Watson: Babysitter. A reminder on this one, the drinking age in the UK is 18 years old. I’ve never explicitly said where their house it, but I imagine it is somewhere in Great Britain. TRIGGER WARNING: Some allusions to underage canoodling.
"That's bloody convenient," John spat. "You just happen to need sleep at the same time we're going to going to have a row."
Sherlock's small face was scrunched up in frustration. He'd brought a little garden trowel in his backpack, but no matter how many holes he dug he hadn't found any treasure yet. He wrestled with the soil beneath a giant tree, positive that he'd found the right spot this time.
"Shall we show him your old room, Sherlock?" Rose asked with a smirk. "We could visit the house."
BREAKBREAKBREAKBREAKBREAKBREAKBREAK
John was wondering what he meant when he noticed the young woman was looking at him. She took a step toward him, shooting a conspiratorial glance at the suited man. "Sherlock, is this who I think it is?"
"How much do you know?" Mycroft asked.
Sherlock nodded, a tightening sensation surrounding his chest. John was planning. Of course he was. They couldn't keep their eyes open forever. There was no way out. No one knew they were here.
Rose loved her boys, but being a human with two half- Time Lord children could be difficult at times. The boys didn't sleep or eat as much as she did. Usually the Doctor had her covered; when she needed some human time he would stay up with the boys, sometimes for days at a time. He only really slept a few nights out of the week anyway. Unfortunately, this meant when she was alone with her sons it was hard to adjust to their schedules.
"Ha!" the Doctor called, rushing to the controls. "Now we have a plan."
"One thing that doesn't drive me absolutely crazy is the fact that you explain yourself, whether I understand it or not. You obviously don't want me to know something. You're hiding something from me, and I don't appreciate being kept out of the loop."
"No arguing," she insisted, standing her ground in front of the tall man.
Did he know who he was? Yes. Sherlock Tyler Holmes. Did he know where he was? Umm…he could get back to that one. How old was he? Twenty five. What had he taken? Heroin, definitely. Perhaps laced with opium, that usually his favorite type. How long? Well…
"The one behind me…" John started and trailed off.
Rose hadn't waited for the end of the massage. She was racing back towards the crime scene, the Doctor running just behind her. She's missed something, they all had, and now her son was in danger.
"Okay," the Doctor said, gently stopping her swinging arms. "You know that won't actually kill Weeping Angels, right. They're going to reconstitute in just a few hours. We'll take the boys home, then we'll have to come back to deal with them."
Sam pulled a piece of leather from his pocket and held it up, flashing a badge. “We’re not lurking, by the way, just doing surveillance. We’re with the FBI.” The Doctor scoffed. “Well,” Sam continued, “a special division.”
Sherlock opened his mouth, then closed it, eyes darting about in confusion. "I really have absolutely no idea. I'm just…glad to be home? Is that weird?"
"Mum!" he called. "Mum! Doctor! Please! Don't do this!"
Rose rolled her eyes and they headed off to meet the other two.
Sherlock shrugged. "I wasn't afraid," he said, too quietly to be true.
Sherlock steeled himself, clenching his fist. "My parents are in town."
John sighed, gathering the dishes together and taking them into the kitchen. Sherlock followed him, looking very annoyed that everyone seemed to expect something incomprehensible from him. "I wish someone would just tell me what these stupid little rules are. I can't be expected to guess every time someone is upset."
The large green field certainly didn't seem remarkable, but nonetheless when they stumbled upon it the Doctor clapped his hands together and sat the bag on the ground. "Give me a hand Mike," he called. "We have to hurry."
"Sherlock's right," the Doctor said. "With Mycroft, Rose's body didn't recognize the genes. The pregnancy was tricky; she was sick constantly, I had to monitor both of their heart rates at all times, he was born a few months early. When she was pregnant with Sherlock her body was expecting the difficulties. It made the whole thing easier, and in the end he came out slightly more human."
The man was tall with dark brown hair. He wore a tweed jacket with a bow tie just above it, and he seemed to have misplaced his eyebrows. He stared down at the boy. "Amy…I'm going to call you back. Tell Rose…no on second thought don't tell her anything. I never called you."
Rose understood why the Doctor had to be gone for the week, but it didn't make it easier. Jack needed help with a new program his team had confiscated from a crashed alien ship; usually not something the Doctor was interested in. However, supposedly the new program would make it impossible for any sort of violence to happen in the hub itself, making it a very safe place to store dangerous beings. Jack had offered the Doctor a good chunk of the sizeable budget Torchwood had at their disposal as payment to come help them install it and learn how to use it. It was for a good cause, and the money would help keep the boys' bellies full.
"I'm…I'm not…"
"I didn't steal a pie," he started, but the young boy rushed past him into the room and dived into the trash can next to his desk.
"How long has it been?"
"Oh, no," Rose said, crossing her arms. The Doctor raised an eyebrow at her, but looked away a bit guiltily when she shot him a look. "We've just gotten ahold of you. If you're investigating, we're helping you."
"Well," the Doctor said with a shrug, "you don't look terribly surprised to see a blue box appear in your living room, so I'm going to guess you've traveled with me before."
"Jump? What do you mean?" he'd asked, looking at him in concern.
"We hold onto these sticks and we put the string part into the water…" he said as he helped the boy cast, "and the fish get caught on the strings, and we try to catch as many as we can."
"The people in cages?"
John heard the door open as the adult version of Sherlock walked into the flat to see the TARDIS fading away. "Oh," the detective said, "I've just missed my parent's then? I've only just got your messages."
"Ha!" Sherlock shouted, hopping to his feet. He frowned at himself. "Oh, God, I'm not going to start saying that am I? This is why we don't spend time with my parents, John. Anyway, let's get started."
"I had a bit of an accident. Remember when we visited Moira when the boys were kids? I accidently crossed paths with Sherlock."
"I told you," Rose called from the kitchen. "He's too young."
The Doctor smiled, "Oh! That last case he told us about? I've been wanting to talk about that one more too. Fascinating case, really. I wouldn't have pegged you for it though, you hate when we go on over the fine details a dozen times."
John realized with a start that he was still staring at them. Was this some kind of new plastic surgery? Sherlock seemed unwilling to discuss it, even…embarrassed. John simply nodded, trying not to be rude.
Rose gave him a tight hug, and then she leaned over her son so that only he could hear her. "A month, Sherlock. Maybe less. You have to tell him."
"I know Dad said that there were no people out here. Maybe he was wrong." His eyes went wide. "Maybe there were space pirates, Redbeard."
"You were dead," Rose said again. "The purity of what you dosed yourself with was more than 90 percent, Sherlock. You injected way too much. You overdosed and you died."
The Doctor hopped up and clapped his hands once, loudly. "Well then. John knows, we've had tea, where should we go?"
"Sherlock…" the blonde woman said, looking at him like he was a misbehaving toddler. "Does John have any idea who we are?"
"You're going to get through this, you know. If anyone could pull through, you could," John said, setting his hand on Sherlock's arm.
Mycroft sighed and opened the door. "What are you talking about, now?"
The alien sun was rising in the sky as the family walked along a thin path. As the Doctor had promised, the planet Moira was basically one large forest. Rose had expected to land somewhere and set up camp on the spot, but to her surprise the Doctor had picked up the majority of the bags and began hiking straight from the TARDIS. She'd been a bit confused, but they trailed along after him.
The criminal smiled, looking back slightly over his shoulder. "I understand why I had trouble going against you two, before now. You were cheating. You and Sherlock, you had an advantage over me. There are secrets, buzzing around our little planet, aren't there. I'm just leveling the playing field, Mr. Holmes.
Sherlock huffed, pulling him towards his bedroom. "You want to know who I am? Fine." He threw open the bedroom door. "This is it, John. This is who I am."
"Yes. Well, okay, not entirely. I was born human. On Earth, right here in London actually. I met the Doctor when I was nineteen and he… looked a bit different. He'd been traveling in the TARDIS for centuries at that point, and when he got bored he would pick up a little human companion to keep him company. It was the greatest thing that had ever happened to me. Still is."
She whispered back at him. "Sherlock Tyler Holmes, do I look stupid to you? You have a month to reach that goal, and I am perfectly aware that you will wait until the last possible day to meet it. Now you either turn around and lead us all to the crime scene, or I really will tell John. Right. Now."
BreakBreakBreakBreakBreakBreakBreakBreakBreakBreakBreak
"A rank given to Gallifreyans who traveled in time. I believe I qualify."
Rose sighed and shook her head, looking at John. "I hate when they do that. Why is it obvious?"
"I...Um, I'm John Watson. A friend of yours."
He rubbed the side of his head. "I don't…I don't know…"
They had managed to save him before it was too late, but his condition was worse. That was the last time the man had spoken. His vitals were never as strong as they had been, and aside from the odd twitch, he lived his life as a statue.
John gasped as Sherlock took a step out of the door, using one hand to anchor himself to the side of the TARDIS and climbing agilely to sit on top of the box. John gasped, panicking as he grabbed ahold of Sherlock's long, dangling legs.
“We don’t know what you are,” Dean said, eying the Doctor suspiciously, “but we know you’re not human. We weren’t expecting a whole...nest? How many of you are there?”
John tried to chase the memory from his head, talking aloud to himself and his patient. "Do you remember why this is my favorite?" he held up the old book. "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Someone bought me this as a joke, you know, when I was a kid. My name is in the book; Dr. John Watson. It's not that uncommon of a name, someone was bound to get it again, I guess. So, when I was ten, someone bought me this old thing as a joke on my name, and just to show them up, I read the whole thing. I just think it's funny, your last name being Holmes and all. It's like it's us in the stories, eh? I must have read it to you a hundred times by now, sorry if it's getting boring."
"Are you John's friend too, Mycroft?" the boy asked, cutting him off midsentence.
Mycroft turned around to watch his mother, staring at the bowl on her lap. Whatever it was, it smelled good, and he had never seen it before.
Rose nodded, but the little boy on her lap huffed. "What's wrong, Mike?"
He called his flat-mate's phone, but it went immediately to voicemail. "You're going to regret going out, Sherlock. Your parents are back already. Get home when you can."
"He doesn't go up to people on the street and announce all of his family's habits and traits, sure, but he has never hid them. He doesn't care what other people think about him. Except for you. Because of you, he's been scheduling our meetings so that we always find him alone in his flat. You've been living with him for more than a year, and I've never met you. He's never even mentioned you. We might have thought he was living alone if Mycroft hadn't been keeping us up to date."
He set the phone on the consul, then leaned down to Sherlock's height. "Sherlock…do you know who I am?"
"What do you mean?" Sherlock asked.
John smiled. Sherlock never did get to be a pirate like he wanted, but he had a feeling there were things more important to him. Sherlock had what he had wanted as a child, and he'd never have to go without it again.
Sherlock snorted. "Why? I don't need them to follow a simple case, John. I expect to have this one solved in minutes. It's just a way to distract myself from the doldrums of time travel." John chuckled once, and Sherlock shot him a look. "What?"
"It's just empty space, John. You can't learn anything from up here. It's on the surface of the planet that things matter. Calendars and streets and light bulbs—they matter. You can use them to deduce things, to solve mysteries and learn about the people who use them. Space is just nothing."
The taller man reached into his jacket and pulled out a flask, then lobbed it at them gently. The Doctor took a step back, looking at it suspiciously. “That’s just water. Dump a little on your hand, and we’ll explain.”
Sherlock sighed, pulling off his jacket and rolling his sleeves up past his elbows and holding out his arms. "Don't be subtle please, it's not your strong point. Go on, check them for needle marks."
"What month is it?"
"It um…it means light hair."
"More like fifty," she laughed softly. "If they knew you were home they'd both be up in a heartbeat."
"They're like stars!" Sherlock grinned as the Doctor swung him up to his shoulders.
"Took you long enough."
"It was a broken neck," John said, bending over the body of a man lying on the street. The man had scraggily hair and a beard to match, with weathered lines running across his empty face. His patched clothing was threadbare and hardly adequate, but his skin was still warm from the layer of sweat. The mud caking his thrifty shoes had left slight tracks behind him, but nothing solid enough to follow.
"Never. Not once. He doesn't want these two parts of his life to collide. He cares about what you think of him, John, and that's something you should be proud of."
"I…I think so," he said. He'd tried to write all this down the week before, just to wrap his head around certain concepts, but it all seemed like some form of nonsensical madness.
Sherlock looked at the pole a moment in deep thought, and then tossed the whole thing into the water.
"Hey," Rose frowned.
"Is it ever empty?" John asked.
John glanced at all of them as if there was some big conspiracy unfolding around him. "Okay, it's the TARDIS. What does that mean?"
"I have plans."
"And I was already in love with you," she nodded. "Did you love me then?"
John nodded to him, quickly running down the street to catch his friend, he almost ran into him when he turned the corner; the detective was just standing on the sidewalk, staring at a densely wooded park next to them. The wrought iron gates covered most of the park, and you could scarcely see inside it at all, but you could just make out where a muddy footprint had been left at the base of the steep trail at the base of the entrance.
“My name is Dean Winchester, and this is my brother Sam. We’re just trying to help. We’re not looking to hurt anyone.”
This is as far as ACITT has come, but I intend to finish it! Transferring all of these has reminded me how much I love these old ones. If you have any ideas for more one shots, please let me know!
He looked up wondering why he was alone. Where was his flat-mate?
Words caught in his throat. "N-nothing. Sorry, it's nothing."
"Why?" John asked, staring at the stony figure behind Sherlock. They were stuck. The cages on either side of the room formed a very narrow alley. John and Sherlock were practically in the middle, a yard or two apart, facing each other. One statue stood behind Sherlock, and one behind John, blocking off their exits. There was no answer for a long moment, so he tried again. "Sherlock, what happens if I blink?"
"No… I kind of like it. It shows me not to try to label my boys. They're special, always changing, and they don't like to follow the boring rules. If I start calling him 'shorty' I bet he'll be seven foot tall one day out of spite."
John nodded.
"Mycroft has told us about how close you two are. He says that you act as human as possible all the time, just so John doesn't notice anything is off."
Sherlock stared at him. "We are friends, John."
The Doctor dropped what he was working on, and the sudden gaze from his eyes to Sherlock's was too intense. The young man looked away.
Redbeard turned deeper into the woods, trotting away from the camp. Sherlock followed him jogging to keep up with the dog. After a few minutes, he couldn't hear his parents anymore. He was just about to tell Redbeard they had to turn around, and then something came into view. He was very confused.
"Angels…so sorry…have to jump…my note…John…"
"Because you already don't! You still think those are strangers downstairs. You don't believe me when I tell the truth, so why should I bother?"
Sherlock was staring at him, something unreadable in his expression.
"Redbeard, go on," Rose called offhandedly. The dog jumped to his feet and went
"Half a meter. Maybe. My eyes are blurry."
"He keeps coming into my room," Mycroft complained.
"What?"
"Plenty," the Doctor nodded, "and they're edible too." He knelt down next to his youngest son and handed him the small pole. "Okay Sherlock, go ahead and cast it into the water."
"You think I'd get up and play, huh?" he asked, pulling his little stuffed hedgehog closer to his chest.
The Doctor sighed and set the device carefully into Sherlock's hand. "Be careful. Just a quick scan. Do you remember how to do it?"
"Can I…Can I go look at them?"
By eleven o'clock he had determined that Sherlock was not going to wake him up. He assumed his flat-mate must finally be getting some rest of his own—he hadn't slept much at all this last week—and pulled himself out of his comfortable daze to make a bit of late morning tea to drink as he read his paper. He had made it all the way to the kitchen before he noticed Sherlock lying on the couch, wide awake, staring at the ceiling. He knew better than to attempt a greeting. If Sherlock had let him sleep so long, he must be miles into his mind-palace, and any attempt at communication would be futile.
"Things have to end. Otherwise new adventures would never begin. It's not something to be afraid of, it's something to look forward to."
"What?"
"Said literally every parent ever," she teased.
"That's right, Baby."
Sherlock was confused. Voices didn't usually make it through to his palace, and no one here knew his real name.
"I'm not—"
"I like science," he said, looking around the room. "Everything is made of science, you know? Atoms are science, and everything in the whole wide universe is made of atoms."
"Found it!" he cried, positioning himself behind Rose and Jackie. He set Mycroft ankles over his shoulder so that his face would be in the frame, then pulled Rose and her mother closer. Jackie lifted the infant so that you could see his wild, questioning eyes.
Sherlock was still not looking up from the floor. John sighed, clapping him on the shoulder once as they followed the couple out of the building. "We need to talk. Soon."
"You like pirates," John said quickly, remembering something Rose had mentioned when he'd first met her. "Bees. I think you mentioned something about liking bees last week. You play the violin."
"Well," the Doctor said in a long, drawn out drawl, "we've got that sorted. Did you want to go on a, um…ride in the family car, or would you rather just stay here a bit?"
"Well," Mycroft said, crossing to the center of the room and leaning against the desk, "it's just as well, I suppose. I was looking for both of you."
The Doctor frowned. "We're camping, Mike. We have…camp things to do. Fishing, hiking, roasting things…camp!"
John was about to protest when a small boy poked his head out of the TARDIS. He was about to ask who it was, but the words caught in his throat. He knew those eyes, that hair, that apprehensive glance around the apartment. He'd never seen the boy before in his life, but he knew exactly who he was.
"John," he whispered into the darkness. "John I just want to sleep. Can I go to sleep?"
"What about you two?" The Doctor asked, a bit suspicious.
Jim Moriarty knelt in front of him, waving the still ringing phone in front of him with a wide smile across his gloating face. "Are we really that surprised that Sherlock didn't answer?" he asked conspiratorially. "Not your biggest fan, is he?"
"Best be off," the Doctor said, shooting his sulking son a look. "Good to see you, Sherlock. We'll be by again."
“Because this is what a real one looks like,” the Doctor said, following his son’s lead as he held up a piece of paper.
"That's not what I wanted to know. Would we…would we be sent to the same year? The same place? Or would you be alone?"
Sherlock shot his Rose a look and she backed away sheepishly. "Nothing. Sorry, Sherlock's right. It's not important."
John watched as the box faded away, and then finally they were alone. He crossed his arms at the crumpled, motionless form of his flat mate. There was a full minute of heavy silence, then finally John sighed, throwing his hands up uselessly.
Sherlock gasped, automatically stepping back from John and closing his scorched eyes, John did the same, shaking where he stood.
"Missed you," she whispered.
Where's John?
"You look me in the eye and tell me John Watson is just your friend."
"I should go," John said, shaking the man's hand once again. "It was nice to meet you Mr…?"
"Camping gear. For the camping trip."
"I was," she shrugged.
John stood still, trying to work through what she'd said, but he finally gave up and just followed her upstairs.
John rubbed the bridge of his nose. "Why would I want to leave, Sherlock? Why would I want you to leave?"
"This is your choice, you know," the Doctor said, pulling a jar of jam from the fridge. "You could come with us. No time, no responsibilities, no murders. Well, almost no murders, there is the occasional… Just take a break from Earth. My offer still stands."
(See the end of the chapter for
The End
"You're wrong. He's not…he's not interested. He can't be."
-------------------------------------------------------
Sherlock popped his collar up over his neck, smiling softly. "Of course. I'm Sherlock Holmes. You're John Watson. The game is on, John. It feels like it has been a long time."
"I'd love that. Take me there now. Let's leave, right now. If I can't sleep, let me get out of this room. Tell me how to get out of this dark, dark place, John."
"I have no idea what you're talking about—"
Sherlock made a face at the stethoscope. "Do you really think that's necessary? I feel fine."
"Wow," John said, shaking his head. "I knew you had the streets of London memorized, but I didn't realize you had their histories memorized as well."
"For you, maybe," John said, still staring at him. "I can't believe…you're really not human."
"Rose?" he asked softly, staring at her raised hand.
"When?" Rose insisted.
He strained to hear the voices behind the door.
"Wouldn't work for you," she said, grasping his hand. "It's a Mum thing."
"I told him this morning that I'd be stopping by. He hasn't gone out on that boring Hofstede case, has he? It's painfully obvious that the husband did it. I suspect he just wanted to avoid me."
"Rose," John continued, "you're human?"
"Are you coming or not?" Sherlock called from down the street.
"Yes, incorrectly. Had I been born on Gallifrey I would have passed my operating test with flying colors. You can't manage to park on the street."
John stared at him. "Centuries?"
"Yes?"
"I used to use that seat when I was a child. The flights aren't really that bad."
"Before. I don't know exactly when. A Tuesday. I've had a lot of those— let's keep going the clearing is not far off from here."
The woman seemed to know this too, based on the warning look she shot at him. "I think it's the famous Dr. John Watson that Mycroft has been telling us about." She smiled at John. "Am I right?"
"It's too small for dinner," Mycroft muttered through a smile.
Sherlock looked away from him, helping his mother incapacitate the other Angel. The little family pulled people out of their cages, and the Doctor scanned them carefully.
"They've only just arrived," Sherlock said, straightening out his jacket. He noticed John staring at him. "What?"
John raised an eyebrow. "Well?"
"Could be," John nodded. "Sorry to disappoint you. I can tell him to call you when he gets home, but I can't be sure he'll do it."
"Love isn't just a human emotion," she reminded him. "Your father loves me, and you boys, and almost everything else in the universe. Don't tell yourself that you're wrong for feeling something." She pressed a quick kiss to his cheekbone, patting him on the arm. "Go get the money. I won't tell him. Yet. I'll give you a few weeks. Maybe a month. Then I'm stepping in. I've made the decision."
The Doctor felt Sherlock’s small hand grab the back of his knee.
The Doctor stared at him, a bit shocked. "Mum and Mycroft are waiting for us," he said finally. "Another day, I promise. Go buckle up."
Sherlock's eyes lit up. "It's a mystery?"
John chuckled and sipped at his tea. "Right. When is this meeting, then?"
"Fish freak me out," she insisted.
"Why not?"
"Oh, I think you might," he taunted in a sing-song voice. "Your office is under the impression that you are doing some undercover work in Russia, courtesy of a friend of mine who knows a thing or two about your personal correspondences. Sherlock won't notice you're missing, will he? If I send him a bothersome text from your phone every few days he'll think everything is perfectly normal."
"But you'll be busy negotiating. Mum doesn't understand the software. I know the risks, and I'm old enough to make the choice."
"You're babbling," Rose said suspiciously. "You're up to something."
She frowned. "What?"
As soon as Sherlock screamed, it took only seconds for Rose and Mycroft to make it outside. The boy was standing behind a very angry Doctor who had taken his screwdriver back and was holding his son out of harm’s way. The screwdriver was aimed at two men both holding shotguns trained on the small family.
The Doctor opened the flask and sniffed it, running his screwdriver over it once before pouring a little on the his hand. It rolled off harmlessly. The men seemed to relax a bit, but the shorter man nodded to Sherlock. “The kid too. It won’t hurt him.”
He frowned. "Oh. We can do that too."
"Careful!" he called. "I don't know what's in those."
He shut the door behind him, leaving Mycroft tied up in the dark.
"Help me, then, John. Help me solve this case, and I'll get out of here."
But John stopped talking there. He'd expected to see a small, closed in, blue walls on the inside closet, with the infuriating genius standing there like a tall broom in a cupboard. That was not what was in front of him. Inside the box was a large room decorated in a grungy coral pattern, with grated metal floor. Sherlock was standing near the center of the room in front of what appeared to be a large, circular consul full of strange gears and levers, with long glass columns at its center. The taller man leaned against the column, arms crossed as he looked calmly at John.
The smile faltered a bit. "What about John? Do you think he loves him back? If we push Sherlock into this and John rejects him—I don't think he could handle that. It wouldn't just set him back, Rose, it would destroy everything. Do you see the way he shows off for John? I thought he was just trying to be impressive, but it makes sense now. I don't think he could live like he was before, without John. Maybe…maybe it's better not to risk such a close friendship."
He pulled the large volume out and set it on his knees. "I've brought my favorite book again. I know we read about two-thirds of The Hobbit already, but I think I need a bit of a break. I'm tired of doing the voices."
"Um, about 1880, I think. Maybe a bit before. What about you?"
John waited for him to finish, but the man had finished. "Sorry, I don't think I caught that. Doctor wh-"
The man shook his head slowly. He seemed drowsier as the seconds passed, as if he could fall asleep at any moment. The other were slowing down as well, dropping to the bottom of the cages into a deep sleep. "No. We never see them do it, really. We see them standing at the door. We find food in our tins, laced with something to knock us out so they can come in when we're all asleep. Then when we wake up, two or three people are gone."
"Oh." John said simply. They sat in silence for a few minutes, but he finally lowered the paper and peered at Sherlock. "Is this for…do you have a case you're working on?"
"Goodnight," he whispered into her hair. "Love you."
"Obviously not," he said, huffing. He was more confused than anything. Why should it matter to him that Sherlock had a past? John had a childhood as well, but it wasn't like they'd ever discussed it before. But hearing Sherlock shut him out—to actively keep things from him—it burned him in ways he cared not to admit. "Friends trust each other, Sherlock."
"Ah, just give them a minute. We haven't seen Sherlock in a while. His schedule tends to be a bit erratic."
A small boy with black curls sat underneath a table holding a magnifying glass, inspecting a small gouge in the kitchen floor. He ran his finger over it and tried to focus very hard. The tile was broken in the middle, not on the side, so it was unlikely to be caused by normal wear and tear. The dining table above him hadn't been moved at at any time during his memory. There had to be an answer. He scrunched up his face and thought as hard as he could, then huffed in frustration.
"Oh, no," she shivered. "I'm happy just here, thank you. I don't like to set foot on boats, much less… whatever that Police Box is."
"Not at the moment," Sherlock said. He'd resumed his inspection of the ceiling, but at least he was responsive.
"And where would that be?"
"I love my son. He is wonderful, and brilliant, and the one of the most important people in the universe, but I'm not stupid. People who don't know him the way I do…they don't understand him. He puts people off. Mycroft told me about the first time he met you. He was looking out for his brother, just like we asked him to. He said Sherlock was letting someone new into his life, and he tested you. He offered you quite a bit of money to spy on him for you, and you refused. How long had you known him, then?"
"It's getting dark."
The boy nodded, pulling his legs up to his chest. He looked away from John shyly, clutching one of his pant-legs.
"The ground is red."
"Then you're not very good friends, are you?"
The man's face twitched in response, the way it usually did when John started talking. John liked to think they had become friends, even if the man would never recognize him when he woke up. If he woke up. He shook the sad thought out of his head.
"What's that?"
She would have tickled him if she didn't know it would wake him up more than he already was. "That's it. Now I want you to take a minute to think about all of the things I've told you I've done with my life. Think a second about all of the things I've seen, all the people I've met. Everything I've ever done I've done in fifty years."
"Wait," John said, "what do you mean by piloting?"
"If I were a pirate," Sherlock announced to his dog, "I would want to bury my treasure under a huge tree like this. So, we'll probably have to dig deep under the roots."
"Hole's don't just appear. Do you think it's a worm hole?"
"Yep," she said, with a smile. She scooted a little closer and pulled him into a cuddle, petting back his wild hair. Sometimes it was easy for her to forget how young Sherlock really was. He did not speak like a six year old, and she had a nagging suspicion that he had passed her intelligence a year ago. The key was not letting him know that.
He frowned. He usually had a decent timeframe as to how long he'd lost during a blackout. Nothing was coming to him now. Where was he?
"I jumped off a building, John."
The Doctor held up a small device from his pocket, not looking up from his work. "Future tech. It can reanimate a recent victim, if administered in less than three minutes. We got there in two and a half."
Sherlock huffed, not looking at his mother. "John is important to me."
John smiled after a long moment, shaking his head at his flatmate. "You didn't tell me your parents were coming."
"Mummy, am I going to die?"
"For Time Lords, sure," he answered, following close behind him. "Your 'transport' is human. You've only got the one body, and you're stuck with it for life."
"I don't think you do," John said, clearly frustrated. He stalked ahead of him, and Sherlock watched his friend's back as he quickly descended the staircase.
He struggled once against the ties. "What? What are you talking about?"
Sherlock flinched, and John was actually pretty surprised that he seemed to be thinking it over.
A/N: A very good question by jacks marie got me wondering about why they chose the names Mycroft and Sherlock, so here's a little ficlet to explain that. Enjoy!
"Any change?"
He could hear the absolute frustration ringing in his words. Sherlock looked away from the Doctor, pulling once against the ties. "I'm awake. I'm not going to fall out of the chair. Can you untie me?"
"Then what's the point of kidnapping me? Sherlock won't know, so he has no reason to come after me. If he is your goal, you can't get to him through me."
"Oh," Sherlock said quickly, "I suppose you're right. You stay in the flat, I'll leave. You can go on to bed, I'll be gone within the hour."
The man smiled. "Yes. Do you want proof?"
"Why do we sleep more than Daddy?" he asked.
Right. John told him to solve it. That was why it was important. He remembered that. Every day, John told him to solve this case. But why didn't he remember seeing John? He was so tired.
"For a while. Ten years or so I think. Then I started to wonder about…certain things," she glanced at the Doctor. "I wasn't aging, but I was still maturing, slowly. I was about thirty-five when I realized that if we ever wanted a child, it would have to be before I got too old. We weren't sure it was even possible, a Time Lord and a human, but a year later we had Mycroft. Seven years later Sherlock was a bit of a surprise, but we needed him."
The only thing the two boys' room had in common was the ceiling. The Doctor and Rose had painted them together before the family even moved in. Above each boy's bed was a ceiling full of the universe; thousands of stars in their correct places, planets that were visible from Earth, and some that were just out of sight. As Rose lay there in Sherlock's room at three in the morning the stars seemed to swirl in front of her tired eyes. He insisted on having the light on—he'd read a book in the TARDIS library about weeping angels, and ever since he had been insistent that he needed to have some kind of light around him at all time. She had tried to assure him that the dark was not that scary, but one bout with the Vashta Nerada later both he and Mycroft insisted on nightlights.
"Not a fan."
John took a step back, but Sherlock rolled his eyes. "They extend almost ten feet on either side while we're in space. You're perfectly safe. Watch."
"No, it's not like that. They're not together. Sherlock hasn't told him."
"Sherlock!" John gasped.
Sherlock looked around the consul room as if John had forgotten were they were. "You don't think we're…too weird?"
"It's not like we traveled all of the time," Rose agreed. "We had the house. Would you rather have been kept in the dark about who we were?"
Rose took John's hand quite suddenly, pulling him purposefully towards the door with her. "Don't be silly, John, it's about time we got to meet you! Mycroft's been telling us about you since the day you moved in, you have to stay. Mrs. Hudson keeps the best cakes, I'm sure she won't mind if we sneak a few back up here."
Mycroft frowned. "I suppose."
"Dad, how old am I when you come from?"
John sighed. "Why are you lying to me?"
Rose yawned. She was not built for this. It was about three in the morning now, and on a normal night, she would have been in bed hours before.
"Long day, Dear?" she asked.
"We wait."
"A note," he said, a bit grumpily. She heard the rustling of a piece of paper, and then he recited it, his voice dripping in thinly veiled sass.
They had decided when Mycroft was only eight that the boys needed a stable place to call home. The TARDIS was wonderful, but it wasn't exactly grounded. The boys never knew where they'd be when they walked through the door, and on nights when they were afraid or nervous about the dark or monsters they sometimes refused to go near the front doors. It was like showing your children that the boogeyman could in fact be in their closet any time it wanted, but it could only get them if they left the TARDIS. It wasn't healthy.
"I can't…I've never really realized that you must have parents. I can't imagine you or Mycroft any younger than you are now."
Sherlock just shrugged, still staring at his bedroom door. John wasn't sure exactly what he expected to come through the door. He quickly developed a mental image of what Sherlock's parents must be like. They would be old, but reserved and impeccably dressed. The woman would be stern and agile, the man would be distant and brilliant like his sons. It was intimidating. He suddenly found himself wishing that he had gone for a pint when he had a chance.
“How about we ask the questions?” the man asked. “Like what are you?”
"He's lying, Dad," Sherlock said in a loud whisper. "I don't have friends."
The Doctor took her hand gently. "You were never my companion, Rose Tyler," he said quietly, pressing a quick kiss to her fingers.
John chuckled joylessly. "You bloody idiot. I don't need time to think about anything, I told you I was okay with this."
“Weird how?” he asked.
"Sure, loads," the client nodded.
Dr. John Watson was just about ready to head home for the day. His patients had been dealt with, his paperwork was done, but there was something he had to do first. This was his routine, every day before he left the hospital, he had to at least check on the man in room 221.
Sherlock jumped. "Sorry? What?"
"Yes I do."
"Sorry," he said, genuine regret in his voice. "Did Sherlock play twenty questions tonight?"
"Rose!" he called. "Rose, wait!"
"No!" she said quickly, relaxing his hand with hers, gently. "He's clean. I'm talking about the elephant in the room."
Sherlock was six, and he was still happy to have his room decorated by his parents. Pirates were his favorite, so everything in his room had a nautical theme. There were no fake props in here, either; all of the decorations were souvenirs from their travels. The old helm hung on his wall had once been on a real pirate ship. The murals of waves were paintings they'd based on pictures from their trips to the time period.
John stared at her, open mouthed. "I…I have work tomorrow."
He turned and looked at the little boy observing him, mouth hanging open a bit. He was not one to babysit often, if ever, and he had no idea what he was doing. He told himself to calm down—it was just Sherlock, after all. He knew this person, though he wasn't used to seeing him so young. He redialed the number on his phone again, holding it limply to his ear.
Rose knew her way around Mrs. Hudson's kitchen. The landlady was not in today, John was fairly sure he'd heard her mention something about shopping with their neighbor Mrs. Turner. Still, Rose made herself right at home, ignoring the decoy sweets jar on the table and pulling down the tin where she kept her best cakes and biscuits.
“What?” Sam asked a little nervously. “Why would you say that?”
Rose hugged her back, obviously glad to see her. "It has. Mum says you've been coming around for dinner though, right? Few times a month?"
"I shouldn't care about getting old, huh Mummy? 'Cause I'm only six?"
Mycroft was out the door, but the damage had been done. The boy was staring at John. "What did he mean, 'tell me when I get home'?"
Rose crawled under the table and peered at the hole. "Huh, I've never noticed that one."
Other names were entirely foreign to him. Vashtra and Jenny, Professor Song, Sam and Dean W, and something known only as 'the Ponds', to name a few. However, he had complete confidence in his future self. If he had decided (or rather, would one day decide) that these people could take care of the boys, then he believed it entirely.
The morning was peaceful. Building their home so far from human civilization had certain perks, and one of them was the gentle way in which Rose got to wake up in the mornings. The Doctor and their boys hadn't slept the night before, so she had the bed entirely to herself. The air was cool and refreshing, and she could hear a bird singing somewhere in the distance. Everything was wonderful.
The Doctor kissed her forehead. "Okay. In the worst case scenario, he still has us."
"We don't have to go!" an indignant Mycroft argued as the Doctor pulled the list from its designated spot. "I'm fifteen, I can handle myself with a few Sontarans."
He tried to focus on the last thing he could remember. He was in the house on Darter Street, the abandoned one that people squatted in sometimes. His usual dealer stayed in the basement, and usually found a little spot in the upper levels to…well…consume what he had purchased.
"Of course," Sherlock muttered. He heard shuffling as John pulled his coat back on.
"So by then I had only to figure out whether the saboteur was the surgeon or the sailor," Sherlock said with a flourish. "That was obvious of course."
He scrunched up his face. "Younger than Daddy. Three hundred, maybe."
"That's wrong," Sherlock said suddenly, making her jump.
John stood in front of the open doors of the TARDIS, staring out at the vastness of the Earth. It was the largest most amazing thing he had ever witnessed, but it was only one planet. He tried to imagine the concept—billions of planets and stars at so many points in time, going on in both directions for trillions of years. He was only one man, with a very small life, alive for only eighty years or so. He was utterly insignificant.
"I think we need to have a talk."
"You said you had plans."
"Okay. Why do you like this place so much?" Sherlock asked as the Doctor gently started to usher him to the door.
"Rose—" Sherlock started trying to cut her off.
The hand slapped against the side of his face again, hard enough to shake his teeth, and with a sudden crash he felt the Mind Palace crumble around him. He took a sharp breath and opened his eyes, his real eyes, gasping for breath. At first everything was blurry, but he saw someone in front of him. His body was tied firmly to something with soft ties, and he was sitting in a char of some kind. He tugged at the binds as his vision swam. He blinked finally realizing who was in front of him.
"Amazing," the man said, shaking his head. "You two are absolutely amazing. People would love to hear about the things you two do."
"Then why is there a path?"
"Well," the Doctor said, wrinkling his nose, "half Galllifreyan. Time Lord was a rank."
"No!" he said suddenly, pushing her back a bit. "You don't understand. It can't be like that."
"I know."
"Nothing important," Sherlock said quickly.
"They should be fine," he announced. "They've been drugged, underfed, but they'll live."
Rose eyed him suspiciously as she sat next to them all, leaning to grab a lantern.
Rose set a hand on Sherlock's arm, something unspoken passing between them. They stared at each other a moment, and then Rose nodded. "Okay. Yes, John, we're Sherlock's parents. We'd rather not explain right now, if it's all the same with you."
"Fairly small nest," the Doctor said, shaking his head. "These should be the only two."
"That's okay," he said, "just tell me now. Please, I'm not as smart as I thought I was. I've been in here for so long, John. You're my best friend. Help me."
"You haven't hit the ground," John told him. "If you go to sleep, you'll hit the pavement, and you won't survive this time. Dr. John Watson. It's not that uncommon of a name, someone was bound to get it again, I guess. So, when I was ten, someone bought me this old thing as a joke on my name, and just to show them up, I read the whole thing. I just think it's funny, your last name being Holmes and all. It's like it's us in the stories, eh? I must have read it to you a hundred times by now, sorry if it's getting boring."
"I like it. The ceiling would look different if we fixed it.
Rose nudged her husband. “Not in front of the boys,” she warned him.
"More so than me," Sherlock said with a smirk.
"Nope, that's against the rules of my time line. This is an accident actually. I'm planning…a vacation of sorts. This is one of my favorite planets for a getaway, I just didn't realize it was occupied right now. I'll have to make a note of it in my plans. Now, Sherlock, can you tell me what our number one family rule is?"
"You were looking for me?" John asked, sitting at sofa. "Why?"
"Oh, right," he said uncomfortably. "John, this is Rose Tyler and… John Smith."
"Are there actually even fish on this planet?" he grumbled.
"And Sherlock?" she asked.
"Well… I guess maybe for a few minutes, when there's a lull in foot traffic."
He had to tell him. Soon. And when he did, that would be the end of his association with John Watson. Some things were too impossible to hope for. John would never be able to live comfortably in their flat once he knew that his flatmate was in love with him. He had only a few weeks left, at most. A few weeks to spend as much time with John as he could, to store up a room in his mind full of memories that he could live off of once he was forcibly removed from John's life.
She smiled at him, scribbling something down quickly on the patient's chart. "Hello Dr. Watson. Back to see our friend here?"
"Okay Dad," Sherlock nodded as his dog bounded ahead of him to show the way. "I'll see you later!"
"You bought fish."
"Oh good! You know Sherlock too, that'll save even more time."
His friend grimaced, looking back and forth between his bedroom door and the door that led out of the flat. "I'm terribly sorry, John, but it's too late for you now. You'll be stuck here, same as me."
"Right," the Doctor said quickly, "no need for fish anyway I've brought plenty of dinner."
"It's nothing," Sherlock said quickly and unconvincingly. He took John's arm and tried to lead him to the door. "It shouldn't take long, a few hours at the most. Believe me I want to be through with this obligation as quickly as possible."
John sat quickly on the bench, fastening one of the seatbelts around himself as the TARDIS started to move. Sherlock chuckled.
"Did Sherlock change his mind about the wild goose chase?"
"Do you know how he takes his tea, too?"
"Going? Where?"
"It's not—"
"You see? I'm your friend."
"Why not? If I was being chased by a killer I don't know how picky I'd be."
"Um, yeah," he nodded. "It's interesting, but—"
"But neither of us said anything."
She raised her hand as though she was going to slap his face again, but stopped herself. "You were dead."
"I wasn't. Statistically, Father usually wins against the Daleks. They didn't want to kill me, they wanted to use me as a bargaining chip, and I it. It was the equivalent of being yelled at for two hours by angry salt and pepper shakers. I told you that I didn't need to talk about it, but you bothered me about it for two days, convinced I need to talk about the experience."
John shook his head absently. "It's brilliant." The smiled slowly disappeared, and he suddenly turned to Sherlock. "Hang on, how the hell did you not know that the Earth turned around the sun?"
"More than sure. He told me."
"Say TARDIS, Mike. Come on."
"Dad!" Sherlock screamed, backing up quickly and running toward the house.
"So do I."
"Looking for evidence. The pie tin must be in here."
"Most people go fishing."
"That's not the issue."
There was a loud crash of stone and metal, echoing around a sharp screech. Another. Another.
"Or," John said with a smirk, "we could just go check out that old house over there."
"You and your doctor, we'll go and have a drink together at Angelo's."
"I'm still here, Sherlock. I'll be here as long as you need me."
"Yes," John said, carefully blinking one eye at a time again.
Rose and the Doctor sat across from him while Sherlock detailed in length the way he had solved his last elephant-filled case a few days before. John didn't mean to stare, but there was a draw to the couple, something intangible but very real that made him want to observe them. They sat very close as if they were trying to occupy the same space. The Doctor's hand was curled lightly over hers, so casually that John wondered if he even knew he was doing it. Sherlock's story was just as convoluted and self-praising as his versions always were, but the couple was paying rapt attention.
"How can I possibly know who you think it is?" Sherlock shrugged flippantly. John recognized the tone; he was being purposefully petulant.
Sherlock nodded. "He has this notion that I need to eat and sleep every night. You should hear him go on about the time. 'It's midnight Sherlock, get some sleep. It's 3 in the morning, Sherlock, we do microwave flammable objects at 3 in the morning. It's noon, stop sleeping on the floor.' He has this idea that the time of day should determine what you're allowed to do. Time was not meant to be scheduled so arbitrarily."
"Cake," the infant informed her politely, reaching at the bowl.
"Oh," John said suddenly, "I'll get out of your hair and let you have some family time—"
"You want some cake, Mikey?" Rose asked.
She felt him smile and some of the tension left his little body. She wondered how long he'd held in this question, but knew he would be too embarrassed to talk about it. Sherlock yawned. "Mummy?"
Jackie frowned. "Don't tell me you're going with a boring last name like Smith? Oh, God, you're not calling them Mycroft and Sherlock Doctor are you? That's just cruel."
"My mind is as organized as it ever was," Sherlock said, rewarming the kettle and pulling cups down from the cupboards. "Everything else is just transport. Bodies come and go."
Sherlock blinked. "How did you even know where I was?"
Jackie snorted.
Sherlock scoffed. "You're being ridiculous. You know Mycroft and I—"
"Like I said," he admitted, "you were young. I was afraid you'd get bored with life on the TARDIS. I thought it'd be wrong, like I was taking advantage of you."
The Doctor lit up. "There's pie?"
“What are you? Burglars? Are you with Torchwood?”
She hugged him again, softer this time. "I thought I could do that, too. I loved the Doctor from the first day we met. I thought, 'there's no way someone so amazing could ever love me'. I thought, 'just be a good companion, follow the rules, make him like you, and then you can stay with him for a while'. It's not enough. You'll see him with someone else, the bloody mistress of the King of France for instance, and it'll hurt too much. It'll hurt like a knife in your back, Sweetheart. It'll be worse than losing him altogether."
"I guess it'll just stay a mystery then," she shrugged, kissing him once on the forehead and wiggling out from under the table. Sherlock heard her messing about a bit by the fridge and went back to inspecting the spot.
"Of course. How is he?" John asked, taking the chart from her.
"Excuse me?"
Sherlock realized with a start that he still had his arms around John. His eyes burned, and as he tried to blink them one at a time, he realized how slim their chances were. This building was old, it was bound to be renovated before Mycroft ever arrived. All the time he had had at his disposal in Baker Street, and only now, in their last few seconds, had he ever hugged John Watson—and this had been an accident. He didn't let go.
John peered up the stairs, watching Sherlock disappear up into the second floor. He shuffled awkwardly, wishing he had a more interesting role to play. He wanted some action, a bit of excitement to get his adrenaline pumping. He sighed, glancing away from the staircase back to the empty sitting room.
"I swear he can understand us already," he said, attracting Mycroft's attention again. "Mycroft, I think you can understand me. Talking is what Mummy and I are doing. You use your mouth to say what you're thinking. I think you can do it already, just give it a try."
“Not gonna’ happen,” the shorter man said. “You drop your...stick.”
"We are not unique, we are freaks," he snapped. "I'd rather John never know that I'm not entirely human."
He frowned. "That's what I'm trying to do. There's a case, we have to investigate. Shall we meet up later, take in a few sights before we head back—"
“Dean,” Sam tapped his arm, “she’s the other one. The one from the oil painting.”
The interior was fairly simple; the building had once been a modest house. The door opened into a sitting room, empty and uncovered by carpeting or wallpaper. There were a few doors leading to other rooms and a wooden staircase to the right, leading up to the second floor.
"Your offer to be one of the dozens of little companions you've had on the TARDIS? I'll pass, thanks."
Dr. John Watson was only on the third page of the story when he heard a voice. He looked up, expecting to see someone at the door. There was no one there. He slowly turned his head, staring at the patient lying unconscious in the bed.
Trembling, Sherlock grabbed the door to the shed and swung it open.
The Doctor strolled in a moment later and didn't even say anything, he just walked over and gently pulled Sherlock out of the trashcan and threw him over his shoulder. "Dad, I'm looking for a clue! The investigation isn't over," he protested.
"Sherlock, wait!" John cried, running after him. He was far too late.
It was this intense need to protect them that made the Doctor think of the idea in the first place. The boys were still young, Sherlock still in diapers, when it occurred to him that he was going to need a list. There were certain people throughout time and space whom the Doctor trusted completely. He knew that if he and Rose were in a bind, or their situation was too gruesome, or heaven forbid they died trying to save some planet or people, that he could absolutely trust these people with his sons.
"It was over very quickly, no one will get hurt. Father should be along in a few minutes. Don't be afraid."
"Not exactly," John admitted. "I'm John Watson, I'm a Doctor. This is Sherlock Holmes. He's sort of…a private detective."
He steeled himself, looking her square in the face. "John is my best friend, and my flat mate. Nothing else."
Rose raised her eyebrows. "A specific one? You're never specific."
"Yes, it will do the same thing."
"Wait—Sherlock!" Rose cried. "Stop!"
After three more rings he sighed, accepting the fact that his brother had not answered. He leaned his head back against the wall. The handcuffs around his wrists rubbed against his skin sharply, and he felt a trickle of blood run down his palm.
"John is quite adequate in that department."
John shrugged. "I've always thought you were a bit weird. If anything, this explains a lot. The sleeping habits, your messed up sense of time, the secretiveness, weird experiments on my table, shooting holes in the wall—"
Sherlock was looking over John's shoulder, but if he hadn't known any better he would have thought he was staring right at his face. "They're aliens, John."
He groaned. "Mum, pirates don't take their mothers with them to look for treasure."
"Why TARDIS?" Rose called. "Why not Daddy?"
"It was useless information, I deleted it," he called without turning to look at her.
He wasn't paying attention, he'd already spun around and took off into the trees.
"Sherlock," he said in a stern voice, "what am I right now?"
Sherlock looked away from him. "You said I was your friend. I don't have friends."
"Don't rush him," the Doctor said. "There's a lot of options."
"Hold your lids in your fingers so they don't slip, and blink one at a time. Carefully."
"I don't know. He didn't say. Wouldn't leave a name, either. Rather handsome," she said thoughtfully. "He left his number on the mantle. Perhaps he'll drop by again. I'm sure he will, if it was anything important."
They were quiet again for a minute, then the Doctor looked back at him. "Wait, what do you mean harder to hold?"
"Mum, do you want to fish?"
Rose looked at him in surprise. "You're kidding right? Sherlock knows every knot to be found on a boat."
"Why?"
"Oh. Yes, that could be something."
"Then what are you doing? Turn around so I can see your face."
John blinked. "Um, January."
Sherlock wasn't paying attention. He stared down the street in the direction the man had been running, frowning slightly. "Why run that way?"
John nodded sadly, the news was never very good, but at least it wasn't terrible. "I won't be long today. Mary is making roast tonight, I've got to get home for that."
She didn't turn around.
Mycroft held his eyes closed, breathing shakily into the phone on the fourth ring.
chasing after Sherlock.
"We knew you used. At least a few times before now, we knew you experimented with drugs, and we didn't do anything because we thought you were smart enough to realize how dangerous it was. It's my fault, I thought you were just trying to explore things, I thought it was a fluke. Baby, I never thought you'd get addicted."
"No," Sherlock said quickly, "you'd be of no use and some liability."
"That leads to a business district, but the police are the not far other way. He couldn't live in that direction, it leads to some very upscale houses."
Sherlock turned to find his mother smashing into the Weeping Angel's head with a large hammer. She wasn't looking at either of them, her eyes were trained on the other angel, but she was speaking to him. "I swear, Sherlock," she yelled, "if you ever put yourself in harm's way just because you're bored I will personally take this hammer to your head. Are we clear?"
"Yeah."
Mycroft sighed, crossing over and looking down at the small boy. For just a moment he saw something melt on the man's face, and Mycroft reached down to fix the boy's hair. "The Sontaran affair?"
She smiled. "Not quite. I'm about fifty."
"I hadn't gotten around to that part yet," Sherlock said, shooting his father a look.
John Watson had never been a very vain man. He knew his limits, his flaws, and his good qualities as well. He knew who he was yesterday. Today he realized he had always been completely wrong.
"Where are you going?" he cried out, still trying to get free.
The TARDIS rocked violently to the side and John grabbed Sherlock's arm for support. Rose hopped away to the doors, peeking out of the box.
The boy clutched the picture, looking wildly around the room. He set it back on the dresser and ran out towards the kitchen, staring intently at the eyeballs in jars. "Are these mine, John?"
Sherlock nodded. "What are you doing here? Did you come to camp with us?"
"What are they?" Mycroft asked as Redbeard shrank back nervously next to him.
"The mostly safe parts," the Doctor insisted. "We kept you out of danger."
"Don't mind me," Rose smiled from the kitchen. "I'm just making my own birthday cake, as usual."
“Fifty-seven,” she replied with a glare, “but I do my best.”
"I'm not tired," he yawned again.
Sherlock peered closer at the body, and John could see the gears whirring in his mind. There were the sounds of footprints behind him and he realized the Doctor and Rose had finally caught up with them. The detective pulled a thin piece of paper from the deceased man's front jacket pocket, then jumped up to meet his parents.
Sherlock groaned. "Must we?"
The Doctor nodded warmly as John shook his head. "I haven't…we haven't really talked to anyone. I'm afraid I'd louse it up."
She stopped in her tracks, pulling the little device from her pocket and ducking into an alley so no one would see her. "Only the boys have this number," she reminded him, checking the device.
"Let's leave the picnic stuff," the Doctor said, picking up the rest of the food. "We can have breakfast tomorrow morning."
Sherlock crossed his arms, leaning back into the cushions. "Then John is my friend, not yours! Don't yell at him!"
Sherlock scoffed. "Wrong."
The Doctor sighed, helping the baby stack a few blocks. Mycroft knocked them down and giggled in the way babies do when they think they've done something incredible. The Doctor smiled. "Fine, he's a bit too young. Just you wait though, it won't be long."
"How am I supposed to know that?" Watson asked, a bit embarrassed as he unbuckled the strap. "I'm still having trouble believing you were ever a child in the first place."
"It makes sense for us to be alike," Sherlock admitted suddenly. "We're the same species."
Sherlock knew more about the device and how to use it than he father gave him credit for. More specifically, he knew if he could get a sample on the end of it then the device could guide him to more of the same sample. It was a feature the Doctor had installed only a few years before so that they always had clean water when traveling; just drop a bit of moisture onto the end and it would guide them to more.
"We just hiked up here, and roasting is done at night."
Molly nodded, patting John on the shoulder as she headed out the door. "I think he does know that. See you tomorrow, Dr. Watson."
She nodded, pulling the vacuum cord back. "Go anywhere interesting?"
"Year 2013, age forty-four."
"Oh," John said with a hint of a smile. "Sure. Put a tie on the doorknob next time."
"Yes, that's enough, you have my attention," Sherlock said, helping the man to his feet. "Lead the way! Come along, John."
"I think it's brilliant, he told him quickly. "Everything. The TARDIS, your parents, all of it. I don't know why you hid this from me."
"Mum, why is there a hole in this tile?" he called, giving up.
John patted his back a bit awkwardly. After a long moment, Sherlock pulled away, looking just as surprised as John.
"It's Sunday," the man said with a raised eyebrow. "I specifically set the TARDIS for Sunday. It went against my better reason, really. I figured you might be free by the end of a weekend, but I usually hate landing on Sundays. Sundays are boring."
“I’m someone who doesn't like guns, even when their not pointed towards my family. I will not attack you, but if you do not get those guns away from my children in five seconds you’ll find out exactly how much I don’t like them.” This seemed to give the men pause, and their eyes darted to Sherlock and each other. Finally they nodded and set the guns on the ground. The Doctor lowered the screwdriver and nodded. “Who are you?”
“Who are you?” The Doctor asked.
Rose shot him a warning look. Mrs. Hudson clicked her tongue. "In one of his moods again?" She turned and noticed who else had walked out of the box. "John! You know now, then? That's wonderful, I'm so sick of pretending I haven't met Sherlock's family."
"I need John for more than just moral support, you know. He is an Army Doctor," his voice went down to a whisper, "and I imagine he would be better than any of the quacks from the eighteen hundreds. He has a more modernized education. We're going to try to establish a time of death ourselves, but it's possible that knowing when he left work could save a lot of time. If we miss each other we can just meet up at 221 B Baker Street. It won't belong to us for a century, but at least we know how to find it."
"Of course," she said quickly, trying to think quickly. She was getting quicker with these questions. Do pirates eat vegetables? Do pirates sleep with a stuffed animal? She had to think quickly or he'd outsmart her. "They have to camp when they bury their treasure."
"I get it, really," Sherlock insisted, still not looking at him. "The TARDIS, my parents, me, it all seems a bit more real once you've been put in danger. You should be allowed to think about things for a while. I can give you as much time as you need."
"Appreciate what? I don't understand."
No. No this was different. Even if he believed his friend would go to such lengths to dupe him, he trusted Rose and the Doctor. They knew things about Sherlock, things it had taken him years to understand. They were definitely his parents, and he didn't think they would lie.
"You two go ahead and order us a couple," Rose called, grabbing Sherlock's arm. "Sherlock will pick up some appropriate money in the currency room, and I'll have to wear something a little more appropriate to the time. We'll meet you there."
Mycroft snickered while the Doctor stared at the water. There was a snorting sound from Rose that quickly turned into an innocent cough. "Uh, okay, that's my fault," he said casually, wading into the lake and searching for the pole. "I should have asked you to just put the string in the water."
"I prefer that we don't go camping. We have both a house and an entire dimension compressed into the space of a police box. It makes no sense to go sleep outside on the ground."
John winced. He couldn't exactly explain to the little boy that this was actually be his experiment one day. "Actually, the science stuff is not mine. It belongs to my roommate."
"Am I a freak, Mummy?"
"My eyes," John said, his voice thick with concentration. "I need to blink."
"Okay, everyone hold on," John said, holding up his hands. "This telephone box—"
John nodded, not really paying attention to her. He was watching Sherlock's huddled form on the chair. "It's been a long Sunday, Mrs. Hudson. Would you mind coming back later? I think we'll both probably turn in early."
Years later, sitting in his flat in Baker Street, he will remember that time and stare at John Watson as he sleeps in his chair in front of the fireplace. He will know that he will never be tied to that chair again. Someday, something entirely different will tether him into place and remind him to keep himself alive. Not all ties were binding.
"What?"
He waved as Sherlock walked in with his mother, glad to see a familiar face. There was something strange in Sherlock's expression when he first looked at him, but it quickly dissolved into his normal look of mild boredom.
"Well," Sherlock shrugged, "if you believe one of my 'Uncles' is really dead, but he never does seem to stay that way. The Master supposedly died when I was ten. Theoretically, yes, we're all that's left. But if you do happen to see anyone with a fob watch and a big ego, let us know."
"The TARDIS!" the Doctor called from the doorway, making him jump. "It stands for Time and Relative Dimension in Space. Sorry to interrupt, we didn't hear fighting anymore so we thought we'd make sure you hadn't killed each other."
"Of course his neck is broken, a child could see that," Sherlock said, prodding the man from the pub. "But if that was all, then you wouldn't have run around looking for a constable, you would have called for one. You knew it was murder, and we know it's murder. Go ahead John, say it. What does it really look like?"
"That's because time, believe it or not, doesn't really matter that much. It's not how long a life lasts that's important, it's what you do with it. Yes, people do get old. You will get old one day, a very, very long time from now, but when you do you'll have a whole life to look back on, and you'll be happy about that. You've seen more in six years than most people see in their whole lives. You're going to do great things, Sherlock Holmes."
"Dear brother, if you're not too busy planning your next meal or bugging the residencies of Britain's finest, please do me a favor. On Sunday, January 12th of 2013, please call your mother. Inform her to turn around and go back the way she came as quickly as possible. A mistake has been made, and it could cost John his life. Go back, find the river, find the house, bring a hammer. Give my best to Her Majesty; Sherlock Holmes."
"Busy enough," he nodded, pulling a stethoscope from his pocket. "We won't tell Mum that you're still on nicotine patches. She'll be happy to hear you've quit smoking, though."
"John is…fascinating. He tolerates my friendship and sometimes my company. But obviously that's all there can ever be."
"Steady. No signs of consciousness."
"You never run into trouble, then?"
She kept her eyes closed as the door opened and closed, and then she felt the other side of the bed depress as warm arms wrapped around her from behind.
"Yes I do."
Sherlock nodded, jumping from the couch and racing to the kitchen.
The Doctor nodded, but John saw a bit of disappointment on his face. He smiled at Rose. "Okay. Just a quick Sunday tea with family, then."
Sherlock blinked, looking at him in confusion. "Our flat, obviously. I can go anywhere, at any time. My parents have a mobile, I could call them and ask for a ride. I don't technically belong to any time period. I've hopped around a bit. Lately I prefer the early 21st century."
Sherlock settled into the calm determination that would one day make him an excellent detective, but as a six year old that determination had a time limit of about twenty minutes. He was soon fidgeting anxiously, his shuffling bare feet knocking mud into the lake.
"Sherlock… he's something else. He's a good friend, most of the time."
"You're scaring away the fish," Mycroft moaned.
"Mum?" Sherlock asked from the doorway.
He had to. He knew he shouldn't but he had to. John turned around.
"Daddy?" John heard as the box became transparent. "Did you know Mycroft's going to be bald? Can I tell him?"
She smiled back at him, but continued the story. "We traveled around a bit, but I had an accident with the time vortex. It was necessary, saved a lot of lives, but it almost killed me. The Doctor saved me, but it left me a bit less than human. I don't age very fast. We didn't even notice at first. We fell in love, and we kept traveling. We went all over the universe, just exploring, for years afterwards. We saw an impossible asteroid, a diamond planet, parties and people and food like you've never imagined."
"No, I have no idea who's to blame," the man stuttered, peering at Sherlock strangely. "I've just found the man, not two streets from here. His neck…oh, Lord, it's twisted around. In fact I have no idea how someone would have gotten away with such a crime in the middle of the street. No one saw anything, there were no screams—"
John frowned. "My hotel?"
"I was hoping to talk to you, but if you'd rather stay locked away in your mind palace—"
"Well, okay, bad example. I just mean…I could mess up something, right? Time is an unbalanced line, the paradoxes—"
Unbeknownst to Sherlock, Rose stood only a room away. The Doctor held her, petting her hair. This would be the hardest few days they had ever spent on the TARDIS. They would not travel. The Doctor would never budge the box, and Rose would not ask him to. They would bring him his water, some food, a blanket when the sweating turned into shivering, but for the most part he was to be alone.
"Alive," another voice broke through in the wake of the last. "I promise…he's alive…"
"Nope," the Doctor said with a pop of his lips. "Literally his parents. We look good, eh?"
He didn't answer, but Mrs. Hudson was quickly distracted by the other three coming through the door.
Most of what they really needed was kept on the ship, but they decorated it with enough creature comforts to make it pass for a home. The only rooms with extensive decorating were the boys' rooms. Mycroft was thirteen now, and he had been redecorating recently. He hadn't painted over the trees, though. Mycroft loved the look of a forest, and the whole family had painted a mural of trees in his room.
John frowned, setting down his paper. "Now? I need some warning ahead of time, Sherlock. What am I supposed to do?"
Breakbreakbreakbreakbreakbreakbreakbreakbreakbreakbreak
"It's really not so bad, you know?" Rose promised.
They were silent for a long moment, both just staring at the angels over each other's shoulders. Despite the situation, Sherlock heard John chuckle once. "You can let me go now, Mate."
In less than a mile they arrived at a bare clearing on the ground. For about thirty feet all around there were no trees or grass or too many lumps. Right in the center of the circle was a small fire pit, obviously long since abandoned.
"He already gets both of us running anytime he cries, why would he bother to learn our names?"
"So," she said quietly, "just how many times have you been here before?"
"Like I said, you were late." Sherlock hopped from the couch, peering out the window as if he expected to see something staring back at him. He pulled his wallet from the table and pushed a few dozen pound notes into John's hands. "Go get drunk. On me. Have fun."
"You did. You chose the last name he chose because you wanted to be like him."
The Doctor clapped him on the back of the shoulder, pointing out toward a pub sign swinging in the light wind. "Let's go get that pint you wanted."
John was overwhelmed. He walked back to the consul, leaning against the railing for a moment as Sherlock closed the doors.
John knocked quietly on the door, catching the attention of the nurse taking the patients vital signs. "Afternoon, Molly," he said cheerfully.
"Well, that's all over now, isn't it? John knows, so you don't need to worry about me acting human."
"Hello," John said, stepping forward to grab the man's hand for a brief moment. "How've you been, Doctor?"
"Home!" the Doctor said jovially, flopping down into one of the old flight seats on a bench. "For the last several centuries, at least."
"That star," Sherlock said, pointing up at the ceiling. It's too far to the left."
Sherlock yawned. "Not really Mummy, it's an alternate dimension compressed by the form of a doorway, in this case a bag, that—"
Sherlock was standing up on a chair, peering down at the assorted chemicals. Apparently the lack of respect for furniture was a longstanding trait. He picked up a set of charts, staring at them with a wide grin. "Oh, I get it!" he cried. "These are liquefied human eyeballs. You want to see how they settle in the jars, right?"
"I think it'd be the perfect place for a Honeymoon, too," Rose said biting her lip a bit. "What's say next week the boys stay with Grandma?"
"This time he says I stole a pie."
"I…I put you in jeopardy. I'm sorry, John, If you want to go home I'll get you there immediately. I could…I could let you have some time."
"Talk about what?" he asked.
"Upstairs."
Sherlock looked around, quickly realizing where he was. "The TARDIS? How did I get into the TARDIS?"
Sherlock huffed, whirling around and giving John a tight hug. John hugged him back, albeit quite awkwardly, and the boy walked sluggishly into the TARDIS. "Bye, John! I'll see you again really soon. We're going to have fun when I'm big, right?"
"A very thin business card. A sweep isn't likely to need to store his money, he must have ducked into the building to get out of the rain and grabbed a card so he could roll tobacco with it later."
Sherlock tilted his head a bit in confusion, but he saw a ghost of a smile on the boy's face. Suddenly the quiet demeanor seemed to vanish from him. "Are you a scientist too, John?"
Sherlock Holmes sat in his flat, all alone, staring at the same case file. It was a simple one, or at least it looked simple, but it seemed like it had taken forever for him to crack it. The windows of 221B Baker Street were drawn shut, and no light filtered through the dusty air. The power was out. Why was the power out? He could not remember. He would have to speak to Mrs. Hudson about that.
"I don't know what you're talking about."
John sighed. "Sherlock… You didn't… can we get home please? Both of us?"
"Here?" John asked.
"Is it safe?" John asked.
"You could still be my best friend. Just wake up," John said, looking at the door.
"Sorry, I think we'll have to cut this short tonight. We should be able to get through one story, if we hurry," John said rummaging in his bag for a book.
"Why?"
"Sherlock," John scoffed, "this is hardly the time to get a description of the killer. We have to get these people out of here—"
He was almost certain that the device would give him concrete proof of Mycroft's guilt, but when he ran and held it up to his brother's door it didn't so much as beep once. Crushed, he stalked back into the kitchen. Just as he started to think that the Sonic could not track anything but liquid, he heard it beep only inches away from the back door.
"John. Look directly behind me and stand up, right now. Do not turn around."
The man frowned. "My brother, of course."
"A real doctor, or a doctor like my Dad?"
Dr. Watson called for help, getting to work immediately to resuscitate the man. One of the stupid medical students had managed to trip over the cords on his way in, ripping the IV straight out of the patient's arm. The intern, Richard Brook, had been thrown out of his program the next day.
"Sherlock is amazing. Brilliant," John nodded. He ventured a bold question. "How long have you known him?"
If the whole thing wasn't so strange, and he was little less angry, John would have laughed. The box couldn't have been more than a yard wide on any side, and maybe seven foot tall, but Sherlock Holmes was hiding in it. Was this Sherlock's new way of avoiding socialization? The 'you-can't-see-me, I'm invisible' approach?
"John…the game, John…"
"Stay close to John, so what he says, don't set anything on fire," the Doctor said, patting Sherlock on the head as he hopped back into the TARDIS.
The boy jumped off of the sofa racing towards the bedroom.
"Stay there!" Sherlock called, "We don't want to be ambushed by the killed. Watch the front door!"
"No, it's merely improbable," Sherlock said. "Yes, it's impossible to fit something big into something small, but it's not impossible to put a doorway into something big on something small. Scientifically it actually is all fairly simple to understand—"
No room on a TARDIS could technically be called 'baby-proof'. It was an organically grown mess of wires and consciousness, used as a weapon, a vessel, and lately as a home. Still, the two new parents had tried their best to make a safe living area. The TARDIS had infinite rooms anyway, it was just a small matter of arranging a cozy little living room and kitchen together and placing them near the consul room.
"I can, I will. Or would you rather it be Mycroft?"
"I'm eight, of course I like sugar. What else?"
John sighed, standing up. "I think I will go get that pint now. Excuse me."
"Humans have fish when they camp, I read a book."
"Yes, Ma'am," John said. He felt a bit strange, addressing someone so young like that, but there was just something about the woman that commanded respect.
"How long?"
Sherlock pushed open the door. Nothing looked right. Where there should be columns and gratings there were gleaming metal plates of orange and blue. He knew, theoretically, that the TARDIS desktop could change, but he'd never seen it done. He walked up the stairs, examining the new consul.
The man in the suit scoffed, taking John's hand. "Don't be silly, Sherlock. Mycroft told us about the swimming pool last year, your whole ordeal with Moriarty. I don't think 'John Smith' will be necessary. Call me The Doctor."
The man holding the phone to his ear let out a small giggle that did not fit his face. "What's wrong, Mr. Holmes? Has your brother decided not to answer your call? Then who will come and rescue you?"
"So, that one," he asked pointing, "that's your flat-mate's room?"
John smiled. "Yeah. Let's go."
"That's cheating."
"Come on," he coaxed gently, pulling her slowly from the room.
The Doctor leaned over for a kiss, but just then Sherlock arrived gasping for breath at the edge of the blanket. "I caught one!" he said, holding out his closed hands.
"We can check it out tonight, but I'm telling you if there's a Shifter or something here it's well hidden…"

Sherlock heard the slap before he felt it. A hand came across the side of his face, hard enough to whip his head to the side. It wasn't the memory of his mother, she was sitting calmly beside him. It didn't happen in the Mind Palace—that meant it had to be happening in the real world. Someone had slapped his real face.
Sherlock crossed his arms and thought a moment. "There's a hole in the dining room floor."
Each day as they lived in the house he made an internal oath to himself and his family, and that was this; that at the end of his life, however many centuries away that may be, he would write a list. On that list he would write the names and space-time coordinates of every person in the universe whom he could turn to with his children in an emergency. Finally, he would use the future version of the TARDIS to travel back to this specific week and find the old version of the TARDIS. He would place the list into the small, empty compartment, all while making no contact with his previous self or the past versions of his family.
"Oh, come on John, look at him. Tattered clothes, covered in grime, he doesn't work at a Savings and Loan. See, in his hair," he said, running his hand lightly over the top of the man's head, "chimney soot. He's a chimney sweep, that's half a step above homeless by eighteen hundreds standards. I just wanted to get rid of him."
"Was your Uncle nice?"
"Sherlock," Rose chastised gently from where she was leaning against the consul, "you know better than that."
The man laid there, unmoving. John sighed, trying to find the story they'd stopped at last time. Two years now—that was how long it had been since Mr. Holmes had spoken. He used to mutter in his constant sleep, just a few sentences or phrases here and there, but it was enough to give them all hope for him. About two years ago, while John was in the room reading him a book of fairy tales, he'd heard what could be the man's last sentence.
"You've been up for days, silly."
Sherlock nodded.
"He has to have taken the pie, Dad. Mom didn't eat and I didn't eat it and you didn't know about it, so it had to be him."
"Sherlock," Rose warned, grabbing his sleeve. "I thought we were going to have a quick, fun trip."
"Why do things have to change, though?" he asked, a bit more quietly. "Why can't things stay the same forever?"
John shot him a look. "Boring? Are you insane?"
"What're we doing now?" Sherlock yawned again, gripping the little bag of water with Nemo in it.
"And now what?"
"Will you leave if I fall asleep? I don't want you to go."
John had to smile with her. Rose's eyes were unfocused, and he saw her reliving every moment as she spoke of them.
The Doctor gently poured a few drops of water on Sherlock’s hand, and Rose gasped behind them. “It really is water, Rose,” he called reassuringly over his shoulder.
Two men sat on the floor, on of them still chewing on the remnants of the banana cream pie. The froze when they saw Sherlock.
The house itself was a special project, in some ways very old and in others quite new. The Doctor designed it himself, reinforcing it with metals from other worlds that would keep it standing for thousands of years, and then had it built for them in the fifteen hundreds on a huge plot of property they had purchased. No one was allowed on the land, but just to be sure he had put a perception filter on all ten acres. People driving nearby didn't even notice the heavily wooded area next to the road, let alone the little house nestled in the center of it. That house was guaranteed to be untouched and still standing no matter when in time they landed. Once they arrived they would flip the sign held on the front of the door from empty to occupied; that way they never had to worry about bumping into future or past versions of themselves. If it was occupied today, they'd just pop ahead a few weeks until it was empty.
"I'm not playing, I'm investigating. I'll just take a scan real quick and bring it back so you can tell me what it says. Mum's in there, she can watch me."
“It’s okay, Sherlock,” he whispered. “Weeping Angels are all quantum locked and this man is not, so we are not in danger. I believe his species is separate from them, you can blink. Thank you for trying to keep us all safe.”
"I understand that we need to have a discussion."
Sherlock sighed. "Do I really have to spell this out? There hasn't been any proper rain, John, but his shoes are caked in mud. Fresh mud. I thought rain would explain it, but there hasn't been any. Our chimney sweep just ran through a river bed then—not many of those nearby. I'd venture to say we start in the direction his footprints are leading and keep walking, his mud can't be more than a few minutes away. He was running, but he hadn't gone far."
The Doctor shrugged. "Fine, your way then. Mike, say 'Mummy'. Mu-mmy."
The Doctor closed the door behind John, turning back to smile as Sherlock. "Bit warm in here, eh?" he asked.
"The Adventure of The Empty House, there's a good one. It was in the spring of the year 1894 that all London was interested, and the fashionable world dismayed, by the murder of the Honorable Ronald Adair under most unusual and inexplicable circumstances..." John said from his chair, looking at the invisible book."
"Oh," John said, a bit surprised. "Yes. I've met them."
"We might," John said. Sherlock could see him shaking, nearly imperceptibly. "We meet up at the flat in Baker Street, okay? If you're sent to, like, 1780 and I'm sent to 1800, I still expect to see you standing there, waiting for me in Baker Street as soon as I arrive. Understand?"
"By Cardiff?" he asked, raising an eyebrow. The mask fell and he grinned. "Yes. I loved you by the time we danced."
The Doctor stared at John in amazement. "Wow. Do you have any idea how fast he usually jumps in the TARDIS when I come to pick him up? He's doesn't like to be anywhere without Rose. Who are you?"
Sherlock twisted his mouth. Rose laughed; only recently Sherlock seemed to have realized it wasn't nice to tell his mother she was too stupid to be as much help as the other people in the house.
Mrs. Hudson held up her hands and shook her head, quickly heading downstairs as Rose laughed.
"Not always," Mycroft sighed, resigned to his fate. "Not when their following treasure maps."
"Don't talk to me like I'm a child."
The lights all shifted again, but not in unison this time. The colors of the rainbow split around them, and all four sat on the blanket as the lights grew incredibly bright, and then began to dim. The bugs went higher than they had, and suddenly they were all a shimmering gold that started to fade.
John frowned at him, realizing it was too late to call the couple back from their wild goose chase. "He had the business card in his pocket though."
Sherlock stared back and his eyes watered a bit, but Rose was over before he could say another word, "That's what some people do, but I think we can agree that Nemo is a special fish that will not be eaten right?" she said, trying not to actually touch the wiggling thing.
"You were quite the crier too, you know," Rose said, smoothing out his hair. "Say, I think I hear Daddy calling for some help. Will you run to the TARDIS and help him find the camera?"
"A real one," he smiled.
They were in a long, extended bedroom, with all of the furnishings torn from it. Along the walls on every side sat dozens of cages, and inside most of those cages sat humans. They wore rags, with dirt and grime covering their faces. Most of them were unconscious, but one or two were thrashing about desperately, calling to the two men for help.
“That piece of paper is blank,” a low voice said suddenly, between them. There was a tall man standing where he hadn’t been a moment ago, directly in front of the Winchesters. His long overcoat swayed slightly in the breeze as he fixed the Doctor with a confused stare.
Sherlock gulped, the question taking him completely off guard. "Each Angel sends someone to a different year. It's doubtful that I would ever see you again."
"I always knew. I always knew you'd fall in love," she said, brushing the hair from his face. "You can be happy with him, he'll be so good for you—"
"John…" he started, trying to make each last, precious second count. "There's something I should say…something I've always meant to say, but I never have."
"You could change it. He's young enough not to notice."
"Absolutely," he called after him.
"You didn't answer me," she said, starting to grin again. "You're in love with him, aren't you?"
"Well, learn. I understand that your instincts may tell you that your first body is disposable, but it's not in your case. You said John has been making you eat?"
John furrowed his brow. "We're not changing the subject. This is important."
Rose took John's hand and sat him down on the bench. "It's a bit much. He's not prone to fainting, is he?"
