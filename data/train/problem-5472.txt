“I… uh…Yes, yes,” Cas stuttered, still not understanding the situation.
Dean made a point of waking very early, earlier than Cas usually woke up, to not see him in the kitchen for breakfast. He spent the morning in the garage, working on Baby, hoping it would calm him down and that Cas wouldn’t come looking for him there.
“Wait,” Cas interrupted him. “So that was a date?”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas answered, surprised to see him there. He waited for Dean to explain why he had come, but the guy just kept staring at him. After a moment, Cas cleared his throat and decided to ask him.
Dean made three steps in his direction, looking at the cooking book Cas was reading, now half covered in dough.
Balthazar was still looking at him, apparently waiting for an answer, but Cas didn’t know how to respond. He knew that he and Dean were two very different people, that they didn’t belong together, and weren’t looking for the same kind of relationship. Still, it hurt to hear it from Balthazar, a neutral source who didn’t really know about his crush on Dean, and therefore was not trying to hide things from Cas to make him happy.
Cas frowned. The voice seemed very far, but close at the same time, and it definitely wasn’t Balthazar’s. Was he imagining it?
After a quick trip to his room to grab some clean clothes, he headed to the bathroom, feeling lighter now that he had decided to do something about the situation. The bunker was quiet, Sam and Cas were often in the library this time of day (well, when Cas wasn't with Dean).
“Hey, I was being serious, don’t make fun of me!” Dean pretended to protest. “You’re lucky I’m willing to help you through this process. Do you have anything planned tonight?”
“You wouldn’t even kiss him?”
Cas nodded. “I think so. But, Sam, if there are words to describe these feelings - or that lack of feelings - does that mean that I am not the only one?”
Cas opened the door, but stayed in the corridor, looking ill-at-ease and uncertain.
“I’m sure you will, don’t worry. Unlike me, you have experience in terms of scavenger hunts!”
“Of course,” Cas agreed.
“Um… I’m meeting Dean to watch the varsity basketball game tomorrow evening. Do you know what kind of clothes I should wear?”
Dean laughed. “You can do it yourself, you know? It won’t be the first new thing you’ve tried lately.”
The slides appeared on the board.
“My supporter’s pack,” Dean grinned, proudly holding a bag. He took out a blue KU cap that he put on his head, and then a scarf he carelessly wrapped around his neck.
“Yeah, well, don’t count on that too much. I’m not planning on turning into a party boy this year. I have to get top grades if I want to get into med school after my undergrad.”
“Okay, so maybe we could use that time to start working on our next math assignment? The TA said we could work in pairs.”
“Too bad.” Dean took a step closer to him and leaned in the direction of his left ear. “Because I really like your style tonight. That tie matches your eyes. You look very hot like this, Cas,” he whispered.
“So, yes, that’s all I wanted to say, basically. I am very anxious, and I hesitated a lot before agreeing to share my experience today, but I’m glad I did,” Cas smiled. “Even if I got a little bit carried away… I didn’t plan to mention that guy I’m in love with for example, but… I think I heard that we are in a safe place, and that nothing that is being said here will leave this room, so…”
Cas had been participating at quite a few meetings, and he was beginning to know all the usual participants. They weren’t really his friends, because he wasn’t meeting them outside of the LGBT+ society (except for Charlie), but he felt safe around them. Besides, he had been wanting to share his feelings for a while, without really daring to do so. He loved Balthazar, and Meg a lot, but he felt that they wouldn’t truly understand him if he talked to them about Dean and his asexuality. And he needed to talk about it: he had been accumulating his thoughts for months, and he was beginning to feel as if he would explode and do something stupid at any time. And it was probably better if that emotional outburst happened in a safe place, designed for it, where he could be listened to and feel understood. Charlie had been a little bit surprised at first, but then very happy that Cas had finally agreed to talk about his experience.
“That’s fine, kiddo, your team was winning anyway!” said Dean, joining them after the last parents left.
“Well, we have our own game to organize tomorrow, so maybe it would be better if we had a quiet night…”
Cas was looking at him, his eyes very blue, a shade of concern on his face, when really, Dean should have been the one worried about Cas. Cas was the more one vulnerable, now.
“You okay? You’ve seemed a little bit off this week,” Dean asked him, pausing the TV.
“What’s your name?” a girl with blue hair asked.
He arrived at some random bar. The place didn’t matter, as long as they had alcohol.
“Of course, I'll look at it right now,” Cas replied, fondly.
Dean winced, thinking about Tom. Tom didn’t seem to be a bad guy, but Dean was almost sure he would have found the words to convince Cas to sleep with him, even though it hadn’t been Cas' intentions. Good thing Dean talked to Cas before Tom had the time to plan a date.
Cas was a little bit taken aback by the question. It was a Saturday evening. Of course he didn’t have anything planned. The question was more why didn’t Dean have anything planned?
“I love burgers!”
“Oh, yeah, I understand. Good point.”
Their presentation was pretty good, Cas supposed, as he was trying really hard to stay focused on the slide show instead of thinking about the moment where he would have to talk. It was nothing, he forced himself to keep in mind, the other students do it all the time. Besides, he knew them and trusted them; there were only 11 students present that day, himself included. It wasn’t as if he had to perform a speech in front of hundreds of strangers. He could do it. He had planned it, he knew what he would say. Everything would be fine. He had already accomplished so much over the last few months, learning to open himself up despite his anxiety. It was nothing more than an extra step. A very small extra step. He had already done the hardest part by joining the society, by getting to know the other students over the weeks as he attended the weekly meetings.
They fall into a rhythm quickly, cohabiting like two planets orbiting the same star, and Castiel can’t decide what he likes better: delving into all this theory and codework, or watching how excited and intense Dean gets throughout the process. Dean moves his paperwork to the kitchen table, spending his time pacing back and forth with the end of his pen between his teeth, or hunched over the table while he scribbles notes.
They end up being more than a little late (and a bit rumpled) for their dinner, but when the King and Queen see the wideness of their smiles and the way that they just can't keep their hands off each other...
There’s a woman standing at the bow of the boat, red hair and red cloak billowing in the wind as she holds a large pendant up to the sky. A few feet to their left, there’s another guard, clearly surprised by their appearance. After hearing their boat explode, he must have thought that they hadn’t survived—it must be a nasty surprise to find out that they’re still alive.
And honestly, what he has now is pretty fucking good.
The rest of Dean’s come stripes against Castiel’s lips and cheek, and he blinks in shock, reflexively swallowing his mouthful.
And then, one afternoon, when he’s finished all his other projects and is looking for something new to do…
“Yes,” he says, his voice breathy and thick with emotion. “Yes, Dean. I will.”

Cas pulls the plug out slowly, relishing in the stretch of Dean’s hole, until the widest part of it is free and the rest slides out easily. He tosses it aside onto the mattress, and then his thumb is tugging gently at Dean’s rim, and Dean groans.
Edenish, but in such a strange, plain way that it’s truly hard to tell. If it was someone from Eden’s camp, they’d be dressed in a soldier’s garb, or something more recognisably Edenish, but this…
Castiel watches his coffin disappear beneath the earth, spadeful by spadeful until it’s completely covered, and again, he wonders what will happen next. It’s not long before his family departs, and Castiel is left alone, still standing by his own grave, waiting.
He sets his bag down on his chair, then logs onto his computer and checks his emails. Three unread—two of them don’t need to be responded to urgently, but the last one makes him pause.

to help.”
"How we lookin', Sam?" he calls over his shoulder, back towards the car.
Castiel pauses by the window, looks over his shoulder at Dean. He looks so at ease in Castiel’s kitchen, barefoot and leaning one hip against the counter while he sips his coffee, that he can’t help but smile. “Is it? It’s just all the things I like, I suppose. I like to feel comfortable in my space.” He glances up at the Devil’s Ivy that’s hanging by the window frame. “Why, what’s your home like?”
It’s not for another week, though, as Dean reminds Castiel on his way out.
Today's been pretty fucking awesome.
, that Castiel has seen him all night. He’s broken, yes, but there’s so much beauty in his brokenness that it takes Castiel’s breath away.
“Pretty nice, isn’t it?”
Castiel stands at the edge of the ocean and looks out over the waves.
“You cannot be judged,” he says, “for you have much left to prove—to yourself, to the world, and to the worlds beyond yours. That is why you are special, Dean Winchester. And that is why I have an offer for you.”
He knows he should regret his choices. Signing his heart, mind and body over to the Union, donning the blue uniform, and taking a musket in his hands. Marching south with his fellow soldiers to fight the Confederacy.
“I know.”
“I’ve been better,” Castiel replies quietly—there’s a hint of sarcasm to his tone, because who the hell asks that kind of question to someone who’s just
“My name… I have had many names. Many titles. But the one I was given from the very beginning…” He exhales, then opens his eyes, and for the first time, there’s the hint of a smile pulling at the corner of his mouth.
He grits his teeth. It’s not selfish to want to be successful. He’s worked so hard to get here, and now that he’s finally achieved his dreams, he shouldn’t be told to step it back. People want more.
Dean is totally happy watching people fuck up watermelon carvings and horrifyingly complex cakes, and leaving Cas to keep plugging away at the research. From the way Cas snorts at some of the jokes and makes quietly horrified sounds when the creations are revealed, however, he is splitting his attention somewhat.
But Dean isn’t anyone else.
And so he ignores the whispers, the people who are watching him and the raven and speculating as to whether Dean will bond tonight, and focuses instead on his partner.
This has to be weird for Cas, having been here for so long, but as soon as they started to fade a few weeks ago, they knew that their time here was coming to an end. They’re both almost completely transparent now, but they can still touch, and Dean takes full advantage of that as he bumps his shoulder against Cas’s.
It’s a well-known fact that Dean will take any excuse to dress up.
wants to hear from, has been radio silent. The most recent text in his conversation with Cas still just says
He’d been expecting to catch the alpha off guard, to get the upper hand, but even as he moves, the man is already sidestepping. He knocks Dean’s knife out of the way, driving his free hand towards Dean’s ribs in a punch that would have
It takes so long to claw his way out of his own grave, but compared to the eons he’s spent in Hell, it feels like nothing.
After his confrontation with Naomi, he’d had to take some time to recharge and pull himself back together. Seeing her again had rattled him, to say the least, and so the last week has been spent laying low and letting Dean look after him.
. Exhausted down to his core, yes, but there’s something in him that hasn’t been there for a long time. It stays as he showers, washing away the sweat and dirt of his day’s labour, and it stays as he quickly cooks himself a bowl of pasta, then collapses onto the couch to eat it.
There’s a touch of slurring to his usual drawling accent, and Castiel is yet to decide if it’s endearing or concerning. The fact that Dean is asking about his night is, at least, very sweet of him. “It was quite quiet, until someone decided to pay an after-hours visit,” he points out wryly. “I’m guessing you’ve had a good night?”
The man just laughs, loud and bold and amused. “That was only the tiniest bit of power power, detective. And you
. “I just… wish there was some kind of way to let him know that I’m okay. That I’m here, and I’m with you, and I’m happy.” He snorts, soft and bitter. “Another hundred years and I might be able to communicate with him through my powers, like how you can move shit, but… I don’t have that kind of time.”
When Dean finishes his last song, the final notes dissipating into the dimness of the bar, Castiel applauds along with the rest of the crowd. Dean bows quickly, humbly, flashing his charming smile to the adoring audience, then disappears from the stage.
They stand there for another few minutes, side by side, looking out into the darkness. Dean is achingly aware of how little space is in between them—how easy it would be to reach out and take Cas’s hand, to lean over and kiss him, to carry their relationship across the line of pretend and into
“Hum… Maybe it is the opposite for me: I’d prefer to begin with the “something more”, and then, maybe sex would develop after some time. I don’t know. It’s something I can imagine doing, but not right now.”
Cas had come a long way since then. With Dean, but also in general. He had learned how to manage unplanned and emergency situations with the children at the CLCP. He had learned to manage his thoughts – up to a point. He had learned to talk to Dean without being intimidated by him – and now, he was the one getting Dean flustered! It was funny to see how the tables turned! Since then, he also dared to go to a party in a bar, to a LGBT+ society – on his own! Well, of course, he was still him, and still had his flaws, his first nature and instincts were to be anxious and afraid of everything, but lately, he had tried to go out of his comfort zone, and so far, he was pretty happy with the results. That was a good life lesson.
Dean nodded. "Good. I'm glad.”
“See you next week,” Cas repeated, watching her step out into the corridor. He had never really hid his sexual orientation, but he had never talked a lot about it, especially not to people he barely knew, like Charlie. He still couldn’t believe he had talked to her so freely about it. It was nice to open up.
“Ah, Cas, I knew I liked you. Let’s go, then!”
“Yes, it did.” Cas hesitated for a minute. Should he talk to his roommate about Dean? After all, Balthazar was Dean’s friend; maybe he could give him more information about the guy? But talking about the situation would make it real. Moreover, Balthazar would notice the crush Cas had on Dean, and he would think Cas was ridiculous for that. And the last thing Cas needed was for his childhood friend to pity him.
A warm hand rested gently on his shoulder, and Cas jumped, raising his head abruptly, banging it violently against the door.
"So, tell me, Dean, why the three shots?"
“Even if I drink tea and don’t play poker and don’t come to parties on Friday nights?”
“Is that really what you took away from what just happened? Besides, you’re exaggerating, he was not flirting with me in front of his girlfriend!”
“She isn’t?”
“That’s quite a nice present,” Cas commented.
Cas sighed. Of course. He wasn’t even surprised anymore. “Hello, Meg.”
“Well, there are a lot of different kinds of animal documentaries. And nowadays, they are probably way better than the ones from your childhood. Technology’s improved. The quality of the pictures is amazing! And I don’t find it boring, but fascinating, and relaxing. And there are a lot of fun facts to learn!”
Cas' laughter faded a little when he heard Dean saying "buddy." "Buddy" was so... friendly! Was it because he had rejected Dean's advances at the party the week before that he had become just a friend, and had lost any chance of having more than friendship with him?
Indeed, even though Balthazar and Cas weren’t great cooks, they had all the basic kitchen utensils that Dean would need. Dean decided he’d come with the ingredients, since the CLCP would pay him back for what he spent to prepare the activities – to a certain extent, of course. They agreed that Dean would arrive at 6, because the cookies needed some time in the oven to bake, and Dean would have to make three different doughs for the three different flavors they had selected.
He winked again, and clearly, Cas had never met anyone who winked that much before. He ignored Dean’s comment, not knowing what to answer.
Something else about Dean was bothering Cas: not only was Dean completely different from him, confident, social, easy-going, flirty, but he also seemed to like making sexual innuendos. Which was very very far from Cas. Even if Dean could be interested in him, he would probably expect a sexual relationship with him; that’s what guys like Dean were interested in, after all. Popular college boys who liked partying, flirting, and finding easy one-night-stands, to “have fun.” That wasn’t what Cas was looking for. At all. Sure, he wanted a boyfriend, he wanted a romantic relationship. But, unlike most of the other university students, he was not interested in any kind of sexual relationship. Therefore, he and Dean were clearly not compatible, since Dean seemed to like joking about sex – and probably not only joking.
“How do you know her?” Cas asked.
Meg almost burst out laughing. “Come on, Cas, it’s due next week, we have plenty of time!”
“Wow, wow, wow, Cas!” Dean interrupted him. “To keep me “from having sex again”? First of all, let me assure you that I’ve never even had sex yet! I don’t care about sex! It’s not something I feel the need to do, either!”
Cas shrugged. “What you don’t understand is that I don’t want to have sex with him!”
“Great,” Cas half-lied, taking off his coat and putting it on the back of his chair.
“But it’s on the right track to become official, right?” Cas gently asked.
“Indeed.”
Wow, wow, wow. Was Dean really gonna talk about Cas’ sex life with this stranger? Did Cas have a sex life? What did he tell Tom? And why was Tom telling him that, anyway? What kind of guy was discussing a common match with the guy he was trying to hit on? Was he about to suggest the three of them have a threesome, or? (No. Dean definitely shouldn’t think about that. Because images were forming in his head, and this was absolutely not the time. Not that there was an appropriate time to imagine Cas doing that, anyway.)
“By the way, Balt, is it okay if Dean comes over tomorrow? We have to bake cookies for the children in our volunteer program, and he doesn’t have a private kitchen in his dorm, and…”
“Yeah. Just tired. Tonight was a lot.”
Cas frowned, confused. He didn’t know what to answer: should he ask for more information? Maybe Dean didn’t want to talk about it, if he wasn’t elaborating. What could he say, now?
Cas had discovered his asexuality long after he figured out he was gay. He understood he preferred boys, romantically at least, pretty quickly, when he got his first crushes on classmates at school. It was easy to understand that he was different from the straight guys, since he had no interest in girls. Therefore, every time he heard schoolmates commenting on how “hot” a girl looked, he wasn’t surprised to disagree because he preferred boys. And of course he found a lot of boys aesthetically pleasing. And that was the definition of “hot,” right? He could look at some boys and find them beautiful. And surely, that was what everyone meant, when they were saying that “this actor is so hot, I would totally spend the night with him.” Surely, they were all exaggerating. They couldn’t really mean that, only because a man was good-looking, they wanted to have a sexual relationship with him.
“And, really, don’t worry about your outfit or anything, you’re at your place, you can dress however you want, that’s the whole point!”
Dean looked at his glass and took a sip of juice before answering.
Cas paused, noticing Balthazar’s frown. “What?”
Dean startled a little and ran a hand through his hair. “Oh yeah, right, sorry, I… I was just… uh…” He shook his head and resumed, more confidently this time. “Is Balthazar here? I kept his poker case in my car, last time, and I told him that I would drop it off at his – well, at your – place.”
“Dean?” Cas insisted.
A comfortable silence settled in, during which the two boys continued to stare at each other. Cas realized that when his eyes met Dean’s, his thoughts suddenly stopped racing, which didn't happen often. He felt calm, and it felt nice. When he was talking with Dean, it was different, because he had to think about what to answer, and he was afraid of saying something stupid, and felt as if nothing he could say could be as good as what Dean was saying anyway. Dean was so in control, and Cas was struggling to not disappoint him. For some reason, probably because he was just a very kind guy, Dean was taking time to talk with Cas, to say nice things to him, tease him a little. He would end up noticing that Cas wasn’t as witty as him, that he wasn’t as good at repartee as him. And he would get bored. But Cas liked talking to Dean, and he didn’t want him to think he was boring. He wanted Dean to keep talking to him.
“Yeah. Yeah, you’re good, Cas. Very good. Very appropriate.”
Cas really tried to stay professional, but he was almost sure that Dean noticed how cold and distant he was acting. If he was surprised or hurt by this behaviour, Dean didn't let it show, joking with the children they were supervising. And somehow, his indifference made Cas even more infuriated.
Cas sadly shook his head. “I’m not sure, Dean. When I told that to my coworkers…” Dean wondered how much had Cas told to his coworkers. “...They were really surprised and said that it was weird. That I was weird for not…wanting that”.
“Yeah, we’re glad you joined us,” a guy – that hadn’t been at the poker night at Balthazar and Cas’ place – said cheerfully. “I’m Garth, nice to meet you.”
“O… Okay, thanks. Same time?”
“The fact that you were at a party yesterday is definitely not a good excuse,” said Jody jokingly before Dean could say anything.
“Dean. I know that humans have sex. Want to have sex, like to have sex. You keep talking about it, yourself. And apparently, it seems that my vessel is broken or something. Maybe something happened when Metatron took my grace. Maybe graceless angels can’t experience sexual attraction, I don’t know, but I know it’s not normal, and that it’s something very important to humans. And now, I’m not an angel anymore, but I don’t feel like a real human, either.”
“So, Cas, how do you find the meetings so far?”
“No one is gonna cut off Jack’s leg, Becky,” Dean intervened. “Cas is gonna take care of Jack. Did you know he’s studying to become a doctor?”
“Isn’t it a little too easy to blame everything on the alcohol? Besides, don’t we say that alcohol disinhibits people and brings out their true nature, without any filter?”
“Sorry, I’m listening”, he assured.
Dean raised his hands as a sign of appeasement. “Hey man, I never said tea was boring! I meant that…”
…Cas might never have been in a relationship before, but he had understood the innuendo. Balthazar had already jokingly referred as his disheveled hair as “sex hair” before, and he had understood Dean’s double meaning.
“Not yet, at least. Dean’s not the kind of guy who sticks with the same girl for more than three dates, anyway. And Cassie is new. Last week, he was still hanging out with Lisa a lot…”
“Cas! You okay?”
Later that week, he noticed the same poster in different places around the university. He already knew there was a LGBT+ society at the university. They usually communicated a lot about the various events they organized during the year, but he had never felt the need to reach out to them before. He had no problem with his homosexuality, and he’d already met a few other gay students, whether in high school or in university, who he could talk to a little about it. Balthazar himself was bisexual, therefore being gay never felt like a burden he had to carry alone, without the possibility to open up to anyone. Besides, he was comfortable enough with that fact; he knew it was just a part of how he was, one of the things that defined him, and that he couldn’t change it anyway. So he didn’t really need to talk about it.
“No!”
“Ye- yes, indeed, sorry again for my outfit yesterday, this is more like how I usually dress."
Dean beamed at him. “Thanks Cas, you’re really the best,” he said with a wink, leaving them to take care of another child.
“Okay, perfect. How many cookies do you think I have to prepare?”
Cas grabbed a cookie, and somehow, it tasted even better than the day before. He took his time getting ready, in a great mood. He didn’t see Balthazar and wondered when his roommate had come home, and if he had seen that Cas fell asleep while watching something with Dean. In a way, he wanted Balt to have seen them, as if it was proof that it was real. Well, the note he carefully put in his pocket was proof that he didn’t dream it, but he wanted Balthazar to know, for some reason. And everyone else too. Because he was feeling proud: proud of being worthy of Dean’s attention, proud of himself and of everything he had accomplished over these past days. He had come a long way. He had dared to go to the first CLCP meeting. He had dared to go to the party. He had dared to go to the LGBT+ society. He had gone out of his comfort zone and he had survived, and for him, it was a big accomplishment.
“I don’t know much about cars,” Cas admitted. “But I have to say that it’s a beautiful vehicle. What model is it?”
“It’s there,” he said to Cas, pointing at a building next to an elementary school.
“The idea is to pair up students that will be in charge of a group of 8 to 10 children, for two hours. One hour of tutoring and one hour of more fun activities. You can organize yourselves in two ways. Option A, one student does the tutoring for half of the group while the other half does sports or cultural activities with the second student for an hour, and then the groups switch. Option B, you don’t divide the group, and both of the students take care of tutoring and activities. In your registration forms, you were asked whether you were more at ease with tutoring or managing the activities, and we have two lists of students…” Jody displayed the next slide. “And we will let you create your own pairs, but keep in mind that it would be better to have one student from each group in each pair.”
After two more episodes, as Cas was yawning more and more, Dean decided it was time for him to go to bed – even if Cas protested because he wanted to see if the endearing patient was going to die.
However, even though the idea of helping people, healing them, doing something good was appealing to Cas, deep down he wondered whether it was really his true personal calling. It was definitely what was expected of him by his parents, by society in general, even by himself. But was it what he truly wanted? He didn’t even know what he wanted. And questioning his plan made him uncomfortable, so he tried to bury those reflections. However, even if Cas didn’t want to pay attention to them, those worries were still there, and from time to time they invaded his thoughts so much that his stomach started to hurt, he couldn’t focus on anything else, and couldn’t ignore them. But he had the feeling that it was too late now. Too late to change his plans, especially when he didn’t know what else he could do. He had chosen all his classes to fit his project, to build a good application for med school later. He did extra readings, attended some conferences. And he liked it. It was interesting. He didn’t really mind studying that, even though if he had the choice, he preferred grabbing a fiction book or watching an unrelated documentary on Netflix. Shouldn’t he be more passionate about it? He didn’t know how he was supposed to feel about it. And no one could answer for him.
« What do you mean ? »
“I thought you’d never make it there on time!” Benny said.
“I… Yes, I think I’d like to, if only I could…”
“Well, it's your choice, but I'd be happy if you joined us. Dean would be glad, too, by the way. He's always asking about you.”
“I… No, I don’t,” he said, confused by the turn of events.
“Maybe 2 to 4pm, like today’s meeting, would be good for both of us, then?” Cas suggested.
Charlie seemed a little bit surprised – she probably wasn’t expecting him to talk about asexuality.
On the sidewalk, he came face to face with… Dean, who was holding his phone on his shoulder with his right hand.
“Okay then I’ll pick you up at 6:30, if that’s okay for you?” Dean said, interrupting Cas’ thoughts.
Yet, Dean had said that his messy bed hair looked good? And all those winks? Cas had never seen someone winking that much in such a short period of time. Maybe Dean was just a winking person in general, and not only with him? But he also had offered to teach him how to play poker. Then again, something that a nice guy like Dean would probably offer to anyone. Even Balthazar had said that Dean was “easygoing.” There was nothing special about Cas that justified any special behavior from Dean. Dean might not even be gay! He probably wasn’t!
“Perfect! We have our first pair, then. You can go up to Jody’s desk to choose your preferred time slot and the age of the group of children you’ll be taking care of."
“When I became human, I got overwhelmed with a lot of new sensations - physical sensations, like hunger, or pain - but also, mental sensations: new thoughts, new feelings, new worries. I was already feeling these things as an angel. I’ve learned to, since I’ve met you and Sam, but…now it’s so much more. For everything, but especially for you.”
like your profile, didn’t I?” he grinned at Cas.
“Why?” Cas asked, raising an eyebrow.
“You sound like the Christmas movies Cas has been watching today. Probably where he got the idea of baking cookies in the first place by the way.”
“Cas, you there? I think I saw Dean’s car outside, have you seen him?” Balthazar called, walking in from the corridor. He took a few steps into the living room and stopped when he saw them.
He opened the trunk to grab the pies he had baked while Cas took the drinks. Dean fidgeted in his jeans pocket for a few seconds before taking out a key. He unlocked the door and opened it for Cas.
"I thought I could finally take you up on your offer!"
“Hey Cas! Nice to see you here!” he said, cheerfully.
To be honest, he was a little bit irritated by Dean’s behavior tonight. It wasn’t what he had expected when deciding to come to the party – but maybe it was his fault, after all. He had done what he had promised himself he wouldn’t do when he first met Dean: he got his hopes too high. He thought Dean would be surprised, but glad to see him here, and that they could spend some time together in a new setting – a setting that Dean liked and was comfortable in. But instead, Dean had barely acknowledged him, preferring to be the center of attention, making coarse jokes to make everyone laugh. Cas was not used to seeing him like that, and he was disappointed. Was that really who Dean was? He still had the same self-confidence, except that it wasn’t reassuring like usual; no, this time it was irritating, because Dean appeared as someone too smug.
It was a very simple scene, and yet Cas felt privileged to have been able to witness it. Dean's life seemed so easy, so joyful, he seemed to enjoy it so much... It was a thousand miles away from his own life. His own life was complicated because he made it complicated; because he was introverted, anxious, afraid of everything, and withdrawn. He would be lucky if Dean would agree to even be his friend. And that would be enough for him. He would take whatever Dean could give him - and his friendship would be a lot. Obviously, nothing would ever happen between him and Dean. It was ridiculous for him to even imagine for one second that Dean could be interested in him in a romantic way. They were incompatible, radically different. And Cas shouldn't expect anything; otherwise, he would inevitably be disappointed, and that wouldn't be good for either him or Dean.
“What the hell just happened?” he muttered quietly.
Everybody in the room was looking at them and Cas looked at his feet, ill-at-ease. And to think that he had hoped not to stand out too much during the first meeting! Dean sat down, still looking at Cas.
“Hello, Dean”, he said, his voice no different than usual.
“Well, tonight will be my first party and probably my only chance to make a “first impression” on your friends…”
Oh no. This was so embarrassing. Cas felt himself turning crimson. What would Dean think about him now? The worst part was that he wasn’t even checking him out, he was… researching, and trying to understand why people would check him out. Now Dean probably thought he was a pervert. Or maybe not, because he was probably used to people staring at him. But he would think that Cas was interested in him – which was true – in a sexual way – which wasn’t true.
Was socializing this easy? Cas had feared unknown social situations for years, and now he could just attend some random meeting with strangers without freaking out, even be able to make small talk with them?
“I’m beginning to think I’m really dangerous for your head.”
Of course Balthazar wasn’t awake yet. The house was still quiet, and Cas noticed that his roommate had taken some time to clean the living room before going to sleep. That was something that Cas enjoyed about him: he was really respectful. Cas prepared some eggs, toast, and bacon, and ate peacefully. However, as he was thinking about his day, trying to imagine how the meeting would go, parasitic thoughts began to invade him. Cas sighed. He had only eaten one slice of toast and he still had a piece of bacon left on his plate, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to eat any more.
Cas blushed. If only Dean knew what he was thinking about…
“Right,” Dean said, without hanging up himself directly.
Cas blushed a little. He crossed Charlie’s gaze, uncertain of what to say. He had never said clearly to Dean that he was gay – and he didn’t want him to know he was asexual. He already didn’t have any chance with him, but if Dean also knew that Cas was asexual… He would never consider him as more than a friend! Even if Cas wasn’t against having sex, asexuality wasn’t a very well known orientation, and there were still a lot of clichés about it. Cas didn’t know what Dean knew about it, and he didn’t want him to assume anything.
The TA gave them back their last assignment. Cas was always anxious before discovering his grades. For this exercise, he knew he had probably done well, but he wasn’t sure of a few answers, and he hadn’t spent too much time on it. He had done it the week before his first meeting for the volunteering program, and he had been anxious about it, not focusing too much on his academic works.
Dean shrugged. “I texted you I was okay.”
“Well, you shouldn’t have been.”
“Maybe you shouldn’t ask me for fashion advice, you know I like wearing extravagant clothes… Because I believe that your clothes should reveal your personality… So wear something you like, something you want to wear.”
Apparently, Cas had been deeply upset by the comments of his coworkers. Dean felt a wave of anger building inside him.
“Okay, no problem. So you don’t want to quickly introduce yourself to the others?”
Tom gave him a puzzled look.
Dean stared at him, a little taken aback, as Cas burst out laughing at his dumbstruck look. For once, it was Dean who was losing his composure... It was so unusual for him that Cas was delighted with the situation. After a while, Dean gradually began to laugh back, first softly, then frankly roaring with laughter, and it was a beautiful sound. Cas loved Dean's laugh, and more than that, he loved being the source of that laughter. Knowing that he had the power to make him so happy... was making him happy too!
“Oh yes, don’t worry Dean, I might be human now, but I can still defend myself if needed. And Tom wasn’t mean. He wouldn’t have forced me to do anything I didn’t want to.”
Cas gasped quietly. Was Dean reading his mind? Or was he just extremely thoughtful?
“Can I sit here?”
And he winked at him and Cas wondered if he was dreaming, and if he wasn’t, how he could still be alive, and why he hadn’t had a heart attack yet, given how fast his heart was beating and how fast his thoughts were racing.
"Honestly, Cas, well done, buddy. That was a hell of a good one!"
“No, it’s downtown," Dean answered. "We have to take the bus, but don’t worry, we can go together, I won’t let you get lost on the streets of Lawrence!”
Thank you for reading! I had a lot of fun working on this project, and I'd like to thank one last time all the people involved in it, especially Aggiedoll, bodyandsoul and TessAlyn for their kindness.
However, he read about the concept, and quickly discovered his definition of asexuality was wrong. He learned about the difference between romantic and sexual attraction, and from what he read, it was clear that he never felt that “sexual attraction”. That was how he realized that, after all, people were not exaggerating when talking about sex. He began to rethink almost all of the conversations he had ever had with friends about sex. So all these times, they hadn’t been joking? He had really misread and misunderstood so many conversations? The idea had felt overwhelming, in the beginning, and he had tried to forget about it. He was already “different” enough, no need to add something else on top of everything.
Dean had finally shut up, and was still watching the road, his expression gradually hardening. Cas realized that Dean must have misinterpreted his lack of reaction.
Cas, who was correcting his math exercise, froze and put his pen down. “What do you mean, Jack? Dean and I weren’t mad at each other!”
Cas’ heartbeat accelerated and he focused on not blushing. Jack looked at him curiously, and Cas shook his head to refocus on his task. It wasn’t the moment to act like a 12-year-old having his first crush on the popular boy at school.
"Well, only if you want to, of course..." Dean added, a little unsure.
“You didn’t call me like that since…", the angel started to say, in a questioning tone.
He was interrupted by a ringtone. It took it a moment to realize it was his phone. Who could be calling him at 11 pm on a Friday night? The only people who usually called him was his father, who was probably sleeping, and Balthazar, who wasn’t far from him and wasn’t on his phone. He grabbed his phone to check the ID of the caller. He held back a little exclamation from the surprise.
“Stop talking as if I’m not here!” she protested, crossing her arms.
he thought.
"You don’t have any...?" Dean said - and it was more of a statement than a question.
Dean seemed pleased that Cas asked.
“How do you feel about burgers? There’s a place not far from the fieldhouse that I really like.”
Dean was still laughing, and hadn't realized that Cas was lost in his thoughts, so Cas decided to pull himself together, to not give Dean the opportunity to see him being pensive.
“And who is your friend?” Meg asked, to change the topic.
“Well, I don’t really know. They were together for a pretty long time, compared to Dean’s usual relationships, but it wasn’t something very official or even exclusive, I think. With Dean, it’s hard to keep track anyway,” he chuckled, but stopped immediately after seeing the black look Cas was giving him. “I don’t really know if – or when – they broke up, but a few weeks ago, Dean brought a new girl, someone called Callie, I think…”
“Good. I’m sorry, I didn’t think you would hit your head…”
“Hey, Cas. You don’t have to be afraid, okay? You can…you can tell me anything. I won’t get mad. I promise. Just…just keep talking to me, okay? I’m not the best at feelings, but we can figure it out together. It’s normal that after your…changes. You’ve been confused. Don’t worry.”
“Dean, lunch is ready,” Sam came to the garage to tell him a few hours later.
“You won’t bother me. Never. I’m glad you asked me. Your kitchen will make baking much easier. And…”. He stopped, and Cas kept staring at him, mesmerized by the confidence and the calm steadiness that came from him. “And your presence will make it better, too,” he said softly.
Dean sighed. Yes, if Cas wanted to go on this date, there was nothing he could do to prevent him. However, it was his duty, as his friend and “human life teacher” to give him advice, and to educate him on some topics. After all, Dean was kind of an expert on the flirting field, and Cas definitely needed to hear that his profile description was NOT okay. (Even though it didn’t seem to have held Tom back).
Cas regretted saying that the moment he said it – it was too much. A friend wouldn’t have said that. Dean would know that Cas had a crush on him, and he would be uncomfortable. This was stupid of him, and… And Dean beamed at him, apparently very pleased with Cas’ answer. Cas decided to stop talking, and he smiled back, and suddenly a horn sounded, and Cas realized they were in front of his place, and that a car was waiting behind them for Dean to start the car again. Cas grabbed his bag and opened the door.
“And I like you even more when you’re blushing like that… You’re adorable,” he whispered.
“Ye… Yes, I think so.”
Cas turned away to face Dean, but looked down immediately when he crossed his gaze, blushing a little, embarrassed.
“No, thanks, I’m currently talking to Raphael,” Cas answered, maybe a little bit colder than he had planned.
Balthazar rolled his eyes.
“What, you saw they were out of chamomile tea? Don’t worry, you’ll survive…”
CAS : “I don’t know what you mean by “date”, Dean. I was just suggesting maybe we could meet in the Dean Cave like we usually do in the evenings.”
“Hey, Cas! How was your day?”
“Perfect. Do you have any questions?”
it’s a classic, but the quality of the picture is gorgeous.
Cas blinked.
At least, he didn’t have to think about all of that while he was scrutinizing Dean’s eyes. He could just…not think, and it felt relaxing. It was very paradoxical: on one hand, Dean was making him very flustered and was filling his mind with a thousand new questions, but on the other hand, his deep green eyes had something soothing, almost hypnotizing about them that made him calm instantly. The two sensations were in any case very new to Cas.
“I see your teacher skills every week during tutoring, but I thought it was time to check them out for myself. You know, just to assess your pedagogy and your efficacy to determine whether I can leave the education of those poor children at the CLCP in your hands!” he said, pointing at the poker case. He hesitated for half a second, and then made his mind. Feeling bold, he looked at Dean, and punctuated his little speech with a wink.
“Cas.”
“Even when all the kids are gone, I’ll still have a child here with me…”
Seeing Dean like that, losing his composure, stammering quite incoherently, trying to sound casual when his babbling was betraying his embarrassment, was surprising. It was exactly how Cas usually behaved himself! It was so far from how Dean usually behaved. Suggesting a simple friendly activity shouldn't have embarrassed Dean so much. It was the kind of thing he did all the time... Unless it wasn't a simple friendly activity?
Cas stared at him, a little bit suspicious. “Really? You are not saying this to be polite and to make me happy?”
“Well, you could have something”, Dean muttered. “It would have saved us time.”
He slept until late the next day, and honestly, he needed it. He was not ready to face Dean, but he had no choice. He needed to be professional, for the children at least, who had nothing to do with that situation.
“Okay, I’m ready. I’m ready." He grabbed his phone, took a deep breath, and finally left the house.
“Yes Dean I just wanted to let you know that we arrived. But where are you? What it is this noise?”
“Yes. I’m Castiel.”
“Yes. Of… Of course. It was… a stupid question to ask, I’m sorry”.
“I guess so… I have no experience in the “long-term relationship” area, so I don’t know what to expect… But Benny’s not like the other guys. It’s different with him, I’ve never felt this way before, so… I’ll see how things go,” she admitted, obviously uncomfortable – she didn’t like taking her mask off and being honest about her feelings.
It was Dean who, every night, would make a point of preparing Cas a different dish to find out what flavors he liked and then suggest a movie to help him perfect his knowledge of pop culture.
Cas’ eyes widened. He was too startled by the innuendo to blush or to react. Dean just winked at him and then backed away, now smiling smugly, proud of his little effect, his arms crossed again. Was he waiting for Cas to reply? Because Cas had no idea of how he could answer...that. Had he been joking? That had really sounded like a flirtation, but it wasn’t a real one, was it? It was too much to be a real flirtation! Dean probably overplayed it to make a joke, and instead of laughing, Cas had been flustered, making the scene weird. He forced himself to smile.
Cas looked ashamed.
Dean turned to Cas.
“No”, Dean sighed, impatiently. “Download this dating app! Did you tell Sam about it?”
Cas blushed.
“I like to sleep in on Saturdays mornings anyway,” Cas said, “so you’ll be able to keep your Fridays for parties, don’t worry.”
Dean stood up. “Come on, Cas." He pulled on Cas’ sleeve to get him to follow. “Sorry I volunteered us so quickly, but I knew that the first ones to pair up would be the first ones to choose their groups and times, so…”
“And you created a profile on it.”
, he thought once again.
“Oh yes, of course, Cas! You're a little bit early, but come in, I was just preparing tea for the meeting!”
“Um… Sorry, could you say it again?”
“Dean. Glad to see you finally decided to honour us with your presence,” Raphael answered coldly.
“Aw, Clarence, there’s nothing wrong with having a crush. We’ve all been there. And I’ll grant you that he’s super sexy. I wouldn’t say no to a night with him.”
“Be my guest”, he said without great enthusiasm.
It was 9:30 when they arrived at the bar, and most of Balthazar’s friends from the poker circle were already there. Cas recognized some of the people that had been in their living room a few weeks ago. Dean was there, too, but his back was turned, so he didn’t see them coming. He was apparently busy talking, very closely, to a young woman. Cas tried to not be disappointed.
“No, I’m fine.”
This time, Balthazar jumped to his feet, very excited. “Oh oh oh, is it a date?”
“My…my head?” Cas repeated, confused.
Cas rolled his eyes, but laughed anyway. The good old Dean he knew was back. He never stayed emotional for too long – but Cas appreciated the fact he had told him he noticed his change. He realized it too, but it was always nice to hear it from someone else. Once the dishes were done and the room was cleaned, they gathered their belongings and got into Dean's car to drive back to campus.
“Thanks! I knew I was missing something easy, but couldn’t figure out what…Usually, Dean is here to help me with the computer stuff, but he seems to be late today…”
Cas’ phone vibrated, pulling him out of his spiral. Who could be texting him at nine on a Friday evening? Maybe Meg had a problem? Or one of his brothers? He took a look at the screen and his heart skipped a beat. Dean had texted him.
Dean was walking in front of him, carrying the two hot cups, looking for two seats. On his way, at least three students stopped him to greet him. Every time, he answered very enthusiastically with a little word for everyone, genuinely caring about his various acquaintances. He seemed so at ease among all the students, smiling widely, getting excited with a guy about the next big football game, commenting on the latest episode of a trendy TV show with two girls… He was in his element, and he was glowing.
They stopped talking for a moment, just looking at each other in comfortable silence. Cas knew that he would have to look away, turn back to grab the bread and start preparing his sandwich at some point, but found that he didn’t want to. Not right now. He was almost paralyzed and couldn’t break eye contact.
The guy from the couch was standing in the kitchen doorway, two empty bottles of beer in his hands. Cas brought his hand to his head, rubbing his skull, grimacing a little with pain. The guy quickly put the bottles on the table and reached towards Cas.
Opening his wardrobe, Cas wondered what he could wear. How did people dress up to go to parties? It was something really new for him. And, most importantly… What would Dean like? Meg had told him that Dean had also flirted with boys before, even if Cas had only seen him with girls, so he was probably bisexual. Still, he had no idea whether Dean could like him – not because he was a boy, but because of who he was. He decided to ask Balthazar what he would be wearing, and get his advice on the right outfit.
Some minutes pass before one of them speaks again.
, Cas. This is the only way we can stop Michael.”
He reaches him and put a hand on his shoulder, making him turn.
tell me what you need.” he doesn’t flinch when Dean’s hand clings almost desperately on his forearm, trying to steady himself.
He’d never even fought before, never faced the dark end of a musket and known what it was to feel true, crippling fear, and overcome that fear for the sake of a greater purpose. If only he’d gotten to make just a little more impact.

“There was a warded door,” Castiel explains, folding his arms over his chest to keep the ledger secure as they walk. “Behind it was a red room, and I found a book locked in one of the desk drawers. It’s going to tell us who took the amulet, I know it.”

Castiel just lifts the cigarette to his lips again, and takes a long drag. The smoke curls out from between his lips and dissipates into the air, but in the red-gold light of the setting sun that filters through the dusty windows, his blue eyes seem to glow.
Castiel’s mind is whirling, desperately trying to figure out how to get himself out of this, but he can’t. If he moves, even so much a
And now… it might all be coming to an end.
Nothing has ever come of it.
“I’m an expensive man,” Castiel quips back with a smirk, reaching up for the bourbon, then closing his liquor cabinet. When he turns to set the bottle on his desk, he finds Dean leaning against the dark wood, hands pushed into the pockets of his jeans. His medusa piercing glints, drawing Castiel’s attention down to his lips. “What made you come here today?” he asks, forcing his attention away to pour out their drinks.
There it is.
There’s so much he wants to say to Dean, so much he wants to know about him and his life, and biting his tongue is one of the hardest things he’s done. The pain is both a blessing and a curse, because it distracts him from the beautiful artist, but his resolve to stay quiet means that he has nothing else to focus on. He suffers through it in silence, not thinking about how close Dean is, or the touch of gloved fingers on his skin—
Six months ago, Dean lost his best friend.
It takes a second for Castiel to realize that the funeral procession has passed them, and that Dean’s coffin is being carried up the hill, towards the sycamore tree that stands watch over Mary Winchester’s grave. Of course Dean can’t stand here, talking to Castiel, while that invisible tether is trying to rein him back in.
It’s a cold morning, and Castiel has barely hung his coat up by the door of his office when Anna pokes her head in. She looks tired, and there’s a frown creasing her brows that shouldn’t be there this early in the morning.
Castiel moves first, in measured footsteps and with an air about him that never fails to make Dean weak at the knees. His wings flare, stretching out wide in a captivating flex of muscle and ripple of feathers, and in a matter of seconds Dean finds himself backed up against his car. There’s barely an inch between them, Cas’s wings bracketing Dean on either side, and it’s a good thing that Dean doesn’t need to breathe because all he can focus on right now is the heat radiating off Castiel, and how fucking
All that comes to Dean's mind is another ‘shut up,’ so instead he flips Sam off and reverses out of the parking area. "Find me the nearest town so I don't have to put up with you any more," he mutters, and from the back, he hears Sam snicker.
with himself for liking the way he’d been dominant over Dean. He’d let it happen, let himself give into the biology he’s always denied.
By the time they end up back in the apartment, it’s late, and all Castiel wants to do is take Dean to bed and kiss him until they both fall asleep. They’ve been working all day, though, and he can feel the lingering of residual sweat on his skin, so as soon as the front door closes behind them, Castiel takes Dean’s hand and gently leads him over towards the bathroom.
Dean is silent, and then the weight against Castiel’s back disappears, and his heart flip-flops in his chest in a moment of panic.
“The room was warded, which might be why I can’t see anything in it properly. I can’t see any faces except for Alastair.” He runs his fingers across the pages one more time, just to be sure, then sits back with a sigh. “Alastair clearly knows what he’s doing, so whoever’s hired him does as well.”
The purpose of the matching ball is to find that familiar. It is for witches to select the person they connect most strongly with, who makes their magic resonate like no other. It is, in theory, an excellent idea for bringing together eligible young witches and familiars to try and create the best and most successful bonds.
Now it’s Dean’s turn to gasp, biting at Castiel’s bottom lip and moaning his pleasure into the night air as Castiel strokes his cock. Castiel’s other hand slides possessively over the curve of Dean’s ass, chuckling into the kiss as Dean rocks his hips forward and fucks into Castiel’s grip.
“So, uh,” Dean says, a faint flush colouring his cheeks. “Burgers?”

He was a hunter. Hunters didn’t live to see life past thirty-five—maybe forty, if you were good at what you did. Once you knew about the things that were out there, there was no getting out of the life, and once you got old, you got slow.
So, safe to say that when Dean arrives at the airport ahead of his flight to London to visit Sam, he’s feeling more than a little wound up. It’s been forever since the last time he flew, but there’s no way that he’s going to miss visiting Sam at Oxford (fucking

“I’d like you to go to the lounge and pick the comfiest-looking cushion. I don’t want you kneeling on the ground, especially not after the day you’ve had.”
There are people shouting questions at them from all directions as they make their way along the carpet, and they get pulled aside for an interview almost immediately. Castiel can’t hide his amusement as the interviewer frantically looks through her cue cards, then seems to give up and tosses them aside with a slightly nervous laugh.
Show some love to the original
In Naomi’s mind, submissives are to be seen and not heard in meetings like this. But Castiel is more than happy to let Dean destroy that notion for her.
Dean rolls onto his side to look at him, and Castiel extends his arm almost automatically, pulling him in against his side. “I know I was meant to be looking after

All it takes is a single quirk of Cas’s eyebrow and half a minute of patient waiting before Dean breaks.

The kiss only lasts a few brief moments, but there’s
“He, um… he was driving home from the store a few days ago, and he…” Sam runs his fingers through his hair, then laces them behind his neck and looks up at the sky. “Fuck, he got t-boned by a semi, Cas. He got hit, and he… he didn’t make it.”
It pays off. Dean looks over at him, and when their eyes meet, he must be able to see just how much Castiel is trying to restrain himself, because the corners of his lips quirk up into a tiny smile. “Man, you feel like you’re about to vibrate right out of existence. You can chill out, I’m not gonna keep anything from you, okay? Well… not that there was much to find, anyway.”

He hears the sound of the shower running.
Dean white-knuckles the edge of his container and glares at Novak as he returns his attention to Dean. "Good luck with the donuts," he says with a faint smirk, then turns on his heel and makes his way back to his own bench, leaving Dean's space and giving him a bit of room to breathe once more.
The touch of Dean’s fingers on his forearm is explorative, yielding, gentle. He traces the lines of his own artwork, carefully tilts Castiel’s arm this way and that to examine it. His hands are warm,

a bullet hole in his shoulder, so he just smiles and flirts back as much as he’s able, until Dean’s shoulder is properly dressed and he’s limp and boneless against the bed.
“Can I put it on?” he asks softly, and again, Dean nods.
But when Castiel looks over, the corners of Dean’s lips are turned up into a smile, clearly teasing. Cas levels a fond glare at him.
The finger is dangerous, but his lips are even more so. Castiel focuses on the finger until Dean decides that they’re safe, that no one overheard Cas use his name.
“Fuck, babe, please, I—“
The scent of Dean’s slick curls through the air as his belt is unbuckled and pants shoved down around his thighs, and Dean is grateful that the darkness doesn’t show the flush on his cheeks as he realises just how fucking turned on he is. Cas growls as he smells it, breaking away from the kiss for a moment to drink in the air. “You smell incredible,” he mutters under his breath, and Dean, needing to put himself back on level ground, runs his fingers through Cas’s hair and kisses him again.
wanted this.”
Castiel lets himself into their apartment late on a Friday night with a grin on his face that he can’t shake. “You home?” he calls, even though he does know that Dean’s home, because his keys are in the little dish by the door and there’s classic rock emanating from Dean’s studio.
Castiel doesn’t hesitate to lean forward and kiss him, relishing the taste of his own precome on Dean’s tongue. He spends a few seconds learning the shape of Dean’s lips against his own once more, then releases Dean’s hair to let his hands wander south, to the button and fly of Dean’s jeans.
They’re in Castiel’s bed, half-clothed and trading feverish, desperate kisses, when Dean stops him with a hand on his chest. “Before we do this, you should know,” he starts, his voice quiet and a little breathless, “that I’m not looking for long-term, Cas. I’m leaving town in a few days’ time, I—I can’t.” He watches Castiel with dark eyes, and that fragile
Cas dropped the bees off on Monday, which means Dean has to wait four excruciating days until their date. He fills those days by exhausting himself on the farm, writing page after page in his diary, and texting Cas as often as he possibly can without feeling like he’s gonna scare the dude off. Luckily, Cas doesn’t seem to mind—he’s endearingly dorky with his texts, punctuating every message perfectly and giving his emoticons little noses.
He’s never had anyone do that for him before. Not even Inias.
Dean's blood is rushing in his ears, and he feels as though he might throw up when the priest turns his attention on him. He barely hears the questions being asked of him, but just enough must get through to him for him to understand, because then he's saying, "I do," and the whole hall is applauding.
Dean whips around, his eyes wide. He'd been so sure that he'd been alone in the kitchen—Castiel had packed up his station, talked with the others like he was going home, but here he is, standing guiltily at the end of Dean's countertop. For a second, Dean opens and closes his mouth, and then sets his face into a scowl.
Dean doesn’t get sick often, but when he does, it always feels like it’s kicking the crap out of him. Luckily, Cas is a great nurse—not in
“I—I don’t know if you’re here, Castiel,” he says quietly, his voice cracking around the syllables. “Dean told me a lot about you, and I know he would want you to know, so I just have to… hope that you can hear me.” He swipes a hand over his eyes, but fresh tears are quick to well up, and this time, he just lets them track down his cheeks.
Dean is a lot smarter than Castiel sometimes.
Still, despite his overwhelming shock, Dean is nothing if not well-trained in courtesy. He forces his gaze towards the floor and bows as deeply as his tired body can manage. “Your Majesty.”
The guy rakes his fingers through his hair (only serving to make it messier), then looks over towards the shop. Even though the windows are dark-tinted from the outside, and there’s no way it’s possible—it feels like the man is looking directly at Castiel.
“Thank you kindly, ma’am,” he says with a smile and a slightly shy glance down at his boots. After so many decades of near-solitude, interacting only with other spirits, it’s safe to say that his ‘people skills’ may be a little ‘rusty.’ Still, none of the spirits seem to mind, most of them too focused on the life they’ve left behind or the world waiting for them beyond the veil, whatever that may be.
For some reason, Dean hasn’t been able to get into the Christmas spirit this year. They’ve had hunt after hunt after hunt and a run of shit luck, and the last thing he wants to do right now is go out and brave the crazy malls looking for presents, or have to listen to Sam sing off-key Christmas carols while hanging up decorations around the bunker.
Dean isn’t usually the dancing type unless he’s got a few drinks in him, but right now he’s feeling pleasantly buzzed, and he lets himself move along to the music in the middle of the dancing crowd. To let go like this, to not have to worry about anything and just live in the moment, just

For a moment, he just stares up at the ceiling of the tent, gathering his thoughts and energy for the day, then exhales the breath he’s been holding and pushes himself up out of bed.
There’s a rustle on the other side of the phone, and when Dean speaks again, his voice is clearer, more serious. “Yeah, of course,” he says. “I’m glad you actually did. You not doing too well?”
He doesn’t even know where to start processing all of this—all he can hear in his head is the pounding rhythm of:
Which means
He takes his time finding the places where Dean is most sensitive, where he gasps and moans and makes little, wrecked sounds as he bites his lip, and catalogues them for later. Being able to pull these reactions from him has Castiel buzzing with pride and arousal, and he groans against Dean’s skin as he sucks at the sensitive spot just below Dean’s ear and is rewarded by nails biting into his back.
But before he can second guess his decision to meet up with Dean tonight, can make any excuses to disappear back into the evening dusk and retreat back home to where he doesn’t have to push himself out of his comfort zone, Dean starts walking. Casually, slowly, hands in his pockets as he strolls down the sidewalk and away from the studio. Castiel’s brain responds automatically…
An offering provided, a question to which Dean holds the answer in his hands.
He’d been trying not to watch, because the way Dean works and the concentrated focus on his face is too beautiful for words, so instead he’d been staring at the ceiling for most of the time. Now, though, when he finally lets himself see the work Dean has done for the first time…
Dean lets go of Castiel with one arm and reaches down into his pocket, fishing out his phone. He unlocks it, then ends the recording. “It might be a little bit muffled, since I don’t think the sound quality is great from my pocket, but… it should do it. Man, I thought you were being paranoid, but holy shit. They are… not good people.”
come back to Cas.
“Detective Winchester!”
The next day follows much the same routine.
Anna gives him a look like she doesn’t quite believe him—which is fair enough—but relents. “Alright. I’ll come find you bright and early tomorrow, though, so we can get started with teaching you your new role.”
They’re halfway through a hunt when Castiel falls.
Dean's laugh feels like it's been startled out of him. God, how does he like this guy so much already? He's so glad he invited him out here—now he gets to feel what it's
eyyy it's me! I have risen from the dead! The past month and a half have really been kicking my ass, but I missed this damn WIP so much. Thank you
For the sake of his experiment (so he tells himself), he tries flirting with guys as well. It’s something he’s done a little bit of in the past, so it does come back to him quickly, but—
It’s weird, standing on ceremony.
It’s solid, but not heavy, and Dean can feel Cas’s gaze on him as he unwraps the cloth with curious fingers, draping the fabric off the edges of his hand to reveal the gift.
Instead, he tucks it into his pocket and tries not to think about it.
Every year, on this day, he makes a point to visit the grave of Mary Winchester. Since that fateful day that he met Dean, he’s never seen anyone visit her. It’s not that he’s not looking—he’s become attuned to the cemetery after over a hundred years spent here, and he’s
Amongst all the bustle of a circus troupe, though, the performers manage to find plenty of time to relax. Dean’s favourite way to spend his downtime is with a nice, cold beer and the company of his friends, in whichever bar takes their fancy that night. They’re well known, especially Dean with his pretty face and acrobatic prowess, and it often means that they have no shortage of admirers wherever they go. Most of the time, those who proposition him are gently turned down, but on the rare nights when there are no performances scheduled for the next day, some attractive guy or girl may get lucky.
Dean finds himself in an alternate but very familiar universe in his search for Cas.
, as though his body and his soul are immeasurably weighted.
Tucked behind the man’s ear is a single white-gold lily, and a golden amulet hangs around his neck. He watches Castiel like he can see him, like he
He smiles, and lets Dean’s hand go. “I can take a look at your bike now, if you’d like? Or… you must be pretty warm, riding in that jacket. Would you like a glass of water?”
Dean smiles, slow and soft, and turns to watch Castiel in the dimness of the dashboard lights. It’s a knowing smile, affectionate and fond and full of so many other emotions that Castiel couldn’t put a name to but feels resonating in his heart.
subbing, with the right person and doing the right things. It’ll be the same for you. Some stuff won’t work for you, but some stuff will make you feel really good, and doing it with compatible people will make it even better. There’s absolutely no shame in that. If you’re into it, and I’m into it, and we’re both enjoying it… that’s what matters. I know you’ve got years of mental shit to break, but you’re on the right track, Cas. And no matter what’s going on in your head, I’m here for you.”
The silence is still thick between them.
Sam and Balthazar crash in the shack, unceremoniously landing on the floor, and soon Castiel is back to business. The dim flickering emotion in his blue eyes long gone.
?” a strong whine and then Cas turns around, walking quickly away from that street.
Their breaths are the only noise in the room, Castiel’s eyes are still fixed on Dean’s figure: he has closed his and he’s biting his lower lip in waiting.
Cas left him alone and Dean will never see him again.
“Showing emotions it’s not a dishonor, Sheriff.” the man shivers and glances away. “You’re human, Jackson.
They land in a shack.
Cas shakes his head and then with a tilt notices a silver package in Dean’s hands, acknowledging it with a questioning sound.
Dean closes his eyes and his eyelids tremble against his cheeks. A bitter smile pulls at his lips when he gives him the pendant back.
When the light is turned off Castiel leaves the room.
and Cas doesn’t really know the meaning of it, but contentment on the other hand is a solid ground.
Sam glares at him and gets up, putting a hand on Jack’s shoulder, shielding him.
“Oh, so you do talk.”
Cas finds Dean immersed in a deep study of the brilliance of two blue balls that he’s holding between his two hands.
“Seriously?” Dean arches an eyebrow when Sam shakes his head and drops the sticky tape on the small table. Sighing, he takes the lights between his hands, stretching the wire and assessing its length. “We’re gonna turn the bunker into Santa’s house, won’t we?”
to find Dean to tell him that the coroner-
“How do you feel?”
Cas takes it, opening it a little to sniff its smell, frowning slightly confused.
Maybe are the crinkles around Dean’s eyes now that he’s beaming with delight, amused by Sam’s reaction.
“Do you think Sam will still take long?” Dean nudges at his right shoulder to call his attention.
Sam drops the iPad on the table and when they enter into the room again, he stares at them open-mouthed.
“You don’t have to do this.” the led suddenly becomes black and Dean turns towards Castiel. “
Dean is staring at the mistletoe, hanging from the ceiling with a transparent wire that keeps it floating in the air in the middle of the kitchen.
“Dean, I-“
His hair are disheveled and his shirt is clinging at his chest, soaked in sweat.
But what makes Dean really snap is the way Jack suddenly gets up, leaving a half-line empty, and takes the golden tree topper, standing on his tiptoes to try and put it without having decorated the rest of the tree.
“Unstable.” his voice is raspy and his words are barely understandable.
A loud cough behind his shoulders make him turn around. Castiel is just staring at him, a small soft smile pulling at the corner of his lips, and Sam is next to him, the spoon still inside his mouth and a confused expression on his face. Dean shakes his head stunned and sits again.
Cas closes his fists, his knuckles white for the strength and even if an inner voice says that he should do something -a hand on his shoulder, a smile of compassion, a sign that could make the Sheriff aware that
“You’re an ass.”
Their bodies sway slowly, out of sync with the song, but they don’t care.
“I’ll always be here for you, Castiel. Always.”
and tightens his hold on Dean’s hand. He swallows slightly before pronouncing his next words.
Balthazar bites his lower lip.
A silent figure crouches beside him, taking his hand and intertwining their fingers.
“You shouldn’t be doing what you don’t feel doing.” Dean continues with a bitter smile on his lips.  “You shouldn’t be doing it for anyone.”
“Sam-“
is what he
Dean howls in pain.
Cas lowers himself again and he engulfs his erection, sucking and nibbling the shaft while Dean moves his hips, and then Cas unbuttons his pants, lowering the zip and slipping a hand inside, touching himself without gazing off and drinking in the sight of Dean moaning and trembling.
The angel gets up from the bed and stretches his arms, the bones behind his back popping satisfyingly when he shrugs his shoulders.
He raises an eyebrow challenging when he feels Dean’s gaze on him, and smirks when he throws the chips in the middle of the map table.
“Thank you.” Cas murmurs against his neck, starting to kiss the skin under his ear. Dean just sighs, closing his eyes lost in the sensation. “It really means a lot to me.”
Again and again and again.
Dean doesn’t flinch and without changing his expression calls too, taking the deck of the remnant cards between his hands and smiling suggestively at Cas.
Jack frowns and looks at the small blue bow on his palm.
“The hunt went well. We salt ‘n burned the ghosts. I’d called it a success.” Dean softly smiles and shifts his foot on the floor, kicking away a small pebble. He raises his eyes and looks at him for one brief moment, before looking at his own fingers. “Do you want to hit the bar with us?”
The tears are streaming down his face when he turns around and cups his face, putting his lips on his eyelids.
looked for online ads to adopt a guinea pig.”
Dean pretends not to feel the dampness of his tears against his face when he kisses him.
“At least she doesn’t screw with her own brother.”
It felt so wrong when he watched how his fingers had laced with hers, dragging her above the first step of her building, stealing another kiss from her red lips.
A sudden warmth on his shoulder makes him raise his head.
“Give him to me.” He takes Peanut from Cas’s arms and Cas is surprised by how much he already misses the soft fur under his fingers and the light weight on his legs. He can already imagine the sleepless nights he’ll pass scratching him behind his ears as he’ll be studying.
“Raphael.” Castiel begins, staring in front of him. “I can’t allow him to-“ his voice trembles and Balthazar stretches a hand, putting it on his knee to ground him. ”It’s on me, can’t you see it?” He meets his eyes and a small bitter smile escapes from his lips when he sees concern in the blue irises of his friend. “Sam and Dean, they… It’s just on me, Balthazar.”
Dean opens his mouth, trying to say something but Cas just shakes his head and smiles, leaving him at loss of words. He softly kisses his lips again, before starting his descent towards his chest, grazing a nipple with his teeth. Dean cries out in pleasure when Cas takes him in his hand, starting to pump him.
makes, he can feel the gloominess that clouds his heart dissolve a little.
“Just… come here.”
“I don’t care.” Dean stares at him resolute in the eye and Cas feels a surge of love for him rising in his chest. He gulps and slowly nods, before opening the small box to show Dean its content.
Cas doesn’t miss the bitter smile painted on his face when he turns into the corridor.
Sam flips him off.
"Why?"
Castiel closes his eyes and inhales sharply with his nose.
Some dimples form around his mouth when he smiles, taking the device in his hands to unlock it.
When Jack beams and hands him a Christmas cookie in sign of peace, he takes it, crunching slightly when continue to observe the way they start to decorate the tree.
“I’m with you. Never forget it.” Castiel’s words are muffled by the palm of Dean, that tries to stop him, yet Castiel shakes his head and frees himself from his grip. “I’ll always be with you.”
Dean left the house early that morning and Cas took it as a sign to get everything ready. The lights, the still unlit candles, the small wrapped box in his pocket, the proposal.
Maybe it’s all about the small gestures, a position where your body is comfortable, in which you can rest your limbs, a smile aimed to show empathy and kindness towards the next person, a tug to your heart when you feel out of place.
“What are you hiding from me, Castiel?”
It’s not love what bonds one to the other, it’s not the simple and bare emotion of fondness, of lust and passion that ties their souls together and Sam is well aware of that.
Castiel suddenly widens his eyes and lets the cloth drop on the floor.
“Get him off me!”
Dean just looks up from the papers he’s holding between his hands and gulps steadily.
“I love you.”
“Emotions, Empathy… are not for angels.” Dean closes his eyes and his lashes flickers against his cheeks. “Then why,
“It’s none of your business.”
“Yes, Dean?” he answers easily, without losing the smug on his face.
“Maybe I did quote Game of Thrones after all.” he sentences before taking the controller back, starting to zap again between the channels.
.” his tone is steady and calm, secure. “You were right before, Dean. I’m not a human anymore, I’m an angel now and I cannot change whom I am with a snap of my fingers.” his words stop flowing for a single moment. “Yet
Cas’ attention is reclaimed by a jab in his ribs, he turns around and meeting Sam’s eyes he presses his lips.
“Trust me, I know. Good old Cassie used to disappear for hours when we were in Heaven together.” A small nostalgic smile appears on his lips. “I used to find him in front of old dusty shelves, looking for these huge ancient volumes.”
The door closes loudly behind his back.
“How do you choose then?”
It’s like when you hear a faint sound, muffled by the walls that surround you, and you open your ears to catch the notes, trying to sort through what you’ve learned during your music lessons to recognize the melody.
Sometimes it seems that the tune that vibrates through your eardrums is off-key and that who’s playing the instrument of his life isn’t even trying.
Cas can see the couple hidden behind the column giggle happily.
“Thank you.” He murmurs before getting up, briefly looking at him as he takes a step forward ready to go. Balthazar opens his mouth, about to say something else but the phone in Castiel’s pocket starts to ring. “Sorry, I have to take it.” The name ‘Dean’ is flashing on the screen and Castiel tightens his lips, before pressing the green button to take the call.
It starts with two big sphere, one next the other.
“Sam is gone, Dean.”
Cas lowers is head in agreement and shyly peeks at his cards, noting satisfied his hand.
“What happened?” he looks at them confused but Balthazar just moves his hand, dismissing his questioning gaze with a gesture. “Dean left the shack in a hurry. I don’t even know where he went.” Balthazar sees the way Castiel’s eyelids tremble when he closes his eyes trying to compose himself. He ignores the pang of pain in his chest.
be removed so that we-“
He suddenly open his eyes. The white ceiling is staring at him back and the only noise Dean feels is his hand letting go of the white sheets. He's in the dark of his room and Cas is not there. A single tear escapes from his eyes, but he wipes it away furiously. If he focuses enough he can still feel his touch against him, but Cas is dead and Dean is alone now.
Dean’s hand is burning against Cas’ side, but what makes him shiver the most is when Dean rests his cheek against his, delicately swinging and breathing against his ear.
That’s it.
“Because I need comfort, because I need love. Because they’re not-“ Dean stares at him. “Because they’re not whom I need the most.”
“Dean.” Castiel says and Balthazar stares at him thoughtfully, studying his stiff posture. “Yes.” His left foot is slightly tapping on the green trimmed grass. “Ok.” He pinches his nose and Balthazar raises his eyebrows. “Got it, see you soon.” Castiel closes the call and Balthazar gets up, taking his decision.
“She’s a
“Ok, ok.” Dean raises his hands in defeat and focuses his gaze on the tiny furball that now has closed his eyes, enjoying the scratching. “That’s Peanut.”
It’s during the second line that everything is thrown into chaos.
“You did not.”
His heart is heavy in his chest.
His expressions is fond.
“Do you remember?” he whispers against his ear, his breath is hot against his skin. “Do you remember the war?” Castiel shivers and tilts his head, offering his neck to Balthazar. He starts to kiss it. “Do you remember the way you used to scream my name?”
He uses the softest hint of nails against his skin and Castiel’s lips slightly open. He takes a strand of his hair, letting it slowly slide between his fingers, and his neck bends towards him. Castiel moans and Dean coughs. Sam has to call him twice before he starts to talk again.
Maybe is the fond smile that paints his lips, that lingers on his expression, making it softer, more vulnerable.
He just stares at the hard and brown wood of the door, holding his breath and tightening his fists along his sides.
He loses himself in the feeling of his slightly chapped skin. He grazes with his tongue his bottom lip and Cas moans taken aback when Dean pulls at his hair. Cas puts a knee between his legs and deepens the kiss. Dean pushes back against the rising pressure on his hardness, trying to chase the pleasure. It's when Cas stills his movements that Dean moans in loss.
“No, I won’t.” Balthazar gets up too and drags him outside the room. Their figures are hidden by the shadows in the corridor.  “I won’t leave it. Not when I see the way he treats you.” Balthazar ignores his glare and keeps on talking. “You’re far better than him, Castiel. Don’t let him destroy you.” He opens his mouth to reply but suddenly Balthazar joins their lips in a frantic kiss, laving with his tongue his sensible skin, and Castiel just moans, running his hands through his hair and asking for more.
“It’s a song. ‘Baby, it’s cold outside.’ It’s from the 40’s.” Dean simply answers, switching the radio off and immerging the room into a complete silence. “Maybe we should go to bed. It’s pretty late. I think that when Jack and Sam will wake up tomorrow, they’ll be pleased with how the tree has turned out.” He says, switching the lights off and only leaving the Christmas tree’s ones on.
Cas pulls at his own cock and buckles slightly, Dean’s cock slips from his lips and Dean whimpers in need, widening his eyes and staring at him in despair.
His shoulders sag down, and he nods once.
“I’ll take it as a no.” Castiel turns around and reaches for the door, ready to leave the room, but Balthazar just grabs his arm, stopping him. His fingers trace the length of the sleeve of his trench coat before enclosing his wrist in an iron grip.
, all their temptations, all their pitfalls.
Sam and Dean have stopped talking and now they’re busy with their own tasks. Balthazar ignores Dean, sitting a few feet away and pretending to be cleaning his gun. His stance is stiff and his eyes are too focused on the barrel when he wipes the cloth around the cold metal. He’s listening to them.
That’s why they kiss, that’s why they need to feel human through their bodies.
“Leave me alone, Balthazar.” Castiel frees himself from him and closes the book before getting up. The chair makes some noise when its legs scratch the floor and Sam just gives them a brief look before starting to skim over the led of his iPad. Dean doesn’t pull a muscle.
His heart starts beating against his chest. He stops to breathe for one single moment. Everything is clouded in his mind. Dean’s ears are red at the tips and his mouth is closed in a soft line.
Dean stretches his hand as if to reach him.
There’s a framed picture next to the tree, right between the two snow globes Garth gave them as housewarming gift the week before. It was taken two years ago, during their first date. They had been so shy that night, they didn’t even dare to hold hands during the movie they went to watch. The only thing that Cas can remember about that day is the constant drumming of his heart against his chest and the nervous giggle that escaped his mouth as soon as he kissed Dean on the cheek, before running towards the apartment he shared with Balthazar. Dean’s confused expression on his face had soon turned into a big grin as he turned over the engine of the Impala.
“I love you.”
“You should ask him.”
But what does being human mean?
“Just one, please.” Cas answers back, giving up his Jack and receiving in exchange a queen of clubs that he puts proudly between two cards.
His breath is hard.
He briefly looks at him and then shakes his head, lying down on his cot with a dangling leg that brushes the floor.
.” His lips curl malevolently around his name while the angel looks at him stunned. “You know nothing, Castiel.
“It was mine and Balthazar’s hideout.” Dean stills his movements and looks at him, but Castiel is still giving him his shoulders. “We used to come here whenever Heaven sent us on Earth to carry out a military mission. It was our safe place.” Castiel turns around and offers him a tired smile. “Then he faked his death for years and all this was left to rotten.” He whispered, before kicking a small piece of glass out of the way.
feel it.
Castiel composes himself and in the blink of an eye is expression is stoic again, detached and unbothered. Balthazar notices the change in his demeanor and walks past the sofa to reach him. He rests a hand on his back and smirks at Dean when Castiel doesn’t shift to avoid the contact. Dean is fuming now and it’s with a renewed sense of satisfaction that he turns his face to Castiel and waits for his answer.
“You were just doing-“ he shakes his head in disbelief, incapable to finish his words, and then his grasp on his collar intensifies when he sees the look of defiance in Dean’s eyes. “You’ve just got a hero complex, Dean.” he spits his words venomously. “You’re just an asshole full of his ego that thinks the world rests on his shoulders.” he hisses against him, giving him another shake that makes his head bump against the wall.
Everything’s quiet around him and the soft thumps against his skin are constant and resolute.
Dean offers him his hand and Cas just stares at it confused.
Dean gasps for air and Castiel just goes down his neck, biting him and kissing open-mouthed his jaw, liking a long strip of skin and making Dean tremble.
Dean smiles bitterly.
Dean stretches his hand, trying to reach for him, but he’s interrupted by a flapping noise.
Dean’s hand starts brushing his hair and Cas closes his eyes.
His fast steps resound in the night and when he finds a streetlight, Cas puts his hand on the pole, breathing raggedly.
Dean slips his fingers in Castiel’s pants and takes his cock with his hand, slightly stroking it and smearing the pre-come to lube his shaft.
“What about those bags? What are they?”
Yet for the first time in his entire existence he keeps his eyes closed and lets himself be lulled by the warmth of another human being.
“Dean, where the hell have you been?” Sam asks worried, dropping his notes on the table and suddenly getting up, glaring at him.
“Dean.”
“Excuse me? I’m here in the room too, if you haven’t noticed.” Balthazar glares at him and Dean holds his gaze, thinning his lips and refusing to back up from the challenge.
Dean’s hips stutter for one brief moment before he spills inside him.
Earth, twenty-first century, judging by the wind brushing the treetops and the horns of the cars honking out of control, Kansas.
He reaches him.
“You’ll know when the moment’s right. You’ll know.”
Kissing is a natural human instinct, yet it felt
“He’s just bored. Aren’t you?” he softens his voice. “Who is a good boy, uh?” Peanut closes his eyes, enjoying the petting. “Yes, Peanut. You’re a good boy, aren’t you? Aren’t you?”
He starts to remove all the decorations from the tree.
Kissing is a human behavior that requires a muscular coordination involving the use of thirty-four facial muscles and more than a hundred postural ones.
As soon as Dean sits besides him, Cas clearly tenses, not moving his gaze from the floor and slightly jolting when Dean’s knee brushes against his.
With his back resting on the mattress Dean starts to unbutton his shirt, groaning when Cas takes his lobe between his teeth, thrusting again and feeling their bulges grow harder one against the other.
“You should go slower with that stuff.” Sam murmurs, continuing to tap on his tablet without raising his gaze from the led.
“What?” Dean asks him, looking back and raising his eyebrows questioning. “Have I got something on my face?” he starts to scratch his left cheek annoyed. “I do, don’t I? I hate this sensation, when you feel something that is brushing your skin when there’s actually
“Yes.”
Dean stares at him with his green and blown out irises, thinning his lips in pain when Castiel slowly lays down his body on his lap, hovering with his hands on the wound.
“He had a good reason, Dean.”
Dean’s eyes are closed, his lips are chapped, but stretched in a peaceful expression.
Dean gives him a playful push with his shoulder and Sam laughs when he notices the confused expression on his face.
“Just answer me.” Dean approaches him. “Do you trust me?”
“What happened, Sheriff Logan?” Sam asks him, eying his name on the distinctive.
Sam clears his throat and a little smirk takes place on his face.
“Cassie, to what do I owe the pleasure?”
He’s a work of art, of this Cas has always been certain; his shiny lips, his narrowed eyes, prey of the pleasure, his salty skin and the musky taste Cas has on his tongue is what brings him to stretch a hand and cup his balls, making Dean jolt in surprise, sliding a finger furthermore.
Castiel shuts his eyes closed when he grazes the bulge in the front of his pants and buckles back lost in sensation when his cock twitches against his own hand, making him whine in need.
Castiel can still feel the warmth of Dean’s fingers pressed against his wrist when he walks side by side with him.
“And have I talked you about the wheel? I bought the biggest they had because the salesman said that you must be careful about the size. If it’s too tiny it could-“
The hunt’s over and Sam and Dean are long gone. They’re alone, in their shack. Next to what they used to call their nest. Broken glasses are on the floor, survivors of the nights in which the desperation clawed at his heart when he thought that he was dead.
It felt so wrong when all Cas could think in that moment was that he was cold and that no one was there to warm him.
“Yes, Cas.” Their gazes meet and Dean nods steadily when he feels Cas’s hand supporting his body when he’s on his legs, still slightly wobbly when he takes a step forward.
The silence stretches between them for a long minute before it’s broken by Dean’s muffled words.
The silence fills the room and when Sam thinks that Cas won’t talk again, he’s snapped back by his low voice, toneless and tired.
A brief moment passes.
The need to use it on those humans is throbbing in his veins more than ever.
“Please.”
Castiel drinks out of the bottle, swallowing loudly the amber liquid that swirls within the green glass and spreading his arms as soon as Dean puts foot inside the room.
Cas snaps his eyes back on Dean’s and he stares at him confused while he gets up and reaches for him.
He’s staring at him with his green irises when Castiel sits beside him. Their bodies almost touch, a spark of electricity flows between them and they’re both unable to shift away. They both linger in the warmth.
A sudden laugh erupts from Dean’s chest, making Cas stop his movements altogether.
Cas bites his lower lip and stares with wonder at the Christmas tree leaning against the wall. He starts pacing the room, his eyes lost in the light show of blue and red created by the strings hanging on the paintings. There are small bulbs flickering between the leaves, casting a bright and luminous shade on the parquet.
He takes it from his hands and he lets it slip in his coat, his jaw clenched in some unspoken feeling.
Every single human has its place in the product of the Creation.
Castiel just nods.
He stares straight in his eyes and with one swift movement he imprisons with his hand his wrists above his head, not caring if his arms could be scratched by the wall.
“You saved yourself from the sight of what it was before, man.” Dean gulps the drink and gets up; the back of his hand brushes slightly against Cas’ trench coat. “Let’s say that ‘Extreme Makeover Home Edition’ would never, like ever, hire Sam and Jack into its society.”
“They’re waiting for you.” Dean clenches his fist and taps his right foot on the ground, anger simmering under his skin. “Castiel’s waiting for you.” He whips his head and glares at him, meeting for the first time his eyes. Balthazar doesn’t dodge his gaze and holds it, accepting the silent conversation that is flowing between them.
Sam scoffs and shaking his head snatches away the remote from Dean’s hands, leaving him wordless.
Cas’ hand tightens around Dean’s when he lowers and gets closer.
A bitter chuckle bursts from his chest and then Dean coughs, the sudden lack of air in his lungs making him jolt away in discomfort.
He nods at intervals, showing his sympathy, and when she breaks out and drags him down to hug him in tears looking for some support, Cas detaches his gazes from the scene, feeling a low tug in his chest and a sense of discomfort.
Castiel can’t forget the way his chin used to hook on his right shoulder, his breath softly brushing the nape of his neck and the goosebumps that used to scatter all over their skin when he intertwined their fingers during those nights when they felt too alone.
Dean’s smile is pained.
"I hope you'll forgive me one day, Dean. I really do hope it." Cas sighs and prays to a God he should’ve served, instead of betraying everything he’s ever been taught.
Dean is holding his breath and his lips are closed in a flat thin line. He’s thoughtful as he stares in front of him, in his eyes a dim glint of something that Balthazar can’t exactly pinpoint. Dean exhales from his nose before giving him an answer.
“You’ll lose him.”
At times Sam feels out of place when he looks at them, when he watches the way they stitch their souls back together and hears the whispers and the soothing words that are meant just for their own hearts.
Dean’s hand is still tight around Castiel’s bicep, the skin under the trench coat seems to be burning as Castiel feels the pressure of his grip. Dean’s breathing is heavy as he tries to inhale more air than he can. Castiel softly touches his chin, making him raise his head and Dean just stares at him confused, feeling the soft pressure dwelling. Castiel takes a step back, ignoring the itch under his fingertips, and leaves him more room to breathe.
“At least
Castiel moans when Dean gives another thrust and with one swift motion he cups Dean’s face, tilting it towards his head and conjoining their lips again, making Dean pant for the surprise.
The first notes of ‘Let it snow’ flow inside the hall while Dean is sitting on one chair, with his chin resting on his arms and an annoyed frown on his face.
“We?” Sam asks, observing the angel with prying eyes. “When did Cas exactly become a we?” Balthazar can feel Castiel’s back stiffen under his hand and he just let it drop along his side, taking a step forward.
It all happens in one moment. He meets his blue irises, that are staring at him with such longing and regret that Dean feels his heart clench in his chest.
“Useful as always, buddy.” he teases him with the smile still on his lips.
His left hand lingers against his right shoulder, caressing his skin through the thin fabric of his white shirt.
"I can't give up on you, Cas. I just can't." His voice is verging on the desperation and Cas can clearly see the way he’s breaking him.
When Dean enters into Cas’ room, he’s sitting on the bed with his white crumpled shirt half-opened.
They sit in a companionable silence for a while, the only noises are the ones that come from a television left turned on with a volume too loud in some apartment.
"I'm sorry, Dean."
Cas is-
He takes another gulp when Dean ignores him, dropping the duffle bag on the ground and crouching to untie his shoes.
Castiel gasps and suddenly jerks away, staring in horror at Dean that looks at him dazed.
“I love you too.”
Dean stops his steps and stares at him without any expression.
Sam has learnt the hard way that the smallness of their perspective is what really stops humans from feeling the way Dean and Castiel
They lock eyes for a single moment and Dean closes his mouth mid-sentence, but then Sam starts to talk again and he shifts his gaze to look at him.
Sam and Jack just shrug then and taking a step forward they pass through a door.
“The shack.” His voice is shaking when Dean finds the strength to break the silence. “It was your safe house, your safe place.” He looks at him, thinning his lips before speaking his next words. “Why did you leave him?” Balthazar ignores the pounding of his heart against his chest. He didn’t think that after all this time it would’ve hurt so fucking much.
“Where are we?” he asks, noticing the old neglected walls and the broken glasses on the floor. “It’s a safe house?”
Dean grabs Cas’ wrist, trying to soothe him.
Suddenly he feels Dean’s fingers between his hair and when his face is raised by the spot of skin he was torturing he meets his eyes, full of fondness and affection.
“I owe you an apology, yes. After all you were right,
Dean fixes the void in front of his eyes for a single moment.
“I don’t know if you’re aware, pal, but our life has never been a simple one.”
“Cas-“
The hormones strike, your eyes become shiny and dizziness takes control of your body: you can’t control yourself.
The blinding smile Sam gives him warms his heart.
A sudden laugh escapes Dean’s lips and when he suddenly gets up, cracking and beating on his own chest incapable of stopping, Castiel stares at him weirded out.
Cas gets up too and reaches him, placing a hand on his lower back and squeezing his left side. Dean inwardly smiles and just stares at the guinea pig, that now is busy nibbling something with his sharp teeth. He feels Cas dropping his chin on his shoulder and so he leans against his chest.
His worst fate would’ve been living with the knowledge that he broke Dean Winchester for the rest of his days.
“You didn’t seem disgusted when I blew you the other night.” Castiel crawls towards him again and with a push of his hand he makes him lie down, straddling his hips and grinding against his hardening cock. “What? Have I ruined you for all the others, Winchester?” he whispers an inch away from his mouth, licking his lips mischievous. “Risa leaves you unsatisfied, doesn’t she?” Castiel grinds down again with more strength, making Dean gasp in surprise. “I bet she can’t make you come like I do.” He murmurs before joining their mouths.
He suddenly gets quiet and widens his eyes when he sees Cas’s amused expression. Peanut is no longer in his arms, but comfortably resting in his tiny house. He’s almost asleep.
He can feel his cock growing against his palm and when Cas raises his gaze his eyes are watery and glossy.
“Back in Kansas-“ Dean raises his head and turns toward him. “When I saw that man getting-“ Cas takes a deep breath “getting emotional, I-“ his hands shake in agitation. “I was paralyzed.” his words are just a whisper in the wind.
Cas clings desperately at his shoulders and makes their chests collide when Dean repeats the gesture, making his cock twitch in response.
“Cas, first of all for the hundredth time: you
The crash that follows doesn’t make him remotely flinch and when Castiel throws away the remnants of the bottle, scratching the sole of his feet without wincing, he simply thins his lips.
“He shouldn’t have done that.” Dean breaks the silence, wiping away some oil remnants on his pink lips, totally missing the red stain. “He shouldn’t have gone after her.” he exclaims angrily, meeting Cas’ eyes.
His fingers are restless on the top of his thigh and when he tries to smooth away a crease on the fabric of his trousers he inhales with his nose, finding a whine stuck in his throat.
“That wasn’t fair.”
Dean pushes inside him and Castiel bites his lips in pain, but he pushes back trying to accommodate more of Dean.
“Should have I kissed Chastity, back that day?”
Dean throws himself in the explanation of the case and Sam tags along, while Castiel listens to them with attention. Balthazar has to fight himself for not pulling out his angel blade.
“Come for me.”
Dean arches his back when Cas’ hands rest on his bulge, moaning loudly when his fingers bend slightly increasing their pression; his eyes are blown wide, full of lust and need, its black pupils shiny with want and reduced to just a small green ring.
When Dean’s lips close around his fingers a loud moan escapes from his throat, making him dizzy. His vision blurs and when he meets Dean’s eyes he can’t distinguish its outlines. He gapes when his tongue lavishes around his fingertips and groans when Dean scratches at him with his teeth, making him tremble again.
Cas gets up and starts fidgeting with the small wrapped box he has in the left pocket of his jeans. His heart is hammering against his chest just like that time and it’s with a sigh that he goes in front of the mirror, trying to adjust his eternal messed up hair without success. He sighs again.
to be lived, what makes a life
Cas follows and when Dean lies down on the bed he pats a spot on the mattress.
He can’t see through the veil of dampness.
“Peanut.” Dean nods seriously, thinning his lips anxious when he meets his eyes. “I might have seen an online ad where there was this sweet old lady that wanted to give him in adoption.”
“We can’t let him go, Sam.” Cas shakes violently and Sam’s hand trembles around his skin, making him gasp in surprise. “Sam-“ he looks him into his eyes and when he sees his pupils shiny with tears, he pulls him away, snatching his arm free.
“Dean-“ Castiel shouts and runs towards him, kneeling in front of his bent figure and reaching for the handle of the blade, brushing with trembling fingertips the cold metal. “What have you done?”
Castiel looks at him outraged, squinting his eyes insulted.
is what
Dean is in front of him, a burger between his hands and his lips stained with a splotch of red sauce, -maybe ketchup, after all Dean himself said that ketchup could be considered a vegetable-, and a somber look on his face.
“I wish-“ Dean takes a deep breath and then lowers his hand, reaching for the knob. “Sometimes I just wish you could be
“I love you."
The coroner-
They don’t simply perceive the way the world is shaped, they don’t conform their sentiments to the way men conceive.
“Just take him out of the cage, Cas!” in less than the blink of an eye Cas opens the cage and picks him up, holding him tight against his chest. Dean shakes his head, a happy glimmer inside his eyes. “Wait, I have to show you something. Put a Christmas playlist on!” Dean turns his back to them, starting to rummage in the bags.
Where Cas will never be able to hear him.
A single tap on the back of his hand makes him move his gaze away from the couple.
He doesn’t mean to stay there watching, yet his body is grounded on the cement under his feet; his pulse is elevated and his heart is beating furiously against his ribcage.
“You know what?” Sam gets up enraged by his brother’s words and glares at him. “Go on. Be the usual dickhead you are, avoid sentiments, avoid feelings and don’t you ever try to face a problem pulling out your balls. Hide and flee as well. That’s the only thing you know how to do after all, isn’t it?” he reaches for the knob of the door. “Talk with Cas. Talk with him and for once in your life try to see another person’s reasons.” he murmurs before leaving the room.
His breath itches in his throat and Cas gulps down the bile rising in his chest, a sudden tremor makes his hand jolt.
“Shut up, Dean.” Cas presses his palm on his mouth and the tears starts to stream copiously on his face when he bumps their foreheads again one against the other. “Just… shut up.”
“The blade must be removed and then-“
“I tried to reach him, Sam.” Cas says, avoiding Dean’s gaze glued to his figure. “Yet I caught him in an apparently pleasurable intercourse with Chloe that I felt better not to stop.” he finishes, feeling the weight of Sam’s judgment on him.
“Why did you do that?”
Happiness is a weird feeling, yet Cas sometimes wishes he could
Castiel takes a step forward, clearing the space to the door, and the women leave the room. Their giggles and hiccups are loud as they walk down the stairs, probably looking for some other guest to entertain.
A flapping harsh noise and Dean doesn’t even have time to raise his head before something brushes his hair. He jolts and jumps out of the sofa. He meets Balthazar’s amused eyes who is staring at him with a weird glint in his irises.
He brushes his hair asides and then puts a palm over his heart, gently holding his head with his left hand.
“Ask me.”
“Well, if that’s so…” Dean lowers his hand “Three of a kind. Always said that women love me.” he says, pointing at the three queens in front of him. “What about you, Cas?” he asks slyly, resting one hand on top of the other. “Amaze me.”
“What do you mean, Cas?”
Cas gulps steadily and then shifts his feet, bumping against the leg of the table.
“Baby.”
“You panicked, didn’t you?”
“Yes.”
"We could be better together. You and I.” he looks at him, pleading him with his eyes. “It could work. I’m tired of losing people, Cas. We deserve to be happy for one fucking time. I want to be selfish. This time
They start to dance.
His hand trembles and Balthazar can feel a tightness in his chest when he sees Dean’s hands getting gentler when he softly brushes the tangled lines engraved on the plate.
“Dean, DEAN-“ Sam’s arms block Dean in time before he could hit him. “She would have killed herself the same. Maybe not that day, but she would’ve done it.” Sam tries to reason, while Dean tries to pull himself free from his grip.
Castiel gets on his knees and Dean grabs him, clinging in desperation and sticking his nails into the soft skin of his arm.
“Balthazar.” He grits his teeth but the other angel just shakes his head, moving closer to the king sized bed at the center of the room. He grabs a white cotton tunic and flattens a non-existent crease on it before wearing it. “
When Dean enters into his room without knocking, Cas unglues his eyes from the angel’s blade.
“Let’s go find your friends.” Castiel widens his eyes and he doesn’t even have time to say a word before Balthazar teleports them again.
Dean sheepishly rubs the back of his neck and doesn’t meet his eyes when he invites him to sit down on the sofa. Cas complies and places the guinea pig between his legs, careful to not make him escape again.
“Before the hunt began you asked me what happened to me.” Castiel starts, taking a step forward. “You’re right. I’m different now.” Balthazar nods yet he doesn’t say a word, he just stares back, giving him all the time he needs. “I-“ Castiel takes a deep breath and shifts his gaze, trying to compose himself to not break down. Balthazar puts a hand on his shoulder, grounding him. Like he has always done. “I’ve found a meaning.” He raises his irises and pleads him with his eyes. “I’ve finally found myself, Balthazar.”
show your hands to your opponents
“Why?”
“Who you must kiss.”
“He’s like Sammy. They love books.” His voice is rough when he pushes the words out of his mouth and yet it’s soft at the same time. Balthazar’s finger slightly twitches against his own knee.
“What did you feel?”
“It’s Greek yogurt, that’s why you don’t like it.” Dean pulls a face and Sam just shrugs, before taking another spoonful.
And it's in that exact moment that Castiel suddenly understands that his life is about to falling apart.
“It’s warmer inside,” Cas’ breath is shallow with his next word. “
"After everything we've been through, don't you think that-"
“You didn’t deserve this, Jimmy.”
A cold cloud of breath leaves Cas’ lips.
can’t be summoned up in one single word.
His steps resound in the woods when he turns around and takes the path to return to the shack. Dean just stares at his back for one single moment, before getting up and reaching him.
“That’s exactly what I’m waiting for.” He raises his left finger and arches his eyebrow mockingly, reaching him with two steps and putting the palm of his hand on Dean’s thigh, tracing the seam of his trousers with one finger.
“What are you gonna do, Cas?” Dean wiggles his eyebrows, leaning his face on one hand and staring at him challenging. “Are you gonna call?”
That stays silent when the wind seems to whisper in Castiel’s ear “We forgive you”.
Cas smiles too and his fingers twitch slightly when he grabs the drink that Sam’s offering him. He feels Dean’s eyes on his figure when he takes the first sip of his beer. He pulls a face at the bitter taste.
Dean spins him around again, but now Cas is prepared when their chests collide again and their eyes meet.
Dean lowers his gaze.
“Come here, I’ll hold you.”
Dean pulls out a cage from one of the bags and softly places him inside it. He turns around to look at Cas and crosses his arms on his chest.
“Cash, Cas. We’re talking about cash. Now take your goddamn cards between your hands and let’s play, for God’s sake.”
“It’s my business when you’re willing to risk your own life and to jeopardize everything just for a couple of dumbasses. For a couple of humans!” He murmurs the word with loath and Castiel just moves a hand, dismissing him. “Tell me, Castiel.”
The skin of his hand is rough against himself, that’s why he suddenly snatches his hand away and licks his own palm, settling it back immediately and groaning loudly when he pumps his cock faster.
” Dean flares, meeting his brother’s careful glance.
Yet the lights are flicked on and Dean suddenly moves away, staring at Sam in the distance.
The tilting, the clatter of glasses full of liquor and the chatters as backgrounds don't do anything to silence the hammering of his heart in his ears. Castiel can feel every single pulse, every single beat carving in his veins, tracing a route towards his brain, leaving him dizzy and weirdly excited.
“Cas-“
The silence, the small bubble of intimacy that is wrapping their figures, the way Dean’s eyes light up whenever he tries to do something human. It just feels right.
Castiel closes his eyes.
He’s more human than ever.
He grazes at his rim and feels the tender skin of his body.
“Will you listen to me?” he snaps, crossing his arms on his chest and raising a judging eyebrow, watching carefully his brother sprawled on the bed.
Their crotches are joined and their movements are frantic and desperate.
“Wait here.”
“Right now?”
Their bodies just an inch apart.
He pleads him and shakes his head in resignation when he hears Dean’s next words.
A small and bitter smile pulls at his mouth.
“Let me.”
“She’s dangerous.”
He has goosebumps on his skin when he feels Dean’s breath against his mouth.
“You did this for me?” Dean silently nods and intertwines their fingers, finally finding courage to raise his gaze and meet his eyes. Cas feels his heart grow two size bigger when he feels his thumb softly tracing a pail vein on the back of his hand.
Sam raises an eyebrow, taking up his bottle again and glaring at Dean in the process.
"Cas-"
“I think he’ll take the time he’ll need.” he answers cryptically, making Dean cringe in disbelief and then snort loudly.
“And what a great piece I am.” Balthazar wiggles his eyebrow, but the only thing he receives in return is just another annoyed sigh.
“DEAN!”
His worst fate wasn’t being dragged away during one of the happiest moment of his life.
They don’t talk about that night, Cas doesn’t ask questions and Dean doesn’t provide answers, yet his eyes seem to trail the soft shape of his mouth when it curls around words that aren’t addressed to him, his eyes drink in the sight of his lips folded around the green bottle of the beer he sways down in too few gulps.
He knows when Dean’s lower lip trembles with excitement, waiting for him.
“Yes, yeah. He is.” Castiel suddenly gets up and leaves the room.
Sam swallows and approaches him trying to soothe his anger.
He feels cold, yet the wind is just a cool breeze that brushes against his dark hair.
“Yes, Dean. Yes.” Cas snaps. “Just turn up the volume, will you?”
Sometimes pictures of his past life brutally flow inside his head, calling to memory loved features with their soft eyes and sweet lips.
Dean shakes his head.
The door suddenly opens and Cas jolts back.
“Why do you have it?”
Dean has difficulty to focus on his words.
Their crotch makes contact and Castiel drops his head for the sensation, feeling a lower pressure beginning to stir in his belly.
Sam and Jack have Christmas hats on, and they’re surrounding the giant fir near one of the walls, trying to mount the lights.
“He’s lost, Dean. He’ll never return to you.”
Jimmy Novak should have been a simple man and he would have been, yet one day Castiel had stolen his body and suddenly Jimmy Novak just stopped to exist.
“I love you.” He murmurs breathless and Dean clenches his eyes, a low whimper escaping from his mouth. He turns his head away, trying to hide himself, but Cas puts a hand on his cheek. A slight pressure and Dean gives his in, meeting his gaze. Cas is staring at him as if he hung the moon and Dean gulps, incapable to accept all the adoration that radiates from his eyes. He never looks away.
human.”
He’s sweating, his eyes are shiny and he bites his own lips stifling a moan when he slips his hand inside his pants, brushing the hot skin of his cock with only one finger.
Cas just nods and then lets his gaze wander into the room.
“I cannot lose you.” He brushes softly the nape of his neck, calming the tremor of his shoulder with soothing and relaxing gestures, while with his right hand he starts to heal his wound.
“I-“ Dean stutters, scratching slightly his neck. “Yes, but it’s worth a try. Isn’t it?” he beams, giving him a pat on the back, leaving his left hand linger on his shoulder blade.
Dean scrapes his teeth against his hole and Castiel moans when he slips back two fingers, pushing and scissoring them without mercy.
Castiel bitterly smiles when he brushes his hair, softly caressing the side of his neck.
“Ok, let’s rock these holidays.”
“I miss him too.” He kisses his tears away and Dean just breaths harder, gripping tightly at his wrist and sinking his nails in the back of his hand. “
The wind rises and Castiel loses himself in the familiar fragrance of Balthazar’s scent. Home. Protection. Loyalty. He unclenches the fist he didn’t know he had tightened.
“Game of Thrones, dude. Seriously?”
"Yet something always seemed to miss. Something
“Absolutely no.”
The air seems to change and suddenly their movements are not frantic; he stops altogether his grinding and when Dean joins their lips again and nibbles gently at his lower lip, Castiel freezes, feeling his heart lose a beat when he feels the soft brush.
A sudden pressure on his right shoulder makes him spin around, enclosing him in the cage his eyes create.
“Your hands aren’t cold anymore.” Dean states, swaying again and stopping for a brief moment his movements when Cas leans more against him.
A small smile pulls at his lips, making him giggle like a child when he remembers the scene.
Yet it doesn’t make it less painful.
“I’ll come.”
He leaves him alone and Dean just stares at him as he silently approaches Castiel. Sam sits beside him and drops his duffle bag on the floor, starting to talk again about the case.
“What?”
“Why me?”
“I- You had a stain of ketchup and...”
He grips his hair hard and Dean moans too, gripping tightly his wrist and shutting his eyelids.
Cas nibbles at his lip and then he suddenly licks into his mouth, not asking for permission, feeling Dean’s hands fight against his grip and his stretched crotch moving forward, trying to look for some friction.
“Where are they, Chloe?” she giggles and Cas feels a bitter taste in his mouth when a shuffling noise reaches his ears. “Are they here, by any chance?” more ruffling, a loud moan and Cas opens his mouth trying to regain his breath. “Or here?” a button is pulled out and a zip is lowered. “In your
He’s near, he can feel the rising pression against his lower abdomen, making him shake in despair; with his thumb touches the slit of his cock repeatedly, feeling the blood pumping into his ears.
Balthazar widens his smile and slightly turns to the other guests in the room, never leaving Castiel’s eyes. “Girls,” his mouth slowly forms the world, tasting every single syllable “could you please leave us alone?”
The loud chatters around them is occasionally disturbed by the clinking of the glasses served at the tables.
The first line is completed effortlessly, blue and silver decorations are alternated on each branch and Dean declares himself satisfied from his position.
He takes a step back, trying to take as much detail as possible in, and sits on the old and ragged brown sofa behind him. Cas lets his hand wander on the leather and softy smiles when his fingers bump against a small louse stitching.
Dean shrugs and leaves the cloth, taking a step forward.
“No.”
Its leaves are well-pointed, Dean notices when he observes the final result that is the hard wood resting on a little cube of cement, covered by a blue towel that brushes the pavement.
A sudden buzz against their pockets snaps them and when their eyes meet, an unsettled expression takes space on their faces.
Dean calls him and his heart loses a beat, before starting to run against his ribcage. Their knees brush one against the other and Castiel suddenly knows that he has just found his place in the world; he drinks in the sight of the man beside him before looking at Sam and nodding at what he’s saying.
is left unspoken, yet the silence that stretches between them after what hasn’t been said is deafening in Cas’ ears.
“Why do you kiss
Dean nods and then invades Cas’ space, never leaving his eyes.
“Choose what?”
“Fuck you, Cas.” Dean turns around and sinks more into the mattress, giving him his back.
“Are you kidding me, aren’t you?”
“You’re high,” Dean answers disinterested, putting his arm on his eyes to shield himself from the light. “and I don’t fuck the junkies.”
“Could we listen to it?”
“Are you aware that I cannot actually eat this anymore?” he asks, fixing Dean in the eyes and making him blush a little.
