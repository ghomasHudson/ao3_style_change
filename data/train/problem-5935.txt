Steve blinked at her.  “Ah.”
Tony's eyes slid towards Rogers, one eyebrow arching.  “Mmm?” he managed, not bothering to lower his cup.
Tony looked at the room.  It was large and airy, with big windows that looked out into the gardens below, the panes of glass sheltered by the heavy limbs of the oldest oak tree on the grounds.  The huge, four poster bed was covered in what seemed like a mile of snowy white linens, and the beautiful, ornate furniture matched the hand painted wallpaper perfectly.
The door opened, and Natasha slipped inside.  “Well, I hadn’t been planning to before, but now I’m having second thoughts,” she said as Rhodey choked on a laugh.  Her lips twitched. “Mr. Stane, your car has arrived.”
Something moved, just behind him, the scrape of something against the stone, and Steve moved before he’d even fully registered what he was doing.  In an instant, he’d spun to face the threat, angling his body in front of Tony’s, pushing him back against the side of the staircase with one arm.  Tony, caught off guard, stumbled backwards, and Steve was in front of him, free arm up and ready to strike.
There was a sudden, soft swirl of wind, and a pale red glow washed over the interior of the tunnel.  Clint tipped his head up just in time to see Jean float into view.  “I think you're scaring her, boys,” she said, even as one foot ghosted over the uneven floor.  She settled, one foot and then the other, her hands sweeping down to her sides before her hair swirled down around her shoulders, settling there in soft, gleaming waves.
DJ lowered himself down next to the cup, doing his best to put his legs where they should be, to follow the routine she'd laid out for him years before.  It never really got easier, but it was calming in its own way.  It was a way to think about things, in a structured way.  A hand.  An arm.  The angle of his back.  The way he held his chin.  The way his muscles pulled tight, then relaxed, each movement making things better.  Making it easier.
“No, but his Tony probably is,” Harris said.  Tony raised his head just far enough to glare in his direction, and Harris shrugged.  “Seems likely, that’s all I’m saying.”
“Love me?” DJ asked, interrupting him.
“Don't be ridiculous, why would you?  We will hire a bartender,” Jan told him.
Happy shrugged.  “Look, I know a man who's been places he shouldn't be, doing things he shouldn't be doing,” he said.  “See it often enough around here.  And I saw it last night.  Where ever he was, he wasn't on the clock, and he was lying about it for a reason.”
“Guess I scared ‘em,” Happy said, as a variety of thumps and bangs came from the other side of the door.  A moment of rattling locks and then the door was nudged open.
“All will be well.”  Thor walked in, Darcy draped over his back.  She was snoring, ever so quietly, her arms dangling over Thor’s shoulders to lay against his chest.  She was dressed in what looked like a fuzzy bunny onesie. Thor grinned at them.  “I have sausage and cheese, and fine bread, straight from my father’s stores.”
“Right,” Tony said, as Jarvis came up behind Jan, a small silver serving tray balanced on one hand.  “Jarvis, please remove this interloper from the property.”
“He’s not wrong,” Natasha said, her lips pursed around her straw.  She and Clint were sharing a Scorpion Bowl filled with milkshake.
“It doesn't bother you,” Miss Potts said, and it wasn't really a question, but Steve answered it anyway.
"I will punch you," Steve said, and Sam grinned.
“It’s…  It’s two,” he said.  He paused, his mouth working.  “How… Many have you done at once?”  He stopped.  “Wow. that came out wrong.”
Steve took a deep breath.  “Thank you, sir.  I think.”
“I…  I see, sir.”
“Thank you.”
There was no sign on the wall, or pointing the way.  There was just a row of unnumbered doors in an empty hallway.  Empty except for a single convention staffer, sitting there on a rickety folding chair, more focused on the phone in his hand than anything else that was happening around him.
DJ’s nose wrinkled as he thought about that.  “No?” he tried.
“I know that this is a refrain that you’ve heard a dozen times or more today,” Tony said, setting a bowl precisely in front of Rhodey, “but fuck if I know.”
“How's the Hulk?” Steve asked.
Tony paused.  "Well, if those are my only choices..."  He rocked back in his seat.  "What'd I do?"
“I think it’s the truth,” Tony said.  “And cold comfort that might be, but the only comfort I can offer.”
“The urge to just, you know, spit, is so hard to resist,” Steve said, just as Natasha entered the kitchen, shoving Tony along ahead of her.  Steve felt his face heat, and he ducked down behind his computer.
DJ flipped the page around and slapped his hands together, catching the coupon between his palms.
“All right, I'm not sorry at all, but you married him, you know-”
DJ took a breath, and when he exhaled, something went with it.  Something he couldn't define.  “I'm...  Gonna bot now,” he said, the words so hard that he could barely manage them.
“I do not think you’ve properly thought this through,” Nakia said.
She grinned.  “Both of us will.”  She took a step back, but didn’t pull her hand free of his.  “Thank you, Tony.”
It hit back.
O'Brien's mouth kicked up on one side.  "She's making a trip down to Hammer House.  And you're an expert in that particular rat's nest, so..."  His heavy fingers rattled against the arm of his chair.  "Your job is to go with her, make sure no one hassles her or her driver, and get her the hell out of our jurisdiction without any incidents."
Maguire gave Steve a speaking look out of the corner of his eyes.  “Gettin’ comfortable, are we, Rogers?” he asked, with a twist of his lips.  “Didn’t expect to find you outta uniform.  Thought you were on assignment, not vacation.”
Logan let out a snort.  “Six months?  You're not getting' off that light.  You'll be hearing about this for the next six years.”  He held out a hand.  “Name's Logan, kid.”
“Captain America can’t save Christmas,” Tony said.  “He thinks he can.  But he’s helpless in the face of the many challenges facing us in this difficult-”
Steve looked over at Tony, who was doing his best to ignore them both.  But he was clearly awake, his fingers flexing against his pillow.  Steve smiled down at him.  “Come on, Sleeping Beauty,” he said, affection and love curling through him like a physical warmth.  “Duty calls.”
“Looking for trouble?” Steve repeated.
“Okay,” DJ repeated.  “Can stay.”  He shook his head.  “I can stay?”
"I love how quickly you're backtracking here," Tony told him.  "Bruce.  Seriously?"
Steve took a deep breath.  “I didn’t, actually.”
The clerk reached for the door release, and Tony heard the door open behind him.  “Tony?”
Steve shook his head.  “Let’s leave the theological debate of the nature of suffering until another day, because I’m not-”  He tried for a smile, and it hung on his lips, uneven and broken.  “I can’t do anything for him, Tony.  And I’ve never been real…  Good at forced inactivity.”
“Happy will find him,” Bruce said, but Tony was already kicking the blankets off, struggling towards the edge of the narrow bed.
“At the very least, that wasn’t a no,” Natasha said.  “Which, in this case, is actually more important than a yes.”  She shook out the cloth between her hands, smoothing it flat before folding it neatly into a square.  She slid it into her apron pocket.  “Difficult, though.”
It was over as quickly as it had happened, the sound of the horn hanging in the air as the car shot past them.  An instant, and it was gone, going just as fast as they were, but towards the city instead of away from it.  Steve twisted in his seat, his hand braced against the dashboard, his heart pounding in his ears.  “Was that-”
She popped the cork.  “He’s quite clever, Officer.  Better watch yourself.” She gave him a look, her lashes sweeping low over her eyes.  “Once you get deep enough into the labyrinth, you might have a hard time finding your way back out.”
Harris glanced back at him.  “I don’t attract trouble,” he said, digging his wallet out of his pocket.
“I know.”  Tony pulled his shirt off, ignoring the way his back ached.  He tossed it in the general direction of the dresser.  “God.”  He rubbed at his shoulder, his fingers digging into the tense muscles there.  “No, Steve.  I don’t want you to sleep on the couch.  I’ve had my fill of sleeping alone for-.”  Forever, he wanted to say, but he knew better.  Not a smart thing to say, and he was, he’d always been told, a very smart man.  “For the foreseeable future.”  He looked up with a wry smile.  “Right now, my main regret is that the kid’s too big to come looking for a hug and a warm spot to crash.”
Tony pressed a finger to his pursed lips, his eyes narrowing.  “You make it work,” he said at last, his face softening.  He held Steve's eyes for a second longer, then turned away.  “Come on.  I haven't had my picture taken in at least ten hours; much longer and I'm going to go into withdrawal.”
He slipped out of his bedroom door, expecting to find darkness in the hallway beyond.  But light flowed along the polished wood floor from the living room at the center of the suite, and he followed it, his bare feet silent on the cold floor.  He braced a hand against the wall, his fingers tracing the length of the hallway, his heartbeat pounding in his ears.
“Jack of all trades, really.”  Without being asked, Clint handed over the cream pot before he tossed a heavy cast iron skillet onto the stove.  It hit like a brick, rattling the huge range.  He didn’t seem to notice.  “I have a lot of skills, and most of them…”  He spun a knife between his fingers, the blade a flash of metal and light.  “Come in useful here.”
"If anyone's really that eager to come attack a building of super heroes, I wish them luck," Tony said.  "I'm not getting involved, this suit was expensive, but most of these people hate dressing up and are looking for a reason to get rid of their suit jackets and heels; I wouldn't give them one, personally."
Steve leaned in, and now, Tony rocked back, his eyes wide.  “I don’t work for you,” Steve said, his voice dark.  “When I get new orders, I’ll follow them, but right now, I know what I’m here to do, and that is to keep you alive.” He stepped to the side, and Tony went with him, shock flashing over his features.  “Even if the one who poses the greatest threat to you right now is you.”
There was a faint buzz, and a click as the door unlocked.  Tony pushed it open.  "For you, Mr. Stark," the man said, "always."
“See?  Was that so difficult?” Tony asked her.  He leaned back against his desk, his hands braced on either side of his hips.  “It’s not that I’m flirting with him-”
“I love you, too, now go out there and trip over something so I can feel a little better about my disaster of an existence.’
A spike of guilt shot through him, and Steve turned on the sink, splashing water on his face and neck.  He caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror as he straightened up, and there was something haunted in his expression, a hollow, empty look to his eyes.  He looked away, reaching for his pants.
“Noticed,” DJ said.
"Mockery," Tony said, handing her a sheet of technical specs.  "All around me, nothing but mockery."
Steve tipped his chin up, letting him do it.  “I didn't want to lose anything.  It's a rental.”  Tony stopped giving him an incredulous look, and Steve grinned at him.  “Ready?”
Jarvis disappeared back up to the house, and Clint put a jar of pickles into the bag, then handed it over.  “Can you strap that-”
Tony groaned.  “I don't want to-”
Steve nodded.  “I’m not going far.”  He looked up, meeting Tony’s eyes.  “And I’ll be right back.”
“I have?” Steve asked.
“I love having my own theme song,” Jan said, darting into the living room, her arms full of clothes.  “Be right back, just running these down to the laundry room or the trash chute, which ever one I reach first.”
"No," O'Brien repeated, his tone bored.
Carol straightened up.  “Okay.  We can do this.”  She pumped one hand over her head.  “I declare us to be the Council of Lesbians, dedicated to getting you a date.”
“Hi,” he said.  “It’s Steve.  Steve Rogers?”
Steve gave him a look over the rim of the tub, and Tony’s lips twitched.  “How do you pack so much disapproval into a single look?  I’ve dealt with priests and politicians who would envy your ability to shrivel the heart of a sinner with a single glance.  It’s rather impressive, I don’t know-”
Steve's hand snapped out, his fingers slipping under Tony's chin, tipping it up.  He saw Tony's eyes go wide, saw his lips part, and then Steve was kissing him.
“You just try.  Every day.  You try to be a bit better than you were the day before.  You might not manage it every single day, but we become better by striving for it.  You can.  And you will.”  Jarvis stood.  “I do know one thing.”
Isaiah shrugged.  “Knew it?  I was counting on it.”  His eyebrows arched.  “If I wanted calm and cheerful, I’ve got two dozen or so board members who pride themselves on being proper, polite citizens, who find open debate distasteful and would certainly not dream of making a spectacle of themselves.”
“There was trouble at the university,” she said, and there was a faint tremor to her voice, her hands shaking as she helped him do up the buttons.  “Ty-”
“I am,” DJ said, and he meant it.  “Someone needs to tell Dad.  And not-  Not you,” he said to Stephen.  “He’ll understand…  Later.  But now.  Will be-  Will be mad.” Talking was exhausting and he hated it.  He wanted Jarvis, who understood him, who could help him find the right words and put them in the right order.  DJ shifted in his chair, his heels digging into the floor.
Laughing, Rhodey sat up.  "You know, we can-"
He wasn't sure how long he sat there, staring at nothing, before he heard the door to the private dining room open.  He straightened up, trying to force a smile onto his face.  "I'm sorry, I'm just going to-"
Tony stared up at him, his hair a tangled mess, his jaw rough with beard stubble, and so handsome it made Steve's chest ache.  “You realize if you don't tell me, I'm going to buy him with a plate of french fries and get the whole story, but it'll be from his point of view, so maybe it's better if you-”
"Really?" Steve asked him.
For a long, painful moment, Tony fantasized about just that.  About lifting his head just that inch, that fraction of an inch, and kissing him.  Kissing him until they both forgot where they were, forgot who they were, forgot all the reasons why this wasn't going to work, why they couldn't work together.
“No luck?” Happy asked, grinding out the cigar with the heel of his shoe.
"Yes." Steve smiled at him.  "Sorry."
“My parents were getting...  Threatening phone calls,” Callie said.  She paused, picking her way around a piece of concrete.  “'Cause of me.”  Clint looked back at her, and she stared at him, her face helpless.  “Because I'm a mutant.”
"I know."
Steve stared up at him, trying his best not to notice the sleek, strong lines of his arms and back.  "Mr. Stark, I'd like to take a look at the crime scene."
Tony studied him, his eyes sharp.  "Okay," he said at last.
“No, Peter's finding out where he lives,” Tony said.  “And I'm going to go make some pâte à choux.”
“Bet some of them have kids of their own.  But I bet you know best,” Steve said to Tony.   “That’d only make sense.  I mean, I’m sure none of them would be interested in seeing a show.”
“Still bad,” DJ said, sitting up.
Val's mouth went thin.  “And you were afraid of water,” she said, her knees coming up again.  The braid, abandoned, slid over her shoulder, the ends unraveling with the small movement.  Val buried her face behind her knees, her eyes peeking out over the top of them.
“Fuck you,” Steve said, the words thin and cold and so full of rage that he could barely force them out.
“And the new option: Natasha kills me in the back of a paddy wagon.”
“Because he knows you?” Steve guessed with a smile.
Steve nodded, and his thumb was sweeping back and forth, against the center of Tony’s palm.  “What do you want from me?”
“I will have you fired and replace you with a pretty boy who can use a telephoto lens properly,” Ellen said.  “You're the worst photographer.  I hate you.”
Steve grinned back.  “Good.  We're going skating in Rockefeller Center.”
“Oh, nothing good starts with those words.”
“I have come to meet your son, and he is as delightful a child as one could imagine,” Thor said.  He held the shoes over his head, frowning at them.  “These are horrible.”
“He try to bribe you to get you to steal my shirts again?” Clint asked.
Tony crossed his arms over his chest.  “Feel free to leave,” he said, his voice cutting.  “Not that you’ve ever needed my permission up to this point.”
“I know you’re there,” he said, and he knew it was a bluff.  But maybe he was alone in that.
Peter, for his part, took a nervous step back.  “It’s not going to work.”
Ellen let her head fall into her hands.  “Jesse-”
“How many couches are in this place?” Jan asked, rubbing her forehead.  “How many couches, and he looks at a pool table and goes, ‘yeah, that’s the ticket.’”
“I kept most of my prototypes at home,” Tony pointed out.  “The weapons, sure, that was all in the SI databanks, but not the new stuff.”
Steve opened his eyes, and stared, uncomprehending, at the plush expanse above him.
DJ giggled, one eye peeking out from under the folds.  “Thank.”  He scootched closer to Clint's side, curling up tight against him, and Clint moved his arm out of the way.  “Jarvis?”
“Please?” DJ repeated.
He arched away from the wall, his hips grinding against Steve's.  “Let's go back to your place,” he said, his voice throaty and low.
“I can do that.”  A fifth egg joined the other four, and Natasha glanced at Steve.  “Can you cut a few slices from that loaf of bread so we can start some toast?” she asked, her head bobbing towards it.  “There's a knife block on the cabinet, and you look like a man who can handle a blade.”
“If you’re going to the kitchen, yes, I’d like a bottle,” Harris said.  He smiled.  “I didn’t quite make it.”
DJ plopped down on the blanket next to Stark, his arms wrapped around the battered frame of the kite,.  He grinned at Stark,  his cheeks pink, his hair a wild tangle of locks, and his feet stained green from the grass.  "Fix it?" he asked.
Jan waited, hands on her hips, as everyone subsided, shuffling their chairs back into place, turning to face her.  “How do you do that?”
“Yes, he should have,” Iron Man said.  “And do you know why?”  DJ looked away, and Iron Man tried again.  “You know why.”
Tony’s jaw worked.  “Buy an orphanage?” he asked.  “Can you buy an orphanage?  Is that something that goes on the open market?”
Tony huffed out a sigh, and grabbed hold of the other side of the knot.  "Six," he said, ripping half of it away.
“Okay, okay, fine, cut it out.”  Clint rattled his fingertips against the plastic edge of the laundry basket.  “Tell you what.  You help me fold laundry this week, I’ll give you twenty dollars.  That sound fair?”
Tony paused, one eyebrow arching.  “I'm sensing some resentment here, I think-”
“He swears up and down that no one’s missing,” she said.  “At this point, I’d believe him.  They don’t know what happened, but they know that fire was deliberately set and they know we’re looking for something.”  She reached up, brushing her hair out of her face, and there was soot on her arm, black against her pale skin.  “Most of them probably think something’s been stolen.”
“Right.”  Steve's lips twitched.  “Clint got talked into Star Wars again, didn't he?”
Steve backed off, one step, then another.  “Yes,” he said, and he bent over to collect the remains of the paper.  “You always do.”  With a grin and a wink, he was jogging across the lobby, strips of paper trailing from his hand like streamers in his wake.

“Do not lose her,” Tony repeated, and hung up before Clint could tell him what he do with that request.  But judging by the sound of his text notifications kicking in, Clint wasn’t letting him have the last word.  Tony found that comforting, for some reason.
Tony plated up some bread, ignoring it when the fridge started beeping, angry about its own door.  “It’s the same amount of effort to make two sandwiches as it is to make one and unless I’m actively involved in making a sandwich, I don’t think of of food.  So it’s not like I’m going to make you dinner one night unless it’s an afterthought to my own dinner.”
“Guess the ghost probably won’t snore as badly as Steve does,” Bucky said, and Steve flicked his reins in his direction.  Laughing, Bucky held up a hand to ward him off.  “Truth hurts, don’t it?”
“I know.” Tony tried to take the apples from him, and Happy brushed past him.  “The irrigation system needs a little more adjustment, and I got sick of dragging things back and forth, when I knew I just had to go back.”
“We could have sex on it.”
He grabbed Sam’s arm, shoving him towards the mistletoe.  “Ring the mistletoe.”
Another nod.  “Love you,” DJ said.
“Thank you.  I appreciate your discretion,” Jarvis said, placing a gentle hand on Peter’s back and nudging him towards the hall.  “Please tell your aunt that we will be down promptly at seven.”
Jarvis considered that.  “Yes,” he said at last. Steve looked at him, and Jarvis smiled.  “Was that rude of me?  My apologies, but yes, Officer Rogers.  This is the world we live in, and it is a world that is a great deal easier to navigate with money in your pocket.  Money is freedom.”
She looked at him, her eyes narrowed.  She looked at Steve.  “I don't want to know,” she said, grabbing a couple of boxes and heading for the door.  Resigned, Steve picked up a box of sketchbooks and followed her.
He stared up at the tree, and held up a hand, spreading his fingers wide.  “I miss you.  You and Dad, both.  But mostly you.  Or maybe, just the idea of you.”
Tony smiled.  “I'm fine.  Go distract Marcy before she convinces the board that we can walk on water.”  The knob of the door turned easily under his hand, and he ducked into the stairwell.
Sam nuzzled Abby's neck, and she made a sound that from anyone else, Tony would call a giggle.  From Chase, he was pretty sure it would be a growl.  Or something close.  But Sam pulled himself free.  “I've got this,” he said, smiling at Tony.  “Go.”
“Kid’s a pretty good workshop assistant,” Tony said, “but he’s probably not the source most people would choose for industrial espionage.”  He rubbed a hand over his face.  “I’ve got Pepper pulling together my liquid assets, which are…  Significantly less than what most people would assume.”
"Still rich and brilliant?" Tony offered, tucking his hands in his pockets.  "Possibly less married.  Or more married.  My stunning good looks have likely intimated most people, so-"
Two voices, identical and balanced and coming from opposite sides of the room.  DJ looked from one Stephen Strange to the other, both walking in from identical portals with identical strides.  They both froze, staring at the other, and then as one, they both turned to Agatha.  “Agatha, what-”
DJ looked up.  “Hi,” he said, as Phil set his briefcase down on the counter, finding a clear spot between the eggs and the flour.
“How are you like this?” Tony asked, his fingers steepled in front of his face.  “How are you-” He squinted at Bucky.  “You?”
He split the difference, setting his hand in Rogers'.  He had a moment to savor the expression of confusion and shock that slid over Rogers' face, and then he leaned in.  “Officer?” he said, his voice a silken, husky purr.  “When it's done right, your partner doesn't have the energy, the breath, or the spare brainpower to talk.”
In the center of the cracked, fractured floor, facing the phalanx of giant robots, was a child.
"Keep dreaming, Ellen!" he called after her.
“If you held it in, you'd die,” Sam told him.  Natasha poked him in the shoulder.  “What the hell was that for?”
"Sorry, bratbot," Tony said.  He pulled off his helmet and braced it against his hip.  "Everyone's fine.  Clint tripped and fell in a hole, and got like, a scraped elbow, but that's the worst of it."
“He’s a bit of a dumbass, Steve, you know he is,” Isaiah responded.  He rocked forward in his chair.  “The point being, I know you.  I know you damn well.  I invited you along to testify, and, whether you know it or not, I knew just what I was getting when I did that.”
Harrris looked down at his feet.  “I don’t have the legs to pull off a miniskirt,” he said.  “I could do a, you know, leggings?  But seriously, knobby knees.”
“TIME FOR SCIENCE!” the clock said, in a tone just under a shriek.  Bruce pressed it again.  “TIME FOR SCIENCE!”
“Why do you always have to be so difficult?” Tony asked. Pepper leaned against his side, her arms wrapped around his elbow.
“I'm taking the rest of them,” Tony said, and Steve laughed.
“Sorry,” Steve mumbled, frustrated with himself.  “Sorry, I-”
Peter's mouth opened.  Closed.  He looked down at DJ, who gave him a nod.  Peter looked back at Tony.  "Absolutely, Mr. Stark.  We stake our reputations on it."
For a long, painful moment, Ty just stared at him, his face twisted into something dark and ugly.  “You ruined it,” he said, and there was an icy edge to his voice now.  Something cold and calculating and unsettling.  “The way you ruin everything.”
He crumbled the pages into a ball and tossed it into the fireplace.  The stark white of the pages looked strangely obscene against the empty hearth.  “As I said.  A lot of nonsense.”  He glanced at Steve, his face unreadable.  “And yours?”
“Thanks for giving that all due consideration,” Steve said, pushing DJ’s hair away from his forehead with a gentle hand, the gesture familiar and easy.  DJ leaned into it, relief sweeping over him. “Will you eat some soup?  For me?”
Tony choked on a laugh.  “Lies,” he said, taking a sip of his drink.  “Embarrassing lies.  You’re a spring chicken, Jarvis.”  Jarvis laughed, and Tony opened one eye, peering at him.  “You should have grandchildren by now.  If you hadn’t wasted your life picking up after me, you’d-”  He stopped, shaking his head.  “You should have grandchildren.”
Tony leaned his hands on the workbench.  “Math is best when it’s chaos, Parker.”
Ellen's mouth opened. “Oh, fuck me,” she said, and it came out so fast that it was almost one word.
“And who's our other friend?” Fury asked.  “A new recruit?”
Steve felt his lips twitch.  "You don't sound convinced," he said.
He couldn't breathe.
Franklin gave her a look.  “That almost made sense,” he said, and she stuck her tongue out at him.
“Yep,” DJ agreed.  He leaned his head on Tony's shoulder.  “Help?” he asked again.
Steve caught himself smiling.  “What, no custom ringtone?”
“Well, there’s this,” Tony said, and before Steve could stop him, he slipped his hands under the hem of Steve’s t-shirt.  Laughing, Steve tried to catch his wrists, and Tony clambered onto the bed, straddling Steve’s legs.  Almost nose to nose, Tony grinned at him.  “This also works.”
On the stage, they'd finished up closing statements, or arguments, or whatever the fuck it is what they were doing, Tony hadn't really been paying attention, Tony didn't care, he was just watching Steve's mouth, his throat, his hands, his body, and slowly losing his mind.
"Only those who have a proper lunch are allowed shortcake, sir," Jarvis said.  He watched the ball bearings roll across the workbench.  "Do you like these?" he asked DJ with a slight smile.  DJ nodded, holding one out to Jarvis.  He took it.  "Thank you!"
“No, what I said was that you're not comfortable with dealing with things like this,” Sam pointed out.  “Hating it and being able to do it despite hating it are two different things.”
He could swear that he heard Jarvis sigh.  “Chance of precipitation in the next hour is 70%.  Might I suggest a jacket, sir?”
“You got something to say, Sam 'Made of Eggshells' Wilson?  Cause if I were you, I'd keep my mouth shut.”  With a wave, Luke ducked out of the room and was gone.
"Round white plates," Steve said, handing him the salad and a carafe of dressing.
Clint nicked another piece of Bobbi’s peel.  “Still not sure we made the right choice.”  His head rolled in Bruce’s direction.  “How about you?”
Steve’s eyes slid shut.  He took a deep breath.  “Clint.  Is.  Hawkeye.”
“Right.  Can we stop focusing on things we should have and could have done?” Pepper said, one hand propped on her hip.  Her gaze snapped from Tony to Rhodey and back. “And instead, start focusing on the things that we need to do?”
Tony froze, his fingers flexing on a piece until it bit into his skin.  He set it down, the base clicking softly against the tabletop.  “The week’s not over,” he said, just as quietly.
Nicholas’ lips flicked in something like a smile.  “I know.  And here you are, anyway.”
“Time to go home.”
“And Marish deals enough with the 'why do you have to be difficult, why can't you just be normal?' shit from the general public.  They shouldn't have to deal with it at home.  Home should be the one place where there is a full understanding, and a full respect, of a person's identity."  She stopped at the guard desk, her hand placed lightly on the polished surface.  "Strangers have the excuse of ignorance.  Family doesn't.  So in the end, it doesn't really matter why your family isn't giving you the support and love you need."
“And it's bigger than my entire apartment,” Rogers said.  He opened the closet door, stepping inside.  “Actually, this closet might be bigger than my entire apartment.”
“The history books will record this act of monumental cowardice,” Tony said, reaching for a pawn.    He moved it.  “Luckily for you, you have an able lieutenant, and I’m here to save this army from ruin.”
“I don’t believe it, I know it,” Tony said, his head cocking to the side.  “Everyone knows that, Steve.  You’re the only one who doesn’t.”
“Steve Rogers: He tries too hard?” May asked.
He turned towards the door, his shoulders tense, his back straight.  “Or at least, nothing of any use.”
“I’ll call for you,” Pepper said.  She reached out, her fingers just touching Bruce’s sleeve.  “Thank you.”
“Such an unpleasant word.  I resent it.” Stark leaned over, his fingers closing on the fabric of his robe, and Steve watched him, mesmerized by the play of muscle and bone beneath his golden skin.   Stark straightened up, tossing the robe over one shoulder.  “I'll dress and meet you in the usual spot.”
Tony paused, his smile fading, going thin for an instant.  But it was just for an instant, and then his smile was back, just as wide and not nearly as real.  “Everyone loves him,” he said.  “But yes.  For the record.  I love him.”
Steve nodded.  “I am,” he said.  Sam was just a few feet ahead of them, his horse darting quickly through the flow of traffic.  “You?”
“It might happen!  I might do it!” Tony turned the sink on with a sharp jerk of his hand.  “God help me, that might be my only chance of survival here, starting a moral crusade against Captain America's goddamn fucking indecent short shorts.”  He shoved his head back under the tap, letting the icy water sluice over his head and shoulders.  It didn't help.
For the first time all day, maybe for a lot longer than that, he didn't miss the armor at all.
“No,” Pepper said, her voice blunt.
Clea held her hand out to the side, and the scroll rolled itself up to float over her palm.  “Why in the name of the seven hosts would you bring someone else from our dimension here?”
There was a moment of silence.  “I'm morally conflicted,” Tony admitted.  But he took the coffee anyway.
“He finished, did he?”
“You should be,” Rhodey said.  “One sec, I’ve got-”  There was a muffled sound of footsteps and something rattling, and then he was back.  “Yeah, sorry about that, I was just getting out of the shower, don’t want to leave the towel in the middle of the floor.”  The coffee pot beeped in the background.  “What’s up, Steve?”
Franklin picked at the seam of his pant leg.  “I didn't know that was why,” he said.  His fingernail scraped against the thread, digging into the fabric.  He sat up and looked at his sister.  “How do you know that?”
"I don't-"  Steve had barely gotten the words out before Natasha was there, throwing an old, ragged quilt around Stark's shoulders like a cape.  And Bobbi was right behind her, slipping a crown of golden lilies and deep purple mums onto his head.  Lacy white Queen Anne's lace filled the gaps between the petals, bright as stars against his dark hair.
“Yes, but we were friends before you even met her, so-”
“Down in the laundry yard,” he said, his voice rising on the last word, making it sound like a question.  “Checking on the-” His eyes flicked towards Steve, and away again.  “Taking in the work,” he finished.  Steve kept his head down, knowing a lie when he heard one, and a bad liar was even easier to pick out.
He stopped in front of Steve, and held out a hand, palm up.  “I’d be happy to take a look at it for you, however.”
Clint muttered something that was still not French, but was definitely a swear.  Still, he turned back to the stove, reaching for a pot.  Natasha rolled her eyes.  Steve looked from her, to Clint, to Stark, who was still watching them, a puckish, warm smile on his face.  Steve looked down at DJ, who had snuck all of his bacon off of his plate and into a napkin.
“You won’t.  You need sleep,” she said, pressing the pastry into his hand.  He took it, because the alternate would be to let it fall to the floor.  “If the phone rings, we’ll get you.”
“Rhodey’s outside, securing the grounds.  Happy’s gone back to the theater,” Pepper said.
Steve set his cocoa aside and reached for the envelope DJ had given him.  “I like mine,” he said.  “No wrapping paper to clean up, and-”  He pulled the card out of the envelope, his eyes scanning over it, and he abruptly fell silent.
Clint had somehow known just where to find this costume shop, a dusty, extensive warehouse of a building packed from wall to wall and floor to ceiling with costumes in every shape and size.  Cheap kids’ Halloween costumes were piled up in boxes next to ornate, theatrical costumes.  Ball gowns tumbled over poorly organized racks next to bins of plastic swords and foam scythes for all your reaping needs.  There were glass cases of sparkling costume jewelry and stacks of cardboard crowns painted in flaking gold paint.  Thigh high platform boots of buttery soft leather sat heel to heel with cheap clown shoes and wooden sandals.
“I sent the press release,” she confirmed.
“It’s possible,” Steve agreed.  The grounds sped by, and he could see human forms there, creeping through the darkness.  “And the theater management knew who was coming, even if the low level staff didn’t know.  But the majority of the people who could place Tony Stark on that sidewalk tonight are his own people.”
“Do you think they missed something?” Stark asked, and it wasn't as sarcastic or cutting as Steve expected it to be.  Just mildly curious.
Steve looked up at him.  “Sir?”
Hammer blinked.  And then subsided back into his chair.  “Now,” he said, his mouth stretching into a broad, unsavory smile, “we understand each other.”
“Well, then, carry on,” Jan said, as she and Clint tangoed past.
Rhodey pushed the box across the workbench.  “I brought you a coconut one.”
Her lips twitched.  “I do not have children,” she said, and Tony let out a breath he hadn’t even been aware that he was holding.
He paused.  Took a breath.  “They’re wrong.  No one’s in your head.  No one knows what you have to, to handle.  To bear.  No one knows, just how strong you are.”  He crouched down, face to face with DJ, his arms braced on his knees.  “And you are.  You are strong.  How you handle things, how you deal with them, that’s-”
Pepper threw her hands in the air.  “He's a genius!”
“I think I've got it.  Watch out.  Flamethrower,” Tony said, as a man in heavy gear came charging at them.
There was a slight tap on the door, and then Mrs. Parker bustled in, a covered plate in one hand.  “I’m here,” she said. “DJ, go wash your face and put on your pajamas.  Peter can’t go to bed until you’re tucked in as well.  Mr. Stark, you can help him.”  She pushed Tony’s paperwork to the side and set the plate down. “Officer Rogers, sit and eat.”
Steven exhaled, his face clearing.  “You’re Harris.”
“You shouldn't pick on him,” Steve said, closing the service window and securing it.  A moment later, he opened the driver's side door and slipped into his seat.  “He's good at his job.”  He gave Tony a look.  “And it's a horrible job.  With a very demanding boss.”
“I think I’ll stick to the terms of our agreement,” Steve said.  He dipped his head in a slight nod. “Appreciate your time, ma’am.”
“I think we should keep him.”
“I'm very intimidated,” Steve told him.  “Lie down, please.”
Against his will, Tony's lips twitched.  "You think you're funny."
"Jones," Natasha said, and Jessica held up both her hands, giving a double 'v for victory' sign.  Carol threw the wad of paper at her.
"Aren't you concerned that you've made yourself a target tonight?"
When he looked up at Steve this time, his gaze was steady.  “That’s the last I saw of him.  Stane lost his mind, said he could identify us both, I told him, no one would listen to a kid, but he didn’t want to hear it.  Gave me a gun, and told me to handle it.  Once and for all.”
Tony braced his hands on the arm of the couch on either side of Clint’s head, leaning over him.   “State your terms, you second rate, knockoff Robin Hood.”
She nodded against his shoulder. “I know.” She looked up at him, her eyes wet, her nose red. “I know.” She leaned her forehead against his chest, against the arc reactor. “I'm sorry,” she said.
“If you bring up kale in my bed, we will be breaking up,” Tony told him, and Steve reached up, his fingers gentle, almost reverent, on Tony’s cheek.
The inside of the cottage was better than he’d been expecting.  Light filtered in from the open door, and a handful of windows that were dusty, but still intact.  The floor was stone, and needed a sweeping, as did the thick wooden beams at ceiling level.  But Steve could stand up straight inside, without bumping his head, and the hearth looked much better than the chimney did.  There were a handful of shelves along the walls, and a heavy wooden chair in front of the fireplace.   An empty bedframe was tipped up against the wall, gathering dust, and a table and another chair sat beneath the front window.  There was a wooden ladder against the wall, leading up into the dim space beneath the roof.  Dust motes swirled through the air, catching the light, and there was a faintly stale smell to the air.  Like old books or damp soil, the smell hung in the air, barely stirred by the open door.
He brought her hands up, pressing a light kiss to the back of her knuckles.  “The pleasure is, as always, all mine,” he said, and went back to sweeping.
“Right,” Bruce said, nodding once, and then again.  “Right.”  He looked at Bobbi.  “I don’t suppose you can add anything to that?  About what kind of trouble he, uh, he might be?”
“Blockbuster movies work too,” DJ offered.  “Steve brings up The Matrix when he wants to distract Dad.”
Steve bit his lip to keep from smiling. "That's... A fairly common opinion, actually," he said. Tony gave him a look, and he shrugged, unrepentant. "You get used to him."
“Why is everyone here ARMED?” Harris asked, because Darcy was there, her hands sliding over his face, pushing his hair back, her fingers cradling his head.  “Everyone has a GUN.”
“Usually, yes,” Obie said.  “Justin, my boy, don’t play with your food.”  Justin started in his seat, his eyes blinking owlishly behind the lenses of his spectacles.  Obie gave him a fond, if exasperated smile.  “Manners, son.”
“He started using 'husband' a lot sooner than I thought he would,” Rhodey said to Pepper.
“And the rest of us have zero problems with lying to him,” Clint said.
“The results weren't optimal, no,” Sam said, wandering over to take a seat on Steve's other side. His shoulder bumped Steve's, and Steve leaned into him.
“But he’s dead,” Tony said.  “And the list of things I’ve done that he wouldn’t have approved of starts about a mile and ten years back.  I’m not living for for what he wanted, Obie.  I can’t.”
“Thank you,” Tony said, because Peter needed that, too.  He gave Mrs. Parker a lopsided smile.  “And you’ll keep an eye on both of them?”
"Go set the table, Tony," Steve said, and Tony swayed on his feet, wondering how bad it would be if he just leaned forward and kissed him right now.
“I’ll give you fifty bucks if you keep her from lighting anything on fire,” Tony’s guard said.
“You should eat something,” Bruce said, gesturing at the bedside table.  “Jarvis brought up some pastries, if you-”
“Love you, botboy,” Steve said.  “Don’t be late.”
“Give him half?” Tony asked, his head tipping in Steve’s direction.
Tony looked down at the page, and everything went sideways.  “Pepper?”
Wang shot back out of the door, his feet skidding on the polished marble of the floor.  He slammed the door behind him, throwing his weight against it.  “Wrong fertilizer,” he said, and something hit the door behind him, making the wood shudder.
Clint paused.  “Challenge being reconsidered.”
Steve nodded, his face expressionless. “Of course.” The words were oddly flat. Lifeless. When he looked in Tony's direction, his eyes were dull. He smiled, anyway, and Tony hated it.
Obie smiled.  “Since when can you not hold your alcohol?” he asked.
Steve was starting to suspect Stark Manor had it's own hidden currents, just below the calm surface, and all of them were dangerous.
Ellen gritted her teeth, struggling against the need to say something that would probably get her fired.  On her computer screen, her boss chuckled into his coffee cup.  “Watching you try to be diplomatic is a hell of a thing,” he said, flipping through the stack of pages in front of him with an idle hand.  “You haven't had much practice, have you?”
Steve paused, his head swinging in her direction.  “He’s…  He’s been by, has he?” he asked, picking his words carefully.
“And I'll still love you.”  Steve hung up, grinning at Sam as he wobbled his way across the parking lot.  “Wow.  You're looking...”  He shook his head.  “Rough.”
The words sent a shiver of pleasure through him.  “Stay here,” he repeated, the words whispered against Tony’s jaw.
“Yeah, yeah, go eat your churro,” Clint said.  He took a deep breath, and swiped his thumb across the front.  “Hi, Phil.”
“In full view of the western end of the estate, and the wall that runs along the access road,” Natasha mused.
The dome of chocolate, its surface a galaxy like swirl, rested in a deep blue wave of puree, tiny pinpricks of sugar scattered across the plate, warm golden-white stars against the sky.  A few candied violets nestled along the rim, small and brilliant and imperfect against the chocolate.  Steve reached out, taking the fork that Tony offered, and breaking the shell, Inside, ganache cradled a barely liquid center of puree that ran out across the tines of the fork.
“And then you said, ‘but don’t worry, I’ve got one that’s just the right size for your dick,’ and you pulled a Hot Wheels car out of your pocket, like, just-” Peter spread his hands.  “You had a HOT WHEELS and you just pulled that out, and he got really red and really quiet, and you said, ‘beep beep’ in your most condescending voice and then dropped it into his beer.
Tony’s stomach rolled over. “Obie’s never home on Tuesday,” he said, ripping his shirt off and tossing it towards the bench.  A wave of ash and dust floated to the floor.  Without being asked, Pepper held out a clean shirt, and he stepped into it. “Pep.  He never-”
“In a manner of speaking, sir, though I’m not certain it contains any of what we would define as ‘sugar.’.  Of course, accidentally creating a potentially hazardous situation while attempting to make lunch is a situation that you are not unfamiliar with.”
“I don’t-”
“No.  She is not.”  Tony slipped his hands in his pockets.  “The point is, I’ve know her for a long time, and if something hadn’t gone wrong, she would’ve spent the first two thirds of the party waiting for something to go wrong, and the last third assuming something had gone wrong, and she’d missed it.  She’ll never admit it, but she’s got a tiny superstitious streak.
“Peter...” Steve said, glancing at him.
“Shame it's starting so soon,” Steve said. He made a show of glancing over his shoulder, as if looking to see if they were being observed. It was enough to make Hammer shuffle in a step, sensing a secret on the offering. Steve rubbed a hand over his mouth to hide his smile. “There's a bar, not far from here, where the chorus girls go, after the show.”
It took an embarrassingly long time for Steve to convince his arm to move, to reach out and select a piece.  It clicked against the board, and Steve slumped back in his chair, trying to ignore the feeling of arousal that now curled low in his belly.  “Your move.”
“And that means that ruining a couple of perfectly good pillows is probably pointless,” Darcy said.  She shifted on the bed next to him, and then the edge of the pillowcase was tugged up.  Harris glared at her, and she let out a noise that sounded suspiciously like a giggle.  “Okay, so there’s two of them, and I know that’s not something that you’re really….  Prepared for, but-”
Shuri waited, her face serene.  “Ready?” she asked, with a slight smile.
It wasn't a question, but he answered it anyway.  “Yes.  It is.”
“My mother would be amused to know who is cooking her food,” Hitomi said.  She stroked a hand over DJ’s head.  “Will you help me weed the garden now?”  DJ nodded with a grin, and she smiled down at him.  “Thank you.  You are my best helper.  Best boy.”  She leaned over and pressed a kiss to his forehead.  “Say good-bye to your father.  He will call tomorrow.”
Jan blinked at him.  “I did.”  She looked at Thor.  “I did!”
“I’m not sure what’s happening here,” Tony said, caught between amusement and insult.
Clea smiled.  “Now, that, I believe.”  She stood, and her skirts fell around her legs in a cascade that was both mesmerizing and seemingly unending.  He watched the hem swirl around her ankles, caught against her skin like whisps of mist.  “I do not have children, Tony.  I am, however, a child who knows, without question, that there is no way back.  Even if I were to find a way to retrace my steps,to return to my family, for the lack of a better word, there is no welcome for me.  There is nothing.”
“I helped fund their second game, too.  That one sold better, I think, I-” DJ’s feet flexed.  “I think.  They’re-”  He focused on the cat, arching into Harris’ palm, its eyes closed, its ears flicking.  “Got an email last week.  About the third one.”
DJ considered that.  “Both,” he said, very firmly, and Steve choked on a laugh.
She nodded.  “I can do that,” she agreed. There was a slight pause, then she added, “It was not my intent to make you uncomfortable.”
Steve smiled down at her.  “No,” he said, and leaned forward to press a kiss on her forehead.  “Stay out of my closet, Jan.”
“There,” he said, taking a step back. His eyebrows arched. “How's that?”
“He didn’t take a car,” Pepper said.  “Happy didn’t even know he was gone until I told him.”  Her lips were set in a tight line.  “He just walked out the front gate, and-”  She shook her head.
“I got him soup,” Steve said, his voice amused.  He arched his eyebrows and took a sip of his coffee.  “Not that he’s eating it.”
“Why?” Tony echoed.  He reached for the wine bottle, filling first his glass, and then the other one.  “So many reasons.  But mostly…”  He set the bottle back down.  “Do you think the war’s over?”
“She came to tell you that neither of them was dead, and I don’t know about you, but I needed to hear that,” Natasha said.  “This isn’t just about you.”  She crossed her arms over her chest.  “Do you know why you don’t drink when you’re around Steve and DJ?”
“Axes,” Jarvis said.
Thor glanced at Steve, who was rubbing his eyes with the heel of one hand.  “I do not know if I’m prepared for this gift,” he said to DJ.  But he opened his box anyway, pulling out a braided loop of wire.  He grinned.  “I recognize your skills in this.”
“No,” Tony said, but she was already digging through his pockets.  Tony tried to fend her off. “Woman-” She pulled his phone out with a triumphant sound, and grabbed his hand.  “Why would I let you do this?” Tony asked as she tried to force his finger onto the unlock sensor. He shook her off and held his hand over his head.  “This is undignified.”
“And I don't even invite most of them,” Tony said, as Jarvis and Natasha appeared, plates held on  serving trays.  He gave them a smile.  “But I do have a very efficient staff.”
“I don’t think it’s your fault, DJ, but even if it was, even if you deliberately and rationally made the choice to come here?  I’m glad you did.”
“Yes, chef,” Peter said. He blinked at Tony.  “So.  Where are we going?”
“I’ll use the small child to wheedle additional pieces,” Tony said, holding his hands out to DJ, who took them and swung down to the ground, his feet kicking for an instant.  It was enough to make Tony ignore the spike of pain from his side.  “Right?”
"Have you talked to them?" Jan shot back, her lips pursed.  "'Smart' and 'hot' are not mutually exclusive.”  She looked at Steve.  “Sure, some models are about as deep as a puddle in the middle of a heatwave.  But not all of them.  Not even most of them.”  She crossed her arms over her chest.  “Stop judging people based on how they make their living, Steve.”
Steve let his eyes shut.  Took a deep breath, and then another.  “I’m going to ask Tony out,” he said, and that was the first time he had acknowledged that plan out loud.  He waited, his chest tight, for a sense of doom, for world to punish him for that.  For wanting something he couldn’t have.
“Said hard,” DJ pointed out, his voice smug.
“I’m starting to feel like I should be asking for a raise, honestly,” Rhodey said.
“Your website said you did-”  He paused, his eyes squeezing shut for a second.  Trip waited, amused, as he took a deep breath and forced a smile onto his face. “‘Friendship weddings?’”
Light pulsed outwards from DJ’s palms, washing over everything, knocking Harris back a step, and leaving a hint of sulfur and the lingering echo of thunder in its wake.  It was like a firework had gone off in the middle of the convention, sharp and brilliant and gone as quickly as it had come.
“I-” Steve’s thumb swept over the back of Tony’s hand, unable to resist one more small, intimate touch.  “I should get back to my room.  Before morning.”
“And it changes nothing,” Tony said.
“That,” he whispered against Tony’s mouth.  “And this.”  The second kiss was just as soft, just as chaste, but he allowed himself to linger this time, his breath mingling with Tony’s as he coaxed a response from Tony’s lips.
“Oh, yeah, I’m confident,” Clint said, slumped in his chair.
“No, you wouldn't,” Tony agreed.
“I don’t want to talk about the piano,” Harris said.
“She’s never bothered with the lobby before, so it’s hard to say if she’s developed a fondness for it,” Tony said.  Across the workbench, Bruce was subtly trying to gather up his things.  Tony pointed a finger at him, and Bruce froze.  It didn’t last long.  Tony frowned at him.  “No.”
“You going in?”  Sam asked.
“Fine, no tongue,” Jess said.
The sound of pounding feet coming up the hallway was the only warning he had before the library door exploded open.  “Sir!” Jarvis skidded to a stop, his hand locked on the doorknob.  Rhodey was right behind him, a pistol in one hand and Bruce's satchel in the other.
That wasn't going to happen, but he felt better for having tried. Tossing his shorts, he stabbed at the surface of his phone, disconnecting the call before he headed into the shower.
He raised his hand.  Darcy raised her hand.  DJ raised his hand.  Clint just smirked.
“Tempting, but I've got to, uh, I've got to get these into the kitchen,” Bruce said.  He took off his hat, depositing it gently on DJ's head.  He collected his baskets, shifting their weight with a roll of his shoulder.  “Clint'll want to know what he's got to work with.”
"Sir, if you have nothing useful to add to this educational process, perhaps it would be best if you focused on your own situation rather than ours," Jarvis said, his voice calm.
He looked up at the soaring ceiling, at the gleaming arches that surrounded the stage.  Down below them, the crowds were moving, people flowing from their seats and into the aisles.  Everyone moved slowly, clinging to the last moments of magic.  Tony supposed he could understand that.
Tony’s eyebrows arched.  “You’re going to walk the rest of the way?”
Clint threw his arms up.  Or maybe down.  Steve wasn't sure.  “I'm working on it!” he said.
“I'm not saying that they traveled halfway around the world to get married at a Pride celebration,” Ellen said, doggedly determined.  “I'm saying that once they WERE halfway around the world, they DID get married at a Pride Celebration.”
“He’ll be here soon enough,” Jarvis said, busy slicing bread at the sideboard.  He glanced up, bread knife held easily in one hand.  “And to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit, sir?”
“Cookin’, mostly,” Happy said.  “The boss wanted a French chef, and he got one.”
“He tried to kill you.  Until we find DJ, we keep him alive.  Then?  I don’t give a damn,” Steve said.  “What does this shadow agency want from you?”
Tony tried to ignore the warmth that swept over him.  “I think you're projecting, Jay,” he said.  He pointed up towards the ceiling.  “You're the only one fussing around here.”
Tony smiled back, but it didn't reach his eyes.  "Wasn't sure, you look kind of-"  His head tipped to the side.  "Stunned."
DJ’s eyes darted towards the Trix box. “Ate all of it.”
Jarvis arched an eyebrow.  “And are we discussing things that we were absolutely instructed not to discuss?” he asked, his voice brisk.
“And I say, ‘I’m not,’ and she goes, ‘Not what?’ and I said, ‘I’m not straight.  I’m bi.’”  She paused.  Carol had her face buried in her folded arms.  Jess reached over and patted her on the head. “And she said ‘Good for you,’ and then she left.”
“Especially Fury,” Rhodey said.  “I…  I remember that.”
It felt like a lie in his mouth, it felt heavy and wrong on his tongue, it tasted of metal and blood, but Peter nodded.  Because Peter still trusted him.
“Don't even start with me, Stark.”  Steve's arms wrapped around Tony's waist, his fingers tangling in the fabric.  “I spent six months hovering in the background of every party and gathering that happened on that damn street, nursing a drink and watching half the people there try to get your attention.”
“I tested it personally,” Jarvis said.  “No matter what I did, I could not manage to get it open.”  He picked up Tony’s cup of water and set it, with deliberate movements, closer to him on the edge of the table.  “I cannot imagine what the problem might be.”
“Tony.” Obie scraped a hand over his face.  “He can barely string two words together, and you’re seriously considering, what, having him brought up as a pet project?”
“Right,” Steve said, but he was smiling.  “Think you've still got a fever.”
“No matter how fast I go, can’t seem to get away, or catch up,” Steve said.  He glanced at Sam.  “Stuck.  Somewhere in the middle, I guess.”
“Yeah, on your viral video.  Not his viral video.” She wiggled her phone in his direction.  “Statement?”
DJ’s hands were locked on the straps of his backpack, his knuckles white with the force of his grip.  “I can…  I can just come back tomorrow,” he managed.
“Yeah,” Steve said, a little breathless. “I like your blanket, too.” He shifted Tony to the side, grabbing a random piece of dark cloth. “Give me a second, and I'm going to take it back off of you.”
"I hate the fucking couch," Tony said, with such bile that Steve couldn't quite hold back a laugh.
“Of course he did!” Ty wrenched the sheets out of his hand, balled them up, and threw them back at him.  Tony let it bounce harmlessly off of his head.  “And then he said I failed.”
Someone was talking, voices low, and strangely, they seemed like they were a very long way away.  Tony squinted in that direction, trying to get his eyes to focus.  There was a low railing just to his right, and he realized that the apartment had been broken into two levels, the bedroom on a platform somewhere above the main floor of the apartment.  It took him a painfully long time, but he managed to push himself to the edge of the bed, far enough that he could get a better look.
It was a smaller bedroom, but more then the physical size, it was less imposing.  It was tucked in a corner of the floor, with large windows on two walls flooding the space with light.  Someone, Jarvis probably, had opened them, and now the breeze stirred the lacy, cream colored curtains.  Instead of the heavy, dark wallpaper he'd seen elsewhere, the walls here were painted a pale green, with delicate, twining vines running around the top near the ceiling.
“I was summoned,” Steve said.  “I wasn’t aware I had a choice.”
Isaiah’s teeth flashed in a sharp grin. “Burn it down and salt the earth, Rogers.”
“Ohayōgozaimasu,” DJ said with a grin.
“Are you?” DJ asked her.
“I could eat,” Tony said.  He flopped back into his chair, his legs thrown out in front of him, his head falling back.  He frowned up at the ceiling. “I probably should eat.”
And if Parker was still here, he deserved whatever he got.
He crossed to the door and opened it.  “So anyone who's not comfortable with asking the injured man to loan you five bucks?  Out.”
“Well.  You weren’t the only one who didn’t measure up,” Obie said with a wry smile. “I heard a version of it myself.”
She gave him a look.  “It’s TRADITION.”
“Right, and I’ll be buying a costume company and, I don’t know, lighting its inventory on fire,” Tony said.  He scowled at the costume.  It was a horrible shade of orange-red, with metallic gold ink stamped on in places.  Neither the ink nor the seams seemed straight, and Tony had a sneaking suspicion that if the bag was opened, it would stink of plastic and chemical residue.  “Why would you-”
Tony paused, his coffee halfway to his mouth.  He frowned.  That couldn’t be right.  “It has been far longer than-”
Peter grinned down at DJ.  "What, were you going to take 'em out yourself?"
“Question,” Jess said, wiggling her straw in midair.
Steve went still.  “Ma’am?” His eyes darted towards Tony, but he’d already wandered away, pushing a wooden box up against the stone wall of the building across the way.  Steve looked back at the old lady.  “What are you-”
"Where were the two of you when we were getting married?" Tony asked, reaching for his jacket.  "Day late and a dollar short, both of you."  He shrugged into it, his shoulders rolling with the movement.  It settled around him, perfectly tailored to every line of his body, and Steve wanted to take it right back off of him.  He tucked his hands in his pockets, mostly to keep himself out of trouble.
Tony studied him, using his coffee cup as a stalling tactic this time.  “No,” he said, and Bruce sighed.  Tony took another sip of coffee.  “You can stay.  But I’ll be checking your equations.”
'Pretty good' was high praise from Jesse.  Ellen clicked on the graphics icon again, and this time, she was rewarded with a half dozen error messages about how there was another version of the program already running, and a single picture.
“She’s left it to you to actually press the button,” Tony said, grinning back at him.  His head tipped towards the door, and he rolled to his feet, leaving the chair bounce in his wake.  “For Jan?  That shows a remarkable amount of trust.”
Jan was dancing along, but most of her attention seemed to be on the sketchpad she'd balanced against her left arm, her pencil sweeping over the page with reckless abandon.  There was a length of very expensive fabric tied around her neck, like a child playing super hero with a bath towel cape.  All around her, an array of people were doing their own thing, more or less following along with the music.
“What about mom?” Tony demanded.  “Did mom-”
Wanda Maximoff nodded, even as she pulled the spoon away from the woman’s hand.  The woman let it go without a fight, reaching for her cup instead.  “It’s not her,” Wanda repeated, leaning over to set the spoon on the table between them.  Her dark hair slid over her shoulder, soft curls bouncing against her cheek.  She looked up, giving DJ a faint smile.  “Agatha.  Look at him.”
“But you wanted-”
“And you invited me,” Steve said.
“Please pick a font,” Natasha said, spearing a piece of cantaloupe.
“Ah,” she said, and the sound whispered past her lip, soft and almost sad.  She raised her hand, her fingers tracing a strange, twisted pattern through the air.  “Thank you, Patrick, but I don’t think that will be necessary.”
Jesse yawned again.  “No, I called and asked them if they had a honeymoon suite, and if they said no, I asked if they had a high end suite.  If I got a yes to either of them, I told 'em I'd just gotten married and my baby deserved the best so money was no object, but we wanted to check in immediately.” She paused.  “I implied I was super horny.”
“We’re fine with one, thank you,” Stark said.
"Yes.  I do not think it was a deliberate choice on his part.  He seems most agitated about the situation.”
Tony tucked his hands in his pockets, because that was easier than holding them still.  “Most of what we do is pretending,” he said.  The Not-Steve thing shifted, and Tony rocked back, his shoulders hitting the display of a nearby booth.  Framed photos rattled against the wire racks they’d been mounted to, a strange, discordant sound that brought them all up short.  Despite that, no one even looked in their direction.  People passed by, as if they weren’t there, and Tony gripped the edge of the display.
Bucky fell in next to Okoye, and she didn’t even look in his direction.  “Go,” she said.  “I’ll keep watch.”  Bucky didn’t reply, and her head tipped in his direction.  “He needs you.”
“I know where you keep stuff, and the drunks'll wait for you,” Peter said.  He braced his arms on the counter.  “I'm really good at distracting drunks.”
Darcy paused, a shrimp halfway to her mouth.  “Old books?”
"Is a full array of half-naked men, flexing," Tony said.  “And comparing their muscles.”
“Grab a couple of Cokes from the vending machine by the door, and I'll pay you back,” Tony told him.
She blinked at him, her big brown eyes framed by truly impressive fake lashes.  “What...  Are potato nachos?” she asked, the fur stole around her shoulders slipping down her arms.
"Promise they won't measure me!" His voice echoed down.
She nodded. Her eyes flicked towards Steve again, her lips going tight. But she gathered her things and headed for the door, pulling it shut behind her. It clicked shut, the sound loud in the stillness of the room.
“Rude,” Tony said, eating Goldfish straight from the bag.
“Dunno.”  He bent over the paper, squinting to see, and wishing the light was a bit better.  He shifted to the side, folding one leg under him, trying to get a better angle.
“Listen-”
“No,” Tony said to Darcy, who gave him a wide eyed look over the top of the box.  He struggled against a smile.  “No.”
Obie nodded.  “Yes, of course.”  He smiled.  “DJ.  What happens if he thinks that he’ll be in the line of inheritance?  Or, worse, what if his real parents show up?”
“No one would blame you.  Except maybe the cat…”
A tall man in a ragged coat stepped out of the alley across the street, moving forward slowly, but with deliberate purpose.  Even as Rhodey wrestled Tony into the car, he was moving in their direction, his hand tucked into the front of his coat.
“That’s…  That’s not going to work,” Steve told her.
Steve looked down at DJ.  “Want to try?”  He nodded, and Steve smiled, a strange sense of peace sweeping over him.  He held out a hand for DJ to take.  “Okay.  Let's go.”
“We all want that,” Steve said, grinning at her.  He handed her a stack of napkins.  “Tell him I sent you and he'll give you some extra guac.”
He knew what was happening.  He just didn't know what he felt about it.  And that seemed more important.
Tony didn't even slow down.  Even if he'd wanted to, trying to stop Pepper mid-way through a song was dangerous, if not impossible.  "Good afternoon, officer!" he said, his voice pitched to be heard above the rollicking beat of the music.  "Are you done with your investigation?”
Steve wondered if he did want to hear the story, or if he just hated to be left out.
“I’ll be getting married in those,” Tony said. “I need them.  To maintain my cool facade.”
“Worth a try, I suppose,” Tony said with a wry smile.  “Fine.  I’ll have Jarvis bring me a sandwich up to my office later.”
“Yes,” Tony said.
“Number of fucks does seem to be very, very low,” Jesse agreed.
“The worst years of his life,” Tony said, as Steve’s fingers stroked up his wrist, tickling the sensitive skin of his inner arm.  “Excuse me, I’m trying to cook here.”
Peter's mouth dropped open.  “Hey!”
Jan ghosted a kiss against Jarvis' cheek.  “For you, Mr. Jarvis?  Anything.”
Steve leaned over, cutting off the flow of words with a kiss.  “Thought you could skate,” he whispered.
Strange plowed through the wall, leaving a trail of glittering sparks in his wake.  The wall closed up behind him, shuddering back into place as soon as his cape was clear.  “We’re having-” Strange ducked as the massive staircase shifted a foot to one side, the carpet hopping free of the wood for an instant.  Strange gave it a stern look.  “Stop that.”  He flicked his fingers in that direction, and the staircase rattled back into place, the stairs rising and falling like piano keys.  “You are an embarrassment.”
Steve just stared across the lawn, his eyes trying to focus on the walls, all the way at the far edges of the property.  Whatever he wanted to say stuck in his throat, a hard, sharp pressure that he couldn’t quite swallow, and couldn’t quite verbalize.
"Hallelujah, skin," Tony said, as deadpan as he could manage, and Steve started to laugh.  While he was distracted, Tony caught his wrist, steadying it as he slipped the ring onto Steve's finger.  It settled into place as if it had been crafted to fit there, pale and warm against his skin.
Tony choked on a laugh and straightened up. “Damn right you will.  Don’t eat my burgers”
“Library,” she agreed.  “Off with you.”  She yanked a page free, holding it up between her index finger and thumb.  It twisted back and forth, rattling against itself.  She released it, and it burst into flame.
"Well, I think we made real progress today."
Ellen squinted down at the picture.  The man on the right, the dark haired one with the facial hair, had been caught in profile, his head tipped up to give a perfect view of his jawline.  Her eyes narrowed, a vague sense of familiarity hovering in the back of her mind.  "It's...  A goatee," she said, but she didn't sound certain, even to her own ears.
Shuri dipped a languid curtsy.  “Your Majesty,” she said with a smile.
“Of course you won't, sir, but for as long as you are here, we need to keep up appearances, and this needs laundering,” Jarvis said, his voice arch.  He looked back.  “A proper dinner jacket is less a sacrifice and more a statement.”
“I’m working here,” Tony said, not looking up from his tablet.
Bruce nodded.  "Won't be the first time it's been out back all night, won't be the last."  His eyes cut up, meeting Steve's for a moment.  "You okay with him?"
“You’re incorrigible,” Obie said, with a fond smile.  He buttoned up his coat and stabbed a finger in Tony’s direction.  “I’m responsible for you, you know that. I promised your father-”
Steve waited, but Tony's breath went slow and even again.  He huffed out a breath.  “Right.  Guess we're doing this the hard way.”  Before he could think better of this, before he could consider just how stupid this was, Steve leaned over, scooping Tony out of his seat in one smooth motion.
Rhodey picked up a few of the records from the rack next to the table.  “They’re Tony’s, so I think it’s safe to say we have nothing but.”
Tony struggled not to burst into laughter.  “You fear neither god nor man, do you?”
“I am refusing to look directly at you,” Pepper called, still swimming in slow, graceful strokes.  “For fear that I'll swoon and drown.”
“Just stating a fact.” Steve looked at DJ.  “We both love you.  A lot.”
“I mean, unless there was something quite illegal about your employment contract with my father, then, yes, you absolutely could’ve quit.” Tony pushed himself upright.  “So-”
“Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie,” Jan said, and Carol just blew her a kiss.  Jan tossed her head, her hair swinging in a perfect arc around her cheeks.  “Now.  Steve.”
“Yes,” she said.
Tony considered that.  “He’s afraid he’s in trouble.”
“No,” everyone said at the same time, and Carol flipped them off with both hands without even putting down her fork.
“Because Peter refused to sit on anyone’s lap and we were out of seats,” Carol said.
He could hear something, just out of range of the phone’s microphone, and then Charlie said, “She says her name is Clea, sir, and she would like to be announced.”
Steve's head moved, just a little, just enough so that he could peer up at Tony with one red-rimmed eye.  “You'd resent me after a week,” he said.
“That she is.” The young man tucked the bill into his pocket.  “Is there anything else we can do for you, Mr. Stark?”
“Probably not,” Tony said, and Pepper elbowed him in the side.  He flinched away from her.  “What?”
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony's waist, tugging him in close.  “It's not a secret,” he said, and when he said it, Tony was pretty sure he believed it.  “It's just-” His eyes met Tony's.  “Private.”
“Yeah,” Steve said, and he could almost swear he meant it.
It was nice not to eat alone, for once.
Tony picked up a spindle that had been set to the side, turning it over in his hand.  It wasn't until he rolled the slim metal rod between his fingertips that he felt the flaw, the almost imperceptible bend halfway down the length.  He set it back down, a little too close to the good parts, and DJ immediately collected it, putting it back with the rejects.
“Who’s going with you?” Pepper asked.
“Thought I’d give you a chance to make your report, that’s all,” Steve said.
“But it won’t” Tony sing-songed at her, bracing his free hand on his hip.  She skipped to the side, trying without success to find the right stone to step on.  Tony grinned.  “Jan.  It only works for me.”
“Right, I can-” Steve said, and she pointed at the desk.  “I can sit.”
He shook his head.  “I’m sorry.  I have nothing for you.”
He stopped, and Rogers exhaled, a sound almost like a laugh.  “Just one?”
"There are four shelters in the city who will take in LGBTQ kids, and two that focus their efforts on those kids."  The lobby was quiet, and her voice was hushed, almost lost beneath the sound of their footsteps.  "All of them draw a majority of their funding from the Maria Stark Foundation.  They're always full.  But there's an agreement."  She shook her head.  "If the kid comes with a card, they won't be turned away for lack of space.  He made sure of it."
Obie’s booming voice made DJ flinch, and brought Tony’s head around.  Obie ducked around the corner of the staircase, squinting at them. “I’d forgotten that this little nook existed,” he said, with a broad grin.  “Could not figure out where your voice was coming from.”
“While I appreciate your dedication to your duty,” Tony said from between clenched teeth, “I do believe that I can manage.”  He arched his eyebrows. “Thank you.”
“Physically, no.”  Pepper leaned around Steve, one hand resting on his arm, a puckish smile on her face.  “But if you’d prefer to help Happy with his steps?”  Her voice ticked up at the end, a half question.
“I expected him to smash it.”  Tony picked up a thin wafer of pickle from the plate, popping it into his mouth.  “I handed him an expensive piece of trash and a hammer and told him to have fun.”  He paused.  “I would’ve smashed it.”
Bucky, pacing around the room, grabbed the ladder and gave it a brisk shake.  It clattered against the stone, throwing off cobwebs, but it held despite the abuse.  Danvers fell silent as Bucky clambered up the ladder into the loft.  There was a moment of silence.  “I’ll sleep up here,” Bucky declared.
Steve gave him a look that Tony couldn't read.  “I'm working on it.”  He turned back to the stove.  “I'll trust you to pick out a wine.  Just...  Don't tell me how much you paid for it.”
Steve swung his shield up onto his shoulder, letting its slight weight settle against his back.  He exhaled, and felt it shift, and everything was better because it was there.  “I’m not going to jump the wall.”  Bobbi gave him a  look, her eyebrows arching, and he felt his lips twitch.  “Again, I mean.”
Tony didn’t realize he’d stopped walking until Jarvis pulled away from him.  Jarvis, noticing as well, pulled up short, turning to look back at him.  “Sir?”
“Why is that even an option?” Tony asked, and Iron Man’s head rolled in his direction.  For a moment he was stunned by the reflection of his own face in the faceplate of the helmet.  Shaking off the disconcerting feeing of deja vu, he forced his words out through gritted teeth.  “Why would you even give him the option to DROP the ARMOR in midflight?”
A moment later, he strode into the lobby, looking neither left nor right, heading straight for the concierge station.  The woman stationed there looked up, a polite smile on her face until she realized just who was heading in her direction.  In an instant, her posture changed, her chin coming up, her shoulders going back.  “Good evening, Mr. Stark,” she said, her voice polished.  She slid an expensive looking cream colored envelope across the counter to him.  “Your suite is prepared.  Your-” Her forehead wrinkled for just a moment.  “Assistant indicated you would not be requiring the butler or in room serving staff.  If we’d had a bit more warning, we would’ve assigned someone to-”
“Is it?” he asked, flipping through the manga.  He got the distinct impression that Steve was not the target market for this.'
“There is nothing wrong with sexual attraction,” Sam said.  He looked over at Steve.  “We’re on the same page there, right?”
Tony peered down at the dish, his mouth watering.  “What’s the dust on top?”
She flipped through the pages in the folder.  “A thwarted attempt to steal the payroll of a factory down in the slums.  An armed gang war stopped before it had a chance to start.  A corrupt ward boss who’d been setting up ‘soup kitchens’ that never actually served a single bowl to the starving people he claimed to serve had a change of heart and fled the city with a suitcase and his tail between his legs.  Men trying to rob cargo from the docks found someone waiting for them.  They were forced to jump into the river to escape.”
“Preferably in that order,” Tony agreed.  “Fine.  Let’s go.”
“No,” everyone in the room chorused, as DJ muffled his giggles behind his hands.
“Yes, I do,” Steve called over his shoulder.  “Just because you like a crust that you could kill a man with-”
Harris nodded.  “You’re an ass.”
“And any parent who seeks to protect both their fortune and their family will make it clear to their child that such people exist.  That the child must be careful, because everyone wants what they have, and everyone will seek to take things from them that may not be theirs to give.”  Jarvis’ mouth went into a flat line.  “To put it in the simplest way, the child grows up with the knowledge that they are seen as a potential mark by a wide variety of conmen and thieves.
Steve settled down next to him, balancing the bowl on his knee.  “Thanks.”
“Right, but that's-”
It didn’t take long.  By the time they were out of the city proper, Tony had given him the basics, with Happy anything Tony might’ve missed from the front seat.  When they finally fell silent, Steve took a deep breath.  “We’re assuming ransom, then.”
“I walked from the car to the front door,” Tony pointed out, amused.
"It does, sir, but it makes no sense that this man-" Steve stabbed the file folder with enough force to make his finger hurt.  "Is a convert to any cause that doesn't put a dollar in his pocket.  He'd sell his own grandmother for enough of a payout, I'd sooner believe Stark of being a communist before him.”
“And then, because we are a people of limitless imagination and almost limitless resources, everyone and their god-forsaken brother started trying to figure out how to get you OUT of it.”  She paused.  “Not me, though.  I want that noted.”  She tapped a finger on the table.  “I was not interested in the prize in the middle of a magical block of ice, in that it was a dead body.”
Sue stared at him, her eyes suddenly bright.  “I'm going to hug you now,” she said, and Steve laughed.
“Don’t be a dick,” Steve said.  “Also, even if we could get married, none of our family or friends are here.”
“It’s quite good.  Don’t you like tea?”
"If I had to guess, I'd say he's downstairs.  Handling dinner preparations for eight," Stark said, his voice sardonic.
His voice trailed away, and Bobbi picked up the thread.  “Answers,” she said.  Her smile was slow and sharp and very, very dangerous.  “I think it’s about time we gave him some, don’t you?”
He stopped again, and Rhodey said there, waiting patiently.  “It’s his body,” Steve said at last.  “And I don’t want to pressure him.  Either way.”
Shuri looked at Steve.  “Did he just try to avoid a bad word?” she asked, her eyes dancing.
Rhodey shrugged, his mouth curled up in a faint smile.  “What?  I'm just here to bribe the kid with donuts.”  He folded his arms on the edge of the workbench, leaning into them.  “Pepper offered me a ride.”
“Clint is good at many things,” Bobbi said, one elbow braced on the door.  “Subtlety isn’t high on the list.”
“Watch your mouth,” Isaiah said, pointing a spatula at Eli, who just grinned.  Isaiah shook his head.  “Food truck business isn't what it used to be.”  He handed the platter to Steve, and wandered into the living room.  “Used to be for the poor folk, you know.  The ones who couldn't afford to eat at a proper restaurant, or couldn't leave the job site long enough to have sit down meal.”  He leaned on his cane.  “Trucks like mine, we went to the blue collar workers, driving down to the docks or setting up in the alleys down by the factories.  Served simple fare for a fair price, hot and fast.
“Is that my sketchbook?” he asked, pushing himself up on one elbow.
“Everything,” she repeated.
“I can make him soup,” Steve said.  “And my soup's better than yours.”
Agatha held up a hand.  “How many women in your life have asked you, quite politely, to please stop talking?” she asked, her lips twitching.
Peter sat there, holding the fifty bucks.  “Was…  Was it not my problem before?”
"This is not my fault."
Once he was back on the main floor, Steve settled down into one of the more stable kitchen chairs, ignoring the way it creaked under his weight.  "I've never seen your dad when he's sick before.  I made him some tea and toast."  DJ nodded, and Steve smiled at him.  ""What do you think?   Tea and toast?  Is that what you have when you're sick?"
Steve blinked.  “What?”
"You purchased it several years ago," Jarvis said.
She straightened up.  “We have reached an understanding.  Good.”  She looked at Tony.  “You.  You bring a minor into our place again, I will personally have your spine.  I will use it as a cane, when I am old and feeble, to beat men like you half to death, well, well into my declining years.”
orphanage.”
“There are indeed,” Jarvis said, removing one of Tony’s shoes and setting it aside.
He nodded, his pale hair flopping over his forehead.  "Everyone down these parts knows Officer Rogers," he said.  He leaned up against Hammer's battered desk, rocking his weight back on his heels, clearly happy to stay and gossip.  "He's a good one.  Most of the police round here, they'd as soon give you a sound thrashing as talk to you, but Rogers is a decent one.  He knows everyone, by name even, an' he's fair.”
“And you still lose out to canned dough, chopped into chunks, and thrown into the oven covered in cinnamon sugar,” Clint said.  He patted Tony on the shoulder as he walked behind the couch.  “How much did you spend, again?”
There was a pause.  “Sir appears to be having a slight crisis,” Jarvis said at last.  “I suspect intervention may be necessary.”
“Yes, because he’s going to be eating his weight in candy at the theater,” Tony mumbled under his breath.  May gave him a look, and Tony tucked his hands in his pockets, rocking forward and backward on his heels.  “Am I wrong?”
It barely counted as a kiss.  If there was contact, it was fleeting, delicate, the brush of lips against lips for a bare second.  But when it was done, the bravest, stupidest thing he’d ever done, he lingered, Tony’s breath warm on his mouth.  When Tony sucked in a long, uneven breath, Steve felt it, felt it against every inch of his skin.
“Shouldn’t hate things,” DJ said, around a mouthful of potatoes.
Tony’s knuckles dug into Steve’s chest.  “I’ll call the mayor’s office,” he said, his voice raw.  “And have you fired.  Then.  Then, will you leave?”
“So my brother finally says, ‘I will go,’ and that is a second uproar, everyone-” She drew the word out to about twice as many syllables as it should’ve had.  “Everyone had an opinion, and most of them were loud, but I think he was curious by then.”
Tony nudged at his shoulders.  “Lie back and-”
Tony leaned against the wall.  “A letter,” he said, and she nodded.  “Implying that you took it to make a betrothal gift for his son.”  She nodded again.  “And phrasing it in such a way that he’ll be inclined to be benevolent towards his soon to be daughter-in-law.”
DJ nodded.  “Bye, Steve!”
“You just want my shirts for yourself, I know the truth here,” Clint said.  He grabbed a pair of scissors from the knife block and cut the powdered sugar open.  “Fine.  Take them both, if it’ll make him happy.”  He pointed the scissors in DJ’s direction.  “I know what you’re up to, though.”
“Right,” Tony said.  “Is Steve outside?”
Steve's teeth flashed in a very dangerous, very hot grin, and Tony's breath caught in his throat.  "Actually, I think I would," he said, and he was moving forward now, towards Tony, each step deliberate.  His bare foot came down in a puddle with a splash, and Tony shivered.  Steve's head dipped forward.  "Don't you want to come out?"
Steve woke slowly, blinking against the early morning light.  The warm, solid body curled against his was a surprise, and achingly familiar, all at the same time.  He slid a hand up Tony’s chest, trying to memorize the feel of his skin, the sound of his breathing as he slowly started to wake.
DJ straightened up.  “Agatha says.  Time to go home.”
“Is that what all this secrecy is about?” Steve asked, a little deflated by the idea.  “You’re telling me that Stark doesn’t bother locking his workshop, he’s got piles of plans and diagrams and blueprints piled up in the library, but this?” He glared at the still.  “This, you keep under lock and key?”
Tony rubbed a hand over his face.  “So…  You took his blood and then sent him up onto the roof.  Because that’s safe.”
“Rhodey’ll be around with the car, so-”
He reached up, catching the rim of his shield in his hand.  “I…”  He smiled.  “It was given to me,” he said, a truth that sounded like a lie.  “I had another.  It broke.  This was-” His fingers smoothed over the edge, learning the dimensions all over again.  “A gift.”
Steve held up his hands.  “Can someone please tell me-”
“You have more money than me,” Clint pointed out.  “You.  Have more money than-”
Steve watched her go.  “So...  Do I lead?” he asked Luke.
Jan nodded, very emphatic.  "Barathea.  Maybe a silk weave for drape."
“Hey, right now, you take the jobs you can get,” Happy said, opening the driver’s side door on the car.  “Do your best to hold onto both of ‘em this time.”
DJ blinked at him, slow and deliberate.  "Socket wrench," he said, the words a little easier now.  He reached out, nudging the tool with one finger.  He grinned at Tony.  "Show me?"
Jan's shoulders slumped, just a tiny bit.  "Well, it's not a lie, Cap," she said.  "In that, well, you ARE married."
“Where is the girl?” Gyrich said.
She let ut a mock gasp, her hand pressed to her chest.  “I went out of a sense of duty, to my kingdom, my people, and my brother,” she said.  “Also to keep him from bringing you BACK into the city, because from the moment he headed out, that’s what everyone assumed would be happening.”
Tony laughed.  “Did you have a good night?” he asked.
"We're lucky he didn't strip everything out of the workshop, along with the corporate assets," Pepper said.  She shook her head.  “That would've been a nightmare.”
He laughed, a horrible, fractured sound.  “Nothing,” he said, mostly to himself.  He shook away the touch, his arm coming up with more force than he’d intended.  The hand fell away, and as soon as it was gone, he regretted it, he regretted everything.  “Or, at least, nothing I have to offer.”
Justin cleared his throat.  “You shouldn’t, uh, you shouldn’t tweak him like that,” he said.  He fiddled with his fork.  “Can’t you-  Just keep your mouth shut for once.”
Steve reached into his pocket and came up with a few coins.  “But you did it anyway.  Thank you.”  He dropped them on the counter.  “This is why you can’t make rent.”
