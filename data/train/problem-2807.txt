"I'd like to do more than kick it," Dean flirts, shooting her a grin as Castiel rolls the dice. Vanessa has quickly learned that he gets very flirty and angry when drunk, which isn't playing out very well with monopoly.
It's a nice four-star hotel, she could always stay at a cheap motel for more than half the price, but she has the money and decided to be comfortable. She takes her suitcase out of the trunk and grabs her backpack and starts walking up to the front doors.
"It's just practice, " Vanessa smirks as she keeps up her slow pace with her hand. A low heat starts building inside of Dean as Vanessa swallows as much as she can without gagging.
Half hard he gets up and groans, Dean shuffles over to her dresser and rummage's through the bottom two drawers. The second to last bottom drawer had what he needed, but he looked through the last drawer anyway. A small shoebox next to two extremely old dolls is all that's in there, Dean knows that he shouldn't be looking, but, he isn't awake enough to care.
She buries her face into the crook of his neck and sighs. "I'vee misseed yoou," Vanessa murmurs into his neck.
Dean decides that the last outcome is plausible and stares at the angel's hand. Just fucking grab it you wimp, he yells at himself. Dean sighs, rolling his shoulders to get himself pumped up, he softly slides his hand into Castiel's, holding his breath the entire time.
Dean violently shakes his head no. Vanessa slowly approaches him, holding out the mug, showing him what it is. She slowly sits on the bed, she hands it to him, making sure her hand doesn't touch his. He looks at it and frowns, he lifts it up to his nose and takes a big whiff of it and gags.
"I will be honest with you because I wanna get this done quickly, my name," Vanessa pauses to take a breath in, "my name is Vanessa Goodwin. Sarah Winston, you have not gone in for your reevaluation, and I have to bring you in for it."
"And I have the rest of the ingredients at home, as well as a pack of beer" Vanessa sighs as she rests her head against the passenger window.
She has always hated the confrontation part of the job, sometimes her targets recognized her even with the different colored hair and eyes,Â which makes things more difficult.
"So, I have to ask, how long have two been dating?" Daniel asks, his brown eyes glued on Dean's face.
"Thanks," he says before he starts digging in. He pauses to watch his brother sleepily walk into the kitchen, his hair a mess, and his eyes still closed.
"Wow, that's pretty interesting, " Sam says, the look on his face told Dean that Sam will read every book Vanessa owns.
"And you?" The waiter turns to Tim, who doesn't say anything. "He'll have the same as me," Dean gestures to his brother. "Except with chocolate milk," Dean finishes with a grin.
A waiter quickly comes to them ready to take their orders. Dean didn't even realize that they're the only ones here except for a couple at one of the booths near the back. "What can I get for you boys?" He asks, brushing his curly sandy hair out of his face and hands them all a menu.
The front half of his shirt is soaking wet, Dean hopes it's water from a faulty sink and doesn't want to imagine what else it could be.
"If they desperately need my help, which I doubt they will since it's just a salt and burn, I will go," Castiel says before adding. "But since I don't think they will need my help, I will be right here, driving those nightmares away."
Unfortunately, they're interrupted by Sam honking the horn and yelling "I don't wanna watch this, either stay here or get your ass in the car", making them pull away from each other.
"He looks more like a Jim or a Jimmy to me," Sam hands over a can of warm beans that he just cooked on a campfire.
"I wish, but no I only have the dragons," Vanessa says. "When are we going to take down this small coven?"
She squints at him, he's not sure if it's from the light or the fact that she just woke up. Vanessa says something that is either gibberish or she said to quietly. She then snaps her fingers towards the living room, and the dragons slowly walk out of the room.
"You're sooo soooft," Vanessa slurs, running her fingers through Castiel's dark hair, she hums as one of her hands trace his jaw.
Once Dean returns, she takes one of the towels and wraps it around her head. "You don't have to be here for this Dean," Vanessa glances up at Dean, he is still hard and very patient.
"Cas, do you think you could gently put this egg on my bed?" Vanessa stands and cradles the egg in her arms.
"Alright, I'm ready. Bobby, you don't have to come, we both know that I'll be more than enough." Vanessa says as she walks around the corner into her dining room. She's brushing her now slightly poofy pink hair, trying to put it in a bun. Dean quickly looks her up and down then looks away and slightly blushes. She's wearing a colorful tie-dye tank top with a black sports bra underneath, her leggings are a pretty shade of dark blue almost black that hits her legs nicely, and she's wearing plain black tennis shoes.
He had called ahead to announce that he is coming and to ask where she will be, Vanessa manages to move across the country more than Sam and Dean! But that's only because she owns like a billion houses and apartments, which he and Sam have used, sometimes it gets a little weird stumbling upon some of the houses, but it sure beats staying at a motel.
She angrily wipes her eyes, which draws even more tears, before reading out loud. "A witch in A-Alabama refused to go to her re-eevaluation and is now on the run, blah blah blah, oh great...a level six," Vanessa grumbles the email out loud, a level six and above are usually the fun ones and make Vanessa excited to fight, but right now, she's to upset to be happy about that.
"So I've got another little wittle question," Vanessa slurs as Sam rolls the dice and lands on a tax space, he throws the amount of money he owes into free parking.
Dean nods and finishes up his coffee, placing the empty mug on the table. When his eggs are done, Daniel throws a couple of bacon slices on the plate and hands it to Dean. He happily digs into the eggs then takes a bite out of the bacon.
"I know it's been a night," Dean says, gripping the steering wheel tightly. "But does he have any ideas?"
Vanessa grabs Malachite's tail and starts pulling her closer to her. "Give. Me. The. Shirt," she grabs the shirt that's still in her jaws.
"That'll come in handy" Dean says as he slowly turns to walk away, but she grabs his arm once more and turns him to face her.
"Did you make these?" Dean asks as they lean on the railing once more, watching the eagle groom themself on a large tree branch. Their elegant brown body feathers reflect the sunlight beautifully.
Dean closes the door behind him and Vanessa pushes herself onto him. Her lips once again crashing onto his, but this time it's more hungry. Her soft lips perfectly fit with Dean's, he licks her bottom lip as his hands firmly caress her hips. She lets out a sexy moan as she opens her mouth to let Dean in, his tongue dominates hers as he cups her face.
"My family hunt very, very, very bad witches that cause my boss and others a lot of trouble. I get the occasional call from my boss, he tells me the information that I need, and I go and bring them back, dead or alive." Vanessa shrugs, "that's why the witch back there was so afraid of me" she sits down next to Bobby and leans on the armrest.
They slowly pull apart, blush on both of their faces. "That was lovely," Vanessa says slowly moving her arms from his neck.
"Okay, walk to the living room, calmly," Vanessa says firmly, to her dragons. She and two large winged beasts walk slowly towards the living room. The larger of the two tries to nip the smaller one, which they're met with a low growl. Both dragons lift their heads and sniff the air, blue eyes and pale yellow eyes stare at the boys, both of their lips curl back and both of their scaly wings spread out. "Knock it off you two, their our guests" Vanessa hisses.
Hours after the failed capturing and with a belly full of sushi, Vanessa sinks into the very soft hotel bed and turns on the TV to some movie about snakes.
Dean quickly gulps it down, he coughs as the taste still lingers in his mouth. He rubs his sore gums and hands the mug back to Vanessa.
"One down" he calls out, the other had moved to the other rooms, but the sound of another gun makes him somewhat cheerful. He still doesn't understand why Vanessa only came in with a knife.
"Of course, the guest bathroom is upstairs and the first door you'll see," Vanessa says as she heads for her kitchen and probably upstairs.
"I-I got nothing," Sam rubs the back of his neck. "Except for the fact that they hatch from eggs. Right? Thats still their thing?"
When he got back, he could barely even stand, let alone unpack 'Baby'. So instead, he just left everything, ate a slice or two of pepperoni pizza, and collapsed in his bedroom; but not before taking his shoes and jeans off of course.
"I don't know, a holding room? Whatever, secondly, it isn't the worst idea, but I don't think he's a demon," Sam huffs. "He didn't react to holy water or silver."
Sam has agreed that the best course of action would be to take Tim to their bunker and make sure he isn't internally hurt, which Tim would have brought up at breakfast, and make sure he's safe.
He makes a small dent in his thirst as he downs the cup of water. He wipes his mouth and tosses the cup into the sink. He walks out of the kitchen and shuffles up the large wooden stairs. He quietly walks past the bathroom and into the guest bedroom next to it. When Dean first woke up in this strange room, he immediately knew that this was where Vanessa kept any prisoners she had, the sudden smell of sweat and blood that was covered in the scent of flowers hit him like a train. Nevertheless, he didn't complain, it was mostly because he didn't want to show his soon-to-be-gone-fangs.
After hours of laughing, storytelling, and plenty of drinks, Vanessa writes down on a piece of paper all the addresses of her safe houses and the passwords to them. They drive her home and Dean politely walks her up to her doorstep as Bobby says goodbye and hops in his car and Sam patiently waits in the car.
She smiles even wider as she keeps a fast but sloppy pace, drool slipping out of her mouth and down her chin. Vanessa looks up at Dean, her face is completely red with blush from what they're doing and concentration. Her gorgeous brown eyes are replaced with her neon yellow eyes that seem to be glowing, he swallows as they lock eyes with each other.
"HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?" Vanessa yells, thoughts of different ways she could've handled runs through her head like a bullet train.
"Yup, that and among other things, I'll explain it as we go," Vanessa says, she grabs her beer bottle and opens it with ease. "But first, I need a couple of these in me before we start."
"O-okay, " Dean replies but he's met with the sound of the freezing water splashing onto the tiles and his bare feet.
Dean walks over to the table to watch her in hunger, she starts humming to the song that Dean recognizes as Kashmir. "I didn't know you like Led Zeppelin, " Dean yawns, Vanessa walks over to him with a mug in hand.
"Hmm, Red vs Blue is very high up on the list, but I watch a lot of documentaries," Vanessa rubs her chin.
"C'mon Dean, you can go naked for all I care," Vanessa calls through the cabin's front door. Vanessa is currently wrapped in a towel that she brought with nothing underneath except for the necklace around her neck, she ignores the slight burning sensation from the silver charms and the increasing bug bites on her bare legs as she waits for Dean to change.
Vanessa groans, a few air bubbles float to the top. She takes a deep breath in through her gills and opens her eyes to find that the sun has barely risen. She rubs her tired eyes, making sure she doesn't accidentally poke herself in the eye with her long nails again.
To which Dean just replies with a curt "shut up." Tim slides into the recliner next to him, pulling the lever to make the footrest go up like Dean had shown him the day before. "So what is this?" Tim turns his head to look at Dean.
Dean and Castiel watch Sam leave than Castiel turns to look at Dean. His blue eyes also glowing in the pale moonlight, and his wings are perfectly outlined by the light. "I'm going to stay out here and watch over her, you should go inside and try to get some sleep."
"Well until Bobby does arrive, we have a guest to entertain," Dean says, a small smile creeping up onto his face. "Which means we've got movies to watch!"
"Oh sorry, okay give me your hands," he says offering his hands, she swims closer to the edge and grabs his soft hands. He crouches down towards her to get a better grip and pulls her out of the water with ease.
"I've lived Blue Planet, I've swum with whales and sharks, I've been to depths no human has ever seen, I wish I could take you down there but the pressure would crush you in an instance," Vanessa hums, memories of spending some quantity of time with her mom so deep below the ocean that the only light came from their bioluminescent scales.
"Well," Dean says as takes the spoon from his fist. "You hold it like this, and then you scoop the beans, which are in this can," he points to the steaming can in Tim's hand. "Then you put it in your mouth."
"Whoa, Cas, was there a guard down there?" Vanessa walks over to him and brushes her fingers over the bruise. He grabs her hands and lightly rubs it.
"Well, you better not ruin my seats, get in," Dean grumbles as he slides into the Impala. He glances at the rearview mirror, Tim's borrowed shirt is soaked along with Sam's sweat pants, he notices that he is shivering slightly and Dean turns up the heat from him as Sam slides in next to him.
"Sam's in the car" Dean mumbles as he follows her outside. The heat already makes him feel like he's melting and he can already tell that he's starting to sweat. They run down Vanessa's front yard and climb into the impala.
Dean glances up to the rearview mirror, Tim is happily crunching on his cereal, not even listening in on what he and Sam are saying. Chewing on his bottom lip, Dean's gaze turns back to the road ahead. "I'm not really sure what he could be," Dean sighs. "And I don't even know where to start."
The sound of the elevator opening brings Vanessa back to reality, she turns off her phone and steps out of the elevator, past a small family of three. She jogs down the hall towards the main room, she turns left to the dining room.
Vanessa brushes her lips on the cool surface of the egg before pulling out a couple of her softest shirts and making a nest for the egg. She then pulls out a large comfortable shirt and leggings to go with it. Vanessa quickly pulls off her shirt and digs through her underwear drawer to find a set of non-lacey underwear.
Dean closes the door behind him as Castiel rushes to help keep Vanessa stable. "How much did you allow her to drink?"
"But, that doesn't mean it's a no. I'll just have to think about it Dean, for right now I'm hungry, so I am going to grab something to eat and probably not look your brother in the eyes until maybe tomorrow." Vanessa pats Dean's chest as she stands up.
Dean freezes as he realizes that she the most beautiful woman he has ever laid eyes on. "I-umm" is all he can muster.
Vanessa grabs the glass vile as Dean places the wooden spoon where the vile was. Dean watches im awe as Vanessa takes a pinch of the scales and sprinkles them in. Dean watches and chuckles, the pot is supposed to be used for boiling crabs so it's supposed to be tall, so tall that Vanessa needs a step stool.
Vanessa hesitates for a split second then makes her move, she aims for his head and he dodges. He punches her in the stomach, she groans and stomps on his foot. He takes a step back and kicks her in the leg. She cries out in pain and drops to the floor, the vamp comes in for the kill but she stabs him in the knee.
They fall into a comfortable silence, not counting them blurting out the answers, which surprisingly to Dean Tim nails each one. Dean can't help but glance over at the man, his wild hair doesn't seem to be singed anymore and his eyes appear to be glowing from the faint TV light.
Dean bites his lip and focuses on the road, just fifteen more minutes and we'll eat, he tells himself as he reaches over Sam to grab the box of cassette tapes and pops in a new one.
"Don't apologize, I wanted it to be a date too, but I was too much of a chicken to actually call it one and properly ask you out."
She sighs when she hears the sound of wing beats. "With what?" Castiel asks, appearing right in front of her. His large black wings are spread out, but he slowly reels them back towards him.
"I would never ignore you," Castiel says after loud wing beats. He doesn't even make Dean jump in surprise.
After who knows how long, Vanessa gets gently shaken awake by a very warm figure. She wraps her arms around their arm and sighs, breathing in their honey-sweet scent. "Vanessa, no, you need to wake up and eat" their gravelly voice wakes her up more.
"It's something that we do to 'claim' each other or show that we love each other, I didn't mean to do it to you without your permission," Vanessa says, blushing even more.
"You never told me to do that," he argues, his ocean blue eyes turn dark as he continues to glare at him.
"You're welcome, " she says rubbing her face on his neck and tracing an unknown pattern on his chest, his shirt wet with sweat.
He unlocks his car and yanks the door open, he throws the bag into the empty passenger seat and slides into the driver's. Dean closes the door and rests his head in his hands.
I apologize for this chapter being so late, it was my cousin's birthday recently so of course, we spent like 4+ hours on Thursday and Friday talking and playing games!
Vanessa dashes through the living room and up the stairs, she almost hit Castiel but his wings stop her. His long inky black primary feathers tickle her arms, in his arms are neatly folded clothes.
He turns around and heads for the door, as soon as he walks through Sam grabs him from behind, covers his mouth, and leads him away from the others. Once they're far enough, Vanessa cleanly cuts his head off and gags. "Man they stink" she murmurs.
"Wow," Castiel gasps as his gaze falls on the majestic beast in front of them. "I never imagined they'd look this beautiful."
"Sounds good Dean," Sam says as he adjusts his seat belt. "Tim?" Dean waits for Tim to realize that words are being spoken to him, which he just turns his head to look at Dean. "Hmm?" He says, clearly didn't pay attention to what anyone was saying.
"Only about a thousand, but I'll hear it again, I'll even tell y'all about how I took down a pack of werewolf witches" Vanessa replies sweetly.
"Ah well," Sam smiles, he brings a hand up to his long hair and runs through it. "After you two left, Cas had gotten us more drink, found the strong stuff and I think he won, but it's just a blur."
Dean sneaks glances in the rearview mirror, watching Tim as he nods his head to the beat of the songs and gazes out the window with a fascinated expression on his face.
"Thanks," Dean says as he buckles up too. He drives from underneath the small birch tree and manages to turn around in the narrow road and starts driving towards the exit.
"There," she says, she clears her throat, trying to remember how he spoke. How deep his voice was, how loud he was, and how he pronounces each letter. "Alright, I'll go in there, boss someone around and lead them out here, where you'll jump out and kill them," she says in the vamp's gruff voice.
"Hunters" the other two hiss. One with a large nose and her hair in a long braid grabs the knife from the forehead of one of the witches and stands up.
"I'm fine, that reminds me, us three need to have a little talk. I assume Dean is currently sleeping so I'll tell him later" Vanessa says, she pulls her pajama pants legs up and reveals her scarlet legs. "A full moon is coming,Â  which means, like a werewolf, I will shift."
All three of them watch in awe as she dives deeper, they move from the fire towards the pool. Dean can't make out Vanessa's whole body in the dark until she breaches the surface. "Coldwater is so relaxing sometimes" Vanessa sighs as she moves to float on her back.
"How much longer until we reach 'the bunker' Dean?" Tim tilts his head and meets Dean's eyes in the rearview mirror.
They quickly eat their breakfast and leave Tim on his log stool while they pack up the camp. "We need to bring him to the bunker," Dean whispers as he stuffs the folded tent into the trunk.
"That is our new guest, Tim," Dea replies, deciding that eleven in the morning is way too early for this.
"Thanks, " she grins, Vanessa pulls his attention away from her amazing chest to her face, she pushes up to kiss him again. Her hands run from Dean's side down to his borrowed pajama pants.
She hums the song and dives into the pool, Dean sighs and walks over to the firepit, taking a seat next to his smiling brother. "That was fun to watch."
"You saw those?" Vanessa hisses, hoping that she didn't scare them by the sudden scales and fins, she thought it was bad enough that she showed them her horrifying fangs.
Vanessa sticks her tongue out at him as she opens her container and hums, Dean glances over at it to find it's full of shells. "Are those snails?" He asks before taking a bite of his delicious burger.
Dean sighs, turning the engine on and the radio. He heads for the exit debating on if he should call Castiel back or not. But he knows for sure that he should get on the road and that this mess is Sam's fault somehow.
"Now if you excuse me, I'm going to try and sleep extra early tonight, Dean you can take my room if wanted, " Vanessa says when she slips back into the water, she pushes away from the pool wall and swims deeper into the water, trying not to splash them with water.
"Vanessa," Castiel begins, grabbing both of her hands, "the full moon is rising, you need to get in the water."
The other person on the phone sounds very upset, Dean watches in horror as Vanessa's eyes become watery, almost as if she's about to cry. "I'm sorry sir," she says, turning around to attend to the bacon. "Wait. She is dead? Then why are you yelling at me?" Vanessa pauses, "sorry, oh, it just came up? Well then, I can take another job instead."
"Well, we met her sometime in June, but then a friend of ours had passed away and he was the one that sent us her way, so we didn't talk at all after the funeral until a few months ago," Dean explains, his gaze shifts from Daniel towards the kitchen as he hears large nails scrape across the tile, which ment Vanessa's other dragon Pluto was coming.
"She didn't take it very well? She said that she would love to but she can't drop her weird job and her two fucking dragons." Dean sighs. "Plus, I didn't really present the question very well."
Thank the seas that the boys don't know much about her past, but Vanessa knows she'll have to open up someday, and maybe that date can help.
"Well, I don't think I should be the one to talk about that, but I came here when you opened that door and scream," Castiel hums, "it was horrific to see what happened and that dream didn't seem much like one, it felt like it was a memory."
Soon Dean finishes making the rest of the pancakes and bacon and puts them in the fridge, but not before stuffing his plate with as much as he can fit. He slides into the seat in front of Sam and sets his plate down, drowning his pancakes in syrup before he begins to eat. "Any plans for the day?"
Sam...that son of a bitch. It's his fault, if he hadn't told Castiel what a fucking date is and who knows what else, Castiel claiming that they are on a date never could have happened!
"Not as pretty as my sister's, she got them from my mom," Vanessa hums and buries her face into his chest. "They're a pretty blue."
"Calm down, he just smells different, a very good different, once he comes back you'll notice," Vanessa says, continuing to grab more glass bottles. "In the meantime, once I'm done with this I thought that we could go upstairs and
"Of course," he takes the egg carefully in his arms, he spreads his great raven black wings and with a few flaps, he's gone.
Dean's eyes snap open, he looks at his surroundings to find pitch-black everything. He shuffles onto his left side to find a pair of uncanny yellow gleaming eyes staring at him. His first reaction is to jump back and his next is to swing his tired arm at the glowing eyes.
"Okay, I have an idea, I'll admit it's kinda weird, but I need you to trust me," she tells Sam as she scans the dead vamp's body.
"Now for the best part, " she rubs her hands together as Sam shoots her a confused look. With a snap of her fingers, the door opens and she kicks the head into the room. In a blink of an eye, she changes back to her normal form as the other two vampires scream.
Vanessa opens her mouth to say something, but the sound of Sarah running down a hall makes Vanessa's mouth go dry so she closes her mouth, and continues to fiddle with Castiel's feather.
Dean has heard that speech many times, but after that, they are usually friendly to him. Except for that one guy who just kept threatening him so much that Dean just up and left.
"Your new friend, I would never carve out anyone heart or soul, nor would I do that to an innocent dragon. They are endangered after all" Vanessa says as she wipes the blood off of her knife on her leggings.
"I have one, it's in the room Sam will be staying in" Vanessa replies, scratching her burning legs, "I mostly read, I have a lot of books, most of them are lore."
She opens the door wider so they can come in. The living room is small but cozy, it has two matching chairs that face a black leather couch. Behind the chairs is a fireplace that has a lot of candles and pictures on its mantle.
"It really isn't that bad, but it's hard to learn and understand it, it's basically just a bunch of screeching, wailing, clicks, and for some words it whale calls, " Vanessa explains as she continues to scratch her legs.
He nods, his wings drooping even more. "I got bored of watching over Sam, so I came to watch you instead" he replies.
"-butterfly," Dean sighs, he doesn't like to hit butterflies but they are lazy fucks that fly too slow.
"What are you doing?" Dean hears a gruff voice ask, after flipping a pancake, he turns around to find a bleary-eyed Tim.
Dean's eye twitches in anger. His cheeks are getting even redder as this goes on. "You know what? I was going to yell at you, but fuck you, fuck Sam, and fuck this, you're flying your ass home." Dean pushes past him and stomps into the crowd. Almost as clear as day he can hear wings flapping and the sound of someone gasping.
"Because she's a friend, a very powerful friend, and I can tell she likes you, so don't go makin' her mad. Okay?" Bobby says as he pushes away Pluto.
"Yes, they are venomous, males have a barb on their feet filled with toxins," Vanessa confirms. "I am not venomous. Which I am glad I'm not, venom would just get in the way."
"Well, I saw a sign back there saying in fifteen miles we'll be at a, uh, gas station," Sam mumbles and pulls out his phone.
When they had reached the bunker, they were all tired. Sam had gotten Tim settled down in one of the many spare rooms available as Dean scrounge up the energy to go and quickly grab a pizza.
"You can fly us toâ" Dean pulls out the map from his jean pocket. "Here." He points to where the gift shop is, "if youâ" Dean is suddenly blinded by the sun as he feels Castiel strongly grip his shoulder. "Can," he finishes.
"We were hunting down a vamp nest outside this city, there were too many for the three of us to handle soâ" Sam gets interrupted by Vanessa.
"Cas?" Vanessa says, his gaze doesn't break from the TV but he hums in response. "I think I pulled, wait, I
Sam sighs and says "Hi, my name is Sam Winchester, this" Sam puts his hand on Dean's stiff shoulder "is my frozen brother, Dean."
"So when I burn the map, the spell will save the piece where our target is located," Vanessa says, pouring the spell ingredients onto a map of the city.
Dean shakes his head. This isn't a date, a date requires two people, in Dean's book. Someone pays for the whole thing if it's a first date (like dinner), and both people have to at least like each other, it can't be one-sided. That is exactly why this isn't a date. It's a friend date! No that's still a date, this is nothing like a date.
Dean glances back at the stove to make sure nothing will catch on fire for the minute he's gone then goes over to help Tim. "It's easy," Dean says hovering over the plate and picking up the bottle of syrup. "You wanna pour this stuff over the pancakes, like so," he says as he drowns the pancake with the sweet syrup. "Then you cut up the pancakes with the fork then stuff it in your mouth. Voila!"
"I can take that up to him, " she inches her hand to the handle if the mug, waiting for approval. Sam nods and rubs his eyes and yawns.
You can find me on Tumblr at blueberryrock (which is my main) and rando-fandom-drabbles (which is where imma put my fics and whatnot) so go follow me over there and drop in to say hi!
"I was going to make you try one way or another," Vanessa says with a smile before turning the music back up.
Dean whips around to look at Vanessa, his short hair is combed to perfection, he is wearing a pair of sweat pants that are definitely not hers and a Led Zeppelin t-shirt that could be hers. "Morning gorgeous," Dean says with a smile, he turns back to the sizzling food as Vanessa takes a seat next to Sam.
"Well, you should've let it cool down," Dean tries not to laugh. Tim glares at him as he fans his mouth.
Vanessa hisses and rubs her aching legs, Sam didn't notice, but Cas did. "Are you okay?" He asks, moving to stand next to her.
"Well I didn't wanna teach him how to eat in front of people," Dean points to Tim, who is happily eating his beans.
"We probably should," Dean nods his head, but no one moves. Instead, they both slowly fall asleep together. Not peacefully for Vanessa.
"Wow Nessa, this looks awesome," Dean holds up the fossilized tooth up to the sun. "I think this is a shark tooth," Dean holds out the rock for Vanessa to takes back, to which she pushes his hand back towards him.
Vanessa scratches right around where Pluto's horns begin, knowing that it's the best place to scratch. Pluto lets out a pleasured filled purr as Vanessa digs her nails into his scaley skin.
He watches the stranger wiggle his head through the correct hole and then wiggle his arms through the correct holes. "Good job, you have it on backward...but great job uhh," Dean says, trying to remember if the man had said his name. "Tim, you look like a Tim to me."
"I swear to the seas if you manage to rip my brand new shirt, I am going to be livid," Vanessa growls, she grabs the shirt with one hand as blue smoke flows out of her other hand and pries Malachite's mouth open letting the shirt sleeve slip from her teeth.
"Let's get you some food and back to the hotel," Castiel says, turning her around then pushing her to walk.
"He's talking about my little party trick," Vanessa says. "Here, I'll show you but I need a better song to sing to," Vanessa mutters the last part as she scrolls through her phone that's connected to the radio. With a grin, Vanessa starts up another song by Journey.
Dean pulls into the parking lot of Maria's bar. The parking lot is nearly filled to the brim with trucks, cars, and motorcycles. Dean pulls into an open space next to a large blue jeep and pulls out the keys from the ignition. They all exit the car and walk inside, and a jukebox is blasting some country song about rain and someone crying, a bar is way in the back with tables in front of it. They settle down in a square table for four next to many other filled tables. Many people are dancing, getting drinks from or at the bar, and eating delicious smelling burgers.
Sam shakes his head 'no', Dean heads for the door, immediately wishing to be back next to the fire. Hopefully, by the time they leave, it'll be warmer, it is only early march but it is freezing in Ohio.
Dean stands up and stretches, groaning after his back pops, and heads for the kitchen, leaving Sam behind.
"Would you be willing to do that again later?" Dean turns his head to look at her. Her chocolate brown eyes that Dean loves are back again meaning her gills are gone, but her long nails and the webbing between her fingers remain.
"Oh, I'm sorry for your loss. Vanessa told me a little bit about that, guess she was too shaken up about that, but she tells me great things about you two," he points to Sam and Dean.
"My, uh, siren form. I think right now is the perfect time to do it, although you guys might wanna put on a jacket or something, " Vanessa explains excitedly.
Hey guys I'm back with another chapter! I hope you guys enjoy this series, I definitely enjoy writing it. Feel free to leave any comments and I'll reply!
The next habitat they see is for wolves. There are five lying in the sun, three-light gray ones, one with red coloring, and one brown one.
Dean's green eyes bore into her own, knowing she's trying to change the subject he just goes along with it. "Yes, Daniel was nice," Dean sighs, he wiggles her arm under Vanessa and pulls her close to him. "When I was making your birthday pie, he told me about siren courting things."
"Well you can go ahead and go downstairs, I to wanna change, " Vanessa says, she grabs her phone that's charging on the nightstand. It has been about a week since she has taken this bounty and spoken to Dean in person, but they text each other daily and say goodnight to each other.
Slowly, Dean's eyes shift from the book on the table to the man in front of him. Tim's unnerving gaze meets Dean's.
Vanessa is comfortably curled up on her bed with a large leather book in her lap. "Did you need something Dean?" She asks softly.
"Yes," Dean squeaks. "I-I want one." Castiel grins once more and moves to sit on his lap, his lips an inch from Dean's, the angel pins Dean in the chair as Dean cups Castiel's face.
"Vanessa?" Dean's muffled voice calls from behind the door, Vanessa freezes, she knows what he's going to ask if she lets him in, but if she doesn't, he'll probably just come in anyways.
"Not even a little bit, I should've taken Cas' offer of putting me to sleep then having him wake me up" Dean sighs, "I did however read all about how sirens shift to their fish forms and the, uhh, great war of sirens and how each tribe fought over the entire Atlantic ocean!"
The man fell from the sky, god knows what would be after him. Thankfully the bunker can ward off quite a couple of creatures and keep him hidden from most. Not to mention that they'll be surrounded by books on creatures that Dean didn't even know existed, and hopefully, it will have something about people falling out of the sky next to burnt-looking wings.
"What? Oh no, they have like a billion different types of animals there, Bobby took us here once, and it was amazing," Dean grins. "Trust me you'll like it, love it even."
All the color has been drained from his face, and Vanessa is sure that if he opened his eyes, they'd be a dull green. His short brown hair is drenched in sweat, the only thing that tells Vanessa that he's alive is the fact that he's breathing.
"So I've gotta ask," Dean says as they start to make their circle. "Why spots? Like how does that even help them?"
"It's not just some zoo, it's the Columbus zoo! Come on, don't make me go by myself," Dean begs. He tries to give him his best puppy eyes but it doesn't work, instead, Sam just looks back at his laptop.
"Huh, then who is?" Vanessa asks, rubbing her wet scales. Like a snake in shed, her scales start rubbing off in mostly one piece. Usually, she has to do this part alone because everyone thinks it hurts but it's more like an itch being scratched.
"No, you can have it after the rest of the food is done," Dean declares, turning his attention to a small bowl. Vanessa groans as she stares at the fish, getting hungrier by the second, but she does wait like a good little shrimp.
"Why are you awake," he squints at her. Right, humans don't have night vision. Vanessa chews on the inside of her lip as she listens to Dean's mumbling.
Vanessa's boss's boss wanted her to be the one sending people bounties or running the people who do that, but that means extra work and she doesn't get to do any fieldwork, which is the fun part.
She spies the dragon egg that her dad gifted her, the sun shimmering across the scaley outside. "I've forgotten all about you," she murmurs and picks up the egg, frowning when she feels the ice-cold surface. "I'm so sorry, I promise I'll put you into incubation today."
Dean only wants to find a cool magnet or another kind of nic nack in case if they don't come back. He lets go of the angel's warm hand and tells him to go and see if ge can find something nice.
"Sounds good to me," Castiel tears his gaze from the tv to Vanessa, his blue eyes seem to glow in the morning light.
Dean chews on his lip and glances in the rearview mirror for what seems to be the hundredth time. Tim sleeping with his head on the glass, his soft lips slightly parted, and his messy hair is just too distracting for Dean.
"I do want to try and eat breakfast, so if you could let me go I can get dressed and we can go downstairs and try to eat," Vanessa sighs, Castiel unwraps his arms from her waist but his wings don't budge. "Cas, buddy, I kinda need you to move your wings."
Vanessa sighs, "as a dare, I had to get even drunker and combine a famous painting with someone in my family, so I horribly painted my sister as the Mona Lisa and I painted a terrible mustache on her" she smiles as she remembers the fond memory.
"You gonna cum for me angel?" And as soon as she finishes that he explodes all over her hand causing the lamp light bulbs to explode and shatter all over her stuff on the bedside tables.
They finally pull away after what felt like eons (probably five seconds). Vanessa returns to Dean's side as Castiel leans on the island, his wings drooping as he relaxes. "How did you sleep?" He looks Vanessa up and down.
Dean falls on his butt from the blinding light, he rubs his eyes and opens them. He looks up at the sky in confusion, he sees a comet in the sky. A huge comet...a blindingly bright comet...that sounds like it's screaming...Dean watches in awe as the comet comes closer and closer to the campsite until he realizes that it's not a comet. It's a person.
He groans as he pulls out a butcher's knife that is rusty and has an overwhelming smell of old blood. He slams the drawer loudly and curses at himself silently, hoping that no one woke up. He saunters over to the bed and falls on it, shoving his face into his pillow, breathing in its harsh flowery scent. He shuts his eyes in hopes that he falls asleep, during his time as a vampire he hasn't slept a wink, most of it was out of fear of the others killing him and the rest was out of fear of what they'd do to him asleep.
"They're gentle giants, like blue whales, but what's your favorite TV show Dean?" Vanessa nudges him as he thinks.
"Yeah! Vanessa made breakfast today and I thought before we leave, I should make a huge breakfast for us."
"Yeah that one, so I pitched in and created the cheetah," Castiel hums, his big smile still plastered on his face.
After a few seconds, Dean can hear the rumble of Vanessa's car, and when he hears the car door close his stomach grumbles. He forgot how hungry he is.
"Oh right, I forgot about that, well did you sleep at all last night," Sam asks as he runs his hand through his tangled hair.
Castiel and Vanessa take the living room seats as the old woman steps out of the room. "Sarah," she yells "we have guests and they are here for you."
Vanessa flips onto her stomach and drags herself from the shoreline, she sits up straight and starts to squeeze the lake water out of her hair.
Dean's eyes snap open at the sound of someone's door opening and then quietly closing. Dean quickly gets off the bed and stretches before exiting the room as quietly as they were. The bright morning light from the window above the stairs floods the hallway. Blinded from the bright sunlight Dean staggers down the stairs, only taking a few steps per minute, he rubs his temple, feeling a headache coming in.
Pluto, who has decided to fall asleep next to the couch that Dean and Castiel are on, suddenly wakes himself up and watches her put the shirt down. "I swear, if you two steal my brand spanking new shirt, I will punt you off the roof," Vanessa threatens as she reaches for the next gift.
The hour passes by quickly as Dean reads in silence, only the sound of pages turning and the soft sound of his breath fills the library. That is until he hears fabric rub together, like when someone shifts in their seat.
"I don't see why not. Sam will be in there for a while, while freaking out over a couple of bubbles I accidentally made it explode and got it on the ceiling," Castiel giggles.
"You'll understand when we get there. Now come on, I wanna get there before it gets too packed," Dean says, pushing the angel out the door.
Vanessa opens the door and closes it behind her and heads straight for the stairs. Once she is in her room, she closes the door quietly behind her and throws herself onto her bed.
Vanessa stuffs her phone in her pajama pants pocket and walks out of the room, wanting to check on Sam and look over Cas, then she'll make breakfast. She walks out into the sunlit hallway and glances over at the door she sent Cas through. Thankfully he accepted her apology, she didn't want to make him mad like all the other angel she's met. She runs down the stairs and turns to walk into the living room. She pauses when she doesn't see Sam on the couch.
"I wish," Castiel shakes his head. The eagle stops grooming its feathers and stares at Castiel. "But Michael made most of the birds, modeled their wings after ours and one bird's coloring to everyone's wings."
Alex Trebek's voice fills the small room, masking the sounds of the door opening and closing. The only way Dean knew that someone had entered was when one of the contestants blurted out eucalyptus and scared the shit out of Dean when they laughed at the wrong answer.
"There is a cure for vampires we just have to hope that Dean hasn't drank any blood, " Sam says as he puts his blood-stained shirt on.
"That's a very simple plan," Cas says, "and Dean might attack you two, so I should be the one to rescue him."
"Well, I am thankful that you woke up before me to make it, instead of sleeping in and letting me be a good host," Vanessa lies, not wanting to tell him the whole truth and weird him out.
He lets out a loud groan as Vanessa rubs the tip of his throbbing cock. "I-I don't think I will last m-much longer," Castiel gasps.
Hearing Sam's snoring and another rumble of thunder, Dean groans and sits up. Rubbing his stiff back, the sleeping bags are nowhere near comfortable as his bed, (it's memory foam!)
"Then Friday would be great, the wait will suck because I don't have any plans," Vanessa mumbles, her eyes quickly glance up at Dean's.
After ten minutes, the sound of the shower turning off tells everyone to start heading out. Dean and Bobby head to the impala as Vanessa stays behind to put her dragons away. Dean turns the keys and the impala roars to life as Bobby gets in the back, they wait not even a full minute for everyone to get into the car. Vanessa happily sits in the front to silently flirt with Dean and to help with directions as he starts blasting the radio.
"I hope he comes back soon," Vanessa says, then a sound echoes through the room, like someone trying to open a door with their hands full.
When Dean reaches the bottom he staggers towards the voice's origin to find Sam sitting on the couch in the living room. "Yeah, " he groans rubbing his eyes. He quickly shuffles towards the opened windows and closes them all, his eyes adjust to the wonderful darkness, his small headache is quickly gone.
"Do you need help?" Dean stands to his feet and slowly walks toward them. "If you can pin her wings like a chicken I'll be able to pry open her mouth," Vanessa growls.
"Jesus fuck," Dean gasps as he sees Castiel suddenly appears next to him on the couch. "Cas, buddy, warning next time."
"Man, you're good at singing," Dean says as he takes the last bite, "and the food was delicious." Dean stands up and stretches, taking his plate and finishing off his tea and putting them in the sink, he walks over to Vanessa to kiss her on the head than goes back to the table to sit and watch her work.
Giddy with excitement, Dean gladly crawls back out of the tent and jumps to his feet. Heading for the Impala to grab supplies. Dean opens the trunk and the compartment in it. The compartment is filled to the brim with weapons they've collected over the years from monster hunting.
She sighs and makes the mirror disappear, she puts the soft t-shirt on and walks over to her dresser to find pants. Once she finds a good fuzzy black pair she quickly exits her room and runs down the stairs, eager to confront Dean and have his breakfast.
find it (under his mattress). On the cover is a beautiful Asian woman with blue eye shadow and red lips smiling sweetly, Dean frowns and furrows his brows. Shaking his head, Dean gently takes the magazine from Tim's hands and places it back on the rack. "Why don't you go grab a snack?"
"Not just my tail, my fins, and gills too." Vanessa explains, "and I assume you guys will be here for as long as Dean needs, and that might be through the full moon."
The angel shrugs and puts his book down. "Sure, but what's a zoo?" he asks as he slides off the bed.
like Led Zeppelin? It's a good fucking band!" She turns back to what's she's doing, she pulls out a wooden spoon from a drawer and grabs a huge bottle of something from underneath the sink.
"One down," Vanessa hands back Dean's pole and grabs a couple of worms to stick on her pole. "I think five more to go."
"Once again. You'll see, " Vanessa says with a grin. She places the plates in the sink and motions for them to follow her. Both brothers stand up and follow her out of the kitchen and into the living room. They walk past the couch, and to a glass door that Dean has never noticed before.
She looks around the room, it's a four-star hotel so it's nice and pretty. The walls are painted a nice sunset orange and the sheets are an elegant light blue, there is a large tv in front of the bed and a large black couch in between. Next to the bed is a large window that overlooks the lake
"Vanessa" Bobby calls out as he climbs out of his car, "you better not be closing your door on my boys," he says as he walks into her view.
(I of course don't own any of those songs if you wanna check them out the names in order are Lights by Journey and Separate Ways also by Journey, and the album Black is by Metallica!)
"What the fuck" She yells rubbing her tired eyes. She glares at the angel, his wound doesn't seem to be bothering him anymore, but his large feathery wings seemed to droop at her response. "Were you watching me sleep?" She asks, clearly annoyed.
The shirt was the Starry Night painting with a stormtrooper. "This looks awesome!" Vanessa exclaims and lays on the growing pile of shirts.
With a smirk on his face, Dean happily walks away, towards the kitchen. He walks past the dining table to the stairs, he pauses at the little black baby gate, not knowing how to open it, he fiddles with the handle and it swings open.
"I don't think I have been in any motel this nice," Castiel mutters, his eyes glued onto one of the TVs above the bar.
"Really? Wow, that's awesome!" Dean exclaims. Vanessa looks at Dean and rolls her eyes. "It really is, Sam and I have seen a lot of things, and I bet you'll be the prettiest."
Dean slips on his shoes (not before checking for any critters) and heads for his car, his baby to be exact. Maybe if he can't sleep in the tent with his loud brother, perhaps he can just sleep in his car and try to ignore the thunder.
"You're no fun, but you are very handsome," Vanessa says and Castiel's wings fluff at the compliment. Vanessa frees her hand and boops him on the nose and says "boop." Dean suddenly remembers that Sam is present and currently snickering at them.
Vanessa lets out a small sigh once it's off, Dean grabs one of her large breasts, barely fitting in his entire hand. "You're so beautiful, " he says, planting a kiss in between her boobs, he pinches one of her nipples as he licks and nibbles on the other one.
"Want anything?" Dean turns to Sam as he steps out seeing Sam shake his head no, Dean steers Tim into the building.
"I don't know, I assume he's asleep so I thought I'd make breakfast and then I'll wake him up," Vanessa says.
Her heart starts pounding as horrible memories arise, she stares at her mugs of tea, waiting for it to turn cold. "No. I-I changed my mind."
"Yes, but, I'll probably just do that tomorrow, I'm pretty tired," Vanessa says, turning her gaze from Cas to Dean "even if it's barely seven, saving your ass took a lot out of me, I could pass out right now!"
"Thanks." He grumbles. Vanessa herds them inside and into her air-conditioned house. Dean wipes his sweaty forehead and looks around. The walls are painted a calming shade of light blue, and the flooring was a nice tan carpet. Two long brown couches face each other with a dark wood coffee table in the middle, Dean raises an eyebrow as he notices that one of the legs is missing and is replaced with a large stack of books. Deep scratches cover the entire table and couches. Past the couches, the room continues to where the dining room begins and an archway leads to where Dean assumes is a kitchen.
"A book that Cas brought, haven't read that much into it yet, hopefully, it can shed some light on why we can see his wings," Vanessa holds up the book for Dean to see. "Suppose to be about their anatomy, so it'll be fun I guess."
"That bitch, I thought I locked that stuff up pretty good," Vanessa's gaze immediately goes to the pantry by the stairs, knowing she has a secret compartment in there that holds the vast collection of her favorite alcohol.
They, meaning Castiel, decide to skip ahead to the reptiles, which Dean doesn't mind one bit. Joy fills his chest when he sees the angel's face when they reach the reptile building.
Deans adds as much bacon as he can to the pan before turning his attention to the pancakes. Soon the kitchen is filled with the scent of bacon and the sound of it sizzling.
"There we are, house four o' six in this cute little suburb," Vanessa says picking up the small smoking piece of the map. Vanessa looks up and the angel and says "Let's do this!"
"You can read all about my kind, how there are five main tribes, named after the oceans, and the seven lesser tribes, named after seas" Vanessa explains.
"Speaking of presents," Daniel snaps his fingers. "Your aunt's gift came today, I gave Sam the key when he left."
"Do you have wrapping paper? Cause I didn't have any nor a chance to buy some and wrap her presents," Dean says, standing up and grabbing the bag.
Vanessa quickly looks away and stands up, "well I'm glad you're feeling better, you better get some rest," she says as she fiddles with her hair.
"Woah!" Dean exclaims as he dashes to her side, he pulls the chair towards him and pulls her onto her feet and into a tight hug. Vanessa presses her face herself into his warm chest and starts crying. Deans pets her unbrushed hair and she continues to cry, he slowly moves to sit on the chair with her on his lap and her legs hanging off the chair.
"Sam? Care to do the honors?" Vanessa turns to look at him, Sam nods and walks up to the black-haired girl and quickly cuts her head off. Her body drops to the ground and the curly-haired guy lets out a loud cry of pain that causes the rest to come running down the stairs behind Sam.
"I didn't know there was chocolate with the same name," Castiel pushes his chair back. "But this is only if you want one."
"And that right there is the wrong thing to say, don't go around telling that to everyone," Dean lets go of Tim's shoulder and reaches for the handle. "It might be better if you just don't talk," Dean says as he opens the front door and lets Tim walk in first.
Dean smiles at the angel's excitement. He slowly reaches for the door and takes the handle in his hand. "Dean," Castiel whines. "Stop being an ass or I'll rip that door off."
"Mmm," Dean watches in amusement as Sam immediately freezes. "I'll have a salad with a coffee," Sam says quickly. "Ranch will be fine."
Dean pulls the keys out of the ignition, slumping forward, resting his hands and head on the steering wheel. He and Sam had just gotten back from a hard case, they didn't get a chance to save the girls and the monsters had run before Dean had even gotten out of his restraints. The one girl that did make it to the hospital got killed by the monsters in the end.
"Vanessa? Baby, can I ask what you're doing?" After a minute or two Dean asks softly making Vanessa stop in her tracks.
"One of my dates did that," Vanessa mumbles as she plops herself next to Dean. "Pushed me into a pond and the water made me shift automatically."
He shrugs and walks over to the couch and says "couldn't sleep, probably will when the potion runs its course" they sit down on the couch, Vanessa grunts and starts scratching her legs.
Dean runs his hand down her sides, reaching her hips, he places a hand where her crotch would be. "This would be so much easier if you had legs," Dean chuckles.
As Vanessa slowly reads on, her eyelids become heavier and heavier until she nearly falls asleep. She sighs and closes the book, making a mental note of where she left off and places it back on her nightstand.
"Okay then, vamonos!" Vanessa unlocks the glass door and opens it, a cold gust of wind hits everyone, and Dean shivers. Vanessa is the first one out, skipping gleefully out the door. Sam is next, pretending that the cold isn't bothering him. And Castiel places a hand on Dean's shoulder and wraps a wing around his arm, forgetting that Dean can see it.
Dean sighs, his mind going blank. "I dont really know, start tomorrow or next fucking week," Dean grunts, then his attention gets pulled away when he hears something from the pool. He glances past the fire to the pool where Castiel is crouched down talking to Vanessa. Dean watches as she hoists herself onto the tile and rests only her stomach down is in the pool.
Vanessa holds her hands up "sorry jeez, " Vanessa turns to the last vampire, her face is drenched in tears, her knuckles bloody from fighting.
"Well, I'm going to give you my present, then I'll leave you to receive Cas'," Sam grabs everyone's plate and deposits them before going to grab Dean's gift.
Dean makes a quiet groan and turns the music up a hair and hums the melody to take his mind off of the backseat.
"What would that be?" Castiel asks after the sound of his wings flapping makes both Sam and Dean jump.
She continues to sing as she rakes her fingertips over his head, rubbing his temples as she goes. Vanessa's consistent humming lulls him into a peaceful sleep.
"Can I make a suggestion?" Vanessa asks, "how about you carve the hearts and souls of theses boys and I bring you some fresh dragons heart?" She says with a straight face.
Dean sighs and wanders to his room, not really sure what to do with himself. Dean saunters into his room, throwing himself onto his bed and toes his shoes and socks off, not caring that he is still in his jeans.
"It was all him, I only guarded the kitchen," Sam plops himself down at starts wolfing down his slice.
"A handful of smaller ones, but I mainly did galaxies and stars. I know Gabriel made a lot, he made most of the creatures that live in Australia," Castiel chuckles.
"Dibs on being the money bag," Dean snatches the little money bag and immediately gets zapped. "Ouch," he rubs his palm.
Dean looks back down at the book. The minute tick by slowly this time, after every paragraph Dean finishes, he quickly glances up to finds Tim's electric blue eyes still on him.
"I-I'm not really in the mood to have birthday sex, I'm sorry, I just wanted a kiss," she mumbles and looks away.
This is what he was doing this morning, he had gone for a quick run and shower before booting up his laptop and sitting at the kitchen's island and not noticing his brother in the doorway.
"You don't?" Vanessa asks, she runs a hand through her messy hair wondering if this is a good thing or a bad thing. She tries to remember anything that her instructors taught her about angels, most of it was about the war and if you ever meet one don't piss it off. Vanessa has made that mistake countless times, her hidden scars could back that up.
"It'll be done soon, I'm surprised you didn't pack up today and drive us to a diner," Sam says as he stirs Dean's can of beans.
Vanessa opens her mouth to object but Dean cuts her off. "And I don't know what I did or said to upset you, but I'm sorry." Dean visibly swallows."And I know you probably don't wanna talk about why it upset and I don't want to upset you even more by pushing you about it, but just know I am truly sorry."
Dean walks up the stairs as quiet as he can be, now realizing that he has never been up here and doesn't know where her room is. The window above the stairs illuminates the hallway, directly in front of the stairs is a giant ivy plant on an end table next to a door that is closed.
Sam nods and heads outside to grab clean clothes for him and Dean. Dean walks to the couch and sits down with a sigh. "
"I know what you're talking about, the name doesn't translate to English or any other language really, so people mainly call it the Atlantic war, " Vanessa explains as she picks up one of the books. She coos as she lightly runs a large nail over the cover of it. "Many sirens died in that war, it was horrific, my family lost my great-great-a-lot-of-greats-grandpa, he fought heroically, " Vanessa says, quickly blinking as if she was trying not to cry.
Cas stares at her, blush creeping onto his face. "Of cou-urse I will, I can stay out there with you for the whole night."
Vanessa walks over and takes a seat, praying that it won't collapse underneath her. She surveys the kitchen, the counter makes a 'U' shape with a fridge at one end and a sink in the middle of the 'U', and a stove next to the sink. A small window above the sink lets in enough light to illuminate the entire kitchen.
"Morning sleeping beauty, " a new voice says, "I got you your fish sandwich, as requested, with a Coke. I don't know what you really like so..." They trail off and take the seat next to her. She rubs her tired eyes and opens them, blinking to adjust to the light.
To Dean's surprise, Castiel squeezes his hand gently and Dean's gaze quickly flicks to the angel's mouth to find it in a small smile. Something inside Dean explodes, he's holding hands with Castiel, hopefully in a romantic way and not in the friends kind of way. Although, he hasn't heard of friends holding hands, but that's beside the point.
"Dean wanted to know my favorite movies and stuff," Vanessa yawns. "They are hunting the thing as we speak."
Once everything is done, Dean divides the food between three plates and pours everyone a steaming cup of tea. "Thanks, Dean," Vanessa says, she feels her face heating up as he sets it down in front of her.
"I gotta go, don't leave without me," Sam pats Dean's shoulder and turns towards the back of the diner.
"Where did you find these?" Sam asks before taking the last bite of his sandwich, pulling Castiel's attention back to the conversation.
They step into the cool building, a lot closer than Dean realized, their shoulders are brushing against each other as well as their hands. While Castiel seems to not be noticing, Dean can't help but mainly focus on that. Every part of him yearns to just grab his hand, but he chickens out when the angel excitedly says that "They have manatees!" and pulls him to the tank.
"You could've gone without me," Dean says as he closes the screen door behind him, Vanessa's eyes immediately scan Dean's exposed chest.
Dean rolls his eyes and crosses his arms. "Well when you're done freaking out, chew the beans then swallow them. And before you put your next scoop in your mouth gently blow on them."
"Sure...It's not that weird, is it?" Vanessa murmurs, sliding forward to rest her chin on the table.
"Is a kiss," Castiel grins, although Dean can't tell if it's mischievously or some other emotion he doesn't want to consider.
The smell of something sweet fills the air as he hears footsteps coming closer. "Close your eyes, Dean!" Sam calls out and Dean grudgingly does so.
"I love the sound of that," Vanessa purrs then hiccups, with Castiel holding her up, she takes her pants and underwear off. "Sweet Caroline! Bum, Bum, Bum!" She sings as Castiel leads her to the pool.
"You know, for a guy that went to law school, you sure do know a lot about animals," Dean smirks at his brother then walks off to find something to eat. Sam shrugs and quietly mutters "not really."
It's currently 6 o'clock almost 7 in the morning, the sun has almost fully risen and is peeking out from behind dark storm clouds. Dean would usually wait for it to be later in the day to drive, but he wants to make sure to get to his destination on time.
"Do you want to go and do that?" Cas asks and Vanessa blinks, forgetting that the pretty angel was even there.
Vanessa stands up and tiredly walks to and up the stairs, she flicks her wrist and the guest bedroom door starts repairing itself. She opens her bedroom door and walks towards her bed. Plans of rescuing Dean and how hot Cas is flows through her mind like a constant stream. She buries herself in the thick blankets and quickly falls asleep.
Dean shakes his head no. "Ah no, he left to get us lunch, he left late to be back by the time you woke up, but he'll be here soon."
"I don't think he likes you," Dean smirks and nudges Castiel with his shoulder. "It would be funny if he could see your big ass wings."
"Definitely, and we need to pick up some clothes for him, my sweat pants are too big for him," Sam mutters as they close the trunk.
The oldest witch raises her hand and all three of them start floating in the air, by at least a few inches, and slam into the wall. "I'm going to make it up to them, and all of the witches you've killed, Vanessa Goodwin" she grits between her teeth. She slowly walks up to Vanessa and holds the knife up to her heart. "Maybe I'll carve out your heart and soul and resurrect one of them, or use your blood for something useful" she growls.
He sighs, "yup you win Vanessa." Dean takes the shells from her, not noticing what's in her other hand.
"How did youânevermind" Dean mumbles, he takes a nice long sip of his beer and sighs, he slightly frowns as he notices that Vanessa is staring at him, but as soon as he catches her, she quickly looks away with a feeble hint of blush on her light tan cheeks.
I do have a Tumblr (don't know how to link it) just search blueberryrock and I'll come up, I post some art and I try to post my writing stuff there, so feel free to drop in and say hi!
"Right. Well, we'll be there soon" Sam says as he starts spending down the empty road. After thirtyish minutes, they turn left and silently drive down a dirt road, leading to a large plantation house. Two cars are parked outside and Sam parks right behind one of them.
"Bye," Vanessa says, once she hears the click, she turns her phone off and puts it in the back pocket of her jeans, she opens the front door and sits in the comfortable leather seat looking at the passenger seat to make sure she didn't forget her backpack, and she puts the keys into the ignition and turns the car on.
"Okay, umm, the guest bedroom all the way to the right is vacant," Vanessa replies rubbing her temples. They silently watch him leave the room and go up the stairs.
Dean caresses her cheek and presses a kiss on her lips, Vanessa sighs as Dean moves to hover over her. Dean breaks the kiss and leaves a trail of sloppy ones from her lips all the way down to her neck, going for the sweet spot. He licks just below her ear, drawing out her gills.
"Come in Dean," she sighs, her heart starts pounding as Dean opens the door and Vanessa takes a shaky breath in.
"Sounds good, if I can't, can you put me to sleep?" Dean asks, rubbing his cold arms. Castiel nods and watches as Dean walks inside, past the blazing fire and into the warm house. With all the lights off and all the closed curtains, Dean can still almost perfectly see in the dark, which is the only fun perk of almost becoming a vampire.
