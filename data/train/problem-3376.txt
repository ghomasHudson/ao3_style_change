The kitchen is empty. There’s beer, and lots of it, but no lingering friends or hunters or creatures or whatever the hell else decided to wander in to bother Dean. Taking a deep breath, he tries to eject whatever’s in his head. He’s never done this before- Michael left of his own volition last time (extenuating circumstances notwithstanding) and carrying Benny out of Purgatory had been a physical ordeal. This was all mental- and Dean hated his mind.
“I didn’t summon a God,” she corrects. “I asked a different hunter to talk to some Skogkatts and they told me.” Donna leans over, dipping the brush in more “paint.” She also glances at Dean who looked puzzled. “Skogkatts! They’re a big, fluffy kinda’ cat. Frejya’s got two herself. We got quite a few up in the cabins. Nice fellows, those cats.”
“I don’t really like to talk about it. Still hurts, after all these years. And for so long, I wondered how he could do it. My father was a lot of things, but suicidal ain’t one of them.” Jack hums something of agreement. Cas was a lot of things, but suicidal wasn’t one of them. “What really sucked was that he didn’t tell us anything. He told me to take care of my family, and then left.” Dean’s hand reaches over to Jack’s shoulder. Even under a few layers, he can feel the kid’s stress. Their shoulders are hunched and tight, but they lean into the touch.
Thankfully, the paint dries in time for Dean to pull his pants back on before Claire arrives. She hangs around the door, arms crossed in a pout that screams teenage angst. As rough as she looks, Dean could only smile when he sees her.
This isn’t their first kiss, but it feels like one. It’s hesitant and shaky, but hungry all the same. He knows what Castiel tastes like, but it’s still thrilling. Cas must feel the same way, moaning into Dean’s mouth, his other hand sliding up Dean’s shirt. It’s warm and soft and when it presses Dean against the wall he only wants more. Cas has the same idea, moving his warm fingers and clumsily trying to unbutton Dean’s shirt. The feeling stays, that rush of relief and warmth and connectedness enveloping them as Dean’s hand moves off Castiel’s hip and up his back. His skin is soft, but he can feel muscles moving underneath, powerful and determined to undress him. Dean moans a little, as Cas bites his lower lip.
Not right now. They lay together, just breathing. The scar on Castiel’s hip burns, and the bite on Dean’s hip throbs. It’s a strange symmetry, forged through pain the same way metal is forged in fire.
And that was another thing. Sam never heard the end of it when he was addicted to drinking blood, but Dean actively defends when Benny does it. He robs blood banks. At least Sam took it from consenting demons, or demons who deserved to be drained, but Benny? He makes Dean recant everything he knew, without a moment’s hesitation. There was something else, too. Dean and Cas hadn’t been the same after Cas cracked purgatory open, but they still loved each other. That stank ass trenchcoat festered in the Impala’s trunk for what Sam feared could be forever, until Cas inevitably returned. They still had feelings for each other, if Sam’s long, drunk text messages from both meant anything. But Dean loved Benny, and didn’t seem to care when Castiel aired his (and Sam’s) valid concerns.
He comes back every time. Sam and Jack try to hide it, but Dean notices they were worried. The next day he attempts to make it up to them, watching a movie with Sam or taking Jack for a drive. And if he really tries, Dean can pretend he doesn’t feel dead.
“Why?” isn’t the first question that crosses Dean’s mind, but it is the first one he allows himself to ask. Sam shakes his head, finally meeting Dean’s gaze.
“I can’t. I’ve never been able to tell him.” Dean refutes, waving his hands uselessly. He continues to vent, feeling safe in the solitude of the metal bunker. “We’ve been together for so long, now. Over ten years, but I couldn’t tell him. Even when I lost him, I couldn’t say it. Not in purgatory, not in heaven, never. I wanted to, but last time-” Dean pauses. The memories are too much. Last time he let himself love someone else completely, it was a disaster. Lisa and Ben, who’d done absolutely nothing but love him back, were kidnapped, tortured, possessed, almost killed, because of him. He can’t let that happen again. Especially not to Castiel, who’d already been abused and beaten because of his devotion to Sam and Dean. He won’t put Cas through any more pain. He refuses. “But love sucks.”
“Dean.” Billie’s voice is cold and clear, washing over him the same way beer does when Sam throws an open can to his brother. “We need to talk,” she says, pointedly resting her scythe against the bar. He doesn’t want to look at it, but it’s too big. The blade is sharp and almost gleams in the unnatural roadhouse light. Dean sighs. He knew this was coming, but it still hurt. He has to pick someone to sacrifice to the Empty.
Sam’s no stranger to nightmares. It sucks, but that’s just the honest truth. When you grow up with the horrifying knowledge that monsters are real, your dad and older brother are leaving you every week to hunt them, and your only escape is through one of the most elite universities in the country, nightmares are the least of your problems. Stress permeates his life so thoroughly that Sam’s not sure he knows how to relax anymore.
“No!” Dean shouts it before the words finish processing in his mind. He’s already lost Cas, he can’t lose Jack. “No,” Dean clears his throat, voice back to a normal volume. Jack’s eyes are looking up at Dean, and he tilts his head and damn it that’s *just* how Cas does it-
Blood soaks through the clothes. Lifting Dean’s shirt, Castiel sees black veins and teeth marks along his side, stretching from hip to ribs. A Leviathan Bite. It’s bleeding and aching, but the burning in his shoulder is different. And on the wrong side. Confused, Castiel rolls Dean’s shirt back down, and checks his left shoulder. The handprint is inflamed, red skin almost glowing with pain. He hopes Dean can’t feel this. Castiel’s in two places at once. Physically, he’s sitting in Dean’s body, in the bunker’s dungeon. Spiritually, he’s driving the impala down a long, winding road as it rains in Dean’s mind, the hunter peacefully asleep in the passenger seat.
“You’ll ‘let me out’? You don’t even know how to move in here. I found you, Winchester. And I can leave you alone again, too.” Dean raises an eyebrow.
Patience follows soon after, when Dean has maybe four sigils on his arm. At this rate, it’ll take all morning to prepare the ritual, and by then the spell will be less potent. She only stands in the doorway (Kaia must’ve left it open) and waits.
“I want you to be there, Dean,” Cas continues, voice low and earnest and god Dean can’t think straight when he sounds like that. “I meant what I said, I’m happiest with you.” Dean’s not sure if Castiel knows what his words are doing. They’re exactly what he wants to hear, but they’re sweet poison. Dean only wants to be with Cas, but he can’t. He’s wanted it for so long,  but the world always finds a reason to separate them. The simple truth is that the longer Cas is by his side, the more peril he’s in. Dean knows what he is- a danger, a dick, a brother, a hunter, but above all else he’s a weapon. Loathing and rage and disgust and all the other destructive things on Earth forced into one well-trained serial killer.
“They’re not dead yet,” Cain acknowledges. “But neither are you. When you see Adam again, tell him I’ll be waiting.” And with that, Cain stood up. The roadhouse door swings open, and Billie walks in, the lights dimming around her. The scythe flies to her open hand. Cain stands up, and walks forward.
“I promise.” Dean’s voice was deeper than he meant for it to be. “C’mon,” he smirked. “The geeks are gonna wonder where we are if we keep ‘em waiting any longer.”
“I just became God. Let’s keep the world going for a little longer, hm?” Amara smiles. Billie snaps her fingers, hits the ground with her scythe, and the two are gone. The world unfreezes, and Dean gasps. Castiel touches his side, but Dean assures him it’s not the pain. Instead, he motions to the room again and…. It’s fuller than it used to be.
At least Sam was there for the main four. He could keep an eye on Dean, make sure his apparently monster catnip brother didn’t get in too deep with the nonhumans he insisted on fucking. And he knows that Dean isn’t great at commitment. He and Castiel are apparently fine with it, as they’ve both had partners outside of each other. Sam doesn’t understand, but he’ll always be supportive.
“She doesn’t get a say,” Dean responds, anger swelling in his chest. The bitch who waltzed into their lives and abused Cas as his most vulnerable and tortured Sam in his least protected moment does not get to weigh in with her opinion on what’s worth getting their family back together. There’s still some blood drying along Sam’s hairline and the mere sight of it fills Dean with more and more rage. He takes a shaky breath, letting Castiel’s grace wash over him internally and remembering this isn’t his own feeling. Anger has always been Dean’s problem, but the intense loathing that overwhelms him at Naomi’s name is from Castiel.
“Uh, I’m not- don’t-” Dean tries to protest, but Max pushes in. He grabbes the brush Eileen left and exhales.
“Took you long enough. I gotta talk to the serious angel. Where is he?” Sam’s heart quickens, a thousand thoughts running through his mind. Gabriel doesn’t know about Cas. Does he know about Chuck? About Jack? About Apocalypseworld Michael? Where’s he been? Is this another trick?
“A little short for an archangel, arent’cha?” Gabriel frowns at the comment, but Donna continues. “You’re the one who shook the Prophet Mohammed? In that weak little body? I’m supposed to believe you’re the one who killed Baldur?” Donna lowers her gun. “You couldn’t even get into tha bunker without pretendin’ to be a neutered dog.” The archangel’s face darkens, and he strides towards Donna.
“Where are we?” Dean asks, trying to bring himself back to the present. This was too happy to be a dream, but too immaterial to be a djinn vision. He can’t think what else it could be. The mere effort makes his head throb in protest, and radio static fuzzed the song that plays. Cas jumps, pulling the car off to the side of the road. He’s quiet, looking Dean up and down with those big, blue, doe eyes.
“So, miss ‘love sucks.’ What made you want to get married again?” The question is personal, maybe a little invasive, and certainly tactless. Of course, those words also describe Dean. Donna stops painting, the brush skidding to a halt along his ribs.
It wasn’t like last time. Last time they lost Cas, Dean let it hurt him. The pain was too immense to hold back, and the anger consumed him just as flames consumed Cas’ vessel. But he went too far. In all his grief, he’d abused Jack in a way Dean promised he’d never do. He let Sam down, and hunted ruthlessly. He’d acted just like his dad. So when they got Castiel back, a one in a million chance, Dean promised he’d be better. He started to feel things beyond anger, telling Jack how proud he was and supporting Sam more and more. Anchoring his mental health to Castiel wasn’t a great idea in hindsight, but it was the only thing that got him through both times Michael violated him. Even when Cas left, hunting on his own, Dean was alright. He was still tethered to his angel, even if the distance was a strain.
“Yeah. It’s about Castiel. Where is he?” Jody asks, concern bleeding from her voice. Dean swallows hard, not ready to say it outloud. He came to terms with his best friend’s death a long time ago, but it still hurts. For some stupid reason, it only throbbed worse after they’d defeated Chuck. Dean had never missed him more than right now, when the war was over and he barely went hunting anymore.
Alone again. Dean looks down at his arms, covered in sigils he’s sure he’s seen before, and tries to forget when they first came up with this idea.
“No, that’s not right,” he observes, drinking in Amara’s defensive form. She’s hiding something. Cas had been hiding his deal with the Empty for years. Dean’s not sure he could survive losing Amara, too.
“I’m right here,” Dean says, stupidly. He was standing right in front of Anna. “And how do you know I knew Anna?” he continues, suspicious. He doesn’t expect the Empty to be completely honest, since nearly every extraplanar cosmic entity he’s met manipulated him, but the Empty’s lies are worse than Sam’s.
“Can you get Claire and Kaia?” she asks, shaking out her hands. Her eyes dart around nervously, and she barely raises her voice above a whisper. “And wish me luck?” Dean nods, not even trying to hide the smile on his face.
Dean was silent for the entire drive home, and continued not speaking to Sam when they ate dinner with Bobby. And the next day he kept it up, only talking to Sam about a possible case. Sam knew he fucked up, and tried to make it better. It’s hard to get past Dean’s walls, but Sammy Winchester excelled at it. He drove to the Roadhouse, and valiantly put up with how Ash mercilessly flirted with Dean, determined to finish what Sam had interrupted.
They turn the corner. Dean had only been gone for five minutes, at the very most, and yet things were already out of hand.
Sam is 0 for 3 in terms of being a supportive brother. He promises himself he’ll at least try to get along with the next guy Dean brings home. And he did try. For three seconds.
“I don’t believe you,” Amara decides. The words come slow, as if the spirit behind them is too broken to speak. Dean nods and closes his eyes. He’d lied to her before, why should she believe him now? Even if she knew he’s telling the truth, she’s right to distance herself from him. Cas had finally gotten closer, deciding to stay with the Winchesters, but now he’s rotting in the Empty. Eyes still closed, Dean feels Amara begin to leave. He ignores how the Mark still stings. She walks away, not using her power to teleport somewhere.
Dean gets to his feet, angel blade in hand. His eyes flare with a pale, green fire that Sam fears. Last time he saw it, Dean killed the entire Styne Family, fueled by nothing but primordial, cosmic rage. It burns in him now, and he doesn’t waste a second. Naomi doesn’t have time to think. He’s already lunged, nicking her arm. Light bleeds from the spot. Naomi grimaces. Dean doesn’t care. He swings again, but Naomi barely dodges. Sam knows his brother’s a talented fighter but he’s scared Naomi’s better. She’s eons older, and more trained. She doesn’t have a stab wound in her shoulder. She didn’t just spend half an hour in the Empty.
“No,” he responds. It’s the same stubborn voice Claire used. Dean tries to think of a comeback (thinking is harder now that there are multiple entities in his body, their thoughts and memories all folded into his), but it’s interrupted. Distantly, something roars. Cas stiffens, his coat rustling slightly. They both recognize the sound.
“How are you not dead?” Jack asks. They’ve only talked with Gabriel a few times. The archangel’s expression softens around the kid.
Sam Winchester is not homophobic. Or biphobic, or transphobic, or any of those other words he learned at college. He’s not. Honestly. He supports all people in their journey to find love, no matter who they find that in.
It’s hard to remember Sam is Dean’s younger brother sometimes, with the way he leads others so confidently and looms a full head taller than most people. But as younger brothers always do, he finds the perfect time to interrupt and seizes it.
“There’s a lot of things I want,” he begins, lazily. “But we gotta talk.” His voice turns sour. “You’re gonna send someone back.” Dean opens his mouth to protest, but Cain raises one hand. “It’s going to be me.”
“I’m worried for you, kid. I’ve been where you are, and look at me now.” Max stops painting, sneer softening into a glare. There’s nothing more annoying than being lectured about family. However, it’s only annoying because Dean’s right. He’s a mess. He’s been attacked, killed, tortured, possessed, kidnapped, transformed, and unmade so many times that he lost count years ago. Max has heard enough stories about the Winchesters. The only reason they have stories worth telling is because they’re dangerously needy, and willing to sacrifice the world to save each other. Not exactly role model material.
Because the next guy Dean brought home was Crowley, King of the Crossroads, Ruler of Hell, Professional Demon, and all around bastard. Castiel seemed equally annoyed by Crowley’s incessant flirting, but Dean brushed them off. His relationship with the demon was strange. The more the mark ate at his soul, corrupting him, the more time they spent alone together. And then there was that summer where Dean had transformed into a demon himself. Crowley loved nothing more than to share all the perverse, explicit, sexual and homicidal things they did together, in vivid detail. At least Benny kept his mouth shut around Sam.
“Ok.” Sam tightens his lips, clearing thinking about saying something, but decides against it. He claps a hand on Dean’s shoulder, tells him they’re ready for the spell when he is, and then leaves.
The very next day, Sam came up with the idea to summon the Empty. Rowena told him the only way to build a convincingly dead celestial was to put it in someone who’d been touched by a celestial. Dean wouldn’t let any of his family take on the burden, reading Rowena’s posture. This was going to be dangerous. He wouldn’t let anyone else risk it.
“Tough luck, he’s out right now,” Donna doesn’t miss a beat, keeping up with Gabriel’s sly attempts to worm out of every question he’s asked. “What do you need him for?”
Again, no time to think about that now. Sam’s taking a personal break (recommended by Eileen and Kevin). Years ago, he’d taken a special interest in labor laws. Now, he’s considering making a union for himself, just to guarantee at least fifteen minutes for a nap. The thought is pleasantly boring, lulling him to sleep until Donna stomps around the corner. She’s dragging Gabriel along, with Dean following a few seconds behind. Break’s over.
“I don’t know how.” Yes you do, Billie responds, her voice reverberating around Dean’s mind. It’s quieter than otherworld Michael, but just as forceful.
“Let me heal you,” he mutters, closing his eyes. Sam tries to object, but the refreshing feeling of angelic grace washes over him before he gets very far. He’s placed a name to the look now.
“Don’t ignore me, Sam. I’m older than you, and I’ve seen a lot more shit than a legacy hunter. You don’t know what lurks behind the Empty. At our full power, with all four archangels fighting on our side, Heaven struggled to keep the horrors at bay. Plagues that disfigure one’s very soul, until their bodies experience nuclear meltdown on the atomic level. Gods that play with time and life as if they’re sand castles, made to be destroyed. Interdimensional monsters that sustain themselves on skin and skin alone, flaying alive whole cities in hours just to sate their hunger. Dragons with fire so hot your people named it a Pyroclastic Flow. Giants that shatter continents with their very footsteps. By opening that door to the Empty you are letting that all come in and worse. Swarms of microscopic bugs that gnaw down to the bone. Elementals that would rather remake the Earth than coexist on it. Air that feels like shards of glass and would tear your lungs apart if you breathed it in. Immortal, invulnerable, merciless creatures your human mind can’t even comprehend.
“Need any help?” she asks, picking up the brush. Dean nods and points to his back, handing over the sheet of sigils Rowena made. “Well, I’m no art student,” she mutters, squinting at the sheet, “but I think I can do this.” Dean laughs.
“I don’t think I want to hunt,” Dean sighs. “I mean, I do. I can’t stop- it’s all I’ve ever known. But, I’m so tired, Cas. I don’t want to die like this.” He adds all those qualifiers quickly, as if he’s afraid John will come through the door at any moment and berate him for neglecting his duty towards Sam. But that confrontation never happens. Instead, Cas squeezes Dean’s hand. He allows himself to think about a future outside of hunting, remembering all the human pleasures he experienced all those years ago. He wants to feel them again, with Dean and Jack and Sam by his side. He wants to grow old and watch bees and brush his teeth and get drunk and all the normal, annoying things humans do.
“You’re up early,” Dean grunts, hating how bright the lights are. Jack, somehow an optimist, doesn’t seem to mind, but Sam looks awful. His eyes are still adjusting to the harsh light, hair messily falling in his face. There’re dark bags etched into his skin, and he seems off. It catches Dean’s attention instantly. Finally, something to focus on, maybe plaster over the hole in his heart that yearns for Cas. “You look like shit,” he prompts, narrowing his eyes at Sam. Sam only nods, resting his head in his hands. He’s clearly tired.
“It’s been a few months,” Dean admits. He’s never been to Sunday School, and Sammy was better at research anyways.
Oh well. Sorry. I got a 15 chapter plan but that's likely to change. Sorry about posting two mini stories that aren't PS. I got a lotta spn fics in my head, and i wanted to write those two before i lost the idea. So, yeah. This won't be the last spn fic i post. But my brain is focused on this! And my academic papers!
“Meaning?” Donna snaps. Gabe glowers at her, but he’s not stupid. He reads the room, eyes barely glancing over the others, recognising the different reactions they all had to mentioning Castiel. They settle on Sam, chest puffed out and larger than life, projecting strength while Dean wilts behind him. Something flashes behind his brown eyes, a moment of softness overcoming his arrogant aurora before being buried again. He looks back to Donna and smiles.
Dean couldn’t be doing worse. He puts up a convincing front and Sam’s sure Jack hasn’t noticed how hard his other dad is taking Cas’ death. But Sam knows his brother too well. Grief is eating Dean alive and he’s content to let it happen. Sam wants to do something, force Dean to talk or hunt or anything, but he also knows that Dean gets violent when confronted, and that’s the last thing Jack needs. So Sam continues his balancing act, shielding their kid from Dean’s potential breaking point while also poking the bear when no one else can see.
“I pray to thee, Castiel, angel of Thursday,” Dean starts, letting out a shaky breath. “The one who pulled me and Sammy outta hell, who rebelled against God, who gave his life for Jack.” He’s on a roll now, taking full advantage of his solitude. “The one who stopped me from killing myself, the one who looked out for Sam, the one who’s always been there even when we- *I*- couldn’t do the same.” He swallows thickly. “I know I never said it, but damn it Cas, I love you. I love you back and I’ll always love you, you stupid bastard.”
He doesn’t remember anything. He wanders. Maybe for a minute, maybe for a year, he wanders around, making noise, calling for others, being as loud as possible. Cas described his own grand escape as “annoying” the Empty into letting him out. If there’s something Dean “chronic older brother syndrome” Winchester could do, it’s annoy people.
He makes do. Chuck’s been defeated for about a week now, and Jack is almost fully recovered. They spend the mornings talking to Sam, excitedly babbling about how far their powers are coming along. Sam listens. He knows what it’s like to hate your supernatural abilities (and worse: fear them) so he tries to encourage Jack in positive ways. Castiel’s gone, and the Winchesters all have to move forward. They’re taking it hard, but in different ways. Jack throws themself into daily routines, learning and training like any other student. They’re only four years old. Sam tries to take homeschooling slowly, but Jack’s smart. A gleaming intelligence and optimism shines in their blue eyes. They’re coping.
Suddenly, the bunker alarms go off. The room is bathed in red, as lights and sirens blare. Dean rolls onto his side, screaming in pain. Rowena nearly falls over as the ground shakes. Gabriel catches her. Jody’s covers the door, gun ready. Donna’s by her side, checking the hallway for assailants. Both women shoot Sam a look. Something’s wrong.
“You were out, dude,” Sam fires back. Thinking about Dean seems to ease his fear, if only slightly. He smiles but it can’t reach his eyes. “I tried, but you were practically dead. It’s been a day, Dean.” Dean recoils in his seat, taking it all in. He always woke up when Sam was in the room. Secretly, he takes pride in that- it’s one of the first survival skills he’d taught himself. But if he did sleep for an entire day, that would explain how hungry he was. And why the door was open- Sam would’ve checked on him from time to time.
“Let’s go,” Dean whispers, taking her hands in his. He leads her around the metal hallways, picking up the amulet Eileen left him. The group gathered in the dungeon, patiently making small talk as they waited. It all dies as Dean and Amara enter.
He was happy for Dean and Castiel. They seemed happy together, exchanging long, soulful looks that pleaded for the other to stay. They had a good thing going.
“You’re not my type,” she excuses. He better not be, Dean retorts, disgusted with their age difference and thinking about how angry Claire would be. Kaia sits on Dean’s bed, shifting her feet idly. “Where you’re going… it’s not good. I couldn’t see much, but what I saw was scary.” She shudders at the memory. As cool as dreamwalking could be, Kaia’s apparently cursed to only dreamwalk to nightmarish otherworlds.
“I’ve been there before. I’m strong” Jack protests. They huff a little, pouting with those baby cheeks. Dean opens his eyes closed. Jack’s not wrong: they are strong. Stronger than any other Winchester, stronger than any other angel, stronger than any other celestial being. Stronger than any child should have to be.
“You don’t have to live like that anymore,” Dean pleads. “We’re done now. You can have a life again.”
Sam rolls his eyes and pity laughs as Gabe saunters away, directly towards Rowena. Looking around, the rest of the group appears to be pacified. He’s not even aware of it, but Sam’s already wandered closer to Eileen. She greets him brightly. The night’s not the best of his “measly little life”, but it’s pretty good.
“We should be alone,” she resolves. Sam’s never heard the woman, but he knows the tone- condescending. The woman strides forward. With a quick movement, she snaps her fingers and Eileen and Donna fall to the floor. Sam’s grip on the gun tightens.
There’s no flash of light, like when an angel appears. No sound either, which usually accompanies a reaper or demon. Not even the pain of letting Benny out. It’s so straightforward Dean’s instantly suspicious. Four people are now standing in front of him. Four people who, as of a literal second ago, were not on this plane of existence. But here they are, looking like they hadn’t even died. Dean breathes out, his head no longer throbbing. They weren’t as bad as Michael, but he doesn’t miss the pounding headache. For a moment, no one moves. It’s awkward- a hunter, a reaper, a vampire, a demon, and an angel all in the same room. And then something thuds. Five pairs of eyes turn in unison to see Jack in the doorway, an ice pack laying at their feet. They run into the room, wrapping Castiel in a hug before Dean can react. Crowley and Benny step aside, politely giving the reunited family some room. Billie smiles gently, and things seem better for a moment. Looking around, Dean can pretend the past month didn’t happen.
“Why’d I grip you tight and raise you from perdition?” he asks, a smile playing at his lips. Castiel’s face falls. Dean grabs and squeezes his hand. “Because I had to. You deserve to be here, Cas. In the world, with Jack and Sam and Claire. You should be happy.” Cas looks at him and Dean wonders if he’ll ever not shrink away from that stare.
“Wanna watch a movie?” he offers, knowing the answer before Dean even says it. And he knows exactly what to play. Porky’s Two.
“W- woah, Cas. Maybe we should go to a different room-” Dean tries to interrupt,  but Cas shushes him, letting his shirt fall to the floor and turning. His back is tight, skin pulled taunt over muscle that just barely fits under a white button up that’s by his feet. A few freckles dot his back like stars dot the sky, but that’s not what catches his attention. On his hip is…
“Who are you,” he barks, nudging Eileen with his foot. Worryingly, she doesn’t respond. “And why are you here.” It’s a demand, not a question. If the woman is surprised or intimidated by his shouting, she doesn’t show it, instead casting a glance at the gun.
“Think bigger, Samuel. Michael- not ours- that other world’s. The one who allied with monsters and made them stronger. The one who possessed your brother for months, torturing him worse than Hell ever could. Cain, who tried to commit genocide before you finally killed him. He’s the Father of Murder- don’t let him back into the world.” She’s attacking his family now. Another mistake. Again, they’ve dealt with those monsters before, and they’ll deal with them again.
John was wrong. Dean wished a broken wrist was all the world did against queers. But when he remembers Castiel’s face, serene and beautiful, crying as he finally broke that unspoken promise and whispered “I love you,” it’s not Dean’s wrist that ached.
“Anyways, it’s handled now,” Dean says, before finishing off his beer. Silence hangs in the air, telling Sam all he needs to know. Lee was a friend, a hunter, a good person, and he’s dead now. Dean looked him in the eyes as he killed him, a pain Sam’s all too familiar with.
Ignoring the dog’s pleas, Dean shuffles towards the fridge and grabs a beer. It’s the only thing he could stomach. His body aches in a familiar way, the ghost of a hundred hungry, haunting nights heavy on his bones, but he feels too sick to eat. Dean’s not even sure he could keep the beer down, as refreshing as it would be. At least if he throws that up, there’d be an excuse. Dean knows the hazards of drinking too much, yet he flirts with alcoholism anyways, determined to die hunting before his liver can get the better of him.
Dean can’t sleep that night. He certainly tries, but his traitorous body is too restless and jittery. After decades of fighting monsters and hunting, seeing one man makes him *jittery*. Pathetic. Around six in the morning, he gives up on the hope of sleeping, and starts to wander the bunker. The ritual will happen in the dungeon, where Cas was last on Earth. As long as he avoids that room, Dean’ll be fine. He lingers in the kitchen, feeding Miracle some cold, next-day pizza and collecting his thoughts over coffee. Aimlessly he peruses the library shelves, finding a truly astonishing amount of research on subjects no one cares about. Shameful as it is, when others start waking up, Dean evades them, pacing in unused storage rooms. Eventually he makes his debut, lying about his insomniac activities with a big, fake smile.
It’ll be better this time. Dean promised, eight years ago, before killing his best friend. It’ll be better this time. He remembers swinging the machete and damning Benny back to Purgatory and all the hell that came with it. It’ll be better this time. Sadly, Benny shakes his head and Dean leans in, pressing their foreheads together. Benny’s hand is at the beck of his neck, meaty and heavy and it’s so familiar Dean almost forgets how long he missed it. The feeling grounds him, and he knows Benny’s listening to his heart beat right now. Stabilizing moments. They didn’t have a name for it- still don’t- but the only way they made it through Purgatory without going insane was by being with each other, grounding and stabilizing the other when things got too much. It hasn’t even been a minute but the world is overwhelming Benny.
“I love you,” Cas breathes into his chest and it doesn’t sound like a goodbye. It’s a promise. Dean nods, feeling Castiel’s hand on his shoulder.
Max Banes isn’t as proficient as his sister when it comes to spellwork, but he’s good enough to teach Sam.
“Naomi?” Gabriel’s voice is impoloring, as if he was nervous about her reaction to him. Sam looks away from her wings just long enough to see Gabe, who’s slunk into the room. His face is excited, as if seeing an old friend. Remembering all of Castiel’s horror stories, Sam doubts someone as facetious as Gabriel could be friends with someone like Naomi. The woman nods.
“There is no map for the void. Besides, you’ve got everything you need. Right here,” he points to Dean’s arm, where a few sigils crowd around the hand shaped scar covering his shoulder. Dean pauses, confused. “You’re looking for Castiel in there. All you need is that little handy (ha!) soul branding to find him.”
“Dean Winchester.” A familiar voice cooes. Dean follows the sound until he sees who made it. “And here I was thinking I’d never see you in the Empty.”
And it’s that kind of supportive attitude that has him choking on coffee one bright, slow Thursday when Garth mentions he, his wife, and Dean all had a three way. Valiantly, he struggles past the caffeine assaulting his windpipe and takes a staggering breath, unsure what to do with this. He didn’t think Dean had a type, but sleeping with Garth felt like a step too far. This had to be a joke, the beginnings of a prank war that would end with bloodshed. But Dean joins Garth and Sam at the diner table, favoring his right leg, winks at Garth, and then starts discussing the possible tulpa one town over as if nothing happened. Choosing the path of least resistance, Sam says nothing, but opts to spend the night in the Impala, pretending he doesn’t see Garth’s wife slap Dean’s ass.
“Thought I’d use a familiar face,” she retorts, black ooze dripping from her eye. “Who are you?” She repeats, this time less of a question. Dean doesn’t respond, too busy trying to figure out what Anna means. Something in his brain reminds him that the Empty would take on different shapes to speak. That’s one of Billie’s thoughts.
“Ok loverboy. I got a plan,” Gabe retorts. The grin on his face isn’t wicked, per se, but it’s conniving. Sam’s sure he’s not going to like the plan. “You soften up Thumbelina, I got Ro, and tonight we both get lucky.” He swings an arm over Sam’s shoulders and leans in. “If we play our cards right this will be the best night of your measly little life.”
The sun’s risen when Cas uses his voice again. He seems apologetic, and Dean instantly knows why. His shoulder aches as if it’s been stabbed.
“Ok, what are you doing here? Now, of all times?” Sam asks, resisting the urge to put his face in his hands. Dean’s a better interrogator, but Sam knows the basics. Don’t show the perp their antics are working on you, even if they are.
“And Dean.” Not responding isn’t getting Sam anywhere. Two can play at Naomi’s game. Castiel hadn’t fought back early enough, and by the time he started it was too late. Sam won’t make the same mistake. “You’re asking me to leave the two people best equipped to handle this kind of apocalypse in the one place where they can’t help?”
“What’s it to you?” Max sneers. Somewhere deep, Dean laughs. He'd have done the same thing. Hell, he still does the same thing. There’s no price too high for saving family. Of course, that philosophy gets everyone around him killed. Max is young, but the distant look in his eyes betrays something else. He knows the rules about life and death, the high toll hunting demands, and yet he wakes up every morning and kept moving.
“Somewhere.” And with that, she disappears. His arm cools down, and Dean finally breaths out. He refuses to open his eyes, knowing tears are on their way. They’d won. This is what victory looks like. This is what it feels like. Lonely. Hooray.
“I can feel Her,” Anna respondes. In the back of his mind, Dean thinks about Billie, who disappeared after talking to him. “She’s with you, now. I can see where you two are merged. She,” Anna gestures to herself, “Is there, too.” Dean looks down at his hand, where black veins stared back. “So,” Anna said, angry this time. “What. Are. You.”
Nothing happens. Billie chastises him, telling Dean the spell he needs to recite to actually push them out. He hesitates, unsure of what the words mean. Cas assures him they’re fine, but Dean’s still nervous. This wouldn’t be the first time he’d been played. Hell, that was consistent part of his life. It’s easier to count those who didn’t betray him than those who did. But Cas is whispering something soothing in his ears and Dean mutters the spell, stupidly hoping if he says it quiet enough it’ll take the bite out of whatever evil thing he summons.
“You’re just crazy enough to make it work,” Benny huffs. When they part, the world seems a little brighter.
“It’s not fair,” Jack finally admits, resting against Dean. The hunter laces his hands through the kid’s hair, marveling at how soft it is. After all the shit they’ve been through, it’s hard to remember that Jack is just a kid, still somehow soft and optimistic. Dean wants to protect that, protect them, so badly. It’s a weight in his chest he’s all too familiar with: he’s felt it for Sam his whole life.
Unfortunately, doing anything today means ruining the peace that’s fallen over his room. He doesn’t want to interrupt Rowena, leave Gabriel, or wake Eileen. He doesn’t want to get up and deal with all the problems having a group of hunters and a group of witches in one room entails. He doesn’t want to get up and face the fact that Castiel is gone.
“My dream last night. I didn’t- Um, I didn’t *see* Castiel, but I felt him. I thought I was drowning at first,” she laughed, failing to ease the tension in the room. “But it was him. He knows something’s after him. It’s killing others and it’s gonna get him too and-” Claire’s voice broke. Dean was already hugging her, stiffening when Claire pressed her whole body into his. “I know what we have to do,” she sobbed, unable to stop the tears anymore. “But it means losing someone.”
“Guess I came at just the right time, then!” A chill crawls down Dean’s spine. He and Donna draw their guns, looking around the hallway. They’re alone, save for Miracle.
He feels her before he sees her. It’s a lurch in his very soul, a feeling of allconsuming want that nearly knocks him over without a push. She’s in the doorway, a few feet away and Dean knows it’s too far. He wants nothing more than to get closer, but stays put.
“I know.” God, does he know. God? A small part of him wonders if Jack hears that, since they absorbed Chuck’s power. Or maybe Amra hears it- Dean doesn’t know if anything changed since the split with Jack. There are too many questions and too much guilt and confusion and anger swirling around in his head. He wishes Cas were here. Dean squeezes his eyes shut, pushing that thought out of his mind. Cas is in the Empty, whatever the hell that meant. There’s no way they’d be lucky twice and get him back. Especially not since Jack’s still dazed, lying on the ground as Sam still fumbles to comfort the kid, and Amara’s still staring at Dean like he’s roadkill. He feels like roadkill. He’d felt like roadkill since Cas left. “I’m sorry.”
The last thing Castiel said was “I love you.” It made no sense. Of course Cas loved him. He loved Cas right back. He wished they had more time. But as soon as he’d said it, Cas was gone, taken by that stupid ooze into god knows where. He saved Dean’s life. For the next few hours after that, Dean cried, alone in the dungeon. Cas sacrificed himself and for what. The walls were cold and the room was dark. Wherever Cas was, it would be colder and darker. Dean didn’t want to think about it, but how could he not? Cas said the one thing he wants is something he knows he can’t have. Did he not know that he had Dean, forever and always? That even at their lowest, Dean would move heaven and earth to find him? To keep him safe? Doesn’t matter now. Cas is gone.
“I’m sorry,” Dean blurts out. It’s all he can think of. “We’ll find a way to fix you. I promise.” Kevin shakes his head.
“You lied to me,” Amara repeats in a hushed voice. This argument isn’t something the others need to hear. It’s just between her and the man her essence is accidentally tied to. Idly, Dean itches the scar on his arm, trying to relieve the burning sensation. He nods, unable to look her in the eyes.
“I don’t care. You are not going to the Empty and that is final.” Dean’s voice is firm and commanding. He has to stop himself before saying “that’s an order.” He has to stop himself before he becomes his dad. Miracle whines again, sensing the tension. She presses her cold, wet nose against Dean’s hand, sniffing the sigils before laying her head down on Jack. The kid looks away from Dean, instead focusing on the dog. Dean knows the move all too well. Sam used to do it, eyes full of hurt and anger, when he couldn’t hunt with John and Dean. He decides he doesn’t care. It’s safer this way, just like it was safer then. Of course, he doesn’t tell this to Jack, instead just letting the kid lean on him and pet Miracle.
Rowena and Crowley are clearly arguing, with Jody in the middle trying to mediate. Benny’s talking to the Banes Twins, showing them something with his teeth and Donna’s neck. Claire’s threatening Benny at machete point while Jack tries to talk her down. Kevin and Gabriel are on the floor next to Naomi’s body, either blissfully unaware or desperately ignoring the chaos around them. Eileen, Sam, and Alex are trying to put out a purple fire, while Garth feeds it with something black and powdery. Patience and Kaia are nowhere to be found.
“Don’t get too excited, there’s still things to do here!” Dean calls after her. She doesn’t respond, and Dean’s smile fades. He’s alone again; no one’s in the room. That hollow feeling he’s tried to beat back swells again. It’s stronger now, consuming him. Dean looks at his body, covered in sigils he can’t read, a good amount of which weren’t even his work. The others would be waiting for him, their canvas almost completely painted. Dean doesn’t move, however, still sitting on the bed. He’s not ready to go. As awful as the depressing absence of Cas is, which burns and stings and throbs like a witch's curse, the prospect of changing it is worse. What if this doesn’t work? Would it easier if they never tried? He’s going to the Empty to get Billie: what if she won’t let Cas out? The world needs Death, but Dean needs Castiel. He can’t let the whole world suffer because of his greed, but he also can’t lose the guy again. It’s hard to keep track of time anymore, but he can feel the “paint” on his forehead drying. When he’s confident he wouldn’t ruin Claire’s handiwork, Dean grabs a shirt and pulls it over his head, careful not to ruin any other sigils. He’s not sure what going into the Empty will be like, but he wants as much protection as possible.
He’s never said it before. Of course, he’s told others he loved them, but never Cas. He tried to show it, through actions and gestures, and those special, quiet moments when they lay together at night. But he never actually put a voice to his thoughts. How could he? Castiel is so much to him. His love, his life, his angel. His curse, his burden, his aloof idiot who doesn’t understand references or like rock music. His brother in arms, his confidant, his companion in the middle of the night when all he wants to do was get drunk and think about nothing. He is more than all that. He’s Cas. The words sound clunky in Dean’s ears and a little rushed. Something cold and soft touches his chin. It tilts his head up, until Dean’s on his knees in supplication, sacrificing himself at the altar of Castiel. Dean opens his eyes, gasping softly.
“Me too.” He can’t say it. Won’t say it. There’s still the chance that things could go wrong, that Cas could be ripped from his arms again and it would all end too soon. Winchesters don’t get to win. As long as he doesn’t say that four letter word, he can keep Castiel safe. That’s all he wants now. After having lived in a world where Cas was dead and gone so many times, he doesn’t think he can survive it again. Cas tilts his head and Dean’s on him in an instant.
“I’m coming back,” Dean answers. His voice has enough confidence to convince Jack. It’s the same voice he used when he told Bobby they’d beat Michael and Lucifer. Dean can fake confidence just enough to convince his family he’ll be fine. He’d honed it after years and years of being alone with Sammy. Jack squeezes Dean’s wrist.
Castiel’s betrayed him twice now. Once due to his own mistakes, and the second time due to mind control. Maybe that time in the crypt shouldn’t count, but he did beat the shit out of Dean. Despite both times, he trusted Castiel completely. They’d been through too much together. The choice is easy.
The Empty is strange. There’s no time, no direction, no suffering. Just a nagging feeling of shame and the vast, unyielding dreadful void in all directions. Intimately familiar with the first feeling, and getting used to the second, Dean keeps wandering. He doesn’t hear much. Vaguely, he thinks he remembers hearing something, but he can’t remember what. He doesn’t know how long he’s been wandering, or in what direction. There isn’t direction. He keeps moving. He doesn’t know why he’s here. He keeps moving. He misses Sam. He keeps moving. He feels alone. He keeps moving. This is useless. He keeps moving. He’s going to die here. He keeps moving.
“Just a few others. You’ll remember them soon. They’re not causing any trouble, I promise,” he reassures. For a moment his eyes glow with angelic grace, and Dean feels a gentle heat in his chest.
Donna proposes. Sam struggles through a translation for Eileen, who can’t read the hunter’s lips across the room. The whole room cheers as Jody accepts. Claire instantly demands the group keep celebrating, finally having a good reason to break out the Good Stuff. No one disagrees.
Breathing exercises, long morning runs, and the occasional prayer for divine strength got Sam through it. There was no winning around Dean and Crowley. The two had a conniving, chaotic partnership and a language of smirks and eye sex only they understood. At least Rowena was on his side. He didn’t agree with her schemes to actually break them up (too many hex bags for his taste) but at least he had someone to share the pain with.
“After last night? I think you can do anything.” She giggls in response, dragging the brush across his spine. “How’d you know all that stuff about Gabriel yesterday?”
“He’s gone, Jody,” Sam answers. The loss is clear in his voice, too. Dean’s so caught up in his own grief, it’s easily to forget about his family’s. No one else saw Cas in his last moments, the determined glint in his eye, the soft smile. Sam and Jack only heard about it afterwards, days later.
“I had a life. I’ve had many. Colette was my true love, but I’ve fathered at least a tenth of humanity. Face it, son. I’m the one who’s going back to the Empty.” Dean shudders. He can’t bring himself to say the name of that hateful place, but Cain says it so casually. Brain spinning, Dean tries to think of another argument. The roadhouse radio sputters, switching channels at random for a minute. Cain doesn’t deserve this. Dean won’t kill him twice.
When the pain subsides, Dean opens his eyes. He hasn’t realized he closed them. Actually, he’s not sure he’s opening them now. Everything’s dark. Not the black ooze he expected, or even seen in the Bunker that awful day. No, instead there is just nothing. The absence of light. Dean closes his eyes and opens them again, but there’s no difference.
“Oh,” Dean breathes. “You weren’t kidding about being fully healed,” he jokes. The music fuzzes again as he realizes the implications of what he just said. Cas’ eyes widen and he focuses on his lap again. They can’t look at each other, and Dean choses to stare straight ahead. The rain thumping against the car is almost melodic.
“Yeaaaah, dumbass. He basically committed blasphemy putting that thing on you. There’s a great, big, neon sign on the Michael Sword that says ‘if lost, return to Castiel.’” Gabe laughs. “Michael was pissed when he found out, too. You’re lucky you still have the thing.” Instinctively, Dean raises a hand over the mark, shielding it from any would-be archangels that want to remove it. Gabe snorts again, before disappearing. Outside Dean’s door, the trickster loudly startes to hit on Sam, until Dean finally closes his door.
He gets up. Rowena finishes her story quickly. Gabriel leaves. Eileen rolls over, groaning and squishing up her face before finally opening her eyes.
“I go by many names,” Gabriel smirks, getting to his feet. “The trickster, Loki, Gabriel….” he trails off, letting the implications sink in. Donna shoots Dean an incredulous look. He only shrugs. She turns back at the archangel, sizing him up. He pointedly ignores her. “Anyhoo, I saw dear ol’ Dad was offin’ folks so I hid in the mountains for a little bit. Figured you and that gigantour brother of yours were behind it all. But now I need to find Castiel. Where is he?” Dean’s grip tightens on his pistol at Cas’ name. He swallows hard.
“We needed you to come,” he explains, still not meeting her eyes. “Without your help, we couldn’t have beaten Chuck.”
Wordlessly he pops the bottle open, taking a moment for the cold glass in his hands to sting against his nerves before risking a sip. He’s right: beer was too much. Choking the little bit down, he sets the drink on the table, sitting a respectable distance from Jack and Sam.
The girls stayed for a week. Sam calls in every favor the family (both Winchester and Campbell) ever had, and hands out a few, while Jack reads up on the plan. It’s insane. Stupid. Futile.
“You feel it too, huh?” Dean asked, dryly. He couldn’t stop feeling it. They were right where Cas died, staring at the place where the Empty broke through to kill him. Claire nodded, pulling her hand away. “Why’d you want to talk alone?” Dean asked, unsure why Jody or Donna couldn’t be here. He was beginning to second guess showing Claire the place her other father died, when she spoke up.
“Love sucks,” Dean agrees, letting a few tears fall. Instinctively, he wipes them away, staring at the ceiling.
“Cain’s gone,” she admits, hesitantly. “If I lose you in the Empty, our bond will be broken. For the first time in years, I’ll be alone.” Something in his heart weeps at the thought, remembering experiences of millenia trapped in the Empty, while Chuck’s creations thrived in his absence. Her absence. Shaking slightly, Dean reminds himself those are her memories, not his. He is more than the Mark of Cain.
“If we’re in my mind, why does everything hurt,” Dean complains. Cas looks down at his own lap, taking his hand off Dean’s shoulder. He remains quiet, even when Dean looks over. “Buddy? Can you hear me?” he prods, leaning forward. Cas seems like he’s in pain, too.
“Tell me about it.” He’s intrigued and worried, shooting Dean a quick look. Jody’s one of the most capable hunters in the country, and with Donna and the girls by her side she’s downright unstoppable. Weird, in her book, usually means the Winchesters are in for a once in a lifetime hunt.
“Ok, I have a plan,” he states louder, looking into Castiel’s vacant eyes again. “I can get you out of here. But you have to put the Empty back to sleep.”
The weight of the truth hangs between them. He’s right, and they know it. Castiel can’t ask- won’t ask- Dean to stop that protective instinct which was drilled into him from Sam’s birth and reinforced every day since. His need to help others is in his DNA, but even that doesn’t describe it. It’s something Castiel pulled out of damnation, baked into Dean’s very soul, sticking with him through Hell, Heaven, Purgatory, the Empty, and everything else. Before he died, Castiel claimed everything Dean did was out of love. And he was right, but that didn’t make it any less heartbreaking. Because love isn’t something you can turn on and off. It’s an open sore that refuses treatment and burns with every breath. It’s a fire that consumes whatever’s in its path without remorse. It’s as powerful as gravity, essential to the universe and yet invisible and understated. It’s deadly and healing and a thousand other things. It’s what drew Castiel toward him in Hell, and kept pulling him closer and closer until he’s here, inches apart, looking in his eyes. So he won’t ask Dean to stop.
“No,” Dean hisses, slamming his hands on the table. Cain doesn’t even react. Dean curses under his breath, hating how easily the older man could read him. He couldn’t even keep Billie’s sick deal a secret from him.
So how did Naomi touch on it? She didn’t mention the others- Azazel, Abbadon, the British Men of Letters, Asmodeus. All those bad guys Sam didn’t want to spill his guts about. He only talked to Dean if it was a last resort, and never spoke of them around Cas. Of course Naomi wouldn’t know about them- Castiel didn’t. She was hitting all the points she knew hurt Sam because Castiel knew they hurt Sam. He’s instantly angry again, wondering how deeply buried some of those secrets were, how desperately Cas tried to guard them against her or how she’d tainted them in his mind. Naomi appeared as an ally, but she was far from a friend. At least with Crowley, you knew you’d get double crossed. Sam tightens his lips for a moment before coming to a decision.
Their voice is haunted. Dean remembers they’ve been to the Empty. They have to have some idea of whatever hell Cas is experiencing. But when Jack got there, Billie helped them escape. Dean’s sure Billie wouldn’t be doing Cas the same favor, even if she still had her powers. Her powers: something Dean deprived her of by striking death with her own scythe. Once again, his bloodlust ruined the day.
“Just wanted to see how far along you are,” Gabriel cooes. He moves so that Dean os forced to see him, wearing the shirt Sam had on yesterday. Great. “Candy?” he offers, materializing a red lollipop in one hand.
“Then Claire was right,” Jody states, ominously. There’s more rustling on her end of the phone, before some distant shouting, and Jody’s voice comes through again. “We’re headed to you. Text Donna the directions?” Despite her tone, the Winchesters know it’s an order. Before anyone can ask why, and what the apparent rush is on her end, Jody speaks again.
“Just rest,” he soothes, and Dean almost falls asleep again. He can’t, though. There’s too many questions in his brain. All those years of hunting had trained his body to stay awake until he was satisfied. While this wasn’t paranoia, he didn’t like being in an unfamiliar location.
They never said it. Dean didn’t have to ask, he just lead by example. No matter how much he yearned to say it, to whisper those three little words, he couldn’t. It was his curse. Winchesters couldn’t fall in love. Anyone they dared to say the words to would suffer. Dean made that mistake already, with Lisa, with Benny, with Charlie, with Mary, with Jack, with Bobby, with Sam. He couldn’t do it to Castiel. Every time he saw those singed wings, burned up in his fall from grace, or the lost look in his blue eyes, something Naomi tried to torture out of him, or the few scars that decorated his smooth skin, holdovers from his wars against Heaven, Raphael, Metatron, and now God, Dean remembered. He couldn’t say those words, no matter how badly he wanted to.
He’s drowned before. In water, in fire, in trauma, in grief, you name it. But this? He’s drowning in a feeling he’s never felt before- completion. Here, holding and being held, safe and in danger, wounded and healing, angelic grace mixing with human soul, he feels complete.
His wandering accelerates into a run, taking him in the opposite direction of wherever the cannibalistic sounds come from. Eventually the sounds become more distant. He still can’t see anything. Dean slows to a stop, out of breath. How long has he been running? Panting, he tries to remember more about why he entered the Empty. He has a mission: find Billie and Castiel. He felt a burning pain that stopped when he reached the abyss. He’d been covered in sigils. Checking his body now, they’re all gone. He’s kept the clothes he took in on his way to the Empty, but all the guns, ammo, and angel blade he’d had were just gone.
Dean finally finds the words, and continues. His fingers are still playing with Jack’s hair. It’s getting longer and longer. One of these days, Dean’s going to cut it. Maybe he’ll finally cut Sam’s hair, too.
Benny doesn’t believe him. Dean smiles. Things have changed since they last met- a lot of things changed. The bunker for instance. It’s full of people and Benny admits he can hear every single one, the human blood calls to him and his hand around Dean’s neck squeezes. Dean shakes his head. The world’s changed. Hunters are better about which monsters should be killed and which shouldn’t. He’ll keep in touch this time. God’s no longer torturing them and they’re finally free to just be. It won’t be perfect, but it’ll be better. He promises. Benny laughs, shaking loose something Dean’s tried to keep tied up for almost ten years now. They move closer, hugging and laughing and just breathing. They made it.
“We’re in your mind,” Cas explains. Dean narrows his eyes, suspicious, but Cas just smiles. “Don’t try to focus, that makes this harder. You saved me from the Empty, remember?” Dean looks away and laughs, this time for real. He doesn’t remember actually going, but Cas sounds truthful. The last week was full of preparing to go to the Empty, had he already done it? Had it been easy?
“What are you?” Dean recognises the voice. A cool dread trickles down his spine as he turns to confront the figure speaking.
Maybe it was that disarming Southern Charm. As Lucifer’s body, he got regrettably familiar with Hell’s Princes, one of which fancied himself a colonel sanders knock off. Benny’s twang and lopsided smile reassured Dean, but it only made Sam more suspicious. His dumbass brother couldn’t see the shark in the water, but Sam could. And he’d do anything to keep Dean safe. Currently, that meant bitching about his vampire friend.
It was his father’s dying fucking wish and Dean couldn’t do it. He wasn’t good enough- he was never good enough. Dully, his wrist hurts. Dean ignores the pain, realizing a silence had settled over the room, only broken by Jack’s unsteady breathing.
“Your warding could use some work,” she criticizes. It’s a fair response, simple and honest. Much more than Dean deserves. He swallows, feeling every agonizing second tick by. Finally he turns around, looking into her eyes.
“I can’t let you do that.” Naomi’s face falls, and Sam feels his arms grow heavy. Just a few minutes ago he’d lost control of his body, but this is different. Now it’s being punished with the weight of... something, crushing his limbs.
“Why don’t you tell him that when we get him back?” Donna nudges. The spell’s almost ready. They’ll need about half a day (for the seeds to cool down) and Dean. He shakes his head.
“What’d it cost?” Dean asks. Visions of his own ill fated plans to save Sammy dance through his mind. Everything from the first time he killed someone to last month, when he seriously considered letting Sam kill him so Chuck would finally be satisfied. Max’s eyes are distant, and he breathes in deeply. Dean did the same when he told Bobby about his demon deal. Neither Max nor Dean would apologize for their actions, but admitting to them is still painful.
“C’mon man, we don’t have a lot of time. Think,” Dean encourages, checking behind Cas again. He lightly squeezes the angel’s shoulder.
“I want to see my parents again,” Cain confesses. He’s looking down at the bar, long, grey hair falling in his eyes. Dean’s eyes narrow. Adam’s still alive, somehow. His spite against Chuck was the only thing keeping him going. “After I killed Abel, God banished me. I was young and dumb, and I didn’t even try to reach out. I died alone in Babylon. There was no going back. The longer I stalled, the harder it was to see him again. I haven’t seen him in millennia.”
Sam doesn’t want to admit it, but he’s still thinking about her words and they make a great point. He doesn’t trust a thing she says, but she’d only be here out of necessity. After all, they’d survived about eight years without seeing her again. The only reason Naomi would risk showing up where infamous serial murderers Sam and Dean Winchester could easily kill her would be if it was important. And these life ending horrors sound important.
“You don’t know that they’re dead.” Dean muttered. It’s a weak argument, but he has to try. Years ago, when they’d first met, Cain said he recognised himself in Dean. There was the obvious, of course: they both had younger brothers who Satan took a personal interest in. They were both murderers, forced into a life of psychotic killing by supernatural forces. They’d both died and come back, both been demons, both fallen in love and brought unspeakable torture upon their lover. They’d both suffered. Looking at Cain now, Dean began to see himself in the immortal. He set his jaw in anger, the same way Dean did when John didn’t leave enough food for his sons on long hunts. Something behind those blue eyes seemed broken, but it was buried deep.
Dean wakes up in bed. Castiel’s arm is slung over his side, impossibly warm and heavy enough to keep him in place. The angel’s pressed into his back, chin resting on Dean’s shoulder. He’s sleeping. It’s enough to lull Dean back to sleep, all the thoughts swimming in his mind drifting away. When he wakes again, it’s to a soft tug as a hand pushes through his hair. It’s loving and gentle. Dean leans into the touch, moaning softly. His side still hurts, and he doesn’t know how long it’ll last. The pain begs him to stay in bed, warm and safe and comfortable. He’s got half a mind to listen to it, turning slightly so he could see the man tenderly playing with his hair. Cas smiles and moves closer.
Dean wanders back into the kitchen, where his family is sitting now, discussing something earnestly. Jack’s smiling, pressed into Castiel’s side, gesturing wildly with their hands. Amara’s nodding, and Billie has the same calm face she wore when she reaped Cain. Dean sits on Castiel’s other side, between his angel and Amara, and refuses to make eye contact. God might be dead, but the universe still has it out for him.
“Tell me where the Nephilim is,” she commands, standing from her seat. Sam tries to match, but he can’t move at all. His whole body is at her mercy, sitting upright in the war room chair. Confidently, she walks behind him, and holds an angel blade- where did she get that- to his throat. “Tell me, human.”
Don’t react. It’s the first rule. Sam struggles to follow it, jaw tightening in anger, but he keeps his mouth shut. Naomi’s an angel, he knows how to kill her. It's small consolation, but it’s enough. He can’t wait to plunge an angel blade into her chest.
“Don’t you want to stop? Or even just pause?” Sam argues. He steps into the room, hands shoved into his jeans’ pockets. “Take a break? We’ve earned it, Dean.” Sam used to talk about retiring. He wanted to settle down, maybe go back to school, say those famous last words “one last hunt” and be done with the supernatural. Dean wasn’t sure when he changed, but he did. Now he only talks about pausing, taking some time off, always inevitably returning to hunting. Dean doesn’t know how to feel about that. After fighting for so long to get his family back together, it feels good and reassuring to have Sam so committed. Selfishly, he enjoys knowing his brother’s out with him, dedicated the way he is. But it also stings. Sammy had fought so hard to get out. He spent his entire childhood as a whiny brat, always the contrarian to whatever their shitty dad wanted. It’s part of who Sam was. Dean had accepted his role; he was the brave, stupid hunter. Strong and useless. Sam is so much more, though. He has wit and potential, strength and smarts that always keep him alive. Dean hopes that fighting spirit in his brother hasn’t died, slitting its wrists at the realization that they could never stop hunting. Dean’s certainly had. He was only 16 when it happened, but he remembers the moment like it was yesterday. John claps him on the back, laughing as the werewolf dies and slow and painful death. It wasn’t that Dean accepted his life. He realized he was trapped, and gave up waiting for rescue.
“You’re not the first guy I’ve painted,” he commentes, stepping close enough to steal Rowena’s sigil sheet and look at some of the designs. “Besides, you’re not my type.”
Closing his eyes again, he runs a hand through his hair and sighs. Since the Empty had taken him, Dean didn’t pray to Cas. He didn’t want to waste the breath, confident the angel wouldn’t hear him admitting weakness. There was just no point.
“You don’t have to lie to me, Sam Winchester. I assume he went into the Empty?” Sam says nothing, the weight of the useless gun in his hand getting heavier and heavier.
“No!” Dean shouts, now. Anger fills his body, straightening his posture and finally bringing him to look the stupid bastard in the eyes. The roadhouse lights glow brighter. “You don’t deserve it. The Mark is over and Amara’s been out for a while now. We can move on,” he urges, softening under Cain’s glare. “You can finally live your life.”
“I’ll give you some time,” she excuses, gliding towards the roadhouse door. Her scythe remains. As soon as the door shuts behind her, three pairs of eyes fall on Dean. He can’t meet any of them. Instead, he keeps his head down. The glass in his dominant hand is clean, nearly spotless, but there are more that are still dirty. He wants to say something, mouth achingly dry. Silence reigns over the roadhouse, not even the sound of the rag against a glass breaking it. The lights flicker. Dean winces, his arm beginning to ache. On the outside, he knows his body’s been hit. He’s familiar with the pain, having been punched more times than he could count, but it still hurts. A warm wind rushes through the room, despite the windows and door being closed. Impossibly, it feels apologetic, and Dean knows it’s Cas. He’s manning the steering wheel for a vessel that isn’t his. Of course, Dean forgives him, the sentiment hanging in the air before he can verbalize it. Crowley sighs and rolls his eyes. Right. They’re all in his head- they can hear him. He can’t wait until they leave.
“It’ll be ok,” Dean tried to soothe, pretending a tear of his own didn’t fall. Claire shook her head.
“He had a premonition!” Jack blurts out. Dean blinks. He’s caught between looking from Sam to Jack, positive this is a dream.
Dean’s silent for a minute, not sure how to respond. It should be impossible- he wasn’t an angel, didn’t have grace or power or whatever angels had that let them touch and brand souls like Gabriel said. Even if Dean had that mojo, this was just a vessel- Castiel didn’t have a soul to brand, and this wasn’t his body to scar. Dean steps forward, his hand already aching to rest on the inflamed spot. It fits perfectly. Cas moves his hand to Dean’s shoulder, compelled by the same unnamed thing Dean was.
A month passes. Jack’s already reading what the Men of Letters deemed “the classics.” Sam’s not sure how he feels about that, knowing they’re foundational to modern literature but also horrendously xenophobic. They discuss the problematic elements of each book together. The last thing the world needs is a God who agrees with Immanuel Kant. Painfully, Jack’s enthusiasm reminds Sam of his prelaw days, debating ethics and philosophical truths with other teens. It’s a strange form of nostalgia- Sam doesn’t miss undergrad classes, or Stanford. He misses what they represented, yet he’s not even sure he misses that. Dean crashed his life years ago, but it hasn’t been all bad. Having someone to lean on is comforting, and waking up knowing most of his family is alive is the best feeling in the world.
Sam might not be supportive of Dean’s boyfriends, but he can support Dean. He slides another beer across the table, and Dean gratefully opens it, gulping the contents like his sanity depends on it. Tonight, it just might. He doubts his brother’s liver can handle the amount of beer it’ll take to get Dean to sleep, so he switches tactics.
“Good. The more help we can get, the better,” she mutters, clearly busy doing something with her hands. After some commotion on the other end, Jody’s voice comes back clearer. “Something weird happened last month, and then again last night.”
“So, who’s the shortie?” Gabe’s question throws Sam off guard. Eileen is talking to Jody, laughing about some hunting story. Sam realizes he’s been staring, and quickly tries to shake it off. Gabriel hadn’t said much about the “angel business” he needed to talk to Castiel about, but he decided to stay and lend a hand with the spell. Sam knows that look in his eyes, however. Tonight, he wants to score.
“Hello Gabriel.” All the warmth hidden in the archangel’s voice is lacking in her’s. Sam shudders, remembering the bits and pieces he knew about heavenly torture. Anna said it was worse than Hell. Cas considered it worse than his time as Lucifer’s vessel. His own experience with Lucifer in The Cage was indescribably awful. If Naomi could even get close to that amount of psychological agony-
He knows what's going on, but sharing control with Castiel's different. Dean has both accounts, his own and his angel’s. So when he opens his eyes and sees the imposing form of Naomi, angel blade thrust into his shoulder, he's more than a little pissed.
“Get the cuffs,” Sam breathes, giving Dean something to do. His brother obeys, leaving the room. Jack enters curiously, and the other hunters filter in a few minutes later. Dean returns with the angel cuffs, unsure if they’ll work on an archangel. They worked on Jack when the kid was weakened, and possibly held back Apocalypseworld Michael. Sam slaps them over Gabe’s wrists. This isn’t the first archangel risk they’ve taken.
“Let me get this straight. You Winchesters ruined the world, and want me to bail you out again?” Dean shrugs again, this time sheepishly. That’s certainly one way of putting it. “Tough shit, kid. You’re the last person I want to see. And after the stunt you pulled” she takes off part of her shirt, revealing the lethal scrape on her shoulder Dean left. “I’m not helping you do anything.”
“Crowley, Benny, a few others. It’s nothing to worry about. Neither is this.” He points to where the ooze bleeds from his eyes. Dean tries to interject, but Cas continues. “And, I know what’s hunting us: a leviathan.”
Kevin comes in a few minutes later, not even bothering with the door. He simply appears on the other side. Stupid ghost powers. Dean doesn’t look up. At this point, he’s conceded people will be coming in and out all morning, ogling the grieving man like he’s an animal in a zoo. Come to think of it, he almost was. Back when the Mark of Cain possessed Dean, Cuthbert Sinclair wanted to use him, valuing his worth as a rare item and weapon more than a hunter. Sam saved him, but that hadn’t stopped Dean from uttering a hushed, desperate prayer to Cas.
“Dean? Are you alright?” Cas’ voice is laced with concern. He steps forward, and Dean can feel how close the angel is. He nods, the pain already fading. His head rings as multiple things try to talk over each other, but none of them are louder than overworld Michael was. He can handle this.
Dean nods. If this past month has taught him anything, it’s that he’s useless alone. He can’t do anything by himself. Truthfully, he doesn’t want to do anything alone anymore. Billie snaps her fingers, and smiles.
The plan to build a dead, fake celestial is 100% homebrewed, untested, and risky. Putting said dead, fake celestial in Dean is even more so. Sam checks Rowena’s list again, trying to silence the voice in the back of his head screaming that this is a trap.
In hindsight, he should’ve been nicer to Ash. Ash was a roadie, sure, but he was smart. Ellen and Jo trusted him. He showered every day. If only he’d been more supportive. But hindsight was 20/20, and Sam hadn’t had time to process his older brother was bisexual before opening his mouth. Nothing could’ve prepared Sam for opening the door to Ash’s room and finding him *in flagrante* with Dean. He stood there, for a moment, holding terrible eye contact with Ash, before they both shouted. Sam slammed the door shut, ran into the Impala, and considered bleaching his eyes. A few minutes later, Dean entered through the driver’s side, wearing the same clothes as last night, albeit more wrinkled. They didn’t say anything for a while, and then spoke at once.
He has more questions, but Dean interrupts him. The final “ingredient” of the spell showed up. Sam tries to ignore Amara following, hand in hand with his brother. The warding on the bunker must be broken. He adds it to his mental “to-do” list. It can wait: there’s a very powerful, very experimental, ritual first.
Sam soon decided knowing both Castiel and Dean, as tiresome as they could be, was better than not knowing Dean’s boyfriend. Benny Lafitte was a murderer, pirate, member of some southern monster mafia, and Dean’s newest flame. He didn’t know what purgatory was like, of course, but when Dean would say “he’s my brother in arms” and then leave it at that, Sam remembered what hell was like. Sure, his brother took after their mother, but he could be just as cagey with information as Dad. And just as blind.
His head hurts. He needs to eject everyone from his head. They don’t belong, and he made a deal with Billie, although he’s not exactly sure how to honor it. Sam opens his mouth to say something, but Dean silences him.
I got a fuckload of papers to do so chapter 3 will take a while to get out. i say this, even though it's taken like two months to get this chapter out, and i started it THE DAY i posted chapter one :/
“Cas I-” Dean’s voice falters. He can’t say it. The Winchester Curse had already hurt Castiel so much, he refused to make it worse. Baby’s radio plays a few memories, of telling Lisa he loves her, of telling Benny, and of telling Lee. They all ended badly. Thunder rumbles for the first time, shockingly close to the car. Dean’s worried for a moment, before remembering this is his mind. He probably couldn’t get struck by lightning in here. “Don’t leave me,” he pleads, not able to hold it back anymore. The rain pours outside, and Cas sighs sympathetically. Dean can’t say “I love you,” but he can say so much more.
“Where.” He asks it too seriously to be a question, and scans the void beyond Cas’ beautiful face for any signs of danger. All he sees is darkness. Castiel shakes his head. He doesn’t know either. Dean bites his lip. He doesn’t like the circumstances, but they aren’t entirely hopeless. “Ok,” he mutters, making a decision.
“Eileen Leahy. A damn good hunter.” He won’t arm the Trickster with too much knowledge, but he doesn’t want to push Gabriel away. Sam smiles to himself, half content seeing Eileen’s gentle smile, half nostalgic for the days when he didn’t have to be cagey with information. When did all his allies become threats? When did all the threats become allies?
They didn’t start actually dating until a few months later. He wouldn’t admit it, but when Zachariah had him cornered, completely alone, promising all kinds of torture not even Alastair could dream up, he was terrified. But then Castiel saved him, once again gripping him tight and raising him from the threat of holy perdition. Dean couldn’t stop himself. In a moment of thoughtless passion, he grabbed the angel’s scruffy face and kissed him until his heart rate finally slowed. To his surprise, Cas reciprocated, one arm snaking around Dean’s waist. He pointedly ignored the phantom pain plaguing his wrist.
“You passed out,” he explains, fondly. Dean closes his eyes. He doesn’t have to leave yet. “I brought you here.”
“Yes, I am,” Dean snaps, finally meeting her eyes. “I wish I never found you that day. I wish I hadn’t taken on the Mark. I wish I could take it all back, but I can’t, and I’m sorry.” His voice wavers, almost breaks, on that last admission. Dean doesn’t realize he’d raised his voice until he feels Sam’s worried gaze on his back. It’s not judgemental or condemning. Sam peers at his brother the way he always did, with big, round eyes trying to learn and emulate. Dean knows he’ll be hearing about this later, and is already drafting a few ways to shut Sam down. Dreadful as that prospect is, Amara’s gaze is worse. Because while Sam looks at Dean like he always had, Amara’s never glared at him before. She used to look at Dean with passion, their cosmic, unspeakable, insatiable bond drawing them together. Now, she’s lost, eyes clouded in thought. There’s an earnest longing to her, something that desperately yearns to lean in and consume Dean, but her jaw sets in barely restrained anger. For a moment the world goes silent. Dean’s trapped, like the subject of a painting, forced into an arbitrary, static position for eternity at the whim of a more powerful artist.
“Any idea how to do that?” he asks his hand, hoping Billie will respond. Flashes of her deal with Jack and the Empty play in his mind. Billie’s memories again. She needed Jack and the other Winchesters to destroy Chuck. She would absorb some of his power, using it to put the Empty back to sleep. She could still do it, if Dean keeps his end of the deal. He would certainly try, although he doesn’t like the idea of leaving someone behind. Dean closes his eyes again, trying to concentrate on Castiel. In his mind’s eye, he pictures the dork, with the trenchcoat and doughy face Dean wants to see again. When he opens his eyes, he’s still alone. Bille’s explanation repeats in his head again. He has to give himself over to thoughts of Castiel so completely and wholeheartedly that the Empty thinks he is Cas. Dean tries. He thinks about Castiel, angel of the lord, only being to truly have free will independent of Chuck’s influence. And then he stops. His wrist hurts with that stupid phantom pain.
“I did what I had to,” he mumbles in a voice Dean recognises. He’s used it far too many times himself. In a strange way, the Winchesters and Banes are the only people who could recognise that tone. Every hunter has their sob story about how they entered The Life, but being raised in it is completely different. There’s a forced codependency between hunter siblings, visible if you know what to look for. Sam and Dean noticed it immediately, the way the Twins linger in the same room, or always sit next to each other, or meet eyes every five minutes. The Winchesters did it themselves, never wanting to be in different rooms, or have someone between them, or not know what the other was thinking. Their souls are conjoined, linked in some metaphysical way that meant any separation was too much. He wonders if Sam felt as lonely and broken as Dean did when Sammy ran off to Stanford. Did he stay awake at night, painfully aware how quiet the room was without his brother’s breathing? Did Max?
“Interesting question,” Gabe responds, wiggling his shoulders. “To make a long story short, yes and no. Ask Rowena for more details if you want.” He winks at the witch, who fires back an equally sultry look.
“I’m not God!” Jack says it like they’re showing off a prize. Billie explains Jack gave up the power easily. They didn’t want it in the first place. There’ll be an adjustment period, and Jack’s body will have to acclimate to being just a nephilim again. It doesn’t sound bad yet. Dean prepares himself for the worst. There has to be something worse.
“The beings in here are talking together, using their miniscule power to keep me awake. Make it stop, and I’ll let you out.” As soon as Anna appears, she leaves. Dean checks his hand, half expecting to see Anna’s name where Death’s had been. Nothing happens.
“Who else is here?” Dean demands, eyes widening. He needs to change the conversation. Cas appears relieved to change it too, finally meeting Dean’s eyes.
“Naomi. I’ve heard of you,” he sneers, trying to take back control of the situation. This isn’t the first time a supernatural something or other had him cornered.
There’s also the other reason Dean can’t look at Kevin. Despite being a ghost, Kevin’s pretty good at being visible. Sure, Dean sees him whenever they’re in the same room, but Dean can’t really *look* at him. Not in the eyes. There’s too much guilt, too many regrets. Every time Dean sees Kevin, he remembers watching the kid die at Gadreel’s hands. Before that, Kevin was functionally dead, spending all his time in Garth’s safe houseboat or the bunker. He never went outside, barely slept, and didn’t talk to anyone outside of when Crowley tortured him, or when the Winchesters remembered to check in. Dean doesn’t know which is worse.
“Wait- soul branding?” Dean asks. He hasn’t thought about the handprint scar too often, but he remembers getting it. It certainly didn’t feel like being branded.
“I saw you there.” Her voice is sharp as ever. Dean sighs. This means the spell would at least get him there, right? “But I also saw that *thing* there, too. The one that eats people alive.”
“Bitch!” Dean shouts, running to cover up the doorway with as much of his body as possible while Cas scrambles to put on his shirt. He feels like he’s 17, kicking his stupid 13 year old brother out of the Impala. “Haven’t you heard of knocking?”
He wakes up intermittently, stirring just enough to move around, maybe even shift his weight, and groan a little. The fourth time he half heartedly rolls over, Dean finally wakes. His whole body aches and the world is blurry. Beneath him, Baby’s engine purrs, and the window wipers occasionally thump, sloshing rain off the windshield. He blinks a few times, forcing the world into focus. He’s in Baby’s passenger seat, being driven down a long, lonely road. Outside it rains, but there’s no thunder or lightning. It’s dark out, and not a single star dots the night sky. Looking over his shoulder, a small smile pulls at Dean’s lips. Castiel is driving, a content look on his face. Some Taylor Swift song plays on the radio. It’s the one Dean gets stuck in his head sometimes, the pop beat too damn catchy. He’ll never admit this to Sam, but he actually loves it.
“I’ll take that as a no. Not many humans know what it’s like. Angels don’t either- Castiel is one of the only of our rank to come back from it mentally sane. But I know enough. It’s better if you leave Castiel in there. And since you were stupid enough to do the spell, you’ll have to leave Dean, too.”
It’s morning and Castiel isn’t here. He has this thought everyday, but it hurts all the same. Castiel’s dead. Sam didn’t even get to see his best friend in his last, triumphant moment. Instead, he gets a front row seat to how Castiel’s death is ripping his family apart. That’s all supposed to change, right? The ritual is today. No doubt Dean didn’t sleep at all, but Sam won’t press him. He’s got too much on his mind.
“Talk,” Donna commands. The room falls silent, waiting for Gabriel’s explanation. Even the hunters who don’t know him are interested.
“He’s there because of me. He died so I could-” Jack’s voice catches. Dean turns, sees the kid’s small body hunched in on itself on his bed, and stops painting. He makes his way over to Jack’s side, sitting next to them.
Pride calls himself the original sin. Of course he does, he’s Pride. On this weird string of loosely connected tragedies Dean calls his life, he’d met the guy. Despite all his grand talk, he died just as easily as any other demon. So did Dean. He was a damn good hunter, but for all his skill and training, he’d been killed by a hellhound. For all his talk and posturing, Dean died just like all the other bastards stupid enough to sell their souls. But he wasn’t prideful. No, his vice of choice was selfishness. It’s a strange paradox: Dean wants nothing for himself, but he’s the most selfish man on the planet. Sam died many times, but the shock and terror of his first death still weighs on the older brother’s shoulders. It keeps him up at night, replays in nightmares, and renews Dean’s determination to keep Sam safe. He would, and has, given everything to his brother. And yet he’s still stubbornly selfish.
“What if you don’t come back?” Jack whispers. The question’s not directed at Dean, necessarily. They asked it to the air, to the room that would be vacant if Dean never came back, to the bed that would be cold, to the dog that wouldn’t get scraps of dinner, to the floor that wouldn’t be swept at night. They’re asking it to themself, wondering how they could move forward without Castiel or Dean. They’d have Sam, of course, and Eileen and Jody and everyone else who’d bothered to show up to the bunker this week. But that’s not the same, and Dean knows it. Loss isn’t the kind of wound you can placate with a bandaid. It’s a deep gash that bleeds every morning you wake up alone, and demands to be felt for the rest of your life. It’s a parasite that eats at your soul until it eventually takes you over, or you mestastazie it, turning your own pain into something that can hurt others. It’s nasty, and not something a kid should have to deal with.
Praying no one else would visit soon, he took off his pants, starting to paint the sigils that are meant for his thighs. Despite Chuck no longer having the power to ruin his life, the universe still doesn’t give Dean what he wants, as Max Banes knocked on the door not one minute after Dean closed it.
“No, you listen here, Boyo,” Donna’s voice is filled with malice. “Want our help? We’re more than happy to. But first, you’re gonna help us.” She grabs him by the arm, turns quickly on her heel and marches back towards the war room. “C’mon Dean!” she calls, before disappearing out of sight.
“When’s the last time you read Genesis?” It throws Dean off guard. He tries to think, going over the last biblical hunts he dealt with. The roadhouse radio barks out a few of the memories, and Dean groans. He doesn’t like how open his mind is.
“C’mon Sam. There’s always gonna be more monsters.” It sounds like a joke, but feels too honest to be laughable. The sad truth is that there will always be more monsters, more hunts, more apocalypses. Just another part of the Winchester Curse. They were born into his life, both as Campbell Hunters and as Men of Letters. Their parent’s marriage was planned by Heaven, their roles and destiny determined before they were even born. Every time they try to step back, take a break, stop fighting, the world punishes them for it. They don’t get to have lives. This doesn’t get to be over.
The bunker has air controls, but that doesn’t stop nights from being cold. Dean supposes it’s something about the walls being coated in metal a few times over, or maybe the magic protections are warding out heat. Either way, it’s not important. Tonight’s warmer than usual, since the whole group (including Miracle) all gather in the library. There’re plenty of beers to go around (hexxed by Alicia so no one under 17 years old could open them), and Sam called in pizza several hours ago. Gabriel, although arriving on hostile terms, elects to stay for the “great company.” Dean rolls his eyes, but secretly is happy. Just because he doesn’t have the love of his life anymore doesn’t mean he should stop anyone else from a good time. Even Kevin joins in the fun, trading a few hunting stories here and there. Jody, Garth, and Linda get along famously. Dean hangs around Donna, periodically sipping from the same beer. He knows his secrets are safe with her, but that doesn’t stop him from hovering. Donna doesn’t seem to mind. She even elbows Dean when Claire and Kaia sneak off from the party, finally acting their age and being reckless teenagers. Patience, Eileen, Max, Alicia, and Alex are deep in a conversation about politics or something (Dean’s not paying attention). Miracle happily mills about, stealing a pizza slice when she thinks no one’s looking. Earlier that day, Dean found her in his room, sound asleep on the bed. Gabriel is a dick, but he didn’t harm a single hair on her fluffy head. Around ten pm Donna whisks Dean off to a neastingly dusty part of the library.
“Yes, I will.” She pulls Donna up off the ground and into a warm kiss, as the library cheers. Claire, ever the opportunist, demands they all celebrate. A few more rounds of beer are scrounged up (breaking into Dean’s Not So Secret Stash) and the party continues well into the night. Hours later, people start to depart for bed. Donna and Jody are first, although no one thinks they’re going to sleep. Rowena and Gabe abscond with Sam and Eileen, all opting to share one room that night (Dean pushes thoughts of his brother’s past, failed hookups out of his mind). The twins leave at the same time as the Trans. Kevin and Linda are staying for the ritual tomorrow, but then Linda has a business meeting to get to. The rest of the girls (and Jack) eventually sneak out, leaving just Dean, Garth, and Miracle to clean up.
Rowena begins the spell. The whole room watches with baited breath. No one knows what’s supposed to happen. Sam’s hand traces down Eileen’s arm. Her fingers lace with his. She shoots him a sympathetic smile. His heartbeat slows down, just for a moment. Sam’s nervous, nothing can stop that, but knowing Eileen’s here is enough. She promised to stay for the whole week. He’s been thinking of a few ways to make her stay longer.
“No. We’ll deal with whatever came out, the same way we always do.” Sam’s already talking like Cas and Dean are back, as if they’re here, suffering this interrogation with him. But they’re not, and his confidence begins to wilt as Naomi tries a different tactic.
“There’s a protection amulet in the dungeon. Take it with you.” Dean doesn’t respond; he doesn’t need to. Eileen’s a master when it comes to reading body language, and from the simple hunch in his shoulders, heavier than usual, she can see he’s mentally somewhere else. He’ll do as she asked, since apparently he’s taking requests, but that doesn’t mean he has to look happy about it. As far as art projects go, he’s a pretty disappointing one. Finishing the sigil with a swish of the brush, tickling Dean’s sensitive skin, she smiles and leaves.
Sam’s instantly on his feet. Their last meeting with Gabriel was…. Was it real? He’s seen the archangel die so many times. Nonetheless, he’s surprised. Did Gabe miss all the struggle and death in Apocalypseworld? What’s he been doing for the past two years? How had none of the Winchesters noticed? Seemingly reading his mind, the archangel locks eyes with Sam and flashes that on-brand, shiteating grin.
There’s no actual way for The Empty to enter the world of God’s creation. It has to be summoned, and even then, it only stays for as long as necessary. There’re very few things that could summon pure void. The final resting spot of angels and demons isn’t sedintary, though. Jack’s death, and Castiel’s deal, had been enticing enough. It wants a dead celestial. And by god, the Winchesters are going to give it one.
Instantly, Dean’s on his feet, hugging Castiel, laughing and burying his face in the angel’s neck. The trenchcoat is cold and a little stiff, but Dean’s fingers clench it anyways, desperate to hold Cas. He’s spent so many nights fantasizing about this, about wrapping the angel in his arms and never letting go. He never imagined it’d be in the Empty, a steady cold dread permeating the air around them, but he doesn’t care. All that matters is that Castiel’s here. When he pulls back, just enough to look at Castiel’s face, he frowns.
Confidently, the woman smiles, walks back towards the table, and pulls a seat out. Motioning to one of the other chairs, she sits and clasps her hands in front of her. Sam briefly remembers talking to his college professors. They’d always be sitting behind their desk, imposing and threatening without even moving. Sam shakes his head, still standing. He won’t play this game. His fingers are tight around the gun, even though it’s resting at his side. Around the hallway, he hears the sounds of more hunters coming. Footsteps and ammo mix into a soft clacking that Sam suspects the sitting woman can also hear. For a moment, the two regard each other cooly.
It’s not his body. Cas is on his back, staring at his hands. Dean’s hands. He’d recognise these calloused fingers anywhere. Like a baby learning fine motor control, he flexes his muscles, waving curled fingers in front of his eyes. Seeing is such a weird thing. The pain in his side grows. He’s never felt it before, and is almost hesitant to find out why. Swallowing quickly, he checks Dean’s side.
*What’s happening* Dean wants to shout at the air, looking at the concrete ceiling. Miracle waits by his legs, confident someone would eat soon.
“I know,” Dean says. His voice is equally haunted, equally hollow. It’s true: he knows. He knows the sacrifice Cas made. He knows Cas didn’t tell him for at least a year, and planned to keep that secret forever. And most damningly, he knows what Jack is feeling. Memories of that hospital room float in his mind. Tessa trying to reap him, Yellow Eyes possessing her, John’s final words:
“I am not your friend. Truthfully, I hate you. But I am telling you not to open the Empty because it will be the death of us all. You will not let Castiel and Dean out of the Empty, Sam Winchester.”
“Anna?” He gasps. He remembers when Michael (their universe Michael) killed her so long ago. Of course she ended up here, the waking grave of dead angels. There isn’t light, yet he can see her.
“I saw Azazel, but he was surrounded by this…. Force, that wasn’t evil, but it was angry. And then I watched him get eaten alive.” Sam glances at Dean, taking his brother’s shocked silence as motivation to continue. “And then, last night, I saw Metatron.” Dean tenses at the name, flexing his fists a few times. “It was the same. The Force, getting eaten alive. But then I saw-” Dean raises an eyebrow, and Jack beams. “I saw Cas.”
A month painfully passes. Dean’s not sure he can recognise the passage of time anymore. The sun rises. He might see Jack in the library, or maybe outside playing with Miracle. The sun sets. Sam takes Jack’s place, his nightowl tendencies honed by years of undergrad studying. It takes effort, but Dean forces himself to interact with them. He goes on long walks with Jack, listening to the kid excitedly fill him in on Star Wars lore while Miracle follows, panting happily. He notices Jack avoiding the produce isle at the grocery store, complaining when Sam fills a cart with healthy food. Occasionally, when the same nightmare of Cas in the Empty won’t leave him, Dean will find Jack in the kitchen, helping themself to Sam’s favoirte cereal. He’s already promised to not tell Sam, no matter how frustrated the guy looks. There aren’t many hunts, but Dean leaps at all of them. Sam and Jack let him go on them alone, always promising to be there if he needs help. Dean never does.
The simple truth is that, after all the sacrifice and torture and bullshit and long, lonely nights they suffered for each other, Dean isn’t ready. He can’t give himself fully to Castiel. Falling to his knees, Dean realizes he’ll be stuck here forever, cold and alone. He refuses to be vulnerable. The one thing that had kept him alive, or at least always coming back to life, was all the trauma he’d remolded into a metaphorical shield, keeping himself safe from whatever the world threw his way. Every experience, every hunt, every dreadful morning and long night reinforced that protective reaction. He’s never been an individual, but he’s not defenseless. Like a hollow suit of armor, displayed for others to show off wealth or age or prestige, Dean has a long history and grand reputation, but at the end of the day he’s just a single thing. Like a hollow suit of armor, polished by servants and employees, Dean reflectes whatever was in front of him: John’s alcoholism, Alastair’s torture, Purgatory’s instability, the Mark of Cain’s homicide, otherworld Michael’s contempt. Like a hollow suit of armor, Dean is useless.
Dean can’t stay still. He’s pacing, serving drinks, doing anything to keep himself busy. Cas is in the driver’s seat, but he’s in shotgun. No matter what the angel does, Dean can feel it. He knows Cas would never take him over, do something against his will, violate him like Michael-
“You know, when we beat Chuck, I thought this would be over,” Sam’s voice is tired. Dean looks up, so distracted by his own grief and worry that he hasn’t noticed Sam come by.
He knows he shouldn’t look up, but Dean Winchester is a glutton for punishment, and can’t help himself. It’s a shy gesture, barely locking eyes with everyone in the roadhouse. They’re not looking at him anymore, but they’re not *not* looking. Instead, they’re in poses, pretending like they’re not eavesdropping. Dean knows the posture well, he’s done it enough himself. There’s a kind of stiffness in the neck, muscles forced to both relax and tense up. He looks back down at his hands. The plate’s clean, but there's more to clean. There’s always more.
Anyone who knew him would say he’s a great ally. That’s not entirely true, since he doesn’t really identify as male, but there’s a whole other story. The thing that’s important is, he encourages his friends to find love. He’ll talk for hours with Charlie about other girls, he offered nothing less than total support when Jack changed their pronouns, and he doesn’t care when two men hold hands. He’s a good friend, and a good ally.
There’s a woman standing in the war room. Sam doesn’t recognise her. Silvery white hair in a close crop-cut hugs her scalp, and she wears a navy pant suit. Lines of age are etched into her face but it’s nothing compared to her eyes, which betray eons of age. She must be something supernatural, and he makes a list of all the threats strong enough to break into the bunker. Sam’s unsure which she is, and aims his gun at her chest.
Dean has never been so glad to be wrong. Castiel shoving him against the wall, a hand already over his mouth, just inches from the angel’s imploring, confident stare did so many things to Dean. When Cas, bless his innocent little heart, tried to comfort a prostitute, getting both him and Dean kicked out of Hell’s Angels (the irony went right over the actual angel’s head), Dean made good on his promise. He did not let his best friend die a virgin. Once again, he was waking up with another man in the same bed with no cosmic repercussions. He started to like the mornings after. What used to be a painful goodbye, sneaking out of a girl’s bathroom window without so much as a note, changed. Cas had one arm wrapped around Dean’s waist, his chest right up along Dean’s back.
It’s hard to remember Donatello used to be a professor. Technically speaking, almost every hunter had a life before the supernatural world broke through, demanding to be dealt with. There are a few exceptions, namely the Banes Twins and the Winchesters. Dean wonders, not for the first time, what his life would be like without hunting. The djinn claimed he’d be a mechanic. Zachariah showed him a world where he was a salesman. He used to want to be a fireman. Sometimes Sam talks about retiring. He always sounds wistful, as if finishing his law degree was the plot of his favorite fantasy book. Dean rarely allows himself to dream like that. The last time he did, it was when Cas asked.
“Castiel, you are my greatest failure,” she breathes, eyes wild. Heaven deteriorating hasn’t been kind to her vessel, but it’s still stronger than his own. The Leviathan Bite still aches, the pain spreading around his midsection and the handprint burn hasn’t let up. Naomi stabbed him in that shoulder, nailing him to the bunker floor. Her grip on his angel blade tightens, and her jaw sets in anger. “I’ve wanted to do this for a long time.”
“Promise me you’ll come back,” she whispers. Dean doesn’t say anything, just hums some nonanswer and continues to play with her hair. Eventually, Claire pulles back, sniffling hard. She won’t look him in the eye.
Dean barely has a second to himself between Jack and Donna. Miracle follows the Winchester, stopping momentarily to sniff the sheriff’s hand before running down the hallway. Donna beams at Dean. A weight’s been lifted off her chest since they last talked in the hallway. Not as bright as Jody’s, her ring still glares against the unnatural bunker lighting.
Dean turned, yanked out of his self pity by Claire’s voice. She sounded impatient, but also scared. Looking up, Dean saw her standing a few feet away, eyes locked on the ceiling. Her jaw was set in frustration, blinking back tears. Nervously, she tapped a foot, arms wrapped protectively around her waist. “Please?” she choked out, finally looking at Dean. Her eyes were puffy and her sharp, black wings smudged. Claire sniffled. He nodded, walking her to somewhere he knew they wouldn’t be interrupted. The teen gasped when Dean opened the door, but didn’t recoil from the room. Instead, she stared at the pentagram on the floor, and then directly up at the spot. The exact spot. Slowly, Claire raised a hand and caressed the bricks, breathing lightly.
“It’s me, Dean,” he promises, bringing a hand to rest on top of Dean’s. “And a few others. Something’s hunting us.” Cas’ voice turns serious, all the warmth in his initial greeting melting away. “We tried to fight it, but it didn’t stop. I think it hurt the Empty. Ever since, it’s been punishing us.”
“If you’re here to stop me from opening the Empty, why do you need Gabriel?” Maybe he can wrangle the archangel’s freedom out of this deal. Maybe he can slightly unfuck his life before he completely destroys it. Naomi cocks her head slightly, calm face faltering. The bunker lights flicker in perfect timing with her facade cracking.
Dean wakes. Castiel heals. No time passes. Dean relents. Castiel stands up. The lights still flash in warning. He’s in control of Dean’s body for the moment.
“Do you know what they saw?” Jack asks, getting their bearings first. A small pang of pride flutters in Sam’s chest. The kid’s a natural born hunter, with sharp instincts and a keen eye, even without their Nephilim powers.
He’s not doing too great himself. Castiel was his best friend. Sam had gotten used to seeing the angel in the bunker, a tired smile always pulling at his vessel’s lips. His absence physically hurts. But this isn’t the first time Sam’s has to wrestle with grief. He tries his best to move forward, using long morning runs to work out his anger when Jack can’t see.
“That’s your first question? And I thought Cassie was borning.” His joke earns no reaction. “Well, I saw you were calling up friends, so I decided to join the party.” He looks directly at Garth before saying “You’ve already let one dog in.”
Alex yawned, and asked to go to bed early. She did most of the driving that day. Sam showed her to a room, letting Kaia and Patience also go to sleep. It wasn’t late, but if the wayward sisters’ experience was anything like the Winchesters’, they’d be tired. Dean managed to talk Jack into hitting the hay early, promising to fill the kid in on any more details they discovered. Dean closed Jack’s bedroom door, heart pounding. He blinked back tears, trying to forget how much Jack’s enthusiasm paralleled Castiel’s. It wasn’t just his spirit. Dean found it hard to even think about Jack anymore, memories of Cas overwhelming him. Their walk, their eyes, their voice, their smile, the way they poured cereal in the morning, everything about Jack reminded Dean of Cas. Specifically, it reminded him of how Cas was gone.
“I need to show you something,” Cas whispers and that’s just not fair. Dean would do anything to keep this moment going. He doesn’t object when Cas steps back, takes his coat off, and then the tie, and starts unbuttoning his shirt-
“Booooring,” Gabriel taunts back. Dean and Donna look down just in time to see what had been Miracle shift into the archangel. Lying on his back, hands up in a simple surrender, with that signature shiteating grin, he keeps talking. “Who’s the lady?”
His arm burns, snapping Dean back to the present moment. Still looking down, he watches the sigil that’d been painted over the Mark of Cain peel off and fall to the floor. Cursing under his breath, Dean reaches for the paintbrush, ready to redo it, but pauses. A deep, yearning sensation floods his body.
“That’s good, Dean. You’re going to need more rest, but your body should be moving.” Oh, right. He’ll have to tell everyone in the Bunker what happened. The thought is daunting. “If you’re not ready, we can stay here. Right now, you’re asleep on the dungeon floor.” Dean thinks over his options. He’s not ready to rejoin the world of the living, but he can’t just stay passed out on the ground. Sam and Jack need him. Dean stares at Cas.
No answer. He’s been interrogated before. Hell, his whole life was an interrogation: Proving he’s good enough to be a hunter for his father. Proving he was normal enough to go to college. Proving he was good enough to save Dean. Proving he wasn’t the vessel of Satan like everyone insisted he was. He’s been on both sides of the table, both interrogator and interrogatee. The most damning thing a suspect can do is answer. Any answer is good enough to work with. So he remains quiet.
Castiel’s on his feet and running before he can process it. Muscle memory that isn’t his pushes him forwards, desperate to find his brother. Save Sammy. Protect your brother. By the time he rounds the corner to the war room, panic and anger have mixed into congealed rage in his stomach. He’s seeing red, and something on his forearm feels excited in a hauntingly familiar way.
“I love you, Dean Winchester,” Cas confesses. “And if that makes you uncomfortable I’ll leave and stay away, but it won’t change that I love you with my whole being.” Dean doesn’t wince at the word ‘love.’ He doesn’t. But it’s a bad word for him. It means pain is on the way.
“Are you sure?” He asks, voice soft. Dean nods, and then says something he would never admit to anyone else.
“That’s not the point,” Dean refutes, swallowing back his emotions. While it was easy for Dean to excuse Jack’s age when Chuck was a looming threat, this last month reinforced just how young the kid is. There’s a bright innocence behind their eyes that Dean remembers crushing in Sam. He sees it when Jack wants to play a board game as a family, draw in their room, or read with Sam. It’s the smallest moments, the ones Cas should be here for, that hurt the most. Jack discovered their favorite color (blue) and lost a tooth and decided they didn’t like carrots and a thousand other meaningless things that made them human. Castiel missed all of it.
“I can’t Sammy,” Dean sighs. The words are strangled in his throat. He will not cry again. “I can’t do it. Not without Cas-”
“You break into my house, attack my friends, and want to sit and chat? I don’t think so.” The woman smiles fondly.
They’re all talking, but it’s not to each other. Everyone’s splintered off into groups, discussing in hushed whispers what happened. No one has all the answers, and the stress that lingers between conversations is beginning to take on a body of its own. Sam’s looking at Dean uncertainty, probably trying to read his mind. He was never as sneaky as he thought. Dean’s not sure if it’s because he’s always looking at his younger brother- protect Sammy or die trying- or if it’s because Sam is the size of a horse and about as subtle as one, but Dean’s always aware of when Sam does this. There are times, after fights or hunts or deaths or anything major, really, when Sam looks at Dean when he thinks Dean can’t see. It’s not a bad habit, Dean had perfected looking at John when John didn’t know, but it’s annoying.
It’s a rush, his body expanding and contracting metaphysically to house all the nonhumans. Cas isn’t wrong, there were only a few, but each one hurt, a throbbing sensation gripping his whole body. When it’s over, Dean opens his eyes. All he sees is black. It’s not the same darkness as the rest of the Empty, this time it’s an all consuming color that let no light through. Something thick and cold streaks down his cheek. Something else, Dean assumes a finger, wipes it away. It smears across his face.
But then Sam died. His final steps, just like his first, were towards Dean. The whole charade was over. Sam was one of Azazel’s chosen few, but he didn’t make the cut. All the premonitions, powers, and pain were done with. Dean did his best to look out for Sam, to save him, but it wasn’t enough. He wasn’t even the one to kill him. Somehow, Dean had failed every order Dad had given him. Don’t tell Sam. Look out for your brother. Save him, and if you can’t- kill him. But he still had one option left.
“No it’s not,” Dean admits. “But it’s love.” Jack narrows their eyes. “It hurts to be left alone. My dad did so much for me, and when he was gone it felt like he’d taken some of me with him.” Jack nods. “I wondered for so long how someone could do that. But then-” Dean pauses, unsure how to say what he’s thinking.
Deciding he hated being alone, Dean opens his phone and replays Donatello’s message. His voice was frantic. The prophet usually sputtered and stuttered when he had a vision. The phone’s audio couldn’t convey it, but Dean knoww the guy well enough to infer he’s probably ecstatic, collecting his notes while he trying to speak. It’d been a few days since Dean last replayed the message. He closes his eyes, trying to focus on the words and not how much he misses Cas. The info is important. According to the prophet’s vision, there are a few thousand souls waiting to be taken. That much spectral energy won’t be a problem unless they don’t find a new Death in about a week. Donatello also saw a woman, in her mid thirties, with beautiful short hair and soft features that framed her stern appearance. Dean knows he meant Billie before the prophet explains she was the old Death. As the most recent reaper in the position, she’ll be the best person to take up the mantle again. The message ends abruptly, with the prophet explaining he has to get back to work grading papers.
He has about ten blissful minutes alone before being interrupted again. This time Jack and Miracle are at his door. Dean welcomes them in, worried when Miracle tries to lick where recently painted symbols lay on his arm. Jack shooes her away, before looking back at Dean.
Looking around, Dean realizes he was in the bunker- in his room. The door’s left slightly open, as if he’s been carried there. Probably Sam, Dean concludes. He groans. They’ll have to talk about this later. The clock by his bed flashes the time: Stupid Early. Deciding now was as good a time as any, Dean stumbles out of bed, struggling to put on something warm. He lumbers into the kitchen, finding the lights already on. Sam and Jack are sitting at the table, discussing something. Jack looks better, their skin no longer taunt and the black circles around their eyes completely gone. They shoot a goofy grin in Dean’s direction, alerting Sam to the new presence in the room. Miracle, who’d been resting on Sam’s foot, cheerily greets Dean with a woof, partially happy to see him, partially hoping for food.
“That’s not an interesting story. A friend of mine, sweet guy, is Muslim. He told me about it.” The buzzing of different machines throughout the bunker takes over the room. A gentle humming sound fills the silence between the two hunters. Dean shivers as the brush passes over a spot of particularly sensitive skin. He doesn’t like being exposed like this, vulnerable to the world, with all his scars showing. There are a few still healing, carving pink slashes through some of the sigils.
“By now you’ve figured out what I am?” she teases. In a flash of light, her wings spread out eight feet in either direction. They’re bare and burned (like all other angel wings after Metatron ejected the holy birds from heaven), but these look more healed. Castiel’s wings were singed and tender, but hers are magnificent to behold.
Navigating through the Empty is not about physical exertion. In a place with no limits, no ground, no distance, and no space, there’s no point to moving. The only way people exist in the Empty is as conscious thoughts. That means the only way to find others is to think about them so completely and wholeheartedly that the Empty mistakes you for them. Billie’s in Dean’s mind, sharing this secret with him. Slowly, Dean inhales a shaky breath. Cas has been consuming his thoughts ever since he died. Dean closes his eyes, thinking about the angel. When he opens them, he’s still alone.
“Fine. I’ll play along. But, at the end of this ride, someone stays. Take up to five people out of here, but one stays.” Dean nods. He makes shitty deals all the time. He’ll think of a way to worm out of this one, too.
“You can’t be gay!” were the first four. Followed by “I thought you were homophobic-” and then interrupted with “Ash? Really? *Ash?*” There were other questions. None of the “how to be a good ally” books mentioned interrogating the person, but Sam couldn’t help himself. There were too many contradictions. There was just no way Dean could be bisexual, and sleeping with Ash.
“I’ll be careful,” Dean responds. The sigils Rowena wrote out for him are complicated, and he’s already being careful not to screw any of them up. By the time he finally finishs the one on his palm, Patience is squinting at him. “I promise!” Dean adds, unsure of what she wants. He can’t know how much danger he’ll be in until he gets there. Patience sighs and leaves, muttering something about getting breakfast.
“Knock knock.” Eileen’s voice is gentle, carrying across the room the way a pie’s scent dances along the wind. Dean jumps, suddenly no longer physically alone. The brush in his hand stalls, the sigil on his stomach only half done. He starts it up again, praying Eileen hasn’t seen him so depressed. She crosses the room, grabbing the second brush Alicia left. There aren’t any more symbols needed on his back, but she finds a spot on his arm that’s woefully baren. Dean feels like an art project, something the whole bunker was contributing to, with or without his say so. At least people don’t expect a canvas to talk about its feelings.
“Jack is an abomination, like you. I wouldn’t let either of you interfere with Heaven, corrupting it for billions of innocents. And Amara? God sealed her away for a reason. They’re both disgraces on this planet, but that’s not why I’m here. Gabriel, even in his sorry state, is the best option we have.”
Folding back into his vessel, Castiel reconsiders his promise. He told Dean he wouldn’t hurt his body, but he doesn’t see this ending without a fight. Castiel’s a soldier, a master of the angel blade and a gifted fighter. But every surviving angel is too, and whomever’s powerful enough to trap an archangel is stronger than him. Dean’s aching side and burning shoulder come back, now that the angel’s settled in his body. It’s relatively quiet for a moment.
After a few glasses Dean dropped the rag he’s using to dry them. He can feel Cain’s eyes looking him up and down, resting on the Mark a few times.
“What’ll you do?” Dean asks, concern bleeding in his voice. Not that he fears the world being unprotected against Destruction incarnate, but rather he wonders how Amara would get on, unprotected and dangerous. Humans are social creatures, what the hell are gods?
“It first woke up when I did,” Cas ponderes, talking more to himself than Dean. “But it didn’t know how to go back to sleep either. I think if anyone is awake here, the Empty is forced awake.” In his mind, Billie nods. Cas’ voice is stronger now, and he looks Dean right in the eyes. “How do we get everyone here to sleep?”
“I’m tired, Cas,” Dean admits, reaching out to hold Castiel’s hand. It’s a small gesture, but Dean’s always said more through actions than words. He needs connection, to be heard, and that means feeling. He rolls on his back, looking up at the ceiling, and Cas mirrors his posture. It’s easier to speak openly when you’re talking to concrete. Concrete doesn’t talk back. But Dean keeps his hand on Castiel’s, gripping tightly, as if he’s scared Cas will leave again. It’s not like Cas has given him much reason to think otherwise- one of them’s always pulling away.
“Claire, Kaia, and Patience all had visions.” Sam, Jack, and Dean all share a confused breath. Patience having a vision isn’t newsworthy- the granddaughter of Missouri Mosely is a gifted psychic. In another way, it’s not too scary if Kaia has one either: she’s a dreamwalker, so it made sense for her to…  dreamwalk. But the two having visions on the same night? And Claire too? Suspicious.
“Unless you want to,” he offers with a playful smile. Claire laughs and shakes her head, walking into the room. She pulls Dean into a hug, pressing a shaky breath against his chest. Gently, he runs a hand through her hair, rocking her a few times.
“Sounds like you’ve really been through it,” Donna observes. “You know, love is a lot like life. Of course there’s risks, and pain, and jerks named Doug, but there’s also a lotta good stuff.” She smiles, thinking about some memory Dean wishes he could experience with her. “I never realized how good my life was until it was over. When Doug left me, I didn’t think I could feel happy again. But when I met Jody, things changed. She wasn’t happy, but she was working on it. Together, we worked on it. And now look at me.” Donna smirks. “Can I tell you a secret?” Dean nods. “I’m gonna propose tonight.” Her voice is downright giddy now. Miracle picks up on the hunter’s energy, thumping her tail against the ground. Dean laughs.
“Jack.” It’s not a request coming from her. Dean’s heard this voice before. It’s Amara’s “smartest person in the room” voice, where she holds all the answers and Dean is desperately ignorant. A part of him begs to know, but he dreads it. Winchesters don’t get to win. Jack looks up, smiling, arms still squeezing Castiel. They lock eyes with Billie, and wordlessly come to an understanding. Dean wants to think about what that could mean, but Benny’s pulling on his arm. Crowley’s already sneaking off, probably to join the group in the war room. Dean wants to follow, but Amara’s presence is too intoxicating to leave, and Benny’s already asking him questions.
Dean smells Gabriel before he sees the bastard. After his violent confrontation with Loki, the archangel wasn’t leaning as heavily into the Trickster persona he’d used for millennia. Even so, he still munches on candy, the sickly sweet scents announcing his presence in Dean’s room. The hunter rolls his eyes. This is getting ridiculous.
“We promised we’d never hurt each other,” she rephrases. Despite being billions of years old, she’s as fluent in coherent thoughts as a hormonal teenager. Dean picks up the conversational slack, answering her unstated, implicit questions. Why? How? What’s next?
“Where’s your brother?” the woman asks after a moment of silence. She pointedly looks around, before staring down Sam again. He shrugs. Last time he saw Dean was only a few minutes ago, but-
“Tell him what happened last night!” Jack encourages, either missing or ignoring how peeved their dads are. Sam mutters something that sounded something like “no you” before sighing. He’s not meeting Dean’s gaze. Jack turns to Dean, their enthusiasm only matched by Miracle’s.
“Let me take the others,” Dean bargains. Cas huffs, but eventually agrees. He raises a hand to Dean’s forehead. Dean glimpses a few of Cas’ veins, rainbow lines snaking along the blood vessels of his forearm. And then they start to move, rushing towards Dean.
Sam’s laid out on his back against the war room table. Nothing seems to be holding him down, but he’s squirming in place, desperate to escape. Above him is Naomi, her angel blade held just inches away from Sam’s eye. It’s dripping with blood.
The more he thought about it, Sam wasn’t mad at Dean. He started to piece together a few buried memories. And then, as he sat in the Roadhouse, tolerating Ash burping the title to every AC/DC song, he realized something. Dean was too good for Ash.
Billie doesn't respond, but Dean can feel her knowledge. There aren’t many people awake and kicking in the Empty. Really, it’s just the three of them (Billie, Dean, and Cas with everyone inside him), Metatron, and Dick Roman. Well, one of those is taken care of. Actually, his body housing Billie and himself doesn’t annoy the Empty. If anything, it intrigues it, and the Empty seemed to be more willing to negotiate with Dean than anyone else here. And then, as Dean Winchester is often to do, he gets a terrible idea.
The journey to the bunker, if it could even be called that, is strange. Sam takes over driving, and Jack’s passed out in the backseat with Miracle. Dean made it clear he wasn’t ready to talk, but he has too many thoughts in his head to listen to music. And so they drive in silence. It’s surreal, seeing pedestrians walk and chat and laugh and enjoy the world. Dean supposes it’s only weird for the Winchesters. The people on the street didn’t know what they’d lost. Didn’t know God erased them from existence just to play with his two favorite dolls. Didn’t know Castiel was lost to the void, cold and alone. Not for the first time, Dean wishes he could be one of those people, blissfully ignorant. Sighing deeply, he leans back in his seat, closes his eyes, and tries to sleep.
“What did you do?” he hisses, right as Cas asks for his help. Making sure the other freeloaders in his mind are locked away, Dean nods. He’s ready to take over his body again.
Sam learned the hard way there can be too much of a good thing. For the past twelve years, he’s had to suffer through their lovey dovey wordless bullshit. Everytime one of them gets hurt, the other complains and vents to Sam. Everytime one of them does something annoying, the other complains and vents to Sam. Everytime one of them does something impressive, the other gushes to Sam. He loves Castiel, his best friend, his brother, his angel. But he would happily set the bunker on fire if it meant Cas would stop telling him about all the ways Dean brings him pleasure.
“I did the same thing. And it hurt everyone around me, but I stand by it. Because I did it for Sam, and I’d do it for you. You’re my family, and I love you.” On Jack’s other side, Miracle whines, suddenly aware she’s not the center of attention. Floppily, she trudges to where Jack is resting on their dad, breathing slowly. Dean can feel how hard they’re holding back tears. Their chest is tight, as if breathing is painful. It probably is.
“Nah, you’re just as pretty as usual. In fact, this might be an upgrade.” Claire stands up, moving towards the door. “I’m leaving tomorrow. I should go pack,” she excuses, leaving.
Sam’s demon blood hasn’t acted up in years. To be honest, he’d assumed confessing before a priest and “curing” Crowley of his demon-ness had purified him. Or maybe the trials to close hell had, who knows? Either way, his sordid blood hadn’t been an issue, or even a factor in his life for a decade. But it boiled in his veins now, enraged at Naomi. Her very presence was insulting, her angelic arrogance rattling his mind. Just another thing he could think about later. Instead, he ignores the primal reaction, somehow appearing calm despite the loathing that thrives beneath it.
“What do you want,” he grumbles, refusing to look up. Maybe, if he finishes painting his body faster, he can avoid everyone he ever knew coming into his room and telling him something.
“I’m sorry about this,” she mutters, before beginning an enochian spell. Gabe crumples, falling to the floor and writhing in pain. Naomi’s voice doesn’t waver, still chanting an incantation that seems to only hurt archangels. Cas had warned Sam that Naomi was strong and duplicitous. She knew what the hunters were doing without being told. Is the Empty the only reason she’s here? Sam thinks about the others in danger, about Eileen and Donna’s helpless bodies on the floor, about the other hunters in the bunker (no doubt also put to sleep through magic), and about his kid. Jack. They were a nephilim, so probably not hurt by whatever Naomi did to the humans. But they’re also dangerous, and heaven seems intent on killing them more than anyone else Sam had met. He needs to keep Jack safe. Taking a few steps back, Sam begins muttering a prayer of his own.
“I take it you’ve never been to the Empty before. Here’s some advice: it’s a bitch.” Dean pretends like he’s not listening, but his ears are burning. “It hurts on levels you don’t even know you have. And worst of all, it can shape shift. If you don’t know what you’re doing, you’ll never get back out.”
The next two years were hard to explain. Dean and Cas barely interacted, both having their own problems to deal with. And when Cas betrayed him, Dean couldn’t explain why it hurt so much. As much as that stung, losing Cas in that stupid resovour was worse. On top of that, he lost Bobby. If it weren’t for Sam and his pathetically doey eyes, always looking at Dean with an unabashed admiration only a younger sibling could foster, he would’ve ended it all. He wanted so many things, but Cas was always the first one in his mind.
The word brings Dean back to the present. He’s still in the Empty, with Billie lurking in his brain. Leviathans are practically indestructible, and the last time he dealt with one, it led to one of the worst years of his life. Dean’s a hunter. Time to act like it.
“Tell him what you told me,” Jack prompts again, voice firmer. They have a small grin on their face, confidence shining through. Dean can’t look for too long. It’s the spitting image of Castiel’s shit-eating, cocky grin. Sam can stomach it, not as bothered by Cas’ death, and warily meets his kid’s eyes before sighing and finally spitting it out.
“Were you ever in Apocalypseworld?” Sam needs to know if he’s working with the real angel, or just another illusion. Has he talked to The Trickster himself since 2010? How long has Gabriel been tricking him?
The only advantage to being attacked in your own home is that you know the terrain. Everyone present (except Gabriel) has been in the bunker long enough to find their way to a weapon, stashed in secret, convenient places for this exact scenario. Sam knows of a few hidden passageways the Men of Letters created during the Spanish American War. Kevin and Garth found a few others, their supernatural senses noticing subtle indents in walls. Sam’s reluctant to leave Dean unguarded, but he’s got bigger problems. He glances at his brother just in time to see Dean’s body consumed by sentient black goo. For better or for worse, he’s in the Empty now. Swallowing his nerves, Sam steels himself. He’s a hunter: time to act like one.
“Show yourself you son of a bitch!” Dean taunts, echoes reverberating down the corridors. Both hunters are standing now, back to back, waiting. This isn’t the first time they’d gone up against something invisible.
For the next seven years, they continued the estranged dance. One of them was always pulling away for some reason, some grander purpose in life. In between the strife, Cas’ few months as a human, Dean’s summer as a demon, the Mark of Cain’s homicidal influence, Lucifer's occupation of Castiel’s body, Ishim’s threat to murder Dean, Dean’s awful two months after Jack’s birth (made infinitely worse by the blood bond), Michael’s ear shattering screaming in Dean’s brain, and their journey back to Purgatory, there were quieter moments. Dean wipes a tear away, remembering all the slow nights when they’d stay up late watching old westerns. Sometimes they drank coffee together, just enjoying each other’s company. At night, after particularly stressful hunts, Cas would rail Dean into next week, whispering soft reassurances into his neck.
“Ow,” Eileen mutters from her place on the floor. She’s already getting up, waking Donna and rubbing at her eyes. “What happened?” she asks, cocking her head to the side. Sam can’t help but smile. Human sounds float on the air as more friends wake up. Sam looks at Dean- no, Cas- again.
He doesn’t remember what he dreamt, just the feeling. He was cold. Scared. Dean tried to call out, but his voice didn’t work. Something was gnawing at him, a feeling of isolation and dread he couldn’t outrun. It was louder than Michael’s screaming, a constant threat that the archangel’s power would overtake him. But it was also quiet, eerily so. He wasn’t sure how long he stayed like that, just drowning in the hollow feeling. It came to an end, however, with the familiar agony of being torn apart and eaten alive.
“Besides all the monsters you don’t know, there’s the ones you do. Ruby, that abomination that manipulated you into starting the apocalypse. Dick Roman, who would’ve eaten all mankind if you didn’t stop him when you did. Billie, who wants to become God! Think about yourself, Sam. For once, take this moment to finally shut the door on hunting and monsters.” Sam shakes his head. All three of those “monsters” were his family’s mistakes. They’d handled them before, and they’ll handle them again.
“It’s good to see you, Sam.” Sam nods, face blank. He’s trying to forget everything he just saw, and blinks a few times.
