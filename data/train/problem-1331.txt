Oddly enough, it had never occurred to Sherlock that he should have felt guilty that John had finally chosen him over everything else, chosen him over his own child. He'd died twice for the man, wasn't he owed something in return?
He slips his hand onto John's balls and John tries not to clench his thighs together reflexively. "I told you. I'm not
"All meetings with more than ten people have been cancelled or turned into Skype ones, which you'd know if you bothered with your emails. You could still try my work phone when we're at work and all."
He knows fish anatomy, of course — he'd studied it as a part of his biology classes at school, and he had revised that knowledge last year to solve a case involving a sapphire ring and a decorative carp. He can tell apart the premaxilla from the maxilla and dentary bones, identify the brachiostegal rays and visualise the opercular, but he doesn't quite know how to–––
, the synonym for Vauxhall Cross, the MI6 headquarters. He wonders if Mycroft had made the call himself. Trying to decipher Angus' broken Scottish accent would prove a formidable exercise even for a master spook like Mycroft Holmes.
"I can't say I've ever prepared a cod for consumption," Sherlock admits. Perhaps John will find it flattering that his expertise is needed.
John snorts. "Be glad I wasn't a burglar. He'd have made away with all the valuables why you were doing… whatever this is." He looks amused in that fond way he does when he thinks Sherlock is doing something very sherlock-like. John's gaze sweeps around the room; even the television and the sofa have been covered with bits of paper, though the flatscreen is so narrow that some of them have wafted down. "New research project?"
Doctor Pichler's written statement had been brilliant in John's opinion. While she could not avoid explaining about Sherlock's struggles with depression and substance abuse, she had underlined how responsible and long-abstinent he has been in managing the latter, and how — save for the stress caused by events of late — he has never required time off work for uncontrolled mood disorders. Most importantly, however, she explained the key features of his ASD and how it has complicated his career, and the work they have done together to help him navigate his challenge areas. In the statement, she had not spared her compliments regarding Sherlock's progress, and John had found it easy to agree with her professional opinions. She had not made excuses for Sherlock, had not claimed that he should be treated more leniently than any physician being assessed by the GMC. What she'd done was demonstrate how many things about his ASD made him an extraordinarily
"The burning and the mask sounds like anaesthesia induction — some of the hypnotics can sting. That should be normal." You have no idea what cannulations they did awake and which ones he was spared from until he had been put under.
He is resolute not to think about John Watson. Even more resolutely he is pushing away all thoughts of John's breath on his skin and the way he'd felt as though they'd been absorbing each other, shifting from two individuals to something shaped like an
"That's very good, Mister Holmes. This may be a difficult time to stay sober; we have excellent support groups, and I can refer you to––"
The doorbell rings twice, making John cringe. Someone shouts 'Dr Watson' through the mail slot; it's the first time anyone has addressed John. The BBC documentary had included a conversation where it was revealed that they are a couple, so it's hardly surprising that the press knows who this heroic neurosurgeon lives
"These mitigating factors can include cooperation with the police and admission of guilt — Fairholme has done both, at least according to their press releases. We don't know if genuine remorse is something they'll be arguing since we don't have access to the case materials, but certainly, the key feature here will be what's known as
Sherlock looks at the heart emoji following the words and sighs. Generally speaking, such imagery annoys him — this one more than most. What is supposed to
John's expression sobers. "No. Are we back to this again? I'm listening because you're important to me. I'm not some saint with a charity project; I'm with you because I want to be. I love you because you're you instead of sitting around hoping you'd be different or wishing you didn't need a therapist. I needed one, too. Haven't we gone through all this?"
"That's how it works, Violet," John explains just as his father-in-law joins them at the table. "We do get upset sometimes when there's a tough case, but we can't get too emotionally involved all the time. We couldn't do our jobs if we did."
"There was something you said earlier at which my ears perked up," she says, "you said something about a normal life.
. He even thinks about the bad times, wonders what it had been like. There was the time when Sherlock had lived here briefly after being discharged from the rehab Mycroft had arranged for him after he'd parted ways with Victor, and that time mid-medical school. Sherlock never really speaks about such things; John had only learned about Victor when the man had appeared unexpectedly back in Sherlock's life —
She'd told him he wasn't in a cage and he should walk out of the office, down to the ground floor and then, if he was feeling up to it, he could come back with his excess restless energy spent.
If Sylvie had suffered a blood clot -type stroke, valuable time would have been lost in a delay before imaging and initiation of treatment to dissolve the clot. If any complex patient case is scrutinised enough, some delay or suboptimal conduct will always be found, because healthcare is performed by humans, and humans aren't perfect.
Some stars, when they reach the end of their celestial lives, diminish into white dwarves. I remember that this notion disturbed me as a child as I devoured countless books on science. I was much more pleased with the notion that some of them expanded into red giants and exploded into supernovas. Eventually, what remained was a black hole or a beautiful nebula. What is the point of it all, unless you can leave behind something beautiful and everlasting — or take everyone down with you in revenge if your life has been an endless line of adversity and suffering.
"That's up to him, really." John then realises that statement had sounded a tad dismissive. "I mean, if you think it's necessary and you can convince him it's necessary, then of course." He's tempted to ask again if Sherlock is okay, but the psychiatrist is right —
"Want to get a Sunday dinner reservation? We could take the earlier train back from Sussex?" John suggests.
Sherlock emerges, carding his fingers through his damp hair with a disgusted grunt. "I need my own products. That shampoo is like spreading napalm on my follicles."
your life. You held a heart once as a medical student, held it steady as instructed during an off-pump coronary bypass as the surgeon attached transplanted vessels into their destination.
"Let us move on to the matter of the other patient, then. I am still struggling to grasp what the issue was that you protested to your superior in terms of how the surgical complication was dealt with," the GMC rep comments.
Then, gathered around the bed, you wait. Andrew gives you a nod and you lean closer. "Sherlock? Are you awake?"
The surgeon he's just mentioned, Robert Corns, is a highly regarded British brain tumour expert. Gedeon Perneczky an outstandingly experienced and highly regarded star surgeon working in Vienna. Sherlock only knows them by reputation, so he doesn't know if declining such a risky case was typical of their practice. It was the fact that professor Zvi Ram, of Ichilov Clinic in Tel Aviv, had said no that had given Sherlock pause. Well, almost. Ram is a pioneer whose achievements Sherlock has kept a close watch on for years. He uses many surgical techniques Ram had pioneered. The patient's family had told Sherlock that, if he said no, too, they would go to professor Juha Hernesniemi, and damn it if Sherlock was going to lose a battle of surgical daring to such an old man.
"We'll have a sedation break after four hours if he's stable, see how that goes. He didn't have an angiography before the procedure, unlike the patients who come in for an elective valve replacement, so we used an imaging scheme yesterday on the CT to check whether his coronary arteries have calcified. We found none of that, thankfully."
The incident discussed in this chapter regarding Sherlock's prior run-in with the GMC is detailed in the very first story in the series (Grey Matters).
Two playthroughs of the solo parts and five cigarettes leave him so pleasantly drained that he ends up napping on the sofa. His dreams are a hellish maelstrom of John getting shot and bleeding out, random memories from medical school and snapshots from the worse parts of his years as a neurosurgical trainee. Somehow, John keeps popping up in these scenes to provide a scathing commentary on what choices Sherlock is making and how he is conducting himself.
Sherlock can't help the snort that escapes. "The Hippocratic Oath must be a burden on your bad days, I suppose."
Sherlock decides to try to imagine this is a holiday and not an exile of sorts. John will drag him out into the city, most likely to a restaurant and maybe to a museum or the cinema. It'll be good for him, especially since he hasn't had the energy to do those things on his own. It'll feel exhausting, but he'll do it just to see John enjoy himself.
"My breakfast inside a cranial burr hole damned well will be, yes, if you enforce that nonsense on me. Better give those cleaners a raise now, before they unionise."
"George was the one who wanted to keep Natch after I decided to go back to Cambridge," Sherlock tells him. "I don't know how he managed to put his foot down, but he did. I never asked him for much, but I did ask for his help with that."
At the edge of his visual field, John catches the tail end of a classic Sherlockian eyeroll. Octaplex is an expensive concentrate of clotting factors used to counter the effects of warfarin, a potent and very common anticoagulant drug.
Daring is what this case requires in troves. The anatomy involved demands that a surgeon twists and bends all of the commonly agreed-upon safety rules for combining surgery and angiography unless in an emergency. Sherlock knows that many surgeons would say no even
During that first week, John had not slept a wink. He'd been too afraid of waking up and no longer sensing Sherlock's presence in his head. He'd been alone for years and years after Harry died, and it had taken him quite a lot of processing and battling with himself to realise that being without such a connection as he'd shared with his sister was ultimately worse than taking the emotional risks involved in forging another such bond. If he lost Sherlock…
"I don't think anyone gets it, really," another female voice, one Sherlock does not recognise, points out, "they say love's blind but in Holmes' case that's not the issue — deaf is what it should be."
The nerve block catheter installation goes without a hitch once the ordeal of getting Sherlock to lie fully on one side, then another without dislodging anything is over and done with. The block kicks in fast, and even Sherlock's blood gases improve as the pain is no longer making him afraid of taking deep, proper breaths.
"Nothing you should concern yourself with," Sherlock says amicably, and doubles down to give Natch, the Holmes' dog, a scrath behind the ears.
"Oh, my poor son-in-law, having those throat issues again. Isn't there anything for it?" Violet demands while washing her hands.
Doctor Pichler puts away her pen and pad. "I just want to clarify–– what was the procedure you had, and how does it connect to the decision you and George made?"
"No, we can't," the woman wearing the anaesthesia nurse tabard says in a miserable tone and lifts a bit of the shredded shirt: more third-degree burns on that side.
"Because it hurts you, what people think, even when you pretend it doesn't. You dismiss the positive as not being evidence-based and take the negative as evidence that people shouldn't be bothered with you."
"Not the ones which I can tell must be just dreams. I just can't construct the sequence of events in my head. There's a lot of lost time. That's… disconcerting."
The front door makes a satisfying slam behind Sherlock before he strides away down the street, heading towards the place where he had last seen Wiggins. It would serve John right if he just went off and got high; sobriety obviously has no role in John's opinion of him. But as soon as that thought ricochets around his head, he groans. He can feel the anticipatory firing of his neurons, can imagine painfully well the ensuing dopamine rush.
"Thanks," John says hastily, and jogs across the blocked Denmark Hill road to the Maudsley main entrance. It's a historical psychiatric hospital still in use, now surrounded by various newer buildings.
John knows he has probably ruined any chance he ever had of getting Sherlock to eat this particular meal, but he'll sacrifice it for the sake of future nutrition.
"What is–– what is the situation now?" Sherlock asks. "You are speaking rather well. What about… what about walking? Or aprax––" he realises the word might not be something the man will recognise. "Do you have any trouble with moving your hands or with walking?"
Sherlock carries an armful of firewood into the house, and once he has the kitchen stove and the sitting room fireplace going, he digs out the note that had been in the plastic bag.
Violet is the first to reach the hall, anxious and tense as she stands waiting for the door to open. John goes to her, lays a palm on her mother-in-law's shoulder. Mycroft has stayed behind in the sitting room.
He's here to talk to you because the operation is over, and Sherlock has survived it. A hysterical grin splits your lips like a slash wound. You must look like a madman.
Victor hadn't wanted company, either. At least not Sherlock's company, not often. When he came by, he seemed to want to just exist within the confines of the same space when they weren't having sex instead of doing anything together. That night, when they'd ended up in bed for the first time, they'd been lying quietly afterwards, waiting for the sweat to cool off their naked bodies, when Victor had got a text. He evacuated his compact, muscular body off the mattress with the efficiency of someone who's used to rude awakenings and began pulling clothing items on in the manner of a man who never picks them out based on looks, just functionality. Sherlock watched him, rapt fascination with the visuals flirting with disappointment and unease. He hadn't known what to expect after sex, not with Victor. He should have known there wouldn't be anything resembling cuddling, and especially not any discussion of what they'd just done. He didn't know Victor well enough yet for such predictions, and he comforted himself with the fact that whenever his occasional one-night companions had got emotional or clingy afterwards, he'd felt trapped and sickened. Victor is the only one with whom he had ever hoped for something like that.
"I have secured one, and I have been informed that she is outstanding in these matters. Have you got a pen and paper or shall I email you the details?"
"Don't–– tease––" John groans as Sherlock keeps his grip just so that the pressure won't recede, but won't build, either.
John walks in, holding the soft pink brush he uses on our daughter and some soft, yellow hairbands. It appears Tiny Watson has escaped the clutches of her hairdresser as usual.
"I'm still not sure it was even bacterial. I know I should have gone to have the cultures done, but it always just comes back with Strep so Occy Health agreed to just write me up with the penicillin. I'm fine; it was just a long day."
"It's not her job to have any particular sympathy towards doctors. Most people who don't work in healthcare are likelier to sympathise with a patient than a doctor."
"We'll take good care of him, John," Leah says, looking at you intently. "This is always tough on family, too. Partners, in particular." Her words are pointed but somehow tentative, as though testing a theory.
Suddenly, he feels anxious beyond words. He longed for the truth, but now he doesn't want it. He feels as though the shadows in the corners of the room are suddenly John's ghosts trying to trap him, too, in their clutches. He's an intruder here, and the more he finds out about John Watson, the less he understands.
"I have considered this. Undoubtedly, I will stand out by default since inevitably, same-sex partners will be a minority, if not a rarity. But John did not conceal our male-male partnership when he was in Afghanistan, even tacked up photos of us in his office. I'm sure he did not exactly advertise it, but… This will be different, of course; at Sandhurst, the focus will be on people and not on surviving a war. But he's still a decorated Captain-rank officer. I am not expecting to face overt bigotry, and I wouldn't lose sleep over some idiot commenting on the topic."
"You'll be gone in a week or whatever, won't you? I thought that maybe someone had actually bought the house and would live there, but when you came here without even a pot to piss in, it's–– it's the same as always," John slurs.
Everywhere he looks, the place is screaming out for repairs, for maintenance, for renovations updating it to the new millennium. Perhaps such things have been left undone because of a fear that any such operation would draw attention to who might own the place.
"Even so, you're afraid of what sort of picture the press might paint once this thing goes forward in the courts. That's why you're so upset. You can't even entertain the possibility that they might be right."
"You want to talk?" John asks tiredly, probably having decided there is no sleep to be had before Sherlock will stop acting like the restless ghost that he is these days.
After the miserable, bouncy and wet ride to the mainland, they board a train at Wick bound for Inverness. Sherlock’s minders keep to themselves, directing him into a private compartment. There, he watches the streaks of rain weep down the window and imagines the goodbye he didn't have the courage to undertake.
On his features you see a shadow of the smirks he reserves just for you, but it's something. It's a start. He's not cast adrift, but there is someone on the shore, holding the rope just so that he can be pulled back to safety.
This is what the administrative personnel do know: when a gunman entered the neurosurgical theatre unit, there were ten staff members inside. Two barricaded themselves into the recovery room with an afternoon patient still resting there. The rest were operating on a lumbar disc prolapse, and they are still in theatre with the suspect, who is armed with a pistol.
"It's a lot," you offer, wondering if he's cold. He could put the pyjama top back on if he wanted, but he remains lying on his side, hands lax beside. "It's a lot to take in," you continue, hoping that he'll take the bait, that he'll talk to you. You're hoping that you won't have to navigate the usual maze of his non-communication, wouldn't have to hope to find treasure at the centre instead of some monstrous trauma you don't want to awaken inadvertently. There's no time. You have to deal with this now.
"What?" Sherlock Holmes asks, piercing eyes suddenly locking at John. He closes the book with a muted thud, and dust puffs out of it. "Useless," he mutters.
Sherlock emerges from the bathroom some thirty minutes later, hair still damp but smelling of product. John had turned on the telly to have something to do while he waits, and the sports scores have caught his attention. He expects Sherlock to march right down to the remote and switch it off; instead, he just slips onto a chair.
Violet is frozen on the spot by a rose trellis on the side of the house, hand covering her mouth in horror.
From where he was draped over the couch with the hems of his Derek Rose dressing gown flowing over the edge of the seat cushion, he could hear his brother stirring his tea as though he was playing a Tibetan singing bowl. The dressing gown had been a gift from Mycroft the last time Sherlock had agreed to assist him with something. This time, he wanted Sherlock to help find out who was sharing classified MI6 information with MI5. Why two government agencies talking to each other for a chance was a problem warranting a hush-hush operation involving a rogue little brother, Sherlock couldn't fathom. Mycroft probably had decided that it threatened his power position within the fabric of British intelligence.
"You seem angry, Doctor Holmes. Does it not give you pause that a member of the public was so aggravated, so shocked by your decision-making that they sought answers in the manner Mr Fairholme did?"
Sherlock has been trying and failing to leave the flat for Great Ormond Street Hospital for an hour. When John hears footsteps ascending back up the stairs once again, he wrenches himself off the sofa, grabs the laptop which he's certain is the next item his husband the scatterbrain has forgot. He goes to meet Sherlock in the upstairs landing with it.
Marie's mouth pinches into a line, and she taps her watch — an item she shouldn't be wearing according to NHS hygiene rules.
Here you finally have the reason for the denial — Sherlock fears going through with rehab and the rest of his recovery, because he fears it'll bring him face to face with what permanent consequences might be left after he's done his best to get back to normal. His physical infirmity remains severe, and there's a long way to go, but he's healthy, fit — at least once he starts sleeping again — and there's no reason why he couldn't achieve a very high fitness level with the new valve. But all that would be a lot even if he wasn't worried about microscopic clots and bleeds in his brain, of brain cells blinking out like white dwarf stars in the cosmos of his genius.
"I have my phone for entertainment, but I’ll probably sleep now that the bloody pain’s not waking me up every half an hour."
At half-past eleven he gives in to the compulsion to call the ward. Sherlock compels the nurse to go check on him
"I was to accept a mentor who would shadow my patient interactions and advise me on proper conduct. After a mentoring period of six months, I was to give a report to the Council for improvements made, complete with 360-degree feedback from patients and their family members, colleagues and other healthcare staff."
to motivate the team to play along with this madness. There's already noradrenaline being infused at fifty millilitres an hour and the ephedrine boluses given to complement it don't seem to be doing much.
When big brother had asked about Scotland, Sherlock couldn't tell if it was truly to acquire data or to confirm established suspicions.
Sherlock skulks back in, too, on the trail of the now funereal procession. "We should at least…" he trails out, biting his lip. He looks distant, attention fixed on the dying young woman on the trolley. "We need to try," he pleads John.
"Well, there's also the fact that I like to see my patients doing well. Satisfaction of a job well done et cetera."
George clears his throat. "Shall we head off to The Five Bells for lunch tomorrow, spare Vi from cooking all that on the side everything she's doing for the garden party?"
"So what?" Christian grunts, pulling out but letting his cock press firmly against Sherlock's bottom. "You okay? Can I––"
Sherlock suddenly finds himself quite tongue-tied. John is looking at him expectantly, thumb sweeping firmly on the skin covering his flexor carpi radialis muscle. John knows not to touch him too gently.
"I have always kept on top of current research. He is my only brother," Mycroft comments indignantly. "And may I remind you that he
He calls Lestrade, makes sure there's nothing he's needed for. They have found a replacement anaesthetist for the rest of the case.
"How would you go about it if I were? Dangle it from a string tied to the windowsill? Lock it in your gun box? Shove it behind the toilet seat?"
The security guard standing by the doors leads the straggle of strangers outside. Presumably some of them are journalists. John looks very reluctant to extract himself from his chair in the tribunal room.
"The benefit of the Trust, and your career," the legal counsel says bluntly. "The Trust has a vested interest in the latter. I must say that surgeons don't tend to volunteer to be gluttons for punishment, especially when there is a logical alternate explanation for an error." She glances at Lestrade, perhaps hoping for backup.
"Plus there's the cost," you point out, "and safety — electric cardioversion is very safe, except if the patient hasn't been nil-by-mouth or has a difficult airway. Much fewer side effects than drugs."
. At this point, Sherlock has no idea where this conversation is going, and very likely dreads that he'll be pushed to put words to things he finds inordinately difficult to voice.
He hates being surprised like this when it's not about a case, hates such traps being sprung under him. He has no idea what to say except to ask for more information. "How?" he demands.
. He'd felt equally useless at Bastion and then after when John had spiralled into depression. Every attempt of his to defuse the tension in the flat had detonated things between them. The Dengue when they were out in Malosa had terrified him but it had been different; it would be
"I think you're the one worrying. Your viral load is unmeasurably low; you're on your meds like clockwork. My risk would be negligible even without prep, but I'll take it so that you don't have to worry."
"Not really. He's recovering, but…" You sigh, watching how his breathing deepens. His position looks uncomfortable; he'll have a crick in his neck in the morning. You need to wake him up and get him to bed.
You don't need to wait for Mike to make the diagnosis. The minute the monitor's graph comes to life once Sherlock has a neat row of electrodes on his chest, you see the telltale narrow, irregular QRS complexes surrounded by erratic, static-like P-waves which signal chaotic, fibrillating atrial function.
. This is how Sherlock had explained it to the man whose cranium he is now sawing open. Jane is directing a steady, small jet of saline into the spot to prevent the saw from heating the bone too much.
“That's a pretty casual dress code for a rep. What would a rep even be doing skulking around these parts?”
"I also believe that John has worked hard and that together you have repaired your relationship. He has not denied those things that hurt you — I suspect
As you wait, you watch Marston as he glares at the Met officers, most of all Lestrade who's reading him his rights. The man in cuffs doesn't look
He forces himself to fix his gaze in the middle distance instead of his notes. "I've been told I have constructed an admirable career in my chosen field, but my academic achievements are merely notes in the margin of why I am here today."
," he coos. "Is John in? He told me pop in so he could have a look at this." He shoves up his wax coat and jumper sleeve to show her the bandage.
"We don't often use restraints, but that was––" the nurse then starts with a warning tone, glancing at you as he works.
to the store, but I must have been distracted." Sherlock slams the fridge door and opens a cupboard. "Damned biscuits." He takes out a green Waitrose tin, sticks his nose into it. "It appears we really do have none." He sounds genuinely apologetic as he shoves the tin back, closes the cupboard and turns to lean his bottom against it, watching John expectantly.
That is what he now determinedly reiterates to himself while shaving. Sometimes, when John has been very exasperated or angry at his reticence for socialising, John has told him that he just needs to try harder. Sherlock knows better than to try to summon positive feelings out of thin air, but he has at least made a vow to focus on John and not his own uncertainties and doubts and fears during this weekend. There are plans in place, and Sherlock knows what to expect because he's interrogated John about all the minutiae. Sherlock detests rapid changes of plans unless they involve medical decision-making at work. There, he likes testing his skills by having to improvise within the rules of clinical medicine. At home and when dealing with people socially, he needs a framework. He needs to know what's going to happen and what is expected of him.
You glare at him though you like him. You're not a cardiologist. You want it spelled out, too. "It's been a while since my A&E days. What's the verdict?"
"Sounds good." John grits his teeth. He wants even more desperately to cross the expanse of the bed, wants to reach out. Instead, he thinks about the double bolt locks on the front door and the back door.
"We shouldn't get ahead of ourselves, John," Joanna reminds him, "but yes, I would say he is at a high risk of prolonged symptoms. Another major risk factor in this case may be the personal connection to the perpetrator, especially if a sense of personal blame develops. There is also survivor's guilt, which can be a debilitating symptom even in individuals who had no causality at all to what happened to them or to others."
"As evident in the suddenly risen pitch in your voice, the quaver in your lip and your sudden loss of eloquence."
medical mistakes are preventable? No. Do I think every trainee needs to make mistakes and learn from them? Not as such. It is the duty of their seniors to help them prevent as many mishaps as possible."
It takes him two more days to pluck up the courage to call John. Forty-eight hours of smoking, pacing and spraining his brain trying to come up with the right words to explain himself have resulted in nothing but frustration and finally, he realises he'll just have to improvise. It's a landline number so Sherlock has the benefit of surprise on his side. John won't know who's calling, increasing the odds that he’ll answer.
," Sherlock suddenly says, springs to his feet and disappears in the direction of his bedroom. John hears a thump and a shuffle before Sherlock returns.
"Tell him… he deserves more. Whatever happened to him before… regardless of why he thinks he needs to punish himself, he deserves more."
He texts John goodnight because he can't have his husband waking up thinking Sherlock hasn't spared a single thought to his well-being during the night. Only after he clicks
They're not in the kitchen, and John stops putting things out from a cabinet to frown at him. "After we get back, of course."
John has shifted on the front bench so that he's facing the horizon instead of Sherlock. It's obvious he doesn't want to discuss this further.
He breathes out; focusing on the conversation seems to have at least made him stop watching the monitors and the infusers like a hawk on Ritalin.
to eat. What makes matters worse is that it exacerbates his heartburn instead of lessening it, which is illogical.
Perhaps she hadn't always predicted a failure rather than the eternal, draining uphill climb he has chosen and experienced. Curse his ambition, stubbornness and intellect for not being able to contend himself with village life, some menial profession and a few hobbies. He could have kept bees, busied himself in observing and cataloguing their lives. He could have been an academic, even, in chemistry or biology at some lesser-known university within a reasonable commute from how. That would have shielded him from the social conflicts of clinical work.
"I remember that." It had been a big enough kerfuffle with a lawyer involved that it was noted in Sherlock's personnel file. The spinal surgery had turned into a court case but Sherlock had only acted as a witness because the gist of the issue was whether the first surgery had been done correctly. No one had faulted his conduct in any way back then, but of course the court proceedings have been mentioned in his file since he'd needed a leave of absence for the long-winded trial.
that it wasn't my fault that I got shot and there's nothing embarrassing about it, but you know how they look at colleagues at work who have to leave their positions for whatever reason? The sort of pity and I'm-glad-it-wasn't me?"
"What was that about?" John asks, putting the printed medical records on the kitchen table. He goes to get the brewed mugs of tea and offers one to Holmes.
The car ride was followed by a sleeper train compartment in the company of a broody, walk-in-fridge -sized agent as Sherlock's pretend-I-don't-know-you berthmate, then another tediously predictable black car. Finally, he was ordered to stand on a wind-beaten pier while being strapped into a life vest by an agent, as though Sherlock was some toddler in dungarees incapable of executing such a simple task without unremitting oversight. Then came the RIB that bounced him violently towards what he deduced would be one of the Orkney islands. Knuckles white, he had squeezed the safety rope on the rounded side of the large-for-its-type army vessel. Particularly spirited waves sent the boat airborne several times, and the camo-textured cagoule which he'd been supplied with had not prevented his trousers and socks from getting wet. It speaks volumes about how tight intelligence service budgets are that they'd even confiscated the garment before dumping him on the shore.
––" Sherlock starts arguing as expected, but then coughs and gasps, eyes pinching shut. A trickle of blood runs down the inside of one of the drains — not an alarming amount and probably caused by the coughing raising intrathoracic pressure, but it's still blood. When Sherlock opens his eyes again, he's left staring at the drain, alarmed.
If I could tell him about the diagnosis, can't I tell him everything, anything? Why is it this thing, this minuscule thing, this virus, that would bring forth such a sudden honesty?
She doesn't even attempt to conceal her surprise. "What? Why?" Her first thought is that she'd crossed a line, somehow, in asking to contact his partner when they'd last spoken. Once he'd got over his initial skittishness he’d seemed relieved at the suggestion. At least that’s how Joanna had read it.
Silence reigns. Their eyes do not meet, but John doesn't physically recoil from the question. His taciturnity must be the best answer Sherlock's going to get, then. He tries to contend with it, but still feels that nagging pull of curiosity that's always been his vice. He knows he cannot tear down the shroud John hides his secrets under, but he still itches to try.
. John is forced to slam the breaks when a bike messenger cuts across the lane, and he releases a string of expletives. Adrenaline tingles in his fingers, but when he glances at Sherlock, the man doesn't even seem to have noticed what had just happened.
"Sometimes I think he wouldn't tell us anything unless his husband prompted him to do so. My son-in-law is such a Godsend." Violet smoothes down a crease in her dove-grey pencil skirt. "He thinks I said no because it was a gynaecological matter — that I was embarrassed. If that's what he needs to believe, so be it."
Violet had come here with a purpose, yet now, she finds herself rather tongue-tied. How does one segue into such personal matters with a near-stranger? How on
Standing at the front door, Sherlock hesitates to push the key into the lock. Indecision has become a fog through which he's trying to push whatever he does. Stopping to consider even for a second if he even cares what happens in the next few seconds, minutes or hours shoves him back to the start, and he's now made that mistake regarding the weekend.
He puts the instruments on the tray, takes a steps back and stretches his neck. The theatre is silent — someone had cut the music the moment they realised there was an emergency. His whirling thoughts isolate him from the world as he waits for his superior. There's the
"Routinely given to all cardiac surgery patients since we often have to do some unpleasant cannulations while they're still awake, particularly if it's an emergency case such as yours. What you were given was a benzodiazepine — do you believe you have a tolerance for those?"
Sherlock is aware the Scots call churches "kirks" and, considering the heavy Viking influence on these lands, he's not surprised to find the term here, too. There are similar words in modern Nordic languages. "Do you?"
He's just so tired. He's tired of thinking, tired of trying not to think. Tired of being too much and not enough at the same time.
Yesterday, he'd felt emboldened to ask some more personal questions from John in the car on their way back from Pierowall. He always answered, but succinctly, and Sherlock could sense the occasional hesitation even though he's rarely very good at reading people. Hesitation over the oddest things. John had volunteered the fact that he'd inherited the house from his father, but had skirted around the issues of when he had moved here. When asked, he'd admitted to having a sister, but had said nothing more on the issue even when Sherlock had volunteered some assorted gripings about his own singular sibling.
The day he's discharged, he can't settle anywhere; he follows you around to the point of exhaustion, touching items but not picking them up, getting food from the fridge and not eating it. He's aimless, haunted, and you can't come up with a single damned thing you could do or say to help save from yelling at him to sit down. It won't help, so you let him wander. Recovering from getting helped up the stairs had momentarily wrung him dry, so he'd accepted a lie-down and a cup of tea initially, but by the time the sun sets on the day of his discharge, you start to feel like you're watching a newly captured zoo animal.
of him, and accepts it, warts and all. You know she's seen Sherlock at his worst; hints picked up from conversation and from Mycroft have helped put together a rickety puzzle of the life Sherlock had been leading when he'd wound up in Florida.
"No, no, I don't want to impose on your breakfast; I know free weekends must be a luxury for you two."
"John's surgery has still put you in a carer's role again, a role you have told me you find extraordinarily difficult. As a child, you were told you were the object of assistance and support and in constant need of them, incapable of providing such things for others. It's logical that a reversal of that belief would be difficult for you to negotiate."
After Sherlock has taken off his coat and felt oddly exposed while slipping on the T-shirt under John's watchful gaze, John grabs an orange-and-blue tartan throw from a worn sofa in the sitting room and tosses it at Sherlock. "Have a kip. I still need to gut the fish."
You notice that his bare ankles, revealed by the short bathrobe, are not swollen, thankfully. "Any shortness of breath?"
"I am merely guaranteeing that the Commonwealth can sleep easy," the senior spook comments dryly, then pours himself a glass of water. "In case you are interested in the rest of the results: all normal — for the likes of us, I should add."
In Sherlock's estimation, he looks relaxed and seems to be in a good mood. John gives him a wet, five-o'clock-shadow-raspy peck on the cheek, which Sherlock must rub at to make the irritating aftersensation to go away. John chuckles at his likely indignant expression.
"Yes, they are, in these kinds of circumstances. John, with your permission, I'd like to admit you, order a preoperative CT to find out where the margins of the abscesses are, and let the OR team know. When have you last eaten?"
And they don't even have all the facts. John does, and since he's always channelled fear into anger, his guts are churning with it. Sherlock does struggle with bedside manner. He's had issues in his past which could easily make an MPTS trial question his current state of mind and integrity.
"Did you read Greg's email?" John asks when they reach the front door. "It doesn't sound like you did anything wrong."
Timothy pries open the patient's eyes. The pupils are blown wide despite the administration of opioids, and all of the emergency measures to control the swelling. John grabs a pair of gloves and leans down to brush aside the singed remains of the patient's hair so that he can peer into the head would. Brain matter is bulging out, and capillaries at the surface of it are bursting and bleeding. "I guess the burns made it pretty much impossible to do much about the sodium balance."
"I know better than most people do to avoid making any generalisations about autistic individuals. Yet, others assume they have a right to do so. Some of those prejudices are harmless, some very insulting and deeply unfair. Sometimes I am able to hide what I am like so well that others dismiss my difficulties as acting out, being difficult for difficulty's sake or for having other, worse diagnoses. I believe
Sherlock's need for proper companionship from John is not being met. It isn't about sex — although sex could certainly help in convincing his brain that nothing is wrong. No, Sherlock is certain that his continuing anxiety must be more a question of John being physically present in the flat but not at all engaged with Sherlock in any meaningful way. Recovery seems to mean being totally inwardly focused this time; when John had come home from Afghanistan, it had been the opposite. He was on Sherlock's case all the time, then, hounding and berating. Their level of interaction now is even odder, and it leaves Sherlock feeling useless and achingly lonely. Why does he keep thinking back to the time when John was recovering from his shoulder wound, how he retreated from intimacy and contact, and how that pushed their relationship onto the rocks? The disaster with the halo put even more strain on their marriage, and those months are not something Sherlock would willingly revisit. That time period seems to have cemented some fears in him that he should never take for granted all the progress they've made in their marriage, because he could always mess things up badly enough to lose John. Still, it was very different to what's going on now, so why would Sherlock's brain bother with all that?
Collings yawns. "Everything went alright. The next few days will be tough, but we got this sorted at the right time."
"My relationship with my parents regarding my upbringing remains complicated. They did, however, recognise my academic talents, and nurtured them, seeking to provide me with the best education possible even if they were not, for a long time, supportive of my dream to be a physician.
"Good. Don't forget your trousers when they arrive," Joanna teases gently. "I can see reflected in that wardrobe door mirror that you're only wearing one third of a suit."
', but John has noticed that, whatever he does with all those products is done after a shower, not in it, and the water's still running.
You're hesitant to leave Sherlock alone with the cooling embers of the fire you had going earlier, but since he barely acknowledges your existence these days, it's a guilt-ridden relief to be alone in your bedroom every night.
"I assume you made that opinion known," Sherlock says, his lip quirking up. His mother is not known for her diplomacy.
"I don't talk about it," John says, "haven't talked about it, I mean, because there's nothing to talk about. Talking won’t change anything, can’t change what happened."
The therapist starts asks him questions he can answer with just a nod or a shake of his head. No, nothing significant has happened at home. No, there hasn't been anything particularly challenging going on at work. No, he's not argued with John. Having to analyse these things seems to defog some of Sherlock's thinking, and he manages to square his shoulders and look directly at Doctor Pichler.
His phone rings, and he flinches. Moves not a muscle to retrieve the phone. Nobody calls him except Lestrade and Mycroft.
How is it that she has such a talent for seeing through Sherlock so easily when you so often reach only the surface level?
, so he pushes John's hand away and scrambles to the edge of the bed. Planting his feet on the carpet, he feels deflated, disappointed. Numb. He buries his face in his hands, still breathing hard.
Sherlock cannot quite grasp the connection between the EU and hunting, but he'll take Angus' word for it. That shotgun hadn’t looked well-maintained, so it's probably best that Angus keeps it just as a decorative item. He wonders what animals besides fish live here that one might hunt.
"Excision of a bilaterally extending frontoparietal oligodendroglioma," Sherlock spiels off, then quirks up a lip underneath his surgical mask before continuing gleefully, "On a
He remembers two prior periods like this in his career. The one before this had happened at the National after Andreason died. The way it left him adrift, at the mercy of the wolves that were his colleagues, hell bent on taking back what they believed the legendary senior surgeon's favouritism towards Sherlock had deprived them of, and for putting him in his place in the process. It was medical school all over again–– no, it was the
"Oi!" John protests and gives Sherlock a playful smack on the bottom. "God, that's even bonier than before. Could cut myself by slapping that. What's for lunch?"
!" he says, pointing at John. "Sometimes life does provide most convenient coincidences, though I don't really
"It appears that my particular tragedy is that I cannot be without insulin, nor can I inject it in a manner that wouldn't cause a constant risk of mild hypo. Since I'm accustomed to that, symptoms can be deceptively mild."
"Coming right up, John," a nurse without a tabard informs him, and sidesteps around him to connect an infuser pump into the central line.
You realise you always expect him to be above it all, just like he seems convinced that no mortal problems should affect him. He's tricked even you in to believing he has superhuman strength and intelligence, which can resolve any problem in a second. Mycroft sees past all that and you should, too. It just disturbs you too much to see someone so full of life first at the brink of death and then in this state. The very thought is alien, because this is not Sherlock. This doesn't happen to Sherlock.
, John tells himself sternly. It's enough that Sherlock has to live with all these worries — John can't start caving in under the weight, too.
"We could hardly allow you to find out about Victor's marital status at a church service and make a scene. It appears that your attempts to signalling to Victor that, like him, you wanted to keep things casual, were more successful than you really wanted. Why tell you the truth about a wife if it was never going to amount to anything beneficial? If he wanted to leave her for you, he had ample time to do just that."
"I know it is." When he'd been in a halo vest, John had been… John had helped him. John had looked after him, hadn't he, even when he had been going through so many difficult things himself? Sherlock was in no state to support him because he was struggling, too. What excuse does he have now?
Sherlock leaves the en suite bathroom for his spacious guest bedroom. He'd originally planned on just a pair of jeans and long-sleeved T-shirt but decides to choose a jumper over a white dress shirt. John had gifted him with an emerald one two Christmases ago, saying it had reminded him of Sherlock's eyes. It's a disastrous shade for Sherlock's complexion, which the stylistically very clueless John had of course neglected to take into account, but sentiment shall triumph tonight over sartorial perfection.
He can hear pots and pans clattering in the kitchen as well as the radio which often serves as the background noise to his mother's cooking. His father is out; Sherlock has a faint recollection that he was supposed to help with the booth construction at Walstead House. Violet probably thinks Sherlock should come downstairs and waste time on small talk, Sherlock doesn't have anything he would want to discuss with her. As a teenager, he often shut her out when she was being irritating.
John wonders. Sherlock had resisted acquiring them for some time, but now that he's got used to them he finds it abhorrent to have to read — especially from a screen — without them.
John looks slightly panicked, now — scrambling to find the right words. "It's just not like you to want backup, not even after a difficult spot. Maybe that's what's worrying Greg and I, not the fact that you might have made a mistake."
"Evening," Sherlock says brightly. "Biscuit?" he opens the bag and points the mouth of it towards the door.
Footsteps recede behind him. Wind howls in the rafters, rain is beating against the door. Sherlock calls out John's name but there is no answer, just a momentary change in the shadows in the kitchen around the corner that’s lit only by the glow of the embers in the hearth. John is there, but he's silent and restless and in retreat, and it is then that Sherlock realises he has become an unwelcome guest.
John stares — and bursts out laughing. After taking a moment to assess whether his ego is bruised enough to warrant a pout, Sherlock finds himself joining in.
John tenses. He doesn’t like what that suggests."What does that mean?" He asks. It's easier to talk in the dark. This is the most frank conversation he's ever had about sex. With his changing rota of partners, it has always been more about doing than talking.
The list of symptoms is a constant mantra in your head: haemoptysis, dyspnoea, peripheral oedema, chest pain, tachycardia, hypotension.
Right now, Sherlock doesn't look like a terror. Instead, he's biting his lip, looking unsure and anxious. "I am
Violet laughs, and Sherlock is startled by it. For the duration of his life, her micromanagement has always led to arguments when he finds it insulting to his intellect and lets her hear it. Now, something almost resembling self-awareness has crept into the way Violet feels compelled to supervise what he does. She has even begun to back away before needing to resort to spluttering self-defence attempts consisting of declaring that she's only thinking of his best. He doesn't feel quite as threatened by her anymore. Against the backdrop of their hideous past relationship, that is quite something. Perhaps one day he might even admit to the two of them sharing a trait: the impulse to control things that make him uneasy by trying to manage every detail, especially those that rely on the actions of others. Pichler has called him out on that many times; the latest was when they'd discussed his new suit before the Sandhurst trip that never happened. The suit hadn't looked too shabby today, and the looser fit had allowed him to slip a vest John had left behind underneath his dress shirt because he'd suspected it might be cold in the country house. He'd been right.
The patient, Mr Zezelj, is brought out of sedation after an MRI two days later. Though no signs of epilepsy emerge, Lestrade thinks it best to keep them on a low dose levetiracetam until their transfer to a university hospital in Belgrade is complete. As predicted, he has a hemiparesis affecting mostly the lower limb on the opposite site to the infarction, decreased verbal fluency and not aphasia — which is better than expected. There is visual neglect meaning that they don't notice things on some areas of their visual field though they are right there, and apraxia — jerky, uncoordinated movements, especially in tasks requiring precision. Four days later, the patient is stable and ready to engage in a physical therapy plan and a medical flight out of the UK, and that is when Lestrade lets Sherlock read the patient notes on his office computer.
"I think you need more meds first. We could do this in the morning?" you suggest warily, aware that when Sherlock gets an idea, he never lets go of it.
HIV has been around since the eighties. I could have caught it during any of the time I betrayed my principles of condoms and never sharing needles. I could have caught it at any time when I didn't care whether I lived or died.
"Haven't you ever felt responsible for how a case turned out even though you didn't make a mistake?"
Wind-tousled, it looks almost passable but combed down, it would make the man look older than his years. John's eyes are kind, but with something concealed there, something evasive if Sherlock meets his gaze for too long.
Lestrade glances around the room and addresses the whole team. "Back in the day when films were actual films, every once in a while, someone shoved them onto the box the wrong way around. Every surgeon who's operated on enough backs will once or twice operate on the wrong level." His tone is odd — stern instead of reassuring.
He notices an email notification — it's a communique from Vandersteen, a link to a recent interview article with a GMC representative.
"Besides, I think Violet really wants to spend some time with you. And we wouldn't want to disappoint the village council, would we?" John says with a grin.
John pulls out a chair and sits, his hands folded in his lap, his eyebrows drawn together. Sherlock remains standing, squeezing the edges of the chair back with his knuckles while. He loathes the frustrated concern emanating from John — why is it that the only exception to his blindness to other people's emotions is their disappointment in him?
"That he may also have occasional moments when he struggles with the same frustrations, and that many people share those experiences, regardless of whether they or their partners are ASD."
, Sherlock tells himself sternly, and knows that he cannot, for the sake of his pride alone, make such a suggestion.
"Question number two: when was the last time you ate anything proper? A full meal, I mean, not three crisps I managed to trick you into eating on the couch or half a chocolate bar inhaled before your afternoon operation."
"Room three. Sir?" the woman manning the reception window calls out after you, "Sir, if you could give them a minute––" she rises from the chair but doesn't follow you, doesn't try to stop you because you've already stridden too far down the corridor.
In fifteen minutes, John and his anaesthesia nurse have achieved a steady state of deep general anaesthesia using propofol and remifentanil infusions with a side of noradrenalin, antibiotic is dripping into one of the lumens of the central line, and the scrub nurse begins shaving half the patient's head.
"You have both told me that he didn't have very much of it growing up. Receiving such attention from his father now, as an adult, allows him to start without a lot of baggage. The amount of your attention he received, he often considered overwhelming and excessive. His words, not my analysis. It will be the lens through which he sees and interprets your actions now. If you want to repair your relationship, you need to listen to his side of the story and accept it as equally important to your own. You will help him return to you best by supporting his autonomy in setting boundaries and by accepting his account of his life. Only when he starts to feel emotionally safe in your presence when it comes to the boundaries he is setting, can he take steps forward to being closer to you."
The day shift nurse is called Andrew. He's a quiet sort, which Sherlock will probably appreciate once he's awake. Andrew attends to his duties with diligent, calm focus, and makes you feel less like an intruder than having Leah around did. Andrew seems to have an infinite amount of patience for your questions, which someone with less professional confidence might take for distrust in their meticulousness.
"Very well. I shall wait in the hall. Do recall me when it's time to formulate a plan. I should want to hear it from the good doctor here, since you have a tendency to twist facts to your liking when reality inconveniences you."
Mulling over this, John realises something he doesn't like one bit. "He went to the neurosurgical ward. Then to the neurosurgical OR. That can't be random. Why's he doing this? Why that ward?"
I was about to storm in there myself. What the hell took them so long?" He's not even sure he's talking about what happened in the OR or after. He's babbling, out of his mind with relief.
"He was struggling with bouncing back even though he's an experienced gas man and practically a career soldier at the same time. Wasn't his first gig abroad in a war zone, was it?"
Rosie's first Christmas without her mother is approaching fast, and John isn't coping well with the pressures of being a single parent. Can Sherlock scrape his new family back together?
"What is appropriate penance, then? Analysing the cause of a mistake and making sure it won't repeat? I can't do that because I don't know why it happened. I can't focus on the patient, either — Greg said he didn't think I was capable of it at the time, so I wasn't even allowed to try before the case was ripped out of my hands."
Victor had told him about seeing the stars out in the desert, how many more there were than one could ever see in London. Tonight, there are no stars, just the glowing embers in the fireplace. The lighthouse at Noup Head is too high on a cliff and the house is too well concealed from its line of sight for the sweeping light to reach here.
"Make yourself useful and get me the self-discharge forms." He buttons his pyjama top with fumbling fingers, leaving the incision uncovered underneath.
"Have you finished?" Joanna asks curiously instead of the tone Sherlock has used sometimes for similar inquiries after John has laid things all out like this.
"Just a few minutes," you promise, seeking confirmation from the EMT who's in the back with the two of you. You get a nod. "Any better?" you then ask Sherlock with the smile of a shark. Though there have been no complaints, you're always felt as though you never quite developed the reassuring, calm crisis demeanour of the colleagues you admired for their bedside manner. You're one of those people who can't force a smile to reach their eyes; the anger and the worry always pinch your features tight, and you imagine you look like a wax mask.
. It still feels disconcerting for John. He wants to be in the papers even less than Sherlock probably does.
"You are a medical professional who enjoys seeing justice done, enjoys using his skills and knowledge to solve problems, likes to be useful. All that, you can do with me. What law says you must do it in a role similar to every dullard who's ever trained in orthopaedics and traumatology?"
Emma swaps the old syringe for a new one, then checks the dressing covering the entry point of his large central line.
George takes Natch out while Violet and Sherlock watch the evening news. Sherlock misses half of it because he's reading on his tablet an online-first version of an article he'd helped John write. It's the first research article John has to his name, so Sherlock texts him the link and his congratulations. John doesn't have a curated system of tracking new journal articles like he does, so he may not have spotted it yet. Sherlock is uncertain how much use his advice and editing have been for John in this endeavour, but it feels good to have one area in which he could be useful to his husband.
They find John on the sofa, television on to some game show which momentarily catches Sherlock's attention. It's a high-sum question, supposedly difficult, but he knows the answer. He doesn't say it, because he suspects blurting out such a thing before a customary greeting might be one of those social rules people like Violet so appreciate.
He's not quite there yet; he's not yet dangling over the edge and feeling the pull of ecstatic damnation. Damn them all — John, Doctor Pichler, anyone who's ever tried to convince him that the prophecies of his diagnosis and his mother are not predestination. Damn them for the hope they have made sprout through the concrete of his self-loathing. All those years ago, after understanding that the arm's length at which Victor held him was no long-term life plan, Sherlock had chosen medicine over speed-balling, and he would choose medicine over and over again. When he was young, a quick oblivion was better than a more gradual reward of the long game, but he has so much more perspective now. Add John to the mix, and the scales tip — no bag of white powder could ever be lighter on his conscience than knowing who he'd betrayed. That's not to say he couldn't ever relapse, wouldn't ever feel rotten enough to need the needle more, but that moment has not yet arrived, and John and he have gone through some pretty rotten times together.
"Correct. And that title does not rule out making mistakes. Lots of them. Bad ones. I read up on you, you know. You are not like all the rest, not even after this. I was never an exceptional surgeon, never rose to the upper echelons of my specialty. I was competent enough, and that sufficed for me. I wasn't good enough or confident enough to endure a blow to my ego or to my belief in my own abilities. Are you good enough to endure that, Sherlock Holmes? Have you a large enough margin of skill that this won't put you out of business?"
You doubt Sherlock would be amenable to that, because it sounds as though it would involve a psychiatrist or psychologist, and he's often voiced his disapproval of those fields. He seems to think anything that's not natural sciences is pseudoscience.
Victor hadn't been nice to him, so Victor had been allowed to stay. Like a wine stain not sunk fast enough into cold water, Sherlock had allowed him to linger for too long and leave a mark.
"You've done so well so far. I'd be surprised if there weren't any hitches at all, considering how badly you were in heart failure."
"I have observed and adopted good practices of communication from my fellow surgeons, continued working with Doctor Watson in adapting my communication skills to different situations, and I have had a therapist specialising in ASD-related issues for several years now."
She makes the call, then informs you that Marsh had said he's unfortunately too busy today since he's beginning his holidays this afternoon and has instructed to request another anaesthetist for a discussion when they come to the ward in the afternoon for preop rounds.
"Yes, for the usual sort of pointless things John wants us to attend with his friends. This is more important, and he knows it."
John rips off his gloves. "I'm calling it quits for her. Turn off the vent and push three millilitres of fentanyl, please." Sherlock is not the only consultant present and, as the Director of Operative Services, John technically outranks even Sherlock. "No ID yet, I assume?" It means no knowledge of who the patient's family members might be.
The evening is still young by London standards, so he texts Lestrade to ask if there are any new developments. Having forgot he'd turned it on silent as they were headed to Christian's place, he digs out his phone ten minutes later to check if there's a reply. When he looks up from his phone, the front door to 221B Baker Street is less than forty paces away.
"This wasn't about saving his wife. It was about misguided vengeance directed at the wrong people, and reckless endangerment of innocent bystanders. You don't owe him any sympathy. He had a gun on
"If it happens, it'll be in the late afternoon or evening, after the surgeons on call have cleared the day's urgent operations list."
happened to be on the spectrum as well. After some hemming and hawing, John had answered affirmatively, and confessed later to Sherlock how guilty he felt about agreeing to discuss it with a colleague. Sherlock had surprised both of them by not being all that upset about it. Not at all, in fact. He'd discussed this with Joanna and realised that something had shifted, parted the veil of shame he'd kept draped around himself for decades.
"Mortality rate?" Mycroft asks, having regained his composure. He sounds like he's haggling a prize at a bazaar.
"Would it be fair to say that you dealt with it by not dealing with it? When you were growing up, there was no one you to whom could express the emotions your relationship with your mother created, so those emotions remained largely unaddressed until a few Christmases ago. After Afghanistan, you were in survival mode, pushing your emotions aside again to help John who was in crisis. Your turn never quite came, did it?
Edgar glances at his Balenciaga watch. "I don't think we can make it to Baker Street to pack and then get to the train station before the train departure. I will make a packing detour after we drop you off, courier what you need to your parents' house."
it. He glances at John's IV. “Glucose-containing fluids? I thought those were generally unnecessary perioperatively.”
Now, he settles into the old armchair by the fireplace, and lifts his arms above his head, feeling his vertebrae pop. It's so odd how solitude feels different here than it did in London. He's more alone than ever, but feels no expectations of others to change it, no pressure to partner himself with someone.
Sherlock wonders that afternoon, watching the sunlight from the boathouse's only window give John's salt-and-pepper hair a yellow glint.
This chapter and chapter 10 will reference several important past events, so let's have some useful reminders.
Mike is looking at you now, as though seeking backup. "Holosystolic jet, vena contracta over oh point nine centimetres. The opening is more than oh point eight square centimetres from this projection. E-wave dominant," he muses.
abusive!" The defensiveness that floods in surprising Sherlock with its intensity. He no longer feels sad — he can now recognise he's angry.
"There should be a… fanfare of sorts at the start, and then something spirited but melodic at the end."
John is in a good mood — the dark clouds of worry from this morning and the preceding weekend have moved aside. Sherlock has performed outstandingly in the OR today, which should prove to everyone — and, most importantly, to Sherlock himself — that a hiccup with one patient doesn't have mean he's suddenly lost any of his skills.
You can't lose him. Sherlock bloody Holmes cannot go down like this — not because of a dodgy heart valve. No, it's got to be deep in the Game, in the heat of the chase. Or, perhaps as a ninety-something with a violin in hand, at dusk in a garden somewhere with bees buzzing about. That's what Sherlock had told you once — that he wanted to retire to Sussex with
Sherlock goes to the fridge and, to John's utter astonishment, drinks straight out of the milk carton.
"I adopted him on a whim, too," Sherlock admits. "I didn't have any plans. I thought… I thought that was it for me, professionally. I stopped planning the future. I thought I'd lost it all because of things that I can't control, because things… I am and can't change. I was so afraid Violet was going to say that if I left, they'd abandon Natch."
. He's doing this because he needs to be a surgeon who looks their patient straight in the eye regardless of the outcome — the sort of surgeon who doesn't abandon ship even when the battle ends in defeat.
John lives alone; wouldn't he sometimes want company? Then again, Sherlock has no idea how many friends John has here on Westray.
"We'll work it out," John says, aware that it's more a statement of intent than a promise he knows he can keep. "We always do."
A week later, it is very hard for John to reconcile the surgeon he'd seen in the King's CCTV footage shown in court with how his husband looks now. John knows Sherlock has always had a predilection for episodic depression, and that black periods have been triggered by difficulties in his career but also brought on just by the fact that clinical depression doesn't play by any rules. In a way, what's going on now with the media and potential GMC process are a convergence of many old fears and confidence problems. John is haunted by the thought that maybe he should have seen this coming. Joanna Pichler doesn't seem surprised by how things are, but John can tell that she has grown immensely worried in a way John has rarely seen before.
"Like he'll only be willing to talk about himself if people pretend that they're not asking about him when they really are?"
It delights me greatly how fond so many readers are of Dr Pichler. If anyone was to be Sherlock's therapist, they had to be clever enough not just to keep up with his intellectuality but to be one step ahead of him, able to challenge his thinking. It's quite the challenge, I tell you, trying to outwit Dr Holmes' defence mechanisms…
If something circulates a planet on too low an orbit, it will eventually crash into its atmosphere and burn. I am ready to crash into John's, but instead of breaking apart, I believe it's the only way to stay whole.
And Sherlock does. His fingers twitch a little under John's, but he stops, and just sits, staring down at a spot on John's chest. He's shaking hard, thighs clenched around John's pelvis like a vice, the line of his shoulders tense. His lungs are working like bellows as he struggles to take heaving breaths.
"Could run in the family, then," you tell him. Risk factors, prognoses, procedures. You long for a wound to suture, a fracture to reposition. Not this, not something where you can't just reach in and fix it.
John and Mycroft have teamed up to land Sherlock in rehab after a relapse of his drug habit. Sherlock is not happy, and proceeds to try and orchestrate his escape via text messages.
"Yet he has shown to be willing and capable of learning to deal with those social interactions. He's made a lot of progress, John, which he doesn't always see himself. That's an even more brittle part of his confidence than what happens in the OR."
Finally, he stops fighting you and freezes. A part of him seems to register your presence. He draws a ragged, deeper breath and closes his eyes. Now that it's quiet, you are both hearing the steady but fast ticking of his new valve.
"I'll get us some tea," John says. Just as he's about to leave the room, he turns and calls out Sherlock's name.
"There were lessons determinedly and repeatedly forced upon me which I chose to resist. One of them was being told not to pursue medicine, a profession in which my interest began to grow during my late teens. For years, I had been told that there was no cure for what I was, nothing that could be done to change the cards I had been dealt — namely the brain I had been born with. But how much did the scientific community actually know about autism? Understanding the fundamental, physical differences between my grey matter and that of neurotypical individuals was unlikely to offer tangible tools of navigating this world better, but that didn't matter to me. I needed to know. I needed to understand. And that is what led me to explore neuroscience. My fellow surgeons most likely think I chose intracranial surgery because of its reputation as a highly competitive and prestigious surgical field, because of the high stakes involved which may stroke a pathological ego, the manual dexterity required which I happened to possess. They are all wrong. I chose to do what I do because not only did I want to understand myself, I wanted to do for others what I could not do for myself: fix things, fix people. Those who have accused me of being cold, unfeeling and borderline sociopathic, pay attention, now: I
A passing Violet dexterously snatches Sherlock's tablet away, causing him to sit up with a disgruntled yelp when his head collides with some low-hanging lilac blooms. Tiny bits of the flowers get stuck in his curls, and he looks snootily put-upon as he flicks them off.
The humour slips off like water receding from a beach at low tide and seems to make no impact. Silence makes it fade, turns amusing into embarrassing.
It's probably good that he's in Sussex and not in London, where he could have put on his coat and went to find Wiggins.
He stands up, starts pacing. "The victim suffered a blow to the head, causing a brain injury which made him incapable of being interviewed. All we have to reconstruct their encounter are the wounds and the crime scene."
The antidepressants and the benzodiazepines you refused to touch, save for the latter on particularly difficult days. Double standard, that's what it was, convincing yourself alcohol was less dangerous. Less addictive. You know it runs in your blood, the risk. Harry's embraced it with her arms open. Your father died of it.
She stands up and goes to sprinkle some flaky food into the fish tank. "Have you conversed with John about what we discussed the last time?"
Lestrade, seating behind his desk, directs Sherlock to sit on the sofa since he's giving a wide berth to the chair in front of the desk. "All in good time," he tells Sherlock. "We need to assess the big picture first."
Sherlock knows those things are a poor substitute for someone who might want to stay. It's just that he doesn't have a choice in the matters.
What Marsh says about risk factors for accidental awareness during general anaesthesia holds water. It does still happen, but very very rarely since we can now use EEG-based sleep depth monitoring, anaesthesia drugs and techniques have evolved, and muscle relaxants are not needed for all surgeries any more since we can use a laryngeal mask airway instead of intubation in many cases. But, for certain kinds of operations such as emergency c-sections and cardiac surgery, there is a risk that needs to be acknowledged and appropriate assessment and support provided for patients to whom it has happened. It should be reassuring that, while accidental awareness is very rare, even rarer is the worst subtype: being awake and feeling immense pain and fear during the experience. Many patients who believe they've been accidentally aware have actually had an operation under a nerve block + sedation, during which it's entirely normal to keep dozing off and then returning to even full awareness. Preventing patients getting the wrong idea and being alarmed afterwards requires meticulous explanations from the anaesthesia team beforehand on what is to be expected. When talking about sedation with patients, I never use the word 'sleep', for instance, to avoid that sort of confusion. There are also patients who falsely believe they've experienced accidental awareness even though their hazy memories are just from anaesthesia induction and/or being allowed to emerge once the surgery is over. More on accidental awareness later as Marsh comes to visit Sherlock.
a rule introduced by Lestrade that the surgeon should do it. For cervical spine operations they always comply, but with intracranial stuff Sherlock is hardly the only one who tends to plod off before the headframe removal is due.
"The patient's family does not know any of this, however," a panellist points out. "All they know was that a surgeon was consulted, and they said no to operating on her."
instead of your pain." Sherlock crinkles his nose in distaste as John lowers the bottle back into the bag. "I never did oxy. Well, much," he adds quietly while glancing in the rear-view mirror. Their driver has headphones on, and if Edgar is surprised by this revelation from Sherlock's past, he's adept at hiding it.
The DI is right in that Sherlock has never wasted any on such wastes of space, breath and human potential as Colin Valentine Tipps, who the unimaginative press has dubbed "The Carpet Killer". It was a rug, not a carpet he'd wrapped his victims in. On second thought, Sherlock decides he isn't proud of the speed and precision of his own thought processes in this case, after all. It hadn't occurred to him until the third crime scene to look at the kitchens more carefully.
"I tune out a lot of useless chatter," Holmes replies imperiously. "The cast is off. Will you look at the photos now?"
Perhaps her point with the violin had been a lesson for John, too — a reminder that Sherlock communicates all the time, just not necessarily in words.
"There has to be something," Sherlock says. "If it wasn't something I did, it must've been something I didn't do, or what I said, or didn't say. I never saw Fairholme. The neuro team spoke to him, I assume. Maybe they said something that made it sound like I… I don't know!" He tears at his hair in a fit of frustration. "None of the other King's surgeons have had patients' family members storm the OR baying for blood."
The rational part of you knows that there is no harm in allowing Sherlock's artificial slumber to last a bit longer; it gives his body peace and quiet to heal itself. You still can't help wanting to see him, talk to him, make sure he's alright. You long to ask what he remembers and how it was in theatre before they put him under. You want to explain things to him, to make it all more palatable and less upsetting. You recognise that the possessive protectiveness you feel for him had made you even irrationally suspicious of Leah until you had observed her work. Now, you trust her, because you've enough to recognise that she is very good and experienced at what she does, and that she treats her patients gently and conscientiously.
"It's not just the media," John points out, "there's a GMC investigation going on, and nobody knows what the likelihood is of it turning into an MPTS tribunal."
"You're a detective, hm? What did you think of me before you showed up at my door? What did you read on me, analyse and all? You
"Yes?" In the background there's a sound similar to a purse rustling; perhaps she's packing her things for the day.
Sherlock usually ignores warning signals from The Transport but this time, it's his precious brain that's in jeopardy. How will he and John cope?
there. I just… I can't stop trying to pick apart my own recollections. If I can't trust this," he points at his head, "then I can't trust myself. The first days after the operation are a mess in my head; clearly, I've been awake, I've conversed with people, but I have no idea what I've said during most of that time. I won't go through that again, compromise the timeline in my head."
, not your housekeeper." He kisses Sherlock right on the nose. "Besides, housekeepers don't have the perks I'll get, such as having the professor in my bed."
Sherlock's grin is wicked. "Yes. In fact, wouldn't it be the best punishment for them for reporting me to the GMC to have to continue to put up with me?"
Sherlock rises from his seat to go pick up the folder from the side table. He finds the coroner's report and drops it into John's lap.
It takes a while to reorganise the tangle of wires and tubing attached to him for transport and to shift the oxygen supply from the wall to a portable tank. Infusers need to be safely fastened for the trip down to the OR floor, reports given to the anaesthesia team on how he's doing. Sherlock’s eyes are closed, but he’s not asleep; his hand hasn’t gone lax in yours, and you can feel the nervous tension tightening his arm muscles. You wish desperately that you could do more, that you knew what to do, that the room wasn’t full of people and that you had the right words to give him confidence.
"How can you make a comparison when there is no baseline to these tests? All you have is me, now. Nobody knows what I was like before."
John jogs downstairs after receiving a message from Joanna that she'll soon be at the front door. He's asked her to text instead of ringing the bell, hoping that Sherlock might sleep a bit longer, allowing John to pick her brain some more. When he opens the door, the psychiatrist slips in amidst the chaos of reporters trying to shove themselves into the building after her.
There will be two members and a chairperson. If those don't include a legal expert, a fourth member will be added. The other members are physicians and laypersons. There will be a clerk, witnesses, a GMC representative as well as Sherlock and his legal representative. Since Tribunals are inherently public unless the doctor's health matters are being discussed, John will be present — and he has been called as a witness on Sherlock's behalf.
"It is just A-fib. We'll fix it," you promise, feeling as though you're holding a live wire as you address Sherlock who's sitting on the bed, legs off the side, still looking ready to leave. He refused to lie back down.
Sherlock is never deliberately self-centred, but it's hard for him to put himself in someone else's shoes. John knows his husband can't operate on just vague, abstracts things the connection of which to his own work he cannot see. He can't and won't change his behaviour based on just vague ideas and lists of instructions: he needs concrete proof before he can shift his viewpoint. Evidence.
It appears that John had acted as his own prosecutor, judge, and jury. Sherlock finds he still has questions which these impersonal words on paper cannot answer.
, John curses inwardly. "Have we got a blood gas printout?" John asks, raising his voice over the cacophony.
John is exhausted by family life and Sherlock is feeling neglected. An abysmal spur-of-the-moment decision leads to a brutal confrontation which might just be the endgame of a relationship.
"Sherlock and I have discussed extensively his childhood experiences of therapy, and I believe the subject came up during our second joint session. Do you recall what we discussed?"
It's not because you have the nagging feeling of arriving in the false calm of the eye of the storm.
"I'm trying to protect you," Lestrade says, sounding slightly irritated. He sits down next to Sherlock and leans back against the seat as well.
They had not been trying to decide whether to have another child. What they were forced to decide was whether to terminate what already existed. They had relations so rarely, and Violet had been so exhausted that she was lucky to remember her own name, let alone whether she'd taken her pill every morning. She must have just forgot. Perhaps William being difficult had distracted him one morning, though he can hardly be blamed for something that was an adult's responsibility.
Not wanting to get dust and splinters stuck in his jacket, Sherlock strips down to his shirtsleeves. The manual labour should keep him warm even in the biting wind. A crow is making a sardonic racket in the tree above, and though he can't spot the bird, Sherlock directs a glare in its assumed direction.
Joanna picks a few wilted lettuce bits out of the plastic container housing her salad. There's still fifteen minutes before her last appointment of the day. Though it's been a long day of getting to know several new clients, she still has energy left for Sherlock Holmes. A delight in how much progress he's made and also a formidable professional challenge, she knows she needs to be on her best game with him. Not only is he exceptionally intelligent and a colleague, his neuroatypicality and past negative experiences with therapy require finesse from a person seeking his trust. Their last appointment had been two days ago; she had suggested scheduling another soon after, since Holmes seems to need intensified support. Joanna is not certain she would call this a crisis yet, but she wants to keep a close eye on him. She feels that they have built a good rapport, which is why she is surprised when he strides in ten minutes early, the entire form of him tight and dismissive. Anger shines bright on his features.
John wonders. His mobile has vibrated with about a dozen messages from colleagues and other staff members asking how Sherlock is doing and expressing their sympathies since Sherlock is not answering their inquiries. Not that many staff members would even have Sherlock's private number, save for other neurosurgeons, his clinic nurse Marie, and the Ward Sisters of the OR and the neurosurgical bed ward.
Maybe you should go sit in your chair. Maybe you should go to bed, after all — give him the space he hasn't actively sought but which you feel between the two of you like an open wound.
"Indeed. In fact, it has been established that a great many complaints against doctors stem from communication problems, not the medical decisions."
. Sherlock bristles for a moment; he hates being reminded of his… particular traits. John probably hadn't meant it that way; he's probably just tired and in pain and thus a bit thoughtless. The insinuation still grates a bit.
Sherlock has never felt alone like this in London. He hadn't ever realised how the sounds of the other inhabitants of the building, the pedestrians, the cars driving by helped him feel less isolated. The darkness is different, too. Unpolluted by the city lights, it's like being draped in black velvet. Thick like molasses and alive, it is a mythical beast swallowing everything in its path. Sherlock gets up at midnight to close the curtains; he's unsettled by an irrational fear of someone looking in. There's no one here — Ardle must be tucked away in bed in the lighthouse, and birds must have retreated into their cliff and tree dwellings for the night. Sherlock has never read up on these islands, has never paid them much mind, so he doesn't know who else might be living on this rock, if anyone.
John retreats into the house from the front steps, starts clattering around to find his shoes. "It used to belong to Angus' brother, who died a few years back. All the guy's sheep were sold, and they were taking them to the mainland for slaughter, but Angus, who'd not shown his face even though he’d been asked to come help out, appeared on the pier at the last moment, grabbed this one and took it home. Tav — Tavish Ardle, that is — named them all after some historical stuff; he was into that. Don't know why Herr Führer was an ewe, though. She had lambs every summer."
. John knows this to be British Rail speak for a suicidal jumper. He had texted Sherlock that he'd be late, and the response had been quick and short:
. All these other professionals are the first to second-guess a surgeon's decisions after a procedure goes tits-up, but would they be any better at making these difficult calls? Likely not.
"While before, he believed he could outrun it," his brother concludes dryly. "How observant of you."
John opens the door with a kitchen towel in hand. His self-reliant male domesticity is in great contrast to how Sherlock had grown up, surrounded by female staff who would keep the family fed, clothed and their surroundings dustless and orderly. There was also a groundskeeper, who could probably manage effortlessly in these island surroundings.
that?! He's got a career better than anybody else's at King's, one that makes mine look like a failure, and he thinks he's–– he–– He's the most self-absorbed man in London, that's what he is, not a fraud!" John is pointing at the floor, his left palm on his hip. "
An involuntary shudder passes through him, and then he tells you, offers you freely the truth of at least one thing that bothers him. It's so uncharacteristic of him it leaves you reeling to admit to something bothering him.
John tucks an errant curl behind Sherlock's ear. "No, it wasn't. I wouldn't have gone to see Molly if it wasn't for you. If you weren't worth putting myself through the wringer, worth having a long, hard look in the mirror. And, while I appreciate the credit you gave me, you haven't changed just because of me – you've changed because you always want to do better. To
"Has that sort of beating yourself up over stuff ever helped you do better? Has punishing yourself ever made you better at anything? Has it made you feel better about yourself or about what happened? If you just got stuck in all that, would you and John be still together, for instance?"
When Sherlock returns to the flat after walking off his anger, John is back in the bedroom again. Sherlock prepares him a bowl of yoghurt — without granola since it would be too coarse. He adds a drizzle of honey and delivers the meal to the bedside table besides a snoring John. He flinches awake when Sherlock announces "dinner" in a flat monotone. Sherlock then makes a hasty retreat into the bathroom for a shower before John gets a chance to say anything.
Sherlock assumes that such a thing as smugness is not really allowed for therapists but then again, he has no idea what else her face could be projecting right now than a rather relieved
Sherlock reaches for the bottle of soda on the bedside cabinet. It's a local Azorean brand with an astronomically high caffeine and sugar content.
He's not being constantly ECG-monitored any longer; they get a short paper film every morning with the labs, plus there's BP and saturation measurements every few hours. They need to be redone, stat. You press the call button.
At night, in bed, you hold his hand, and him. There is no falling in love with Sherlock Holmes, not for you — there is only falling deeper into what you tried to swim against, helpless and exhausted to fight since you knew somewhere inside where you'd end up. Right here, in his arms, and he in yours.
A quiet chuckle from the audience. It's hollow, disbelieving of itself, but it's there. When it ends, one could hear a pin drop.
call you," Sherlock decides, and closes the lid of the laptop without a goodbye. Social niceties such as properly ending a call are never important for him.
After they make the miraculous find of a free parking spot around the corner from 221 Baker Street, he needs to be prompted twice to get out of the car. He fishes his keys out of his pocket and holds them out to Violet wordlessly, aware of the concerned looks she’s shooting his way as she unlocks the door, aware of each minute that passes without him saying a word, aware of every step that brings him closer to John. She opens the door and proceeds him up the stairs, blessedly saying nothing of the way he’s trailing behind her like a chastised schoolboy.
"No, I have not." He doesn't want to specify whether he's answering the question about the existence of such fantasies or saying that he's not told John any such thing. Sex has been discussed many times during these therapy appointments, but delving into the realm of fantasy feels particularly invasive. "He's never worn any of his dress uniforms in my presence; all I've seen are photographs. I may have commented a few times on his appearance in such images, that's all. "
Violet sets three places by the kitchen table, and Sherlock flops down into one of the chairs, tempted to dig out his phone and lose himself in his emails. He refrains but only barely, aware that John would probably consider that impolite.
"You have a charger in the office, don't you?" Not that John would count on him to remember to connect it once he gets there.
"Must've been quite the adventure," John jokes as he cleans the minor wound created by Sherlock's head hitting the sharp corner of the bedside cabinet. "Who were you trying to wrestle besides the duvet?"
As much as Sherlock is desperate for John's presence, the prospect of it makes him nervous because he doesn't want people to scrutinise his well-being, nor does he want to talk about the Tribunal. He misses John and John's hugs and kisses — even his hovering at times like these. John is so good at distracting him, making him see past his own scepticism and self-hatred by reminding him that he can't be all pointless if John still sees fit to want to share his life with him.
You cannot go in there." The clerk doesn't rise from his desk because there's an electric lock on the door requiring a key card to enter.
asking them to cover his purchases would be too mortifying. Still, he feels quite whiplashed, even steamrollered by this doctor who he'd only sought out because he needed a wound sutured. This John Watson seems to be appointing himself as some sort of a janitor.
Sherlock huffs as the calls is disconnected. He most certainly won’t be having anything resembling even a bearable one at this rate. He leaves the bed, curling his toes on the cold floor. In the sitting room, he opens the window and sticks his head out to shock his system into proper wakefulness.
"This is Victor Trevor," Mycroft said dryly, nodding towards a sandy-haired, tall man in jeans and a leather jacket perched at the edge of the kitchen table. Sherlock remembers wondering who the
There had been conversations with George about all this when they were trying to decide, conversations where they explored all the options, but she wouldn't hear it if he tried to suggest sending Sherlock away. It was an unfathomable idea to give up on him like that. Violet had refused to even discuss it because the thought felt as though they were discussing replacing him with another child who perhaps might have an easier time growing up because they refused to believe she could have Sherlock's difficulties. Girls weren't really diagnosed with anything like that in those days.
has touched him in that reverent way John had — as if Sherlock’s pleasure and safety was more important than his own.
This is one of those moments. Instead of imperious dismissal, there is an urgency in his gaze; he's pleading you wordlessly to fix this, because you're the doctor. You're
"Right," John says quietly. Most likely the patient will pass away at A&E before they make the transfer, but he hopes she might last long enough because it'll be nicer for family members to get to say goodbye in a private room at a bed ward than at the busy A&E department.
Intolerably anxious even after soaking in lavender-scented warm water until his toes turn wrinkly, Sherlock pulls on a pair of pyjamas though it's just past eleven in the morning. He drapes his blue dressing gown tightly around his torso and goes to his violin. After rosining the bow hairs, he tunes it with even more care than usual, tempted to yell curses at the tuner's needle when he doesn't manage to position it precisely in the middle right away. When he stacks too high a pile of sheet music on the stand, some of it flutters down and he's forced to close his eyes for a second to calm down so that he won't just fling the bow at something.
Mrs Hudson looks momentarily confused, then seems to decide to ignore what Sherlock might be referring to about the past. "Everyone avoids things. I've my hip, and it's been ripe for a replacement for over five years, but I just… I know it would be better, but most days I just think that I'll manage, because going through the whole thing, surgery and hospital and all, that would just be so
"Might as well be talking to myself." There's the bitter, salty nectar of tears tickling the back of his throat again, and he swallows it like a pill. He hates it, how easily John can do this to him when he's not even really
Angus had spat on the floor again when Sherlock had asked about internet access, and he hadn’t spotted a computer of any kind in John’s house.
It appears so. "I hate that fucking job at the surgery," John continues. "I used to do proper ortho surgery, not remove fishing hooks and prescribe antibiotics for bronchitis. I mean, all hail those who love GP, it's a great specialty if you like that sort of thing."
"I've no time for the sorts of trite platitudes people cultivate at times of distress," Sherlock confirms. He finds a container he's nearly certain contains sugar and pushes it back into the cupboard.
"Tired," he mutters into the duvet he's pulled up to his chin. He turns to face John so that he can slip a hand into John's hair and twiddle strands of it in his fingers. Maybe he's fascinated by the colour and texture because they are so different from his own soft, meticulously coiffed dark ringlets. "You have more grey than last year."
Sherlock is not entirely certain he even wants sex or that John will be in a mindset to have it after some more potentially emotionally laden conversation. What Sherlock wants more right now than to be aroused is the feeling after sex, all blissed out and lying mostly on top of his husband. Falling asleep to the sound of John's lungs taking in air, of his heart beating, his arms around Sherlock. That is when he feels more present and loved than ever. John is his heart, his life, his one and only thought in those moments, and it is a feat no one else has achieved: to anchor Sherlock so into the present that his mind quiets down to appreciate what it has right there, right then.
"You told me you were frustrated after Afghanistan because you couldn't help me sort myself out. Took some time to get you to understand it wasn't your job. That's the same kind of frustration I've been having right now."
Sherlock doesn’t deal well with medical attention, hates strangers touching him. He can be confused and restless emerging from anaesthesia. You know this from experience. He’s prone to agitation and nausea even after smaller operations, let alone waking up at the ITU with his sternum sawed open and wired shut, drains coming out of his chest.
doing it. Trust Sherlock never do anything by halves — or just elect to do nothing at all when things don't go his way.
There are other terrifying but also wonderful words I have for him. Words I've said before. Didn't you hear me, John, at your wedding? Perhaps my timing was off as usual. You know social cues are not my forte. Didn't you hear it on the phone when you looked up and saw me standing at the edge of the roof? Didn't you hear it every time I said your name through the years?
"Good. That should get us through the CT." John gives a bolus of each, save for the propofol — they can't afford the BP drop it would cause. "What did she have before arrival?"
Vandersteen has represented over twenty physicians in similar proceedings and had offered to arrange for Sherlock to speak with several of these former clients if he wants references, but Sherlock doesn't want to speak to others who have gone through this. Their cases are different. He wants neither the depressing stories of failure nor any false-hope-inducing tales of being found not impaired by a Tribunal.
John is a broken record this morning. He needs to speak louder than usual to get acknowledged and half of the time he can't even tell if it's because of the temporary effect on Sherlock's hearing from the gunshot or if it's just due to the man's selective attention. This morning, through a text from Lestrade inquiring about Sherlock's health, John had learned that Sherlock had declined to be examined by anyone after the crisis, regardless of how many times the police had tried to change his mind. John wishes he'd known this yesterday; he would have done it himself. Sherlock's ears are ringing, and his hearing is slightly impaired in the ear that had been the closest to the shot — this much John has managed to coax out of him. He'd suggested asking one of the King's ENTs for a consultation, only to be shut down with a firm
"I told you I had a thing with my commanding officer. He got me transferred. That was the end of us. Mary found out from some emails she saw. That's when we went to counselling. I knew then that it would be hard, maybe impossible, to think that I'd have to go the rest of my life without ever being with a man again, but what could I do but promise her? We were
"And that's what you got today. You can't hog all the fun, Sherlock, the rest of us need some, too," Lestrade teases.
Hands shaking. All eyes on him. His own tiny, throat-clearing cough, echoing through the microphone system like a pebble dropped down the walls of a cavern.
"No. This is the first time I've seen him take out his uniform from where he'd stuffed it in the back of the wardrobe."
Sherlock goes to him, alarmed. Without asking, he reaches down to take John's hand, holding the wrist so he can take a pulse.
this, Sherlock, and you can control it." She instructs him to hold his breath, then release it, keeps repeating it many times until he can begin to attempt to comply.
John notices that she doesn't add that he was worried, too. The minute Sherlock thinks people are ganging up on him and being condescending, he's likely to get waspish if not worse.
Emma shrugs — just a jerk of her bony shoulders, as though she's trying to shrug off the unpleasant truth like a mallard shaking water droplets off its feathers.
On occasion, Sherlock sounds a bit like those Youtube meme videos about surgical single-mindedness. "Why won't the reg do it?"
"A… flatmate?" John repeats. He's been in Sherlock's bed and in Sherlock's body; somehow that doesn’t seem like the right word. Unless this is Sherlock's way of terminating that part of their relationship, since nobody in their right mind would dumb a beau by asking them to move in. Then again, is Sherlock in his right mind, generally?
Greir excuses herself, and John turns to May again. "You said you heard shouting. About what? Could you make out any details?"
"Maybe it's a bit like driving after a car crash. Unless you start doing it again, it'll always remain a fear-inducing thing. It'll take time for the confidence to come back but once it does, it could be fun again. I didn't feel like I'd want to walk into an OR ever again after Afghanistan, but I did. And you helped me with that."
Normally, you wouldn't do what you're about to do. Normally, there is that thin, elusive film of proper and decent and straight and he's-just-a-mate between you but right now, you feel just like you felt in Afghanistan when your fellow soldiers went down: that injury and illness make those boundaries feel as though they never existed. As a human, as a doctor, as a friend and as someone who cares about Sherlock more than you often care about yourself, the sight of him screams out to you for comfort, for connection, for something that could convince him better than words that he's not alone.
Her smile is tight, pinched. "You didn't let me finish. What I was about to add after that disclaimer is that in the case of your mother, some statements which she has made that have struck hard and deep with you have not been manifestations of constructive and nurturing parenting. And the difficult thing is that a child cannot tell those harmful statements and acts apart from good, accurate and wise things. A child soaks up everything, accepts their parents' reality as their own until a process begins of independence and separation. When that process happens in within their life stories varies greatly. Some never embark on such a journey and remain trapped within the emotional framework of the harm done. Those individuals do not rise above that damage done like you have. Like you are in the process of doing. Many things in your complex relationship with your mother have carried over to your relationship with John. An important one to make a note of is the idea that you have no right to burden others with your needs because your very existence is already so taxing for them. This is wrong, Sherlock. Everyone has the right to be heard, to have their feelings acknowledged and understood and respected."
John had offered to open a bottle of wine, which Sherlock had declined on the basis of not using much alcohol. There are few such beverages he enjoys, and the cheap chardonnay John must have purchased from the off-licence in Pierowall would offend rather than delight. Chardonnay, when good, Sherlock finds acceptable; sauvignon blanc with its catpee aroma much less so. Cheap chardonnay tends to have what he'd describe as a subtle half-rotten pineapple tang, which makes him feel as though he's sucking on a cheap ice lolly. Not something to ruin fresh fish with.
"Could you…" Mycroft seems to be deciding how to phrase his request, "…if you might tell me when he's being awakened? There is little point in my presence until then. There are… memories I'd rather not revisit more than I must."
He takes a sip of water, undoes the buttons of his new suit jacket, then second-guesses the decision. Would he look better if he had kept them done?
"––but you will, anyway." Sherlock sounds resigned. "Your preoccupation with food is so dreadfully hidebound."
was used, but I did gather that it was because they suspected a gastric or duodenal ulcer. They explained the findings to me when he was still being monitored after the procedure. A gastric ulcer was, indeed, discovered, which they believed had caused a bleed that had resolved or coagulated by the time the examination was undertaken. A two-month course of proton pump inhibitors was prescribed, and I believe the helicobacterium breath test came back negative."
Edgar opens his mouth, intending to present an answer. Sherlock gives him a venomous glance which snaps his jaw back up.
By the time John comes out of the shower, Sherlock has crawled under the covers, closed his eyes and is pretending to sleep.
He allows himself to be led to the bedroom, and they end up spooning on the bed, his back against John's chest. A kiss is pressed to the crown of his curls, which must look a mess — he'd forgot to pack his hair products for Sussex and will have to do a lot of remedial styling this evening in preparation for work.
In the end, he was just an inconvenient secret, an inconsequential indiscretion. Victor had just been blowing off steam with him, and what they had was as thin as that dissipating vapour. Every fracture, every dent Sherlock had expected naively that Victor would repair once he came to his senses about the nature of their relationship would always remain. In fact, the cracked vessel of their union was nothing but the equivalent of a note in a glass case in a museum left in the place of a removed object. It was a stand-in for something the spectator shouldn't expect to appear within the time they had at their disposal — a promise without delivery. Victor never repaired anything, and now, dead, he'd caused even more carnage somehow.
John sighs. "Do you want me to drive you?" At this rate, Sherlock will walk into a lamppost or worse — into traffic.
Christian drops to his side on the bed. Sherlock mutters a fumbling apology he doesn't mean and climbs off the bed.
You can't concentrate on the telly all night because you can feel the distress emanating from the other room. You need to let him think, but it's hard to see the pain he's been in this whole time escalate because you've taken away its escape hatch.
"That's fine," John promises. "You think I have some master plan, a script in my head when I call you? Think of this as just the two of us, hanging out, remotely."
"The two are not comparable. That's what makes this so frustrating. It shouldn't be happening. It's not fair; kids shrug this off in a couple of days."
"I tend to assume there's always a threat to my position. I have to work hard to keep afloat with things you find quite natural to navigate."
John doesn't need anything more to jog his memory. They'd both been standing, and he'd pinned Sherlock against the back of the sofa. "It was bloody hard to keep up since you're so damned tall."
"Sorry. Guess I'm used to everyone knowing everyone around here outside of the tourist season. I'm John."
"She should have been there, when he we had to… Sometimes I wish… Even if it goes against what GMC says and the Hippocratic Oath and all say about such things, I wish that if a terminal patient ever asked for that, then we could grant it. It probably shouldn't be a doctor who did it or who gave the final permission, but maybe there could be… something. Sometimes we have more sense about how to deal with the suffering and inevitable end of a pet's life then we do about people."
Sherlock arrives twenty minutes later, having taken a bit longer than the walk from Harley Street should be. John elects not to mention the scent of fresh tobacco smoke on his coat as he goes to the door to meet him and give him a kiss on the cheek. They haven't shared any more intense kisses since his surgery; John won't initiate until he starts feeling like his oral hygiene is back to normal. He still hasn't properly brushed his molars for fear it'll disturb the surgical scars. There are no stitches and he'd shed the scabs on day eleven with no bleeding, so the risk of complications is approaching none, but he really doesn't want to poke around in there. Looking at the tonsil removal sites in the mirror tells him little — he has no idea how they're supposed to look at this point. He has an appointment with Collings in four days to decide the length of the sick leave. He knows already that he won't have the energy to be on call for some time, even if he goes back to work in a week.
When he opens the door to their flat, he's surprised to find the lighting dimmed down and a candle on the table. John is just taking a casserole out of the oven when Sherlock walks in. It smells divine and a sneaky peek while he divests of his coat and scarf reveals a perfectly browned, saucy top that looks a lot like Angelo's lasagne. It's not Sherlock's favourite, but barring things with ingredients the texture of which he can't abide, he'll eat nearly anything cooked by the staff there. As decided in Italy, they have tried to pay more attention to what they eat, but on weekends treats and indulges feel very deserved.
Violet leaves it at that, which also surprises John. After Sherlock had invited her to an appointment, she had vocally questioned Sherlock's therapist's competency and impartiality, but at least she'd directed her words at John and not to Sherlock. She had quickly learned, after that one dreadful Christmas, that Sherlock had become serious about no longer tolerating certain behaviours from her.
Is he supposed to call someone? Who would even need to know what’s happening with John? Is there some social protocol here Sherlock may not be aware of? John had done all the communicating and arranging of things regarding his knee, and when he had got shot, there had been no point in wasting time on the phone; Sherlock had taken off to Northolt directly from work to catch a military plane out to Afghanistan.
John's sick leave has lasted precisely four weeks today. He's been taking short walks, cooked dinner, been up all day for the past few days. He won't be taking call for a few weeks more, but he's recovering well.
extrasystolic beat = a beat produced by some other area in the heart than the sinus node which is normally responsible for pacing. These can originate from nearly anywhere in the heart, and the general area of origin can be deduced from what they look like on an ECG.
PPI = proton pump inhibitor, such as omeprazole, is a common type of medication used for reflux symptoms and gastric and duodenal ulcers. I'm not kidding about the prevalence of stress ulcers in the medical community.
John thinks. It's curious how Sherlock often seems clinically detached, even indifferent, to the terrible things people do to each other, but cruelty towards animals is one of his berserk buttons. He won't even watch nature documentaries with a lot of graphic content — even if it's just animals hunting each other. Cruelty towards children is also something he reacts to quite strongly.
The fifth floor visitor lobby is where John has now been sitting for nearly two hours, and he is awfully tempted to start ripping the worn magazines offered as a pastime to shreds out of worry and frustration. He knows Sherlock is fine, but he can't be
"That must have been when they extubated you at the ITU. You were meant to be awake or very lightly sedated when that happened. It's entirely normal to remember something of it."
"That bed ward plan may also demonstrate that your prognostications are not always accurate. Why plan a bed at a ward for a patient likely to expire before ever reaching the ward?"
John and I both burst out laughing, and I turn the photos around to discourage further scrutiny. She's right. My only attempt at Christmas preparations last year, assisted by Mrs Hudson, did produce somewhat… crispy results.
You didn't know he had been offered such things. You just thought that Mike's reply to your email had been the end of that conversation. Maybe that's why Sherlock had asked you to step out during the latest appointment. You'd felt hurt by that request after everything you'd gone through together, but consoled yourself that it was good that Sherlock was taking charge of his health. Little had you known that you might have just been facilitating his continued denial.
