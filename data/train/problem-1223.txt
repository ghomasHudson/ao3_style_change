John sighed and cast a look at the tall figure splashed out in front of him. Enthralled indeed. Sherlock hadn't slept in the four days this case had occupied him, and he would surely not wake until he'd had a good 15 or 16 hour of sleep.
“Yes,” Molly answered. Before she could continue, Mrs Hudson had already gently taken her by the arm and was ushering her towards the stairs. “I have just prepared afternoon tea, if you don't mind I'd love you to sit with me. My god, I haven't seen you in ages! And an old lady like me gets lonely from time to time, you know?”
“C'mooon, Sherlock. I had expected to find you a bit more thrilled, after all, this was a veeery special night for you and Johnny-boy.”
“Upstairs.” Moriarty whistled. He got up in a swift, elegant movement and straightened the cuffs of his suit. “Right where I left him.” A diabolical grin crept onto his lips as he inspected his watch and contorted his face in mocked shock.
John came into Sherlock’s room that night. Sherlock closed his eyes when he kissed John, who had seemed unusually happy this evening, as if their coitus last night had restored his energy levels. John’s hands were gentle, as were his eyes, but his intentions were clear. Sherlock kept his eyes closed when John started kissing a trail down his chest, then his stomach. Sherlock’s breath hitched in his chest. Being raped and abused was one thing, Sherlock thought as his intestines cramped up. But he really, really didn’t want to be touched down
John was, for once, speechless. Mycroft straightened the cuffs of his suit and his tie, until he finally looked up again. “Nonetheless, I did not bring you here to discuss such matters. I must ask you, as much in my brother’s interest as my own; what is your relationship with Mary Morstan?”
The thought drew John to glance over at Greg's blank face, realising with some surprise that his companion had shown no overt signs of comprehension in the minutes since they'd been pulled from the storage room.
"No, everyone's here, but dinner won't be for at least an hour and a half yet. I'm glad you called—yes, Mom, it's Greg. I'll be right back, okay? Yeah—so, how did work go?"
Quirking up an eyebrow, Sally opened her folder and began to read off the basics of the crime. "Eliza and Justine Runnell, sisters aged fifteen and eleven, found dead in a school basement in 2003..."
"And I'm certain that as a soldier, you'll bear up admirably under the onslaught of Mother's small talk," Mycroft said, exactly as if there had been no break in their strange conversation.
"It's my arm," he panted. "I'm—okay. I'm fine." Soon his figure lurched into view; he staggered over and awkwardly used one shoulder against the wall to lever himself down beside Greg.
who loves nothing more than to break into locked buildings and risk my neck while my faithful partner stays shut outside..."
"An impressive claim," Anna said, chuckling. "So why'd you put on such a bad accent, on those first few dates of ours—you know, when we were quoting Kevin Kline at each other, and all?"
John had to give him credit for taking the initiative. It was frustrating and a little unnerving that his aching head was still so muddled, leading him to ask such slow-witted sorts of questions; he appreciated that Greg, at least, seemed to retain most of his focus. Watching the man's slow struggle with a frown, he offered, "If we turn back to back, maybe I can help with it. But it's likely to hurt you more while I'm trying..."
John nearly dismissed the man, then and there, just for the colours he wore. With buff shirtsleeves beneath a khaki tweed vest and olive trousers, he certainly seemed nothing like the stuffy embodiment of the British Government. But although it was informal, it was clearly an impeccably tailored ensemble, and this gentleman seemed to hold himself like a poised peacock, gliding among the common folk...
It was a valid observation. He hadn't worked on Christmas last year, of course, but if he hadn't been in the States, he knew a couple hours at Baker Street would have been the full extent of his celebrations. Greg shrugged, acknowledging her scored point. "Yeah, well, things are different now, aren't they?"
what that impatient prat's got up to." John tapped out a quick text message while shuffling through the various papers and notes left near the workstation.
The older man's balance faltered; John experienced the moment as if in slow motion. The hollow squawk of the bucket scraping against the floor was shockingly loud.
how much I was missing you this week, gorgeous," Anna sighed, leaning wistfully towards the webcam on her side.
The box he'd chosen turned out to be mostly filled with clothing, and he groped idly through it for anything more solid while the phone rang at his ear. His call connected just as he pulled a gold-embossed photo album into his lap.
He chuckled and renewed his efforts to reach the alarm, groping blindly at the table without breaking the kiss, and she responded to the challenge by snaking a leg out from under her dislodged covers, twisting to ensnare his waist and draw him in closer.
Liz said something in response, but it was muffled by the spoon sticking out of her mouth. "Sorry," she tried again after a bit of swallowing, "being the voice of reason makes me hungry. Peanut butter banana sandwich, with marshmallow fluff—want some?"
While he and Greg had waited for Anna's flight at Heathrow, the previous Friday, John had made mention of his concerns with some embarrassment. To his credit, Greg had seemed nearly as discomfited at the idea of having to pick out Christmas gifts for the Holmeses as John was. He did suggest looking for something offbeat and antique, though, and so John had spent his free time over the weekend in a renewed search. Finally, he'd bumbled into a small antique shop. The proprietor there had helpfully informed him of a large estate sale taking place that week. It would be a trek, but Sherlock had already informed him that he planned to spend most of Monday with Anna...so John had decided to go ahead and take the chance.
The mention of children suddenly brought to mind the joke Greg had shared with Ronny earlier, and he realised he hadn't thought to check in before leaving Barts. He reached into the breast pocket of his suit jacket—then the pockets of his coat—then, frowning deeply, he patted down his trousers before starting all over again and hoping for a different result.
He expected that she would appreciate the ethnic textiles and other wildly miscellaneous artifacts exhibited among the anthropological collections, so he escorted her through those areas first, making occasional deductions regarding the original owners of certain items and receiving words of praise and amazement in return. Some time later, they moved on from the baskets, tools and antique police constables' equipment, and proceeded into the Horniman's Natural History gallery, with its massive taxidermied walrus standing sentinel.
"I'm in London, right now. Year-end meetings; boring shite I get roped into when all the higher execs leave the country for holiday. But I have a few hours free for lunch. Thought I'd take a chance, and see if you were available."
had resulted in pressure on Sherlock to escort John to the Yarders' pub night, or the surgery's staff luncheon! Even the brunch that Mummy had arranged in honour of Mycroft's forty-fifth birthday had been easy to sidestep, given the right excuses.
Tension rippled through Sherlock's low growl, but the man lay stiffly unmoving. "I'm angry at an idiot delinquent who likes stealing mobile phones to sell them! I'm upset that Sally won't let me take part in her interrogations! I'm frustrated that Lestrade has been shut up in his office for three days, burying himself in paperwork to make up for having thrown a wrench into the case he's worked a month on, and that the trigger-happy imbeciles on the response squad managed to kill or seriously injure
Sherlock basked in the warmth of the praise, but now that the puzzle was done his mind was drawn once more to his earlier concerns. Closing the now-empty takeaway container, he laced his fingers carefully together on his knees.
Preparations for the holiday have all been made, and there's nothing left to be done. There's plenty of time, however, for Sherlock to amuse himself.
Sarah knew, of course. John had confessed it to her not long after Sherlock's demonstrative reveal to Scotland Yard that June, and while she hadn't already guessed, she'd been unsurprised—almost annoyingly so. Still, John hadn't divulged all that much detail since then about the nature of his partnership with Sherlock; it had always felt as if that would be overstepping one invisible line too many.
It didn't take me long to realise most Yarders had it wrong. Even with Holmes dead, it was clear Lestrade wasn't your average plodder. And when Sherlock
The inspector's face was arranged into a brightly innocent expression when he finally opened the door. "Ah, sorry lads! We were in the kitchen, didn't hear."
Anna's got some big decisions to make; there's a lot on her mind, but she's not alone in sorting through it.
"Yeah, well. It's—" Turning, he saw Anna coming down the stairs, her steps slowing as she met his eyes, trying to determine what she might be interrupting. "It's fine," he continued, rubbing a hand down his face and trying hard to banish the rush of unpleasant feelings. "Don't worry about it, yeh? So. Why'd you call today? I know it wasn't to hear about my breakfast."
Greg pulled off his scarf and the coat he wore awkwardly draped over his left side, laying them atop a stack of still-packed boxes within reach of the door. Similar piles graced every room, and he'd so far hung nothing on the walls to break up the unnerving sense of increased space.
Those months had been difficult for her, too; she knew she could very easily have been reading signs that weren't really there. So she'd never quite found the confidence to ask outright, during their long-distance conversations. ("I'm worried that you're missing me too much" had sounded either egotistical or presumptuous, no matter how she'd considered phrasing it.)
"He usually locks his door, when he's out of the building," Sherlock observed, taking the opportunity to fling himself into Lestrade's cushioned chair and arrange his limbs into a suitably relaxed display.
"Don't fret," Brian murmured as he spread the serviette across his lap, "you're fine. I truly didn't mean to intimidate you, by bringing you here; the owner is an old friend of mine. You won't see it on the menu, but they'll make me an absolutely amazing cheeseburger."
He dipped his head in acknowledgment. "You likely would have discovered this museum on your own, sooner or later. It suits you."
"What are you doing?" Even as he asked, he knew the answer. Greg was testing his bonds, something John hadn't quite worked himself up to in the handful of minutes since he'd jolted himself by shifting across the room. "That's got to be hurting you?"
"I don't need help," John protested automatically, before realising that he'd slipped down into a position on the sofa that left him unable to leverage himself without the use of both arms.
is wrong with me," he said into the air, strapping his sling into place with rough, jerky movements and throwing himself back onto his pillows.
for another day, huh? You were his friend a lot longer than I was, and I'm sure you've already thought a lot about why he did it. So. The things Andy left in this house, the ones that meant something to the two of you. You're going to keep a lot of them with you, when you move, right?"
"Really, it shouldn't wait," he said through not-quite-locked teeth, and reached for the nearest plausible excuse: "I still haven't picked up a Christmas gift for John. You understand."
mail. 'Oh Inspector Lestrade, thank you so much for arresting the awful man who killed my boy.' Or, 'Dear Inspector, me mum saw you on telly an' thinks you're choice. Please write so I can set her up on a hot date with you.' He bloody hates those!"
When John reached 221 and stepped inside, he found Sherlock waiting at the upper landing, holding a cup of tea.
To the ladies at the senior centre, I've become somewhat of a celebrity. My tenants' fame brings endless questions; I answer what I can.
, Anna, you are bloody brilliant," panted Greg, his kisses increasingly urgent, "but are you planning to
Brian wore a crisp and well-tailored navy suit, his fine white button-down paired with a sumptuous-looking green silk tie. By contrast, Anna felt dowdy and underdressed in her fuzzy cable-knit jumper and jeans. She'd heard him say "meetings", but it hadn't even occurred to her to think of what that meant, before she'd already stepped into the cab with him and it was too late to change.
"You have no idea," he grated. "If any of them had hurt you more seriously, if you'd been—the response squad would have been
Visible through the crack was a sliver of a windowless room, in what appeared to be the lower level of a very old building. The walls had been given a plaster treatment, but the dark stone behind it was still visible near the low ceiling. Something in the homely lack of décor, and the scattering of folding chairs and banquet tables, gave John the distinct impression of a community centre or rarely used meeting hall. The modernisation efforts—at least in the basement—seemed to have been limited to a brief effort in the seventies or eighties, judging by the style of the hanging light fixtures. Long fluorescent bulbs flickered almost imperceptibly above severely yellowed plastic panels, lending a sallow, unhealthy tint to the deserted space.
"Yeah, but I needed to get in his drawers." She gestured matter-of-factly with her chin to indicate her full arms. "Filing. Someone has to do it, and he's frankly awful at it!"
Sherlock stared down into the bowl, and John could almost hear his brain calculating the color and consistency. Was it too dark? Was Sherlock going to be force feeding him water?
Sherlock frotted shamelessly against John's wet jeans - had to be getting off on having done that. It didn't take him long to lose all control and become a shivering wreck in John's arms, making even more of a mess of him with his come.  While Sherlock shook and recovered, John kept going with his own hand, pumping fiercely, chasing that sharp ecstasy. In moments, Sherlock's hand came down over his own, and then he was gone over the edge, dropping his head backwards and moaning. Christ, it was intense.
"Finish up that beer quick, John," Sherlock said with a little twinkle in his eye. "And then drink another one quickly. I'm going to go get in the shower. Come and join me when the sound of the rushing water gets to be too much."
“I know you don’t believe. I know you don’t feel that. I know what you’re feelin’ really hurts, though,” John said. For just a moment he let his hand rest on the small of Sherlock’s back, stole a glance at those keen green-grey eyes dimmed with unshed tears. Still stunning. Enhanced not diminished by the lines around them and the salt-and-pepper of his brows. “But I think it’ll help to play for her one more time. She never got tired of hearing us.”
Jamie pointed the gun at John, herding him towards that dark pit. “You want to be with him,” she said, aiming the revolver between John's eyes. Yes. Yes, John really did. He closed his eyes and waited.
Jon was glorious in his finery, sipping from a small glass of their shared bourbon. Eyes locked on each other. Sherlock relaxed his shoulders, tossed his long locs, and lifted the violin up. He started out with a bit of Bach - mathematical and impressive. Memories of childhood lessons, baked in and unforgettable. A bit of brooding Beethoven and melancholy Mahler.
He tensed and tightened and shuddered and came hard into Sherlock's mouth, with Sherlock's hands gripping his thighs, and Sherlock moaning lightly around John's cock in pure sympathy.
Burnwell took it, and gave Holmes the gems. Sad, broken things they were - the settings were bent and the crown had lost its beauty. Fortunately, Sherlock had real paper cash in his pocket, that he would take to the best jewelry fence in New York. That person would be able to seamlessly recreate the crown to its original glory. For the ceremony that would happen two days from now.
"I won this round, John," Sherlock said, strong-arming him up the hill. The brush was still thick, though spiraling leaves from the tulip trees and the hickories swirled around them in the chilly breeze. The full moon veiled and unveiled in clouds.
They had trundled up into the woods, with a picnic lunch packed. By far, the heaviest weight was the coolers, with a huge pitcher of Mrs Hudson's sweet tea and a six-pack of John's favorite beer. They pecked at the sandwiches and chips, talking and laughing. John sipped his beer slowly, while urging Sherlock to drink that cold, sweet, lightly lemon-tinged diuretic with great gusto.
Holder gave Sherlock a stinkeye, and then dropped his head into his hands. "I made one of the worst mistakes of my life. The repatriation decision wasn't popular among the Board. I voted against it myself, through certain proxies. But it prevailed, and we had to live by it. There was so much...disgruntlement...among the staff that I worried someone might try to compromise the board's decision. Although it is strictly against museum policy, I felt that I had enough reasons to be concerned to override that."
Sherlock's eyes fixated on that. The clear delineations of light blue and dark blue. Where John's jeans were wet, and where they weren't. He dropped to his knees, and ran his hands over the relevant areas. Sherlock fell slowly to his knees and crept over to John, and sniffed around him in a way John felt was both erotic and endearing like some weird giant forest creature. Predatory, perhaps, but shy. Some kind of wild cat?
“That’s surprisingly thoughtful of you,” John said. He knew he was starting to get that cow-eyed lovesick look, and he didn’t even mind.
enough yet to resume weekly posting on this one, but I will try to put something up every other week, at least, for the next little while. Possibly on random days. :)
"It turns out I'm free after all, Brian," she reported. "I'd love to see you. How soon should I be ready?"
John was shocked into stillness as the impassioned declaration sank in. Sherlock, too, seemed taken aback at his own vehemence; he briefly tightened his arms around John's torso and took a few deep breaths before quietly changing the subject.
"What about your gut, then? I don't see any stain on your shirt; do you feel any wetness? Is it a sharp or dull pain? Where's the worst of it?"
The vague possibilities of escape seemed hazy, indistinct. John jerked his drooping head upright with a start. "Don't fall asleep," he muttered, an admonishment to his companion as well as himself.
Within the bottom drawer of the wide file cabinet at his left-hand wall there was, in fact, a thick file of such meaningless missives that he'd received over the years, some far more overtly threatening. They came in from criminals he'd busted, from grieving folk who felt their cases hadn't been adequately handled, from random nutters who'd read his name in the papers or seen him on the telly...it was hardly something to get worked up over. Only once in his many years of service in the CID had a nonsense letter led to a
he mused, glancing from the large bowl of fragrant pasta to the smiling faces of the others at the dinner table.
"Damn right it did. Jacqui never thought she'd get to go back to school, let alone make top grades her whole freshman year of college while raising Devon. I'm thrilled for my baby girl," Brewster enthused, half-turning to smile in the same direction as the detective's gaze: the young woman stood in one of the observation ledges, her child seated on her hip, apparently pointing out various city landmarks below to the politely interested army doctor.
Memories clogged John's throat for the space of a breath, but he shoved them back into place. He could save thoughts on Harry for the end of the week, when he was sure to receive her usual package: a garish jumper, and an emotionless note, and another year's yawning chasm gone cold and guilty between them...
Sherlock shrugged minutely. Conversations like this made his skin crawl, even after all this time. Emotional confessions were simply not his area.
It was thrilling, terrifying, even though it was exactly what she'd wanted. All those days of planning, the careful conversations to hash out little details, the paperwork and the meetings with bankers and the huge outlay of postage...it all came down to this. One last trip, giving up one home for the promise of another.
They turned at the rear of the exhibit space, and began to make their way back towards the observation deck area. As they strolled along, Sherlock looked over to surreptitiously gauge the degree of comfort in Brewster's features.
When he entered the sitting room, John wasn't smiling either; he was fiddling with a shiny new phone, regarding it with an air of resigned disappointment. The bruises underlining his eyes had turned a sickly green. "Ah, Greg. You can have Sherlock's chair," he said when he looked up.
Sherlock didn't quite have a clear grasp on exactly how lucky John was to have Sarah as his boss. He seemed to take for granted the flexibility it afforded—or, at the very least, he seemed unable to digest the concept of John's desire to earn a modest income on his own, outside of their joint work.
Had Sarah been more strait-laced in her policies from the start, John was well aware that he wouldn't have kept his employment there for more than a few days. Dozing off on the job was generally frowned upon, after all. She wouldn't have dated him, either, or at the very
Anna brushed a hand over one of the flower husks, considering. "To keep me in the cab. But why?" She looked up, surprised to see that he'd stopped on the doorstep and turned to watch her, leaning against the little wall there with an enigmatic smile.
Hearing the words startled Greg back to reality. Caught up in his thoughts, he hadn't even noticed when the phone at his ear had gone quiet. "Hello, I'm still here," he said, a little sheepishly.
Brewster had, of course, been speaking of the dubious pleasure of being a new grandparent, and the fear of losing custody of the child. But those words had resonated with Sherlock at the time, pulling a sympathetic vibration from his core that had severely shaken the carefully constructed mask of his alias. He suddenly remembered—more clearly than he expected to—how tightly he'd gripped the pint glass between his palms, and how his voice had cracked even as he'd kicked himself firmly and unforgivingly back into character.
They cursorily washed each other, and stumbled out before the stream turned to ice. Shivering, they looked each other over - wet and naked and trying not to slip on the tile. Laughing.
After a long day, Mrs. Hudson made her way back into her book and record store, now safely closed to the public at this late hour. She tidied up, spent a good hour rearranging things long misplaced, and then finally let her shoulders un-tense and relax. This was her favorite place, her sanctum. She thought long and hard about what she really wanted to hear, and drew out one of her favorite albums:
If Holder caught the shade, he gave no indication. "I only wanted to keep it secure. There’s no one there but longtime trusted help and my sweet niece Mary. But - my son. My Arthur. He's been in trouble in the past - led astray by bad companions, of course. There was an issue with drugs when he was in college."
Jon had an unusually uneventful shift at the hospital. Only a few heart attacks, and one biking accident. No fatalities. He felt his phone buzzing in his scrubs, and was so relieved to be able to take it out. Holmes had sent him a funny video of a crow and a puppy playing.
John's vocabulary shorted out as he was wrenched a little upward to give Sherlock's skillful hand room to work on his cock, pumping and vibrating mercilessly until John came with a broken, breathless shout. The night outside erupted too: celebratory pops and bangs of firecrackers and gunshots. Might have set a vet off in a bad way if he weren't drifting in hormonal bliss beneath Sherlock, who nuzzled him contently.
want a grandson of a coal miner to eat Russian caviar off my nude body in a secret underground bunker."
It should have been creepy when Sherlock's hand reached around his hip and placed his hand directly around John's, holding his soft cock as he pissed out his last, giving him a light shake, and then reaching over for a scrap of toilet paper to wipe the head, so very gently and with a level of attention that was almost reverent. But it wasn't. On some level that John was still too sleepy to even fully think about, it was almost...nice. He felt comforted. Cared for.
Jon sat back against the window, clearly thinking. Then his voice dropped, as if he didn't want the driver to overhear. "I think it is for you, though, isn't it? You want to see me looking fine because
He was still hungry, and tired, but when he entered St Bartholomew's he had a spring in his step. Before he even reached the lifts, he recognised John's figure up ahead of him. The doctor was walking slowly with his sandy head bent low over his phone, and a few thick books tucked under one arm.
would turn out wonderfully," John muttered, reaching down to brush his fingers over an ornately embossed spine:
After dismissing the older man with a few more empty pleasantries, Sherlock moved across the room, sidestepping neatly around the few clumped groups of tourists. He saw Jacqui turning away from the glass, just as he approached; she looked up from whatever instruction she was giving her son, and offered him a shy half-smile and nod before taking the boy's hand and leading him away. Sherlock was grateful she didn't stop to talk to him; he wasn't sure he had it in him to attempt further conversation, after having endured so much of Brewster's idle chat.
The atmosphere within New Scotland Yard in the days leading up to Christmas was a strange blend of expectancy and tension. Half of the people Sherlock passed were buckling down to try and clear their workload before they took the holiday; the other half were working to prepare themselves for a tough few days of increased duty—not everyone could take the time off. Not everyone wanted to.
I had a thing, and I got sick of holding onto the thing in hopes that I would magically have more of the thing left afterwards. :P
"Better not be Oxfam again. It was hell getting off their list after Dimmock convinced me to donate," Greg muttered.
"Well," said John, reaching out to finger the lapels of Sherlock's dressing gown, "if you're sure I can't convince you to come along..."
John's clearly amused voice cut through the rapidly rising fog of their distraction. "Take a doctor's advice, and at least try to breathe once in a while, all right?"
The door from the hall opened once more, and the counterfeiters' apparent leader stalked in. He was jowly and heavy-set, perhaps a few years older than Greg, with lacklustre grey hair that flopped down over his forehead. Another man followed after him, closing the door as he came. John recognised this man as the fifth participant from the fight; he sported a black eye that must have come to him courtesy of Lestrade, because John didn't remember putting it there.
—? Right, okay, you know what, I'm not going to pretend that makes any sense to me. I'll just leave you to it, shall I?" With these words, John gestured vaguely at the wall above the sofa, which Sherlock had spent the morning gradually adorning with papers and photographs.
"Nothing too important," he answered mildly, hitching himself slightly to the side as a harried-looking young constable bustled through, loaded down with papers. "Just filling time, really."
"I suppose you've got a point. Lestrade still hasn't quite managed to adjust; I keep catching him looking around with an expression incredibly like a lost dog, after he's come into a room fully prepared to scold you and me for arguing," Sherlock chuckled.
Unfamiliar with the name, he opened it up. The title page proclaimed it a second edition copy, printed in 1807. It was in excellent condition, John noted as he flipped through a few pages near the back; when densely packed footnote print gave way to centred text, his attention was caught. In the middle of a series of dry and offhand notes about thermal circulation and the chemical production of gases, there was a
He shook himself back to the reality of the present. Chatting, yes. "So. What about you, Mycroft? What's a Holmes family Christmas really like?"
"Completely. Don't worry, all of the books are wildly inexpensive, today; clearly the executor has no idea what they're selling in this collection. I've already purchased a larger gift suitable for Sherlock's derision, at any rate."
"I'm telling you, those results of yours can't possibly be right," Sally was stubbornly repeating. "I'm inclined to believe Holmes on this one. The theory
There was a long pause. Anna waited for her friend to continue speaking, or to return to the living room; when neither of these happened, she made a frustrated sound in her throat and got up to follow.
"All right," Greg said softly. Now that they were close, they didn't have to strain to whisper across the room. "Broken, you think?"
They exchanged a thin smile, and for a few minutes they returned to mutually ignoring each other's presence, although they continued through the room side by side like casual companions.
"It's been years, now. But, yes." He'd visited a few times during the more unfettered years of his young adulthood, taking advantage of the free admission to spend time among the various stimulating exhibits. And later on, after he'd found his calling in detective work... "One case I solved for a private client involved a number of unidentified and mixed avian bones. I spent an afternoon or two here for comparative examination. It's quite a well-maintained collection."
"Well, look at yourself! You're still wearing the T-shirt you slept in, and the trousers you put on this morning are the ones you spilled bleach on last month. Surely you aren't planning on going out in public like that."
"Well, it's all quite exciting, isn't it?" asked Charlotte. There was that unidentifiable lilt in her voice, again. He wished he were there in person; he'd always been far better at reading people when he could watch their faces.
I see Doctor Watson. Crutch, limp: minor sprain. Sherlock with their luggage, brisk, eager—they move together. Brushing shoulders, tilting heads. Unprecedented tenderness.
John moaned a low growl as he finally came, pushing himself into Sherlock as hard as he could, spilling all his being into the man beneath him. He stayed in that position for a few seconds, trying to get his breathing under control and wriggling his dick around in Sherlock's ass to draw out the last bit of pleasure. Sherlock was sobbing, quietly so, but John could tell from the way his body shook.
“We're close right now.” Sherlock pouted like a child, but the way he still averted his eyes made it plainly clear he got the message. John's erection seemed to make him uncomfortable, but if John noticed, it didn't show.
He realised someone was in the room before his eyes had even adjusted to the darkness. The sun hadn't yet risen, and he could barely make out the shapes of his surroundings. Before he had even made a first conscious decision he was on his feet, John's Sig Sauer was in his hand, and he pointed it at the unknown intruder with both hands. The figure froze, raising their hands. His. It was a male, not especially tall. Military background.
“I am aware your relationship with my brother goes deeper than that.” Mycroft finally said. The discussion had turned way too personal for his liking. “But I must ask you to tread with caution. He’s been through a lot.”
“John,” Sherlock rasped. He was propped up against John with his right hand cautiously caressing the other man's face. He bent down for a kiss. John kissed back.
Silence ensued. John was starting to wonder if Sherlock had dropped a hint he had missed, something of enormous importance. Had Victor been too affectionate? Too-
For just a second John seemed to hesitate. Then he continued his way up the stairs towards his room, and for once Sherlock was glad neither of them could see the other’s face.
“John. Forgive me.” He threw the gun away, but John still looked shaken. It landed on the floor a few feet from him, and its metallic noise rang through the silence between them. He tried again. “I didn't mean to...”
For a while, he had contemplated getting married to Mary, just to see Sherlock’s face when he would announce it. He could even make him his best mate or something, it was such a delicious idea. But not even he was that cruel.
“Do you believe it, Sherlock?”, John repeated, and this time, Sherlock didn’t dare make a sneaky remark. “You really believe I could – do - have done this?” John’s voice hitched at the last part, but Sherlock didn’t respond. Silence ensued. When he finally looked at John, his jaw was tight, and he shook his head.
Sherlock had devised it, then, as a possible means to shed light on a particularly opaque cold case of Lestrade's...but his work at that time had been hindered by distraction. When John had run off to New Zealand with Sarah Sawyer, Sherlock had been left alone for two weeks. Dissatisfied with the thought of taking small cases by himself, bored and dispirited without their stimulation, and unsettled by the awkward tension that had built up in the fortnight following the incident with Moriarty at the pool, Sherlock had practically begged Lestrade for a worthy puzzle to solve. The case he'd received, as it turned out,
He glanced back over his head to see Sherlock standing in the doorway, an open bathrobe highlighting more than covering his nakedness. Watching intently.
“Then I'll handle it,” John said, reaching under the pillow where he knew that .38 was kept, and nudged up Sherlock's weight enough to place it on the nightstand.
"You're going to need at least one, probably more," Holmes said, completely reasonably. "And part of this is yours. Fair and square."
John barely registered the doctor's touch on his arm. It was intrusive. It was pushy. Why was this man touching him? Bad news was bad enough. Why was he calling him Captain? He wasn't there. He didn't understand.
"Sure did."There passed a long moment. Turkey buzzards kettled overhead, their dark feathers catching the golden evening sun.
John breathed it in with his eyes, his whole soul rejoicing. He heard Sherlock coming up behind him, and sighed and settled as Sherlock's hands slid around his belly and drew him close.
"Three minutes into the last track," he said. "I didn't mean to impose, I just wanted to hear the music."
John gets a little payback when Sherlock falls asleep at an inopportune moment. Rated E. 221B format drabble.
She was rewarded. He sat back, suddenly struck speechless, his hand that was toying with one of his locs had gone still - and that in itself was worthwhile.
"I know I made you listen to Fleetwood Mac all the way back from Rockford, all night long, man, and you were mostly good about it. Remember 'Rhiannon'"?
"Correct." Oh no, did he look wistful? Anyone might be, for their wasted youth. Sherlock himself had evidently been a lot of people's favorite wasted youth. "He was well-connected, I was working on several cases with ties to places that he had better access to than I. New York City is a gathering place where a lot of the dregs of the world empty, but even then I knew there was possibly just as much exciting criminality out in the hinterlands, on the open road. So for the sake of the science of deduction, I accepted a temporary arrangement of mutual advantage."
Sherlock still sat in John’s chair when the front door fell shut. He still sat there when John finally came home, and was completely ignored be Sherlock. After a few, entirely futile attempts at conversing, John finally shrugged, pressed a chaste kiss onto Sherlock’s hair and went into the kitchen to prepare some dinner for the two of them. Wednesdays were odd.
Liz rested her hips against the edge of the worktop, crossing her ankles casually, and fixed her friend with an expectant stare made only slightly comical by the smear of marshmallow on one cheek. When Anna entirely failed to follow, she rolled her eyes and smirked.
up, of course—wanted to leave room for changes—ah, but it looks a lot better now, furnished. More welcoming. I should've thought to send pictures this week."
"It's probably best to assume I've no idea what all needs doing, yeh? You just tell me what you need from me, darling, and I'll be right there with you," he assured her.
Enjoying her coffee, and its palliative effect on her very mild hangover, Anna sat perched on one of the stools at the peninsula. It had quickly become one of her favourite spots in the new flat. For one thing, the vantage point offered a truly lovely view of her intended's backside while he worked near the stove, clad in a comfortable jumper and jeans.
Invariably, John would pretend he had been woken, mumbling and yawning before rolling into a comfortable position; almost certainly, Sherlock knew it to be an act. They never spoke of it.
It was half past five on Sunday, and Greg stood in the kitchen, chopping vegetables for a stir-fry to the rhythm of his cheerful, mostly tuneless whistling. The interruption of his ringing phone sent a high note trailing off like a cartoon character falling from a cliff; craning his head around, he saw that Anna hadn't yet returned from the loo, so he couldn't ask for an extra hand...
It wasn't, of course; the envelope was plain and unremarkable, labelled only with his name and New Scotland Yard's mailing address in simple block printing. All incoming correspondence was scanned six ways to Sunday before coming into the building proper, so Greg didn't hesitate in slicing it open. His rarely-used letter knife was a gaudy old thing of brass and dark wood, one of the few mementoes passed to him upon DI Harwood's retirement; he absently stroked its handle with his thumb as he unfolded and read the terse, unsigned note.
For a moment, he felt something almost akin to guilt at having asked John to spend so much time with him outside that afternoon; though it had been markedly warmer, the aerodynamics of Chicago's downtown streets always gave the lake-bound wind a harsher bite. The feeling was dismissed almost immediately, however.
On the ride across town, Greg did his best to calm his friend's temper, but John was in no mood to be soothed. Despite Greg's efforts, John was still actively seething when their cab pulled up to the darkened and downtrodden Southfields commercial strip indicated on Sherlock's hastily scrawled note.
"We did! I really enjoyed myself," she answered him, turning beneath his arm to face Sherlock with twinkling eyes as she said it.
"Chaz. Sweetie. It's fine," Anna laughs. "She can stay these few months while I pack up the house. Assuming Philly can wait that long."
This chapter takes us back in time before moving forward, beginning the day before Greg's actions in Chapter 3. Just wanted to point it out in case anyone gets confused.
one was the only time I ever saw him crack. Turned out he'd had two younger sisters who died around that age. Carbon monoxide from a dodgy furnace, I gather, but Jim was the one who'd come home and found 'em." Greg grimaced, remembering. "He pushed our team—and himself—harder than he'd ever done, on this case, trying to prove it was Mitchell Beaux."
But his request—a minor appropriation of CCTV surveillance, one street, one evening—wasn't for himself. The explanation: unselfish, utterly sentimental.
"Twinkle, twinkle," John mumbled quietly around his bite of pastry, walking into the sitting room and settling into his chair with a sigh.
he mused, turning his gaze from the ceiling to Sally's lowered head with a sudden and disconcerting sense of uneasy nostalgia.
he grumbled silently, clicking his pen next to his ear. As much as he enjoyed the various trappings of having subordinate officers—the comradeship and teamwork, the sense of comfortable authority, the occasional opportunity to be a mentor of sorts—there were few tasks less pleasant in Greg's mind than analysing those subordinates' faults and foibles. And he'd learnt years ago that turning in spotless, glowing reviews was in no way kosher.
"He popped over to Bart's; Molly had something he needed, to close out that body in the park from yesterday. He'll be back shortly."
. Really." She began to extend a hand towards him, seemed to think better of it, then reconsidered a second time and patted him gently on the arm, dropping her hand to rest on the seat between them. Then she turned to look out the window again, watching the approach of sunset.
Truly, Anna was not brilliant but certainly intelligent, not exceptional but undeniably interesting—all in all, a surprising and wholly unexpected source of comfort.
"John was telling me about the antique shops he went exploring, the last few weeks," she told them. "One in particular, he said the owner was really helpful; I thought maybe I'd go sometime next week and take a look. It would be great to find something for upstairs, to bring that bedroom together and do something with the wasted space. A pretty vanity table, or maybe a wardrobe..."
Shrugging, he turned to retrieve the paper chart he'd drawn. He stepped up onto the sofa to pin it neatly into place, then sat in the centre of the coffee table to gaze thoughtfully at the wall. His morning's results joined a similar graph, depicting data from an earlier iteration of this same experiment—originally undertaken in the late spring of 2010.
"That meant as an insult?" she grunted, settling herself on her knees next to the long filing cabinet and pulling out the lowest drawer.
Still...Sherlock's insistence upon remaining home, today, had clearly crossed some line in John's expectations. Apparently it wasn't enough to fulfil the myriad concrete requirements of romantic partnership, one on one. Everyone who made any difference (and many who didn't) already knew they were together; belabouring the point served no purpose as far as Sherlock could see—and yet, needless as it was, it appeared that socialising with friends
The last bright rays of the afternoon's sunlight slanted across the dining room table, catching tiny sparkling specks in their path. Anna found herself captivated; she felt oddly numb, as if large wheels were turning within her mind, moving thoughts too obscure for her to parse...
He tilted his head. "If you really want to handle patients today, why don't you just take Barry's? You don't have to worry about me."
She gave John a quick hug and snagged her handbag from his care, and the three of them started off towards the bustling claims hall. When she began to release Greg's hand to detour into the loo, he pulled her back for one fast, searing kiss before letting her go.
"No, I know you are. And it's not just her, it's Greg! He asked. If 'friend' isn't an accurate term for Anna, in your opinion, I've got no idea what you consider
It was still a novelty, being able to speak with his older brother this easily, teasing and joking back and forth without malice. Back in July, when they'd met for that first stilted, awkward dinner after his birthday, Greg hadn't really held out much hope for the improvement of their relationship. But both John and Anna had encouraged him not to give up, and Greg rather suspected that Frankie had given similar advice to her husband. They'd talked a few more times with slightly better results; then Brian had come in from Cambridge and stayed for most of a weekend in late September, to help Greg with packing up his flat for the move. It had taken a great deal of alcohol to loosen their tongues, and quite a few angry and emotional words had been exchanged, but they'd managed to come out on the other side with the air mostly cleared between them.
"All right," answered John, but he narrowed his eyes and studied Greg for a long moment before saying, "You invited me out—invited yourself in, whatever—but I guess I just assumed I knew what would be on your mind. If I was wrong, I'm sorry. What's going on?"
Giggling, she released her hold long enough for him to lift himself farther and smack the button. When the buzzing ceased at last, he collapsed atop her dramatically, burying his face at the side of her neck with a relieved sigh.
"What are you on about, now?" He stepped up close and reached over her head to the cabinet where he kept the sesame oil; it was an easy excuse for a casual touch, and she leaned back into him for a second with a content sigh.
"Anna! Get in here and take this honey-tongued darling off my hands, before I decide to emigrate! ...Goodnight, Greg."
"That's great," was his warm response, and then his attention was on Sherlock, too. "Sticking around, Sherlock? Come in, let me fix you a cuppa."
Perhaps John saw Sherlock's unexpected focus on this—an obvious cold case, and one they'd never before discussed—as a premeditated avoidance tactic. Perhaps he thought that Sherlock had brought it out as a way to deliberately distance himself from other people...or even from John himself.
a memory of Chicago that should be first on the list of the unpleasantness he wanted gone...the moment he'd first slipped, the bitter longing that had choked him, the stabbing pain as the American's words had touched something he'd buried deep inside.
After a pause, Brian answered in a tone that somewhat approximated his earlier joviality. "I wanted to get us all on the same page for next week. We're doing Christmas at my place..."
A year ago, if anyone had tried to tell him that this would be the state of things, he'd have laughed in their face. And even after the game-changing events in Chicago, every move John had made for months had felt like a tightrope act.
"Yeah, Sherlock mentioned that. I can only imagine, with them having wasted over an hour tracking down your phone and chasing its signal all the way to Hackney, only to find a clueless drunk kid? I'll bet they pulled out
—" He stiffened at the sound of approaching voices, offering amorphous thanks to any available deities that the group hadn't returned while he and Greg had been making noise.
John Watson gazed out over the city, his eyes remote. Sherlock's sudden proximity failed to break his intense concentration: the detective glanced out to follow the direction of his gaze, and saw nothing of great interest to draw such scrutiny. No—what the man was watching must be something else, some
John shrugged, smiling faintly down at the bedraggled mix of books. "Maybe, once. It's still important to me, sure. But the Watson family...we've got a history of bad things happening on Christmas."
"Right. Right," Greg mumbled in reply, his voice starting off a bit fuzzy as well. "Wouldn't want 'em coming back and catching us napping, would we?"
"In the message. I was so angry—God, I don't even know why I was so angry—and here he'd gone and done the safe thing, and asked me to wait for him...and he said
The more open and airy style of decorating was very much in line with Anna's old life, oddly enough, and she'd been perfectly comfortable with it then; her home in Columbus with David had boasted high, skylit ceilings and great expanses of clean beige carpeting. But since then, she'd spent months in the cozy mess of the little Chicago house. Surrounded so closely with her own things and the things her old friend Andy had left, and later Liz's belongings as well, she'd become happily accustomed to clutter. It seemed odd to have so much less of it, now.
"It was that, or nothing." Greg tried to keep a tight rein on his emotions as he explained. "D'you think I was simply minding my own business, the other night? Out for a nice evening stroll, when the gang we'd been after for a month just
a surprise; now, though, he found himself glancing around for cameras or mysterious attachés. Finding no obvious signs of a setup, he returned his attention to Mycroft, only to see that the man had actually taken a few steps farther along the bin, as if attempting to escape conversation. While this had, in fact, been John's first impulse, seeing it from Mycroft produced an almost perverse desire to do exactly the opposite.
"Actually, I do still need to find things for some of Greg's family." She twisted her mouth to one side in thought. "Let's swing over to the gift shop before we leave, okay? Greg's niece might get a kick out of a reproduction duct flute, or a kalimba..."
At that, thankfully, John seemed to regain his common sense somewhat. Blinking up at Greg's worried expression, he allowed Greg to pull them backwards a pace towards the nearest wall.
Standing together, they performed a slow circuit of the space. It was perhaps inefficient, but staying in close proximity allowed them to keep up a steady stream of quiet commentary. Though Greg still clearly seemed the more alert of their pair in terms of his speech patterns, he stumbled a little as they went along, and tended to use the walls to supplement his balance. John watched his shadowy form worriedly.
Sherlock turned the delicate stem of the glass between his fingertips, tilting it upward to let light catch in the facets of the bowl and glow through the deep red wine. With the moving play of light, a spectrum of alternative possibilities spread instantly before his eyes, fragmentary and sparkling within a hundred blood-red rainbows:
I do hope Anna isn't easily scared away. She balances him beautifully. I can already imagine her as a daughter.
"Certainly, Mr Holmes; as I said on the phone earlier, I'm happy to help if I can. This doesn't have to do with that nastiness from before, does it? Thought you said that was all handled, here in town anyway, before you bleached your hair in my sink and ran off."
Lestrade had made one or two attempts to provide such advice, even after the change in subject. Most notably, he'd suggested, "I think we'll be better off, all three of us, once we can put that night behind us. Pack it away somewhere, with all the other stuff we've survived, yeh?"
Even as his analytical mind worked to quickly label and file away snapshots of the expressions, Sherlock found himself significantly distressed at the idea of experiencing so many conflicting sentiments at one time. Never mind that he had, of course, experienced simultaneous contradictory emotions himself, quite frequently of late. It was a truly uncomfortable state of being: one that he invariably ignored, or shoved into the deeper recesses of his head.
"Happy Tuesday, Anna! Um, sorry I didn't stay dressed to call you, I was well and truly knackered..."
The concept of sex, in any of its various forms, had been far less threatening when Sherlock could still consider the entire situation as an unlikely hypothetical. Even when it had appeared his friend would be coming around at any moment—early in the twelve week period following his confession during the forged weapons case, before John's prolonged silence on the subject had begun to instill doubts regarding the eventual outcome—it had been easy to gloss over the concept. After all, Sherlock wasn't a virgin, whatever cutting insinuations his brother insisted upon making at his expense. Victor and Emmeline had been the experimental baseline he'd required, years ago, and although none of the activities he had undertaken with either of them had been exactly
Greg has good timing: my phone buzzes as I'm peeling off bloody gloves for an overdue break. It's case related, not a friendly hello, but I don't mind. He's always focused like that. I check files, reply, then walk upstairs.
At the start of their brief association, "Harris" had held his new acquaintance at a healthy distance; however, Verrone's lieutenant had caught wind of an unfortunate rumour, and downtown Chicago had quickly become exponentially less safe. The unique nature of his circumstances had required that he impose further upon the man; Brewster's benevolent sociability, at first seeming so incredibly insipid, had provided a dangerously tantalising taste of certain sorely missed comforts. It seemed only fitting, somehow, that the first man in nearly two years to press Sherlock to eat and sleep, and to bandage wounds he could not  reach, should be given the scant favour of knowing whom he had helped.
When Greg returned from work that night, the hush inside his flat was nearly overpowering. Pocketing his keys, he stood just inside the door for a long minute, taking stock of the unfamiliar surroundings.
In the sudden silence, Anna looked across at Brian with a new appreciation, feeling a sort of manic giggle pressing against the back of her tongue.
Still limping along with this one, very very slowly, but I figure I should try and update it at least once in a blue moon...
Two seconds passed, three; Lestrade's hand remained clasped firmly over Sherlock's forearm until Sherlock released a breath and stopped trying to get through.
She hesitated, tipping her head backwards to feel his breath across her cheek. The moment felt exquisite, like spun glass, and she couldn't help prolonging the tantalising tension of it. Greg seemed caught up in its spell, too; slowly, he drew his touch up, along her shoulder, down her arm and ever-so-delicately over the back of her hand, until his fingers rested along hers over the brass latch.
They reached a wide stairwell, where Sherlock urged him to sit before calling out imperiously for one of the nearby officers. Soon his coat and shoes had been restored to him—the sight of Sherlock kneeling to tie his laces for him made John's throat tighten painfully—and then he was led briskly upstairs and outside into the rain, the arm about his shoulders rigid and trembling.
somehow, even though she knew much of it was surely the excitement of her first days back and the upcoming holiday. Greg's friends—
Sherlock made a mental note to consume something before the end of the day, to appease the man. He was certain the opportunity would arise before their evening's meeting with Brewster; they would, after all, need to reconvene with Greg and Anna in advance of it. Not immediately, though. He wanted to give Anna as much of the day as possible to herself, in recompense for imposing upon her during the night. As well, he found himself embarrassed at the thought of being back in her presence so soon, knowing what she now knew.
"I'm spacing 'em out. Got enough of my own stuff to get through—Anna's, I open when I need a mood lifter." He smiled at Sherlock's hesitation. "Nah, go on ahead. Look like you could use cheering up; your results may vary, of course."
It's a quiet day, a perfect chance for Anna to adjust to her new home...and an opportunity to accept an unexpected invitation.
"This is gonna sound stupid, but I'm worrying about Anna." Greg lifted a hand and wiped it across his eyes. "Today's Thursday, she'll have been out with Chaz Garvey all evening; sometimes she texts me, or calls, so I know she got back in all right..."
Greg's eyebrows rose as the argument reached its apparent peak. "Well, those are some interesting obscenities...Now the first one's done. Dunno if he left, or if he's just shut up." A door slammed, and he looked in again. "Five in the room, now. The light-haired one who hit you with the pipe, and an older bloke we haven't seen."
Such a relief, when Sherlock finally called. We made reservations right away; I had Cliff's tux cleaned.
"See? No signatures, three or four words, 'you were listening' or 'I know you know,' that sort of nonsense. Someone's been watching bad films."
Anna knew that sometimes, Greg truly appreciated her offers to lend her ear. At other times he simply didn't feel up to discussing the things he saw in the course of his duties, though, and she really couldn't blame him.
John was trying to keep a level head about things, but his emotions kept running away with him. Every rational assessment of their situation morphed halfway through into nauseated self-blame.
he is," he growled softly, and drew breath to call out for Sherlock—the hair on the back of Greg's neck prickled and he reached forward to lay a warning hand on John's shoulder.
Sherlock leaned down and placed a precise, gentle kiss on the wind-reddened apple of John's cheek, then stepped back to allow him space to remove his coat. As soon as it was hung, he pressed the mug into John's chilled hands. "Mm. Yes, of course, let's see. One case of eczema, two patients with respiratory ailments, at least two whose complaints were imagined...and, ah—you were called upon to stitch one minor wound, probably a kitchen accident. All in all, boring enough to spur you into returning home on foot."
She had both hands full of brightly coloured silk, trying to decide whether to fill her first cabinet by manufacturer numbers or separate the threads by shade, when the phone rang. Rushing to juggle all the skeins into one hand, she reached for the phone and answered without looking.
Anna replied distractedly as she bustled around behind him, pulling marinated chicken from the fridge and setting the wok to heat. "No, I don't mind at all! There were some things I wanted to get Fran's advice on, it'll be good to have a sit-down with her. And I don't want to ask, yet, but seeing the kids will be a good opportunity to gauge their interest..."
Certainly, their rapport was much improved, of late—but Brian still had trouble remembering which buttons not to press. Greg slipped off the stool, taking a few restless steps into the living room; his shoulders were suddenly tense as he said, "Can you not, please?"
"Upon re-examination, I found that my original theory was sound. It simply required a clarification in my testing procedure, to make the data gel," he explained airily, without turning around, as if his rare admission of defeat were so easily erased from memory. "This should be enough proof to obtain a warrant for Mitchell Beaux before tomorrow afternoon. If you hurry, Lestrade, you can bring the killer in well before the new year!"
from her, since, never mind keeping his job.) And after everything in John's life had fallen apart—after he'd spent over a year in mourning and then shambled back into her surgery, severely sleep-deprived and desperate for a way to make some use of himself? She'd had no good reason to hire him back; any doctor with a modicum of common sense would have turned John away, at that point. Sarah had merely asked him to wait two more months to get himself together before coming in for his first shift.
John grunted. "He's here. This is the place, I can feel it. C'mon, there's surely a way around back." Off he went around the corner, slinking quickly into the gloom with the grim determination of a soldier, and after a second's nervous hesitation Greg hurried along after him.
The implications were becoming clearer with every step he took, but John was afraid to continue studying his vague feeling of discontent. He'd spent so long convincing himself that simply having
He and Sherlock weren't really talking much at all about the mechanics of their relationship. They'd achieved a beautiful sort of equilibrium, an ebbing and swelling tide of domestic contentment that had carried them through months of pleasant days and nights. There seemed to be a mutual understanding at play, the two lists upon which they'd tacitly agreed:
chance his observations were off; but he was fairly sure of himself in this, his own constructed science. He'd most certainly seen the echoes of regret, delight, sadness, and anger...
There was no answer from the silent flat. He was still searching for one within his whirling thoughts as he slipped into sleep, exhausted.
Lestrade glanced at it, then up at him. "Ah, you chose one of hers. Not surprised." Quirking up one corner of his mouth, he reached into the back pocket of his jeans and handed across a small penknife.
"And, you've slept very poorly, the last three nights. This is hardly a suitable occasion to leave you unattended. I've gone without before, many a time; I can skip it."
Sherlock covered the remaining two blocks to the river at a fast pace, so wrapped in his consternation that he failed to fully discern his surroundings until he came up hard against the stone railing at the beginning of the bridge's pedestrian walkway. With a startled huff of breath, he leaned on his forearms out over the barrier, bracing one foot between the bulbous carved balusters, and stared out over the river as he tried to reorder himself.
"At least it looks like you ate something," he noted. "Wherever you are." He lifted the plastic and snagged one for himself; as he turned in place with it, his eyes finally slid to the calendar he kept clipped to the side of the fridge.
