Dean sighed and ran a hand through his already sleep-crumpled hair. Sam was right, though he was loath to admit it. He couldn’t keep up as he was, pushing Cas away because of his own insecurities. He was a grown man – he was capable of pretending he hadn’t repeatedly jerked off to his best friend’s sex tape without his permission, even if it killed him.
Dean Winchester was a man of many rituals for someone who swore they had so little faith. He always took the bed closest to the door in motel rooms. He always unpacked his clothes and laid the next day’s outfit out, no matter how little time he and Sam spent in any particular place. Every Thursday, no matter where they were or what trouble they were in, he fieldstripped all of his weapons and made the adequate repairs before doing anything else.
In his focus, it took him a few moments to realise his phone was ringing, and then another few seconds of fishing around in Baby’s nooks and crannies to find where it had disappeared. It was under his thigh, of all places, and, assuming it was Sammy again, he hit
He forced himself to take another couple of deep breaths, pressing his hand to his chest in the hope of alleviating some of the ache that was building there. It didn’t work, but he felt a little more grounded as he continued to breathe.
“Fifteen, maybe twenty minutes away?” Dean guessed as he checked his rear-view mirror and then peeled away. “You all done?”
With a rattling sigh, Castiel rose onto unsteady feet, and only then did Dean realise he was hunched, protecting the right side of his body.
Emmie and Lilah had immediately squealed their agreement, and launched into a debate about what to tell their parents. Dean had listened quietly as their plans became more and more elaborate – “What if I tell
. He didn’t understand why his brain even put together the similarities between gay actors and Cas – Cas was one of the least sexual people he knew. The guy had had sex, what, once? In how many millennia? It was wrong of him to even equate Cas in the same
“Does the permission count if I texted it to him?” Cas asked, effectively cutting off every train of thought Dean had ever had.
Castiel did as he was asked, moving his arm out to the side while Dean fished around for some gauze pads and tape in the first aid kit. There weren’t many, but he managed to just about cover the whole thing with a couple spare for the wounds at his back. All the while, Castiel remained still and silent above him, and when Dean was done and glanced up to make sure he was alright, he realised he was staring down at him with an unreadable expression.
. The reassurance seemed to solidify something in Cas, though, because he took a fortifying breath and nodded his head, reaching out to clasp Dean on the shoulder.
“Okay, junk doesn’t matter, gotcha,” Dean cut him off, voice little more than a squeak, and Castiel frowned.
“What’s Cas?” the man himself asked, having appeared over Dean’s shoulder from some depth of the bunker. “Hello, Dean.”
better whatsoever. “I updated my location settings while you were showering, and have had a number of matches –“
, and Dean hadn’t realised until right that second how much the thought of Sam finding out had been weighing on him. He’d known, logically, that Sam had no reason to care who Dean was attracted to, but to actually hear it felt entirely different.
“Good to know,” Dean nodded his head, body bristling with adrenaline. “Okay, I’ll call if none of that works.”
They stepped silently into the house, only to be met with… nothing. No cold spots, no weird sensations. The inside was actually in surprisingly good condition, considering it had supposedly been abandoned for six months – old fashioned in its furnishings, but, hey, old people liked what they liked. It was also suspiciously dust free, however, which immediately set alarm bells ringing in Dean’s head.
“We thought maybe Gloria’s spirit was still hanging around, but other than salting and burning the bones, or maybe finding a cursed object connected to her, we don’t really know where to start with the other stuff,” he admitted, and rubbed a hand across his face. “None of the witnesses mentioned cold spots or ghost sightings, and there’s still the freak storms and those weird eggs to think about. The more we look into it, the less everything seems connected, man. It’s…
Fully prepared for that to be the end of the conversation, he reached out and started the car. She purred to life around them, and Dean felt immediately soothed by the gentle rumble. Beside him, Cas sat silently, and when Dean dared a glance before he pulled away, his expression was hard to read.
He had never really worried about Sam because he always kept tabs on him, and he knew that he hadn’t been seriously hurt before they’d even set foot back in the car. Castiel, however, had taken a beating, and angel or not, he had been suspiciously quiet the whole way back to the motel. Sam had sensed it as well, he thought – it’s why he’d made himself scarce.
“Fire it is,” Dean grunted, taking just a second to glance around him before he yanked their flamethrower from the bottom of the trunk. “God, I love this thing.”
As quickly as he had started, his hand slowed on his dick. Breath coming in short gasps, mind addled with lust, he stared through the water to the half-bottle of moisturiser and realised he could very easily find out. But as soon as the thought had entered his head, a deep rumble in his gut tried to shut it down. Thinking about it was bad enough, but to actually put it into practise? Dean was torn, very aware that this was a precipice – a potential point of no return.
“Yeah, Cas, we’re connected,” he nodded, voice cracking a little at the end. With a deep breath, and throwing caution to the wind, he reached out to cup the back of Cas’s neck. He didn’t miss the way his eyelids fluttered as he leaned back into the contact, but that was probably just because he was so obviously touch-starved, right? “And we’re gonna figure this out, okay? Whatever this is – whatever you need… we’ll figure it out.”
“There’s nothing to talk about,” Dean replied, aiming for decisive and immediately recognising he’d failed when his voice cracked at the end. Then, because he hated the worried expression on Cas’s face, and he felt like maybe he needed to come up with some sort of cover, he continued, “I’m just tired, okay? We had a long drive yesterday, and then the storm and the shitty mattress – I didn’t exactly sleep well. And then we ended up hiking a lot farther than I’d expected, and I didn’t have the right shoes, and this whole case doesn’t make a damn lick of sense, and –“
“We should check the rest of the house,” he murmured once Cas had repaired the door, and Cas nodded his head.
He left Cas unloading their bags and headed into the office. The only employee was a pock-marked teenager who looked like he would rather have been anywhere else in the world, but Dean paid him little mind as he walked to the counter and pulled his card out of his pocket.
“Cas, buddy, rise and shine,” he tried again with a gentle tap to Cas’s face, already bracing himself for the fact that he was probably going to have to carry him. “It’s Dean, remember? We gotta go –“
lips wrapped around him, and the noises the girl was making between his legs. If he concentrated, the porn just disappeared into the background, as though it wasn’t on at all. It was for his partner, after all, and Dean wasn't anything if not giving in bed.
? What if he decided to move out, to shack up with this guy that Dean had never met, knew nothing about –
“You sure it’s something for us? Hikers wind up dead all the time – doesn’t mean there’s anything spooky going on,” Dean reasoned, taking another sip of his beer as he rifled through Sam’s research. “Hell, follow the wrong trail, misstep too close to a ledge – it’s easy to get yourself killed someplace like that.”
As he passed her, Dean realised for the first time that Paxton was just his usual type. A little younger than him, maybe, but not too much so. Petite,
Dean dropped Cas off at the local hospital with strict instructions to call him if anything felt even remotely untoward, and then hopped on the highway. The drive was supposed to take around forty minutes, but Dean did it in thirty, hitting the gas as soon as he realised how empty it was. Miles of open land fell away, replaced by thick forestry that seemed to soak up any sound the car made, and he wound the window down, taking in the fresh scent of evergreens, relishing in the cool breeze.
too much – but as Dean watched Cas move, watched him simply breathe, he realised that there was more than just blood leaking from his body.
“Anything that might be linked. Old ruins, archaic writing, crop circles… I don’t know – monoliths?”
“You scared me,” Cas murmured, his hands shifting from the back of Dean’s neck to his shoulders, where they stayed as he pulled back just far enough to catch Dean’s eye. “Are you alright?”
“It’s on the other side of the river,” she replied. “Just under the bluffs. It’ll be… a bit of a hike.”
“Realising that your little inscriptions can’t save you from all of my tricks?” the creature rumbled, deep in his chest.
“Did you just try and roofie-spell me?” he asked, tugging the sleeve of his shirt up to show the room the sigils carved into his arms. “
Dean was supposed to argue. He was supposed to force himself up, to keep going, so they could get this damned case figured out and he could get some breathing room from Cas before he went and did something idiotic like kiss his stupid, beautiful face. He was supposed to ignore how tired he was, how holding himself together was draining him, and act like everything was okay.
The pressure was unfamiliar, but not overly painful, and he spent a couple of minutes getting acquainted with the tight little pucker. His dick had softened a little in the interim, but that was okay; he continued to pant softly, far from unaroused regardless of what his dick thought. After another couple of minutes, he took another deep breath, realising he wanted more. When he next pressed against his hole, he held his finger there, testing the pressure, the give. It took him a moment to realise he was holding his breath, and let it out in a nervous chuckle.
“You should get under the covers, Dean,” Cas muttered a few moments later, because he always seemed to know exactly what Dean was thinking even though he
Dean was sure something was supposed to have happened, because the creature was staring at him with a lecherous smile, but all he felt was a gentle tingling along the lengths of his arms, right over where he had carved the anti-enchantment spells, and everything suddenly clicked into place in his head.
His hand curled around the cold metal of the lighter, and he didn’t even think before flicking it open and jerking the flamethrower up, right into the waiting path of the beautiful, monstrous man – only to feel all the air leave him at once as he was thrown bodily across the room by an invisible wall of force, immediately knocking the lighter far away from his hand. His head connected first, sending him into a moment of complete, dizzying silence, immediately followed by a sick crunching noise as the rest of his body smacked into the wall. He grunted, momentarily confused by the warm, wet trickle he felt at his side, only to gasp aloud when his eyes focused and he realised what had happened.
He hadn’t known what to say. His face felt hot, flushed from the alcohol he had chugged, and all at once it seemed to settle over him, making him feel loose and calm.
“It’s fine,” he murmured instead, more for his own benefit than for Cas’s. “I’m just exhausted. It’s not a big deal, and it doesn’t need to be one. It was just a blip.”
“I was starting to think so,” Dean admitted, before his eyes drifted back to the egg again. “But there’s something weird about the bodies, man, and this egg. It… it tingles when you touch it.”
As he’d shifted to pull his finger out, his inner muscles had clenched against the movement, sucking his finger back in. That was… okay, maybe he hadn’t been doing it right. Shifting again, he pumped his finger slowly, experimentally, and found himself adjusting to the fullness relatively quickly.
He was still trying to find a comfortable position when Cas wandered over to him, a beer in each hand. He passed one to Dean and took the seat opposite him, returning Dean’s frown as he shifted on the cheap material.
Feeling not only like a monumental asshole, but also like maybe his heart was breaking a little bit, he stuffed his phone into his pocket and stepped back inside the bar. Hoping Cas wouldn’t hate him too much for cutting his evening short, and then hating himself because a small part of him was elated at that prospect, he weaved through the throngs of people towards the bar. He couldn’t see Cas or the guy he’d been talking to, and found himself beginning to frown.
He thought that Sam might call him on his shit, but he just sighed and didn’t push the matter any further. Kid was smart in more ways than one, it seemed.
They stood in silence for a moment, breathing in the brisk evening air. Dean knew Cas was just as troubled by what they had found as he was – could see it clear as day on his handsome face. They needed to figure this out, and
Dean rubbed his hand over his eyes, not completely sure that they weren’t about to bug out of his stupid head. “When has all this been
As he waited for the pump to do its thing, he let his mind go blank, revelling in the gentle breeze that washed across his face as he idly glanced through the store window. He felt more relaxed than he had done for a while, a long drive usually all it took to make him feel focused, and that was why he didn’t immediately spot Cas. He’d expected to find him wrestling with the hotdog machine, or maybe staring blankly at a soda label, but instead…
That, he could do. Huffing out a laugh, feeling a little bit more centered, he grabbed her hand and pulled her up the bed towards him.
Dean swallowed heavily, not really sure how to respond to such a blatant show of strength (and what that did to him), and had to clear his voice before he could reply.
But John hadn’t let him finish. He’d pushed Dean backwards hard enough that his head smacked against the door’s window; the glass hadn’t smashed, but pain, hot and sharp, had erupted behind Dean’s eyes. It had taken him a moment to gather himself, to catch his breath, and while he did so John had started the car and pulled away.
“You’re a good friend, Dean,” he told him sincerely, and Dean had to swallow the bile that was quickly rising in his throat.
“Cas,” he suddenly found himself begging, immediately too far gone to even care how it must sound. “Can you just… will you just talk to me for a sec?”
, it keeps growing the longer I stay here, on Earth. But I’m not human, not truly, and I’m no angel – I’m neither, I’m
“M’sleeping,” he mumbled into the pillow, and was proud of the fact that he only flinched a little when a warm hand reached out to press against the small of his back.
He felt, rather than saw, when Cas stilled on the bed beside him. Only half awake, he found himself frowning, but after a long second he felt the mattress move and the covers shift, and then there was a warm body pressed close against his. If he had been more awake, he probably would have panicked. As it was, however, he just let out another contented sigh and settled back against the rigid warmth at his side. He floated for a little while, caught somewhere deep between sleep and waking, until a sound dragged him up towards the surface. Blinking his weary eyes open, he rolled and then squinted at the light still coming from Cas’s phone.
“He wasn’t very talkative,” Cas reasoned seriously, “but yes, he did seem to enjoy it when I scratched behind his ears.”
The officer didn’t look convinced, but she didn’t question him further. “Well, you’re just in time – couple of kids staying at the campsite found another one this morning.”
“Sure,” Dean had agreed, watching as Drew disappeared through the house before he’d gone to find the VHS.
understood how broken I am,” he croaked, breath stuttering in his chest. “Retaining some of my grace, but disconnected from my brethren, and all the while this feeling of… of
“Yeah, Cas, there you are,” Dean choked on a huff of relieved laughter, ignoring how his eyes were stinging with tears and his hands were trembling against Cas’s bare skin. “We gotta go, okay? Is it – is
“Hey,” Sam replied, voice a little more harried than Dean had expected. “Where are you? I’ve been calling.”
“Boo,” Drew grinned, and placed the boombox – playing a song Dean had never heard before, because it wasn’t classic rock – on the floor beside them. Then, instead of finding his own seat, he’d unceremoniously wedged himself into the same seat as Dean, plastering himself along Dean’s side.
Dean drew his gun before stepping cautiously into the darkness of the house, ears straining for any hint of noise. It was darker inside than it had been out, but he didn’t dare flip any light switches as he toed the scuffed wood of the ground floor. He tested each step before putting his full weight down, making sure to make as little noise as possible as he cleared the rooms and slowly made his way down the corridor towards the basement.
“So you’re telling me,” Dean grimaced, and had to rub a hand over his eyes again, “that Gloria Brown was boning some giant vampire bird?”
Like Sammy said, there's really not a lot of information about the Impundulu online. I'd usually hit my local library and try to get more sources, but, y'know... pandemic, so I took bits from a couple of online articles and added a little artistic licence; I know it's a part of traditional South African culture and just tried to be as respectful as possible.
“You, um – it’s as much about balance as it is about aim,” he murmured, and watched, fascinated, as his breath shifted the hair at the nape of Cas’s neck. “You want your centre of gravity to be as low as possible.”
“What?” Dean almost gagged on his sip of beer. “Sam, no, I – I’ll go help Garth and you and Cas can –“
, which had worried him only for a second before he’d decided to let it go – he hadn’t felt a need to lie when Bobby probed him about his weekend plans.
His junk making his mind up for him, he threw caution to the wind and hit the play button anyway. It immediately felt more amateur than any of the stuff he usually perused; he felt a little weird that the people could be

Happy posting day! Thank you for all the lovely support on the first chapter - hope you like this one, too!
Slowly, to give Drew every chance to move away, he’d leaned in until they were so close they were sharing breath. He could hear Lilah and Emmie gasping somewhere behind them, but he paid them no mind as, slowly – so slowly – he’d breached the final few inches between them and brought his lips to Drew’s.
Dean waited approximately five seconds after Cas had disappeared before he threw himself bodily back onto the bed, covering his face with his hands as he did so.
“Why don’t you come up with some full sentences and ask him yourself?” Sam sighed, reaching down to pick one of his books up off the floor. “I’m busy.”
the other person, right down to their bones, and it’s like… I don’t know. Making yourself feel good doesn’t seem to matter as much – you want them to feel good. To feel
Dean could just imagine the contented smile on Cas’s face as he’d petted the dog, and it made his heart ache in his chest. Speaking to them with the expectation of receiving a coherent answer aside (which… Dean had actually never thought about – could angels speak dog?), Cas was always gentle with animals. Kids, too. Hell, he was just gentle, full stop, and it sometimes awed Dean how much restraint it must take him on a daily basis as a
“They were in the kitchen one morning,” Sam replied with a shrug that was entirely too nonchalant for the
Because if he didn’t know better, eyes raking over the dusting of stubble and piercingly blue eyes just about distinguishable from between the Bottom’s legs, he’d say the Top looked like
Guilt, dark and searing, caught in Dean’s throat and clung there, making it hard to breathe. He hadn’t realised – hadn’t
He felt ill. As quickly as he could, he pulled his underwear and pants back up, ignoring the stickiness and the way it made his gut clench, and reached for the trackpad to click away, erase all evidence of what he had done, and then possibly throw the whole laptop onto the nearest freeway.
Nothing even changed, to begin with, which was the most frustrating part. Dean still woke up at noon every day, thereby missing any chance encounter he might have had should Cas decide to bring anyone else home – which he hadn’t, incidentally. Dean had started paying a little extra attention to the security camera facing Cas’s door as he did their weekly check-throughs – purely for Cas’s safety, of course – and had been strangely pleased to see the corridor had remained empty of strangers ever since he’d found the video.
Sam called him around twenty minutes into his drive back towards town, and Dean picked up quickly, eager to hear about how the Wendigo case was going.
Sam still seemed highly amused, because he let out a surprised laugh that echoed through the whole library.
A fat pearl of pre-come dribbled from his cock, and he spread it around the head, breath catching in his lungs at the smooth, delicious drag. Unconsciously, his ass-cheeks clenched, balls drawing a little tighter as he raced towards release.
,” Dean snapped, only to be met with the sound of his heart thudding in his ears and complete silence on the other end of the phone.
Because he’d grown accustomed to his little habit over the years, and had genuinely stopped worrying about what it might mean. It meant exactly what he wanted it to, which was nothing…
“Hey, you see where my buddy went?” he called over to the barman, gesturing to the seats they had been sat in. “Little shorter than me, dark hair, trench coat? He was… talking to another guy.”
And that, in the end, was what made Dean withdraw his arms and take a step backwards. Cas’s smile faltered, just for a second, before being replaced by a much gentler one. Dean allowed himself one last moment of weakness as he reached out and squeezed Cas’s shoulder; his heart was racing against his ribcage, intoxicated by the warmth of Cas’s body under his palm, and he knew he couldn’t let himself make this mistake again. If he weren’t more careful, Cas was going to twig on to the fact he was hopelessly, uncontrollably in love with him, and Dean didn’t think he could survive the gentle rejection he knew Cas would give him.
“You should have said,” he murmured, voice pinched around the lump in his throat. “Why didn’t you tell us?”
Cas’s eyes were closed, his breath shallow, and Dean felt bile rising quickly in his throat when he didn’t respond. Dean’s hands were shaking, his body thrumming with adrenaline that he didn’t know what to do with; all he knew was that they had to get out of there as fast as humanly possible.
He stopped himself before he started to spiral somewhere out of his control. Castiel was a grown-up – he could go ahead and fall in love with whoever he wanted to. It wasn’t like Dean could
“You should have said something sooner,” he huffed, already peeling Castiel’s trench-coat and jacket away from his injured side.
He took a step up onto the porch and it creaked loudly underfoot. Cas winced; any element of surprise they might have had just disappeared in the blink of an eye. Dean drew his gun from the back of his pants as he took another tentative step towards the door – the element of surprise was gone, sure, but it was still pretty hard to argue with the nose of a gun pointed your way.
Why was he incapable of holding a normal conversation? Cas looked at him for a moment more, expression hard to read, and then he rolled his eyes and ducked back through the door.
“Okay,” he cleared his throat, reaching for the triangle to set the balls up. “Get over here. You set the balls up in this triangle, see? Any random order, except the black ball has to go in the middle.”
“This is the fourth body in a couple of weeks,” the ranger agreed. “All found somewhere along this bend, and all… looking like
In any other situation, he would never have admitted to that. Then again, in any other situation, he very much doubted he would have had a panic attack in the first place. Even now, he still felt unsteady, like he was a few seconds away from shaking apart completely. His hand, holding his phone to his ear, was uncomfortably sweaty, and he couldn’t quite get a full breath into his chest.
Dean didn’t push for further words – didn’t really want to talk about it – so he rummaged back in the first aid kit to give his shaking hands something to do. He found what he was looking for quickly, and felt a mighty side better when he realised there was still some left.
“I could,” Cas agreed, cheeks still flushed. “But I’ve found I quite enjoy manually cleaning myself after –“
Then, in a bid for stupidest thing that had ever left his mouth, he replied, “Hey, bros help bros get laid, right?”
about that night for over twenty years, but as he pulled back into the motel parking lot that afternoon with Cas in the seat beside him – the seat he had been sat in that night, as John had screamed at him – he couldn’t seem to
Dean huffed nervously, but couldn’t exactly deny it. Cas had seen every atom of his being, had pulled him out of hell and put him back together with not a hair out of place; that was probably the most intimate thing anyone had ever done for him, period.
Cas tilted his head to the side, squinted at Dean with an intense focus that made him feel a little hot around the collar, before a small smile tugged at the corners of his lips.
–“ Dean found himself spluttering, grasping for straws of an argument he didn’t really know how to make, because he didn’t really know what the tight feeling in his chest was supposed to mean.
he have seen it? The sun had already set, and anything out of the glare of the streetlamps was near impossible to make out. The moon was bright, but low in the autumnal sky; he could barely make out the house from where he stood anymore, never mind anything in the surrounding area.
And Dean hadn’t known if it was the sheer surrealness of the situation, or the alcohol in his gut, or the soothing warmth radiating from Drew beside him, but before he’d really thought about it, he’d chugged his drink and exclaimed, emboldened, “Dare.”
“Noted, thank you,” Castiel nodded his head with a gentle sigh, and then turned back to Dean. “Are there any other probing questions you have about my sex life, or am I free to go?”
“Jesus, Sammy,” he whispered, because he couldn’t quite figure out how to thank him instead. But then Sam’s words registered further, and he found himself asking, “Wait… how’re
Cas straightened and turned in the ring Dean had unconsciously made with his arms. His smile, just inches from Dean’s own, was brighter than the sun and infinitely more beautiful. Dean caught himself staring, knew he should probably pull away, but he found he couldn’t quite manage it. Cas glanced down at Dean’s smile, eyelashes fluttering a little, and he’d only have to move a couple of inches to lose the remaining distance between them, to bring their lips together –
“You were rude to that woman,” Cas was the first to break, and Dean childishly found himself thinking of it as a win.
Dean had slept longer than he’d thought – almost three hours had passed. He did feel better, though, and said as much. Cas bobbed his head, smile still in place, and Dean found himself desperately wanting to kiss him.
An hour, maybe two, had definitely passed when Cas’s voice next drew him out of sleep; through the window, the sun had moved across the sky, bringing them closer and closer to evening. Dean sat up, his back protesting the movement, and pulled Cas’s coat up with him, if only to soak up its warmth for just a little while longer. His head didn’t feel like it was seconds away from splitting open anymore, and he breathed a quiet sigh of relief as Cas’s soft words continued to wash over him.
He hit dial again, pressed the phone to his ear hard enough to distract him from the terrible feeling that was starting to bubble in his chest, and listened to it ring. And ring.
“There’s a firepit out back,” Drew announced, already herding the girls down the hall. “Girls, can you get it started? Dean, grab the booze – there’s a boombox around here somewhere –“
“Yeah, well, when have I ever listened to what you say?” Sam replied, and Dean could practically hear his smirk. “So, how’re we doing this? I’m still over seven hours away.”
Cas rolled his eyes, just like he always did when Dean said something that he didn’t entirely understand, and slid into the car without a word. He then, with a single-minded focus Dean had only seen in him a couple of times before, unceremoniously reached across the space between them and pulled him into a crushing hug.
“I took photos,” he hummed instead, sipping at his beer. “Could send them to Rowena, see if she has any ideas how to clear it all out.”
“The bunker has ruined my ass,” Dean muttered, finally finding a somewhat comfortable position. “Anything less than memory foam just doesn’t cut it anymore.”
“This, here?” the paramedic pointed out an invisible line directly through the marks. “That’s where the femoral artery is –
“Yeah, I bet she did,” Dean muttered under his breath. Then, louder, “Alright, Casanova, you done here?”
Dean felt as though he was tearing apart at the seams, every muscle tensed as he exploded with a barely contained shout. White spattered his heaving chest, and for a second he was sure he was about to pass out, black spots lurking at the edge of his blurry vision. His head was empty; the only sound he could hear was static, mumbling, somewhere just out of reach.
“You mean the guys making eyes at each other?” the barman replied, brow raised in a way that made Dean want to reach across the bar and punch him. “Yeah, they left out the side a couple minutes ago. Seemed to be in a hurry, if you catch my drift.”
“Holy crap,” Paxton whispered, more to herself than, Dean thought, to him. After a moment of simply staring, her brow began to furrow. “Wait, is it… tingling?”
He was pulled from his thoughts by the arrival of his food. Cas had ordered him a bacon cheeseburger and fries. To keep up appearances, he’d also ordered a side portion of onion rings to make it look like they were sharing; Dean immediately grabbed for one and crammed the whole thing in his mouth, which only served to make Cas smile.
“Whassis -?” he mumbled, body already tensing as if anticipating an attack, and paused only when he felt a soothing hand rake through his hair.
“Because I know you wouldn’t make up a fake case just to force me and Cas into spending more time together,” he continued, and was met with a very telling silence on the other end of the phone.
The next day, even as Bobby had pleaded with John to let them stay, they had loaded up the car with their meagre belongings and been on their way without so much as a goodbye. Bobby and John hadn’t spoken for a long time after that, and Dean had certainly never seen any of his friends again.
Around them, the early morning rush continued to flurry through the diner. Dean stared at his mug of coffee, letting the ambient noise wash over him as he only half listened to whatever it was that Cas was talking about.
The sheriff had enough presence of mind to shoo the gaggle of rangers and officers surrounding them away, and they all slunk back to whatever it was that they were supposed to be doing.
With Cas’s gaze still burning a hole in his back, Dean drew his cue back and let the white ball fly. It hit dead centre, knocking the other balls akimbo, and he couldn’t help the competitive twist he felt in his gut when a striped ball dropped into the top left pocket.
“That was, truly, a fantastic attempt,” Dean grinned as he shuffled back, and laughed again when Cas shot him a glare. “No, I’m serious! That went, what? Three, four feet?”
“Oh,” Castiel breathed again, chin tucked down against his chest as Dean continued to work. “That feels pleasant.”
Slipping the vial into his breast pocket so he could feel the gentle hum against his chest, he steeled himself once more. A last glance around the room offered no more clues, but he still wasn’t certain his spotty knowledge of spells would have helped even if a clue had smacked him directly in the face, so he had to stow his dumb ass and push forward.
He at least had the decency to blush. His cheeks heated, giving his face more colour than Dean thought he had ever seen before, and the spattering of red trailed all the way down to his collar. Dean cleared his throat, looked away from Cas’s bobbing Adam’s Apple before he thought something stupid like how it might taste if he licked a stripe straight up his neck.
him – with such unwavering focus that he had to look away again, just for a second, lest he did something stupid like start crying.
“Yeah,” Dean nodded, taking a deep breath of his own to steady his racing heart. He could talk about the case – he could talk about damn near anything as long as it wasn’t the strange expression on Cas’s face. “Yeah, um, so Sam found a couple news articles about hikers turning up drained of blood over in Missouri. Apparently, they’ve been washing up in a creek just off some campground – how do you feel about camping?”
Dean Winchester wasn’t gay – he wanted that fact to be very explicitly known. The thought would never have even crossed his mind if that chick – Sandra, or Sarah, or something like that – hadn’t suggested it while she’d had her hands down his pants (and, surely, there was actually nothing
“The second victim, Angela Thomas, is named more recently, this time charged with breaking and entering with attempted burglary,” Cas continued. “The third victim, Debbie Johnson, is named in an article as the project manager for a new shopping development that was passed through local government a few years ago. It eventually fell through, but –“
Tensing automatically, Dean brought his gun back up and edged through into the hall. He made sure to spot every door, every possible place something could attack them from, but found himself relaxing incrementally when he spotted Cas at the end of the hall, past the stairs, obviously unharmed.
Something in his tone seemed off. Dean knew his little brother well enough to know when he was being lied to, and Sammy was definitely hiding something from him.
“So, the case,” Dean cleared his throat, not even bothering to hide the fact that he was sidestepping Sam’s question. “It’s a real puzzler.”
– because they’d already talked about this; Cas was allowed to fuck all the beautiful strangers he wanted, because he didn’t belong to Dean and deserved to be taken care of. He didn’t want Cas to wake up on that lumpy mattress beside him again with a boner that Dean couldn’t let himself do anything about, didn’t want Cas to feel like he was stuck with Dean and Sam just because they were the best of a bad situation.
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean whispered, gently pushing the shirt, jacket and trench-coat over his shoulders at once.
“I don’t know,” Dean replied, and found himself grinning even though his hands were still trembling a little. “People like dogs, man. I think they’re just supposed to make you feel good, y’know? Not prescribe Xanax.”
“Which thigh?” he continued into the phone, ushering the paramedic along with him back towards the body.
“Dude, the way he’s looking at you?” he found himself saying regardless, and risked knocking him gently on the shoulder. “I figure you’ve got two options. One, we can finish the game and call it an early night. Not like we can really do anything until we hear back from Rowena, anyway.
Shaking his head in disbelief – because how was this his life? – Dean rolled back over and very pointedly closed his eyes (though he doubted he would be sleeping any time soon, thanks to Cas). The room settled back into silence, save for the occasional crack of thunder off in the distance, and for a moment Dean thought maybe Cas really had done as he was told and turned the damn thing off. He breathed a little easier, let his body go a little limper, only to immediately tense again when another alert chirped soon afterwards, swiftly followed by a sharp intake of breath.
Dean clicked on the video. He also realised, as he waited for the page to buffer (damn bunker wifi) that it probably wasn’t a good idea to do this in the kitchen. Dropping his sandwich back onto his plate, he kicked his chair out from under him and stood, scooping the laptop up with him. His jeans felt a little too tight around the crotch, but he managed to ignore it long enough to get back to his room and lock the door.
“I just mean… I didn’t know this is something you were interested in,” he replied, almost completely honest. “I didn’t think angels needed sex.”
“All of the websites agree that a Cleveland Steamer must include defecation, though the definitions vary on the volume and intended placement of the faeces,” Cas frowned, words immediately drawing Dean’s attention back to the present. “I’m not sure I understand the appeal. Is defecation something you find arousing, Dean?”
what his problem was. Cas was entitled to sleep with whoever he wanted – go anywhere and do anything he wanted – and yet… Dean had always, somewhat selfishly, assumed that he and Sam were the centre of Cas’s world. He’d
“It’s not much further,” Paxton promised, guiding him down a track that began to lead them away from the creek and deeper into the trees. “You’ll know it when you see it.”
“Well,” Dean started, reaching to take a sip of his coffee instead. “I spoke a little bit to the kid in the motel office last night – said he had a friend whose mom works in the local morgue. According to her, the bodies were drained near dust by the time the authorities found them.”
as bad once the worst of the blood had been washed away. Sure, housekeeping was going to have a fit when they came to find the towels in the morning, but Dean had already planned for them to be checked out by first light anyway. The wound at Castiel’s side was no longer bleeding, but hot to the touch - a sign that infection was already beginning to set in. His back was better, but the wounds – where smaller – were deeper, and still weeping. He thought momentarily of going back to his bag, fishing out the half bottle of whiskey he knew was stashed in there. It’d be a quick way to disinfect the wounds for sure, but… looking up at Castiel’s face, he decided against it. Dark bags had painted themselves under Cas’s eyes, and a sheen of sweat covered his knitted, pallid brow. He hid his pain as well as it seemed he was able, but Dean could still see it in his eyes, threatening to spill out at any moment.
Dean pulled his gun out of his belt, and rolled his eyes when Paxton opened her mouth in a horrified gasp.
“How big are they? And what colour?” Paxton’s voice filtered through again. “Could be a cave swallow’s nest, but they’re more likely snake eggs.”
,” he continued, voice a little higher than he would have liked. “I potted a ball, so I get another turn.”
“I’m sure we could have figured this out much quicker together,” Cas replied with a straightforward sincerity that made Dean’s head spin a little. “But I’m glad you’re feeling better.”
“Dean?” Cas called suddenly, and when Dean looked up, he realised he had disappeared back through the door.
He didn’t know Dean was awake, that much was clear, because after putting the phone down he let out a little sigh and brought his hand up to rub across his eyes. The movement was so intrinsically human that it made Dean’s heart ache, and he was hit, once again, by the full force of his feelings. It wouldn’t take much to reach out and run his hands through Cas’s hair, he found himself thinking, sooth him like Cas had soothed Dean earlier – but he couldn’t. He couldn’t, because he knew Cas would let him, but it wouldn’t mean the same as when Cas did it to him, and Dean didn’t think he could take that.
,” Sam finished with force, completely ignoring Dean’s attempts to derail the conversation. “For all our sakes.”
Dean didn’t think about how close their asses had been to touching, because that would be ridiculous.
But in the same second, Dean knew that could never happen. Cas deserved to be with someone as good as him, as whip-smart and as beautiful, and Dean wasn’t any of those things. Everything he touched turned to shit, and he couldn’t –
“Nah,” he replied, and took a deep breath. “I’m gonna be late – don’t want to get in trouble on my first day, right?”
With the intention of doing no such thing, Dean tipped his head in thanks, and then stepped back out into the night. There was a tang to the air that he hadn’t immediately recognised when he’d first got out of the car, but he knew exactly what it was by the time he’d walked back to Cas and picked up his bag.
“I’m good,” Dean promised, tamping his laughter down enough to get words out. “You just… I don’t think the dogs have to get degrees, Cas.”
“Yeah, well,” Dean shrugged one shoulder, a lie slipping easily from his tongue. “The higher ups at the Bureau are a little concerned the bodies might have drifted in from out of state.”
Beer was for celebration – whiskey for cases, research, and anything else. He ordered burgers with everything on, extra onions, and then picked the tomato off, without fail; it didn’t cross his mind to simply order it without. He felt grounded in the repetition, especially when so much of their lives was so out of his control.
“It’s just high-school,” he’d continued, once it became apparent Dean wasn’t going to say anything. “Barely a blip on your radar, huh?”
“And there isn’t always rain, either,” Paxton continued earnestly. “I know the two aren’t mutually exclusive, but you kinda expect a downpour at some point during a thunderstorm, right? The air gets all electric and damp, but sometimes the rain just… doesn’t come.”
“Alright, ladies,” he announced, letting Sam and Castiel into the motel room before him so he could be the one to lock the door behind his aching body. “Arms up.”
Sam insisted Dean mark himself with some generalised anti-enchantment sigils, which… Dean admitted wasn’t the worst idea in the world. He had to duck into Baby to collect the egg from where it was still stored in the glovebox, anyway, so he took an extra second to pull out a penknife and carve what Sam instructed into the flesh of his arms.
and find something you are interested in. If it’s a sticking point, the person probably isn’t right for you.”
“Not sure,” Dean replied honestly, as he reached out to start Baby’s ignition. “But it’s pretty weird.”
A door was set into the side of the stairs, obviously leading to a cupboard or basement. That in itself wasn’t all that strange, but the large Enochian symbol painted in the middle certainly was, and so were the three separate padlocks sealing the door closed.
All he knew was, when the screaming gurgled to an anguished stop, all human pretence had gone from the creature’s frame. As the Impundulu rose up to its full height – inky black wings stretching the full length of the room – Dean knew they were very,
His dick was back in the game. Using his free hand, he wrapped his fingers around himself and tugged a couple of times, getting himself back to full hardness. That felt even
At the far edge of the clearing, Dean spotted a ranger’s truck tucked away, along with a couple of ambulances, cop cars, and the county sheriff’s jeep, and he headed in that direction, ignoring the signs pointing towards the pitch site opposite. The gentle babble of the nearby river followed him through the trees, and it was only ten minutes or so before he found another clearing and the source of the water.
I have no excuse for this being a day late other than the passage of time is currently meaningless and I genuinely thought today was Monday.
Cas had gotten under the covers, sure, but he was still propped up against the pillows with his phone in his hand. He startled a little at Dean’s voice, cheeks glowing pink under the synthetic light, and glanced away as though he was embarrassed.
Dean was trying to tell him. “Cas is a pretty good judge of character, and even if he brought someone here with bad intentions, you think he couldn’t handle himself? Look, I’m not particularly thrilled I’ve seen the evidence, and I’m definitely never offering to wash his sheets for him again, but the warding keeps us safe from anything dangerous, and the guy’s allowed to blow off a little steam every once in a while. S’not like it’s the first time.”
“My Mom’s out of town for a conference this weekend,” Drew had mentioned one day while they’d been lounging on the bleachers, basking in the remnants of the weak, wintery sun. “The house will be empty; you guys wanna raid the liquor cabinet and hang out? You can sleep over if you want.”
in a stranger’s bed, so worn out by whatever the two of them had been up to that not even whatever angel mojo he had left had been able to keep him awake. Dean decidedly
“’Red Bluff Campground’,” he read aloud, feigning ignorance. “Hey, isn’t that where those hikers have been washing up?”
Because now Dean was allowing himself to have these thoughts, he could very much appreciate how Cas’s chest puffed out, how strong he looked. When they’d first met, his suit had been too big on his thin frame, but over the years, the more they had fought together, he’d filled out with wiry muscle that now had his shirt pulling a little too tightly across chest. Dean caught himself thinking about peeling that shirt over firm shoulders, and forced himself to focus. It’d be really embarrassing if he ended up getting killed because he was fantasising about his best friend.
Was he a bad person if a small part of him – just a tiny, little bit – wanted Cas to crash and burn, if only so Dean could be his shoulder to cry on?
of Cas taking naked photos to send to strangers on the internet made him start to sweat. “No, definitely don’t do that. Just… say hello? Introduce yourself? Maybe skip the whole
“Thank you,” Dean sighed, taking the plate from her when it seemed she wasn’t going to put it down. Then, pointedly turning to Cas to yank the phone out of his hand and place it on the table between them, he hissed, “No, dude, I do
“Just…” Dean had to take a deep breath to settle his thudding heart. “We are not having an in-depth conversation about kinks in a diner at ass-o’clock in the morning, so here’s the lowdown – some people like weird stuff, y’know,
“That’s not true,” Dean replied instantly, and only really thought about what he’d said after the fact. “I mean… you’re – you’ll do just fine.”
him hold his hand – and Dean could only imagine what they must look like to the other patrons. With every fibre of his being screaming against it, he forced himself to pull away. He tried to be casual about it, to not make it a big deal, because it wasn’t,
The woman’s sweatpants, where dirty, were intact, and the paramedic leaned down to expertly cut along the seam. As her paper-thin skin was exposed, it became very apparent that she was sporting what Dean assumed were the same marks as the other victims. They were deep, down to brittle bones, but clean, and placed in a triangular-shaped pattern. There was no blood left, but Dean could easily imagine how much the wounds must have poured.
, or anything. Sure, the guy had the kind of dark, flawless skin you’d usually only see on airbrushed models, and his hair was pulled back into delicate, intricate cornrows ending in a top knot that, on anyone else (Sammy), Dean would have made fun of. On this guy, it only served to show off his chiselled cheekbones and dark, piercing eyes.
Dean looked him over for a moment, watching for any sign of injury, but the fact he could stretch his body meant nothing was seriously wrong, at least. Some bruises, maybe, and a couple of scratches across his face from where the deity had thrown him across the barn, but nothing a shower and a hot meal wouldn’t cure.
Possibly the most beautiful human being Dean had ever laid eyes on, regardless of gender, but that was beside the point. It wasn’t – he wasn’t
OH BOY imagine reading nearly 40k words of a fic that you've been told updates regularly, getting to the first big cliff-hanger of the thing, and then watching in horror as the author takes an unannounced, month long hiatus hahaha imagine how fucking angry you'd be...
“The house,” he replied immediately. “It has to be, right? It’s close, and it – I would have seen some giant freaking bird carrying him away.”
“Yes,” Cas agreed, oblivious to what was going on in Dean’s head, “and I just got off the phone with the Coroner’s office – they’ve confirmed there’s no evidence to suggest the bodies were ever fully submerged in water.”
“It’s like…” Dean took a second to think, really wanting to get this right. “You spend time getting to know a person – their past, their hopes, their fears and flaws – and they know the same about you, and it’s… that’s a connection that only the two of you have. It’s shared, but unique to just the two of you. And sex feels good anyway, right? But add to that the fact that you
“I am not getting involved in this,” Sam told him, bitch-facing his way through picking up the rest of his books. “It isn’t our business what he does in his spare time, or who he does it with.”
“Uh…” the officer looked a little unsure, but guided him towards the riverbank regardless. “Didn’t realise this had alerted the feds.”
Cas nodded his head, hair at his nape tickling Dean’s palm, and they lapsed back into a comfortable silence. Only when Dean’s arm started to go numb did he reluctantly pull his hand away, already missing the warmth against his palm. His chest ached faintly when, glancing back at Cas, he realised his eyes had fallen permanently closed at some point, because he made an adorably disgruntled noise and blinked them open again.
And so, whenever he had some time to himself, and was maybe feeling a little bored of his usual searches, he’d click on over to the gay portion of the website and see what said searches looked like with guys, instead. It was healthy, he decided, to open his mind a little. Done out of pure curiosity.
Apologies for no update on Friday - real life shit got in the way. Hope this 6.2k doozy makes up for it :D
And Dean paused, because… he hadn’t told Cas that. He actually couldn’t remember the last time he had physically told Cas that he was his friend. But… Cas
“Well, we initially thought it might be a vampire or djinn, right?” Sam continued, and Dean hummed his agreement. “Didn’t sound like the traditional descriptions, but then I went hunting for any off-shoots that might be a better fit. Didn’t find anything all day, but then an hour ago this book surfaced in the
“You’ll have to find him quickly, then, won’t you?” the stranger replied, voice thick as honey in Dean’s ears. “All that power, all that grace – how’s a boy supposed to resist?”
They’d all burst into laughter while Emmie spluttered around her drink, cheeks visibly heating as she attempted to come up with an answer. Dean had known it was futile – she’d told him herself about her crush while they’d been studying in the library one afternoon during a free period – and when he’d glanced at her, he could tell she knew there was no getting out of it.
True to his word, Cas arrived not an hour later. Dean had spent that time packing for the trip and actively
“I’m fine,” Castiel tried, and Dean chose to ignore him lest he accidentally punch his lying face instead.
“Get the fuck away from him,” Dean snarled, already reaching for the flamethrower at his back. He’d dropped the lighter somewhere in the bedsheets, and he fumbled around for it, trying to bide himself some time. “You wanted a trade, right? The egg for him? I got it right here, buddy –“
They hadn’t talked about it, afterwards. There was no need to – morning wood was natural, and certainly nothing to be alarmed about. Dean knew from experience that just about anything could set it off, and with Cas being so new to the whole experience there was really no wonder he was a little extra sensitive. Instead, to help mitigate the awkward silence that had filled the room, Dean had suggested they find a diner for some much-needed coffee and a chance to plan the hunt.
They quickly made their way through the remaining rooms, even though Dean was fairly certain they both knew they wouldn’t find anything – and he was right. The most interesting thing he found was that the bed was unmade upstairs, followed by a half-empty bottle of lube and a pair of fluffy handcuffs in a drawer. He held them up so Cas could see, eyebrows raised.
,” Dean huffed, though he didn’t feel quite so off kilter now he’d heard Cas out. It was still a lot to take in, sure, but he couldn’t begrudge the guy taking a little something for himself – especially when he thought about how he’d found him in April’s apartment. It was all he could do not to shudder at the thought.
“Yes, he’s been watching for a while now,” Cas replied casually, and had Dean… he’d said that out loud.
“Dean –“ Castiel tried again, but Dean shushed him softly as he began dabbing at the worst of the blood at his side.
He refused to admit he was pouting when he pulled his phone out of his pocket, because pouting was for teenage girls. Rowena hadn’t messaged him back, which he had kind of expected, but he did have a missed call from Sam that he hadn’t heard over the noise of the bar. Leaving the rest of his beer (and forcing himself not to glance over at the bar for his sanity’s sake), he grabbed his phone and ducked out of the door, telling himself it was for better reception and listening purposes. If, when he was outside, he decided to lean against the nearest wall and force himself to breathe for a couple of minutes, well… nobody was watching him. It was fine.
It was empty, that much was clear, and Dean pocketed his gun again at the realisation. Light spilled in from the tunnel entrance set into the wall, and that, along with his flashlight, gave him a fairly good impression of the place. Animal bones scattered the floor, but that wasn’t entirely unexpected. He wandered around in a loose circle, keeping to the nearest wall at all times, but the most interesting thing he found was the beginning of a stalagmite forming in the back corner.
Castiel knew how to finger someone. He was also, if the title of the video was anything to go by, a “greedy little ass slut”, which Dean hadn’t known about him before this moment, either. He felt like maybe he was having a stroke as he changed his jeans and underwear, an unsettling sense of calm washing over him as he cleaned his hands in the sink by the door – the kind of calm that only ever settled in right before something terrible was about to happen.
Dean jerked his head up, arms automatically wrapping tighter around Cas’s shaking form even though he gasped softly into the side of his neck, and barely bit down the overwhelming swell of anger that surged in his chest when the creature stepped from the darkened hallway into the room with them and snapped a phrase in a language Dean didn’t know.
“Yeah, it’s…” Sam seemed just as stumped. “You think that maybe… maybe it’s not something supernatural? Could just be a couple of coincidences –“
There was also a sizeable hickey just under Cas’s ear, Dean realised with mounting horror, in the juncture where his neck met his jaw. It was all Dean could do not to imagine the scenario where that had occurred, and Cas’s state of mind thereafter, not to heal it.
A small sob erupted from Cas’s lips, stopping Dean in his tracks. He glanced up, heart leaping into his throat when he realised there were tears spilling down Cas’s agonised face, cutting through the lines of grime and blood. He was shaking again, his body a sparkling constellation of escaping grace, and Dean realised all too late just how traumatised he truly was.
Funny, how a single word had the ability to momentarily shut down every possible argument Dean could think of. He forced himself to keep his eyes on the road, even as he spluttered for an answer.
There was no lock on the bathroom door, because of course there wasn’t. With a sigh, Dean grabbed a relatively clean towel from a pile on top of the toilet and laid it on the sink, along with his clothes. The water pressure was dogshit, but at least it was warm, and he found himself immediately relaxing as he stepped under the sputtering spray. He spent a few moments just stood there, letting the water dribble over his face and neck, while his mind wandered idly to the case.
“Well, wasn’t like we were planning on this happening,” Dean replied, momentarily distracted by a couple of drunk kids stumbling by. They didn’t bother him, minds obviously anywhere other than in their own heads, but he covered the trunk with his body regardless. “Shit, I’m gonna get made if I don’t haul ass. What did you say could kill these things?”
Cas was still looking at him strangely, and Dean had to take a gulp of his beer to distract himself from the fact that he could feel himself blushing.
seen an egg like this before,” she murmured, eyes transfixed on its smooth surface. “I can’t think of anything around here that would be big enough to lay something like this.”
of that was connected to anything. “You’re gonna have to give me more info, buddy, because this all seems like a bunch of totally unrelated small-town bullshit.”
“You both take your pleasures where you can,” Cas continued, eyes flicking from Dean to Sam and then back again. “I am simply doing the same.”
Uniforms bustled around, wrapping tape around the trees to cordon off the bank of the creek. A forensic tent was being erected, and a gaggle of people stood in a half circle by the water’s edge. Dean straightened his tie and then ducked under the nearest tape, flashing his FBI badge at an officer who immediately came trotting over with a startled expression on her face.
“You’ve been busy,” he quietly marvelled, proud for reasons he couldn’t quite express. Cas knew how to do all this because
you looking at Cas’s bare ass?” Sam asked, squinting down at the laptop like it was going to bite him. “On a… gay porn site, of all places.”
“Alright! Well, I’m pretty much packed – just need to get the FBI jackets out of storage – and then we’re good to go. You might wanna grab anything you think you’ll need and –“
The door swung open when he pushed it, already unlocked. He risked a glance at Cas, because that was pretty weird, right? Cas seemed to be having similar thoughts, because he silently drew himself up to his full height as if bracing himself for a fight.
“Yeah, I’m okay,” he insisted, and it wasn’t even a lie. Not a big one, anyway. “I’ve got a gift for you, anyway, courtesy of some cave I found near the campground.”
Dean felt his bottom lip start to tremble a little, and rubbed his hand over his face before he did something stupid like burst into tears. Sam
Once the girl had packed their items and swiped Dean’s card, she handed it back to him with a cool indifference that he had sadly come to recognise from twenty-somethings now he was getting older. He refused to let it bruise his pride any more than it already was, and instead took the card with one of his signature smiles.
His eyes were shining in the light of the laptop screen, crinkling at the corners like they did only when he was genuinely happy. His smile, which Dean had always thought was pretty goofy, pulled his whole face up, made him seem younger than usual.
“Last minute decision,” Dean lied again, eyes flicking back to the body at their feet. “Just crossing the Ts.”
It was barely mid-afternoon by the time they settled back into the motel room, but Dean already felt like he’d gone a couple rounds against a sledgehammer. While Cas dragged one of the bedside tables to the bottom of the bed in order to act as a research station, Dean dropped onto the mattress and found himself drooping back against the lumpy pillows. God, he was exhausted. His brain was pounding an agonising heartbeat against his skull, and after a moment he had to shut his eyes to try and stave off the migraine he knew was coming for just a little while longer.
“There are caves like this all over the park,” she told him once she realised what he’d found. “They don’t go very deep – usually animals make their nests in them.”
They had vaguely introduced the idea of condoms and birth control after the mishap with April and Cas’s angel blade comment, but hadn’t gone any further than to slap a box of condoms in front of him and point him in the direction of a sex ed website. Dean hadn’t been able to stomach the idea of having The Talk with Cas then, and he was certain he still wasn’t ready to have it now, either.
. It had been hard enough for Dean to wrap his head around the fact that Cas had slept with April while he was human, but now? With his angelic mojo back? And with a
Dean span on the spot, already waving to catch the attention of the nearest paramedic. He came trotting over, brow furrowed, and Dean gestured to the gloves that were sticking out of his breast pocket.
He stepped away from them with another quick nod, already pressing the phone to his ear. Cas picked up on the third ring.
“Sure,” the sheriff nodded, and then gestured to the ranger beside him. “This is Anna Paxton, head ranger for the park. I’m Bill Davis from the county sheriff’s office.”
It was the girl who spotted him first; her eyes widened, and she withdrew her hand quickly as Dean stormed towards them. Cas cocked his head to the side, turned away from the counter to see what had spooked her, and had the audacity to
Lilah passed them both a new drink, something that tasted like paint stripper smelled, but said nothing about the seating arrangement as she found her own seat and said, “Okay, Emmie, truth – do you have a crush on Scotty Dreyfuss?”
Out of control, like Sam being possessed by Gadreel. Like Metatron, and the Mark of Cain, and dying –
it was, and wondered with no small trepidation what kind of animal was big enough to warrant it. Peering over the thorny lip, he counted six blood-red eggs huddled together in the middle, each one bigger than a grapefruit.
But he was an idiot, and they both knew it. When it came to Cas, he was the biggest idiot in the world.
He demonstrated, shuffling the balls around until the black ball was safely nestled in the middle of the third row. Satisfied, he pulled the triangle away and set it down on the table by his beer.
Pulling himself up, he swung his legs over the side of the bed and, reluctantly peeling Cas’s coat away from him, he shifted until he was perched on the end of the bed beside him. He’d been working hard, Dean realised, as he looked over the stacks of paperwork with Cas’s chicken scratch handwriting scrawled all over it. He’d propped Dean’s laptop open, too, on what looked like an old newspaper scan. There were at least four other tabs open with similar-looking links.
“Talk. To. Him,” Sam reiterated, pausing between each word for effect. “Before I knock your heads together.”
“I don’t… I think so?” Davis shrugged helplessly. “I’m sorry, it’s been a crazy couple of weeks – I didn’t notice.”
“Some kind of spell,” Cas groaned, teeth barred and impossibly white against the red of his skin. “He used my blade, but it didn’t… didn’t kill me, and I – it
“I don’t have a lot of people in my life I can count on,” he murmured, uncharacteristically honest, but if he was about to spend eight hours in the car with the guy, he had to lay this out first. “You’re up there at the top, buddy. And I’ve always just… I’ve taken for granted that me and Sam are up there for you, too. But that’s… I shouldn’t take that for granted, I know I shouldn’t. It’s selfish of me to assume you’ll always come when I call, because you’re allowed to form friendships,
“Make it seem like they’d drowned to cover up the drained blood?” Dean muttered, and then shook his head. “It’s sloppy, that’s for sure.”
him - and if it weren’t for his seatbelt, he would have been flung directly through the windshield as that realisation made him slam the brakes on the car. He felt winded, and not just because the belt had pulled a tight burn across his chest.
Dean nodded, taking point, and raised his gun once again as he ducked through the doorway and descended to the basement below. He didn’t know what he had expected to find, exactly, but… it certainly wasn’t what he was met with at the foot of the stairs. He skidded to a stop, felt Cas smack against his back before he could stop himself, and they both just stared in silence for a couple of seconds at the scene in front of them.
“The internet seems split on a definitive definition,” Cas hummed, once again staring down at his phone.
Dean glanced around them, at the scorched ground and felled trees, the cracked rocks and residual smell of ozone drifting past on the breeze, and realised he had absolutely no idea what the hell they were dealing with.
Dean, in the midst of his meltdown, had accidentally prayed to Cas. He closed his eyes for a moment and squeezed them so tightly together that he saw spots behind his eyelids, and had to take another couple of deep breaths before he could speak again – before he could even begin to form a cohesive thought.
Dean felt like all the wind had been knocked out of him, and he had to suck in a breath to steady himself. Cas
Dean pretends he's okay, Cas sees right through it, and John Winchester proves (once again) just how much of an asshole he really is.
“And… no dice,” Sam admitted. “There are a couple of ancient gods that potentially fit, but not with the rest of the stuff you’ve just told me. I wasn’t really holding out hope for that being the answer, though, to be honest.”
Drew lived fifteen minutes from Bobby’s by car, in the nice part of town where Dean had very rarely gone. His house was at least twice the size of Bobby’s, but nowhere near as homely; Dean said as much to Bobby as they pulled up outside, and the old man had smiled warmly at him.
. Dean drifted over to a table along the back wall and peered down at what looked to be a half-completed spell. A book lay open and handwritten words in a language he didn’t understand stared back at him. Ingredients – some he vaguely recognised, and some he had no idea about – littered the surface, actively rotting, and the smell caught in the back of his throat.
always come when you call,” he whispered, voice a little too raw for Dean’s liking. “But you have to understand –“
“I don't know if they will work,” Cas murmured as Dean showed him a half empty bottle of aspirin. “I am still an Angel –“
“You think I didn’t jump in the car the second I got off the phone with you last time?” Sam asked, and now he was actually paying attention, Dean realised he could hear the sound of an engine in the background.
I've updated the overall content warnings, but in case you're subscribed and haven't seen - this one gets kinda dark. TW for IMPLIED NON-CON (nothing actually happens but Cas is under a spell and neither of them can be sure what really happened), BLOOD, GORE, CUTTING.
Cas nodded again, ear brushing Dean’s cheek, and Dean studiously ignored how good it felt. Instead, he focused on helping Cas draw the cue back, and only reluctantly let go to take a step back when he was completely ready. Cas stayed down, pressed against the table, and made his shot; the cue ball hit its intended target dead on, and it shot directly into the pocket with a satisfying crack.
was, “before your opponent, okay? But, again, the black ball is separate. You don’t pot that until the end.”
“Why am I looking at Cas’s bare ass?” Dean asked, still not quite able to believe that those words were coming out of his mouth.
“Yep,” Dean nodded, though he knew she couldn’t see him. With a final glance around the cave, he secured his hold on the egg and headed back for the tunnel. “I’m coming back out – I’ll show you.”
Dean gave him a quick run-down of events, from the condition of the bodies, to the freak storms, and then the nest of eggs they had found.
He was still wearing the same clothes, Dean realised immediately. It didn’t mean anything, of course, but it seemed to ease something dark and boiling inside him a little, because surely that meant for certain that he and Cas hadn’t…? He found he couldn’t really finish that thought.
, Dean could admit that Cas was a good-looking dude, but he didn’t have to be gay to see that. Was it really so wrong of him to want to protect his best friend, new to the ways of the world (though not, apparently, as new as Dean had originally thought), from getting hurt?
“So…” Dean grinned, and risked slapping Cas on the shoulder – friends did that, right? It wasn’t too obvious? “You ready to go break into some dead lady’s house?”
“Yeah,” Dean agreed, because he knew all too well how good the stuff was. “These are gonna need stitches, I think. I’ll let this stuff do its thing – patch your side up first – and then I’ll come back to it, okay?”
Between one gasping breath and another, as his come dried on his chest and his dick deflated in his hand, he snapped back to himself. The high of orgasm immediately trickled away, back into the corners of his mind to make way for terrifying, nauseating reality. His breath continued to come unsteadily, but now it was with a hitch of rising panic rather than satiated bliss.
“I’m gonna take a shower,” he informed Cas, already moving towards the suspiciously clean bathroom. “We’ll start in on the case tomorrow; even if you’re not tired, I sure as hell am.”
“Nothing to talk about,” Dean replied quickly, and took a large gulp of his beer just to wind Sam up. “Whatcha got there?”
“No, that’s…” Dean had to clear his throat, and then, because he was apparently a sucker for punishment, asked, “You, uh, have a nice time?”
Once he was done, he passed the glass back to Dean, who put it back onto the bedside table. He simply peered at Castiel for a moment, watching for any signs of him worsening, but after a moment it was Castiel who looked away, eyes cast down to where his hands now rested on his knees.
And Dean, because he knew none of this was really Sammy’s fault, forced himself to calm down. His brother was an ass, but he was a well-meaning one, at least.
“Dominic queried my willingness to be filmed during our initial conversation,” Cas continued, oblivious as ever. “I had no qualms, about that, or him publishing it.”
“I am able to heal any infections I might catch,” Cas hummed, and Dean very nearly choked on his own spit. “Unless there is a chance of pregnancy, I usually leave the decision to my partner.”
Cas must have seen something in Dean’s expression – what, he wasn’t entirely sure himself – because he shushed him gently and ran his hand back through his hair. It should have made him panic, he thought distantly, such an intimate touch, but it just felt so good, and Dean was so tired, and he could barely keep his eyes open. It was selfish, taking advantage of Cas’s kind nature like this, but he couldn’t help himself.
“Not… frowned upon,” Dean replied with a sigh, because there was no way this was going to end before Cas got the answers he was looking for, apparently. Best to rip the band-aid off nice and quick. “It’s just… an acquired taste, I guess.”
The kid rung him up quickly and handed over a key, obviously keen to get Dean as far away from him as possible. Dean felt bad for just a moment, but settled back into exhaustion before he could really beat himself up too hard. He turned to leave, but paused when he spotted a rack of flyers by the door, all advertising local attractions. They were still on a case, he figured, as he plucked a particularly…
Dean stuffed his face full of burger, and tried not to think about how he could still feel the impression of Cas’s hand against his own.
Dean finds something that might help them with the case, has an infuriating conversation with Sam, and comes to a life-changing realisation.
before. Bobby had also, after taking a long look at them both, bought them each a pair of sturdy boots, as well as a handful of new t-shirts and pants. Sammy, after years of Dean’s hand-me-downs, had even gotten a couple multi-packs of new underwear and socks. It was the most money anyone had ever spent on them, and Dean had tried to decline, but Bobby had been insistent. Plus, Sammy hadn’t stopped smiling as he’d paraded around the store in his boots, which he had refused to take off; Dean didn’t want to be the reason that smile disappeared.
“There’s nothing to be done,” Cas replied, resigned. “And it’s… not all bad. I meant it when I said the act of physical love is near-miraculous. It is. It’s the feelings that come with it that are… overwhelming.”
Dean shook the sheriff’s hand as he got to his feet, eyes fixed on the body all the while, and only forced himself to focus once the man started speaking.
“You remember what happened?” Dean asked, already cataloguing the meagre first aid supplies he knew they had for infection and stitches in his head, and whether or not he should call Sammy to pick some more up on his food run.
“Go on, get,” he’d ushered, and Dean grinned as he hopped from the car. “You just be careful, y’hear?”
No, but seriously, I know I'm an asshole. I'm officially announcing that there probably won't be an official posting schedule from here on out, but that I WILL NOT leave the next chapter as long as I did this time. I'm hoping?? for one chapter a week from here on out, as a general idea.
He was just beginning to think it was a stroke of luck that he wasn’t particularly claustrophobic when, out of nowhere, the floor suddenly opened up and he toppled down onto a cavern floor below. He landed heavy on his arm, and pain, sharp and jarring, zipped all the way up his body. It wasn’t broken, he decided gingerly, but it sure as hell was going to leave a bruise.
As he continued to eat, the bar around them began to fill. It was obviously letting out time, because a lot of the patrons still had work uniforms on as they sauntered through the doors – store workers and labourers, and a lot in between. By the time Dean had mopped the last bit of sauce up off his plate with an onion ring – which he had put a huge dent in, too – the place was buzzing with conversation and laughter. It didn’t seem like quite so much of a dive now it was so full of life.
For just a moment he thought about ignoring it, letting it dwindle by itself, but it had been a long day, and his body was clearly telling him that he needed to relax. Forcing himself not to think too hard about it, he reached for some of the complimentary moisturiser sat on the corner of the tub with all the other toiletries. It didn’t smell of anything, and he knew that meant it was better for sensitive skin, so he portioned some into his hand and then reached down to tease the head of his dick.
“You know,” Dean sighed, laying the hurt in his voice on real thick. “If you didn’t want to do this hunt with me, you could have just told me –“
Instead, as he made himself turn back towards the bar, he did what he always did when he didn’t know what else to do: he called Sam.
It was pretty bad. His shirt, which was usually pristinely white, was wet with blood, stained from Cas’s armpit right down to his belt. Dean hissed with sympathy, and was grateful when Cas at least didn’t fight him as he began to unbutton his shirt. In any other moment, he might have been embarrassed, undressing his friend like this. His fingers shook a little as he pulled each button free, but that was just adrenaline wearing off, and maybe a little bit of fear. There was no room for embarrassment here – Cas needed him, and that was all that mattered.
That feeling had soon disappeared, however, under the crushing excitement the girls dragged into the house with them. They’d both dressed up, putting Drew and Dean to shame, and were toting enough snacks to feed a small army as they bounced through the door.
had no issues with it, and he felt slightly ill at the thought of any random perv getting their rocks off to Cas’s face, his mouth, his ass, his cock.
He could do this, he told himself firmly. He could keep his feelings locked up tight and go on like they always had – he had to.
Dean cast his mind back to the motel, and the thunder he had been able to hear near constantly all night. They had stayed some forty miles away; could it really have been the same storm that had kept him up all night?
“I’m gonna do a food run,” he announced afterwards. “If I take a shower first I don’t think I’ll have the energy, and I’m starving.”
“Cas,” Dean replied, trying to hide the relief in his voice. “Where the hell are you, man? Sam’s found us a case –“
He was right, but it was still a lead, and Dean refused to let anything deter him now they finally seemed to be getting somewhere.
“I don’t think it would be appropriate to exchange pictures of our genitalia in such a public setting –“
room, all drab and sad looking and devoid of any personal touches, but his, nonetheless. “He brought this guy
, and he knew Dean didn’t like tomato – not only knew, but had enough foresight to customise his order so Dean didn’t have to do any extra work.
Emmie squealed out a laugh, but all of a sudden it had seemed very far away, as though Dean had been listening down a tunnel. Drew had frozen up beside him, and when Dean had risked a glance at him – heart suddenly thudding in his ears – he looked unsure of himself for the very first time. It was strange to see uncertainty on his face, Dean thought faintly – it didn’t look right.
“Coming from you? That usually indicates it’s something to be extremely wary of,” Cas hummed his agreement. “Are you close?”
Dean hated how his voice sounded, all tight and raw. He tried to swallow, but it felt sharp in his throat, and he almost choked before he could force another breath into his lungs. Distantly, he was aware that his cheeks were wet, but he made no effort to wipe the tears from his face.
Cas huffed, a noise Dean had come to recognise as fond exasperation, and continued, “I only mentioned it because there was a dog at the nurse’s station. The nurse said he was a therapy dog, but I was unaware that canines were capable of completing the necessary psychology examinations in order to qualify as a trained therapist.”
Dean could no sooner come up with a sensible answer to that than he could fart the alphabet. Instead, a string of garbled noises escaped his mouth, sounding a lot like a wheeze of pain, and he banged his head against the surface of the table to shut himself up.
“Where have you taken him?” Dean asked, though he already had a couple of ideas. “If you’ve hurt him –“
“Okay,” Sam replied, voice quiet and cautious, as though he was dealing with a spooked animal. “Well… I think I might have something for you.”
“Of course not,” Dean replied as he hooked the flamethrower’s leather strap over his shoulder, snagged a machete to stuff into the back of his pants along with his trusty .45, and slammed the trunk closed. “I’m gonna pretend to play nice, get Cas out of there, and
“We fell for it, initially,” Cas shrugged one shoulder, “and the local law enforcement seem stumped.”
“This is…” Cas didn’t seem to be able to find the words he was looking for as he stared around them with wide eyes. “Some of this feels
removed his shoes and outer layers, and Dean stared for a moment at the cute, smiling bumblebees that adorned his socks.
The room was exactly as gaudy as he had expected. The green and purple wallpaper auto-triggered his gag reflex, and he had to take a deep breath of stale air to sooth himself. There was no kitchenette, no extra chairs or a table, and barely even a wardrobe, which stood without doors in one corner. The bed itself didn’t seem horrendous, until Cas perched on the end of it and grimaced at the pushback from the mattress.
“It’s as good a guess as any,” Dean shrugged. “So, take your pick – you wanna hit the morgue, or the forest?”
“Actually,” Sam cut him off with a furtive glace to the side. “Garth has asked for an assist on a Wendigo case down in Mississippi. I thought… maybe you and
To his credit, Castiel really tried. His left arm went up with little effort, but he only managed to raise his right past his chest before he grimaced in pain and held it tight against his body again. That was more than enough for Dean; he was across the room in seconds, crouching by the bed as Castiel dropped heavily back onto its surface.
“The first victim is named in an article from the 90s,” Cas explained. “Michael Turner, then thirteen, was charged with property damage after being dared to graffiti a local house by his friends.”
. He knew Dean so well that he had specifically requested no tomato for him. Dean was very aware that he was being stupid, that it wasn’t a big deal, that Cas had literally rebuilt him from atoms and knew him better than he sometimes knew
“That was my initial thought, too,” Cas agreed, “but that doesn’t account for the natural phenomena, or explain why the bodies are found in the forest, drained of blood.”
“It might deter anyone from wandering in until we can decide what to do about the basement,” he shrugged, and Dean nodded.
It had been fine – nice, even – until Cas had woken up, pulling Dean from his floaty place of half-sleep with him. He’d immediately frozen, body thrumming with tension against Dean’s own, and it was only as he’d rolled quickly away that Dean had realised the thing poking his thigh
In all his life, Dean had never moved as fast as he had that evening when he’d heard his father’s voice. He’d dropped his cup as he flung himself away, completely out of the chair, and he’d had to catch himself before he fell directly into the firepit, alcohol making his legs a little wobbly. For just a second he had been still, trying to piece together what on Earth had just happened, when, through the flames, he had seen his father stood in the doorway.
But Cas’s hand in his hair was making it exceedingly difficult to do any of that. In fact, under the warm weight of his trench coat, which let out a burst of Cas’s scent whenever he moved underneath it, Dean found himself slipping back towards sleep alarmingly quickly. He wondered, as his eyes fluttered closed and stayed that way, if Cas was trickling grace into him with his touch, because he suddenly felt completely content.
gay than having an attractive lady’s hands down your pants). Even then, he’d been mightily resistant; it just wasn’t something he was
An ancient Greek deity had gone rogue a hundred or so miles from Bastrop, Texas. The farming community out there had been struggling with a bad harvest and diseased animals, suddenly turned around only as bodies started dropping. Cas had called them in, and it had been pretty cut and dry from there – find the source (in this case, a cult of leathery farmers sacrificing people in exchange for healthy agriculture), gank the deity, and set the cult straight. With everything going on in the wider circle of their lives, it had almost felt nice to be beaten up by common garden maniacs again.
Cas levelled him with a distinctly unimpressed look, and then pulled the laptop towards himself again. He brought up a local map in a new browser tab, and quickly pointed to an area of open land on the outskirts of town.
He immediately regretted saying that, because suddenly the full weight of Castiel’s gaze was directed solely at him, and it was
“Well, I used the in-app messaging system, but it’s effectively the same thing, yes?” Cas asked, head tilted ever-so-slightly to the side. He was no longer blushing.
“Were the other bodies in the same condition?” he asked, already glancing around the immediate area for other clues that might have been missed.
Dean huffed. “Fine, whatever. So the kid was an idiot – all kids are. How does that connect to him being found without any blood thirty years later?”
He set it against a nearby wall, not even short of breath as he lifted it with ease, and then levelled a gaze at Dean that seemed to ask
“Okay!” Dean yelped, a little louder than was strictly necessary. “Yeah, you – go take a shower, man.
“For most of the night!” Dean defended, and had to run a hand over his eyes; his headache was coming back, too. “We got dinner, played some pool while I waited on some intel from Rowena, and then this guy started making eyes at Cas from across the bar. It wasn’t like we could do any more for the case tonight, so I suggested he go over and talk to him. How was I supposed to know that was our guy?”
“This might hurt,” he apologised in advance, moving the towel closer to the deepest part of the wound. “I’m sorry, okay? I have to clean it out.”
He shifted uncomfortably, torn between the ache between his legs and his moral compass. He remembered, once, that he’d spotted an actor that kinda looked like Sammy – he hadn’t been able to jerk off for a week after that. Why, then, did he not feel the same repulsion when it came to actors who looked like Cas? He’d guiltily jerked off to a couple of lesbians that reminded him of Donna and Jody a couple of times, but at least they were
Instead, he swallowed a lump that was threatening to form in his throat, and asked, “What time is it?”
A soft moan immediately drew his attention, drifting through the stale air from the bedroom up ahead, and Dean found himself moving before he’d even made the conscious decision to do so. The flamethrower had come to hang against his chest as he’d stumbled, and he snatched it back up as he prowled towards the door, his heart in his throat as he adjusted the strap across his back. He toyed with the lighter in his other hand, every muscle in his body coiled and ready; he edged the door open with his elbow.
The waitress excused herself with a squeak, quickly disappearing through an employee door that Dean assumed led to the kitchen. He imagined the whole staff would be aware of what had just happened within a couple of minutes, and had to rub a hand over his aching eyes to try and stave off the start of a stress headache.
“No, dude, of course not,” Dean reassured him quickly, though he was honestly not entirely thrilled by the revelation either. “You like what you like – doesn’t matter as long as it’s fun and safe.”
“Garth asked for me personally,” Sam cut him off again, not unkindly, and Dean had to force himself not to curse. “Something about needing someone tall –“
“Well, that’s when the trouble really starts,” Sam murmured. “When its tied to a witch, she has control. There aren’t many first-hand accounts, but most of the lore seems to suggest that, if the witch is benevolent, the Impundulu would be, too. They don’t have to kill – they can survive on cow’s milk and still retain all their power.”
“I know what you think of me, Dean,” he whispered, bitter, after a few moments of tense silence. “An angel of the Lord, unconcerned with the intricacies of the human condition. Untouchable, unruffled. Your faith in that is kind, Dean, but unjustified. I am…”
“You should go talk to him,” Dean found himself saying, with no memory of having actually thought those words at all.
“Flirting is much easier on the phone,” Cas frowned, and Dean hated the way it pulled his whole face down.
changed, because nothing had happened – he’d just taken a shower. He hadn’t become intimately acquainted with his prostate, and he certainly wasn’t still thinking about Cas in that
He took a deep breath, feeling simultaneously calmer and a little like his head was about to explode all at once, and then grabbed his laptop and bolted from the room. Sam was the first person he found, researching something-or-other in the library, and Dean swept his books clean off the table to clear way for his laptop with still-shaking hands.
It was as they’d suspected, but still interesting to have confirmed. Dean nodded thoughtfully, eyes raking over the information in front of them.
“Dean?” Cas asked, voice drawing Dean from his thoughts even though it was quiet. “Is this working? Do you need me to keep going?”
It really was. As he’d landed, there was a brief moment where Dean thought he’d just keep going and fall right through the damned thing to the floor below. It held, but barely, and gave a wheezing groan when he shifted his head against the pillow. But, despite that, Dean found his eyelids getting heavy, the need for sleep outweighing the irritation of the springs that were jabbing him even through the comforter.
Cas pinned him with a hard expression, and for a moment Dean thought he might snap at him, or scream at him, or simply turn tail and walk away. It made him feel nauseous to think about; this was why he didn’t talk about feelings, dammit.
Panic filled Dean’s chest so quickly that he was surprised he didn’t choke on it as he snapped, “I will kill you
Dean didn’t know if it was the warm fullness in his gut, the second beer they’d ordered, or the way the lamp above them gave Cas an ethereal glow, but something made him feel brave. He pushed his plate away, spotting an empty pool table over Cas’s shoulder, and reached for his hand again with a grin on his face.
“Come on,” he murmured, and tugged Cas to his feet with his beer in his other hand. “I’m gonna teach you how to play pool.”
“I can’t wait that long, Sam,” Dean shook his head, feeling a little nauseous at the thought. “I can’t just leave him that long.”
“Not here to cramp your style,” Dean promised, even though he suddenly felt a little bit sick. Why was he pushing Cas away like this, again? “I’ll just, um – I’ll wait around for a little while, finish my beer, but if it looks like it’s going well, I’ll leave you to it. You can – call me if you need picking up, or something.”
He found it a few thrusts later, and his whole body jerked, eyes almost rolling back in his head at the intensity of it. His legs were starting to quiver, struggling to hold him up, and his balls were drawing up tight against where his hand was still flying across his dick. He was close – it was only going to take a couple more seconds –
Cas nodded his head, as though something was decided. “Well, none of this is going anywhere. We should find dinner and pick this back up tomorrow.”
They’d had to follow the creek a couple of miles before there was a place thin and shallow enough to cross safely. It had then been a trek back the way they’d come on the other side of the embankment, and Dean was starting to think it would have been worth getting wet and cold just to wade through a deeper part of the creek and cut their hike time in half.
“This place seem a little… too clean to you?” he muttered, tailing Cas through a door that led to the kitchen. It was a little dated, like all mid-century houses were, but spotless in a way that even lived-in houses usually weren’t.
was what Cas was worried about? He was a better friend than Dean, that was for sure; met with the choice between a near-sure thing with possibly the most attractive person in the entire world and finishing a crummy game of pool, and he was actually
Cas whimpered again, wrist trembling against Dean’s fingers as he fiddled with the lock, but didn’t say anything else as he forced his breath to even out and his body to still.
With both hands full and unable to balance him, it was harder for Dean to scramble back up the tunnel, but he persisted, and found he breathed a little easier as he pushed himself through the mouth of the hole and stumbled back out into the fresh air. Miraculously, the egg was still intact. He handed it to Paxton, who took it with reverent fingers and held it up to the light to better see it from all angles.
He had meant it to sound reassuring – to make Cas feel better about whatever it was that seemed to be bothering him so deeply about this. When he finally chanced a glance across the car, however, he realised that he must have made a terrible mistake. Cas’s eyes, usually the warmest blue, were icy as he stared to the road ahead. His jaw was clenched tightly, as though he was afraid of what might come out of his mouth if he wasn’t careful.
“Well, yeah,” Paxton continued with a bob of her head. “The weather reports have been pretty off recently. Campers come expecting it to be a little chilly, sure, but we’ve been having
a bear,” he tutted. “Unless they come at me with tiny knives, I think I can probably take on a couple raccoons without blowing their heads off.”
“You’re better at this than you’re letting on,” he huffed, failing spectacularly at sounding annoyed. “Making me pull out all my best moves.”
And just like that, Cas hung up on him. It was a relief, honestly, because Dean knew from experience that he would have kept rambling until he physically couldn’t speak anymore, digging himself deeper and deeper into a hole that he was already struggling to pull himself out of.
Dean raised his own arms above his head, and though his back twinged, Sam didn’t seem to notice. He even did a little jig to prove he was okay, and Sam nodded his head with a huff of laughter.
Cas stared at him for a moment more, expression unreadable, before tilting his head in the approximation of a nod and turning back to the table. Dean forced himself to breathe a little easier, found it even worked now Cas’s big blue eyes weren’t piercing his soul, and took another step backwards… just to be safe.
Dean’s breath caught again, but he had expected it this time, and was able to make himself breathe through it. It still wasn’t bad, he told himself firmly, even as he squirmed a little. It wasn’t bad, but it was
“And intimacy… it can be platonic, too,” he continued quickly, feeling just a little too exposed. “Wanting to be close to someone, to share lives with them… it doesn’t have to include sex. Me and Sam, we’re probably as connected as two people can get, but I’d rather cut my own nuts off than even
Sam was holding his open laptop, a small stack of papers resting on the keyboard. For a moment Dean thought he was going to push the beer issue, but instead he shook his head and held the laptop out, waiting for Dean to shove his barely eaten breakfast to the side so he could place it down in front of him.
The video had disappeared – not that Dean was keeping tabs on it, because he had already decided that he wasn’t going to think about it – and he hated himself even more, because all he could think about was the fact that Cas must have been in contact with Dominic again to ask him to take it down. That meant they were still in touch. What if they continued to stay in touch? What if, now Cas seemed to be unlocking other human aspects of his psyche, he decided to fall in
That piqued Dean’s interest, and he felt the tension in his body starting to dissipate a little bit as he asked, “Yeah? What kind of something?”
He’d offered Bobby one last wave before knocking on the door, and heard the car pull away behind him. Drew answered almost immediately, as though he had been excitedly waiting on the other side of the door, and offered Dean a toothy grin as he’d herded him into the spacious living room.
Cas rolled his eyes as though that was a stupid question, and then reached for the door handle. Dean thought he might mojo the locks open, or maybe even pull them apart, but instead he gripped the handle and kind of just…
And it wasn’t even like he watched it every time he decided to jerk off. More often than not he liked to keep to what he knew, so it really wasn’t a big deal. It wasn’t like anyone was ever going to find out, either, so he refused to let it worry him. It was his little secret, and who was he hurting?
seen it bent like in the thumbnail before), but it had to be a freak coincidence. There was no way it could actually be Cas.
Dean forgot, sometimes, that Cas could sense things in a way he couldn’t. He could only imagine the kind of signals this room must be giving out, and shuddered all over again at the thought. He didn’t have any kind of angel mojo, and even
He parted ways with Paxton back at the campsite with a (false) promise to mention her to his superiors if it turned out the egg
Heart already hammering in his chest, Dean hauled himself as quietly as possible back into a standing position, and then ducked down to pull Cas’s coat free of his ankles. It immediately felt sticky in his hands, and as he drew it closer to his face, he realised with mounting horror that it was tacky with blood.
to reach out and pull Cas towards him, wrap him up in his arms and never let go, and it struck him all over again how terribly, devastatingly stupid he had been – how stupid he was
He lined his shot up, not aiming for potting anything so much as just getting himself out of the situation Cas had unwittingly put him in, and managed to successfully chip the ball straight over Cas’s and into his own. If Cas made a small noise of surprise, well… Dean had already decided he wasn’t showing off.
He really regretted not packing a pair of hiking boots. Shoes were something he tended to splurge on – he always had to be ready to run, and having them fly off or the sole wear down could be the difference between life and death in their line of work – but his $200 FBI Oxfords were definitely struggling in the deep underbrush and rocky terrain. Paxton seemed to find this somewhat amusing, which did even less for his already souring mood.
“They didn’t have any twins,” Dean apologised, dropping his bag by the door so he could take a closer look around the room – there really wasn’t a lot to take in.
Hell, it was likely the guys in the video were straight, too! There was nothing like the thought of a fat pay-check to get your dick hard, after all, and what little Dean had seen looked too well-lit and staged to be anything other than a company job. The male anatomy was complex; a lot of things could get a guy hard for no damn reason at all.
Now he was looking, he realised the coat wasn’t the only article of clothing scattered across the landing. Cas’s tie had caught in the leaves of a sad-looking house plant, his stained shirt a stark contrast against the dark green rug in front of the bedroom door.
Dean’s legs very nearly gave out. He managed to throw the hand that had been on his dick out to steady himself, otherwise he would have smacked his head on the shower wall. His chest was still heaving, ass clenching now-painfully around the fingers that had stilled inside. He withdrew them, slowly, and grimaced at the emptiness that was left behind. For a moment, he waited for the panic to set in, legs still shaking as the water washed away any evidence of what had happened. He’d just fingered his ass while thinking about his best friend – his best friend, who was clearly in
Dean paused for a moment, touched by Cas’s concern. It was unwarranted, of course – Dean could definitely handle himself – but it still felt nice to know someone cared about his wellbeing. Not a lot of people did.
means you aren’t obligated to reply to them if they continue to message you,” he added, before removing his hand so Cas could take the phone back. “You don’t have to sleep with them just because they show a little interest.”
with whatever conclusions he was obviously jumping to, which just put Dean even more on edge. Sammy didn’t have a single clue what was going on, but damned if Dean was going to bring it up if he didn’t have to. He could think what he liked – Dean knew the truth, and he knew that Sam would drop whatever he was thinking sooner or later.
And so, suddenly very alone, Dean slunk back to their miraculously still empty booth and bedded down by the window, consciously not glancing across the bar to see how it was going. He heard Cas laugh, distinct against the other raised voices, and that was all he needed to know.
Dean had withdrawn further at school, too; his grades were slipping, his homework barely done. He’d made an effort to at least be polite, if not friendly, with the other kids, but even that went down the drain as he’d closed himself off, hunched at the back of his classes in a manner he knew looked standoffish. It was necessary, he’d told himself, to stop any of them from getting too close. It was pointless, trying to make friends, when he was just going to have to leave again.

He put his full bodyweight against the car door and fell unceremoniously out onto the empty tarmac below, gasping for air, choking back tears, sight swimming and head pounding. His whole body was trembling as he fell onto hands and knees, desperately trying not to retch, and it was all he could do not to collapse completely.
– but close enough that the numbing agent would start to do its thing and make the whole area feel a little less tender.
The bluffs loomed ahead, rusty and imposing, and Dean stared up at them for a moment, awed. A bird cawed somewhere ahead, out of sight, and he felt suddenly very connected to everything around him, and ridiculously small.
“Who – who is this?” he managed to ask, forced himself to sound braver than he felt, because everything was starting to slot into place in his mind, and it was like his chest was on fire.
“Alright,” Sam acquiesced, letting out a slow breath. “Well, I’ll have a look around the bunker, see if I can’t match any of the reports to anything we have in the lore.”
Cas wasn’t angry, Dean noted distantly, only tired. Resigned. His expression, a tangle of defiance and hurt, made something in Dean’s chest twist painfully. The problem was that he didn’t
“So,” Bobby had hummed, turning the full weight of his gaze on Dean. “You gonna dawdle in here all day, or are you gonna scoot?”
Sam just sighed, watching Dean with an unreadable expression as he got to his feet. He snagged the bacon off his plate, but pushed the rest towards Sam – a habit from when they were kids that had stuck ever since. Sam stared at him for a moment more, but eventually picked up Dean’s fork and went to town on his eggs. Counting that as a win, Dean crammed a rasher of bacon into his mouth to hide his fond smile, and headed for the door.
And yet… Dean’s stomach had other ideas. It grumbled loudly between them, reminding him once again of how hungry he was. He felt his cheeks heating up a little when Cas stared at him, and shrugged.
Except the way Sam had started looking at him made him think that maybe he was suspecting something to the contrary. Worse, he seemed
They dropped Sammy off first. It had been decided the little brainbox would skip a grade, start middle school early instead of going into fifth grade. Dean couldn’t say he hadn’t been worried about that, but the middle school was a ten-minute drive from Dean’s school, rather than the twenty-five it would have taken to the elementary. If Sammy needed him, he could be there in no time. He’d said as much as Sam climbed out of the car, had reminded him to wait out front for him so they could walk home together at the end of the day, and Sam – so small amongst all the other kids – had simply rolled his eyes and disappeared into the fray.
Cas hesitated, but then reached out to pull the four victims’ reports from his pile of papers. “Maybe? A lot of the town’s records have been uploaded onto their website, so I ran the victims’ names through the search function to see if anything linked them – “
There's some fairly graphic descriptions of a dead body in this chapter, but it's important to the plot, so proceed with caution!
“Fine!” she’d admitted, to the whooping guffaws of Lilah. “He has pretty eyes, okay? And he was really sweet when he helped me carry my diorama home last week. Did you know he volunteers at the dog pound on weekends?”
“Thanks,” he murmured, and even though it made his throat feel a little constricted again, he really meant it.
“No, I’m – it’s fine,” Dean lied quickly, and forced himself to take another deep breath. “You got a reason for calling, or just checking in –?“
“I’m still not really sure how this will help your investigation,” Paxton confessed as Dean straightened again. “But feel free to take a look around. There are marks on some of the other trees just ahead, and there are some broken rock formations a little further still.”
He got back to his feet and went back to the bathroom, filling a glass he found in the medicine cabinet with cold water. Castiel was exactly where he had left him as he walked back to the bedroom, so he placed the water on the bedside table and crouched at his feet again, hands going back to the first aid kit.
“- usually attached to a witch as her familiar. The lore says they’re immortal, passed down from mother to daughter, and they usually… well, let’s just say it’s not usually a platonic relationship.”
“Angels do not perceive gender and sex in the same manner as humans,” he replied briskly. “I am drawn to some over others, true, but not because of their genitalia. I’ve found there is actually very little difference in the way a vagina or penis stimulates my –“
“Yeah, me neither, but there’s a motel around forty minutes from the site, and a town full of people that might know something, so you in?”
