Dean hated leaving Castiel behind, so he was eager to get this case over and done with.  He and Sam waited while a different officer pulled up the surveillance from the liquor store.  They were hoping there was a clear shot of Berry’s eyes so they could confirm if it was a shifter or not.  Fortunately, the retinal flare was clear from the footage and, just like that, the hunters knew what they were dealing with.  Of course, catching a shifter would be a tough job, especially since this one may have just committed the robbery and skipped town.  It didn’t help that he had a day’s head start.
Sam cursed, feeling so useless on the floor, as he watched the vampire land on Castiel’s back, arms clinging around his shoulders.  The vamp bit Castiel’s neck and the angel cut its arm off, unfazed.  Unable to maintain a grip, the vamp fell off and Castiel beheaded it.  In the meantime Dean had killed the only two remaining vamps, and he rushed to Sam.
“I know, but why couldn’t I control myself?  This body… I hate not being in control of my reactions.  I couldn’t—I tried to—to overcome my fear and failed.  I’m a warrior of God, Dean, but the sight of Sam in those clothes…”  Castiel shook his head, slowly.  “I just, I managed to retain my composure for the most part this morning, but with the knife it—it was too much.”
“Just, I get it, okay.  I hear you, but I don’t care about that right now. Just, c’mere.”  Dean tugged at Castiel’s arm and as he stepped forward, looking confused, Dean pulled him into a hug.  With one arm low and the other high on Castiel’s back, Dean squeezed Castiel tightly and rested his chin on Castiel’s shoulder.
The living room and kitchen were clean and cheery.  Dean wandered and discreetly produced the EMF reader.  Castiel was standing nearby, listening as Sam interviewed Maya, who was sounding a bit confused by the line of questioning about cold spots and abnormal behavior.
Castiel didn’t stop looking at him, as he and Bobby each took one of Castiel’s arms in case he needed help walking again.  They only took a step before Castiel came to a halt and touched Dean’s arm to get his attention.
“Only long enough for me to tear them off you,” Dean said, fingering Castiel’s lapels and brushing his hands along his chest.
“Hey, man. Yeah, it’s me.  Are you okay?”  Dean spoke gently, struggling to keep his hands to himself after the pained look Castiel gave him.
“Let me finish, Dean.  What I did to Sam, it’s unforgivable.  I will do anything to convince you of my regret.  I’m certain it’s possible to make amends—”
Sam had pushed one slick finger inside of him and already Castiel couldn’t help tensing or the uncontrollable trembling in his leg. Sliding his long finger in and out a few more times, Sam forced his second finger in a little too soon and Castiel inhaled sharply.
Briefly, Sam worried that Dean would flip.  He had explicitly forbade Sam from ever mentioning Lisa or Ben to him again after he had Castiel wipe their memories.  He supposed he had never given Castiel the same command though, because Dean was looking at him curiously as he chewed and swallowed a large mouthful.
“I had no idea, Cas.  You should have said something.  It’s not a problem.  I’ll just throw those shirts away,” Sam said, adamantly.
“Sam, I had to,” Castiel interrupted, stepping closer to the youngest hunter and fixing him with a penetrative stare.  “Your father and brother don’t have a healthy relationship.”
It continues that way for a while and even fuels a few regular dreams where he gets to do more than just kiss those scowling lips.
Misha’s voice was so different from Castiel’s and even though he looked the same, when he broke character and dropped the Castiel act, it was like night and day to Dean.  It was even worse than the future version of Castiel he had once encountered when Zachariah had sent him to an eerie potential 2014.  As disturbing as that had been, at least there was
When Dean had seen the massage oil for sale at the gas station, next to the lube and condoms, he had thought it seemed like an excellent idea to get some.  Turned out he was right, as usual.  Dean knew how much Castiel loved to be touched and a gentle massage was evidently no exception.  Feeling proud of how the angel was turning into putty in his hands, Dean started to switch from his lower back to his arms.
Disbelieving, Sam looked to his brother, who looked just as shocked.  Slowly, Sam said, “So, so you killed 50,000 people for us?”
“I noticed that too.  Teresa Casey and Katherine Farrell, they both lived in this neighborhood, Mount Greenwood, it’s got a large Irish population.  Do you think it’s relevant?”
Dean chose not to comment on the fact that Castiel made it sound like he might not have tried to break free if Dean were still in danger.  It was preferable not to think about that scenario.  Instead Dean thought of the burnt shifter and wondered aloud, “Was the shifter in the circle with you?  Did you knock him into the flames?”
The first time it happened was the day his cute new roommate moved in.  While carting boxes, moving furniture, and getting himself set up in the spare bedroom, Castiel had pulled his shirt off, wiping at his forehead.  Dean couldn’t really blame him for that, it was an unseasonably warm spring day and the guy had been working for hours.  Dean had helped him move some of the larger stuff, but Castiel had insisted on doing most of it on his own.
“Yeah, uh, dad’s right,” Dean began and Castiel realized that Dean’s loyalty to his family was going to keep him at a distance.
“Uh, actually, Cas I was hoping I could talk to you first,” Sam began as Bobby walked into the next room and busied himself at his desk.  He was far enough away to give them a little privacy, but still within sight.
“So, were you just never going to tell me, about what I did?” Sam wondered, with slight irritation in his voice, before adding unnecessarily, “To Castiel.”
“Oh.  Well, he just was never a very sound sleeper, but I guess that’s changed,” Sam said, still speaking softly.  “Would you want to do more things like this, Cas?  Things that are fun for the three of us?  Not mission based.”
“About time, Princess,” Bobby teased Dean, as he walked up to the car with Castiel a little way behind him.
Was Sam just assuming Dean was a horn-dog and he couldn’t control himself alone with Cas?  Where would he even get that idea?!  Unless…
When Sam led them all out back and got into the driver’s seat of the Impala, Dean felt a fresh stab of annoyance, but his grumbling that they were using Baby to carry out their evil plans fell on deaf ears and he found himself sitting in the back with Cas.  It was hard to keep his mouth shut about Sam’s sucky driving.
“Who cares, Cas?  Sam wouldn’t have minded, hell, he’ll probably get rid of the clothes.  And it’s not ‘trivial’ or stupid or whatever else you’re thinking.  We both want to know if something is upsetting you, so just talk to us, okay, man?  You don’t have to try and handle all this shit on your own.”
Dean cleared his throat and forced himself to respond. “I did regret it, but not for long, Cas.  I don’t, um, I don’t kiss men, so I was confused, but I liked it too.”
Sam could read the honesty in Castiel’s expression and he had to quickly look back down at the paper in his hands.  He nodded without looking up.
“You’ll probably be fine, just no telling my brother about our time together. He’ll just be pissed at you. Plus, you don’t want me to have to punish you like this again, right?”
The angel modified his position, sliding closer to Dean with his head under his chin.  They stayed like that for a while in relative silence.  When Castiel’s hand slipped from Dean’s shoulder to the bed, Dean realized the angel might be sleeping.
Backing off the bed and settling in between Castiel’s knees, Dean pulled his pants and boxers down to his shins.  Castiel’s engorged cock sprang free and Dean felt momentarily doubtful.  He didn’t really know what he was doing, maybe he should have researched.
“So, yeah.  Uh, maybe fire, belts, probably hates anything that would impede his movement, and, uh, humming.”
He could feel himself blushing, the back of his neck got hot and Dean cleared his throat into the silence.
Castiel had succeeded and had tricked Crowley into using dog blood for the spell.  Crowley asked Castiel how his ritual had gone and by way of response Castiel began glowing.  It got so bright, Dean and Bobby were forced to close their eyes and even had to raise their arms to shield their eyes further, since the brightness was too intense and absolutely white.  Dean could feel the light all around him as power, different than Castiel’s usual energy, it surged and filled the room in a way that made Dean’s breathing difficult, before it was receding as Castiel once again reigned the power in.
“I know I’m being an ass here, Cas.  We can still talk about the stuff with Sam if that’s what you want, but I have nothing to say about what happened the other night. Okay?”
Something about the casual response made Dean pause.  This wasn’t some weird accident.  Cas wasn’t embarrassed
Dean couldn’t help but push his hips down so that he could rub himself over the hardened length in Castiel’s pants.  It was difficult for Dean to maneuver the way he wanted to, but it was enough and he found himself repeating the satisfying dragging movement that gave them both the friction they craved.  The knowledge that Castiel, Angel of the Lord, was horny and gasping against Dean’s lips and skin had Dean moaning in return and drunk with desire.  Dean got his hands underneath Castiel’s shirt where it had rucked up and he promptly ran them up and down his sides and back relishing the bare, heated skin, so smooth under his fingertips.
Fuck Dean Winchester.  It was bad enough he’d already had to buy different lube that was evidently better for anal play, but now Castiel was going to have to buy a dildo to get off the way he wanted to, because his fingers and these angles just weren’t cutting it.  Masturbating used to be so simple.  His damn roommate had to go and ruin it.
So they both knew already.  That was unexpected.  Dean thought he had plenty of time to sneak around with Cas and make up excuses, while he figured out how the hell he might bring it up to Sam.  He hadn’t really planned on telling Bobby at all.  And here was Castiel, squeezing his leg in a comforting way and promising that everyone important to him already knew and accepted it easily.  It seemed too good to be true.
They had left Dean in the parking lot, where he seemed surprisingly agreeable to be on his own with the Impala for a bit.  Castiel had stood between Sam and Bobby, lightly touching their shoulders and then releasing them a moment later when they stood in Bobby’s kitchen.
When the young guy in the main office told him they only had one room left Dean looked up at the ceiling in annoyance.  He glanced out the window at Sam and Cas who were standing by the Impala.  Sam was pulling their bags from the trunk.  Drumming his fingers impatiently, Dean asked about other motels, but the dude only shrugged and said it’d be in the next town which would be forty minutes more driving.  Dean made a snap decision and got the room.  It was already late.  It would have to be fine for one night.
Dean’s little theory, that Castiel somehow knew to keep public displays of affection to a minimum, was completely blown out of the water on their third night at Bobby’s.  Sam was putzing around in the kitchen with his laptop and Dean was in the next room sitting and relaxing on the couch with a drink and a forgotten newspaper next to him.  He was idly watching Castiel, who was inspecting Bobby’s bookcase.  Not long before, Bobby had retired upstairs to his room, probably seeking some privacy, since he wasn’t used to having such a full house.
“You, uh, wanna talk about it?” Dean offered.  “And I deserved to be shoved, Cas.  No harm done there.  I should have known better than to, well, to grab you like that.  I didn’t mean to scare you.”
Both hunters were quiet for a minute.  Sam brought a hand to his mouth, looking at Dean, and then broke the silence.
Dean was very distracting, walking around the room in his boxers.  It was a little unusual, especially when Dean kept leaning against the door frame to the bathroom and raising an eyebrow at him or stretching his arms while making loud sighing noises.  It seemed like more stretching than was probably necessary since Dean usually only did that when he was first climbing out of the Impala or if he had some sort of injury, but Castiel didn’t question his actions.  For some reason Dean accompanied his irregular behavior with inconsequential questions.
Cas can always tell when Dean’s dreaming about him, and well, once Dean moans his name it feels like an invitation.
Dean made Castiel try on a pair of boots similar to his, but he seemed convinced the rest would fit him without trying it on to confirm.  Once they were back in the Impala Dean decided it was as good a time as any to bring up what happened last night.
Dean grinned, apologetically, for interrupting two beings who had the power to kill him with a thought.
Dean was satisfied that Sam had raised his eyebrows in surprise.  Good.  Samford always thought he knew everything.
There was a dull thud from the other room and if Sam had to guess, he would say Bobby had just dropped some ancient book.  Sam couldn’t help but be confused.
Katherine Farrell had lived on a third floor walk-up above a café.  She had one roommate, Maya Itami, a petite woman who answered the door and looked up at the three men in surprise.  After carefully examining their FBI credentials, she reluctantly let them in and Sam smiled at her in a reassuring way, before he started with questions.
Sam fucked Castiel roughly for another dozen thrusts or so before his hips were bucking erratically and he came inside the angel.
“Maybe a little warning next time, Dean?” Sam was staring past Castiel at his brother. “I don’t know why you need to corrupt Cas with your hedonistic behavior right in the living room, but maybe, wait until everyone is gone next time.”
Of course, it led them to the same diner they had been in earlier.  Sam and Dean went in alone.  Eve was there and all the people inside were monsters.  They lost their weapons depressingly quickly and Eve explained that she was there to protect her children.  She told them she wanted Crowley dead since he had been hunting and torturing her first-borns.
“Dean, I do everything that you ask.  I always come when you call.  And I am your friend. Still, despite your lack of faith in me and now your threats.  I just saved you, yet again.  Has anyone but your closest kin ever done more for you?”
“Should be easy,” Dean said, shrugging.  “Do a bit of flirting, drive him to the motel, Cas’ll fly the two of you and we take care of him inside.  You got your spare key on you to get into the trunk?”
Two days later it was time to leave Bobby’s.  Sam had found them a new case in Tennessee and Dean wondered if they could find a motel with a pool to help familiarize Cas with being in water.
“Shut up, Sam.  Listen.  First of all, this case, Cas got lucky knowing what monster it was.  It would have been a bitch researching it without you.  And no way can Cas replace you as a hunter.  That idiot is shit at talking to people and that’s what we do 90 percent of the time.  So I need you here, too.”
Dean was mainly kidding Castiel, thinking the angel could wring out his layers as well and maybe borrow a shirt from Dean if he wanted to.
“You look so fucking good, Cas,” Dean said, pressing a hand between Castiel’s shoulder blades and then running it down his back until he reached his ass.
Castiel dipped his head towards Dean again and Dean pulled him downwards as he stretched up to crush their lips together ardently.  He curled his fingers around the edge of Castiel’s neck and brought his other hand to rest on the small of Castiel’s back to hold him close.  It was Castiel who nudged Dean’s lips apart with his own, as he eagerly sought out Dean’s tongue.  Dean readily allowed him in and then sucked at Castiel’s lower lip, while the angel huffed little breaths into Dean’s mouth.
“Fuck! You bitch,” Sam said loudly, yanking his injured hand back and then unskillfully smacking Castiel in the face with it.
Trying to force the two of them into conversation, Dean told Sam to tell Castiel about sirens, since they were similar to the ghancanagh.  Dean didn’t know if Castiel knew about sirens or not, but he listened when Sam started talking about the one they had encountered and rambling on about the lore.  Castiel asked a few follow up questions and Dean felt satisfied that he was behaving normally.  When he suggested a second topic to Sam, his brother went along with it again, but when he made an attempt to steer the two of them into a third discussion, Sam made a face at Dean and changed the subject.  That was probably for the best since Dean was getting sick of hearing him babble about shit he already knew anyway.
The pamphlet must have been more interesting than what Dean had to say, because Castiel didn’t look up.  Not wanting to be ignored, Dean moved closer and put out a hand to ease the material away from Castiel.  Looking up, Castiel regarded Dean inquisitively.
“Is he breathing?” Dean demanded, before moving his hand briefly in front of Castiel’s mouth and answering his own question, “No.  Maybe angels don’t need to breathe.”
Dean sighed and looked down at himself.  He had wound up half naked, while Castiel was still wrapped up in his long-sleeved, layered shirts and the too big sweatpants.  Wondering which direction he had thrown his shirt in, Dean cast a glance at the floor but didn’t see it.  He wasn’t exactly sure how he had let himself get so carried away, well, apart from the fact that he evidently both desperately wanted Castiel and wanted to please him.  It hadn’t been his intention to rush into sexy times, not when he knew that Castiel had only ever experienced the very worst that sex had to offer.
The warmth and weight of Castiel against Dean was calming and reassuring.  Dean hadn’t expected to be wrapped up in Castiel’s embrace, he really didn’t do cuddling.  One night stands didn’t lend themselves well to the intimate activity and although he had occasionally held Lisa in bed and enjoyed it, there had still been something missing.  She knew lots about Dean’s life as a hunter, but she didn’t know everything.  That was Dean’s fault, for withholding information he didn’t want her to know, for fear of rejection.  But Castiel knew about the worst things Dean had done and the angel,
“Nope, not a problem, though I’d advise against cooking bacon like that,” Dean smirked at him over his mug of coffee.
It was instantly clear that this was the wrong thing to say when Castiel confusedly tried to respond.  Miraculously, Castiel somehow had enough sense to refrain from finishing his doomed sentence.
“I’m gonna use hands, Cas.  They feel good everywhere else, it’ll be good there too,” Dean promised.
Back at the apartment, Castiel wore clothing even while Dean was out.  He didn’t like it, but when he thought of taking them off he remembered that Dean had essentially accused him of
Dean had said they could fix things, but Castiel wasn’t entirely sure what was broken.  It was true that he had lied to Dean and the others, but initially it had been to protect them.  Lying had seemed a good choice. Castiel knew Dean lied to protect Sam, so Castiel saw nothing wrong with lying to protect Dean.  Castiel hadn’t wanted to drag Dean back into the realm of hunting and fixing another End of the World sized issue.  The hunter had done enough and Castiel had thought he could manage Raphael.
Sam hopped out of the circle easily. Castiel was still on the floor with his arms tied behind his back and he was glad Sam was leaving but he was still trapped, injured, and powerless. He wondered if he would die if Sam left him there. None of his injuries were life threatening, but he knew he lost a lot of blood and his vessel was severely weakened. How long would he survive locked in this circle without his grace?
“Cas, come on,” Dean tried again, desperate to get the attention off of Sam, because if Castiel was feeling righteous, it would be easy to imagine him tossing Sam into hell for his sins.
Dean and Bobby hurried forward on either side of Castiel and Dean gripped his shoulder to roll the unmoving angel onto his back.  His friend looked terrible, but he had already looked that way and didn’t appear to have any new injuries.  Bobby felt Castiel’s neck and Dean left his hand resting on his arm.
Dean was definitely being weird. He was sitting on his own bed, but he seemed to just be gazing steadfastly, contemplating Castiel, who was apparently resting again, maybe sleeping.  Sam didn’t miss the drink in Dean’s hand either.  That might be a new record, it wasn’t even 8am yet.
Castiel took his time before he said, “You said I don’t have to tell you about it.  Well then, what would we talk about?”
I kissed you.  I didn’t intend to upset you, but I thought, admittedly it was a little strange, the situation, yes, but I did think you knew, that you were
“You know, Cas, a lot of Sam’s clothing looks the same.  I bet he’d wear shorts all the time if you wanted, maybe add some pastels into the mix.  Definitely less threatening that way,” Dean smirked at his brother, who glared bitchily back at him.
Dean was dully aware that he was the one crowding in on Castiel’s personal space for a change.  Well, good, Cas did it to him all the time, let’s see how he liked it.  The angel frowned down at Dean’s hands, but he didn’t make an attempt to remove them.
“I mean it.  You’re new to kissing, Cas, and Dean’s done it plenty of times.  Don’t let him push you into it if you’re not comfortable.  He’ll listen and if he doesn’t you come tell me.”
Dean hums as Cas fidgets, trying to direct Dean’s fingers to that same spot again. Of course, Cas wanting it so bad always gets Dean’s motor running and as soon as Cas sees that Dean is turned on he generally gets pretty handsy. This time is no exception and he reaches for Dean, grabbing at his coat and reeling him in closer, wanting a kiss.
Locking the door and pulling the curtains closed, Dean secured the room and looked around at Castiel who was perusing a pamphlet with motel information.
When Dean entered the kitchen, Castiel was surprised to see him.  Preoccupied with tracing the crack in Bobby’s table, he hadn’t heard the hunter coming down the stairs.  Dean had looked fleetingly worried, but he relaxed when he caught sight of Castiel.
Slowly, the angel withdrew his arms from Dean and turned away from him.  Dean moved close, wrapping his arms around Castiel’s stomach and chest, while pressing himself along Castiel’s back and licking his neck.  Fleeting goosebumps sprang up on the angel’s skin as Dean skimmed his hands across the angel’s chest, teasing his nipples.  Castiel seemed uncertain about what to do with his hands and he brought one back to grab Dean’s ass while the other settled on his arm.  Dean kissed and bit gently along Castiel’s neck and shoulder while his hands dropped to undo the angel’s trousers.  He dipped a hand into Castiel’s pants, rubbing him through his boxers, while grinding himself against the angel’s ass.
They didn’t speak much until they arrived at Teresa Casey’s apartment.  Fortunately her sister, Teagan was at home and she knew a lot more about what was going on in Teresa’s life than the other vic’s roommate had.  She knew her sister had talked about a handsome man named Finn, whom she hadn’t met.  Evidently, her sister had suddenly fallen out of contact with the man and had been searching for him.  She had even talked about hiring a private detective since she was desperate to find him.
“Um, well I haven’t noticed anything, but I’ve only see him like, what, twice, since I got my soul back?  And I don’t remember anything before that from the past year, so I’m not necessarily the best person to ask.”
“It’s a shortened version of Castiel,” the angel replied, glad the man didn’t extend his hand in greeting.  Dean and Sam would have considered his refusal to shake it as disrespectful, and they would have been correct.
Castiel was assertively kissing Dean and impatiently tugging his outer shirt off.  It fell to the floor behind Dean and immediately Castiel had one hand grasping his short hair and the other pushing his shoulder against the door.  Castiel bit his lip a tad harshly and Dean cursed, moving his hands to grip Castiel, intending to change their positions and take charge, but the angel didn’t want to be moved. He carelessly batted one of Dean’s hands away and caught the other arm in a tight grip, pinning it effortlessly above Dean’s head.
Sam pulled out the paper again and read over the list once more.  It was sort of a sappy gesture, but the words meant a lot to him.  Sam knew they were genuine and since they were coming from his friend, the angel Castiel, whom he had hurt so unequivocally, he felt like maybe he could believe them.  If Castiel still believed in all the good in him, then there was hope.  Folding the paper smaller, Sam tucked it into his wallet for safe keeping.
"Please don't," Sam says and rubs at his eyebrow. “Okay, so you really want to indulge Dean in this fantasy?”
Instead of bringing Sam up to speed vocally, Dean signalled that there were still seven vamps upstairs and eight downstairs.  Altogether, it was three times as many as they’d guessed.  Gesturing to the stairwell, Dean ascended the stairs.  Castiel followed him, stepping where Dean had, and Sam thought the angel managed to be even quieter than his brother.  The first room had two beds and three more sleeping vamps.  It was simple to take them out the same way they had for the first three.
As Dean drove Baby away from Bobby’s, with Castiel sitting next to him and Sammy in the back trying not to complain, he felt kind of excited about what the road had in store for them.  He knew that Bobby and his welcoming nature and endless support would always be in his rearview mirror or a phone call away when Dean needed him.  Sam and Castiel weren’t all better yet, but the endeavor Sam had been making to repair the damage between them was substantial and Dean appreciated his brother’s efforts.
Pushing Castiel gently away from his mouth, Dean spoke to Sam without taking his eyes from Castiel’s.
“’Cause if you do, the angels will kill you,” Dean supplied. He didn’t like the sound of that at all.  Cas was right, he couldn’t go.  He had to stay with Dean, where he would be safe.
Castiel set Dean’s change on the table and Dean raised an eyebrow at all the money, but said nothing.  Having eaten most of the food, Dean moved on to the pie.  He scooped a small piece onto his fork and held it out to Castiel.
“Don’t take this personally, but I’m late now,” he said, without heat, as he turned away .  Dean spotted him sucking a finger before he ducked into the bathroom and ran the water.
“That was good, Cas.  Keep talking to me, don’t leave me in the dark,” Dean said, before he quickly kissed his way back down Castiel’s torso.
So that was where this was coming from.  Dean had told Castiel that Sam mentioned leaving.  Sam couldn’t even manage to be upset by that.  He looked from the paper in his hands to Castiel, who was gazing at him sincerely, and Sam knew none of this was coming from Dean.  His brother may have told Cas what was going on, but Dean had no involvement in what the angel was trying to do for him.
“You were askin’ for trouble, asshole.” Dean tried to step forward to be next to Castiel instead of slightly behind him, but, without looking back, Castiel extended his arm to block Dean’s movement.
Dean laid his hands on Castiel, cupping his face and then sliding one hand back to flit through the hair at the base of his neck, while the other slid down his jaw and settled along his throat.  Leaning into Castiel, Dean savored the feel of his friend’s hands slipping under his shirt and traveling up his back.  Dean kissed the angel a bit more insistently, mentally exchanging the ghancanagh’s touches with Castiel’s.  He had his fingers spread across the side of Castiel’s neck, directing his jaw with his thumb and index finger.  Dean didn’t realize that he was holding Castiel’s throat a little too forcefully until the angel easily pulled his hand away, rerouting Dean to his chest.
They drank and ate their food, while Dean enthusiastically regaled Castiel with an old story about the time Sam had a streak of bad luck due to a cursed rabbit’s foot.  It hadn’t been funny at all to Sam when it happened, but listening to Dean laugh and the gleeful look on his face had Sam smiling too.
Some of the behavior probably shouldn’t have surprised Sam, like Dean fixing Castiel’s tie and straightening his coat to make him more presentable to pass as FBI or how he’d absently touch Castiel’s arm or back to prompt him to move through a door or towards their table.  Dean would stand too close to Castiel, something he had always scolded the angel about in the past.  The frequency of their staring showdowns hadn’t diminished even though they were constantly together.  Sometimes they’d stare like normal, but there would be a small smile playing on Dean’s lips that made Sam uncomfortably concerned that they had forgotten he was there and he worried that they might start going at it right in front of him.
“Look, Cas.  I don’t really know what to do here.  You seem kind of pissed.  Why don’t we hold off and try tomorrow night?  I’ll touch you however you want, I swear.”
message, something sexual that was causing Sam to look so wide-eyed.  But Dean quickly pushed that thought away, Castiel wouldn’t have the first clue about leaving raunchy messages.
“Maybe,” Sam shrugged.  “The nurse said they would cry, sometimes for hours.  The woman, Casey, she smashed the TV when someone put it on to try and distract her.”
“Look, Cas.  It hasn’t been that long, it’s gonna take time for you to feel okay around me.  You don’t have to force it.  If you’re uncomfortable let me know, or Dean or, heck, just fly away and come tell us later.  And you don’t need to force yourself to trust me.  I can earn that back over time.  Dean was an idiot to tell you to just ignore everything and then act like nothing was different.  It
Dean rolled onto his back, taking Castiel with him and appreciating the warmth of the angel pressed against his body.  Weirdly, he felt as if he could be content just kissing Cas for hours.  Somehow it was like Castiel was worming his way further and further past all the barricades Dean built to protect himself over the years. And now that the angel had finally snuck in, he had promptly kicked them all down for good measure.  Dean was so screwed—far out of his comfort zone and hardly caring at all.
“Maybe you’re right, Cas,” Dean relented, thinking of Sam’s texts.  His brother hadn’t said anything judgmental, he had only seemed protective of Castiel.  When Sam had been trying to convince Dean that Castiel was in love with him the other day, he hadn’t made it seem like a bad thing, just a simple fact.  Dean had been the one to make a big embarrassed deal about it.
The water was only up to their knees, but Dean knew that if they kept still little schools of fish would come flitting closer eventually.  Dean wondered if he’d be able to spot any other wildlife, insects, snakes, maybe a frog.   Cas would have a fucking field day with a frog.  Castiel had been trailing his hands in the water, but when Dean told Cas to stay still he became a freaking statue, staring down and waiting.
Dean looked from Sam who was giving him puppy dog eyes, to Cas who was completely engrossed in the worms, to Bobby who had taught him how to fish years ago and he felt his objection shrinking.  They were already here, it was a nice day, and Sam had sneakily gathered all the supplies they’d need.  Dean figured he could sit by the water and drink beers for a few hours.  There were worse ways to spend a day.
“Sorry, babe, it’s massage oil.  It’ll warm up,” Dean promised, ignoring the endearment he had unthinkingly thrown out there.
Sam and Bobby started in on the questions and Castiel avoided answering, deflecting and stalling from giving a full response. And Dean was so tired of the bullshit.  He felt a weariness in his bones as he watched Castiel, confused and defensive and negotiating that they release him and he’d explain.
"Was that the first time it happened?”  Dean wanted to know.  It might have been since Castiel didn’t sleep, so it’d be less likely for him to be caught off-guard.
Producing a card, Sam thanked the woman and they left.  Back on the street, Dean ducked into the coffee shop while Castiel stood out front with Sam.  It was breezy out and the street was busy with people.  Castiel thought Sam was looking at him and was trying to decide if he should look back or say something when Sam’s cell phone rang.
Dean was in a good mood.  Ganking vamps gave him a rush of adrenaline and afterwards, when he had hopped out of the shower, Castiel had been there, sitting on the end of the bed.  Castiel was always there for Dean.  He had saved Sammy’s life earlier and Dean just had to straddle the angel’s lap and kiss him in thanks.  Dean tried to convey through touch what he couldn’t bring himself to say in words.
That had come out a bit bitchy.  Dean wasn’t trying to be an ass, but he was just in a bad mood.  Honestly, it was good to see Castiel.  Well, it would be good as long as he wasn’t going to use Dean as a decoy again.
“Sorry!” He apologized hastily.  He just couldn’t believe it.  So much had happened since then, and Castiel had probably just been confused the whole time.  And Dean, what was he even thinking?
Oh.  It was blatantly clear to Dean why Castiel was so distressed now.  This was definitely something they needed to talk about.
Eventually he got it more or less right.  Castiel often had tea in the evening and Dean brought him a steaming mug after dinner one night, pressing the ceramic into his hands and launching into it without preamble.
“I’m not crazy about it either, Cas, but it makes sense.  Okay?  So we’ll check it out and figure out what’s going on and take it from there,” Dean said, as he plugged one of their spare phones in to charge.
knife. Castiel dropped the bags. The glance and smile that Sam had first given him changed to an expression of confused alarm.  Sam stood up with the knife still in his loose grip, it wasn’t raised, the hunter had all but forgotten it.
Their skin slapped loudly together as Dean slid over and over into that tight channel, fucking fiercely into him.  Castiel cursed and shuddered, clamping tightly around Dean as he moaned and painted white, hot ropes of come onto the couch beneath them. He shook through his orgasm, coming hard and fast and Dean found he wasn’t far behind, completely turned on by Cas coming untouched and the way he clenched around him.
Looking out the door, Sam gloomily watched Dean join Castiel and Bobby by the car.  Castiel’s calm expression brightened when he saw Dean approaching.  Sam felt a bit like an outsider as he observed the three of them.  Bobby and Dean were both able to help Castiel in ways that Sam couldn’t.  Remembering the look of terror on Castiel’s face when he walked into the kitchen the night before, made Sam’s stomach churn.  All his efforts to watch out for Castiel and he’d still screwed it up.  The problem was
I didn't get any feedback on the last chapter which had a lot of sex in it.  I have more sex written into future chapters and think it's appropriate so I'll probably leave it, but was there like too much? Or was it awkward? haha I don't know.  If you have an opinion on it let me know.  It was a lot of the chapter, but there hasn't been much smut in this fic so far.  Not sure if people want more of that or not...  Anyway, not important, just sort of wondering.
Dean moaned in approval and Cas responded to the encouragement, grasping his short hair more tightly and holding Dean’s head still as he moved faster.  There was something undeniably sexy about being naked on his knees in front of a still clothed Cas in his immaculate suit.
“Maybe.  I didn’t exert much energy, but I feel mentally fatigued,”  Castiel said and Dean sat up, bringing the angel with him.
Castiel wasn’t expecting to see Dean naked again, but he did the very next night.  The sugary scent of baked goods greeted Castiel as he entered the apartment and Dean called his name before popping out of the kitchen with an absurdly large smile on his face.  He was naked except for red oven mitts and a jaunty chef’s hat perched on his head.  Castiel fought against the quirk of his lips, wondering where Dean had gotten the hat.
It wasn’t a good feeling to know that Castiel was looking miserable and confused because of Dean, but it couldn’t be helped.  Dean would have gladly avoided this conversation forever; it wasn’t his fault Castiel insisted on trying to go there.
It had been his intention to tell Dean what was going on, but his brother didn’t seem to be doing so well after what happened with Castiel and Sam couldn’t bring himself to disappoint Dean over something else.  It could wait.
It was inconceivable to Sam that Castiel would ever look at him again, let alone talk to him, after what he had done.  How could Castiel even stand to be in the same room as him?  His friend had trusted him and Sam had taken terrible advantage of him.  Sam didn’t know how to fix it, but he had to try.
Despite attending to his morning wood in the shower earlier, Dean was finding himself aroused by Castiel for the second (third if you counted thoughts of him in the shower) time that day.  Ignoring the fact that it was broad daylight and that they hadn’t pulled off into secluded trees or something similarly private, Dean found himself achingly hard and fumbling to undo his jeans to alleviate his discomfort.  He whispered assurances to Castiel that it would just make them both more comfortable, as he clumsily untucked Castiel’s shirt and loosened his belt and trousers as well.
“Don’t be in such a rush, Cas,” Dean scolded as he closed the distance between them, keeping his lips close to the angel’s, but not touching him.  He stopped Castiel’s hand, which had been at his belt.
“Then touch me and let’s continue,” Castiel demanded, gripping one of Dean’s wrists and moving his hand onto his stomach.
“You guys up?”  Sam asked, holding out a coffee to Dean.  “I got one for Cas… I don’t know if he’ll want it.”
“Uh, yeah.  I guess, that would be true. But, well, okay.”  Dean was struggling and tried to start again, “Look Cas, I don’t really know
Caroline’s was indeed a long closed restaurant from the looks of it outside.  The building looked like it was in need of maintenance with peeling paint, a cracked window, and graffiti.  There were a couple of neglected looking cars in the parking lot.  Weeds were growing through the cracked asphalt.  The Impala wasn’t there and Castiel wondered if that meant Crowley had captured the brothers somewhere else and brought them here.
“I wanted to, Sam.  You’re my friend.  I know we have this obstacle between us that we need to overcome, but it’s okay.  I know you don’t give up.  I won’t either.  And it is getting better.  Slowly, yes, but we’re still moving in the right direction.  Dean doesn’t want you to leave and neither do I.”
Dean knew what the angel had been up to.  He could feel himself getting hard as he took in Castiel’s flushed appearance and the pink splotches of skin where the too hot water was hitting him.   Castiel’s hair was drenched and rivulets of water were running everywhere down his skin.
“Dean, during breakfast, you called me ‘angel.’  You don’t normally, but, maybe, don’t do it at all?”
Even though he had been saving people and hunting things during his year without Dean, he had also hurt people, killed people.  Castiel, oh god, what he had done to the angel—Sam could barely think about it.  Suddenly, Sam was lurching to his feet, scrambling for a container to throw up into. It was sick, he was sick and what he had done to Castiel, his friend, made him physically sick.
“I hope, for your sake, this is the last you see me,” Castiel disappeared then and maybe it was best that he was gone.  It was terrifying to see Castiel like this, worse than a Superman gone dark side.  Dean didn’t have long to dwell on this though, since Sam evidently couldn’t hold it together any longer.  Sam’s nose started bleeding and he fell to the floor, cutting his palm on broken glass when he caught himself with his hands.
His day at the garage had started easily enough, but the tail-end of his shift had been soiled by Ms. DuBois who was trying to accuse them of scratching up her Mercedes.  Not to mention the asshole who clearly knew nothing about cars, but tried to pretend he did just because he watched a couple of Youtube videos.  Normally, Dean was patient and didn’t mind explaining stuff, but it was the end of the day and Mr. DIY kept trying to correct him.  So Dean was more than happy when he finally got to climb in his car and head home.
After the eggs were ready, Dean and Sam ate in silence for a while.  Dean had enough sense at least not to complain about the lack of bacon.  If his brother had been the one cooking, he definitely would have made some, but Sam was happy with a side of fruit and a slice of toast.
Shamelessly, Dean pushed himself forward into Castiel’s palm, craving more.  The angel’s hand disappeared, slinking under his shirt and Dean’s skin felt electric beneath Castiel’s warm caress.  Castiel smoothed his fingers along Dean’s abdomen and up his chest slowly, skimming over a nipple before arriving at Dean’s clavicle.  Kissing Dean purposefully, Castiel’s tongue invaded his mouth eagerly, as he seized the collar of Dean’s t-shirt from underneath.
Castiel started to reach for the fork, but Dean brought a hand to his arm, stopping him.  He moved the fork closer to Castiel.
“I was intent on trying to handle my problems on my own, but I should have come to you for help.  I didn’t mean to deceive you, though it did make strategic sense at first.”
.  Waiting on Dean, he spooned more cereal into his mouth.  Castiel licked his lips and Dean’s attention was drawn there.  The guy had really nice lips, surrounded by his morning stubble.  Dean felt proud of himself for keeping his gaze so far north, but Castiel’s big, blue, guileless eyes and his mess of dark, I’ve-been-fucking-all-night hair did nothing to help Dean’s thoughts stay innocent.
Castiel was overwhelmed by sensations and he couldn’t help himself when he gasped out Sam’s name, “Sam! Stop, Sam, please…” Logically Castiel wasn’t expecting Sam to stop, so he was unsurprised when Sam tightened his grip on Castiel’s hip and his other hand grabbed at the bonds around his arms and wrists, pulling them towards himself so that Castiel’s back was arched uncomfortably.
Dean had his back to Sam, refilling his coffee, when he asked, “Hey, have you noticed anything different about Cas lately?”
Easing his thrusting, Dean stayed inside Castiel, parting his cheeks and rocking into him, absorbed in watching where they were connected.  Slowly pulling further and further out, Dean groaned when Castiel pushed back, swallowing more of him.
Dean recovered and took up the discussion again.  Despite his bored tone, Death seemed surprised when Dean said they needed him to kill God.
Dean knew he meant it.  He didn’t want Castiel to look away, but, of course, he did.  The wall in front of Castiel was breaking open to reveal a sucking black hole, that made Dean think of when Sam fell into the pit with Michael and Lucifer.
Resigning himself to honoring Dean’s request, Castiel stood silently at the end of the bed, gazing fondly at Dean’s smattering of freckles, the curvature of his lips, the shape of his jaw. Dean’s eyelids fluttered and he cracked open an eye to peek at Castiel.
Objectively, Castiel could see the logic in Sam’s reasoning, but it didn’t make him feel any better.  He concealed his weapon that he couldn’t remember consciously drawing.
Dean nodded and made for the door before he remembered he was only in his boxers and a t-shirt.  He quickly shrugged on his jeans, stepped into his boots, and pulled on his jacket.  Spotting his phone on the table, he grabbed that too, so he could call Sam and yell at him to get his ass back here.
Dean didn’t need to be told twice.  Looking at all the buttons that stood between himself and more of Castiel’s luscious skin, he gripped the shirt with both hands and ripped it open, scattering buttons everywhere.  He had always wanted to do that, but in the past he had been afraid of pissing women off.  Castiel would hardly care when he could fix it with a thought.
A moment later, when the angel started gliding his hand softly along Dean’s arm, Dean knew he wouldn’t be awake much longer.  Something about Castiel’s presence and his gentle touches put Dean completely at ease and tonight was no exception.
“Oh.  Yeah, he does that, but the step-stool thing coulda been on your list too,” Dean said. Castiel only stared at him, like he was trying to determine if Dean was serious.
Not wanting to leave behind so many headless bodies, they returned to the house with their spare canister of gasoline and torched the place.  When they got back to the motel, Dean bossily informed them they would be skipping town as soon as he was out of the shower.  Dean walked away, leaving Sam and Castiel standing in front of the door to Sam’s room.  Sam was a little surprised that Castiel hadn’t moved to follow after Dean, but he didn’t comment on it.  He dug in his pocket for the key.
The request seemed small to Castiel.  The angel had trusted Dean when he asked him to rebel against his brothers and the existence he had known for millennia.
Strictly speaking, Dean has a lot of weird nightmares.  Far more than his fair share. And his life is constantly a bizarre real life nightmare so forgive him if he figures out a way to fucking tell the two of them apart.
The betrayal was too much for Dean—not trusting his best friend—after all Castiel had done for them.  It was hard to stomach.
Desperate to get Dean off his mind, Castiel tried to conjure up the usual repertoire of mental images that he called upon while masturbating, but none of them lent themselves well to his current activity.  He had to think about Dean.  Had to think about the confident, gorgeous asshole who had pushed him into the couch and fucked him until he was weak in the knees and biting the cushions to keep quiet.  The bastard had looked so good in the kitchen sans clothing, too.  It wasn’t fair.
Rationally, Castiel knew Dean didn’t love many people.  Dean loved his brother first and, of course, Bobby and many women for only a night, but Castiel didn’t know where he fit in.  The angel had given so much for Dean and would again, without hesitation.  At some point he had let himself hope that the often overwhelming emotions he had towards Dean might be a feeling the hunter shared.  The kiss had only encouraged that hope, until Dean had repeatedly shot it down and denied it.  It was a mistake, Dean had said.  Castiel was so sick of mistakes.  He felt like he had made too many recently.
“Just remember, you brought this on yourself, Cas,” Dean said grinning, before he chucked the sponge forcefully at Castiel and rushed towards him.  The angel ducked to avoid the sponge and blasted Dean with water as Dean tried to force his hand over the nozzle, soaking them both with the strong spray-back.  His plan had been to take the hose from Castiel, but he sort of forgot the angel had an unbreakable death grip when he wanted to.  Instead he tried to keep covering the opening so it was mainly spraying backwards.  Castiel jerked the hose away from Dean’s grabbing hands.
With the four of them driving together, there had been no extra room for whiskey in the trunk and Dean was really starting to regret letting Sam take it out.
Dean had his gun trained on Sam and the disbelief on his face immediately turned to anger.  He took a step towards Sam.  “You shut the hell up.  And get the fuck away from him,” Dean gestured with his gun.
It was nice at any rate, Castiel felt warm beneath his hands and there was something comforting about Castiel’s familiar scent, though Dean couldn’t remember ever being consciously aware of smelling the angel.  Plus, Castiel was staring at him, as usual, and his eyes—that were way too fucking blue—were hard to look away from.
It was easily the hottest undressing that Dean had ever experienced and he groaned at his immobility, wanting his hands back so he could put them all over Castiel.
“’S’ok I’ve seen it before,” Dean replied, languidly kissing Castiel’s cheek and then moving to his lips.
That combined with the near perfect view Dean has of Cas’s hole devouring his cock and Dean knows he won’t last particularly long at this point. Cas either for that matter. He pulls all the way out and back in a few times relishing the view and savoring the feel of feeding his dick into Cas, of parting that tight pucker like he’s Moses fucking strolling through the Red Sea.
The kiss feels so much more real than normal, but it’s different too, Cas is somehow more stiff and it takes him longer than normal to kiss back.
“So is this what you do now?  Call in the feathered reinforcements as soon as you can’t handle a situation?” John asked, standing to block Dean when he had stood from the bed to cross the room.
To make matters worse, Cas had to have the most seductive voice Dean had ever heard.  It was deep, dark, soothing, and spoke directly to his dick.  Dean was battling a near constant state of arousal, but he had waited too long to tell Castiel that he had to stop now.  He’d have to admit that his spank bank was overflowing with enough naked Cas imagery to jerk it at a moment’s notice.  That conversation would not go over well—Cas was straight, had mentioned past girlfriends and probably wouldn’t appreciate the fact that Dean was constantly thinking of him in the shower.  Not to mention the car.  He had started beating off in there before going into the apartment, just imagining what he’d find Cas doing once he got inside.  It had started as a preemptive strike to discourage hard-ons in the house, but now it was practically a daily necessity.
“Um, I don’t know.  We didn’t really talk about things so… directly.  I think she met someone?  She was in an exceptionally good mood for a few days before she sort of went the other way and started with the symptoms.  She actually accused me of sabotaging her love life.  Exact words, but, like I said, we didn’t really talk about her relationships.  I thought the paranoia was part of her symptoms?  We were never close, but we didn’t really fight.”
Dean had been ready to kill their grandfather when he saw him, but Sam couldn’t quite remember why.  The hunt had only gone downhill from there.  Turned out the thing they were hunting was some sort of mind control slug.  It got into Dean and he shot Gwen.  Sam thought it was in Samuel and ended up shooting him when he wouldn’t stay back.  It got into Bobby and he stabbed Rufus.  They lost him.  Hell, they almost lost Bobby too, trying to electrocute the thing out of him.  It was a day Sam was more than happy to put behind him.  The monsters spewing out of Purgatory couldn’t be taken lightly.
It was definitely the angel he knew so well, but Dean had never seen him like this before.  Castiel was shirtless and his arms were tied behind his back, his hair was hopelessly awry, but matted in places.  He was clearly injured, his shoulder blade looked like it had a nasty welt on it and his hips were a bit bruised and there was some smeared blood on his waist, but Dean couldn’t see where the blood had come from.  Really, Dean could only see his back and arms.  He thought the angel looked a bit dirty as well, like he had been rolling around on the ground.
“No way.  We already skipped lunch, let’s just get something to eat, do some research and start fresh with that tomorrow,” Dean suggested.
Just a reminder: I don't own any of the ideas, characters, or writing from the Supernatural show, but I have borrowed some of it for this story.  Season 6 & 7 Spoilers.
“Dean, I – I was terrified.  The last time I was trapped like that…”  Castiel pressed his lips together and looked away from Dean, out the window.
It took less than fifteen minutes to drive back to the motel. Sam drove leisurely, not at all looking forward to Dean’s bad mood.   After parking, he dug out the first aid kit, picking up the food and the two coffees.  Arranging it all so he wouldn’t drop anything took a moment, but he got it under control and made for their room.  Unlocking the door would present another challenge, so he skeptically tried the knob and was shocked to find it unlocked. That angel must really have his idiot brother distracted.  In their line of work locking doors was a priority and usually something they did automatically.   Balancing the coffees, he shut the door behind him before setting everything down on the small table for two.
He sat gingerly on the edge of the bed and started with the head wound.  Once he found it just above the ear, he gently wiped the blood from the cut, which fortunately wasn’t too deep, but had clearly bled like crazy at the time. There was a raised bump along with the cut; someone had clocked him good.  Dean wiped at the blood on Castiel’s face as well, just to clean him up a bit, and watched as Castiel blinked up at him, finding his face, looking into his eyes.
Sam wasn’t sure what to make of Dean’s reaction, but it was hard to keep a straight face as Castiel offered Dean his water, looking perplexed.  Sometimes Castiel worded things poorly, but that was hardly reason to forget how to swallow.  It wasn’t like Dean to get so embarrassed, anytime Bobby or Sam kidded him, he took it in stride.  Sam looked suspiciously between Castiel and Dean, suddenly worried Dean might have done something colossally stupid behind the closed doors of the motel.
Dean knew right away that Sam had meant something else and he hoped that Sam would abandon the train of thought and just leave Dean to his humiliation.  Unable to meet Sam’s eyes, Dean stayed very still, pretending to be concerned with the label on his beer and
“Now, let’s see…what was the first step?  Trap an angel.  Check.  Mock.  Check.  I think ‘Render Unconscious’ was next.”
“Cas,” Dean tried again.  Castiel sounded sincere, but for a guy who didn’t talk much it was almost like he was babbling.
Moving Cas’s hand to his stomach, Dean grips his hips and slides his ass even closer, so he's the teeniest amount off the edge.
“Oh, boo hoo, not like you’d let either of us drive anyway.  ’Sides, Cas will stay with you, I bet.”  Bobby looked to Castiel to get his opinion on all of this.
The conversation had been brief, but Crowley had made his intentions clear.  Not that Castiel hadn’t been able to surmise what was likely about to happen, but hearing Crowley mention Sam and punishing him with a re-enactment erased any doubt from his mind.  It was confirmation of what he feared.  With this realization Castiel felt slightly numb and unresponsive, like a heavy fog had settled in his mind, making his thoughts sluggish.  His brain wasn’t working properly and even his vision seemed affected—he was staring at Crowley and the shapeshifter, but he was also looking through them at nothing.
“I’m not looking for an apology, Cas.  I was the idiot.  Total asshole move on my part, I just wasn’t thinking about it,” Dean said.  He hesitated before asking another question.
Dean shook his head still looking at the fire and the shifter.  Suddenly, he felt freshly furious looking around the room that Castiel could have been raped in.  He wondered if the room Sam had trapped Cas in had been as nondescript and dismal as this dark, dirty, abandoned restaurant was.
Dean groaned involuntarily, hauling Castiel up by the arms and impatiently shoving him towards the bed, pushing him onto his back and climbing up on top of him.  Arranging himself between Castiel’s legs, Dean positioned himself at his entrance and then forced himself to slow down.  He glanced up at Castiel who was looking all wide-eyed and flushed as he stared back at him.  Crawling over Castiel, Dean kissed him deeply.
Cas smiled and Dean was a little caught off guard by how good it looked on him.  Giving up on his hair, Castiel sighed.  “I hate these events.”  He buttoned the top button on his jacket and smoothed his hands briefly across the front before unbuttoning it and buttoning it again.  He turned to Dean.  “Do I look okay?”
“Well, yeah,” Castiel continued, humoring Dean.  Sometimes Sam thought Dean could get Castiel to agree with him about anything.
While all of that made sense in Dean’s head, he thought that saying it out loud made it sound kind of weak.  Castiel was probably feeling terrible and he was the victim in this and Sam… he wasn’t himself at all when it happened, but it still seemed somehow unfair that he wouldn’t ever know about it or have to apologize.  Dean figured maybe he could apologize on Sam’s behalf.
“No, listen, Cas.  That’s twice you’ve saved the world, billions of people.  Sometimes it isn’t easy to fix mistakes, but it’s your responsibility and it might be hard to stick around and deal with consequences, but it’s the right thing to do.  Look at Sam, he’s helped a lot of people over the years, but just like you, he messed up.  It wasn’t really his fault, but he’s still taking responsibility and trying to fix things with you, even though it’s hard.  I know it’s not exactly the same, but you still can do a lot of good to make up for it and you’ve got plenty of time, right? Angels live friggin’ forever.
gotten there.  This seemed as good a time as any.  He needed more from the angel before he took off again.
Then Sam remembered that Castiel had just broken the wall in his mind and maybe that meant the angel didn’t really forgive him after all.  That could have been a sort of revenge for what Sam had done to him.  Part of Sam couldn’t help but feel that Castiel might have been justified in hurting him, besides Sam seemed okay so far, now that he had woken up.
“Okay, I have an idea,” Dean murmured, closing the space between them and tipping the clueless angel’s chin up a tad to kiss him.
Dean was seated at the small table, eating heartily, with his feet up on the spare chair.  Castiel had sat on the end of one of the beds and put on the television.  Maybe they could borrow some books from Bobby when they left on their next case.  Dean figured Castiel would appreciate having something else to do.  Another message came through.
The plan to flirt with the ghancanagh hadn’t been too off-putting since Dean considered most of what he and Sam did while hunting to be bullshit.  They BSed their way through everything and, yes, in the past Dean had harmlessly flirted with guys on occasion to get what they needed, which was usually information.  It was all part of the job, it made him a good hunter, a master manipulator.  The plan had been to flirt and drive the ghancanagh to the apartment, not to fondle him in the car and lick the fucker’s neck.  Dean didn’t need to get a reputation for messing around with guys.  He wondered what Sam thought of the whole thing.  At least he and Cas didn’t see much.
, Dean.”  Cas hesitates, all miserable and guilty looking again and Dean hates it. “But yes, you, I’m
Castiel spied the basket with the lube in it and he stood rooted to the spot, contemplating.  Soulless Sam had insinuated that Dean… wanted him, the same way Sam had forced him.   Sam had said Dean would enjoy it, but… but Dean wouldn’t.  Dean couldn’t want that.  Castiel couldn’t believe what Sam had said.  It had all been lies to torment him.  The assault was not remotely the same as the sex they had last night.   Dean didn’t want to hurt him, so it didn’t make sense that he was buying lube.
Figuring he’d get in the shower in a minute, Dean wiped his hands on his stomach.  He answered Cas’ phone, mainly because he hated that song.
“Cas,” he gasped, breaking the kiss, his hands in the angel’s hair.  “Hands.  Can we use hands, Cas?  You—You’ll love it and I wanna touch you everywhere.”
Castiel returned his lips to Dean’s and walked him backwards to the bed.  When Dean’s legs collided with the mattress, he sat and pulled Castiel down with him.  Leaning backwards, Dean maneuvered them into a horizontal position and the men kissed lazily, taking their time, and slowly exploring each other’s mouths.  There was no reason to rush and Dean decided it was fitting that he could use this time to experimentally kiss Castiel and determine his preferences.  It was exactly the type of research Dean could get behind.
Turning off the light, Dean got in on the other side of the bed and pulled Castiel close, holding the angel against his chest.
“True,” Sam conceded.  “Well, we need to figure out how to find this thing, fast.  It’s still claiming victims.”
All things considered, Sam thought it had gone well. He wasn’t sure that his efforts would really have the effect he wanted, but it had definitely satisfied him to see Castiel degraded.  It was about time someone knocked that angel down a peg.
Dean gets his hands on Cas, jacking his dick, and this time Cas has his feet underneath him. He’s able to hump forward into Dean’s hands, desperate movements demanding more now that Dean’s touching him again.  Dean’s dick is resting on Cas’s face while he happily licks and sucks at Dean’s balls, making a sloppy mess of himself.
Encouraged by Castiel driving them closer, Dean released the angel and yanked his own boxers down, before dropping his hips lower and sliding his cock along Castiel’s.
“Done!” Dean announced, yanking his hands away from Castiel and into the air like it had been a burger eating contest and the time was up.
It was good to see Castiel and Dean told him so.  Castiel informed them that he believed Crowley to be alive and at Dean’s prompting Bobby admitted they owed Castiel an apology for thinking he was working with the demon.  Sam confessed they had been hunting the slippery king of hell for some time.
“In the past, your boastful manner concerning women always gave me the impression that it was a challenge to convince them to go home with you, but that was easy, Dean.  I hardly did anything.”
Dean's new roommate, Cas, is cute if a bit strange. He doesn't seem to understand that it's not normal to walk around your home naked all the time, especially not in front of your new roommate. He doesn't do this in an exhibitionist way, he's just more comfortable this way. Dean lives in a near constant state of arousal thanks to Cas' habit and one day he just snaps. He comes home to find Cas napping on the couch nude and takes him. When he realizes what a deep sleeper Cas is he takes his time playing with his hole and Cas finally wakes up just as Dean is entering him. As he's never been with a man and always considered himself straight he fights it and tries to push Dean off at first until he accepts how good it feels and eventually comes harder than ever, completely untouched.  Bareback/creampie would be a bonus.
Smiling, Dean resumed his lazy strokes and licked at Castiel’s entrance again, tongue flat.  Dean lapped and teased his tongue against Castiel’s hole, swirling around and dipping into the rim.  Stopping to get more lube, Dean was surprised when Castiel pulled at him and lurched forward, kissing Dean needily.  Holding the angel tightly, Dean kissed him back until he seemed a bit calmer.
Sam frowned at his brother’s panicked response and the creep of red on the back of his neck.  Why did he have to be such an idiot sometimes?
talk about it?  Have you met me, Cas?  And I told you to drop it.  If I didn’t want to talk about it when I was drunk, then I sure as shit don’t want to talk about it sober.”
Dean tried not to make a face when Castiel informed him of this outside, where he had gone to find Dean once Bobby dismissed him.  It didn’t take a genius to understand that Bobby was essentially making the bedroom available to Dean and Castiel.  After all, what would an angel do with a bed when he didn’t even sleep?
Shocked that Dean hadn’t woken up, Sam’s amazement continued when he saw that Castiel was rubbing his back and Dean legit
Castiel didn’t dignify that with a response. The words irritated Castiel, but he knew they were trying to torment him and he refused to let the fabrications bother him.  The angel knew how Dean felt about him, his actions made it clear.  Poisoned words from an obviously ill-intentioned fake weren’t going to sway him.
Castiel was sitting rigidly in the booth and frequently touching the glasses.  He wasn’t used to wearing them and the oft-repeated movement made it obvious.  Sometimes when Castiel wanted to look at Sam or Dean he dipped his head and looked over the top of the frames.
“Kay, well have fun saving the common suburban raccoon or whatever it is you do at benefits.  Hope they’ve got an open bar.”
Castiel had stopped with his face hovering mere inches from Dean’s nose.  Dean felt uncharacteristically nervous.  He normally excelled at all bedroom related activities.  He felt tense and his mouth was a little dry and if Castiel got any closer he’d go cross-eyed.
“Gotta check your blood pressure,” Dean says, fitting the stethoscope tips into his ears and resting the other end in the crook of Cas’s arm.
A little while later, Sam was contemplating going for a run when an opportunity presented itself.  Dean had finally left Castiel’s side and was collecting his things to get a shower.  Hesitating at the door to the bathroom, Dean turned back to face Sam and pointed unnecessarily to Castiel.
“You. This. Us. Your hands and mouth,” Castiel said with his strong fingers cupping handfuls of Dean’s ass.
“Great, because without your power, you’re just a baby in a trench coat,” Dean bluntly joked, exasperated.
Instead of Castiel, he got a different angel named Rachel.  Briefly Dean worried that Castiel might be mad at him, the angel had never sent someone else in his place.  Rachel explained that she was there to assist them since Castiel was too busy commanding an army to do so.  Dean could have done without her attitude.  He found himself losing his patience, especially when Rachel accused them of only calling when they needed something.  That hit close to home, hadn’t Dean thought that himself last time he’d prayed to Castiel?
So much for staying away from Dean.  It was like he couldn’t help himself.  Sam noted the time.  The angel must have gone to him right away.
Castiel bristled at the suggestion of returning to the water, looking for all the world like a nearly drowned cat with his sopping hair and waterlogged clothes.
“Flip around, Cas.  Head back down that way, legs up here,” Dean said, pushing Castiel the way he wanted him to go.
Rushing forward, Dean caught Castiel’s lips with his, muffling his incoherent sounds and stroking him swiftly.  Leaning heavily against Castiel, Dean thrust more roughly into him.   He smoothed a hand down Castiel’s neck and along his arm, groping blindly for his hand and then weaving their fingers together when he found it.  Stretching his arm, Dean brought their clasped hands above Castiel’s head and held them together firmly.  Dean pressed himself into Castiel, mashing him into the bed as he kissed him furiously.
Dean continued to kiss across Castiel’s chest and down his stomach, occasionally sucking and licking the skin as he went.  Closing his eyes, Castiel centered his attention on Dean’s rough, but gentle hands and his hot, wet mouth as it trailed kisses and bites down one leg and up the other.  Fingers slipped into his boxers and Castiel lifted his hips so they could be tugged off.  Dean was gone for a moment as he tore out of his own shorts, but then he was back, lying on top of Castiel and kissing his mouth again.
Castiel only looked at Death, who leisurely made his way to the seat next to the fried pickle chips and started snacking on them.  Then the mutated angel had left without another word and Sam couldn’t quite figure out why Castiel hadn’t killed them.  Maybe he did still feel some ‘nostalgia’ for Dean.
“Well, I’m not hugging you goodnight,” Dean said, walking away from Sam and disappearing into his room.  Castiel was there a moment later and Dean toed off his boots as the angel locked the door.
Bolting from the bathroom, Dean dropped his boxers and scrambled for the lube before returning and hopping into the shower.
Dean was actually serving them food, well, he was doling out portions and then passing the plates to Castiel, who brought one to Sam and one to Bobby.  After piling his plate extra high, Dean got out a fourth plate and put a small amount of everything onto it.  When Dean sat down with Castiel beside him, he encouraged Castiel to try the food, before digging into his own.
And Dean was finished.  He quivered helplessly in Castiel’s grip as his orgasm engulfed him and Castiel never ceased his motions, jerking Dean as he twitched and came in the angel’s hand.  Dean’s legs were trembling and he collapsed against Castiel, who held him up and kissed him slow and deep.
After a moments hesitation, the angel made his decision.  Castiel felt uneasy as he walked willingly into the circle, but he kept it from his expression when he faced Crowley, glaring at him in anger.  The demon looked delighted and he snapped his fingers causing fire to erupt around Castiel.  The sight and sound of the flickering flames brought an unpleasant shiver over Castiel and he struggled to keep himself from shaking.  There was a flutter of dread in Castiel’s stomach at being trapped and powerless again, but he tried to ignore it.  He knew Crowley was likely up to something, but he could endure his words if it meant Dean would be safe.
Teagan blinked at him, “Uh, yes, often.  Teresa was always going there since she passed it on the way to work.  I went sometimes too.  They have really tasty scones.”
Fortunately, Cas bursting into his room looking for a bossy bang the other night seemed to have restored his roommate’s confidence and he had started frolicking around the apartment, naked as the day he moved in.  Dean could admit he had missed the view.
“Yes.  It’s healed now,” Castiel said, presenting it for Dean to examine.  The hunter looked it over before nodding his approval.
Dean had always enjoyed kissing, but something about Castiel and his lips was really enticing.  Those lips kept him dawdling in bed in the morning and made him eager to return to the privacy of their room at the end of the day so he could taste Castiel again.  It didn’t even need to lead to something more, Dean was just happy with Castiel’s lips against his.  He tried to blame it on the angel that they would make out like teenagers sometimes, but Dean initiated the kissing just as often.  On occasion, he wanted to kiss Cas during the day, in public.  The urge always caught him by surprise, but he never acted on it.
It was the only thing Castiel said before he was pulling him closer and kissing him urgently.  Dean wanted to move, but he tried to hold still as he returned the kiss.  While clinging to Dean’s back, Castiel moved his hips slightly as if he were testing the sensation.  He moaned and Dean licked inside his mouth.
“Tsk, tsk, mind the suit, darling,” Crowley said, supremely unconcerned by Castiel’s aggressiveness.
“I’m not leaving,” Dean said, uncomfortably thinking about how he had found Sam in a very similar position on top of Castiel, pinning him down.
Tucking a folded towel a bit under Castiel’s thigh, Sam rolled the hem of the boxers back a little higher and cut away the bandage Dean had put on earlier.  Castiel had started trembling when Sam had first begun touching him again.  Out of the corner of his eye, Sam saw Dean start to reach for Castiel’s hand, hesitating for a moment before he made up his mind and clasped it tightly.  Castiel was squeezing back right away and Sam thought they were both acting like pathetic girls.
“Hey, forget it, Sam.  I know you feel awful about it.  You’re right that it sucked, but I know it’s not something you would ever do.  It was
.  Then Sam ordered the pizza while Dean got them each a cold beer and made the popcorn.  They got the first movie going and Sam was pleased that Castiel was sitting on the side of the bed closest to the bed Sam was lounging on.
The case Bobby found for them in Oklahoma turned out to be vampires.  It took them two days to pinpoint the location of the nest and by that time it was close to sunset.  So they decided to wait another night and make their move in the morning, when the vamps might be asleep.
Castiel turned around, disappointed.  Did Dean really think so poorly of Castiel that he would believe he’d hold people captive?
“Well, that’s fine if that’s what you want, but, ah, if you’d rather, I wouldn’t mind company again.” Dean tried to sound nonchalant.
“He was outside of it, trying to strike me with the iron.  I let him and grabbed the weapon, pulling him off balance, so he fell.  His body broke the ring, so I could leave it.  Then I killed him,”  Castiel said.
“I’m really sorry he did that to you, Cas.  It was a terrible thing.  If I had known, I would have done anything to keep it from happening to you.”
“Yeah, I’m thinking we find a motel in the next town and then finish the drive tomorrow.  We need to find some place good to eat.  I’m starving.”
Castiel agreed, enticed by the thought of nothing separating the two of them.  Dean slowly undressed him, in between kisses, until he was in his boxers.  Steering Castiel to the bed, Dean pushed him towards the middle of it and Castiel arranged himself on his back.  After Dean removed his t-shirt, Castiel reached for him, pulling the hunter in close for a kiss.  He loved having Dean’s arms coiled around him, strong and protecting.
But his apologies didn’t change anything.  Dean asked Castiel to do something else for him and the angel couldn’t say no.  Castiel could see the appeal of forgetting bad memories, but didn’t necessarily understand letting go of pleasant ones.  Still, he would do anything to make it up to Dean, so he erased Ben’s and Lisa’s memories of the hunter.
Dean wasn’t sure how he had missed the fact that Castiel was holding onto such rage after what Sam had done to him.  He should have made more than one attempt to reach out to his troubled friend.  It had been too easy for Dean to assume Castiel had things under control.  That was clearly not the case.  Now that he was God, Castiel didn’t have to fear anyone and he didn’t hesitate to punish sinners.
Before Death could follow through, Castiel severed their binding spell with a snap of his fingers, never taking his eyes off of Dean.  Pleased, Death thanked Castiel, but he didn’t get the angel’s attention back from Dean until he quipped, “Shall we kick box now?”
“I called the hospital,” Sam said.  “The guy who we thought might be infected got better.  So I guess you’re not feeling anything weird anymore either?”
“Okay, well you could have woken me up, ya know, since you were upset.  We can talk about stuff like this, I mean I might not be much help, but I’ll listen.”
“Nah, I’m good, Cas.  Just being dramatic.  What’s the problem with the lube? Did you want a different flavor?”  Vexed, Dean spread his hands, questioningly.
After dinner, they all played poker.  Dean spotted Cas the ten bucks that they all put in up front, but that worked out fine since Dean beat them all anyway.  By the end of the night the angel’s poker face had gotten fiercely impressive and Dean couldn’t read him at all.  It would be a problem for future games.
Dean was still flat on his back with his head turned on the pillow to look at Castiel, who remained on his side.  But then the angel was pushing himself up to lean on his forearm.  Dean looked up at Castiel and saw his timid but determined expression as he inched closer to Dean.
Castiel had spent the first two nights at his brother’s, invading Gabriel’s space with a bad attitude and no explanation.
“Can’t forget the lube,” Dean said quietly as he brushed past Castiel, smirking at him and waggling his eyebrows.
Dropping to his forearms so that they bracketed Castiel’s head, Dean allowed himself to press his body against Castiel’s, encouraged by the angel’s hands on his back.  Since Dean was only in his boxers and Castiel still had on all his clothes it only seemed fair to try and get at some of his skin too.  Without breaking the kiss, Dean leaned to his left and trailed his fingers down Castiel’s chest and stomach so he could find his way under the hem of Castiel’s t-shirt.  He moved his hand around to Castiel’s back and the smooth skin there was hot under his touch.
Dean moaned as Castiel dragged his tongue over his balls, slowly sucking on them and then mouthing up the side of his cock.  He repeatedly lapped at the head, before sucking it into his mouth and shifting to accommodate more of Dean.  Sometimes Dean would have his eyes shut or would be staring up at the ceiling, biting his lip.  Castiel liked to watch Dean and his changing reactions, the way his mouth fell open and how he licked his lips.  The hunter always met his eyes when he looked down and Castiel loved the way Dean focused on him, reacting to his every move.  Swallowing Dean further, Castiel kept his tongue moving along the underside of his shaft, fondling his balls as he did so.
Sam was leaning against the Impala looking bored and utterly indifferent.  The sight of him made Dean’s blood boil. He strode across the parking lot, feeling grateful that he didn’t see anyone else around.  Dropping one of the duffle bags, Dean roughly threw the other one right at Sam’s chest and when Sam caught it Dean took the opening to punch Sam as hard as he could in the face.
“Nah, Cas.  I’m just realizing what a crummy friend I’ve been to you and ah, it’s not a good feeling.  I’m sorry you’ve been going through all of this alone.”
Cas nearly pouts, but behaves, tensely reclined and fixing Dean with a searing look as Dean continues to jab his fingers in and out.
Castiel didn’t seem to agree.  During the drive Dean pestered Castiel to dry him as well, but the angel refused.  It was kind of unpleasant to be in went bottoms, but the wet socks bothered him more.  They stopped to get Sam who briefed them on a potential new case he had found.  Sam, of course, didn’t notice Dean was a bit soaked still until they got out at the motel and he smirked at Dean’s wet pants.
He got more lube on his hands and slicked Castiel up again, coating his cock and jerking it while dropping his other hand to squeeze and roll Castiel’s balls.  It was partly an excuse to give his mouth a break, but the angel seemed to like it.
Old soul-full Sam had probably just dismissed these jealous feelings or acknowledged them briefly before logically concluding he was overthinking things and admonishing himself for begrudging Dean a friend. It was nice Dean had someone else to talk to, really. But current soulless Sam, while no longer feeling the jealousy, just saw this information laid out in his mind as fact. Fact: Dean had a friend that Sam didn’t. Fact: Castiel had never much cared for Sam. Fact: Sam was being replaced.
Thankfully, Castiel took it in stride and when Dean apologized and asked for forgiveness, the words came to him more easily than they ever had before.  Normally, Dean struggled to admit when he was wrong and to say sorry, but it was just so important that Castiel know how sincere he was.  Lying to his friend and sneaking around had eaten at him in a way Dean hadn’t experienced before and he had no desire to ever do it again.
He needs the perfect response.  Needs to play his cards right if he wants to--oh fuck--those lips, why did he look at his lips again?
As Castiel silently surveyed Dean, he wondered how Dean had come to change his mind so completely about kissing him.  Initially the hunter had seemed angry and upset by his actions, but now he seemed to enjoy kissing Castiel.  It was beyond comprehension how the act of touching lips and tongues together could create both an unrelentingly desperate desire for more contact and a sense of calmingly safe serenity.  It was nonsensical, but Castiel had experienced both scenarios while kissing Dean and he had no explanation.  Castiel was highly skeptical that he would feel the same things kissing anyone else.  He had never wanted to kiss anyone else.
Castiel did and Dean threw an arm around his waist, sneaking his hand under his shirt to rest on his warm skin.
So Dean wrapped Castiel up in his arms and trailed his fingers through his hair.  When Sam came out of the bathroom and uncertainly made his way across the darkened room, Dean resisted the urge to cease the gentle motion of his hand.  It wasn’t long before Sam was snoring lightly.  Dean didn’t need to open his eyes to know that Castiel was staring at him.  Before he fell asleep he pressed his lips to Castiel’s forehead, mumbling.
He was already feeling severely depressed about Sam’s impending mental break, about how Ben and Lisa were better off without him, even if he missed them, about his car which would take some time to fix, and the case which had been resolved, but had gone wrong. So it was completely true that he was in no mood for angel crap when Balthazar showed up, gave them a key to keep safe, and somehow sent them to a whole freakin’ other dimension as far as he could tell.
Castiel had begun his partnership with Crowley to shield Dean and to defeat Raphael.  He couldn’t let the apocalypse happen, not after everything Dean and Sam had already sacrificed.  These were facts that Castiel had been certain Dean would understand and agree with.
“It’s not essential for me to rest tonight, Dean,” Castiel said, making no move to pick up the clothes.
The angel looked slightly confused as Dean and Bobby pulled him by the arms into a sitting position.
It wasn’t until Sam stormed out of their current motel room, that Castiel appeared to him, worried that something was wrong.
The thought occurred to him that maybe Dean’s forceful undressing prior to them engaging in a sexual act was somehow making him think of what Sam had done.  It didn’t make a lot of sense, since he had been consenting and enjoying himself with Dean.  There were no real similarities between the two events, but his feelings regarding Sam’s attack were convoluted.  He couldn’t always define why something might disturb him.
Keeping his eyes on Dean, Castiel didn’t answer, but then Sam could read the rapidly changing body language of the men around the pool table and the suddenly oppressive atmosphere surrounding them.  He saw Dean’s expression darken and his stance became defensive as he sneered a remark.  Two of the three men stepped closer to him, blocking Dean from Sam’s view.
Castiel probably didn’t miss Dean’s irritation, but he waited a beat before he asked, “Is it working?”
Cas is sitting on the edge of an exam table in a thin hospital gown with overlapping panels that tie in the front.  It’s loose and lopsided at the top, nearly slipping off one shoulder, tempting Dean by exposing his clavicle.  There’s a clipboard in his lap and Cas holds it out.  The paper roll underneath him crinkles with the movement.
Sam folded the paper carefully and slipped it into his pocket.  He noticed Castiel was looking down instead of at him and slightly tapping his fingers against his leg.  Sam thought it seemed like an anxious gesture, so he gave Cas an out.
“Ah, Dean—I—you,” Castiel gasped and twisted on the table as Dean purposefully went for  his pleasure zone.
Castiel padded silently across the room and after a slight hesitation sat down on the bed next to Dean.   Then, he slowly moved to lay on his back as well.
“It’s just,” Sam was trying to keep his cool, unlike Dean, “once I remembered what I said to him, when I hurt him…  Well, I told him not to tell you and he was afraid of me in that moment, but he still went right to you afterwards.”
Thanks for reading!  Comments are definitely appreciated!  I cannot tell you how much they make me smile.  ...Well, it's a lot.
So Dean was sprawled on the couch when a shirtless Castiel brought some broken down cardboard boxes to the door, setting them by the closet and promising to take them with him in the morning.  Dean shrugged, not caring, and Castiel disappeared again.
“What sort of games do we play when you wear your cowboy hat?” He mumbles the question into Dean’s chest and Dean laughs.
Dean drove. He felt like the car seemed a little bit empty, which was weird, because Castiel hadn’t been driving around with them for that long.  He wondered if it was because this was one of the first times he’d been away from Castiel since the night he regurgitated all those souls.
There was no way Dean could let Sam drive.  He wouldn’t be able to sit still in the passenger seat with nothing to do but think.  That would really make him lose it.  Dean couldn’t believe this was happening again.  It was bad enough he let Soulless Sam do all that crap to Castiel, but now he was trapped with a fucking demon and a shapeshifter intent on making him relive it all.  Dean stepped on the gas.  Maybe Castiel could stall them.  Maybe Crowley would waste more time enjoying himself talk.
“I think seeing Sam with the knives must have just scared you, Cas.  Made you think of bad memories.”
Sam sat on the side of the bed and lifted the sheet from Castiel, clumsily tossing it aside.  Though his hands had been clutched in fists at his sides, Castiel couldn’t help but instinctively move his arms across his chest in a small attempt to shield himself from Sam.
“Is it okay to talk in here?  Would you rather go outside?”  Sam asked, thinking the wide open space might make Castiel more comfortable.
“Cheers,” Dean said, winking at Castiel, as the three of them clinked their glasses together and downed the drinks.
Returning the items, Dean took his bowl of food to the couch.  He didn’t know if Cas had left the box out on purpose for Dean to find or if he simply forgot it in his nervousness over trading his birthday suit for the three-piece one that had fit him just as well.  Shoving forkfuls of pasta into his mouth, Dean opened his laptop with some very specific ideas of what to add to Cas’ new collection.
“I’m sorry about that, Dean,” Castiel said and Dean realized with a pang of despair that Castiel was embarrassed by his reaction.
Dean had broken a table and some glass when he fell over the railing and he groaned on the floor trying to collect himself.  It felt like Dean was always the one getting thrown into glass.   Well, better him than Bobby.  Luckily, Bobby had only tumbled down the stairs.  Dean was dimly aware that Crowley’s voice had dropped off.  The incantation had done nothing and Dean hoped they had the spell wrong and that it might be over.
Dean shot a look at Castiel.  “Understands what better?”  Sam was always better with feelings, but Dean felt a little offended.
Castiel felt like he should elaborate, maybe tell Bobby why he had come downstairs, but Castiel couldn’t think of what to say.  He wasn’t entirely sure why he had left the room.  He had just felt unsettled.
“Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Winchester.” Dean congratulates himself on that little improvisation because Cas perks right up and his expression turns tender, looking up at Dean with his eyes wide and far too soppy for what they’re about to do. Time to get things back on track. “You’re here for—”
“You smell too fucking good for me to concentrate,” Dean growled, finding Castiel’s lips again and extracting his cock from the confines of his boxers.  Cas was already at half-mast and Dean tugged his hair, angling their mouths together.  Castiel’s tongue was hot and insistent, plundering Dean’s mouth, teeth catching his bottom lip and scraping.  It was almost enough to keep Dean where he was.  Almost.
Confident he could elicit additional noise from the angel, Dean went for more familiar territory.  Slowly stroking Castiel, Dean pulled the angel closer to the edge of the bed and pushed his leg up to lick at his ass.  Dicks were brand new to Dean, but he had done this for women before and was more experienced in this realm.  He wasn’t sure how Castiel would react, but he was ready for it.  Just after he started, he could feel the angel shifting uneasily.
The second part of the annoyance and jealousy was Dean’s trust in Castiel. Although initially rocky, Dean’s trust in his angel friend had grown exponentially, particularly after Sam had broken the last seal and released Lucifer from his cage. While Sam was drinking demon blood and then afterwards when he just couldn’t trust himself on the job anymore, somewhere during that time Sam knew Dean had bonded with Castiel. Sam believed that Dean now trusted Castiel more than he trusted his own brother. It was almost like he had been replaced.
“I’m fine, Dean.  I’m sorry for… shoving you.  I forgot myself,” Castiel said quietly, still looking down.
Back at Bobby’s, Dean made burgers for dinner, while Sam made some sort of salad that looked a bit too green to taste good.  Bobby was playing blackjack at the table with Cas and Dean was satisfied that he was primarily losing—that must mean Cas was actually good.
“So your feet go up in here then, oh, wait.”  Dean moves to the table, adjusting the surface so that half of it's at an incline and Cas has something to lean against.  “Okay, sit back, feet up here, then scoot forward.”
, a shower together would be perfect. Dean shucked off his pants and boxers as he walked, leaving them where they fell.
“Now, I have it on good authority that Dean is one of your two favorite people to worship, so if you want him back, with his pretty little face intact, then I suggest you get in the circle so we can have our chat,” Crowley smiled wickedly as Castiel considered.
Although this wasn’t what Dean was expecting, he found himself feeling relieved.  Sam didn’t have to know about any of the horrible things he’d done. If they could maintain this illusion that Sam had only just gotten free of the cage, then maybe it would help keep the wall intact.   Bobby didn’t like it, but he agreed to go along with the deception since Dean insisted it’d be best for Sam.
Though Castiel couldn’t see Dean, because of Sam on top of him, he instantly felt relief at the sound of his voice.  Sam frowned down at Castiel, but straightened up, sliding his hand out of his boxers and reluctantly releasing his wrists.
Castiel had been considering presenting his concerns to Sam, but the fond expression on Sam’s face stopped him.  Perhaps John had changed.  If Dean was welcoming him and glad to have his father back, then Castiel shouldn’t interfere and speak ill of him to Sam.  Dean had probably forgiven his father, hoping that things would return to how they had been before Sam left for Stanford.
“Better than I have been.  Resting helped.”  Castiel got up, heading in the direction of the bathroom.  He took his discarded clothes with him.  Once the door closed, Dean let out a big sigh, feeling slightly out of his depth.
They sat quietly together, waiting for Dean to return.  Sam picked over a salad, disinterestedly stabbing forkfuls as he repeatedly checked his phone, texting his brother occasionally.
“I mean,” Castiel paused to figure out what he was trying to say.  “I meant that Sam only just remembered everything and he has offered to do anything I ask, if it will help me.  I don’t think you understand how troublesome certain things were for me.”
Watching Dean sleep, Castiel observed the rise and fall of his bare chest and the unsystematic speckling of freckles there.  Dean was beautiful.  The proportions and symmetry of his body, the contour of his muscles, and the hue of his skin were all aspects of his perfect physique.  Unable to resist, Castiel stretched his fingers towards Dean and delicately skimmed them along his torso.  The hunter barely moved, but the touch wasn’t enough.  Withdrawing his hand, Castiel occupied himself with remembering how it felt to touch and kiss Dean everywhere.  He examined Dean’s hands and imagined them on himself.  The hunter knew the best places to touch Castiel and he never hurt him.  Dean’s hands only brought pleasure and the most wonderful sensations.
“No,” Castiel said, suddenly at Dean’s side and stepping into the space between the two of them, crowding John.
His jeans were wet too, but his backside was dry so Dean didn’t feel too bad about sitting in the car with them on.  The angel on the other hand was gonna be a different story—he was completely soaked.  Dean wondered how Cas could stand having the trench coat and jacket on still.  They must be weighing him down.  Moving to empty the buckets, Dean tidied up and returned the supplies for the next person to use.
Dean rocked harder into Castiel, pushing him slightly along the mattress as he pounded into him.  Withdrawing his fingers from Castiel’s mouth, Dean curled them around the angel’s cock.  The first touch had Castiel gripping Dean’s back tightly and clenching around him.
Sam took a deep breath. He could feel the hot burn of tears in his eyes and he was glad Bobby’s back was turned and Dean was hundreds of miles away.
Dean was driving way too fast, fortunately Sam had enough sense to keep his mouth shut about it.  Listening to Sam’s directions, Dean sped along until they were on the correct road.
It took Dean a long time to fall asleep and he had upsetting dreams where Castiel was in danger and Dean couldn’t seem to save him, but when he finally got to Castiel, the angel didn’t want him and harshly told Dean they weren’t family.  Dream Dean had angrily snapped his fingers then and Castiel and Sam (where did Sam come from?) were both easily obliterated.   Dean woke up in a cold sweat and groaned at his watch.  It was way too early to be up, but Dean didn’t want to go back to sleep, so he sat up, peeled his shirt off and headed for the shower.
When Castiel got there, Dean was gesturing to a tray of cupcakes with chocolate icing and a green letter on each one that spelled out:  SORRY IM AN ASS
Cas squints at Dean’s contribution, looking uneasy.  And who can blame him.  Dean tries to make his brain work, he
“Both of these women were healthy,” Castiel said, studying the corpses as Dean looked through the medical file.  “Alcoholism causes damage to the body over time, heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease… even high blood pressure, but neither of these women were afflicted that way.”
at that.  I’ll have to send him a fruit basket… incidentally, do moose eat fruit?” Crowley cocked his head in question.
Sam looked glumly at Dean for a moment, but Dean had been right in thinking he couldn’t really argue that point.  It had been a doozy of a conversation and Dean needed out.  Sam could put the rest of the tools away, the bitch deserved to be on clean-up crew after that little ambush.
“I’m sorry for divulging your past, but Sam didn’t understand and he needed to.  You deserve better, Dean.  I meant what I said to your father.  I won’t allow him to hurt you.”
Though it sounded simple at the time, Dean hadn’t been able to deliver. Needless to say, he was thoroughly shocked when Death decided to save Sam anyway, convinced that Dean had learned a valuable life lesson during his Day as Death.
Dean realized it was a mistake right away when Castiel’s always intense gaze faltered and his eyes slid slightly out of focus, looking through Dean.  Loosening his grip, Dean was too slow and Castiel reacted, easily knocking the hunter back as he pulled his arms forward and then close to his chest.  The sudden forceful movement threw Dean slightly off balance and he had to throw a hand back against the mattress to stop himself from toppling over.
Dean laid a hand on Castiel, to still his hips, before dropping his head and licking along the length.  This time Castiel kept his body rigid and unmoving.  Taking the angel into his mouth again, Dean tried to get the basics right, sucking as he bobbed his head and moved his fingers in tandem around the base of the shaft.  Castiel had sat up further, watching Dean intensely with his mouth open slightly.  Dean looked back, meeting the angel’s eyes as he tried to swallow him a little further, but it was more difficult than he expected.
“Last chance to cooperate,” Crowley offered and Castiel remained silent, glaring at him.  “Have it your way, sugar.  Personally, I prefer a resistant submissive.”
Unperturbed by the interruption, Castiel licked along the shell of Dean’s ear, allowing his teeth to graze the skin just behind the lobe.  He kissed and licked at Dean’s neck, while Dean struggled to remain silent, aware that Sam might not have walked away yet.  Distantly, he thought he heard Sam mumble ‘okay’ and then footsteps.
“Yeah, uh… ” Dean glanced over his shoulder.  “Yeah, sounds good.  We could do that,” he said, backing up so Sam could come in.
“Whatever you think is best, Dean.  I’m going to wait in the car,” Castiel said, walking away from them.  Dean considered stopping him, but decided he should let Castiel do what he wanted.  As for Dean, he wanted to check out the restaurant and motioned for Sam to follow him inside.
Dean cleared his throat, looking down at the Impala again.  He was hoping Sam would let it go and shut up.
Cringing slightly at the trace of disappointment in Castiel’s response, Dean stared at the back of Castiel’s head and wondered what was wrong with him.  He didn’t really know what Castiel had been about to say, but the possibility of what he
Then, in no time at all, Dean was working a case with Sam that evidently involved virgins, gold, and dragons.  Just another unbelievably absurd day at the office.
“Oh, that shifter you’re looking for, he’s a friend.  He can do a very convincing Sam and his Dean’s not half bad either.  Of course, as Sam he had some delicious suggestions on how to effectively punish a trapped angel, so I decided a little
Castiel was pleased his voice didn’t waver.  He didn’t want to give the demon the satisfaction of knowing he was afraid.
Dean rushed to continue, “I just mean, what happened to you would be considered pretty traumatic.  And you don’t have to tell me about it, but if you wanted to talk about it with someone, well, I would listen.  I have experience with fucked up shit and I usually try to bury it all and not think about it, but sometimes it can be good to talk about things.”
